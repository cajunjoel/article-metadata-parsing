THE AVICULTURAL MAGAZINE welcomes original articles that have not been
published elsewhere and that essentially concern the aviculture of a particular bird or
group of birds, or that describe their natural history. Articles should be preferably
typewritten, with double spacing, and the scientific names as well as the vernacular
names of birds should be given. References cited in the text should be listed at the
end of the article. Line drawings should be in Indian ink on thick paper or card;
photographs which illustrate a particular point in the article will be used where
possible and should be clearly captioned.

BREEDING THE PIED BUTCHERBIRD Cracticus nigrogularis AT THE
PAIGNTON ZOOLOGICAL AND BOTANICAL GARDENS, DEVON
By COLIN BATH (Animal Superintendent)

An adult pair of the Pied Butcherbird was acquired from Perth Zoo,
Australia, arriving in this country on 21st June 1972. Breeding did not
occur until 1978 when three chicks were hatched on 30th May, none of
which survived longer than 24 hours.
Accommodation comprises an outside flight measuring eight by three
by 3.6 metres high and an inside heated house, eight by three by 2.5
metres high. Both quarters are furnished with large branches and the floors
deeply sanded. Sharing the aviary during 1979 were a single cock Splendid
Parakeet Neophema splendida, a pair of Fischer's Lovebird Agapornis
fischeri and a trio of Sonnerat's Junglefowl Gallus sonneratii. The Butcher-
birds' diet consists of small mice, day-old chicks, meat, cooked minced
chicken and mealworms.
In February of 1979 a short trunk section of Chusan Palm Trachy-
carpus fortunei was wired into a back corner of the outside flight, the top
of which was approximately three metres above the aviary floor. It was
upon this that both Butcherbirds began to construct a flat nest in early
March. Materials used, apart from palm fibres, included twigs,,moss,
camel hair (shed by our Arabian Camels the previous spring) and, some-
what surprisingly, a large number of hair strands forcibly plucked from the
girl keeper's head by the Butcherbirds themselves. Small pieces of silver
paper, sweet wrappers and any other shiny objects pushed through the
aviary wire by the visiting public were eagerly added to the fabric of the
nest.
On 14th March it became apparent that the Butcherbirds would not
tolerate the presence of other smaller birds in the aviary and accordingly
both the Lovebirds and Splendid Parakeet were removed. Presumably, the
Junglefowl posed no threat to the nest and were never attacked.
The first egg was laid on 17th March and our observations led us to
believe that only the hen bird incubated. On 13th April two chicks and
two eggs were glimpsed, though just two days later one egg had been

ejected from the nest and the other was missing, presumably thrown out
and perhaps eaten by the Junglefowl. For the First few days, both chicks
were fed entirely on mealworms by both parents. Earthworms and insects
were never accepted. After about 12 days the parent birds further
provided strips of flesh torn from mice.
Both young left the nest on 13 th May and from the outset it was
clear that the adult birds favoured feeding the bigger of their two fledg-
lings. As a result of this neglect the smaller juvenile died a week later.
The remaining offspring continued to thrive, often returning to the nest
with the hen, and was seen to feed of its own accord during early June.
At the time of writing, November 1980, it has only now begun to moult
its immature brown and white plumage.
On 2nd March 1980 the adult birds again began nesting although this
year a separate structure was laid down on a weldmesh platform some
three metres above the aviary floor. The previous year's young often
imitated its parents by carrying twigs.
The hen began to incubate her three eggs on 16th March, all of which
hatched on 9th April. The 1979 bird sometimes assisted in feeding the
newly-hatched chicks, although more often begged food items from the
parents for its own consumption. One chick was found dead on 30th April,
the remaining two left the nest on 12th May. As in 1979, the smaller
fledgling succumbed after several days of neglect and even more saddening,
the remaining offspring died a week later as a result of a sudden attack by
the 1979 juvenile.
Almost immediately the hen bird began to renovate her nest, commen-
cing the incubation of two eggs on 28th May. On 9th June the 1979 bird
was removed and caged elsewhere. After almost four weeks of sitting the
hen was flushed from the nest and on closer examination both eggs were
found to be clear. Since the hen was obviously unwell, the nest was de-
stroyed. Fortunately she is now fully recovered and both adults have now
been translocated to a far deeper aviary appropriately adjacent to another
pair of cracticids, the Western Magpie Gymnorhina tibicen dorsalis.

As described above, the Pied Butcherbird Cracticus nigrogularis has
been bred by Paignton Zoological and Botanic Gardens and this is believed
to be the first success in this country. Anyone knowing of a previous

Breeding
These two species which were to breed for us at Taronga Zoo were
obtained as young birds, mainly because in the past, any adults caught
or donated to the Zoo would not survive long in captivity. The reason
for this we found was the feeding habits and great flying speed of these
species. So, instead of mist-netting the adults birds, we simply located
the nesting sites of both species and obtained some young. In doing this,
we did not take the entire brood, only one or two from each, depending
on the number per brood. Only nestlings which were over half grown were

<bodyText confidence="0.99912" page_id="56284076"  page_num="4" year="" vol="">
removed as this made the task of raising them much easier.
The diet for the raising of both species consisted of moths (with the
wings and legs removed), mealworms (in small quantities to prevent
clotting of the digestive system occurring), and fly pupae, usually mixed
with red minced meat. For most of the time they were fed with tweezers
or a matchstick. As the nestlings became older, the food given was dipped
in water containing glucose and antibiotics. As they were becoming close
to the fledgling stage, the door or lid would be left off the hot boxes
in which they were kept to allow them to fly around. The temperature
within the rearing room was controlled and they soon learnt to fly, becom-
ing aware of objects and windows which they soon became proficient at
avoiding. When feeding time came around some of the older and stronger
birds would eat, thus teaching the others, but while still being hand-fed
they received food every two or three hours, and twice at night in the
initial stages.
A little later the birds became too hard to handle, so they were re-
moved to a holding cage four feet by three feet by two feet wide, giving
them a little less flying room. This enabled the birds to adopt different
feeding methods. The diet offered once the birds were self-supporting
consisted of the egg-cake mixture, so called because it contains sponge
cake, minced egg yolk, cheese and meat, to which is added vitamin E,
pentavite, calcium, phosphate and colour food. Their live food consisted
of mealworms, fly pupae (which are added to the egg-cake mixture),
termites and, when available, moths.
The aviary in which both species were placed measured 25 feet in
length, 10 feet high and six feet wide. In this a "natural" landform existed,
in the shape of a man-made creek with running water at all times. A
reddish clay type soil for the floor, grass tussocks, dead stumps and
artificial termite mounds. The shelter area consists of sandstone rock
ledges, with the whole shelter painted a reddish colour. The number of
birds placed in the aviary were five Fairy Martins and three swallows, the
sexes of which were unknown. The only other occupants were a pair of
Hooded Parrots.
Breeding of both species occurred in August and September. The swal-
lows built their nests of mud under a sandstone ledge as they do in the
wild and the martins on the wall above the ledges, their nest being bottle-
shaped. Both species were observed rolling small balls of clay to form
pellets which were later carried up to the nesting site. When nesting sites
were at this stage of completion, chasing of others by each species occur-
red, sometimes quite serious. Later observations proved that it was each

mate chasing the other. At that stage the lining of the nest was carried out
using feathers, cotton and other soft materials.
On 27th August, the swallows were noticed to have three white eggs
marked with brown spots, and by 15th September, two young were on
the wing. At about the same time, one young fairy martin was seen flying
with the others. As far as the staff at Taronga are aware, this was the
first time these species have been kept and bred in captivity.
In summary, I would like to add that much of the success attained
with the swallows and martins was due, in greater part, to the care and
attention by the bird-keeping staff of Taronga Zoo. Special thanks to
the guidance of Head Bird Keeper, Les Clayton.

I believe that the only person who in recent years had the opportunity
to observe the little known Red-tailed Amazon in the wild was Professor
Guiseppe Rossi dalla Riva (who lived in Miracatu, Sao Paulo, Brazil), with
whom I have been in touch since 1963.
His description of adult birds of both sexes indicates that this species
is sexually dimorphic. He gave me an account of the subjects taken from
the nest and of those bred in captivity and describes their very unusual
nesting habitat, nesting site and breeding period.
Rossi dalla Riva was always extremely elusive regarding the locality
from which his birds came, but through a careful examination of all his
letters and a few notes he published in an Italian paper, it is possible to ob-
tain a good approximation of this place. Only a few of the original small
population were apparently left in that limited area. If the indications
indirectly given by Rossi dalla Riva are sufficiently accurate, this wild
population is outside the distribution area traced by Forshaw (1973).
The nesting place, mainly in dead palm stumps emerging from malarial
waters, could not be approached by boat due to mud and vegetation,
but only on foot with slime up to the waist. These expeditions were
stopped by the deterioration in Rossi della Riva's health.
Description
Length: 26-40 cm.
Adult Male: Forehead and lores cyclamen red turning to pinkish red on
crown and occiput. Chin, throat and sides of head lilac with light blue
edges becoming cobalt blue on ear-coverts. Nape and posterior neck green,
the feathers edged with black. Back and scapulars mealy green. Wing-
coverts and tertials green with yellow-green bordering, unconspicuous on
lesser wingcoverts and lacking on primary-coverts. Primaries black and
secondaries green becoming blue toward tips. Rump and upper tail-coverts
green. Breast and abdomen lighter green with a blue reflection. Carpal edge
red. Under wing-coverts and under tail-coverts yellowish-green. Tail green

with yellow-green tip, the feathers, except the central pair, subterminally
banded red, preceded by very dark purplish-blue in the external pairs.
Naked periophthalmic ring and cere ash-grey. Beak light horn darkening
toward the tip of the upper mandible. Legs grey. The red on the head is
rather variable both in extent and intensity.
Adult Female: The rosy-red colour on the head is a little less brilliant
and mainly restricted to the forehead, anterior crown and lores. Fea-
thers of chin,throat and sides of head ash-grey or greenish grey with light
blue bordering, more pronounced on the throat. Carpal edge paler. On the
whole adult females also are rather variable.
Rossi dalla Riva wrote of differences in the call.
Immature: Similar to the adult female but duller and with the red
usually restricted to the forehead and lores. Back green. Red on carpal
edge reduced or completely absent. Cere and naked periophthalmic ring
pale brown. Beak lighter.
At first Rossi dalla Riva thought that immature specimens could be
sexed from the first plumage on the basis of the amount of red and blue
on the head, but later on he changed his mind.
Nesting habitat
Rossi dalla Riva met this species in the wild at the beginning of 1966
when, one evening, three pairs passed high over him in a desolate marsh-
land interspersed with small trees and surrounded by low, wooded hills.
In the area the temperature ranged from 18* to 35*C (65* to 95*C)
and annual rainfall from about 1,500 to 2,000 mm.
The parrots fed in the forest but nested, surprisingly, in the open
area, selecting a cavity a few metres from the ground in the trunk of one
of the small trees, usually a dead palm stump. The nests were difficult
to locate because the parrots, noisy when in the forest or high up on the
wing, became extremely cautious and secretive in the marshland. The
nests were shown to Rossi dalla Riva by a local bird trapper who knew
these birds, who told him that, though, exceptionally, they may also nest
in the forest. The nest-holes were by no means easy to approach because
of the surrounding malarial water, mud and quicksands, heavily infested
by gad-flies and venomous snakes.
On the first occasion two nests were discovered, one with a single
chick and another with three eggs. A second visit a few weeks later reve-
aled that only one of the eggs had hatched, the other two being infertile.
In another nest there was a clutch of four eggs.
The reasons that may have induced the Red-tailed Amazon to select
such an unusual nesting site are difficult to understand. We can suppose

it was a matter of major secrecy, ie. the necessity to escape from certain
traditional enemies such as monkeys, coaties or opossums, but in doing
so it encountered another predator, an owl locally called Coruja which
Rossi dalla Riva saw once emerging from a parrot's nest. This was not
an uncommon event and apparently in certain years the toll was heavy
enough to involve almost all the nestlings produced by the small colony.
Before Rossi dalla Riva rediscovered the species an old live specimen
of unknown origin existed in Sao Paulo (and still does), while the more
recent skin the Museu Paulista dated back, it seems, to 1934. Another
live specimen was owned from 1958 to 1968 by P. H. Maxwell (London)
who had obtained it from a woman whose son brought it back from
Brazil. A colour photograph of this bird appeared in the AviculturalMaga-
zine, Vol. 66, No. 1.
The Purple-bellied Parrot Triclaria malachitacea
Local Name: Sabia-cica, Aracua-y-ava.
In the Wild
The Purple-bellied Parrot is an inhabitant of the still vast coastal belt
of south-eastern Brazil, from southern Bahia to northern Rio Grande
do Sul, where it frequents the virgin forest, often entering nearby orchards
and parks in settled areas. It moves in pairs or small family groups with
little fear of man so that it can be approached and even caught by resting
a slip knot on the tip of a long bamboo pole. Its dark green plumage
perfectly merges in the humid forest, but if approached too closely, it may
suddenly reveal its presence by fluttering away with a repeated and harsh
alarm note, a sort of rapid check-check-check. It feeds on fruits, buds,
bark, berries, nuts, seeds and also insects that might be caught on the wing.
It is particularly fond of the small fruits of the "Palmito", a palm growing
in the dense forest of which the fruits mature from January to May,
attracting small groups of Triclaria. The fibrous pith of this tree yields a
starchy food substance mainly used as a thickening agent in soups and
puddings. The intensive collecting of the pith, by cutting down the mature
palm, has made this plant rarer in the whole littoral belt and this, together
with hunting, agricultural land clearing and increasing urbanization, may
be among the reasons that have contributed to the decline in distribution
and number of this species.
The Purple-bellied Parrot nests from September to January in a natural
hollow in very old, large trees, (often a palm trunk) that it adapts or
enlarges to its own requirements. Rossi dalla Riva does not give other data.
Specimens he obtained, mainly young birds taken from the nest, where
delicate at first, as was found by Murray (1968) and Turner (1979).

Rossi dalla Riva bred this species in autumn 1971 (after he had moved
to Miracatu, 140 km. south west of Sao Paulo), one male and two females
being kept in a flight five metres long by two metres high by 0.8 metres,
together with four Blue Sugarbirds Dacnis cayana. The male soon chose
one of the females, completely ignoring the other. A certain amount of
aggressiveness was shown by the paired female toward her potential rival
but nothing serious occurred as she could not fly properly due to a slightly
damaged wing.
After repeated inspection of a box 60 cm high by 30 cm by 30 cm, the
female disappeared into it on 15th October. Inspection at the end of
the month revealed two eggs. The first one hatched on 12th November
while the other contained a dead embryo. The chick was at first covered
by a rather abundant white down and had open ear-holes. A poor quality
black and white photograph taken by Rossi dalla Riva gives me an impres-
sion of strong likeness with the chick of the Red-capped Parrot Piono-
psitta pileata, confirming the close relation of these two forms in spite
of different head scratching and beak morphology.
Unfortunately no further data were recorded by Rossi dalla Riva,
except the fact that on leaving the nest immatures are similar to the adult
female, the purple colour on the abodmen of the males starting to appear
with the first moult. He also mentioned a young male of which the purple
colour had gradually extended over most of its underparts. Yellow flecks
are not uncommon in hand-reared subjects and are due presumably to
dietary deficiencies, invariably disappearing with the first moult.
I obtained my first and only pair through Rossi dalla Riva in September
1969. The male was a little over three years old. Unfortunately he almost
completely lacked toes of his right foot which was reduced to a mere
stump. The two and a half year old female had a defective wing that
prevented her from flying properly.
At first they were housed in a flight 5 metres long with a perch at both
ends and an open fronted shelter facing south. The male made full use of
his wings, flying from the perch and reaching the opposite one after
almost touching the ground.
In 1976 I rmoved the pair to a smaller flight 3 metres long, partly
shaded by a Thuja hedge and with a more secluded shelter internally
painted dark green, a colour that they seemed to appreciate as they
spent a lot of time inside. A nest-box 50 cm high by 25 cm by 25 cm,
hung in the shelter, was used by both sexes to sleep in, the female retiring
earlier.
Toward May 1977, after a particularly rainy spring, there was much
excavation at the bottom of the box. The male now sang very often and

I saw him twice performing a sort of symbolic pairing on the right side
of the female but with both feet on the perch and without true physical
contact. I am unable to say whether this was due to the uncooperative
female (who did not crouch down on the perch) or to the fear of balancing
on his partly disabled leg. Other South American parrots may pair with
both feet on the perch (as I had the opportunity of verifying in Pionus
menstruus) but surely this is not the case with the Purple-bellied Parrot.
In the spring of 1978 I replaced the old nest-box with a smaller one
(40 cm by 20 cm by 20 cm). A new layer of rotted damp wood was
pressed onto the bottom, which the birds, as usual, immediately started
throwing out. On 11th May, when these internal operations had been
completed, I put a fresh egg of a Patagonian Conure in the nest and
the female commenced incubating two days later. The male regularly
fed her in the box and in the evenings he could be seen perched in the
entrance hole, looking out.
On 19th May an egg had been laid and a second one on the 22nd,
when the larger egg of Cyanoliseus was removed. During the inspections
the female stayed motionless with a sleek plumage, while the male sang
repeatedly, flying like a butterfly a few inches from my face. On the
25th, I looked into the nest and saw a single egg. Two eggs on the 27th but
only one on the 30th. On June 4th the last egg was in the seed dish with a
large hole. It measured 31.4 by 24.3 mm.
The eggs might have been unintentionally cracked by the lame male.
Therefore this year I shall modify the nest or hang it almost horizontally
in order to provide a more easy descent. Anyhow, it would be a miracle if
he could manage to pair successfully in his partly disabled physical condi-
tion. Artificial insemination in parrots is still in a rudimentary stage and
I think that with untame birds is should be tried only after repeated
"natural" failures.

This species is rather rare and decreasing in south-eastern Brazil where it
is subject to seasonal movements between the interior and the coastal
regions. The distribution area and habitat are similar to those of the
Purple-bellied Parrot, but in the south-west where it extends to the sub-
tropical forests of south-eastern Paraguay and north-eastern Argentina
(Misiones and north-eastern Corrientes). It also penetrates cultivated areas
and cut down and regrown forest more deeply than the preceding species.
In the breeding period, from about October to February, males may

congregate in small groups attracted by certain ripening fruits, in or near
the forest. This can explain the almost complete absence of females in
past consignments, as with Asian Psittacula. In captive-bred birds, the sex
ratio is the natural one, ie. about 50%. Clutch size varies from three to
four eggs.
Further to the notes I published in 1974 and 1975 the first female
born in 1973 (which had been paired to an imported adult male) bred for
the First time in 1976 producing a single chick which died when ten days
old. In 1977 four eggs were laid and two chicks reared, a male and a
female. The latter on leaving the nest showed a reddish-brown feather in
the middle of her forehead which she retained through successive moults.
Both this pair and the original one, which I still possess, are rather irregular
in their breeding performances and on average they tend to nest in alter-
nate years in rainy summers. Very large amounts of greenfood and spr-
outed seeds and a sprinkler hose working some ten minutes a day during
the driest months may stimulate them to go to nest.

to verify personally, he is in the habit of staying motionless for hours and
can be detected principally thanks to his peculiar call, a sort of shrill
hissing sound". (Note: As far as I know Rossi dalla Riva did not travel in
north-western Brazil much further than Cuiaba. This might mean that the
distribution area of the species extends farther south in Matto Grosso than
commonly considered.) Red-capped Parrot: rather timid and uncommon. I
recently saw a pair in the dense and humid forest. I was able to detect it
thanks to the rather pleasing song of the male. Also a more piercing call in
reply to another subject on the other side of the valley. When certain fruits
ripen in some points of the forest it is possible to see it arrive, but not
every year, in small groups of 5-7 individuals. It nests in hollow trees".

"There is an opportunity of buying a few young hand-reared Yellow-faced
Amazons Amazona xanthops. Local aviculturists say that males have
yellow heads with an orange wash on ear coverts and orange upper flanks
and sides of breast". (Note: It is curious that the same mistake (?) was
made by Olrog (1968). I think that the matter would be worth recon-
sidering in order to exclude with certainty the possibility of polymor-
phism or sexual dimorphism. The case of A. albifrons , from Central
America, is synthomatic in the opposite sense. Forshaw (1973) among
others, states that in females alula and primary-coverts are green, while
Ridgway (1916) hypothesizes an erroneus labelling for two adult
females in the U.S. Nat. Mus. with an amount of red in the wing similar
to males. An adult female in my collection has partly red alula and pri-
mary-coverts, this colour slowly extending with age, and thus I think
the two labels quoted by Ridgway could be right.)

Sick (1969) considers the latter extinct in south-eastern Brazil and points
out that there have been no recent reports from other parts of its range).

of the work when the chick is near to fledge. Unfortunately when the
young bird was ready to leave the box, mother and son were killed by a
venomous snake of the genus Bothrops. I have now only two males left.
One of them was captured here, over one of the flights, where he had

tured not far from here and no one saw them before". (Note: The descrip-
tion is rather approximate but I think it may fit only A. dufresniana
rhodocorytha. I presume this because the juvenile plumage of this form
has not been accurately described.)

was possible to export them legally, producing a detailed plan supported

SOME PERSONAL NOTES ON ROCK PIGEONS
By DEREK GOODWIN (London)
Introduction
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.993799382352941" page_id="56284091"  page_num="19" year="" vol="">
Readers who are of an age when broad minds and narrow waists are
apt to change their respective qualifications, will probably be aware that
the Rock Dove or Rock Pigeon Columba livia in its wild, feral and some of
its domestic forms, is one of my favourite birds. I have written about
various aspects of it before (see references) both in our magazine and
elsewhere. Here, I intend to recount my personal involvements with wild
Rock Pigeons in freedom and captivity.
I was ten years old when I first heard about "Blue Rocks". My infor-
mant was an old lady who lived in a big house and kept white fantail
pigeons in a dovecote in her garden. I was then an unpleasantly "forward"
child, with no trace of the horrifying shyness of adolescence soon to
overwhelm me, and habitually made myself a nuisance by accosting and
speaking to any adult who seemed likely to be of interest to me. Anyone
who kept pigeons came, of course, into this category. I can remember
little about this lady except that she was old, white-haired, soft-voiced
and apparently happy to discuss the all-important subject of pigeons with
an importunate child.
Though she was very fond of her fantails, the pigeons she loved best
of all were, she told me, the "Blue Rocks" she had kept in her younger
days. In reply to my queries, for I had not heard of such creatures before,
she described them: very small, neat, blue-grey pigeons with shining necks,
black bands across their wings and white rumps. Conjuring their image,
along with her lost youth, from the depths of her mind, her description
did them full justice. I was grieved to learn that she had not been able
to get any "nowadays" (1930) and hoped one day to have some of these
delightful little creatures myself.
I soon began to read about pigeons in all the bird books that came to
my eager hands but most of them had little enough to say. Some of it
was incorrect. For a long time I imagined that wild Rock Pigeons were
even smaller and more dainty in appearance than they are. Gilbert White
of Selborne, usually so meticulously accurate, was one of several who
led me astray here, with his erroneous statement that the Rock Pigeon
is smaller than the Stock Dove. When I was called up to the Army in 1940
I had long been familiar with other British wild pigeons and with domestic

I saw my first in late September 1941. Our anti-tank unit was then on
the Tobruk perimeter in Libya. As we drove over the steppe desert one
day, three pigeons, very blue against the dusty brown ground and with
shining white lower backs, flew swiftly and low across our front. My first
Rock Pigeons and, although I was not in a very happy state of mind at the
time, I felt a gleam of pleasure. Birds were the main solace of my life
then and in the next few weeks I saw plenty new to me but it was not
until some months later, in late November I think, that I saw Rock Pigeons
again.
At that period our gun position was in a relatively "quiet" area about
three miles from the coast and each of us was allowed a day off in turn
to bathe. One had but to walk north and soon the steppe began to slope
downwards, one could see the blue of the sea meeting that of the sky,
there were wadis (ravines, valleys) into which one descended as if entering
a hot house, for they shut off the sharp wind of the desert so that one
was, according to the weather, suddenly comfortably warm or uncom-
fortably hot, and found oneself among a more luxuriant vegetation. All
these wadis led to the sea and the one I followed led to a delightfully
cliff-enclosed bay.
I had followed the wadi, enjoying being alone among the aromatic
vegetation and the many migrant birds from Europe, and had at last
come out onto the golden sand of the little bay. I was about to undress
when a movement in the air caught my eye. Four Rock Pigeons came
sweeping down along the side of the wadi in a lovely smooth, speeding
glide, punctuated by occasional forceful wing beats, curled over the
cliff top to my right and with a quick flutter had alighted and were out
of my sight. I had not then acquired any binoculars and, for the thous-
andth time, regretted my folly in letting myself be persuaded into leaving
them at home.
I had, however, seen the indentation of the cliff where they had gone.
My swim forgotten, I hurried back up the beach and cautiously appro-
ached the cliff-top at a point that I calculated would be just above the
Rock Pigeons. It was indeed, but too much so, for when I poked my head
over, they were all on a ledge barely 12 feet below me and flew off almost
at the same moment. For a second they were in clear view, shining green
and purple necks (Libyan Rock Pigeons tend to have more vividly glossy
necks than do their Scottish counterparts), barred wings and white lower

backs shining. Then they were gone but, typing this, I can see them still.
Alas, I never saw that wadi or that bay again as a few days later we moved
to more stressful places. Later that winter, around Cyrene, I saw many
parties of Rock Pigeons in flight or seeking food in the rain-soaked fields
but never got very close to them.
In my last few months overseas, I was based at a camp at Maadi, near
Cairo. The race of Rock Pigeon found in the Nile Valley C livia schim-
peri is very small and pale, indeed in its small size it quite fitted my
childhood idea of the size of a wild Rock Pigeon. Most of those that I
saw were associating with dovecote or feral pigeons of the same type
and besides the barred wild coloured birds, checkers and grizzles were
common. These wild-type dovecote pigeons seemed in the main to asso-
ciate together and with apparently genuine wild birds but not, or only
to a lesser extent, with the larger types of domestic pigeons also very
commonly kept in Egypt. Most of these latter were white, pied or red in
colour; in the reds and red pieds the colour was often of a very rich, glossy
chestnut red such as I have never seen in domestic pigeons in England or
Europe.
In March 1945 I went on leave to Beirut. Here I soon discovered a
bird shop. Among the large numbers of domestic pigeons, oriental frills,
swifts, African owls, fantails and the rare (in England) and beautiful
Damascenes were some wild Rock Pigeons, to me more lovely than even
the most beautiful fancy breeds. The Egyptians and the Lebanese or at
least those of them that I saw thus engaged, appear to be incapable of
handling any bird or mammal gently, grasping with a force appropriate to
life and death struggle with a maddened buffalo even the frailest and most
harmless creature. In spite, or perhaps in part because of this, the fully
domesticated pigeons of these regions are mostly very tame and disinclined
to panic. It was, however, clear that these wild Rock Pigeons were com-
pletely cowed and terrified by their recent capture and present situation. I
took one in my hand, it was tense and afraid, looking at me fearfully with
an orange eye set in a narrow ring of orbital skin of the same shade of
bluish grey as the surrounding feathers. I was tempted to buy it and its
companions and liberate them but a combination of shortness of cash and
the fear that if it was thought that English soldiers would pay a good price
for Rock Pigeons more would be caught made me resist the temptation. I
was not, and still am not,at all sure this was, morally, the right decision.
When I left Egypt in the summer of 1945 I little thought that I should
ever return but the autumn of 1947 found me back. No longer in the
Army, I had been asked to take part in some observations on migrating

birds of prey near Port Suez. My companion and I had climbed up into
the nearby hills very early one morning. We were progressing along the
side of a deep ravine when suddenly my eye caught a movement on the
opposite slope, which was in full sunlight. As I put my glasses on the spot
I heard the familiar "Coo-roo-k'too-coo" that seemed out of place in this
setting. As I adjusted my glasses a flock of about 30 Rock Pigeons was
revealed. A few of the males displayed self-assertively (see Goodwin
1956) but most were warming and preening themselves in the early morn-
ing sun in the way of pigeons , of many different species, the world over.
They were the Nile Valley race and I noticed, as seems to be common even
in truly wild populations, that there were one or two checkered individuals
among the barred majority. Suddenly, so suddenly that all seemed to move
as one, they leapt into the air with the fast, loud burst of wing clapping
that means "I intend to fly some distance" and were off, flying in a
tight, fast-moving flock down to the low ground and out of sight. Later
in the day we saw what was probably the same flock wheeling over some
waste ground not far from our lodgings. They were the last of their race of
the Rock Dove that I ever saw alive, and, almost certainly, the last I ever
shall see.
Obtaining Rock Pigeons in Britain
Back home after the war I started keeping pigeons again and soon
began to plan to obtain some wild Rock Pigeons. I wanted them partly
to make comparative studies on their behaviour and that of their domestic
and feral descendents and partly for their sheer beauty and to assuage my
very longfelt desire to own these most beautiful creatures. It was a desire
easier imagined than consummated. I found that even to obtain some of
the relatively Rock Pigeon-like feral pigeons of Inner London was vir-
tually impossible by any strictly legal means. The same authorities who
spend (in my view cruelly mis-spend) the taxpayers' money to have large
numbers of feral pigeons destroyed, would not allow me to catch a few
to keep and study even for payment. I did obtain a few feral pigeons but
these were odd individuals that came into my hands by chance - a fledgling
fallen from its nest at my place of work, a pigeon suffering from beri-
beri brought to me by someone who had picked it up in the street and so
on. Needless to say these were not the especially Rock Pigeon-like indivi-
duals that I should have selected had I been permitted to catch a few birds
for myself. However, having got these few feral pigeons, and some dom-
estic pigeons of several breeds, I felt I must have wild members of the
species to make my studies of C. livia more comprehensive than they

would othewise be.
Chance took me, with some friends who were studying seabirds, on a
week's visit to Fetlar, one of the Shetland Isles, since famous for the
Snowy Owl having bred on it. My companions feared that, if I suggested
to the warden that I would like to take away some Rock Pigeons (it might
be mentioned that the wild Rock Pigeon was and is on the "black list" and
so can be and is shot for sport throughout its main breeding season), I
might make myself highly unpopular and that some of the unpopularity
might rub off on them. I thought this highly unlikely and certainly did not
intend to take any young Rock Pigeons if the warden forbade it. In the
event he not only appreciated the reasons for my wish to obtain as well
as to watch Rock Pigeons but was highly tickled by it. "You're the first
person who's ever come to Fetlar and wanted to see Rock Pigeons!" he
told me.
In spite of his help I obtained no young Rock Pigeons then. There
had been heavy rains the previous week and the water percolating through
the cave walls had soaked and killed two nice squabs that we found in
a nest on one accessible ledge. This is a very common cause of nesting
failure among Shetland's Rock Pigeons. Later I got in touch with Dr.
Theo Kay, a well-known ornithologist who then lived in Lerwick. He
was sympathetic and promised to try and get me some Rock Pigeon
squabs. In spite of his taking a great deal of trouble and sacrificing much
of his valuable time, this proved no easy undertaking, thanks to Shetland
weather. Several times young in nests that he had "earmarked" for me were
killed, like the squabs I had found, by water coming through the cave
walls.
The following year, still bent on getting Rock Pigeons, I went to South
Uist. I had written to the laird, stating my reason for wanting the birds,
and asking for permission to take a few squabs, if I could find them. Un-
like the dog-in-the-mangerish London officials, he sent a most helpful
and courteous reply, via his factor, saying that I was welcome to take up
to six Rock Pigeons but expressing doubts as to whether I should find
any accessible nests. It is a common error to suppose that all Rock Pigeons
nest in inaccessible sites. One of my other helpful contacts had, however,
told me that there were, or at any rate had been a few years before when
he visited the island, Rock Pigeons on the cliffs just north of Lochboisdale
and that he thought some of the caves there would be easy to get into.
I was then 35 and a young South African ornithologist in his early
twenties was with me. Like most other bird watchers I have met he th-
ought it a waste of time to look at pigeons, let alone scramble and climb

in their pursuit but he kindly offered to help me obtain any young Rock
Pigeons that two might reach more easily than one, provided that I alone
did the finding of the nests while he regaled himself elsewhere with birds
he considered of more interest.
Crossing the two miles or so of rough heather moor to the coastal
cliffs I was stimulated by the sight of a small party of Rock Pigeons
that flew past me on their way to the "machair" (low lying arable and
grazing land) on the west coast. As elsewhere in Britain, the South Uist
Rock Pigeons sought food on arable and pasture land. I think it is unlikely
that this species occurred in the British Isles, at least at any period when
the climate and natural vegetation were at all similar to those at present,
before agricultural and pastoral man had invaded and altered much of the
habitat. Scottish moorland is not easy walking country and it was about
two hours before I reached the coast, considerably hotter than when I
had set out. Walking along the cliff top was easier and frequent partial
descents to try to get views into the mouths of caves and fissures, although
tiring and time-consuming, were both exciting and enjoyable.
There is no need to enter a sea cave to see if it is being used by Rock
Pigeons. Pigeons are moulting some of their small down feathers in spring
and summer and, if none of these little white feathers are sticking to the
wet parts of the rocks around the cave entrance, one can be fairly certain
that the cave is not worth further investigation. The converse is, however,
far from true. Many caves, fissures and geos that are used for roosting, or
for resting in by day, have no suitable ledges or nooks for nests. One
such that I entered, a small cave with a small entrance, held no nests
but about half a dozen Rock Pigeons. Most escaped past me while I
was still in the widest part of the cave's mouth but one delayed and,
as it flew between my legs, I grabbed at and, to my great surprise, caught
it. I could hardly believe it as, with thumping heart, I scrambled out into
the light and looked at the beautiful male Rock Pigeon in my hands. My
first impulse was to keep it and had I been nearer home, or had I even a
suitable large basket to house it temporarily, I should have done so. I
had however, omitted to bring any such receptacle, partly from a super-
stitious "don't fill your jar before you've caught a fish" overhang from
childhood conditioning and partly because I had thought, quite wrongly,
that it would be easy enough to buy one in Lochboisdale. I knew if I got
the bird home safely it would probably settle down as readily as do
feral pigeons that have never been confined before but I felt a bit guilty
at the idea of putting this glorious wild pigeon to the fears and discomforts
of unsuitable confinement for the next four days. On a sudden impulse I

Pigeons had managed to construct
nests on ledges such as this, that
although where the nest was built

ing feral pigeons, which I have not
known to succeed in making a nest

opened my hands and let it go.
This salved my conscience, or perhaps gratified my sentimental whim
would be a better way of putting it, but it got me no nearer my objective.
A little further on my attempts to climb up to a small recess in a low piece
of cliff were encouraged when a Rock Pigeon flew out and, after shooting
away for the first twenty yards or so, went into a low intensity display
fight, in this situation a sign of some strong impulse countering the urge to
flee. On reaching and putting my hand into the niche I was not surprised
to find a nest with two chipping eggs, though very disappointed, as the
young would not be old enough to take when I left in four days* time. A
similarly placed nest a little further on held two just hatched nestlings,
equally useless to me. Then I found and climbed into a great fissure in
the cliff. About 20 pigeons came out of it but not all at once. Those that
saw me dashed past me into the open and others, by twos and threes,
alarmed by the commotion of their fleeing companions, walked out from
still hidden nooks and ledges and only took wing when they caught sight
of me.
A majority of the (presumed) nests were in nooks that I could not
reach. Three on small ledges on the sloping rock face that I was clambering
about on, and which I managed to reach, held two sets of chipping eggs
and one brood of newly-hatched young. Evidently factors in the environ-
ment had caused synchronous laying of all five pairs, probably also in the
other nests that I could not reach. All these five nests were on top of
nests in which young had recently been reared, proof that, contrary to
what one might have thought from a distant inspection of the cliffs,
nesting sites were in scant supply, as neither wild nor domestic pigeons
use the same nest twice in succession if an equally good alternative site
is available.
I went back to the hotel that evening tired out and a bit downhearted,
but awoke next morning in an optimistic mood, eager to get to the coast
and continue my search. This sort of quest, of course, satisfies man's
deep and instinctive urge to search and hunt and, like all human behaviour
based on fulfilment of instinctive urges, if there is the slightest chance of
success, and sometimes if there is not, the characteristic accompanying
mood of eager optimism is only banished by physical exhaustion and
returns as soon as one is rested.
The second day brought its frustrations but also a measure of success
as, on a sheltered ledge on the far side of a narrow inlet, I found a nest
with one squab about 12 days old. By climbing the easily scaleable wall on
my side of the inlet, I could see the young bird on its nest across the 12

foot chasm between but getting it was another matter. I managed to work
my way round the head of inlet to a point directly below the nest but
was unable to climb to it. Discussing it with John, when we both met
over supper, he felt (rightly) that he was a better cliff climber than I and
generously offered to come with me and try to get the bird for me next
day. When we arrived there next morning the tide was fully in and water
foamed darkly in the inlet. Hot from our walk and realising that we
should have to wade round at the head of the inlet, we stripped down to
bathing trunks. John soon got to the point below the nest and started,
not so quickly, to scale the cliff wall. He was nearly at the nest and I was
just wondering how he was going to climb down with the squab when,
to my horror, he fell backwards off the rock face and vanished, feet last,
under the surface of the foaming water. For a horrid moment I visualised
him striking some of the many underwater rocks with fatal result, but,
to my relief, he broke surface, floundering across to me and climbed out.
He was blue and shivering, as the sea was icy cold although the air temp-
erature was warm, but he was unhurt except for a few scratches and not
even disenchanted with the whole project. So we soon put our second plan
into operation.
We had borrowed a landing net, and two of the longest sticks we had
been able to get hold of. These, lashed together, would, we thought,
enable us to reach across the chasm and, with luck, scoop the squab off
its nest, into the net and thence into our hands. My first few attempts
to insinuate the net under the young bird failed dismally. At length,
however, I succeeded but as I drew it back, the lashings gave way, the net
jerked down at an angle and the young Rock Pigeon was thrown into
the sea. I don't think the fact that my reaction was to jump instantly into
the water and snatch up the struggling bird proves (as one cynical hearer of
the tale has claimed) that I care more for pigeons than for people. It was
rather a realisation that the bird could not save itself, might be swept
away, and that I was more directly responsible for its plight than I had
been for John's when he fell in. After all, he was a free agent, the bird had
been in my power. I realised, however, what my friend had suffered. The
water, which came nearly to my shoulders, was so cold that for a few
seconds I literally could not get my breath or move. I held the young
Rock Pigeon, which luckily I had lifted high before the cold affected me,
above my head and remember thinking that if I did not breathe both of
us would be done for. Then, of course, I did manage to draw breath, and
floundered ashore. Fortunately the young bird soon recovered from its
ordeal. Within a few hours it had accepted me as surrogate parent and so

Joys, like sorrows, seldom come singly, however and very shortly after
I arrived home in Virginia Water, I heard from Dr. Kay in Shetland. He
had got a young Rock Pigeon for me and was sending it down by plane.
The bird duly arrived, after the usual delays and muddles that are, in my
experience, the invariable concomitant of air travel whether by man or
bird. It proved to be a cock and as the one I had got in South Uist was a
hen (Rock Pigeons can be sexed by plumage colour even in the juvenile
plumage) I was delighted. Having been taken from the nest at a later stage
than my hen bird this youngster did not co-operate very willingly in being
fed by hand. But thanks to the example of the South Uist bird and my
domestic and feral pigeons, it became moderately tame.
As soon as they began to fly I let them free, thinking (wrongly) that
they would stay with the other pigeons. From the first their behaviour was
of great interest. It did not differ in kind from that of their feral and
domesticated conspecifics (that I was keeping under identical conditions)
but all their escaping reactions were more intense and "quick off the
mark". The Rock Pigeons were not more timid toward me or other people,
indeed the hen was even tamer than any of my other pigeons except
one hen feral who, like herself, had been hand-reared from a squab,
but they were much more alert. They also had the instinct to follow their
father, or in his absence other adult pigeons, to distant feeding grounds,
very highly developed. At first, whenever one of my other Pigeons took
wing to circle round or perform a display flight, the young Rock Pigeons
would shoot off after it, using their fast, vigorous "distance flight", only
to falter in obvious bewilderment when it turned back and they found
themselves without their "leader".
Then one day, after they had been at liberty about 3 weeks, both were
missing. They were at the age when young racing pigeons, and some other
active domestic breeds, are apt to "fly away" as fanciers term it; that is
the young pigeons either range off by themselves, or, more often, follow
some passing flock. They may lose themselves or deliberately settle else-
where, they may return days later, tired and hungry. Usually youngsters
that do return of their own accord after "flying away" stay for good. So
when, to my relief, the young cock Rock Pigeon came back next day
and the hen the day after, I thought that they were safely settled. Alas,

it was not so: about a week later they were missing again, and although
both had rings with my name and address on them, I never saw or heard
of them again.
I had failed but Dr. Kay was still active on my behalf and shortly after
my loss, in August, he sent me two more young Rock Pigeons. These
were, I saw with slight disappointment, both hens. So I put them with
two ice-blue domestic pigeons of the same age and left them all until
they were very hungry before hand-feeding them all together, one at a
time of course, but with the other three "penned" between my body and
the wall so that they could not get more than a foot or two beyond me
and the bird I was hand-feeding. After a day or two of this the young
Rock Pigeons became fairly tame. The parents of the two young domestic
pigeons - a silver cock and an ice-blue hen - discovered after a few days
where their young were, visited them and fed both them and the young
wild birds, surprisingly, as usually parent pigeons, unless they have lost
their own young, will not adopt strange young of this age, especially when,
as in this case, they differ noticeably in colour and "jizz" from their own
children. The young Rock Pigeons regarded them as parent-substitutes
and, as a result, when adult showed sexual preference for ice-blue and
silver pigeons (Goodwin 1958).
In view of my previous losses I decided to keep these two imprisoned
until they had paired and had eggs. So it was the following spring, before,
at different times and singly, they were released. As I type this, nearly
24 years later, I can still re-live the anxiety I felt when the first Rock
Pigeon to be let out, after a brief period on the roof of the converted
garage she had lived in, flew high into the air and commenced to circle
ever wider and higher. It was a fine day and I knew that in such weather
the danger of a "fly-away" is greatest although the danger of accidental
loss through dis-orientation is least. Frenziedly I drove my other pigeons
into the air every time that the circling wild bird seemed to be looking
down or in a position where they might catch her eye. I held her mate (a
silver, like her foster father) in my hand, ready to throw him into the air
as a "last resort" if she seemed about to break away and fly right off. A
last resort that I knew would not succeed unless he saw and flew after and
then with her, and her present height made that unlikely, as he was anxi-
ous to be back on their near-hatching eggs on which, but for me, he would
have been sitting.
Lovely as was the sight of this beautiful pigeon, that had never flown
more than a few yards, flying so strongly in high, widening circles, I could
see she was in a nervous and unsure mood. If any pigeon who "knew

where it was going 44 passed within sight of her she might follow it and be
lost. Then at last (she had not been flying more than 15 minutes but it
had seemed like an age), to my joy, I saw that she was coming a little
lower and the wide circles of her flight were contracting, slightly and irr-
egularly, but contracting nevertheless. I scared some of the other pigeons
up into the air. Their movements caught her eye, as I had hoped they
would, she came lower, in a half swoop but still circling. The other pigeons
settled back on the roof; the Rock Pigeon came lower. I waited until she
was, or rather would be the next moment, in a position to see, and then
flung her mate as far into the air as I could. She saw him. I do not know
whether, in her bewilderment, she at once recognised him but she came
still lower and, when he turned and flew to the roof, she followed and
alighted hesitantly beside him. He, of course, at once knew her and turned
and displayed briefly to her, she certainly then recognised him and I knew
that all was well. Having overcome her initial "infantile" fear of flying
downwards from a height (which every pigeon who has always been
captive has when first released) and having once come down, after flying
high, and found mate and home, there was not the slightest risk that she
would now fly away.
Her sister did not lay until some weeks later but was then settled in
similar manner except that she did not rise so high, and, perhaps because
I had more confidence in the outcome, I did not feel so "heart in the
mouth" and consequently do not remember the details clearly.
Once again I was able to make comparative observations on tame Rock
Pigeons kept at liberty with feral and domestic pigeons under the same
circumstances. The same alertness and very full development of all escape
behaviour was shown by these two adult Rock Pigeons. It was especially
striking when all the pigeons were sunning themselves on the lawn and
were suddenly scared by a car backfiring or a gunshot in a neighbouring
garden. The two Rock Pigeons would be five feet or so up in the air before
any of the others was visibly clear off the ground. I must emphasise that
this speed and efficiency of escaping reactions was not correlated with any
lack of tameness towards people. All four Rock Pigeons would always
struggle violently and with surprising strength if held in the hand. In the

held the tame young Rock Pigeon she would not even fly off it. Some
domestic and feral pigeons also struggle in the hand (if properly held, I
mean, if carelessly held nine out of ten will struggle) but many do not
and very few with the same wholehearted violence as did the Rock Pigeons.
Domestic pigeons at liberty tend to alight and rest only on one or a
few buildings, usually their owner's house and its outbuildings (if any),
at least if these are the nearest buildings to the place where the pigeons
are kept. Unless they go "fielding" they usually restrict their foraging
to their owner's garden or other open areas contiguous with the place
where he feeds them. This, presumably, is because they have some more
inhibitions against alighting or resting on strange buildings and, under the
conditions in which they usually live, there is little incentive to do so (they
will, of course, explore other buildings if they have no nest site at home,
explore strange ground in search of water if this is not given by the owner,
and so on.) To my surprise, in view of their parents' way of life, I had
found that feral pigeons, taken as young birds in London, behaved in
the same way. The two female Rock Pigeons showed that this trait was
absent or much weaker in wild form, at least, if as I think was the case,
they were typical of it. From the start they settled freely on neighbouring
houses (all the houses in question were fully detached and surrounded
by gardens) and, at least during their first few weeks of liberty, often
alighted in neighbours' gardens. On some occasions (and doubtless on
many that I did not see) their mates would follow and begin to "drive"
them when they did so. Driving of a female pigeon by her mate is his
usual response (during periods of mutual sexual activity) to her approach-
ing other males but it is also done to try to force her to move away from
any place where the male feels afraid or ill at ease. (Goodwin 1956). Its
use in this situation clearly showed that the domestic males were afraid
or anxious when in a garden strange to them.
As racing pigeons often do, but as none of my domestic and feral
pigeons at that time had hitherto done, both hen Rock Pigeons started
to go "fielding", mostly in a large field about third of a mile away, when
their young were about 7 days old. By the time parental cares permitted
both sexes to be away from the nests together, the habit was well estab-
lished and although their mates at first drove them when they alighted in
the fields, this did not stop them or make them fly at once back home.
Indeed it ended with first their mates, and then all my other pigeons,
following their example and fielding, despite ample supplies of food,
minerals and grit at home.
Unfortunately, soon after this personal affairs involved my going to

live in London. I tried to give my pigeons away to good homes but it soon
became evident that I had not succeeded. Perhaps because I had given
them for nothing (I have a possibly foolish dislike of selling any living
creature), they were soon neglected and ill housed and before many
months had passed I was told that they had flown away. I hope this was
the truth for at least my Rock Pigeons and my ex-London ferals would
have been able to look after themselves. I hope that the former lived to
pass on their beautifying genes in some feral population.
Feeding and comparisons with Palestinian Rock Pigeons
Dr. Jurgen Nicolai, who is well-known for his many important studies
on pigeons and other birds, found that the Rock Pigeons he kept were (in
some contrast to mine) no trouble at all to settle initially but very sus-
ceptible to canker and other common diseases of domestic pigeons and
that they needed to have plentiful supplies of many different small seeds
besides the usual grains and pulses given to domestic pigeons (Nicolai
1969). On the contrary my Rock Pigeons never showed the least sign of
any ailment, rather of consistent and very vigorous health although at
times various sick or injured pigeons that were brought to me, were housed
near them, and they received no special foods. Like my domestic and feral
pigeons, they were given a staple mix of wheat and maple peas, with the
addition of small quantities of wholemeal bread, peanuts, bits of cheese,
and what they took at times from house scraps thrown onto the lawn for
the wild birds. While they were kept captive the two hens, like my other
captive wild pigeons, had a little hemp, millet or canary seed thrown daily
among the deep coarse sawdust on the floor of their enclosure, to give
them exercise and interest searching and "scratching" (the bill-flicking
movements) for it. Once they were given their liberty I did not, as far as I
remember, bother to give them small seed regularly. Grit and Kilpatrick's
Pigeon Minerals were always available and, like my other pigeons, when
they were feeding young, they ate a lot of the latter.
The differences between my experiences and Nicolai's might, especially
in view of mine being based on only four individuals, be due to chance.
They might on the other hand be due to genetic differences in the birds
involved. It appears (Nicolai 1976) that Dr. Nicolai's Rock Pigeons came
from Palestine. Whatever it may be for its human inhabitants, compared to
the Shetlands and Hebrides with their long winter nights and cool wet
summers, Palestine probably is a "land flowing with milk and honey" (or
at least with seeds and small snails) to a Rock Pigeon. It would not be

OBSERVATIONS ON CHLOROPSIS
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.998383055555556" page_id="56284106"  page_num="34" year="" vol="">
By L. GIBSON (Burnaby, British Columbia, Canada)
Chloropsis are attractive green birds and the species and sexes are all
rather alike, with the obvious exception of C hardwickei. They are
birds of tropical Asia, with Bangkok being the approximate centre of
the range for all species. This does not mean that all are found in Thailand,
although five species overlap there. They can be fairly described as
song birds, and are kept as such in their native lands.
The following notes are observations on two species, eleven C. auri-
frons and five C. hardwickei, over a period of seven years, in my own
aviaries.
Chloropsis are sometimes called leafbirds. This is the Malay name,
but I do not know if this is the original. It probably alludes to
the green colour, or possibly to their arboreal habits, and is a reasonable
linguistic description.
In the "Bird Guide of Thailand" (Lekagul and Cronin), they are re-
ferred to, in Thai, as "Banana Leaf Green Birds". My Siamese syntax
being poor, I do not know if this is a name or merely a description. It
could also be "Leaf Green Banana Bird" or ''Green Banana Leaf Bird".
Thai speakers please write. The term "Lruitsucker" is misleading, and
sounds like some kind of parasite. The scientific name Chloropsis is easy
enough to use. C. aurifrons is usually referred to as the Gold-fronted
Chloropsis, whereas the name really means "Gold-forehead", which is
descriptively accurate. It will be called simply aurifrons from here on.
C. hardwickei is perhaps named for Albert Yorke, sixth Earl of Hard-
wicke, an Englishman who was in India at the end of last century. This
is only an inspired guess, as I was unable to dig up any information on
the name.
I have always found that the study of a bird's native habitat is one of
the more fascinating sidelines of aviculture. It has always been a source
of annoyance to me that I travelled a lot before I started keeping birds,
and am constantly reminded of lost opportunities for studying a par-
ticular species in situ. But I always had a keen interest in, among other
things, ornithology, botany and entomology, and still took in a lot of
useful information.
The study of habitat, including climate, geography, flora, and even
local cultural attitudes towards birds, is an important early step in the

attempt to breed a difficult species, or to improve success with more
easily bred birds. It is most interesting to actually visit an area, but a
trip to the library is usually safer, almost as helpful, and much cheaper.
Apart from general field descriptions, I have been unable to find any
specific accounts of Chloropsis, either in the wild or in captivity, but I
do not have access to a great deal of literature. Nothing appears to be
recorded of their breeding habits. Books on aviculture give general infor-
mation only and also misinformation. An example of the latter is a fre-
quently made statement that fruit is the mainstay of the wild Chloropsis
diet. My experience with the birds does not bear this out, but it can be
easily envisaged how the idea arose. I believe it is due to observer bias.
The birds are commonly reported as flocking to a fig tree, etc, which
they do; it is easy and rewarding for an observer to watch such a tree and
report on the large number and variety of birds that visit it. The food is
identifiable, and of course it remains on the same spot. Birds foraging
for insects do so more discreetly than when feeding on fruit, and of neces-
sity they must scatter over a wider area. If there is a difference in num-
bers, there would tend to be more at the single source of fruit, and fewer
in view over the insect habitat. In addition, it is much more difficult to
identify the food stuff where insects are concerned. They may be carried
off to another spot to be eaten; whereas there is no problem in identifying
fruit, and the bird may have to sit on the one spot until it has finished
eating. It would certainly remain in the tree or bush.
An example of this was seen in my own garden. Overseas visitors sitting
in the garden, over a two week period in July, saw a number of Robins
T. migratorius spend part of the day, every day, sitting in a cherry tree
and stuffing themselves with fruit. Not knowing anything about Robins,
they concluded that they were fruit- eaters, or at least vegetarians. In
fact, 90% of the diet of local Robins consists of earthworms. In fairness
to the Robins, Starlings are a much greater nuisance in the garden.
Distribution and Habitat
Aurifrons has the widest distribution (along with C. cochinchinensis)
and for this reason is probably the commonest species. Its ability as a
songster, as well as its availability, may influence its collection by export-
ers, and it is certainly the commonest Chloropsis in aviculture. It ranges
from India and Sri Lanka across Indochina, being absent, I think, from
the Malay Peninsula and reappearing in Sumatra. The range of C. hard-
wickei is rather vaguely given as the Himalayas - exactly where is not
clear, but it would have to be the eastern half - with patchy distribution

across the northern half of Indochina into China, where it borders on the
latter. Like the aurifrons, it reappears to the south of its range,
in peninsular Malaysia in this case. One subspecies of hardwickei (probably
Indochinese) is said to have quite orange underparts. All my birds were
a dull yellow ochre colour. I have no information on the distribution of
subspecies, but I have seen a pair of Malaysian birds with the same colour-
ing. The intermittent distribution of hardwickei may be partly explained
by the fact that it is a bird of highland forest, whereas aurifrons is a
bird of lowland forest, with 1000 m. (3,300 ft.) being the approximate
limit in both directions ( +/- 300 m.)
Possibly these Chloropsis, and other species in the area, have a more
continuous distribution than reported. Asian ornithological records have
been compiled by a tiny handful of dedicated individuals, scattered in
area and time, struggling against geographical, political and cultural odds.
The semi-permanent state of war in Indochina has been both a hindrance
and a help, the latter because Europeans came and studied the birds in the
area.
Constantly active, Chloropsis are strictly arboreal and are associated
with patches of broadleaf deciduous or evergreen forest. Their forest
habitat means at least 150 cm. (60 in.) of rain a year, and usually much
more. There is a high year-round humidity, even when the rain is mark-
edly seasonal (or monsoon) in character. There is often a secondary peak
of rainfall in monsoon areas, and the "dry" season is only relative. The
annual mean sea level temperature for Indochina coastal areas varies only
a degree or two around 27*C (80*F). The mountain habitat of hardwickei
means even more rain, and many areas experience frequent mists, again
with high annual humidity. The mountainous northern parts of the Hard-
wicke's range have cool night temperatures in the winter, regularly below
10*C (50*F) and on occasions below 5*C (40*F) as the bird can be found
at 2000 m. (6600 ft.). However, it may migrate downhill in the winter,
as is common with high mountain birds in the tropics. At any rate, winters
are relatively brief, with daytime temperatures quite warm by our nor-
thern standards. I suspect that C hardwickei is not such a highland bird
in peninsular Malaysia (Malaya proper). Even so, upland temperatures
are very warm, and there is little seasonal variation throughout the whole
area; so the bird may be envisaged there as living in jungle with
more than 250 cm. (over 100 in.) of evenly distributed rain, in temper-
atures of at least 25*C (77oF), in sauna-like conditions the year round.
It is of course, difficult to generalise over such a large area, and these
comments are basic descriptions only, but for avicultural purposes we can
classify Chloropsis as hot, wet area birds.

The two species under study are the same size, varying by up to 2 or 3
grams on&amp;apos; either side of 35. The hens are about 10% lighter than the cocks,
but as only a small number were checked this may not always apply. They
average 15 cm (6 in.) from the top of the head to the tip of the tail, when
measured in a normal upright perching position. Such measurements
are only approximate, for the degree of extension of the neck can alter
this distance. The largest birds were the first pair of Hardwicke's and the
present light green aurifrons, all of which were 16.5 cm ( 6 V 2 in.) long,
measured as above. Most books, however, list the birds as somewhat
larger than they really are.
The behaviour of both species is identical, and all comments apply
to both unless stated otherwise. Chloropsis need to be catered for in a
way that is different, but not difficult. Once their physical and psycho-
logical needs are understood, they prove to be tough, long-lived birds that
are hardier than most people realise.
At the beginning, their most aviculturally important trait should be
mentioned. At best this is dwelt on only briefly by writers in aviculture,
or at worst, not mentioned at all. For some reason, ornithological works
usually make some reference to it. This is the life-long, unpredictable,
incurable aggressiveness of the Chloropsis. Grzimek's Animal Life Encyclo-
paedia, Vol. 9, states that wild Chloropsis will even chase other birds
from nearby trees - a fact borne out by an escapee from my aviary. Under-
standing this trait is a key factor in keeping the birds, and emphasis is
placed on the words unpredictable and incurable. Failure to appreciate
this is a major cause of initial setback with Chloropsis, and has been a
barrier to breeding.
Experience with two pairs of hardwickei has shown them to be
more persistently aggressive than aurifrons. In two groups of six birds,
each group consisting of four aurifrons and a pair of hardwickei , a cock
Hardwicke's dominated one group, and a hen Hardwicke's the other.
Fortunately I have never had more than a pair of hardwickei at a time.
Both species have turquoise shoulder patches. The patches are nor-
mally hidden under the green, or show only slightly. When the birds
quarrel, the patch is half exposed, and is displayed at the other bird,
accompanied by an annoyed "chat", rather like a Shama's call. A serious
threat is made by full exposure of the turquoise on half open, shaking
wings. Shaking (with rage) is a better description of wing movements than
is trembling, which implies fear. This stage is accompanied by an assort-
ment of loud angry chattering calls. As blue seems to be a threat signal, it

would be interesting to see the reaction of Chloropsis towards birds with
blue plumage.
Chloropsis cannot abide the following, in order: birds of the same
species and same sex, others of the same species and opposite sex, and,
almost equally, other Chloropsis species of the same sex, especially males.
Then come other Chloropsis of the opposite sex, followed by birds of
similar feeding habits. Having worked through all the above, the Chloropsis
will tackle any other bird under 50 g. They may, however, ignore small
seedeaters.
Cocks are usually more aggressive than hens, but hen Hardwicke's can
be dominant. Hen aurifrons are invariably at the bottom, but can be
bad with other hens, or other types of bird. The most tolerant combi-
nation is two hen aurifrons, followed by a pair of aurifrons. The hen
aurifrons are also more tolerant with other birds, but the cock of a pair
will more than likely cause trouble on occasions, both with the hen and
other types.
They fight and establish a pecking order, but it is most impermanent
and there is no ensuing peace. A number five bird of six, after huddling
defeated in a corner, went berserk and flayed a lot of feathers off the
number one bird, whence it became number one for a while. To make
the situation more nerve -racking, they will hold an armed truce for
anything from a few days to a few months. Then when you go away for
the day, all hell breaks loose. They do not kill one another in a prolonged
fight, although this can happen. The usual course is to establish domi-
nance. Then the number one bird harries the number two mercilessly,
but does not chase after the others much. In between bouts of chasing,
the dominant bird sits on or near the food dish, and keeps all others
away. Other birds which eat the same food suffer also at this stage. The
losing birds then die off at rates which vary according to the circum-
stances. This is of course not uncommon among birds, and I have had
trouble this way between several Bulbul species, with fatal results.
If two or more Chloropsis are kept in one cage, it is essential that
every bird is accounted for, and seen to be feeding, every day. This also
applies to vulnerable birds caged with them. If several Chloropsis are
together in a heavily planted aviary, they must be individually recognisable
to the owner because, as a rule, they feed one at a time.
An outside aviary should be checked morning and evening in cold
weather, as a deprived individual would not last until the next day.

I have not conducted any experiments to see what brings on the
aggressive spells. It does seem that the birds get worse with the onset of
cold weather. This is strange, because they would not experience this in
the wild, except for some hardwickei. They also seem to be more bad-
tempered if deprived of nectar, particularly during a cold spell.
If they are crowded, and especially if they are confined together
in a small area, fighting immediately breaks out. Longer spells of peace
were noticed in the largest aviary, and it would be interesting to hear
about Chloropsis in very large zoo aviaries.
There is also the serious problem of what to house with Chloropsis,
as not many people can spare an aviary for a few birds of one species.
When they come into breeding condition, even if breeding is not under
way, no birds are safe, except those that are so large that they are a danger
to the Chloropsis.
Birds that have been kept with non-breeding Chloropsis include
Copsychus (Shamas and Magpie Robins) with which an armed truce
usually develops, as these birds are somewhat aggressive too. Silver-beaked
Tanagers R. carbo and Pekin Robins are safe because they are so fast. This
is the only tanager I have ever had. The smaller Garrulax, canorum and
mitratus, have been fine, and not too aggressive themselves. But the bird
that gave the best account of itself was a Red-crested Cardinal Paroaria
cucullata. This bird did not attempt to bother the Chloropsis at all. Two of
them went for it daily, one at a time. After several days of this the Cardi-
nal suddenly set about them. Having put them in fear of their lives it had
the good grace to leave them alone, but thereafter they always got out of
its way. There is no chivalry like this among the Chloropsis, and often they
will eventually wear a bird down, even after it has been in the aviary for
some time. The Shamas often suffer this way as they are somewhat lighter
in weight, and this is a determining factor along with aggressiveness.
All the above precludes the average aviculturist from keeping more
than one or two Chloropsis, and as so few people keep them at all, this
has been a further drawback to breeding.
The first two obtained were aurifrons, and they were kept together
in a large cage, where they became quite tame in only two weeks. They
constantly bickered, but no serious fights took place, and I now know
these were both hens. Most Chloropsis tame quite readily to the extent
that they will come to the hand for mealworms or grapes. This should
not be taken as evidence that they like their owner, or that they are per-
manently settled in an aviary. It is more a blend of fearlessness and curio-
sity rather than friendship, as will soon be seen if they get out. Their

superficial tameness makes them excellent escape artists, and three birds
got out. They are certainly not homers or candidates for temporary-
release breeding. The first escapee was one of the original two. It came
right down to the mealworm cup as I entered the small and narrow aviary
door. Deciding that freedom was better, she bolted. There are a lot of tall
trees around and fortunately she stayed in them, and both birds called
regularly to each other. The next day she was seen at the aviary, so a trap
cage was set up on the roof. That night there was a heavy thunderstorm,
but early in the morning the two birds could be heard calling each other.
The escapee was in the cage, chattering at the other one between mouth-
fuls of orange. She was easily caught on the third day, and was fine.
The second bird to get out, a couple of years later, was a large male.
He flew straight up to a telephone wire in the garden. Sitting on this was
the resident Fox Sparrow cock Passerella iliaca, an aggressive little bird
the same size as the Chloropsis. The thought of a brawl was an even
stronger pull on the Chloropsis than was the idea of instant freedom. He
went straight for the Fox Sparrow, but it was no pushover, and was on
its own territory. The fight lasted ten minutes and ended with the Fox
Sparrow being literally pushed off the fence into the next garden. The
Chloropsis stayed in the garden for an hour and a half. He would not
come down for a mealworm. Neither did the original hen, although both
birds came close to have a look.
The male then took off. The escapees all flew very fast, high and
straight. It was early April and spring was late, so there were scarcely
any blossoms or insects, and most of the trees were still bare.
Two days later I found the bird two and a half miles away by sheer
luck. It had come down to someone's caged budgerigar which was being
aired outside. It was starving and flew directly into the house when the lady
opened the patio doors. She put it in with the budgie and thought it
would eat seed. As an afterthought she phoned a pet shop to see what
kind of bird it was. Her regular pet shop was busy, so she phoned by
chance the shop from which I obtained the bird. Being the only person
in town to have bought one, I was contacted. The Chloropsis was hungry
and tired, and the budgerigar had bitten off one of its toes. Otherwise it
recovered uneventfully in two days.
The last bird to get out was the tamest of all. This was a hen which
almost got around to nesting in the summer of 1979. She sat on my back
and was carried out of the aviary. In spite of extreme tameness, she bolted
high and fast, and has not been seen since. So I lost only one. All these
birds were C aurifrons. The hardwickei were not as tame, so they kept

away from the aviary door when I went in and out.
Housing
The Chloropsis were all housed at various times in each of the aviaries.
These consist of a large and a small outdoor flight, two small outdoor
aviaries, connected to indoor cages, and a lean-to conservatory against the
house. The garden is south-facing. At any given time there were Chloropsis
all over, both inside and out. This constant shuffling around was necessary
to keep them apart during serious spells of fighting, and it held up any
attempts at breeding for several years until space could be spared for them.
They did best in the conservatory (see "Honeycreepers", Avicultural
Magazine, Vol. 85, No. 1 1979), and in summer this was hot and humid
and no doubt reminded the birds of home. Some of them wintered there
in 1978-79 and this was the first time they had been left out. This was
one of the coldest winters on record and many plants that had lasted
six or seven years died that winter. It dropped to just below freezing
on many nights, but the birds were fme in spite of somewhat restricted
flying space, because of the heavy vegetation. I find that birds winter
better if they have plenty of flying room, and presumably they keep warm
from the exercise. It was considerably colder outside.
They did just as well in a large (10 m.) well-planted aviary, but no
attempt was made to winter them there. Having kept Chloropsis for several
years in smaller aviaries, there was a surprising difference noted when
they were put into the large aviary. In the latter, they flew from end to
end all day, and were on the wing more often than any other birds. They
are very agile and acrobatic, and spent much of their time climbing
about in the foliage of the small aviaries, and I imagined this to be normal.
But as soon as space becomes available they are constant and active fliers.
This was borne out by the actions of the escaped birds.
The Chloropsis roost in dense foliage, much preferring broad leafed
plants. It can be easily seen that they are used to high rainfall. For pre-
ferences they seek shelter in dense foliage, under a large leaf, and like one
that has an umbrella contour. I have even seen them pull a leaf over their
head so that they could tuck up underneath it for the night. A month-
Old chick instinctively tucked itself in like this. In keeping with their day
time habits, they roost apart, in a separate bush if possible. I feel that
it is important for the well-being of Chloropsis caged indoors to supply
them with leafy branches in which to roost.
The Chloropsis are always the first birds to retire, and the last ones
to waken. Should it be a wet, dark and cloudy day, the birds will roost

earlier, or sleep longer in the morning.
Surprisingly, they seldom roosted at the highest point (3 m./lO ft.)
but were most often found sleeping at the middle of the available height.
I had always thought of them as tall tree birds, and as far as I could tell,
the original escapee stayed high in the trees, from 30 ft. (9 m.) and up.
Chloropsis like to bathe, and in keeping with their arboreal nature,
they prefer to do so in rain or in wet foliage. During summer dry spells
I often water the aviaries by setting the hose at a light spray and leaving
it in a fixed position for a while. The Chloropsis delight in flying through
the spray. They will bathe in rain if it is not too cold. If the weather is
too cold for bathing, they content themselves with wetting and cleaning
their beaks. Their bathing behaviour is just like that of Cyanerpes cyaneus,
and there were other parallels which will be noted later. The water dish is
set about 2 ft. (60 cm.) off the ground, and although the birds will bathe
at ground level if forced to do so, they dislike this. They fly quickly in
and out of the bath and return to a twig to shake and preen. They do not
stand in the bath and splash around like many other birds.
Chloropsis have short legs and an upright stance which makes their
tails drag on a flat surface, if they stand normally. The only time they
are ever on the ground is when they are in pursuit of an insect - or another
Chloropsis. They often chase insects in the air and large insects sometimes
are knocked to the ground. The Chloropsis will come down to earth for
just as long as it takes to snatch up the insect. They travel in weak hops,
taking no more than two or three before becoming airborne again. They
never forage on the ground, but in the aviary they will search over low
growing plants, such as petunias, for nectar or for insects. Their speciality
is extracting insects from rolled up or stuck down leaves.
Caterpillars or spiders may stick two leaves together or roll them up
with silk. The Chloropsis probes between the leaves with closed bill, then
it opens the mandibles and prises the leaves apart. This is such ingrained
behaviour that they will practice it indoors by probing between news-
paper layers on a cage, where they are sometimes rewarded with an es-
caped mealworm. This applies mainly to smaller cages, raised off the
floor. They also examine thoroughly any cracks, such as between aviary
posts. To do this they can hang at any angle, including upside down.
The long delicate beak can reach far into such spaces and often withdraw
a spider. The shape of the beak is as much an adaptation for this as it is
for probing flowers.
These birds can swing in a full circle around twigs, and I have often
seen them do this rapidly, many times in succession. They appear to do

this as much for amusement as for exercise. This acrobatic ability is tied
in with their feeding habits, and they make use of it to get to downward
opening flowers, or to seek out insects.
Health
There are less initial health problems nowadays because of quarantine
requirements, but presumably the quarantine station operators now have
the problems.
In 1972 a friend brought a shipment of birds in from Bangkok, and
from this I acquired my original two Chloropsis, and a few other soft
bills. This was in my first year of bird keeping, and so aurifrons is one
of the three species I have had the longest, almost continuous, associ-
ation with. All the birds were loaded with assorted exotic diseases, and
these were mostly attributable to the unhygenic pre-shipping conditions in
Thailand. Later Chloropsis, obtained locally, were healthy, and it is impor-
tant to know a bird's history before concluding that a disease is naturally
acquired, or pertinent to a particular species. Starting off with disease-
ridden softbills threw me into the deep end of aviculture, but I had an
interesting time working with these diseases and have been doing so ever
since.
At first the Chloropsis would eat only nectar, although some ate
mealworms. This was cured by removing the nectar and substituting
oranges, which they took to readily. Then other foods were added.
Some of them, and other species too, suffered from the well known
problem of head twirling, accompanying ceaseless hopping or flying back
and forth. I put this down to claustrophobia, or confinement-neurosis. It
was rather simply cured by lowering the perches away from the cage
roof. With more space above their heads, the birds returned to normal.
It seemed that it was the roof that brought this on.
I was given an aurifrons from the original shipment because it was
ailing. I now know that this was a young hen, three to five months old.
It gradually went downhill, and developed a lesion at the corner of one
eye. A culture from this produced a light growth of the yeast Candida
albicans , and no significance was attached to this. A microfilarial worm
was also found in the lesion. These microscopic larval worms circulate
in the blood stream and settle in various tissues. They are spread by mos-
quito bites and are common in the tropics in birds and other creatures,
including man. This bird had coccidia (as had every bird in the shipment)
and it also harboured a strongyloides-like nematode in the gut. These
tiny roundworms appeared suddenly in.numbers in the droppings just
after the bird ate several large spiders. Although this was probably just

a coincidence, it is tempting to think of trying spider venom as a purge
for worms! The bird died and an interesting finding was made at the
autopsy.
The outside wall of the heart had five large evenly spaced lesions,
deeply embedded in the muscle. Each lesion yielded a pure growth of
Candida albicans. The bird was also riddled with filarial worms. Discus-
sion on these findings is however outside the scope of this article. Out of
15 Chloropsis, this was one of only three to die of natural causes while
in my care. The other two were a pair of hardwickei, imported from
Britain. The hen died in six weeks, and the cock dropped dead in flight
after five months. The cock bird was lighter in weight than normal, other-
wise nothing was found. They looked well externally. One aurifrons died
from an accident, and one escaped. Others were sold, and some died
rather quickly after changing hands. They were sold because of housing
problems and poor breeding prospects. This left me with a pair of Hard-
wicke's which are the ones in the breeding account. In 1977 I got one auri-
frons which was a very fine whistler. This renewed my interest in them,
and late in 1977 I bought up all the birds in town, ending up with five
aurifrons and the two Hardwicke's which are of course no trouble to sex.
All the Chloropsis have always moulted without any problems. The
moult usually commences in late September or October, and is finished
in November or early December. New birds moulted at other times, often
in midsummer, but after a year they settled to moult in late autumn like
the others. Of course the time of moulting will be influenced by climate
and latitude, and the above may apply only to local conditions. Chloropsis
grow quite a thick coat of body feathers, especially if kept outside. These
feathers are shed rather easily if the bird is handled. If they come out in
great numbers when the bird is caught, this indicates that moulting is
imminent, if not underway. However, Chloropsis shed contour feathers at
any time more readily than any other bird I have handled.
All the aurifrons retained a bright grass-green colour. The green and
also the orange on the head, as well as the yellow around the bib, are aff-
ected by carotenes in food. Lack of these makes the body a faded bluish
green and the top of the head turns yellow. The yellow around the black
bib is much reduced, almost disappearing in some cases.
The hardwickei are not so noticeably affected by food. The green is
a much softer, blue-influenced tone, which is more evident on the pre-
dominantly green hen. The ochre colour of the belly was not brightened
at all by a high carotene intake, but the cock acquired a somewhat lighter
and clearer shade when he came into breeding condition.
One aurifrons was different from the others.This was the largest male,

who had the best voice. He was a light, sulphur-tinged green, giving an
overall golden green hue. This bird continues to moult into this colour,
while on the same diet as the others.
Even although the birds were always well coloured and in good feather,
a surprising difference was noted in the year that they were wintered
out for the first time. By February, all the aurifrons were brighter than
they had ever been, the heads being a vivid orange. They were in the con-
servatory, and on the same diet as always. It looked like they had a secon-
dary moult in readiness for the approaching spring and breeding season,
and indeed they went through some breeding behaviour later. Some people
think that fat-soluble pigments, like carotene, can be pumped into feathers
after they are fully formed. At any rate, I do not know why they were
more vividly coloured than before. The conservatory receives a fair am-
ount of winter sunshine. The birds are usually outside from April to
September anyway, but perhaps sunshine was helpful at the stage when
the new feathers were grown, in late winter and early spring. Little differ-
ence was noted in the colouring of the Hardwicke's but they looked
very fit.
On the whole, the Chloropsis are not accident prone like some birds.
One aurifrons was seen to be sitting puffed up and inactive one morning.
It had a piece of grass 18 cm. (7 in.) long hanging from its vent. With
difficulty, a further 5 cm. (2 in.) was pulled out. The bird was fine within
two days. Another time, a bird kept in the kitchen almost choked on a
strip of paper. It is not clear from my records if the same bird was in-
volved.
The Chloropsis beak is not intended for rough usage, nor are the
claws. As a consequence they do not become overgrown, and none ever
needed trimming.
Sexing
In 1978, for the first time, I found myself with more than two auri-
frons at once. Also, for the first time it became apparent that at last I
had a pair, or two pairs and a cock to be exact. Information on sexing
them had been conflicting, and the commonest consensus was that hens
were duller. I could not see a speck of difference in either of my two
original birds, or later in another two. Later on I knew this was because
each couple was of the same sex.
All the field guide books have Chloropsis species straightened out
as to sex, except for the aurifrons. TherQ is still confusion over the juve-
niles. The aurifrons are unusual in that the sexes are very similar as viewed

in the wild, and this has caused confusion. The extreme example is the
painting by John Gould in "Birds of Asia", supposedly of a pair of auri-
frons. The upper bird is, I believe, a hen Chloropsis a. jerdoni , although
I must admit to never having seen one. The lower bird is a rather masculine-
looking hen aurifrons. Unfortunately the text makes a serious mistake in
accepting this painting as of a pair.
Others are nearer the truth in reporting the hen as a duller edition of
the male (or that the male is a brighter edition of the hen, if you are a
lady reader). It may look so in the field, but the hen is not in fact duller
in colour. It is just that her coloured areas, apart from the basic green,
are slightly less extensive than are those of the male. Particularly, she has a
narrower, less diffuse yellow band around the black bib, and cocks in
breeding condition look brighter yellow from a distance simply because
the band is wider. If they are not fed properly, this colour difference is
hardly seen at all, and birds in such circumstances are duller, as previously
noted, but they can be perfectly healthy in spite of this.
There is, after all the above, a simple sex difference which is difficult
to spot in the field. It has been noticed unwittingly in captivity, as both
male and female birds have been accurately illustrated without comment.
The secret is in the blue of the throat. The hen has two blue malar
or moustache stripes, joined only at the top, if at all, immediately under
the lower mandible.
The extent of the separation of these stripes is partly dependent on
how the bird is holding its head. If the head is fully extended as when
probing a flower, the stripes are completely separated all the way up. If
the bird is fluffed up from the cold, or if the head is pulled down, this
has the effect of joining the stripes, sometimes all the way. They are only
clearly seen when the bird is at eye level or above with the neck extended
normally. The distinction is not too obvious from the side.
The cock has a more or less square patch of solid blue, and the shape of
this is scarcely affected by the bird's position or the viewing angle.
This distinction was seen as soon as I acquired the five birds. I was
familiar enough with the birds' habits by this time to have drawn con-
clusions about sexing them, and this sex difference fitted perfectly with
the previous theories. Some pair behaviour of aurifrons will be described
later along with courting behaviour of hardwickei.
Vocalization
Chloropsis make so many sounds that attempting a written description
is hopeless. Their vocalization by itself would be worthy of a separate

study. At least six fixed sounds or combinations are recognisable, and are
used regularly. Four of these are common to both species, and one pecu-
liar to each. Aurifrons in particular have an endless repertoire, most of
which is pleasant. The Chloropsis provide cheerful sounds for most of the
year, and they are the most consistent and prolonged singers in the collec-
tion. Both sexes have an identical range of calls and there is a tendency
for the cocks to sing louder and more persistently than the hens. There is
noticeable variation between individuals in tone, variety and consistency
of song, and I can usually identify each bird by ear. One of the current
cock aurifrons has a particularly beautiful wood-wind tone. They have
an attractive double-note call for long distance, or out of sight, contact.
This call is sometimes extended by adding the notes in reverse order. When
the original hen escaped, both birds kept in contact with
this call. There is a quieter squeaky call for keeping in touch when the
birds are close.
Mild annoyance is expressed by a single 4 'chat" and there is a variety of
calls beyond this which, as far as I can tell, are used mainly to express
different degrees of excitement or aggression. A harsh, quick repetitive
cawing serves as a flock alarm. I can usually tell what is going on in the
aviary just by listening, and this is a good way to forestall trouble. A long
period of silence is also worthy of investigation. In spite of the large
variety of calls noted, I have not identified a fixed song in the aurifrons.
The Hardwicke's have less attractive somewhat squeakier voices, and
they do not have anything like the variety of calls possessed by the Gold-
fronted. But they do have a definite song. This is a four-note call,
often extended to five and occasionally reduced to three, on a rather high
and penetrating pitch. Both sexes use it to call each other, and the cock
sang it endlessly during the breeding season. The pitch and repetitiveness
of this began to drive everyone to distraction and I wondered how the
other birds were taking it. Except for this song, the lesser repertoire of
the hardwickei is common to the aurifrons. Both species are excellent
mimics, but the Hardwicke's do not seem to practice this to the same
extent as the aurifrons. Also, my birds appear only to mimic other birds,
but this does not limit them to bird calls. Most of them do a very good
yelping puppy and they copied this from a cock Shama. A four-month
old hardwickei youngster does this as well as any, and it was born after
the puppy acquired a 100 lb. bark. It would be interesting to hear if any-
one has noted Chloropsis do direct mimicry of non-bird sounds, being
careful to exclude circumstances like the above. It is strange that mine
do not mimic directly, but there are so many mimicking birds that there is

a chicken and egg situation with regards to who is copying what from
where.
Should a crow land beside the aviary, or merely fly low overhead,
all the Chloropsis forget their differences and gather at the nearest end
of the aviary to scream rather corvine abuse at it. They gave every indi-
cation that they would mob the crow. When I had a hawk in the garden,
the Chloropsis all disappeared quickly into the bushes and immediately
fell silent. They remained still and were impossible to see unless they
moved. Obviously they realised that a hawk is a real threat. An eagle next
to the cage wire did not frighten them at all, and they came over and
chattered at it from curiosity. Other garden birds usually evoked no res-
ponse, but familiarity may have been a factor here.
Feeding
Chloropsis are often classified as nectivorous, and while this is correct
up to a point, it is scarcely helpful as to diet. A great many species take
nectar when it is available, but in only a very few can it be regarded as a
dietary mainstay. Lumping Chloropsis in with fruit-eaters (hence Fruit-
sucker) is bad. Conveniently for aviculturists, these birds will use fruit to
fill in a large part of their diet, but fruit should not be regarded as a staple,
especially where moulting or breeding is concerned. Nor is omnivorous
correct, in the sense that starlings, for example, will literally eat anything.
Chloropsis are too specialised for that, and a severe restriction on natural
food utilisation is imposed by the weak bill, which cannot break down
anything but pulpy fruit or soft insects. Neither can they dig out insects
in any way, but are restricted to withdrawing them from nooks and
crannies, or from between leaves, for which purpose the long delicate
beak is well suited. The tongue shows a typical modification for nectar
feeding. It has upturned sides forming a sort of aqueduct for the length
of the tongue. The tip is frayed into many bristle-like appendages. They
form a small tunnel near the end of the tongue, leading back into the
main channel. Nectar is trapped by capillary action at the tip. By squeez-
ing the appendages together, the liquid can be pumped back into the
throat. The only other nectar feeder I have examined so far is Yuhina
nigrimentum. Microscopically, its tongue was divided into numerous
flat ribbons at the tip. Visually the Chloropsis tongue looked just like
that of the Yuhina.
If given the chance, Chloropsis will live mostly on insects with a little
fruit as dessert. This would be difficult, or expensive, but fortunately it is
not necessary.

The birds are fed on a tray suspended from the roof, at a height of
1.5 m. (5 ft.) This can be replenished from the kitchen window. A second
feeding point was added later. This is on top of concrete blocks at a height
of 1 m (3 ift.) at the opposite end of the conservatory. This can also be
reached from a window. Similar tables of blocks are used in the other
aviaries.
The basic staple for all the Chloropsis is rice pudding. This is sweetened
rice, boiled soft in milk, as described for Cyanerpes (Avicultural Magazine ,
Vol 85, No. 1. 1979). They all like it, as do tanagers in the same aviary.
They like chopped grapes. Green grapes are preferred and these are cut
into long narrow pieces. The birds take the juice and the pulp, discarding
the skin. Next in close order, they like pear and banana. The banana has a
strip of skin peeled off, and pears are cut in half.
Nectar is supplied fresh daily (twice daily in summer) as an approxi-
mately 15% solution of sugar (table sugar, or sometimes honey) in equal
parts of water and milk. This is fed in small cups. Nectar consumption goes
up in warm weather, dropping again if it gets very hot, probably because
the birds cut down on energy utilisation. It is scarcely taken in cold
weather (in outside aviaries). This is partly because the liquid itself is
cold, and there is of course less need for fluid for evaporative cooling. But
likely the main reason is that the birds feel fuller on the higher calorie
solid food that is available. Sometimes the nectar and the rice are heated
on cold mornings, and the birds are noticeably attracted to the warm food.
Soft insects are preferred to all the above foods, and spiders and smooth
caterpillars are favourites. Chloropsis do not use their feet to hold food,
which further restricts their feeding, so all insects are deftly manipulated
in the bill. Wings and legs are carefully worked off and discarded, although
small spiders may be eaten whole, and large ones may be swallowed after
five or six legs are removed. Insects are well softened up before being
swallowed, and occasionally they are dropped during these manoeuvres.
Invariably the insect is retrieved In mid-air, with the bird rarely dropping
more than half a metre to do so.
All the above remarks apply to both species. Hardwickei are more con-
servative feeders than aurifrons and some obvious differences are noted.
All the aurifrons are very fond of orange, and this contributes much to
their bright colour. The Hardwicke's only eat it if they have nothing else
and are hungry. However, the first pair ate some. Granges are cut in
half between the poles. This cuts across the grain and enables the birds to
eat it right down. Cutting the other way is a waste, as the birds are usually
unable to tear It open.

Aurifrons quickly take to mealworms, larvae or pupae, and some will
even tackle the beetles, although they do not prefer such hard prey. The
first pair of Hardwicke's ate mealworms, but the cock only learned to do so
after a month. The second pair would not touch them. The aurifrons
were willing to try a larger selection of insects (and other food) even if
they did not finally eat them, and hard insects were usually rejected.
Some of the aurifrons ate cranefly ( Tipula ) larvae, and also butterflies
and moths, some of which were caught in outside aviaries. The hardwickei
ate none of these but not a great variety of Lepidoptera was available.
In spite of not touching Tenebrio in any form, the second pair of Hard-
wicke's ate great numbers of grasshoppers and crickets, and these are just
as hard and chitinous as mealworms. One newly acquired aurifrons had
the strange habit of dunking all its food, even grapes, in a small water
dish. When it retrieved the food to eat, it had bouts of sneezing from
getting water in its nostrils. It also had the strange habit of tearing paper
into strips, and one day it almost choked on a piece. These idiosyn-
cracies slowly disappeared over a three-month period.
The Chloropsis did not touch eggs, not even tiny Zosterops eggs. All
but one ignored small dead chicks, after giving them a cursory inspection,
as they did the eggs. A very little scrambled egg was taken.
One cock aurifrons flew off with a dead newly-hatched Hardwicke's
chick. It banged the chick three or four times on a perch then dropped it.
It did not repeat the performance when the chick was replaced.
A good variety of hard berries was made available, but they were
always ignored. Not much in the way of soft berries was offered. A few
blueberries (Vaccinium) were eaten and also some Rubus spp. (black-
berries, raspberries, etc) but generally these were only partly eaten, or left
until other food was finished.
Neither species was ever seen to eat greens. The aviaries all support a
wide variety of plants. The Chloropsis sometimes pull off a petal or small
flower, or snap soft shoots, particularly the new tips of honeysuckle
Lonicera. These are banged about for what looks like amusement, and are
never eaten. Possibly some pollen is taken from flowers or sap from the
tender shoots. Leaves are never pulled off, and overall damage to plants
is negligible.
The statement made in Birds of the World (Austin), and elsewhere,
that Chloropsis "eat some seed" is ridiculous. Recently, the Chloropsis
have been getting soft bread spread with margarine or peanut butter.
All of them eat some of this, as do all the other birds, from Sham as to a
toucan. They also eat some bread and jam, but this is only given sporadi-
cally.
The feeding of chicks will be dealt with separately in the breeding
account which will follow in the next issue.

The name given to the species known as the Snow Pigeon Columba
leuconata not only describes the coloration but also the habitat of this
beautiful pigeon - the snowy, everlasting mountain regions of the Hima-
layas, Tibet, Burma and Western China, where it nests usually well above
8,000 feet.
I was indeed fortunate to become fairly well acquainted with this hardy
mountain dweller, this "snow-bird", some years ago when a generous zoo
director in West Germany presented me with a pair. They are exceedingly
rare in captivity, even in prominent zoological gardens. For months I had
written letters to bird exporters in India and other countries fervently
hoping that they would be able to provide a pair or two of these elusive
pretty pigeons. While these dealers offered me many kinds of other birds,
some of which I did indeed import, as far as Snow Pigeons were con-
cerned all I ever received were future promises, which never materialised.
Even the late Professor Ghigi, well known as the producer of the beautiful
Ghigi's or Yellow Golden pheasant, who at that time maintained a quite
sizeable flock of Snow Pigeons at his Italian villa, was reluctant to part
with any. He furnished me with addresses of Italian bird importers, which
I followed up promptly but with negative results. So when on a memor-
able forenoon, our express agent, wholly unexpectedly, delivered a simple
wooden box with two precious Snow Pigeons, I was overjoyed.
Even though there was neither food nor water in the shipping box, the
birds appeared lively, moving around in it, impatient to be released from
their cramped confinement. I placed them in a quite spacious pen which
afforded ample flying space, on their own. Surprisingly, on release they
appeared fairly tame, not crashing wildly against the aviary wire, as was
my experience with some White-wings, but settling down on convenient
perches. Now for the first time I had a good opportunity to scrutinize
these rarely kept birds at close range. They were about the size of the
average homing pigeon. Their plumage colour reminded me of that of the
Gazzi Modena and the Strasser Pigeon.
The head of the Snow Pigeon is a blackish grey; the wings are brown-
banded. The neck and underparts are snow-white. The black tail is
crossed by a V-shaped white band. The bill is dark horn colour,, the feet
are bright red and the eyes yellow. The female is slightly smaller than the

male and her plumage slightly duller. The young Snow Pigeons are brow-
ner than their parents, the usually white areas suffused with grey. Their
eyes and feet are dark coloured. Incidentally, the Snow Pigeon goes
also by the names of White-backed Pigeon and Tibetan Dove.
Snow Pigeons in their natural habitats are said to be wild and wary.
Not unlike the Rock Pigeon Columba livia , the Snow Pigeon sets its very
simple nest-platform in holes and crevices of rocks from 10,000 feet to
the snow level. It is, like most pigeons, a sociable bird, frequently found
nesting in small and large colonies. The two white eggs are brooded from
16 to 19 or 20 days.
The Snow Pigeon feeds on the ground on cultivated grains, various
seeds, and even small bulbs. In grain fields it is often found in company
with Rock Pigeons, rapidly running over the ground and foraging. While
in the summertime it is observed usually in pairs, in winter the Snow
Pigeon congregates in flocks of hundreds and thousands, descending
from the 10,000 level to about 5000. When it has finished feeding, it
returns to its rocky roost away up high. During flight this pigeon displays
at times with widely spread, clapping wings.
Now to the pair which was presented to me. The two birds seemed to
be alike in size and general appearance. All day long they were busy,
flying about in their aviary and inspecting several open-top nestboxes
hanging about four feet off the floor. During this time, one bird would
jump into the box and immediately make a croaking, rasping "kuck,
kuck, kuck" sound, while his companion perched on the edge of the
box apparently ready to join him. I thought (and hoped) that the one in
the box was a male, calling loudly to the other, a female, to join him in
the prospective nest site. This lively activity in and about the box con-
tinued for several days. Then one day, to my great disappointment, I saw
the birds fighting in the box, pushing each other round and round, at
times "lifting" one out of the box, only to see it dash back into it. This
combative behaviour went on for several days - I concluded that I had
two cocks and so I separated them. I bought a husky, blue, barless
Strasser hen from a fancier in Nebraska. She was in excellent colour and
condition and mated with one of the male Snow Pigeons, within a week
of her arrival. The pair produced hybrids whose plumage colour was a
light blue with jet-black wingbars. I gave them to a research agency for
experimentation. Some weeks after, I lost both male Snow Pigeons

during an excessive heat spell, even though they seemed to be in perfect
health. This unexpected loss both shocked and surprised me in the light
of a British naturalist's assertion that Snow Pigeons could readily endure
a hot climate, based on his keeping them in captivity. Since that time
I have been trying in vain to obtain a true pair of these fascinating birds.
(Incidentally, there is a very good photographic likeness of a Snow Pigeon
in "The Book of the Pigeon and of Wild Foreign Doves, 5th edition.)
In conclusion, there are numerous important aspects of Snow Pigeon's
behaviour not recorded in any literature. Do these high-flying pigeons
actually build a nest in the rock crevices, or do they lay their two white
eggs simply in some slight depression or obscure corner of some rock?
Assuming a prevailing low temperature at 10,000 feet altitude, for how
many weeks do they brood their squabs to keep them alive and growing?
How many broods per season do they raise? Since they are known to
congregate fairly frequently with Rock Pigeons, have hybrids ever been
produced; if so, are the latter fertile and what do they look like? What
birds of prey and what terrestrial predators are their principal enemies?
What about their behaviour in captivity? Their life-span, their resistance
to climatic changes, their mating with domestic pigeons, and the produc-
tivity of hybrids? The answers to some, or all of these questions would
be welcomed by anyone at all interested in Columba leuconota, and
should be made available in authentic literature devoted to this little-known
species.

INDIAN RING-NECKED PARRAKEETS IN THE HIMALAYAN
MOUNTAINS AT 12,000 FEET ALTITUDE IN THE WINTER

Indian Ring-necked Parrakeets are commonly seen throughout India,
Pakistan, and Nepal. In northern India they have been reported at altitudes
of up to 4,000 feet above sea level in the Kumaon mountains. In Nepal
they are commonly seen up to the foothills of Kathmandu at an altitude
of 5,000 feet above sea level or less. During the summer months the Indian
Ring-necked Parrakeets seek the mountains in search of fruits, berries,
seeds and nectar, and are serious pests of orchards. They are often obser-
ved eating pine cone seeds among other things. As soon as cold weather
approaches in September they migrate to the mountain foothills and the
warmer parts of southern India. By late November they are seldom to be
found above 2,500 feet above sea level due to the extreme cold and snow
in the Himalayan ranges.
In late December 1979 seven Indian Ring-necked Parrakeets were
spotted at an altitude of 12,000 feet above sea level and observed for
several days. They were feeding on pine cones amongst snow and sub-
zero weather. Aviculturists have deemed these parrakeets hardy up to
freezing temperatures but observation of them in the wild at -15*F, in the
snow at altitudes of 12,000 feet above sea level or more in the winter
months is unrecorded. Few other psittacine birds have ever been found
at this altitude before in winter or summer. Whether this incidental find-
ing is a mere adaptation to the environment due to lack of food else-
where or whether it is a freak occurrence is not known.

Though once again breeding appeared to be delayed by the prolonged
cold weather of spring the overall results were better than last year. More
species and more individuals were successfully reared, even though we
deliberately curtailed the breeding of some common species whose young
are difficult to dispose of to suitable collections. The increase in numbers
and species bred is du ? mainly to the growth of the incubation and rearing
unit and to the interest and enthusiasm of the keepers concerned. There
are now two sections actively involved, and this has reduced the work load
and allowed more time to gather data.
The most noteworthy species incubated and reared artificially included:
Ruffs - fortunately two females, bringing our total to five males and three
females (one breeding female having died in September this year), five
pacific Brent Geese, 16 Sacred Ibis, two Black-footed Penguins (unfortuna-
tely both died due to an electrical failure in the brooding unit), 15 Grey-
headed Gallinules and 11 Grey-headed Gulls. These were deliberately
artificially reared in order to obtain data on techniques and diets, which
may be of use for rearing rarer members of these two families. This data
could be of particular importance in breeding some species of Rail, so
many of which are endemic to small islands and are in danger of extinction
in the wild. Many pheasants and ducks were also reared successfully.
The most noteworthy species reared by their parents included: African
Spotted Eagle Owls, Abyssinian Spotted Eagle Owls, White-cheeked
Turacos, Red-billed Hornbill, Chilean Flamingos, Abdim's Storks and
Jerdon's Imperial Pigeon. The Snowy Owls had three young, and continue
to be among our most prolific breeders. Their history is interesting; the
male landed on board a ship off the Azores, and was brought to the Zoo
in January 1950. Since then he has had three wives and 39 young. His
first wife, the mother of eight, died in 1964. His second, the mother of
25, was killed by vandals in 1977 and his third, who is still with him, was
hatched in 1977 in Philip Wayre's collection in Norfolk and has had six
young. All the young were reared by their parents, with the male being
a particularly protective and devoted father.
Again we had the disappointment of the Condor chick dying, four
days after being successfully hatched in the incubator. Equally disappoint-
ing was the non-hatching of two Egyptian Vulture eggs, both containing
fully developed embryos: and then later in the year the male of the

parents died with a crop impaction.
Partners were found for the Short-eared Owl, Buzzard, Dusky Lory,
Orange-winged Amazon Parrott, and Red-sided Eclectus Parrot, and
though arranged marriages do not always work, so far they are living in
pairs in apparent contentment. We have, however, as always, had to sepa-
rate a number of birds which previously lived compatibly together, and
this is particularly noticeable in the Bird House among the Toucans and
Hornbills.
The most exciting event was the arrival of a pair of captive-bred (1976)
North Island Brown Kiwis. They were presented by Auckland Zoological
Park, New Zealand, and delivered to London by the Director, Mr. Derek
Wood. Dalgety Limited generously paid most of the expenses involved.
The birds are housed in the nocturnal section of the Clore Pavilion where,
though rather elusive, they can with perseverance and luck be seen. They
live in an air-conditioned area, which has a floor covered in deep peat,
leaf litter and branches, and are fed on a mixture of minced ox-heart,
Farex or Complan, vegetable oil and a vitamin/mineral supplement. Other
foods are occasionally given including earthworms. They are the only
Kiwis in Britain, the last Kiwi in this collection being here in 1961.
"Cocky", a Sulphur-crested Cockatoo, who has lived in the Zoo longer
than any other bird, and who is now at least 56 years old, was presented
with a medal and certificate by the Burlington Arcade Association for so
ably entertaining visitors for over 50 years.

Recent news of the three Australian and New Zealand ground parrots
shows some encouragement for the future of these declining species.
Great interest and excitement surrounded the official re-discovery of the
Night Parrot Geopsittacus occidentalis by Shane Parker of the South
Australian Museum while searching specifically for it in the north-eastern
regions of the state. Although this was the first confirmed sighting for
many years, it was strongly believed it did exist in the more remote areas
of the interior. One has to travel in the type of terrain which these parrots
inhabit to appreciate its immenseness; coupled with the remoteness of
much of its range and its secretive and nocturnal habits, it is probable
a scattered population does survive.

Fascinating new information is coming to light on Australia second
species, the Swamp Parrot Pezoporus wallicus following a study by
Charles Meridith and Andrew Isles of the Victorian Fisheries and Wild-
life Department. The initial purpose of the study was to make a detailed
assessment of population densities in the Croajingalong National Park
in East Gippsland; but more recently, the team has been looking at other
areas of possible habitat along the Victorian coast. The September 1980
Royal Australian Ornithologists Union Newsletter contains a brief account
illustrated with two photographs of hand held birds, outlining some of
the results of this important project.
The report states it to be common in the Croajingalong National
Park with seven nests being located. Also a strong, though restricted,
population in swampy sedgeland near the Glenelg River, an area where
there had been no confirmed reports for more than twenty years. Birds
were also present in the Bemm River Mario region and at Wilson's Pro-
montory National Park. Valuable data on the diet of these birds have also
been collected and it is now thought that the seeds of no less than 14
species of plants are utilised, mostly sedges and rushes in the families
Restionaceae and Cyperaceae. The availability of seeds is greatly influ-
enced in a given area by fire. Seeds are not produced by most heath plants
until 12-24 months after a fire. Seed production is apparently high for

the next 8-10 years, then declines. The densities of Swamp Parrots reflect
these changes, the birds being absent for one to several years after a fire,
then recolonising; followed by a build up of numbers followed by a
decline as the heath ages.
The report goes on to say that birds are strongly territorial and are
easily censused by their calls at dawn and dusk. Adults are apparently
sedentary but there is considerable post-breeding dispersal of young
in autumn and winter to areas well away from suitable habitat. They
are strong fliers and observations suggest them to be crepuscular.

Wattle-bird. A colony of about 70 have been located in Puketi Forest,
north of Auckland. Kauri milling in the area was stopped immediately,

The Wildlife Service fears that this will ruin the habitat for what may be

The problems and progress of the captive breeding project for the
Great Bustard Otis tarda undertaken by the Great Bustard Trust are high-
lighted in a recent issue of the Avicultural Magazine (1980, p. 131-140).
Paul Goriup, the Trust's Research Officer, sends the following report
outlining the results attained in the 1980 season. He says "two of our
three hens nested; one laid a solitary large, infertile egg, while the other
produced a full clutch of three eggs. These were removed for artificial
incubation after about ten days and were placed in a Roll-x incubator.
Owing to the lack of incubation data, we were not sure what temperature
would be most suitable, so we used 100*F; and at the hatch, deformities
in two of the chicks indicated that this was too high. The third chick was
alright. The two deformed chicks died after 2 Vi and six days, while the
third died tragically on day eight when it regurgitated a fragment of
insect matter, which was then inhaled into the windpipe where it lodged;
a plug of mucus formed and choked it. For next year, we are hoping to
extend and improve our incubation facilities and techniques in the light
of this year's experience."

With an estimated population of around 30 Californian Condors Vultur
californiarus still surviving, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service and the
National Audubon Society mounted a "do or die" programme to save the
species. The plan involved capturing a number for captive breeding efforts.
Unfortunately, soon after the programme began, one Condor chick did
die, while being handled by a researcher. The bird was on a remote moun-
tain ledge and simply keeled over for no apparent reason. The programme
was quickly suspended while the research team evaluate capturing and
handling techniques with the less endangered Andean Condor and African

Gert Skipper sends the following notes on the breeding history of a pair
of Great Grey Owls Strix nebulosa iapponica resident in the Copenhagen
Zoo since 1977: "Young were first reared in 1971 (3), and again in 1977
(3) and in 1979 (5 from two pairs, two of which constitute second genera-
tion births). Infertile eggs were laid in 1973, 1975, 1976 and 1978.
The pair are housed in a flight measuring 6x8x3 meters and fur-
nished with living trees and some large logs on which the owls can sit. The
back part is sheltered and it is here, in the shade of a large pine, that the
nest scrape is made annually. Clutch size varies from three to five with
incubation lasting approximately four weeks. The diet consists primarily
of mice but is varied periodically with rats and pieces of red meat. Like
most Strigiformes, they prove extremely aggressive when nesting."

birds, and although it had not then been formed, or even given a name, in
December 1978 a Trust Deed was executed, and in February 1979 the
Bird Rescue Association was registered as a Charity. The aims set out in
the Trust Deed are as follows:
"to promote the care and protection of all orphaned, sick and
injured birds, especially wild birds, but not excluding exotic species
as the need arises and to promote research into the diseases of birds
and methods of prevention, control or cure and to publicise the results
of such research."
This dual purpose of active work with rescued birds and the promotion
of research is thought to be in harmony with the work of aviculturists and
we hope to collect and correlate data from the experience of others, and
of our own experience in the field. Several bird hospitals and many indiv-
iduals have joined the Bird Rescue Association and quarterly News-
letters are sent to them, communications which try to keep people in-
formed on our everyday work with birds and to pass on information that
we think might be of value. This is as often as not a two-way communi-
cation conveying as much benefit to us, through contributions and experi-
ence, as we hope to give to our members. Bird diseases and methods of
treatment have been the subject of very little research compared with
the situation regarding mammals, but we are fortunate to have on the
council of Bird Rescue Association the research veterinary surgeon John
E. Cooper, co-editor of First Aid and Care of Wild Birds, recently pub-
lished by David and Paul and reviewed in the Avicultural Magazine .
We need funds for the day-to-day feeding and treatment of up to
100 birds and for the building of a Bird Hospital with its own sea-bird
cleaning and rehabilitation unit, other accommodation for species with
widely differing requirements, and, when eventually possible, our own
laboratory facilities.

ROTHSCHILD'S GRACKLE
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.950069542857143" page_id="56284135"  page_num="63" year="" vol="">
In the article entitled "A Note on Javanese Aviculture" Alastair Morri-
(c)n implies that Rothschild's Grackle is threatened with extinction as a
result of the activities of aviculturists. I have yet to see any reliable evi-
dence that this assertion which has been made so often is true. The future
of Rothschild's Grackle is threatened because Bali has now become very
important commercially as a tourist centre and like many other species it
will disappear because of man's erosion of its natural habitat.
The survival of many species depends upon properly controlled breed-
ing programmes in captivity. Many zoological institutions have tackled
the problem successfully with some mammalian species but birds are
apparently not of sufficient interest to the general public for zoos to
spend large sums of money on providing suitable breeding accommod-
ation. Of course, Jersey Zoo is a notable exception in this respect and it
has been shown there that Rothshchild's Grackle may well be saved by
breeding in captivity. However, many private aviculturists have had equally
good successes with this species and it is only through the efforts of the
back-garden aviculturists that many others will be preserved as living
rather than as museum specimens.
A few years ago (Avicultural Magazine, Volume 82, No. 2. 1976)
Alastair Morrison made the suggestion that Hooded and Golden-
shouldered Parrots should be high on a list of species which should not be
kept in captivity despite the fact that both are eminently suitable for
aviculture and are being bred in gradually increasing numbers in Europe
and their country of origin. In the 1930s, aviculturists were blamed for the
disappearance from their habitat in Australia of the Bourke's, the Splendid
and the Turquoisine Grass Parrakeet. However, not only are these species
now relatively common in the wild but they are being bred in such large
numbers in captivity that they can be regarded as domesticated. Perhaps
Alastair Morrison should visit some of the aviaries in Europe and Australia
to see that private aviculturists have an important part to play in conserv-
ation.

Forpus passerinus vividus
By A.J. Mobbs (Walsall, West Midlands)
Housing
Most authors when writing on parrotlets recommend aviary accommo-
dation. No doubt aviary conditions are ideal, but not everybody can pro-
vide such accommodation and for those people, I would suggest they
house a breeding pair in a large flight cage.
My parrotlets are housed in an indoor cage measuring 44 inches wide
by 36 inches high and 16 inches deep. As well as the perches usually fitted
to such a cage, I supply a perch which reaches from floor to ceiling. This
is used regularly by the breeding pair when venturing to the floor of the
cage and especially by the young birds which hesitate to fly down to the
floor but walk down along the perch quite readily. All perches are of elder,
a wood which if chewed is not harmful.
It is obvious from the success I have experienced, that parrotlets will
breed quite readily in a roomy cage; indeed the Celestial Parrotlet Forpus
coelestis has been bred in a 4 ft box cage situated in a small kitchen
(Boorer 1964).
I have found a Budgerigar nest box placed on a side wall some 6 inches
from the roof of the cage (so as to allow the breeding pair to sit on the
top), to be acceptable.
Diet
Non-breeding birds appear to remain in good health if supplied with
small sunflower seeds, white millet, plain canary, spray millet, hemp and
groats. I supply all these items in separate dishes, not only to avoid wast-
age but also to give me an idea as to how much of each is being taken. For
a non-breeding pair, hemp is rationed to approximately one ounce per day.
Soaked seeds consisting of one part plain canary to two parts mixed
Budgerigar seed are supplied at all times.
Cuttlefish &amp;apos;bone 5 is supplied but very little appears to be taken other

than immediately prior to egg-laying, when the female may be seen to take
small amounts. Mineralised, oyster and limestone grit is available at all
times, but as far as I can tell, none is ever eaten.
Fruits such as grape, apple and pear have been offered but none has
ever been sampled. Lettuce is eaten, especially when young are in the nest
Fresh water for drinking is available at all times and water for bathing is
supplied every other day. However, my birds have never taken advantage
of the latter. The diet for birds with young is the same as the above, plus
brown bread soaked in milk. I find the latter is taken avidly especially
when the chicks are between one to twenty days old, after which con-
sumption drops until the bread is eventually ignored altogether.
I have found the consistency of the soaked bread to be most important.
If it is wet and soggy, the birds take very little, whereas bread which has
been soaked and then squeezed out almost dry, is taken avidly. The type
of bread used is also important; 'granary' being the favourite as this ap-
pears to remain more firm after soaking than some of the finer types such
as Hovis. New bread should never be used; I have found bread about three
days old to be best.
It is most noticeable that at certain periods when young are being
reared, no spray millet is eaten, yet is taken avidly when the birds are
not breeding. Soaked seeds are taken readily when young are being reared,
but only small amounts are eaten by non-breeding birds.
I have mentioned that I ration the amount of hemp seed supplied to
non-breeding birds. This seed is given ad lib. when young are being reared
and is also supplied to weaned youngsters for the first few weeks, after
which it is rationed.

Display and Mating
</subsubsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.998400833333333" page_id="56284146"  page_num="66" year="" vol="">
When displaying, the cock bird walks backwards and forwards along the
perch uttering a prolonged but chittering note. The wings are held slightly
open and away from the body, thus emphasising the rich colouring of the
flight feathers. Every so often the male opens the wings fully bringing
them up to meet over the back. During the whole procedure, the female
remains in one position (usually at the end of the display perch), appearing
to take little interest in the proceedings. Each time the male reaches the
female, he gives her a 'bop' with his beak (as does a Budgerigar). After the
display has been performed three or four times, the male will attempt to
mate with the female. During copulation, the male places the left foot on
the back of the female with the right foot gripping the perch. Immed-
iately copulation has been completed, the female may attempt to mount

the male by placing her right foot on his back, with the left foot gripping
the perch.
The actual act can take up to IV 2 minutes, during which time the birds
keep up a continual soft growling noise.
Male parrotlets have a definite song which is usually heard just before
the mating display commences and also when the female is incubating
or rearing young. In fact whenever the female of my pair is inside the
nest box, the male will be heard singing almost continuously. When sing-
ing the male often moves the head from side to side, bowing low as he
does so.
The male also has a threat display; it consists of the head being moved
from side to side in what can only be described as a writhing motion, with
the beak held slightly open. When the cause of the display has been re-
moved, the male will fly from perch to perch uttering loud (victory?)
calls as it does so. This display is used mainly during the breeding season
and is directed towards anyone who draws near to the cage.

Over a period of some thirteen months (with a rest period and a moult
in between) my pair produced eggs and young as follows:
September 1978: 5 eggs, 4 fertile. Chicks hatched and raised to indepen-
dence.
December, 1978: 5 eggs, 1 fertile, 4 clear. Allowed parent birds to rear
chick until it was some 30 days old when I put it down owing to it
having only one eye and, perhaps because of this, being unable to move
about other than in a complete circle.
June 1979: 5 eggs, 4 fertile. Two chicks died (or were killed) at four days
old. Remaining two reared to independence.
August 1979: 7 eggs, 3 fertile. Chicks hatched and reared to indepen-
dence.
October 1979: 5 eggs, all infertile.
Although both parent birds entered and inspected the nest box regu-
larly soon after it had been placed into position, only the female slept in
the box for the first few days. Once eggs had been laid, the female was
seen to leave the box only on very rare occasions and the male would also
spend much of his time in the box with her, including the night period.
When chicks hatched, the male spent the majority of his time either
taking food into the nest box or sitting 'on guard' outside the entrance
hole. It is difficult to be definite on this, but I feel that the male rarely
feeds the chicks while they are in the nest box, preferring to pass food to
the female (by regurgitation?) and she then feeds it to the chicks.
Once the young have left the nest box, the male appears to take over
the responsibility of feeding them (if they are fed at all that is - see later),
while the female prepares for another round.
Growth of Chicks
It appears that a clutch of five eggs is laid over a period of seven to
eight days. The first chick from such a clutch hatched within twenty days
of the first egg being laid. This does not mean that eggs take some twenty
days to hatch, as it is doubtful if the female would begin to incubate
immediately the first egg is laid. Low (1980) gives the incubation period
as varying between 18 to 23 days, but states that from observations in
the wild, it has been shown that the incubation period is in fact 17 days.
At birth the chicks are pink with a small amount of whitish down,
mainly on the head and back; the egg tooth is most pronounced. At nine

days the eyes are open and pin feathers appear on the body and wings.
At approximately 15 days, the skin becomes dark coloured and being
well feathered, the chicks can be sexed with ease. At 30 days of age, well
fed chicks will begin to leave the nest box and can be seen feeding from
the seed dishes almost immediately. By this time the female will have
begun to lay a further clutch.
When the first brood from my breeding pair left the nest box, they
were never seen to enter it again. Neither parent molested the chicks in
any way and the latter were removed from the breeding cage when 32
days old.
A later brood, once they had left the nest box, were on occasions
attacked by the male, usually when the female left the box for some
reason. I put this down to territorial instinct on the part of the male.
This particular brood was fed by both parent birds for a day or so after
fledging. No other chicks were seen to be fed after fledging.
I believe young parrotlets to be self sufficient the moment they
fledge and if bred in a cage, it is not doubt preferable to remove them
from the parent birds within a day or so whether one sees them feed or
not as to leave them could mean they may be attacked, especially by
the male.
Young males begin to sing at some 30 days of age. At this age the
song is much softer than that of an adult male.

The general behaviour of these birds, along with housing, feeding and
vocalisation, has been described in a previous article. The following will
be limited to notes on breeding, with reference to the above when neces-
sary.
Background
The birds were obtained in Britain in May, 1976. They got off to a
bad start with the cock attacking the hen in the carrying cage, during a
long car journey. This caused her to push through the bars, badly skin-
ning her face. Previously the birds had been together in a tropical aviary.
Arriving in Canada, they were put in a small outdoor aviary where the
hen got her revenge by beating up the cock. He later avenged this in-
dignity by keeping the hen from the food on a cold day in October. She
was found in the grass at 7 pm on 6th October, frozen stiff and barely
breathing. Hand-fed and heated to 30*C (86*F), she recovered by 10 that
night. They fought on and off all winter, being separated and put together
for varying spells. In February 1977, the hen was put in the conservatory
with a number of other birds. She immediately put the food off-limits to
the others, and was removed again.
Aviary space was scarce, especially for unlikely breeders. They were
put out in a small aviary on 6th June. In three days, the hen commenced
to build a nest, 1.8 m. (6 ft.) up in an upright trifurcation in a small Vine
Maple tree Acer circinatum . The nest side was covered with numerous
cedar and laurel branches that I had put there for extra cover. The aviary
was already occupied by a pair of Splendid Parakeets Neophema splendida
which were on eggs. The Splendid male kept the Chloropsis away from the
nest box, but otherwise there was no trouble.
The cock Chloropsis was by now singing from dawn till dusk. On
12th June he violently attacked the hen, and so was removed. The nest
was only half completed. Four days later the cock was returned, but the
nest was destroyed in the next week, probably by him. The Splendid
chicks had now hatched and the father was becoming truculent with the
intruders, so they were removed. By now all the aviaries were occupied
by nesting birds and that was that for the year, as far as the Chloropsis
were concerned. They began to fight seriously in November, so were

separated for the winter.
I was in despair about getting them together, and was unwilling to
devote an aviary solely to the pair, as all the other birds were nesting so
well. All the others were breeding at two pairs to an aviary. With the
limited space available, this doubling up meant a great saving in time
with regards to studies on the maximum number of species, as of course a
whole year is lost if a pair misses the short breeding season. So rather
reluctantly I tried to dispose of the Hardwicke's. Chloropsis cannot go to
just any old cage, and there was only one likely prospect. A millionaire
with a huge aviary made me an offer I could not refuse. He never came
back, and 1 heard later that they got him for tax evasion. The birds were
even offered free of charge to the New York Bronx Zoo, against a future
trade for Pittas. Fortunately they did not take me up on the offer, or I
would not be writing this now. They did however say my name would be
put on a waiting list for the Pittas, and as far as I know it still is. I have
not had much luck with zoos, apart from the local one, as regards trading
birds, or even exchanging information. The only out of town zoo ever to
do a trade was in Calgary, Alberta. Quite a few never accorded me the
courtesy of a reply. Perhaps the breeding of softbills is at the bottom of a
zoo's priority list.
So in spring of 1978, the hardwickei were put in a large aviary, along
with two pairs of aurifrons and some Mousebirds. The male soon comman-
deered the food table and he was removed, as usual. He was returned two
weeks later, and all the Chloropsis settled and had a great time flying
about. In July, the cock hardwickei began a premature moult which
continued until September. The Mousebirds were by now nesting, so all
the Chloropsis were put in the conservatory, where it was intended to
winter them outside of the house for the first time. Birds which winter
in the breeding aviary nest with higher frequency than birds put out in
the spring.
In September, after only two weeks in the greenhouse, the hen began to
line a wicker canary basket with horsehair. The weather had been sunny,
but it turned dull and cold, and the nest was left unfinished. At this time
the Hardwicke's shared the aviary with three male and two female aurifrons.
By the third week, the large sulphur-green male aurifrons was violently
attacking the other two males, but was not confronting the cock hard-
wickei, or vice-versa. This bird was removed, and a pair of Chestnut-
capped Laughing Thrushes Garrulax mitratus put in. A month later, the
number two aurifrons male began to cause trouble and was sent to the
zoo. This left a cock and two hen aurifrons , and the pair of hardwickei.

One of the coldest winters on record followed, and plants that had
survived six or seven winters died that year. Temperatures inside fell to
freezing on many nights. The birds all remained well and there was
no trouble until the spring. On 4th March 1979, the tamest hen aurifrons
was found bedraggled and very hungry. She was removed and boarded
with the light green male which had been taken out in the autumn. They
got on fairly well. This hen escaped in May, and was never seen again.
The remaining pair of aurifrons took over a thick honeysuckle vine in
which there was a wire canary basket. The hen sat in the basket a lot, and
was sometimes fed there by the cock. A bitter territorial battle was fought
between the two pairs of Chloropsis resulting in the aurifrons being
confined to the corner with the honeysuckle while the hardwickei ranged
over the rest of the area. The corner was partly shielded by a wire screen
to ward off any direct attacks by the cock Hardwicke's.
Meanwhile, the Garrulax went about their business, oblivious to the
trouble. On the same day that the screen was erected, the cock thrush
began to build a nest of grass in a clump of bamboo, at a height of 1.7 m.
(514 ft.).
These truly beautiful birds were a direct contrast to the Chloropsis in
habits. They were extremely affectionate and, even when not nesting,
spent all their spare time being nice to each other. When mealworms
were put in, the cock immediately took one to the hen, before he took
one for himself. The Chloropsis never indulged in such romantic beha-
viour. The hen Garrulax pitched in with the nest, and it was finished by
26th March. They only chased the Chloropsis off if they came down on
to the bamboo.
The aurifrons became very quiet and flew about close together, just
like cyanerpes. The hen began to take horsehair to the half-finished
hardwickei nest of the previous autumn. This was against the wall at a
height of 2.1 m. (7 ft.) in a creeping fig vine Ficus pumila repens , and
was close to the honeysuckle. The wire screen was removed as it now
served no purpose. At this time an automatic vent opener was fitted to
the roof. As the aurifrons looked like they might nest, the hardwickei
were removed to the small outside flight in which the hen had previously
built. This shuffling the birds around and removing the ones with the
poorest nesting prospects is standard practice. It is often rather compli-
cated, but has enabled five species to have been bred in each of the last
two seasons in only three aviaries. The other aviaries are used for non-

breeding birds and juveniles. Space has also to be left for emergencies, such
as the injured young Bald Eagle which was boarded for a while in the
spring. In fact, space requirement is directly related to incompatability and
is the only real drawback to keeping, and especially to breeding, softbills.
During April and the first half of May, the Hardwicke's were quite
amicable. In the greenhouse, the aurifrons did nothing further, but the
mitratus partly dismantled their nest and built another close by. Then
the hen mitratus dropped dead. She had always looked much less fit than
the male and was never as active. I do not get too attached to the multi-
tudes of birds that pass through, but I was upset by the breaking up of
this pair, especially with nesting imminent. A post- mortem revealed
nothing. The cock was more upset than I was, and went into a state of
near-shock for three weeks. He was removed from the aviary, and a pair
of newly acquired Silver-beaked Tanagers Rxarbo added.
A pleasant spring passed into a cold and windy June, and a unique
sight was seen in the garden. On a blustery day the Hardwicke's were
seen pressed together for the first and only time. Four days later, the
hen was seen displaying to the cock, by running back and forth on a
long branch, while carrying a long grass stem in her beak. The signifi-
cance of these events was not wasted on me, but a nestful of newly hat-
ched Shamas delayed any action being taken. The hardwickei were by now
looking rather rough, and the hen had head pin-feathers, but she was
still carrying grass a week later. So the pair was put into the conservatory
and the aurifrons removed, as they made no further progress. Courtship
for the Chloropsis, like that of Cyanerpes, consisted of the birds cutting
down quarrels to the minimum.
The hen hardwickei immediately began to gather grass on the day she
was put inside, and the cock began to sing tirelessly. The next morning,
the hen was sitting holding a hurt foot off the perch. She was fluffed up
and had a large wet patch on her right side, apparently from striking a
wet window. No doubt this happened from being chased by the male.
By noon she had recovered completely. The following day, the cock began
to attack the tanagers violently. They avoided injury be virtue of their
rapid flight - the fastest of any birds on the premises. They were removed
around midday. By that afternoon, on the 19th June, and after only three
days in the conservatory, the hen hardwickei was industriously building.
It was going to be a long busy summer.
Nests
Three nests were completed and used. Three others were started and
not finished for various reasons. Two of these have already been men-

tioned. The other incomplete one was built at the end of the 1979 season.
All were of identical construction.
As with all my birds, the widest possible range of building materials
was provided. This included feathers, cobweb and a variety of plants,
as well as synthetic products such as paper, string and artificial wools.
With the sole exception of some pieces of nylon filament in one nest,
the only materials used were dry grass and animal hair. The latter was
mostly horsehair, but some cowhair was also used.
Only the hen was involved in construction, with the cock following
her about while she gathered grass. He sat closely and watched the work
with great interest, just in the manner of the male C. cyaneus .
The first nest was built at a height of 1.7 m. (5 V 2 ft.) and only 1.25 m.
(4 ft.) from the dining room window. It was in the bamboo clump, and
this remarkable plant has been the nesting site for at least half a dozen
different birds. Many sites were investigated and when the bamboo was
chosen, the nest base was laid in an afternoon. The next day, the walls
were added, being made of rather fine dry grass, as was the base.
The work progressed slowly as the hen expended a great deal of time
and energy tugging at the nylon macrame hanger which held the feeding
tray. She succeeded in pulling some nylon into a fuzz, but could not get
if off, and she often hang upside down while tugging. When some of the
fuzz was cut off she ignored it, as she did also some similar natural fibres.
On the third day she began to line the nest with horsehair pulled from the
unfinished nest of the previous autumn. More horse and cowhair was
supplied in varying lengths and in three colours - black, white and red.
Those pieces about 18 cm. (7 in. ) long were most often used, but no
colour preference was noted, except perhaps that light hair was less,often
taken. Two or three pieces of fine nylon ribbon, unwound from nylon
string, were used in this nest only. One piece was used as a main support.
On the fourth day the nest was completed. It was built almost at the
top of the thick bushy plant, resting on a single thin hard stem that came
out at almost a right angle from a cane. The nest was anchored at one
place only on the rim to this single cane, by stems of dry grass and a piece
of nylon. The other main supports, about the middle of the walls, were
two tufts of leaves and their stems. This was a fine leaved bamboo, and the
leaf stems were thin, yet strong and pliable. They can be readily pulled
into a suitable position by binding with grass, etc. This tough but work-
able nature of the plant may be the attraction for the birds, and also they
may be familiar with it.
The finished nest consisted of a shallow grass cup with firm but open

lacework sides. There was a thick well- woven lining of horsehair, and the
whole thing was quite like the nest of Cyanerpes cyaneus in design and
proportions. It measured 6.5 cm. (2 5/8 in.) across inside and 9 cm. (3Vi
in.) across outside. The inside depth was only 3 cm. (114 in.) and the
total depth was 5 cm. (2 in.). This shallow structure meant that the
bird was sitting with about half the body in view, and the tail coming
straight out over the rim. This is in contrast, for example, with the Leio-
thrix, Pekin Robin, which has only the beak and the end of the tail sticking
out of the nest.
Later a second nest was built in the fig vine, at a height of 2.4 m.
(8 ft.) just above the canary basket containing last year's nest. The maxi-
mum available building height was almost 3 m. (10 ft.) The creeping fig
also has tough pliable leaf stems.
A third nest, and the last to be used, was a reconstruction of the first
nest, using lining from the second. All the nests were firmly made and
well fixed. In retrospect, it was seen that there was no danger of them
coming apart. However, as a precaution at the time, a packing of dry
grass was stuffed underneath each nest. The first nest had a hole of about
one cm. (3/8 in.) at the join of wall and base. Although there was no
danger of an egg falling through, the hole was plugged with fibre as an
insulating measure. The fibre used was the beautiful soft gold-auburn
inner coat from a tree fern. This was exactly the same colour and appear-
ance as the fuzzed nylon that the bird had tried to pull from the hanger,
yet it ignored this softer natural material. The hen did not gather grass
from the ground, nor did she like loose grass higher up. She preferred to
tug it out, and this is a natural means by which unsound or rotting mate-
rials are avoided. So bunches of grass and horsehair were jammed in cre-
vices and branches around the aviary. The hen did however use some
horsehair that was merely scattered over the plants.
Chloropsis probably all have similar habits. Certainly aurifrons and
hardwickei are identical, and I would expect that nesting would be the
same for all. Many books describe Chloropsis nests in identical terms, and
presumably the information came from a single original source. For
instance, the nests are commonly quoted as being suspended from branch
tips, and although plenty of such sites were available, they were not used
at all. With regards to nesting materials, what I think is erroneous is the
mention of twigs (and pine needles) and strangest of all, inner bark.
These dainty birds would find twigs far too coarse for a nest. The often
repeated "inner bark" must surely be a misidentification of material, or
perhaps the original nest described involved a misidentification of species.

Why on earth would a bird want to use inner bark, and how would it be
obtained? It would certainly be an impossible task for the weak bill and
small feet of a Chloropsis. I went to some trouble to make inner bark
available, and assorted outer bark too, but there was no interest shown in
any of it.
Eggs
During the nest construction, the food intake of the hen increased
greatly. She ate large quantities of rice pudding, some scrambled egg, and
all the soft insects that could be supplied. Nectar was scarcely touched.
The day after the first nest was finished, she ate her first mealworm,
but never touched them again afterwards. Both birds were now very
quiet and relaxed, but rather scruffy looking.
On 24th June, two days after the nest was finished, the first egg was
laid. It was large and very elongated. This first egg was dull off-white,
with very small, faint, diffuse spots at the big end, merging into a solid
patch right on the end. The spots and patch were a pale washed-out
terracotta colour. The hen continued to eat heavily and took two small
dragon-fly larvae which were barely covered with water in a small dish.
These were tried as an experiment, as sometimes aquatic live food is
readily obtainable under certain circumstances, and has not been exploited
as a rearing food by aviculturists. The next day a second egg was laid.
This had the same spots and patch, but there was the faintest wash of
terracotta over the whole egg. Four subsequent eggs looked like the
second egg, and the first was the only white one, as well as being the
longest and narrowest, at 24 mm. by 16 mm. The others averaged 23 mm.
by 17 mm. It was hot when the eggs were laid, and the hen was off a lot
on the first day. When the second egg was laid she sat tight. Inspection
from the window did not upset her, but she flushed when the aviary was
entered, although the nest was at the far end from the door. The cock
now fell silent and took up a vigil on a twig and only left it to feed. This
was exactly the behaviour of a male Cyanerpes cyaneus , the only differ-
ence being that the hardwickei sat as far away from the nest as possible.
He scarcely moved for the duration of the incubation.
When the first egg was 13 days old, it stood up in the nest at 45* on
its small end. The hen threw it out, and it was clear. The next day I
checked the remaining egg and it was dark. It was chipped around the
end and replaced. An hour later the hen became excited and stood up in
the nest chirping and quivering. She began to peck at the egg. The cock
left his perch and came to the nest for the first time since the eggs were

laid. He sat beside the hen and became equally excited. The hen chipped
out an almost fully developed dead chick. It was somewhat dehydrated
and weighed 1.6 g. Newly hatched chicks weigh about 1.8 g.
Four days later on 12th July, the hen began to build a new nest in the
creeping fig. Again it was well anchored, but had no bottom support and
was shored up with a bunch of grass as before. Although plenty of horse-
hair was supplied, the lining from the first nest was completely dismantled
and used for the second one. The cock recommenced singing, rapidly
but quietly, and had an occasional aggressive fit, but he was also seen to
feed the hen for the first time. In another four days an egg was laid,
followed by another the next morning. This was 22 days after the first
clutch was laid.
The same incubation pattern was repeated. This nest was just above
the aviary door and the hen came off whenever anyone walked past.
Fortunately it was very hot, around 32*C (90*F) at nest height, during
the day. A sheet of opaque plastic was put over the window adjacent
to the nest, and this kept the hen on the nest most of the time. The cock
kept his same silent vigil, but switched to the other end of the aviary,
so that again he was as far from the nest as possible. He also slept there,
but moved to the hen whenever she was off. The hen had by now cut her
food consumption, and in the heat was eating some grapes and little else.
On 30th July, on the fourteenth day, the first egg hatched. I am rather
phlegmatic about birds breeding now, but must admit to being excited
at the first nest, the first egg, and even more so at the first hatching,
although the high point was to come later. The chick weighed about 1.8 g,
was pink and downless, with a rather long neck and small head for its
size. There was no special gape colouring. The other egg hatched next day.
At each hatching, the cock came over and showed great interest and
excitement. He peered in at the chicks and could hardly wait to feed them.
The first chick was fed within two hours of hatching. Both parents took
food to the nest. The hen flew directly to the nest, whereas the cock
arrived by degrees, after looking about for a long time, again just like
Cyanerpes. The chicks were fed on small grasshoppers, spiders and wasp
grubs and pupae. A number of wasp nests had been collected and stored
in the refrigerator. The grubs will keep for about a week, while the pupae
will keep for up to several months. Once the cock was on the feeding
tray eating a grape; when the hen arrived he dropped the grape and gave
her a wasp grub, which she took to the chicks.
Although the nest was in a creeping fig, it was hidden by large passion
vine Passiflora leaves. A hole was cut in these and the adjacent window

was scrubbed inside and out. The plastic screen was folded back a little,
so that the nest was visible from the garden. A garden table was pulled to
a suitable spot and a garden bench was propped against it. The bench
served as a stand for heavy 12 x 50 binoculars. A Colius nest in an adjacent
aviary was similarly treated, and both nests could be observed from the
same spot. I then spent much of the next two weeks in the garden, putting
in a dawn to dusk shift on at least two occasions. The binoculars made
every small detail clear. The birds always landed on the same stem and fed
the chicks from the side and to the back of my field of view. Even from
the second day, I could see the chicks' heads above the rim of the nest.
This set up enabled me to see details that were not possible with nests
in other situations, even ones close to the window. The same applied to
the Colius nest. Fortunately the weather was hot and sunny throughout.
I had arranged holidays for this period, and I had great difficulty in
convincing my family that I was actually working while sitting there -
my meals were brought out to the table. Actually it was uncomfortable,
tiring and no fun, although I did get a sun tan.
The Chloropsis chicks would beg only for the parents, so the prospects
were poor for hand- feeding. Unlike any other chicks, they were also most
reluctant to beg for the parents, and often considerable time was spent
trying to coax them. Most chicks shoot up when a parent arrives with
food, but these chicks seldom did this right away. For the first three days
they were very shaky, and their heads wavered rather a lot, 45* from the
vertical. The parents were seen to follow these movements with the food
item and, when appropriate, it was inserted into the chicks' beaks only
slightly. The adult then supported the chick upright with the food item,
if large, or with the tip of its own beak, if the food item was small. The
chick then worked its gape around large food items, or pumped them back
if small. Feeding was a slow process and again there was a resemblance to
Cyanerpes here.
The parents macerated all the food well, but some rather large grass-
hoppers were fed by the cock. The chicks eventually swallowed these.
On the third day at the latest, the cock took rice pudding to the chicks,
and fed this thereafter. He himself was eating only rice and insects. The
hen at this stage switched solely to insects for herself (and the chicks),
and this pattern was kept up by both birds for three months, until nesting
was finished. Nectar was scarcely touched at all during this time, but they
took some currant juice, and left the currants.
The parents took far more food to the nest than was taken by the
chicks, so they usually ate it themselves, after spending much time prod-

ding the reluctant chicks. Occasionally they dumped the surplus food.
Both parents cleaned the nest, usually eating the droppings. The hen
always ate them. On some occasions, the cock carried them off, especially
when he had to eat unwanted food. This cleaning behaviour was highly
developed and the parents carefully removed or ate any food left on the
rim of the nest. With some birds this is a good way to get extra non-live
food into chicks, but it did not work with the Chloropsis. Any faeces
that were dropped on leaves below the nest were carefully cleaned off
by the adults. A faeces sac was deliberately put on a leaf about a metre
below the nest and the hen immediately came and removed all trace of it.
One chick went missing on the fifth or sixth day. Day one is the day
after hatching. It was not known which chick, and an extensive search
failed to find it. The remaining chick was the only one to be raised, but
the notes apply equally to the next brood, which reached eight and nine
days. At this time the chick's wing quills were well through, but unopened,
and its skin had become dark grey. For the record, it was presumed that
this was the second chick, based on eye opening, but there remains the
possibility that fledging times, etc. $re one day longer than stated. It is
likely that these times are correct, for they correlated with the second
brood for as far as they got.
On the fifth day, the remaining chick was heard to cheep for the first
time. It could only be heard from close by the nest. In succession it took
three wasp larvae from the hen, some rice from the cock, and another
larva from the hen. This was the most it was ever seen to eat at one time.
It should be noted that wasp grubs are an acquired taste and not all birds
will eat them at first, but most do so after a few days of trying. Birds
will take wasp pupae right away, and these were much preferred for
feeding the chick. Wasp larvae do not defaecate until they pupate, and
perhaps the waste material which collects for a week in the grubs is
distasteful.
Two interesting things were seen with the binoculars, which would
otherwise have been missed. When food was offered to the chick it usually
came up, but did not always gape right away. It was often seen to first
taste the food by sticking its tongue through the almost closed beak.
Then if the item was to its liking, it gaped and took it. This was later
confirmed at the nest when the chick was being hand-fed, and it continued
to taste food even after its eyes had opened. When the eyes were still
shut, it found the food by touch. The adults often endeavoured to get
the chick to beg by banging food on the chin area, then holding it there
for approval. The chick occasionally took food from me and it was given

some feeds of egg in milk, which were probably not necessary but certainly
did no harm. When I offered it a wasp grub once, it tasted it and promptly
went back down. When this was repeated immediately with a wasp pupa,
the chick tasted then ate it. It would be interesting to know what is fed to
the chicks in the wild, for they are so fussy. This tasting would no doubt
apply to some other species, but would be most difficult to check. On the
other hand, there are chicks which just about jump out of the nest and
take anything that is shoved down their throats.
The other observation also involved the tongue. It was hot throughout
the whole nestling period and the hen was off the chick quite a lot. She
would visit it frequently and touch it with her tongue. If it was getting
cold, she jumped on and brooded it. Checking temperature with the
tongue has been recorded for example in the Australian Malee Fowl
Leipoa ocellata.
Just about the time of hatching, a source of grasshoppers was dis-
covered. It was a warm summer with an early spring, and this had brought
these creatures to a size not usually seen until a month later in the normal
cool damp summers. They keep for two weeks or so indoors, in a fish
tank, and longer outside. They must be given fresh vegetation, and never
allowed to become stuffy or damp. It was better to replenish the supply
frequently. When the chick fledged, and with both parents eating the grass-
hoppers, I was hard pressed to supply enough. This entailed a half- day's
collecting at the weekend and two evenings during the week.
Collecting soon became streamlined with practice, and was aided by
two small children and a large dog. The dog flushed the hoppers and the
kids grabbed them, while I held a large plastic bag to receive them. A thick
rubber band around the top of the bag was a refinement. It was a less
efficient process to try to catch them by myself, as about half escaped
when the bag was opened, and de-legging them was the only, and slow,
way to avoid this. It was found that the grasshoppers have very definite
location preferences. They collect in dry south-facing hollows, or flat
areas with a protecting bank to the north side. They become sluggish
when the sun is not directly on them, and evening collections were easier.
The timing had to be just right, for if they became too sluggish, they did
not flush, and could not be spotted. Wet days were hopeless.
One collecting trip was made to the United States, where the insects
were, believe it or not, bigger and (presumably) better. Going abroad for
live food must be the ultimate in keeness. Actually the spot was only 24
miles away, and earlier I had travelled up to 35 miles in Canada to collect
some wasp nests. All the grasshoppers, including the American ones, had

a high rate of infestation with roundworms.
These were longer than the insects, being some 25 mm in a 20 mm.
grasshopper, and the insects often burst asunder with the pressure from
four or five worms. The grasshopper was probably the final host for the
parasite. At any rate they did not affect the birds in any way.
When the chick was six days old, it was noticed at 1 pm. that it was not
being fed. An unbroken watch was kept, and it was found that the chick
was not begging and that the parents were scarcely bringing any food.
It is not known if one problem was connected with the other, but I got
the impression that the parents were discouraged by lack of response
from the chick. In the following eight hours, until dusk, the cock fed the
chick four times and the hen twice. They both gave up by 5 p.m. I fed the
chick 10 times in the eight hours.
The parents also made three attempts at feeding, the hen doing this
twice, but the chick would not come up. In desperation I put the chick on
antibiotics (oral Cephalosporin and Sulpha-trimethoprim) when I heard
a click in its breathing at about 7.30 p.m. Later I thought this was due to
temporary choking on food, as it had almost gone in an hour. It was
breathing at 95/min. in a slow, quick quick, pattern. However, baby birds
breathe rather erratically like this, even after fledging. The timing did not
mean anything as it varies with species, and one needs a second chick to
compare. I decided that 95 was probably all right after I checked some
healthy Shama chicks, which were ticking over at more than 100/minute.
Although not feeding, the hen sat tight on the chick all the while, and
had to be chased off so that the chick could be fed. She went on at night
as usual, just as it was getting dark. Each night this was checked, as a pre-
cautionary measure. Antibiotics were discontinued.
The next day the nest was watched from 9 a.m. to 8.30 p.m. The cock
brought food twice, but the chick would not beg, so he ate the food him-
self. The hen did not bring food at all, but continued to brood the chick.
I hand fed the chick 36 times, averaging three feeds an hour.
The chick sometimes came up for me, but would not open its beak.
It was fed by prying open the beak with a toothpick and popping in the
food with another one. On this the seventh day, little green tufts burst out
of the wing quills. The following morning the parents were seen to feed
rather erratically, and this was supplemented with hourly hand-feeds.
An interesting thing came to light. In the morning, the chick was hand-
fed some cooked salmon for the first time. A little of this had been used as
supplementary feeding for Shama chicks, but no adult birds ate it. It was
reasoned that this rich, concentrated food would be good for

chicks, and, once swallowed, was just basically protein. This was not to
be, as far as Chloropsis are concerned. An hour and 15 minutes after
receiving the first salmon feed, which was fifty minutes after the second
one, the chick defaecated. The first part consisted of a normal sac, followed
by twice the volume of almost undigested salmon, with no sac around it.
The chick was given a feed of banana and rice. This was high in potassium,
and the theory was to counter excess sodium in the salmon. Shortly after-
wards, the chick ejected more undigested salmon. Either the oil or the
salt, or probably both, in the salmon was completely alien to the Chloro-
psis digestive system and therefore quickly rejected. The chick was all
right though, and was fed by me and the parents for the rest of the after-
noon.
The cock was extremely nervous and acting strangely. He once took up
a wasp larva and the chick begged immediately. The father put the food
into the chick's gape but withdrew it instantly, and flew off. He came back
right away and repeated the performance, and the chick got nothing.
Another time the cock gave the chick something which was too small to
identify and this was thought to be the only feed of fruit flies given. At
the nest the hen was seen to squeeze a wasp pupa and let the juice run
back down her throat. This was done several times, and in between she
pumped liquid into the gaping chick, with an obvious pumping action
of her throat. The amount of liquid in the larve could not account for
the amount of pumping and it was surmised that nectar (or currant juice)
was being fed also.
The chick was hand-fed at 3.25. Fifteen minutes later, during another
feed, it opened its eyes for the first time, then closed them again. It open-
ed its eyes for every feed thereafter that evening, closing them again when
fed.
On the ninth day, to my great relief, both parents were feeding
steadily, and for the first time, the chick sprang up for them and also for
me. Strangely, its eyes were tight shut, and remained so all day. It had not
cheeped since the fifth day, but resumed this now. One parent feeding
triggered off the other, and they always fed at the same time, one waiting
its turn very close by. The chick was stuffed with wasp larvae and grass-
hoppers, with the cock occasionally bringing rice. It was 31*C (88*F) at
the nest, and the chick sat with its neck stretched fully and its head
dangling over the rim. This was the same position adopted by Cyanerpes
chicks in the heat.
In spite of the ersatz feeding of the previous three days, the chick had
grown dramatically. On this day the droppings were no longer in a sac.

They came out very loose and looked bloodstained. This gave me quite a
shock, but a microscopic examination showed no blood at all, only reddish
fat globules. Grasshoppers were by this time the main food. The vegetation
eaten by them is transformed into a dark reddish brown juice. In addition,
a number of them had red markings on the body and legs. Evidently they
were quite lax&amp;apos;ative, and the "bloody diarrhoea" was a daily occurrence.
The parents had difficulty removing these loose droppings and usually
ate most of them, but the nest became stained on the bottom, and con-
sequently the chick too, during its final two days in the nest. There was
now about 14, hours of feeding light, and although some other food was
taken, the birds were going through 50 - 70 grasshoppers a day. These
had started off at 6 - 13 mm. QA - Vi in.) but were growing quickly in the
fields and were now 13 - 20 mm. (V 2 - 3 A in.) long.
On day eleven, the parents started to quarrel frequently and as I did not
think the chick was getting enough, hand-feeding was recommenced. In
the afternoon, it jumped from the nest when I went to feed it. It was
returned, and stayed there.
The following day, 12th June, the 12-day old chick voluntarily left the
nest at 6 p.m., fluttered about 1/3 m. (1 ft.) and crashed to the ground.
The parents fed it there, but it was put back in the nest later, and it rema-
ined there for the night. When picked up, it did not move or make a
sound, but the parents got very agitated. After searching the ground, they
relocated it and fed it, but the hen did not brood it that night. The chick
weighed 20 g., 55.5% of the average weight of both parents, and almost
the same percentage as a newly fledged Turdoides jardinei. At the time,
the mother weighed 33.5 g. and the father 38.4 g., the latter being the
heaviest of all the Chloropsis. The chick had a large head, well developed
wings and legs, and a disproportionately small body. The beak was slightly
curved, and quite firm.
The chick stayed in the nest until the following afternoon. When it
left, it was rather soiled on the legs, and its feathers were rather untidy and
soiled, but otherwise well formed. The tail had just burst out of the quills,
and the chick still could not fly. It was a plain green all over. The legs were
a bluish-tinged dark grey, and the nails silver, while the beak was black.
The chick was cleaned up with a wet tissue, photographed and sat on a
tomato plant, where it remained for the rest of the day.
At this stage, the parents showed signs of a rapidly developing problem.
They would still only feed together, but began to sit close by the begging
chick and hold food for up to 30 minutes before feeding. Sometimes they
would land beside it and take off with the food, while the chick clamoured

and begged. The hen was seen to carry grass and horsehair between these
bouts of feeding paranoia.
The chick was given a heavy hand-feeding last thing at night, as it was
obviously not being satisfied. On day 14, the adults were quarrelling
fiercely and the cock began to keep the hen from the food. The chick
was fed occasionally by either parent, but was largely kept going from
hand-feeding. The next day was the same, and obviously one or the other
parent had to go. After serious consideration, I removed the hen. The
result of this was quite dramatic, and fortunately beneficial. Within half
an hour the cock settled to feed the chick regularly. It got eight feeds
of rice in 10 minutes, although only one or two grains at a time, and he
was also giving it two consecutive grasshoppers per feed. The father had
scarcely used any wasp larvae before, and he now fed the chick solely
on rice and grasshoppers for the next 17 days, until it was removed. It
was decided to leave the father with the chick mainly because he would
feed rice, whereas the hen only used insects, which indeed was all she ate
herself. Also it is the natural course in most cases for the male
to be the main provider for fledged chicks. Another reason was the be-
haviour of the cock when the chick left the nest. When the nest was
examined, both parents were only slightly annoyed, and like all my
other birds, they soon became used to routine examinations. But after
the chick left the nest they became wildly agitated if anyone approached
it. Each and every time the chick was picked up, the picker was struck
with varying degrees of force by the cock. Once he knocked the chick
right out of my hand while inflicting a violent high speed stabbing attack
on me. The injury was scarcely noticeable, but it is of interest that this
bird is the only one to have physically struck me (except of course for
injured hawks, etc., in different circumstances.) The attacks were accom-
panied by explosive whistles. He usually just threatened when the chick
was approached, but he always struck if it was picked up. Mostly, the
offending hand was attacked, but on a few occasions, the head was the
target. The aggressive nature of the Chloropsis has to be admired for the
great courage that goes along with it, and I decided that the cock could
not fail to take care of the chick after such a performance.
The parents were so nervous of each other that this had disrupted the
feeding pattern at five days and again when the chick left the nest. It
was evident that this was the problem and not, for example, my presence
in the aviary. Much of the above observation was carried out surrep-
titiously from the garden or through the house windows, and the cock
later went smoothly about his business, even when I was present, as long

as I did not touch the chick.
Three days after leaving the nest,, at sixteen days old, the chick began
to move around a lot. It remained hidden and the green colour made it
difficult to see. It was seen to preen itself, and it took the odd feed from
me, whenever I was in the aviary. It took half hour naps during the day,
sometimes tucking its head in like the adults, and at other times simply
withdrawing the head to the shoulders. At night it carefully selected the
shelter of a large overhanging leaf. The cock did not sleep beside it. The
hen was now in a nearby aviary, and both adults called to each other all
day.
At 30 days the chick was flying the length of the conservatory, but
still made some landing errors. Its tail was well in by now. It still had
not been seen at the feeding tray. When it was 32 days old it was put out-
side with the hen and all four aurifrons. They all flew after it to have a
look, but none attempted to feed it, or harm it. The hen did not drive off
the aurifrons. It was later put in a large cage with its mother, who ate a
large grasshopper but made no move to feed the begging chick. The hen
was then put back with the cock. The chick gave a quiet but penetrating
double cheep when hungry. It was hand-fed for the rest of the day, and
photographed. It weighed 28.5 g., the hen being 33.5 g. The chick's wings,
tail and mantle were a fairly bright green, the contour feathers being a
softer green. There was the usual dark colour on the inside of the wing
primaries, but no other colours on the chick. The chick drank some milk
nectar when its beak was held into it. It had not been seen to drink before
this. The next day, to my excitement and great relief, the chick, at 33 days
old, was seen busily feeding itself. It ate banana, rice, wasp larvae and took
nectar. Probably it could have done so before, but not much earlier.
Things went smoothly with the chick, and on 8th September, at 39 days
it was heard singing quietly to itself. A month later, a few tiny blue
feathers appeared on its throat, and a few beige feathers on its lower
abdomen, at around 70 days. These colours gradually spread. The chick
was now fairly tame and would take a grape or grub from the fingers. It
would also sit on a hand long enough to be photographed. A further
month later, at 100 days, it had moulted completely into a beautiful
hen. The early singing was no indication of sex, and as noted earlier,
males and females are equally vociferous (this also applies to bulbuls).
As hardwickei is the most highly coloured Chloropsis, and as the
juvenile is plain green, it would be reasonable to surmise that the young
of all Chloropsis species would be plain green also.
The chick is doing well at the time of writing, and at four months

weighed 30.5 g., just short of the adult female weight. It is now a good
deal wilder from not being handled any more. It has lapsed into the
conservative feeding pattern of the adults, and subsists mainly on banana
and milk nectar.
Second Brood
When the hen was returned to the greenhouse on 1st September, she
began to eat heavily, and the next day she commenced to reline the
original nest. The grass cup was still intact in the bamboo, and it was
lined as before with horsehair, some taken from the last nest. The nest
was completed by 4th September. The cock could not wait, and he took
a grasshopper to the nest. He jumped in and sat there for 1 Vi minutes,
until the hen flushed him out. Some strands of lining were added by the
hen over the next three days, the cock again taking no part in the work.
On the ninth and tenth, two eggs were laid, both identical to the second
original one described previously.
The weather now became dull and cool. It had been hot and sunny
with no rain at all during the whole of the preceding nestings, and the
greenhouse had been sprayed frequently. The hen went on to the nest
when this was being done, and both adults bathed in the wet foliage.
Because of the rapidly falling temperatures and shortening daylight, a
vent was boarded up, and sunblinds were removed.
On 14th September, in spite of the automatic vent opener, a hot
sunny day put the temperature at nest level up to at least 43*C (110*F),
when the eggs were four and five days old. The eggs were probably at this
temperature for only a short time. In spite of the heat, they hatched. The
first chick came out at 14 days, on the morning of the 23rd, but the
second chick hatched at 3 p.m., at less than 13 Vi days. The morning was
dull and wet at 13*C (56*F), but it was sunny and had reached 27*C
(80*F) when the second chick hatched. On this first day the cock brooded
the chicks for l l /i minutes. This was the only difference from the last
nesting, and he continued to do so sporadically. He was usually on for
1 - 2 minutes, and vacated when the hen came back from eating, but
once he was on for 25 minutes. The adults always entered the nest from
the one direction. This was the back, or window side. The result was that,
although this nest was not particularly well hidden, the parents blocked
off a clear view of the nest. I actually got a better view of the last nest by
using the binoculars. The hen always sat on this nest facing away from the
house, and consequently always left in that direction, although the bam-
boo was in the middle of the aviary breadth. The entry and sitting position

<bodyText confidence="0.999529775" page_id="56284168"  page_num="88" year="" vol="">
was fixed on the other nests also and the Chloropsis did not turn around
when sitting, as many others have done.
Like most birds nesting here, the parents had improved with experi-
ence and were feeding like clockwork, with no bickering. A potential
problem was looming in that I had arranged to go on holiday in October,
and a bird-sitter had been engaged. It is of course impossible to attempt
holidays during the nesting season, and the family was on the point of
revolt as we had not been anywhere for years. In fact the last trip was to
collect the Chloropsis.
The feeding difference with this brood was that I had run out of wasp
larvae, and the grasshoppers had almost all died off because of the autumn,
and were very hard to find. At this season spiders are at their peak, and
several hundreds of very large orb, or cross, spiders Araneus diadematus
were collected. I got bitten several times by them and got shocked more
than pained. Some harvestmen ("daddy-long-legs") Phalangium spp. were
also supplied, and these were eaten by the adults, as well as used for
feeding the chicks. Some tiny (6 mm./!4 in.) meal moths were also used,
but larger moths were not even eaten by the adults. Then I found a comm-
ercial source of house crickets Acheta domestica. It was hoped that these
would be a solution to chick feeding problems. The crickets have large,
hard heads, so these were removed, at least for the chicks' sake. This is
of no consequence for the adult birds. For the record, I got bitten by a
cricket and it was a good deal harder than a spider bite. This is worth
keeping in mind whenever one has birds which are careless about breaking
insects up properly for chicks.
Suddenly, with no previous indication of distress, the youngest chick
died at noon on 1st October, in its eighth day. It was normal in appear-
ance with well developed feathers, and its eyes had just opened a little.
Nothing was found at autopsy, and its stomach was full of spider remains.
The next day the remaining chick died in my hand at 1 p.m. It had looked
well earlier in the morning. It had a cricket in its stomach and so, like
the other chick, it had fed up to the last minute. Both chicks were plump
and had given no sign of impending trouble. There was some suggestion,
from culturing the intestines, that the last chick might have had an infec-
tion. I should have taken heed of the first chick's death and put the other
one on antibiotics, even if it did not look ill. Antibiotics are about the
only recourse for a sick chick, especially for a sole remaining one. They
may or may not have contributed to the survival of tire present juvenile,
although it only received them for a short period, but they did no harm, and
I still have the bird. The next step is to put half a brood

on antibiotics prophylactically for a week, and give none to the other
half. This might give some interesting results, and not just with softbills.
One can do little to control bacteria that get into chicks with live food,
although of course the birds should be used to whatever comes with
insects. But mammalian gut bacteria are completely alien to most birds,
and yet captive birds harbour a variety of such organisms obtained from
their daily food. The picture is further complicated by the fact that the
adults were unaffected by anything, but of course it would take a lot
less of, say, an infectious agent, to affect a chick.
Epilogue
Eight days after the demise of the last chick, the hen began to build
again by reconstructing the nest in the creeping fig. Both adults were by
now moulting, and the hen had already dropped some wing feathers while
she was building. Even so, both birds looked fit and in as good feather as
at any time during the year. They were still quite friendly - for them -
and had not yet begun their customary winter brawling. The cock was
interested in the nest-building. Three days after this construction comm-
enced, the birds were brought indoors. It was now 13th October, and I
would not have been around for any chicks hatching, and the nights were
now long and quite cold. A friend offered to buy the birds, so they were
sent to Ontario. Thus ended a tumultuous relationship with that pair of
birds, after achieving one of my two major goals in aviculture - the other
one is to breed Garrulax. I was by this time physically, not to mention
mentally, exhausted by the activities of the 1979 season, and a wonder-
ful peace ensued when the Hardwicke's left. Even the aurifrons were
quiet, and the only trouble was the Hardwicke's chick (naturally) quarell-
ing with a shama chick. The peace was not to last, as my friend (perhaps
in revenge) sent me in return four Garrulax canorum Chinese Spectacled
Thrush. Each bird seemed intent on annihilating the others. All that
remains for 1979 is to tell of some strange happenings with shamas,
which also contributed to the excitement and anguish of that breeding
season.

BREEDING THE FLAME ROBIN IN CAPTIVITY

The Flame Robin Petroica phoenicea has a distribution in the eastern
states of Australia ranging from south-eastern Queensland, through New
South Wales and Victoria to south-eastern South Australia. It is also found
on Kangaroo Island, the islands of Bass Strait and is numerous on Tas-
mania. Like most of the Australian Petroica "Robins" it feeds mainly
on the ground, and in winter can often be seen feeding in flocks in open
grassland or grazing paddocks. During the spring and summer the sexes
pair off and locate themselves within the heavy timber areas along river
and creek beds where breeding occurs, usually between August and Feb-
ruary.
In this pretty flycatcher, males are slate-coloured above with a white
diamond shaped area on the forehead; white stripe on wings, while chin,
eyes and legs are black. Throat, breast and upper belly, orange red; rem-
ainder of underparts white. Females are brown in colour with white spot
on forehead. Older females sometimes have an orange wash on the breast.
Immatures resemble the female but have buff markings around the facial
area, and are sometimes smaller in size.
In April 1978, two keepers and I collected two pairs of Flame Robins,
along with other species of birds for the Taronga Zoo. These
were mist-netted within the Blue Mountain district, west of Sydney,
under permit issued by the National Parks and Wildlife Service of N.S.W.
These permits restrict the number of a given species collected to two
pairs within the state of N.S.W. and does not include birds designated
rare.
We have found that Petroica Robins often have coccidia infections
so they were given a precautionary quarantine period of 30 days, after
which they were split into two pairs and placed in separate aviaries, each
planted to form a different environment; one as heath land while the
other was landscaped as desert.
Within a period of six months we had lost the male from the desert
environment cage, but the other pair continued to thrive The aviary
in which these are housed is round with an approximate circumference
of eight metres and height of two metres, and is furnished with various
types of native vegetation, ie. Tea-Tree Melaleuca armillaris and the
Wattle Acacia longifolia, tussocks and the usual dead stumps. Running

water is always available. Other birds located in this cage were a pair of
Red-crested Cardinals, Stubble Quail and one each of Brown, Yellow-
faced and White-naped Honeyeaters.
Within the month of November, 1978, both birds were observed
building a cup-shaped nest in the Melaleuca shrub, close to the wire and
in full view of the public. On noticing this various materials were pro-
vided; these included the filling from an old bed mattress, coconut fibre,
lengths of cotton and hair. Natural materials found within the aviary
included strips of bark and grass and when the nest was complete, the
cup was lined with spider webs and feathers. Nest-building took approxi-
mately one week and on 3rd of December, the female was found to be
incubating three eggs, the colour of which varied from pale blue to pale
green, spotted and blotched with shades of a purple-grey.
Incubation is carried out by the female only, with the male feeding
her regularly. The incubation period was 16 days, so on the sixteenth
day two young hatched. These, however, only survived for three days;
the reason, we believe, was that there was not enough food available.
The female did not return to the nest.
The following season the birds were again observed carrying building
material to approximately the same area as the previous season. On 22nd
August, the female laid her first egg, and by the 24th had laid two more
to complete the clutch. During incubation the male continued to feed
the hen on the nest. On noticing two young in the nest on 7th September,
the bird-keeping staff began providing not only their regular food, an
egg-cake mixture made of sponge cake, minced egg yolk, cheese, fly
pupae and added vitamin powder, but additional live food in the form of
termites (white ants), mealworms and fly pupae. The parents also had
access to various types of fruit (banana, paw paw, grapes, orange and
pear) and the honey mixture fed to the honey-eaters, all of which they
had been seen sampling at one time or another.
One young was lost, later found dead on the aviary floor; lack of
calcium was considered the cause of its death. The other young was
successfully raised, leaving the nest on 24th September, but was later
observed being attacked by other birds in the aviary. On the recommend-
ation of Les Clayton, the Head Bird Keeper, it was placed in a small
holding cage at the back of the aviary, where the parents continued to
feed it through the wire, with the male doing the bulk of the work. After
a period of two weeks, the youngster was able to feed itself and was
released back into the aviary proper.
During this time, the female had returned to the same nest laying

another three eggs. Before hatching, the first young was again removed
when it was observed interfering with the adults' activites. By the 12th
October, three young birds had hatched and by the 31st we had success-
fully raised the three, this time with no trouble from other birds. At the
time of writing (mid-September) two more have been reared and it is beli-
eved that the account above records the first occasion this species has been
bred in captivity.

and to a slight degree in lineola but less in the other species.

<listItem confidence="0.983730444444444" page_id="56284172"  page_num="92" year="" vol="">
1. One of the best known of these is the common Barred Parakeet
Bolborhynchus lineola, which has two subspecies Bolborhynchus lineola
lineola and Bolborhynchus lineola tigrinus. It is a rather short thick-set
bird with comparatively long wings and a short tail, which can be spread
out like a fan especially if the bird is afraid.
2. Also well-known is the charming Sierra Parakeet Bolborhynchus ay-
mara. In contrast to the Barred Parakeet, it is a very slender bird with
long wings and a long graduated tail.
3. The Mountain Parakeet Bolborhynchus aurifrons has four subspecies

Descriptions
1. The Barred Parakeet B. I lineola comes from Central America, from
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.971931315789474" page_id="56284173"  page_num="93" year="" vol="">
south Mexico as far as west Panama. Several years ago a small group of the
subspecies B. 1. tigrinus from Colombia and central Peru was imported into
Europe. This subspecies differs from B. 1. lineola being a darker shade of
green with longer and thicker stripes. A cross between these two species
will produce young which will be difficult to classify and to sex. A cross
between a male B. 1. lineola (with fine stripes) and a female B. 1. tigrinus
(with thicker stripes) may produce a son with fine stripes and daughter
with thicker stripes, but the son cannot be called a pure lineola nor the
daughter a pure tigrinus. Such cross-breeds should be avoided where
possible.
2. The Sierra Parakeet B. aymara is the only Bolborhynchus coming
from the eastern slopes of the Andes, in central Bolivia and north-west
Argentina. As imports from these countries into Europe are difficult or
impossible, these birds are rarely offered for sale as newly-imported birds.
The Sierra Parakeet is about 20 cm. in length. As a young bird it is almost
completely green, the back being a shade darker and the abdomen a shade
lighter. On the head the feathers are greyish. After the moult the back
remains green, the underparts becoming lighter green. The throat and
breast, and sometimes between the legs, become grey, the head a dark
grey-brown. The legs and bill of a younger bird and of the hen are dark
grey. After the moult, the legs and bill of the cock become brighter in
colour, while the eyes of a mature cock are darker than those of the hen.
3. The Mountain Parakeet B. aurifrons comes from the western slopes
and the higher parts of the Andes in Bolivia, Chile and Argentina. As with
the Sierra Parakeet, imports of these birds are few, and they are not very
common in collections. The Mountain Parakeet is about 18 cm. long. With
their longer wings and longer tail they resemble the Sierra Parakeet in
silhouette.
3.a. The B. a. aurifrons is a bright green bird with a bright yellow forehead
and bright yellow around the bill and on its chin, sometimes even down to
the throat. A bright yellow patch on its sides stands out very distinctly
against the wings. Sometimes the abdomen is also yellowish, but is more
usually light green with yellow patches. The hen has almost no yellow, and
its light green colouring with just a haze of yellow leads to confusion with
B. a. robertsi. The B. a. aurifrons can, however, be distinguished by its
yellow legs with just a black tinge.
3.b. The B. a. robertsi is of a broader build than aurifrons. The girth of
aurifrons is about 8.7 cm, and that of the robertsi respectively 9.4 and

9.6 for the hen and cock. Its feathers are a beautiful bright green with
hardly any yellow. The cock has black legs and a yellowish bill and the hen
has black legs and a dark bill.
3.c. The B. a. margarithae is the most broadly built bird of these sub-
species. The girth of its breast is 9.7 - 10 cm. The colour is a dull, dark
green. The bill and legs of the cock are of a lighter colour than those of the
other subspecies. This bird has a somewhat shorter tail, which makes it
appear even more broad. Formerly this bird was called Bolborhynchus
aurifrons orbignesius which was changed into B. a. margarithae. This
change of the Latin name led to a great deal of misunderstanding with
another species of Bolborhynchus , the Andean Parakeet B. orbignesius
(formerly B. andicola ). An example of this confusion is that the first
breeding of the Andean Parakeet in Denmark proved to be B. a. marga-
rithae instead of B. orbignesius.
3. d. The B. a. rubrirostris comes from north-east Argentina. The mature
cock has a redish horn-coloured bill and the hen a dark grey horn-coloured
bill. The legs of the cock are lighter than those of the hen. This subspecies
has a dark blue-green back and a brighter, blue-grey front and abdomen.
The bigger girth of the breast gives this bird a compact appearance.
Imported birds of the species B. aurifrons , originating from the higher
mountains where the atmospheric pressure is very low, have difficulty
in acclimatizing to the higher pressures in Europe, and often have prob-
lems with their lungs. My experience is that only young birds in a very
good condition can survive the stresses of transport and adapt to diff-
erent living conditions. Breeding these very charming birds deserves
all our attention in the hope that we will obtain a generation more adapted
to circumstances in Europe.
I have all the species and subspecies of the Barred, Sierra and Mountain
Parakeets in my possession, so I am able to observe very closely the diff-
erences in the subspecies and in the sexes. I have studied the skins of these
birds in several Natural History Museums, such as Tring, Leiden, etc, but
as these skins are up to a century old, it has proved rather difficult to
observe from them the minute differences in colour of the bills and
legs as these colours have faded away or changed. The only way to see
these differences is in the observation of live birds.
4. and 5. The last two species, the Andean Parakeet B. orbignesius (for-
merly andicollis ) and the Rufous-fronted Parakeet B. ferrugineifrons have
not been imported into the Netherlands for some years. B. orbignesius
comes from the higher parts and western slopes of the Andes in west Peru

and Bolivia. B. ferrugineifrom comes from the central high mountains of
the Andes in Colombia. Both species are plain dark green. The Rufous-
fronted has a darker bill and a reddish band on the forehead. The Andean
is a bit smaller and has a light grey bill.
Breeding the Mountain Parakeet
There has been more written about the breeding of the Sierra Parakeet,
probably because it is fairly straightforward to breed, and is very easy
to please. It is satisfied with all kinds of breeding logs, even Agapornis
breeding logs, and is a good breeder and trustworthy parent. Up to six
birds may be reared in one clutch, twice a year in some cases.
This is not the case for the Mountain Parakeets; out of an import of
100 birds, very few will survive, and in some cases one will be lucky if
a single pair is left. Even changes in the weather, accompanied by a
change in atmospheric pressure, may cause previously healthy-looking
birds to pine away quickly. In the one, or more usually two years it
takes to bring imported birds up to breeding condition, the stress caused
by these changes in the weather is considerable.
In 1977 I bought five pairs of the bluish Mountain Parakeet B. a.
rubrirostris. In spring 1978 I had only one cock and two hens left. One
day I saw one of the hens dive into a nest-log. After some time it came
out again, and was fed by the cock. I had provided several different
breeding-logs, for Budgerigars, Agapornis , lories, Neophemas and Cocka-
tiels. The hen selected the Agapornis log. Several days after I had seen
them feeding each other, I looked in the nest-log. The nest was complete;
some mould and chips stamped to a well-formed depression. I resolved to
wait several days and when I had not seen the hen for the whole day, I
again looked at the nest. There, unfortunately, I found the hen dead,
egg-bound with two eggs beneath it.
The two eggs were removed and I stored them on a layer of sand to
keep them until I had another bird breeding. This sand is sieved and
heated in an oven to disinfect it. This I often do with eggs of one clutch
to ensure that the chicks hatch at the same time and so to prevent smaller
chicks from being trampled by the bigger ones. In such a way, turning
the eggs every day, one can keep them fresh much longer. After about
one week I put the eggs in an incubator.
The death of the laying hen was a big disappointment, but I became
hopeful again when I saw that the second hen was willing to take its place.
I had already noticed that every time the first hen sat on the nest, the
second made advances towards the cock. He was not aggressive towards

the second hen, but had paid little attention to it. Now, however, the
cock became more attentive. Within ten days the second hen laid its
first egg, and went on to lay five altogether. The hen did not seem very
conscientious, and as these Mountain Parakeets were housed with other
birds I did not dare to take risks any longer, and decided to put the
eggs under another bird. The only bird that could be considered must
be a bird of about the same size and which was at the same stage of
breeding. The only bird suitable was an Elegant Parrot. A pair of these
Elegants were given the two eggs of the first clutch, together with the
five from the second hen, giving them a total of seven to hatch. Two
chicks were hatched from the first two eggs, followed fourteen days later
by four more. The problem facing me was that the incubation period for
the Elegant Parrot is a week shorter than that of the Mountain Parakeet,
and the young are fed for a shorter length of time. Would such a bird feed
these different young properly? Besides this, the difference between the
first and the sixth young was sixteen days. For fourteen days, all went
well; the eldest chick was about thirty days old, the age at which a normal
Elegant ought to leave the nest. After this, however, the foster parents did
not seem to feed the young ones so well. It seemed as if the foster parents
were disconcerted by the failure of the chicks to grow in size, and there-
fore ceased to feed them. Not daring to take further risks, I gave the young
birds one by one to another pair of Elegant Parrots. This pair had younger
chicks of about the same size as the young Bolborhynchus. I divided these
young Elegants between other pairs of Elegants.
Two days after the removal I found the youngest one dead. I decided
that the parakeets needed more food, so I started to give the elder two
young Mountain Parakeets extra feeding. This enabled the new foster
parents to cope with the younger Bolborhynchus. After seven weeks the
eldest parakeet peeped out of the nest-log and on the 53rd day it flew
out. The two elder birds thrived, but the others, not doing quite so well,
did not fly out until the 56th day.
The Bolborhynchus hen started nesting again after the removal of the
first clutch. This time she laid four eggs; she hatched and raised them
herself, and the result was three young parakeets. I hope eventually to
breed from these B. a. rubrirostris.
Breeding the Bolborhynchus species is well worthwhile. The breeding
described above took place in an open outside aviary. My experience with
all the Bolborhynchus species is that breeding is much simpler in outside
aviaries; for example, my Barred Parakeets did not breed very well in
inside aviaries of all kinds, but since being moved to a more open, outside

aviary, they have bred almost continuously.
The Bolborhynchus species are charming, small agile birds, always
chirping softly. They go into their nest-logs before dusk and stay there
overnight. This is very important in the winter, when there is always the
possibility that their toes might freeze.This shelter also prevents them from
catching cold during misty and rainy autumn days.
The Bolborhynchus feed on a mixture of seeds - no millet - and
like fruit and vegetables of all kinds.
In addition to this, the Barred Parakeet likes some sunflower seed,
the Sierra Parakeet likes hemp, and the Mountain Parakeet likes weed-
seeds.
After two years of observation of these living birds, I have come to the
conclusion that B. a, rubrirostris has more in common with B. aymara
than with B. a. aurifrons , in a number of ways. Their place of origin in north-
west Argentina, their behaviour, outward appearance (both species have
greyish-blue in their feathers) and even their choice of food is very similar.
The rubrirostris , like the aymara , eats mainly seeds, with some fruit and
vegetables, while the other aurifrons subspecies prefer vegetables, fol-
lowed by fruit and some seed. 1 think that B. -a. rubrirostris is related
more closely to B . aymara than has been previously thought.

The Olive Thrush is a widespread species over the African continent,
south of the Sahara. Inhabiting forests and well-wooded areas near cultiva-
tion, it has become common in urban areas where it is often seen searching
among debris and leaves for insects and digging for earthworms on lawns.
Sexes are alike in coloration being a dark olive-brown above. The chin
and throat are whitish, streaked with brown; chest and breast a dusky
olive, shading to orange-rufous on belly and flanks. The bill is a yellowish
orange while the legs are yellow-brown.
On 12th October 1980, two Olive Thrushes were purchased from a dea-
ler, though not guaranteed to be a pair. They were released into our Tropi-
cal House, after spending a period of time in our hospital under close ob-
servation.
I had not expected to see any possible signs of breeding until spring
1981 but it is easy to underestimate one's charges. I soon found that
they were a true pair and within ten days the cock was singing in true
thrush fashion, not as loudly as our Song Thrush but sweeter, perhaps
with not so many notes.
On 1st December the hen was busily building a nest and on 11th Dec-
ember she was sitting on three eggs amongst a canopy of Passiflora about
10 feet from the ground.
On Christmas Day, there were three young thrushes, doing very well,
and on 1st January 1981 the young birds were hopping about the Tropi-
cal House. We picked them up and placed them In our hospital where
they were hand-fed for two days but at the time of writing (8th January)
they are self-supporting.
The hen is sitting again in a different position in the Tropical House.
The Olive Thrush was first reared in Britain in 1924. An account of the
breeding by W. Shore-Baily is recorded in the Avicultural Magazine (1924,
255-256) and is accompanied by a photograph of the young in the nest.

SPROUTING SEED TO PROVIDE A CONSTANT SOURCE
OF FRESH AND NUTRITIOUS FOOD FOR PARROTS
AND OTHER CAPTIVE BIRDS
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.989982411764706" page_id="56284179"  page_num="99" year="" vol="">
By ARTHUR FREUD (Smithtown, New York, U.S.A.)
Parrots are traditionally fed a variety of dry seeds as their basic diet. In
the wild, these birds do consume a certain amount of mature seeds but a
much larger component of their diet consists of vegetables, fruits, and
seedlings in their early stages of development. As a matter of fact, parrot
competition with man for the rewards of his agriculture has created
enmity between farmers and parrots wherever both exist in large numbers.
Many individuals who keep parrots make an effort to supply fruits
and vegetables to their birds but this is frequently done as an afterthought
with seeds being considered the mainstay of the parrot diet. Seasonal
variations in the availability of fresh fruits and vegetables also tend to
cause them to be fed in a rather sporadic manner.
Many breeders increase the amount of vegetable products which they
feed parent birds as parrots require this type of food for their young.
Sprouted seeds are an ideal choice for parrots who are feeding their
young as they are moist as well as rich in nutrients. By sprouting seeds in
the home, we can provide an inexpensive and unlimited supply of fresh
and nutritious plant products in a form which parrots find extremely
attractive. The seedlings produced by sprouting are very close in food
content and physical structure to the plant products which parrots select
when they are free to choose their own diet. The knowledge that seeds
could be sprouted and converted into a fresh and nutritious vegetable is
ancient and sprouted seeds have long been a component of Oriental
cooking. Individuals interested in natural foods have also been proponents
of sprouts for many years.
When you sprout seeds in your home, it is no different (with one
exception) than the natural sprouting which occurs when seeds are planted
in the earth and watered. The exception is that in the technique which
we will describe the seeds are generally deprived of light so that leaf
growth is discouraged and the growing energy of the young plant is dir-
ected mainly to the growth of the vitamin rich stem. The stem is also
tastier and aesthetically more interesting to chew than the leaves as it pro-
vides a crisp, crunchy texture which leaves do not offer. As a sprout
grows in darkness, one can note a spectacular increase in vitamin content.

A. FREUD - SPROUTING SEED
Oats which normally contain about ten milligrams of vitamin C in 100
grams have a fourfold vitamin C increase in five days of sprouting. Peas
do not have a measureable vitamin C content when they are dry. Four
days of sprouting yields 86 milligrams of vitamin C per 100 gram serving.
Soya beans which are a sprouter's favourite, become so rich in vitamin C
after sprouting that a serving of 100 grams (4 oz) can provide approxi-
mately the daily vitamin C requirement for an adult. Other vitamins show
comparable increases. Sprouted seeds also are rich in minerals and since
their fat and carbohydrate content is low, they are ideal foods for captive
parrots who do not get as much exercise as they should.
Before attempting to sprout seeds, you must realize that one cannot
sprout just any seed. Since you are attempting to produce a living plant,
you must sprout only fresh, live, healthy seeds. Frequently, seeds are
treated with chemicals to prevent sprouting during storage and obviously
such seeds would not be selected. One should, of course, avoid any seeds
which have been chemically treated to prevent mildew as these chemicals
are poisonous. Ideally the seeds you choose should be from a current
harvest as these will give you the highest percentage of germination. You
might compare your choice of seeds with the manner in which one chooses
grass seed for the lawn. A good source of fresh, viable seeds would be a
health food store. Let them know why you want the seeds and they may
be able to give you some good advice and suggestions.
Sprouting is a very simple technique. I would recommend starting
with a quart jar which has a wide-mouthed opening. You will also need
some rust-proof screening or cheesecloth which can be kept around the
mouth of the jar during part of the sprouting process. Some food stores
sell a mason jar with an open cover and stainless steel screen that fits
within the cover. These are ideal and you may also be able to get an
assortment of seeds at the same time as you buy the jar. In addition to
the seeds already mentioned, others which can be sprouted include ;mung
beans, azuki beans, lentils, alfalfa, almonds, barley, buckwheat, chick peas,
red clover, millet, rye and radish. The sweet fresh taste of these sprouts
will amaze you. Some, such as the radish, are "hot" but this makes them
a particular favourite of parrots whose sense of taste is rather limited.
Place about two tablespoons full of seeds (either a single variety or a
mixture) in your jar and after rinsing them to remove any debris, fill the
jar with tepid water and place it in an upright position in a warm place.
At this point the mesh screen is on and it should remain on until your
seeds have completed sprouting. A good location for these first and later
steps would be the warm oil burner room of your home or a cabinet

near the stove in your kitchen. During the overnight soaking period, the
seeds will begin to swell as they absorb moisture. After about 18 hours
you will find that some seeds have actually begun to sprout. At this
point, drain the water and rinse three or four times using a moderately
heavy flow of water to ensure that all seeds are rinsed. The water can be
emptied out through the screen and no seeds will be lost. Drain all water
so that the seeds are left moist (not soaking) and replace the jar in the
warm location. This time it should be kept on its side so that the seeds
can be spread out and the jar covered with a cloth to keep light from the
seeds. The end of the jar with the screen should not be covered to provide
a free movement of air in and out of the jar. Try to perform this rinsing
procedure several times during the second day. If you are normally not at
home during the day, it could be done once in the morning and once or
twice in the evening. The same procedure should be followed for the third
day. By now you will be amazed to see some fairly advanced growth on
the part of many of the seeds. Others will grow more slowly and a small
percentage will not grow at all. Remember, keep rinsing and draining well
and when replacing the jar, turn it several times so that the seedlings are
scattered around it so that air can reach them. On the fourth and final
day of growth, you must go through the same rinsing and draining pro-
cedures. Some people also like to spread the seedlings on a paper towel
at this point and remove any large, coarse and inedible hulls or unsprouted
seeds. One can also place the young plants in indirect sunlight at this point
for an hour or two. This brief exposure to the sun will give the sprouts
a touch of green as photosynthesis will begin when the seedlings are in
the presence of light.
The seeds are now ready and may be given to the parrots. After a final
rinse and draining the sprouted seeds can be replaced in their original
jar but instead of the screen the jar should be closed with its regular
cover. The sprouts will retain their crisp, fresh nature for several days if
refrigerated.
Some individuals have been very successful in sprouting the same
seeds which they feed to their parrots. Others have found poor results
with these seeds as they have apparently been treated with a sprouting
inhibitor. My own recommemdation is that seeds for sprouting be pur-
chased from a health food store. An interesting technique which I have
been told about involves blending the sprouted seeds with a peanut butter
maker or a food processor. The soft paste which is produced in this man-
ner is excellent for handfeeding baby birds or birds which are ill or other-
wise off their feed. When sprouts are used as part of the normal feeding

procedure, I would recommend that 20 or 30 sprouts be provided in the
morning. They may be placed on top of the seeds in the seed dish without
ill effect. As a matter of fact, they frequently stimulate the appetite and
will encourage parrots to eat additional seeds. Give this nutritious, healthy
and tasty food source a try. Both you and the inhabitants of your aviary
will be pleased.

1920 - YEAR OF CRISIS
</sectionHeader>

By F.C. BARNICOAT (Cleveland, South Africa)
All 86 volumes of the Avicultural Magazine make exceedingly interes-
ting reading if one is lucky enough to lay hands on them. I have always
found the volume for 1920 - the year in which the Society was struck by
one crippling blow after another - particularly moving.
It began with an issue edged in black. Rosie Alderson was dead. She
had been a remarkably successful Secretary through the dark years of the
First World War and had the happy knack of seeming always able to sug-
gest just what was needed for the advancement of the Society, whose wel-
fare she had so much at heart. She was a member from 1896 onwards and
a first-rate aviculturist, who concentrated on the dove family. Her love for
her birds as individuals and concern for their welfare shines through the
articles she wrote from time to time for th q Avicultural Magazine and her
instructive and charming book, My Foreign Doves and Pigeons , dedicated
to her mother and the numerous bird friends she had made throughout
the world. Her kindly helpfulness extended to her fellow human beings, a
good example being the offer to look after the birds of anyone who was
away at the war. She was present at the Society's Silver Jubilee garden
party held at the Fondon Zoo in June 1919, but in November she was
suddenly forced to resign the secretaryship and a notice appeared in the
Magazine expressing sympathy with her on her very serious illness. The
loss of Miss Alderson - the first of several great women servants of the
Society - left a sad void as 1920 began.
A member came forward so willingly to take on the secretaryship, and
surely there could have been no one with greater enthusiasm or promise
for that exacting role than Dr. L. Fovell-Keays. He was a comparative
newcomer, having started his collection in the spring of 1913 and joined
both the Foreign Bird Club and Avicultural Society, for both of whose
magazines he was soon a prodigious writer in a distinctive and interes-
ting style. His keen intellect, trained to observance in the medical pro-
fession, was brought to bear on the 500 or so occupants of his aviaries,
which received his personal care with meticulous attention to detail, so
that his few years of practical aviculture saw numerous breedings, e.g.
Bearded Reedling, Zosterops, Cactus Conure. But very soon the war
started and as a doctor he felt obliged to enlist. His home and collection

were sold in 1916. His zeal, geniality and comradeship were much missed
and a special note of rejoicing at his safe return and restoration to health
after arduous and perilous war service appears in the AviculturalMagazine
of September 1919. He settled in Guildford and started to rebuild his
aviaries. In March 1920 he agreed to take on the treasurership in addition
to the secretaryship of the Avicultural Society, Alfred Ezra having had to
resign as Treasurer through pressure of work. Alas, Lovell-Keays was a
star-crossed aviculturist: in April his health suddenly gave way from the
after effects of his war service, necessitating complete retirement from
work of every description, and he died on 14th May at the age of 44.
The membership of the Avicultural Society had great depth and quality
in those days: for the second time within a year a new Secretary/Treas-
urer was found, no less a person than John Lewis Bonhote, virtually a
foundation member and former efficient Editor.
The February issue also bears a black border, now to mark the passing
of the famous president of 25 years' standing, Lord Sherborne, better
known as the Hon. and Rev. Canon F.G. Dutton. In contrast to Lovell-
Keays he died at a great age. Born as early as 1830, he became one of the
greatest figures of aviculture in the Victorian age. During his lengthy ex-
perience starting in his Oxford days, he was said to have kept more species
of the parrot family than any other aviculturist of his time, in cages, avia-
ries and at liberty, especially during his many years at the beautiful vicar-
age at Bibury. His articles and notes were quite a feature of the early issues
of th q Avicultural Magazine and Bird Notes , as well as in Dr. W.T. Greene's
classic work , Parrots in Captivity , and described his own experience with
such rarities as a pair of Paradise Parrakeets (burrowing into a wall to
nest), Horned and Red Shining Parrakeets. He continued to write until
well into his eighties, his last short article on his breedings for the year
appearing in 1913, though he was still to write letters of apology for
non-attendance at Council meetings.
Increasing frailty obliged Canon Dutton to give up his parish and move
to a small city house in 1917. He took with him his pet St. Lucia Ama-
zon Parrot - rara avis to be sure - whose splendid condition was the result
of enjoying complete liberty daily in a large garden. This was no longer
possible in Cheltenham and the bird slowly deteriorated. It was Canon
Dutton's wish that if this parrot survived him, it should go to the Marquess
of Tavistock (later the Duke of Bedford) because he would be in a position
to give it conditions of semi-liberty again. The story of how this bird made
a remarkable recovery at liberty during the summer of 1920 is charmingly
told by the Marquess of Tavistock in an article in the October issue enti-

tied "The Rejuvenation of Jaco".
In April the time-honoured post of Honorary Correspondence Secre-
tary, dating from 1903 and occupied throughout by another great avi-
cultural figure of the Victorian era, Dr. A.G Butler, passed into history.
He wrote an interesting reminiscent article on his experiences in answering
all sorts of queries on birds for the Avicultural Society during this long
time. The vast experience of this man, who had published his first zoologi-
cal paper in 1865, obviously fitted him well for his valuable task, but now
in advanced years he probably felt like a rest, and the work of Correspon-
dence and Business Secretaries and of Treasurer was focussed into a single
office soon to be held by Bonhote.
As Dr. Butler grew older, he took up the hobby of gardening and added
no more birds to his collection, but he kept those he already had as long as
they lived in order to record data on longevity of birds in captivity, and his
interest in aviculture never failed. Of the eight articles that this great au-
thority and author of bird books contributed to the Avicultural Magazine
in 1920, the little note in the February issue is the most poignant - C T still
have four living birds ............My hen Napoleon Weaver, the last of those
purchased in 1900, still seems quite strong and healthy." Oh yes, he knew
how to keep birds.
The economic situation continued to deteriorate after the Great War
and the financial problems facing the productiop of journals such as the
Avicultural Magazine increased in severity until after 1922. The size and
quality of paper of the Avicultural Magazine dwindled steadily from 1916
until the start of 1923. The wonderful coloured plates that had become
the major feature of the Avicultural Magazine were things of the past after
1917 when the Society was just able to run to the cost of three coloured
plates! The two superlative bird artists, Cron void and Goodchild, were no
longer painting for the Society (the latter had died during the war) but in
any case coloured plates were out of the question from the financial point
of view. Over this five-year period only one coloured plate was produced -
in July 1920 - and this was only made possible by the generosity of a
member from India, Dr Sataya Chum Law, who had joined the previous
year. He had acquired an albino specimen of a Red-vented Bulbul, wrote
an article on it and presented an accompanying coloured plate, executed
by his painter, J.C. Baneijee. The Bulbul is pure white except for red
under tail coverts and a rosy tint about the ears. Dr Law's loyal member-
ship was destined to continue for fifty years, when honorary life member-
ship was conferred upon him and happily he is still a member. Alfred Ezra
photographed and described for the Avicultural Magazine of May 1932 his
fabulous Calcutta aviaries "..........................................where the most

difficult Indian insectivorous birds, as well as many foreign species, are
kept in most perfect condition and very often bred". Dr Law completely
revised the collection of bird skins in the Indian Museum in 1926 and
collected specimens for it from all over India.
A tale of two Editors
In the first quarter of this century there were two journals dealing
with wild birds in captivity. The Foreign Bird Club's Bird Notes was an
offshoot of the Avicultural Society dating from 1901. It claimed to have a
different emphasis, the Foreign Bird Club concentrating on the exhibiting
and practical problems of keeping wild birds, while the older Avicultural
Society produced more scientific-type papers dealing with birds more
generally. In practice both magazines were very much alike and held many
members and contributors in common. I am lucky enough to possess al-
most complete runs of each, and they are both excellent, complementing
each other wonderfully. They claimed not to be rivals, but possibly there
was a certain amount of jealousy between them.
From March 1907 onwards Bird Notes was fortunate in having an
Editor of exceptional enthusiasm - Wesley T. Page. The magazine soon
came to revolve around him and most of its regular contributors were
more or less his circle of personal friends. Page's dedication to the monthly
production of this magazine was astounding and it virtually became his
life's work. The twelve issues for 1920 were still rich in variety of content
but the signs of strain were there between the lines, typified by Page's
unusual editorial in December - "I must press the need of more members
contributing to the Club's journal ........In 1920 we have had too much
from the Editor's pen, which he deplores; true, some have written 'the
more the better'....... but seriously such is not for the permanent good of
the Club......We need a more varied publication of individual avicultural
experience; this we can only gain by more members coming out of their
shells and contributing liberally to Bird Notes ............Many of our most
valued contributors made the supreme sacrifice for King and Country -
F.B.C. suffered very heavily in this respect and the aftermath of the War
has not spared us either - surely there are those who will make good the
gap."
We can now know that W.T. Page's voice cried in the wilderness, that
even Ms indefatigible energy was wearing thin, that his health was fail-
ing, that his death some three years later may well have been hastened
by over-exertion to keep his Journal going, and that along with him died
the Foreign Bird Club.

F.C. BARNICOAT - SIXTY YEARS AGO
Fortunately for the Avicultural Society it had a broader base of real
supporters. During 1917 the editorship had been taken on by Dr Graham
Renshaw. When he joined the Society in 1910 he seems to have had a coll-
ection of birds and to have been particularly attracted to the larger soft-
bills like Glossy Starlings and Touracos. Later his interest seems to have
centred in the zoos of the world and he travelled quite widely in Europe to
study the different collections. A medical doctor by profession, he was an
extensive lecturer in zoology at the University of Manchester and author
of several works on natural history, such as Animal Romances and More
Animal Romances. In contrast to Page he seems to have been rather on
the fringe of the avicultural circle. His short editorship of the Avicultural
Magazine in these very difficult years seems to show an erudite, original
and unusually strong approach. Few errors to be sure got through under
his eagle eye. He grouped the articles for special monthly issues under
clever titles, e.gAnzac Number - Birds of Australia and New Zealand;
Summer Isles of Eden - Birds of the East Indies and Pacific; Somewhere
East of Suez - Indo China Number , etc.
For the frontispiece of the 1920 volume Renshaw chose a photo of the
Bateleur Eagle and his accompanying article describes the possibility of its
being the original of the Phoenix, and moved into the theme that, with the
importation of foreign species now recommencing, the Avicultural Society
was on the point of rising afresh from the ashes like the Phoenix of legend.
But aviculture had not yet recovered from the paralysing effects of the
war ? many aviaries were not yet re-opened, probably never would be and
an overwhelming lethargy followed in the aftermath of the war , so Ren
shaw was to become increasingly disappointed with the response from
members as 1920 advanced. He opened the June issue with an unusual
article entitled "Full circle: Revived Aviculture". Because the desperate
cry in this article is - dare I say it? - Nineteen-eightyish in tone, I quote a
few salient sentences from it: "We want the possessors of the new stock
to write about it .Such co-operation would not only
hasten recovery, but materially lighten the labours of the Editor. When all
is said, it is the contributors who make the Magazine, who hold its future
in their hands, who determine its character. No editor can evolve papers
out of thin air. Every former Editor will agree that this historic chair is by
no means a bed of roses. The editing of the Magazine (now thanks to its
contributors one of the leading natural history journals of the world) is no
sinecure .I give my services during the intervals of a life devo-
ted to the most exacting of all professions; this is done willingly, but it
is seemly that the facts be known." Obviously be was becoming impatient

The lateness of the publication of the July number resulted in a very
poor attendance of the meeting at the Zoological Gardens on 23rd July,
but the few present enjoyed an excellent tea and discussion on matters
avicultural in the Fellows' Pavilion and the surviving members of the
Council gathered at 3 o'clock to discuss the latest bolt out of the blue.
No successor to Dr. Renshaw, the last surviving name from the list of
Society Officials printed in the January issue, could be found. However
Pocock and Seth-Smith kindly undertook to keep the Magazine rolling
pro tern and we have cause to be very grateful to the small band of
supporters who closed ranks and fought on - Meade-Waldo, Trevor-Battye,
St Quin tin, the Marquess of Tavistock, Harper, Frost, Astley, etc.,
Respectively, they told of how in Kent Blue Tits recovered their numbers
through exceptional broods of 15 after the devastating
winter of 1917, of how in a Hampshire garden Kestrels and Barn Owls
came and disappeared with the fluctuation of plagues of voles and
mice that followed the upset in the balance of nature caused by that
dreadful winter, of breeding Manchurian Cranes on a Yorkshire
estate, of Masked or Red Shining or Pesquet's Parrots, of the new
collection of Indian birds brought from Calcutta for the London Zoo

since the war in the spring of 1920, Astley had met up with Jean

to Travella where good birds can be found." And there Astley bought
a lovely Cardellino-Canarino (Hooded Siskin x Canary mule).
They are nearly all gone now, those characters of 60 years ago.
It is cause for the greatest thankfulness and rejoicing that Jean Delacour
remains spared to us and is today our much loved President whose
enthusiasm is as undimmed as ever, even as a nonagenarian. And with

Distribution: Africa south of the Sahara, but excluding the Cape.
This little dove with its grey head, earth-brown upper parts with shiny
spots on the wings and black bands across the rump is often seen walking
on roads. It flies up with a quick zig-zag flight, showing chestnut on the
wings. The dove's drumming coo can frequently be heard. It is a highly
territorial species and a pair will occupy at least half an acre when nesting,
allowing no others to nest near. The cock coos and others answer but keep
their distance. It has been my experience that this dove nests during the
dry season. Two white eggs are laid in a simple nest of roots and sticks.
The eggs hatch in ten days. The chicks are reared on small seeds, etc.
At one time we had six - eight of these doves, all of them hand-reared.
We found that it was impossible to keep young fully-feathered birds of
different ages together, as the older birds would attack the younger
birds and had to be separated at once, as they would kill them. We had a
hand-reared pair in a cage in the house, then flying in the house and
sleeping in the cage, and, finally, entirely free within the house. The cock
would come forward to greet anyone who wished to be friendly; he would
coo, bow, peck and puff himself out and fly onto the hand and hold up
his wings in greeting. The hen was much shyer.
We moved a pair of adult hand-reared doves to an outside aviary. We
found that the hen would nest, but unless plenty of cover was provided,
even in an open box, the hen threw the eggs out just before they were
due to hatch. Leafy branches of fir trees and a cover above were provided
and the birds built again - the eggs hatched, but directly the chicks were
fully feathered and left the nest, the cock killed them in a very brutal
attack. The doves were then returned to the house. They settled down,
flew in and out and spent most of their time in a flower bed. They roosted
in the house. The cock brought roots and small sticks and started to build
above the window, but at this point we had to leave and move to a house
up on the Kisi hills.
Here the doves seemed much braver. They nested in a flight cage.
When the eggs were near to hatching, the birds were given cooked rice and
I added a few wood ant cocoons. Both eggs hatched after ten days and the

chicks were reared. Before they were ready to leave the nest, as a pre-
caution, I moved the cock dove to another flight cage in the verandah.
I have some very good photos taken by flashlight of these doves in the
nest and roosting in the sitting-room after they flew.
It is not easy to keep together more than one pair of these doves, once
one of the cocks becomes adult. They are friendly with humans and
quickly adapt to life in a house and will fly in and out happily. They eat
white millet and other small seeds. Mine were particularly fond of broken
shells of snails, which they found in leaf mould.

This is a large handsome bird with a bluish-black head, chestnut back
and wings, creamy white underparts and a fairly long and broad greenish-
black tail.
I was rearing three young coucals, when two younger ones were bro-
ught in. The older birds fed the younger ones when they begged for food.
They were tame and easy to feed. They thrived on moistened home-made
biscuit, grasshoppers, and so on. The young coucals slept in a basket;
they did not care to perch. Directly that they became adult and capable
of flight, they ran off; they much preferred to run than to fly. The coucals
lost all interest in humans and did not return for food, but made off to-
wards the nearest swamp.
These are the only birds I know which really relish slugs. I would
never describe them as good pets, or aviary birds, but they definitely have
their appeal.

At its last meeting, the Council of the Avicultural Society voted to
donate #25.00 from the Society's funds to the Phyllis Barclay-Smith
Memorial Appeal in appreciation for the great contribution she made to
the Society during the 35 years in which she was Editor of the Avicultural
Magazine but it was also felt that many members might like to contribute
to this Appeal individually.
The Appeal has been launched by the International Council for Bird
Preservation and the aim is to raise #50,000 to establish the new head-
quarters of the ICBP at Cambridge which will be named after her. Dona-

A recent report on iron accumulation in the livers of Birds of Paradise,
by the Blijdorp Zoo, Rotterdam, seems to indicate a sensitivity to iron
amongst captive members of this family. Liver degeneration, through a
buildup of the mineral,is regarded as the main cause of death at Blijdorp
Zoo and probably also at London Zoo and San Diego Zoo. Before inves-
tigations started, the daily intake of iron at Blijdorp was given as 3.37 mg
per bird; by avoiding vitamin-mineral supplements, currants and raisins,
this was decreased to 0.85 mg. The paper contains much information and
creates avenues for further investigation into the problem.

The only records I can trace of a successful breeding with any member
of the Man akin family relate to the Blue-backed Chiroxiphia pareola which
was reared in the mid-1970s by London Zoo and by Derrick England. How-
ever, the Philadelphia Zoo had a near success in 1978 with the Swal-
low-tailed C. caudata. Curator of Birds, Larry Shelton, writes: "At that

Hummingbird House in which they had been exhibited since 1974. Fre-

"News and Views" (Avicultural Magazine , 1980, p. 53) included
further news of the Red-headed Blue-bills breeding in Mr. S. Downey's
aviaries at Langata, Kenya. At the end of 1980, Mr. Downey wrote to
Malcolm Ellis, to bring him up to date with his latest news. During the past
few years, ten Blue-bills have hatched in Mr. Downey's aviaries. He wrote:
"One, as you know, was killed by the old male and another just died -
leaving eight."
As the result of a hole made by a rat, a young male and the breeding
male Blue-bill got together and there was a fight. Mr. Downey separated
them at once. Neither was badly injured, but he found that he could not
tell which male was which! Since this unfortunate incident, there has been
no further breeding.
Species which have hatched young are: Cut-throat Finch, Speke's,
Chestnut, Layard's, Black-headed and Reichenow's Weavers, Tambourine
Dove, Emerald-spotted Wood Dove, plover (presumed Crowned!), Ross's
Touraco, D'Arnaud's Barbet and White-headed Barbet. The pair of White-
headed Barbets have lived for upward of seven years in Mr. Downey's avi-
aries, and to the best of his knowledge have never nested before. Two
months before he wrote, a small white head appeared in the entrance to a
gourd, and at the time of writing, the young barbet was out and flying
strongly.
At Langata, a suburb of Nairobi, they had a wet year, with nearly 40
inches of rain - although in other parts, such as the Nanyuki area, from
where Mr. Downey had just returned, there had been no rain at all. He
wondered if perhaps the drought there was caused by the never-ending
destruction of trees for charcoal. He added that almost every day in the
newspapers there are warnings issued by officials that people found cutting
down trees will be severely dealt with, but nothing seems to happen.

&amp;quot;Four rehabilitated Bald Eagles were released on a north-western river
(specific location withheld for conservation and research purposes) on
13th January by the Woodland Park Zoological Gardens, Seattle, USA. At
least two of the eagles (a pair, both adults) were injured by gun shots
which damaged their wings*, one was brought to the zoo from Mt. Vernon
by the Washington State Game Department, the second from Lopey
Island. The other two birds had injuries of unknown origin; an adult fe-
male found near Aberdeen was received from State Game, and an im-
mature male was brought in by the United States Department of Fish and
Wildlife.
Three of the eagles arrived at the zoo less than one year ago. The fourth
had been recuperating from its injuries for almost two years. Prior to the
release date, zoo staff attached a light-weight transmitter to each bird and
stained tail feathers with an identifying dye to help monitor their reintro-
duction to the wild.
The zoo's raptor rehabilitation programme, named "Project Babe",
began in 1971. Since that time 25 Bald and Golden Eagles (including these
four) and several hawks, falcons, Kestrels and owls have been rehabilitated
and reintroduced to the wild. The State Game Department actively sup-
ports the programme by bringing injured birds to the zoo for treatment
and by assisting with their tracking following release.
During the winter, large numbers of wild eagles are attracted to the
thousands of spawned-out salmon which litter the banks of Pacific North-
west rivers. To ease the rehabilitated eagles' transition to a wild state, their
release is timed to coincide with this abundance of easily captured prey.
Furthermore, Bald Eagles are not territorial at this time of the year since
food is so easy to come by. Therefore, the birds are able to congregate at
feeding sites without harassment from one another.
Following release, the eagles will be monitored by zoo staff, local
assistants and State Game officials who are studying the resident and
migrant populations in Washington State. The released eagles will be
tracked with radio equipment until it is determined that they are feeding
on their own and capable of survival/'(News Release: Woodland Park
Zoological Gardens, Seattle).

from wild-taken eggs (Avicultural Magazine , 1980, 82-83), Michael Lub-
bock sends the following notes on breeding the Pink-eared Ducks at
the Wildfowl Trust, Slimbridge, during 1980: "One female and two males
formed a very close relationship in July. One male seemed to be the more
dominant but all three protected a territory on the larger top pond of the
Tropical House and kept other Pink-ears away from the area. All the Pink-
ears in the Tropical House had been hatched from eggs brought back from
Australia in a portable incubator and had been reared in the quarantine
station. They were then transferred to the Tropical House where they have
been ever since. Very little was known about their breeding particulars,
especially in captivity. However, it was known that to entice them to
breed in the wild, the coming of the rainy season sparks off their urge as
the rain is one of the main links in the food chain, causing growth of vege-
tation and hatching of flies for young ducklings to be successfully reared.
The daily introduced rainfall in the Tropical House could have had a big
influence on the breeding of the Pink-ears.
From the first clutch of six eggs, four young ones were hatched in an
incubator and successfully reared. The female was allowed to incubate the
eggs for 18 days before they were removed to the incubator. She was given
three Cape Teal eggs in replacement. However, once the Cape Teal had
hatched and dried, the female took them from her nesting box to the
water where they were instantly attacked by the two males. Before they
could be rescued,two had been killed. The third was removed and success-
fully hand-reared.
The first clutch of eggs was laid in early August, the female being just
ten months old. They hatched on 10th September. The second clutch of
eggs was laid late September; two hatched on 28th October and died
within two days. A third clutch was laid mid-November and are still being
incubated at the time of writing."

The latest issue of the Papua New Guinea Bird Society Newsletter
contains several interesting papers on birds of the Bensback Floodplain,
Western Province; the most important covers the rediscovery of the Fly
River Grassbird Megalurus albolimbatus after a period of 44 years. The
observations of Brian Finch seemed to indicate that this species is rela-
tively common where suitable strands of Cyperus sedge exist but he
expresses some concern about the destruction of habitat by deer and
pigs.
Four additional papers cover new species records for the New Guinea
region, namely Black Swan, Chestnut Teal, Welcome Swallow Hirundo
neoxena and the Fan-tailed Warbler Cisticoia juncidis.

Recent field work on three cockatoos is outlined in the December 1980
Newsletter of the Royal Australian Ornithologists 5 Union. Population
studies on the Red-tailed and White-tailed Black Cockatoos are summar-
ised as is the breeding behaviour of the Roseate. Part of the studies on the
latter focused on the interactions of parents with their chick and showed
that parents would accept strange chicks until about the fifth week, pro-
vided that they were in the pair&amp;apos;s nest hollow and of about the same size as
their own chicks. Conversely they would not attend to their own chicks in
a hollow different from their own. Between five and seven weeks after
hatching, the chicks began to reject foreign parents and, presumably, over
this period individual recognition between chicks and parents developed.

WILDTAUBEN: HALTUNG, PFLEGE UND ZUCHT
(Wild Doves and Pigeons: their keeping, care and breeding)
By H-S. RAETHEL
Published by Verlag Ulmer, Stuttgart (1980)
This very well-produced, handily-sized and clearly legible book deals
with all the wild species of pigeons (or doves, it is a pity our language has
two words, with different emotional overtones, for birds of the same
family) known to have been imported alive into western Europe or the
USA. At a rough guess, I should think the book includes about two-thirds
of the world's pigeons. I was not, until I read it, aware that so many of
them had been kept by aviculturists.
After a short introduction and a description of the book's aim and lay-
out, there follows a chapter on the natural history of wild pigeons (which
includes their position in the avian class, habitat and climate, food and
feeding habits, drinking and bathing, sun- and dust-bathing, display, nest-
ing, parental care, calls and life expectations) and chapters on the keeping
and care of pigeons; their feeding; diseases and their treatment and the
breeding of wild pigeons in captivity.
The final and largest part of the book deals with the various groups,
genera and species. Very different-looking subspecies are treated separate-
ly, a wise decision, I think, in a book of this kind. The general layout is
very similar to that in my own Pigeons and Doves of the World (of which
I hope all who read this will have bought at least one copy) but includes
a section "Haltung und Zucht" (keeping and breeding) which gives dates
and details of the first importation of each species and where, when and to
what extent it has been bred in captivity.
Such a comprehensive book must, of necessity, be largely a compilation
of the work of others but it is a pity that the author gives no clues as to
when, or to what extent, he is speaking from personal experience. At the
back of the book is a comprehensive list of the literature (presumably)
consulted and (in part) utilised but we are not usually told which bit of
information derives from which reference. In some cases there is need of
this. For example: when compiling my own book, I found conflicting
"authoritative" descriptions of the voice of the Eastern Rock Pigeon,
Columba rupestris, so gave both, making clear the situation and lack of
certainty as to which was correct. In this book, one of these versions, that
deriving from Salim Ali, is given without comment. Hence the reader does

not know whether Dr, Raethel has copied this from Dr. Salim All's book,
secondhand from mine, or whether he has first-hand information. The
species has been kept and bred of recent years in the East Berlin Zoo but the
authorities there would appear to be unwilling, or not permitted, to di-
vulge information about its voice or behaviour to the capitalist West.
Most of the information in the book appears to be accurate although
here and there one has the impression that an attempt at overmuch com-
pression from an original source has had unhappy results.
I found part of the information on behaviour as puzzling as I did that
in the recently published "pigeon" volume of the German Handbook of
Central European Birds, and for the same reason. Whereas some German
ornithologists restrict the term "Treiben" (when speaking of pigeons) to
the behaviour which British pigeon-keepers (and most of the very few
British ornithologists who have any interest in pigeons) term "driving"
(and this, I gather from Dr Jurgen Nicolai, is its correct usage) others use
it instead or (most muddling of all) additionally for the bowing display,
which is usually or also termed "Verbeugungsbalz". Here, on p.14, the
author uses both terms. At one point he would seem to be referring to
driving (in the English sense) as he writes (my translation) "The cooing
calls given by the cock pigeon during the bowing display (Verbeugungs-
balz) are softer than the advertising coo ...................... As in many species
the driving (treibende) cock pigeon utters these calls, they are called
driving coos (Treibrucksen).*' Yet if he is here referring to the quite differ-
ent behaviour patterns of driving and the bowing display, his statement is
wrong. I know of no species of pigeon which utters its display coo while
it is driving its mate, although it may utter it, and perform the accompany-
ing display, immediately after it has stopped driving.
The colour plates are a highlight, of the book. One or two show fright-
ened birds with bloody ceres and disarranged plumage, betraying rough
handling and impatience on the part of the photographer, and something
has obviously gone wrong with the colours of the Yellow-legged Green
Pigeon (sattoo diet?) on p. 53. Most of the photographs are, however, fair
to very good in quality and some show species of which I have never seen
(or known of the existence of) photographs before. They will be invalu-
able for bird artists who too often give their exotic pigeons the shape and
"jizz" of Columba livia or C palumbus.
There is no price on my review copy but unless the book is very expen-
sive indeed, any pigeon addict will find it well worth buying for the pic-
tures alone. Happily, a free copy of the book is a reviewer's "perk".

</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.960089" page_id="56284200"  page_num="120" year="" vol="">
Bull. Amer. Mus. Nat. Hist., Vol. 164: article 3. pp. 379-465
By C. B. FRITH. Published as a separate, September 1979.
Price 6.15 US dollars. ISSN 0003-0090
Before the introduction to this painstaking and excellent work, the
author puts an apt quotation by G. F. Mees: "Bibliography is a most
unrewarding occupation, because one tends to get blamed for what one
has overlooked, rather than praised for what one has accomplished.&amp;apos;' All
too true. It will, however, be most unfair if any nit-picking reviewer fails
to give Mr. Frith praise for what he has here accomplished so ably.
Anyone interested in any species of bird that lives in or around New
Guinea and who wishes to find out what, if anything, has been written
about it will find the "who by", "what" and "where" clearly and succintly
presented here. Everything is cross referenced under both authors and
families and species of the birds, so, whether the inquirer has a hunch
that Bill Bloggs might have written something about some New Guinea
birds and wants to make sure, or wishes to find anything that has been
written about, say, Ducula spilorrhoa, or if anyone has ever revised any
genus that has members in the Papuan subregion, he will easily find the
answer in this work.
In his introduction the author clearly describes the scope of the work,
the abbreviations used and so on. There is a map (p. 459) showing the
area dealt with and its boundaries.
As some ornithological writers are apt to overlook (or deliberately
ignore) information that has appeared in our magazine, it is pleasing to
see that Mr. Frith has not done so, all papers that have appeared in the
AviculturalMagazine on any Papuan Region species are listed.
A most useful work of reference that could not, I think, have been
better done.

Rock Pigeons: some comments and queries
As Columba livia , in all its non-monstrous forms, is a favourite bird of
mine, my eye was at once caught by Professor Carl Naether's article enti-
tled "Important News Concerning Rock Pigeons" in the Avicultural Maga-
zine (Volume 86, No. 3, p.176).
On reading it, however, I was disappointed to find that it was largely
composed of brief descriptions of some of the subspecies of C. livia, all of
which have been described in more detail in many books and other publi-
cations. The only statements I could find that might qualify as being
"news" struck me as being very doubtful (and therefore requiring at least
some supporting evidence), incorrect or (in one case) incomprehensible.
Possibly some or all of these flaws are due to difficulties of translation
from the GefliigePBorse article to which Professor Naether refers. I think,
however, that they call for comment.
P. 1 76, second paragraph
Here it seems to be implied that the feral pigeons, in some or many
areas have derived from fancy pigeons which, interbreeding over the gener-
ations, have produced the more or less naturally shaped birds we see today
in most parks, cities, sea cliffs, etc. 1 would suggest, on the contrary, that
stocks of feral pigeons have derived from nondescript domestic pigeons
not greatly differing from wild Rock Pigeons in general appearance, the
old fashioned dovecote pigeons (which were very similar to the wild bird
in shape and abilities) and racing homer pigeons (nowadays usually called
simply "racing pigeons" or "racers" by fanciers) which although larger and
with thicker bills than Rock Pigeons, are otherwise very like them in
shape. One certainly sometimes sees fantails, frills, ices, tumblers and so on
among feral pigeons but I have not known of where such a fancy pigeon,
except in the case of one very "poorly-bred" and hardly deformed fantail,
have bred successfully in a feral state. If Professor Naether has evidence of
any feral population having been derived largely or wholly from any fancy
breeds, I, and I am sure many other readers, would be most interested to
read a full account of it.
P. 177, 7th line et seq.
"There may ....... be further subspecies extant in countries where they
are simply inaccessible to observers......." Well, anything is possible but in
view of the extent to which collectors have in the past explored virtually
all parts of the world where Columba livia is likely to occur, it does not

seem very probable that more races of this bird remain to be discovered.
Could Professor Naether suggest areas where he thinks undiscovered forms
of G livia may lurk?
P. 177, lines 25-27
".in given habitats Rock Pigeons have crossed with certain native
species....thus definitely affecting plumage coloration."
I know of no evidence that the Rock Pigeon, in a wild or feral state, has
hybridised with any other species. It has been said to have done so with
the Speckled Pigeon C. guinea in Africa but I have seen no evidence for
this. As, obviously, the Rock Pigeons of any area would be native species,
the wording of the above sentence seems a bit odd. However, if Professor
Naether (or anyone else) has any evidence of wild (or feral) C. livia inter-
breeding with any other species in a free state , could we please have full
details?
P. 177, middle of first paragraph
The statement is made that the size of the various subspecies of C livia
are at least in part environmentally determined (I assume that here the
word "species" is being used where "subspecies" should have been, other-
wise the sentences would not make sense), and that those living on a wild
diet in arid environments "tend to be smaller in size than species (sic) in-
habiting grain-producing regions. Yet further on we are told, correctly,
that the smallest subspecies is C livia schimperi, an inhabitant of the high-
ly fertile grain-producing Nile Valley!
P. 177, third paragraph
C livia daklae is certainly the lightest coloured race of the Rock
Pigeon. For that very reason it is incorrect to say that "Its upper parts and
wings are light grey contrasting strongly with a white back". In fact, the
very pale silvery cream of its mantle and wing coverts contrast hardly at
all with the white of the lower back.
P. 177, last lines and continuing over the page
I cannot understand what is meant by the statement that the race of
Rock Pigeon from the Indian peninsula C livia intermedia functions as the
"originator" of all subspecies. Could we have some explanation as to

Many years ago, a so-called World Exposition was held in the city of
San Diego. At its conclusion between thirty and forty breeds of so-called
fancy pigeons exhibited were simply turned loose on the environment.
Within a period of approximately ten years, during which time they re-
mained in San Diego, they interbred and degenerated to such an extent as
to lose and change both their form and colour of plumage - in short, they
had become common street and park pigeons, their colour tending to re-
semble that of the Rock Pigeon.
As to the Rock Pigeon hybridising with any other species, I recall that
Mr. Rudkin (deceased), a successful and well-known parrot fancier in
Fillmore, California, maintained a flock of about 30 Speckled Pigeons
which had free flight the year round. He informed me that some Rock
Pigeons in due time joined his Speckled Pigeons, feeding with them reg-
ularly and in time mating with them. He made a practice of destroying
all eggs laid since he did not wish to increase his flock. The Rock Pigeons
flew with the Speckled Pigeons and nested with them in the Rudkin loft:
both species were exceedingly shy.
I have no desire whatever to become further involved in any part of
this "argument" and I hope that Mr. Goodwin will, in due course, report
his findings about the Rock Pigeon's inheritance, etc., in the form of an
article in th e Avicultural Magazine.

Turdus merula
By Dr MARSHA A. SCHLEE (Museum of Natural History, Paris, France)
This paper recounts the successful nesting of a four-year-old, hand-
reared male and a yearling female, in a greenhouse aviary maintained at the
Laboratory of Entomology, Museum of Natural History, Paris. A much
earlier breeding attempt was reported by Miss E.E. West (1911) but it had
a most unfortunate outcome with no young birds surviving for more than
a few days after hatching.
Environmental setting
The aviary was constructed by blocking off part of a greenhouse with a
nylon protecting net. Its ground surface measures approximately 2.5 by
6 metres and the highest point of the roof is about 3 metres from the
floor. Heating pipes run along the walls and are regularly used by the birds
as perches. The aviary has a dirt floor in which grow a wide variety of trop-
ical plants including a papyrus and a rubber tree.
The maintenance diet of the Blackbirds is comprised of commercial
feed for insectivorous birds, fruit and insects (particularly mealworms,
crickets and cockroaches).
History of the nesting pair
The male bird was received on 31st May 1976, at an estimated age of 9
days. He came from the department of Sarthe in the west of France. Be-
cause of the nature of the imprinting process in birds, I was not at all cer-
tain that a hand-reared male would accept a female of his own species as a
partner. Sexual behaviour was displayed every year as soon as moulting
ended, and copulatory attempts were carried out on a number of inani-
mate objects - rocks, sponges, glass case, etc. In October 1977, this bird
was observed parading and posturing in full courtship display on the edge
of a sink, the whole time uttering the characteristic "strangled" song.
Courtship behaviour was obviously being directed to the water tap which
the male mounted and with which he attempted to copulate.

Dr. M.A. SCHLEE - BREEDING THE BLACKBIRD
The exact origin of the female Blackbird is unknown, for she was mys-
teriously placed in the aviary in the spring of 1979. She had full juvenile
plumage and was probably about two months old.
One Sunday in July 1979, the door of the aviary had been pushed in
and both birds were missing. A careful search of the greenhouse and the
adjacent garden - for the roof was open for ventilation - revealed no sign of
them. That evening at about 4.00 p.m. both birds came back and tried to
enter the aviary. The female hid as soon as I approached, and I was not
able to catch her, but the male, on the contrary, entered as soon as I
showed him his feeding dish. The next day there was no sign of the female
until about 4.00 p.m., the time when I made the evening rounds and often
distributed mealworms. She had again entered the greenhouse and was
poking her head through the netting. After placing a dish of food in a con-
spicuous position, I was able to gently direct her toward the door of the
aviary. Although the female chose to stay in the artificial setting of the
aviary, she has remained completely wild.
Pair formation
On 30th April 1980, I took the male bird out of the aviary in order to
treat him for a respiratory problem. An examination of his faeces revealed
the presence of a large number of mycelia. Up until that time, the relation-
ship between the male and the female was characterised by aggressive dis-
plays, chasing and an occasional fight.
I returned the male to the aviary on 3rd June. As soon as I released
him, the female gave high-pitched trilling calls, each of which was ans-
wered in the same manner by the male. Both birds then took up a squatt-
ing, face-to-face position followed by aggressive "seep" calls and the
snapping of beaks. Suddenly the female attacked the male and chased him
around the aviary. Pair-formation was apparently the outcome of these
manoeuvres, for the next day the birds conducted themselves as an estab-
lished couple and nesting activities were begun.
Nest site and construction
On 4th June the male was seen prospecting part of a tree that had
been placed 2 metres off the ground in a corner between the heating pipes
and the greenhouse roof. The bird's behaviour consisted of some "stran-
gled" song and courtship postures, in addition to trying out the site by
squatting and turning in circles. This display was observed every spring al-
ways on the same block of wood which, moreover, housed an ant colony.
That afternoon the female frequently visited the corner but she did not

carry any nest material. Moss, cotton, dry grass and straw had been placed
in the aviary in order to give the birds a wide choice of material.
Nest construction was started on 5th June, but all the materials fell
off behind the block of wood. Consequently the next day the garden cura-
tor stuffed straw into the space between the nest site and the side of the
greenhouse. The ants reacted to this disturbance by swarming out of the
colony and by taking up defensive postures; however, the insects never
reacted to the presence of the Blackbirds. When I came to the aviary dur-
ing the afternoon of 8th June, I saw that the nest had been completed.
The male was standing guard over it, and the female was not in sight.
Laying, incubation and hatching
From 9th June onwards, the female spent much time on the nest and
appeared to be incubating. According to the date of hatching, however,
the first egg must have been laid at least a week later, around 16th June
(incubation in Blackbirds lasts about thirteen days). I did not inspect the
nest contents for fear that the female, who was not the least bit tame,
would abandon the clutch. Only three eggs were laid, which could be ex-
plained by the fact that the clutch was laid quite late in the season. All
three eggs hatched. On 29th June, in the afternoon, I found two broken
egg shells in the corner of the aviary that was furthest from the nest; on
2nd July, I found the third egg shell in the same place as the first two.
Incubation must have started with the laying of the first egg.
When the female was off the nest, the male usually stood guard over
it and frequently "arranged" the rim; in no case was he further away than
1.5 metres from the nest when I was in the aviary.
Care of the nestlings
The parents took turns feeding their offspring and depended almost
entirely on the food items that I supplied. As far as I could tell, only ani-
mal matter was fed to the nestlings. I had put commercial feed, fruit,
bread and hard-boiled egg in the aviary but these items remained un-
touched and were not used even by the adult birds in self-feeding. The
approximate number of insects consumed over the thirteen-day period in
which the young birds were in the nest was as follows: 250 Crickets
Acheta domestica (1-2 cm long); 250 Cockroaches Blaberus craniifer
larvae and newly-moulted adults (1.5-4 cm long); 200 Coleopterans
Tenebrio molitor larvae and adults; 13 coffee cups full of the Coleopteran
Alphitobius diaperinus larvae and adults; and several hundred larvae, pupae
and adults of the Lepidopteranylrargasta kuehniella. Nonetheless, the bulk of

Dr. M.A. SCHLEE - BREEDING THE BLACKBIRD
the diet was made up of earthworms (average length 8 cm) and more than
1 200 were consumed. The daily food intake increased in proportion to
the nestlings' development and additional insects were supplied whenever
necessary. On 7th July I discovered an ant colony in the Laboratory
garden and was thus able to give the birds an additional source of food.
However, they did not seem to recognise the ant pupae as food. Eventually
I summoned the male, who was accustomed to taking mealworms out of
my hands, and repeatedly offered him the pupae. As soon as he tasted
them, he gathered them up and fed his offspring.
To keep the nest clean, the adults either swallowed the faecal pellets
or dropped them in the corner of the aviary the furthest from the nest.
Removal of the young from the nest
On 12th July, although the young birds were fourteen days old, they
had still not left the nest; however, I saw only two nestlings when the male
went to feed them. Since I did not see the third one on the ground, I
climbed up to the nest to investigate. The young birds froze immediately,
but when 1 gently caressed and covered them with my hand while search-
ing for the third nestling, they both gave "purring" calls, apparently think-
ing that the female had come to brood. I found no trace of the third nest-
ling. I finally found its body, about 4.5 metres from the nest, behind the
receptacle that the birds used for bathing. The third nestling was ex-
tremely underdeveloped and obviously suffered from malnutrition. It must
have been 12 days old at the time of death but in appearance it resembled
an 8-day-old bird.
I went back to the nest to examine the other two young birds. Just as
I was about to put the first one back into the nest, it screamed and the
male bird promptly dived at my head. (He had been perched next to the
nest, quietly watching me handle his offspring.) The young Blackbird
would not stay in the nest, so I slipped it into my laboratory coat and left
the aviary. My original plan was to take the nestlings when they were
ready to be fledged and then handrear them so that they would be tame
enough to be used in a series of learning experiments that I intended to
carry out in the future. When I came back to the aviary half an hour later,
the second young bird was no longer in the nest. I was able to locate it by
listening to it respond to its parents' contact calls. When I caught the
young bird, it screamed and the male immediately gave alarm calls and ran
toward me in an aggressive posture. He examined my hands and since I was
no longer holding the bird, he started searching elsewhere. During the
entire episode, the female constantly gave alarm calls and high-pitched

"chinking" noises but remained out of sight. The next day the parents
were still looking for their offspring, but during the following week the
reproductive phase waned and the annual moult began.
There was a marked difference in colour between the fledglings - a
difference that I had already noticed when they were much younger. One
fledgling was very dark, while the other one was quite light. As it turned
out later, the difference in colour corresponded to a difference in sex: the
darker bird was a male, the lighter one a female.
Handrearing of the fledglings
Both young birds were extremely wild, ran about in all directions
trying to hide, snapped their beaks and defended themselves when ap-
proached. I had to force feed them for three days; whenever they had the
possibility they would immediately spit out any food that was given. Their
diet consisted of insects, fruit and moistened commercial feed mixed with
hard egg yolk. The fledglings started to eat insects by themselves at the age
of 23 days and became fully independent at 29 days.
Both fledglings had to be treated for gape worms Syngamus trachea , the
first signs of the infection appearing on 20th July when they were 22 days
old. The Syngamus larvae are known to be ingested by such transport
hosts as earthworms in which they become encysted. The earthworms used
to feed the nestlings were certainly the source of the infection. The treat-
ment consisted of inhaling barium antimonyl tartrate powder in an en-
closed box. Five days later I noticed that the young birds were infected
with ascarids and a vermifuge was given in their drinking water.
The nesting behaviour of these captive Blackbirds corresponds to that
described by Snow (1958) in wild populations. However, it seems neces-
sary to emphasise the rapidity of pair-formation and nest construction, as
well as the total dependence on animal matter for feeding the nestlings.

By MALCOLM ELLIS (Wadebridge, Cornwall)
As an avicultural subject, the Oriole Finch Linurgus olivaceus is vir-
tually unknown. It is not included in any of the birdkeeping books with
which I am familiar and it seems that before now, it has never been written
about in the Avicultural Magazine.
I first became aware of the Oriole Finch on seeing David Reid-Henry's
small black and white sketch of a male in "Birds of the Sudan" by Cave
and Macdonald (Oliver and Boyd, 1955). My first opportunity to see this
species alive came when a pair was added to the collection at London Zoo.
The pair came from Mr. and Mrs. Barnley's aviaries in western Kenya. Sub-
sequently the Barnleys have been among my closest friends and often I
have helped them with their birds which have included several Oriole
Finches. So far I have not managed to see this species in the wild.
It is designated a genus to itself within the family Fringillidae, sub-
family Carduelinae (goldfinches and allies). It is listed between two other
monotypic species, the Sao Thome Grosbeak-Weaver Neospiza concolor
and the Golden-winged Grosbeak Rhynchostruthus socotranus. Most
readers will be unfamiliar with the Oriole Finch and seeing that it comes
between two such named species, they may get a mistaken impression of
its appearance. It is hardly grosbeak-like: it measures about 5 inches in
length (127 mm) and, as can be seen from my photograph, possesses only
a moderately stout bill.
I had reservations about including here my photograph of a male
L. o. elgonensis held in Jane Barnley's hand. However, the bird shows no
obvious distress and the photograph illustrates well the bill, also the head
and wing markings, as well as providing a good idea of the species' propor-
tions.
Covering the head and extending to a point on the centre of the chest,
the male's distinctive mask is jet black. Black is the main colour of the
primaries and secondaries. The innermost secondaries show a yellow edge
and white tip. The primaries also show a white tip. Otherwise, the upper-
parts, including the tail, are mostly olivaceous yellow. The hind neck, sides
of the neck and the underparts are yellow with, in places, a golden tone.
The bill is orange yellow. The legs and feet are orange brown.
The male bears a resemblance to some orioles, especially Old World
black-headed species. It is, of course, considerably smaller. Having seen

only L. o. elgonensis, it is difficult for me to make comparisons between
the races. From descriptions, it seems that other males differ from L. o.
elgonensis , principally in their upperparts being more greenish in colour.
Some descriptions of L. o. olivaceous and L.o. kilimensis describe their
upperparts as mainly rich moss green.
The female Oriole Finch is coloured mainly olive green and is remi-
niscent of a tiny, dark male Greenfinch Carduelis chloris. The young
Oriole Finch is described as being duller than the female, with pale green-
ish tips to the wing coverts. Tim and Jane Barnley have found that young
males seem to take quite a time to assume adult plumage. They have sent
away what were thought to be females only to learn that later they moul-
ted into adult male plumage.
The Oriole Finch was discovered first on the island of Fernando Po,
which now seems to be called Macias Nguema Biyoga, off the coast of
West Africa. Later, it was found to inhabit not only Cameroon Mountain,
but other localities in the highlands of what is now Cameroun. More
recently it was found to extend to the Obudu Plateau, Nigeria. The
West African race is the nominate one.
L. o. elgonensis , described first from Mount Elgon, occurs on the Ima-
tong Mountains of Sudan, eastern Uganda and western and central Kenya.
With it is now included L.o. keniensis, which was listed from central Ken-
ya, having been described first from northern Mount Kenya. L. o. kilimen-
sis was listed from Mount Kenya, but recent works omit Kenya from its
distribution. Described first from Mount Kilimanjaro, it is now listed only
from north-eastern to south-western Tanzania and northern Malawi. Ban-
nerol an (1953), mentioned the possibility of an undescribed race from
west Kivu. Presumably this was L.o. prigoginei, described in 1950, and
listed by Mackworth-Praed and Grant (1973) from Kivu and the eastern
Congo border! Britton (1980) lists it from the Impenetrable Forest,
south-west Uganda.
The Oriole Finch is confined mainly to mountains and highlands in
tropical Africa. Serle and Morel (1977) record that it occurs as low as
1,800 ft. (548 m) on Cameroon Mountain. Overall, it is most frequent at
altitudes between 5,000 and 9,000 ft. (1,524 and 2,743 m). Bannerman
ended his notes about the Oriole Finch: "It is worthy of note that the
race on Mount Elgon ascends to the bamboo zone at 20,000 feet." It is
indeed worthy of note! Mount Elgon is 'only' 14,178 ft (4,321 m) high,
so 20,000 ft. must be a misprint and should be 10,000 ft.(3,048 m), which
is the highest altitude for the Oriole Finch given by Mackworth-Praed and
Grant (1960).

According to the same authors (1973), the nominate race L o. kili-
mensis and L.o. progoginei , usually are seen feeding in small scattered
flocks at the forest edge or among the boughs of large trees; and L.o.
elgonensis is found among bamboos and dense bush.
It is much the same as the habitat described by Bannerman, whose
notes refer mainly to the nominate race. In addition, he mentions that the
Oriole Finch is attracted to abandoned farms, where there is an impene-
trable tangle of small trees, bushes, grass and thorns.
Tim and Jane Barnley are familiar with L. o. elgonensis on the Cheren-
gani Hills, nearby Mount Elgon and in the Kakamega Forest, western Ken-
ya. Tim Barnley described its habitat as damp riverine forest, alongside
abandoned shambas (African smallholdings and farms), which have
become overgrown with nettles; he added that when the birds are not feed-
ing, often they are in tall trees.
According to Mackworth-Praed and Grant (1960), the food of the
Oriole Finch is: "Noted as grass seeds, tree seeds, the seeds of a sapro-
phytic orchid and occasional caterpillars". Tim and Jane Barnley first
noticed it feeding on unripe nettle seeds and nibbling the minute seeds
from figs. Unripe seeds from the cultivated tobacco plant are much rel-
ished.
Tim Barnley wrote that, although equipped with a fairly substantial
and strong seedeater's bill, the Oriole Finch feeds mainly on unripe and
other soft seeds, buds and some fruit. Soft-bodied insects are taken and,
in captivity, mealworms, but the skins of the latter are discarded. He
feels that in captivity the diet should be that of a 'softbilled' species and
include adequate greenfood. In addition, he suggests that soaked seed be
offered.
The food which Tim and Jane Barnley first got caged Oriole Finches
to take was homemade bird-meal (a local brand of plain biscuit, finely
crushed, with honey and dripping rubbed in, with Complan and chick
mash with Vitamealo added), then banana and paw paw covered with the
meal, with nectar alongside. In notes sent to me by Jane Barnley, she
wrote that they sift through their food and discard a lot, rather like tits
do. Aviary-proud, she described Oriole Finches as 'filthy' feeders; adding
that they are not as greedy as Grey-headed Negro Finches Nigrita canica-
pilla.
Freshly caught Oriole Finches they house indoors, singularly or in
pairs, in small travelling boxes. These afford the occupants a nicely sec-
luded home during their early days In captivity. Made mainly from hard-
board, each box has one or sometimes two perches going from side to

side and has a soft, fine-mesh nylon covered front, which in turn is
covered by a hessian flap which can be raised when the occupants have
become accustomed to confinement.
Throughout the first few days, at regular intervals, the birds are re-
moved from the boxes to be fed diced fruit, mixed with the aforemention-
tioned meal and nectar. The first few occasions it is usually necessary to
open the bird's mandibles and gently push the food down. Fortunately
most birds soon learn to accept food held between the fingers. The bird's
bill is carefully wiped clean after each feed. This way, the presence of
food on the bill shows when a bird has started to feed itself. By that
stage the birds are usually well settled and if, in the morning, they are
quietly watched when fresh food is put in the cage, they will usually
go down to the pot almost immediately and begin to feed. When it has
been seen that they are feeding well, they may be transferred to a unit
of small outdoor aviaries. There again, they are housed singly or in pairs,
with suitable companions such as waxbills, negro finches and the like.
Tim and Jane Barnley have found individual Oriole Finches to be
somewhat vindictive if introduced to an unfamiliar Oriole Finch of their
own or the opposite sex. They have found them to be very tempera-
mental birds, which tend to sulk, are difficult to establish and prone to
"coughing"; once established and out in aviaries, they are fine.
It was in June 1964 when a pair of Oriole Finches arrived at London
Zoo and this was the first time that this species had been represented
there. At the same time a pair went to the late Capt. de Quincey. It was
almost certainly the first importation of this species into Britain. The
London Zoo pair was housed in an indoor aviary which contained an
assortment of waxbills and other small seedeaters. The male Oriole Finch
died after living at the Zoo for one year and seven months, the female
after four years and two and a half months.
Jane Barnley has kept records of the Oriole Finches which have been
sent abroad. A cat had kittens in her early records, but those which
remain show that in 1965, three went to Milwaukee Zoo; in 1966 two
went to Birdland, Bourton-on-the-Water; in 1972, four went to Switzer-
land; in 1973 four went to Mrs. Scamell in England, and one to Rome.
During 1976 a total of 22 Oriole Finches were sent to Denmark, West
Germany and Belgium. The following year, a total of 26
were sent to Denmark, West Germany, Austria and Britain. Since the
Kenya Government ban on hunting, etc., no Oriole Finches have been
sent abroad by the Barnleys.

THE WHOOPING CRANE: LESSONS IN PRESERVATION

By Dr. G.K. MAROLDO (Texas Lutheran College, Seguin, Texas, USA)
During the past few decades, the Whooping Crane^ Grus americana
has made a notable recovery from the brink of extinction. American and
Canadian governments, interested organisations and private citizens have
contributed to this set of events. This is a survey of efforts made to pre-
serve this endangered species.
As North America became more heavily populated in the last century,
the migratory Whooping Crane retreated from its range which had once
extended from the east coast to the Rocky Mountains in the United States
and from southern Manitoba and Saskatchewan to south-eastern Alberta in
Canada. By the turn of the century, Whooping Cranes wintered only in the
south Atlantic and Gulf states and in north-eastern and central Mexico
(Stevenson an d^ Griffith, 1946). Meanwhile, in Canada they withdrew even
farther north than before to breed. Never an abundant species, these birds
travelled every autumn with their young from their nesting grounds some-
where in Canada to southern United States. In the spring, of course, the
cranes returned to Canada,

Dr. G.K. MAROLDO - THE WHOOPING CRANE
Concern for survival
Serious concern for Whooping Crane survival dates from the 1930's and
1940's when it was realised by Robert Porter Allen, a biologist with the
National Audubon Society, that their numbers had dwindled to new lows
(Allen, 1952). As their established habitats contracted and vanished, the
cranes migrated farther and farther to the north and to the south in search
of new territories. Blackjack Peninsula on the south Texas coast in Aransas
and Refugio counties thus became their wintering grounds. Their summer
range was in northern Canada, its precise location then unknown. A few
non-migratory Whooping Cranes subsisted in south-western Louisiana.
To protect the remaining migratory Whooping Cranes and other birds
and mammals, the Aransas National Wildlife Refuge was established in
1937 as wintering grounds. In 1941, 21 wild cranes were counted: 15 of
them spent the winter at Aransas, and six others, of the non-migratory
flock, in Louisiana.
The summer nesting grounds at Wood Buffalo National Park, North-
West Territories, Canada, was finally pinpointed in 1954. However, even
today not all of the nesting sites have been located. Some Whooping
Cranes may be spending part of the summer in some years in Manitoba
(Boothroyd, 1980).
Research and management efforts
Knowing the summer and winter Whooping Crane areas prompted res-
earch and management efforts. It was now known that the remaining wild
flock travelled 2,500 miles (4,050 kilometres) which took approximately
16 days, twice a year. In one year, the cranes fly 5,200 miles (8,424 kilo-
metres) and spend 32 days or more along the perilous flyway. The possi-
bility of establishing eventually a shorter migration route was already in
the minds of many who were worried about the cranes' endurance and
safety.
Although the number of cranes did increase from 15 in 1941 to 24 in
1956, this was hardly encouraging news. Indeed, it prompted a conference
in Washington, D.C., of American and Canadian conservationists and biolo-
gists to discuss the fate of the cranes. It was here that the Whooping Crane
Advisory Group was formed. By then, the non-migratory cranes in Loui-
siana had disappeared (Maroldo, 1980). Discussion at the conference
centred around a highly controversial management proposal: breeding
Whooping Cranes in captivity. Conservationists were concerned about
removing young cranes from the wild for attempts at captive breeding
because numbers were so low (Ricciuti, 1979).

The proposal, however, was accepted in 1961 with one change. Erick-
son's (1976) recommendations on egg-taking, transport, artificial incuba-
tion, hatching and rearing procedures were initiated on Sandhill Cranes
Grus canadensis rather than Whooping Cranes. About this time, the
Whooping Crane Conservation Association was formed and dedicated to
crane survival as a species (Scott, 1976).
Egg-man ipulation
Because of the encouraging results with Sandhill Cranes, successful
procedures were transferred to Whooping Cranes in 1965, with the es-
tablishment by the Bureau of Sport, Fisheries and Wildlife of the En-
dangered Wildlife Research Station at Patuxent near Laurel, Maryland
(Erickson, 1968).
It was ascertained that a wild Sandhill Crane egg could be successfully
removed from a clutch of two, and sent to Patuxent for hatching. A
joint proposal by the Canadian Wildlife Service and the United States
Fish and Wildlife Service, employing this strategy with Whooping Cranes,
was launched in 1967. Accordingly, eggs removed from Wood Buffalo
would be sent to Patuxent for the study of life processes, notably hatch-
ing and rearing. From 1967 to 1974, when the procedure was discontinued
50 eggs were removed from the wild, and 41 chicks hatched. Of this
number, 18 birds were lost in the first six months, and five lost in adult
plumage (Kepler, 1978). There were similar losses with Sandhill Cranes
at Patuxent over the years (Carpenter, Locke and Miller, 1976). However
some Sandhill and Whooping Cranes have reached maturity in captivity
and are producing eggs. As yet, no female Whooping Crane has mated
naturally, all fertile eggs are produced by artificial insemination (Note 1).
The Foundation
Worldwide realisation of the plight of many cranes in the early 1970's
led to the inauguration of the International Crane Foundation in Baraboo,
Wisconsin. Its objectives to ensure the survival of cranes are research,
habitat preservation, captive propagation, restocking and public education.

Concerted efforts on the part of the American and Canadian govern-
ments and others over the years produced a gradual increase in Whooping
Crane numbers. Two main sources of danger troubled the experts: (i) a
catastrophe at either the winter or summer grounds could devastate the
wild flock; (ii) still another could be equally disastrous along the migration

fly way. In the spring of 1975 a bold experiment was undertaken to ad-
dress these concerns. The solution was later to become known as the Sand-
hill Crane Experiment. The plan was to remove Whooping Crane eggs from
wild nests in Canada, and from captive nests at Patuxent, and place them
with nesting Sandhill pairs at Grays Lake National Wildlife Refuge, Idaho.
Sandhills migrate with their young every fall from Grays Lake to Bosque
del Apache National Wildlife Refuge, New Mexico, a distance of 870 miles
(1,409 kilometres). It was hoped that young Whooping Cranes reared by
Sandhills would migrate with their foster-parents and, as nesting pairs,
locate permanently in the Rocky Mountain region. This plan further enab-
led scientists to place identifying leg bands on young cranes for record
and study (Drewien and Kuyt, 1979).
The first Whooping Crane to migrate south with its Sandhill foster-
parents was called "Corny", because of its atypical love of grain, otherwise
absent from the natural diet of Whooping Cranes.
Progress in the programme has been slow, but rewarding. By late au-
tumn 1980, 20 Whooping Cranes migrated from Grays Lake to Bosque del
Apache. Three of these have not, as yet, been accounted for on the winter
range, but they may be alive elsewhere (Note 2).
Central fly way
To protect the Wood Buffalo-Aransas flock along the hazardous fly-
way, a migration monitoring programme was set up in 1975, and the area
was designated Critical Habitat in 1978. More protection plans are antici-
pated in the future (Note 3).
Recovery plan
The final draft of the Whooping Crane Recovery Plan, developed by a
recovery team since 1975, was approved in 1980. Its primary objective is
to remove this crane from the endangered species list. A secondary objec-
tive is to insure 40 or more nesting pairs in the Wood Buffalo-Aransas
flock and 20 or more nesting pairs in the Rocky Mountain flock (Note 4).

A NOTE ON THE TEPUI PARROTLET
Nannopsittaca panychlora
By E.P. McLOUGHLIN (Co. Kilkenny)
Some field notes on this rarely-observed parrot, with its strange habitat,
may be of interest to readers since none has apparently been previously
published. These notes were related to me in Georgetown, Guyana, in
1973 by Adrian Thompson, the veteran Guyanese explorer. He encoun-
tered this species on one of the earlier unsuccessful (pre-1973) attempts to
scale the precipitous cliff face of Mount Roraima* at the boundary of
Guyana with neighbouring Brazil and Venezuela.
On this occasion a base camp was established at 7,000 feet. Above it
the mountain rose almost sheer for 1,800 feet to the summit.
The birds could be heard at this point each morning and evening mov-
ing to and from their feeding grounds in the forest below. In their journey
from one altitude to another the birds passed through the cumulous cloud
level. Almost continual cloud and mist prevented these observers from
actually seeing the birds whose numbers were, in consequence, hard to
estimate but Thompson felt that they might possibly have run into thou-

sands judging by the level of calling heard as they went by. Below the
cloud level the air again became clear before the forest canopy was reach-
ed. On one morning when the summit was clear above them and the
clouds below more dense than hitherto, the passage of the birds was noti-
ceably later than usual.
Thompson did not actually see the birds roosting but wondered if they
were using the crevices in the sandstone cliff for this purpose.
In the latter part of October and the beginning of November 1973,
when the joint Guyanese-British team sponsored by the Observer news-
paper made the first successful ascent of the cliffs of Roraima, Hamish
Maclnnes was able to throw some further light on this species.
He described, in the Observer , a stage in the ascent at a point about
700 feet from the summit, and commented, "Our high point for the day
was a ledge 8 inches wide with a superb miniature garden hanging from it
inhabited by green parrots".
In a personal communique he amplified this note as follows: "There
was a particular 'nest' that I observed for many hours being only 3 feet
from it. The 'nest' was about 5 feet long and about 2 feet in diameter and
was made up of living plants which had formed a kind of basket. The
'nest' hung free below a very big overhang and was in a fairly exposed
place. The birds returned to this 'nest' just before dusk ..... and used to
chirp away for a while before settling in for the night."
It was possible for Maclnnes on occasion to follow the flight of the
flocks visually and in fact he saw them on a number of occasions. "The
birds used to fly in groups of about fifteen to twenty and swoop around
the cliff, descending to about 5,000 feet on the El Dorado Ridge. There
would be very animated chirruping as they swept past."
During a brief visit (of a few hours) spent on the summit by day,
there was no sign of this species, as might have been expected.
Summary
Considered by Mayr and Phelps to be "an old element and a very distinct
species endemic to the Southern Highlands of Venezuela, also found in
N.E. Venezuela at Sucre", the Tepui Parrotlet descends over 3,000 ft each
day from its roosts on cliffs near the summit of Mount Roraima to its
feeding grounds in the forests which lie at its base.
Proof of its nesting in the mountain roosts was not obtained.
My grateful thanks are due to Adrian Thompson, and to Hamish Mac-
lnnes and the Observer newspaper..

Over the years I have kept and bred many kinds of exotic birds and
have thereby had considerable opportunity to study their behaviour under
captive conditions.
Birds are individuals and it is, naturally, essential to know and under-
stand their characters and environmental and dietary needs in order that
they should thrive under controlled conditions. In isolation or other
unnatural environments in which they are sometimes kept, deviations in
character occur just as in humans, and especially in their close association
with humans, when they are treated as pets.
I would like to quote just a few cases that I have experienced of bird
imprinting and the methods used to normalise their behaviour and to re-
introduce them into associations with their own kind.
Waterfowl imprint on hatching and this can cause problems later on,
when maturity is reached, if they are hand-reared, or foster-parented under
a hen, or reared with other species. This association causes deviation in
behavioural development which sometimes becomes extreme on reaching
maturity and the breeding state.

Case 1.
A Blue Snow gander Anser caerulescens whose history was unknown
would not pair to another Snow Goose, but would readily pair and break
up a mated pair of Barnacle Geese. He would foster-father a brood of
ducklings and protect the duck and her brood from all opposition, and this
year he fosterfathered two orphaned Black Swans of approximately 2 Yl
months old until they were fully grown, and they, in turn, gladly and fully
accepted his role as protector. His problem probably started when he
arrived in the Mitchell Park, Durban, as a mate to an adult Snow Goose
(female) who dominated him and on reaching maturity he was still afraid
of this goose. Another goose was obtained and this time the roles were
reversed and he was decidedly aggressive towards her, displaying a mixture
of territorial protection and a "hang-up" from his relationship with the
other goose.
The goose came into lay in the spring after a year of close association
in a small paddock on their own - he was more tolerant towards her and I
was hoping that, when the goose was receptive to mating, the final aggres-
sion would disappear. Unfortunately, this was not the case and he attacked
her on the nest causing an internal rupture and she died. The fully-devel-
oped egg was removed and put under a broody hen, but was not fertile.
A further two Snow Geese were obtained on loan - a possible pair, pre-
viously kept again in isolation for three years or so from any other Snow
Geese and which later turned out to be females. The gander was running
with these two geese for several months when the two young Black Swans
were introduced into the paddock, when he immediately took over the
cygiets and drove off the female Snow Geese. He was very vocal in his
protection of the cygnets. Meanwhile the two new Snow Geese still be-
haved as a pair, having developed this bond in isolation over the years.
A further pair of Blue Snow Geese were obtained and this time proved
to be a normal mated gander and goose and these were now added to the
group of the aggressive gander and the "paired" females. For some time, as
could be expected, they kept in their separate groupings and, in order to
stir the relationships up, I separated the aggressive gander and the more
feminine of the paired females into another enclosure within hearing but
not within sight of the remaining three. The two females called constantly
to each other, but after three weeks or so I noticed the new gander taking
an interest in the pair bond female remaining with him. To reduce the
stress and noise between the pair bond females, I put her and the aggress-
ive gander back into an enclosure next door to the other three. There was
immediately a great deal of aggressive vocal interplay between the two

groups, with the newest gander showing a great deal of preferential solici-
tude toward the pair bond female he was with, much to the annoyance of
his own mate. Two weeks later this pair bond female made a scrape and
laid four eggs - unfortunately in a very sunny exposed spot and I replaced
them with dummy eggs and put the other eggs under a hen.
With all the hullabaloo and social disturbance (the goose that laid had
been with the aggressive gander for nearly a year and showed a slight inter-
est in him; also the mated female showed jealous tendencies towards the
new gander's preference) I could not hope that the eggs would be fertile.
To my delight a gosling hatched under the hen. I had to remove the new
gander, his mate and the goose that laid (which incidentally was the male
looking of the pair bond females) and they were released into the main
duck pond with other geese and ducks, and it is of interest to note that
a trio-bond has been formed and that they keep very much together in
their new home.
The pen where the aggressive gander and the one goose remained was
divided and the bantam and gosling were introduced. There was no interest
shown by the gander in the gosling, for I was hoping that his strong pater-
nal interests would come to the fore once again and he would rear the
gosling, thus avoiding a repetition of the social disorder I had experienced
to date. When the gosling was two months old, I removed the division and
allowed the bantam foster mother and gosling to associate with the two
adult Snow Geese. The aim now, since I had one unsociable gander (anti-
female), one female pair bond female (anti-male), and one single gosling,
was to form a family unit and in so doing to cure all three of their social
imbalance. There was not much interest shown between the Snow Geese
and gosling and after two weeks I removed the bantam. The gosling
showed only a little distress but I noticed the Snow Goose female showing
an interest in the gosling when it made distress calls; now after another
two weeks they are inseparable and she is aggressive towards the other
ducks and shelgeese if they approach the gosling. The gander continues to
ignore the youngster, but shows minimum aggression towards it but he is
now fully in moult, which state would reduce his reactions.
Out of the five Snow Geese, I now have a fully integrated trio, with
good prospects for breeding, a rehabilitated goose and a gosling brought up
as a Snow Goose with good future prospects for normal behaviour. There
is still one uncertain individual in the aggressive gander who is now toler-
ant towards the foster goose and gosling and who might make another
family group.

Case 2
Ducks also form strange bonds, especially if reared with other species
or isolated from their own species during a breeding season. There was a
case of a Chiloe Wigeon drake Anas sibilatrix whose own duck died and a
replacement Chiloe duck took three months to obtain. Meanwhile in
associating with Rosy-bill Ducks he paired to an unmated female Rosy-bill.
When the Chiloe Widgeon duck was introduced he made a few head-
-bobbings and then swam off with the Rosy-bill. He was then isolated with
his own duck onto another pond for eight months and seemed completely
rehabilitated. He was re-introduced back onto the main pond, where
within ten minutes he disassociated from his own duck who followed him
around while he searched for an unpaired Rosy-bill duck, and having
found one, he followed her everywhere; while searching he attempted to
mate with paired Rosy-bill females.
Case 3
Changed behaviour patterns experienced in parrots and cockatoos are
usually due to their being kept in complete isolation from their own kind
with human companionship instead. Thus, when confronted with another
of their own or other species of whatever sex, the reaction is aggression.
If both are removed and put into a completely new environment, indiffer-
ence takes the place of aggression in the attitude towards the new compan-
ion. I have experienced several cases (with Grey Parrots and cockatoos)
where, after periods of a year or two, in outdoor conditions with the
human influence removed and with nesting facilities available, after per-
iods of twenty years in cages, they have been rehabilitated - having paired
up, mated and produced broods.
In every case when normalising is effective, they (in the case of males)
have become fearlessly aggressive towards their erstwhile human compan-
ions. In two cases, after having been caged for fifteen to twenty years, al-
though they have paired up and reared broods of youngsters, they have
never tried to regain their powers of flight but walk all over their outdoor
aviaries, and again this refers to a Grey Parrot cock and a Lesser Sulphur-
crested Cockatoo cock.
There is one case of a talking Greater Sulphur-crested Cockatoo which,
apart from never attempting to fly, has also lost its power of talking in
cockatoo language and is more fluent speaking English; it only reverts to
cockatoo shrieks when upset or annoyed.
In conclusion, it is interesting to note that three species of arctic-
breeding geese have successfully bred in this sub-tropical climate in Durban.

BREEDING NOTES FOR MY COLLECTION OF AMAZONA PARROTS
FOR 1980
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.9894346" page_id="56284234"  page_num="146" year="" vol="">
By D.T. SPILSBURY (Welland, Malvern)
Thirty-two couples and trios of Amazona were given nest boxes for the
1980 breeding season. The birds had been paired by watching behavioural
patterns, by limited natural selection within a group of a given species and
by noting head and mandible differences - all rather hit or miss!
I suppose that laparoscopy, the modern sexing technique, will increas-
ingly become the accepted method of sexing monomorphic species but I
have not used the method yet for I worry about the pre- and post-opera-
tive stress factor.
My 1980 notes are concerned with both failure and success but there is
little point here in writing about the pairs that did not get beyond nest
preparation. The reasons for these failures can be either simple or com-
plex. Age, either immature or too ancient, incompatibility, incorrect
sexing or poor management are all factors that must be overcome in future
years.
Included in this first failure category are Amazona a. aestiva, A.a. xan-
thopteryx, A. albifrons nana, A. amazonica, A. autumnalis lilacina, A. far-
inosa, A. festiva , A. ventralis and A. vinacea and also additional pairs of
the following species and races.
The second category embraces those pairs and trios (three birds of a
species housed together in an attempt to form a pair and all relatively
young birds) that produced eggs. All eggs within this group were infertile
and it may well be that my assumed males are not quite what they seem
to be.
A. collaria laid four eggs, two from the same position on a perch, two
were laid in the nest and incubated. One egg was misshapen, the others
were variable in profile and measured 32 mm x 25 mm.
Two pairs of A. ochrocephala oratrix laid. Pair A were the major dis-
appointment of the year for in 1979 they had infertile eggs and again this
year they laid two separate clutches of three and three in May and July.
Pair B laid three eggs. Six eggs were measured and the range was between
37 mm and 42 mm length x 30 mm and 32 mm width. The smaller eggs
and the most variable in profile were laid by the female of pair B, a young-
er bird.
One pair and a trio of A. finschi laid three eggs and four eggs respec-

lively. I believe that within the trio two females laid for when brooding
began, two birds were always in the nest. Regular examination of the
nest always revealed the four eggs to be in pairs, well separated. The
pair's eggs were 35 mm x 28 mm, 36 mm x 28 mm, and 37 mm x 27
mm. Three eggs from the trio survived; they measured 37 mm x 29 mm,
38 mm x 29 mm and 40 mm x 30 mm. Profile was variable but three were
ovate.
One pair and a trio of A. a. autumnalis laid eggs throughout early sum-
mer but managed to break them with the exception of one egg laid by the
female of the pair. This measured 38 mm x 29 mm and was ovate.
The third category consists of the pairs that produced young and this
year all young that hatched were reared to independence. Six was the total
and, whilst not spectacular, it gives encouragement.
I am ashamed to admit that one of these pairs, a male A aestiva paired
to a female A.o. panamensis, have produced and reared in exemplary fash-
ion their hybrid young. I loathe the haphazard production of hybrids that
many aviculturists indulge in and am not a little embarrassed to find that I
am guilty of lowering my own standards.
This pair of birds came from the collection of the late Mrs. N. Howard
and had been housed together and had formed a strong pair bond. They
were separated immediately with the intention of breeding with specimens
of their own kind. I have been unable to obtain other panamensis and
the aestiva attacked four assumed females in the past three years. The fe-
male panamensis has laid eggs each year and despite separation, out of
sight of each other, the two birds have always recognised one another's
calls, despite the cacophony of Amazona sounds.
The male was at some time a talking pet and is quite the most savage
creature on the property, far worse that the three Dobermanns! Indeed I
have considered flying the bird at such quarry as the pony riders who des-
troy the verges in this part of the world but since the bird so loathes me, it
would be imprudent of me to give it free-flying advantage.
I relented this year very late in the spring and the birds rejoiced in each
other's company, mated, nested, laid four eggs, incubated and hatched the
two fertile eggs and reared them. Hatching was 28 days after the first night
of incubation (which began after the second egg was laid). The first
youngster left the nest at 59 days but returned at night. Three days later
the second bird left the nest and neither young returned.
The female laid again whilst the young were in the nest. Six eggs were
laid but only one survived; it was ovate and measured 36 mm x 29 mm.

D.T. SPILSBURY - BREEDING NOTES
One of the pairs of A.a. salvini nested and laid three eggs but I was not
able to determine length of incubation or indeed see the young until eight
days after hatching. This was due to the female's extreme caution on leav-
ing the box and rapid return to it if I attempted to examine the nest.
Hatching could be ascertained by the very vociferous young.
The young of the three pairs of Amazona that hatched were all very
vociferous soon after birth, being both nidicolous and psilopaedic. It is
interesting that all chicks soon after birth could be heard clearly from
within nine metres of the nest; also that the young called in unison. I
would have thought that the young calling in the wild would have created
enormous problems for their survival from predators. This nestling calling
lasts some fourteen days after which the young remain fairly quiet within
the nest, unless disturbed.
The pair reared until about twenty days when it became apparent that
they were being fickle in their food selection for the young. Over the next
five days they stopped feeding soaked Purina dog chow, brown bread
soaked with milk and a nectar mixture, fruit and the soaked seed and
beans. The adults always had a preference for dry peanuts and despite
soaked peanuts being available, they carried the dry peanuts to their
shallow drinker, hulled them and chewed them together with water into a
rough paste which they fed to the young for two days. On the twenty-fifth
day no food was taken and in the evening the three young were removed
for handrearing.
Having handreared parrakeets of the genus Neophema from a few days
old, Amazona are simply reared providing one is prepared for the disci-
plines of the task.
The young were removed to a room heated to 90*F and housed in a
box from which direct light was excluded. Absorbent paper was the floor
covering and this was changed after each feed. I favour a modified tea-
spoon rather than a syringe but did use the latter when time was short.
We all borrow from the successful experience of earlier and contem-
porary aviculturists and I would like to pay tribute here to the Rev. Ram-
on Noegel and John Stoodley who, working respectively with Amazona
and Pionus have achieved standards we must all aim for and it is comfort-
ing to be able to consult their writings and, in John Stoodley's case, to
be able to telephone.
Thus the dietary needs of the handreared young were based on the diets
used by Noegel and Stoodley and listed as follows (these ingredients are
blended to a rough powder to which hot water is added):

Mashed banana and stewed apple, sweetened with a little honey, and
grated cuttle fish 'bone' were added to each meal. A vitamin and trace
element compound was given once a day and twice a week a pinch of grit
was added.
I did not stick to a rigid formula and added Finely-chopped spinach
beet and dandelion leaves, a nectar mixture and soaked Purina dog chow
and various pulped summer fruits. It is most important to feed the mixture
warmed to an acceptable level to suit the young parrots for they will not
accept cold food. I found that four feeds a day (8 am, 1 pm, 6 pm and
midnight)at this age prevented fresh food from being added to a large resi-
due from an earlier feeding within the crop.
The salvini young progressed well; they resisted feeding from 50 days
after hatching and were seen peering out of their box at 56 days. At 65
days the young climbed out of their 'nest' and were placed in a cage where
they perched straight away. Flight was first observed two days later and
the examination of soaked seed began at once. At 70 days three meals
were fed and at 80 the birds were fed morning and night. A 'tutor' at some
stage after 65 days would, I feel, have cut the weaning period. However, I
am pleased with their progress although they are slightly behind the
development of the hybrid young, due, I feel, to the period of parental
neglect.
The young are smaller than their parents but differ in appearance
slightly. The young leave the nest with black striations on the upper man-
dible which, like the lower mandible, is a whitish-yellow. The lilac blue of
the crown and occiput is much paler and the iris darker than in the adults.
In mid-May the female of a pair of A. viridigenalis laid a single egg
which had been broken within the nest before the month was out. The
female laid again on 6th June, began incubation on 9th June and the single
egg hatched on 2nd July. The egg was unusual in that it was a long oval in
profile and quite different in shape to the earlier egg and all other eggs
laid by related species.
Parental care of the young bird was left to the female and, unlike the
other breeding males, the male viridigenalis did not feed the female nor

roost within the box at night. The female fed only soaked mixed seed and
began *to neglect the bird for long periods. On 2nd August the young bird
was removed from the nest when blood was discovered on it and within
the nest. The bird was very cold, clammy to the touch and almost white in
colour. Closer examination revealed that the bird was stunted for its age
(no feather sheaves on the wings at 32 days) was bleeding from the mouth
and had extensive bruising on both sides of the lower neck. The growth
development was curiously one-sided. The left tibia was shorter than the
right, and the whole left foot was swollen badly, giving the effect of ves-
tigial toe development. The crop contained four large pieces of soaked
peanut (presumed).
The first task was to bring heat and sustenance to the bird. We fed it
by a dropper for it could not raise its head to take from a spoon, and
gave a very liquid and honey-sweetened mixture every two hours. This in
itself caused worry for the bleeding began each time we fed. The following
morning the bird was discovered in its small padded nest well covered in
blood but the eyes were open and its body colour had returned to the
normal salmon pink.
After three days the bleeding had stopped and food was being taken
from the spoon in the normal way. At this point we became worried
about the large particles which had not cleared the crop. Attempts at
tube clearance failed and I was not prepared to operate on the crop in
order to remove the solid matter as I felt that the bird could not accept
further stress. At 38 days the solid pieces had dispersed and the feeding
became as for the salvini. At 46 days the feather sheaves were at last
obvious and the one-sided look was no longer apparent. At 60 days the
bird climbed out of its box, a very small replica of the adult.
The collection of Amazona species here does not contain any that
is particularly endangered as yet but in this world of man's dominance
the need to change and exploit natural habitats will result in the reduction
of common and rare species alike. Aviculturists, whether private amateurs
or professionals in zoological collections, have a duty to preserve wildlife
through captive breeding and the techniques of successful breeding and
rearing should be recorded for others and improved upon. With Amazona
breeding in mind, particularly the endangered species, improved tech-
niques will make it possible to increase the number of young reared each
year by the removal of first clutches for artificial incubation and rearing,
thus allowing a second fertile clutch.

by modem standards, must be improved upon and I aim to establish six
breeding pairs of each species. There is no useful object served in just
keeping birds and as many of the serious zoos and bird gardens are now
attempting to keep fewer species but in larger numbers of pairs and
groups, so must the private aviculturist become more responsible. We
must stop squandering the lives of the thousands of exotic birds that
pass through our hands.
I am a firm believer in the conservation of a species within its natural
habitat and no joy compares with the sight and sound of a group of
Amazona exploiting their natural world. However, in the twenty or so
years that I have been interested in the genus, and despite the umbrella
of protection held by the international conservation bodies, the species
of Amazona are becoming rarer, one after the other, and in real terms very
little is being done to reverse this trend.
I feel very strongly that the greatest threat to the continued survival of
endangered Amazona species is not the violent acts of nature, vanishing
natural habitat or the shooting and trapping by illegal methods, but
rather the uncompromising attitude by conservation bodies and, in partic-
ular, their controlling experts against captive breeding.
Do we have to wait until every species numbers less than one hundred,
like Amazona vittata whilst under the 'protection' of the U.S.A., before
desperate measures include aviculture?
Not all genera can be helped by captivity,but the genus Amazona does
breed in confinement and I am convinced that no species within the genus
would fail to respond to captive conservation. But it is important that such
a programme of captive breeding is attempted with young taken from wild
nests and handreared, and not with trapped adult birds.
It is improbable, of course, that captive-reared young could be estab-
lished back in the wild unless fertile eggs or young could be deposited in
wild nests. But as I see it, the choice is between the aviary or the museum.
I am becoming a militant aviculturist but why not? I have a duty, like
everyone else who cares to see that the other living things on earth survive
and prosper under the ever increasing influence of civilised man.

Charmosyna papou goliathina
By Dr. W.D. Russell (Bryanston, South Africa)
Two pairs of this species were imported from Belgium during June,
1978. The birds arrived in excellent condition and were soon acclimatised
to their South African conditions. They were kept indoors for three
months because they had arrived in our mid-winter.
During the spring of 1978 the pairs were placed outdoors in separate
aviaries measuring 6 ft high x 12 ft long x 3 ft wide. Two nest boxes were
supplied, one a wooden "grandfather clock" type box, 18 ins high x 9 ins
square, and a natural log nest of similar measurements. The pairs settled
down in the aviary fairly quickly, but were never seen to enter the nests
supplied.
The diet consisted of a nectar made from diluted commercial honey
(non-purified), Complan (a milk substitute powder) and condensed milk.
Apple was fed, although very little was taken. The birds did not seem over-
fond of any fruit although various fruits were tried. A baby cereal mixed
with the nectar was also supplied and the birds ate very little of this more
solid food. A vitamin and mineral mixture was added to the nectar twice
weekly.
During March 1979, when I was overseas in USA, I had the misfortune
to loose one cock and one hen from the two pairs from a severe bacterial
enteritis. On my return, I tried to pair the remaining two birds. Unfor-
tunately the cock persecuted the hen unmercifully and she had to be re-
moved. She later died and I was unable to diagnose the cause despite all
the various laboratory tests performed.
During May 1980, on a visit to England, I had the fortune to purchase a
hen. This hen, once she had been through quarantine and had settled down
in an outdoor aviary, was introduced to the cock. The pair appeared to
take to one another from first sight and the cock was very attentive to
her.
During the spring of 1980, the "grandfather" box was removed and a
natural log nest, placed in a semi-horizontal position, was introduced.
During October 1980, the birds were seen to enter the nest and spend long
periods of the day together in the nest and the first chick hatched on
2nd December, 1980. There was tremendous excitement in the aviary that
day and the cock spent most of the day flying restlessly up and down,
calling and showing aggression every time anyone approached the aviary.

This led me to believe that the eggs had hatched so the nest was checked
when the opportunity presented itself. A day later the second egg hatched.
The chicks were covered in grey down and appeared very strong.
The chicks were reared exclusively on the nectar for the first 14 days
and only during the third week was apple and a little baby cereal taken.
At this stage pin feathers appeared on the chicks. The chicks grew rapidly
and as they grew so more fruit and baby cereal was taken. Eventually, on
20th January, 1981, the first chick left the nest followed two days later by
the second. The chicks' plumage resembled that of the adults and they were
virtually the same size as adults. The only difference noted between chicks
and adults at first glance was the dark eye and dark beaks.
The chicks flew strongly from the first day and for the first night slept
in the nest with the parents. Thereafter they slept on the perch and were
never seen to enter the nest after this time.
The chicks are two cocks and are especially fond of apple and cereal,
which the parents do not seem all that partial to. At the moment, the
parents do not seem to be all that interested in the nest and do not look as
though they are going to lay again this season.

Tauraco c. corythaix x T.c. livingstonii
By Dr. W.D. Russell (Bryanston, South Africa)
Initially a pair of surgically sexed Livingstone's Louries were housed in
a large planted aviary measuring 20 ft x 10 ft x 8 ft high. The pair were ex-
tremely incompatible and the female always avoided the male's attentions,
even attacking him on occasions. Later in the summer of 1980 a Knysna
Lourie male was introduced to the hen and she settled down and accepted
her new mate immediately.
The hen built a nest in a small wicker dog basket using small twigs and
finally lining the nest with small branches of a fir tree, which was planted
in the aviary. Three eggs were laid and incubation started immediately
after the first egg was laid. The male and female alternated in the incuba-
tion process which lasted 23 days. Only one chick hatched and the other
two eggs were later found to contain dead chicks.
The chick grew extremely rapidly and was fed initially on sweetened
baby cereal and fruit (grapes, paw-paw and apple). Later, soaked sultanas,
bananas and strawberries were fed, with the parents then feeding soaked
dog biscuits which were refused when the chick hatched. During the third
week the chick was feathering up very rapidly and was extremely aggres-
sive to my examination of the nest.
After 32 days the chick left the nest and flew quite strongly although
it never wandered very far from the nest but spent most of the day sitting
perched on the side of the nest calling for food.
This breeding was extremely rewarding due to the tameness of the
parents who allowed me to inspect the nest regularly and were never really
concerned when one entered the aviary. Once again, the compatibility of
the pair proved just how necessary this is to successful breeding.

UNUSUAL NEST SITE CONSTRUCTION
BY CAPTIVE BUDGERIGARS
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.964378472222222" page_id="56284243"  page_num="155" year="" vol="">
By ANNE B. CLARK, PATRICIA C. ARROWOOD
and SHERRY STEMBERGER
(University of California, Davis, USA)
In two flocks of captive Budgerigars Melopsittacus undulatus housed
outside year round, females in breeding condition, as evidenced by cere
colour and some copulatory behaviour, not only excavated long tunnels
in two by four inch vertical wooden cage supports, but also dug holes
in the ground. This is&amp;apos;remarkable for several reasons.
Budgerigars in their natural breeding habitat in Australia utilize holes
in various species of Eucalyptus and Acacia as nest sites. Usually the nest
holes are in dead, or partly dead, but still standing trees (Wyndham, 1978);
occasionally they are in fallen trees or toppled stumps. Budgerigars have
also been reported to nest among the roots of the Mallee shrub (Bennett,
1961). In captivity, the "domestic" Budgerigar readily uses nest boxes
of varying dimensions.
The holes used by wild Budgerigars are either excavated by other
animals or are naturally occurring, as when a branch has broken off and
a knot hole rotted out (Wyndham, 1978). They are not reported to exca-
vate their own holes as do several other species of the family Psittacidae
(see table 1). Nor do they in captivity excavate their own tunnels and nest
cavities in logs as do, for instance, the species Brotogeris of South Amer-
ica (Arrowood, personal observation; Hardy, 1963; Power, 1967). Breeders
report that Budgerigars do not extensively chew the inside of wooden
nest boxes or cups therein, though they often chew around the entrance
hole. Our two flocks of Budgerigars are housed in adjacent large 10 by 20
foot outdoor cages. Both cages have natural earth floors in which a variety
of grasses grow seasonally. One flock of 11 birds includes five experienced
breeding females and six experienced males, all of which raised one to
three clutches between May and October 1979. The second flock of 16
birds consists of 10 female and six male offspring from the 1979 clutches
of the experienced flock. Nest boxes were removed from the experienced
flock in October 1979. The young flock had no nest boxes since they
were removed from the parental flock (and boxes) four to six weeks after
fledging.
We observed courtship behaviour among members of the young flock
throughout November, December 1979 and January 1980. During this

interval they formed, broke and reformed pair associations. The females'
ceres darkened over this period and took on the "scaly" appearance
characteristic of breeding birds. The experienced flock showed a post-
nesting decline (subsequent to October 1979) in active courtship behavi-
our and females' ceres paled through December 1979. They also then
resumed active courtship and ceres darkened in February 1980.
In January 1980, young females, two in particular, began chewing
a cavity in an old but unrotted wooden two by four inch horizontal beam
of their cage. They managed to excavate a long (16-18 inch) tunnel into
which they could totally disappear. They gnawed the wood with their
beaks and sometimes backed out of the cavity entrance to drop chips.
Subsequently, they began cavities in two more places in the two by four
inch beams. No males were observed excavating although they often
sat nearby while a female associate chewed. The same group of females
worked all the sites. These females had not formed permanent pair associ-
ations with males although their ceres were quite brown.
We then observed females in the experienced flock - who had similarly
been chewing and making tunnel-holes in cardboard covering part of a
roosting box - investigating depressions around the edges of a large plastic
rubbish bin that was turned upside down on the earth floor of the cage.
(Food was placed on top of such a can in each cage to deter mice.) They
used their bills to clear larger holes under the edge and were observed daily
digging holes through which they could force their bodies under the can.
The digging techniques entailed pulling dirt toward them with their
beaks in a scraping motion while sitting with heads toward the rim and
breasts pressed onto the ground. Several scrapes with the beak were then
followed by backward kicking/scratching motions of the feet to clear
the dirt from under them. As the bird scratched with one foot, it held
the wing on that side loosely out and leaned away from the foot used.
It would then resume scraping (and lifting) dirt out of the furthest inward
extension of the hole. Birds successfully made entrances to the space
under the can.
After the can was moved so the birds could not get under without
making new holes, two females were observed eyeing small depressions
in the dirt and then scraping these out with their bills, apparently attempt-
ing to make burrows directly into the ground. Soon after this behaviour
was noted in the experienced flock, females in the young flock began
burrowing in the same manner.
Although none succeeded in making a nest size chamber directly into
the ground, one experienced female burrowed under the can and, in a

slight depression underneath, laid two eggs. Her mate never entered but
stayed outside in the vicinity of the can, either perched on top, on a
nearby branch, or right on the ground.
In the young flock, one female in particular twice constructed long
(approximately 18 inch) tunnels under a small metal can right side up on
the earth. These tunnels were just large enough to admit her as she squir-
med through. She never made a cup-like depression. However, as we
moved the can when she had worked on it only two days, it is possible
she would have. This female had not formed a clear pair bond with a male
at the time but did so soon after.
Another young female successfully completed and regularly used two
entrances to the upside, down can, spending one to four minutes at a time
underneath. She was then courted by a young male who already had a
female associate. She reciprocated. He finally switched his courting and
attention completely to her and would walk back and forth, fluff and
preen in front of, and peer into the entrances just as males do to nest box
entrances.
For reasons pertaining to other aspects of our study, nest boxes were
first provided in the 1980 breeding season in March. Within minutes of
boxes being given to the experienced flock, females were fighting over
them. Only the female who had laid under the can continued to show
some interest in that site. She did not begin to defend a nest box and
often sat on the can or peered through a tiny hole in the top. This may
be due to her having laid there, although the eggs were removed.
The young female in the inexperienced flock also did not desert her
nest site when nest boxes were provided. She laid and incubated an infer-
tile clutch under the can. The young male who had been courting her
switched his attentions to a female with a nest box. In spite of nest boxes
being available and no males attending her, she laid a second infertile
clutch under the can. We then transferred her to another flock.
Psittacines in general use enclosed nests. Most Australian psittacines
use natural cavities in Eucalyptus. In Table 1 we summarize data for the
subfamily Psittacinae on those species known to excavate their own
nests, nest in logs lying on the ground or actually nest in cavities in the
ground. Eleven species are known (or suspected) to excavate their own
nests, which may be in the ground, in termite nests, in tussocks, or in
trees. Seven species are known to nest in the ground, although probably
only four of these do so regularly (Antipodes Green Parakeet, Red-fronted
Parakeet, Ground Parrot, Night Parrot). Harrison (1973) reported one
instance of a Sulphur-crested Cockatoo Cacatua galerita excavating a
cavity in the earth floor of an aviary.

As pointed out earlier, Budgerigars are not reported either to excavate
their own holes or ever to dig their own holes in the ground. Presumably,
ground nests would be risky due to snake, lizard or small mammal preda-
tion. Our observations and the data summarised in Table 1 suggest that
Australian psittacines may well be capable of nest burrow construction
when normal nest sites are unavailable. At least, behaviour patterns suffi-
cient to do so exist in Budgerigars. That these small birds are not reported
constructing ground nests in the wild may be due to a combination of
factors, including availability of nest holes, concentration of ground pred-
ators, soils harder and drier than the soft moist earth in our cages or a
lack of observers in the right place at the right time.

By GEOFFREY KENYON (Wokingham, Berkshire)
When our Editor asked me to write an article for the Magazine on
plants for aviaries, I decided to tackle the subject in two sections. Firstly
broad principles, and secondly a suggested list of suitable plant material.
My profession as a nurseryman and landscape gardener no doubt influ-
ences my approach to the subject. In garden design I have always striven to
create a mood and achieve a harmonious blending with the surroundings.
I have become over the years ever more convinced that this harmony can
only be achieved by the creation of "plant associations", that is, plants
adapted by nature to particular environments. It is with this in mind that
I suggest aviculturists take a really critical look at birds and plants together
to form a harmonious ecosystem.
The use of plants in enclosures and aviaries fulfills several purposes.
Amongst these are to provide shelter from the elements, to give a sense of
privacy and suitable nesting sites, and to enhance the appearance of the
structure. Another invaluable benefit conferred by plants is that they help
to prevent the build-up of chemicals by assisting in the breakdown and ab-
sorption of the droppings.
Wire mesh and framework are rarely attractive and are always an unnat-
ural intrusion so they are all the better for being disguised as much as poss-
ible and the necessarily hard perimeters of the enclosure made to look less
determinate. Bitumen painting of netting is trebly important; from an
aesthetic point of view, from the practical purposes of prolonging its life
in these days of high costs, and also because some plants react adversely
to drips from galvanised materials.
Plants inside aviaries must be sufficiently tough or sufficiently vigorous
in growth to withstand damage caused by the birds. In some cases, especi-
ally if the aviary is heavily stocked, regular replacement is necessary.
Many small insect-eating birds are beneficial to plants, keeping them
free of insect predators - in fact, a horticultural research station with a
large conservatory has recently installed Zosterops with this end in view,
though I have seen damage done by these birds to young shoots and won-
der whether they will find this natural control system entirely satisfactory.
At the other extreme we have the parrot family whose members in general
are so destructive that any plants must be outside the aviary. In between
these two types we may achieve a balance through the use of vigorous
resistant plants, avoidance of overstocking and a programme of planned

replacement.
I have already mentioned the durability of bitumen-treated netting and
it should be borne in mind that this covering only adheres satisfactorily to
"weathered" netting. Those who do not wish to wait for this to occur
naturally can obtain a mordant solution to provide an etched surface
which will give the prospect of immediate painting coupled with proper
adhesion. Use only first grade bitumen products and ensure that you are
employing the correct formulation for the purpose in hand.
We naturally wish our structure to blend in with its surroundings and so
much of the planting must be on the outside. Climbing plants on pillars or
on pergolas disguise the hard outline of the aviary. A pergola on the south
side of a structure should be planted with deciduous plants. These will
provide shade in summer and at the same time will allow the penetration
of winter sunshine. When designing a pergola, remember the incidence of
both summer and winter sunshine and try to obscure the latter as little as
possible. Sufficiently wide spacing of the crossbars helps here whilst
creating a dappled shade in summer. The use of climbers which can be
hard pruned to confine them closely to the supports assists here. Wisteria
and ornamental vines have lush summer growth and may be rigorously
"spur pruned" in autumn with benefit to their display as well as to their
primary purpose. It must always be remembered that the penetration of
winter sunshine is of the utmost importance. An aviary that is sunless
and dank in winter by reason of poor planting would be infinitely better
without any plants at all. It cannot be too strongly stressed that even in
summer the sunshine should be able to penetrate the aviary and that the
planting should allow this while still giving suitable areas of shade which,
of course, vary due to the movement of the sun. Evergreen climbers must
be most carefully used therefore and are better confined to the northern
sides of the structure.
I have always felt that planting creates an atmosphere and the use of
the right plant for the habitat we wish to present greatly adds to the
pleasure which plants give. I would always advise the use of plants which
are naturally found in a similar environment to the birds' natural home.
I think it is acceptable to mix plants emanating from different countries
provided that they inhabit similar environments. Nothing, however, strikes
such a discordant note as, say, the employment of plants naturally found
in dry areas in an attempt to embellish a collection of waterbirds. Always
carefully plan before deciding which plants to use - plants occurring later-
ally where shore-frequenting birds are displayed, heathy scrubby vegeta-
tion for those dwelling in the uplands and the general run of shrubs for

those found in woods and their margins. A pleasant conceit would be to
use only those actual plants which the species would find in its natural
home. In all planting, remember the basic rules of scale, boldness of
grouping, contrasting foliage, form and colour.
Before planting there must be careful preparation, particularly when
the planting is inside the enclosure. Drainage must be adequate, some-
times more than adequate from the plants' point of view. Nothing is so
conducive to disease as a sour, waterlogged soil. A wide-spreading fibrous
root system enables the plants to exploit the area and keep the soil sweet
by assisting in the breakdown of excrement , using the products for
growth. An open, permeable soil is of the first importance.
Any moisture-loving plants on pool margins should be planted in an
open vegetable soil - it is unlikely that amelioration of the existing soil will
be sufficient here and fresh suitable compost must be imported. Any soil
in the aviary must be fully exploited by a thrusting and vigorous root sys-
tem.
Where parasites are a problem and necessitate the use of regular sanita-
tion, plants must be confined in some way. They may be planted in beds
covered with netting to prevent the birds having access to the soil or the
bed may be surfaced with a layer of graded stones through which oocysts
will be washed out of the reach of questing beaks. The rest of the aviary
floor can be either of similar stones, or concrete or turf which can be re-
placed with fresh at regular intervals.
This brings us to the most important plant of all - grass. A vigorous
grass sward is of inestimable benefit in all cases. In small enclosures and
where there is concern about parasites, it can be covered with wire netting
raised above the earth by an inch or so - do not forget to treat the netting
with bitumen first, both for economy and also because many grasses are
inhibited by the drips from zinc. Use tanalised, or similarly treated timber
and not creosote or other cresol-based preservatives. In large enclosures
there must be provision for cutting, always design the areas of grass for
easy manipulation of the machine employed and set any adjacent paving
below the level of the sward.
In extensive enclosures, fruiting trees provide a welcome bonus in
season.
To summarise, successful planting must create a mood. Apart from the
plants being able to thrive in the position required, they must be aestheti-
cally right for the situation. You can only create a pleasing picture by
correct choice of plants to show off the bird. Nothing would look more
out of place than, for example, birds of the seashore amongst hybrid tea

roses. Avoid, like the plague, any highly developed garden plants, except
outside the enclosures. Always plant inside the aviaries with hygiene in
mind. Dense, shrubby ground cover is difficult to keep vermin-free inside
the aviaries and if used outside, gives ideal mouse cover. Finally, study
plant associations as they occur in nature and model all your internal
landscaping accordingly. The planting outside must, of course, harmonise
with that inside and also provide a pleasing transition from the garden
proper.
SHOR T LIST OF SUGGESTED PLANTS FOR A VIARIES
A list of plants must only be a suggestion to intending planters, as there
is an infinity of sorts to choose from.
The following suggestions are divided into groups suitable for enclosures
of modest dimensions; no recommendations of trees or of plants for glass-
house type aviaries have been made in order to keep the article to manage-
able proportions.

<bodyText confidence="0.999247857142857" page_id="56284252"  page_num="164" year="" vol="">
Aucuba may be either plain leaved or spotted but all are especially val-
uable as they grow in full sun to dense shade.
Bamboos, those woody grasses, do well in enclosures as they appreciate
the shelter provided by the enclosure. They are available in a wide range of
heights.
Berberis in general dislike waterlogged soil and some people may find
their prickles unacceptable but they provide good shelter and ideal nesting
sites.
Ceanothus, of the stiffergrowing sorts such as thyrsiflorus , provide good
crotches for nesting and a welcome display of blue flowers. The laxer
growing sorts may be tied to the perimeter walls or to pillars.
When we consider the genus Cotoneaster we have many suitable shrubs
from dwarfs to small trees and a walk round a good botanic garden and a
selection of those which particularly appeal will be rewarding. The semi-
evergreen C. simonsii tolerates clipping well and is one of the best for
smaller enclosures. It is also freely available and low-priced.
Cytisus are somewhat short-lived but are quick-growing. They should
be clipped over immediately the flowers fade to maintain compactness.
Clipping cannot, of course, be done if they are being used for nesting.
Eleagnus ebbingei is a handsome grey-green and silver shrub which
should be more planted. It seems to have been overlooked in favour of

its newly introduced variegated form and its gold-painted relative E. pun-
gens maculata.
All these provide dense shelter and protected nest sites.
Escallonias quickly give a wealth of pink to red blossoms over glossy
foliage. They respond kindly to pruning.
Hebes are what used to be called shrubby veronicas. We now have a
range of species and cultivars too numerous to list, from real dwarfs to
good sized shrubs. Consult a good list and avoid the tender sorts unless
you live in a warm area or near the sea.
Ilex, in its free-growing green forms such as I. pyramidalis , are not so
prickly as the common holly and although no sort is really fast growing,
they are indispensable where dense growth and glossy foliage are essential.
The genus Ligustrum contains the ubiquitous privet of suburbia, a shrub
that must not be despised for aviary use. A more ornamental species is
L japonicum, a free-growing shrub with glossy leaves and white flowers.
Lonicera provides an ideal small shrub in L. nitida. This is compact,
trims well and establishes quickly. L. pileata is horizontally branched and
provides excellent ground shelter.
Mahonias again provide good shelter for ground-dwelling birds and the
common M. aquifolium is cheap enough when extensive planting is necess-
ary. They thrive in sun or shade.
Rhododendrons need somewhat special conditions but R. ponticum,
which has made itself at home over large tracts of our heathlands, is a
provider of superb shelter. It transplants at virtually any size, provided you
have the strength. It needs an acid soil.
Although conifers can scarcely be called shrubs, they are, in their young
state, excellent for our ouroose: the genera Thuya, Chamaecyparis, Cup-
ressus and Cupresso-cypans first spring to mind and many of these may
be clipped to control over-enthusiastic growth. Scots Pine and Douglas Fir
may also be restricted to a more domestic size by suitable use of the seca-
teurs and provide a welcome variation of foliage type.

These are especially to be considered where the penetration of winter
sunshine takes precedence over shelter. The number of sorts available is
legion as by far the greatest number which are hardy in our climate lose

Caryopteris is a good blue flowered dwarf shrub which may also be
pruned hard each year.
Chaenomeles are the well-known "japonicas" and either spreading or
upright growers may be chosen.
The dogwoods, Cornus alba and stolonifera and their varieties, are
quick to establish and submit with good grace to hard pruning.
Crataegus includes our native hawthorn and may be trained as shrubs
or small trees according to our needs. They give good nesting cover and, if
there is room for them to develop, a welcome display of bloom.
Eleagnus commutata, the "Silver Berry", is a compact, intensely silver
shrub with small fragrant flowers.
Forsythias grow well, flower well and clip well and if you find the vivid
gold too harsh, the variety 'primulina! should be planted.
The shrubby honeysuckle Lonicera purpusii requires a fair amount of
room but has fragrant flowers in winter.
In the genus Philadelphus we have many to choose from. Some are
vigorous, upward thrusting growers whilst others are of modest proportions.
They provide masses of flowers and are mostly delightfully fragrant. A look
through a comprehensive catalogue is a necessity here but bear in mind the
sorts "Belle Etoile", "Burkwoodii" and "Innocence".
Shrubby potentillas give good ground cover, have a long flowering
period and are easy to grow.
Ribes, the currants, are always useful, the red-flowering spring sorts
being most attractive although they have a somewhat pungent smell.
Species roses contain many sorts of quiet charm and these, along with
some of the modern hybrid shrub roses, will give variety. The rugosa
types are dense growers and the single sorts bear opulent tomato-red hips
in season.
Sambucus canadensis maxima is a superb foliage plant - prune hard in
spring to obtain the largest leaves. Our own native elder is available with
plain or variegated leaves and with either black or yellowish berries. The
thread-leaved form S. nigra heterophylla is of modest growth. S. racem-
osus has scarlet berries.
Spiraeas are of quick growth, easy to control and useful in situations
where compactness must be maintained.
Where there is room Viburnum opulus is especially good. This is
found either red or yellow berried as well as in its sterile form, the much
loved Snowball tree. The fruits are not palatable to birds until late in
the season.
Weigelias must bring this short list to a close. They are shrubs of

These are especially valuable as they clothe walls and pillars giving
shelter without trespassing on flying space.
The vigorous species of Clematis quickly clothe their supports, submit
to clipping with cheerful grace and we need look no further than C. mon-
tana in pink or white, C orientalis with its yellow orange-peel flowers or
the golden lanterns of C. tangutica.
Ivies come in all sizes and a multitude of leaf shapes and colours. They
are cheerful evergreen plants for almost any situation.
The common hop and its less vigorous golden form is ideal where quick
cover is required.
Honeysuckles again are most valuable climbers. The species L. capri-
folium, L. periclymenum and japonica do well in full or partial shade.
The scentless, scarlet types prefer a warmer position as does the sweetly
fragrant Lonicera etrusca.
Polygonum baldschuanicum is of vigorous rampant growth which will
climb into large trees or cover&amp;apos;unsightly buildings but may be pruned hard
annually to control its size.
Many species roses are of climbing or lax growth and will always be
admired. There are also single flowered sorts in the garden varieties such
as Frances E. Lester which give a delightful display.
Solanum crispum, which should be obtained in the "Glasnevin" form,
provides quick cover.
The vines contain many sorts which are over vigorous but the grape
vine is always controllable and the variety Brant is excellent.
Wisterias are lovely but very vigorous and their requirement of summer
pruning renders them undesirable when in breeding aviaries.
There are many suitable plants to clothe the floor of aviaries but choose
those with good foliage. A critical look at plants when not in flower pays
dividends.
Plants to use in aviaries containing shore-dwelling birds
The shrubs to be found in such an environment are frequently grey-
leaved, glossy-leaved or narrow-leaved to enable them to cope with diffi-
cult conditions. Eleagnus, Senecio, Halimium, lavenders, rosemary, San-
tolina, buckthorns, tamarisks, escallonias the the larger leaved hebes will
plete the picture. There have been some most valuable grasses raised in
Germany and these are now becoming available from specialist nurseries.

Poicephaius rneyeri
By ARTHUR FREUD (Smithtown, New York, USA)
Meyer&amp;apos;s Parrot is widely distributed through central and eastern Africa.
Subspecies can be found in Uganda, Tanzania, Kenya, Malawi, Zambia, the
Congo, Angola, Lesotho and South Africa. As with most of the African
parrot species Poicephaius meyeri has been familiar to ornithologists since
early in the 19th century. Peters lists the nominate plus as many as eight
subspecies and designates 1827 as the year in which the bird was first des-
cribed and named. A.A. Prestwich dates the discovery a year earlier and
describes Dr. Bernhard Meyer, the physician who was honoured in the
naming of this parrot as an individual who rendered outstanding services in
the encouragement of the early study of natural history. Meyer, who lived
from 1767-1836, undertook numerous expeditions for the purpose of
studying plants and birds. He visited many European scholars in his travels
and in return, they came to admire his outstanding bird collection. The
famous German poet, Goethe, visited Meyer on at least two separate
occasions.
Forshaw condenses the number of subspecies to six. In general the dif-
ferences between the subspecies are minor and take the form of a variation
in intensity of colour or the area covered by a particular marking. Geogra-
phy, of course, is also a factor.
Meyer's Parrot is also referred to by the names Meyer's Brown Parrot,
Brown Parrot and Sudan Brown Parrot. The repeated reference to brown
in its name is appropriate as the head and the upper parts of the breast and
back are a greyish-brown. The rump is a bright turquoise although this is
not normally visible when the wings are folded. There is a bright yellow
marking at the bend of the wing and also on the thighs. The feet and beak
are greyish-black and the iris is reddish-orange in adults and brown in
young birds.
All of the subspecies with the exceptions of Pm. reichenowi and P.m.
damaremis, possess a bright yellow marking on the crown which may ac-
count for the nickname of "Goldbug" for this parrot which is commonly
used in Germany. Wolfgang de Grahl comments that sex differences be-
tween these birds could not be determined even with a ''bridal couple".
He accurately reports that in recent years they have once again become
commercially available. De Grahl notes their behaviour as shy and timid
and goes so far as to suggest that when you are acclimatising them, you

should use a type of crate cage with only one side open to provide the
parrots with maximum privacy.
Rutgers and Norris make reference to the wide distribution and large
numbers of these birds in Africa. They point out that, although importa-
tion has been sporadic, the species is well known in captivity and was
first seen in the London Zoo as early as 1855.
W.T. Greene gives a good description of the Meyer's and, unlike many
early (and a few current) authors, properly distinguishes it from the
Brown-headed Parrot Poicephalus cryptoxanthus.
Sydney Porter wrote with great enthusiasm for his pair of Meyer's
Parrots. Porter, who was an indefatigable traveller, had seen these birds
in the wild in Africa and noted them chattering away madly as they ate
and wasted the fruits of a M'sasa tree. Sometimes the tree seemed to be
raining half-eaten fruits. Porter commented that parrots " ....... are surely
the most wasteful birds in creation." When a stranger approached the
tree, all chatter and other sounds would cease and nothing could be seen
as the greyish-brown birds blended silently with their surroundings.
Porter remarked that it is easier to get within reach of an eagle than a
wild Meyer's Parrot and yet no bird makes a tamer or more charming
pet. The natives of his day would catch the parrots by locating their
roosting spots and placing sticky substances on the twigs. Those parrots
which were not eaten would be sold.
There are a number of good descriptions of the breeding of Meyer's
Parrot to be found in the literature. Prestwich lists an early success by
J.B. Rough of South Africa. The birds, which were caught wild on Mr.
Rough's farm in the Transvaal, produced quite a number of young in
1952.
Another South African success was achieved by J.F. Brauckmann who
describes his results in 1960. Mr. Brauckmann had kept Meyer's for many
years but had never bred them. He varied his nest boxes and other con-
ditions and finally placed his birds in a 12 ft x 15 ft x 6 ft aviary with
hollow palm tree stumps, a 10 inch by 12 inch square nest box, and a
12 inch square by 24 inch high box. Three eggs were laid and three chicks
hatched with only one of the young being reared to maturity. In 1959
three more eggs were laid (from a new pair of adults) and these hatched
out on the 19th and 23rd days of incubation. The middle egg did not
hatch. The chicks resembled baby Budgerigars when they hatched. Both
of these were reared and left the nest after nine weeks. Two more chicks
resulted from a second round of four eggs and these also stayed in the
nest for about nine weeks before going off on their own.

Dr. William S. Hawkins of Sunland, California, bred his Meyer's Parrots
in 1971. His pair were purchased in 1969 and at that time were immature,
newly-imported birds. Writing in the May, 1972, Dr. Hawkins describes
how the parrots were kept in an indoor flight until spring and then were
placed in a 4 ft wide by 23 ft long outdoor aviary. A 10 inch square by
18 inch deep nest box with about 4 inches of peat was provided. Late in
the summer of 1970 the birds began to show an interest in their nest box
and three eggs were laid early in September. The hen alone incubated and
while all three eggs were fertile, none hatched. Dr. Hawkins speculates
that the record heat in southern California that summer might have been
a factor in the failure of the eggs to hatch. In 1971 the birds again showed
interest in the nest box quite early in the spring. Three eggs were laid
during the first week in February. In spite of a severe earthquake which
struck the area on 9th February 1971, the hen did not leave the nest and
two eggs hatched on 21st February and the third egg hatched two days
later. The parents were devoted and attentive with the male co-operating
handsomely. The young appeared similar to baby lovebirds with patches
of white down. In October of the same year a second round resulted in
three fertile eggs which hatched on 12th November. The parents again
provided good care but, as the weather was turning cold, the three downy
chicks were removed by Dr. Hawkins on 9th December and thereafter
hand-reared. They were fully on their own by the first week in February.
Their owner described them as smaller and duller editions of their parents.
Raymond Franklin in England also bred Meyer's Parrots in 1971. He
noticed that the male had a larger beak than the female and more yellow
on the crown. Of course, this might have been due to a difference in their
subspecies rather than their sex. He provided a 12 ft by 3 ft by 6 ft flight
with a small shelter and on 3rd April 1971 hung a small hollow log in the
flight. The male fed the female but they showed no interest in the nest
until Mr. Franklin filled it with peat. As quickly as he did this, the hen
would throw out the material. One egg was noted on 16th May but to
Mr. Franklin's delighted surprise, two chicks were discovered on 16th
June. They appeared to be about one week old and covered with down.
One chick began peering out of the nest by 30th July but did not leave
until 10th August. A second chick left the nest on 13th August. Mr Frank-
lin was pleasantly astonished when still two more young appeared on 15th
August making a total of four strong, healthy birds from this first clutch.
Mr. H. Mekin of England described the breeding of a pair of Meyer's
Parrots in 1974. He had had his birds for several years and always believed
them to be a pair. Several nest boxes were offered and the birds selected a

30 inch by 12 inch square unit. After copulation in April, 1974, the hen
was not seen again for six weeks. By the end of June, Mr. Mekin decided
to risk looking into the nest and a large chick, with colour patterns similar
to his parents was discovered. This youngster left the nest after another
five weeks.
Alan H. Booton of Riverside, Illinois, has had remarkable success in
breeding parrots during the last few years. Perhaps it is not so remarkable
as Mr. Booton has gone about his breeding endeavours in a highly organ-
ised way and has had the expert help and advice of Ralph and Tina Small
of Brookfield, Illinois. As a matter of fact, the breeding pair of Meyer's
used by Mr. Booton was loaned to him by Ralph Small.
The male member of the pair appears to be Pm. transvaalensis while
the female who lacks the yellow crown marking is apparently P. m. damar-
ensis. As with all Meyer's, the pair was shy and would retreat into the nest
box whenever Mr. Booton entered the room. In contrast to this their five
handfed babies would eat from a spoon and were so playful that they
would "play dead" in Mr. Booton's hand while lying upside down and
totally relaxed.
The diet he provided for the parents was 3 parts sunflower, 1 part dove
mix (without corn), 1 part safflower and Vi part parakeet mix. Purina
monkey chow was also included as well as a variety of fruits and greens.
Brewer's yeast was sprinkled on the moist fruits and vegetables just before
they were fed and poultry vitamins added to the drinking water on a daily
basis. When young were in the nest, the amount of safflower as well as
sweet corn and other vegetables, was increased.
The flight cage was 8 ft long by 3 ft wide by 6 ft high. Three of these
cages are in a special room in Mr. Booton's basement. Wooden partitions
separate them so that the birds in one flight cannot see those in the others.
The room is lit by Vitajite fluorescents which are on for 15 hours a day
and regulated with an automatic timer and dimmer. Night lights are also
provided. A 15 inch by 15 inch square nest box with a 3 inch opening was
used. Damp bark and pine shavings were placed in the box and the parents
chewed up the bark until it reached a finer consistency. Three clutches of
three eggs each were produced during the year. In the first clutch one
hatched, one chick was dead in shell and one egg was infertile. In the
second clutch two hatched and one egg was infertile. In the third clutch
two eggs hatched and one was dead in shell. Incubation took 24 days and
the young were removed for handfeeding when they were three weeks old.
The breeding pair used by Mr. Booton were well along in their teens but he
estimates that this species could breed at about two years old.

Ralph Small's formula was used for handfeeding the babies and it con-
sisted of 2 parts raw peanuts, 2 parts hulled sunflower, 3 parts Purina mon-
key chow, 2 parts fruit mynah chow and 3 Vi parts of high protein pablum.
In addition, an eighth of a teaspoon each of powdered calcium and sea salt
and one teaspoon of soy milk powder were added. The material is ground
as fine as possible in a blender and when you are ready to use it, warm
water is added to form a thick, soupy consistency.
Mr. Booton reports that the adults and young are all very quiet birds.
They use an alarm-type call when startled or if they should wish to attract
your attention but normally they do not just sit and make noises in the
manner of the Amazons and other parrots. He kept two of the five young
for himself and at the time of this writing, they are 19 months old. One
has a small band of yellow on the crown and the other has just a few
flecks. Thus, at least one of the offspring has inherited the absence of
yellow crown found in its mother. The birds can talk and have picked up
words from the pair of African Grey Parrots which share their aviary.

KIWIS AT OTOROHANGA
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.998088027027027" page_id="56284263"  page_num="175" year="" vol="">
By L. GIBSON (Burnaby, British Columbia, Canada)
In May 1980 I travelled to Adelaide, Australia, to attend, among
other things, the Avicultural Convention. I stopped off in New Zealand
on the way and visited the kiwi breeding establishment and walk-through
aviary at Otorohanga, in the centre of North Island.
The aviary is intended to house native birds and plants but as it had
only just opened, the trees and bushes, many of which had been donated
by Mrs Noeline Gibson, were still rather small. The bird collection was
by no means complete but the larger, more obvious birds were represen-
ted, such as native ducks, keas, kakarikis, native woodpigeon, Moreporks
(a nocturnal hawk-owl Ninox novaeseelandiae , called the Boobook in
Australia; both names are after its call), etc. The small native softbills,
many of which are disappearing rapidly, were not catered for yet, with the
exception of fantails Rhipidura fuliginosa. It seems that softbills are
neglected the world over.
The kiwi breeding pens are operated by the Otorohanga Zoological Soc-
iety which, of course, desperately needs funds, so if any of our readers
would like to help to save kiwis, and other New Zealand birds, donations
would be most gratefully received at P.O. Box 222, Otorohanga, New Zea-
land. The resident kiwi expert is Barry Rowe, who has a chemist's shop
(drug store) in the town.
The new nocturnal house for the display of kiwis has reversed daylight.
Two kiwis are always on display but as these birds sleep a lot, even during
the night, they are rotated in the display house. The 2 o'clock shift consis-
ted of a hen Brown or Common Kiwi Apteryx australis , weighing about
4 lbs. (1.8 kg), and a*rare hen South Island Giant Spotted Roa Apteryx
haastii at 5 lb. (2.3 kg). The latter bird had recently been found in a trap
and this species cannot be seen outside New Zealand. There is one very
rare species, the Little Spotted Roa Apteryx oweni. Roa is the Maori
name, as is kiwi, the latter being named after its rather squeaky call. The
adjective "common" is, of course, only relative.
The birds were fed on a mixture of chopped ox heart, cooked porridge
and soya oil with added vitamins and minerals. They eat by throwing the
food up into the bill with the tongue. As soon as the feeding dish was put
in, both birds ran up to feed but they are rather quarrelsome and one bird
had to wait its turn. When feeding, one bird (the Common, if I recall
correctly), ate and then stretched its neck up fully before swallowing but

the other bird did not do this, so it was possibly some sort of threat dis-
play or nervous reaction. The birds had the area divided off territorially,
and used well trodden paths to the food dish. Normally they feed by pro-
bing in the soil; they did this every few inches and worked quickly to
cover the area thoroughly. They feed on worms, etc., which they smell
through nostrils at the tip of the bill. To aid this, the kiwi has an excep-
tionally large olfactory bulb behind the bill. It also has rictal bristles at the
base of the bill which no doubt augment its poor eyesight with an extra
sense of touch. New Zealand is particularlu well supplied with earthworms,
having about 190 species, so the kiwis do not have to work too hard in the
humus of the forest floor - or what is left of it. The kiwis have exception-
ally well-developed legs for running and burrowing, and they are also used
for kicking- other kiwis mainly, though they will kick cats or people who
disturb them. I got a hefty kick from one for disturbing its sleep. Kiwis
also have excellent hearing.
The Brown Kiwi breeds at three years old which puts it amongst the
slowest of birds to mature. One or two, occasionally three eggs are laid
about three weeks apart and they hatch at the same interval. The egg is
huge, being between 400 and 500 grammes, although most are nearer the
bottom of the range, and this is about 20-25% of the adult bird's weight.
It also differs from other eggs in that the yolk is about 60% of the weight
of the egg, compared with about 40% for pheasants and 20% for small
passerines. The eggs are incubated solely by the male for 71-75 days, at
a temperature of 35.4*C. The temperature of the adult is only 38*C,
which is two or three degrees lower than that of most birds. The chicks
are born at an advanced stage, and live on the remains of the yolk sac for
a week or two during which time they lose more than a quarter of their
weight. They are kept together until they are six months old, after which
time they get too quarrelsome.
The staff at Otorohanga were particularly helpful and spent a lot of
time showing me around and answering questions. The time spent there
was not only interesting but useful, as I managed to dry out after being
soaked to the skin by a thunderstorm, which caught me earlier while
walking in the bush.

Recent acquisitions to the Bird Section, imported from Sydney Zoo,
were ten Australian White Ibis Threskiomis molucca, four Kookaburras
Dacelo novaeguineae and four Tawny Frogmouths Podargus strigoides.
The arrival of the Ibis and Tawny Frogmouths is particularly interesting
as these have not been exhibited at Chester Zoo before. The Ibis arrived on
7th April from our quarantine quarters and were put into a holding area so
we could observe feeding habits: when we are satisfied that they are all
feeding well, the birds will be transferred to an open island on the water-
way which runs through the Zoo. This island measures approximately
80 metres x 30 metres. It is hoped that we will be able to start a breeding
colony of these birds in this accommodation.
The four Kookaburras will be introduced to our existing pair and it is
hoped that these birds will again produce youngsters.
Further notes will follow in a future issue of the AviculturalMagazine
on the Tawny Frogmouths: these are new birds to us here at Chester and
we will be learning from them all the time.
Another new arrival is a male Kea Nestor notabilis from Rotterdam
Zoo. This bird is now on show in our Parrot House with our female Kea.
The most notable hatching at Chester Zoo last year was our Blue-eyed
Cockatoo. Both our pairs were sitting on one egg each, and the two were
hatched and reared. We re particularly pleased with this breeding as one
of the males is a bird which was bred here in 1978. We now have a group
of this species totalling seven birds. At the time of writing, our two pairs
are showing great interest in the nesting barrels again so we are hoping for
a repeat performance.
Other breedings include: Black-crowned Night Heron, White-crested

Nearly three years have elapsed since the last communication from the
St. Louis Zoo. Much has happened during that time, particularly with
regard to our aviary. Opened in 1930 and described in the Avicultural
Magazine , Volume 37, No. 10, October 1931, our Bird House has under-
gone a complete renovation. The project, nearly two years in the planning,
officially began with the closing of the facility in November of 1978.
From the very inception of the project, the real challenge had been to
design a floor plan and exhibit system that would be compatible with the
building's original superstructure and that would also retain its architec-
tural integrity. Therefore, the first stages of renovation involved the re-
moval of the building's interior, with the exception of those support
structures and pertinent architectural features.
The total number of exhibits was reduced from 56 to 36. The open
flight exhibit measures approximately 538 square feet (49.98 square
metres); other exhibits vary in size from 102 to 429 square feet (9.48
to 39.85 square metres). Each exhibit is bounded by cement plaster
walls and vertical stainless steel wires. Each wire is drawn to a tension
of 75 lbs and is attached to a spring that insures the maintenance of that
tautness. The spacing of wires in most of the exhibits is one inch (2.54 cm)
on centre; however, exhibits for very small birds are spaced one-half inch
(1.27 cm) on centre. Floor and ceiling braces, in the form of I-beams, were
added to compensate for increased strain on the superstructure by the ten-
sion wires.
Most of the exhibits are curvilinear in form. Between the vertical wire
fronts of the exhibits and the carpeted public walk space lie continuous
planting pockets. Approximately 6,500 tropical plants of nearly 110
varieties are growing within the exhibits and in the public planting spaces.
Ambient light for all exhibit and planting pocket areas is supplied via sky-
lights installed in each exhibit. This light source is supplemented by timer-
regulated incandescent flood lamps located above the planting pockets.
There are many exhibit themes - shorebird, African savannah, American
desert, and tropical forest - and pools and streams were constructed accord-
ing to the theme of each exhibit. Varieties of natural stone were used as
much as possible to create the desired mood; and tree stumps and limbs,
vines and other plants have been included to enhance the natural effect. In
conjunction with other improvements, the renovation also involved the in-

stallation of completely new air-handling and plumbing systems.
As an appropriate finishing touch to the renovation, a special exhibit
area was created for a 26-piece porcelain bird collection representing the
works of Boehm, Granget and Cybis. These renditions, displayed in eight
glass cases, are appraised at nearly 150,000 dollars and are protected by a
sophisticated alarm system.
On Saturday, 22nd September, 1979, after a construction period of
283 days, the St. Louis Zoo Bird House was re-opened to the public. The
final cost: 1,500,00 dollars.
Breeding results during the renovation period were very poor because
much of the collection was in temporary housing during most of 1979 and
construction resulted in the closing of the incubation and brooding facilities.
However, some interesting hatchings did occur in 1978 and in 1980. Koo-
kaburras, Speckled Mousebirds, Spurwing Plovers, Stanley Cranes, Carib-
bean Flamingoes, King Penguins, East African Crowned Cranes, Yellow-
crowned Amazon Parrots, Superb Starlings and a Mottled Owl were among
the species successfully reared. Numerous waterfowl and gamebirds were
reared, including Hooded Mergansers, American Goldeneyes, Red Shovelers,
and Argentine, Cinnamon, Puna and Sharp-winged Teal; Satyr Tragopans,
Mikado, Koklass, Malayan Crested Fireback and Palawan Peacock Phea-
sants; and an Australian Brush Turkey. The 1980 breeding season was cur-
tailed by unseasonably hot weather. The average daytime temperature was
near 100*F (37.8*C) from mid July to early September; and, as a result,
egg-laying virtually ceased halfway through what is considered the normal
reproductive period.
It has taken nearly a year and a half for us to work out the problems
normally associated with any renovation project. During this period of
adjustment, we have strived towards fulfilment of the exhibit and avicul-
tural potential of the building and its inhabitants. Specimens have been
acquired and single birds paired. Natural nesting materials are constantly
being procured. Weather permitting, it is hoped that our labours will prove
fruitful in 1981. So far, the signs appear promising.

Sunday, 7th June, proved to be an occasion to remember for the many
members of the Avicultural Society and their guests who spent the after-
noon visiting Chestnut Lodge, at Cobham, in Surrey, by kind invitation
of Miss Ruth Ezra. The gardens were looking superb and the collection
of birds belonging to Miss Ezra and Mr. Raymond Sawyer, which must now
rank with the foremost private collections in Europe, provided great in-
terest to all the visitors. Not only are the birds superbly displayed and
maintained but the breeding record at Chestnut Lodge is very impressive.
Satyr Tragopan, Palawan Peacock Pheasant, Green Jungle fowl, Schalow's
Turaco and Emerald Starling have been bred there this year, last year's
Emerald Starling helping to feed this year's young. Stilts and Ringed
Plover were sitting; also Redshanks and Avocets were incubating eggs
but unfortunately very heavy rain subsequently flooded the nest.
During the delicious tea provided by Miss Ezra, members had an
opportunity to meet our President, Dr. Jean Delacour, who was visiting
this country for his ninetieth birthday celebrations and everyone was
delighted to see how well he looked. It was also a great pleasure to
welcome M. and Mme. Walter Van den bergh; after many years as the
world-famous director of the Antwerp Zoo in Belgium, M. Van den bergh
is now enjoying an active retirement and is making a very valuable con-
tribution to our Society as a Vice President.
We are very grateful indeed to Miss Ezra, not only for being a wonder-
ful hostess but for most generously donating the proceeds of the visit
(#78) to the Society's funds.

The January/March Issue of the Avicultural Magazine contained an
excellent article by L. Gibson on two species of fruitsuckers. Despite one
of these, the Golden-fronted, being a common avicultural subject, success-
ful breeding accounts for Chloropsis are virtually non-existent so the very
full account given by Mr. Gibson in the following issue of the Magazine of
his successful breeding of Hardwicke's Chloropsis Chloropsis hardwickei is
of particular interest. No complete breeding of Chloropsis has occurred, as
far as I am aware, in Britain; the closest was achieved by Dr. Maurice
Amsler who hatched the Golden-fronted on several occasions, one of
which survived for fourteen days. Two separate reports of the same
attempt appear in the pages of the Avicultural Magazine , the references
being 1917, 224-227, and 1941, 193-196, for those interested.

Brown. An authority on African birds of prey and flamingoes, he was,
especially of late, a prolific author.
Members may be interested to know of the Peterson Field Guide to the
Bird Songs of Britain and Europe which was started in 1969 and now des-
cribes itself as the world's most comprehensive bird song encyclopaedia. It
consists of a collection of fifteen long-playing records of extremely high
quality and in all the voices of 585 species are represented. The total
number of separate recordings is over 1,000 and the running time is twelve

The Yellow-faced Parrotlet Forpus xanthops was first introduced to
aviculture about two years ago and specimens have found their way to
collections in at least four countries. So it is pleasing that at least two avi-
culturists have now reported success. Mr. and Mrs. Spenkelink, in Soester-
burg, Holland, list the species amongst those bred during 1980 (see below)
and Jan Sorensen, Bronshoj, Denmark, documents his rearing, in Danish,

How do you develop a safer but lighter miner's helmet? Researchers
at the University of California decided to study woodpeckers for possible
clues by seeing if they developed headaches while drumming. They dis-
covered that each peck takes less than one-thousandth of a second and
that the impact is more than 300 times greater than an astronaut feels
when taking off into space. Nothing is felt by the woodpecker, scientists
report, because they have superb reflexes and are able to keep their necks
tense, like a boxer in action. It was deduced that helmets should be made
thicker, lighter and be better padded to resist puncture.

David Webster writes: 'My Hyacinthine Macaws are approximately
eight years old now but were quite immature without full complement of
tail feathers in 1973. These are now very hardy aviary birds housed on the
rear of my house with a viewing window into my living room - now closed
off - with an outside aviary for exercise. I noticed in 1978 for the first
time ever, a sudden hostile attitude, being an impressive raising of the head
and body feathers every time I looked through the window where their
nesting barrel is situated. Normally previous to this both male and female
have been very friendly indeed. This aggressive attitude has continued ever
since around the nesting area.
"In May 1979, the first egg was laid which, when checked, proved in-
fertile so was removed. In July, two eggs were laid, one of which was fer-
tile. This chick was pipping in shell for three days but made no attempt to
break out and died just before hatching. I removed both eggs and opened
them, the chick was fully formed in correct hatching position with yolk
not fully withdrawn. It weighed 28 grammes.
"It was not until July 1980 when they laid two more eggs, this time
both fertile. First egg was pipping weakly. I opened it after the incubation
period passed. Both appeared identical in malposition with head over right
wing and beak facing down towards small end of egg."

After several unsuccessful attempts, the Oklahoma City Zoo has reared
an Ornate Hawk-Eagle Spizaetus omatus . Three pairs of this small South
American Eagle are kept in an area off the zoo grounds. One pair laid and
incubated a single egg for three weeks before abandoning it. When this
happened, the egg was removed to an incubator for a further four weeks.
The chick weighed nearly two ounces when hatched and trebled its weight
in the first ten days. It grew rapidly on chick entrails, horse meat and bird
of prey diet. This is believed to be the first occasion that this particular
species has reared in captivity.

In Kenya, the third annual census of birds within the Nairobi Provincial
boundary took place on 23rd November 1980. The 1980 census received
less publicity and, as a result perhaps, the number of participants was red-
uced and this probably was reflected in a lower count than in the previous
census.
In the 1980 census, 13,431 birds of 285 species were counted. Included
were 700 Garganey, two Peregrine Falcon, 58 European Bee-eater, 98 Cin-
namon-chested Bee-eater, 23 Hildebrandt's Starling, 85 Superb Starling,
224 Variable Sunbird, 575 Bronze Mannikin and 232 Crimson-ramped
Waxbilh European Hobby (2), Imperial Eagle (1), Little Ringed Plover (1),
Brown-hooded Kingfisher (1), Grey-headed Kingfisher (2), Von der Deck-
ends Hornbill (1), Malachite Sunbird (2) and Speckle-fronted Weaver (5)
were among species not recorded during the first and second census.

Back in 1975 I spent a long weekend bird-watching on Kangaroo Is-
land, just off the coast of South Australia. Although numerous species
were seen in the three days, the highlight being ten minutes watching a
flock of feeding Beautiful Fire-tails Emblema Bella , my goal, the Glossy
Black Cockatoo Calyptorhynchus lathami eluded me. So it is with slight
envy that I read the latest letter from Fred Bohner who has just returned
from a week&amp;apos;s holiday there searching for this highly specialised cockatoo.
He writes: "We saw three at a place called Harvey&amp;apos;s Return on the
north coast and thirty-nine at Billy Goat Gully where we made many in-
teresting observations. There seemed to be very few hens and this fact is
also reported by other observers. In the main group we only saw about
four hens so I hope some are nesting as about three of the males were
feeding young (probably almost a year old). The area where they were
located is about halfway along the north coast and is in a hilly, well-
protected conservation park. Observations could only be made along
the slopes of a steep ravine totally covered with casuarinas both sides.
At the bottom of the 400 ft slope was a permanent supply of water and
tall eucalypts."
Of his own birds, Fred reports that the Red-tailed Black Cockatoos
are rearing their sixth youngster. They laid twice this season as the first
youngster died due to last year's baby taking too long to become inde-
pendent. The second is now thriving since the previous year's chick was
successfully weaned and subsequently moved to another aviary.

Mr. A. Gardener, whose account of breeding the Griffon Vulture pub-
lished in the April/June 1980 issue of the Avicultural Magazine aroused
much interest, now writes to say that he has bred an Indian White-backed
Vulture which fledged at 19 weeks and it is believed to be the first to be
reared to independence in this country. His long-term ambition is to es-
tablish a breeding colony of these birds and we look forward to reading his
account of this project in a future issue of the Magazine.
The world captive population of the Siberian Crane Grus leucogeranus
could be more than doubled if fifteen chicks hatched from wild-taken eggs
are reared. Dr. Vladimir Flint discovered 26 nests in the tundra of Yakutia.
One egg was removed from 16 nests with two-egg clutches and transported
to Moscow in portable incubators. Four eggs were sent to Walsrode Vogel-
park in Germany, the remainder being deposited at the Soviet Union's
crane breeding centre in the Oka State Reserve, south of Moscow.

With the January-March issue of the Avicultural Magazine came a
change of cover illustration. For the previous thirteen years two Diamond
Sparrows drawn by Robert Gillmor adorned the cover, but a Rothschild's
Grackle has now replaced them which has been drawn and most generous-
ly donated by Malcolm Ellis, the well-known bird illustrator and regular
contributor to the Magazine.
This elegant Indonesian starling was first discovered in 1912 and some
sixteen years later made its first appearance in aviculture. This first impor-
tation of five birds went to the collection of the late Alfred Ezra who, in
1931, recorded the rearing of one young. Despite the fact that it is now
being reared in many collections, it remains to be seen how viable the
present captive population is. Aviculture may be the last stronghold for
this endangered bird - let us hope we can meet the challenge.

PHEASANTS IN ASIA, 1979

This excellent publication by the W.P.A. contains the proceedings of
the first International Symposium on Pheasants in Asia held in Kathman-
du, Nepal, between 21-23 November 1979. Commencing with the docu-
mentation of formal introductions, it progresses through the almost
thirty papers covering many aspects of pheasant research, both captive
and wild, read at the Symposium.
The main body of papers, most of which relate to the pheasants with
little or no attention being paid to the other galliformes of the region, are
grouped conveniently into five categories. Keynote papers on Forestry,
National Parks and Conservation in Nepal and Pheasant Conservation - a
Minimum Programme - are followed by reports on the status of pheasants
in Nepal, Pakistan, Malaysia, Indonesia, Thailand, Eastern India and the
Himalayas. A new subspecies of Cabot's Tragopan T. c. guangariensis ,
discovered in 1978, is described in the final paper in this section.
Field study techniques are discussed in four papers while those devoted
to captive breeding take in nine. Three of these cover the Cheer Pheasant
programme while an interesting account outlines the work of the Blyth's
Tragopan breeding centre in Nagaland. The final section concerns Conser-
vation Management and amongst subjects covered are tourism and educa-
tion. The text is dotted with photographs, detailed maps and some del-
ightful sketches by Robert Gillmor, Timothy Greenwood and Esdaile
Hudson.
It is pleasing to note that a second symposium is planned for 1981 in
Kashmir and I hope that at least a part of this will be set aside to discuss
the status and needs of some of the other galliformes of the region, many
of which must be suffering from the same pressures afflicting their larger
cousins.

INSTINCTIVE NAVIGATION OF BIRDS

Published in 1981 by the Scottish Research Group, Pabay, Broadford,

On receiving a review copy of this book from our fair editor, my first
impulse was to return it, pointing out that as I have, at least since the
autumn of 1948, made only rather casual observations on bird migration
and read only a small part of the vast literature on the subject, I am not
properly qualified to pass judgement on it.
However, before taking this honest course I succumbed to the tempta-
tion to "dip into" it and found it so interesting, so novel in conception
and so (outrageously or justifiably?) iconoclastic, that I felt I could not let
moral scruples stand in the way of my possessing it. Hence this review.
Very briefly and, I fear, doing the author the injustice that any attempt
to thus summarise such a work is bound to do, his claim is that migrating
birds navigate (and sometimes fail successfully to navigate) as a result of
relatively simple responses to overt and obvious stimuli. These are: attrac-
tion to the sun or other sources of light, to remembered landmarks, to
features similar to or suggestive of their home surroundings, and, in the
absence of any such objects, to any salient features, such as moving clouds
or the cloud masses over oceanic islands. Ideally one would need to read
this book in conjunction with the various reports on migration studies
whose hypotheses he questions and whose alleged results he denies. Unless
he has grossly mis-quoted the cited works ( and I do not think he has), he
makes what seems to me a very telling case against at least some of them.
If this is a sample of the products of the Scottish Research Group, I am
not surprised that they complain that "orthodox" editors of ornithological
journals will not publish their offerings. Such refusals may be unjustifiable,
even deplorable but, human nature being what it unfortunately is, hardly
surprising. Did the small boy who noticed and proclaimed that the Emper-
or had no clothes endear himself thereby to the court officials?
Perhaps it is merely because of my ignorance that I finished the book
half convinced by the author. Certainly Mr. Gerrard's theories would
account for such regular apparent anomalies as "Ruckzug" and the fre-
quent sight of parties of Swallows Hirundo rustica passing each other as
they migrate in opposite directions along the same coastline.
Though I do not subscribe to all the author's views about the abilities,

or lack of abilities, of homing pigeons (here miscalled carrier pigeons), as
a one-time member of the Middle East Pigeon Service (1943-44) I think
that when he says (p. 166) "The authorities appeared to have exaggerated
the homing abilities ... for propaganda purposes .", he is en-
tirely right in his opinion and restrained in his expression of it.
The book is illustrated with a wealth of clear, and clearly understan-
dable diagrams and some welcome range maps of various migratory spe-
cies. It is also written well and if with a touch of asperity, even perhaps
acidity here and there, readers will, I think, find this understandable. Who,
alas, could deny that there is at least some truth in his remark (p. 134),
"The final disaster to overtake ornithology was the introduction of specia-
list techniques which, in line with so many other allied sciences, forced
fragmentation of comprehension, often at the expense of sound reason-
ing."?
Whether the future will see Mr. Gerrard win fame as a new, inspired and
correct thinker; roundly and publicly refuted by those whose theories he
has so trenchantly challenged; or found dead in a plastic bag outside an
ornithological laboratory, I would hardly dare to hazard a guess.
I can, however, strongly recommend anyone interested in bird migra-
tion, ornithological controversy, or the more widely important question
of scientific probity to obtain and read his book.

world&amp;apos;s rarest bird of prey. In 1973 the world population was thought to
be only eight or nine birds. It seemed as though the kestrel was doomed to
extinction and in, December of that year, after consultation with some of
the greatest conservation authorities, a pair was captured for a captive
breeding attempt. This was, and still is, regarded as one of the bird&amp;apos;s most
promising hopes for longterm survival. In 1976 Dr. Stanley Temple, dis-
cussing the conservation of the three most endangered Mauritian birds,
the kestrel, the Echo Parrakeet Psittacula echo and the Pink Pigeon Neso-
errns mayeri , claimed that: "By 1980, the captive breeding program should
be capable of producing 20 or more young of each species per year for
restocking and interisland transplants or for distribution to co-operative
breeders". Since 1973 a total of eight kestrels have been taken from the
wild and there have been some limited successes in breeding them, in cap-
tivity. Today no captive Mauri an Kestrels remain, the last one died in
January 1980.
In this article we discuss the plight, of this beautiful falcon and outline
the history of the conservation effort.
Natural History and Status
The Mauritius Kestrel is a unique island form believed to have evolved
from the same ancestral species as the Common Kestrel F. tinnunculus . A
little smaller than its European couterpart, the males weigh about 130 g
and the females about 165 g. The dorsal plumage is not unlike that of a
female Common Kestrel and the breast and abdomen are a creamy white
with neat spots and heart shapes. The kestrel evolved in the evergreen

JONES, STEELE &amp; OWADALLY - MAURITIUS KESTREL BREEDING
forests which once almost completely covered Mauritius, and as a result,
it has developed many accipitrine characteristics - adaptations for a forest
life. The wings are short and rounded, more like those of a Sparrow Hawk
Accipiter nisus than a typical kestrel; it also has longish legs and tail.
A dashing hunter, it preys mainly on large insects, lizards and passerines
which it usually catches beneath the canopy of the forest. More manoeu-
verable than a European or American Kestrel Falco sparverius , most of the
prey is caught after direct flying attacks. These may develop into tail
chases. Occasionally it may stoop at passerines like a large falcon or hover
above scrub lands and drop onto quarry. Prey may be located by still hunt-
ing from a cliff or tree vantage point, or by moving quietly through or
above the forest (Jones, 1980; Jones and Owadally, 1981, in press).
Mauritian Kestrels, in common with most other small falcons, can be
mature at a year old. Courtship flights begin in September or October and
are similar to those of other kestrels and falcons. The kestrels lay their
usual clutch of three eggs during any month between September and (?)
January, in a tree or cliff cavity. The eggs take about 30 days to hatch and
the young remain in the nest for five weeks. After fledging the young are
probably partly fed by the adults for several months and they stay in or
near the parents' breeding territory until the following breeding season
(Jones, 1980).
The main reason for the kestrel's rarity is habitat destruction and al-
teration. Today only about 1-2% of its forest habitat remains. What is
left has been, and continues to be, simplified by introduced "weed" spe-
cies that oust the native plants and destroy the structure of the forest,
turning it into a dense scrub. This causes a reduction in the numbers of
the kestrel's main prey species (Jones and Owadally, 1981). This is almost
certainly the main reason for the low density of kestrels in the habitat
available. In the past some kestrels have been shot by hunters (Temple,
1977) but today this does not occur due to conservation education on
the island. Monkey predation has been suggested as an important cause
of mortality of eggs and young (e.g. McKelvey, 1977; Temple, 1977) but
this remains to be proved.
When Mauritius was first colonised in the 16th century the kestrel
was probably found all over the island. Today it is limited to an area of
about 50 sq. km. of gorges and mountains in the south-west of the island
in and around the Black River Gorges. In April 1973 when Dr. Stanley
Temple first surveyed the population, he could only locate about eight or
nine individuals. By the following June there had been no breeding in the
population, a wild pair had disappeared, three birds had been captured for

captive breeding and only a minimum of four birds remained. Since then
the wild population has increased with at least one to three successful
breeding pairs each year, except in 1975 when no young were produced.
By 1978 the population was believed to be about 10-15, since then the
situation has been thought to have remained stable.
The Captive Breeding Project Personnel and Organisation
In January 1973 Dr. Stanley Temple from the Peregrine Fund of
Cornell University, USA, arrived on Mauritius. He was supported by the
International Council for Bird Preservation and funded by the World Wild-
life Fund (US appeal) and the New York Zoological Society, to study the
Mauritius Kestrel and later some of the other endangered birds. The
project was, until 1976, entirely run by the ICBP, when the Mauritius
Government took over the supervision of the project under A. Wahab
Owadally, Conservator of Forests; however, the ICBP has continued to
manage the technical side of the project. Since 1976 the captive breeding
facilities for the kestrel and other endangered birds and fruit bats are kept
at a purpose-built Government aviary at Black River on the south-west
coast of the island. Before this date the birds were kept in the aviaries of a
private aviculturist, Mr. B. Lenferna, which were closed for personal
reasons.
Temple stayed in Mauritius until February 1975 when William A. New-
lands from Scotland took over the project and stayed until the end of the
year; he was replaced by David S. McKelvey from the USA. In July 1977
Philip Trefry, who had been managing the Canadian Wildlife Service&amp;apos;s Pere-
grine Breeding Project, took over from McKelvey. Trefry stayed until Feb-
ruary 1978 when Fay N. Steele, Curator of Birds from Albuquerque Zoo,
USA, replaced him. Steele was working on a year's leave of absence and
after his period on Mauritius, his work was taken over by Carl G. Jones
from Wales who has been on the island since January 1979. John E.
Cooper, Royal College of Surgeons, England, has been the veterinary
advisor to the project since its inception. In 1978, a Mauritian, Yousoof
Mungroo, spent a year at the Jersey Wildlife Preservation Trust learning
the techniques of breeding endangered animals in captivity. Since his return
to Mauritius he has occupied the post of Scientific Officer in charge of
wildlife and works on the captive breeding project and does field work on
the kestrel and other endangered wildlife.
Aviary Design and Daily Management of the Kestrels
The kestrels were kept in aviaries 2.5 m wide by 7.5 m long and 3 m

high. The framework of steel &amp;apos;tubing is covered with 1 cm welded mesh.
The whole aviary is built on a concrete plinth with a concrete cyclone
shelter built at the rear 2.5 m wide by 1.7 m deep by 2 m high, with a
door from the aviary into the shelter 0.6 m wide by 1.9 m high. Aviaries-
are built in series lying with their lengths adjacent to each other with inter-
connecting doors. The dividing walls between aviaries were entirely screened
with panels made from the mid-rib of the Traveller's Palm (sic) Ravenaia
madagascariensis , so that birds in adjacent aviaries were visually isolated
from each other. The rear 1.5 m of the roof was also screened v/ith Raven-
ala panels to provide some shade and cover. The aviary floor is natural
coral sand and each aviary has one or two small shrubs. Morning Glory
Ipomoea sp. grew over the front and roof. Natural perches of varying
widths were placed on the sides and at either end of the aviary and also in
the cyclone shelters. A permanent concrete bath 0.3 m by 0.3 m by 5 cm
deep (a bit too small and shallow) was provided in each aviary and was
cleaned and filled each day from its own tap. Food was placed on a raised
concrete feeding block with a shallow moat around the base to exclude
ants (Figure 1).
Each aviary had three different nest boxes, a triangular one (placed in
a comer of the cyclone shelter opposite the door) 30 cm high by 40 cm on
the two sides meeting at a right angle, the front had an 8 cm lip. A rectan-
gular nest box 80 cm long x 30 cm wide x 30 cm high with an entrance
hole 45 cn kibg x 20 cm high, was placed high at the rear of the aviary.
The third nest box was the most complex in design and was placed in the
cylcone shelter and entrance was gained via a hole 20 cm x 20 cm in the
wall of the cyclone shelter (Figure 2).
All nest boxes had an ample substrate of coarse sand and wood chips.
Each nest box was used for roosting and caching food, although the
third type of nest box was preferred for egg laying.
The birds were fed once a day; during the non-breeding season they
were given one mouse or the equivalent daily. In the early years of the
project the kestrels were fed day-old cockerel chicks obtained from a
local hatchery, but their use was discontinued because of the risk of
Newcastle disease. They were also fed locally caught passerines and reptiles
but in recent years the diet was mostly domestic, disease-free laboratory
mice and occasionally beef.
The Mauritian Kestrel in Captivity
Prior to this captive breeding project the only evidence that we can
find that the Mauritius Kestrel has previously been kept in captivity is

the account by Guerin (1940) which we have translated from French.
"In April 1830 a 'spotted kestrel' visited the domicile of Julien Des-
jardins in Flacq and stayed for about 15 days in the surroundings, hov-
ering over the poultry-yard, and catching a few chicks here and there.
At last it was shot and as it was slightly hurt, Desjardins kept it in a
cage feeding it raw meat."
Mauritian Kestrels adapt well to a captive life, even wild caught adults
settle down and show reproductive behaviour. They are naturally very
tame and when first brought into captivity, behave in a relaxed manner
even if placed in a relatively open aviary. The kestrels never became al-
armed when the aviaries were entered daily to clean water baths, feeding
surfaces and to feed them. They were so tame that they used to take food
from our fingers. Excess food was temporarily cached in a corner of a
nest box or less often where a branch made an acute angle with an aviary
side.
Bathing was regular, about two to four times a week, and one male
used to occasionally dust bathe. At night the kestrels roosted inside the
nest boxes, less frequently in the cyclone shelters or in a corner of the
aviary. This behaviour is probably adaptive in wild birds since it will
help them avoid cyclones. In the aviary the birds were quite agile and
could fly and grab a cockroach, gecko or wild mouse, turn in a tight
circle of less than a metre and return to a perch, the whole flight being
one fluid movement.
Most of the social and breeding behaviour was reminiscent of that
of other kestrels and will be described under the breeding accounts of
the different females that have been in captivity.

In December 1973 Stanley Temple trapped a mated pair of kestrels.
In March of 1974 the female, believed to have been an old individual,
died of a chronic, and probably long standing, infection of the oviduct.
A replacement female B, believed to be a young unmated bird was trapped
in May 1974.
Female B
Only a few months after capture, on 18th September 1974, she laid
the first egg of a clutch of three eggs. These were placed in an incubator
to encourage her to lay a replacement clutch which she did not. Two of
the eggs were fertile and one hatched. This young kestrel was being hand-
reared but died when 13 days old due to a brooder malfunction (Temple,

1977). The infertile egg was analysed for pesticides and although detec-
table levels of several toxic chemicals were present, they were below the
level normally associated with reproductive disfunction in raptors (Tem-
ple, 1978).
The 1975 breeding season was equally unsuccessful. Two clutches of
three eggs were laid, the first clutch was placed in an incubator and the
female was allowed to incubate the second. Four of the eggs were broken
in an accident and of the remaining two, one was cracked under the
incubating female and one was infertile (Temple, 1976).
In 1976 only a single egg was laid, this was laid on 28th October, nine-
teen days after the first observed mating. It was described by McKelvey
(1977b) as a "great big, oversized, healthy looking egg". The egg was
infertile.
During the 1977 season the pair were first seen copulating on 23rd
September. Two days later it was noted that the kestrels were mating at
least a dozen times a day. On 9th October the female was making a scrape
in the nest box. At the beginning of November the female began spending
a lot of time in the nest box and by the 7th of that month, it was recorded

that she was spending most of the day in the box. Mating continued regu-
larly and the female still continued to spend a lot of time in the nest box.
It was suspected that this female was near the end of her reproductive
life and it was important to replace her with a bird from the wild if the
captive breeding of the kestrel was to succeed. On 13th December Philip
Trefry climbed to a nest site in the Black River Gorges and took the larger
of two nestlings. This bird (Yellow/Blue) was estimated to be about two or
three weeks old.
The young kestrel was hand-fed on finely cut up blouse Geckos Hemi-
dactylus frenatus and Gehyra mutilata and later Agama Lizards Calotes
versicolor and mice. An attempt to interest the captive pair in fostering the
young kestrel was made. On December 16th it was placed in the nest box,
but had to be removed almost immediately since both adults behaved
aggressively to it. The adult pair continued mating regularly but no eggs
were laid. The female was found dead in the nestbox on the morning of
26th January. Post-mortem examination revealed that she had a tumour -
a neoplasm of the oviduct (Cooper, 1979).
It was incorrectly suspected that the young kestrel was a male, so on
22nd December another two young were taken from the wild. These birds
(Yellow and Green) proved to be two males.
Female Yellow/Blue (= Orange)
In early August 1978 it was thought that this bird might be a female.
She was placed with the "Old Male&amp;quot; that was trapped in 1973, but he was
terrified of her even though she showed no aggression towards him. After
two hours together he had become so stressed that they had to be separa-
ted. Old Male died on 18th September and the post-mortem revealed peri-
vascular cellular infiltration of the liver (Cooper, et al, 1981).
A trial pairing was attempted on 15th August with the male Yellow.
He had been housed in a cage adjacent to the female and they often
perched next to each other on either side of the dividing wire. Yellow was
placed in with the female and they appeared quite compatible. During
early September the female started displaying reproductive behaviour and
on the 24th of that month, she laid an egg off the perch which smashed on
the floor. Her reproductive behaviour intensified and she would solicit
copulation and beg for food. During the last week of the month the male
started food passing to the female but no successful copulations were seen.
An infertile egg was taken from the nest box on 1st October and on the
7th another two eggs were removed and placed in the incubator; these
were also infertile. All the eggs laid by this female were infertile and her

second clutch of three eggs was completed on 22nd October when she laid
the third egg in the afternoon. This clutch was taken on the day she laid
the last egg; she again recycled and the third clutch was removed on 2nd
December. In December the one and only copulation attempt was observed
with this pair. A fourth and final clutch, this time of only two eggs was
removed from the nest box on 11th January, 1979. The pair had to be sep-
arated soon after on 31st January as the female had the male pinned to the
floor and we feared that the female would kill him.
The failure of this pair to produce fertile eggs during the 1978/1979
season was originally believed to be because the male was too young. It
later became clear that because she had been partly hand-reared she had
become partly imprinted to humans. Reviewing the events of the breeding
season it would have been wiser to place the female with the male, instead
of vice-versa which had resulted in the female being dominant over the
male. The male was probably capable of breeding but frightened of mating
with the larger, aggressive female.
It was regarded essential that the female was "cured" of her socialisa-
tion problems, and we attempted this by the following means:
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.957107333333333" page_id="56284294"  page_num="200" year="" vol="">
(a) placing the female out of sight of humans, and
(b) forcing her to use the male's aviary for breeding, and
(c) allowing her a choice of males.
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.985452157894737" page_id="56284294"  page_num="200" year="" vol="">
The kestrel aviaries were laid out adjacent to each other, the female sand-
wiched between two males. Screens were placed on the aviary sides so that
the female could not see humans, but could see the male kestrels in the
adjacent aviaries through metre square wire mesh windows set high in the
solid dividing partitions. This allowed her and her prospective partners
clear vision of each other if they desired, but also allowed them to retreat
out of sight.
Nest boxes were placed in the males' aviaries so that the female had to
enter a male's "territory" if she wanted to breed. A great deal of time was
spent preserving the integrity of the males' territories. The males were
managed so that they felt secure in their aviaries. We erected baffles and
secure perching sites, to which the birds could hide behind or retreat to if
they felt threatened.
The female was placed in her seclusion aviary on 5th August, 1979. She
was sandwiched between the male kestrels Red (bred 1978 to wild-caught
pair Blue x Silver, see below) and Green. The male kestrel Green was ad-
jacent to Yellow. On 9th September all three of the above male kestrels
had made nest scrapes. On the same day the dividing window between the
female kestrel and the male kestrel Green was opened. The female was

aggressive to the male so the dividing window was only opened when there
was someone around to keep a close watch on the progress of both birds.
The kestrels were together for a few hours daily until 22nd September
when Green appeared unwell. He died on 26th of the month from a low
grade, probably chronic infection with terminal pneumonia.
On 24th September the female and the male Red were allowed access
to each other via the dividing wire mesh window. This pair were not very
compatible and very little courtship behaviour was seen. The female was
outwardly aggressive to the male and often attacked him. On 23rd October
this pair was separated.
The tips of the female's wings were clipped on 25th October to reduce
her manoeuverability in the aviary so that she would have great difficulty
in catching the male during any aggressive interaction. (This method of
reducing the female's dominance has been used successfully by Campbell
(1976) with Merlins Falco columbarius).
The female kestrel and the male Yellow were placed together on 27th
October. This pair appeared quite compatible although there was some
aggression from the female. Both birds became very vocal, whining and
chittering. The first solicitation by the female was seen on 3rd November
and the first food pass on 5th November. Both birds showed a great deal
of courtship activity and the first copulation was seen on 16th November.
After this date, mating was seen almost daily. During this period both
birds seemed fit although the male occasionally breathed in a laboured
fashion.
During the afternoon of 1st December the female entered "egg laying
lethargy". We were not unduly concerned, and expected the female to lay
fertile eggs. That evening after dark she was sitting on the floor of the
aviary. She was picked up and placed in the nest box. An egg could be
felt in the oviduct. The following morning at 6 a.m. the nest box was
checked, she seemed fit and alert but the egg had not yet been laid. At
8.45 a.m. the nest box was again checked and she was found dead. On
inspecting the body, the egg contents ran out from the cloaca. The body
was taken to the Ministry of Agriculture Veterinary Laboratory and they
diagnosed egg peritonitis and cultured Streptococus pyogenes from the
oviduct, which also contained the egg shell remains (see Cooper et al .,
1981). The male Yellow died on 1st January 1980 after developing
bad sinusitis around both eyes, a swollen tongue and a discharge from the
nostrils on 29th. December. Sinusitis, which first developed in May 1979,
was a recurring problem with both Yellow, Green and most of the other
kestrels.

During early 1978 it was thought that the four captive kestrels were all
males and it was a high priority to trap a female. On 22nd July 1978 on
the cliff above Jules Edouard stream in the Black River Gorges in a known
kestrel territory, Fay Steele caught an adult pair of kestrels simultaneously
on a ballchattri trap baited with House Sparrows Passer domesticus. In the
succeeding months another pair of kestrels took over this nesting territory
and successfully reared three young.
Within an hour of being placed in an aviary both birds had each eaten a
white mouse. They settled down in captivity with no problems and ate the
pieces of chicken, beef and mice offered to them but plainly preferred
mice. They were placed in their permanent aviary on 23rd August and
immediately began to inspect the three nest boxes provided. The following
day they were observed copulating. After this date and for the next month
copulations were frequent - up to twelve times a day. In mid-September
the female started to spend a lot of time in the nest box, staying from 30
minutes to an hour at a time. On 21st September she entered the nest box,
we believe, to start incubating a clutch of eggs.
During the next month the female would emerge from the nest box
sometimes three or more times a day but only for food. The male would
take food from the food block, then fly to a perch and call the female. She
responded by emerging from the box and he would pass food to her; she
would quickly eat, seldom staying out for longer than 15 minutes, then
return to her eggs. During the morning of 23rd October when the male
called her she failed to come out to take her food. At 9.40 a.m. she came
out of the box, took a mouse from the male and returned to the nest
scrape with it. The female was heard clucking and there was a sound of
movement coming from inside the box. She was evidently feeding at
least one chick, which had hatched 32 days after the start of incubation.
On 30th October the nest box was checked and there was a Kestrel
chick and two eggs which proved to be dead in shell. The chick developed
normally and as it grew older, the female would stay longer and longer out
of the box. By 5th November she was staying out for up to 15 minutes at
a time; five days to a week later this period had lengthened to 20-25 min-
utes and on 15th November it was noted that she was staying out of the
box for most of the day but still brooded the chick at night. On 21st
November, the chick spent most of the day standing at the entrance to the
nest box. The following day the parents were trying to entice it to leave
the box. Thirty-six days after hatching on 28th November, the young
kestrel left the nest. This bird Red proved to be a male. After leaving the

nest he was a very poor flyer and flapped and clambered around the
aviary, but within a week he was strong on the wing. He continued to be
fed by the male. On 7th December the fledgling was seen feeding for the
first time by himself, on the food block. A week later the adult male
started to stop the young kestrel from going into the nest box, so the
fledgling was removed and placed in an aviary of his own.
The day the fledgling left the nest box the adult female spent most of
the day in the box and was fed by the male. During succeeding days the
female still maintained a strong interest in the nest box and continued to
be fed by the male although the young kestrel always got his food first.
On 3rd December the adult pair were seen copulating, which was obser-
ved daily until the end of the year. As the year drew to a close, the female
spent longer and longer in the nest box and when it was checked on 31st
December there was one egg present. When the box was again checked on
4th January there were two eggs which completed this clutch. (References
to three eggs being laid in this clutch (e.g. Jones, 1980) are probably
incorrect since a third egg was never seen.)
The pattern of incubation behaviour shown by the adults was similar
to that shown for the first clutch. The male would incubate more fre-
quently than before and would take over the incubation for about five
or ten minutes while the female was feeding. During incubation the fe-
male would usually be given food by the male in a food pass, occasionally
the female would retrieve cached food for herself if the male was out of
sight, for example while he was incubating. The change over between the
female and the male was initiated by either sex. Sometimes the female
would emerge from the box and wait for the male to fetch food for her, or
he would call (whine) and she would emerge from the box. While out of
the nest box the female defaecated, stretched wings, tail and legs by uni-
lateral stretching and preened and roused (ruffling feathers and body
shaking). After feeding the female would usually call the male (whine)
and he would leave the box, sometimes the change over occurred without
any vocalisations.
On 3rd February a broken egg was found beneath one of the perches,
the contents were rotten and it was not possible to say whether it had
been fertile. The remaining egg was removed from the nest box on 11th
February; it was thin and brittle, had a crack in it and all the contents had
run out.
After the 1978/79 breeding season the female often looked unwell but
we were not unduly alarmed since she seemed to be eating adequately.
Although a little overweight, we did not restrict her food intake since it

was suspected that she was carrying pesticides, stored in her fat.
In 1979 we never observed any courtship activity between the pair. On
1st October the female was seen shuffling in the rectangular nest box and
on inspection there were two nest scrapes present. The male completely
ignored the female. During October the female whined with excitement at
feeding time, and when she could see the kestrels in the adjacent aviaries
and also whined softly when in the nest box. The male showed no reaction
to the female's behaviour. He behaved as if ravenously hungry, mantling
over his food and retreating away from the female. By the end of October
it became obvious that the male was unwell. He always appeared very
hungry despite being in plump condition, his eyes appeared glazed and he
occasionally showed poor co-ordination. We removed him on 9th Novem-
ber and he died on 25th November; postmortem examination showed that
he had peritonitis, sinusitis and small quantities of pesticides in his tissues
(Cooper et al , 1981).
The day that the male was removed from this pair, the female was
placed in an aviary adjacent to her son Red. This pair could see each
other via a wire mesh window built into the aviary side. Within a few
minutes of placing the female in the adjacent aviary the male started to
call the female with a high pitched "tink-tink-tink". The male was calling
to the female while perched opposite to her and also while he was in
the nest box. They were allowed together the following day, both birds
having access to both aviaries. Courtship progressed rapidly; the female
started to solicit to the male, and the male food passed to the female on
the first day they were together. Both birds became very vocal, whining
and chittering, and the male tinking. The first copulation was seen two
days later on 12th November. After this date, copulation was seen about
once daily. Towards the end of November courtship was noticeably
beginning to wane until by mid-December there was no obvious court-
ship behaviour.
In mid-December both birds appeared in good health. At the end of
December the female looked a little unwell and sat dozing for much of
day and she gave the impression of being an old bird. On 4th January she
was found dead on the floor of the aviary. Post-mortem results were in-
conclusive, but she did have sinusitis and small amounts of pesticides in
her tissues. Red remained in good health until 12th January when in the
evening he was showing laboured and distressed breathing. He died the
following day from a respiratory infection, the body was also examined
for viruses, chlamydiae and mycoplasmas, and a new species of myco-
plasma was identified (Cooper et al., 1981).

Captive Breeding: a Reappraisal
The deaths of all the captive kestrels was a terrible disappointment to
everyone involved in its conservation. Post-mortem results suggest that the
deaths were multifactorial in origin and no one condition could be incrim-
inated. All the captive birds had short reproductive lives. Three of the
four female kestrels that have been in captivity died from oviduct condi-
tions. Only one female thrived for more than one breeding season, two of
the birds produced eggs for only one season and one failed to breed at all.
The poor reproductive success shown by the kestrel in captivity is of
especial interest since Brown and Amadon (1968) attributed the decline of
the species to "genetic deterioration". Cooper (1979), Temple (1978),
Jones (1980) and Cooper et al. (in press), all suggest that the reproductive
conditions from which some of the captive kestrels have suffered may be
under genetic control. Poor reproductive success could also account for
the extreme rarity of the kestrel in the wild, although available evidence
does not support this.
Despite all of the problems that have been encountered with the cap-
tive kestrels, we believe that it is a suitable bird for captive breeding. It
adapts well to captivity and all the captive birds, if they have lived long
enough, have shown reproductive behaviour. Since the beginning of the
project in 1973 eight birds have been taken from the wild. Five of these
were adults and three as nestlings. Three of the females were taken as ad-
ults and may have been at the end of their reproductive lives.
In a recent document (Jones and Owadally, 1981) it has been argued
that the Mauritius Kestrel's best chance of survival is through captive
breeding. In future years it is proposed to take eggs and young from the
wild for another attempt at captive propagation. Further to this we shall
pursue the study of the kestrel in the wild to precisely determine the
causes of its low population. Hopefully our studies will help secure the
future of this beautiful falcon.

By DAVID M. BIRD and NANCY B. REHDER
(Macdonald Raptor Research Centre, McGill University, Quebec, Canada)
In the late 1960's, as it became evident that many raptor populations
were decreasing in the wild, the advantages of establishing captive colo-
nies were recognised. Today colonies of Prairie Falcons Falco mexicanus ,
Lanner Falcons Falco biannicus , Peregrine Falcons Falco peregrinus, Euro-
pean Kestrels Falco tinnunculus and most recently Gyrfalcons Falco
rusticolus have been established at various centres throughout the world
(Cade and Temple, 1977).
For over 3,000 years falconers have provided and continue to provide
useful baseline information concerning the care and health of their birds.
However, a captive colony opens up many new research fields that a
falconer cannot adequately explore. When large sample sizes are used,
statistical analysis can qualify and quantify significant variations and
differences. Raptor research not only increases in scope and quality but
also in efficiency since experimental birds are always on hand. The need
to take birds continuously from the wild is minimised. A colony also gives
the researcher more control over the sex, age and genotype of each bird in
a given experiment.
Although one of the immediate goals of raptor breeding is to restore
endangered populations, the larger falcons, such as the Peregrine, are less
reliable as captive breeders and certainly require more attention and
expense than the smaller raptors. The American Kestrel Falco sparverius
has been selected by several researchers (Willoughby and Cade, 1964;
Porter and Wiemeyer, 1970; Lincer 1975; Mueller, 1977), including the
staff at the Macdonald Raptor Research Centre (MRRC), in establishing
a captive colony. Having an average weight of 120 gm. and a total average
length of 21 cm., this bird is the smallest raptor in North America. Hous-
ing space and feeding costs are thus minimised and handling and care are
simplified. The male and female plumages are quite distinctive, facilitating
sexing. This species breeds readily in captivity. Because the bird is indigen-
ous to North America surplus offspring can be released without disturbing
the ecosystem and studies on captive birds can be readily compared and
applied to the field situation.
The MRRC began in 1973 with 10 pairs of American Kestrels. The
colony now numbers 100 pairs. The vast scope and significance of research

that such a colony permits can best be illustrated by examining the MRRC
research programme. In an attempt to improve raptor management,
particularly breeding success, kestrels were used to compare the success of
artificial insemination (AI) to natural mating, artificial to natural incuba-
tion, and hand-rearing to natural rearing. An AI technique modified for
the kestrel was found to provide a 15% higher fertility rate than natural
mating (Bird et al , 1976). The kestrels produced by AI were
as healthy as those bred naturally (Bird et al, 1976). In fact some of the
AI birds produced in 1974 successfully mated and fledged young in 1975
probably constituting the first birds of prey ever to do so in history. The
AI technique has assisted raptor breeders in making use of birds not willing
to mate naturally, while providing insight into the reproductive physiology
of raptors and paving the way for genetically controlled breeding experi-
mentation.
Hatchability of eggs in forced-air Marsh Farms Roll-X incubators
(temperature 99.5*F; relative humidity 50-60%) (College Pets, Poultry
and Garden Supplies, Toronto, Ontario) did not significantly differ from
natural incubation (Bird, 1978). Hand-reared chicks were associated with
slower growth rates and the production of physically smaller adults. Hand-
reared females laid the largest clutches, the largest and heaviest eggs, and
were associated with higher fertility than hand-reared males.
In the area of reproductive physiology, it has been established that the
kestrel's average duration of fertility and semen production is 8.1 days
(Bird and Buckland, 1976) and 73.6 days (Bird and Lague, 1977), respec-
tively. A correlation was found between body weight and semen volume,
body weight and sperm count per ejaculation, and semen volume and
sperm count per ejaculation (Bird and Lague, 1977).
Photoperiod, hormonal and forced renesting studies have been under-
taken to test their viability as techniques to induce raptors to breed. Kes-
trels were induced by artificial photoperiod to undergo a successful
out-of-season breeding period between two consecutive successful spring
breeding periods. Fertility (85.2%), hatchability of fertile eggs (47.6%)
and fledging success (100%) in the winter season were all highly comparable
to that achieved during the spring breeding seasons (Bird et al, 1980).
The relationship of hormone levels to reproductive behaviour is being
studied currently by the junior author. It is hoped that knowledge of
hormone profiles in the American Kestrel will lead to the development of
hormone injections that will stimulate endangered avian species to breed
in captivity.
Research into forced # renesting indicated that this is a successful

method of inducing the kestrel to lay a second clutch. Replacement
clutches had fewer and longer eggs with thicker shells than first clutches,
but they did not differ in fertility, hatchability, overall growth and fledg-
ing success of the young (Bird, 1978). The age of the female parent
significantly affected both the renesting interval (overall mean *- S.E.
was 11 i 0.22 days) and clutch size (overall mean ~ S.E. was 4.74 -
significantly affected both the renesting interval (overall mean -- S.E.
was 11 -- 0.22 days) and clutch size (overall mean * S.E. was 4.74 --
0.69 eggs) in that renesting intervals were shorter in older, experienced
layers and clutch size increased by one-fifth of an egg with each additi-
onal year of age (Bird, 1978).
Bird and Ho (1976) determined that captive kestrels maintain their
health on a daily diet of day-old cockerels with calcium supplements and
SA-37 vitamin/mineral additives (Roger-STB, Division of BTI Products,
Inc., Pointe Claire, Quebec) during the breeding season. In hopes of
improving the diet of captive birds, prey items of wild populations (i.e.
sparrows, voles and grasshoppers) have been chemically analysed (Bird,
ms in preparation).
Studies on haematological parameters in kestrels at MRRC revealed
mean values of red blood cells (RBC), packed cell volume (PVC) and total
plasma protein (TP) of 3.2 x 10^/mm. , 33.6% and 2.74 gm% respectively
(Snyder et al, 1981). There was no significant difference (p 0.1) bet-
ween sexes or between juvenile and breeding birds for any of these blood
parameters (Snyder et al , 1981).
Within the last decade, the American Kestrel has proved to be a parti-
cularly valuable subject for pesticide research (Wiemeyer and Porter, 1970;
Lincer, 1975). At MRRC the effects of a PCB (Aroclor 1254), Mirex, and
PCB plus Mirex on reproductive characteristics of male kestrels were
studied. There were no apparent effects of any of these chemicals on
fertility and on hatchability of fertile eggs (Tucker, 1981). Neither the
effect of the PCB nor of Mirex on semen volume was significant (p 0.05)
but the PCB/Mirex combination caused a significant increase (p 0.01). All
treatments significantly reduced sperm concentrations (p 0.01), but only
the PCB and Mirex treatments significantly reduced sperm number per
ejaculation (p 0.05). Sperm motility was unaffected (p 0.05) by any
treatment (Tucker, 1978).
Cross-fostering experiments with European and American Kestrels have
thus far revealed that a kestrel is most likely to choose mates of the
species with which it was fostered, regardless of whether or not it is a
conspecific (Bird and Goldblatt, 1981). Now MRRC is attempting to
determine whether effects of cross-fostering are reversible.

A wild colony is gradually being established locally with the aid of
nest boxes. By marking all birds and monitoring populations, MRRC
personnel hope to determine the maximum breeding density, the influ-
ence of habitat (rural versus urban versus suburban) on reproduction and
the difference in survival and reproductive biology of released captive-bred
stock with wild-raised birds.
With the establishment of raptor colonies, the science of breeding
birds of prey can now begin to develop. It was recognised long ago that
if domestic poultry were to be a productive source of food, breeding had
to be approached scientifically. Today, several journals (e.g. Poultry
Science ) are dedicated solely to the promotion of scientific research
on poultry. If raptor populations are to be managed effectively, it may be
necessary to re-enact poultry history and give captive breeding of falcons
full recognition as a science.

warmer parts of the western hemisphere. The feathers are black, as is its
bare-skinned head. The underside of the primary feathers are greyish and
show as a white patch in flight. There is no sexual dimorphism.
The breeding season naturally occurs in early spring with copulation
taking place on the ground. No constructed nest is made but instead they
make use of caves, holes in ledges and cliffs, hollow trees and other cavities.
Usually two eggs are laid and both parents share in the incubation of 32-39
days. Parents regurgitate food in liquid form which the chicks eat by stick-
ing their heads inside their parent's open bill.
In September 1962, Lincoln Park Zoo received one adult pair of Black
Vultures. They were kept in an open enclosure during warm weather and
transferred to a closed heated den (10 ft x 6 ft x 6 ft) with a straw floor
during the winter. No breeding ever occurred. This procedure of moving
the birds twice a year continued until spring 1976 when we decided to
open the den, giving access to an open flight cage measuring 20 ft x 20 ft x

20 ft, rather than transferring them. They continued to use the den as well.
On 5th July 1977, an egg was found in a corner of the den. It was light
in colour with dark, reddish brown blotches. We removed the egg, replaced
it with a wax-filled goose egg, similar in size and shape, and put it in the
incubator. The parents, meanwhile, continued to incubate the dummy egg.
A week later, on 12th July, we candled the egg, found it to be fertile and
placed it back in the den with the adults. A second egg had been laid which
was also left in the den and the dummy egg was removed. One or both
adults remained in the den at all times. On 14th August, 41 days after the
first egg was found, we could hear the chick tapping from inside the egg.
Two days later, when we checked the eggs, no sounds were heard. In both
eggs we found fully-formed dead chicks.
Another clutch was started on 24th September, when one egg was
found in the den and a second egg on 28th September. The adults took
turns incubating them. The first egg pipped on 2nd November and hatched
the next day, 41 days after the egg was discovered. The chick was covered
with a fluffy tan down, except for its bill, head and legs. The bill and head
were black and naked, the legs a dark brown. On 5th November both
adults were out of the den together and no sounds were heard coming from
the den. The next day we checked the den and found that the chick was
gone and the second egg was broken. A piece of shell was found that
smelled rotten and we suspected that when the second egg broke, or was
broken by the parents, some of its contents got on the chick which they
ate together with the rotten egg.
Eggs were found again on 25 and 26th February. They were left with
the adults and we found them broken on 11th March. Eggs were found
again on 24th April but one was broken and the other infertile.
We successfully hand-reared a chick in 1978. On 31st May we suspected
that there were eggs in the den as the female was inside all day and the
following day we found two eggs and removed the smaller, placing it in a
Humidaire incubator under a dry bulb of 37.2*C and wet bulb of 29.4*C.
The egg measured 71.8 mm x 51.5 mm and weight 102 grams. It was can-
died on 5th June and appeared to be fertile. We checked the den on 9th
June since both adults were outside all morning, and no trace of the sec-
ond egg was found.
On 1st July we put the developing egg into a Lyon Rural Electric
Hatcher, on 4th July the egg pipped, and the chick hatched out two days
later, thirty-seven days after the egg was discovered. The yolk sac was still
attached to the shell as well as to the chick's body. He seemed very strong
and alert as soon as he was dry.

The diet we used was new-born mice, with the legs and tail removed, and
90 grams of ground raw horsemeat of the Nebraska Brand Bird of Prey
diet. This was put in a solution of 700 mg of Entozyme (a digestive
enzyme), 2 oz. of water and one teaspoon of calcium gluconate, and
incubated for two or more hours at 32.2*C. The chick weighed 73 grams
when he had completely dried. We kept him in a human infant incubator
at a temperature between 32.2*C and 32.8*C and some twigs were placed
in a dish for him to stand on. At first we fed him on one and a half
newborn mice, cut into small pieces, every two to three hours and this
amount increased as he grew as we always fed him with enough to fill his
crop. By the sixth day he was vocalising a lot before each feed and contin-
ued to be very active. His weight gain was tremendous and by the twelfth
day he weighed 143 grams and was eating off the plate by himself.
Although he was still covered with down, pin feathers started to show
through on 24th July, at 18 days. We started to take him outside for sun-
shine and exercise when he was four weeks old. He was very aggressive and
demanded food all the time. When he was five weeks old, we reduced the
incubation of the food in Entozyme to half an hour. At seven weeks old,
the Entozyme was eliminated and we were feeding him a whole chicken
split down the middle, in its own juices, and half a cup of Bird of Prey
diet inside the chicken.
By now the chick had some wing and tail feathers although most of
his body was still covered with down. His heaviest weight occurred at
nine weeks when it reached 2,073 grams but this eventually went down
and stabilised at about 1,850 grams. He was almost fully feathered at
ten weeks and on 1st November, at about four months, he was put into
an outside sheltered den similar to his parents'.

VULTURES IN CAPTIVITY IN SOUTHERN AFRICA

By P.J. MUNDY (Vulture Study Group, Endangered Wildlife Trust,
P.O. Box 1941, Salisbury, Zimbabwe)
and E. MARAIS (De Wildt Cheetah Research and Breeding Centre,
P.O. Box 178, De Wildt, 0251 South Africa)
Vultures in captivity provide a spectacle of enduring interest to the
public, if only for the repulsion that their supposedly loathsome habits
arouses. In Africa these great scavengers are known to everybody, as the
birds play such a conspicuous and even fascinating role in wildlife and
ranching areas, and it would, therefore, be unthinkable for a zoo not to
have some vultures on display. In very recent years, however, the emphasis
in all reputable establishments has moved away from one simply of display
to that of research and conservation awareness. Our article describes this
progress and notes some of the problems and successes along the way.

MUNDY &amp; MARAIS - VULTURES IN SOUTHERN AFRICA
In all countries of southern Africa vultures are accorded Royal Game
status. That is, no one is allowed to hunt such animals without a permit
from the Minister. To keep vultures in captivity also requires such a gov-
ernment permit from the appropriate nature conservation department, and
a watchful control is thus maintained over these and other animals.
Aviaries
Five aviaries in South Africa and one in Zimbabwe hold 55 vultures of
six species among them (Table 1); all six are major aviaries open to the
public. Odd individuals are also kept in other places in the subcontinent,
but these must amount to very few additional birds. By far the commonest
species maintained in captivity is the Cape Griffon Vulture Gyps copra-
theres, and this is indeed appropriate as it is the only vulture endemic to
southern Africa. No public aviary as yet holds a Lammergeyer (Bearded
Vulture) Gypaetus barbatus , considered by some to be a vulture. The Lar-
von Bird Gardens near Salisbury (Zimbabwe) keeps six species, and three
of these species are not known to be held anywhere else in the subcon-
tinent.
The Salisbury aviary is marquee-shaped, and measures 33 m long by
16 m wide by 6.5 m high. A conspicuous feature of wild vultures is their
soaring behaviour in thermals, but this kind of flight cannot possibly be
catered for in an aviary. We believe, therefore, that vultures should be kept
in a low aviary of large ground area; the Salisbury aviary has a volume of
2400 cu m, for example, and the birds can easily flap their way around in
a circuit. The aviary in the National Zoological Gardens of South Africa
(Pretoria) has approximately the same ground area but is higher, and it is
noticeable that several of its 20 vultures do not use the perches at the top,
which thus represents "wasted space". A captive Cape Griffon Vulture
averages about 9 kg in body weight and even in breezy conditions it may
struggle to get airborne. Flapping flight must, however, be encouraged in
captive vultures in order to exercise them and to counteract a tendency
towards obesity, especially in the two species of Griffon Vultures which
are greedy feeders. A long, wide aviary offers the best opportunity for
flapping.
This aspect of thermals has a second interesting consequence. In the
wild, vultures are rarely if ever seen shading themselves, yet the birds
so readily take off into a breeze that we consider their soaring behaviour
also provides some cooling function. In the absence of such flight in an
aviary, therefore, the birds must have access to shade and in the Salisbury

aviary vultures of all species often rest in the shade during the middle part
of the day.
The birds are fed at frequencies ranging from daily to twice per week,
on a wide variety of food. Depending on the location, the staple diet may
be cow, sheep, horse or donkey with rabbits, guinea pigs, day-old chicks
and cow livers as additions. Bone fragments are also provided. As noted
above, the Griffon Vultures feed very rapidly and a bird could swallow 1 kg
of meat in two minutes. We find it useful, therefore, to feed meat on the
bone (such as cows' heads) so that a Griffon Vulture must work harder for
its food and other species then have a chance to get their supply. The body
weights of the birds can be monitored, and compared with the average for
wild vultures, and we can regulate the food supply accordingly. In contrast
to hand-reared nestlings, the older birds seem fairly resistant to the devel-
opment of fault bars in their feathers on what is no doubt a dull diet com-
pared to that of their wild counterparts. Diets are not supplemented with
vitamins.
Breeding
Until recently we had known of no instance of a vulture being bred
successfully in captivity in southern Africa. Birds had paired, mated and
laid eggs in at least three establishments (Cape Town, Pretoria and Salis-
bury) but no egg had hatched. However, during the 1950s and 1960s
several young Cape Vultures were reared by their parents at Bloemfontein
Zoo, during the curatorship of C.A. van Ee. He records that bone frag-
ments were supplied to the breeding birds, and that their food was never
supplemented with bonemeal or vitamins (van Ee, 1981). This rearing
technique can be corroborated by one of us (P.J.M.) who has successfully
hand-reared 16 chicks of two species of Griffon Vulture on diets consisting
only of meat and bone fragments. Some of these chicks developed fault
bars in their feathers, and this seemed to be a result of feeding them meat
from only one kind of animal, even though the food was supplied in plen-
tiful amounts (as judged by the chicks' weight gains). That is, fault bars
developed from a poor food quality rather than a low food quantity (see
also Anthony et al., 1980). However, we emphasise that rigorous experi-
ments on this aspect have not been performed.
In recent years pairs of Cape Vultures have made nests and laid single-
egg clutches, but have not yet hatched them. At Pretoria, a facsimile of a
cliff with ledges has been erected on one side of the aviary, and one pair of
birds immediately made a nest at the top. The male of this pair was reared
in the wild in 1973 (and ringed as a chick), and the first egg was laid in

1979 just after the cliff was made. The male therefore was very nearly six
years of age, and was the first known-aged Cape Vulture found breeding,
albeit in captivity. This is a similar age to a female European Griffon
Vulture G. fulvus which was found breeding in the wild in 1976 having
been ringed as a chick in 1971 (Terrasse, 1977).
In all establishments, the breeding vultures formed part of a larger
assemblage of vultures in aviaries. Thus the pairs were subject to distur-
bance both from the other birds and from cleaning operations, neither of
which are conducive to a good reproductive performance (J. Glasier,
H. Mendelssohn, pers. comm.). And indeed, the eggs have usually been
broken. In the 1980s breeding pairs will be separated into their own small
cages, and the National Zoological Gardens of South Africa has established
this standard at De Wildt, with many species of raptor.
Research
There are six species of vulture in southern Africa (Table 1), though the
Egyptian Vulture Neophron percnopterus is very rare. Two additional spe-
cies, the Lammergeyer and the Palm-nut Vulture (Vulturine Fish Eagle)
Gypohierax angolensis , are sometimes considered to be vultures, but
neither as yet are kept in captivity. Whilst our longterm aim of trying to
get all species to breed is in agreement with that of the curators of most
reputable establishments, we also believe in using the captive birds when-
ever possible for research purposes.
Vultures take about six years to develop their adult plumage, and in
each of the six years of the life of an immature bird, a slightly different
coloration is adopted. Thus, a first-year White-headed Vulture Trigono-
ceps occipitalis , for example, wears a drab, uniformly brown plumage, and
the crown of its head is also brown. Each year it moults into intermediate
plumages (Figure 1) that increasingly approximate the final and definitively
adult livery. If the weight of the bird is kept to the average for wild birds,
we then assume that it moults at the same rate as do the wild birds. To
characterise each plumage stage is an essential aspect of our programme on
the biology of wild vultures, and each species has one main feature that
indicates a bird's age. Thus, in the case of the White-headed Vulture, this
key feature is the colour of the downy feathers on the bird's head, and to
a lesser extent those on the crop.
Captive birds are used for simple experiments on their food require-
ments and standard metabolic rates (J. Komen, pers. comm.), and for harm-
less studies on parasite life cycles and disease transmission, in particular for
experiments with the anthrax bacillus (Houston and Cooper, 1975; V. de

Vos, pers. comm.). These veterinary studies are of great relevance to
vulture researchers worldwide, as in some places vultures are persecuted
because of their supposed role in the transmission of disease among dom-
estic livestock.
Captive birds may also be used for determining the values of blood
parameters. Our own haematological studies arose from a very distressing
syndrome of epileptiform seizures in captive Griffon Vultures (Mundy and
Foggin, 1981). Apart from routine blood profiles, there is also a need for
studies on the effects of starvation on blood glucose; a preliminary ex-
periment in Salisbury showed that both species of Griffon Vulture easily
withstood two weeks of enforced starvation (with free access to water),
and we personally believe that a Cape Vulture in good condition could fast
for one month. The four vultures in this experiment lost body weight at
the rate of about 100 g per day.

Since its inception in 1973, the Vulture Study Group has remained an
informal gathering of people from varying walks of life who are interested
in one way or another in the lives of vultures. Today, the Group has three
main aims:- (a) to study the biology of each species; (b) by conservation
and management to ensure the survival of the vulnerable Cape Vulture;
and (c) to publicise the plight of vultures and thus revise people's attitude
to this much maligned group of birds. The Vulture Study Group is a
working group of the Endangered Wildlife Trust, which is a non-profit
and non-governmental organisation that raises funds for endangered
wildlife research and conservation. Our philosophy rests on the concept
that a group of people must take a group of species under their protec-
tion and assume responsibility for their survival. This concept is brought
into particular focus by a mobile animal such as the vulture which can
cruise throughout the length and breadth of southern Africa (an area of
about 3.5 million square kilometres, south of the Zambesi and Cunene
rivers). Thus our endemic Cape Vulture flies over land cared for by no
less than 17 official government conservation departments. We believe
that the interests of such an animal are best served by an independent
(and equally mobile)group of people, who themselves are best co-ordina-
ted by a professional biologist. Thus we pursue several projects, among
which the captive birds form just one part.
Early in our programme we discovered that a well-presented vulture,
exhibited at a school, a show, a shopping centre or a lecture, was its own
best ambassador. People would reverse their feelings of revulsion to ad-

miration, and this about-face was more easily accomplished than trying to
engender a positive response out of disinterest. As one example of this we
could mention our "ricketty" birds, and the interest and sympathy that
they have aroused (Figure 2). The syndrome of twisted and broken wing
bones is caused by a lack of bone fragments in the diets of the chicks
(Mundy and Ledger, 1976), as a result of the elimination of the bone-
crunching hyaenas in the foraging range of the adult vultures; it is correct-
ly called metabolic bone disease or osteodystrophy (Cooper, 1978). After
we displayed the problem on television, several livestock ranchers took to
breaking up the skeletons of carcasses in their own effort to help the birds.
As the rancher is precisely the person who inadvertently supplies much of
the food for the Cape Vulture, this demonstration of care for the bird's
problems is an important step forward.

The Bearded Vulture or Lammergeyer Gypaetus barbatus is one of the
largest flying birds, with a wingspan of nearly 9 feet. It inhabits the high,
remote mountains from southern Europe to the Himalayas. A smaller sub-
species is found in Africa.
Bearded Vultures are becoming extremely rare in the wild and up till
now, have seldom been bred in captivity apart from the notable record of
the Royal Zoological Gardens, Sofia, Bulgaria, which used to breed this
vulture regularly. The Director, Dr. Ad. Schumann, has written exten-
sively on the breedings and A.A. Prestwich (1955) summarised these
accounts as follows: "The first success was in 1916, and up to 1928 nine
young Lammergeyers had been reared with only one failure recorded.
"The hen usually laid during the first week or so in January. The clutch
was two on each occasion, except 1925-26 when only one egg was laid.
The incubation period was 55-58 days. Both eggs were always fertile;
invariably the second nestling was killed and partially eaten within two or
three days of hatching. The one occasion on which the second young one
was rescued, it died within four days.
"In March 1929 there were eleven offspring of the original pair living
in the Sofia Zoo. These events took place in an aviary 6 metres long, 7
deep and 8 high."
Malcolm Davis (1931) mentions a very tame pair in the National
Zoological Park, Washington D.C., and says: "This pair was probably bred
in captivity." Possibly they had come from the Sofia Zoo.
In recent years our zoo has been attempting to breed these magnificent
birds and now, after many setbacks, it seems that we are on the right road.
It all started 18 years ago, when four of these birds (subspecies aureus )
arrived at our zoo from Russia. They were at least six years old because
they were already in full adult colour and although males and females are
practically identical (females are slightly heavier), we were fairly sure that
we had two pairs. Observing them during long periods, we noticed that
they often formed two couples. Each individual was recognisable by little
differences in the head and breast markings.
For many years it was our ambition to breed them and to increase
our chances, we decided to provide them with more privacy. Each (pre-
sumed) pair was placed in individual aviaries which were not shared with

other birds. One aviary measured 5x14x6 metres high and the other one
6 x 12 x 5 metres high. The aviaries were provided with perching poles,
nesting places and shallow bathing pools. Both aviaries were surrounded by
some trees, which reduced the sunshine to a few hours a day.
It was not until recent years that both pairs started to lay eggs and
these mostly appeared fertile, thus proving that we had two true pairs.
Although the parents incubated their eggs very well, all chicks disappeared
out of the nests on the day of hatching. Last year one youngster was hand-
reared, but unfortunately died after two and a half months, probably due
to osteomalacia. This was a little better than the year before when, for
the first time, we tried to hand-rear such a chick. It died after only one
week from an omphalitis.
In order to obtain much better breeding results from our Bearded
Vultures we now have well advanced plans for building two new large
aviaries. They will be located at a much quieter place, a little further away
from our visitors and not surrounded by large, shade-giving trees. The
nesting platforms will be built 6 m above the ground, against a stone wall
and facing north, just like the niches that Bearded Vultures like to use in
the wild. They will also get high perching poles and platforms, a grass
plot and a shallow bathing pool with rocks nearby. Our experience is that
Bearded Vultures occasionally like to take a bath in their pool but after-
wards do not manage to fly away because they have become too wet. They
must first dry themselves, somewhat like cormorants do when their
feathers have become wet. The new aviaries will also be free of obstacles in
the middle part to make flying easier for the birds.
The Dutch Appeal of the World Wildlife Fund will contribute #3,000
to help our zoo accomplish this breeding project in the coming year. To-
gether with a few other European zoos, we have agreed to co-operate with
a new World Wildlife Fund/International Union for the Conservation of
Nature project (No. 1657), the aim of which is to reintroduce Bearded
Vultures into the Alps where they were exterminated nearly a century ago.
We have promised to give all the Bearded Vultures that we breed to be
released in the wild. They will receive full protection in these nature res-
erves and will be looked after as long as necessary.
It will probably take another year before the new aviaries are ready to
accommodate our two breeding pairs. In the meantime we have improved
both of their old aviaries as far as possible. These aviaries are functional
but we do not consider them ideal for breeding. We enlarged the nesting
platforms and placed walls and ledges nearby. Also the aviaries were
better equipped with more perches and new feeding platforms. In the

wooden doors at the back of the nesting platforms, we mounted a small,
one-way glass spy hole so that we could observe all the activity of the birds
without being seen by them. To avoid disturbance, ladders to the nests at
the back of the aviaries were permanently fastened and placed out of
sight. With these temporarily improved aviaries we had hopes of better
breeding results in the next season.
We were rather disappointed when last November (1979) only one of
our breeding pairs wanted to occupy its new nesting platform. The other
pair preferred their old nest, which was built under a shelter on the ground.
We had not yet removed it to give the birds more choice. Both pairs made
rather large nests, using all kinds of nest material which we regularly spread
on the floor of the aviary. They took beakfuls of grass sods, short sticks,
heather and fir tree twigs into their nests, one by one. We even found some
remains of their food in their nests, such as pieces of hide and bones. Large
amounts of sheepwool and hay were used by them for the inside lining of
the nest. This was an ideal insulation for the eggs against the cold winter
temperatures which also occur during their natural breeding season in
January and February, high in the mountains. We were very hopeful about
the breeding pair which had occupied the newly-built nesting platform. On
the day the first egg was laid, they started incubating it by turns. Naturally
the keepers in charge, Mr. J. Odijk and Miss F. van Rest, avoided any dis-
turbance in or near the aviaries during the incubation period. They even
stopped most of the cleaning in the cage. The food choice was now grad-
ually changed from cattle and sheep meat and split bones with marrow to
more freshly-killed rabbits and guinea pigs. Although the parents always
had sufficient food available and were never disturbed, they unfortunately
killed their chicks after hatching, leaving some bloodmarks behind as evi-
dence.
The other breeding pair, as mentioned, preferred to use their same old
nest again. We thought that they had less chance of success because the
conditions for them were now exactly the same as in the previous year
when they had killed their chicks in the eggshell (the day after we had
found some remains containing blood in the nest). This year, therefore,
we decided to remove their two eggs and put them into an egg-incubator,
one week before the predicted hatching day. We believed that it was not
worth the risk of losing the eggs again, although we realised that the
chance of having imprinted birds was fairly likely. The eggs were coloured
dull salmon and mottled with light brown. The eggs were not dipped in
an egg dip solution before being put in the incubator but we did take all
other hygienic precautions to avoid infections of the eggs in the incubator.

The temperature was set at 37.5*C with a maximum humidity. On 24th
February 1980, a small hole appeared in the shell of one of the eggs but
it took more than two whole days before the chick hatched completely.
This was after 53 days' incubation. We have also observed long hatching
periods with chicks of other vulture species in our zoo. The second chick
hatched on 2nd March. Both were allowed to dry out before being moved
into a hospital baby incubator with a temperature set between 30* - 32*C.
The chicks had a greyish white down and a brown bar across their cheeks.
After a week the temperature was changed to 26* - 28*C; this was necess-
ary because we noticed that when the temperature rose above 30*C, the
chicks would continually gasp for breath, apparently getting too hot. The
incubator was not standing in our chick rearing room but at the home of
our Head Keeper of the Bird Section, Mr. L. van der Voort. His wife, a
former bird keeper, took charge of the chicks' care during the first weeks.
Every two to two and a half hours, except at night, they were fed young
pink mice and freshly killed, skinned and cut up mice and guinea pigs
(flesh, lungs, heart, Ever and so on). At the same time the incubator was
cooled and cleaned. A 4% multi-vitamin/mineral preparation was added to
every meal. We used "Carnicon" (Trouw, Putten, the Netherlands), which
contained 11.5% Ca and 0.5% P, especially prepared with a flavour for
carnivorous mammals.
The younger chick did not appear viable and died a few days after
hatching. It seemed very weak and abnormally formed. Its eyes were of
different sizes and it kept its head a little sideways. This did not improve
after a few days. It vomited its food after nearly every meal. The other
chick did not cause us much trouble and within a few days it was obviously
becoming much stronger. It could hold up its head for short periods without
bobbing. When it was hungry, it made loud, chirping cries and when fed, it
would gape rather like a young songbird does. The amount of food fed daily
was about 25-30% of its body weight.
By two and a half weeks, the young Bearded Vulture (we called it
"Esthel") was taken out of the incubator and placed in a large artificial
nesting box. In the bottom we placed an electric waterproof heating pil-
low, connected to a thermostat. Above this nest we hung up a heating
lamp,run on a separate circuit, as a safeguard. We believe that the chick
could not control its body temperature efficiently during the critical first
weeks. The pillow was regularly covered with freshly cleaned, textured
cloth. Three sides of the nesting box were made out of plyboard and only
the front was glazed. It was annoying that the chick always squirted its
faeces against the glass window, apparently trying unsuccessfully to keep

its nest clean. Cleaning the nest had to be done carefully as the faeces were
very caustic to the skin of the bird keepers' hands but they never seemed
to irritate the chick's skin, which also got dirty sometimes.
As time passed and the young bird grew, we fed it less frequently and
the portions offered became bigger. The meals now also contained freshly
killed, skinned and cut up rabbits.
In the past our zoo has had quite good results hand-rearing vultures
such as the Condor Vultur gryphus and King Vulture Sarcoramphus papa.
The food for these chicks was always put first in an artificial gastric juice.
This contained pepsine and hydrochloric acid and was needed to predigest
the food, just as the parent birds do in their crop before feeding it to their
chicks (International Zoo Yearbook, No. 20: Dr. P. Zwart and J.W.W. Toll-
man). Although Bearded Vultures do not predigest their food for their
chicks, they do seem to give them some digestive juices together with the
food they feed. We therefore followed the advice of Dr. Ellen Thaler of
the Innsbruck Zoo in Austria. This is the only zoo in recent years to have
had some successful breedings and one hand-rearing of these vultures. Her
advice was simply to spit a little on the food before feeding it to the chick.
No water was additionally offered. At the age of five weeks the first dark
primaries showed through the grey down of the chick's wings.
We learned that Dr. Ellen Thaler had once been successful placing a
hand-reared Bearded Vulture of about one and a half months back into
the nest of its parents. These parents had been allowed to rear only one
chick because it is known that Bearded Vultures never succeed in rearing
both chicks in the wild. Attracted by the hungry begging cries of the
new chick, the parents also started to feed their second chick. Separating
such a chick from its human foster parents within a few weeks could help
to prevent harmful imprinting.
We therefore decided also to move our chick back to its parents.In
order to let the chick gradually get used to the cold temperatures outside,
we first placed it in an unheated room. Very bad weather conditions post-
poned the reunion until the end of April. It was then placed in an old
sheltered nest on the ground. For security measures the entrance to this
nest was screened by a wire netting. The mesh measured 15 cm which
allowed enough space for the parents to feed their chick. At first the
parents reacted with some excitement to the introduction of the chick,
but unfortunately showed no signs of wanting to feed it. This situation
did not improve when, a few days later, we removed the wire netting
from the front of the nest. To observe the birds, we used a telescope
in a hiding place located some distance from the aviary. This was nec-

essary because we noticed that they managed to recognise us imme-
diately and then mostly stopped their activity. Even when we walked
amongst a crowd of zoo visitors and were not carrying any equipment
or food with us, they could not be fooled. It was disappointing that
the parents never tried to feed their chick and for some reason they
did not seem to accept their new roles as parents. The chick never
made begging cries when its parents approached but as soon as it saw
its keeper or other people nearby, it would start to cry repeatedly for
food. In trying to solve this problem, we hit upon an unusual idea
which is perhaps worth mentioning. We hid a tape recorder in the nest
near the chick and it played, at intervals, the begging cries of a hungry
Bearded Vulture chick. Observations through the telescope showed that
the parents did get a little curious but it did not result in them feeding
their chick. Probably not only a begging call but also the begging beha-
viour of the chick is necessary to tempt the parents to start feeding it.
After spending more than three weeks with its parents, we were
suddenly forced to end this experiment. Early one morning, totally

unexpectedly, one of the parents viciously attacked the chick. Luckily
enough a keeper happened to be passing and was just in time to rescue
it before it was seriously injured. We cannot explain this behaviour; the
parents acted as if they were attacking an intruder. Maybe the period
between hatching and the reunion was too long for the breeding pair
to still behave as real parents.
After this incident the chick was placed in onother aviary. Although
it was sitting alone, it was able to see other vultures in neighbouring
aviaries.
At the age of three months its meals were reduced to only two a
day and consisted more and more of ordinary pieces of cattle and sheep
meat with Carnicon. Crushed watersnail-shells were once in a while given
as an additional calcium resource. The weight of the young vulture at
16 weeks was 5.650 kg and its wingspan was 210 cm. Its plumage at this
age had become dark brown with patches of white and light brown show-
ing here and there. Every night the young vulture slept on the highest
spot in the aviary which it could easily reach, having already managed
short flights. At 18 weeks it was fed only once a day. It could now tear
up small pieces of meat from carcasses, in the same manner as the adults.
After its dinner it often lay down with its legs pulled up. This behaviour
did not disturb us much because we had also noticed this sometimes in
our adult vultures.
At the time of writing (September 1980) the young Bearded Vulture
is just over half a year old, progressing well and becoming completely
independent. Because we had minimised human contact, it has now grad-
ually become less tame and it seems to exhibit no signs of imprinting on
humans anymore. We hope that this will mean that our young Bearded
Vulture will make a good subject after all for the World Wildlife re-intro-
duction project in the Alps.

The Great Grey Owl Strix nebulosa is undoubtedly one of the most
fascinating species of the holarctic owls. The subspecies S. n. nebulosa
J.R. Forster 1772 occurs in an area ranging between the 70th and 40th
degree of latitude of North America whilst the northern European and
Asiatic subspecies S.n. lapponica Thunberg 1798 is to be found between
the 70th and 50th degree of latitude. The existence of a third subspecies,
S. n. elisabethae Stegmann 1925, is documented only by a single stuffed
specimen originating from North Mongolia.
In 1911 the Berlin Zoo obtained for the first time several specimens of
the Eurasian subspecies which unfortunately died five years later in 1916.
It was not until 1964 that this species became available again and a single
female was purchased. In 1971 three more specimens were received from
the Helsinki Zoo which all proved to be females and one was sent to the
Copenhagen Zoo in 1972, another on breeding loan to Hannover Zoo in
1976. Fortunately we were finally able to obtain a male S.n. lapponica
in 1977 which came from the Copenhagen Zoo though it originated from
Helsinki. This male newcomer - imperceptibly smaller than the females -
was given a mate and they were installed in an outdoor aviary measuring
16 sq. m. x 3 m, with dense undergrowth. Twonestboxes,80x60 x 50 cm,
were put up 2 m above ground level and one side of each of these was left
open with a slat to prevent the eggs from falling out.
In spring 1979 the female started to make sounds which had not been
heard before - low, rhythmical cat's mewing which was presumed to be
an enticement call to the male. At the same time, the male started what
seemed to be courtship feeding, taking rats and mice to the female occa-
sionally.
On 15th April the female moved into a nest box to lay five eggs in nine
days which were removed for incubation and to encourage a second clutch.
Only a week later, the same call was heard again and on 5th May the female
moved back into a nest box. She laid six eggs which we left with her to
hatch but unfortunately the first chick to hatch out was accidentally killed
by the female and pushed from the box. Therefore we removed the remain-
ing eggs for incubation also. Shortly after the chicks hatched. Their birth-

weight averaged 48 g each. While one chick did not survive, the rest were
reared without problems. They were fed on chopped up mice and sparrows.
Their eyes opened at five days and their food call sounded somewhat like
that of young Tawny Owls. They developed extremely well and at 100
days they had reached an average weight of 947 g, resembling the adults
totally in size and plumage, though their food call still revealed them as
juveniles.
This is the first successful breeding of this species recorded in any Ger-
man zoo, and elsewhere only Copenhagen Zoo and Helsinki Zoo have
successfully bred the Great Grey Owl.
In 1980, we incubated two clutches of five eggs each, of which only
four chicks were hatched, the rest of the eggs being infertile. The first
clutch of six eggs in 1981 proved fertile and all the chicks were hatched
but their average birth weight of 35 g was markedly lower than that of the
chicks previously hatched. None of the chicks survived and post-mortem
examination revealed rachitic deficiencies as well as pseudomonic infec-
tions. The symptoms observed - respiratory distress as well as heavy secre-
tion of phlegm from the beak - strongly suggested an aspergillosis infesta-
tion. From a second clutch this year, three chicks were hatched out of
four eggs. They proved to be considerably stronger, weighing about 50 g
each, and so far they have developed very well and we expect all to sur-
vive.
The average size of the Great Grey Owl's eggs ranges between 4.68 x
3.92 cm and 5.30 x 4.22 cm; their weight averages between 48.2 g and
50.9 g, and their colour is a dull white.

Compared to its near relations, the common Tawny Owl Strix aluco
and the interesting Great Grey Owl S. nebulosa, the Ural Owl is a large bird
with a long tail. Its name is misleading because the Ural Mountains repres-
ent only a small part of this owl's breeding area; in fact, it ranges east to
Siberia and Japan, and as far south as the Carpathians. I prefer, therefore,
the German name "Habichtskauz", meaning "Goshawk Owl", because of
the long, broadly barred tail feathers and the vertically striped breast fea-
thers, which show a striking similarity to a young Goshawk. Its other
characteristics are almond-shaped eyes, abroad facial disc delicately marked
with lines, occiput heavily striped, a narrow beak and a wide range of calls.
In addition to the main range in northern Europe, small populations
of Ural Owls still exist in Slovakia, Yugoslavia (Slovenia), the Austrian
Alps and the Bohemian woods. In the most westerly areas, the owl only
occurs sporadically but breeding pairs have been reported in recent years
in Austria. In the woodlands of the Nationalpark Bayerischer Wald, the
last record of the Ural Owl was in 1926 and since then it is thought to
be extinct. Now the administration of this national park is trying to
re-establish this owl by introducing young birds which have been bred
in captivity.
When I first started to try to breed this species, I could find almost no
previous references. Behm (1909) published a breeding success; in 1930
Heinroth reared three young which also bred in the following years; in
Nuremberg Zoo a pair bred, unfortunately unobserved, in a reserve cage
in 1961 (Seitz, 1966); egg-laying was noted for two years at the Alpenzoo,
Innsbruck (Psenner, pers.) and Japan (Kazame, 1974).
When I obtained two Ural Owls from Sweden in 1970, I had already
successfully bred Pygmy Owl, Tengmalm's Owl, Little Owl and Snowy
Owl, and hoped to collect a lot of information about this species by
watching the owls during their daily activity peaks over several weeks.
Their aviary measured 4 m x 7 m and was furnished with large, hollow
trunks, rough branches and thick fir trees. When they arrived in Feb-
ruary, the owls started courtship after a few days of acclimatisation.
Although I could not get much information from the literature about

the meaning of their numerous calls, I very soon learned that I had two
males when they tried to copulate with each other. Luckily Professor
Psenner from the Alpenzoo, Innsbruck, co-operated by quickly exchang-
ing one of them for an adult female.
That April this newly mated pair laid two clutches of two and four
eggs, all of them fertile, but broken by the owls after a few weeks' incu-
bation. Artificial incubation was tried unsuccessfully.
The next year, the pair had to move and they were put in an aviary
4 m x 4 m in size and 1.7 m high. Here five healthy chicks hatched but
were killed by their parents. It was obvious that the cause of all these
losses was the female's high level of aggression - even when disturbed
during feeding or changing the water, she left the nesting hole, attacked
the keeper or her mate and jumped back on to the clutch vigorously.
On 2nd February 1972 the owls had to be moved again, this time into
an enclosure in the Nationalpark, which was covered in deep snow with
heavy frost. Based on experience, their new aviary was built as large
as possible (4m x 12 m), provided with plenty of hiding places and
different nesting holes. The branches were very large to make copulation
as easy as possible. That year the female produced two clutches of two and
three eggs, laid in a natural hollow, 60 cm deep.
In spite of all these efforts, the eggs were broken again so before the
1973 breeding season, I fixed a wooden stick across the nest hollow so
that when entering the hole the owl had to jump on it first. Although the
female sat constantly on the clutch, I put the eggs in the incubator for
hand-rearing and two young owls were reared - the first breeding success in
our Nationalpark after so many failures (Scherzinger, 1974). These cap-
tive-bred owls in turn bred more readily and so the results increasingly
improved with the following generations.
We realised that five breeding pairs at least would be needed for the
re-introduction programme and so, in order to avoid producing very inbred
birds, I looked for some unrelated blood. In 1973 I bought a pair from
Sweden and a pair from Rumania; in 1977 I was able to exchange two
young birds from our breeding stock with owls from the East Berlin Zoo.
However, since both the Rumanian owls showed distorted behaviour and
appeared unable to breed successfully, our whole breeding stock is based
on six specimens. These birds were kept in aviaries measuring 4 m x 8 m,
with one side sheltered, a wind-screeen at the back and a solid roof for
2 m. For breeding holes I offered hollow trees or nesting boxes with a
concave shaped bottom. Hiding places were offered by spruce trees. All
five aviaries were placed within a former Ural Owl habitat so the young

Ural Owl chick a few hours after hatching
owls could be released where they had been reared but it was necessary to
fence off photographers and tourists.
In the following years, successful natural rearing occurred regularly but
not in all the pairs. To avoid any risk of this precious breeding stock being
destroyed by disease or theft, some pairs of our offspring were placed
with experienced private breeders from 1978 onwards. Hence in 1981
the Nationalpark has five breeding pairs and seven others live in zoos or
other breeding collections.
Between 1973 and 1981, the caged owls in the Nationalpark produced
at least 100 eggs and 47 young, and 17 young were reared in other collec-
tions. The most successful year was 1977 when 12 young owls hatched
from 14 eggs. Losses of eggs through breaking (f.i. 1980) or of whole
from 14 eggs. Losses of eggs through breaking (f.i. 1980) or of whole
clutches through interruption in brooding (f.i. 1979) occurred often in

other seasons. Nevertheless, compared with the poor number of other
recorded successes (once each - Behrn 1909, Nuremberg Zoo 1961 and
Berlin Zoo 1977), I feel the results are very satisfactory.
Young Ural Owls start their courtship song as early as in the first
autumn, the pair bond is fixed during the winter and they become
sexually mature within their first year. Eggs are laid between 1st March
and the last week of April but replacement clutches are sometimes laid
as late as the middle of May. The average clutch is three eggs (maximum
six). The female only incubates and the young hatch after 35 days.
Their eyes are closed and they are covered with a very fine down. Ural
Owl nestlings are very robust and develop more quickly than the Tawny
Owl. Their eyes begin to open on the third day and on the fifth day the
feathers of the second plumage emerge, and the nestling is covered with
greyish-brown barred fluff when three weeks old.
At this stage the male Ural Owl carries food to the nest site and hands
it over to his mate at the entrance or in the hollow; he very rarely feeds
the young ones himself. At five weeks the young owls leave their nest
and jump on to the ground. Running and hopping they disappear into
dense vegetation and try to climb up the trees using their beak, claws
and wings. They are able to fly well by six weeks old. From the 75th day
the adult feathers appear, first on the belly and breast, then at the neck
and on the back, and finally on the head. The adults care for the young
for about ten weeks and the young owls stop their begging calls when
about 14 weeks old - in the wild they have to find their own food from
this time (Scherzinger, 1980).
As an experiment a male Ural Owl was put with a female Tawny Owl,
a smaller, related species. This female produced three hybrids in 1978
but attempts, over two seasons, to breed from these hybrids failed al-
though they showed very active courtship behaviour and even copula-
ted (Scherzinger, in press). On the other hand, a male hybrid was crossed
successfully with its Tawny Owl mother in 1981 and one young was reared.
In the early years, the young Ural Owls were retained to enlarge the
breeding stock but in 1975 for the first time young Ural Owls were re-
leased in the woods. I used the same technique as had been so successful
in re-introducing young Eagle Owls into the Nationalpark since 1972. A
young bird, at least three and a half months old, fully fledged and with
nearly fully developed plumage, is caught, ringed and put into a basket-
shaped pile of twigs beside the parents' aviary at nightfall. The young owl
stays in this hiding place for 10-20 minutes, recovering from the shock,
and then climbs out, looks around to get its bearings and usually goes over

to the parents' aviary. On no account must the keeper disturb the bird at
this point or it will fly away and starve. This releasing technique allows the
bird to be in contact with its parents or siblings in the aviary so it will stay
in the vicinity and we can offer it food. Ural Owls stand up to this test as
well as Eagle Owls but have a shorter begging period and disappear after a
few weeks.
From 1975 to 1980 a total of 30 Ural Owls were released but to date
we have not been able to follow their progress. Only one female settled in
the Nationalpark and her calls were recorded for three years. Most of the
young owls will probably have dispersed into lower-lying areas where the
winter is not so cold and there is not so much snow as in the mountains of
the Nationalpark. This question should be answered within the next few
years by radio transmitters, provided that we continue to breed the Ural
Owl as successfully as at present.

Rhinoptynx clamator
By R.G. KRAHE (Smithers, British Columbia, Canada)
For over a decade I have had a special interest in maintaining and breed-
ing owls from all over the world. Because of my successes and failures dur-
ing these years, this group of birds has become increasingly fascinating to
me.
Doubtless a pair of Striped Owls from Paraguay, that I obtained from a
friend in 1969, was the final incentive for this development. At the time
both birds were two and a half months old and still in their juvenile plu-
mage. According to the Striped Owls which I later bred, I could recon-
struct their age exactly from the development of their plumage. At the
beginning, of course, I did not know whether I had a true pair but a
difference in weight and size between them gave me some hope.
As has been said already, both birds came from Paraguay, almost the
furthest point of their South American and Central American distribution
which ranges from southern Mexico, including a part of the West Indies
(Tobago), to northern Argentina. Their habitat in these countries is decid-
uous seasonal forest, marshes, riverine forests and savannahs. They are resi-
dents of the lowlands and are absent from mountains. The genus Rhinop-
tynx , contains the single species clamator of which there are four races.
Description
They are the size of a Tawny Owl Strix aluco, approximately 3540 cm
long, but they appear more powerful on account of their much larger and
more powerful beaks and talons. Generally they look more like the smaller
species of the genus Bubo, the Spotted Eagle Owl Bubo africanus. The
females are somewhat larger and heavier than the males, the average weight
of my female Striped Owls being over a pound (570 g) and that of the
males under a pound (490 g).
The underparts are white to buff with sooty brown streaks. These
streaks become so concentrated on the breast that they almost form spots.
The throat is white. The whole upperparts, including head, wings and tail,
are brown to ochre. Wing and tail feathers are barred transversely with
bold sooty brown. The head and back have sooty brown vertical streaks
like the underparts. The legs and feet are fine buffy feathered.
The facial disc, bordered black, is reddish brown in young birds and
becomes more white as they get older but there is still a brown tinge around

the eyes. The eye is composed of two colours; the pupil is dark blue and
the iris dark orange. I should add that the colour difference between pupil
and iris can only be seen close up. From a distance the eyes appear to be
dark brown. In young Striped Owls, the colours of the iris and pupil are
noticeably lighter. The beak is dark grey and the lores are white.

Shortly after their arrival they were moved into an aviary 8 m long by
4 m wide and 2.5 m high. The back part of the aviary is completely enclo-
sed and only the planted front of the aviary is open. This planted part is con
structed so that the aviary gets sunshine and rain throughout the year.
There is a small pond in which the owls regularly bathe.
Although I know that the adaptability of many tropical species of
animals to our Central European climate is not difficult, I was still very
surprised to see the Striped Owls splashing in the pond when it had a
thin layer of ice on a frosty January morning in 1970. It seems that the
tropical climate of their natural home is not necessary and the cold
northern winter does not bother them at all provided - and from my
observations this is the most important factor - the food supply increases
in the same measure as the thermometer falls. During a heatwave in the
summer, they lose much of their appetite and equally in the coldest
part of the winter their normal daily ration is often doubled.
Whilst on the topic of daily rations, I should discuss diet, at which
point I find that many people decide that owls are not so lovable after all.
When giving a talk about my owls, I mention the 3,000 one-day old
chicks lying in our freezer or our mice and rat breeding, I find I am looking
at many horrified faces even though I point out that it is essential to offer
a natural food to these creatures.
My Striped Owls' diet is made up of 60% one-day old chicks, 30% mice
and 10% rats (the percentage is calculated from the number of pieces and
not the weight of the prey). The day-old chicks are frozen and left to
thaw for twelve hours before feeding. Mice and rats are fed freshly killed
and still warm or else given alive to the owls. The average daily consump-
tion is two chicks or four mice or half a rat. All the literature states that
Striped Owls feed on small mammals. Ffrench also mentions that grass-
hoppers are taken.
I trained my Striped Owls to hunt for live animals shortly after they
arrived and although the main part of their food is dead, they do occas-
ionally catch live mice and rats. The female Striped Owl was able to kill a
fully grown male rat which I never saw the male do.

Breeding pair of Striped Owls on the nest
Both Striped Owls became accustomed to their new life without
problems and by the time a year had passed, it was obvious that they were
doing very well. They had moulted from juvenile to adult plumage and
were very beautiful. They were sharing an aviary with a pair of Spectacled
Owls Pulsatrix perspicillata and there have never been any problems with
either species in eleven years, even when they were both rearing young.
I became very interested in the calls of the Striped Owls and es-
pecially the deep, short, ragged "barking" which was uttered by the male
six to seven times in succession. This "whoo-whoo-whoo-whoo-whoo-
whoo-whoo-whoo" increases from the first "whoo" to the last in tempo
and volume. The female answers or joins in with the same series of calls,
though the pitch is higher and her barking sounds like "whoi-whoi-whoi-
whoi-whoi-whoi-whoi".
The function of these calls, I am sure, is to establish position and con-
tact. The "barkings" are uttered only when sitting and at any time
of day or night, when either resting or active. In particular, during the
mating season, which is not connected to any distinct time of the year,
the male utters a hollow soft "whoo", lasting almost two seconds. The

<bodyText confidence="0.991651" page_id="56284339"  page_num="245" year="" vol="">
female answers with a soft screarning.The female's reply to these "whoo"
calls, which go on for hours, is often heard only before breeding. "Bar-
king" in unison is heard much more often. The male's call means terri-
tory demarcation and mating readiness whereas the female's screaming
means only mating readiness.
When several Striped Owls were kept in the same aviary, there was a
recognisable though not very rigid order of precedence. Ilf an owl of a
lower rank perched beside an owl in a higher position, the latter threatened
the first owl which then made a series of rapid whining "ee-ee-ee-ee-ee"
cries. This appeased the superior owl which generally allowed the lower-
ranking owl to perch. But sometimes it led to a fierce attack. The fear-cry
of Striped Owls is a loud, shrill screaming. When surprised and threat-
ened, they utter a loud, strong "Wou" which again can be compared to a
dog's bark.
Breeding
Striped Owls are sexually mature in their first year and so my pair
started to breed in December 1970. On 14th December, the clutch with
four eggs was complete and the female sat fast. This was the first of a total
of 27 breedings up to 1979.
The nest is a scratched hollow in the ground which is made by the fe-
male. Holes near the ground will also be used. The nesting site is chosen
by the male and marked by scratching.
The eggs are laid at an average interval of two and one-third days (56
hours). The shortest interval between two eggs has been a little more than
one and three-quarter days (44 hours). The longest interval between egg-
laying has been three and a half days (86 hours).
Striped Owls' eggs are dull white and I found that the average egg size,
based on the measurements of 83 eggs, was 44.65 x 36.45 mm. The greatest
variation is between 40.5 - 49.2 mm in length and 32.95 - 38.3 mm in
width. The egg weighs between 28 and 33.5 g.
The average clutch is three eggs but there have been clutches of only
one egg or as many as five eggs. The 27 clutches consisted of two clutches
of one egg, two clutches of two eggs, sixteen of three eggs, six of four eggs
and one of five eggs.
During nesting, the male supplies the female and later the young with
food. After the prey is caught and no longer moving, the male takes it
in his beak and sits down close to the nest. Calling constantly and retain-
ing the prey in his beak, he tries to get the female away from the nest to
deliver up the mouse or rat. Another variation is when he marches right

up to the nest and gives the prey to the female. The word "march" is
chosen deliberately because neither of them ever land straight on the nest.
The landing ground is some way from the nest and the remaining distance
must be covered on foot. Striped Owls do not hop but stalk like cranes,
starlings or storks only it does not look so elegant; it it best compared to
a duck's waddle.
When the male gives the prey to the female, she reacts in one of three
ways:
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.8422106" page_id="56284340"  page_num="246" year="" vol="">
(i) She leaves the eggs and eats the prey away from the nest. During
this time, a maximum of five minutes, the male stays and guards the nest.
(ii) If the prey is not too large, she takes it and swallows it without
getting up from the eggs.
(iii) She takes the prey, lays it amongst the eggs and continued incuba-

ting.
I have never seen the male incubating but he is regularly close to the fe-
male on the edge of the nest. The pair are very devoted. Once when I
was catching the owls up for measuring and weight control, the female
watched with great interest until the moment I caught the male in a net.
Immediately she started to attack me and my daughter who was helping
me. The same attacks have been made by both of them when someone
comes too close to the nest or to the dependent young. First they snap
their beaks, "spit" like cats, form a semi-circle with their outspread wings
and then they step from one foot to the other in their excitement.
This threatening attitude is not actually dangerous, although it appears
to be. If one keeps ones eyes on them whilst walking slowly backwards,
all is well. This threat is an attitude which we know many animals are
capable of showing. In instances when I have ignored the threat and come
closer still to the nest with eggs or to the young, the owl has stopped
snapping and spitting, has put its wings together, paused and stooped its
body and then seconds later started to attack. With its large talons
stretched forward, it continually attacks my head only. If unable to
duck, I have had a painful strike on my head with blood flowing from
where the claws caught.
The following incubation periods are based on all the breedings in my
aviaries. The first-laid egg needs a term of 33-34 days, the remaining eggs
need only 31-32 days. As with so many other birds, I have found that
the actual incubation period is preceded by a short time when the eggs
are kept warm. After the Striped Owl has laid her first egg, she sits high
on the nest but after the second egg is laid, she presses herself right down
on the nest to give full warmth to the eggs which explains why two of the

young always hatch at the same time although one egg has been laid two
and a third days before the other. The remaining young hatch at the same
intervals as the eggs have been laid. The incubation of the whole clutch is,
therefore as follows: first egg - 34 days, second egg 31.5 days, third egg -
31.5 days and the fourth egg - 31.5 days. The incubation period of the
Striped Owl is, therefore, 31-32 days. Of the first clutch, two chicks
hatched on 10th January, 1971, the third on 12th January and the fourth
on 14th January. Newly-hatched Striped Owls are covered with thick,
grey-white down; they weigh 18- 22 g and are 8-9 cm long.
To my disappointment, only one young owl was reared from the first
clutch and, in fact, this was the case with most of the broods in the follow-
ing years. After the young hatched, all except one disappeared during
the first five days. For the first time, at the end of 1974, and in subse-
quent years, two young owls have been reared and in 1978 the whole
clutch survived, three young being reared from three eggs with no problems.
Whilst I cannot describe all the breedings in my aviaries, I would just
like to briefly describe one failure. For this brood the female had chosen
to nest in the uncovered part of the aviary and the nest hollow had been
scratched by the female in the existing soil. She had already laid two eggs
when there were heavy rainfalls during the night. In the morning the nest-
hollow was full of water and the female sat drenched to the skin on the
eggs. I built her a new nest a little higher but right beside the nest standing
under water, took the two eggs and put them in the new nest. The female
understood the situation straight away and laid the third egg in this nest
that afternoon and continued brooding. However, it rained a lot that
month and often the female became very wet. Although during incubation
the nest hollow was no longer full of water, the circumstances had been
very disadvantageous and the embryos died in different stages of devel-
opment. Since that time, the female has never nested in the uncovered
part of the aviary. As already described, the newly-hatched Striped Owls
have grey-white down which is replaced after a few days by new, long
buff down. This buff down is in turn replaced by the normal adult plu-
mage after two and a half months.
The owlets leave their nest in the third week by foot as they are as yet
unable to fly. Their parents watch them very carefully and are very ag-
gressive at this time. When the young start attempting to fly, the parents
give them whole prey rather than prey already broken up into pieces.
The wing and tail feathers develop right from the first day and grow
so quickly that after a month the owlets are able to fly for short distances
of about 1 m to 1.20 m. These wing and tail feathers are moulted in the

At four weeks the weight of the owlets is 25 times greater than their
weight at birth. After that they lose weight because of their increasing
activity and will reach their normal weight when three months old but
a further weight gain is possible.
The contact call of the owlets after leaving the nest is a long, high
"sspee'.
Striped Owls are seldom seen in zoological gardens or private aviaries.
All the Striped Owls currently in zoos in West Germany and West Berlin
are young from my breeding pair but unfortunately none have bred to
date.

SOME NOTES ON CAPTIVE OWLS

By BERNARD SAYERS (Chelmsford, Essex)
Over the years I have frequently been asked if a good text book existed
which provided comprehensive information about the captive maintenance
and breeding of owls (Strigiformes). To my knowledge, no such book exists
although a number of papers on the subject have appeared in scattered
journals. When the editor of this Magazine invited contributions for the
special issue devoted to birds of prey, my mind turned to providing a few
notes based on my experience of keeping and breeding owls over the past
17 years. It was only after I had thought carefully about these notes that
I realised how little of value there was to record. This can be explained by
two factors:-
Owls are some of the least demanding of all birds to keep and breed in
captivity and seem to respond well to a regimen based on sound com-
mon sense, and,
Secondly, since much of their activity is nocturnal, it can be very diffi-
cult for a keeper to closely observe the complete behaviour of his charges.

Quite simply, it is my belief that if three basic requirements can be
satisfied, birds in captivity, if physically and psychologically sound, must
breed. These requirements may be summarised as follows
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.655595" page_id="56284343"  page_num="249" year="" vol="">
1. True , compatible pair
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.995886" page_id="56284343"  page_num="249" year="" vol="">
Many species of birds are difficult or virtually impossible to sex visually
and this, in the past, must have resulted in many species gaining unjust
reputations for being difficult to breed simply because many of the at-
tempts involved examples of the same sex. Fortunately science has now
come to the rescue in that birds can be sexed surgically (laparoscopy)
sexed by means of a hormone analysis utilising either a faecal sample or
feather pulp. In many respects, the former technique would seem to be the
more successful with almost 100% accuracy and very low risk. In general,
most species of owls can be sexed visually with reasonable reliability and,
if physical characteristics are considered in conjunction with behaviour,
few mistakes should result. However, I have found some species, such as
the Little Owl Athena noctua extremely difficult to sex reliably and with
these species, surgical sexing would undoubtedly save a great deal of was-
ted time.
Similarly, incompatibility does not frequently prove to be a problem
with owls unless they have been tamed and become imprinted to some ex-
tent. Usually two birds of the same sex, even when adult, will agree per-
fectly amicably and in several cases I have known, when two females
have been housed together, they have laid and incubated clutches of in-
fertile eggs in the same scrape.
Even more surprising perhaps is that some species will live and even
breed on the colony system if the aviary is sufficiently spacious. Also I
know of several instances involving a number of species in which unmated
birds have occupied the same aviary as a breeding pair, yet even when the
latter were rearing chicks they made no attempt to injure their aviary com-
panion. However, having made these observations, they should be promptly
qualified by the caution that, in general, colony breeding is not advisable
and true pairs should always be segregated from unmated birds.
As mentioned previously, owls which have been hand-reared and isola-
ted as pets frequently become anti-social misfits and when attempts are
made to pair them for breeding, it is not uncommon for them to attack
or even kill their potential mate. As with any form of livestock, sweeping
generalisations are never wholely correct and to illustrate this point, one
male Great Eagle Owl B.b.bubo, which had been used by an illusionist and
was a very tame imprint, ultimately settled down perfectly successfully

to domestic duties even though he continued to court his keeper with
great vigour.
It is probably true to say that the more intelligent a group of birds are,
the more likely it is that there will be problems involving incompatibility.
Thus the very intelligent birds such as parrots and crows can be very selec-
tive in accepting a mate. Although I have kept owls for some years and
continue to find them of immense interest, I cannot, with any conscience,
claim that they would score well in the intelligence status and possibly,
for this reason, few true pairs prove to be incompatible. Save, that is, for
the imprints.

2. Diet
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999509178571429" page_id="56284344"  page_num="250" year="" vol="">
To my mind, a nutritious, varied diet is essential if any form of livestock
is to be bred to maximum effect. Many attempts to breed from sound
pairs of birds undoubtedly fail because too little attention is given to diet.
Quite obviously, the ultimate would be to supply exactly the same diet
that the birds would consume in the wild, but this is rarely, if ever, poss-
ible. Consequently, for many birds, complicated formulae need to be em-
pirically involved in order to simulate the natural diet and so promote satis-
factory results. Fortunately it is quite simple to simulate almost exactly
the natural diet of raptors. All owls are predatory birds and naturally prey
on insects, mammals, birds, reptiles and fish. Few are strictly specialised
in their feeding habits, although some do show a preference for certain
prey species. In many instances this is probably determined more by avail-
ability and ease of capture than by gastronomic selection. In the wild owls
have rarely been witnessed scavenging from large carcasses unless forced to
do so by extreme conditions. Therefore, to summarise, owls prey on spe-
cies which are small enough to be killed easily and then eaten in their en-
tirety. This food pattern can be closely simulated in captivity with little
difficulty if whole carcasses can be supplied which are small enough to be
eaten whole by the owls then the natural diet will have been matched al-
most exactly.
If owls are graded, according to size, into three categories,my birds are
fed as follows:-
Small owls (Scops, Little, Malayan Spotted, etc.)
Mice and day-old poultry chicks. On many occasions I have attempted
to vary the diet offered to these species by offering insects in the form of
live locusts, mealworms, beetles, etc., but with no success. The birds have
never accepted insect food unless they have been very hungry. Instead,
they have shown a consistent preference for mice or poultry chicks and

this has even applied to very small species such as Common Scops Owl
Otus scops. It would seem that self-denial of such insect food has little ad-
verse effect because one of my Collard Scops Owls Otus bakkamoena has
now been in captivity for over twenty years and my small owls seem to
breed successfully on a diet of mice and chicks.
-- Medium sized owls (Barn, Tawny, Woodford's, Boobook, etc.)
Mice, chicks and young rats up to approximately 4 oz in weight. Some
collections provide these birds with jointed rabbit and sections of large
rats. This diet, while quite adequate, is to my view much less satisfactory
than small items which can be fed in their entirety. By providing small ro-
dents and chicks, the owls can consume the whole body and so ensure a
balanced intake.
- Large owls (eagle owls of all species and Snowy)
Chicks, rats up to 12 oz in weight and small rabbits. I have seen domestic
pigeons and fully grown poultry fed to the larger owls. Admittedly no
hard evidence to suggest that this practice has been responsible for prob-
lems can be offered, but I have always avoided these items on the basis
that domestic poultry and pigeons frequently carry a wide variety of avian
diseases; although their inherent resistance keeps it suppressed and the
symptoms are not noticeable. Some species of owls, particularly those
symptoms
from the Arctic, are very susceptible to avian diseases encountered in poul-
try and I have reasoned that the possibility of disease being promoted by
infected food is too great to be acceptable.
Finally, as a few general observations on diet; I only use captive-reared
chicks and rodents. Apart from the problem of obtaining wild-caught
mammals and birds in sufficient quantity (I use approximately 4 tons of
chicks and rodents each year) the risk of introducing disease or toxic sub-
stances is too great. In these days of widespread use of insecticides, herbi-
cides, rodenticides, etc., any wild-taken bird or animal must be suspected
of being contaminated and although the level of contamination may have
been sub-lethal to the individual concerned, when fed to an owl these
traces of toxic substances frequently prove to be cumulative until they
reach a lethal level. Also victims of a shotgun must always be totally avoi-
ded. There is always the possibility that odd lead pellets will remain in the
carcass and these, if eaten, are broken down by the gastric fluids and ab-
sorbed into the blood stream. According to experiments with waterfowl,
one lead pellet is quite frequently sufficient to cause the death of ducks
the size of Mallard.
All of the food fed to my owls is as sterile as can be assured. Domestic

poultry chicks are hatched under carefully regulated conditions and simi-
larly the rodents used are the excess production from research units where
careful controls are imposed.
Ideally, freshly killed items should be offered to raptors, but due to
logistical problems, this is rarely possible. The most convenient method is
to acquire food in bulk and store it in deep freeze until it is required. All
carcasses are best frozen whole and not eviscerated; subsequently the com-
plete, thawed body can be fed to the raptors.
All chicks and rodents which are destined for owl food must obviously
be destroyed in a manner which does not contaminate the carcass. Ob-
viously physical methods such as breaking the neck are satisfactory in that
contamination is not involved, but these methods may not be as humane
as gassing. Victims may be gassed with Carbon Dioxide (CO 2 ) without any
risk of harmful contamination, but many other substances such as carbon
tetrachloride and chloroform must be strictly avoided. I know of instances
where numbers of raptors died after being fed with rodents and chicks
destroyed with the latter preparations, which seem to leave harmful resi-
dues in the body tissues of the victims.
In general, no supplements or vitamin additives are offered to my owls
or, for that matter, thought to be necessary. The only exception is the
addition of a dusting of sterilised bonemeal to the food offered to the
Snowy Owls Nyctea scandiaca when they are feeding chicks. The chicks of
this species grow very quickly and initially some of the youngsters had
slightly dropped wings until the diet was changed to one composed en-
tirely of rodents dusted with sterilised bonemeal. Subsequently there has
been no recurrence of this problem.
Some breeders of raptors do use various supplements, but I tend to
think that these preparations should be used with caution. If the diet is
perfectly adequate then I see no reason for adding supplements. Indeed,
the gratuitous use of random quantities of vitamin additives may be harm-
ful rather than beneficial. If supplements are to be used, they should be
specifically aimed towards counteracting a particular deficiency in the diet
and then in carefully controlled quantities.
Owls are generally hardy birds that seem well able to cope with the
British climate provided that they are well housed and fed. Admittedly in
some very cold localities, some of the small species from the tropics may
need some artificial heat but so far I have never found this to be necessary
in south-east England. I have learned of instances where birds of prey in
this area died during very cold weather and their deaths were attributed
to the low temperatures. However, I tend to think that these birds died of

starvation because their food had been thrown in once a day and much
of it had become re-frozen before it could be eaten. During very severe
weather I warm the food slightly and feed small quantities on two or three
occasions during the evening. In this way, it ensures that all food can be
eaten before becoming re-frozen. It will be noticed that food intake will
increase markedly during severe weather, but I have never seen an owl
which has been permitted to feed adequately showing signs of distress
from low temperatures.

Birds maintained in captivity, if kept clean and fed on uncontamina-
ted food seem to contract infections from two sources in particular;
stale aviary floors and from the droppings of wild birds. In fact, con-
trary to popular belief, wild birds seem to show little fear of captive rap-
tors and frequently perch on the roof of their aviaries. To combat these
two sources of possible infection, my aviary frameworks are supported on
9 inch high stone walls. The aviary floor is then built up with inch pea-
shingle until almost level with the top of this wall. The top 2 inches of
this shingle infill is then replaced regularly. In this way a reasonably sterile
and sharply drained floor can be maintained. If it is thought that weeds
may grow through the shingle and prove a problem, as a precautionary
measure, perforated plastic fertiliser (of non-toxic composition) bags can
be spread over the aviary floor before the 8 inch layer of shingle is applied.
To reduce the possibility of infection from wild birds, all of my aviaries
have completely covered roofs. The house/nesting area is covered with a
boarded and felted roof and the outer section is roofed with transparent
corrugated polyvinylchloride sheeting. This roof cladding may pose prob-
lems in the summer in that the aviary could become very hot. This prob-
lem has been averted by the shade given by overhanging, deciduous trees
and climbing plants. By this means, shade is provided in the summer but
in the winter, when maximum light is essential, the trees carry no leaves
and cast little shade and climbing plants can be cut back. Not only does
a covered roof reduce the risk of infection from wild birds, but it also
ensures that ground-nesting owls will not have their nest scrapes flooded
or covered with snow at a critical time.
It is most important for birds to gain a feeling of security within their
aviary if they are to breed successfully. The amount of seclusion necess-
ary does, of course, depend very much on the phlegmatic or neurotic tem-
perament of the bird in question. Very tame examples will often settle
to breed in very open structures and will tolerate a high level of disturbance

and close proximity of spectators. At the other extreme, very nervous birds
will sometimes only satisfactorily settle to breed in a totally enclosed aviary
which eliminates all forms of visual disturbance. Mostly, owls fit into a
niche midway between these extremes. Certainly the aviaries employed
by some collections open to the pub He are, to my view, far too open and,
even worse, are situated so that they can be completely encircled by the
public. Under these conditions it is only the tame birds which are likely to
breed. These remarks do, of course, apply mainly to quite small structures
because if the aviary is planted and spacious and/or is very lofty, the birds
will derive a sense of security by retiring to the cover of trees and bushes
or to the higher points of the aviary where they will be well above the
spectators. By virtue of the fact that my aviaries have to be contained
within a modest sized garden, necessity has precluded them from being
very large. I have, therefore, designed them to afford the owls maximum
privacy whilst still permitting easy observation. One end of the aviary
takes the form of an open-fronted shelter and the back and the end of the
aviary are screened with V* inch obscured, wired glass. Only the fronts are
wired and for this 1 inch by 1 inch by 12 swg plastic coated weldmesh has
been found to be most suitable. Conventional wire netting is less satis-
factory because during the breeding season many owls tend to fly at the
wire with considerable impact in a show of aggression. Wire netting seems
to be far more likely to cause injury to the birds on such occasions and it
is not unusual for them to lacerate their feet and cere when colliding with
a barrier of this material. Similarly chain link has been found not to be en-
tirely satisfactory. The mesh size is usually large enough to admit sparrows,
rats and other vermin and this shortcoming would, of course, largely nullify
the other precautions taken to isolate the owls from possible sources of
diseased or toxic material. Also, I have known of a few isolated instances
where birds have trapped a toe between the woven links of a taut panel of
chain link. Extraordinarily, some years ago I lost a Javan Fish Owl Ketupa
ketupu which occupied an aviary with a front of VA inch x 1 inch weld-
mesh. The bird had inserted its hooked beak through the VA inch dimen-
sion and twisted the head at right angles so becoming locked in position.
The bird was found dead probably through shock because no injury was
apparent.
The floors of the open-fronted shelters of my aviaries are carpeted
with a 9 inch layer of compacted peat moss. Most of the large owls and
many of the smaller species seem to be content to scratch out a nest scrape
in this peat moss although some prefer an elevated nest box. The nest
scrape is protected by a large sheet of plywood leaning against the back

wall of the shelter. Nesting on the floor has some advantages in that many
owls nest during very cold weather and an elevated nestbox surrounded by
cold air is probably a harsher environment than a deep hollow scratched in
a floor covering of peat. Also, since young owls tend to be rather preco-
cious it is easy for them to wander around the aviary and then return to
the warmth of a brooding female in a ground nest, but if a very young bird
scrambles out of an elevated nest, it may have difficulty in returning. Also,
when I have birds which prefer to nest in raised boxes, the aviary floor
below the box is kept covered with a deep layer of loose peat when young-
sters are present. This ensures that there is little chance of injury if a
young bird tumbles out of the nestbox before it can fly properly. In these
instances, the peat cushions the impact of crash-landings. At the end of the
breeding season all of the peat nest litter is stripped out and the retaining
walls around ground sites, together with nestboxes, are scrubbed and dis-
infected. They are then treated with a pyrethrum dust insecticide before
clean peat is replaced. Much of the peat which is packed in plastic sacks is
very wet initially. However, if the new peat is installed directly at the end
of the breeding season, it will have dried suitably by the time the follow-
ing season commences.
It may sound elementary, but many collections seem to give little
thought to the siting of perches. I favour restricting the number of perches
to two, which should be natural branches with bark attached. To exercise
the feet, these should be of different diameters and situated as far apart as
possible. It is also preferable to site them at different levels because this
ensures that the birds are always flying up or down which provides greater
exercise. Oddly enough, one still sees many aviaries at zoos and in private
collections which only have one large, centrally placed branch. This either
markedly reduces the inmates&amp;quot; level of activity or, alternatively, the birds
fly between the branch and the wire sides of the enclosure so damaging
their plumage. Also, it is not uncommon to see an aviary, say, 20 feet
long with the perches situated 6 feet from the ends and therefore reducing
the effective length significantly. Most owls appreciate an upturned log in
the centre of the aviary to be used as a feed block.
Finally, on die subject of aviary furnishings, most owls are avid bathers
and should, at all times, have access to a large container of clean water.
I have found plastic cat-litter trays very suitable for the small species, plas-
tic washing bowls for the medium sized birds and either galvanised cattle
drinkers or the large aluminium tray, used for bulk meat transport, for the
large species.

Introduction
Nutrition is a fundamentally important aspect of the management of
captive raptors, and yet, in view of the profound influence that incorrect
feeding can have on health and breeding success, surprisingly little has
been written on the subject.
Nutritional diseases due to feeding imbalanced diets are still frequently
seen in raptors, particularly in young birds, and deaths due simply to
starvation are not uncommon among inexperienced falconers' birds
(Cooper, 1978). The aim of this paper is to recommend whole-animal
diets; the laboratory mouse and, with some reservations, the day-old chick,
as well-balanced diets for captive birds of prey; and to show how require-
ments for these diets can be calculated quantitatively.
The balance of nutrients in the diet
In devising a diet for birds of prey, it is not sufficient to describe its
requirements in terms of weight or volume (eg. one cropful) of food per
day, since the nutrient content of foods vary greatly. For example, weight
for weight, insects contain about twice as much energy as lean beef (See
Table 1). It is important to consider the concentrations of specific nutri-
ents.
Meat diets, containing no bone, skin or visceral organs, are very unsuit-
able for birds of prey, and lead to bone disease due to inadequate calcium
content or poor calcium to phosphorus ration (Cooper, 1975) and to
vitamin deficiencies (particularly A and E, Graham &amp; Halliwell, 1978).
Whole adult animal diets such as laboratory mice are much better
quality foods, containing approximately twice the concentrations of
metabolisable energy, crude protein, calcium and phosphorus per unit
of dry matter, than those recommended for growing poultry (Table 2).
The balance of the nutrients is thus very similar to that suitable for poul
try. This is of considerable practical importance since, assuming that a
raptor's requirements are not dissimilar to those of a growing fowl, once
it has eaten enough of a diet of whole animal to satisfy its energy demand,
it will have ingested sufficient protein, calcium and phosphorus in the pro-
cess. (See Table 2)

Day-old chicks are a rich source of vitamins A and D3, but their cal-
cium and phosphorus content is low. They should not therefore be fed
unsupplemented to growing raptors which have a very high demand for
these minerals.
The kestrel colony at Bristol University (Kirkwood, 1980a) is fed on
laboratory mice and day-old chicks, and the only dietary supplement given
is calcium lactate which is given orally at a rate of 100 mg/day to growing
eyasses between the ages of five and 20 days. No evidence has emerged
from observations on this colony, for a need to add vitamin or mineral
supplements to a diet of mice and day-old chicks for breeding birds. Even
eggs from clutches considerably extended by 'egg-pulling 5 techniques
(Kirkwood, 1980a) and from second clutches, which would be expected to
suffer most from dietary inadequacies, appeared normal, had good hatch
rates and gave rise to healthy young (Fig. 1).
During moult there is a particular requirement for sulphur-containing
amino acids for feather growth (Newton, 1972) and the scarcity of these
in vegetable diets may necessitate a degree of over-eating among some
birds in order to obtain for normal moult (Dolnik &amp; Gavrilov, 1979).
However, in meat diets these amino acids are not scarce and it is very
unlikely that whole-animal diets are deficient in them. The Bristol kes-
trels moult normally on unsupplemented diets.

It can be argued that energy is the most important nutrient for two
reasons. Firstly, because it is energy which first runs out during starvation
or under-nutrition, and secondly, because, as shown above, once a raptor
has eaten enough of a whole adult animal diet to satisfy its energy dem-
ands, it will generally have ingested sufficient other nutrients in the pro-
cess.
The energy available to a raptor from its diet (the metabolisable energy,
ME) depends upon the nature of the diet and on the efficiency with which
this energy can be extracted during its digestion (Kirkwood, 1979). The
ME values of laboratory mouse and day-old chick are about 1.5 and 1.0
Kcal/g. freshweight respectively. ME values are generally about 75% of the
gross energy values of raptor foods (Kirkwood, 1981) and a list of gross
energy values is given in Table 1.
The ME requirements for captive birds of prey for maintenance in good
health without loss or gain in weight, can be predicted from bodyweight
using Kirkwood&amp;apos;s ( 1981) equation:

(1) MEm = 110 vfi&amp;apos; . (W = weight in Kg, MEm = maintenance ME
requirements in Kcal) and little precision is lost in simplifying this ex-
pression to:
(2) MEm = (90 x W) + 20 for birds of less than 1.5 kg.
From this a useful First estimate of a raptor's daily maintenance require-
ment for mouse or chick can be calculated:
(3) F = MEm - D (F = food requirement in g/day, D = ME value of diet
in Kcal/g).

A worked example, showing how the food requirements of a bird of
known weight may be estimated, is shown in Fig. 2.
It is important to weigh captive birds regularly to check that weight
is remaining within the normal range (consult Brown &amp; Amadon, 1968,
for the normal weight ranges in diurnal raptors) and this should be done
prior to feeding when the weight of the gut contents is minimal.
The requirements for breeding and growing birds are higher than those
of adults for maintenance. Breeding birds should be fed ad libitum for
several months before the start of laying and during the incubation and
rearing period, as should growing birds from hatching until their feathers
are 'hard-penned' (mature), which may not be for several weeks after
fledging. The growth and consumption of a diet of mice of a typical
kestrel is shown in Fig. 3 Food consumption during growth considerably
exceeds that required by adults for maintenance (See Figure 3).
Rations should also be increased during moult and in cold weather.
The energy requirements for moult are not known, but it seems wise to
advise an increase in intake of at least 20% above maintenance level during
moult. A re-examination of the data of Craighead and Craighead (1956),
expressing food consumption in terms of g. food/g. bodyweight 0.75/day
(a scale that eliminates the difference between species due to size), shows
that food intake generally increases as ambient temperature falls (Fig. 4).
There is insufficient information available at present on which to base any
hard and fast rules about the effects of cold, but Fig. 4 provides evidence
that rations should be increased (by perhaps 20-30%) during chilling
weather (0*C).
Conclusion
There is evidence both from the chemical analysis of whole adult
animal diets (in particular the laboratory mouse), and from experiences
with their use in the maintenance of a breeding colony of kestrels, that
provision of sufficient of these diets to meet the energy requirements
will automatically ensure the adequate intake of other essential nutr-

by correct aviary design, enabling sunning behaviour (important for the
synthesis of vitamin D3), and floored with natural turf from which 'rangle'

The poor hatch rates of the early eggs probably reflects sub-optimal
artificial incubation. The high success rate of the later eggs is good evi-
dence that the diet of laboratory mice fed ad libitum and supplemented
occasionally by day-old chicks (with no added vitamins or minerals),
is quite adequate for captive breeding.

RAPTOR REHABILITATION AT WOODLAND PARK
ZOOLOGICAL GARDENS

By JAMES W. FOSTER, D.V.M. (Director of Science) and
WALTER G. ENGLISH (Curator of Birds)
In the autumn of 1971 a raptor programme was initiated at Woodland
Park Zoological Gardens in Seattle, Washington, titled "Project Babe"
after an imprinted Golden Eagle.
The primary goal of the programme at that time was to gain infor-
mation regarding the breeding of birds of prey in captivity, and, if success-
ful, to help re-establish the wild population by releasing surplus birds back
into their natural habitat. It was then felt that the programme would not
only provide a worthwhile research project for the Zoo's staff and volun-
teers, but would also aid in fulfilling part of the Zoo's conservation re-
sponsibilities. The first breeding season was very successful in that two
Prairie Falcons and two Harris's Hawks were hatched and fledged. A
great deal of data on the reproductive behaviour of these birds was also
collected.
It soon became apparent that a second part needed to be added to the
programme. Since the Zoo was the logical place for treatment and rehabili-
tation of sick and injured birds, a surplus of Bald and Golden Eagles had
accumulated on the Zoo grounds. Some of these birds were permanently
crippled, so efforts were made to enter them into educational or breeding
projects while others proved to be releasable. The releasable birds were a
problem in the respect that Zoo personnel did not have the time to spend
to monitor the birds following release, and the more desirable sites were
somewhat distant from the Zoo grounds.
As a result of this need it was decided that a raptor rehabilitation
programme would be implemented with our interest directed especially
toward Bald Eagles (Foster, 1972). The state of Washington has the
greatest population of Bald Eagles in the lower 48 states and the Golden
Eagle population is also substantial in number. Volunteers were recruited
to monitor the birds following release and sites were selected for the
reintroduction.

Puget Sound. There are 100 to 180 wintering Bald Eagles in the Skagit
area which is not protected as an eagle sanctuary by the Washington
State Game Department and the Natural Conservancy. Bald Eagles are
attracted to this area by the large numbers of salmon that spawn and then
die in the river each year (Servheen, 1975). The rehabilitated eagles are
usually released in December and January when salmon carcasses are most
abundant. On San Juan Island there are approximately 50 to 100 Bald
and Golden Eagles in residence each winter (R.L. Knight pers. comm.
1977). That portion where the eagles are released is a National Park,
American Camp. Besides the large surrounding bodies of water which con-
tain many food items which are utilized by the eagles, they are also attrac-
ted to the area because of the exceptionally large number of European
Rabbit, with 25 to 120 to be found per hectare (Stevens 1975). The re-
habilitation eagles are released at both sites during winter in order to
avoid territorial conflicts with resident nesting populations of Bald and
Golden Eagles.

Depending on which release site is going to be used for a given year,
the eagles are fed whole salmon or rabbit carcases for at least one month
prior to release in order to condition them to the most abundant food
source they will have, once in the wild. At Woodland Park, all eagles
to be released are held in a rehabilitation or off exhibit enclosures, in
groups of up to three. Every effort is made to keep the release eagles as
wild as possible (Servheen and English, 1976, English and Servheen, 1977).
Handling is minimized to prevent feather damage or trauma, so no effort
is made to tame the eagles. The rehabilitation enclosure which is on
exhibit is partly shielded from public view by the use of plants and shrubs
so that contact with humans is reduced.
Just prior to release, coloured leg streamers, radio transmitters, and
Fish and Wildlife riveted aluminium bands are placed on each bird. Radio
transmitters are mounted as tail-feather mounts by securing them with
nylon surgical sutures to the top tail feathers (Servheen, 1976). When
sufficient salmon carcasses are available in the Skagit release area as
verified by field checks, the birds are hooded and wrapped to prevent
injury and are transported to the release site. Again, as for all the eagles,
human handling and disturbance is kept to a minimum. The actual release
is done away from open water so that there is a reduced possibility that
the eagles will attempt their initial flight over water. All released eagles
are monitored closely for several weeks to observe their adaptation back
to the wild and their movements in the area. Food availability is also
monitored during this initial period, and if it becomes low, salmon or
rabbit carcasses are distributed to the birds. Notices are sent throughout
western Washington describing the project and encouraging the public
to become involved in the work by reporting sightings of released eagles
(Servheen and English, 1976, English and Servheen, 1977).

The success of this rehabilitation programme very greatly depends on
the availability of an abundant, easily obtainable food source in the
release areas and a minimum of human disturbance when the eagles are
regaining their powers of flight. This allows the eagles to develop muscle
strength on their own with no need to train and fly them just prior to
release. The birds will remain wild and wary of man, and there is no danger
of injury or feather damage as a result of accidents during training.
The release of eagles in a wintering area eliminates the dangers of
territorial aggression from resident adults and allows the rehabilitated
birds to learn secure feeding and roosting sites by following the local

wintering population. Since the rehabilitated eagles are released several
months before the abundant food supply dwindles, they have sufficient
time to develop the strength and skill necessary to compete in the wild
state. (Servheen and English, 1976, English and Servheen, 1977).
During the last eight years, 39 Bald Eagles and numerous other birds
of prey have been treated at the zoo. In 1979, 24 birds were admitted
for treatment, six of which were Bald Eagles. None of these birds were
later reintroduced to the wild and eight are pending release. Of the other
seven, two were transferred to other zoos, one was retained at Woodland
Park Zoo and four died.
Of 39 Bald Eagles received from 1971 to the spring of 1980, 14 have
been successfully returned to the wild and four are pending release, giving
a success rate of 46% with this species.
Although there have been a number of raptor rehabilitation programmes
started throughout the country, little material has been published indi-
cating the results of these projects. The primary reason for this lack of
data is that most of the birds have been released after rehabilitation, and

success has been assumed without long-term monitoring or observation.
When so much time and expense have been invested in the bird, it is
essential that adequate time be spent by observers to determine whether
release was successful, preferably using radio-telemetry equipment. Tele-
metry gear, which includes a three-channel receiver and transmitters, is
necessary in order to locate and assess the hunting ability of the eagles
after their release. We are often asked why such a considerable amount
of time is spent on raptor rehabilitation when we are probably dealing
with "Nature's losers" anyway. It is true that many of these birds that
become sick or injured have been forced into marginal habitat because
they have been poor competitors. Often this marginal habitat is in close
proximity to people: the raptors then may find little prey, or may be shot
for target practice or by farmers who feel that they are protecting their
livestock. Our answer has been that for humanitarian reasons we have no
choice; but perhaps an even more important reason is that the information
that results from these programmes helps to educate the public on the
value of wildlife and the role of the predator in nature. If this is true, it is
time well spent.

These are a few notes on an eagle which I had for several weeks. It
crashed in front of a car in West Vancouver. Fortunately the driver was
sensible, and left the car where it was while she phoned the S.P.C.A. The
bird stayed put until it was picked up. This was a bird in its second sum-
mer, with a wing span of about six and a half feet (two metres) and a
weight of about 8 lb 6 oz (3.8 kg.) It still had its white streaked juvenile
plumage, with a brown head.
It was thought to have been shot, but information was vague. There
was a large tear in its left wing. The smaller radius bone was intact, but
the larger ulna was broken. It was, however, a clean break, but one end
of the bone stuck out. The bird had lost a considerable amount of blood
by the time I got it. The wound was cleaned and damaged tissue removed.
Antibiotic powder was put in the wound and the bird was started on the
antibiotic Septra (sulphonamide and trimethoprim). This was put into a
fish.
The next day an elastic bandage was wrapped around the wing. It lasted
a few hours. It was put on again more firmly and stayed on. The bird was
housed in an indoor flight 19 by 5 by 5 feet (5.7 by 1.5 by 1.5 metres).
For the first few days, especially if a sudden movement was made, it
would throw itself back on its tail, leaving its feet free to strike. It was
supported by the wings, or one wing after it was bandaged. When it did
this, the tail was bent forward under the bird. The long tail dragged
on the ground when it walked, and soon got in rather a mess, as did the
long wings. The huge flight feathers weighed up to 4.5 g. each. Only once
did it attempt to bite. The beak is quite blunt (in contrast to hawks) and
it is not used as a weapon. Its feet, however, were the same size as my
hands, with wicked claws. Once they locked on to something it was very
difficult to break their grip.
Its main food was fish. These were usually taken head first and swal-
low whole. Digestion was complete - bones and all. The droppings were
semi-solid and smelled awful as is the case with all fish-eaters. Meat would
be eaten when there was no fish. No parasites were found in the droppings
but the bird did have feather lice. In fact it was only the third local spe-
cies, along with crows and herons, to have lice.
The eagle was eating four or five two ounce (5.6 g) oolichans, and up to
eight, per day, with some meat on occasions. Oolichans are a local smelt

which run upriver from the sea for a few weeks in late spring. Fortunately,
the run had just started when the eagle came into my care. These fish are
very oily and were once dried and used as candles by the Indians.
In seven days, the eagle was taking fish from my hand. This was accom-
panied by a loud double grunt.This was the only sound it ever made. It
was a very perceptive bird, and would only let me come near. If anyone
else came into the room it would run into a corner and hold its head down
to one side, in what can only be described as an attitude of shyness.
It would let me handle the broken wing, provided I moved slowly. By
now the wound had healed well, with no infection, but one end of the
bone was still sticking out. This time, the bone was wired together. A week
later the bandage was taken off as it was serving no purpose. The wing
had healed, but drooped badly. Antibiotics were discontinued.
The eagle was put out daily in the garden for exercise. At first a cloth
was thrown over it, but later it was simply picked up across the back,
the wings being held to the side, and the feet being held well away from
my body. Once outside, it elicited no more than curiosity from the other
birds. This was more than can be said for my old dog. Normally peaceful,
he ran straight through a fence at it when he first saw it. They had to be
kept apart after that.
The eagle ran about the garden, jumping on high objects, and flapping
its wings. It could move at surprising speed with the aid of its wings.
In a couple of weeks, it went to the local game farm, just as it was
beginning to moult. I visited it about three months later. It had moulted
beautifully and could manage up a two-perch pole to its shelter, 12 feet
up. Its wing still drooped badly but it was sitting exercising it vigorously.
It still had a brown head and was noticeably smaller than a white-headed
cage-mate.

SUCCESSES WITH BIRDS OF PREY AT THE PRETORIA ZOO
</sectionHeader>

By F.C. BARNICOAT (Johannesburg, South Africa)
The National Zoological Gardens of South Africa in Pretoria is the
country&amp;apos;s leading zoo. During a visit this July I had the good fortune to
meet Mr. J, Nieman (Head Keeper - Bird Section) who kindly described
some recent breeding successes with owls and other birds of prey, a rep-
resentative collection of which has long been housed in this zoo. The Birds
of Prey Aviaries - a fine steel structure - date from 1912 and the Large
Flight Aviary, 45 m long and 13 m wide, from the same period. Through
the years birds of prey have proved among the most long lived exhibits
and there have been some notable characters, like the Andean Condor, but
scant attention was paid to breeding. Recently the outlook has changed
and a concerted effort has been made to do away with overcrowding of
aviary space, to ensure ideal diets for individual species and to provide
such species as are kept with optimum conditions for breeding.
The owls have now been moved to the new complex of owl aviaries,
which is really magnificent. Each species is housed in its own large aviary -
Barn Owl Tyto alba , Grass Owl Tyto capensis , African Marsh Owl A to
cape ns is, Wood Owl Ciccaba woodfordii , Cape Eagle Owl Bubo cap-
ensis, Spotted Eagle Owl Bubo africanus and Eurasian (Great) Eagle Owl
Bubo bubo. The Barn Owls have raised four young and several of the
others have laid eggs, so that further breeding successes seem a likelihood
in the near future. Inspiration comes from the rearing of no less than 28
Spotted Eagle Owls, most of which were carefully rehabilitated into the
wild state. Being able to put something back into the wild is one of the
aims of the zoo.
At present six species of vulture are being displayed - 2 King Vultures
Sarcorhamphus papa in an aviary to themselves and which it is hoped will
soon be sexed by laparoscopy and will prove to be a pair, and several Tur-
key Vultures Cathartes aura , Cape Vultures Gyps coprotheres, White-
backed Vultures Gyps africanus , Black Vultures Aegypius monachus and
Indian Black Vultures Sarcogyps calvus all housed together in the Large
Flight Aviary. One end of this aviary is a simulated cliff face, but a pair of
Cape Vultures preferred an artificial nesting site erected near the centre of
the aviary - a wire platform approximately IVz metres square on top of a
pole about 3Vz metres high. On this they had constructed a substantial nest
of drybranch.es and the female is at present incubating an egg. As I watched,
she left the nest and soon returned with a mouthful of green leaves which

she worked into the nest. The outcome of this nesting is being eagerly
awaited because it is thought that this would be the first breeding in cap-
tivity if a Cape Vulture were to be reared.
Other birds of prey in the collection include the Fish Eagle Haliaetus
vocifer, Black Eagle Aquila verreauxi , Tawny Eagle A. rapax , Wahlberg&amp;apos;s
Eagle A. wahlbergi, Bateleur Terathopius ecaudatus , Jackal Buzzard Buteo

successful rearing of a Gymnogene Polyboroides typus. The pair had an
aviary to themselves and 19 eggs were laid before success came at last. Six

BIRDS OF PREY AT THE NATAL ZOOLOGICAL GARDENS,
SOUTH AFRICA
By W.H. COLLARD (Director)
The Natal Zoological Gardens are situated some twelve miles outside
</table>
<bodyText confidence="0.96867245" page_id="56284368"  page_num="274" year="" vol="">
Pietermaritzburg in an attractive spot on the edge of the famous "Valley
of a Thousand Hills". Many pressing tasks connected with the animals have
had to take priority to erecting bird aviaries on the scale I should have liked.
Consequently our accommodation for the birds of prey has hardly been
extensive enough to really encourage breeding results. Furthermore, the
restrictions of the nature conservation authorities in South Africa ensure
that birds of prey seldom become available. Most birds of this group which
have been in the zoo were injured specimens, rescued and subsequently
presented to us. It is disappointing that mates for our odd birds were
practically never obtainable.
This group is attractive to the general public, and feeding presents no
problem. We use chickens as the staple diet and rats whenever they are
trapped. Cheap supplies of meat are frequently available from farmers in
the surrounding district, but extreme caution must be exercised as we
discovered to our cost. A number of birds, including the female of my
much-valued pair of Black Eagles, died after eating meat from a carcass
preferred by a farmer who, unbeknown to us, had dosed the animal very
heavily with antibiotics in his attempts to save It. This disaster underlines
the necessity of being&amp;apos; very cautious of the source of the meat supply one
uses.

In the large aviary devoted to the birds of prey I have at present a pair
of Yellow-billed Kites Milvus migrans aegyptius. After about four years
here, they nested in 1980. Unfortunately the two eggs layed were broken
by the Pied Crows in the same aviary. The only other species I had in a
pair was the Black Eagle Aquila verreauxi which like all our local birds we
hold on special permit from the Natal Parks Board. The female was lost
tragically after being inadvertently fed on contaminated meat, as men-
tioned. Fortunately the male was unaffected and remains a handsome
exhibit. We have also acquired an immature Black Eagle which is now
probably nearing four years old, and it has at last lost its brown juvenile
plumage and is rapidly assuming the black plumage of the adult male with
the white "V" on the back clearly visible. I have had two other species of
eagle for seven or more years, a male Tawny Eagle A. rapax and a female
Wahlberg's Eagle A. wahlbergi. At present I also possess odd specimens of
the Jackal Buzzard Buteo rufofuscus and the Marsh Harrier Circus aeru-
ginosus ranivorus. It is a pity that the prospect of getting mates is so
remote.
In the past I have kept successfully the African Goshawk Accipiter tachira ,
Little Sparrowhawk Accipiter minullus , Chanting Goshawk Melierax
canorus, Greater Kestrel Falco rupicoloides and Rock Kestrel Falco
tinnunculus, but usually in single specimens. All these species are rela-
tively common and widespread in South Africa, but they have been attrac-
tive in our aviaries none the less.
I also have four Cape Vultures Gyps coprotheres in the largest aviary.
They have made nests, but never laid. This is the largest and most com-
mon species of our vultures, but its numbers are declining in the wild state
as more and more land is developed for agriculture and the dead animals
are buried. I should imagine that they would need very large aviary ac-
commodation for breeding success in captivity.
This area is fairly mountainous and the wild population of birds pro-
vides much additional interest. The White-necked Raven is a handsome bird
somewhat larger and with a far heavier beak than the crows. It is jet black
with an attractive white collar. It always bred in the surrounding moun-
tains, but over the years the supplies of food it is able to steal through the
feeding of large quantities of meat to the animals in the zoo as well as in
the nearby Natal Lion Park have led to an artificial increase in its numbers.
Large flocks of them come into the zoo from the surrounding mountains
with the result that it is no longer possible to breed waterfowl or gamebirds
of any kind here. They have become a pest and even seem to be having an
adverse effect upon the local wild bird population.

BIRDS OF PREY KEPT AT LILFORD PARK, PETERBOROUGH

From 1861, when Thomas Littleton Powys acceded to the title of fourth
Lord Lilford, there has been a collection of birds within Lilford Park. There
was, however, a break of 26 years from 1944, when the estate was sold to
pay death duties, until the present Lord Lilford, the seventh, re-acquired
240 acres of the estate in 1970. Since this time, the grounds, the Hall and,
most importantly, the aviaries have been renewed, re-stocked and opened
to the public.
The fourth Lord Lilford was responsible for the establishment of a very
large and comprehensive collection of birds from all over the world. A man
with a deep and abiding passion for all things ornithological, he was an
authority on European birds, with a special affection for Spain where he
had travelled extensively. He had a great many published works to his
name and was President of the British Ornithologists' Union for 29 years.
I have estimated that approximately 433 species of birds were kept be-
tween 1865 and 1893. In spite of the diversity of species kept, Lilford had
a great interest in birds of prey and, indeed, was an accomplished falconer.
Ninety-three species of diurnal and nocturnal birds of prey were kept
between the dates mentioned above. It is very difficult to choose examples
but some of the more unusual were the Harpy Eagle, Spanish Imperial
Eagle, several forms of Gyr, White-bellied Sea Eagle, Red-footed Falcon,
Great Grey Ural Owl, Boobook Owl and Burrowing Owl.
Of course, the bird that Lord Lilford is usually remembered for is the
Little Owl Athene noctua. He released a great many on the estate over a
period of several years and mentions liberating 44 in one year. They were
probably of Dutch origin and were purchased from Leadenhall market.
The releases began around 1888, the first nest being found on 23rd April
1889. Although he was not the only person to try establishing these
charming owls, his birds played a major part in the colonisation of Britain.
Free-flying Lammergeiers Gypaetus barbatus, against a back-cloth of an
English country hall, must have been a unique sight. Lilford achieved this
by obtaining the birds as fledglings and allowing them their freedom in the
courtyards and, eventually, the whole park where he could enjoy the spec-
tacle of these huge birds circling the Hall (often pursued by a flock of
rooks) or basking in the sun on the grassed terrace.
On 7th April 1888, Lord Lilford reported, in a letter, that one of his
Golden Eagles Aquila chrysaetos, at 11 years of age, was sitting on one

egg. Unfortunately, there is no record of hatching. The birds had, in Lord
Lilford's words, "built a good nest themselves", an illustration of which,
with the female sitting, was depicted by Archibald Thorburn who had been
engaged to illustrate Lilford's "Coloured Figures of the British Islands".
A White-tailed Sea Eagle Haliaeetus albicilla was living in the aviaries
in 1894. It was then 40 years old and had been taken from a nest in
southern Ireland. Lilford mentions that, at that time, he thought there
could be no more than three pairs living wild in the United Kingdom.
Two vultures, a Black Aegypius monachm and a Griffon Gyps fulvus,
paired, built a nest and laid from one to three eggs every year for about
13 years but apparently the eggs were never fertile. Both birds were taken
from nests in Spain, In May 1893, a Ural Owl Strix uralensis laid an egg
but made no attempt to incubate. The egg was transferred to a Barn Owl's
nest but there is no record of it hatching. Two years later a pair of Burrow-
ing Owls Speotyto cunkularia laid four eggs and hatched one chick, in spite
of the fact that there were also Prairie Dogs in the same compartment. Of
course, with such a large collection, there are many events of avicultural
interest and I have only been able to mention a few here.
Finally, I do feel that, whilst it is unlikely that collections such as
Lilford's will be seen again, and in spite of its great interest to ornitholo-
gists at that time and the wealth of new information gleaned from it, it
was a great consumer of birds which is something that our present day
collections must not be.

THE WORK OF THE HAWK TRUST

Many species of birds of prey are
threatened in the wild. The causes of
their decline vary, but include persecu-
tion by man (shooting, trapping and
egg collecting), destruction of the wild
places in which they live and the
use of poisonous chemicals. As a
result, birds of prey need our help.
The Hawk Trust is a charitable
association, created in 1969 by a
handful of enthusiasts concerned about
the alarming decline in birds of prey. It is doing all it can to conserve
British and, to a lesser extent, foreign birds of prey. It achieves this by
organising voluntary wardening and guarding of vulnerable nests; by
educating the public, shooters, landowners, farmers and gamekeepers; by
scientific studies on birds of prey in the wild and in captivity. As a result,
much is being learned about these birds and their way of life. The Hawk
Trust also leases a forest area on the Welsh borders and hopes to increase
its control of similar areas suitable for birds of prey.
One aspect of the Trust's work concerns those birds of prey that are
found sick, injured or orphaned. Such birds will die if they do not receive
specialised care. The Hawk Trust seeks to provide this by advising veterinary
surgeons and members of the public on the treatment of casualties and, in
a few cases, by providing such care itself. The Trust has veterinary surgeons
and zoologists amongst its members and these, in conjunction with the
Royal Society for the Protection of Birds and the Royal Society for the
Prevention of Cruelty to Animals, have organised a scheme to ensure that
endangered British species receive prompt attention from a veterinary
surgeon with experience of birds. It must be emphasised, of course, that
all birds of prey are protected in Britain and only those birds that are
genuinely sick, injured or abandoned may be kept without a licence.
Hawks, eagles and falcons - the very names symbolise freedom and the
wide open spaces of our world. And as the wild world comes under in-
creasing human pressure, these splendid birds are among the first to suffer.
The Hawk Trust aims to alleviate this situation through the support of
its membership, which must continue to grow if it is to succeed. The
</bodyText>

birds of prey deserve this help as they are not only beautiful but also play
an important role in nature. Readers who would like further information,
or who might like to consider joining, are welcome to write to the Hon.
Secretary at the above address.

BREEDING THE CAPE PARROT
Poicephalus robustus
By Rosemary Low (Barnet)

Beauty, it is said, is in the eyes of the beholder, thus I would not expect
the Cape or Brown-necked Parrot Poicephalus robustus to be universally
considered attractive. Indeed, Emilius Hopkinson (1910) described it as
"an extraordinary ugly-looking bird on account of its huge, powerful beak
and ungainly head, its heavy build and rather dull coloration , and except
for its rarity possesses few attractions as a cage bird."
To my mind, nothing could be further from the truth. Its huge beak
gives it the air of a delightful caricature of a parrot; its head is not ungainly -
this impression being an illusion caused by the bill; its build is not heavy
and its coloration is far from dull. As for possessing few attractions, the
three specimens I have kept have caused me to rate the Cape Parrot as one
of my favourite species. It is true that they tend to be shy but one, a tame
male, was one of the most charming and intelligent parrots I have ever kept.
In my experience, it has an advantage shared by no other parrot of sim-
ilar size: it is quiet and its voice is pleasant - almost musical. Hopkinson
described in his birds "the awful habit of screaming wildly when anyone
goes near them" which I assume one can equate with "growling" in un-
tamed Grey Parrots, as my birds have never behaved in this way.
In coloration, the Cape Parrot is nearest to the Jardine's Poicephalus
gulielmi , but is immediately distinguished by its larger size and much more
massive beak. The nominate race is found in extreme south-eastern Africa
from Knysna and eastern Cape Province to Natal, western Zululand, wes-
tern Swaziland and eastern Transvaal. It is a locally distributed bird of
forest and thick bush.
Judging by their appearance, my birds are of the race suahelicus from
Mozambique,Zimbabwe, northern Lesotho, northern South West Africa
to Angola, southern Congo and central Tanzania.
Birds of this subspecies are more beautiful than the nominate race. The

head feathers of the male are silver-grey, suffused with pink - an effect of
unusual beauty quite unlike that of any other parrot. It is also unlike that
of the nominate race in which the head is brownish - but certainly not
brown, being tinted with greenish and yellowish-brown.
In P. robustus robustus females and some males have the forehead
orange; in suahelicus only the female has the forehead, and part of the
crown orange. The feathers of the back and wing coverts are black, broadly
edged with dark green. The rump and underparts are green, suffused with
dull blue and/or grey. Thighs and outer edge of the wing are orange and
the tail is blackish-brown. The iris is dark brown and the bill is pale horn
colour. Length is slightly smaller than a Grey Parrot, ie. about 32 cm
(12 in.). The head and bill are larger in the male, somehow giving it an
appealing air which, to my eyes is more attractive than the more colour-
ful plumage of the female.
Apart from Hopkinson's articles in the Avicultural Magazine (1910 and
1916), Bannerman's notes which quote Hopkinson, and reports of the
breeding successes at Basle Zoo in Switzerland (Lang, 1969), and those of
G. and H. Isert (1980), very little has been written about the Cape Parrot.
It is a rare bird in captivity for several reasons. First, it would appear to be
difficult to establish, the mortality rate among freshly caught birds being
high. Secondly, export is prohibited in some parts of its range. Its
numbers are increasingly giving cause for concern, although its exact
status in the three areas in which it is found must be difficult to deter-
mine. At the time of writing it is placed on List B (vulnerable) of the
Washington Convention. Thirdly, there has never been any demand for or
interest in this species. This may be due partly to its fearsome beak .
As can be seen from the accompanying photograph, the tip of the
upper mandible tapers to a very curved, fine point, exceeding in this res-
pect any parrot I know. (One wonders whether this is an adaptation for
dealing with a certain item of its diet.) Those unfamiliar with this species
could gain the impression that the bill was overgrown. According to Ban-
nerman, the length of the upper mandible is 39.46 mm in the male and
34.4 in the female.
Until 1975 my knowledge of the Cape Parrot was mainly confined to
the specimen exhibited at London Zoo and to those seen during a visit to
Basle Zoo in 1972. It was there that the first recorded captive breeding
occurred in 1964.
In 1975 my husband and I were unexpectedly offered a male Cape
Parrot which had been bought at Harrods three years previously. The
owner felt that she could no longer give it sufficient attention. It so hap-

pened that a dealer had been advertising a female of this species for several
months and I therefore lost no time in telephoning him. To my great dis-
appointment I was informed that he had parted with it to another dealer
on the previous day! He did not know the name of the buyer, only that
he occasionallly took birds to the well-known Sunday morning bird mar-
ket in the East End of London. The following day was a Sunday and by a
great stroke of good fortune my husband was able to track the bird down
and to return home with it. (The purchase price was very modest, indica-
ting the complete lack of interest in this species.) It almost seemed as
though fate had played a hand to bring the male and female together.
The two birds were caged side by side for a while and, on introduction,
proved to be entirely compatible. After several months it was possible to
place them in ?n outdoor aviary where the female proved to be rather shy,
disappearing into the nest-box on sight of people. The male, however, was
tame and soon established himself as a favourite. I could not resist saving
special tit-bits, such as cubes of cheese, for this engaging character. When
excited, he would quickly rap his beak on the side of the aviary, and also
make a noise like distant machine-gun fire.
I recorded the subsequent events in "Parrots: their care and breeding":
"During their first year outside the male constantly fed the female, with
elaborate pumping of the head, and also attempted to mate. Regrettably,
he entirely lacked a tail and this never grew, so whether he was ever com-
pletely successful I do not know. During the following year the female
laid two clutches, the first egg of each clutch being laid on August 10 and
September 12. The nest was inaccessible but the dates were accurate be-
cause I have never seen a parrot which was more obviously about to lay.
The nesting site was a narrow log which supported a large nest-box. The
birds gnawed through the base of the box into the log."
To my intense regret, a few days later the male was horribly injured by
a predator, probably a fox, which pulled his leg through 25 mm (1 in)
welded mesh and bit it off at the top of the thigh. Not surprisingly, the
shock and resulting loss of blood led to his untimely death.
Exactly a year later, while visiting Walsrode Bird Park in Germany, my
attention was claimed by two male Cape Parrots in an enclosure in the
Parrot House. Later I learned that there was a female with two chicks in-
side the nest-box and was privileged to have a quick glimpse of the two-
week old chicks with their large, light coloured bills. To my delight the
Director generously agreed to let us have the surplus adult male.
This fine bird arrived at the end of March and was quarantined on our
premises for the required 35 days. On May 12 he was placed with the

female in a small outdoor aviary which measures only 1.8 m (6 ft) x
76 cm (2 ft 6 in) x 1.8 m (6 ft) high. There is no enclosed shelter; part of
the roof is covered and the aviary is surrounded by small conifers, with a
fence at the rear. Thus it is extremely secluded. By watching from an up-
stairs window which overlooks the aviary I saw, that day, that the two
birds were delighted with each other (previously they had been caged side
by side for a few days). The female spent hours preening the male who, in
turn, was seen to feed the female with laborious head-pumping move-
ments.
The female had always been shy and the nervousness of the male re-
sulted in the pair seldom being visible, for they would sit at the end of the
aviary hidden by the conifers. Judging by her behaviour, I estimated that
the female had laid by August 12. She deserted the nest on September 27 -
two weeks after the eggs were due to hatch. It is possible that a chick or
chicks had hatched and died; on the other hand, I have known even ex-
perienced breeding hens to incubate for two weeks past the hatching time.
The male would spend long periods in the nest or sitting in the entrance
but would rush nervously into the box when the aviary was approached.
This made nest inspection a pointless exercise as the small base of the
nest was covered by the adults.
During the end of October the female laid a second clutch. On the
evening of November 28 I heard a sound which was unexpected and
deeply gratifying - that of a chick coming from the Cape Parrots' nest-
box. That was the first indication of its presence. Soaked sunflower seed
was at once given instead of dry sunflower as the crop of a young chick
can become impacted with whole dry kernels, and soaked seed is more
nutritious and easier to digest. The seed is soaked for 24 hours, then
washed thoroughly under a running tap. The quantity of apple and carrot
was increased and a couple of cracked walnuts were offered daily.
I was worried by the fact that the more nutritious foods, such as corn-
on-the-cob, cheese and breadand milk, were thrown on the floor, untasted
by these conservative feeders.
On the night following the first sounds of the chick, I heard it again,
loudly and clearly penetrating the silence of the night. On subsequent
evenings I listened in vain. For about ten days, the presence of the parents
in the nest was the only hint that it survived. The weather was uncharac-
teristically kind and mild but, knowing it could not stay that way much
longer, my husband and I decided to move the nest-box containing the
whole family - that is, if the chick had survived - to an indoor flight.
On December 10 my husband inspected the nest and caught a brief

glimpse of a chick. Just before dusk two days later, the family was trans-
ferred to a flight indoors measuring about 1.8 m (6 ft) long, 60 cm (2 ft)
wide and 1.8 m (6 ft) high. The nest-box was hung at the back in the
darkest part of the room, and a tall-growing ivy was placed nearby in an
attempt to simulate their previous situation.
The birds were extremely wary and the male disappeared into the nest
when anyone entered the room. For several days we kept out as much as
possible - but the room contained about 15 other birds which needed atten-
tion. Gradually the Cape Parrots became used to their new environment
and after two weeks their happy chortling calls could again be heard, indi-
cating they were quite at home. By this time the weather was bitterly cold
and the first snow had fallen.
After a few days, when it was apparent that no harm had been caused
by their abrupt removal, the nest-box was inspected daily. At first it was
not easy to see the chick but after a few days we were able to take a good
look at it. The parents would hide their heads in the corners, leaving the
chick undefended and standing up unconcernedly and looking at us.
The food-begging call was often heard: a high-pitched double note,
which became lower in pitch as the chick matured.
By Christmas the young bird was covered in dense, short white down.
Its large pink beak had prominent protruberances on each side; its feet
were pink with white nails. By December 27 the chick's forehead and crown
were pale orange - coloured by the feathers under the skin, covering the
same area as the orange on the female's head. By January 4 its forehead
was covered in bright orange feathers, the rest of the head being unfeathered.
By January 14 its wings were feathered. Body size was two-thirds that of
an adult.
The daily inspection on January 17 revealed that the chick had been
plucked on the head; subsequently the nape, mantle and breast were
plucked. However, much to my surprise, new feathers had replaced the
plucked ones by the second week in February. It was during this time
that I first heard the young bird quietly warbling in the nest-box. During
nest inspection on February 17, I gently picked up the young bird to en-
sure that its feet were perfect. It made no attempt either to bite or to
struggle. Next morning it was seen at the nest entrance for the first time.
There was no hint that anything was wrong with it, or of the tragedy to
follow. It continued to look out of the nest but made no attempt to leave.
On March 1 I removed it from the nest and placed it on the perch. It was
then apparent that the chick was abnormally weak. On the following day
it fell from the perch and, much to my distress, it died during the early

hours of the following morning. Autopsy revealed that, although apparent-
ly normal, it was severely afflicted with rickets and many of its bones were
broken in the fall.
Food taken during the rearing period consisted mainly of soaked sun-
flower, sweet com (bought frozen, then thawed), apple, carrot and grapes
and, on occasions, celery. One or two walnuts, a great favourite with this
species, were offered daily.
I can recommend offering sweet corn to birds which refuse corn-on-the-
cob. At First the grains were ignored but were soon taken with relish. They
eventually formed the larger part of the vegetable matter taken. No animal
protein was included in the rearing food for the simple reason that the par-
ents would not eat it. Neither would they take food on which bone meal
had been sprinkled. However, cuttlefish "bone" was eaten and this must
have been the principal source of calcium. Either it was insufficient or the
diet was lacking in Vitamin D, preventing absorption of calcium.
During the spring the pair were returned to their outdoor aviary but,
much to my disappointment, made no further attempt to nest during 1980.
In 1981 the female laid during the middle of May, on or about May 16.
Nest inspection was a pointless exercise during incubation since whenever
anyone approached the aviary, the male retired to the nest-box and neither
bird would move when the nest-box lid was opened.
When the nest was inspected on June 21 a chick was seen which was
judged to be about one week old. At the second inspection a few days later
a second chick was seen. (Doubtless it was present, but hidden, at the first
inspection.) Regular inspection then occurred at intervals of a few days;
each time a handful of pet litter (compressed wood shavings) was placed in
the nest to help absorb the droppings.
On July 7 I noted that the chicks had a covering of very short white
down, in evenly spaced tufts. Six days later the down colour had changed
to golden yellow. There was an orange blush on the forehead where the
feathers were coming through; wing feathers were also erupting. The bills
were a light pink with the sides of the upper mandible raised slightly. On
July 211 noted in my diary that the chicks had "dense gold and yellow
down with a ruff of white down framing the neck. They stood up and
growled while the parents hid their heads."
No further notes were made on their development as my husband and
I were away for 17 days. On August 19, shortly after our return, one
Cape chick was looking out of the nest. One chick was seen out of the nest
on September 4 and two chicks on September 7. However, they were very
shy, and returned to the nest when they saw anyone near, so could have

left the nest unseen before then.
They were perfectly feathered and large - as large as the female. The
upper mandible of the first chick to leave the nest was slightly larger
than that of the female so possibly it is a male. Both young differ from the
adults in the pinker beak and cere and in the absence of orange feathers on
the bend of the wing and on the thighs. They otherwise resemble the fe-
male except for the reduced area of orange on the head and the dark grey
feathering on the lores. They returned to the nest every night for several
weeks after first vacating it.
The rearing foods were similar to those already mentioned, with the
addition of fresh or cooked peas on occasions and the stones of peaches
and plums from which they extracted the kernels with ease. Bone meal or
bone flour was sprinkled on the sunflower seed.
As most members reading this will not be in possession of the Avicul-
tural Magazine for 1910, it might be of interest to quote further from
Emilius Hopkinson's interesting article on this species.
Regarding its wild life he wrote: "In the Gambia these parrots appear
to be confined to that part of the country between the mouths of the
Vinntang Creek (about 30 miles from the sea) and the McCarthy Island
District, some 150 miles up the river, and within these limits are especially
common on the South Bank where the country is well-wooded and fringed
with a very deep belt of Mangroves. They never seem to wander far away
from the river or its creeks at any time, and even on our boundary, though
in most places this is only seven miles from the river, one never sees them;
nor have I ever come across a single individual in the Upper River, where
there are no Mangroves (and, therefore, probably no attractions for the
Bambaras (the Mandingo name for this species, the Bambara people being
renowned for their strength and size), nor in the districts near Bathurst
and the sea, where, although there are plenty of Mangroves, these are
bushes rather than trees. In fact, one may say that they confine themselves
to that part of the country where the water is neither too salt nor too
fresh, but sufficiently brackish to encourage a luxuriant growth of Man-
groves. In the breeding season they are even more local, and are then hard-
ly ever to be seen outside the Mangrove belt.
"During the winter months they go about in parties of six to twelve,
visiting the farms and clearings to feed on the ground-nuts, which are dug
up about November and left in heaps in the open to dry: but every evening
they are seen flying off in the direction of the river to roost in the trees
which border it. They make their presence known far and wide as they fly

were weighed down in front by their huge beaks and heads, though in
spite of their apparent top heaviness their flight, accomplished with very
rapid wing-beats, is fast and powerful. Their breeding season commences
about March or April, and they make their nests in holes in the larger trees
of the Mangrove belt, which is half forest, half swamp, an almost impene-
trable growth, except by means of the small creeks which in places pierce
it, and to which they keep themselves almost entirely during the hot
months of the year.
".Their only enemies here must be the Green Monkeys, and against
them the old birds should have splendid weapons in their terrible beaks...."
Regarding this species in captivity, Hopkinson wrote: "The young I
have almost given up trying to keep, as I have never yet known any survive
longer than eight months, an age that was only reached by one of my birds,
most of which died soon after being taken, or at any rate within six months.
While hand-fed they take readily what is given them, chiefly crushed and
chewed ground nuts, with perhaps a little bread, biscuit or boiled rice, and
as they get older and begin to feed themselves, will eat groundnuts freely,
though nothing else; but they rarely seem to thrive. I think the reason
must be that they are fed by their parents almost entirely on the seeds and
fruits of the Mangroves among which they are born, and that for this we
can supply no efficient substitute. The old birds thrive better, or at any
rate last longer; one I had lived two years at least at the Zoo after it got
there."
In view of the foregoing information regarding the difficulty of estab-
lishing the Cape Parrot in captivity, the observations quoted by Forshaw
(Skead, 1971) are highly surprising: "In some parts of the Transkei region,
eastern South Africa, there is widespread removal of young birds from
nests and trapping of adults for sale as pets, and it has been suggested that
this could be contributing to the noticeable decline in numbers."
Export of this species from South Africa is prohibited; in any case, as
previously mentioned, there is no demand for it. If widespread trapping
occurs, this must be to meet a local demand, which again seems unlikely.
According to Skead (1964), in South Africa the main foods of the Cape
Parrot consist of the seeds of the yellow-woods, Podocarpus falcatus and
P. latifolius , kaffir plum Harpephyllum caffrum , wild olive Olea capensis
and Commiphora caryaofolia. He states that Podocarpus is particularly
important and has a great influence on movements. Seeds of the introduced
black wattle (Skead, 1971) are another favourite seasonal food.
Courtship behaviour consists mainly of the male feeding the female
with exaggerated head-swirling movements. In the first male, who was not

inhibited by my presence, I observed him to drop his wings, to form a cape
around the lower half of the body. I have also observed this in courting
Grey Parrots Psittacus erithacus. My pair is very affectionate in their beha-
viour towards each other, and spend long periods in mutual preening.
Nesting. It was regrettable that I was unable to record clutch sizes or
the incubation period; the latter is probably 28 days. Three eggs formed
the clutch in a nest found in Rhodesia (Vincent, 1946); it was situated
about 6 m from the ground in a hole in the trunk of a Brachystegia tree.
Approximately 30 cm from the entrance the eggs were laid on bare wood
in a cavity about 18 cm across.
Captive Breedings. I believe that these have occurred in only three
other collections: at Basle Zoo in Switzerland, and at Walsrode Bird Park
and with G. and H. Isert in West Germany. At Basle, consistent successes
were achieved between 1964 and 1971, young being reared each year ex-
cept in 1969. By 1968 15 young had been reared. In his account of these
successes, Lang (1969) mentions a clutch of four eggs and another of three,
also a nest in which three young were reared, thus three or four eggs may
form the usual clutch. Incubation periods were not given. Nestling periods
were apparently extremely variable, lasting between 54 and 79 days, but
probably averaging about ten weeks. Indeed 54 days hardly seems credible
and I cannot help wondering whether this was recorded in error.
At Walsrode two chicks were reared in 1978. As already mentioned, a
second male (later the father of my young) was present. In answer to my
enquiry, Dr. Teichmann and Klaus Trogisch told me that he was not al-
lowed near the nest-box or permitted to feed the chick. In 1979 two more
chicks were reared at Walsrode. Those reared in 1978 moulted when about
six months old.
Immature plumage. On leaving the nest the first young bird resembled
the female but had slightly more orange on the cheeks - a feature which is
barely noticeable in the female. The feathers of the crown and forehead
were tipped with orange, the rest of the head feathers being grey or pearly,
some with an orange tinge. The feathers of the lores were dark grey, instead
of orange as in the female. The upper mandible measured 3.7 cm (1 % in)
long and 2 cm (8/10 in) wide. The edge of the upper mandible was soft
and slightly raised. The young bird measured 25 cm (10 in).
The next two young were identical in appearance to each other. I
noted, in addition to the features described for the first young bird, that
they lacked the orange thighs found in the female. The beak, also the cere
had a distinct pink tinge. They were fully as large as the female; at a quick
glance the difference in the bill colour was the best means of recognition.

Immature plumage is of particular interest in robustus. First, almost
certainly it varies according to the subspecies. Secondly, as in more parrots
than is generally realised, immature plumage is more colourful than that of
the adult.
Forshaw (1973) describes the immature plumage as "No orange-red on
thighs or wings; head and neck brownish-olive; sometimes marked with
pink; tail dark green." His reference came from Dr Lang and the birds bred
in Basle Zoo which are of the nominate race.

Amazona dufresnia rhodocorytha
By Mr. &amp; Mrs. R. MANN (Peterborough)
Only four adult Red-topped Amazon Parrots are known to be kept as
aviary birds in Britain. We do not know the number kept as cage pets but
it must be very small. Our pair, which are on loan to us by Mr. Bryan S.
Ward, were acquired separately about five years ago, having been kept as
cage pets, and may well be quite old. In 1980, in a previous foster home,
they laid eggs that failed to hatch.
Description
Forshaw, in his book "Parrots of the World", called this bird the Red-
fronted Amazon but this is not really precise enough. Nine other Amazon
species have red to the front of the head and consequently we prefer the
older, more apt name of Red-topped Amazon. Like the other mainland
Amazons, the basic colour is green with paler underparts and tail feathers
that have wine-red markings. This species has an orange-red speculum to
the wing. They are one of the few pink-billed Amazons. The most distinc-
tive feature of this large bird is its head, the front and top of which is an
attractive orange-red; margining the lower bill there is a yellowish-orange
broad strip, while the sides to the head and throat are bluish. The iris is
brown (Cooper, in Forshaw, shows it red). It weighs about 1 lb (450 to
500 g).
Breeding
The pair were put out on 12th July, five days after receiving them.
Previously the 10 feet square aviary had held a pair of Triton Cockatoos
Cacatua galerita triton. This aviary forms part of a row and is sheltered
along the back with elm and willow trees. The 2 metre-long, sloping nest
box had previously served the cockatoos and was made of 10 cm thick
planks with thick strips of wood fixed in the corners and "steps" made out
of wood to encourage the birds to provide their own nesting material. This
was fastened to the back wall, well shaded from direct light, and arranged
so that the lower end entered the thickness of the wall and the inspection
door opened into the feeding passage behind. The cockatoos had built a
nest of thick wood splinters and the hen Amazon may well have augmented
this with her own parings of wood. Within a few days of putting them out-
side they were seen feeding and preening one another. A fortnight after we

had received them they were mating. The hen sexually solicits by holding
her head down and raising her vent. Before pairing both sexes flicker their
wings excitedly and they also quiver the wings during copulation. It is
general for American parrots to make a constant loud purring noise during
mating and in these birds it sounded almost like the rapid quacking of a
duck, or, with hindsight, like a chick Amazon being fed. The cock only
put one foot on the back of the hen when treading, keeping hold of the
perch with the distant one. After mating the hen entered the nest; in these
early stages the cock was never seen to go into the nest hole. On 10th
August the first egg was laid. Strangely then, and at all times, the parents
were never aggressive and this may well have been because we never had to
enter the aviary to examine the contents of the box. The three eggs were
laid at three-day intervals and incubation started when the second egg was
laid. The hen did all the sitting and the male appeared to feed the hen only
after she had left the box, in the morning and early evening. He always
roosted outside the box. Incubation took 24 days. On the day of hatching
the cock particularly sought out the soaked bread and it was now that he
first began to enter the nest box. After the hatching he took to sitting just
inside the nest hole, looking outward. The chicks were almost naked for
they had only a very few isolated "hairs" to the skin and the ears and eyes
were sealed tight. Growth was rapid. The hen could never be caught off
the nest and we could only get to see the chicks by gently raising her body
with a short stick but she seemed completely unperturbed by this. When
the chicks were 14 days old, we could clearly hear them being fed from a
distance of 50 metres. The noise of Amazon chicks begging is a repetitive
"gu-gu-gu". Now when we looked at the chicks, the hen would hiss
bronchially and rock her fluffed body slightly up and down, and the chicks
also began to do likewise. Most American parrot chicks make no sounds of
objection when being handled.
As the weather began to get cold and the nights draw in, and because
the parents had not yet begun their annual moult, we took the chicks into
the house for handrearing on 11th October. The two older chicks were
exactly 30 days old and the other three days younger. They were covered
with secondary down through which sprouted the well-grown pins of their
feathers. The eyes and ears were open and no colours were yet dis-
cernable although by the next day the blue on the cheek was breaking
through. With the very first feeding they hissed slightly, but after a mouth-
ful or so readily took to the spoon. When 34 days old, the biggest chick
weighed 450g, the next 380g, and the youngest 470g. Soon after this
they began to fly and were fully independent by the time they were a

hundred days old. The male parent did not seem particularly well at
about this time and so we brought him and his mate into the house for
medication and warmth. The chicks, which they had not seen for almost
five weeks, were ignored. They seemed as unconcerned when the young-
sters flew to land and walk over their cages as they would have been were
they houseflies.
At five weeks old, blue quills were visible around the throat area and
the beaks were horn-coloured. By the sixth week, yellow and faint red
feathers were now appearing on the head and the blue was more promin-
ent on the cheeks and throat areas. The skin around the eyes was white
as opposed to a light charcoal grey in the adults.
Foods and feeding
The parents would take almost any food. Their main diet was pine
nuts, peanuts, which they preferred unshelled, and a verysmall amount of
sunflower seed. The cock had a passion for freshly picked peas, celery and
carrots and had an orange most days. Their intake of sunflower increased
when the chicks were about two weeks old. They consumed soaked bread
with relish. The recipe was a basic nectar mixture initially given to us by
Mr. Aberdeen of Boston Aviaries which was made up of honey, golden
syrup, black treacle, condensed milk and a dry mix of Farex, red peppers,
PYM, seaweed and cod liver oil with wheatgerm. Warm water was added to
this mixture and large chunks of bread stirred in. Both particularly liked
cubes of cheese which were fed by hand, through the wire. The chicks
were fed on a mixture made up of Farex, ground sunflower seed, Bemax,
red peppers, bonemeal, seaweed and PYM mixed to a sloppy consistency
with water and a little milk. Grit and vitamins were added two or three
times a week. The amount of sunflower seed was increased each week and
ground less finely. They now share their parents' taste for celery and
cheese and enjoy lightly buttered toast in the mornings for their breakfast.
We would like to thank Mr. George Smith for his valuable help and
advice, his encouragement in writing this article and for suggesting us
as a foster home for these Amazons, and to express our gratitude to Mr.
Bryan Ward for allowing us to house and so breed these beautiful birds.

BREEDING THE BLACK AND WHITE CASQUED HORNBILL
Bycanistes subcylindricussubquadratus
AT THE METRO TORONTO ZOO, CANADA
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.986786294117647" page_id="56284409"  page_num="15" year="" vol="">
By D. BOURNE (Foreman) &amp; D. CHESSELL (Senior Keeper)
The Black and White Casqued Hornbill (or Grey-cheeked Hornbill),
Bycanistes subcylindricus subquadratus ranges from Cameroon and Angola
eastwards through central Africa to Kenya. The male is a large black and
white bird with a dark bill and truncated casque. The female is smaller and
has a casque confined to the base of the bill. For a more detailed description
see Mackworth-Praed and Grant (1970).
In late 1974 the Metro Toronto Zoo received 3.3 young B.s. subquadra-
tus from Uganda via a dealer. On arrival the birds were quarantined,
wormed with piperizine and telmin, and given tetracycline as a prophylac-
tic treatment. After the quarantine the birds were removed to new holdings
and paired.
The first breeding pair was in a holding barn for the 1976 and 1977
seasons. The female died of an injury at the end of the 1977 season and the
male died a month later of enteritis and septicaemia. This pair nested and
laid fertile eggs which failed to hatch (see Table II for details) The other
two breeding pairs, housed in the African Pavilion, had access to elm
trunks with rotten centres from 1976 through the 1979 breeding season.
These trunks did not stand up to the excavating by the hornbills and were
eventually replaced with artificial nestboxes. In 1980 both African
Pavilion breeding pairs nested successfully. One young was reared by the
pair in the north aviary (NA) and two young were reared by the pair in the
south aviary (SA).
Diet
The basic diet offered to the hornbills at the Metro Toronto Zoo con-
sisted of 300g carnivore mixture (Table IV), lOOg hard-boiled egg, 45g
carrot, 250g banana, 130g apple, 130g tomato and lOOg grapes. Additives
to this basic diet included two tablespoons SA-37 Supplement Powder,
one teaspoon dicalcium phosphate, and one tablespoon Carnivore Supple-
ment Powder. The grated carrots and eggs, along with the vitamin and
mineral supplements, were added to the carnivore mixture. This mixture
was then rolled into small balls of approximately one inch in diameter.
The fruits were cut into one inch, bite-size pieces. The carnivore ball mix-
ture and the fruit pieces were kept separate on the feeding tray and offered

to the birds once a day at approximately 10:00 a.m.
The average daily consumption of the basic diet for the SA pair was
560g, with the consumption of the carnivore ball mixture representing
30%, or 150g of the total intake.

Enclosures
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.989366575757576" page_id="56284410"  page_num="16" year="" vol="">
The enclosures for each of the three breeding pairs differed substantially
The holding barn pair was in a concrete-floored, wooden-walled and wire
mesh-fronted enclosure measuring 4.3 m long x 2.4 m wide x 2.1 m high.
A window (1.2 m x 0.6 m) at one end allowed some natural light into the
enclosure, but required supplementation with incandescent light. The area
was not open to visitors and staff were restricted. The temperature for
the area was maintained at approximately 21*C, and the relative humidity
at about 60%.
The two pairs in the African Pavilion were in vocal contact with each
other but not within sight. The pavilion temperature was maintained
around 23*C and the minimum relative humidity was approximately 60%.
The NA pair was in a well-lit, pyramid-shaped aviary of 2.5 cm nylon
mesh (15.2 m x 7.6mx 15.2 m high), which followed the contours of the
building. This aviary was shared with a group of Vulturine Guinea Fowl
Acryllium vulturinum as well as a pair of Red-crested Touracos Tauraco
erythrolophus. The nestbox, 7.6 m above the dirt floor, was the highest
perching point in the aviary.
The SA pair were in a smaller, pyramid-shaped aviary of 2.5 nylon
mesh, 7.3 m x 6.1 mx9.1 m high. This aviary was much darker due to
climbing plants covering the mesh. A covered public walkway, cutting
through one side, with glass viewing panels, allowed the public to look
into the aviary. The nestbox was one of the highest perching points in
the aviary, 3.6 m above the ground. There was also a small, shallow pool
in each aviary.
Nestboxes and Materials
In the wild, B. subcylindricus nests in a cavity fairly high in a tree or,
in certain instances, in rock crevices (Granvik, 1923). The entrance hole
is normally reduced to a narrow crack using a clay/soil mixture.
The pair in the holding barn utilised a nestbox measuring 46 cm x
46 cm x 61 cm high. It was located 1.5 m from the ground and had a
20 cm x 18 cm entrance hole. This opening was located 28 cm from the
base of the box, and a small perch was just below it. No material was
added to the box by the keepers, and apart from visual checks and re-

moval of two unhatched eggs, the nestbox was left untouched between
seasons. This pair was offered a clay/straw mixture in one bowl and
moist clay in another.
The NA pair used a nestbox measuring 46 cm x 46 cm x 91 cm high.
This nestbox had a 18 cm x 23 cm entrance centrally situated 64 cm from
the base. A perch below the opening allowed easy access to the nest. The
nestbox was packed with shavings to the level of the base of the hole.
The nestbox for the SA pair was 58 cm x 61 cm x 91 cm high, and had
a 15 cm x 15 cm entrance hole 61 cm from the base with an access perch
similar to the other nestbox. This box was also packed with shavings. Both
pairs had a constant supply of wet clay in a bowl at ground level and both
boxes were partially sealed with clay by the keepers. This clay was subse-
quently chipped off by the birds when they became interested in the nest-
boxes.
Courting
Feeding of the female by the male was the initial courting activity. In
the year-round heated buildings in which the three pairs were kept, this
activity started in January or February. In an outside aviary at Birdworld,
Farnham, England, it started in mid-April (Porritt and Riley, 1976). The
Metro Toronto Zoo males gave their females all of the grapes, the favourite
food of all the hornbills. The barn male also gave his female pieces of hard-
boiled egg yolks.
The barn male established his pairing by attacking another male housed
with them a month before his female walled-up in 1976. During this period
occasional mutual preening was seen, including the male grabbing at the
female's neck and preening around her tail feathers and vent area. This
activity was seen from early February to early April in the NA and SA pairs
and was followed by mating in mid-April. In the NA pair an attempted
mating was seen six weeks before a successful one was observed. The final
matings for the NA and SA pairs were observed 29 and 17 days, respec-
tively, before the female was sealed in the box. In 1977 the bam pair mated
55 days before the female was walled in. Unfortunately, no eggs were
found in the nest at the end of that confinement.
Courtship, feeding and preening occurred prior to the presence of a
nestbox in the NA pair as well as in the pair at Birdworld (Harvey, 1973).
Sealing-up and Confinement
The first interest in the nestbox was normally shown by the male in
January or February. The NA male showed first interest in the box the day

after copulation. Male interest in both cases involved chipping away of the
old clay and removing some shavings from the interior of the nestbox.
Within a few days the females were seen on the nestbox or perch in
front, investigating the hole and contents. On occasion the male appeared
to be coaxing the female to the box with food. He would fly to the tree
perch next to her and offer her food, then fly to the nestbox perch with
it. If she did not follow, he would repeat the process.
The SA female entered the box during February or March, six to
seven weeks before seal-up, but the NA female did not enter the box until
two and a half weeks before seal-up. The males were never seen to enter
the nestbox.
The use of wet clay started in the days following the female's first
entrance. The female was never seen carrying the clay, which agrees with
Moreau's statements (1937) about the genus Bycanistes. However, he also
said that females do the work of sealing, but our experience agrees with
Harvey (1976) in that the males were found to perform most of this work.
Occasionally, when the female was inside the box and the male outside,
they were seen with bills crossed, smoothing clay on one side of the hole,
then the other side. Examination of the box at the conclusion of the
breeding season showed a 10 cm thickness of clay around the hole inside
the box, and a 7 cm thickness on the outside.
From her first interest to final seal-up, the female spent more and more
time in the box, often hitting at the interior walls. The male made frequent
visits to her with clay balls and food. Wet river clay was used almost ex-
clusively during the sealing-up process, although Chapin (1926) mentions
that dung is often used by the genus Bycanistes. In 1977 the barn pair
used their faeces before switching to the clay provided. Later the barn
male was seen working with ground meat, but this was after the female
was sealed in.
The use of clay continued occasionally even when the work appeared
complete, with one male adding clay 70 days after seal-up. The finished
slots varied in shape from a crescent 10 cm high x 1.9 cm wide, to a T-shape
15 cm high x 2.5 cm wide.
The female of the barn pair was sealed in by early March (1976) or
early April (1977), whereas the NA and SA females, as well as the Bird-
world females, were sealed in by early to mid-May.
During the May-June incubation period the food intake, especially of
the carnivore ball mixture, steadily increased. In June, the average daily
consumption of the carnivore ball mixture for the SA pair was 320 g
(43% of the total), more than twice their original consumption. The fruit
consumption for this period remained constant (420 g per day).

Live food was also offered during this period. The average daily intake
for the SA pair consisted of six newborn mice, 12 mealworms and 18
crickets. The NA pair also increased their intake of the carnivore ball mix-
ture, but never accepted any live foods.
This increased intake of higher protein food items during incubation
concurs with the observations of Porritt and Riley (1976). The birds were
fed twice daily during this period to ensure that fresh food was always
available.
In early July, possibly during the rearing period, the SA male began
demanding more food. The daily carnivore ball mixture consumption for
this period was 620 g (43%), with the fruit consumption being 830 g (57%).
The daily live food consumption also increased to six newborn mice, 30
mealworms and 25 crickets. This doubling in food consumption was prob-
ably due to the increased demand of the youngsters.
In August, just before the female and young emerged, the SA pair's
intake of carnivore ball mixture dropped to 490 g per day, whilst their
fruit intake remained the same (810 g per day). The carnivore ball mix-
ture represented 37% of the total daily intake, which was comparable to
the original proportion before sealing in.
During July the NA pair had been gradually eating more food when,
abruptly on 21st July, 44 days after sealing up, the female stopped accep-
ting any food. This time period approximates the end of incubation repor-
ted by Moreau and Moreau (1941) for Bycanistes. The male continued to
offer the female food during the following days and never showed any
signs of abandoning his post. On 24th July she again started accepting food
from the male.
Both males were seen carrying objects other than food and clay to the
female in the box. These objects were predominantly twigs, but also
included grass, leaves, stones and bark. The SA male was seen offering
these materials during the three weeks prior to seal up, but the NA male
was only seen offering them during the third week following seal up.
According to Chapin (1926), West African hornbills never used material
to line the nest. Moreau and Moreau (1941) also suggested this for most
African species, although they mentioned acceptance of bark chips by a
female B. cristatus and a nest full of fruit stones. After emergence, exam-
ination of the interior of the SA nestbox produced a matted nest primarily
of sticks with feathers and shavings that could be lifted out in one piece.
This "nest" was 13 cm below the hole. The NA box had a similar matted
nest but no sticks were used and fewer feathers were evident. These mater-
ials were found beneath the nestbox and were presumed to have been

pushed out during the female's cleaning of the box or refused when
offered by the male.
When the females emerged, their fine appearances gave every impress-
ion of a complete moult. Millar (1921) found that B. bucinator used
feathers to line the nest, while Cowles (1926) found feathers dropped
from the nest. While the NA and SA females were in their boxes, occasional
body, flight or tail feathers were found below. Examination of the SA nest-
box after emergence produced many body, flight and tail feathers, some
incorporated into the nest. Moreau (1937) quotes Pitman as finding a
B. subcylindricus nest with a naked nestling and a flightless female with
primaries all growing in.
During the long period inside the box the female and later her young
were seen to defaecate with their posterior to the small hole. In the more
inaccessible south aviary a faecal pile 15 cm deep developed about 1 m from
the box, with the maximum distance being 2.4 m.
In early June, what were presumed to have been faecal sacs from the
young were seen being passed by the female to the male, which he then
dropped. Sticks and wood shavings were also found beneath the nestbox.
On examination of the box after the emergence of the birds there was al-
most no faecal material and under the surface nest the wood shavings
appeared unused.
Emergence
On 27th August and 17th September, after a confinement of 112 days
and 122 days respectively, the SA and NA females broke out of their
boxes. On the day prior to emergence the SA male was seen chipping at
the clay and two birds were heard calling from inside. On the actual day
of emergence, the male became aggressive toward the keeper when he
entered the aviary. The SA female was seen removing clay and was out by
8.40 a.m. The first young, a male, emerged by 9.50 a.m. and the second, a
female, by 12.00 noon. All three birds flew well, although both young
appeared nervous at first but calmed down after a few hours. The NA fe-
male and her young, a male, were out by 7 a.m.
In wild B. cristatuSy the birds emerged between 7 and 9 a.m. The fe-
male took an hour to remove plaster and then she and the male encouraged
the young to leave. The female in this case was described as being "shabby
and weak" on emergence (Moreau and Moreau, 1941). All the B. subcylin-
dricus females at the Metro Toronto Zoo appeared in good condition after
emergence, which concurs with the observations of Porritt and Riley
(1976).

All the young were almost the size of the parents (Table I). Their sex
was easily discernible with the males having the characteristic large casque.
The shape was different from the adult male casque (see photograph) and
blood lines could be seen in the transparent white part of the casque.
The day following emergence the SA pair were both seen feeding the
young, although the young were slow to accept food from the male. In
the following days the young were vocalising along with the adult male
and moving with confidence around the aviary. The first sighting of a
young eating on its own occurred on 7th November, 72 days after emer-
gence. One hundred and one days after emerging, the adult male was seen
chasing and harrassing the juvenile male with both vocalising. No food was
eaten that day. Two days later the young pair were removed.
The NA male was aggressive at feeding times for several days following
emergence. The young was only being fed by the parents until 1st Novem-
ber, 45 days after emergence, when it began to feed on its own. At 139
days after emergence the adult male was seen harrassing the juvenile male
so the young bird was removed.
At Birdworld, B. subcylindricus young rejected the adult male's attempts
to feed them (Porritt and Riley, 1976). He fed the female who then fed
the young. The young in that case were seen eating independently after
approximately 40 days.
Following their removal from the breeding pairs, the juvenile NA male
was placed with the juvenile SA female in an off-display, bird-breeding
unit with the eventual hope of a first generation breeding.
Summary
The successful breedings that have occurred here at the Metro Toronto
Zoo and at Birdworld (Porritt and Riley, 1976) have occurred in a variety
of aviaries. The smallest aviary at Birdworld measured 4.6 m x 5.5 m x
2.4 m high, which was smaller than the African Pavilion aviaries but larger
than the one at the holding barn.
The availability of a suitable nestbox (filled with wood shavings), clay
and diet were instrumental in the breeding of these hornbills. In both the
north and south aviaries the nestboxes were the highest perching points,
and offered the animals security. The wood shavings were adjusted by the
hornbills to the level they desired. A supply of moist river clay was always
available once courtship commenced and the diet was adjusted according
to their needs. Although the maintenance diet consisted primarily of
fruits (70%), it became necessary to increase the amount and proportion
of animal protein during the period of confinement. At these times the

amount of animal protein consumed doubled and represented up to 45%
of the total intake. When the female and young emerged the consumption
of animal protein dropped to 37% of the total. The consumption of fruit
at that time remained the same and the overall increase in food consump-
tion was accounted for by the increase in the number of birds.
The two pairs of hornbills in the African Pavilion nested at a different
time from the pair in the bam. The dates and times of the significant
reproductive events for the Metro Toronto Zoo and Birdworld pairs
are tabulated and compared in Table II. From the information in this
table it appears that the majority of pairs sealed up in May and emerged
during late August or early September, after 112-123 days of confinement.
Early emergency from the nest cavity has been reported frequently.
Porritt and Riley (1976) mention captive B. subcylindricus breaking out
after only seven days in 1973 with successful seasons in 1972 and 1974.
Moreau and Moreau (1941) cite a pair of B. crista tus, in four consecutive
seasons, breaking out from 20 to 86 days after sealing up, but successful
seasons followed. No apparent causes were mentioned. The Metro Toronto
Zoo holding barn pair had two unsuccessful seasons. In 1976 the female
emerged after 104 days, leaving two eggs. The eggs were dull white with a
pitted surface, measured 49.3 mm x 37.4 mm and contained rotting
embryos, one-third developed. In 1977 the same female emerged after 114
days with neither eggs nor young. However, in neither year were shavings
used. Seal up is obviously no guarantee of success.
According to the International Zoo Yearbook, Birdworld at Farnham
in England, Wassenaar Zoo in Holland, Berlin Zoo in West Germany and
the Jurong Bird Park in Singapore have all bred Bycanistes subcylindricus
but the subspecies was not specified.
During the writing of this paper, both the NA and the SA pairs again
started to nest. As of May 1981, both females were sealed into their boxes.

NOTES ON VIOLET-EARED HUMMING BIRDS
THE GENUS COLIBRI
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.9753765" page_id="56284420"  page_num="26" year="" vol="">
By R.J. ELGAR (Manchester)
The genus Colibri consists of medium to large humming birds ranging
from Mexico through Central America to the northern third of South
America. One member, the Brown Violet-eared Humming Bird Colibri del-
phinae is found on the Caribbean island of Trinidad.
The genus contains four species, three of which are mainly shining green
in colour and one - C. delphinae - is various shades of brown. Both male
and female of all members of the genus have elongated ear-coverts of
metallic violet purple, hence the common name of Violet-ear.
Brown Violet-eared Humming Bird Colibri delphinae
Distribution
Tropical to subtropical zones to an altitude 8,500 feet in Central
America from Guatemala to Panama and south to Peru, Bolivia, Colombia,
Venezuela, Guianas and in the Brazilian states of Roraima and Bahia, also
the island of Trinidad, preferring open woodland, shrubbery, coffee and
banana plantations, roadsides and gardens, feeding from ground level to a
height of 40 ft. When resting it prefers to perch high in a tree and will spend
periods of the day hawking insects from the same high perch. It usually
nests quite low, at 4-5 ft., making a small cup-shaped nest on a bare twig
in some shady place.
Description
It is a medium sized humming bird, some 4 Vi inches in length. The
upper plumage is grey-brown to olive with a bronze gloss, upper tad-
coverts at the base are black, rump and tips of upper tail-coverts
cinnamon-buff. The tail is greenish olive with subterminal coppery purple
band and tipped buff. Underparts are dull greyish-brown, some feathers
have paler edges that form indefinite streaks; elongated ear-coverts glit-
tering violet purple; centre of throat glittering green changing to glitter-
ing blue on lower throat.
Over the past twenty years I have owned several of this species. They
are long lived and robust birds, ideal for cages or communal humming bird
flights although males in breeding condition can prove to be rather aggres-
sive with small species. This species has been bred in captivity in West
Germany in recent years. At present I have one female in my collection

Green Violet-eared Humming Bird Colibri thalassinus
Distribution
Sub-tropical to temperate zones to an altitude of 9,500 ft in Mexico,
Panama, through Colombia, Ecuador and Venezuela, north of the River
Orinoco, eastern Peru, Bolivia to north-west Argentina. It prefers the open
mountain slopes, feeding in areas where the partial removal of mature
woodland has occurred and secondary growth has started. It feeds on the
flowers of terrestrial bromeliads and shrubs up to tree-tops.

Over the past twenty years I have owned several of this species but in
recent years a female that I acquired in 1973 has been most interesting.
She has nested on numerous occasions, in 1977 rearing a hybrid to a male
Colibri delphinae, in 1979 rearing a further youngster to a male Colibri
coruscans , and in 1980 having two nests to a male of her own species but
failing to rear the young to maturity. Over a period of five years she has
hatched twelve chicks, rearing two to maturity.
Sparkling Violet-eared Humming Bird Colibri coruscans
Distribution
Subtropical to arid temperate zones to an altitude of 9,500 ft in Col-
ombia, Venezuela, Ecuador to Peru, Bolivia and north-west Argentina.
A highly territorial and vocal humming bird, preferring open areas of
cloud and rain forests, plantations, open terrain with scattered trees, feed-
ing at all levels from ground bromeliads to tree tops.
C. coruscans is a large humming bird, 5 l /i inches long, with all upper
plumage shining green, and chin, throat, cheek and lengthened ear-coverts
purple-blue. Lower throat and breast are glittering emerald green, the
breast and throat feathers have dark centres giving a scaled appearance;
flanks and belly are shining green, central tail feathers shining blue-green,
the rest dark green with subterminal deep purplish blue band slightly
forked. Females are slightly smaller, have a more curved bill, and a white
ocular spot. C. coruscans is a species that is well suited to aviculture being
robust and long lived. It was first bred in Britain by Mrs. Scamell in 1967.
In recent years it has been bred on a number of occasions on the Con-
tinent. In 1980 a pair owned by Mr. K. Dewell managed to rear several
young and a pair in my collection reared two females in the latter part of
1980, plus one male in January 1981. At the time of writing there has
been several nestings from another female in my collection but at present
no more have been reared.
Display and breeding cycle of C. coruscans
As in the wild, C. coruscans is a highly vocal and territorial humming
bird and once moulted will sing and display almost continuously through-
out the day. The male's display can loosely be divided into three phases:
1. Male perches on prominent perch in his territory, utters short
bursts of song interrupting this with his advertising call. He will
then vibrate his wings vigorously at an angle of 90 Q . At the same
time he moves his head from side to side watching for any female
to approach his territory at the same time leaning slightly back-

wards to show a violet patch on his breast; ear patches are ex-
tended.
2. He will fly vertically with a slow floating wing beat, swaying
from side to side. The height to which he will soar is determined
by the height of the enclosure. In the wild they can go as high as 60
ft. then slowly descend to their original perch. This will be re-
peated several times until a female is attracted to his area.
3. The male will then fly to the female and hover in front of her
with his bill pressed into the female's lower breast or vent area,
swinging his body from side to side, his ear patches extended and
singing continuously. When the female takes up a crouching posi-
tion, he will then fly over her with bill pressed in her nape still
using his swinging flight to prevent the female from departing; cop-
ulation then takes place.

Nest Construction
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.993973739130435" page_id="56284424"  page_num="30" year="" vol="">
As with all female birds (as far as we know) they build and complete
the nest without any help from the male. When a female wants to nest, she
becomes hyperactive, spending portions of the day nest-building. This is
done with great determination and they seem oblivious to other birds in
the area, also ignoring any humming birds in the vicinity of the nest. The
nest is usually completed in five or six days.
My female Colibri usually construct their nests of cotton wool and
dried sphagnum moss bound with fresh spiders' webs. A female C thal-
assinus used to attach small pieces of dark brown moss to the outside of
the nest. The nests are constructed at heights varying from 18 inches to 6
feet, the majority being between 5 and 6 feet, in plants of Synogonium
vellozaianum, Philodendron scandens, Nephrolepsis spp., Hoy a camosa
and Gssus antarctica.
In captivity it is difficult to draw any conclusions from this because of
the limited dimensions of the flight and nesting sites available. Along
with nesting activity the female will make her condition known to the
male by flying over him, almost touching him while he is singing, plus
going through a milder display, then perching within a few feet ready to
be mated.
Egg-laying and incubation
The female when laying her eggs, perches on the rim of the nest with
bill pointing outwards and the tail resting on the rim behind her so the
vent is above the cup of the nest. After laying the egg, she will usually fly

off. In young and mature females there is a space of one day before the
second egg is laid, but as a female becomes older there may be a gap of
two days. On some occasions, only one egg may be laid. The eggs are
usually laid within an hour or so of daybreak. Incubation starts after the
second egg has been laid but the female sleeps on the first egg throughout
the night. Incubation lasts for 15 to 16 days.
I made the following notes in 1980 about the hatching and develop-
ment of two Colibri coruscans chicks:

She was housed in a flight measuring 8 ft x 2 ft x 6 ft high and had access
to the male through the open door of the flight.
18th October - female laid second egg. The male was removed from the
vicinity of her flight.
23rd October - I examined the eggs and both were fertile. The female
was incubating well, leaving the nest approximately every thirty minutes
to feed and gather more cobwebs for the nest. These trips lasted only a
few minutes.
1st November - In the morning there was a small amount of eggshell on
the floor of the flight, the first chick had hatched.
2nd November - In the morning there were no signs of the second egg

egg was just hatching. The chick seemed very weak and still had part of the
eggshell covering its head which I removed, using a small stem of a leaf.

for food, she displayed to them using phase No. 3 of the male's display.
25th November - I was very concerned for the safety of the young so I
removed them to a small stock cage with several nectar tubes. Within an
hour both young were feeding themselves.
At present I have two females and one male Colibri coruscans which
were imported from Colombia in March 1976. Both females have nested
but only one has reared any young to maturity, to date two females in the
first nest plus a male in January 1981. The other female has hatched young
but they have failed to live more than fifteen days. Colibri coruscans can
prove to be extremely aggressive in a mixed flight when established so care
must be taken when housing them. Once the female is incubating the eggs,
it is wise to remove the male so that the female can tend the nest in peace.
Once the young have hatched, large numbers of fruit flies are required, es-
pecially for the first eight days.

A medium-sized humming bird, some inches in length. The upper
plumage is shining green, the underparts glittering green. The chest is
shining green, the centre of the feathers darker green giving a spangled
effect, upper chest shining turquoise, lengthened ear-coverts metallic
purple, rest of underplumage grey-green and under tail-coverts pure white.
I have never observed a living member of this species. Mr. P.H.Hastings
imported several into Britain many years ago, also several have appeared
on the Continent in recent years. I have a male Colibri coruscans x C.

NOTE ON THE SUCCESSFUL BREEDING OF THE DALMATIAN
PELICAN Pelecanus crispus

The International Zoo Yearbook reports only one breeding success of
a captive Dalmatian Pelican, at the Nuremberg Zoo in 1976, with no
accompanying details on either the conditions or outcome. Neither
Crivelli (1981), nor Kramer (1980), nor Klos (1966) mentions a successful
breeding of this species, though the latter points out a case of cross-
breeding at the Berlin Zoo (P. crispus x P. rufescens).
In 1969 and 1971, six Dalmatian Pelicans were bought by Villars-les-
Dombes Park. They are pinioned and kept on a lake, which measures
roughly one and a quarter acres, together with two White Pelicans, four
Pink-backed Pelicans (brought there in 1979), four Cormorants and
various other waterfowl. White Storks live on the pond banks. An anti-
freeze device maintains an ice-free area of 200 square metres during severe
cold as these birds live out all the winter.
They are fed every morning and the meal consists of large fish such as
mackerel and roach; the daily average quantity is about one kilogram per

bird. Since 1978, polyvitamin capsules have been inserted into the fish in
winter.
In 1976, a circular island 25 metres square was created in the centre of
the pond and it is now covered with trees. Materials such as rushes, small
twigs, etc., are left there in abundance. The nests are built along the
edge of the island and consist of a large collection of branches, shaped like
a cone and measuring one metre in diameter at the base, half a metre in
diameter at the top and more than one metre in height. The inside is
lined with grass.
The first clutch was observed on 6th June 1979, the second one on
15th February, 1980. The eggs vanished after a few days' incubation.
In 1981, two eggs were laid on 17th March. A chick hatched on 26th
April and was found dead the day after. A cold spell accompanied by
snowfalls probably caused its death.
On 15th May, two nests had two eggs each; three chicks hatched on
22nd June; the chick which was alone on a nest died at once. After
hatching, the adults took turns on the nest until 20th July when they left
the chicks by themselves for half an hour for the first time. Having found
no published records of the chicks' diet, we placed very small fish near the
nest for three weeks. The adult on the nest never took any, unlike the
other birds on the pond.

The first departure from the breeding site, on 4th August, was pro-
voked by us approaching the nest to take some pictures of the chicks.
They were then 43 days old. They kept swimming for an hour and got
back to the island. They did not leave of then own accord and regularly
until 15th August.
The chicks were usually fed after fish distribution although feeding
by the parents was occasionally observed before. They continued on into
November even though the chicks fed by themselves on some days.
little aggressiveness is shown by adults in their territorial behaviour:
the two nests were in contact and within three metres of a Cormorant nest
where two chicks were bred at the same tune.
Both young pelicans were ringed on 24th August (63 days old). At this
age the primaries were nearly fully developed, some down was left on the
head, back and belly and the iris was grey. The distinctly curved bills were
respectively 210 and 280 millimetres long, and the wings 445 and 520
millimetres long.

We tend to think of glasshouse aviaries as tropical houses but there is a
wealth of plants and birds which do not require high temperatures. We can
easily create environments from the just 'frost free' to the hot, humid con-
ditions of a tropical rain forest. It is with these considerations to the fore
that I title this article as above.
Let us consider the type of structure that is best for our purpose and
the siting of the building. The site chosen should be an open one but shel-
tered from winds. The provision of wind shelter will greatly reduce heating
costs and is, therefore, of greater importance when warm regimes are the
requirement. This type of aviary is essentially of "walk-in" design so we
can consider solid side walls and a translucent roof. The loss of illumina-
tion by only having a light transmitting roof is not a serious loss from the
horticultural point of view when one does not require maximum growth
as is essential in a commercial glasshouse. In these days of ever escalating
fuel costs, cavity walls built in concrete or lightweight blocks and rendered
will be the preferred method of wall construction. A wall of this type will
have a heat loss of well under a third of that of single glass and if the cav-
ity is filled with insulating material, still greater heat savings may be
achieved. A double glazed roof has half the heat loss of single glazing and
is usually an economic necessity especially where warm regimes are con-
templated. Roofs of corrugated plastic, while cheap to construct, have a
greater heat loss than flat cladding because their surface area is greater, by
reason of their corrugations, than the area covered. They are also more
difficult to seal in an efficient manner at both eaves and ridge.
There are now available double skin plastics. The well-known Correx is
a forerunner of this type of material and this is an ideal material for
double glazing under glass cladding or, for that matter, under a corrugated
roof.
One greenhouse manufacturer at least is now employing a stronger and
more durable plastic of double skin construction for cladding glasshouses.
As this material is flexible, curvilinear roofs can be constructed. Using two
skins of these new products gives a roof with a very low heat transmission.
This material is available for the home constructor.
Ventilation can be automated with benefit. The standard type of venti-
lator can be obtained with electric motors arranged to open the ventilators

an appropriate amount. In small structures, there are types designed for
the amateur's glasshouse which, on this scale of operation, are an efficient
method. A greatly more efficient method of ventilation is to use louvres
and fans. With this type of ventilation we have the opportunity of cooling
the incoming air by the use of water soaked pads. Fans and their associated
inlet louvres are available for virtually any size of house and proper horti-
cultural types only should be employed.
Heating systems must be designed to respond quickly to demand and
be capable of being accurately controlled. Thermostats should preferably
be of the electronic type and be housed in an aspirated screen to give true
readings. An accurate instrument rapidly repays the extra initial cost as
only ^ degree or so higher than that required increases costs by a surprising
amount. Tables are available for all areas showing the likely heat input re-
quired and should be consulted to determine maximum heat input needed.
It may be useful here to consider the input and, therefore, costs which
apply in my own area of southern England. From a basic 45*F (5.6*[euro])
minimum the cost will be doubled on increasing our thermostat to 50*F
(10*C), To maintain 55*F (12.8*C) the heat requirement is slightly more
than trebled while an increase to 60*F (15.6*C) will cost five times as
much. Should we require a temperature of 70*C (ll.l*C) to be main-
tained, we can expect our fuel costs to be eight times that of a 45 *F
(5.6*C) regime. Of course, these figures are only a guide and are affec-
ted by the severity of the winter and the situation of the building.
Before any construction is started, a schedule of all requirements
should be made. A study of the various types of commercial structures and
environmental control systems should be undertaken. If you instruct a
glasshouse manufacturer to carry out the work, the different requirements
to those which he is used to in commercial glasshouse design must be made
plain.
The success of this type of aviary is dependent on satisfactory growth
of the plants and a low enough rate of stocking to ensure rapid recycling
of waste products. The cooler the temperature, the slower will this break-
down occur and as the water requirements will also be lower, some cleaning
may be necessary under favoured perches. Where there are pools and
streams avoid perches over them unless, as atBirdland Bourton-on-the
Water, water is not recirculated and any droppings are continuously
carried away.
Our next consideration is the growing medium of the plants. We have a
choice of a paved floor with all plants in containers or the plants may be
grown in the soil floor of the house. Growing in containers is a straight-

forward operation but feeding and watering is more time-consuming than
when the plants are grown in the soil of the house.
Where the plants are to be planted out, the subsoil must first be investi-
gated. Drainage must be good and where there is the slightest doubt about
this, adequate provision must be made to dispose of drainage water. More
plants are killed by overwatering and stagnant soil conditions than by any
other cause. If there is any doubt, excavate to 20 inches (50 cms) and lay
10 inches of rubble. If necessary, first lay field drains to prevent the exca-
vation becoming a sump. If the area was under grass before building, the
turves can be laid, grass side downwards, over the rubble; otherwise it
should be 'blinded 5 by a layer of 3 A inch stone. When excavating ensure that
the topsoil is kept in a separate heap from the subsoil which may be dis-
carded.
The topsoil should have generous additions of peat, composted bark
fibre or leafmould and, if necessary, an appropriate amount of coarse gritty
sand. Also incorporate a slow action base fertiliser and where necessary an
appropriate amount of ground chalk (calcium carbonate). A suitable base
</bodyText>
<footnote confidence="0.7914455">
fertiliser is John Innes Base which can be purchased or made from:
2 parts hoof and horn, 1/8 inch grist
2 parts of 18% superphosphate of lime
1 part sulphate of potash
</footnote>
<bodyText confidence="0.844798631578947" page_id="56284432"  page_num="38" year="" vol="">
About 4 oz per square yard would be appropriate and about 1 l A oz of
ground chalk. This latter will, of course, be omitted if the ground is natu-
rally calcareous or if lime-hating plants are to be grown. Fritted trace ele-
ments are usually of great benefit and should be used according to the
manufacturer's instructions.
Where boggy conditions are required, the proportion of peat, leaf-
mould, etc., should be increased to at least 75% of the total. Conversely,
where a more arid environment is required, crushed stone should be a
major constituent of the compost.
It must always be our aim to promote healthy growth of plants and ob-
tain a vigorous thrusting root-system to break down and recycle all waste
products. This will be found difficult where dry conditions must be main-
tained and here easily removable surface dressings must be used.
To conclude, let us turn our attention to plants. In Britain today the
plants available from nurserymen are few compared with those offered
before World War II. However Cornish nurseries offer many plants which
need cool conditions and seed of South African and Australian species are
fairly easily come by. Seedsmen in the warmer American States can also
be an interesting source. Some of the smaller British seedsmen offer inter-

NOTES ON THE BIRDS IN SOME LONDON PARKS

By BRIAN HILL (Yeovil, Somerset)
Bird-watchers in London are not deprived of their hobby because they
live in a built-up environment. On the contrary, a comparative analysis of
breeding birds seen around Barnet and the nearby outer fringes of suburbia
in Hertfordshire and those recorded regularly in Somerset revealed that
ninety percent could be seen in London parks. From this, I conclude that
it is habitat which determines which species are to be seen, and London's
bird population does not seem to object to traffic noise and pollution be-
cause of the great variety of habitat to be found in the capital. The variety
of birds is, in fact, greater than for a comparable area elsewhere in the
country.
My article is intended to encourage appreciation of the London Parks
as examples of "aviculture without confinement", because, since the time
of W.H. Hudson, their management for public recreation has paid especial
attention to the welfare of the birds, and the birds are much tamer than
their country cousins.
The parks I am going to report on specifically are the Inner or Central
parks, i.e. St. James's, Hyde Park, Kensington Gardens, and Green Park,
and the Outer parks - Richmond, Osterley and Bushey Parks. The former
are typical municipal parks, that is, open spaces, short grass, formal shrub-
beries and isolated trees, with a proportion of exotic species. There are
formal flower beds and usually an artificial lake with concrete margins.

B. HILL - BIRDS IN LONDON PARKS
These contrast with the Outer parks which, in addition to similar habitat
to the Inner Parks have pasture with occasional trees, grazed by herds of
cattle or deer, and in some cases, arable farmland. Their waters also have
more natural margins and assorted vegetation.
Richmond Park is a good example of the Outer parks. It has semi-
natural vegetation and two important factors determining the appearance
and vegetation are: (i) acidic, gravelly and sandy soils, and (ii) heavy graz-
ing by deer. The former gives rise to extensive areas of Bracken and other
vegetation characteristic of the soils, resulting in a scarcity of many native
shrubs which require a calcareous soil, e.g. Dogwood, Spindle, Privet and
many berry-bearing plants are not available to birds, although Hawthorn is
around in small numbers and some Bramble is in the fenced-off areas
There is a lot of Laurel and Rhododendron which provides cover and
roosting for birds but not food. Many Oaks are old and hollow which pro-
vide acorns, caterpillars, nesting holes and the fissured bark full of insects
offering hospitality to many species, e.g. Treecreeper, Nuthatch, owls,
woodpeckers, Pheasant and Jay.
This park has not altered much since I have known it - about thirty
years - and this is due to the intense grazing by deer, because no regenera-
tion of woodland goes on, apart from in the fenced-off areas. In the Isa-
bella Plantation - open woodland with standard trees, particularly mature
Birches - the birds are regularly fed by visitors, so are very tame. Blue Tits,
Great Tits, Coal Tits all come to the hand of strangers. Nuthatch, Song
Thrush, Dunnock, Blackbird, House Sparrow, feral pigeon will all come
flocking for food. In this woodland garden there is a pond with some water-
fowl, e.g. Mallard, Coot and Moorhen.
The Pen Ponds consist of two shallow lakes, with extensive marsh and
reedbed at one end, which is a fenced-off sanctuary, and having islands in
the centre for birds; e.g. Tufted Duck, Mallard and Teal. The birds are fed
by visitors and are mostly tame. There are flocks of migrating birds in
spring and autumn and many wild birds winter on the ponds.
"Bird Life in the Royal Parks Report for 1971-72" mentions that in
the Inner parks as many species in the course of a year are recorded as in
the Outer parks, thus:
</bodyText>
<reference confidence="0.810712666666667">
Hyde Park, Kensington Gardens 88 species
Osterley Park, Bushey Park 87 species
However, the number of breeding species is higher, thus:
Hyde Park, Kensington Gardens 32 species
Osterley Park, Bushey Park 48 and 47 species
respectively.

This indicates that habitat is encouraging more breeding because there is
a wider range of habitats in the Outer parks.
The Inner parks have less shrubbery (except in sanctuary areas) and
when it is present is likely to be evergreen and exotic species. The most
notable exceptions to this are the woodland areas of Holland Park where
conditions are almost ideal in their attraction to a wide range of arboreal
species, i.e. mature trees, frequent glades, well-developed shrub layers,
dense growth of Brambles and rank growth of grasses, thistles, Nettles,
Willowherb, etc.
It is relevant to recall that W.H. Hudson (1898) drew attention to the
effect expansion and the destruction of natural vegetation was having on
London's bird population. In 1922 the Committee on Bird Sanctuaries in
the Royal Parks was established and the advice of the first commission was
to set up areas to be regarded as bird sanctuaries in which the vegetation,
particularly the undergrowth, could be left untrampled, and in more or
less a natural state. In the Inner parks these attempts to conserve the
dwindling numbers of less adaptable birds were only partially successful,
and a shortage of insect food was probably one of the reasons why some
species were never able to re-establish themselves. However, the report
recommended that the term 'Bird Sanctuary' should not be interpreted in
its narrowest sense; i.e. a neglected area allowed to become a thicket. It is
necessary to retain a suitable habitat in terms of vegetational structure and
species composition. Pruning and thinning-out is necessary to ensure
correct plants are grown, thereby providing food and nesting habitat and
sites.
Successional changes in the vegetation can in time so alter the habitat
that it loses its attractiveness.
Many of the species of birds which are regularly to be observed in
London's parks are dealt with in the following notes:
Great Crested Grebe Podiceps cristatus
Only the larger lakes can support this bird for breeding purposes. It has
nested in Regents Park and Hyde Park for the first time for many years.
The provision of specially protected areas on the lakes is thought to have
been of key importance for this and the Heron. However, colonisation of
the Central parks could well be due to "overspill" from the waters of the
outer suburbs; i.e. the gravel pits and certain reservoirs. A cursory analysis
of the productivity (in terms of number of young reared to fledgling stage
per pair) for Osterley Park (data supplied by D.G. Harris) would seem to
support this idea. The figures for many years from 1955-80 showed the

productivity was no greater, and on the whole much less, when there were
more than two pairs. In some instances it was evident that quarrelling
between adjacent pairs upset their breeding.
Little Grebe Podiceps ruficollis
It was only recorded as a bird of passage in 1975 in the Inner parks. I
think it could become a breeding species in St. James's Park, although the
margins of the lake may not be suitable for it. The nest is anchored to
partly submerged vegetation, so if there were algae and small areas of reed
on the lake margins, it could encourage the Little Grebe to nest. In Rich-
mond Park the habitat would appear very suitable, but examination of the
reports shows that, although it is regularly observed, it has had irregular
breeding successes there. The most recent record of nesting was in 1973
(until 1977 when published records ceased) but the success or otherwise
was not recorded. In 1955-56 chicks were hatched but none fledged. The
record seems to point to antagonistic or predatory species as the cause of
failure to rear the chicks. It has been recorded that Pike in the large ponds
(Pen Ponds) take ducklings of Tufted Duck, so possibly they are respon-
sible for taking Little Grebe chicks.
Cormorant Phalacrocorax carbo
It is a visitor to all the larger waters of the London Parks and also to res-
ervoirs and the River Thames. See "Wildlife in the Royal Parks" for an
account of the history of the pinioned birds in St. James's Park.
Heron Ardea cinerea
It is to be seen either regularly or occasionally on all the waters of the
London parks. The story of its decline as a nesting species in Richmond
Park and its establishment in Regent's Park is most interesting. A heronry
existed for many years in Sidmouth Wood, Richmond, which rapidly
declined during the 1950's and was abandoned by the early 1960's. Crows
were taking advantage of the disturbance caused by people passing, as the
Herons would fly off the nest, and the Carrion Crows take their eggs.
The establishment of a heronry in Regent's Park in 1972 is all the more
remarkable because this park has far more visitors and they are closer to
the colony. The birds have evidently become accustomed to the almost
continuous passage of people. By 1976 there were eight pairs.
Mallard Anas platyrhynchos
In 1955-56 in Richmond Park the report mentions the very high mor-

tality of ducklings. Twenty-one nests had approximately one hundred and
eighty eggs but very few survived. Again, Pike are suspected of being the
most serious predator. D.G. Harris (personal comment) is of the opinion
that most broods do not survive for long at Osterley Park for the same
reason.
Tufted Duck and Pochard typically nest much closer to water than
Mallard - which very often nest hundreds of yards from water. For nesting
purposes they therefore have a requirement for marginal cover or ground
close to water free from disturbance and predators. These requirements are
met by the provision of sanctuary areas about the Serpentine, Duck Island
in St. James's Park, the islands and sanctuary area of Regent's Park lake,
and the more extensive areas of reed bed and islands in the lakes of Rich-
mond Park.
Canada Goose Branta canadensis
My interpretation of the data which I extracted from some of the "Bird
Life in the Royal Parks" reports is as follows:
Small numbers of introduced pinioned pairs (less than five pairs) bred
in the Central parks and in the grounds of Buckingham Palace for many
decades. Pinioned birds, occasionally breeding, have been part of the col-
lection of Buckingham Palace grounds for many years. However, the intro-
duction of full-winged birds (from the Midlands) to the Serpentine dates
from 1955. By the mid-1960's nesting in small numbers (less than five
pairs) was established by full-winged birds by the Serpentine and St.
James's Park. In addition, many more birds flying in from further afield
in the Thames Valley used the Serpentine for roosting (peak count of 85
in 1965). In the Outer parks, the species occurred only outside the breed-
ing season and rarely exceeded ten birds. This situation continued up to
1975 but breeding in the Central parks was then controlled by the park
authorities. Nesting in the Outer parks (Richmond and Bushey) was estab-
lished in 1976 and numbers out of breeding season at Osterley Park had in-
creased to a peak of seventeen. The data recorded for 1977 show nesting
at Richmond and Bushey recurring at 1-2 pairs but otherwise flocks of 10-
20 birds on the waters, whilst Osterley gained the first nesting pair, an
out of season peak of 25.
Data supplied by D.G. Harris show the subsequent increase at Osterley

B. HILL - BIRDS IN LONDON PARKS
If the increase of this bird in the Thames Valley has been documented
and any studies made of the interchange of birds from this wider area,
with those of the parks, it would put these notes in perspective.
For reasons which have not been specified in the official reports, the
further increase of this bird is viewed with disfavour by some. If there are
good reasons for this, and culling or control measures become necessary,
then they ought to be explained to the public.
The sight of a flock of geese at close range in flight above the Serpen-
tine is a marvellous experience for a provincial bird-watcher like myself.
With reasoned culling, done in an orderly manner, the birds could be
offered for sale "oven-ready"! The Canada Goose is, of course, an intro-
duced species, but truly native species of waterfowl may be seen as pin-
ioned birds in the parks. These evidently attract wild species of duck to
stay during winter.
Sparrow Hawk Accipiter nisus
In the 1950's it was a regular nester in the Outer parks and even nested
in Greenwich Park up until 1955. By the early 1960's, however, it had
ceased to nest even in the Outer parks and its occurrence was becoming
increasingly irregular. By 1976 it was not visiting even the Outer London
parks. In 1977, when I spent several months living in Barnet, I frequently
saw Kestrel over open spaces in that area (and Mill Hill and Hendon) but
I only once recorded Sparrow Hawk. However, I can find reason to be
hopeful for the species, for during the late 1970's I have witnessed a resur-
gence of Sparrow Hawk in Somerset and Dorset.
Kestrel Falco tinnunculus
In the Outer London parks this bird is frequently to be seen and all
parks carry nesting pairs. It has been observed regularly in the Inner Lon-
don parks but only in 1974 bred, in Regent's Park. Every year since, it has
increased and established itself as a nesting bird in Central London. I think
it must have made behavioural adaptations.
Partridge Perdix perdix
Coveys are readily observed in Bushey Park. In many of the Outer
parks are preserved areas of rough grassland grazed by deer and I am sure
this is the reason for maintaining the Partridge. The bird is local in Somer-
set. Where it does occur on arable areas, it is because the field headlands
retain long ungrazed grass required for nesting and feeding the chicks. Its
main stronghold is on the Somerset Levels where much of the grassland is

down to hay; elsewhere short term leys, often restricted to one or two
dominant species of grass, are quite unsuitable for it
Common Pheasant Phasianus colchicus
Nesting in all the Outer parks and the Queen's Cottage woodland in
Kew Gardens is a particularly good place to see the cock birds come out of
the undergrowth for hand-outs. The Central parks would not seem to have
sufficient cover, but perhaps the species has not been introduced there.
W.H. Hudson would be cheered if he knew that the Pheasant has con-
tinued to nest in Kew Gardens. In his book (1898), he was predicting that,
with increasing disturbance of the Queen's grounds in Kew Gardens, the
Pheasant would disappear there but, in fact, that delightful bit of wood-
land is one of the best parts I know to get close-up views of Pheasant.
They will emerge from the undergrowth and accept scraps of food thrown
out for them, and the birds nest in all the Outer parks.
Red-legged Partridge Alectoris rufa
More easily observable than the Grey Partridge and can be seen occas-
ionally at Osterley Park. I have also seen them on arable land in the Mill
Hill area.
Water Rail Rallus aquaticus
A regular in the Outer parks, especially in Pen Ponds, Richmond Park,
where during my frequent visits in the spring of 1976 I would hear several
calling from reed and marshy beds at the southern edge of the pond. I
think it could occur in Central parks if the lakes had denser marginal vege-
tation. Also, competition from Moorhen may be a deterrent.
Moorhen Gallinula chloropus
Amazing to learn that about a hundred years ago it was unknown in the
London parks (ref. W.H. Hudson) and yet now it is abundant, nesting in
all kinds of situations, e.g. disused Woodpigeon's nests.
Coot Fulica atra
In the mid-1950's it was a recent addition to the list of birds breeding
in Central London, although it had been a winter visitor for several years
previously. In 1898, W.H. Hudson suggested it might become established
if Moorhens were given Coot eggs to hatch, but experiments on these
lines seem to have failed. Since 1926 when a pinioned pair were released

in St. James's Park, which bred successfully, the species have nested regu-
larly. The 1976 report (Birdlife in Royal Parks) shows the Coot as resident
and breeding in all the London Parks except around Ham House and
Greenwich Park. In St. James's Park there were:
8 pairs in 1943 9 pairs in 1944
12 pairs in 1950 28 pairs in 1955
The number of wintering pairs has also increased considerably, over
one hundred may be expected under normal weather conditions, more in
a severe winter. Some birds retain territory throughout the winter.
Lapwing Vanellus vanellus
Nested in Richmond Park in 1955 and 1956 when there was less
bracken than at present and there was, I believe, some ploughed land.
Nests regularly at Osterley Park where there is some arable land.
Common Sandpiper Tringa hypoleucos
Of the several species of wading birds which occur sporadically in the
London Parks which have appreciable areas of water and/or marshy
ground, this is the most widespread, and a regular spring visitor.
Herring Gull Lams argentatus
This bird has increased in the following ways:
Mid-195Q's - a wintering bird in the Central parks in small numbers, by
mid-1960's it was nesting in the Zoological Gardens in Regent's Park, and
nesting had been attempted in St. James's Park or on nearby buildings. So
it is now established as a resident bird in small numbers in Central parks
and a winter visitor in larger numbers in Outer parks. Presumably, because
of the more abundant food supply in the Central parks this species contra-
dicts the usual assumption that the Outer parks are colonised by breeding
birds most readily.
Stock Dove Columba oenas
Feeding very largely on seeds, found on weedy arable land, waste
ground and about stock yards, it is better suited to the Outer parks. Thus
it is to be found in some strength at Osterley Park, where there are arable
fields, in lesser numbers in Richmond and Bushey where there is no arable
land, but many trees offering nest-holes.
What is surprising is to find it nesting, albeit irregularly and in small
numbers, in Central parks such as Hyde Park and Kensington Gardens. It

could become established in the Central parks and this it has done as well
as recovering from low numbers of the mid-1960 5 s in the Outer parks.
Woodpigeon Columba palumbus
Another species which W.H. Hudson would be gratified to know was
now a common, and almost tame bird of the Central parks. Once more, to
a rural bird-watcher, it is a remarkable state of affairs for this wary bird.
Collared Dove Streptopelia decaocto
Established as a nesting species at Osterley Park by 1973 and the 1977
edition of "Bird Life in the Royal Parks' 9 lists it as also nesting in Hamp-

ton Court gardens. It was then listed as present (but not apparently nest-
ing) at Regent's Park.
Bam Owl Tyto alba

<bodyText confidence="0.87401825" page_id="56284441"  page_num="47" year="" vol="">
occasionally has been recorded as doing so at Osterley as well.
Tawny Owl Strix aluco
In the Inner London parks it probably preys more on birds than ro-
dents. It feeds on roosting birds, snatching Sparrows and Starlings easily
in the shrubbery. An analysis of pellets from beneath a tree in Richmond
Park in 1957, when examined, showed the remains not only of Short-
tailed Voles but of several House Sparrows and a Thrush.
Swift Apus apus
Has for many summers been seen in the skies above the capital.
Green Woodpecker Picus viridis
The habitat of the Central parks would seem to be suitable were it not
for the turf being too much trampled and there being too high a level of
disturbance for this invariably very shy species. Its occurrence in the Cen-
tral parks up to the late 1950's, but not thereafter, can presumably be cor-
related with the vastly increased usage of those parks. Meanwhile it con-
tinues as a breeding bird in the Outer parks.

larly on autumn passage and frequently in winter when severe weather
will often result in large numbers appearing in Regent's Park.
Jackdaw Corvus monedula
No longer a nesting bird of the Central parks; by the late 1950's not
even resident in the parks, only recorded on passage. Since this bird is
usually tolerant of man, and it cannot be due to lack of breeding sites -
plenty of large old trees - I wonder if it could be the lack of ploughed
land, and grazing animals? In Yeovil, Jackdaws can often be seen picking
up scraps from the quieter roads, usually detachments from a flock which
nests in an area of parkland close to town, near to farmland. Cattle pro-
vide rich dung fauna, especially beetles which Jackdaws relish (my own
tame Jackdaw does) and so they may be necessary to provide the feeding
grounds lacking in the Central London parks. The nesting Jackdaws of
Kensington Gardens may have survived into the late 1950's from the
days when there were more horses there. The species flourishes in parks
such as Bushey and Richmond which are extensively grazed by deer and/
or sheep.
Tits Pams spp.
A good spot to have the Great, Blue and Coal Tits coming to feed even
from one's outstretched hand is the Isabella Plantation at Richmond Park.
At this marvellous place these birds, along with Dunnock, Nuthatch,
Robin, Blackbird and feral pigeon, especially on frosty winter days, there
is an excited traffic of birds to and from the bushes and the scattered food.
Jays hide and seek a little further away but will also come, especially for
peanuts. The Long-tailed Tit and Marsh Tit, which are respectively the
least adapted to take advantage of food supplied by people, and the most
arboreal, are therefore the least frequent in the Central parks.
Thrushes Turdus spp.
The habitat requirement for the Mistle Thrush Turdus viscivoms are
met in all the parks, i.e. expanses of turf for feeding and large trees for
nesting.
The Blackbird Turdus mem la is very abundant in the London parks and
it is commonplace to have about ten birds foraging in view within one of
the shrubberies during the autumn and winter. It would appear that parks
and suburban gardens are the species' optimum habitat as they supply an
abundance of short turf for providing worms, supplemented by soft fruit,
apples, ivy berries and handouts from the public. Studies by L. Batten

(1973) have shown the species to be more abundant in suburbia than in
farmland or woodland.
When I kept a Blackbird in an aviary with an earth floor, about 24 feet
by 6 feet, it came as a revelation to me to find that, provided the con-
dition of the soil was suitable for the bird to catch enough worms, food I
offered was largely ignored and supplementary feeding was only really
required during periods of frost or sustained drought. I eventually re-
leased the bird because she was pugnacious towards the cock birds I
offered as mates.
Whereas the cover provided by the typical park shrubbery, with an
abundance of evergreens and ground kept clear of weeds suits the Black-
bird admirably, it does not meet the needs of the Song Thrush. This
species prefers rank vegetation - typically a mixture of beds of Nettles,
Willowherb, Bramble clumps and thickets. Where it seeks to hunt on
turf it usually gets chased off by Blackbirds. Hence it is usually reckoned
to be far less common than its congener. However, it is more easily over-
looked when foraging in rank vegetation, and it nests in all the parks.
Whereas Richmond Park has since 1973 regained the Stonechat Saxi-
cola torquata as a nesting species after an interval of many years, it has
lost the Redstart Phoenicurus phoenicurus since the late 1960's. This
appears to be in common with a decline in many parts of the country,
and for such a migratory species this cannot be attributed simply to loss
of habitat in Britain. I find it more as a nesting bird on the central Somer-
set peatlands, with their antique pollarded Willows, rather than on those
mature deer parklands in Somerset and Dorset. Nevertheless, a great loss
for the deerk parks of Richmond and Bushey.
Wheatears Oenanthe oenanthe
Nested in Richmond Park in 1955 but declined since then. There is far
more Bracken nowadays which may be a contributory factor. The Report
mentions that the Bracken was being mechanically crushed in the late
1950's.
Warblers Sylvia spp. and Phylloscopus spp.
It has been claimed (for instance, in the "Bird Life in the Royal Parks"
reports for 1971-74) that a lessening of air pollution in Central London
since the passing of the Clean Air Act in 1956 has been the main reason
for the increasing occurrence and nesting of some of the warblers in the
Central parks. However, the insectivorous Wren Troglodytes troglodytes
and Spotted Flycatcher Muscicapa striata have nested in some of the

Central parks before the restriction on the burning of sooty and smoky
fuels. W.H. Hudson, writing at the turn of the century when, by all
accounts, air pollution was far worse, did not attribute the decrease in
the warblers primarily to pollution. He thought that the tidying up of
the Central parks, which was depriving the birds of their habitat, was the
cause. He found most of the commoner warblers nesting on Hampstead
Heath, which is merely a few miles from the centre. I would assign more
importance to the success which the Committee on Bird Life in the Royal
Parks had on persuading the maintenance staff of the ecological benefits
of allowing more patches of weeds and scrub to develop. If any readers
have any opinions on this matter, I would be glad to hear of them.
Certainly the Outer parks, especially Richmond, where the vegetation
structure and composition has remained little altered formanydecades, the
common warblers have always been well represented.

The Dunnock is usually the little bird which gleans the tiny crumbs left
over after the House Sparrows, Chaffinches, Pigeons and others have taken
the food scattered by visitors. It seldom tackles the larger bits of bread
even when there are no competitors nearby. Seeds form an important part
of the birds' diet for much of the year. Besides those of Nettle and Bramble
which I have seen them take, a wild bird that I had in captivity would
readily take the seeds of Annual Meadow Grass Poa annua, Aquilegia and
Forget-me-not.

The Meadow Pipit has always been recorded as a resident and breeding
bird of Richmond Park and exists also in other open spaces of the metro-
polis which offer expanses of uncut, tussocky grass. In the Central parks
with their clean cut regime it only appears during the winter months and
on passage.
Pied Wagtails Motacilla alba
The increase of the breeding status of the Pied Wagtail may be directly
related to its adoption of urban situations (e.g. factory roofs, sewage
treatment works) for mass roosting, with the birds dispersing to the parks
and open spaces to feed.
Grey Wagtail Motacilla cinerea

nested in recent years in Richmond Park. There has been a national trend
for this species to establish itself about fresh water habitats other than
streams in hilly and mountainous country, with which it is traditionally
associated.
Starling Sturnus vulgaris and House Sparrow Passer domesticus
The Starling continues to be an abundant bird at all times of the year
but apparently has lost its dominant position together with the House
Sparrow during the autumn (Bird Life in the Royal Parks, 1975). There
has been an increase in the numbers of Woodpigeon, Black-headed Gull,
Mallard and Blackbird, which all readily take up food handouts from the
public which would otherwise be taken by the Starlings and House Spar-
rows. Evidently competition from these species resulted in a decrease of
Starlings and House Sparrows. Additionally, Tawny Owls exert a sig-
nificant predatory pressure on House Sparrows especially in the Inner parks.

SOME ASPECTS OF HUMAN AND OTHER PREDATION ON BIRDS
By DEREK GOODWIN (Herne Hill, London)
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999825771428571" page_id="56284446"  page_num="52" year="" vol="">
When discussing the effects of predation on birds or other animals, it
is now usual to consider the numbers of the prey species that are, or are
believed to be, actually killed, and whether this represents more than the
loss of a number that would "have been bound to die anyway" because
the habitat could not support so many of the prey species through the en-
tire year. When this is done, it is often claimed that the resultant figures
show that predation has little or no effect on the numbers of the prey,
which are controlled by the availability of food.
This sometimes appears to be the case even when human predation is
concerned, as Murton (1965) showed for the Wood Pigeon Columha
palumbus in Cambridgeshire. However, in the Wood Pigeon we have a
species for which man's activities both provide food and decrease the
number of its predators and competitors. The situation is different where
man does not persecute the Wood Pigeon's non-human predators (Tornia-
lojc). That human predation can eliminate species even where there is an
abundance of food and (except in relation to human predation) suitable
habitat is clearly shown by the absence of the Wolf and the Wild Boar
from the British countryside, to give but two of very many possible ex-
amples.
It is sometimes assumed that the numbers of a predator must be con-
trolled by those of its prey, never vice versa. This has indeed become al-
most dogma with those who wish to protect creatures formerly regarded
as inimical to man's interests or still so regarded by some. It can be a useful
argument but it is not always wholly and sometimes not even partly true.
Where a predator is entirely or very largely dependent on one species of
prey, then, of course, its fortunes are bound to rise or fall with those of its
prey. For example, the Snail Kite Rosthramus sociahilis feeds, so far as is
known, only on one species of water snail. Obviously if this snail decreases
so must the Snail Kite, unless it can quickly learn to take other prey. On
the other hand, wherever he can do so, man preys on the Common Pheas-
ant Phasianus colchicus, the Peregrine preys on the Rock Pigeon Columba
livia (and its domestic and feral descendants) and the Jay Garrulus glan-
darius takes the nestlings of the Long-tailed Tit Aegithalos caudatus. Yet
not one of these three predators is dependent on the numbers or even the
presence of the prey species cited provided, as is almost everywhere the

case, other foods from the very wide range that they freely take are avail-
able. Yet it is certain that man is often responsible for local extermination
of the Pheasant.
That predators tend to select the most easily caught prey and so are
particularly likely to kill aged, crippled, diseased, weakly and young indi-
viduals is well known and it is widely, and no doubt rightly, held that ex-
cept for the young, the removal of such "unfit" specimens is of benefit
rather than otherwise to the prey species. Oddly enough some of those I
have known who have been most emphatically admiring of such a situa-
tion among other species are among those who would be the loudest to
denounce any suggestion of its application to their own species. Still there
can be no doubt that where a species is largely or entirely free from preda-
tors, its population usually includes proportionately many more defective
individuals than would otherwise be the case and some of them may sur-
vive for a considerable time. Town-living Black Kites Milvus migrans and
feral pigeons and urban man are obvious examples.
Were the "unfit" individuals in such populations to be killed by preda-
tors, it is uncertain whether their places would be taken by "fitter" indi-
viduals, and hence only a temporary decrease in total population caused,
or whether the result would be a permanently smaller but proportionately
healthier population. I think this latter would be more likely in most cases.
But besides the effect, or lack of it, caused by the loss of the individuals
actually killed by predators, there may be side effects of predation and the
consequent fear of the predator which can affect the numbers, distribution
and feeding behaviour of a species, at least within certain areas.
Gullion and Marshall (1968) found that adult Ruffed Grouse Bonasa
umbellus, which live in habitats that provide cover whence Goshawks Acci-
piter gentilis (a species which wealthy hawk enthusiasts have of recent
years introduced, or as some think re-introduced, into Britain on a fairly
large scale) can ambush them, have an expectation of life a third less than
those living in habitats where they cannot be readily ambushed. In this
case the "dangerous" habitat nevertheless suffices to maintain populations
of the prey. It is probable, however, that some habitats that would provide
sufficient food and other necessities for a given species do not and cannot
harbour it because they provide insufficient means for it to escape from
enemies. The elimination of the predator might then alter the situation. In
much of eastern England, where human persecution has virtually wiped
out the larger birds of prey, the Pheasant habitually forages in large open
fields with little or no cover. It is unlikely that it could do so to the same
extent, if at all, if large raptors were.present.

Cade&amp;apos;s studies (1967) show that in parts of Alaska, the Great Grey or
Northern Shrike Lanius excubitor has a "terrific impact" on smaller birds
and renders otherwise ideal breeding habitat only of marginal value for
them. He concludes that this shrike definitely affects the numbers of its
prey.
For the past 23 years I have paid attention to the feeding habits of the
feral pigeons Columba livia , Wood Pigeons and House Sparrows Passer
domesticus near my home in south-east London (Herne Hill). The extent
to which they exploit, or fail to exploit actual or potential feeding sites is
very much influenced by the hunting activities of feral and domestic cats.
In the case of the pigeons (probably also of the House Sparrows) this is
not due to the removal of the relatively few individuals actually caught by
cats but to the fear-induced behavioural changes of those birds which see
a cat suddenly appear from ambush and narrowly escape from it or see a
companion caught. When this happens even in a garden where they have
been feeding daily for months, they sometimes desert the feeding place
permanently, more often desert it for a period of several days or weeks.
When they do return, they show for at least some days afterwards an ex-
treme caution that considerably reduces their feeding efficiency.
The above reactions are those shown when the cat has suddenly dashed
out from its hiding place among plants in a garden, behind the wheel be-
neath a parked vehicle in the road or other such place. That "out of sight,
out of mind" does not apply to the birds in such situations is clearly showm
by the fact that when and if they do return to feed in the "danger area",
they constantly stop to stare nervously, with lifted head, into the gloom
beneath the car or among the shrubs or Michaelmas daisies whence the cat
appeared before. The avian eye (surprisingly) appears even less competent
than the human eye at picking out an immobile cat partly hidden in cover,
or perhaps the very vivid mental impression causes the frightened bird (like
a child or primitive human in comparable circumstances) to conjure up a
"vision" of the dreaded object. At all event one often sees the birds show-
ing obvious fear when looking at an ambush where the human watcher can,
when he gives it careful scrutiny, clearly see that there is not a cat (or any
other predator) lurking.
Despite what is often said by some ignorant nature journalists, birds
that are tame towards humans are not thereby rendered any more vulnera-
ble to non-human predators than are timid individuals. But what I have
found with surprise is that some "tame" individual Wood and feral pigeons
did somehow grasp the fact that I scared the cats away, or at least that cats
did not appear when I was present. Often, at a stage when, owing to a re-

cent fright, such birds would not come down into the garden for food put
out for them, they would at once do so and begin to feed close to me if I
went out and stood near the food, only to fly up again onto the roof or
(Wood Pigeons) a tree, as soon as I went inside the house.
Where any bird species is frequently shot by man, it usually shows con-
siderable fear of him and (unlike where human killing is by means only of
trapping or netting) flees to a distance from him. This means that where
man is abundant and conspicuous, such species are often unable to exploit
places that would provide them with food or else are unable to exploit
them to the same extent as they otherwise could. Everyone who has paid
even casual attention to them (in Britain) knows to what an extent the
Grey Heron Ardea cinerea and the Kingfisher Alcedo atthis are prevented
from feeding, and in the case of the Kingfisher often prevented from feed-
ing their young, by the presence of anglers, ramblers and other people by
the waterside. The popularity of angling and other aquatic and waterside
recreations means that for most of the daylight hours Herons cannot seek
food at weekends or on public holidays on many waters that are usually
available to them during the week. It is, of course, intense human persecu-
tion, especially by shooting, that has caused this timidity on their part.
Though both Herons and Kingfishers are now nominally protected in
Britain, except where it can be proved that they are doing serious damage
to trout-fishing interests, the law in these matters is not always observed.
Individual birds of persecuted, or formerly persecuted, species may
learn that men are harmless in certain areas or that certain categories of
people are everywhere harmless. With species that are abundant in spite of
persecution (usually because man also persecutes their predators or com-
petitors), such as the Wood Pigeon, local populations in "safe" areas may
show considerable "tameness" or indifference to man which is in strong
contrast to the behaviour of their conspecifics elsewhere. These facts do
not, however, disprove the hypothesis that human persecution may often
have a depressing effect on bird populations, irrespective of the "signifi-
cance" or otherwise of the actual numbers killed.
In conclusion, I suggest that in birds the effect of some predators on
some prey species is often greater than any calculation of the mere number
of individuals actually killed would indicate because fear of the predator
may restrict the areas which the prey can exploit for food or living space,
or the periods of time that it can devote to food-seeking or reproductive
behaviour. The availability of food, water, nesting and roosting sites,
though essential, are not always and perhaps not usually the sole deter-
minants of whether or in what numbers a bird species can exist in an area.

They must be present in conjunction with a biologically (and probably
also psychologically) tolerable chances of escaping from predators.
It is perhaps worth adding that many birds, like man, seem relatively
unafraid of dangers which they have no innate disposition to fear. In
London, and doubtless most other towns as well, very many more feral
pigeons are killed by the traffic than fall victim to cats. Over most of the
world far more people are likewise killed by traffic than by predators.
Yet, though they may show apparent fear when avoiding speeding cars,
it is clear by their subsequent behaviour that the traffic evokes none of
the terror that an attacking cat or a man-eating Tiger one the loose would
inspire in a pigeon or a man respectively.

By Dr. JEAN DELACOUR (President of the Avicultural Society)
It has been a great shock to Len Hill's many friends all over the world
to hear that he died suddenly on his return journey from the Falkland
Islands that he owned and visited every year. He was not quite seventy
years old and appeared to be as fit and active as ever when he left England
six weeks previously but he fell asleep on the plane and did not wake up.
Len Hill was an unusually bright character. He came from humble ori-
gins and started working life as a boot boy, living with his parents in the
stableyard of the very place that he later acquired, Chardwar Manor at

Bourton-on-the-Water. In his youth he became a successful builder and
then, because he loved birds, he gathered together one of the best collec-
tions in the world in the four acres of gardens at the back of the lovely old
Manor, the famous "Birdland".He had, without doubt, a very special gift
for planning aviaries and enclosures, as well as a great deal of taste and no
space was wasted.
Now at Birdland there are beautiful greenhouses full of well arranged
tropical plants and suitable birds, very pretty outdoor aviaries, lawns,
ponds and penguin accommodation. None of it is highly elaborate but
it is all well built, well conceived and practical as well as attractive. The
birds are tame and healthy, in perfect condition because they are well
housed and cared for.
There are also excellent educational and public facilities. I remember
opening a lecture hall there a number of years ago which was adorned with
a beautiful mural by Peter Scott. There was a great reception on that
occasion, attended by many of our old members who have since left us.
Len Hill was a marvellous host and a very generous man. In the course of
the years, he gave many delightful parties for our members - we paid for
the reception but the money collected went to our treasury. He was, in
fact one of our very best supporters and gave equally generously of his
time by entertaining the members at social meetings when he showed
films of his birds.
Len Hill had a flair for special undertakings, the most unusual being
the acquisition of two uninhabited islands of the Falklands group, Grand
Jason and Steeple Jason. Birds, particularly penguins, are abundant there
and he scrupulously preserved them taking only, now and then, a few
specimens for his Birdland. He could also write well about this and his
other bird activities.
In these difficult days for private initiative that the world is going
through, Len Hill stood out as an exceptional example of free enter-
prise. The members of our Society, and indeed all those in the world
who share our interest in birds, will feel the poorer for his sudden and
unexpected departure.

Since mentioning Raymond Sawyer's success with the Emerald Starling
Lamprotomis iris in the January-March 1981 issue of the Avicultural
Magazine, Larry Shelton, Curator of Birds at Philadelphia Zoo, sent the
following notes on the breeding activities of what is probably the first
success with this species in the United States. He writes: "In October 1980
we obtained four Emerald Starlings from an importer. After a period of
quarantine, we placed the birds in our Jungle Bird Walk Exhibit. Even
though this exhibit is both extremely large and heavily planted, the birds
were extremely shy and, except for feeding, remained in the highest parts
of the exhibit. In addition to eating our standard softbill food mixture,
nectar, fruit, crickets, mealworms and grubs, the birds, as both Bannerman
and Mackworth-Praed stated, were extremely fond of the black ants which
gathered wherever our nectar containers were located.
"From February on we frequently observed the starlings holding pieces
of green leaves in their beaks. This seemed to have been a pair-bonding
ritual and the leaf particles did not seem to be nesting material. By April
we knew the birds were at least nest-building. As for location, we only
knew that it was not in any of the artificial nest boxes or natural logs we
had provided. Even later when the birds were carrying live food (mostly
mealworms) the combination of the elusiveness of the birds and the heavy
planting and size of the exhibit made location of the nest difficult. Its
actual location was in a cavity of a branch of a large fibre-glass tree made
for the planting of bromeliads and supporting vines at a height of approxi-
mately 15 ft. The nest entrance width was about 4 inches and the maximum
width of the branch was about 8 inches where it joined the main trunk
2 ft below at a 45 degree angle.
"One young fell from the nest entrance on 11th May and drowned in a
pool below the branch. After netting the fishes in the pool it was drained.
For several days until fledging the remaining young birds (actually two)
would come to the entrance for feeding. Both parents fed but the male
would carry only one mealworm or cricket at a time whereas the female
would carry several in her beak at each feeding. The plumage of the fledg-
lings was basically a duller and more yellow green where the adult was iri-
descent emerald, with dark brown replacing the brilliant purple areas.
"In June the adults renested in another practically inaccessible loca-
tion. This time the nest site was in a crevice in a rough stone column
heavily covered with Philodendron and other plants at about 14 feet above

the exhibit floor. The site was such a visual cul de sac that observation of
the nest was impossible. A single individual emerged from this nest in mid-
July.
At the time of writing (August 1981) the two older young are fast assu-
ming the coloration of the adults. The green plumage is almost indistinguish-
able from the emerald of the parents and the brown areas are being flecked
with purple."

The Avicultural Society's first visit abroad was generally judged to be a
great success and, thanks to the very efficient arrangements made by Stitta
Tours, everything went smoothly and pleasantly throughout. Even the
weather was obligingly warm and dry.
Twenty-four members left London Airport on the morning of 28th
September and, after lunch on the plane, arrived at Hannover and then
transferred to the private coach which was to transport them for the entire
visit. The party drove through pleasant countrysidee to Celle where they
spent that and the following night and enjoyed exploring this picturesque
town with its ancient half-timbered gables.
The following two days were spent at Walsrode Bird Park and thanks to
the devoted attention of Dr. Gunter Wennrich throughout that time, a
really comprehensive study was made of this world-famous collection, in-
cluding some fascinating tours behind the scenes. We also had the oppor-
tunity of meeting Herr Trogisch who is in charge of the parrots at the
park. Much has been written about this wonderful park (and Dr. Wennrich
has promised to write about their achievements for future issues of the
Avicultural Magazine) but no one was disappointed and it really did live up
to all our expectations.
The final day was spent at Hannover Zoo whose Scientific Assistant,
Dr. Boer, conducted our party on an extensive tour of this attractive and
interesting city collection. Although the mammals were predominant (in-
cluding breeding groups of African and Indian Elephants, and the only pair
of Pacific Walruses in Europe), there were some very interesting birds
such as free-flying Cattle Egrets and third generation free-flying European
Cormorants. The visit ended at the Herrenhausen Garten where members
found much of interest in the magnificent orchid and cactus houses and
the ornate English gardens.
Members enjoyed not only the places they visited on this tour but also
each other's company and it is hoped to organise another trip to Europe
this year.

Amongst the new arrivals at Padstow Bird Gardens are a trio of Lesser
Seed Snipe Thinocorus rumicivorus. These interesting little birds are
infrequent aviary subjects these days, although they are now present in
several collections through recent importations. They are quiet, unassum-
ing birds which seem to thrive well on a diet of mixed seeds, chick crumbs
(to which ours are rather partial) and live food in the form of mealworms
and blow-fly maggots and pupae. Cress is also consumed in small quanti-
ties. Very little literature is available for the family as a whole but an
interesting account of this species appears in the Avicultural Magazine in
1913 on pages 321- 323.

Not unlike the Seed Snipe in appearance, the Sandgrouse are another
family of which several species have appeared recently after a lapse of
some time. But unlike the Seed Snipe, Sandgrouse have fared well in cap-
tivity, particularly in the first two decades of this century when several
aviculturists had breeding success. At least four species - Pallas's Syrrhap-
tes paradoxus , Black-bellied Pterocles orientals, Greater Pin-tailed P. al-
chata (1897, pp. 178-180) and Chestnut-bellied P. exustus (1905, 64-66)
have been reared in captivity. (Breeding references appearing in the Avi-
cultural Magazine are bracketed.)

More good news on the conservation front. A "probable sighting" of
one of New Zealand's rarest birds, the Laughing Owl Sceloglaux albifacies,
has been reported. A Forest Service hunter identified the bird by flash-
light in the Mt. Richmond State Forest Park. The Laughing Owl has been
thought extinct for nearly 70 years - the last positive sighting was in 1914.
It is understood that the New Zealand Wildlife Service plans a major ex-
pedition in the early spring to try to make a positive identification.

In a recent letter, Henk Wareman outlines some of the breeding
achievements from the Netherlands for the 1980-1981 seasons. Lories
and lorikeets are well represented with Forsten's, Ornate, Meyer's, Perfect,
Goldie's, Iris, Black-winged, Violet-naped and Chattering being bred. Three
species of hanging parrots - Vernal, Blue-crowned and Philippine - were
also reared. Other species reared include Yellow-naped Yuhina, Black-
eared Golden Tanager, Purple Sunbird, Black-billed Seedcracker and
Chestnut Sparrow.
There was also a successful breeding of the Hawk-headed Parrot with
one survivor out of a brood of three. The breeder was advised to give more
soft food such as greenfood and fruit, but the birds did not thrive on this
so he reverted to feeding hard and sprouting seeds only, to save the sole
survivor.
Mr. Wareman also reports the occurrence of a Barraband's Parrot Pionop-
sitta harrabandi in a consignment of parrots and parrkeets from South
America. The bird, a male, unfortunately was very short lived. Six species
of medium sized parrots make up the genus Pionopsitta , of which only
one, the Red-capped P. pileata is seen with any regularity in collect-
ions. Very little appears to be known about barrabandi. Forshaw states it
to be rather rare and locally distributed in the Upper Amazon Basin. Nothing
is known of its breeding behaviour.

Many members will have been interested to read recent contributions
to the Magazine written by W.D. Cummings (late of Keston Foreign Bird
Farm) who is now living in South Africa and is in charge of the Mitchell
Park Aviaries in Durban, which he describes as follows: "Mitchell Park
Aviaries is a small collection of birds and mammals set in one of the oldest
and most beautiful parks in the subtropical city of Durban.
Apart from all the common parrakeets, conures, pheasants and water-
fowl, which breed annually, we also breed regularly Blue-crowned Pigeons,
Rajah Shelduck, Black Swans, the diminutive Blue Duiker, Madagascar
Star Tortoises and the North American turtles. The Seychelles Giant
Tortoises (over 95 years old) mate but no eggs have ever been found. An
interesting adaptation are the white and golden forms of the Mozambique
Talapia (fish) which we have now firmly established in our ponds after
several disastrous set-backs."
"We are hoping to breed the White-bellied Caique this year. The pair
seem to desert just as the eggs are chipped or are fully developed so this
year I have swapped their eggs over with a pair of Black-headed Conures.
The Caiques have hatched and are feeding the Conure chicks but the Caique
eggs have not yet hatched under the Conures - there was a week's difference
in the laying period but this pair of Black-headed Conures are good parents
and have successfully reared their own chicks in previous years. I have also
successfully reared six splendid Hawaiian Geese from the one adult pair -
the first clutch was taken away."

At Padstow Bird Gardens resides an African Grey Parrot, mostly called
George, who, in between drawing as much blood as possible from public and
staff alike, delights in mimicking the calls of several birds found wild in the
area. While his repertoire includes Curlew, Oystercatcher, Herring Gull and
Tawny Owl, the passerines elude him, probably because their calls have
too high a frequency pitch for him to imitate. One species which is not so
restricted is the Marsh Warbler Acrocephalus palustris , a palaearctic migrant
which winters in Africa. Research on its ability to imitate other species
shows its repertoire to include 212 species, made up of 99 European and
113 African species. Taped individuals contained on average 72 identified
species, but as a fifth of the complete song remained unidentified, in due
course the song of other African birds will be added to boost the overall
total.

As an enthusiastic but extremely amateur photographer, I found this
beautiful book to be quite the most practical volume on this subject that I
have ever read, having struggled and given up halfway through many
others. Whilst the author says that he assumes the reader to already possess
a basic knowledge of photography, I found that many of the simplest
principles, which had hitherto eluded me, suddenly became apparent.
This book really does fulfill its promise of giving the reader a complete
course in wildlife photography, from the fundamental to advanced and
specialised projects. The author, whose work has for many years been
admired in wildlife books and journals, provides a list of basic equipment
needed with a checklist of cameras, lenses and accessories that are most
suitable for different purposes, describes at length general field work and
specific camera techniques and then gives instructions for stalking, build-
ing hides, using bait and lures, photographing animals in flight as well as
close-ups of very small subjects. He also discusses photography in con-
trolled conditions such as the studio, tank or aquarium with excellent tips
on lighting and microscopic work. The following chapters suggest many
unusual and interesting subjects in different locations and conditions in
every part of the world.
The drawings which illustrate specific points are excellent and, as one
would imagine, the many colour and black and white photographs accom-
panying the text are of the highest quality and alone make the purchase
of this book worthwhile. I suppose that by today's standards, which
admittedly still take a bit of getting used to, the price is reasonable.

BIRDS OF EAST AFRICA
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.967669235294118" page_id="56284458"  page_num="64" year="" vol="">
Edited by P.L. BRITTON, 271 pp, 5 colour plates, 15 black and white
photographs, 4 maps. Price: 130.00 K. Shs.
This is described in the Preface as an attempt to summarise what is
known of the status, distribution and habitat requirements of birds in East
Africa (Kenya, Tanzania and Uganda), with details for all species reliably
reported, including distribution details for all subspecies. There are repro-
ductions from five coloured paintings by Rena Fennessy, otherwise
identification is not dealt with and there are no general descriptions of the
1,293 species. The view is taken that such information may be obtained
from Mackworth-Praed and Grant's handbook which covers the three
countries.
THE BREEDING SEASONS OF EAST AFRICAN BIRDS
By L.H. BROWN and P.L. BRITTON, 164 pp. Price: 105.00 K. Shs.
This work attempts to bring together all that is known of the breeding
seasons of East African birds and relates them, so far as possible, to the
climatic factors, especially rainfall, controlling scarcity or abundance and
seasonal changes of various foods.

MODERN FARMING METHODS AND THEIR POSSIBLE EFFECT
ON BIRD LIFE
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999581" page_id="56284459"  page_num="65" year="" vol="">
Following the breeding season each year, I, like fellow aviculturists
walk round and tidy up the aviaries. Bundles of chewed branches and
other debris that have accumulated through the summer months can be
gathered up, repairs to flights and shelters can be carried out before the
onset of winter, feathers can be picked up and labelled to give to young
collectors who wait all year for a rare bird to moult and thus enhance
their feather collection.
This should be a time to relax and review with enjoyment the suc-
cesses of the year. Also, for us, it is a time to delight in the view from the
aviaries across a valley which is an ever changing picture of the farming
industry - a view which, for much of the year, we are too busy to admire.
Visitors to our collection are enchanted by the landscape, seeing only
beautiful English countryside stretching far into the distance.
Few see danger in so picturesque a setting, but my own enjoyment is
marred by fears for the birds under my protection. As soon as crops are
harvested, these acres of farmland will be chemically treated with weed-
killer before the annual burning of stubble begins.
The view of the valley is then obliterated by dense smoke and we are
sent, coughing and choking, indoors. Even with doors and windows closed
the fumes still penetrate the house. Sometimes, after these unpleasant
sessions, both my wife and I have experienced stomach pains. I am, there-
fore, concerned as to both the immediate and long-term effect that these
possibly poisonous fumes could have on birds of the countryside and par-
ticularly on aviary birds.
At this time of year many hedgerows are burned and destroyed com-
pletely. The number of small corpses found beneath tells its own sad
story. Under one such hedgerow I counted 23 small unidentified birds,
seven Partridge, two Hedgehogs and a number of small rodents.
These hedgerows are lost in future to the multitude of bird, animal and
insect life that has previously lived there.
In the aviaries during one particularly bad year, I lost six nests of young
chicks when hens became distressed and deserted during stubble burning.
As a precautionary measure against possible contamination, all food and
water dishes are removed, and no green twigs are cut for the birds for
several weeks.

After the environment has been subjected to these pollutions, there is a
noticeable drop in food intake and for several days birds are subdued and
look distressed.
In spring and summer low flying aircraft bombard the aviaries with
sprays and pellets when treating adjacent fields against pests and mildew,
etc. I am aware that these sprays and pellets should be avoided by humans
and feel that they could be equally dangerous to birds.
The drift from weedkillers applied to the land has damaged conifer
hedges planted here as windbreaks for the aviaries and Goldcrests nesting
in these hedges desert their young. I am not sure why the young subse-
quently die; whether it is because the natural food supply becomes con-
taminated, or whether it is as a result of direct contact with chemical
sprays. My knowledge of poisons is limited; I am only aware that the
young are healthy and vigorous before fields are sprayed and are found
dead afterwards.
The Goldcrest is one species I have noted to suffer as a result of the use
of chemicals on farmland, and another is the Partridge. This little game
bird was seen in abundance on my meadowland at one time but numbers
have rapidly decreased over the last twenty years.
I collected several dead Partridges during the breeding season and as
this coincided with fields being sprayed, I am of the opinion that farm
chemicals may well be the cause of the decline of the Partridge here. I
fear this is yet another bird that modern farming cannot support.
The arrival of the Nightingale was always looked forward to, but sadly
we have not heard this lovely songster for several years. The only bird that
seems to benefit from modem farming methods in this area is the Collared
Dove, which can be seen in flocks of up to 100 birds.
I would be interested to read fellow members' comments and points of
view on the use of farm chemicals and stubble burning in relation to both

Notes on Sex-Identity in Birds of Identical Colour
I was interested to read the article on breeding the Greater Hill Mynah
Gracula religiosa by Andrea J. Ouse of the Van Saun Park Zoo, New
Jersey, USA, ( AviculturalMagazine , 1980, Vol. 86, No. 1, page 5) in which

she barely discerns or describes any visible sexual difference between the
cock and the hen bird.
When we first bred the Greater Hill Mynah at Keston Foreign Bird
Farm in 1957, about which my friend and colleague, Edward Boosey,
wrote an account (Avicultural Magazine , 1957, Vol. 63, No. 5, p. 160),
our pair were easily identifiable - but I do agree that some pairs are very
difficult to identify.
Our cock bird was, as I remember, the runt of a consignment of fifty or
so "gapers" imported from India the year or so before and, since he need-
ed special attention to survive - he was left behind when the rest were
sold - he became a special pet. He was a small bird, much smaller than
other sexually identifiable cocks and hens in the consignment, his growth
having been retarded by the conditions to which he was subjected, prior to
shipment overseas. However, he had identifiable male characteristics - his
wattle was long and tended to overlap and the yellow skin coloration
around the beak tended to extend through the bristles around the upper
beak and eyes. His feet were small in this case, comparable to his body size
but his beak was thicker and the top of his head flatter than in the hen.
The young hen, selected from another consignment the following year,
tended to have a fmer bill, rounder head and smaller, paler yellow wattles,
and hen she proved to be. She was a better specimen than the cock bird,
identical in size, although immature and a year younger than he, but she
had not had the same shock in early growth that the cock had experien-
ced. Even after two or three years, and following minor changes in build
and wattle development, the pair were still sexually identifiable apart.
There is, however, percentage-wise, a proportion of individuals within
a species of identical coloration and these are almost sexually indisting-
uishavle. Added personal characteristics also vary in the individual, and
vary according to the locality and this will affect body size variation, the
dullness or intensity of coloration and even other physical variations such
as the beak shape and the size of the feet. Age also changes certain physi-
cal attributes and behaviour patterns make sexual identification more
difficult. Some species are more easily identifiable sexually as they leave
the nest, but grow together as they become independant. All this makes
identification of some individual birds very difficult.
Unfortunately breeders of birds often select the sexually identifiable
young to retain for further breeding and part with the more difficult-to-
sex youngsters. In so doing they part with the hens throwing the larger,
more vigorous body size and those with deeper coloration for the more
fragile, finer proportioned birds, to the detriment of their breeding stock.
To overcome this problem is to revert back to the method mentioned

by Miss Ouse in her article of allowing the birds to select their own mates,
which method, where possible, I would highly recommend to ensure com-
patible, matched breeding pairs, the natural way.
Nature is infinite in its individual variations, even within a species, so
sex identity can often only be made of the small percentage of the ob-
vious and of the balance only by knowing all the facts concerning their
age, background, locality and past history, which is often not possible.
Science has now come to our aid and if one likes to take the plunge,
positive identification can be made through the Endescope test to avoid
the hazard of sitting for years with two rare birds, indistinguishable but
of the same sex.

BREEDING THE AFRICAN SPOONBILL

The African Spoonbill is one of two species of spoonbill that Eves and
breeds in tropical Africa. Distinguished by its white body, red facial skin
and legs, pink and grey bill, and crestless head, the African is slightly larger
than its more northern complement, the White or European Spoonbill P.
leucorodia. It occurs in scattered populations south of the Sahara, primarily
in the vicinity of shallow lakes and tributaries.
In October 1977, the St. Louis Zoological Park purchased three African
Spoonbills for display in its larger outdoor, walk-through aviary. During
the warmer months of the year, this exhibit contains numerous avian
specimens of mainly waterfowl, cranes, flamingoes, gulls, touracos and
wading birds. Many of these breed annually, and it was hoped that the new
additions would also.
During 1978 our African Spoonbills failed to demonstrate any inclina-
tion to reproduce. Because this species is a colonial nester, a co-operative
venture was entered into with the Chicago Zoological Park, Brookfield,
Illinois, and with Busch Gardens, Tampa, Florida. These institutions lent
one and two female specimens respectively in an effort to further enhance
the reproductive prospects of this group. However, the birds also failed to
display any reproductive behaviour during the 1979 and 1980 breeding
seasons. It was suspected that their transfer to indoor quarters during the
winter months was inhibiting propagation. Since the spoonbills had failed
to take advantage of the existing nesting locations, a decision was made to
construct one that would, hopefully, prove more acceptable. In May of
1981 a tree that had been recently "topped" was chosen as a possible nest-
ing site. We utilised a circular metal basket with a rounded bottom. It
measured 22 inches (55.9 cm) and 11 inches (27.9 cm) in height, and had
previously been used as a container for hanging plants. This structure was
placed directly atop the sheared tree trunk, approximately 13 feet (3.96 m)

from the ground, and then fresh leaves and twigs were woven into its alu-
minium frame.
By late May, two of the spoonbills (the St. Louis male and the Chicago
female) began showing signs of pair bonding, as they were often observed
allo-preening. By early June their behaviour had advanced to exchanging,
carrying and gathering nesting material. Within a short time they had com-
pletely removed and replaced the leaves and twigs we had provided.
Three eggs were laid in July, 1981. The first egg appeared in the nest on
1 st July, and the female immediately began to incubate. Consequently,
it was impossible to determine exactly when the other eggs were laid, but
it was surmised that they were laid at two to three-day intervals. Incubation
duties were shared by both sexes; while one was on the nest, the other
usually perched in the immediate vicinity. The pair maintained its bond by
allo-preening during incubation and by vocalising and copulating when
they exchanged positions on the nest.
The first white chick was observed on 27th July, and was estimated to
be approximately two to three days old. The parents had already begun
feeding the chick with regurgitated food. The African Spoonbills were fed
primarily with smelt; however, they had access to our flamingo diet, which
is a gruel containing krill. A pan of a commercially prepared diet for birds
of prey was also available to them. By the first week of August, all three
chicks had hatched and were being diligently cared for by the pair. This
included not only feeding and brooding, but also shading the chicks from
the hot August sun. At approximately four weeks of age, the oldest chick
was beginning to venture from the nest on to adjacent limbs of the tree,
returning only for feeding and brooding. Within time, however, all the
chicks were roosting on adjacent limbs, where they were fed by the
adults. They began flying freely about the exhibit during the second week
of September.
It is interesting to note that when the spoonbills were transferred to
their winter quarters on 18th October, two eggs were discovered in the
nest. They had apparently been laid in late September or early October,
but both proved to be infertile.
This species was first bred in captivity in 1978 at Vogelpark Walsrode
in West Germany. The breeding and hatching of African Spoonbills at the
St. Louis Zoological Park is an event which, we believe, represents the
first success with Platalea alba in North America. It well illustrated the
importance of co-operative breeding ventures between zoological institu-
tions, for without it, this accomplishment would certainly not have
occurred.

I bought my first Spectacled Amazon Parrot, a hen, in October 1976,
</equation>
<bodyText confidence="0.999557294117647" page_id="56284473"  page_num="71" year="" vol="">
and just four months later, in February 1977,1 followed up an advertised
"pair for sale". As the Spectacled is sexually dimorphic in colour, I recog-
nised the "pair" as two cocks. I took both of them home, however, and in-
troduced 'Choice A' to the hen. The hen sought the cock's company by
persistently following him around the aviary, all over the wire and along
the perches. Usually he ignored her, but occasionally would turn on her
and reject her. The second cock was tried the following year but with simi-
lar results. And so, after two years, the cocks were reunited and at once
showed an affection for each other that they had never shown for the hen.
I now believe that the previous owner could have mistaken them for a true
pair as they even feed one another.
In December 1979 I bought and tried yet another cock. Initially he
started off by sitting at a distance from the hen, but by that very same
evening they were roosting together. One could not wish for a more
compatible pair. They preen each other, feed together and roost very
close. Throughout the year the cock enters the nest box and coaxes the
hen to follow by making curious noises. They are unlike any parrot noise
that I am familiar with, and the best way I can describe it is as a soft and
fairly high-pitched mewing. He can keep this up for as long as ten minutes,
but the only time I have seen the hen enter the nest box is in the breeding
season.
In the spring of 1980 there were four fertile eggs, but disaster struck
when a squirrel disturbed the hen and she deserted. Although the eggs
were chilled, I put them into an incubator and eventually three chicks
hatched out. Alas, to my great disappointment I failed to rear them.
In the spring of 1981, four fertile eggs were laid on April 18th, 21st,
24th and 27th. My hopes were high again as the hen sat tight and the cock
fed her in the nest box, but then on the 25th day I noticed a newly
hatched chick lying in the seed tray. One of its legs had been severed
below the heel and was still bleeding. The chick was very pale and died
soon afterwards. I just could not face this happening again so I put the
three remaining eggs into an incubator. I remembered a television docu-
mentary which described how, by tweeting to a duckling prior to hatching
one could imprint one's voice on to the duckling and the duckling would

then respond only to that person's voice. I tried this and found that the
eldest chick was soon peeping back strongly, and similarly with the other
chicks within some 48 hours of hatching. I have the incubator in my bed-
room, and the chick would reply to my voice even from the far side of the
room - about 17 ft. It felt uncanny to be communicating with a chick
which was still enclosed in its shell, but the experiment was worth while
since, after hatching, the chick would answer back and gape for food
whenever I tweeted.
Each chick made the first pip about 24 hours before hatching. After a
long rest the chick then chipped around the egg until the top was broken
off. The latter chipping, plus heaving its head from the shell and kicking
itself out of the egg, only took each chick a maximum of 30 minutes. The
chicks hatched out on May 16th, 18th and 21st - that is, on the 25th, 24th
and 24th day of incubation.
Initially the chicks were fed every two hours on Farlene, and then later
on baby food (Cow and Gate fruit delight), finely sieved ground sunflower
seed, some scraped cuttlefish bone, a few drops of Vitapet (a mixture of
vegetable oil and cod liver oil, and more palatable than plain cod liver oilO,
a small amount of yoghourt, a trace of Vionate powder and a few grains of
grit. It has been said that if one can get past the first seven days then one
has a real chance of success, but in my experience the first seven days
present few problems and the critical days are from the 7th to the 15th.
I have a cock Eclectus which has been indoors for some years and
which makes a habit of regurgitating and feeding the padlock on its cage.
It seemed to me that this secretion could contain enzymes from the bird's
saliva, and gastric juices brought up from the proventiculus into the crop
during regurgitation. The reason I think this secretion is proventicular in
origin is that it is nothing like "pigeon's milk". The latter is a thick and
cheesy protein secretion originating from the degeneration of cells which
line the crops of both sexes of the pigeon in the breeding season. My
Eclectus, which feeds the padlock throughout the year, secretes a slime
and seed which smells slightly acrid and of wet wheat germ, is nearly
colourless, and when given a litmus test, indicates strong acidity.
It is said to be comparatively easy to rear a chick that has been fed by
its parents even for a few days, and so, as I had already decided to feed the
regurgitated secretion to at least one of the chicks, I started with the
middle one. I collected the secretion and mixed it with a little water in
order to separate the slime from the seed and then, with some trepidation,
mixed the liquid with the Farlene and administered it to the middle chick.
I monitored the chicks' crops to see how they fared, and observed that

when the crop of the middle chick was empty, the other two were still
three-quarters full. As and when the secretion became available, I added it
in turn to each chick's feed and, throughout the rearing, encountered no
digestion problems at ah.
Careful examination of the pin feathers revealed that the colours of the
feathers were distinguishable even while still enclosed in their sheaths. I
was able to see red in the primary covert and alula areas and thereby knew,
even at the pin feather stage, that all three were cocks. It has been docu-
mented that a "known hen albifrons " - one that has laid - "has the alula
and primary coverts partly red", but I am not optimistic that any of my
chicks will turn out to be a hen, especially since in my hen, which has no
red at all in the wing, the red in the peri-ophthalmic region is noticeably
less bright than in the cock and the three chicks.

were otherwise fully feathered that the tiny red feathers began to appear
in the region which surrounds the eye and forms the 'spectacle'.
After the chicks had reached the pin feather stage, I hoped that trom
then on everything would be plain sailing; but an accident occurred which,
with hindsight, I should have anticipated. The chicks were vigorous and
lively, and had outgrown their container. Everything was going so well and
I did not want to change anything. And then the eldest chick, while climb-
ing about, got his needle-sharp claws into the skin of the youngest chick,
between the neck and the back of the shoulder, and ripped a slit which
needed four stitches to close.
Fortunately no internal damage was done and a lesson learned.
Although it resulted in a considerable setback in the chick's progress when
compared with its brothers (see photograph), it has now fully recovered
and is their equal, both in size and feathering.
As described above, the Spectacled (White-fronted) Amazon Parrot
Amazona albifrons nana has been bred by Mr. P. Clarke. This is believed
to be the first success in this country but anyone knowing of a previous
breeding in Great Britain or Northern Ireland is asked to inform the Hon.
Secretary.

INCUBATORS AND HAND-REARING IN AVICULTURE

By J. STOODLEY (Lovedean, Hampshire)
Many years ago, when serving my apprenticeship as an aviculturist, I
held strong views against placing eggs or chicks under foster parents. Any
bird unable to produce and rear their young unaided was of no use to me,
and there was no place for such birds in my collection.
Later, my outlook changed. I came to terms with the fact that some
pairs would take several seasons before becoming reliable breeding birds.
Eggs produced in these first years were of value, as a percentage could be
hatched if placed under willing hens. Unfortunately I was to find that few
foster hens incubated these eggs successfully. Different types of eggs had
different requirements, and this was especially true of the Pionus group.

The same problems occurred when using small incubators, and the over-
all experiment was far from satisfactory.
I was determined to continue working with parrot eggs, and decided to
build my own incubator. There had been no previous work of any signifi-
cance done on parrot incubation, and very few parrots were being bred in
Britain. My work, therefore, had to start from scratch.
We were unable to obtain much useful or helpful information on incu-
bators until we met Mr Philip Glasier of the Newent Falconry Centre. It
was pleasing to meet a man of such outstanding achievement who was so
very generous with his knowledge, and on his invitation my wife and I
spent a day at the Centre.
We joined a group of his students discussing the merits of an incubation
unit that Mr. Glasier had built. I sketched and made notes of the successful
unit before joining Mr. Glasier on a walk through the falconry grounds. His
birds were obviously delighted to see him, and although a heavy fall of
snow had kept visitors away, for us it was a perfect day to observe this vast
collection of birds of prey.
Having obtained the components required the incubator was assembled.
The unit takes the form of a simple cube, each side being approximately
29.5 ins (75 cms) in length. However, two-thirds of one side form a door
which opens to the full width of the cube. A large opening is essential to
provide easy manipulation of the eggs within, and the removal of the egg
tray.
Above the door is a small glass panel which allows observation of the
thermometer without the incubator door being opened. On one side,
about 4 ins (10 cms) above the base, are three holes approximately % in.
(2 cms) in diameter. There are three similar holes on the opposite side,
but these are twice the distance above the base. They ensure a constant
change of air within the incubator.
The sides of the cube are double skinned to restrict heat loss. Simple
household insulation is placed between the walls which are about 3 4 in
(2 cms) apart, including the door of the unit. The interior surface is For-
mica and the exterior plywood. Placed centrally within the incubator is
the egg tray. This is constructed with wooden dowels about Vi in. (12.7 mm)
in diameter. The dowels are plastic covered which aids cleaning and, more
importantly, facilitates the turning of the eggs. The tray is supported on
slides, so that it is easily removed.
Two fans positioned on the top and bottom of the incubator are essen-
tial to assist the circulation of heat and air. Surrounding the fans are two
heating elements, each of 120 watts and controlled by a heavy duty light-

ing dimmer, which ensures that the elements are never used at their maxi-
mum output. The temperature within the incubator is controlled by a
Jumo Adjustable Contact Thermometer, type MS 1ZZ, coupled to a Jumo
Relay GKT 15-0, and also a Jumo Thermometer 1411 at egg level. A small
light bulb inside the incubator allows observation of the eggs and thermo-
meter.
The completed unit is most accurate, capable of maintaining a tempera-
ture to within 0.2 of a degree. I select a temperature of 98.5 degrees F (37
degrees C) with confidence that it will be maintained. To obtain humidity
within the unit, I use one or two flat dishes about 7 ins (17.8 cms) in
diameter, which contain water. To increase humidity I place the dishes
closer to the fan, and vice versa. Some adjustment with regard to surface
area of water is necessary, and a smaller container sometimes comes in
useful.
Having built the incubator, the next problem was which eggs to select
for our First experiment. Although Mr. Glasier obtains almost one hundred
percent success rate, we were not so optimistic. However, a number of
Pionus eggs were put up.
The eggs were marked with an arrow on each side. These arrows are in
opposition to each other which allows me to rotate each egg 180 degrees
and then counter rotate. In this way, turning is accomplished without the
egg rolling continually in the same direction, which would be most harm-
ful. If the egg is continually turned in the same direction, there is a danger
that the embryo would be strangled.
I turn the eggs as near as possible every two hours, and ideally seven
times per day. I suggest a minimum of five times per day. An odd number
of turns were made to avoid having the egg lie on the same side for two
nights running.
In this first batch a percentage of eggs failed to hatch. These failures
were examined, and my findings show that some eggs had lost too much
moisture, the air space being large, while others had a small air space
with excess moisture, this being the unabsorbed albumen. These problems
were to be overcome, however, as I was gradually becoming more aware of
the actual requirements.
It will be appreciated that birds come from vastly different climatic
zones and varying altitudes, especially the Pionus and Amazons. This
obviously has a bearing on conditions prevalent at the time of incubation.
All new eggs were weighed and coded, using balance scales of great
accuracy. Interesting facts on average weights of various eggs are as follows:

It is interesting to note that eggs of small parrots of the Pionus group
are not much smaller than eggs of the considerably larger Amazon parrots.
Clean eggs are an important part of successful hatching, although it is
not advisable to wash them. Soiled eggs can be cleaned dry with a very fine
sandpaper. I prefer not to put cold eggs straight into the incubator at 98.5
degrees F (37 degrees C), and allow them to warm gradually for several
hours beforehand.
After three days' incubation the eggs are weighed again and weights
recorded. They are also candled at this stage. I find the best method of
candling is to use a 40 watt lamp in a light-tight box. An egg-shaped hole
is cut into the top of the box, and I have several rubber discs which allow
me to adjust the aperture to the size of the egg. The lamp must be about
2 ins (5 cms) from the egg, and great care must be taken not to expose the
egg to the heat of the lamp for more than a second or two. Since I have a
great many eggs to candle, I place a compression switch on the floor and
illuminate the box for each egg with a press of the foot. This leaves my
hands free, and avoids any overheating of the globe and box.
A fertile egg shows blood vessels in the yolk, although at this early
stage they are very thin. I also observe the air space. Clear eggs are not
discarded at this stage, but wait until the next candling at six days. At this
point all clear eggs are then removed. I continue to weigh and candle eggs
every three days. At nine days this will sometimes reveal slight movement,

the embryonic development will be considerable and a distinct centre is
developing. The air space should continue to enlarge.
Eggs that are not keeping to their charted course are transferred to
another incubator according to their requirements. Although humidity
control is important, the eggs can tolerate fluctuations in this respect to a
greater degree than variations in temperature.
I know that, provided the egg loses 16% of its weight during its incuba-
tion period, it is most likely to hatch. The embryo has some slight control
over its water metabolism. For instance, should it be subjected to excess
moisture then a period of drier atmosphere will compensate, and vice versa.
However, I have found that eggs may hatch with a variation as much as 4%
above or below the theoretical 16%. This does not apply to temperature
control where mistakes cannot be rectified and, in most instances, prove
fatal.
An example of weight loss calculated at 16%:-
If weight of an egg is 20 grams, then the theoretical weight
loss in 28 days would be 3.2 grams.
Loss per day would, therefore, be 3_.2 _grams = q 114 grams
28 days T days
To measure relative humidity in a forced air incubator, I find the most
reliable method is to use a wet bulb thermometer. This is simply a normal
thermometer with one end of a cotton wick slid over the bulb end, and the
other end of the wick immersed in distilled water. The liquid prevents the
wick from hardening, hence the reading will remain correct. It is impera-
tive that the wick covers at least 3 cms of the thermometer stem.
The average humidity requirements are between 50-60% (relative
humidity, not to be confused with wet bulb readings). Exceptions do
occur, as with the Coral-billed Parrot of the Pionus group. I was obliged
to reduce relative humidity to 40% to achieve success. The following rela-
tive humidity figures were obtained with the use of a Whirling Hygro-
meter, and the relevant tables.
Incubator temperature 98.5 degrees F.

egg, and large veins can be seen reaching towards the pointed end of the
egg - towards the unabsorbed albumen. Three or four days before the
eggs are due to hatch they are placed in a shallow wire basket lined with
Kleenex tissue and are no longer turned. A cover is placed over the basket.
Over the last two days a dry atmosphere helps the chick to break the mem-
brane and enter the air space.
If the egg is held to the ear, very often the chick can be heard scratch-
ing or tapping, sometimes even squeaking. Close inspection of the shells
will often reveal small cracks. (I avoid the temptation to open the incuba-
tor every few minutes). At this stage maximum humidity is essential to
assist emergence from the shell. Some chicks take many hours to hatch. If
this occurs naturally, it will emerge with the aid of the egg tooth, which is
a small pointed knob on the tip of the upper mandible.
The empty egg shells are collected for future use. If a chick has made
no effort to pip, I candle to check its position before making a small hole
into the air space. If the chick is alive a pulsating movement can be seen,
and if the chick's beak has pierced the membrane, it will be able to breathe
and the possibility of suffocation will be averted. I then moisten the mem-
brane with warm water applied with a small paint brush. The blood vessels
will show very clearly when wet, and if they are bright red then I know
that they are still attached to the umbilicus. The hole in the shell is capped
using one of the empty egg shells collected beforehand.
When the chick is ready to be released from its shell, the veins will no
longer be bright red when moistened. They will be very dark red, which
indicates that they will not bleed when I assist the chick's emergence. The
hole in the shell is enlarged, and with the aid of the wet paint brush, I en-
large the hole in the membrane around the beak. I prefer to help release
the chick a little at a time, constantly taking note of whether the chick
will try to further free itself by its own endeavours.
When placing the chick back in the incubator, care should be taken to
keep it away from the draught caused by the fans, thus avoiding excessive
drying of the membranes. After two hours, I see if further assistance is
required. Some chicks exhaust themselves in their efforts to get free. While
this tricky operation is being carried out, I wear magnifying lenses and
always have to hand cotton wool buds and Friar's Balsam. The latter is
used if the umbilicus is not fully healed.
When the ehick finally emerges, the membrane remains in the shell, and
a considerable amount of excreta is also present.
If, when the egg was opened, the beak had not pierced the membrane,
I moisten it as previously described. The mandible should be clearly visible.

J. STOODLEY - INCUBATORS AND HAND-REARING
Using a large needle, I puncture the membrane, taking care not to rupture
the veins. I make the insertion just large enough to let air in, then I cap the
hole as before and return it to the incubator.
It may be a day or two before the veins change to a dark colour, then I
proceed as before. Using the technique I have described, I have greatly in-
creased the number of youngsters successfully hatched - chicks which, in
earlier years, I would have written off as dead in shell. I am delighted to
read from time to time that since publishing my work on releasing chicks
from the egg, other aviculturists are using my methods to save chicks that
would otherwise perish.
In past years my feeding formulae have always included well known
brands of baby cereals together with many other ingredients. I occasionally
lost a chick at about fourteen days, however, and this I considered was due
to the diet. I felt this may be because the diet contained an excessive level
of grain protein. Therefore, we decided to experiment with different diets.
The chicks were divided into three groups, and what can only be des-
cribed as feed trials were carried out. Group 1 was fed on a baby cereal,
Group 2 on a mixture of ground sunflower, soya cereal, juice from carrot
and greens and a small amount of cereal, and Group 3 was fed on first
stage baby meat and vegetable dinners (glass jar variety).
All groups had SMA dried baby milk included in their diet. We prefer
this milk to any other, including fresh, because the animal fat has been
removed and replaced by vegetable fats. To introduce flora into the system
all chicks were fed a small amount of yoghourt. This, we feel, contributes
greatly to our successful rearing from the egg.
I find that chicks that have benefitted by as little as one day with the
parent birds are very easily hand-reared and suffer no digestive problems,
proving that the first crop milk is most important.
After three weeks chopped sunflower was added to all three groups,
and the results of our trials assessed. Group 1 had a death rate of 10%,
Group 2 suffered no losses, but some crop compaction and slow growth
was evident. Group 3 suffered no losses, and was enjoying vigorous growth.
In conclusion, first stage baby dinner proved the best diet on all counts.
It is pleasing to find my early published work on parrot nutrition, es-
pecially in the use of natural yoghourt and baby foods, is now being so
widely published and used with success in the U.K.
Birds are made to gape for their feed and never tubed, because when
birds are tube fed they prove difficult to get on to seed. All food is fed
warm. Newly hatched chicks are given fairly liquid food using a small
syringe with l /i ins (1 Vi cms) of cycle valve rubber attached to prevent
damage to the soft mandible.

In different parrots the shape of the mandible varies considerably.
Blue-fronted Amazons have wide shovel-like lower mandibles, while
the Spectacled Amazon and Salle's Amazon are somewhat finch-like at
this early stage.
During the first days the brooder temperature is reduced slightly by
34 degrees. Humidity is very important to prevent dehydration, and I
keep the relative humidity between 60 and 65%.
In conclusion, I would like to make clear my reasons for incubating
eggs. I find if I take early first round eggs, all of which are not usually
fertile, the hen will continue to lay. The second clutch is more likely to
be fertile. These eggs are brooded by the hen, and she will also raise the
chicks. With the help of my incubators, which can also be used as
brooders, some pairs have produced six or seven chicks in one breeding
season. One exceptional pair have produced many more. I consider these
results well worth the late nights and early morning feeds.

For four and a half weeks in 1979 I observed a Buffy Hummingbird as
it developed from the nestling stage. At that time I was working at the
Margarita Island campus of the Fundacion Fa Salle near Punta de Piedras,
Venezuela. On 24th August 1979 a student brought to me a young hum-
mingbird that she said had fallen from a tree. The bird was barely large
enough to cover my thumbnail, but its body was completely covered with
grey feathers. Its remiges and rectrices had just begun to develop, so its
powers of flight consisted of the limited ability to break its fall. The bill,
although elongated, was not as long in proportion to the body as that of
an adult bird. The young bird seemed to be unable to open its toes suf-
ficiently to stand on a flat surface, a condition that persisted as the bird
matured.

EDWARD J. HARRISON - BUFFY HUMMING BIRD
On the first day I fed the bird a solution of sugar and water, but
thereafter honey replaced the sugar. Initially I used a micropipette to
place droplets of the solution on the commissure near the tip of the bill
to induce the bird to lick them up. Within 24 hours, it learned to lick
droplets directly from the micropipette. On the second day I assembled
a feeding station from a laboratory stand, a clamp and a tiny (M0ml) glass
vial. I clamped the vial to the stand so that it was tilted about 45* from
the vertical and placed it where the bird could reach it without moving
from the small twig that served as a perch. Feeding from the micropipette
continued, but from time to time I moved the feeding station slightly so
that the bird's bill entered the vial and dipped into the honey water. By
26th August it had learned to lick the honey water directly from the vial,
so the micropipette was no longer necessary. The bird used the feeding
station throughout the remainder of the observation period. The bird was
kept uncaged in my office, and during the first week it made several
attempts to fly. By 30th August it could fly in a straight line and was
making several flights a day. The bird passed most of the day preening,
scratching by the leg-over-wing technique (see also Skutch, 1964) and
feeding from the vial while sitting on its perch. Because it still had very
poor control over its landings, the bird was confined to a box at night.
During the second week, the bird continued to refine its flight skills
and gradually developed the ability to hover and manoeuvre. Ruby-
throated Hummingbirds Archilochus colubris have been reported as
having this ability at fledging (Bend, 1940), but other authors suggest a
more gradual development of manoeuvrability (Allen, 1951, p. 301). By
5th September it was flying at will, pausing here and there to investigate
and then moving on. It had also gained control over its landings, so it was
no longer confined at night and allowed to roost on its perch. At this
time I placed the feeding station so that the bird had to feed on the wing.
This presented a more natural situation and encouraged exercise. A Petri
dish, filled with water and placed on top of an inverted beaker was offered
as a bathing site. Within a few minutes, the bird noticed the new appara-
tus and flew around it to investigate. After familiarising itself with the
dish and its contents, the bird perched on the rim and bathed. From its
position on the rim, the bird moved its bill downward to touch the bottom
of the dish, ran the bill tip along the bottom toward the opposite side of
the dish until its head entered the water, and then raised the bill tip out
of the water. When done in rapid sequence, these movements produced a
scooping motion that caused water to flow over the bird's head and down
its nape. Other hummingbirds have been observed to perch in the water

to bathe (Bent, 1940), but I did not observe this one to do so. Its reluc-
tance to enter the water may have been due to the inability to stand flat-
footed on the bottom of the dish.
By 21st September the bird's plumage had developed sufficiently to
confirm its identity as a Buffy Hummingbird. Honey and water still
constituted the major portion of its diet, but it also fed on fruit flies
Drosophila sp. that visited mangos and bananas kept in the office. The
bird first showed an interest in flowers by approaching and hovering near
a flower pattern on a shirt. I followed up this interest by keeping a supply
of Hibiscus flowers in my office. Although the bird inspected the flowers
often, I never observed it attempting to feed from them. Perhaps the
honey water provided a food source that was too convenient. The bird
might have been converted to the natural food source by limiting its
access to the honey water. Unfortunately, on 29th September the
laboratory building was subjected to an unannounced fumigation, and
the bird died.

VENT SEXING AND PINIONING YOUNG WATERFOWL
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.989625694444445" page_id="56284486"  page_num="84" year="" vol="">
By MICHAEL LUBBOCK (Goodewood, Montgomery, Alabama, USA)
All the waterfowl family can be vent sexed, some more easily than
others. The tree duck genus (. Dendrocygna ) is probably the most diffi-
cult to sex at all ages and the swans prove difficult to sex during adoles-
cence. One obviously needs practice to become competent at vent sexing
waterfowl. It is very important to know how to upturn the bird and care-
fully manipulate the vent in order to see whether it is a male or female.
The bird should be as relaxed as possible. Big swans often require two
people to sex them, one to hold the bird and the other to scrutinise the
vent.
Before 1969, very little vent sexing had been practised on downy
young of wild waterfowl, possibly because it was thought they were too
small and any manipulation of the vent could cause ruptures and bruising
or that it might lead to a bacterial infection which might be fatal. However,
this practice had been used on domestic birds for quite a long time and a
paper on the subject was published by the B.D.K.A. Year Book in 1934.
Pinioning, on the other hand, was done when the young were a few
days old. Whether the bird was pinioned on the right or left wing depen-
ded on the year - even years on the right, uneven on the left.
I took the job, in 1969, of running the largest private waterfowl collec-
tion in America, owned by Mr. Winston Guest Jnr. He had enough faith in
my capabilities to allow, many of the ideas that I had bottled up for a
number of years in England to be put into practice. One of my first notions
tried was to sex and pinion young "downies" in the first week. By careful
manipulation, I found all the downies were very easily sexed, and even the
difficult tree ducks and swans presented no problem at all. In fact, the
swans were very much easier to sex as cygnets than when they were adoles-
cent or even adult.
There are obvious advantages in sexing and then pinioning downies, if
the males are pinioned on the right wing and the females on the left. Keep-
ing records every time young are pinioned and sexed will let the breeder
know the sex ratio of the young that are being reared. Also, when the
birds are caught up as adolescents, they do not have to be sexed as the pin-
ioning will show this. Many thousands of downies have been sexed in this
way and there have been no obvious injuries to the birds after establishing
their sex. Their eventual breeding has not been impaired. When I returned

M. LUBBOCK - VENT SEXING AND PINIONING
to the Wildfowl Trust in England, I introduced this sexing and pinioning
procedure there.
As mentioned previously, practice makes perfect, but it does not take
very much practice - say on some Mallard ducklings or Canadian goslings -
to become proficient. For the first 48 hours the yolk sac is still being
absorbed and to attempt to sex the young at this stage could result in
rupturing the sac. The downies, like the adult waterfowl, have a penis or
clitoris, which is usually very obvious. However, there are quite often
times when the penis cannot be seen, so the sexer immediately thinks the
bird is a female. One is far safer to look for the clitoris; if this is not
visible at all, then it is almost certain that the penis is hidden from view
and a closer inspection should reveal it.
Very occasionally one comes across a rather large clitoris and the
immediate reaction is that it is a small male; or on the other hand, a small
penis can be mistaken for a clitoris. The penis comes from the left of the
vent, the clitoris from the bottom centre of the vent. If these various
observations are followed, the sexer should never make too many mistakes.
It is not uncommon to find an hermaphrodite in waterfowl and this pre-
sents obvious difficulties, having both penis and clitoris visible. Occasionally
female sexed birds will take on the bright plumage of the male, but usually
not quite as bright. When the bird starts to change into the more colourful
plumage, the sexer will have doubts on his ability. However expert you
are, there are going to be a few mistakes.
Pinioning young is a very easy operation, but few people do it pro-
ficiently. It is unwise to pinion in the first couple of days after hatching
and they should be seen to be eating and content. In most cases, very
little bleeding occurs, although some species bleed far more than others.
Shelduck and sheldgeese are among these. The ideal time to pinion and sex
is on the 4th or 5th day after hatching. It is far better to pinion during the
coolest part of the day. If the young are being reared with a heat lamp, this
should be either switched off .or raised higher and excess water should be
taken out of the pen. The downies could become very wet and chilled
owing to the heat bulb being turned off or raised. When the young seem
settled again and there is no sign of bleeding (this could take two or three
hours), the heat lamps and water can be returned.
Nearly all cases of young dying after pinioning are due to a combina-
tion of stress brought on by handling, pinioning and overheating. They are
best placed in a cool dark brooder for two or three hours before being
returned to the rearing brooder. It is very important to cut the end of the
wing as close to the thumb, or bastard, as possible, with a diagonal cut as

shown in this diagram. This procedure is sometimes better done by two
people - one person holding the bird with one hand whilst the other hand
is left to hold the wing below the area that is to be cut, between the
thumb and forefinger. This will reduce the bleeding. Pressure should not
be released for at least a minute after the operation. I do not suggest that
you can necessarily pinion adults in this way. If in doubt about pinioning
you should consult your local veterinary practitioner.

BIRD FANCYING, FOE OF AVICULTURE
By DEREK GOODWIN (Petts Wood, Kent)
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999635277777778" page_id="56284490"  page_num="88" year="" vol="">
For the purposes of this article I define "Aviculture" as the keeping of
birds for reasons other than those of competitive showing or the produc-
tion of food or plumage. I define "Bird Fancying" as the keeping or breed-
ing of birds either for show or to conform with the standards by which
those birds are judged at shows and on which their value depends in the
eyes of fanciers.
I use the term "wild type" for a bird that resembles its wild ancestor
in shape and size, irrespective of its colour or pattern, and "wild colour
pattern" for a bird coloured and marked like the wild ancestor, regardless
of its shape and size.
I believe one aim of many aviculturists is, and should be, to perpetuate
captive (or semi-captive) stocks of many species of birds. I am not talking
here about "saving" species that are threatened with extinction in the wild
or mistakenly thought to be in that plight, but just perpetuating stocks of
some of the many attractive species that breed readily in captivity.
Further, to perpetuate them in a form very similar to the wild ancestor, at
least as far as size, shape and colour pattern are concerned. Inevitably,
there will be some "selection" for those individuals most adaptive to cap-
tive conditions. This may make the captive stock less viable in the wild,
should they be returned to it (though this is not always the case) but it
also makes them even easier to keep and breed and sometimes more ap-
pealing because of their greater "steadiness" and tameness. Provided a
plentiful stock of the wild colour pattern is maintained, I would not con-
demn the breeding of mutations in colour or pattern.
I believe that bird fancying is inimical to the above aim. That if not
opposed it will transmute our gold into dross or rather the offspring or
descendants of lovely creatures into unattractive monsters whose only
commendations are the prizes they win on the showbench and the money
they and their relatives are consequently worth to those who subscribe
to the fanciers' standards.
In the case of wild species at bird shows, the standards on which they
are judged usually do no more than demand that, other things being
equal , a large bird is better than one of normal size. A small enough step
but a step in the wrong direction. In practice, judges usually also favour
rarity per se (has any reader ever seen first prize in the "Jay, Magpie or
Chough" class at shows not won by a Chough, if a bird of that species was

in it?) but the show standards are not to blame for this quirk. Once a bird
breeds so freely in captivity and is so widely kept that it becomes domes-
ticated, or at least begins to become so, and is taken up by fanciers, the
scene is set for its rapid "improvement". We all nowadays know to our
cost that in politics, social services, housing, and the nationalised indus-
tries the bitter modern English saying "Improvement means deteriora-
tion"is almost always-true. It is true too when the fancier starts "improv-
ing" domesticated or semi-domesticated birds, at least from the point of
view of all who valued them for their natural beauty or other qualities.
There is one widespread fallacy that I should like to deal with first
because it tends to make people think there is no need to bother to per-
petuate birds of wild type and colour pattern. This is the idea that if
the fancier's misguiding hand is removed from any domestic stock, the
latter will very soon "revert to type" and produce creatures virtually id-
entical to their wild ancestors. Now this idea does embody a partial truth.
The more distorted breeds of domesticated animals cannot live in a feral
state and when domestic dogs, pigs, pigeons or any other creatures are
forced or choose to live a feral existence, such monsters as Pekinese,
Large Whites or show standard Oriental Frills soon die. To survive-under
such conditions, the first generation of ferals must have some generalised
resemblance to the ancestral form and there will be further selection in
the course of time, leading to some of these resemblances being accentua-
ted. But this does not usually, if ever, lead to the feral stock becoming
phenotypically identical to the wild ancestor either in type or colour
pattern. Pariah Dogs and Dingoes may look "a bit wolfish" but no one
could mistake them for their wild ancestor, the Wolf; where feral pigeons
derived from lost or strayed racing pigeons, they do not "revert" to the
head and bill shape of the Rock Dove. At least they have not done so
yet; what will happen in the course of the next fifty thousand years, if
there are then any dogs or pigeons left alive on the earth, who can say?
I must add a caveat that the above paragraph refers only to vertebrate
animals. I believe the situation is very different with plants.
So far from it being true that unless there is strong selection (by the
fancier) in other directions, domesticated birds will "revert" to the wild
type and colour pattern; there is circumstantial evidence to suggest that
where no deliberate selection is exercised, there is more likely to be some
divergence in the direction of larger and coarser-looking birds than the
majority of the wild ones. Some species (e.g. Mallard) seem more prone to
this than others (e.g. domestic pigeon) but a moderate amount of selection
by the breeder in the other direction is all that is needed to keep his stock

similar to the wild type.
I am, of course, not considering here birds that are kept for their flesh
or eggs. Obviously in such cases their appearance must be a secondary con-
sideration and to maintain close similarity to the wild type would be both
impossible and (literally) anti-productive in so far as it could be achieved.
Though it might be mentioned that show standards have proved equally
incompatible with the breeding of chickens, ducks, geese and pigeons for
"utility" purposes, as they have with pigeons bred for homing, high flying
or peculiarities of flight or voice.
However, I will now leave the domestic fowls and the more endearing
pigeon and consider how the Fancy has affected, or failed to affect, a few
species that are more generally thought of as cage or aviary birds.
The Canary Serinus canarius
By the latter part (at latest) of the last century, showing, and the dom-
inance of the showmen's ideas as to what constituted excellence were well
under way. One of the casualties of this and a good example (or rather
example) of the way in which true fanciers never rest content but ever
push to worse extremes, was the Norwich Canary. Originally this was a
shapely bird, not much different from the wild type, and bred for its
naturally rich golden-yellow colour (Wallace). Then some fanciers dis-
covered that feeding moulting birds with red pepper would produce orange
plumage, judges gave these artificially orange birds preference over natu-
rally golden yellow ones and both fanciers and judges favoured the largest
birds. The first loss was the bright golden yellow colour (Wallace), the ul-
timate result was what -we have today ( and have had since at least the
early 1930s to my knowledge), the hideous, beetle-browed, "feather dus-
ter" monster that has replaced the lively, lovely Canary of a century ago.
It is, I fear, about 20 years since I last went to the "Crystal Palace"
show but it then looked as if the Border Fancy, that at one time had been
a lively and shapely little Canary (well, "little" in comparison to such
breeds as Norwich and Yorkshires) was set, or had been set by its fanciers,
to go the same way as the Norwich went before it.
Two things appear, so far, to have stopped the domestic Canary from
(as yet) getting past the point of no return to wild type. Firstly, Roller
Canaries have long been bred and shown on a basis of their songs alone.
Nicolai, who has studied the Canary and allied species very intensively,
claims that the soft, sweet song of the Roller is in fact only produced by a
combination of selection of the best singers by man and (what would
otherwise be) defective feeding and close caging which weaken the con-

stitution of the bird. Be that as it may, Rollers have remained small
Canaries, not very dissimilar to the wild type. Secondly, the production of
red factor Canaries, initially through hybridisation with the Red Siskin
Spinus cucullatus. This has resulted in many very beautifully coloured
Canaries. I am unsure (perhaps some reader could enlighten us) whether
or to what extent the red (or more often boiled shrimp pink or deep
orange) colour is, even with these birds, the result of careful colour feed-
ing. All the few such "red" Canaries that I have bought have moulted out
yellow flushed with pale apricot or orange, when fed only on seeds, green-
food, fruit and egg food.. Be this as it may, most of the many red factor
Canaries that I have seen have been of wild type whatever their colour. As
long ago as the early 1960s, however, some fanciers were saying that it was
about time the red factors were bred for "type" (i.e. unnatural shape or
deformity) as well as colour, so perhaps before many years have past even
the red factor Canaries will no longer be things of beauty.
The Barbary Dove Streptopelia roseogrisea (formerly S. risoria)
Though there is some evidence as to when the Barbary Dove was first
known in England and western Europe, so far as I know, nothing definite
is known as to where or by whom it was first domesticated. The ordinary
"fawn" or "blond" variety is a "dilute" version of the wild colour pattern,
absolutely comparable with the similarly coloured pale variety of the
Collared Dove S. decaocto that has appeared among wild stocks in Britain
(Goodwin 1973). For long the white variety, which has dark eyes and the
neck ring in "water mark" was the only other colour generally available
although a few complete (red-eyed) albinos cropped up (presumably their
eyes were "white mouse red", not the rich scarlet of the "normal" fawn
variety). Some minor stir was made about 30 years ago over fawn birds
with white breasts but such of these parti-coloured birds that I saw did
not impress me. Their white breasts were patchy and by no means uni-
form in size or extent.
In recent years live specimens of the African Collared Dove, the wild
ancestral form, have been imported into the USA and, as a result of
crossing with domestic Barbaries, domestic birds of the wild colour and
some interesting new coloured Barbaries, in soft shades of pinkish and
lilac, have been produced. Mrs. Wilma Keppell has kindly sent me feathers
of some of these birds, from which it seems that they are very beautiful.
However, to get back to the theme of this article. The Barbary Dove
having never been a popular show bird and having (until recently across
the Atlantic) produced few colour varieties, has been altered relatively

little from the wild type.
So the Barbary stands out as a bird which, though long domesticated,
has only to a slight degree lost its original grace and delicacy of outline.
This happy situation may not last. I am told that dove addicts in the USA
and Canada now propose to set up a "show standard" for the bird. What
the standard will be (or now is) I do not know (can some of our trans-
Atlantic readers enlighten us?) but I fear the worst. So I would advise
lovers of the Barbary Dove as it was and still is to acquire a stock quickly
and refuse to entertain any idea of trying to breed them to any show
standard, good, bad or indifferent. Unfortunately the Barbary Dove seems
very little kept in Britain now (if I am wrong in this assumption, I shall be
delighted to be corrected by any of our readers with more up-to-date
information).
Its close relative the Collared Dove is now so abundant in much of
suburbia, and also in many rural districts and towns, that many people
naturally prefer the very little trouble (or none at all) needed to keep
free-flying Collared Doves around to the greater trouble of keeping "lib-
erty" Barbary Doves (Goodwin, 1952). While for those who wish to keep
doves in aviaries, the now quite domesticated Diamond Dove often seems
more attractive. But for those who want a naturally tame bird that is no
trouble to keep in cage or aviary and with some trouble can be flown at
liberty, and whose cooing is even more pleasing (at least to my ears) than
that of the Collared Dove, the Barbary Dove cannot be surpassed. How
nice it would be if Barbaries of the wild colour and of the new colours
could be imported from the USA and established here.
The Zebra Finch Poephila guttata
This pretty, interesting, hardy, amusing but acoustically unpleasing
little bird has not yet been ruined by the showmen but it may soon be.
The standard calls for a bird that is of the "Cobby" type (Rogers) and
the present day Norwich Canary shows where that sort of standard may
lead. Wild Zebra Finches have bright orange-red eyes (Immelman, pers.
obs.) whereas many or most "wild-coloured" domestic Zebra Finches have
duller, brownish eyes and these, presumably, are the "dark" eyes deman-
ded by the show standard (Lynch).
Immelmann describes various subtle differences between the plumages
of wild Zebra Finches and most wild-coloured domestic specimens. Whilst
I am not convinced (after examination of good series of wild specimens in
the British Museum) that all the wild Zebra Finches are quite so purely
grey on the upper parts or so spotlessly white on the lower breast and

belly as Immelmann states, I agree whole-heartedly with his appeal to
Zebra Finch breeders to try to breed their "wild type" specimens as close
to the real wild type as possible. His further recommendation, that show
standards for "wild type" Zebra Finches ought to correspond to the attri-
butes of the real wild type and colour pattern seems, alas, on a par with
saying that politicians ought always to tell the truth and to keep their
promises; impeccable as a moral maxim but never likely to carry the
slightest weight with the ladies and gentlemen at whom it is directed.
I have noticed that, whereas up until about 20 years ago, a majority of
the Zebra Finches one saw for sale in bird shops, markets and similar
"outlets" were wild-coloured ones, of recent years one sees a majority
of pieds, and of the self-coloured birds as many of the various dilute
shades as of wild-coloured. It, therefore, seems to me that anyone inter-
ested in the Zebra Finch as it originally was would be doing posterity a
service if he or she tried to breed at least some birds of as near the wild
type as possible and of the wild colour pattern.
It should be remembered that most of the "new colours" are recessive
to the wild colour pattern so that if the latter ever became extinct in
domestication, it could not be re-obtained by breeding from fawns,
creams, silvers, etc. Nor, since Australia has banned all exports of wild
birds, will it ever be possible to obtain fresh wild stock.
The Budgerigar Melopsittacus undulatus
As an admirer of the lively, beautiful, hardy, and naturally little para-
keet that so charmed our ancestors when it was first imported from Aus-
tralia, I view with horror the macrocephalous, blotch-faced, sluggish
travesties that win on the showbench and the showmen&amp;apos;s cast-offs and culls
that seem now almost the only Budgerigars to be found for sale. My
horror is, however, tinged with a grudging admiration that "The Fancy"
has done so much evil in so short a time.
For it seems that, judging by what I see in bird shops, public aviaries
and similar places, it is only in the past 25 years or so that the show type
Budgie has gained the ascendency and very largely ousted the more natural
type of bird. Whereas previously, show type Budgies "stood out like a sore
thumb" in the dealers&amp;apos; cages or in aviaries in public parks, now when one
sees an odd Budgie near to the wild type, with the natural pattern of
violet and black face spots instead of blurred blotches (clipped and plucked
to make super large spots for the showbench), it stands out like a healthy,
clean-skinned thumb among a multitude of swollen, sore ones, amidst its
companions.

It is easy to see how this has come about. Partly because so many
people in our insecure, conformist society are willing to believe, or pretend
to believe, whatever someone in authority tells them. This attitude makes
for an easier life in that it minimises the risk of arousing the spleen of the
hordes of officials and semi-officials now licensed to boss us around, but
unfortunately it carries over into realms, such as Budgerigar breeding,
where (at least as yet) no punishments can be inflicted on those who
choose to use their own judgement and to defy the opinions of "experts".
Partly, of course, it is a matter of money. Those who breed wild type
Budgerigars are likely to find, and presumably have found, that their
surplus birds are worth little or nothing, certainly much less than they
would get for "show stock". So they have little incentive to breed birds in
excess of their own needs. On the other hand, for competitive showing of
almost any creatures, very many have to be, or at any rate are bred to
obtain, a few winners. The large surplus goes "on to the market" and the
gullible are told that they are "better" than less unnatural specimens.
I must make it quite clear that the above diatribe is not to be inter-
preted as any attack on the breeding of Budgerigar colour mutations. On
the contrary, I think that some of these, such as sky blues, yellow-faced
blues, and evenly marked opalines are of great beauty and it would be a
pity not to perpetuate them. Some other colours, such as olives, white and
yellows, I find less pleasing but can appreciate that others may find beauty
in them. What I am against is the large size, unnatural proportions and
distorted facial markings that have been bred for, and are now possessed
by about 90 Budgies out of every hundred, solely in the cause of showing.
As in the case of the Zebra Finch, there is no possibility of ever again
obtaining wild Budgerigars from Australia. I gather from the literature,
and from the domestic Budgerigars I saw when in Australia in 1965 (when
I also saw lots of wild ones in the outback, so am not enthusing over them
in ignorance) that English show standards have, unfortunately, been sub-
scribed to both in Europe and in Australia itself.
However, there are certainly some, and in the aggregate perhaps very
many Budgies in this country that are fairly near the wild type and have
the wild facial pattern. Probably in parts of the world where showing is
less popular there are many more. So that if only a number of interested
aviculturists would co-operate, there is little doubt that it would be possible
to perpetuate wild type Budgerigars (of various colours). With a little
publicity as to what they were doing and why, they might even find that
there was a demand for their surplus stock. There can be little doubt that
in Britain many fewer people now keep either pet Budgerigars in their

houses or (which is much to be preferred) a number of Budgerigars in an
aviary or bird room, than did so 30 years ago. I suspect it Is not by chance
that the rise of the show type Budgerigar has coincided in time with a dec-
line in popularity of the bird as a house or garden pet or ornament. Sheer
aesthetic pleasure in the appearance of a bird is often what first starts a
person keeping it. And most modem Budgerigars seem less likely to excite
an uncorrupted asthetic sense than most of those of 30 years ago.
There are many other factors adverse to aviculture in Britain today. I
refrain from listing them, here as they are not the point of this article
which is to point out to all who admire the natural beauty of the birds
they keep, that the showman's standards, if they are so foolish as to be
influenced by them will ultimately destroy that beauty or at least distort
it into something very different from, and much inferior to what it origi-
nally was.

SUNBATHING BEHAVIOUR IN FIVE SPECIES OF IBISES
(THRESKIORNITHIDAE)
AT THE WALSRODE BIRD PARK, GERMANY

One of the great advantages offered by zoological gardens is the oppor-
tunity to observe animals' behaviour in far greater detail than would be
possible in the wild. The only record of sunbathing in ibises dates back to
Wackernagel (1964) who observed this behaviour in the Hermit Ibis. Little
work has been done on ibises generally and it is only in recent years that
studies have been made of the breeding behaviour of the Hermit Ibis
(Oliver, 1979; Schenker 1979, Schenker et al. 1980)and its handrearing
(Wennrich in press), as well as the pairing behaviour of the Hadada (Wenn-
rich 1981) and other studies (Archibald et al in press; Hirsch 1978, 1979,
and 1980).
The Threskiornithidae collection at the Walsrode Bird Park is quite
remarkable; it consists of:

On 2nd and 3rd September 1980 and in spring 19811 observed sunbath-
ing behaviour in five species of our collection - the Hermit Ibis, the Black
Ibis, the Hadada, the Puna Ibis and the Glossy Ibis.
On 2nd September at midday the Hermit Ibis was resting with both
feet standing on a ledge in a large outside aviary exposing its right side to
the sun. The posture is shown in Fig. 1. The feathers of the nape and hind

neck, the breast and belly were fluffed. After approximately one minute
the bird exposed its back and uropygial gland to the sun, squeezed the
uropygial gland with its beak and then preened for several minutes. The
air temperature was about 22.5*C in the shade. The Hermit Ibis observed
by Wackernagel (1964) opened both wings to form a semi-circle and ex-
posed its underwing coverts to the sun.
The Black Ibis (Fig. 2) was seen standing on its left foot on the grass of
an outside aviary, exposing its right side and the underwing coverts of the
left wing to the sun. The right foot was withdrawn, the body and head
were bent a little to the left side. After seven minutes, the bird placed the
right foot on to the ground and after a further three minutes, the ibis
adopted a normal posture and started to preen. The air temperature was
about 22.0*C in the shade.
The Hadada was feeding on the grass of our large free flight aviary.
The air temperature was about 23.0*C in the shade. The bird suddenly
stopped feeding, raised its head and adopted a posure with the right
wing fully spread and extended horizontally from the body (Fig. 3).
The left wing was dropped so that the primaries touched the ground.
The bird was facing the sun. After three and a half minutes the bird
moved and adopted a different sunbathing posture (Fig. 4). The bird
exposed the left side of its head, neck, back, right wing and part of its
left wing to the sun. The right wing was displayed and more extended
from the body than the left wing which was closer to the sun. After
sunbathing in this posture for about three minutes, the Hadada erected
its feathers, adopting a normal posture, shook its tail and continued
feeding.
The Puna Ibises were kept together with the Black Ibis and some
other ibis species. When sunbathing occurred, the air temperature
was 22.5*C in the shade. The bird stood with its feet in the grass in
the middle of the outdoor aviary, bent its head and body to the right
side, erected its neck feathers and raised its left wing fully upwards
(Fig. 5). In this position the sun's rays reached the left side of the head,
the neck, chin, throat, breast, belly, left underwing coverts and part of
the right underwing coverts. This lasted for one to two minutes; often
it was less than a minute. The withdrawal of the extended wing took
about four to five seconds and was slower than the initial spreading.
After withdrawing the wing, the bird often continued sunbathing for
several minutes. During this period one wing might be raised again.
During a period of 15 minutes, wing-raising (Fig. 5) occurred five times.
After sunbathing, the bird started to preen and often resumed sun-
bathing behaviour again.

The Glossy Ibises were kept together with the Hermit Ibises. These
birds were very often seen sunbathing this spring at quite low tempera-
tures of about 17*C in the shade. The sunbathing behaviour of the
Glossy Ibises (Fig. 6) was very similar to the sunbathing of the Puna
Ibis except that sometimes the Glossy Ibises stood on one leg.
It is strange that we have not observed sunbathing in the other ibis
species to date. We hope to learn more about this behaviour and its
importance for the ibises in the near future.

Brian Boswell is the fifth generation of the famous Boswell circus
family to be actively engaged in that field. Currently he is the managing
director of the Natal Lion Park at Umlaas Road. Animals are his vocation
and birds, especially parrotlike, are his hobby. His huge collection is not
open to the general public, but he is often willing to take bom fide enthu-
siasts to his home to view his parrot collection. He is married to Jane
Stockley who comes from the seventh generation of the equally famous
circus family of Chipperfield, which is particularly well known in England,
and she is highly successful at hand-rearing baby macaws and cockatoos,
some of which she is busy training for a circus act.
There are fewer lorikeets in the collection than some years ago but, on
my recent visit, I saw a pair of Dusky with three lusty chicks on the
perch, a pair of Chattering had one chick, bringing their total to ten, a
pair of Moluccan or Red has produced 14 chicks in four years, and a pair
of Black has bred successfully.
The impressive run of cockatoos includes a male Palm, one pair of
Galahs, still juvenile, two male and one female Leadbeater's from which
have come ten eggs without issue, one Greater Sulphur-crested, one pair of
Medium Sulphur-crested, two pairs of Triton Blue-eyed from which a
single chick was bred in 1979, two pairs of Timor Lesser Sulphur-crested
which breed regularly and had two currently bred chicks, one pair of Cit-
ron-crested which produce one or two chicks annually, one pair of
Salmon-crested or Moluccan which got as far as hatching chicks, as have
the two pairs of White or Umbrella, one pair of Goffin's which has bred
for four years, usually two at a time, one pair each of Little Corellas and
Slender-billed Corellas which have produced nothing in four years, and a
single Red-vented Cockatoo.
The Boswell collection has been concentrated on the parrots not freely
available and consequently the Australian parrakeets are not strongly
represented. Of the Rosellas, there are pairs of Golden-mantled and the
mutation with the red belly, the Yellow Rosella and a pair of Pennant's
which produced two, then six, then five chicks last summer. One pair of
Amboina Kings has long failed to breed, and pairs of Red-capped or Pilea-
ted Parrakeets, Barnard's and Rock Pebblers either made no attempt to
breed or laid infertile eggs possibly because they were first season birds.
A pair of Princess of Wales did better with five chicks. Three pairs of

Eclectus produced four chicks.
A pair of African Grey Parrots made an attractive sight with their
latest two babies. Their previous breeding record is good:- 1977-1, 1978-2,
1979-2, 1980-3. There is also a pair of the distinct Maroon-tailed or Tim-
neh subspecies, which has not started to breed yet. A pair of our local
Brown-headed Parrots has surprisingly made no attempt to nest.
The only Ring-necked Parrakeets that Boswell keeps is the African sub-
species, which is smaller than the Indian and has a blacker and neater beak.
To me it is the more attractive of the two forms and it breeds as easily.
Fortunately in this collection there seems to be a viable breeding stock of
them.
I noticed an extremely prolific breeding flock of pure Black-cheeked
Lovebirds. In contrast, the Grey-headed or Madagascars have practically
died out.
It is in the field of American parrots, the Amazons in particular, that
this collection shines and where the most interesting breeding results are to
be reported. In macaws, the Boswells own what is thought to be the only
Lear's in the country, a male, a pair of Hyacinthine of which the hen has
laid eggs four times with no result possibly because the male is not mature
enough, a pair of Blue and Yellow with the following breeding record:
1979 - 1, 1980 - 3, and two are now nearly successfully hand-reared, three
pairs of Green-winged from one pair of which two chicks have just been
fully hand-reared, four Scarlets which regrettably have proved to be all
males, hopefully a true pair of the extremely rare Red-fronted, a pair of
Illiger's which has just produced two offspring, and a good breeding pair
of Yellow-collared with the following record: 1979 - 3, 1980 - 2, and
1981-3.
Pride of place among the conures is surely held by the two magnificent
Queen of Bavaria's, which it is hoped will prove a pair. There is a breeding
colony of Black-headed and much breeding success has also attended a
colony of eight Patagonian Conures. In fact, two or even three hens have
reared successfully together in one nest. A pair of Golden-capped has pro-
duced eggs, two pairs of Sun Conures have bred prolifically for years, as
have two pairs of the delightful little Green-cheeked from a single pair of
which no less than 32 young have so far been obtained.
A particularly noteworthy success has been the repeated breeding of
the Thick-billed Parrot, that gorgeous creature from Mexico, its deep red
forehead like the richest velvet and contrasting so wonderfully with its
dark green body. This avian jewel is now an endangered species. The pair
first bred two in 1978, lost their chicks in 1979, reared two in 1980 and

one in 1981 which I saw shortly after it left the nest. It had the colours
of the adult, but a white beak. A "pair" of youngsters further down the
row has made no attempt to nest and could prove to be two males. This
species is not sexually dimorphic. Surprisingly, they are autumn breeders
here.
Another noteworthy success is with the delightful docile little Pileated
Parrot Pionopsitta pileata from South-east Brazil. A green bird with bright
scarlet head, it has the added advantage of being readily sexable as the hen
is entirely green. Such dimorphism has the result of making the species
extremely attractive as a pair. They do not appear at all aggressive and a
trio of two males and a female in one aviary had four young just out on
the perch. Two other pairs had also bred well over the past three years.
Black-headed Caiques seem possibly to breed best in a little colony.
They are difficult to sex. A trio of three adults had three young and they
have produced five over the last four years. A pair on their own had got no
further than laying eggs. There are three White-bellied Caiques in the col-
lection, but they have not bred.
It is easiest to record the results the Boswells have obtained with the
genera Pionus and Amazona in tabular form.

An infinite variety of nest boxes is used to suit the needs of this large
collection. However, it is worth mentioning that extensive use is made of
hollow stumps of the sisal plant which are obtainable from farmers in this
country. These large stumps make very attractive nesting sites for many
parrotlike birds and contribute towards achieving success, especially with a
species like the Black-headed Caique.
Feeding is kept as simple as possible. Sunflower seed is the basic diet
but soaked dog biscuits are fed wet every day. Fruit such as apples,
oranges and pears, is fed liberally as are carrots and spinach. The numerous
successes being achieved in this great collection must prove that the birds
are receiving a balanced diet.

CRANES IN ASIAN ZOOS, 1981

By Dr. GEORGETTE K. MAROLDO
(Texas Lutheran College, Seguin, Texas, USA)
Many species of Asiatic cranes are endangered in the wild, especially
the Eastern Sarus Grus antigone sharpii, Siberian Grus leucogeranus , Red-
crowned or Manchurian Grus japonensis , Black-necked Grus nigricollis
and Hooded Crane Grus monacha (Scott, 1974). The Common Grus grus,
White-naped Grus vipio and Demoisell eAnthropoides virgo are less threat-
ened. As the cranes' native habitats dwindle, zoos and other refuges may
prove to be their only chance of survival.

Like those of cranes everywhere, the habitats of Asian cranes have been
reduced in recent years because of human expansion and settlement. To
make matters worse, tourists have begun to invade even the remote terri-
tories of these seclusive birds, with the result that current breeding and
wintering grounds are hard to locate. In the past, Eastern Sarus flourished
from West Pakistan to distant Indochina; now, their status is unknown. Si-
berian Cranes were found in East and West Siberia and now, since they are

generally threatened throughout the area, international co-operation be-
tween the USSR, North and South Korea, China, Japan and India has been
inaugurated. The Avicultural Magazine (1931, p.186) reported that Flint
had discovered 26 Siberian Crane nests in the tundra of Yakutia. A late
1980 count, says Freeman (1981) lists 16 birds in Iran, 34 have survived in
Afghanistan, and 100 have been cited in the marshes near the Yangtze
river in China. Red-crowned Cranes continue to nest in a small area from
the Ussuri northward in Manchuria. Another group remains in Hokkaido,
Japan. Some may still be found in the Amur region, and in Korea. On 26th
June 1981, the Hongkong Standard disclosed that Red-crowned Cranes
were breeding in marshlands in western Jilin province, and in Zalong
Nature Reserve, China. The Black-necked breed in Tibet, from Ladakh to
Lake Koko Nor, Tsinghai plateau in northern China, and, according to
Taylor (1981), they were found recently to winter in Kweichou province.
Lake Koko Nor Refuge has been designated a protected area for these
cranes. However, discoveries of oil in the Koko Nor basin have led to grow-
ing industrialisation. Makatsch (1972) reports that Hooded Cranes breed
from the steppes between the Irtysh and Ob rivers in western Siberia, east-
ward to the Amur region. The Brolga Bugle (1981) reported the 1980 win-
ter count: 4,200 Hooded Cranes in Izumi, Japan.
Asian cranes ranging in height from just less than 150 cm (Eastern
Saras) to 115 cm (Hooded) are vulnerable birds. Because of their size,
they are especially in peril during migration when weather, power lines,
and hunters reduce their numbers. In wartime, too, they are easy targets.

Although it is becoming accepted that some form of captivity is neces-
sary to safeguard endangered cranes, only certain species can be located at
certain of the world&amp;apos;s zoos and sanctuaries. Walsrode Bird Park in West
Germany exhibits all crane species except the Whooping Grus americana
and Black-necked, Maroldo (1980) could not find Siberian, Red-crowned
or Black-necked Cranes in North American zoos but they are to be found
in Asian zoos, closer to their original habitats, and during the summer of
1981 I observed Asian cranes at principal zoos in Taiwan, Hong Kong,
China,Okinawa and mainland Japan where concerted efforts are being
made to preserve species in captivity.
The Taipei Zoological Gardens were recovering from several days of
heavy spring rains in late May. The only Asian cranes observed were three
Saras in a centrally located aviary. They appeared to be in good health, in
spite of crowded conditions.

Nothing unusual was observed at the enclosures of the Hooded and
White-naped Cranes during a first visit on 2nd June to the Hong Kong
Zoological and Botanical Gardens. Heavy foliage at the rear of their enc-
losure made it difficult to observe the behaviour of the White-naped
Cranes. Several weeks later, these cranes were seen hovering over a healthy-
looking rusty chick about one-week old. The parents were very active,
jabbing at the earth, picking up tidbits, and offering them in turn to their
offspring. These procedures were all carried out with ease, beak to beak.
White-naped Cranes were seen swimming swan-like across a lake at
Ocean Park Ltd., in Hong Kong - such swimming is a rare sight at any zoo.
Deeper into the park, Sarus and White-naped Cranes shared a lake at
Waterfall Gardens, and a pair of Hooded Cranes were seen there in a grassy
enclosure.
The Peking Zoological Gardens, like zoos everywhere, had good and
bad enclosures and construction underway. Moreover, this zoo, like others
in China, seemed intent on the conservation and economic use of water
against frequent dry spells. This was evident in the overall design and lay-
out of the zoo, which incorporated much planned foliage and forestation,
and in enclosures requiring constant water supply.
A peninsula jutting out into a large lake at the centre of the zoo
contained eight species of crane: Sarus, Siberian, Red-crowned, Black-
necked, White-naped, Common, East African Crowned, and Demoiselle.
There appeared to be a good number of each species intermingling and
sharing the same space, although they tended to cluster from time to time
according to kind. Apart from relatively free groupings, several cranes were
enclosed: some Black-necked, White-naped and East African Crowned.
Throughout the peninsula, a pecking order could be discerned, beginning
with the Sarus chasing the Red-crowned and following with the White-
naped driving off the lone Black-necked. As expected, size was the deter-
mining factor, most cranes tending to be aggressive, territorial and solitary.
Unison calling was frequent and widespread, aggravated by the number of
cranes in a relatively small area.
Three very rare Black-necked Cranes were viewed in an enclosure divi-
ded by a partition, through which they moved freely. One of them tended
to stand apart, occasionally beak fencing with one of the other two, an
obvious pair. However, if they are the same birds observed by Archibald
(1980) in 1979, which he reports as female, sexual pairing was not taking
place. At the end of my visit, a White-naped Crane was observed flying to
an island in the middle of the lake.
The next step was the (Jinan) Tsinan Golden Bull Park zoo in mid-

June. Although there was some construction in progress elsewhere in this
zoo, the crane enclosures (5m x 5m x 3m) were old and inadequate. A
pair of Red-crowned Cranes shared a half full bucket of water in a con-
crete-floored cage. Their plumage was dirty and dull, probably because of
the scarcity of accessible water. Corn was scattered throughout the area,
and there was a bowl of fish bits nearby. Other Asian cranes were in simi-
lar enclosures, with the exception of three Common and one White-naped
roaming around a central lake.

It was impossible to determine what cranes were kept at the Qingdao
Zhushuishan Park because half of the zoo was under expansion and new
construction.
Cranes, at the Shanghai Xijiao Park zoo, were housed in concrete-
floored aviary type enclosures, with depressions in the forward area that
could be filled with water. A Black-necked and a Demoiselle quietly shared
one enclosure, while about ten Common Cranes moved about restlessly in
another nearby. Straw mats covered the entire front part of the Red-
crowned Crane enclosure, possibly to accommodate one of the cranes with
an obvious leg and gait disorder. Several White-naped Cranes were seen
elsewhere. All of the cranes at this zoo appeared to be in good condition.
The behaviour of an East African Crowned Crane at the Okinawa Zoo-
logical Park, at the end of June, proved remarkable. It charged and
pursued relentlessly pairs of Common, Sarus and Demoiselle Cranes
throughout the large walkthrough flying cage.
Most of the cranes at the Ueno Zoological Gardens in Tokyo were
exhibited in typical aviary-type enclosures with grass and foliage and small
pools. The only Asian cranes were a pair of Red-crowned, several lone
White-naped and a pair of Hooded Cranes.
At the Higashiyama Zoological Gardens in Nagoya in mid-July, Red-
crowned, White-naped and Sarus were observed. Pairs of Common and
Hooded Cranes, gifts from China, were in apparent high spirits, though one
Hooded had an eye missing.
Kyoto Municipal Zoo, in a woodland setting, proudly exhibited two
rust-coloured Red-crowned chicks, hatched on 31st May and 20th June.
In the vicinity, Sarus Cranes were brooding an egg on a few straws.
The Asa Zoological Park in Hiroshima had a few non-Asian cranes -
Stanley Anthropoides paradisea and Crowned.
The older Fukuoka Municipal Zoo housed several Sarus, Common,
and Demoiselle Cranes in a mountainous, rustic setting. Two Crowned
Cranes were seen standing on the upper branches of trees, which is a
rare sight (they are the only cranes which do this).
At the Hirakawa Zoological Park in Kagoshima, in the last week of
July,several Sarus, Hooded, Common and Demoiselle cranes were obser-
ved in a large aviary (flying cage). Common and White-naped Cranes were
exhibited elsewhere in smaller makeshift structures. All appeared healthy
despite some shagginess. One White-naped had parts of its upper bill
missing, but this did not deter pecking.
A return to Taiwan in August involved a visit to Peacock Park at Sun
Moon Lake. Here a lone Common Crane was noted among several pea-

1981 was a typical year in many ways with its normal quota of frustra-
tion and success. A breakdown in an incubator at a critical period which
caused the deaths of a number of developing embryos was the greatest
disappointment. Even so, a considerable number of eggs were successfully
incubated artificially and many young were subsequently reared. They in-
cluded Black-footed Penguins, Sacred Ibis, Grey-headed Gulls, Grey-headed
Gallinules, ducks, pheasant and quail
Among the species which successfully reared their young, the most
noteworthy included Night Herons, Abdim's Storks, Jerdon's Imperial

displays in the gardens, and normally in the summer there are a number of
young being reared by their parents. In 1981, to our horror, all seven
young were killed by a predator. They were taken after they had left the
vicinity of the nest, and almost certainly were killed by Herring Gulls.
These gulls recently began to nest close to the Zoo, and certain individuals
have developed the habit of killing and eating young birds. It is a problem
which is likely to recur, and one which is going to be difficult to solve.
A number of useful exchanges have been made with other collections,
and we have received 2 Long-legged Buzzards, 2 Rusty Barred Owls, 2 Teng-
maim's Owls, an Egyptian Vulture, and a Fraser's Eagle Owl. Other interes-
ting species brought into the collection have included Least Seedsnipe,
Black-bellied Seedcrackers, Gold-billed Ground Doves, African Thrushes,
Great Green Leafbirds, Black-throated Laughing Thrushes, a Chestnut-
capped Laughing Thrush, and a Silver-beaked Tanager.
Two Eastern White Pelicans were presented, probably with some relief,
by the Department of the Environment. They had caused embarrassment
and some horror by eating live birds in St. James's Park. Now they have
joined our colony of pelicans, they do not have the opportunity to carry
on their unpleasant feeding habits.
The old Cockatoo Aviary, now called the Clock Tower Aviary, has been
landscaped and renovated. It will contain birds of the Australasian region.
The oldest bird in the Zoo is a Sulphur-crested Cockatoo named
"Cocky" who was presented in 1925. It has now been established, via
members of the family who gave "Cocky" to the Zoo, that he had been
with the family since the beginning of the century. He is, therefore, at
least 80 years old. Though he is now definitely showing signs of age, he
still talks, loves company and is reasonably active. For the present, he is
living "behind the scenes" where he has the constant attention and com-
pany of the keepers.

Most notable among our acquisitions was a pair of Congo Peacocks, on
loan from Antwerp Zoo. These remarkably calm birds have settled in to
our African jungle exhibit. Last year, we reared two chicks from a total of
12 eggs in three clutches. The hen produced four eggs in early 1982 and
we are currently rearing two chicks. Our experience with this species dates
back to 1949, when four males and a female were imported. Unfortunately
the female was elderly and soon assumed male plumage. The last of this
group remained in the collection until 1968. We are very pleased to be able
to work with this species again and to co-operate with the Antwerp Zoo.
We obtained a dozen Humboldt's Penguins and two pairs of Argentin-
ian Ruddy Ducks to inhabit our outside flight cage along with Inca Terns,
Silver Gulls, Andean Gulls and Guanay Cormorants. The flight cage,
built in 1898, has just been redeveloped as a sea bird island, modelled after
colonies on the Argentine coast.
Once again, we reared young Andean Condors without human contact,
using condor-head puppets. These birds were not, however, sent to join the
four handreared Condors released last year near the Peruvian coast and
now flying free with wild Condors. It was feared that the release process
for new birds might interfere with the growing independence of last year's
birds. This year's young birds will enter captive-breeding programmes.

A DISSENTING VIEW ON AVICULTURE
By ALASTAIR MORRISON (Canberra, Australia)
I was sorry to read the article on Breeding the Horned Parrot by
Dr. H. Quinque in the October/December 1980 issue of the Avicultural
Magazine. In my opinion, this is not a species that should be kept in
captivity at all. Although the nominate form is not listed as endangered
in the Red Data Book of the International Union for the Conservation of
Nature, it is potentially endangered. I am sure that the French Govern-
ment would never permit an equally rare and unique bird to be kept in
captivity if it were confined to the mountains of the Auvergne. And it
needs to be remembered that New Caledonia is not a newly independent
third world country but a Department of France.
The article refers to the Uvaean subspecies being kept in captivity in
Europe. It is monstrous that this should be so. It is a critically endangered
bird. The total population was estimated at no more than 200 in 1974.
Attempts to transplant the form to other islands in 1925 and 1963 have
been unsuccessful. Despite its rarity, the bird has quite recently been the
subject of scandalous depredation by wealthy German aviculturists.
I am well aware that the response of some aviculturists will inevitably
be that owners of Horned Parrots are really protecting the birds by main-
taining stocks in captivity. It is all for their own good. Aviculturists have
been saying this sort of thing for the last half century. The argument may
be true in the case of a few easily kept animals and birds though domesti-
cation often leads to mutation so that the captive birds become very
different to their wild ancestors. But generally when I have looked into
it, it have found that this is a very weak argument, seeking a philosophical
and pseudo-scientific justification for a form of personal aggrandisement
that is morally and scientifically indefensible. This particularly applies to

species that are difficult to keep and/or breed in captivity and no more
so than species such as the Horned Parrot and the various large Antillean
Amazon Parrots.
Except in a very tiny number of cases where propagation in captivity
has been undertaken as part of a co-ordinated operation to reintroduce
captive-bred birds to the wild, I am sure that the only hope for such birds
is for viable populations to be maintained and protected in protected
natural habitats. If that cannot be achieved, they will become extinct. And
the deplorable thing is that not only can avicultural demand lead to a
reduction of numbers in the wild, but that the phoney conservation-
through-aviculture argument can lead to reduced effort to maintain
dwindling natural habitats.
Leaving aside these aspects of the situation one can perhaps make out a
theoretical argument for maintaining endangered species permanently in
captivity. But the argument to be effective presupposes three things:
Equal skills of the highest order on the part of those holding the
birds,
That this factor should be matched by complete continuity, and
Unlimited financial resources.
These provisos are unattainable nor are the possessors of endangered
species necessarily interested in doing anything of the sort. A much more
dominant motive is that of the collector seeking rarity and primarily
impelled by pride of possession. This is a fairly harmless motive when it
comes to the honest acquisition of paintings or porcelain, netsuke or
primitive African art or other inanimate desiderata. Indeed the public
often benefits because pride of possession may be perpetuated by the
bequest of collections to public institutions as memorials to the public
spirit/acquisitive instincts of the collector. But this is simply impossible
with live animals and especially rare parrots.
I speak as one with a life long interest in aviculture. I owned my first
foreign birds at the age of 11. As a schoolboy and university student, I
used to scour the London bird shops in search of the unusual. I was
fascinated by the careers of the great collectors - Goodfellow and Frost,
Webb and Shaw-Mayer - and sought, not without some modest success,
to become a collector myself. I set out to specialise in South American
waterfowl and was on my third expedition - to Peru- when the war put
paid to all thoughts of such a career. My collecting activities were fol-
lowed by a long residence in Asia. I have been a member of the Society
for over 50 years.
In pre-war days, rare birds too were in demand but rarity generally

did not mean the same as it does today. Few species were endangered in
the wild and rarity generally meant that the bird came from somewhere
inaccessible or lacking any trade in birds. At a very early age I came to
realise that the question of rarity posed a problem in semantics com-
pounded by ignorance on the part of those buying allegedly rare birds
and sound commercial instincts on the part of those selling them. Alleged
rarity was a valuable selling point and no doubt still is.
The situation today is very different to what it was in the Thirties.
The greed of those who keep animals and birds has enormously increased
while population and business pressures have resulted in appalling habi-
tat destruction. The vast colonial empires of Britain, France and Holland
have been replaced by a proliferation of new states where colonial ideas
of fauna preservation no longer apply. The most dramatic example of
this is the case of the Gorilla. When in the Thirties the London Zoo ob-
tained the pair named Mok and Moina, there* were only about half a
dozen of these animals in captivity in the entire world. Large feral popu-
lations were strictly protected by the British and French colonial powers.
Nowadays the competitive greed of zoos and the decline in standards of
conservation in Africa has led to the total in captivity becoming several
hundred - most of them involving the slaughter of the animal's mother -
while the number in the wild has been catastrophically reduced. The
number of species under threat has grown enormously. Rarity now means
absolute rarity.
While the greed of those who keep animals and birds has bounded
ahead, air transport has made importation much easier. The trade in live
animals and birds has become big business. It always was a cruel trade -
the mortality is very high. How many aviculturists can honestly say that
they have never been guilty of callousness - picking out the healthy birds
in a dealer's cage while leaving the rest to die miserably?
Is not the time long overdue for the Avicultural Society and its members
to take candid stock of the situation? Why in fact do we keep birds?
Primarily I would say because of the pleasure that we gain from the closer
company of beautiful living things and the satisfaction that we derive from
caring for them. There have, of course, been cases where aviculturists have
made useful contributions towards the study and understanding of bird
behaviour but such activities are unusual. And some may genuinely
believe - though the belief is subsidiary to pride of possession - that they
are performing a worthy conservationist role.
But aviculturists should realise that they are viewed with much distaste
by ornithologists and by many members of the public. If they are to con-

tinue to enjoy a pleasant hobby, it is essential that they should play an ac-
tive and positive role both in conservation and improvement to the trade
in birds. If the Society is to enjoy respect it should have positive and
clearly stated policies in these matters. At the very least, the Society
should publish in the Magazine a list of bird species held to be endangered
by the IUCN. Except as part of a co-ordinated conservation programme
endorsed by the International Council for Bird Preservation, the possession
of such species should be firmly discouraged by the Society and the sub-
sequent importation of such species should result in expulsion from the
Society. The Society should be active in urging overseas governments to
protect the habitats and remaining wild stocks of endangered species. And
the British Government and other western governments should be urged to
tighten up drastically on the importation of birds. Importation should be
by licence only including movement between countries in the EEC and
should be under the strictest conditions.
Such policies would not spell the end of aviculture. Apart from enhan-
cing the standing of the Avicultural Society, its result would be to make
even common species more difficult to obtain and more desirable in the
eyes of those who want to keep them. There would be far more interest in
the propagation of easily bred stocks in captivity. This has happened to
some extent in Australia where a number of foreign species are still avail-
able though their importation has been banned for years. Many more
would be available if Australian aviculturists had responded to the bans
promptly.
But unless aviculturists take and support positive initiatives they will
continue to be held in a wide measure of disrepute. They will be regarded
in the world of conservation and ornithology as selfish and egotistical and
as direct contributors to the destruction of bird life and the extinction of
some of the most marvellous handiwork of our Creator.

I have a great respect for the views of Alastair Morrison whose articles
in the Avicultural Magazine I can remember reading with great interest
when I first joined the Society more than 30 years ago. However, I do not

that should be kept in captivity at all" any more than I did with his
opinion (Avicultural Magazine 82, p. 117, 1976) that the Hooded and
Golden-shouldered Parrots should rank high on a list of species unsuitable
for aviculture. Recently I saw specimens of the Homed Parrot in aviaries
on the continent where they were breeding successfully and, with their
tameness, confidence and beauty, appeared to be ideal subjects for avicul-
ture. In their behaviour they resemble Cyanoramphus parrots which,
through the efforts of aviculturists throughout the world, are now well
known in captivity although they are not very common in their natural
habitat. Those ornithologists who take a disparaging view of aviculture
frequently state, without a shred of evidence, that the survival of this or
that species is threatened by aviculture. In the 1930s, Cayley attempted to
explain the rarity of the Splendid, Turquoisine and Bourke&amp;apos;s Parrot on the
activities of bird trappers and yet these three species are now not only very
common in captivity but have also reappeared in the wild. It is man&amp;apos;s
exploitation of their environment which will lead to the disappearance of
numerous avian species. Surely, it is better to preserve those we can as
breeding stock in aviaries than as preserved specimens in museums.

From Rosemary Low, New Barnet, Hertfordshire.
Much of what Mr. Morrison has written would have been true 20 years
ago. He does not reside in Europe and it seems that he is out of touch with
the current avicultural climate here.
Let us consider the various points he has made. First, the "monstrous"
fact of the Uvaean Parrakeet Eunymphicus comutus uvaeensis being kept
in captivity in Europe. I find it more monstrous that until legislation pre-
vented it in the early 1970s, many of these parrakeets were taken from the
nest for the local pet trade. These birds were denied the chance to breed,
whereas breeding would be the only aim of any European aviculturist in
possession of this species. "Conservationists" who attempted to preserve
Uvaean Parrakeets by "transplanting" them to other islands showed an as-
toundingly poor knowledge of their behaviour: the birds simply flew back
to Quvea.
Had some of those parrakeets, which spent their lives as pets, been

available to responsible European aviculturists, I believe that a thriving
captive-bred population would exist now.
The Eunymphicus species are very closely related to the Cyanoramphus
parrakeets - and Dr. Quinque has produced hybrids between the two.
There is every reason to believe that they would prove as free-breeding as
their New Zealand counterparts . One of these, the Red-fronted Kakariki
C. novaezelandiae , is officially classified as endangered. However, within
the space of a single decade, in European aviculture their status has altered
from an almost unknown rarity to an inexpensive and free-breeding
species. As an example of the efficiency of aviculturists, in 1958 there
were 103 Red-fronted Kakarikis in collections in New Zealand, after
authorities there decided to issue permits to allow a few aviculturists to
keep them. In six years, breeding was so successful that the number had
increased to 2,500.
I sincerely believe that pairs of Uvaean and Horned Parrakeets in cap-
tivity are the best insurance against the species' extinction. I state this ad-
visedly because I do not believe that it is true of all bird species.
Secondly, Mr. Morrison speaks of the desirability of protecting endan-
gered species in their natural habitat. Of course, this is desirable - in a Uto-
pian world - but we have reached the point where we can no longer delude
ourselves that this is feasible where many forest-dwelling species are con-
cerned. Their forests are being felled at a terrifying rate - including those
on Ouvea.
Mr. Morrison's statement that aviculture can lead to a reduction of
numbers of birds in the wild is absolutely true. It is something that must
be guarded against. Aviculturists must take a responsible attitude - and if
it is true that wealthy individuals have offered large sums for endangered
species, this can have far-reaching consequences on dwindling wild popula-
tions. In addition, they can throw the whole of aviculture into disrepute,
nullifying the efforts of the most dedicated aviculturists.
I do not believe, however, that the "phoney conservation-through-
aviculture argument can lead to reduced efforts to maintain dwindling
natural habitats." Possibly it might be given as an excuse by countries
in which conservation takes a very low priority if, indeed, there is any
conservation programme at all. But as a general argument, it would not be
very convincing, since in any avifauna, only a small percentage of species
are held in aviculture. (We must consider the fact that the number of bird
species kept in captivity is but a minute percentage of the total. Repre-
sentatives of many, many genera are entirely unknown in captivity.)
Mr. Morrison believes that the possessors of endangered species are

primarily impelled by pride of possession. This is no doubt true of some
individuals - usually those whose interest in anything is maintained for
but a short time. However, this statement does a grave injustice to the
many genuine aviculturists whose desire to build up captive stocks of
rare or endangered species far exceeds that for any personal recognition.
At the outset, pride of possession may be very strong, but this soon
gives way to a feeling that the only justification for keeping such birds
is that one is laying the foundations for future generations - of that
species and for aviculturists.
Again, I agree with Mr. Morrison that a disadvantage of the possession
of endangered species by private aviculturists can be found when we look
at the question of continuity. But this is not insurmountable. It is vitally
important that all who keep rare and endangered species should nominate
a zoo, or other organisation, or a responsible aviculturist, to receive all
the birds in the event of his death. In all cases the individual or organisa-
tion must be one that has experience of breeding the species in question,
or one which is closely related. Dispersal of a breeding group of an en-
dangered species could mean the end of a valuable breeding programme.
Mr. Morrison spoke of the appalling worldwide habitat destruction of
new states whose colonial ideas of fauna preservation no longer apply and
of the increasing number of threatened species. Unfortunately, we all
know that they can only continue to increase and that in some areas the
natural habitat of a species has simply ceased to exist. When this happens
there are only two alternatives: a species either becomes extinct or it is
maintained in captivity.
As recently as the past decade, veterinary and technological develop-
ments have resulted in the captive breeding of birds being elevated from
a hobby to a science. Rapid inauguration of techniques, such as surgical
or faecal analysis sexing, spectral analysis and the careful formulation of
commercial diets, have vastly increased the efficiency of aviculture. This
is only the start: future developments will remove much of the risk ele-
ment from captive breeding. We must now lay the foundation for that
era, in the near future, when many birds will be more secure in captivity
than in the wild.

The news of the sudden death of Jack Death, from a heart attack, has
come as a sad shock to his many friends in the Avicultural Society, of
which he had been a member since 1953. He served several terms of office
as a Council member and was elected a Vice President in 1973. His wit and
wisdom were much appreciated in his skilful chairmanship of Council
meetings, as was his valuable financial advice. He made several excel-
lent films in colour of wildlife in East Africa and one of west Spitz-
bergen, all of which were shown at Society meetings.
As a young man some 50 years ago, he established what is now the
oldest private waterfowl collection in Britain at his home in Barnet, Hert
fordshire, and over the years he kept some 90 species, achieving outstand-
ing breeding results with many of them. (Rosemary Low wrote an illustra-
ted account of this collection in Volume 86, No. 2, 1980, of the Avicul-
tural Magazine).
His interest in horticulture was as great as his knowledge of waterfowl
and the 25 acres of landscaped gardens at his home contain many beautiful
and rare flowering trees and shrubs, providing a lovely setting for the birds
and a lasting tribute to Jack Death's skill and taste. He is missed very much.

Modem Farming Methods and their possible effect on Bird Life
Mr. Stoodley writes in Vol. 88 (1) of our Magazine about problems
arising from modern farming methods and asks for comments.
As I see it, there are really two separate issues: the first, what is the
long term effect of changes in crops and management on wild life; the
second, what are the direct effects of the operations themselves - he
mentions stubble burning and the application of agricultural chemicals.

ceeded the sowing. Weeds and pests abounded. Nowadays it is rare to see
even the beautiful poppies, but yields have increased many-fold. Although
it is by no means the whole story, it is reasonable to expect species that
are dependent, like the Partridge, on weed seeds and insects, to decrease
locally. This sounds a very bleak picture but the subject has been dis-
cussed at length by those more competent than I and most people agree
that a variety of practical measures can contribute to maintaining wild-
life stocks.
Stubble burning, judging by reports in the national press, is supposed to
be regulated and the National Farmers' Union can be expected to be sensi-
tive on the subject. Did Mr. Stoodley get any response to his complaints? I
know rather more about the ways in which agricultural chemicals are con-
trolled. There is an elaborate and expensive mechanism which has been de-
vised to try and ensure safety to people, domestic stock and all kinds of
wildlife from the original manufacture in the factory to the final applica-
tion. Aerial application is particularly carefully controlled and the pilots
fly uncomfortably low to keep a narrow swath.
There is no question but that agricultural chemicals are not released for
use until a wide range of specialists (including those with an interest in
birds!) are satisfied that their use appears safe. This is not to say, of course,
that mistakes, both operational and more fundamental, may not occur.
If Mr. Stoodley's premises have been bombarded from the air, this is
obviously totally wrong. At the least (fertiliser pellets?) he deserves an ap-
ology. If he has suffered loss (herbicides clipping his hedge?), he deserves
compensation. Personally I would have been on the telephone before the
second pellet fell. As with the smoke nuisance, it would be useful to know
if he complained and what sort of response he got. Swift action should
ensure that the problem is resolved.
The more fundamental issue is whether, somewhere down the line,
something is wrong with the safety controls and this is where Mr. Stoodley
can help not only himself but those who are trying to ensure that we have
not only a prosperous farming industry but also a healthy countryside. If
what appears to be a poisoning incident occurs, then it is imperative that
it should be reported (farmer, aircraft operator, Ministry of Agriculture, or
any one of the conservation organisations) and if dead birds are picked up,
they should be sent at once for analysis.

Hopes for the survival of the Black Robin Petroica traversi have been
raised by the development of a new management technique. It has been
found that Chatham Island Warblers Gerygone albofrontata will accept
and incubate eggs of Black Robins and rear to eight days (but not to fled-
ging). The robins too proved exceptionally tolerant and would readily
accept week-old chicks even though the adults were still incubating eggs.
Although capable of rearing two chicks per clutch, the robins seldom do
so, due to infertility and loss during incubation.
The new technique involves transferring the robin eggs to warbler
nests, so inducing the robins to lay further clutches while the warblers
hatch their eggs. The chicks hatched by the warblers are then fostered
back so ensuring that each pair of robins raises two chicks. Using this
technique during the 1980-81 season, ten robin eggs were produced (five
clutches) by the two pairs; six hatched, two nestlings were lost perfecting
this technique but four chicks fledged. However, one died later. The three
chicks survived the winter - a record number. The population now stands
at seven individuals, including three pairs. Fears of mal-imprinting in the
fostered chicks have been dispelled, for the chicks have mated - with
Black Robins. (Royal Australian Ornithologists' Union Newsletter).

Letters from Fred Bohner always contain interesting items of news
from his collection at Happy Valley, South Australia, and that of Adelaide
Zoo, plus some of his observations "out bush". Somewhere in the corres-
pondence mention is usually made of Black Cockatoos and the latest is no
exception, the added bonus this time, however, being that he proved his
observations with slides of wild Gang Gangs and Glossy Blacks.
His Red-tailed Blacks are again breeding and after many years of trying,
he has a White-tailed Black C. funereus baudinii chick in the nest which he
says is due to leave shortly. No other details were forthcoming. However,
he also reports that a private breeder and Adelaide Zoo have also reared
the species recently.
Among other successes at Adelaide Zoo are White-winged Wren, Austra-
lian Bustard and Mallee Fowl. The latter hatched six naturally in their
mound but the chicks were removed for fear of aggression by the male,
and hand-reared.

As a result of the atrocious weather conditions in December and Jan-
uary, two unusual casualties were brought to the Padstow Bird Gardens in
Cornwall. The first, a Little Auk, survived for only a couple of days but a
Bittern, despite having to have a wing amputated, is faring better, even if it
is proving a little difficult to accommodate while alternative arrangements
are made. Being a small establishment, accommodating such a bird is a
problem, especially when the occupants of the only suitable flight prove
apprehensive of a bird that remains motionless all day, and they refuse to
feed.
The problem has been solved by giving the Bittern partial liberty. At
night he is retained indoors and fed early the following morning. After a
good feed he is released into the duck enclosure where he makes for the
thick cover of bamboo in the far corner, promptly climbs up it to the
point where he can get over the wall and settles for the day in one of a row
of ornamental pines from whence he is easily caught in the evening. Only

Mr. Mats Tell, in Sweden, has sent his breeding results for 1981:
"This last breeding season must be regarded as a poor one - in fact, it is
many years since the number of young birds reared to maturity was so
small and only involved three species: the Crested Black Bunting (4),
Bourke's Parrakeet(14) and the Siy Parrot (4).
On the other hand, only two species did not attempt to nest at all -
the Orange-breasted Waxbill and the Nonpareil Bunting - while another
two species simply were not permitted to do so - Azara&amp;apos;s Conure and
Eclectus Parrot.
Three species had infertile eggs - White-collared Seed-eater, Blue-
crowned Hanging Parrot and Western Rosella Parakeet One species,
the Silver-eared Mesia, experienced "dead in shell" and finally three
relatively "easy" species hatched chicks but did not rear them - Bluish
Seed-eater, Virginian Cardinal and Sun Conure.
A fine cock Diademed Weaver Euplectes dkdamtus built at least 10
nests, using green grasses, and my single cock Chestnut Sparrow Passer
eminibey carried nesting material about the aviary, as did my "widower"

A good result was achieved by my friend A Lindblad whose pair of
Rainbow Buntings Passerina ledmchmt reared three young, two cocks and
a hen. At the time of writing (October 1981) they are almost through their
first moult. I must say they are marvellous birds. Their first clutch was in-
fertile but the female unexpectedly laid another three eggs in the same nest "

W.D. Cummings writes from Durban, South Africa: "I was very in-
terested to read Malcolm Ellis's article in the April/June 1980 issue of the
Avicultural Magazine on the nesting of African Starlings. He quotes from
an article that I wrote from Keston on breeding the Amethyst Starling
Cinnyricinclus leucogaster in 1958 when I first bred these beautiful
little starlings, with their strange wing display, raising first one wing then
the other over their back. Two young were successfully reared that year
but we lost one when 4-5 months old. The other moulted out in its first
year to be a cock and was paired to an adult hen. Neither pair reared
young again but what remains in my memory the most is the beautiful
little nest they made of green privet leaves. It was spherical in shape like
a plate, and similar in design to a spider's web with row upon row of leaves
with each leaf over-lapping the other, continued round until a depression
in the centre was reached to hold the eggs. It was so neat and unusual that
it has remained uppermost in my mind to this day."

No. 17 of the Jersey Wildlife Preservation Trust's Annual Report, The
Dodo , contains a paper on the effect of Hurricane Allen on the status of
the St. Lucia Parrot Amazona versicolor. Following the hurricane which
caused extreme damage on 4th August 1980, the Government of St. Lucia
requested the help of the Jersey Wildlife Preservation Trust to assess the
effect on the parrot population. Although it had not caused a significant
decrease in numbers (216 sightings), other factors, such as loss of nesting
sites might ultimately affect the status in the long term.

THE AVICULTURAL MAGAZINE welcomes original articles that have not been
published elsewhere and that essentially concern the aviculture of a particular bird or
group of birds, or that describe their natural history. Articles should be preferably
typewritten, with double spacing, and the scientific names as well as the vernacular
names of birds should be given. References cited in the text should be listed at the
end of the article. Line drawings should be in Indian ink on thick paper or card;
photographs (preferably in black and white) which illustrate a particular point in the
article will be used where possible and should be clearly captioned.

To help implement the important first step of a long-term conservation
programme developed between the USSR and the USA, the Vogelpark
Walsrode, headquarters for the German branch of the International Crane
Foundation, has been sent 12 young Asian White Storks Gconiac. boyciana.
An historic agreement which will help bolster international environ-
mental protection was signed on 15th August 1979 by Russian scientists
Dr. Vladimir Flint, Chief of Fauna Section, Central Laboratory for Nature
Conservation in Moscow, and Dr. Svyatoslav Priklonski, Director of Oka
State Natura Reserve: (USSR), and American conservationist Dr. George
Archibald of the International Crane Foundation (ICF), Baraboo, Wiscon-
sin (USA). Through the terms of the agreement, the Crane Foundation was
to receive from Russia several prefledged chicks of the Asian (Oriental or
Eastern) White Stork, a species currently threatened with dwindling popu-
lations. These birds will be used to establish a captive breeding colony of
this species, as has been done successfully for the White Stork C. ciconia
ciconia at Vogelpark Walsrode.
Soviet helicopters were used to search for nests of the wild population
of Asian White Storks, and approximately 200 breeding pairs were located
in the Lower Amur River area. Several prefledged chicks were collected
from each of several stork nests and the chicks were individually trans-
ported to Moscow where the Director of ICF (Germany), Mr. Wolf Brehm,
Director of Vogelpark Walsrode, and other Foundation representatives met
the birds.
The first two chicks born in 1980 were accompanied by Mr. Brehm
from Moscow to Vogelpark Walsrode, arriving on 3rd July 1980. The other
10 chicks reached the Vogelpark on 14th June, 1981. This group consisted
of eight nestlings born in 1981 and two three-year-old storks, the latter
coming from Moscow Zoo. All Asian White Storks remain the property of

the International Crane Foundation which has placed the storks on breed-
ing loan to Vogelpark Walsrode with the aim of breeding this species in
captivity and eventually restocking Japan and Korea.
The eight young birds (hatched in 1981) were reared in a group in a
glass house in an inside pen measuring 480 x 300 cm; the outdoor aviary
measures 1680 x 300 cm. The two oldest chicks (hatched in 1980) were
reared together in a wooden box measuring 140 x 100 x 45 cm in the
Vogelpark rearing house. After four weeks they were transferred to a pen
in the glass house as described above. The young storks were fed minced
beef heart, fish and day-old chicks from which the head, wings and legs
were removed. Supplementary minerals and vitamins were provided. After
the birds reached adult size they were fed primarily day-old chicks and
some fish.
Recently the ten storks mentioned above were transferred to a newly
established breeding centre which was built next to the crane breeding
station in an area which is partly marshy, a natural environment for the
captive birds. The enclosure measures 32 x 14 x 3.8 m and consists of
four pairs of opposing aviaries, each of which is 14 x 8 m. Each aviary has
a wooden shelter which is about 400 x 300 cm in size. The shelter heights
vary from 230-210 cm. On opposite sides there are two glass windows, each
measuring approximately 60 x 75 cm. The windows are 60 cm above the
pen floor, which consists of pure sand. The birds and keepers can enter
the pen through a sliding door measuring 80 x 175 cm. A second door of
the same size is next to the windows opening to the aviary.
The group of eight storks is kept in two aviaries; the other two storks
of 1980 are kept in a third aviary. Birds in different aviaries maintain
visual contact. The surrounding fence is wire mesh covered in green plas-
tic. The mesh size is 4 x 4 cm.
The welfare of the birds is of critical importance for the captive prop-
agation programme for this threatened stork species. It is hoped that the
favourable environment provided at the Vogelpark will stimulate success-
ful breeding next year of the oldest storks from this group.

Poicephalus senegalus
By ERIC CALLAGHAN (Co. Dublin, Eire)
My original two Senegal Parrots were obtained in May 1975. They con-
sisted of one of the Yellow-breasted subspecies P.s. senegalus and one of
the Orange-breasted subspecies P.s. mesotypus. The two birds were unsexed
adults. They were housed in a 3 ft box cage with a nest box attached. Both
birds spent long periods in the nest box over the next few months, but as a
result of observed mating attempts it was eventually discovered that the
"pair" consisted of two cocks.
In the autumn of 1976 a true pair of the Orange-breasted subspecies was
obtained. About a year later the hen had started to use the nest box provi-
ded when unfortunately she managed to escape by chewing a hole in the
wire mesh front of the cage, the door of the room being open at the time.
The cock made no attempt to follow her.
In September 1978 two birds, both believed to be hens, were bought;
one of each subspecies. At this stage the original two birds were separated
and the hen of the Yellow-breasted subspecies was introduced to the
Yellow-breasted cock. From this point, these birds are referred to as Pair A.
The hen Orange-breasted was introduced to the "widower" Orange-breasted
cock - these are referred to as Pair B. In both cases the birds proved com-
patible almost immediately and within moments in each case an extensive
session of mutual preening began. Previously, no attempt at mutual preen-
ing had ever been witnessed between the two cock birds, nor for that
matter has it often been witnessed with the true pairs since. By contrast,
inadvertently attempting to pair two cock birds at a later date resulted in
strong aggression and it was a long time before the two birds could be
persuaded to share a cage.
Housing
Both pairs are housed indoors under artificial lighting which is turned
on automatically at 7.30 a.m. and turned off manually, usually at about
9.00 p.m. Although the room is not heated the temperature rarely drops
below 45*F. Pair A is housed in a cage measuring 66 inches x 18 x 30 high
with a nest box which measures 22 inches x 10 x 11 high fixed to the out-
side. Pair B is housed in a cage which is a 30 inch cube with a nest box
which measures 17 inches x 10 x 12 high fixed to the outside. Pieces of
dry wood were placed in each box.These the birds eventually chewed into

a fine layer on which the eggs were laid.
Permanent companions in the room were a potential breeding pair of
African Grey Parrots, a cock African Grey, a hen Blue-fronted Amazon
Parrot and two cock Senegal Parrots, one of each subspecies.
During the winter months the room is also used to house a collection
of small foreign seed-eating birds.

Feeding
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.985264193548387" page_id="56284543"  page_num="131" year="" vol="">
The birds receive a basic diet which is made up of approximately three
parts sunflower seed plus one part each of canary seed, white millet, a
mixture of small seeds intended for pigeons and, twice weekly, corn which
has been soaked for 24 hours previously. Extras in the form of peanuts,
apple, orange, grapes, Cheddar cheese and spinach beet leaves or other
greenfood in season are provided regularly.
Sexing
A difference in head size is very obvious between the members of
Pair A, the head of the cock being much broader and stronger looking.
This difference is much less obvious with Pair B. The extra Yellow-breasted
cock has a head structure which appears almost identical to that of the hen
of the Yellow-breasted pair, so it would appear that head structure is not
an infallible guide to sexing. In both pairs, although none of the birds is
tame, the cock is less timid than the hen. The stance of the bird on the
perch also appears to be significant. The cocks tend to sit fairly upright
on the perch whereas the hens tend to stand with the body more inclined
towards the horizontal across the perch.
Perhaps the most definite indication of the sex of an individual is threat
behaviour. I have only ever been threatened by a cock bird, never by a hen.
Threatening behaviour consists in the bird leaning backwards slightly,
shrugging the wings outwards at the shoulder while doing so, this being
accompanied by a raising of the head feathers, gaping the beak and pro-
ducing a crackling sound within the beak. Even newly fledged young have
been tentatively sexed from the fact that those which appeared more mas-
culine-looking in other ways have threatened me when approached too
closely whereas a believed young hen has never done so. Threatening beha-
viour in this case has consisted merely in stretching the head forwards and
gaping. It may be of relevance here to mention that on the occasions when
another bird has been loose in the room, only the cock of each pair
attempted to drive it away from their cage.
The pairs, once formed, have been completely compatible, even to the

extent of sharing food, one member of the pair allowing the partner to
take pieces from a food item which it is holding. At the same time, court-
ship feeding has never been observed. This Is in contrast to the African
Grey Parrots where the cock will forcibly remove a titbit from the hen if
necessary, only to feed it back to her later.
No real courtship behaviour has ever been observed, for the birds tend
to cease whatever they may be doing immediately I enter the room.
Breeding
The first signs of a breeding attempt were in August 1979, when the
hen of Pair B began to spend time in the nest box - approximately one year
after being introduced to the cock. On 15th August an egg was found in
the nest, a second appearing on the 17th and a third on the 19th. All three
of these eggs were fertile and two hatched after an incubation period of
26 days. Both of these young died at two days old apparently not having
been fed, although closely brooded by the hen. There then followed a
frustrating period with numerous eggs being laid by both hens, none of
which appeared to be fertile, although Incubated for the normal period (see
Table below for details).
It is interesting to see the high degree of synchronisation In laying be-
tween both hens. As the two cages face one another across the room, per-
haps there is some degree of social stimulation. It is also interesting to see
that up to the last successful nesting, the birds have always been winter
nesters in spite of relatively uniform conditions of light throughout the
year.
After so many abortive nesting attempts, I received the suggestion in
correspondence with George Smith, that perhaps the fault lay, not in in-
fertility, but rather in non-viable embryos as a result of a dietary defic-
iency. It should perhaps be mentioned that all the birds appeared to be in
top condition, with no outward sign of trouble.
Starting in February 1981, the birds' diet was supplemented as follows:
V-Mix, a proprietary poultry vitamin mixture was supplied in the
drinking water, mixed according to the manufacturer's instructions, for
five days every second week;
SA-37, a vitamin-mineral powder was sprinkled on the food twice each
week.
The birds were also offered cooked chop bones with a little meat at-
tached every couple of days. These were eagerly taken from the beginning
by Pair A which have continued to eat them ever since. In contrast, Pair B
would not touch the bones for a long time and even now will just occa-

sionaUy take a little.
To my surprise Pair B had one egg in the nest on 21st May 1981, the
first egg ever to be laid during the summer months. This proved to be the
first egg of a clutch of three. Equally surprisingly, the hen of Pair A fol-
lowed suit, producing the first egg of a clutch of four on 9th June.
On 26th June, one egg in the nest of Pair B hatched, the other two eggs
being apparently infertile. On this occasion the hen began to feed the chick
properly. On 8th July the first egg of Pair A hatched, being followed on
the 10th by a second. Unfortunately the following day this chick was
found dead in the nest with a crushed abdomen, possibly as a result of the
cock spending a lot of time in the nest with the hen. The third egg of the
clutch hatched, on the 12th, the fourth egg proving infertile. This egg
measured 28 x 24 mm, the only egg which I have measured. This is slightly
smaller than the 29.6 x 26.4 given in For shaw's "Parrots of the World".
The newly hatched chicks were sparseiy covered with white down and
had noticeably fleshy swellings to the lower mandible. After the first two
days they could be clearly heard calling for food.
At this stage both cocks became extremely aggressive and could often
be seen clinging to the front of their cages threatening each other. The
cock of Pair A, which is the tamer of the two, would also stand at the en-
trance to the nest box and threaten me whenever I opened the cage to
feed them. The different characters of the two hens were revealed at this
stage also. While the hen of Pair A would sit calmly on the perch while I
inspected the nest, the other hen would rush back into the nest box as
soon as I entered the room and would stay there as long as I remained, not
even moving if I lifted the lid slightly in order to inspect the nest contents.
Food supplied while the young were in the nest consisted of the usual
seed mixture, all being soaked for at least 24 hours. Dry seed was comple-
tely ignored. In addition, bread and milk, cheddar cheese, spinach beet
leaves and whatever fruit was available were offered daily and were taken.
On 31st August the Orange-breasted chick left the nest for the first
time, at the age of 9 weeks and 4 days. It returned to the nest that evening
and did not emerge again for a further two days.
The first Yellow-breasted chick emerged on 12th September, also at the
age of 9 weeks, 4 days, while the second chick came out on the 15th at
the age of 9 weeks, 5 days. All the young returned to the nest regularly
during the following few days and all slept in the nest at night for the next
week or so, being accompanied by the hens.
Begging calls could be heard from the chicks for five to six days after
fledging although all the young were seen to eat soaked sunflower seed

within two days of fledging. They were first seen to eat dry seed about
ten days after fledging. They did not appear to touch the other foods
available at this time.
On fledging the young closely resembled the adults in colouring, al-
though the green area of the upper breast extended further down the
breast and the orange of the Orange-breasted chick was very pale. In
addition to a dark eye, all the fledglings showed a pale, horn coloured patch
at the base of the upper mandible.
The young were separated from the adults on 4th October when the
youngest was just over 12 weeks old.

Ganrulax leucolophus
By L. GIBSON (Burnaby, British Columbia, Canada)
This handsome bird is well known and is the most readily available of
the large family of Laughing Thrushes. It is found from the Eastern
Himalayan foothills down through Indo China, where small family parties
of about six birds are a familiar sight, scrounging around villages in typical
babbler fashion. They weigh about 105 g, with seven captive birds ranging
from 99 g to 116 g. Because of their size and aggressive nature, they are
difficult to house with other birds and are far better kept in an aviary by
themselves. They are extremely territorial and, probably for this reason,
make short work of any smaller birds but never attempt to eat them, as is
sometimes reported.
The first birds I ever kept were two leucolophus. When first obtained
they were dirty, thin and in quite the most threadbare condition that I
have ever seen in any bird. The first thing they did on arrival, in spite of
being hungry, was to have a bath. They bathe regularly and are quite
meticulous. Then they began to eat. They ate everything that was put in
front of them, including the cranberry sauce with turkey scraps. This went
on for about two months before they eased off.
For the first few months they were kept in a spare room. The food and
water was put in an aquarium on a stand in the middle of the room. They
became tame enough to sit on the aquarium while I changed the news-
papers on the bottom. However, these birds quickly revert to the wild state
if left alone for a short while. They moulted beautifully shortly after
acquisition.
Health
They were found to be riddled with parasites (at least six) and as there
was no cure for all of them, they were put in quarantine. The worst was
Coccidia but after two months it had dropped from a very heavy to a light
infection. The birds were kept under rigidly controlled conditions, but ex-
actly one year later, the Coccidia was still there. The experiment was then
terminated as the birds were boarded out for the holidays.
Most birds I have seen in zoos have invariably suffered from overgrown
beaks, one bird having its top mandible a full 2.5 cm (1 inch) longer than
the other. They are prone to beak damage, and one of the original birds
showed a healed fracture on the top mandible. They panic rather readily
N.B. The use of Ganrulax in these notes refers to this species only and
not to the genus as a whole which is, o f course, quite a large one.

at night if frightened by a cat, etc., and will fly into the wire. Two birds
which I boarded out suffered broken beaks within a short time. Unfor-
tunately both had the top mandible broken almost at the base and they
could only eat with great difficulty. They were pensioned off and died
within two years. Ideally they should be kept in a large aviary, but even in
my 10 metre flight the hen has badly skinned her "nose" in two successive
springs. Even better would be a conservatory without wire.
Apart from this beak trouble, nothing else bothers them and I have
had one which lived to at least 15 years in captivity. These birds become
quite relaxed when the owner is around (except when nesting) but remain
suspicious of strangers. They are good watchdogs and set up a cackle when
they hear a strange noise. The hen in this article was at least nine years old
when she nested. They were free of parasites when sent to the zoo but one
had a light infection of capillaria (probably one worm) when returned.
This was successfully treated.
Background
The original pair of birds was donated to the local zoo in 1972, a year
after acquisition, and remained there until the spring of 1980. Two years
before, I had obtained another two birds, one of which died in 1979. I
thought that it might have been a hen, but a post-mortem examination
proved it to be a male. It was then evident that I had two males.
The original two were brought back and all three were put together.
One of the original birds had plucked the other about the neck for eight
years. The feathers simply stopped growing and the bird kept its head
pulled down to keep warm. There was an obvious difference between these
two with the plucker having white all the way from its throat to its vent,
while the plucked one only had a white breast. This was initially thought
to be a sex indicator, but it is simply a subspecific difference.
Sexing
On putting the three together, the largest unplucked zoo bird immedi-
ately paired off with my remaining one. The odd one was chased away
from the pair but was otherwise unmolested. The large bird was a hen
being slightly larger than the other two. The male had a brighter chestnut
colouring in his mantle. The band of reddish-brown bordering the white is
less extensive on the hen so the brightness of colour, or lack of it, may just
be relative. The odd bird with the white breast was a much duller brown.
The birds have to be in good condition and well fed to see the difference
in colour. If poorly fed, they become dull brown and in extreme cases

show off-white streaks in the brown feathers, especially on the wings and
tad. One of my two birds showed this when bought but it moulted out
fine and I do not know if it is the remaining male or not. When in good
shape, their rufous colouring can be very bright and attractive, even in the
hen, but it takes only a moment to tell them apart.
Behaviour is of no help for, as with ah babblers, any two birds will
sleep together and behave socially. The sex of the odd bird is still in doubt.
Of five birds kept some years ago, the largest was a hen of the white-
breasted form. The sex of the others was in doubt, except for two that
paired off, but it was not known which was which. Both attacked the
known hen possibly because it was the only other female. The (?)hen of
the pair was just desperate to get at it, even trying to get it through the
wire separating the aviaries. This would suggest careful introduction of new
birds.
No courtship behaviour was noted, and neither fed the other, although
one would call the other to fresh food. They indulged in mutual preening
the year round.
Calls
The birds have a rather musical call They use the first two notes of this
when nervous. They use a cluck when they get fed which serves to attract
attention to the presence of food. They sang at dawn and dusk, with half-
open wings. The odd bird with the white breast had a different, slightly
more limited and somewhat less attractive call. When it was removed to
an inside cage all three continued to call back and forth. The hen
even called while sitting on eggs, so the third bird was removed from the
premises. When the chicks hatched they fell silent.

The adults were maintained and moulted on a simple diet of bread and
peanut butter and rice pudding. They also got chopped, cooked chicken,
including skin, three or four times a week. A dish of dry food was always
present. This was either dog chow powder, insectile food, or chick starter
crumbs. They ate it if very hungry but mostly they just scattered it.
No fruit or berries were eaten, except that the hen ate a few grapes. They
would not eat scrambled egg at all, or small birds 5 eggs. Neither did they
show any interest in small dead chicks. In the light of these observations,
reports of Garrulax eating chicks must be regarded as speculation. Because
chicks are missing does not mean they were eaten. Apart from anything
else, even newly-hatched chicks are far too big to be swallowed. And, far

from destroying chicks when disturbed, the parents put up a spirited de-
fence of the nest each time it was examined.
The original pair was in such poor shape when obtained that their eating
habits can be discounted.
Housing
The original birds were first kept in a small aviary at home and then in
a small one in the zoo, in the company of pheasants. They were brought
back in February 1980 and put into a 10 metre flight as described for
Arrow-marked Babblers (Avicultural Magazine 1979, 112), to which their
habits are practically identical. As noted, the beak is the weak point with
these birds. Keeping them on an earth floor is not sufficient to keep the
beak in good shape. They should be supplied with a pile of stones about
5 cm (2 inches) in diameter. They spend hours sifting through these and it
keeps the beak in good shape. Eventually the stones are all dispersed and
have to be gathered up again. They bathe regularly and were supplied with
a water dish under a dripping tap. This was on stones about 15 cm (6 inches)
off the ground. Food was placed on concrete blocks just inside the door at
a height of 60 cm (2 feet) in the shelter end. One-third of the aviary was
roofed over. The birds roosted in exactly the same position all year; this
was in a Wistaria and was quite exposed to view in winter. If Garrulax are
kept in an unroofed aviary, they do not seek shelter but will sleep in the
most exposed situations, so perches should be arranged with this in mind.

Two nests were built. One was used three times and the last one once.
The first was built in a Weigela bush, 1.5 metres above ground, near the
top, in almost the same spot used by Mousebirds the year before. As with
the Arrow-marked Babblers, nesting was a leisurely process. The first nest
was started on 27th May and the eggs were laid 15 days later. Both birds
shared in the building, as they did with all other activities.
The nest measured 9.5 cm (3 3 A inches) inside diameter, 15 cm (6 inches)
outside diameter, 6.5 cm (2 Vi inches) inside depth and 10 cm (4 inches)
outside depth. This was deep like all babbler nests and only the bird's head
and tail stuck out when incubating. Rather coarse material was used con-
sisting mainly of long grass and small twigs. It rested on a base of thick
twigs. The nest was unlined and was almost identical to that of the Arrow-
marked Babbler.
The first nest had a thick Weigela twig across the inside just above the
bottom and crossing about a third of the area. This was cut out. As with

all other nests, I shored it up with a pile of dried grass, but it had less need
of this than any other. This nest was used twice in succession.
A second nest was built in an open cardboard box 1.5 metres up in a
Wistaria at the end of the shelter, just where the Arrow-marked Babblers
had built a year earlier. Like the babblers, the Garrulax added to the nest
until the box was full.
The hen did most of the incubating and also brooded the chicks for the
first few days. She was on at night while the cock took regular but lesser
spells of duty.
Eggs
Fourteen pure white eggs were laid in clutches of three, four, four and
three, of which twelve hatched. Most hatched in 13 days and within a few
hours of each other. They are relatively small for the size of the bird, being
about 6.5 g. - 7% of the female's body weight.
Two of the first clutch were laid in the nest on 11th and 12th June, and
a third egg was found on 15th June at the far end of the aviary. This egg
weighed 7.1 g and measured 28x 22 mm. It was replaced in the nest but
did not develop.
The last clutch was laid on 2nd-4th October in the cardboard box.
There was frost on the two nights before hatching.
Chicks
When the chicks hatched, the parents became quite aggressive. As with
the Arrow-marked Babblers it was the hen which was most active in defence.
The cock was not so tame and when he was off duty he hid in the bushes.
When I examined the chicks I was regularly struck in the face by the hen's
claws, so much so that I had to wear a hat. On one occasion she clung to
the back of my neck and was carried out of the aviary. She sat on the open
door screaming abuse. Then she flew to an apple tree and back again to the
door. After what seemed like an eternity, but was actually about a minute,
she went back in to the chicks. Thereafter I backed out of the aviary and
also hung a plastic sheet over the door.
The chicks are large and vigorous. They are downless and greyish pink
with a yellow-rimmed beak, but no inside gape colour. They beg at the
slightest provocation and can easily take a whole mealworm pupa.
When the first clutch hatched, it was cold being about 14-15*C (58-
59*F) during the day and about 12*C (54*F) at night. Both parents sat
very tight. When one brought food, the other merely stood up until the
chicks were fed. The chicks were peeping by the second day.

All chicks were hand fed with scrambled egg from day one - at great
risk to my person, as I was attacked each time. Both parents set up such a
clamour when the nest was approached that it is a wonder any chicks sur-
vive in the wild.
The parents fed steadily using mealworms, pupae, spiders and leather-
jackets. Small earthworms and a little rice pudding were used when the
chicks were about six days old. As with the babblers, no food was broken
up, but fed whole after being killed. One would think that at this stage
such large chicks would be easily raised but it was not to be so. Every-
thing went smoothly for the first five days. The sixth day was very hot and
the hen stood on the nest and fanned the chicks with one wing. The
smallest had difficulty in swallowing its scrambled egg. The next day it
regurgitated it and died the following day. It had no food in it stomach
but did^have three pieces of eggshell. Cultures from the stomach and in-
testine both grew the bacillus Clostridium perfringens, the significance
of which was not clear. On the same day the other chick was a good deal
larger at 25 g, began to have difficulty swallowing. It was started on
antibiotics (Cephacosporin) but gradually went downhill and on the tenth
day it was taken in and placed in an incubator. It had some feathers
opened and was most comfortable at 86-88*F. It was fed about every
two hours but was breathing with some difficulty. A throat swab yielded
a heavy growth of the yeast Candida. A culture of the faeces showed
Candida and Enterococcus but no Clostridium , which was to be expected
as it was on antibiotics. Gentian violet, and later Nystatin were given to
try to counteract the yeast. The abdomen was swollen and red.
Despite treatment, it died nest day aged 11^4 days. An immediate
examination revealed at IVi mm lesion on the liver which gave a pure
culture of Candida albicans , as did a lesion in the right main air sac. The
intestine was crammed with food, indicating that digestion had stopped
some 30 hours earlier. The feathers had opened and it had reached 32 g
and looked just like its parents.
The second next had four chicks. By 48 hours the third chick to hatch
was dead and the fourth died the following day. The first to die was too
far gone for a post mortem when it was found. It had been discarded only
1 metre from the nest. Its stomach was full. The next to die was riddled
throughout with Enterococcus but I was not sure how long it had been
dead.
The two remaining chicks were taking about half a teaspoonful of egg
per day. They were started on antibiotics on the second day, consisting
of a dose of Septra (Sulphonomide and Trimethoprim) in the morning and

Veflex (Cephacosporin) at night. This continued for five days until they
were six and a half days old. They were much more advanced than the
previous chicks, the eyes opening on the sixth day. The parents continued
to feed well, preferring mealworms and spiders and at one point the hen
took eight mealworms at once to the nest.
Strangely they did not like crickets and did not use them unless there
was nothing else, not even eating them themselves. Scrambled egg left on
the nest rim was not fed to the chicks. The parents just ate it, as they did
with the chicks' droppings.
On the morning of the twelfth day, the smaller chick was found dead
in the nest. It .weighed 36g and was well feathered. The larger was found
running about on the ground. It weight 47Hg. When replaced in the nest
left immediately. It was unable to fly but was well developed and remained
hidden for almost two weeks. However, the parents shrieked whenever I
approached it. Thereafter raising was uneventful. The chick continued to
beg long after it was self-supporting and was still fed by its parents until
somewhere between five and six weeks old. It was the only chick reared
and was also the only species reared here so far where the chick was iden-
tical in colour to its parents. In fact, the mantle was such a bright chestnut
that it was surmised to be a cock. All three birds lived together peacefully
after nesting.
The dead chick was examined and the only lesions seen were a sub-
surface spot on the tongue and another at the top of the throat at the edge
of the epiglottis. Both were excised and found to be quite hard. They were
crushed and cultured and again gave a pure growth of Candida albicans.
Two other clutches of three hatched (one egg failing to do so) and the
chicks were all dead within two and a half days. All had their stomachs
crammed with food. They were again given antibiotics, but only when
they were showing signs of distress.
This was all most perplexing. To have Candida lesions in young chicks
like this suggests an inherited deficiency, and I believe it is the youngest
age in which this infection has been noted. One can expect Candida in
birds that are just about to die of old age, and I found this several times.
The parents, and indeed all Garrulax , have a lot of Candida in the intes-
tinal tract and the faeces. It is virtually impossible to treat if it sets in sys-
tematically like that. It is unaffected by antibiotics. I am now sorry that I
did not pursue treatment more aggressively as I had so few chicks to work
on. However, it is significant that two chicks on antibiotics reached twelve
days and were better developed at the same age than the others. I have
never had any other species reach such a late stage of development and
then die.

BREEDING RAMPHOCEL US TANAGERS
UNDER CAPTIVE CONDITIONS
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.995750416666667" page_id="56284554"  page_num="142" year="" vol="">
By Dr. JOHANN INGELS (Destelbergen, Belgium)
From the general literature on the adaptablity of tanagers to captive
conditions, we concluded that Ramphocelus were the most suitable for
avicultural purposes (Ingels, 1982). They readily adapt to confinement and
accept suitable food; moreover they reproduce fairly readily and are attrac-
tive birds. However, their natural shyness and nervous disposition and their
aggressive nature during the breeding season can cause problems (Norgaard-
Olesen, 1973-74).
The following survey summarises our knowledge of the reproduction of
Ramphocelus tanagers under controlled conditions. It is based on reports
of successful and unsuccessful breeding results which have appeared in
the Avicultural Magazine, Foreign Birds, The Foreigner (England), De
Vogelwereld (Belgium) and Onze Vogels (Holland). Personal observations
and breeding results with six Ramphocelus species are also included.
The choice of aviary may contribute greatly to a successful breeding
attempt. If possible, pairs should be housed in individual flights; the best
results being from those housed in fairly large, planted aviaries. An area of
some 10 square metres (approximately 100 square feet) appears most
suitable. Vegetation (shrubs and small trees) will not only offer suitable
nesting sites, but will also attract insects.
In communal aviaries, other inmates can cause continual disturbance,
for the breeding pair will try constantly to chase intruders from the nest-
ing area. Other inmates will compete also for the available supply of insect
food when the Ramphocelus need it to rear their young. Finally, other
inmates may be responsible also for the disappearance of eggs and/or nest-
lings.
Due to the pronounced sexual dimorphism, selecting a true pair of
Ramphocelus is not difficult at all. However,birds purchased in immature
plumage may prove to be males. Man-formed pairs are not always com-
patible, often resulting in constant bickering. Usually, changing one part-
ner solves this problem.
An important initial problem to deal with when establishing a breeding
pair is to overcome the natural nervousness of Ramphocelus. Successful
breeding results are often thwarted by nervous females not sitting tightly
thus causing eggs and/or young to chill; moreover, a nervous pair will all
too easily desert their nest. Pairs of Ramphocelus in captivity for several

years may loose their innate restlessness and learn to accept a broad choice
of substitute food Items, two important factors for successful breeding
results.
Ramphocelus are prone to building loose, untidy nests when building
in natural nesting sites, one of the main causes being the provision of
unsuitable nesting material Therefore, it is essential that a breeding pair
be supplied with materials of different textures, e.g. for the bulk of the
nest, coarse grasses, fibres, bamboo leaves, twigs, pine needles, etc.
Problems are often encountered when a natural nesting site is chosen as
nests located in such sites often deteriorate rapidly. It is preferable, there-
fore, if a nesting pair can be persuaded to take to a wire nest basket or
nest box.
Clutch size varies between one and three eggs, with a preponderance
of two eggs. Females are able to produce up to four clutches in one
breeding season; clutches laid in quick succession tend to contain one
egg only. Eggs are pale blue with a few brown specks and flecks on the
broad end. Clear and/or thin shelled eggs are not usually encountered
when breeding Ramphocelus tanagers.
Young hatch after approximately twelve days of incubation. They
leave the nest approximately 14 days later; the nestling period thus rang-
ing from 12 to 16 days, depending largely upon the amount of live food
available.
The first days after the young hatch are of the utmost importance. The
parent birds should be offered a wide range of insect food, e.g. "white"
mealworms, crickets, cockroaches, ant pupae, spiders, maggots, flies,
mealworm and maggot chrysalids, etc. In planted aviaries live insects will
be foraged for in the vegetation, but as already mentioned, in communal
aviaries there will be considerable competition for the insect food avail-
able. Under these circumstances, young rarely reach maturity.
The parent birds may be stimulated to feed the young by offering
food several times daily and at different sites in the aviary. Females will
do most of the feeding in the early days, although males will help more
as the young grow older. After about one week, the parents will begin
gradually feeding their more usual diet to the young.
Young usually leave the nest before their plumage is fully developed,
thus causing them to be poor flyers. Open standing water must, there-
fore, be covered at this stage to avoid drowning. During a severe rain
shower fledglings may become waterlogged if they are unable to find a
sheltering place, causing them to chill and die. When attempting to rear
young to independence in communal flights, the other inmates may

cause problems by attacking the Ramphocelus fledglings. Although
parent birds will usually protect their offspring, this task may become too
much to contend with. In this same period the parents may also show
extreme aggression, and in some cases may even kill other inmates.
If all goes well, the young will progress rapidly, flying well within a
week of leaving the nest. At the age of 20 to 25 days, they will be fully
feathered and already feeding themselves. Should the parent birds begin
a second round, they will continue to feed their offspring, even when the
female is incubating. To avoid aggression from the male, it is preferable
to remove the young once they are fully independent.
Ramphocelus can prove to be prolific breeders as shown by the results
of Dr. R.E. Brown (Newcastle, New South Wales, Australia. 1954), who,
after the importation of all birds into Australia was banned, bred 35
young to the seventh generation from an original pair of Brazilian Scarlet
Ramphocelus bresilius and one female Silver-beaked Tanager R. carbo.
At the age of 19 the original female Silver-beaked Tanager was still
breeding and rearing young successfully.
A rough analysis of the results in public collections, as published in
the International Zoo Yearbook (volumes 1-17, 1959-75), illustrates the
breeding possibilities of these tanagers. In the period covered by this
publication, 19 pairs of Ramphocelus produced 78 young in 40 breeding
seasons, or on the average each pair reared a total of four young during
two seasons, or two young a year. Although on the average each pair was
only active for two breeding seasons, prolific pairs bred during five suc-
cessive seasons, rearing up to nine young in this period.
Species most often seen and/or bred in public collections are: the
Brazilian Scarlet R. bresilius % the Crimson-masked R. nigrogularis, the
Silver-beaked R. carbo and especially and Flame- and Lemon-rumped
Tanagers R. flammigerus flammigerus and R. f. icteronotus respectively.

INBREEDING DEPRESSION IN MANDARIN DUCKS:
A PRELIMINARY REPORT ON SOME CONTINUING EXPERIMENTS

Background
As aviculturists working with wild forms, our problems are distinct
from those of breeders of domestic animals. In their field, inbreeding and
line breeding have been necessary tools for establishing breed characteris-
tics and fixing them for the future. In our case, we must assume that some
product from our breeding may be re-introduced into the wild. We reason
that the ideal form for survival is that which came from the wild. We can-
not improve on it for it has become the ultimate in adaptation to its envir-
onment during the eons of its development.
We can and do lose some characteristics which may be essential to the
species' wild survival. What is lost by inbreeding? Does it really affect the
production of wild birds? These questions have not been answered to our
satisfaction.
Here at C.R.C. we attempt to hatch and rear young from eggs of birds
held at the National Zoological Park in Washington, DC, as well as from
any laid here. During the 1979 breeding season we began to suspect that
our problems in rearing ducklings from Zoo eggs were not all management
orientated, but might be genetic in part.
We had on hand that winter two male and three female Mandarin Ducks
which we had reared in 1979. It was one of several species which seemed
to exhibit poor hatchability. After examination of the Zoo records revealed
that no new Mandarin Ducks had come to the National Zoo since 1967, we
decided to use those five birds for some experiments.
The records showed that two males had come in from Mr. Kenneth
Sather of Round Lake, Minnesota, on 20th January 1966. Two more
drakes had been received from the Edward Marshall Boehm aviaries near
Trenton, New Jersey, on 3rd April 1967, and the last sue birds, which were
siblings, had arrived from the Cleveland Zoo on 20th October, 1967.

We used covered rearing pens with concrete pools. In March 1980 we
installed a pair and a trio of our siblings each in a separate pen so that we
could measure the production. One pen received one nesting box, the
other was given two. All eggs were numbered with a soft pencil as they

were laid. They were gathered as clutches after the female had lined the
nest with down signifying the completion of the clutch. The eggs were
cleaned of any faecal material, dipped in a Betadyne solution at about
100*F and set in a Petersime self-turning incubator at 99.75*F.D.B. The
eggs were candled at seven-day intervals. Those in which we were not
certain of the time of death of the embryo were opened later and the
state of development was determined.

Possible variations were encountered during the first half of the 1980
incubation period, the eggs obviously were not losing moisture at the
normal rate. A new room air conditioning controller was installed on
1st May. By mid-May the condition had stabilised and thereafter incubation
seemed to be normal. Another factor in addition to the erratic moisture
conditions we experienced during the 1980 season and which could have
limited hatching was a misreading of the strength of one of the fumigant
components. The incubators were not being adequately fumigated but
that condition was corrected in 1981. However, neither of those factors
should have influenced the high percentage of fertile eggs which did not
die until late in incubation. Therefore, we felt that we must look elsewhere
for an explanation.
We determined to try outbreeding with some unrelated Mandarins but
the question was from where? We concluded that those farthest away
in the U.S. had the best chance of being unrelated. We knew that the
delays involved in permits and quarantines for importing birds would
make any effort for 1981 impossible. We asked the San Diego Zoo for two
pairs of Mandarins. They had no individuals that were easy to catch
so they borrowed four birds from Sea World at San Diego and sent them
to us.
Of the four San Diego birds, one female was lost, the other proved
too wild to breed in the rather exposed conditions in our new Hardy Birds
Yards. Therefore only two pairs demonstrated the results of outbreeding.
All eggs were handled as in 1980, all eggs in the incubator were candled as
before, and doubtful ones were opened later.

During 1980 the very low levels of hatchability (18.3%) and viability
(53.3%) were an indication that our problems might be due to inbreeding.
Poor reproductive output is characteristic of highly inbred domestic
mammals and birds, but has rarely been investigated in wildlife^. A fur-

ther indication that this was a genetic, rather than a management-related
problem was the fact that a significantly greater percentage of our embry-
onic deaths occurred in the last third of incubation (40) than in the first
(6) or second third (21) 5 . While poor egg handling usually results in early
embryonic death, embryonic mortality due to inbreeding has greatest
effect late in incubation*^.
Eggs from the 1981 outbred birds had very significantly greater hatching
success than linebred eggs produced that same season (96.2% against
44.6%). In addition, youngsters of unrelated parents fared better after
hatching, with 80.0% still living after 90 days. Inbred 1981 offspring
showed 52.0% survivorship past 90 days; 1980 birds, 53.3%. Again, embry-
onic deaths in linebred eggs occurred significantly more often late in incu-
bation (2 early, 6 middle, 23 late).

Conclusions
</subsubsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999571846153846" page_id="56284559"  page_num="147" year="" vol="">
These results illustrate two advantages of introducing new genetic stock
into a population whose ability to live has been declining: increased hatch-
ability and viability. According to Romanoff^, when embryonic mortality
reaches over 70%, extinction of the line is likely. Introducing new genetic
stock may forestall such an unfortunate eventuality.
As was discussed earlier, the timing of embryonic deaths adds credence
to the belief that low hatchability and viability may be indicative of in-
breeding depression.
A third advantage of mixing new blood is the money saved. From the
three pairs of outbred birds we obtained 26 fertile eggs and reared 20
young. From four pairs of inbred birds we got 26 good eggs and reared
only 13 young, and this comparison includes troubles with two of the
pairs of unrelated birds.

Spermophaga haematina
By P. LOWE (West Country Wildlife Park, Cricket St. Thomas, Somerset)
The Red-breasted Blue-bill cock has a deep crimson breast and lower
abdomen. The rest of the plumage is black. The hens differ in having white
spots on the flanks. This species of Blue-bill or Seedcracker occurs in
eastern Africa, inhabiting dense forest areas and feeding on the edge of
forests. It prefers to keep to low bushes.
During the past twelve months or so, a number of these birds have been
imported and it has been reported that they have not proved to be good
aviary subjects.
In November 1981 four male and six female Red-breasted Blue-bills
were introduced into our Tropical House which is 100 ft x 50 ft x 24 ft

and is thickly planted. The birds seemed to settle well and a good seed
mixture was scattered all over the floor of the house, much to the annoy-
ance of the gardeners when the seed eventually sprouted! However, I
believe this action was initially essential to the survival of the birds who
were extremely shy. Gradually the Blue-bills have become bolder and now
it is a common sight to see a flash of bright crimson flit by or to see one
sitting in a bush a few feet away.
On 15th March 1982 I noticed a hen Blue-bill carrying nesting material
in the form of puppy fluff from my St. Bernard's dog.
I did not see exactly where the bird took this material, nor did I see
any further signs of nesting as time was short for lengthy close observation.
On 5th April I noticed a small seed-eating bird, plumage black, with a
tuft of grey fluff on top of the head, also a distinct orange gape was very
noticeable. It appeared to me that this bird could be none other than a
Blue-bill fledgling. The only other species of seed-eater in the house is a
group of Orange-breasted Waxbills.
I did not see this bird again until it was picked up dead by one of our
gardeners on 9th April and it was a pity that we did not keep the corpse.
After returning from holiday I had a pleasant surprise. Another Blue-
bill fledgling appeared - an older looking bird and appearing very strong. I
did notice a definite rapport between a pair of Blue-bills and the young
bird but since the youngster appeared to be completely self-supporting, I
saw no effort by the supposed parents to feed it.
I can only suppose that a pair of Blue-bills nested in a horizontal basket
1 ft long and 4 inches in diameter and open at one end. At this time of
year I do not probe amongst the vegetation and so possibly valuable infor-
mation could be lost but I am more interested in leaving well alone and
hopefully seeing young birds being fed by the parents on the "sticks".
I would be most interested in comparing notes with other aviculturists
who have had similar experiences with this very attractive species.

A King Vulture was hatched on 26th March 1982. This is a rare event
in captivity but the fifth time that these parents have bred at Wassenaar.
Unfortunately the parents tried to eat the first chick and so it and subse-
quent chicks have been removed and handreared. A special diet is used
consisting of mouse intestines mixed with pepsine and hydrochloric acid
which is a substitute for their natural diet of predigested meat regurgita-
ted by the parents and our chicks thrive on this substitute.
As well as the King Vulture, the Caracaras and the Cinereous Vultures
bred at Wassenaar this year; unfortunately, the young Cinereous Vulture
died after three days but the Caracara is growing well.

The Speckled Hummingbird has a fairly extensive range, being distribu-
ted from Venezuela, through Colombia, Ecuador, Peru and Bolivia to
northern Argentina. It is a shining bronzy green above, while underparts
are dull white with throat and breast speckled dull green. It has a buff
streak behind the eye and dusky cheek patches. The tail is bronze-purple
with all but the central tail feathers tipped buff.
I purchased a pair of these beautiful hummingbirds in September 1979
and as I was in the middle of building a new bird-room, they were housed
temporarily in a planted flight inside a 10 ft x 8 ft cedar wood shed. They
arrived in excellent condition and no problems were encountered in estab-
lishing them.
The new bird-room was completed in January. Built against the side
of the house, it consists of part-brick construction with conservatory
glass panels at each end and for part of the roof. It measures 25 ft x 8 ft
x 6 ft and is furnished with various plants and has a small water fountain
in which the birds love to bathe. Altogether ten birds of various species
moved to the large bird room where they soon settled down. The hen
Speckled Hummingbird was well into her moult but showed no ill effects,
consuming large quantities of fruit flies. The high fly content in the new
building soon brought in the spiders and the webs they spun proved very
useful during nest- building.
As the hen finished her moult, she became increasingly fit. Her first
attempt at nest-building left her covered in cobwebs and apparently
upset at her failure. After a few days she had mastered the art of trailing
the cobwebs behind her and the nest seemed to grow daily. The nest was
constructed solely by the hen and along with cobwebs, she pulled dried
moss from an old log found in a nearby wood and lined it with hair. It
took about a week to build and was completely enclosed when finished.
Looking at the nest it appeared to be just a ball of moss and cobwebs but
there was a small entrance hole facing into the corner of the bird room.
The construction made it difficult to inspect for eggs and seeing inside was
almost impossible.
During the week of nest- building, the cock would often dance and
float in front of the hen, continually singing. One evening, as I changed
the nectar tubes, I saw the hen puffed up and not looking at all well.

I left her alone, feeling that she might be about to lay, and next morning,
looking less ruffled, she entered the nest several times and for some morn-
ings after, she would be sitting in the nest. I began to suspect that she had
laid as an increasing amount of time was now being spent inside the nest.
Only occasionally did she leave the nest, but I did have a brief opportunity
to check, using a hand mirror. To my delight, I saw two tiny white eggs. I
soon moved out of the bird room and did not disturb her again.
As no mating had been witnessed, I was unsure whether the eggs were
fertile. Incubation was going well until one morning I noticed a Fork-
tailed Woodnymph hen taking material from the Speckled Hummingbird's
nest to build one of her own. I put in more moss and hair in the hope of
discouraging her from doing so. During the afternoon, my wife telephoned
me at work to say that the two hens had been fighting and that the nest
was looking a little dilapidated. When I returned, both eggs containing
fully formed chicks were on the floor broken and the nest had been tom
apart.
The Woodnymph proceeded to lay two single eggs at a five week inter-
val. She laid in a shallow depression in the remains of the Speckled Hum-
mingbird's nest but there was not sufficient rim and both fell to the
ground and smashed.
Shortly after the above communication was received, Mr. R. J Elgar
also sent in a report about the nesting of this species and, whilst there was
naturally some repetition which has been edited out, it was felt that the
detailed information given concerning the construction of the nest and the
accompanying illustration were of great interest and should be published
in conjunction with Mr. Carter's article.

By R.J. ELGAR (Manchester)
Adelomyia melanogenys is a subtropical forest humming bird. It is
usually found at altitudes of 4.500 ft to 8,500 ft., preferring cloud forest,
coffee plantations, etc. Its vertical distribution is from ground level to a
height of six feet, but is more likely to be observed below three feet, feed-
ing from low growing shrubs and herbage in the undergrowth.
Adelomyia is not basically territorial (Snow, 1980) but appears to trap-
line over considerable distances mainly to flowers with small amounts of
nectar which would be uneconomic for larger trap-lining humming birds to
visit. Perhaps I should explain here that trap-lining is a term used to des-
cribe a non-territorial humming bird that has adopted a non-territorial
feeding strategy, visiting flowers over a distance of several miles but
usually returning to its starting point to rest or roost before going on
another feeding trip. Trap-lining humming birds can be further divided
into high and low reward trap-liners. High reward trap-liners are species
with particularly long or curved bills which have cd-evolved with certain
plant species that offer a high nectar reward per flower, for example,
sword-billed humming birds Ensifera feed almost exclusively on the
flowers of Passiflora mixta and Datura, the nectar being inaccessible to
shorter- billed species. Low reward trap-liners are smaller, shorter-billed
species which are excluded from larger flowering areas by territorial
species and instead visit smaller flowering areas that would be uneconomic
for a territorial species to defend. The Speckled Humming Bird falls into
this category. Territorial humming birds are usually large, heavy-bodied
birds with shorter wings and tend to be more manoeuvrable but less
efficient at covering large distances. These species usually come off better
in any aggressive encounter with trap-lining birds and thus can defend an
area of flowers for their own use, for example members of the genus
Boissoneaua ( Coronets) and Heliangelus (Sun Angels). A fourth category
consists of humming birds that are so large or aggressive that they can feed
with impunity within the territory of any species.
When related to aviculture, the category to which a humming bird
belongs can determine the best way in which to house it, a rough guide
being that most trap-lining humming birds tend to be solitary and do
best in cages, whereas territorial species usually do better in a mixed
flight.

When my female Adelomyia melanogenys was first acquired in Septem-
ber 1979, it had completed its moult during the initial seven-week quaran-
tine period. When it arrived at my home it was released immediately into
the communal humming bird flight with approximately ten other occu-
pants, all being medium to large species. It settled in very easily, but for
the first few days proved to be extremely aggressive, especially when I
was dimming the lights in the evening. It would land on the backs of
roosting humming birds, going through false mating and vent pecking pro-
cedure.
There were numerous attempts at nest-building in various positions
within the flight but due to disturbances from other females no nest was
ever completed. Over the course of the winter 1980-81 a small outside
flight was attached to the communal flight; it measured 15 ft x 4 ft and
7 ft high, it was covered in inch wire netting and on top of this was flat
translucent plastic which gave some protection from extreme weather con-
ditions. Two windows were incorporated, measuring 3 ft x 2 ft for good
ventilation in hot weather. The floor is earth and I planted this flight with
several species of Clematis, Fuchsia, Passiflora, friiphofia and Salvias well
as a grapevine. By early summer 1981 all the plants were in full bloom.
At the end of July 1981, the female Adelomyia started carrying large
amounts of sphagnum moss and attached the moss to the central stems of
a Clematis montana , using spiders' webs to bind it together. Within a few
days I realised that the nest was not to be cup-shaped as with most hum-
ming birds' nests that we know of, but domed. Most of the work on the
nest was achieved by the female from the inside of the dome pushing more
sphagnum moss and spiders' webs into the roof. I rarely observed her on
top of the dome.
The interior cup was lined with cotton wool and plant down from the
Great Willow Herb Epilobium angustifolium. The nest was completed in
just over a week. Although she never laid any eggs she roosted in the nest
in the evening throughout the summer.
On a visit to West Germany in November 1981 I observed two nests of
Aglaiocercus species in collections of T. Kleefisch of Bonn and L. Peikert
of Gaggenau both of which were domed.

NOTES ON THE YELLOW-FACED PARROTLET
Forpus xanthops

<bodyText confidence="0.981090090909091" page_id="56284568"  page_num="156" year="" vol="">
The Yellow-faced Parrotlet is the largest member of the genus Forpus.
When compared with other members of the same genus xanthops is pre-
dominantly grey green with a yellow face (cheeks, throat and crown).
The sexes can be easily distinguished by the colour of the lower back
and rump which is cobalt blue in the male and powder blue in the female.
These parrotlets come from north-western Peru.
The first of a recent series of small consignments of these birds to reach
the U.K. was offered for sale in October 1979. We purchased a total of 12
birds (eight cocks and four hens) from this shipment.
One pair was housed in a private collection and the remaining 10 birds
were placed on loan to the Midland Bird Garden. Initially the 10 birds

were housed in a small holding cage inside but without very much in the
way of heat. Overcrowding had obviously been a problem during the days
prior to their purchase as was indicated by the plucked heads of certain
individuals and probably for this reason one of the cock birds died very
shortly after arriving with us. A further male was killed during December.
With the number reduced to eight the aggression, which had been obvious,
decreased. The birds remaining, however, were very nervous while caged.
A range of cages for South American parrots was completed at the
Midland Bird Garden during the spring of 1980 and the group of parrotlets
was moved in alongside a colony of 18 Green-rumped Parrotlets Forpus
p, passerinus and a pair of Hawk-headed Parrots Deroptyus a . accipitrinus.
The aviary was constructed of rustic poles and Vi inch (12 mm) plastic
coated mesh and measured approximately 5 m deep by 2 m wide and
2.3 m. high at the front, and was built into a grassed bank at the rear. It
was planted with the Peruvian Lily Alstromeria . A small shelter was provi-
ded at the back of the flight and this was also used as a feeding station.
This shelter was never used for roosting, the birds always remaining out-
side, whatever the weather conditions.
Once in their new aviary the birds settled in very quickly, becoming far
steadier than they had been while caged. The food provided was of a 50/50
mix of our standard parrot mixture consisting of mixed sunflower, peanut
kernels, pine nuts, whole wheat, whole maize and paddy rice, together
with a finch mixture comprising a 50/50 Budgerigar mixture plus paraoum
millet. Fruit was provided in the form of apple, pear, banana and orange.
Only apple was eaten even though all the others had been eaten whilst the
birds were housed inside. Cuttle fish bone was also available.
Four Budgerigar-type nesting boxes were placed on one side of the
aviary. These were lined with wood pulp. Interest was shown in the boxes
straight away. A good deal of bickering took place to start with and the
pairs began to occupy distinct areas. One pair in particular commandeered
most of one comer and whilst they allowed other individuals to perch
nearby and to feed unhindered, they kept them well clear of their nest box.
It soon became apparent that this pair was taking over all the boxes and so
a further she boxes were provided. After much inspection and re-arranging
of wood pulp and a certain amount of bobbing and chattering from the
male, presumably a courtship, an egg was laid on 19th June, 1980.
The female was observed in the nest box for long periods of time on
20th June and she was sitting tight on the 21st. A second egg was seen on
the 22nd and had probably been laid on the previous day since a third
egg was in evidence on the 23rd. A total of six eggs was laid.

Rearing food in the form of brown bread soaked in a mixture of con-
densed milk with soaked corn and currants, chopped cabbage, "Prosecto"
insectile food and apple sprinkled with S.A. 37 Vitamin Powder was
provided for the birds to get used to before any chicks hatched. No interest
was shown in this food until the 13th July when the first chick hatched
after an incubation period of approximately 23 days. From this date all
the foods offered were sampled, particular interest being shown in the
soaked bread. All six eggs had hatched by 20th July and the chicks fledged
at about 30 days. All had fledged by 30th August. The young could easily
be sexed whilst still in the next box by their rump colour; they proved to
be four females and two males. The juvenile coloration was a slightly
paler version of the adults with a dark line on the upper mandible which
was not obvious in the parents. The young were completely independent
of the parents in a fairly short time and nesting was once again underway
by mid-September. Three eggs were laid and these measured 21.5 (21-22)
mm x 16.8 (16.5-17) mm. These were abandoned on 25th September
and there was a short-lived outbreak of fighting on the 27th. All three
adult females laid during October but only three young were hatched.
These unfortunately were not reared and to prevent further failures and
also because of the approaching cold weather, the nest boxes were removed
at the end of November.
One young male was found dead, apparently killed by other members
of the group, and this left six males and seven females at the end of the
season.
The pair of birds housed separately showed interest in their next box
but no serious attempt was made at nesting.
The colony of birds remained in unheated quarters throughout the
winter and, as previously mentioned, roosted outside at all times. We took
the precaution of removing all branches which we felt were too exposed
but an attempt to try to make the birds use the shelter, by removing all
the outside perches, only resulted in them trying to roost on the wire and
so the more sheltered perches were returned.

THE 50TH ANNIVERSARY OF THE SPLENDID GRASS PARRAKEET
IN AVICULTURE
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.996045722222222" page_id="56284571"  page_num="159" year="" vol="">
By F.C. BARNICOAT (Johannesburg, Republic of South Africa)
The Splendid was one of the last grass parrakeets discovered and was
first described by Gould in 1840. It seems that it was not exactly unknown
in mid-Victorian aviculture, and there is a definite record of the purchase
of a pair by the Zoological Society of London in 1871 and of a further
single specimen from the famous dealer, A. Jamrach, in 1872. It was stated
that the dealer received the pair off a vessel coming direct from Adelaide.
After this, the species was not seen again for 60 years. When Seth-Smith
visited Australia in 1908 the ornithologists there considered it extinct and
by 1930 there must have seemed about as much chance of ever finding one
again as today there seems of sighting a Paradise Parrot!
Forshaw has explained that the nomadism of this rare parrot lessens the
chances of sighting it, and that irruptions of it occur at long and irregular
intervals. Suddenly late in 1931 one such irruption occurred and a very
few pairs were trapped and taken to Adelaide. The event was sensational
enough for the Australian Governor to acquire a pair to be presented to
the King of England, George V, whose love of parrots was well known. A
triumphal note appeared in the Avicultural Magazine (February 1932)
announcing the safe arrival of this rara avis on English shores on 9th Jan-
uary, 1932. They were housed at Royal Lodge, Windsor Great Park, under
the care of a Mrs. Fetherstonhaugh, who graciously allowed David Seth-
Smith the privilege of seeing them and afforded E.J. Boosey of the Keston
Foreign Bird Farm his "first and never-to-be-forgotten sight of these won-
derful little parrakeets, which turned out to be far more brilliantly coloured
than ever imagined from reading descriptions". No doubt Mrs. Fetherston-
haugh was also seeking advice from the top aviculturists. of the day. It
would be nice to know what became of this sensational pair, but I can
trace no record.
The Avicultural Society acquired an excellent coloured plate of the
Splendid Grass Parrakeet from the famous Australian ornithologist and
artist, Neville Cayley, which was published with an article by Seth-Smith
in the Magazine for April. The original was framed and presented to King
George V. In the May issue it was announced that "His Majesty the King
has been graciously pleased to grant his patronage to the Avicultural Soci-
ety".

pairs of these rare birds, which wisely included stock from the three
widely scattered areas where the few birds had been trapped. He under-
took a journey to a remote farm, where he purchased a hen which had
been caught by a hawk but luckily saved by the farmer, and he spent a
fortnight travelling over 1,500 miles through sparsely populated districts
largely on unmade bush tracks in the hope of sighting more of these birds
but to no avail. However, from one of the pairs he had purchased he reared
five youngsters, which left the nest in October 1932, making him the first
breeder of this species. By the end of 1932 he had reared ten, which
prompted his remark in the Avicultural Magazine (January 1933) that
"these results should prove that there is no harm in allowing aviculturists
to keep these rare parrakeets in their aviaries".
Late in 1933 the Duke of Bedford imported a pair from Australia and
graciously put them in the hands of the Keston Foreign Bird Farm, so that
the honour of being the first breeder outside Australia fell to E.J. Boosey
in 1934. The story of how he succeeded despite the counter efforts of X
or Old Nick has been charmingly told in the Avicultural Magazine (No-
vember 1934) and in his book "Foreign Bird Keeping". The Society's Medal
was awarded in December 1934. The Keston Foreign Bird Farm subse-
quently managed to build up a really fine breeding stock of what Boosey
called "this matchless little bird" and they had five or six excellent breeding
pairs "when the War broke out in 1939 and put paid to all one's endea-
vours".
The year 1939 also saw another sudden and this time far greater irrup-
tion of the Splendid Grass Parrakeet in South Australia and 500 to 1,000
of them were trapped. The morality of trapping such large numbers of
such a rare bird was debated. However, the avicultural market was flooded,
the prices fell and from that time the bird became commonplace in Austra-
lian aviculture. After the War when things became more or less normal
again and before Australia totally banned the export of her native birds in
1959, freely breeding stocks were sent abroad to Europe, USA and South
Africa, where in due course Splendid Grass Parrakeets have been bred in
their hundreds.
They were imported into South Africa in the late 1950s and from the
beginning they bred easily and in large numbers. They sold at between
#250 and #300 (R600) per pair, which was then worth considerably more
than the equivalent sum today, but currently they change hands for less
than a tenth of that sum, which brings them within the reach of any bird
keeper.
This parrakeet thrives with the most modest of housing and feeding.

So much has been written on the management of them, that any recom-
mendations here would be superfluous. It seems that they have become
steadier through the years, because the elaborate procedures advised in
the 1930s such as heated shelters and putting up string netting within the
flights to prevent them from flying headlong into the wire and breaking
their necks, have long been totally unnecessary. Even 20 years ago in
South Africa the breeders found them prone to death through being start-
led by some disturbance, especially at night, but the pair I have had since
1979 are as tame as Barbary Doves!
Their spectacular colouring in green, yellow, red and blue ensures their
great popularity and they are well known enough not to need description,
but it should be mentioned that their attractive appearance is much en-
hanced by the unusual waxlike sheen especially in the blue areas of the
face and head. No coloured plate can capture this feature and therefore
the bird has to be seen in the flesh and in sunlight to be fully appreciated.
Their true value as aviary birds He sin their extraordinarily gentle nature.
They may be kept with any small seedeaters without trouble, and in
marked contrast to many parrotlike birds, even small species like the love-
birds, they do not have the habit of nipping off the toes of other birds
in their own or adjacent aviaries if single wired. A male will, however,
usually see another male of the same species as a rival and conflicr will
arise between two breeding pairs, so that they are best housed in separate
aviaries for breeding unless the enclosure is large. All the Grass Parrakeets
are highly accommodating in aviary life and in this as in other respects the
Splendid is superlative among all the species. The Rev. H.D. Astley cleverly
described the behaviour of the Bourke's Parrakeet in 1911 and I quote his
remarks because they are even more applicable to the Splendid which, of
course, Astley never knew. "It is altogether an extremely gentle, quiet
little bird, and his gaiety is very inoffensive and restrained. He is never
boisterous: he is almost dull at times. If he could suddenly become incar-
nated in a human body, I feel he would suddenly join a body of old-
fashioned Quakers, and certainly never kick over the traces, or appear in
connection with any society scandal!" (Bird Notes, February 1911).
Their soft, sibilant chirrups must make them about the quietest of all
parrotlike birds to keep and no neighbour could possibly be disturbed by
them! They also indulge in an unparrotlike low-pitched piping reminiscent
of the Bullfinch. I have heard a male piping away contentedly to himself
while being transported many miles by car to a show.
Yet another advantage to them is that they are readily sexable, the
female in her muted tones of green and blue being a charming foil for her

colourful mate. Young Splendids more or less resemble the hen on leaving
the nest, but I have found it possible to sell them immediately in pairs
with reasonable certainty. The young cocks tend to be bigger especially
with regard to the head and feet. On several occasions when I had left the
ringing of a batch of babies whose feet had become too big for the ring to
be slipped on subsequently turned out to be males, while those whose
feet were still small enough for the rings to be slipped on, although not the
youngest, proved to be females. The young cocks also seem to have
slightly longer tails. Furthermore colour is the main distinguishing feature.
In the males the blue on the wings is wider and brighter, especially the
dark blue on the primaries, and the blue on the face is more extensive and
of a darker, cobalt shade in contrast to the female's turquoise shade. Males
also have a brighter yellow on the belly, which extends higher up than in a
female, and far brighter yellow under tail coverts. Females are generally
more olive green and males more of a grass green especially on the rump.
I have found it surprising that recently in South Africa the popularity
of Grass Parrakeets generally has been eclipsed by the craze for mutation
lovebirds but I have no doubt that they will have their turn again.
I, for one, am glad that after 50 years in aviculture the Splendid Grass
Parrakeet has not, despite inevitable inbreeding on a large scale, undergone
a confusing plethora of colour mutations. To my knowledge only the Blue
Mutation has so far been established. A beautiful coloured plate of it,
painted by R. David Digby, was published in the Avicuitural Magazine
for April-June, 1975.1 have not seen this mutation in South Africa yet.
The many Splendid Grass Parrakeets in our aviaries today are practi-
cally identical to the sensational pair presented to King George V 50 years
ago. That is how it should be, and the fact that there are now more of
them in captivity in many different countries the world over than in the
wild state, where they seem to be in a precarious position, is a satisfying
conclusion to one of the greatest avicuitural success stories of our time.

FREE FLYING BARBARY DOVES - MY INTRODUCTION TO THEM
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.994898" page_id="56284575"  page_num="163" year="" vol="">
By P. SPEAKMAN (Nr. Canterbury, Kent)
In 'Animals for Schools' Terry Mills and Jill Kealing considered that
Barbary Doves were aviary birds and were not ideal for free flying as they
were far too trusting and likely to walk up to the nearest cat with dire re-
sults. Surely this must apply to all cage and aviary birds living for genera-
tions in a totally sheltered environment. And yet, one hears of birds whose
natural habitat is vastly different from anything to be found in this country,
escaping and breeding to the extent of becoming a nuisance to fruit farmers.
I have read that there are apparently thriving communities of Barbary Doves
in some places which, if true, must mean that they have learnt to put not
their faith in felines. They have learnt that lesson, I suspect, through seeing
some of their number fall victims to predators.
Of my eight adult Barbaries the three oldest have survived freedom for
more than three years. The next oldest will have been flying free for three
years this summer, two were hatched last summer and a ninth is about to
leave the nest. But if they have learnt to distinguish friend from foe, I, too,
have also learnt a great deal in the process. If my ignorance had not been so
abysmal initially, I doubt if I would ever have contemplated keeping them.
A master at the school I went to in the twenties made a pole dovecote
out of a barrel and got a pair of Barbary Doves to put in it. Their fate was in
all probability a dire one, but I never heard what happened to them and so I
grew up with the idea that Barbary Doves were highly suitable doves for a
dovecote. When I returned home to the Wye Valley after the war, I decided
to have pigeons again. I had had various kinds before the war so I made a
dovecote and fixed it on a pole, only this time, I thought it would be nice to
have Barbary Doves in it, like that master at my school.
After the fortnight's incarceration I released them and they promptly
vanished into the adjacent wood and were never seen again. There were a lot
of Tawny Owls about and after dusk a dove roosting on an exposed branch
would not have much chance of survival.
After that experience I built a wire netting aviary around the dovecote
and got some more Barbaries. They were safe now, but they flung themselves
in terror against the wire whenever owls came near, their fear being, presu-
mably, instinctive. At dusk one evening a dove managed to escape under the
netting, but the owl caught him before he had gone twenty yards, and then
flew to the top of a nearby Cypress and hooted in triumph, just as I arrived
on the scene. I would never have thought it possible for an owl to catch an

escaping dove which is surely a faster and more agile flyer.
A year or two later I married and went abroad so I had to return the
doves to the petshop that I had bought them from.

Initial Casualties
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999523142857143" page_id="56284576"  page_num="164" year="" vol="">
We settled here in Kent 22 years ago. In the summer of 1976 I was given
three Barbary Doves. I accepted them gratefully, happy at the thought of
having some Barbaries again. It so happened that I had an empty aviary
which I had made to house Red Squirrels. I had wanted English ones in
preference to European Red Squirrels but had not been able to get any.
Soon it became apparent that three doves were one too many and to save
the youngest from further suffering I released it. I vanished almost immedi-
ately. Some weeks later the hen escaped while the door was open. She, too,
was never seen again. By now there was a fledgling which became the sole
survivor when the male got killed by a weasel - the one inch mesh was not
small enough to keep it out.
I transferred my one remaining dove to the stable and the following
spring obtained two females and a male but the latter died soon after. It
was bullied to death, I believe, by my own dove.
The casualties so far had been heavy but they were entirely due to my
own ignorance, not the doves.
I now had a pair and an unmated female. I released them from the stable
and they became my first free-flying Barbary Doves. By the end of the
summer they had two pairs of offspring making seven altogether - but not
for long. By now the parents were nesting and roosting in the garage. The
young roosted on the exposed branches of a nearby tree which became
more exposed as the autumn progressed. One night I heard owls hooting
and next morning there was only one young dove left out of the four. The
time had come, I decided, to shut the parents up in the stable for the winter
although I allowed the one young bird to remain at liberty. It went into the
garage at night and I was not able to shut it up during the day. Later that
winter, rats got into the stable and killed all three doves. Once again, I had
just one survivor and the end of another winter. This time, I got a single
companion and the two became very attached although it soon became clear
that they were both males. Again I turned to my suppliers, who are better
than the doves themselves at telling males from females, and they sent me
two more females. It was probably just as well that both males had had a
chance to get to know the locality before their new mates joined them. One
couple quickly paired off, and to avoid friction I shut the other pair in the
stable. I opened the window only after they had started nesting in the

stable. That winter I let them remain free since one pair roosted each night
in the garage and the other roosted in the stable and the only youngster to
have reached maturity roosted in dense Hawthorns. Somehow he had learnt
the unwisdom of roosting on exposed branches and although owls were
often around at night he was always alive and well the following morning.
And for my part I had learnt to make the stable more rat-proof.
Behaviour
Put two males together in the same confined space such as our stable and
the younger will be slaughtered, I have discovered. The dominant dove is
also the elder, the one I had bought in the spring of 1978 to be a mate for
the 'female 5 1 had bred the previous summer.
Of the two new females, the one which I took to be the elder mated
right away with my bought male who was already a mature male when my
own was still of indeterminate sex. They 'took over' the garage. A small win-
down was left permanently open and a Berberis bush beneath it stopped
cats from jumping up. The younger pair, as I have already mentioned, were
confined to the stable until I felt it was safe to let them go free. The older
male has been the dominant male ever since. He never loses a battle. Even
Collared Doves and pigeons concede victory to him. His method, after pre-
liminary wing boxing, is to jump on their backs and peck their heads with
an agility they cannot match.
This male's first offspring, my third male, takes after his father. All
three males associate me with food and will come to me when hungry
without bothering to see if there is food on their trays or not. First Male
very soon acquired the habit of landing on my head and staying there
while I walked to the garage and put food on his tray. Then, and then only,
would he condescend to fly down onto the tray.
Second Male, at about the same time, acquired the habit of flying onto
my shoulder and staying put until I had given him his food on the tray in
the stable. If he should fly onto my shoulder anywhere near First Male's
extensive territory, First Male will attack him and take his place.
Third Male's territory is the house into which he is forever coming and
doing nest-site cooing from the tops of cupboards. He is a pest and I have
today shut him up in a cage in the stable with a new mate (his old mate,
I discovered, was infertile). At first, he resented her intrusion and tried to
kill her but accepted her with resignation after an hour or two. In a couple
of days, judging by past behaviour, he will have happily accepted his new
mate and will have forgotten his ertswhile spouse.
His feeding technique is quite different from the other two. He will

only fly onto my wrist if I have a food bowl in my hand. At other times
he lands at my feet and walks with me to his food tray - unless the porch
door is open when he will go straight into the porch and find the food bowl
that I keep there, or he will go into the kitchen to see if there is any dog
biscuit in the dog bowl.
None of the females associates me with food but only food places.
If one tray is empty they will scout around until they find a tray with
food in it. They seem unconcerned about 'territory'.
When it comes to roosting, they have various favoured trees around the
perimeter of this small holding, usually dense Hawthorns and Hollies. They
seem to realise that exposed branches are unsafe. The roosting places can
be a long way from their respective territories which seem to centre on
feeding areas and nest sites. Curiously they never go outside the perimeter
as if they sensed that beyond it was alien territory.
On wet, windy winter nights I have known them all to come inside,
with five or more roosting amicably together at one end of the garage.
Though First Male is a tiger by day and will send any intruder packing, he
seems quite docile at dusk. At sunset yesterday I saw him with two other
males, all three sitting peacefully together, side by side on the electricity
cable.
They are quite extraordinarily trusting towards our dog. She knows they
are sacrosanct and will step around them. A couple of days ago, two doves
were lying drowsily in the sunshine on a garden path when Teddie came
trotting along. They were not much more than a foot apart but neither
moved a muscle as she trotted between them.
With cats, however, it is a different matter. One day, two doves were
perched four or five feet above ground by the back door, when a black
and white cat stalked by beneath them. They froze into total immobility
and watched the cat closely with a side-eye scrutiny. The cat continued
on its way without seeing them. The slightest movement on their part
would have drawn his attention to them.
They always seem nervous of strangers - which includes me if I happen
to be wearing something different. They relax as soon as I speak, they seem
to know the sound of my voice better than my appearance.
Their own voices are quite different from one another. First Male has
a very deep 'coo', a bit like an owl hoot. Second Male is fairly high pitched
and Third Male adds on a couple of 'cooks' at the end, making his a four-
syllable 'coo'. He likes to fly onto our bedroom window and 'coo' at 5.30
in the morning, which is another good reason for shutting him up!
First Male, who is paler than all the others and produced white offspring

from time to time, one would expect to be the most 'domestic' and the
least 'wild' of them all, yet his display flights are of the most spectacular.
He glides with wings and tail spread in a 20 yard diameter circle back to
his favourite cooing post, the top of the electricity pole.
Second Female bears the closest resemblance to her wild ancestor
Streptopelia roseogrisea , being a much darker brown with more pale blue-
grey feathers on her wing leading edges. She is very nervous and is off like
a flash if alarmed. Her mate responds likewise if he has not seen what has
scared her. If he has seen the cause of her alarm, a too hasty movement of
my hand perhaps, then he takes no notice of her behaviour.
In flight also she differs from the others since her wing beats are more
rapid and she twists and turns in flight with extreme rapidity.

Feeding and Diet

<bodyText confidence="0.999793269230769" page_id="56284579"  page_num="167" year="" vol="">
The males will deny younger males from feeding in their territory and
deaths have resulted. I lost my youngest male a couple of months ago,
because the two other males who were happily "mated" to each other,
would not let him feed. He would come to me and feed from a bowl
held in one hand while with my other, I fended off the other two. He
was also a single dove with no companion. Barbaries seem to 'mate' quite
happily with another of the same sex but will go off in search of a mate if
they have no companion. One day, this youngest dove was away all day.
The next day he appeared briefly. I never saw him again. It would seem that
each pair needs a separate feeding place, preferably off the ground, within
their chosen territory and that a single dove should be kept in a cage until a
companion can be provided.
Until a month ago, I have been feeding the doves on the same food that
I have been giving to the pigeons - wheat and barley. The doves I had after
the war used to have millet and my pigeons always used to get the usual
pigeon mixture. Then as the various items became more expensive and my
birds increased in number, I gave them increasing quantities of wheat and
barley until eventually they got wheat and barley alone, damped with sea
water. The reason for the latter I will explain later.
When the doves arrived, they got wheat and barley like the pigeons, it
seemed quite unnecessary to give them millet but I have just recently dis-
covered that they must have millet particularly those with squabs to feed.
Last summer I lost two females, both with fledglings which were after-
wards raised to maturity by the father. The females with young and some
of the males would leave full trays of food here and go off to a neighbour's
house to pinch the mixed grain he gives his chickens. The one item they

needed must have been cracked maize. I have had a lot of young birds dying
before they had left the nest and I believe now that the reason was inade-
quate diet.
The house they went to is out of sight from us and it was quite a feat on
their part to discover they could get the food they needed there. The people
there own a cat and a feral ginger is a frequent visitor. A dove scratching
around for left-over grains would be an easy prey.
I discovered my error a month ago, when I happened to have a packet
of wild bird food and I thought I would try it on the second pair in the
stable. They had (and still have) a squab, their second this season. Their
first had sickened and died just before it was fully fledged.
Both parents fell upon this wild bird seed with great eagerness. I noticed
that they were carefully picking out the millet. I had earlier tried them on
lentils and they would not touch them. Crushed maple peas and tick beans
were also rejected.
This was very strange for though Second Female would have had millet
before I bought her three years ago, Second Male was bred by me and had
never seen millet. Yet now that he had been given it, he would not touch
the wheat. Every time I put wheat on the board, he flies from my shoulder
on to the board, takes a quick look and flies back to my shoulder where he
stays until I put millet on the board. If his offspring pesters him for food
while he is eating, he will fly back on to my shoulder, as if to say "Remove
that brat, he's spoiling my appetite'. I accordingly oblige.
Another food they are very fond of is crushed dog biscuit, they prefer
it and millet to cracked maize, the latter is much preferred to-wheat. So
now I hope that as long as I can keep up the supply of their chosen food,
they will not try to find food elsewhere. There will also, I hope, be fewer
squab deaths.
A few days ago, I was wetting the pigeons' food with sea water in a
bucket in the garage, when First Male left the millet on his food tray and
flew down on to the bucket I was holding. He then hopped down into the
bucket and started drinking the sea water at the bottom of the bucket. I
had not previously given the doves sea water, although it was always avail-
able to them in the pigeons' food as a natural prophylactic.
Illnesses
Since I started keeping pigeons again, sixteen years ago, my birds have
suffered from one disease only, which was diagnosed years ago as "crop
mycosis". It was always fatal if untreated and only a few that I treated
with Nystan recovered. Then one day I noticed pigeons pecking around

the bowl of sea water I put out for the geese. I experimented and arrived
at a dosage of two cubic centimetres of sea water night and morning, given
by pipette. It has proved an infallible cure.
Sometimes the doves have shown mycosis symptoms and I have given
them 1 c.c. night and morning. They have recovered often after one day.
A squab once broke a wing bone somehow in a fall from the nest. I
found a pigeon wing feather and cut the feather part from the spine which
I used as a splint. This I stuck on with Plastic Padding and held it in place
until it set. Within a few days the bird was flying, not quite as well as its
sibling, but well enough. I was very interested to see if it would eventually
be able to fly normally but alas one windy night when owls were around,
the garage door blew open and both young birds disappeared.
More recently, one of my two 'mated' males appeared one afternoon
with a ghastly wound. Its whole chest and crop were exposed, the skin
having been completely ripped off. Upon investigation, I found that the
skin had an L-shaped tear a full inch in each direction and more than a
square inch of flesh was exposed. Yet it was 'cooing' and behaving quite
normally, totally unaware of its wound and not apparently in any pain.
I was able to catch it because it came into the kitchen, and I soaked
the whole area in warm salt water to clean the wound and soften the
skin, then while I held it and drew the skin together with tweezers, my
wife stitched it up. It seemed to feel no pain and was no less tame after-
wards. In fact, no medication has ever made them less tame or less trust-
ing. That bird has fully recovered, the feathers have grown over the area
and it might never have happened.

My first free-flying doves started nesting in thick hedges using old
Blackbird nests as a basis for their nests. The first nest was abandoned
when the female was badly clawed by some animal - a rat, I suspect - the
second nest was raided and the culprit this time was probably a magpie.
Thereafter, they nested in the garage, they made two nests which were
used alternately. That pair was killed by rats the following winter but
their two nests have been used by their successors for three years.
The pair in the stable have their nest at the back of a hen coop that
I have fixed against the wall about five feet from the floor. They have
used the same nest for three years, they do not add to it much and it is
like reinforced concrete, a mixture of twigs and droppings.
The garage pair choose nesting material with infinite care, every piece
must look like a piece of fine wire somewhat bent. In fact, upon investi-

gation, I found one of their nests contained seven pieces of wire.
Unfortunately, in spite of all that care, the result is terrible. They have
no skill whatever.
First Male has site-called in a variety of places in and outside the garage
but his three mates have always used the same two nests.
One of his nest-sites was at the end of a shelf just below the roof, so I
made them a nest using wiry strands of honeysuckle with a pad of hay in
the bottom. I wired it securely in place and within minutes he was in it
'cooing' with approval.
For the next week, the pair tried out each nest in turn before finally
according my nest the ultimate accolade of their approval in the shape of
an egg. Very civil of them!
Conclusion
It is now nearly five years since I was given those three doves, I bought
six more, I now have ten including two recently hatched, but I have lost
nineteen, which seems a very large number of casualties and that does not
include nestlings that have died before leaving the nest. From now on, I
sincerely hope to lose far fewer and that many more young birds will
reach maturity.
If I was starting again from scratch, I would have two aviaries and keep
a breeding pair in one and use the other to house the young. I would wait
until I had at least six young ones before releasing them.
Having the stable and garage available to house two breeding pairs is a
great asset, since it enables me to have a measure of control and still allow
the parents to be free-flying.
The young are all too prone to flutter down from the nest before they
can fly. Since it happens in a building, they are fairly safe, and I can put
them back in their nests. I think it will be some time before they raise
young successfully outside.
They are not really much trouble and they are worth it many times
over.

DX Spilsbury writes: "1981 was a very poor year for breeding with
our Amazon parrots. Eggs were laid by A rnazona aestiva, A. autumnalis
autumnalis (two pairs), A. a. salvini (two pairs), A. a. lilacini, A. collaria,
A, finschi, A. ochrocephala oratrix (two pairs), A. ventralis, A. vinacea and
A. viridigenalis. Of these, single young from A. autumnalis autumnalis, A.
viridigenalis and A. finschi
viridigenalis and A. finschi were hatched and hand-reared from six, 22 and
eight days respectively. Two hybrid A aestiva x A. panamensis were reared
by their parents."
Of these young, perhaps the most interesting was autumnalis which
hatched after 23 days' incubation (I do not conclude by this single example
that 23 days is normal for this species!). The egg was taken from the par-
ents when the hen began to neglect her duties at 12 days and placed under
an A. aestiva hen whose eggs were later dead in shell."

A recent press release by the Research Institute for Avian Medicine,
Nutrition and Reproduction, Lake Worth, Florida, outlines details of what
is believed to be the first psittacine produced by artificial insemination.
Dr. G.J. Harrison's interest in this reproductive method began when he and
Dr. George Gee, reproductive physiologist at Patuxent Wildlife Research
Centre, went to Puerto Rico in the spring of 1981 to experiment with this
procedure in the endangered Puerto Rican parrot and the Hispaniolan.
Although semen was collected from these species with a technique Dr. Gee
had used on cranes at Patuxent, the trials were not successful as the
quality and quantity of the sperm were not satisfactory.
Back at Lake Worth, Dr. Harrison continued to train tame and imprin-
ted birds for semen collection. On 12th October 1981, the attempts were
successful with a male Budgerigar and the semen was immediately trans-
ferred with a PCV tube to a female who had been housed alone. After re-
peated collections and inseminations, the first fertile egg was laid on 5th
December and hatched in 17 days in an incubator (Petersime Model 1) at
99*F, 85*F wet bulb. It was reared to two days old by foster parents
when it was lost from the nest.
In the meantime, two cinnamon Cockatiel hens that had been housed
together for three months began to lay. Since initial attempts at semen

collection from Cockatiels produced no results, cross-species fertilisation
with a Budgerigar was attempted. Eggs proved to be infertile.
On the 8th and again on the 12th February, 1982, an albino male
Cockatiel produced a sample that from colour and microscopic evaluation
appeared to be of high quality, even though the volume was only half that
of the initial Budgerigar sample and only one-tenth that of subsequent
samples from a trained Budgerigar.
The semen was transferred to one of the cinnamon hens by inserting
the PCV tube X A inch into the cloaca and depositing it towards the approxi-
mate location of the vaginal opening, as direct observation was not possible.
Eggs laid on 13th, 15th and 17th February were fertile but those laid later
were not.
The first egg was cracked on 28th February, repaired with paraffin wax
and hatched on 2nd March in an incubator at 98.75*F, 80*F wet bulb.
"Alpha" weighed 3 grams and was' reared by foster parent Budgerigars for
the first six days, then brought into the Propagation Centre and hand
reared. The other two eggs hatched on 5th and 7th March respectively.
Fertile eggs have been produced by Eclectus using AT. at Patuxent and

has produced a semen sample at the Institute - attempts with Queen of

One of the most frequent enquiries we get at Padstow Bird Gardens, in
Cornwall, when the late spring has produced good weather, usually con-
cerns whether we have had a humming bird escape. This year has proved
an exceptional year for "humming birds" and most days several are seen
within the gardens. The creature concerned is the day-flying Humming
Bird Hawk Moth, a migrant to these shores and to the layman, I suppose,
easily mistaken for its avian counterpart because of its fast wing
beat, sheer speed in flight and its mode of feeding from blossom.

The results of a census on cranes kept in British collections in 1980,
undertaken by J. Blossom is published in Ratel, the journal of the Associa-
tion of British Wild Animal Keepers. Thirteen species, totalling 405 indi-
viduals, were recorded with Demoiselle, East African Crowned and Sarus
being the most plentiful. Details of the year's breeding activities are out-
lines as are diets, longevity and early breeding records.

The Yellow-fronted Gardener Bowerbird Amblyornis flavifrons , long
known from three skins sold to the Tring Museum by a plume merchant in
1895, has been rediscovered. Professor Jared Diamond, working for the
World Wildlife Fund in the Foja (Gauttier) Mountains in Irian Jay a loca-
ted the species again. No specimens were obtained but detailed descrip-
tions of male, female and juvenile plumage were made, also of display
behaviour and bower construction. Detailed notes appear in Science,
23rd April 1982, Vol 216, No. 4544, and I am grateful to Professor Dia-
mond for forwarding a copy to review for this column.
The Foja Mountains peak at 2,200 metres, are heavily timbered with
a light covering of moss above 1400 m, and a heavy moss cover above

1900 m. The adjacent lowlands contain a sparse human population but in
the Foja Mountains there is no evidence, other than the existence of the
other three specimens, that the area has ever previously been visited by
humans. A national park encompasses the area so the population, which
Professor Diamond, estimates at several thousand, would seem to be safe.

In recent years the quality of bird books produced in Australia has
been very impressive, not only in content but in the paper, reproduction
and binding. Two newly available volumes from Rigby Publishers Ltd.
(Adelaide) are no exception.
''Birds of Australian Gardens" by Tess Kloot (Archivist to the Royal
Australasian Ornithologists(R) Union) and Ellen M. McCulloch (Secretary
of the Australian Bird Observers' Club) covers all the bird species seen in
Australian urban areas. One hundred and seven species are included and
the various names, description, voice, food, distribution and instructions
for spotting and recording are given with each. Eighty species are illustrated
by very beautiful full page colour plates painted by Peter Trusler, the ori-
ginals of which have been purchased by the National Bank of Australia to
form a permanent collection. Their importance is undoubted; the colouring
and the precise depiction of each bird and its typical background flora are
exquisite.
Peter Slater, author of "Rare and Vanishing Australian Birds" (96 pp.
#10.0) points out that few Australian birds have become extinct since the
arrival of European settlers but that is no reason for complacency. A
number of birds have come close to extinction, several species have not
been sighted for many years and some are listed as rare. This book is a
scholarly and eloquent plea for the preservation of Australia's endangered
species of birds. The text covers the problems facing Australia's bird life
and the cause of the decline in numbers of the 53 rare and vanishing
species described in this book, particularly the ground feeding and ground
dwelling birds. The story of their original discovery is also told. Each
species is illustrated in colour by the author.
Both these books can be obtained from the publisher's London office
or from the Sladmore Gallery, 32 Bruton Place, London W.l, where a
permanent display of the leather-bound, limited edition bird books also
produced by Rigby, may be seen.
Groom Helm publish some very interesting and unusual bird books,
some of which are translations of Scandinavian productions. Amongst
recent issues are:-
"Mountain Wildlife" by Richard Perry (177 pp., 19 black and white
photographs, #6.95). An account by this well-known ornithologist of the
mammals and birds to be found on mountains all over the world and their
adaptation to this specialised environment.

"The Breeding Birds of Europe" by Manfred Pforr and Alfred Lim-
brunner. Volume I - Divers to Auks (327 pp., #14.95), Volume II- Sand-
grouse to Crows (387 pp., #17.95). Described as photographic handbooks,
these volumes will be purchased mainly for their superb colour illustra-
tions, four for each species showing the bird in its environment, in flight,
the young and the nest with eggs. They must constitute the most com-
prehensive collection of colour photographs ever made of Europe's breed-
ing birds. The brief information given for each species is not remarkable
being that found in many other guides and the accuracy of some of the
maps is doubtful, but the camera cannot lie and the illustrations will give
many hours of pleasure and instruction.
"Wings and Seasons" by Gunnar Brusewitz (119 pp, #12.95) is a most
attractively produced book that would make an acceptable present. The
author is one of Sweden's most popular nature illustrators and here
describes the progress of the year in the wild in northern Europe, from the
far South right up to the shores of the Arctic. This personal account is
illustrated by the author's attractive water colours.
A group of Scandinavian artists have also illustrated Blandford's "The
British Ornithologists' Guide to Bird Life", edited by Jim Flegg (309 pp,
300 colour illustrations, line drawings. #10.95). Though too big to be
carried in the pocket and therefore not a true field guide, much more in-
formation is given for each species than is normally possible in such vol-
umes. Very adequate instructions for field identification are given.
"The Conservation of New World Parrots" edited by Roger F. Pasquier
(485 pp. #8.00 including postage and packing, from the International
Council for Bird Preservation, 219c Huntingdon Road, Cambridge CB3 ODL)
is the Proceedings of the ICBP Parrot Working Group which met on St.
Lucia in 1980. It contains definitive papers on the distribution, population
and conservation status of Amazona parrots of the Caribbean islands and
on all mainland parrot species of the New World. Also included are papers
on importation and general management and three papers delivered at the
Conference on Parrots of Australia and New Zealand.
Depressing reading on the whole but it is encouraging to note, in
the introduction by Joseph Forshaw, chairman of this Group, "Though
mindful of the expertise and significant achievements of private avicul-
turists, the Working Group unanimously adopted the policy of supporting
captive propagation only when it is an integral component of a compre-
hensive conservation program based on sound management principles and

carried out by, or under the auspices of, appropriate government agencies,";
certainly a more progressive view than the blanket condemnation of avi-
culturists propounded by some conservationists.
A pity that some of the species in "The Doomsday Book of Animals"
by David Day, published by Ebury Press (275 pp. #14.95) were not bred
in captivity before they became extinct in the wild. In this very readable
and original book the author documents the extinction of almost 300
species and subspecies over the last 300 years, describing each animal's
appearance, behaviour and habitat, as well as its last days. The book is
beautifully illustrated by Tim Bramfitt, Peter Hayman, Mick Loates and
Maurice Wilson, all of whom have made a first-class job of reconstructing
their subjects in colour. Very good value.
The author of "Quail. Their Breeding and Management", published by
the World Pheasant Association (108 pp. Ulus. #6.95) is Gary Robbins, a
founder member of the Quail Group of the WPA and a member of the
Avicultural Society whose articles on Quail have appeared in our own
Magazine. As one would expect, it is a very comprehensive and authorita-
tive guide to this rather neglected family and covers all aspects of Quail
management from aviary design to feeding and rearing. All 44 species are
included.
The Fauna of Tasmania Cofnmittee's Handbook No. 2 is a "Tasmanian
Bird Atlas", compiled by David Thomas. Each bird of Tasmania and its
offshore islands is accorded a separate and highly detailed distribution map
which also includes information on its status, habitat, food and manner of
foraging, as well as its distribution. This very useful addition to the litera-
ture on Antipodean birds may be obtained from the Fauna of Tasmania
Office, University of Tasmania, Box 252C, GPO Hobart, Tasmania, Aus-
tralia 7001. The price most recently quoted, including postage and packing,
was 4.00 Australian dollars but it might be wise to enquire first.
"Cage and Aviary Birds" by Richard Mark Martin, published by Collins
(paperback, 256 pp. #3.95) is a good introduction to the subject and has
general notes on housing, feeding and management and a useful bibliog-
raphy for further reading. The main part of this book is devoted to a des-
cription of all the species that are likely to be available to aviculturists and
each is excellently illustrated in colour by Malcolm Ellis, a well-known con-
tributor to the Avicultural Magazine and the artist of the Rothschild's
Grackle on our cover. A very useful guide at a modest price.

"Diets for Birds in Captivity", published by Blandford (222 pp. #19.95)
is written by Kenton C. Lint and Alice Marie Lint. K.C. Lint, Curator of
Birds at San Diego Zoo for 28 years, wrote this book with his wife when
he retired and it is the distillation of an enormous amount of practical
knowledge acquired at one of the greatest zoos in the world. It fills a vital
gap in the avicultural bookshelf because all orders of birds kept in captivity
are covered in the one volume. Each family is described generally with an
indication of natural food preferences followed by a detailed daily diet,
the amounts to be given and the times at which they should be fed. Alter-
natives are suggested for different parts of the world and there are useful
appendices listing commercial products, vitamin and mineral supplements
and the propagation of live foods. There is a very good bibliography. The
only thing wrong with this book is the price which, considering its length
and total lack of any illustrations, is rather stunning. A pity, for it ought
to make a significant contribution to good husbandry and better breeding
results.

R. David Digby. Published by Collins. 188 pages, 4T plates with numerous
black and white sketches. 1982. Price #15.
Like many books on avicultural subjects, there has been a tendency in
some of the more recent ornithological monographs for the authors not to
be totally conversant with their subjects. One notable case left the reader
seeking an out-of-print volume for many of the details on the family's
biology, after spending over #60 on the monograph. Many tricks have been
used by publishers to raise the price - large lettering, broad borders and
limited editions being amongst them - and generally they have been able to
get away with it because the plates have been superb.
It is not until a publishing company with Collins's reputation for quality
and value for money produces such a volume as this one, that one appre-
ciates what can be achieved. Omit the large lettering and broad borders,
thus giving the text on less pages, and produce it in sufficient numbers to
allow quality reproduction of the plates at a reasonable cost and one is a
third of the way to producing a very good book.

The author, Tom Cade, may not be too familiar to readers of this
Magazine save for several news items, but as Professor of Ornithology at
Cornell University, he is responsible for the highly successful breeding
programme for the Peregrine Falcon and has carried out much research
over the years on falcons, making him a foremost authority on the sub-
ject. He combines both an authoritative and readable text which makes
this volume not only a valuable ornithological work but a good "read" for
those with only a passing interest. Quite technical terms are explained in
everyday language and as such, not only is it a must for the ornithologist
interested in wild falcons but indispensable for the aviculturists who main-
tain these birds in captivity. Whatever one's interest in falcons, or for that
matter in good bird books, this is a valuable addition to any library.
Like most monographs, each species is illustrated by a painting, in this
case by R. David Digby, an artist familiar to most readers of the Avicul-
tural Magazine. The plates are excellent and cannot fail to impress with
their quality, as one would expect from one of the world's foremost
artists.
The text is divided into two sections. The first covers the general
biology of falcons; specific data are discussed more fully in the second
section which deals separately with each of the 39 species of the genus
Falco. The whole is interspersed with line drawings and a map for each
species, except Falco kreyenborgi , is to be found at the end. A detailed
bibliography and an index round off what is a truly magnificent and
thoroughly recommendable volume. All monographs published in the
future should be compared with this volume for quality of production,
text and plates at this price. I wonder how many will measure up?

Unusual Cockatoo Feeding Habits
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.987012777777778" page_id="56284591"  page_num="179" year="" vol="">
In the January-March 1979 issue of this magazine, I published a brief
note on an unusual habit of a Lesser Sulphur-crested Cockatoo which used
to pick up seeds with one of its feet,passing them to the bill.
I can now quote another case which refers to a Bare-eyed Cockatoo
Cacatua sanguinea, a male bom here four years ago from parents of Aus-
tralian origin.
The other day I had temporarily left a bucket filled to the brim with
moistened maize, at about 10 cm from the flight in which the above-men-
tioned bird was housed. Coming back to collect the bucket I noticed that
the cockatoo was sticking one of its legs through the wire mesh, desperately
trying to grasp at the rim of the bucket. I then put a few grains on the
ground, 5-6 cm from the wire, and immediately the bird proved itself able
to get at them using the same method.
A Red-tailed Black Cockatoo, in the same compartment, and a pair of
Hyacinthine Macaws in the adjoining one had attentively watched these
curious "fishing" operations but, though they had been put in identical
experimental conditions, they proved unable to solve the problem in the
same brilliant way.

Dr. H. Quinque's reply to "A Dissenting View of Aviculture"

It is regrettable that Mr. Morrison did not communicate with me first
before writing this aggressive article for he has made several statements
which must be corrected.
Our readers must excuse me for replying subjectively but I hope that in
so doing, I will be the spokesman for all conscientious and responsible

Firstly, the most serious assertion, made in a magazine with an inter-
national circulation, concerns the means by which I obtained the Horned
Parrots Eunymphicus c. cornutus, and here Mr. Morrison is totally in-
correct.
New Caledonia is not, as he has said in error, a Department of France
though it is linked to France by its language, culture and highly developed
legislation. The Governments of New Caledonia and of France both gave
me permission to obtain the birds, which were given free of any charge,
and to import them into France mindful, I think, of the quality of my
accommodation and experience. Moreover, the New Caledonians are
delighted with the results that I have obtained with their native birds. The
letters received from the various administrations concerned and the many
newspaper cuttings that I have collected are convincing testimony of this.
Furthermore, the most recent article to appear in the New Caledonia
press was an account of my success with Drepanoptila holosericea, the
Cloven-feathered Dove, which I have reared repeatedly, although all
attempts to do so in New Caledonia have failed.
I strongly refute the assertion that aviculturists are callous and that on
some occasions in their lives they have been insensitive to the
suffering or death of an animal. This is not say that cruelty to animals
does not exist and we must struggle against it. I recall, with sorrow, an
account brought to me several years ago by one of the members of the
French team for clay pigeon shooting which was invited to Australia.
After the championship, the Australians invited the French delegation
to a "parrot hunt". The means used to attract the birds within rifle shot
was a wounded parrot which was thrown into the air to make it scream.
I would not be so stupid or cruel as to indite Australia, the country
in which this happened, but I think that perhaps Mr Morrison should
have much to occupy himself with on Australian soil, before turning
to New Caledonia or France.
According to Mr. Morrison, ornithologists regard us aviculturists with
contempt. I would like to point out that I have been the pupil and friend
of exceptional men who have been as much aviculturists as ornithologists
Firstly, M. Aime Decoux, licenciate of Medieval English Literature, and
also a great ornithologist and able aviculturist. He published many articles
and participated in the famous treatise "Aviculture", in three volumes,
under the direction of Dr. Delacour. Now dead, he taught me to appreciate
and to breed the most difficult birds during the last thirty years. He devo-
ted his entire fortune to them and he died almost in poverty having given
everything to his birds. He is devoutly thanked for this.

I have equally the honour of having been the pupil and friend of our
President, Dr. Jean Delaeour, ornithologist of the greatest international
reputation who is not ashamed of being amongst the most able avicul-
turists hi the world.
I am equally grateful to my friend, Dr. Etienne Beraut, a Frenchman
living in Brazil, a great friend of Dr. Delaeour, who gave me, in the field in
the Amazon and the interior of Brazil, moral and technical lessons which
I shall never forget.
I have benefited equally from the teaching of numerous other great
ornithologists, from France and from other countries, which has allowed
me, without great merit, to become what could be called a well-informed
amateur.
When I say that aU the birds having lived with me, in pairs, have repro-
duced themselves without exception, and that all my income as a surgeon
is devoted to birds in danger, I do not think that ornithologists will hold
me in contempt or find my activity "monstrous". They will perhaps
even feel that Mr. Morrison is mistaken in creating this division between
aviculturists and ornithologists for their work is mutually complimentary
rather than exclusive.
As to ideas concerning the conservation of habitat and of the biotope,
we have, of course, held them for a long time but unfortunately reality
asserts itself and dreamers achieve nothing. As man progresses, he des-
troys the natural life which surrounds him. The most prolific terrestrial
mammal, after the rodents, man's feeding needs and his ancestral way of
life force him to deforest and to cultivate to survive. The aborigines have
had their way of life since time immemorial Often with little understand-
ing we try to impose our methods on them which they resist, occasionally
very strongly.
I have seen the burning of millions of acres of African scrub to cultivate
in one season a small piece of land 2,000 m square. Year after year,
animals disappear irrevocably; this is even more critical for island fauna,
by definition limited and with no possibility whatsoever of readapting by
themselves to another territory.
New Caledonia Mid the islet of Ouvea in the Loyalty archipelago are
obvious examples.
No one will persuade the Kanakas that the parrakeets are rare, given
that this is the only bird that they see nearly every day. They do not im-
agine that the bud's disappearance is possible though they are, in fact,
nearer the truth than the total of 200 parrakeets quoted in 1974. The
recent census that I followed with interest revealed that there are, happily,

more than 500 pairs. Also I had the opportunity to see that the nests were
recorded and attributed to each family.
In spite of all the efforts, often as praiseworthy as derisive, the habitat
of the Ouvean Parrakeet will not, for many years, be able to resist the
pressure of human population and the destruction of nature which this en-
tails.
Concerning Eunymphicus c. comutus of the Grande Terre, Dr. Jean
Delacour, author of "Guide des Oiseaux de Nouvelle Caledonie", whom I
have just consulted, confirms that 20 years ago, this subspecies was much
more widespread in the forests of the mountains and that almost no birds
were captured. He thinks that the only real danger is the destruction of the
forests, the birds' indispensable environment, and this is progressing very
rapidly.
Endangered species of birds should be regarded as historic monuments
left to us by our ancestors; we are their inheritors and keepers. Protection
of habitat and maintenance in captivity doubles the chances of survival of
species in danger of extinction. Protection of habitat alone, relying on
man's goodwill or on repression, is too uncertain and must be supple-
mented by the safeguard of captive maintenance.
I prefer to hand on to our descendants birds that are living well in
captivity in spacious, attractive aviaries, than send them to see dusty skins
in the glass cases of museums.
I would like to add that since the publication of my first article on rear-
ing the Horned Parrot, I have reared many more, particularly second
generation birds, all in perfect health and not showing the slightest sign of
degeneration or mutation. It would be very desirable if any other breeders
of this species could communicate their breeding results, as this would
contribute to a better knowledge of this parrot's biology and, thereby, its
conservation. It is much easier to make precise observations of birds in
captivity and this is particularly important for birds about which we know
almost nothing in the wild.
It is not with hostility and the threat of sanction that we shall obtain
what is necessary.
For my part, I intend to publish soon certain very interesting breeding
results when I have time.

Rare Birds and Aviculture

<bodyText confidence="0.99272136" page_id="56284595"  page_num="183" year="" vol="">
In 1975 (Avicultural Magazine No. 4, p. 237) Mr F.C. Barnicoafs
letter on the smuggling of rare Australian parrots appeared and in it he
explained the system operated by the Transvaal Provincial Administration
which, from a fauna station near Pretoria, supplied certain species of native
birds to approved aviculturists - provided that the breeding season had
been successful and, naturally, only species that were suitable for avicul-
ture. He claimed that "once a legal source of birds became available, the
illegal trapping that had defied the law for decades virtually disappeared".
He suggested that this would also happen in Australia if the Department of
Conservation operated a carefully controlled scheme on similar lines.
Mr Alastair Morrison replied in 1976 {AviculturalMagazineNo. 2, p. 117)
with hostile criticism of Mr Barnicoafs views and in his letter he said that
the Hooded and Golden-shouldered Parrakeets "had no serious natural
predators". If that is correct, what is it that controls their numbers? In a
stable population the death rate must approximate to the birth rate and so
if a pair of these parrakeets reared three young in a season, the total of
five would by the next breeding season be back to two - not necessarily
the same two, of course.
No doubt prolonged drought and floods would take a toll of the birds,
but presumably it must be the food supply that is the controlling factor
and so, if in a normal breeding season a few of the young were taken when
they were independent of the parents, it would seem that no harm would
be done to the population as a whole, and though probably such a course
would be quite impracticable, Mr Barnicoafs suggestion is not so wicked
after all. Professor Hodges in the subsequent correspondence said that in

Australian and European collections both Hooded and Golden-shouldered
were being successfully bred and if that is so, there should be no need to
take any more from the wild, even legally.
In 1980 ( Avicultural Magazine , No. 2, p. 108) Mr Morrison wrote on
the Rothschild's Grackle, Starling or Myna and claimed that aviculturists
will bear a heavy load of guilt if this species becomes extinct on its native
Bali.
His photograph, with the caption saying that it depicted the habitat of
Rothschild's Starling, showed a scene that would strike dismay into the
heart of any starling except perhaps Acridotheres tristis, the Common
Myna or Stumus vulgaris the Starling, for there were only a few straggling
trees to be seen. If the Balinese authorities are no more efficient at the
management of large areas of natural forest than they evidently were a few
years ago at preventing the catching and export of this starling when large
numbers appeared on the (presumably Singapore) market, then the future
of Leucopsar rothschildi is gloomy indeed, for how many species of
insectivorous passerine birds have been bred even to the second generation
in aviaries? Plainly much more needs to be known about the dietetic re-
quirements of insectivorous birds. Incidentally the bird-keeping as evi-
dently practised in Indonesia is not what most members would consider
aviculture.
In the case of the Horned and Uvean Parrakeets whose record in cap-
tivity has been mostly one of. failure, although Dr. Quinque's recent suc-
cesses are promising, it is difficult to tell whether they could be propa-
gated generation after generation in aviaries. Obviously it is better to have
the aviaries in the native country rather than in some inhospitable climate,
but the care and standards of hygiene would need to be of the very best.
In some cases there is much to be said for putting some specimens on
suitable islands provided that food and nesting places are there and preda-
tors not a serious problem. Many ornithologists are opposed to any such
introductions, but it is also happening naturally, the most remarkable case
in our lifetime being the spread of the Collared Dove from southern Asia
to north-western Europe. The Cattle Egret Bubulcus ibis has spread from
tropical and sub-tropical parts of the Old World to tropical South America
and to Australia and there are other instances of species spreading success-
fully when a niche is available to them.
There is a lot of emotive talk about depleting the wild stocks, but they
are being depleted all the time by natural agency and the only time when
augmentation takes place is, of course, the breeding season. The greatest
threat to all but the most adaptable of plant and animal life is the alarming

Simulation Hybridisation
</table>
<bodyText confidence="0.9972142" page_id="56284597"  page_num="185" year="" vol="">
As pointed out by Derek Goodwin in his excellent article "Bird Fancy-
ing, Foe of Aviculture" in the last issue, there are many other factors ad-
verse to aviculture in the world today. I am writing now to elaborate on
just one of those unfavourable practices, namely simulation hybridisation.
I will also briefly discuss my views on hybridisation in general.
In recent avicultural history, with the increased number of psittacines
being bred, there has grown an intense interest in producing hybrids be-
tween certain species, and even inter-generic mixtures. This interest, more
often than not, stems from a strong desire to produce a first-ever cross,
whether it be for avicultural recognition or simply capital gain for an
unusual looking hybrid. I choose the word "unusual looking" to describe
these avian mongrels, although there are those who claim they hybridise
in order to produce a more beautifully coloured specimen. Sighting few
such instances, I tend to disagree. How can one expect to produce a
more striking beauty by crossing a Hyacinthine Macaw or a Sun Conure
to anything else?!
Furthermore, some aviculturists claim to be hybridising in order to
produce a facsimile of an extant species, e.g., breeding large specimens
of Orange-winged Amazons to Greater Antillean Amazons in the hope
of duplicating the extant St. Vincent Amazon, endemic to the island
of St. Vincent in the Lesser Antilles. To say the least, this idea is ludi-
crous, how can man duplicate a creature that has evolved over many thous-
ands of years?
It would appear, aviculturally speaking, that more time and effort
should be spent on establishing psittacine species - since less than 20%
of the entire family has captive self-sustaining numbers. We cannot
afford ourselves the luxury of housing rare species collectively merely
for the self-satisfaction of being recognised as the "first breeder" of a
particular species. What sense of accomplishment can a person feel in being
the first and only to have bred a certain rare species, if they themselves

are alone in owning this species because of avariciously procuring all
available specimens? Surely years of spent time and effort could be saved
if we work together towards our goal of avian preservation and worry less
about self-recognition? We need to prove to everyone that avicultural
study must persist in order to assure the prevention of further avian ex-
tinction.
The subject of hybridisation brings me to my main theme which I
refer to as "Simulation Hybridisation", although actually it is not hybridi-
sation per se. But the product is similar, and in many cases more striking
in appearance than true hybridisation, hence the term. In essence, simula-
tion hybridisation is the bleaching of innate feather pigments to create
artificial feather pigments in order to simulate a desirable hybrid or a
so-called "mutant". Examples come in all sizes, from parrotlets to macaws.
Simulation hybridisation is most often executed by using varying
strengths of a hydrogen peroxide (^C^) solution in order to obtain the
desired pigment. Frequently it is used to bleach green pigments to yellow,
however, any shade lighter than the original can be attained. The results
can be so impressive that even a fairly experienced aviculturist can be
deceived if not previously acquainted with this bleaching practice. Although
simulation hybridisation is employed on all types of psittacines, the fore-
most victims are the smaller ones. By bleaching the head feather pigment
from green to yellow, a Petz's or Mexican Green Conure can be made to
simulate a small version of a Mexican Double Yellow-headed Amazon
(disregarding the tail). So specious is this practice that some of the Petz's
Conures I have seen are reminiscent of the extinct Carolina Parrakeet,
once native to eastern USA. The former example is, of course, directed
towards the commonly ignorant, impulsive bird buyer who sees a chance
to purchase a most desirable baby Amazon at a seemingly low price.
There are also examples which can be mistaken as true hybrids. A hybrid
Double Yellow-headed Amazon can be simulated by bleaching the head
feathers on a Finsch's or Green-cheeked Amazon from green to yellow.
With imagination one can dream up endless combinations.
Usually bleaching does not cause detrimental results if performed
properly (the bleached area is replaced by original pigment during sub-
sequent moult). However, if the solution is too concentrated, blind-
ness and even shock may ensue, eventually leading to local paralysis or
death. Being familiar with the slight stinging effect that a 3% ^2^2 anti &amp;apos;
septic solution can give, one can well imagine what a more concentrated

solution can cause. From an ornithological aspect, simulation hybridisa-
tion can also present a problem. Imagine a new species or mutation being
described, when in reality it is merely a feral population of escaped simu-
lation hybrids. This might seem incredible, but it could happen and cause
considerable embarrassment to the unfortunate ornithologist.
Simulation hybridisation, via bleaching, is practised almost exclusively
in Latin America, whereas dyeing is the preferred method in other parts of
the world, particularly Asia. Dyed finches are still a fairly common sight in
bird consignments to U.S. quarantine stations. Strangely enough, even
though there are a greater number of simulation hybridisers who use
bleaching, it is rare that a bleached simulation hybrid is encountered in a
bird consignment from Latin America. The main channels of introduction
of these simulation hybrids to the USA are via smuggling and pet bird
imports.
The origin of this practice probably arose soon after it was discovered
that pigments could be bleached by employing certain chemical solutions.
Where it originated is more difficult to pinpoint, although I strongly
believe that it was Mexico or Central America, since this region supports
the majority of practitioners and is the most lucrative location. Having
visited many Latin American bird markets, never has there been an ab-
sence of a simulation hybrid, be it parrotlet, conure, Amazon parrot or
macaw.
Being an aviculturist myself, I view the practice of simulation hybridi-
sation as pure vanity, and I am wholeheartedly opposed to it. But where a
demand is made (for hybrids, that is) consequently a supply will meet that
demand. Perhaps if an increased demand is made for rare, endangered and
hard to capture species, a good, healthy supply will result. I feel that bird
traffic is best kept at a reasonable minimum and that it is not so much the
quantity of birds in a collection that is important as what is accomplished
with them. As I said before, avian preservation is a goal which can only be
realised by avicultural co-operation , not by avicultural isolation.

Lamprocolius splendidus splendidus
By R.C.J. SAWYER (Cobham, Surrey)
It is almost twenty years since I saw for the first time living specimens
of the Splendid Starling. They formed part of a magnificent collection
of African birds brought to this country from Kenya by the late David
Roberts. I obtained a single pair which remained in my collection until
recently.
The outstandingly beautiful Splendid is the largest and one of the
finest species of the short-tailed Glossy Starlings. The male has the fore-
head, lores, wing coverts and flight feathers black. Most of the upper parts
are metallic blue with an iridescent green wash. The under parts, from the
chin to the belly, are metallic violet merging into copper and the sides of
the chest, the lower belly and the under tail coverts are metallic blue. The
female lacks some of the violet and tarnished copper of the male. The
species has been imported rarely and my pair were probably among the
first to reach this country alive. However, a few more birds were sent over
subsequently by Mr. and Mrs. T. Barnley. Presumably these have all come
from Kenya but the species is widely distributed and occurs from Nigeria
to Ethiopia and in Uganda, Kenya, Tanzania, Zambia and Angola.
The pair were housed in a small aviary at my home in London until
1972 when I moved to Cobham. They were then transferred to an enclo-
sure, 24 ft. x 12 ft. x 8 ft. high, consisting of a flight liberally planted with
conifers, rhododendrons, ericas, etc., and an artificially heated shelter,

which they shared with a few other birds, including a Cock of the^Rock.
Here the characteristic swishing noise produced by their wings in flight
was obvious. Not only did they indulge in a variety of calls and whistles
but they also exhibited a remarkable ability to mimic the human voice and
persistently called me in- the voice of my father!
The birds were adult when imported and I thought that they were
probably too old to breed but in 1976 they nested for the first time. They
chose a natural log, with an entrance hole 4 inches in diameter, which had
been placed horizontally high in the aviary flight. I never saw them enter
the log but I thought that they were nesting when they became aggres-
sive to other birds (particularly the Cock of the Rock) when they
approached the log. Their behaviour prompted me to examine the log
when I found that they had made a crude nest of grasses, bits of heather
and feathers. The nest contained three eggs which were blue with brown
markings. Since the hen came off the nest when anyone was in the vicinity
of the aviary, it was difficult to determine the incubation period with
certainty but it appears to be about 18 days. Three chicks left the first
nest 18 days after hatching. They were dull editions of the parents but
their plumage already showed some iridescence. The breeding performance
was repeated during the following year when four chicks were reared from
two nests and in a third year when another three youngsters were reared.
Unfortunately all except one of the young birds were males. Their sex is
evident as soon as they leave the nest for, although young cocks are
duller editions of the parents, young hens have blackish brown under
parts with no blue gloss.
Like most Glossy Starlings they are not difficult to keep in captivity.
Their diet consists of a proprietary insectile mixture to which is added
hard boiled egg, minced ox heart and "Vionate". They also eat most
insects and readily take crickets, mealworms and grasshoppers. However,
mine have never been keen on gentles which, in any case, I have stopped
feeding to my birds because of the danger of botulism. When they were
feeding their offspring the parents were provided with live food every few
hours. They were shy in their behaviour when they were breeding and
were always reluctant to take the food to the chicks in the nest box until
I had left the aviary and was apparently out of sight. They were aggressive
when nesting and killed one of the young birds of the previous year which
had not been removed from their aviary after reaching independence.
I thought the opportunity of breeding the Splendid Starling had gone
for ever when the adult pair, which must have been at least 17 years old,
were stolen. However, I still have three young males, one of which I have

arrays d to exchange for one of the females which my friend, Dr. K.C.
Searle of Hong Kong, obtained from Kenya and so I hope that the enjoy-
ment of raising this lovely species will continue.
As described above, the Splendid Starling Lamprocolius splendidus
splendidus has been bred by Mr. R.C.J. Sawyer. This is believed to be the
first success in this country, but anyone knowing of a previous breeding
in Great Britain or Northern Ireland, or any other reason that would dis-
qualify the claim, is asked to inform the Hon. Secretary.

Onycognathus morio
By J.J. MARE (Roodepoort, Republic of South Africa)
The Red-winged Starling is an attractive, indigenous species in South
Africa. Many fanciers claim to have bred them, but to my knowledge no
account of a specific breeding has yet been published.
My birds were acquired in 1979 and no attempt at breeding occurred
until 1981 when the hen began to disappear for long periods. By watching
carefully I discovered that she was visiting a sisal stump, which was origi-
nally hollowed out by Meyer's Parrots. The exterior dimensions of the
stump are 0.91 m long and 0.3 m approximately in diameter at the widest
part. It is placed under roofing on a ledge about 2.1 m above the ground
and is in semi-darkness. The aviary is 7.3 m. square and houses a mixed
collection of birds including barbets, weavers, ducks, pheasants, Glossy
and Pied Starlings, Meyer's Parrots and Peach-faced Lovebirds.
By carefully listening on the 13th day after the hen had first disap-
peared into the sisal stump, I heard the presence of young, and a nest
inspection on the 20th day revealed two chicks and a pale greenish-blue
egg spotted with irregular brown markings, which proved to be infertile.
The cup-shaped nest had been built approximately halfway down the
stump with sticks and grass plastered together with mud and lined with

J.J. MARE - BREEDING THE RED-WINGED STARLING
coir and feathers.
During the breeding period the cock bird was never seen to be in the
nest; therefore it is presumed that incubation was entirely by the hen,
with the cock just keeping guard. Since these birds are inclined to be ner-
vous and became quite aggressive and dived at one's head whenever their
nest was approached, inspection of the nest was kept to a minimum.
At 21 days old the chicks were seen sitting in the entrance of the nest
waiting for food, and at 25 days they were seen perched on the top of
the sisal stump, but they soon hid behind it on the ledge. The young
birds were practically fully grown at this stage and were a dull black in
colour with no indication of their sex. The adult male is predominantly
an iridescent black bird with reddish brown flight feathers, while the
female has a grey head, somewhat streaked with a darker shade.
Food consisted of termites (preferred at the flying stage), fruit such as
pawpaw, pear, banana, apple, grapes, sultanas, etc., unbaked peanuts, dog
meal dampened with water, vast quantities of mealworms and every cater-
pillar, millipede, earthworm, cricket, locust or beetle that could be found.
A nectar mixture made of honey, brown sugar, a multi-vitamin syrup and
water was given fresh every day. A light was left burning for about an hour
after dark to attract insects. Not only did the Red-winged Starlings enjoy
this experiment, but so did all the birds in this and the adjoining aviary.

Although various ramphastids are frequently seen in collections in
Britain, this is believed to be the first complete breeding success in the
British Isles with any member of this interesting South American family,
though species have reared in Europe and fairly often in America. There is,
however, a record of London Zoo almost breeding the Spot-billed Tou-
canet Selenidera maculirostris as long ago as 1913 but the chicks from at
least two nests failed to survive. In recent years, the Pale-mandibled Ara-
cari Pteroglossus erythropygius , Curl-crested Aracari P. beauharnaesii,
Laminated Hill Toucan Andigena laminirostris and Toco Toucan Ramphas-
tos toco have been reported as laying but, to the best of our knowledge,
none has hatched.
This species, also known as the Chestnut-billed Toucanet, is widely
distributed in north-western South America from the Perija Mountains of
Venezuela, through Colombia to the subtropical zones of Ecuador.
Measuring 15 inches it is the largest of the toucanets. The most distinc-
tive characteristics are the blood red rump and the chestnut beak which has
a broad white stripe at the base. The body is mostly grass green, diffused
with blue across the breast, more so in the male than in the female. The
tips of the tail feathers are chestnut. The beak is about four inches long
and slightly longer in the male. Other differences between the sexes are the
overall larger size of the male and the difference in pitch of their calls, the
male's being louder and deeper while the hen's is more plaintive. The call
is an oft repeated throaty croak which the male utters for long periods
during the breeding season, the female to a much lesser extent. Some
duettingtakes place.
In March 1980 two males and one female were obtained. Two were
already paired and these were placed together in a small hospital flight.
The third was caged separately and they were all kept inside for a short
period of observation. Food consumption was good and, having shown no
signs of distress after their journey, the pair was released into an outside
aviary.
The flight was a corner one with Cornish stone walls on two sides and
measured 4 m x 3.5 m with a height sloping from 3m to 2.5 m. The roof
is half covered lengthways with corrugated perspex. The enclosure has part

earth, part grass floor with Soft-shield Fern Polystichum setiferum grow-
ing along one wall. A large Himalayan Honeysuckle Leycesteria formosa
dominates the centre and a smaller one grows against the back wall.
Common Ivy Hedera helix and Pennywort Umbilicus rupestris cover the
walls. The leaves from the latter are occasionally eaten.
In June a hollowed-out log, 1 m long,was placed in the angle of the
stone walls, 1.5 m from the ground. Two-thirds were filled with a mixture
of wood chips and forest bark. Growing alongside the entrance hole was a
small Sycamore tree Acer pseudoplatanus, the branches of which allowed
the adults to perch before going into the nest. The male, which was in
breeding condition, inspected the log immediately but apart from this and
some interest again shown by him in 1981, it was not until May 1982 that
the hen started to take an interest in either the log or the male.
During 1981 the male frequently called for long periods but the hen
was still rather observed around the 23rd and always
was still rather ragged in appearance and tended to sulk for most of the
time. Twice last year (16th February and 10th April) his frustration boiled
over and he pursued the female relentlessly, necessitating his removal for
several days on each occasion.
The diet given to the pair consisted of half a bowl of chopped apple, a
quarter of a bowl of insectile mixture and a quarter of a bowl of mixed
soft fruits (tomatoes, bananas, oranges, soaked sultanas, etc.). Mealworms
and blow-fly maggots were sometimes offered but they were never eaten.
During January two nest cavities were made in the rear aviary wall, as
possible alternatives to the log, and filled again with the wood chip and
forest bark mixture. Subsequently these were ignored and when both came
into condition in May following the very hot spring, much time was spent
in the natural log, throwing out the forest bark and wood chips.
Mating was first witnessed on 4th June on a rotting branch alongside
the pond. The male was seen tapping at the base of the hen's bill until she
adopted the mating position, which was squatting low across the log, head
pointing towards the ground and held very rigid. The tail was held out
straight and quivered when mating was about to take place. On the 5th
and 6th the hen was busy in and out of the log, chipping at the inside from
early morning to early evening. Chips of wood removed from the chamber
were deposited at the furthest possible point from the nest. The weather in
mid-June was not very good and only the occasional attempt at mating
was seen, the majority being around midday. Mating was increasingly
observed around the 23rd and always took place on the log at the side of

the pond.
The female started spending more time in the log and was suspected
of having laid when a quick check was made of the log on the 27th. Two
eggs were present and a third was laid next day.
The pair shared incubation which started with the first egg; the male
spent shorter periods on the eggs than the hen, probably because he had to
come off to feed whereas the hen was fed on the nest by the male. The
female incubated at night. Incubation lasted 16 or 17 days and young
were first heard on 13th July when faint squawks were audible, presum-
ably made as they were being fed. No eggshells were found.
A varied diet was given when young were due, and most of the items
offered were fed to the young. The basic fruit mixture comprised apple,
seedless grapes and tomatoes, finely chopped, which was given daily. A
selection of other soft fruits were given daily but what was offered depen-
ded on what was available - soaked raisins and sultanas, cherries, plums,
peaches, oranges, bananas, pears, blackberries, black currants, strawberries
and nectarines. Cooked carrots and rice, cucumber and courgette were also
given. All items were finely chopped. Livefood was offered but little was
taken. Maggots were ignored completely and only a slight interest was
shown in mealworms and crickets. Grasshoppers were taken in limited
numbers but generally insects did not form an important part of the
rearing diet and could have been dispensed with.
On the third day the hen was seen eating a very large garden slug,
tearing it apart and swallowing it to feed to the chicks. After feeding she
spent the next five minutes cleaning the slime from her beak. Later in the
day we offered her a snail which was eagerly accepted. This was taken to
a particular perch and shelled, the first of many. The mollusc was worked
in her beak until a weak spot was found, then crushed until bits of the
shell started to fall off. It was then rubbed against the perch until clear
of any shell fragments. If small, it was swallowed whole but normally it
was placed under the foot and ripped into several pieces. The male also
placed it under the foot to remove shell but found it awkward because of
his extra bill length.
Thereafter, snails formed a large proportion of the diet fed to the
young with a dozen or so given daily to start with but, as the chicks grew,
this was increased to between two and three dozen a day, divided between
two feeds, one early morning and the other in the late afternoon.
The male would spend time picking the ripening berries from Leyces-
teria, often balancing precariously on the outer stems to reach the caramel-
scented berries. These were also picked from other bushes around the gar-

dens and provided as an additional item to the diet.
All progressed well for three weeks with both sexes taking their share
in rearing duties. Then the male pursued the female relentlessly and,ah
though in a lull in the chasing the female would fly to the feed bowl and
try to take the food up, as she approached the nest, the male would con-
tinue his aggression. Consequently he was removed to an outside holding
cage out of sight of the hen. During the course of the period when he was
aggressive, he made the occasional visit to the two wall cavities, indicating
that he may have been showing an interest in nesting again.
We had reservations as to whether the hen would rear alone but our
worries were unfounded for she proved to be a very industrious mother in
caring for her unknown number of young. She continued to feed a large
number of snails and an increasing amount of soaked puppy meal, as well
as quantities of fruit.
Droppings were removed to the furthest point from the nest and, being
of a fairly runny consistency, they mixed easily with the wood chips to
facilitate easy removal. The hen continued to chip at the inside of the log
thus helping to add to the absorbent nest material and keep the nest dry.
When the nest was checked after fledging, there was only an inch or so of
nesting material left but it was reasonably dry and not at all sour as may
have been expected. We feel that the provision of a nesting receptacle,
such as a log, is most important for species like this, otherwise the base
medium of wood chips, etc., would have soon been taken out and the
chamber would have become very dirty quickly as happens with some
lories and lorikeets.
When six weeks old, young were seen at the entrance hole for the first
time and it was quickly ascertained that there were two young which
confirmed our thoughts from listening to the chicks in the nest. The
female would feed the chicks at the entrance while clinging to the side,
occasionally reaching down inside to feed one that had gone back in. To
take food up she would eat three or four pieces of fruit then fly up with a
piece in her beak. This she would feed^then regurgitate the other pieces,
one at a time.
From the point of the young's first appearance at the nest entrance,
the consumption of snails dropped appreciably and stopped once they had
left. An increasing amount of soaked puppy meal and apple was now being
fed.
The first young left the log on 26th August and was smaller than the
second which left the following day. Both were extremely steady and
resembled the hen in plumage with the exception of the white stripe on

the bill. The tails were short but still capable of being held erect while
roosting.
Both had gained confidence within a couple of days and began to
follow the hen, begging for food.They began picking at food within a week
of leaving the nest but were still fed by the hen for some time. Both were
virtually independent of the hen for food at about nine weeks.
The tail growth was rapid and the white band at the base of the bill
began to show on the bottom mandible at nine weeks and is now (early
October) fully showing on both mandibles. Apart from the bluish hue
on the chest, they are indistinguishable from the adults.
Both are full of life and very mischievous, taking great delight in
pestering the hen,pulling at her tail and trying to bite her feet. Both love
a spray and when bathing from the pond, all three stand on the side and
take it in turn to have a dip.
What little sun we had in the early days after they left the nest was
greatly appreciated and both were sunbathing the day after leaving the
nest - this they do by leaning to one side and erecting the feathers of

Both young are still with the hen; the male is still separated and will

As described above, the Crimson-rumped Toucanet Aulacorhynchus

to be the first success in this country. Anyone knowing of a previous

By Dr. M.A. SCHLEE (Museum of Natural History, Paris, France)
This paper reports the outcome of the second breeding season of the
Blackbird in captivity, an account of the first season (1980) having been
published previously in th e AviculturalMagazine. Differences in behaviour
between the reproductive seasons will be emphasised and the conditions
necessary for assuring successful breeding will be discussed.
Case 1: The established nesting pair
This pair comprised a five-year-old, hand-reared male and a two-year-
old female which had successfully reproduced in captivity during the
summer of 1980. The birds were living in the same greenhouse aviary as
last year (Schlee, 1981). Two nesting attempts were carried out, but only
the second one was successful.
First nesting attempt
On 11th May 1981, the male Blackbird adopted the "pear-shaped"
courtship posture, inspected the nest site (the same as last year) and inclu-
ded elements of the "strangled" song in his vocalisations. The female built
the nest on 14th and 15th May. Only two eggs were laid, the clutch being

inferior to last year's even though it was laid nearly a month earlier. The
first egg hatched on 31st May, the second egg two days later. The female
remained on the nest most of the day of the second hatching and was fed
by her mate. In addition to last year's diet of earthworms, coleopterans,
lepidopterans and dictyopterans, about 40 Stick Insects Cuniculina impi-
gra were made available on the third and fourth day after hatching. How-
ever, both nestlings died within the three days that followed. It is quite
probable that their death was brought about by the ingestion of the Stick
Insects; nevertheless, a small number of these insects had occasionally
been fed to the parents without causing any bad side effects.
This year the male bird did not stand guard over the nest, but any
attempt to approach it provoked an aggressive display. Whenever I tried
to touch the nest, the male immediately dived at my head; maybe he
remembered that last year I had caused the disturbance that terminated
in the disappearance of his offspring. This behaviour was observed during
both nesting attempts.
Second nesting attempt
Numerous aggressive encounters and some serious fighting took place
between the pair during the three days that separated the nesting periods.
Then, on 10th June, the female relined her old nest and four days later
started brooding. The clutch contained three eggs which hatched on 27th,
28th and 30th June respectively. The diet of the nestlings had the same
components as last year, but some 20 Silkworm moths Bombyx mori were
also supplied. The parents showed a clear preference for these lepidopterans
which were fed intact to the young. The total number of prey consumed
was inferior to that of last year, for the parents continued to eat com-
mercial feed, but the offspring were not fed the pellets until 22-23 days
old.
The first young bird left the nest on 10th July at the age of 13 days;
the other two by early morning on 12th July. I was able to feed the first
and third fledglings during their first three days out of the nest. The male
bird threatened me when I first approached but thereafter remained near-
by and surveyed. However, when I tried to feed the second fledgling, the
mother immediately perched on an overhead branch, stared at me and
gave piercing alarm calls. No. 2 then looked at me, gave alarm calls and
took flight. During this time the father gave the warning "pook pook"
call, which indicates to the young that they should keep still and quiet,
and clearly searched for the cause of the disturbance which he did not
associate with my presence. Neither the second nor the third fledgling

paid attention to their mother's alarm calls, but stayed quiet, as indica-
ted by their father. After this incident, I could never approach the second
fledgling without arousing the mother's defensive behaviour and causing
the immediate flight of the youngster. On 12th July it was evident that
the parents had divided the offspring between them: the first and third
fledglings were cared for by their father in the front half of the aviary,
the second fledgling by its mother in the back half. However, their organi-
sation of fledgling care broke down when the young birds started freely
moving about in the aviary a few days later, and the parents started to
feed their offspring indiscriminately. At that time the first and third
fledglings began reacting to their mother's alarm calls. The young were
independent by 3rd August and the mother no longer defended them.
The sex of the young birds became evident after the moult in September -
the first and third were males, the second a female.
The young Blackbirds had to be treated for gapeworms, but since
they were too wild to be repeatedly boxed or caged without seriously
injuring themselves, an initial treatment by inhalation of barium anti-
monyl tartrate powder was followed up by the administration of thia-
bendazole in the drinking water for 7-10 days.
Case 2: First-year pair
An abortive nesting attempt was carried out by the young male born
in captivity during the summer of 1980 and a year-old, hand-reared
female which was found in the suburbs of Paris at the age of seven days.
These two birds, as well as last year's captive-born female and a Starling,
were all reared and housed together until 10th April 1981, when the
captive-born female was killed and the Starling removed from the cage
(1 x .82 x 1.53 m). No agonistic behaviour was observed between the
pair, and they were often perched close to one another. This gave the
impression that pair-formation had occurred.
Nest-construction
On 22nd April, since the female was seen carrying pieces of wet paper
in her beak, I attached a commercial pigeon nest in the upper corner of the
cage. Sporadic gathering of nest material (straw and strips of paper) was
observed until the middle of the following month. During that time two
additional aviaries were constructed in the greenhouse: one (3 x 1.5 x 4 m)
was built around the birds' cage in order to facilitate releasing the pair. On
18th May the nest was full of straw and the female was settled in it. I left

the cage door open to allow the birds access into the aviary. That after-
noon I found one broken egg on the floor and both birds were highly agi-
tated. On 19th May the female left the cage, and the next day the male
ventured out. Both birds showed intense agonistic behaviour towards each
other; this continued until 26th May when the female resumed nest-
building. On 29th May the nest was lined with mud, transported in part by
the male, and the next morning it appeared to be finished. On 1st June the
female became the dominant partner.
Behaviour during incubation
Four eggs were laid between 3rd and 7th June. On 9th June, the Star-
ling which lived in the adjoining aviary slipped through a hole into the
territory of the established pair. Up until that time, the year-old male regu-
larly threatened and fought with the Starling along the boundary of his
territory. But once his rival had gone, he became extremely aggressive with

his mate, chasing her off the nest and out of the cage, and then barring
access to the feeding dish. His aggressiveness did not diminish when the
Starling was returned to its own aviary a few days later. The year-old male
was seen standing guard over the nest only at the end of the incubation
period.
Hatching and care of offspring
The first egg hatched on 19th June. There was considerable agonistic
behaviour between the parents and, as a result, the feeding routine, as
well as the preparation of the food, was not properly carried out. The
male often did not allow the female to go to the nest. On 21st June, two
dead nestlings were found on the floor. The younger one had apparently
died at hatching, but the elder one showed severe haematomae on the
head and neck. It may have been killed as a result of a disturbance in the
greenhouse which may have prompted the male bird to jump against and
into the nest - a behaviour he had already shown on several occasions
but which was never observed in the female. A check revealed the pres-
ence of another young bird and one egg in the nest. Aggressive behaviour
continued between the parents and on 24th June I found the body of the
third nestling which showed signs of massive cerebral haemorrhage. The
remaining egg was infertile.
Behaviour following nesting failure
On 25th June I removed the nest from the cage, and four days later
the birds showed signs of moulting. Their mutual aggressiveness declined
at that time but did not disappear. The male was clearly the dominant
partner. On 19th September the metal cage in which they had nested
was removed from the aviary, after which the birds became noticeably
more calm. In the middle of December the female slipped into the adjoin-
ing aviary with the Starling. Both of the Blackbirds were visibly more at
ease when separated. The female re-entered her own aviary for the third
time on 27th January 1982. Agonistic encounters occurred as usual, but
in addition, the male showed a curious "stalking" attitude in which he
did not seem to pay attention to the female's submissive postures. That
evening he killed the female.
Conclusions
In order to breed Blackbirds successfully, the physical environment has
to be arranged in such a way as to allow for the expression of the strong
territorial and aggressive tendencies that characterise this species. In

nature, the size of the territory depends above all on feeding conditions
and the amount of cover, the densest populations of Blackbirds being
found in urban parks and gardens. A territory in the Oxford Botanical
Gardens, for example, averages about half an acre (Snow, 1958), in an
urban park in Lausanne, Switzerland, about one-third of an acre (Ribaut,
1964). The pair that successfully nested in captivity had a ground surface
of 15 square metres and special accommodations had to be made to prevent
aggressive encounters as follows: 1) enough ground cover so that the male
and the female were not always in sight of one another when carrying out
general maintenance activities; 2) enough space around the nest-site so that
the parents did not have to cross each other's path when transporting food
to the young; 3) food items distributed in at least two different places so
that separate foraging sites were available.
Aggressive tendencies also have to be taken into account when mem-
bers of the same family are kept together over a period of time. Although
the parents generally tolerated their grown offspring in their territory,
from October onward the agonistic behaviour between the young became
quite intense and often gave way to violent fighting. The young female was
most often attacked and several times had been pinned to the ground in
prolonged combats. The plant cover in the aviary, however, was sufficient
to allow her to escape without being seriously injured. I first removed the
dominant male (the first fledgling) and then I was obliged to separate the
other two young birds. It was only then that violent fighting broke out
between the two females, for the young one tried to take possession of her
mother's territory. I do not know if these examples of behaviour are
typical, but they should be taken into consideration when breeding the
Blackbird in captivity where physical conditions do not always allow for
the normal dispersal of the young to new territories.
There are surely many reasons for the nesting failure of the year-old
pair, but these can probably be grouped into two main categories - inade-
quate accommodation and general incompatibility of the pair. The aviary
had only 4.5 square metres of ground surface available and this was even
more restricted by the presence of the large metal cage. It should be noted,
however, that the nest site was the pair's choice, for other sites, and even a
pigeon nest, were available. The limited amount of space and plant cover
surely kept both birds in a state of constant nervous tension, the frequency
of reciprocal interruption of maintenance activities being quite high. When
there is no way to escape or to increase social distance, crowding or proxi-
mity stress (Fox, 1974) is created and often results in hyperaggression.
Parental behaviour was further disrupted by the fact that there was only

one small entrance (39 x 48 cm) to the cage, thus obliging the birds to
come face to face when carrying food. This always seemed to be inter-
preted, at least by the male, as direct aggression. In addition, or perhaps
as a result of constant stress, the pair-bond did not seem to be firmly es-
tablished. In nature the female becomes the dominant partner after pair-
formation occurs, and in old pairs she remains slightly dominant over the
male but with little aggressiveness on either side (Snow, 1958). This
clearly was not the case for the yearling pair whose reproductive activities
may have been brought about solely by the forced cohabitation. If the
pair-bond is non-existent or poorly established, the "partner" would become
an intruder in the territory and thus release aggressive behaviour (which
in turn inhibits the expression of parental behaviour). The actual reasons
for the apparent lack of a pair-bond are unknown, but some social factors
were probably involved. The aviary of the Blackbirds was separated from
that of the Starling by a nylon protecting net, and all three birds constant-
ly remained near the boundary. The male Blackbird carried out territorial
defence while the female spent much time watching the Starling which
directed courtship displays to her; but she was never observed soliciting
him. The complex social relations brought about by the continual presence
of the Starling, with whom the Blackbirds had been reared, may well
have hindered pair-formation.

By ROBERT J. BERRY (Curator of Birds)
and WILLIAM W. TODD (Supervisor of Outdoor Exhibits)
Touracos (family Musophagidae) are an interesting and spectacular
group of softbill birds which range over scattered portions of the African
continent. These pigeon-sized relatives of the cuckoo are also commonly
known as Go-away Birds, Plantain-eaters, or Louries. They are extremely
popular as avicultural subjects due to the relative ease of their captive
maintenance, the brilliant coloration exhibited by many species, and their
active behaviour. Undoubtedly, no one with a basic interest in softbills
would fail to be familiar with these appealing birds.
A review of the literature indicates that there is some disagreement over
their true taxonomic status. Traditionally they have been listed in the
order Cuculiformes. More recently, however, they are placed in a sepa-
rate order - the Musophagiformes. Depending on the reference, five or six
genera are generally recognised and these are divided into 19 or 20 species.
Morony et al (1975) lists five genera representing 19 species. Readers who
are interested in problems of relationships, distributions and descriptions
of the birds are referred to published material by Moreau (1958) and
Chaplin (1963).
While a number of species have apparently been bred successfully in
European collections, there are few published accounts of their success-
ful reproduction in the United States. The fact that the majority of the
reported breeding successes occurred in relatively large, heavily planted
aviaries may have led many aviculturists to believe that they could not be
easily bred in lesser facilities. This is not true.
Even though our initial breeding success with this group at the Houston
Zoo did, in fact, occur in a large indoor conservatory aviary measuring
80 ft. long, 50 ft. wide and 20 ft. high, our most successful production
has occurred in a range of relatively small outdoor exhibits. Each of these
units measures IVi ft. wide and 15 ft. deep with a 7 ft, height in the open
flight and a 10 ft. height in the covered shelter. Of the 11 species currently
maintained in the collection and housed as individual pairs in these facili-
ties, nine have been successfully bred: Lady Ross's Musophaga rossae,
Hartlaub's Tauraco hartlaubi, White-crested T. leucolophus , Guinea or
Gold Coast T. persa , Schalow's T schalowi , Violet-crested T. porphy-
reolophus. Red-crested T. erythrolophus , White-cheeked T. leucotis ,

and Grey Corythaixoides concolor. The two remaining species, the
Violaceous Plantain-eater Musophaga violacea and the White-bellied Go-
away Bird Corythaixoides leucogaster have only been paired in the collec-
tion within the last year and we remain hopeful that these two species will
also respond to our husbandry techniques. Since the inception of our
breeding programme for musophagids in 1977, a total of 132 chicks have
been reared to independence (19 May 1982). We are, of course, extremely
gratified by this initial success. Our long-range goal is to establish three
unrelated breeding pairs of each species maintained in the programme in
order to achieve a degree of genetic diversity in future generations. This is
imperative if we are to make a significant contribution to establishing
these birds as self-sustaining captive populations. In this direction we now
have several pairs of F j birds paired and breeding.
In order to assist others interested in working with the captive propaga-
tion of these birds, we provide the following information on the data we
have obtained to date and the husbandry techniques we have developed in
the project.
Actually, our basic husbandry programme is quite simple and, as indica-
ted earlier, our facilities for housing these birds are modest and certainly
no more sophisticated than the average "backyard" aviary. Indeed, the
units currently housing the touraco collection were originally built in the
1930's as a pheasantry and, as such, offer little more for their inhabitants
than an outdoor aviary with a sheltered section into which the birds can
retreat during inclement weather. To enhance the appearance of the
exhibits, the earthen bottoms are covered with several inches of fine
gravel and each unit is planted with a couple of shrubs.
Due to the extremely territorial behaviour of adult pairs in breeding
condition, we do not recommend attempting to breed touracos in colonies.
We feel that the major factor contributing to our success was the segrega-
tion of specimens into individual pairs. Accurately sexing touracos can
present some problems, since the vast majority of species are not dimor-
phic (only one of the species we maintain, the White-bellied Go-away Bird,
is obviously dimorphic-black mandibles in the male and green in the fe-
male). For making tentative determinations of sex in monomorphic species
we rely on behavioural interactions and pairing in group situations. By
banding, or otherwise identifying individuals in a group, the selection of
true pairs is relatively easy. There are, however, always odd individuals
which remain a question. For this reason, laparoscopy (surgical exposure
of the gonads) has proved a very valuable tool. In the hands of a skilled
clinician, the surgical risks are minimal, and the procedure is quick and

conclusive. As touracos reach sexual maturity during their first year, all
of our juvenile specimens are now sexed by this method at between six
to eight months old. The earliest we have had eggs produced was from a
nine-month old Red-crested Touraco 71 erythrolophus . In contrast, it is
also interesting to note that our breeding female Lady Ross&amp;apos;s Touraco, on
loan from San Diego Zoo, is known to be over 20 years old.
The majority of our pairs appear to nest almost randomly throughout
the year with peak breeding activity occurring from December through
July. Both adults share in the incubation process. With the exception of
the members of the genus Coiythabc aides , which usually lay three eggs,
the normal clutch is two eggs for the species which have bred. Our records
indicate that incubation for the genus Tauraco generally lasts 22 days; for
Corythabcoides 26 days; and for Musophaga 24 days. The young are quite
advanced, being covered in a dense coat of sooty black or grey down when
they hatch, and are fed by regurgitation. Observations indicate that the
first feeds are in a liquid state with the consistency increasing in coarse-
ness with the chick&amp;apos;s age. The young develop rapidly and, surprisingly,
leave the nest before they are fully fledged. During this critical period,
they are closely tended by the adults as they clamber about in branches
near the nest. At this age, except for the vivid red wing bars across the
flight feathers in Tauraco , their sombre juvenile plumage gives little hint
of the dazzling adult coloration that is gradually acquired during their
first few months of life. Although some pairs will tolerate relatively close
observation during the incubation and rearing cycle, this practice is
generally discouraged especially with less prolific species. Aggression
between members of a pair, often sudden and unpredictable, is the
greatest threat to continual successful breeding. Unnoticed in a confined
space with minimal cover, it will inevitably result in the death of one
member of the pair, usually that of the female. While agonistic beha-
viour may occur in pairs of long standing and with a successful breeding
history, it is more likely encountered between recently introduced birds.
Gradual acquaintance, beginning with separate adjacent caging to monitor
signs of compatibility, such as courtship feeding, will help to decrease but
cannot eliminate this danger.
Due to limited space it is necessary to house pairs of touracos in
adjacent flights. The housing of pairs of conspecifics next to one another
is avoided, and although some interspecific fighting occurs through the
wire, it is rarely serious and does not appear to inhibit reproductive beha-
viour. On the contrary, continuous breeding of individual pairs may be
enhanced by the close proximity of other birds in clearly delineated terri-

tories.
Diets are identical for all species in all seasons. Being primarily frugi-
vorous, foods consist of a mixture of freshly diced fruits such as apple,
banana and papaya, as well as whole grapes, chopped greens and soaked
raisins. These items are sprinkled twice weekly with a vitamin/mineral
supplement. Soaked Purina dog chow, dry mynah pellets and game bird
crumbs are also provided. Non-breeding birds are fed once daily. When
young are being reared, a second feeding is offered and a few mealworms
and small pieces of Zupreem Bird-of-Prey Diet are added to their regular
ration.
Nest-building in touracos is reminiscent of pigeons and doves as they
devote little effort or detail to nest construction. For this reason we pro-
vide them with a sturdy nesting platform. After experimenting with
several types of nesting structures, we have found that there are definite
advantages in using shallow wooden trays which have at least 3 inch lips
on the sides. This type of structure helps prevent eggs or young from
falling from the nests and seems to provide the incubating birds with a
sense of security. Standard produce "flats" work quite well for us. These
are lined with hay and mounted in a corner of the shelter approximately
7 ft. above the ground. After adding a few twigs of their own, the birds
seem totally satisfied with this arrangement. To avoid aspergillosis or other
disease problems, the nests are cleaned and new nesting material is added
between clutches.
While a number of female touracos hatched in Houston have produced
eggs in the latter part of their first year, successful breeding does not
usually occur until they are in their second year. Several second-generation
pairs appear to have experienced "trial nesting". In these cases, eggs might
be laid from perches or other inappropriate sites and incubation not be
completed before settling into a normal and successful routine. Eggs re-
trieved from these situations and artificially uncubated or placed with
surrogates have generally proved to be fertile. Once established, most
pairs continue breeding attempts throughout the nesting season, frequently
beginning another nesting before the previous chicks are fully independent.
On several occasions we have observed juveniles from the previous clutch
assisting with brooding and rearing of their younger siblings. Removing the
young once they are independent is usually necessary, however, due to
aggressive behaviour which often develops in the adults once they begin to
recycle.
Because of our relatively mild climate, we are able to house these birds
outside throughout the year. During the winter months, a single infra-red

heat lamp is provided in each shelter. Under these conditions, the adult
birds have proven quite hardy and have endured brief periods of freezing
weather (down to 1 S*F at night) without any apparent ill effects.
As a safety precaution, we have on occasion removed chicks for hand-
rearing during the winter months and have found them very easy. Our
hand-rearing diet consists of: 1 part Purina Cat Chow, 1 part fruit mix
consisting of equal parts of papaya and apple. This is blended to near
liquid consistency for initial feedings and warmed prior to administration.
Although initial feedings are by eyedropper, once the chicks have
become conditioned to handling, they begin to eat readily from a spoon.
By the time they are three to four weeks old, they are usually eating by
themselves.
Whilst they become extremely tame when hand-reared, touracos are
not really suitable as cage birds and can only be fully appreciated in
aviaries that are large enough for flight.
With proper care and attention, there is no reason why these fascina-
ting birds cannot become established as self-sustaining populations in our
aviaries.

OBSERVATIONS ON THE NIGHTINGALE

By MALCOLM TAYLOR (Alresford, Hampshire)
The Nightingale Luscinia megarhynchos is a summer migrant to Europe
and arrives in England during the third week in April.
This bird measures about 6 Vi inches in length. The whole of the upper
part is russet brown, the tail being rich chestnut brown. The chin and
throat are whitish, breast and sides of the body are pale brown. The
under tail coverts are buff and the belly white. The legs and feet are
greyish brown, and the eyes dark brown. Male and female are similar in
appearance. Juveniles have a speckled appearance, very much like young
Robins but with the chestnut brown tail.
I do not consider the Nightingale to be a bird which is easily kept in
confinement, as its needs^to keep it in good health and condition through-
out the year &amp;gt; have to be watched closely, particularly throughout the
winter and during the spring moult.
Nightingales should be fed on a good proprietary brand of fine grade
insectile food. I currently use products from the Orlux range of Belgian
manufactured bird foods, marketed in England by Fromeview Ltd. of
Bristol. I consider this brand to be the best available. To this basic insec-
tile food I add some grated stale cheddar cheese, grated carrot, finely
minced raw ox heart, fruit in the form of ripe apple and pear heavily
scored, a few well-soaked raisins, not forgetting several mealworms per
bird each day, together with ants'eggs, earwigs, woodlice, and any other
form of livefood that can be procured.
I have purposely excluded maggots or 'gentles', as some aviculturists
used to call them, because unless the breeding source is reputable, it is
very likely that one's stock of birds will be almost wiped out due to an
attack of botulism.
One year my own stock suffered such an attack and I vowed never
to feed another maggot to any birds in my care. To substitute maggots
as a useful form of livefood, I use chopped mealworms and "ants eggs"
or larvae of the Wood Ant Formica mfa.
Variety of food is very important in keeping any insectivorous bird
in good condition throughout the year, but I feel that this applies in
particular to the Nightingale.
When spring arrives, it is always a delicate situation to obtain com-
patibility between the male and female, as the bird selected as the
breeding mate would no doubt not be the choice of the male in the

wild. This applies to many insectivorous species, and if the weather is
reasonable I like to place each bird of a pair into a separate aviary during
the third week in April, and generally speaking it is only a matter of a
week, or two before one observes the female carrying a leaf about the
aviary. It Is then usually safe to transfer the male into the same aviary
as the female.
Such an aviary must be well planted with shrubs to form a dense
undergrowth with sufficient light and shade to resemble the wild
breeding habitat. I feel that fund slung an aviary according to the habitat
considerably assists the study of the species in captivity and goes towards
ensuring a successful breeding result, plus the added attraction of caring
for a collection of birds in miniature natural environments. That is why
I believe that a working field knowledge of all species in confinement is
absolutely essential if one hopes to breed from them. Their habits must
be studied at length in the field and where this is impossible, such as
with species from another country, then it becomes essential to scan the
literature for any available information about the species in one's care.
It Is now generally known that any aviary used for breeding birds
should be fairly thickly planted and be provided with two feeding areas
out of sight of each other.
Oak trees are generally within the Nightingale's breeding territory as
it is the caterpillars of the Oak Roller Moth Tortrix viridana which form
the bulk of the food of the nestlings in the wild.
The nest, which is placed on or very close to the ground, is constructed
of dead oak leaves and lined with grasses and a leaf or two.
The usual clutch of eggs is five, although four are not uncommon, and
they are olive brown In colour.
In 27 years' experience I have kept many Nightingales but have only
had one true pair which were compatible, and In an aviary measuring
9 ft. x 6 ft. x 7 ft. high this pair built a nest but did not continue any
further that year.
However, the following year In May they built a nest in some very low
bramble just clear of the ground. This nest was constructed from a large
quantity of oak leaves from leaf litter in their aviary, together with some
grasses which formed the lining and a little-horse hair. The female laid
four olive brown eggs and appeared to have done all the nest building. She
began Incubating after the third egg was laid. I never witnessed any display
taking place. During this time the male bird was singing almost continu-
ously but its song, although very pleasant, was nothing like the song
pattern of wild Nightingales. After 14 days' incubation, three eggs

hatched, the fourth being clear.
The adults were supplied with greater quantities of ants&amp;apos;eggs just prior
to the hatching, and until the three nestlings were 10 days old, they were
fed on nothing else to my knowledge, which says much for the food value
of ants'eggs. From 10 days onwards, I fed mainly ants^eggs and chopped
mealworms and these were dusted with Phillips Yeast mixutre and Squibbs
Vionate to prevent rickets occurring. Each time anyone approached their
aviary, the adult birds would make loud croaking noises of alarm.
The three nestlings grew rapidly and fledged at 12 days when they
hopped about in the undergrowth, more often heard than seen. At 21
days they were not quite so shy and could be observed more easily. By
this time they showed great interest in ants'eggs and mealworms. The ants'
eggs were a great favourite and a good standby until I was able to remove
the three young birds at four weeks to a bird room where they were
housed separately in large flight cages and gradually accustomed to a basi-
cally static diet. It is important that the greater part of their diet should be
static rather than live, as the limited amount of live food which we are able
to give, compared to what the birds can obtain in the wild, does not
supply enough vitamins.
From the time the eggs hatched, the male Nightingale ceased singing as
is customary in the wild, because by that time he has no time to sing,being
too busy feeding the nestlings.
Juvenile Nightingales do not moult their wing or tail feathers until the
next spring, when first winter birds can be distinguished from older birds
by pale buff spots on the tips of the greater wing coverts. At six weeks old
my birds moulted from their speckled plumage and resembled the adults.
At that time two of these birds became very aggressive and I assumed
them to be males. Male Nightingales can generally be housed with other
birds if so desired but not with their own kind or they will disagree.
Females can be housed with others of the same species. They are single
brooded.
Apart from the wonderful song which is the main distinguishing
feature, it is possible for an experienced eye to sex Nightingales with a
reasonable degree of accuracy when in confinement. I find that the male
birds are larger than females, have flatter heads, whiter throats and give
the appearance of having longer legs by showing more of the tibia than the
female. Males tend to carry their wing tips lower than the root of the tail
which sometimes "cocked" higher than that of the female. Males also
tend to croak more deeply, although other call and alarm notes are similar
to the female Nightingale's. Both sexes tend to rock when stationary

momentarily.
The wonderful song commences as soon as the birds arrive on our
shores. The Nightingale sings during the day, with more pauses between
song, but it can be appreciated more during the quiet of a warm May night
when continuous song can be heard, particularly when several males are
singing against each other.
A Nightingale seems to enjoy singing against noise, whether it be during
a thunder storm or a jet aeroplane flying overhead, the cracking of a twig
underfoot on its territory, or, in captivity, competing against the noise of a
motor mower.
Young males do not Inherit the beautiful song pattern but perfect this
whilst in their winter quarters in tropical Africa, in areas which are heavily
populated with Nightingales.

HUMMING BIRDS:
THEIR CARE AND MANAGEMENT

Humming birds are perhaps the most specialised birds known to avi-
culture and can present a great challenge to anyone wishing to maintain
them. For many years, because of similar characteristics, they were placed
along with Swifts (Apodidae), in the order Apodiformes, both having
underdeveloped short legs, greatly enlarged pectoral muscles and lengthened
primary feathers. As well as many similarities there are numerous differen-
ces: while swifts are represented in the Old and New World, there is no
doubt that the humming birds evolved in the New World and only occur
in the Western Hemisphere; where swifts are capable of staying airborne
for extended periods and seem completely aerial by nature, humming
birds, because of their high energy expenditure, measure out their day be-
tween flights for feeding and resting periods, thus conserving energy; when
swifts pair, both sexes perform the parental duties, whereas only the female
humming bird builds the nest and cares for the eggs and the young. No
other bird can match the humming bird's manoeuvrability in flight, and

their ability to fly backwards, sideways or to hover motionless. In view of
these differences, humming birds have been placed by some in an order of
their own (Trochiliformes).
The humming bird family is the second largest in the Western Hemis-
phere, containing over three hundred and twenty species. In the last few
years, several new species have been discovered, three from Peru -
Koepcke's Hermit Phaethornis koepckeae , the Royal Sunangel Heliangelus
regalis and the Nebline Metal-tail Metallura odomae - and from Colombia
the Colourful Puffleg Eriocnemis mirahilis.
With the changing political climate, it is difficult to predict whether
there will be any more humming birds available to the aviculturist. At
present only Peru will allow small numbers of humming birds to be ex-
ported and under supervision from the authorities whose control is strictly
enforced. The birds can only be collected from the western side of the
Andes, but with many South American countries the situation may im-
prove or deteriorate. It is, of course, open to debate whether humming
birds should be exported from their country of origin but if they are
available in Britain, I feel that aviculturists should derive as much know-
ledge of these birds as they can and maintain them in the best possible
way.
Transport
It is always wise to collect humming birds personally as transporting
by rail can sometimes prove hazardous. The journey home and how it
is completed can determine the health of the bird on its arrival. If a large
cage is used, the humming bird will spend the greater part of the journey
flying up and down and, with the movement of the car, they have great
difficulty in feeding and usually arrive exhausted. The most satisfactory
container is a small cardboard box, approximately 8x6x6 inches deep.
Newspaper should be placed on the bottom to absorb any nectar or
droppings. Four holes should be punched into the sides through which
two perches can be inserted, one just above the floor of the box leaving
room to wedge a plastic nectar bottle (the type used by exporters from
Ecuador), and the other perch placed approximately 2 inches from the
floor of the box for the humming bird to perch on whilst travelling. The
top flaps of the box should be cut off and replaced with polythene, one
edge of which should be left loose so that the bird can be placed in the
box and secured after. I have found that they soon adjust to travelling
in this manner and even after long journeys, they remain calm and well
rested. It is most important that only one bird is packed in a box.

It is advisable to cage all newly-imported humming birds individually
for several weeks to assess whether they are suffering from any diseases
or fungal infections. This time spent alone will give the birds a chance to
make up any weight lost during quarantine. I now keep my new birds
caged in this way until they have completed their first moult, because it
is only then that one can decide what sort of accommodation will suit a
particular species (see illustration). To be successful with humming birds
one cannot rely on one form of housing. It is very pleasant to have all the
birds in one tropical flight but there is no control of the birds in this
housing. If a particular specimen is extremely aggressive or timid it will
usually mean a death. Some species of humming birds will not mix at all
so it is best to be versatile when housing a collection of them, depending
on the amount of room and finance available and whether the construc-
tion is to be placed out or indoors. If a spare room in the house is used,
a bank of boxed cages can be placed on one wall to house the timid and
aggressive humming birds, whilst on the other wall an indoor flight can
be constructed depending on the room available. An ideal indoor flight
would be 12 - 14 ft. long, 6 ft. high and 3 ft. wide. A frame can be made
of 1 x VA inch softwood and the front of the frame covered in Vi inch
weld mesh. The frame and the wire mesh should be painted matt black
and the top, back and sides should be covered with heavy duty polythene
or flat transparent plastic for extra light.
Small shelves, attached to the downwards part of the frame, will
accommodate eight to ten medium sized house plants, as well as three or
four saucers of water for bathing, and the addition of some natural perches
will make a most attractive and inexpensive indoor flight which, with
careful selection of species, should be capable of housing up to ten
medium-sized humming birds (see illustration).
If humming birds are to be housed outdoors and a greenhouse or
conservatory is to be used, care should be taken in warm weather to keep
the inside temperature down and the air fresh inside. As the majority of
species available in Britain are from subtropical up to paramo zones, this
type of accommodation is unsuitable. An ideal temperature for maintain-
ing captive specimens is probably between 55-65*F. The ideal form of
outdoor housing is probably a bird room with cages to house small timid
and aggressive birds individually, plus an indoor flight with access to an
equivalent outside flight. The number of humming birds for this type of
accommodation should be calculated on the size of the indoor flight so
that there is no overcrowding when the outside flight is not in use. The

condition of the occupants should be monitored daily and if any individual
is over-aggressive or stressed, it should be removed and caged separately
for a few days before being re-introduced to the flight. If the problem
persists, It will have to be caged indefinitely.
Cages
The ideal cage should be box type, thus giving the humming birds a
sense of security (see illustration). Wherever possible the cages should be
placed in the bird room in a position where the birds will receive some sun-
light through the course of the day.
The stock cages that I use are constructed of chipboard and hardboard
with Vz inch welded mesh fronts. The interiors are painted pale green and
furnished with a natural perch at either end. I also place a perch high up,
close to the wire. I find that a number of my caged humming birds prefer
to roost on a perch in this position and it discourages them from sleeping
whilst clinging to the wire and thus damaging their tails.
The wire mesh and the exterior are painted matt black which aids good
vision of the birds. For the floor covering I use newspaper which is ideal
for absorbing the birds 5 droppings.
In the centre of each cage I place an upturned jam jar on top of which
is placed a saucer of water for bathing - the water should be changed
daily. Into the back corners of each cage I place empty plastic margarine
tubs which are filled with sliced fresh bananas to attract fruit flies into the
cages. I change the banana weekly when cleaning the cage and changing
the newspaper. The size of the stock cage should be as large as possible.
I suggest a minimum of 40 inches long by 16 inches high by 16 inches
deep, which is adequate for one small humming bird. It is bad policy to
have more than one bird per cage as humming birds in general are ex-
tremely pugnacious and in such confined conditions, it would almost
certainly result in the death of one of the occupants.
I have several cages over 7 ft. long in which I have housed pairs of
some of the small humming birds from the genera Popelairia and Acestrura,
etc., without any trouble but as a rule it is best to cage humming birds
individually.
Plants suitable for a humming bird flight
Although it would be practically impossible to furnish sufficient
flowering plants to maintain a collection of humming birds in nectar, the
inclusion of a number of plants to a humming bird flight has numerous
advantages. First, they are pleasing to the eye and can only complement

the humming bird which will also use them to roost in at night and to
nest in. They are also a sanctuary to a humming bird when being chased
by another bird or when moulting. Nowadays the selection of house
plants available is considerable but I have found the following to be
useful:
Philodendron species especially P. scandens, P. elegans and P. hastatum
are all easy to care for. P. scandens is particularly suitable for nesting sites.
Ficus species are ideal plants for the larger flight - F. benghalensis ,
F. elastica, F. lyrata and F. benjamina which is tree-like in appearance, a
small-leaved plant, ideal for inclusion. Several more tree-like plants that I
have grown with success are Schefflera actinophylla and Heptapleurum
arboricola.
Climbing plants such as Rhoicissus rhomboidea, Gssus antarctica,
Syngonium vellozianum, Hoya carnosa , Tetrastigma voinerianam and
Scindapsus aureus all make good additions.
Lastly one can include one or two spectacular looking plants such as
Platycerium alcicome, Anthurium andreanun and perhaps a bromeliad
such as Neoregelias carolinae tricolor.
Plants to be used out of doors must be assessed on the climate and
position of the flight and whether it will be in use for the whole year or
just in the summer. I have a small outside flight to which some of my
humming birds have access all the year round. Although it is covered in
flat plastic sheets, there are two large windows that are open throughout
the warmer months. The floor is of earth and I have planted it with several
species of Clematis, Fuschia, Passiflora caerulea. Salvia, Thunbergia and
Ipomoea, etc.
Nectar
The diet for captive humming birds can be divided into halves, each of
equal importance to maintain them in good health, and the first of these is
a good basic nectar mixture.
A nectar mixture for humming birds has been a most controversial
subject over the years and many diets have been discussed.
I had fairly good results for many years using super hydramin, pollen
and white sugar, but after a conversation and advice on humming bird
diets with Herr K.L. Schuchman, I decided to change my diet and, with
the help of Mr. M. Clifford, a new diet was formulated.
The results have been outstanding , many difficult species having been
established without any problems, and several breedings and numerous
breeding attempts in my collection and those of several other enthusiasts

in Britain who use this diet.
Firstly, the most important part of the diet is to keep the sugar con-
tent down to a maximum of 10%. If a higher volume of sugar is used,
the consequences could be disastrous. A build up of sugar within the body
will result in fungus infections of the bill, tongue and digestive tract. A
higher sugar percentage will result in dehydration of the muscle tissue and
a complete breakdown of the liver, leading eventually to the bird's death.
To make one litre of nectar, the mixture should be: 100 grams of
white sugar, 3 grams of plant pollen, 3 grams of torula yeast and 4 mis
of Min amino.
To make the mixture, first add the yeast, sugar and ground pollen
(grind the pollen in a coffee grinder), mix dry and then dissolve with
lukewarm water. Add the Minamino and when all the ingredients are
mixed together, top up to one litre with cold water. To this nectar, I add
several drops of Becosymand twice a week I add a small pinch of Stress,
a calcium and phosphorus product.
Plastic utensils must be used as metal ones can have a detrimental effect
on the vitamins, especially the B Complex.

A list of the products and their manufacturers is given at the end of
this article, but the following is a brief description of their ingredients:
Torula Yeast is a very fine yeast developed in West Germany and now
manufactured by British Grains. It is relatively tasteless, high in amino
acids and the vitamin B Complex.
Minamino Compound is manufactured from animal by-products con-
taining vitamins, amino acids, minerals and biologicals (e.g. liver ex-
tract, spleen extract). This is an excellent product that remains sus-
pended in the nectar mix for long periods.
Pollen is a natural food that I find of great benefit to my humming
birds.
In addition to the three main nutritional ingredients, I also add very
small amounts of Abidec, one drop per litre. This is a multi-vitamin pro-
duct. I also add several drops of Becosym, a vitamin B Complex.
Cytacon is a vitamin B12 syrup that is useful when encouraging sick
birds to take more nectar. Care must be taken with amounts of vitamin B
used as it draws on the calcium reserves in the body.
Live Food
Live food is just as vital a part of the diet as a well-balanced nectar
mix. An adequate supply of live food keeps the digestive tract in good
order and provides protein, carbohydrates, fibre, calcium and phosphorus.
Live food can best be supplied in the form of fruit flies Drosophila. From
their arrival in Britain to completion of the quarantine period, it is un-
likely that any newly imported birds will have received a sufficient number
of fruit flies as it is very difficult for the importer to breed the large
number required for a lot of humming birds. Ne\yly acquired specimens
need an abundant supply of these insects, especially the more difficult
species. For the first few days a newly acquired humming bird will usually
spend long periods of the day taking quantities of these insects, but once it
has settled in, the number taken is usually reduced and some species show
little interest, taking only the occasional one throughout the day. Immed-
iately preceding the moult, the captive humming bird will need large
quantities of fruit flies and will carry on taking numbers of these insects
throughout the period of its moult. It goes without saying that if a female
goes to nest, vast amounts of fruit flies must be available. If the eggs are
fertile it is wise to increase the fruit fly cultures, especially in a communal
flight where the female may be competing with other humming birds for
the flies available.
The life cycle of fruit flies can be divided into four stages: the adult

fly, egg, larva stage and chrysalis.
To breed fruit flies successfully, fresh slices of banana are necessary
and the more banana, the more flies will be bred. I use empty plastic
icecream tubs in which I place crumpled newspaper, on top of which I
then add two to three inches of sliced banana. The paper absorbs the
moisture from the bananas and allows an efficient and quick hatching of
the chrysalides. The adult fly will lay its eggs on the banana and the eggs
hatch into larvae which, after consuming the fruit, turn into chrysalides.
The young fly will usually appear between two and three weeks after
starting a new culture. It is wise to have fresh cultures starting every week
so that there is a continual cycle. It must be remembered that once the
flies have hatched, the old bananas are of no use and a fresh supply of
fruit is needed each week so that there is always an abundant supply of
flies.
Torpidity
A humming bird has the physiological capability of lowering and
raising its body temperature thus lowering its metabolic rate, and this
is known as torpidity. There are a number of circumstances when a
humming bird will become torpid. If the temperature drops below 93*F
at night, the humming bird has two options - either to sleep normally to
conserve energy or to go torpid and thus effect an even greater conser-
vation of energy. Some wild and captive humming birds will go torpid
every night, sometimes only for one or two hours, then raise their body
temperature and sleep normally before awakening at dawn. I have en-
tered my bird room on several occasions in the early hours of the morn-
ing to observe this, when approximately one-third of my collection can
be torpid, and the other not. On these occasions I have again visited
the bird room just before dawn and when the lights were turned on, I
found all the humming birds sleeping normally. In the wild, species that
live at high altitudes such as the Andean Hillstar Oreotrochilus estella
usually nest in caves or abandoned mineshafts or other protected spots
where the temperature will remain a few degrees above freezing. If the
temperature drops below freezing, the humming bird's body will come out
of torpidity and the bird will start to awaken and to sleep normally, and
thus become warm-blooded. A torpid humming bird cannot withstand
freezing temperatures. In the case of tropical and temperate zone species,
intense feeding before dark usually results in the humming bird sleeping
normally for most or all of the night, but if this feeding activity is stopped
by sudden darkness, a rainstorm or the health of the bird, these species

may go torpid. With the coming morning and the heat of the sun, the
energy saved will be needed to raise the body temperature to normal and
thus arouse the individual.
In aviculture, if a humming bird remains torpid in the morning, the
bird has probably not fed the previous night. On entering the birdroom
it will be found in a deep sleep and fails to respond to any disturbance.
When removed carefully from the perch the bird feels cold to touch and
moves its limbs feebly. I have found that the safest way to revive a tor-
pid humming bird is to cup it in my hands and breathe heavily on it.
The extra heat will immediately start to raise the body temperature.
Awakening a humming bird can take between 10 and 30 minutes. When
the eyes begin to open and the tongue starts to protrude, the tip of the
bill should be placed in a nectar feeder. The humming bird will usually
start to feed. It should be allowed a long drink, care being taken to see
that it does not choke. This intake of nectar will speed up its awakening.
When it has woken up fully, the bird should be carefully examined for
any reasons that may have caused its torpor. Most importantly, the
interior of the bill and mouth should be examined and if there is a cream
coloured, cheese-like growth on the tongue or in the groove of the mouth,
it is suffering from the fungus infection Candida albicans. This infection
is the greatest single problem with captive humming birds and action
should be taken immediately.

There are several publications which give information on the treatment
of sick birds generally, but here I will mention the more common prob-
lems that may affect humming birds.
As with all birds, prevention is better than cure. Because of their high
metabolic rate, humming birds are easily stressed and when ill, they
usually deteriorate very quickly and action must be taken immediately.
If the bird is in a mixed flight, it should be removed to a cage where an
assessment of the cause of illness can be made. The fungus Candida albi-
cans , for many years the scourge of the humming bird keeper, can now be
cured with care. The correct way to treat it is by using "Nystan Oral Sus-
pension" for which a prescription from a veterinary surgeon is needed and
it is wise to keep a bottle in hand so that the bird can be treated imme-
diately.
The correct way to treat the bird is to put one or two drops of Nystan
on to a cotton bud and wipe over the infected area four or five times a day
for three days, then discontinue the treatment for two days. If the con-

dition persists, then the treatment should be continued for a further three
days. If the infection is local and restricted to the tongue, one drop of
Nystan should be put on to a small piece of kitchen tissue, the bird's bill
should be opened and then held closed on the tissue. The tissue should be
gently pulled over the tongue and out of the closed bill. The texture of
the tissue will remove the fungus from the tongue and the Nystan will
treat the infection.
The Nystan must not be swallowed as this can be very dangerous. If
consumed it will destroy the digestive mucus in the crop as well as accu-
late in the stomach, eventually causing bleeding which is then found in the
bird's droppings. When it reaches this stage, death usually occurs within a
few days. I have found that most deaths of captive humming birds are the
result of a fungus infection.
Conjunctivitis. This exists in two forms; the non-infectious symptom
of this disease is recognised by a watery discharge and can easily be cured
by a few drops of proprietary eye lotion into the affected eye. The con-
tagious form has different symptoms. In humming birds there is a watery
discharge, followed by a mucus discharge which clogs the eyelids. The
infected bird must be removed from the birdroom to a place away from
the rest of the collection. The bird may be saved if the infection is
checked early enough with the use of Chloromycetin ointment, but
generally humming birds suffering from this infection are unable to feed
and deteriorate very quickly.
Constipation. This may occur with newly-acquired humming birds
or after changing to a fresh diet, and can prove fatal but the problem can
be solved by replacing the nectar for several hours with a mixture of three
drops of syrup of buckthorn in a tablespoon of 10% sugar water. If the
problem persists, the treatment should be repeated for several days.
If a sick bird refuses its nectar, then rather than let it go torpid or
starve to death, it should be tried with a solution of 10% sugar water plus
a few drops of Minamino. Every day, when the other humming birds'
nectar is changed, the sick bird should be persuaded to take the nectar
mix. If it will not, then it should be put back on the sugar water. Usually
as a sick bird improves, it will take its nectar readily.
There are numerous problems that can affect captive humming birds
but if they are housed hygienically with plenty of fresh air (I open the
windows even in midwinter for half an hour in the morning and again in
the evening), there is no reason why they should not do well and some
individuals live for many years.

CAPTIVE MANAGEMENT OF THE HOOPOE
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.982762472222222" page_id="56284652"  page_num="226" year="" vol="">
By D. COLES (Padstow, Cornwall)
Ten races (Howard and Moore) of the Hoopoe spread eastwards from.
Europe, through Africa, India and areas of China, southwards through
Indo-China, Malaysia and Sumatra. While the nominate race Upupa epops
epops has undoubtedly been kept in captivity, the most frequently seen in
collections is the race U.e. longirostris which is found in the Malay Penin-
sula with most having Thailand as their country of origin. The bird needs
little description for softbill enthusiasts but briefly it is a rufous colour on
the head, neck, back and underparts. The erectile crest feathers are tipped
black and white. Tail and wings are barred black and white. The beak is
long and thin with a slight downwards curve. An excellent coloured plate
of this species, painted by David Reid Henry, appeared in the January/
March 1976 issue of the Avicultural Magazine (Vol. 82, No. 1). Sexes are
similar but the slight differences that do exist are discussed under the
relevant section.
Hoopoes have been kept at Padstow Bird Gardens for twelve years and
have bred for nine. The information gained in this time is set out In the
following article and, with notes from other authors, it is hoped that most
important points in the management of this fascinating species are covered.
Housing
Under no circumstances should Hoopoes be confined to a caged exis-
tence except if they are ill and needing medical treatment, and thee only
if treatment is impracticable in a flight. Aviaries are the only type of acco-
modation suitable for these birds and good housing will contribute as
much to their well-being as a good diet. Types of aviaries vary but they can
be divided into two categories: the indoor aviary as provided by many
bird gardens and zoological collections; and the outside enclosure provided
by many fanciers. From my experience, they do better having access to
fresh air, although they will thrive and breed in most situations if some
thought is given to the surroundings.
A large percentage of this species' time is spent foraging on the ground
so this should be made as interesting as possible, with areas of turf, soil,
leaf litter, small stones and rotten wood all providing an irresistable temp-
tation to search and turn debris for items of food. Open ground should be
turned frequently and tame individuals will follow the spade, consuming
anything edible that is turned up. Aviaries should be planted with shrubs

and creepers which, apart from pleasing the eye, will attract many insects.
Branches need only be minimal, allowing adequate perching space but not
needlessly cluttering up available flying space, although they are very
adept at avoiding obstacles when in full flight.
A pond should be provided but little use is made of it. A dry area is
essential as these birds spend time most days dustbathing - a patch of soil
seems to be the preferred medium.They are also fond of sunbathing and
adopt such strange postures when laid on the ground with head back, beak
open and wings and legs all over the place that the visiting public get quite
concerned for the birds' well-being.
Compatability
More than one pair should not be kept together - sexually mature birds
of the same sex will squabble which is likely to become serious if a pair is
formed. Young from one season can be left until the onset of the next but
it is always best to separate them immediately they are self-sufficient as it
cuts down competition for livefood if the parents nest again. They can be
mixed in relative safety with other softbiU species but ideally should have
an aviary to themselves or, if mixed, companions such as waders or doves
are ideal as they give little or no competition.
Hoopoes are generally not aggressive towards others but the odd alter-
cation will occur if provoked, although they are not against prodding
another bird if it gets in the way. The only trouble encountered towards
another species I have seen involved, and was initiated by, a solitary female
Spur-winged Plover which was becoming broody and tweaked the tail of
a passing male Hoopoe. He objected, turned around and with a short hop
landed on the Plover which soon fled. Hoopoes are inquisitive by nature
and will probe in the nests of other species if accessible and invariably
damage the contents.
Diet
Hoopoes require as varied a diet of live food as it is possible to offer
when they are first imported, but it cannot be over-emphasised that they
should be coaxed to take inanimate foods as soon as possible after acqui-
sition, simply because of the many hazzards which govern the supply and
culture of the various forms of livefood. Getting Hoopoes to take other
foods is not a simple matter and can present many problems as livefood
will always be consumed in preference to anything else offered, but this
can be overcome by decreasing the live food during the day, once the birds
are in excellent health, and eventually other foods will be picked at and

eaten. However, an adequate supply of live food must be given in the even-
ing to ensure that they are not deprived of a good feed to last the night,
until it is absolutely certain that enough food is being taken. Some indi-
viduals take more readily than others but all will accept it eventually.
Other forms of acceptable food are limited but minced beef or hard-
boiled egg are the most beneficial, and should be mixed with a high
quality insectile mixture to a crumbly consistency which can be eaten
readily. Hoopoes throw their food back so items other than live food
must be of a suitable size and texture to allow this. Feeding a fine insec-
tile mixture on its own is useless. Strips of ox heart in water (to prevent
drying)can also be given and the odd bird will take a little soaked puppy
meal - this latter was an acquired taste by one breeding male.
The kinds of acceptable live food are varied: blowfly maggots being
the most readily available can form the bulk - personal experiences and
thoughts may dictate here but from a reliable source and properly cleaned,
maggots are an important part of the diet. Apart from the nutritional
value and moisture content of the grub itself, it can be coated with liquid
vitamins and dusted with various powdered preparations and still survive
whereas mealworms, the other main avicultural live food will soon die if
given the same treatment. In addition to the maggots, blowflies and their
pupae are also taken. Three states of Tenebrio molitor - the mealworm,
pupae and beetle - are taken avidly. Crickets, grasshoppers, various instars
of locust, spiders, moths, earthworms, pink mice (up to three days old),
leatherjackets and a whole host of procurable creatures are taken. Lizards,
tadpoles, small frogs, woodlice and ants are recorded as taken in the wild.
If provided with a natural earth floor with areas of turf and leaf litter,
many hourse will be spend probing for insects. Water appears not to be
important but should always be available. I have never seen a Hoopoe
drink, all moisture being derived from the food they eat but Benson
(1968) indicates that some individuals hand-reared by hum drank a small
but adequate amount and Lint (1964) says the female of a breeding pair at
San Diego Zoo left the nest only to drink. Neither is water used for bath-
ing as dust bathing takes precedence.
Hardiness
Housed indoors, there is very little to worry about even if in unheated
quarters. Outside, once acclimatised, they are reasonably hardy and in a
mild sheltered area should be able to over-winter without problems - over-
wintering birds here at Padstow have actually hatched young over the
Christmas/New Year period. Provisions must be made for winter quarters

in areas susceptible to hard weather, preferably attached to the flight so
the birds can be shut away if necessary and given liberty when the weather
is not so bad. Too much heat "softens" up the plumage and is not bene-
ficial A perspex covered area should be provided, not just the roof but the
aviary sides also as the birds dislike a chilly wind very much and precau-
tions must be taken against it. Accommodating in a sheltered area is not
enough as wind can come from a direction other than that which normally
prevails.
Health
Hoopoes seem fairly resilient to disease once established, if given proper
conditions and attention. Keeping birds of any description in unsuitable
conditions is asking for trouble and there is no exception. Because they
spend a considerable time probing the ground, it is a good policy to worm
them periodically, although I have never personally encountered such
problems. A few drops of Thiabenzole suspension, or similar preparation
can be applied to maggots and given after witholding their food for several
hours.
Air sac mite has afflicted nestlings only and has proved difficult to
shift because affected birds have had to be removed from the nest and,
besides medication, needed hand rearing. I think it was stress as much as
anything that contributed to their death. The problem has been solved by
changing their nest site from a wall to one which can be cleaned more
easily. Splayed legs have been a problem but this is discussed more fully
under "Nest Sites".
Longevity
Records of longevity are practically non-existent. One of our initial
pair of birds, which were among the first reared at Winged World in 1970,
is still alive and well at 12 years old. Both birds proved to be males, the
other died aged 10. Females, especially breeding females, are shorter lived -
the longest one of our hens has lived was six years and she died showing
signs of senility towards the end. Females generally seem to be more deli-
cate.
Sexing
The main visual criteria of size and colour for sexing has only a limited
application where Hoopoes are concerned for there is much variation be-
tween individuals and races. I have seen females which are brighter in
colour than proven males and of the breeding pair owned by Stamps (1978)

the female was larger than its mate. There are, however, several other apects
which can be used for sexing, a combination of which should prove a
bird's sex beyond doubt, especially if comparisons can be made. The crest
is usually larger in the male and Everitt (1964) says that males have nine
pairs of black-tipped feathers as opposed to seven pairs in the female. The
neck in the male is thicker and the black and white barring is more clear
cut (England). The beak is generally longer in the male but this is not al-
ways so - the female of our breeding pair was 1.5 cm longer in the beak
than her mate.
Vocalisation in the breeding season is a good indicator. Males will re-
peatedly utter their characteristic "hoop-hoop" over long periods during
the day while females generally remain silent. I have only heard females
"hoop" on two occasions, their more usual utterance being a growling
"kaar" when alarmed or excited. A male's call will carry for some distance
and apart from this, his general behaviour should make sexing simple at
the onset of the breeding season.
Courtship
There is no courtship display as such but males become very vocal,
perched for long periods uttering their characteristic "hoop-hoop". Court-
ship usually starts with the male offering the female an item of live food.
Early in the year she does not always accept it as frequently the male is in
condition in advance of the hen. However, once she attains condition, any
choice morsels of food, either given to the male or unearthed by him, is
taken up to her. Only when she has had her fill will he eat.
Occasionally the cock will flutter excitedly around the hen, uttering
a growling "kaar" but generally there is very little to courtship other than
the ritual feeding of the hen by the male which cements the pair bond. On
the occasions when mating has been observed, it has taken place on a
perch, never the ground.
Nest Sites
Males come into condition earlier than females and therefore do most
of the prospecting for a site, calling the female over to any possibility,
fluttering excitedly about in the vicinity. In the wild, a wide range of sites
are used and holes of most descriptions are utilised, ranging from crevices
in walls, old buildings, heaps of rubble, deserted termite mounds, hollows
in trees and apparently not infrequently underground among rocks and
tree roots. In captivity it is not impossible to recreate sites utilised in the
wild although it is not very practical to have a nest cavity which cannot be

cleaned readily, as was the case with the site used by the original pair at
Padstow Bird Gardens. This was situated in a Cornish stone wall on to
which most of our aviaries back. A hole was made and the front built up
with slate to leave just the entrance hole and the nesting cavity. All pro-
gressed well for several years but then young began to become afflicted
with air sac mite so it was blocked off and a more conventional type of
nest box used. No hard and fast dimensions exist as to size of nest box -
if a pair is in breeding condition, nothing will stop them from laying if a
box is present. Obviously it must not be too small as it may have to acco-
modate up to six young. Natural logs are ideal and can be easily adapted to
facilitate easy of cleaning. Once one site is used, it seems to have prece-
dence over all others.
One important aspect is the medium to be used for a base on which the
female will lay her eggs. Under no condition should it be peat. Chicks are
susceptible to splayed legs which was initially thought to be due to a
vitamin deficiency but it failed to respond to additional preventatives and
calcium and multivitamins were already given. It was eventually traced to
the peat which was thought to give little support to the chicks' feet causing
them to splay. Chips of rotten wood were used as a replacement and
eradicated the trouble. These chips had to be replaced or added to perio-
dically as they tended to break down.

Eggs and Incubation
</subsubsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.994082941176471" page_id="56284657"  page_num="231" year="" vol="">
Hoopoes are unusual amongst hole-nesters in that clutch size is so
variable. One old account records 11 in a nest; whether this is the effort
of a solitary female or the work of two (sexually mature females will
visit a nest of a breeding female if she vacates) remains a mystery. Clutches
of one or two are frequently reported but three to five seems to be the
normal number. Clutches of siz have been laid on at least two occasions
at Padstow,and on one occasion all six hatched but subsequently died.
Eggs are laid at daily intervals.
The species is multi-brooded with the number of broods dependent on
the age of the birds, success rate of previous broods, amount of live food
fed (Hoopoes cannot be expected to breed if encouraged to feed solely
on artificial food with only minimal amounts of live food available at the
onset of the breeding season; live food should be fed ad lib. from the end
of February), location and climate. If all conditions are right, the first
clutches of the year are larger and decrease in number as the year pro-
gresses. Four or five broods can be reared in a season if an early start is
made and the broods small. However, three broods are about normal but

I suspect that pairs kept in tropical houses could be continuous breeders.
Eggs vary in colour from light blue to stone and are unmarked. A
clutch of five that were measured ranged from 23.5 mm x 18 mm to
25.5 mm x 18 mm (average 25 mm x 17.7 mm). One egg measured by
Stamps was 24 mm x 16 mm. Incubation is undertaken solely by the fe-
male which rarely vacates the nest and is fed by the male with live food,
very rarely soft food. Incubation starts nearly always with the laying of
the first egg but may be delayed until the second egg and lasts for 18 days.
Some reports give 21 days but I suspect that this is guided by the thought
that incubation does not start until the last egg is laid, or the data is
derived from a clutch with only one fertile egg, maybe the last bird that
hatched after the female had been incubating for three weeks. Our breed-
ing pair, housed outside in a sheltered aviary, nested over a three-week
period in December and January (the nestlings died) but such attempts are
rare. More often it was early to mid-March before nesting started. Stamps'
pair started in June.

<bodyText confidence="0.999627227272727" page_id="56284658"  page_num="232" year="" vol="">
Brooding of young is carried out by the female and she is fed in the
nest by the male which meticulously kills and morsels of food before
taking them up - she then feeds the chicks. An abundance of live food
must be offered at this time - if this is done, even large broods of four or
five will be reared without the brood throwing a runt. Some food given
must be coated with a multi-vitamin preparation and with calcium. I use a
liquid multi-vitamin Adexolin which is applied to maggots, followed by
calcium. Needless to say, as wide a variety of live foods as possible must
be offered at this stage and from about six days even pink mice will be
taken. These the male kills and works over until most bones in the body
are broken and it is fairly limp. Young have sizeable gapes and can manage
large items. From about eight days, females assist with feeding and it is
then given direct. When large broods are reared, it is almost a continual
shuttle service between food pot and nest box.
Conflicting reports exist about the odour of a nest with young. Our
many broods rarely smelled and although I only saw the hen clean the
nest on two occasions, it was fairly clean when vacated. The hen does have
a strong body smell produced by oil from the preen gland which seems to
be the usual odour from a nest. I suspect that this odour, which reputedly
is at its strongest in the breeding season, is an aid to protecting the young -
it would have to be a brave, stupid or exceedingly hungry predator that
poked its beak into a Hoopoe nest!

Four Juvenile Hoopoes hatched at Padstow Bird Gardens
The period in the nest varies but can last between 20 and 25 days
(young with splayed legs have been longer, but this is no guidance), and
depends a lot on the weather. Small broods tend to vacate on the same
day but larger ones are spread over two. On fledging young are similar
in coloration to the adults but are smaller with shorter beaks and crests.
The young start feeding themselves at about five weeks but continue to
accept food from parents for some weeks and it is probable that the hen
will again be incubating before total independance is achieved - the cock
solely feeding the young once the female starts to lay again.
Hand-rearing
Personal experience with this species is very limited and confined to
sick nestlings which did not have a good survival rate. Benson (1968)
gives an account of the hand-rearing of wild-taken nestlings. The diet used
was fresh, raw minced beef and ground hard-boiled egg to which was added
calcium powder and cod liver oil. Live food, being difficult to obtain, was
rarely fed but if the need arises to hand-rear Hoopoes in captivity, live food

Although yearling females have laid, and even paired to a mature male,
the eggs have been infertile. Sexual maturity is attained in the second year,
at least for females. I have never paired a yearling male to a mature female
but suspect that some could be fertile although really a young pair should
not be expected to breed until their second year and this also applies to
wild-caught birds obtained from a dealer. However, a pair which has been
accustomed to captivity should at least make some attempt in the first
year of acquisition.

ON THE ADAPTABILITY OF TANAGERS TO CAPTIVE CONDITIONS
</sectionHeader>

By Dr. JOHAN INGELS (Destelbergen, Belgium)
Tanagers rank high among the most beautiful birds and many have a
very striking colour pattern. Aviculturists requiring exotic colours are
unlikely to find more appealing birds. I only mention here the well-known
Paradise Tanager Tangara chilemis , a small tanager of incomparable
beauty, exhibiting an amazing combination of exquisite colours.
When, at the end of the 19th century, aviculture, in the true sense of
the word, became a reality, only tanagers found in the eastern half of the
South American continent were available. Up until World War II avicultur-
ists concentrated their efforts on those tanagers brought to the Western
World by maritime transport. The Violaceous Euphonia Euphonia violacea,
the Seven-coloured or Superb Tanager Tangara fastuosa and the Brazilian
Scarlet Tanager Ramphocelus bresilius were typical of these so-called
"Brazilian" tanagers. Breeding results as early as 1888 with another Brazilian
tanager, the Green-headed Tanager Tangara seledon are mentioned in litera-
ture. This success most probably represents the first breeding of a tanager
in captivity (Hopkinson, 1926).
In the late 1950s, with the development of aerial transport, tanagers
from the Andean parts of South America, and to a lesser extent from Cen-
tral America, became available to an increasing number of aviculturists.
The Golden Tanager Tangara arthus , the Blue-headed Tanager Tangara
cyanicoliis , the Blue-winged and Scarlet-bellied Mountain Tanagers Anisog-
nathus flavinuchm and Anisognathus igniventris respectively, and the
Flame-ramped Tanager Ramphocelus flammigerus are typical of the so-
called "Andean" tanagers. Whereas the Silver-throated and Golden-masked
Tanagers Tangara icterocephala and Tangara larvata respectively are typical
of the Central American tanagers.
In the second half of the 20th century, tanagers became a common *
sight in private aviaries, bird gardens and zoological collections. True avi-
culturists, both amateurs and professionals, have always justified their
keeping of birds under controlled conditions by studying their behaviour
and by breeding from them. The- fast-growing awareness among avicul-
turists, that merely keeping birds in captivity was not enough, but that
every effort should be made to breed from them, has helped substan-
tially to increase our knowledge of tanagers under captive conditions.
Unfortunately, however, the number of breeding results is in no way com-
parable to the number of tanagers Imported throughout the past years.

Dr. . INGELS TANAGERS
The number of species imported rose steeply in the early 1960s,
but has now begun to fall off due to various export, import and quarantine
tine regulations. This has forced aviculturists to evaluate carefully their
keeping of tanagers in confinement.
I shall restrict this paper to those genera or groups of tanagers which
have always played an important role in aviculture; by these I mean
Chlorophonia, Euphonia, Tangara, Ramphocelus, Thraupis, Tachyphonus,
and Anisognathus. The main questions I shall consider are: 1) availa-
bility, with regard to the continually declining wild populations; 2) adap-
tability to captive conditions, with special regard to the change over to
artificial foods; 3) reproduction under controlled conditions.
Availability
In New World habitats where human activity is present, avian popula-
tions have decreased at an alarming rate. Unfortunately, it is almost impos-
sible to estimate the exact damage to avifauna brought about by destruction
or alteration by man of a natural habitat (Buechner&amp; Buechner, 1970).
Most tanagers rely upon undisturbed environments for food and reproduc-
tion. However, several genera are to a certain degree able to adapt to man-
altered areas.
A pronounced decline of a given species through loss of original habitat
and/or its ease in adapting to secondary forest or cultivated areas should
be considered when evaluating its "availability". Only species able to main-
tain stable populations in their continually changing habitat, without
regard to their being in great demand for avicultural purposes, can be con-
sidered as potential aviary birds. Chlorophonia, Euphonia and Anisogna-
thus are among those tanagers suffering severely from contacts with a
man-dominated environment. Tangara, Ramphocelus, Thraupis and Tachy-
phonus are less vulnerable, through their relative adaptability to man-altered
areas.
Adaptability
The nervous nature of most tanagers renders them unsuitable as cage
birds. They are, however, suitable aviary subjects, adjusting themselves
more readily to spacious, planted flights.
In adapting to captivity, nutritional requirements play a most impor-
tant role. Most tanagers are less frugivorous than is accepted generally,
relying to a great extent upon insects as a substantial part of their daily
food requirements. This insect-dependency is less easy to substitute than
is fruit and nectar.

Today, most bird parks and zoological gardens can offer a well-balanced
and studied diet to their so-called omnivorous birds. Private aviculturists
mostly rely upon experience to find a satisfactory feeding method. How-
ever, fruit flies, maggots, blowflies, crickets, locusts and mealworms must
form a substantial part of the daily food ration for tanagers. A feeding
method based upon fruit, e.g. apples, oranges and bananas, will most
certainly cause nutritional deficiencies, during the long term.
The more omnivorous genera that accept readily a substitute diet are:
most Tangara, Ramphocelus, Thraupis and Tachyphonus. In their natural
habitat these have been observed to come readily to feeding tables con-
taining fruit (Skutch, 1971). Adaptation to "artificial" food has been
recorded to be most difficult among Chlorophonia, Euphonia and some
Tangara (Ingels, et al , 1976).
An adequate daily diet will directly influence longevity of tanagers in
captivity. Longevity will indicate, therefore, the efficiency of an artificial
diet as a substitute for natural food. Longevity has been best in Rampho-
celus, Thraupis and Tachyphonus species; these being the most omnivor-
ous under natural conditions.
Reproduction
To have healthy, well-established tanagers is not necessarily a guarantee
of successful breeding results.
An important problem to cope with is determining the appropriate sex
of a given bird. Sexes are distinguishable in genera such as Chlorophonia,
Euphonia, Ramphocelus and Tachyphonus. Problems occur when attemp-
ting to sex Tangara and Thraupis. However, male tanagers of these two
groups, when in good condition, are more nervous, aggressive and noisy
than the females.
Usually, provision of suitable nesting facilities is no problem; sites
readily chosen are nest-boxes and wire nest-cups. All artificial structures
and natural nest sites in small trees and shrubs giving sufficient support to
a nest, are suitable. Material offered to nesting tanagers is of crucial impor-
tance. The choice of nesting material must be comprehensive, allowing
construction of a firm nest. In the wild, tanagers use large amounts of cob-
web to attach their nest to nearby supports. Cobweb being difficult to
supply, may be replaced with soft, flexible materials, e.g. plant roots,
weed stems, fibres, etc. Coarser material for building the nest structure is
more easily provided.
Usually, fertility is not a problem when breeding tanagers. In genera
such as Chlorophonia and Euphonia , which produce more than two eggs

Dr. J. INGELS - TANAGERS
per clutch, clear eggs may occur, contrary to the two (rarely three) eggs
per clutch producing genera such as Tangara, Ramphocelus and Thraupis.
Parent birds that accept a wide choice of food items will more easily
rear young than pairs relying upon a restricted diet. Live food is vital in
bringing young through their first days, and at such times some parent
birds will accept food items which normally they would refuse.
Competition with other aviary inmates for the live food offered may
prove fatal to the young. Therefore, a pair of tanagers certainly stand a
better chance of rearing young if housed on their own. Offering food
several times a day will stimulate parent birds to bring food to the nest.
Presenting live food at different sites in the aviary will encourage them
to forage.
In captive tanagers, males will almost always help in rearing their
offspring. However, a lone female will be able to rear two nestlings to
independence.
Conclusion
From the above account of the general suitability to captivity of
tanagers, one can draw some definite conclusions.
Ramphocelus, Tachyphonus and Thraupis are, without doubt, most
suitable for avicultural purposes; they readily accept captive conditions
and substitute foods and they will easily reproduce. Ramphocelus are
attractive aviary birds; however, their natural shyness and aggressive
manner, especially during the breeding season, can cause problems.
Tachyphonus and Thraupis are less colourful; also the latter are diffi-
cult to sex. For an aviculturist attempting to establish captive breeding
strains, those three genera of tanagers must be the most challenging. They
have sufficient positive qualities to guarantee a fair chance for success.
Tangara species, considered for long as the '&amp;quot;easy" tanagers, are too
insectivorous and difficult to sex to rank high among those tanagers best
suited to aviculture. Euphonia, Chlorophonia and Anisognathus are too
specialised (food, habitat) and are, therefore, suited only to the really
experienced aviculturist. The relative importance of the different groups
of tanagers in public bird collections is best illustrated by analysing the
breeding results with tanagers as published in the International Zoo
Yearbook (Volumes 1-17, 1959-1975). For those 17 seasons, 60 success-
ful breeding results are reported, and are as follows: Euphonia - 1 (1.5%);

MANAGEMENT METHODS OF A BACK-GARDEN COLLECTION

Whilst I do not suppose that my methods of maintaining softbills differ
greatly from those of the majority of other birdkeepers, I was happy to
agree to write this article, mainly I hope for the benefit of those people
who have not yet experienced the challenge of maintaining these birds in
their collections.
Since the quarantining of imported birds from overseas was made com-
pulsory by the British Government early in 1976, and with many countries
restricting the export of their native fauna, many species which were once
freely available are now virtually unobtainable. However, at the time of
writing (July, 1982), many species, some unusual ones amongst them, are
still obtainable, although the cost of purchasing them is now unfortunately
out of the reach of many people.

R.E. OXLEY - BACK GARDEN COLLECTION
It has always been the duty of birdkeepers to allow the species in their
care the opportunity to reproduce in confinement. With the exception of a
handful of well-known aviculturists, very few people have successfully
reared softbills in captivity, and of those that have been raised, only two
or three species have reproduced past the first generation. Nowadays I
believe that many more softbill owners are encouraging their birds to
breed but most of these people are not prepared for the headaches and
heartaches that go hand-in-hand with softbill breeding.
Over the years I have had more than my fair share of successes on the
showbench with my birds but my greatest ambition has always been to
breed from the species in my possession. All my birds have been purchased
with this foremost in mind. Like the majority of birdkeepers, I have been
guilty in the past of keeping too many birds and have not always been able
to devote an aviary completely to an individual pair of birds. This I believe
is essential if softbills are to successfully rear young in captivity, and the
aviaries I now have were erected primarily to house separate "pairs" of
birds, with breeding being the ultimate aim.
Housing
Living as I do in a built-up area on the outskirts of London and having
only an average sized garden, I am restricted, like the majority of other
birdkeepers, as to the number of aviaries that I can have and comfortably
maintain. Apart from anything else, having too many enclosures can prove
a difficult and time-consuming chore when one has to feed a collection
before leaving home for a day's work, rather than the pleasure that it
should be.
Although I am still keeping more birds than I should, the known true
pairs in my collection are housed wherever possible on their own during
the breeding season. My accommodation comprises a range of flights
each measuring 3m x 1.7 m x 2 m high. Most of them are planted with
a variety of shrubs and bushes and are suitable for the species that I keep,
the largest of which is the Indian Tree Pie Dendrocitta vagabunda. How-
ever, active species such as touracos should be housed in larger flights on
account of their agility. If an aviary is of exceptionally large dimensions,
it may be possible to house more than one breeding pair of softbills
together, but care must be taken as the competition for live food may
result in a dominant species persecuting the others with fatal results.
Parrakeet nest-boxes and hollow logs are provided for hole-nesting
birds whilst wicker baskets and open fronted boxes of various sizes are
placed in suitable positions for other species. Whenever possible, I leave

my birds in their aviaries the whole year round as they are able to come
naturally into breeding condition with the lengthening of days in early
spring. I have found that those birds which are put into heated indoor
quarters for the winter months often take time to settle in when put out
again in the spring, often resulting in the loss of a month or two of the
breeding season.
I do not consider myself to be an "authority* 5 on breeding spftbills
in captivity by any stretch of the imagination, far from it, as I claim to
have successfully reared only three species to maturity in over 25 years
of keeping softbills. Many other species have nested, laid eggs and hatched
young with me in the past but for one reason or another have failed to
rear young to independence. It is my belief that successful breeding claims
should only be substantiated once the species in question has successfully
moulted into adult plumage and over-wintered in captivity.
Feeding
The softbill mixture that I feed to all my birds is one which I mix
myself and is used widely by many other birdkeepers throughout the
world. The recipe for this softfood has appeared in print in many other
publications over the years but for the benefit of those who have not seen

Ingredients
1 lb. self-raising flour
1 lb. granulated sugar
6 eggs
2 lbs. honey
250 ml rosehip syrup
1 lb. beef dripping
2 lbs. peanuts
2 lbs. cheese
1 lb. raisins or sultanas
4 lbs. canary-rearing food
1 lb. soya flour
1 tablespoon Phillips Yeast Mixture
Method
1) Mix the self-raising flour, sugar and eggs (including shells) together
into a batter. Pour into a baking tin and bake in an oven (177*C/Gas
Mark 3) for about 1 % hours until hard right through. When cool, grind it

into as fine a flour as possible.
2) Grind the peanuts, cheese and raisins/sultanas in a grinder and mix
together with the canary rearing food in a large container. Warm the honey
and melt the beef dripping and pour onto the above mixture, adding the
rosehip syrup. Mix thoroughly.
3) When the above mixture is cold, add the cake mixture (1), soya flour
and the Phillips Yeast Mixture. Mix thoroughly.
This mixture should keep indefinitely if placed in a plastic container
with an air tight lid and, in my experience, birds of every size and descrip-
tion will eat it avidly.
In addition to the above, all my birds receive diced fruit, usually con-
sisting of apples, pears, bananas and grapes when in season. Soaked sulta-
nas are given when grapes are unobtainable and various other soft fruits are
also given to some species when in season. I also make up a nectar mixture
which is given to those birds which require it and a well-known brand of
Madeira cake, moistened with the nectar, is also given to some species.
Minced meat and finely grated hard-boiled eggs are given to all the birds
and, having acquired the taste, they all take these foods with relish, even
the nectar feeders.
Live food is given to all birds in small quantities throughout the year.
Until recently I fed maggots (blow-fly larvae) ad lib. to all my birds. How-
ever, recently I have discontinued feeding maggots as I have been unable
to obtain a reliable supply locally. Mealworms and crickets now form the
basic live food which I feed to my birds as these are easily obtainable from
commercial sources nowadays. Both mealworms and crickets are easy to
keep and breed and are kept in large plastic containers (plastic dustbins are
ideal). Unfortunately, when young birds are in the nest, the amount of
crickets and mealworms that I am able to breed is insufficient to provide
to the parent birds so additional supplies have to be purchased during the
breeding season. On occasions I use locusts for feeding to some of the
larger birds and also small mice to those species which are able to con-
sume them. During the time when chicks are in the nest, whenever possible
I try to collect wood ant pupae which I throw on to the floor of the aviary
for the parents to collect - ants as well. In addition, any invertebrates that
I find in the garden are consumed with the exception of slugs, snails and,
strangely, earthworms by some species. In the past I have propagated fruit-
fly, white worm and wax moth cultures but the birds that I keep nowa-
days are generally too large to appreciate them.

Conclusion

<bodyText confidence="0.998480666666667" page_id="56284669"  page_num="243" year="" vol="">
As stated previously, I believe that more and more "back-garden" en-
thusiasts are attempting to provide the conditions which are necessary for
complete breeding success. However, I do wish that those persons with
odd birds would attempt to pair them up with birds of the opposite sex,
either by selling, loaning or exchanging with other individuals. I would like
to record my thanks to those other members of this Society who, in the
last two years, have loaned valuable birds to me on breeding terms when
I would have had difficulty in purchasing them elsewhere.
Softbill keeping is certainly a very rewarding hobby but before success-
ful breeding results are achieved, a lot of headaches and heartaches are
experienced by the keeper. Seeing a pair of softbills bring up a nest of
young successfully is a very rewarding experience.

This paper is an amalgamation of notes forwarded independently by
various authors for publication in this special issue. For obvious reasons,
all the articles could not be printed in full, and because of the similar man-
agement and breeding biology, the notes have been grouped to form one
informative article which it is hoped covers most husbandry aspects of the
species concerned. The editors express their appreciation to the authors
for agreeing to this and hope that the finished article more than compen-
sates for the trouble and time involved in preparing their original papers.
L. Gibson provides the bulk of the notes on the White-rumped Shama
Copyschus malabaricus which bred with him for five years, and it is to this
species and author that uncredited notes apply; additional notes are sup-
plied by Loic Hervouet. Dr. Lai, of Sabah, contributed on hybrid White-
crowned x White-rumped Shamas C. stricklandii x C. malabaricus which
he first reared in 1971 and has done so frequently since. L. Gibson also
contributes on the Magpie Robin C. saularis as does R. Oxley, D. Lewis
and B. Woodley.

NOTES ON SHAMAS AND MAGPIE ROBIN
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.99927175" page_id="56284670"  page_num="244" year="" vol="">
The name Shama is perhaps from the Portuguese verb "chamar" (pro-
nounced "shamar") which means to call or whistle. In Singapore and West
Malaysia Shamas are simply called Long-tails and in Sabah are known as
Yellow-necked Robins. Dhyal is the Indian name for C saularis (it is pro-
nounced "Dh-yal"), and the apt name Magpie Robin is self-explanatory.
The latter is a favourite of Chinese fanciers and is common in the bird
markets of Taiwan and Hong Kong where It is called "knows the time bird".
It also has a popular colloquial name, the politest rendering of which is
"pig dung bird".
The Magpie Robin is the more "domestic" of the two and is commonly
seen in large gardens, parks and suburbs in close proximity to man. The
Shama is more reticent and prefers a drier habitat. Both are thicket birds
and spend most of the time in or under low cover. However, Gibson has
seen a cock Shama singing from the top of a high tree, right above the
traffic's roar, in the small and busy botanical gardens in the middle of
Honolulu. But even in Hawaii, where it has been introduced, Shamas pre-
fer the quieter spots at the drier ends of the island.
The long tail of Copsychus gives the bird an advantage when moving
through thickets, enabling it to change direction instantly while keeping its
wings half-closed and it also acts as a balance in the start-stop manoeuvres
in dense bush.
Gibson has never found Shamas to be dangerous to his other birds, des-
pite many reports to the contrary. They are certainly bossy, and have had
terrible power struggles with his Chloropsis but usually they ended up by
backing down. Dhyals are even more pushy, probably due to their heavier
build and they fought Chloropsis to a draw. Lesser birds had to wait their
turn at the food tray, but were never harmed. Some care must be exercised
when mixing Shamas with other species. Both Gibson and Hervouet had
their Shamas separated and the former considers it unwise to house them
together outside the breeding season; usually the cock will attack the hen
but sometimes the latter is dominant. They should be introduced with care
at the beginning of the season at a time when they can be observed close-
ly for most of the day. Preferably they should be in sight of one another
for a few weeks first. This Is best done In adjacent aviaries, where their
behaviour can be judged better. When In breeding condition, an armed
truce prevails and this state can be determined when either bird is allowed
to approach the feeding dish, unmolested by the other. They should be
separated at the end of the season, as soon as they quarrel over food.
Chicks are equally intolerant of each other and should be separated at not
\0x25A0later than six weeks of age. A three-month old youngster got attacked in-

stantly by its mother when she accidentally got into its cage. The above
aggressive patterns may not apply in a very large aviary where there are
several feeding stations. Both Lewis and Woodley over-wintered pairs of
Dhyals together but caution must prevail.
Copsychus are hole-nesters, although exceptions have been reported
but these were perhaps due to lack of suitable nesting holes. They are
easy to cater for, being mostly insectivorous. They regularly cough up
beetle casings and other chitinous objects, and for this reason they are
difficult to dose with medication, especially with pills.
Health
All Copsychus obtained by Gibson had some intestinal parasites. The
one they all had in common was Dwarf Tapeworm Hymenolepis spp.
Nearly all other ground feeders examined also had this worm. This in-
cludes 100% of Blackbirds Turdus merula and all Garmlax. These worms
are easily removed by dosing with one-eighth of a tablet of Yomesan.
Other parasites included Coccidia, Capillaria and Strongyloid worms.
The only consistent, though minor problem was with moulting. About
every second moult, one or other bird had several defective tail feathers.
If these are bad, they are usually dropped and regrown before nesting
starts. Birds bred by Gibson have not been troubled with it so far. This
is dietary in origin and although birds get the same diet, it is perhaps
significant that the domestic-bred ones have been free of it.
One old Magpie Robin male got very twisted and thickened defective
feathers for the last two years before he died, but in retrospect this was
just an ageing process.
Once Copsychus have got safely over the import period, they prove to
be tough and long lived. Gibson had a hen Shama aged at least seven years
old, and still nesting.
Chicks were lost mostly through males throwing them out of the nest
in both species. The last brood of Shamas for 1980 with Gibson was lost
through carelessness by the hen which crammed day-old chicks with whole
mealworm pupae and choked them. Lai reports a female regularly eating
her newly hatched chicks.
Lai reports a high mortality in hybrid Shama nestlings, mostly from un-
explained causes but found the incidence greater in the rainy season. Post
mortems carried out on chicks which refused food and showed signs of
respiratory distress found Pseudomonas aeroginosa infection. This was des-
pite giving them prophylactic antibiotic such as Ampicilin and Sulphur.
Gibson found that on a number of occasions one chick in a nest did not

grow like the others, and died before leaving the nest. The cause was not
determined.
A potentially serious problem with both adults and chicks is their
penchant for swallowing long stringy objects such as grass, hair, rubber
bands and lengths of plastic, which they bang about for ages before
suddenly gulping them down. Gibson lost one hen Magpie Robin this way.
She was building her second nest when she suddenly went apathetic and
ill. She sat on the ground and vomited any mealworms she had swallowed.
She died next day and her stomach was found to be impacted with a single
piece of grass which, when unwound, proved to be 33 cm (13 inches) long.
Later a Shama chick was found to have a horse hair sticking from its
mouth. This was worked out and came up with the chick's last feed, tan-
gled in the end. The hair was 18-20 cm (7-8 inches) long. In the same nest
on the same day, another chick was found half-strangled with a horse hair
tightly wound around its neck. It was removed and the chick survived.
Two days later, in the same nest, another chick (possibly one of the above
two) was seen to swallow yet another horse hair, which apparently did no
harm. This shows the danger of using horse hair as a material for nest con-
struction.
Another time a newly weaned, tame Shama was heard to bang some-
thing about in its cage. It was being kept in a small cage in the kitchen for
observation, as it was the only softbill chick to have been plucked. It was
devoid of feathers on the back of the head and breast and was the lone
survivor of a brood that had been choked with mealworm larvae. Out of
curiosity, a check was just in time to see a 10 cm (4 inches) rubber band
disappear down its throat. This was quickly and uneventfully retrieved
with tweezers before it all went into the stomach.

Feeding
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.998824" page_id="56284672"  page_num="246" year="" vol="">
Livefood forms a large part of the diet and this is discussed later. Gib-
son feeds a basic diet of equal parts of chopped cooked chicken and
scrambled egg. Lewis and Oxley feed the home-made insectile mixture out-
lined by Oxley in the paper on his management techniques, published in
this issue, as well as raw beef. Woodley's basic diet is Stimulite No. 1
insectile mixture, small amounts of grated cheese and occasional items of
fruit in the form of soft apples and peeled dried grapes. Dr. Lai writes of
his dry food as follows: "My mixture is made in the proportion of 3 kilos
of toasted ground nuts, mixed with 300 grams of ground shrimps, mixed
with six to eight whole eggs, depending on the size. Some 100 grams of
sugar is added to the egg before being mixed. This mixture is dried in the

sun on top of old newspaper or absorbent white paper so that most of the
oil from the nuts is removed. It takes about three or four days for the
mixture to be ready. During the drying process, the mixture is toasted
once or twice to make sure that any bacteria are killed. When ready, the
mixture is kept in small packets together with some drying agents. Prior to
use, some vitamin-mineral powder is added. As I use prenatal capsules for
pregnant mothers in my practice, I find it is equally good for the birds.
When feeding the newly hatched I use a more liquid mixture consisting of
bean curd with a lot of egg yolk, fully boiled. Some ground shrimp is also
added. The mixture is to provide extra liquid for the young as the heat in
the tropics causes a lot of water loss."
Gibson's birds took any kind of live food, except slugs, and had the
habit of eating the tiniest ants and flies that were too small for little
waxbills to bother with. Sham as were the only birds of his to patiently
eat enough fruit flies to fill themselves. One bird, a hen, which he watched
in the wild on the Hawaiian island of Maui during the mango season,
hawked the myriads of fruit flies that gathered over the rotting fruit that
carpeted the ground. These she took one at a time by jumping up in the air.
Although they will eat medium to small worms, the preferred food is a
crunchy chitinous insect. Speeding insects trigger a lightning response and
are usually snapped up in a split second. Mealworms are gulped down, but
eating is more leisurely when only a single bird is present. In a mixed aviary
the competition made the Shamas the fastest dispatchers of insects which
are given only a perfunctory squeeze and then swallowed. Assorted aquatic
creatures are eaten and Magpie Robins in particular loved small aquatic
pond snails. Shamas have a habit,, if they get the chance, of shaking cater-
pillars, etc., from rolled up leaves. They do this by banging the leaf about,
detaching it if necessary. This has been done by chicks only a month old.
The various authors give a wide range of live foods which must be given
in some quantity daily. Most varieties are accepted and the bulk seems to
be of the type which is most readily available in their areas. Lai feeds
chiefly grasshoppers and mealworms. Most authors use a commercially
produced live food of some type but Woodley did not feed maggots, other
authors did.
A consistent finding with Gibson is that cock Shamas always ate twice
as much as the hens except when the latter were laying. This is strange
because the male is not much bigger, being about 4-5 grrns heavier than the
hen. Males range from 24-35 grms and females about 24-32 grms. The
upper range is for birds kept outside; the subspecies vary quite a bit in size.

Newly imported birds are invariably thin, and those near 20 grms or under
have little chance of making it. In fact, choosing by weight is a good way
of picking birds that have a good chance of surviving. Magpie Robins are
slightly heavier, males being 30-38 grms and females 25-33 grms. They
also have a heavier beak and legs.
Housing
These birds can be managed in a relatively small area provided that they
have some cover. The size of aviaries given to their birds by the authors
varies considerably. Length ranged from 7 to 12 feet, width from 3 to
6 feet and height from 6 to 8 feet. A width of 3 feet may seem small but,
in fact, the pair of Magpie Robins housed in this flight, which was 12 feet
long, proved the most prolific breeders of any in the accounts. This partic-
ular pair, belonging to Woodley, also had the most privacy and protection -
a privet hedge ran along the side of one length and the side of the house
along the other. Flights in all cases were planted and Woodley's had a deep
leaf litter floor over a base of paving stones.
All provided shelter, either in the form of a covered portion of the
flight or an inside area of a shed. Gibson's aviary had the roof completely
covered.
These birds are fairly hardy - Woodley's Dhyals were over-wintered in
the atrocious weather of the 1981-82 winter and nested earlier the follow-
ing spring than in previous years, with the first egg being laid on 28th
April. Gibson's Shamas were miserable when cold, especially if windy and
wet, and they never nested before the weather warmed up in the summer.
Only Gibson mentions bathing facilities and he provided a dish on the
ground under a dripping tap but they did not bathe nearly as much as
some of his other softbills.

Sexing and Calls
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999622" page_id="56284674"  page_num="248" year="" vol="">
There is, of course, no problem in sexing these birds. The black of the
male is replaced by grey in the female. This is discernible when chicks have
moulted at 3 months. Males are fine singers, although the ability varies
considerably from one invididual to another. When singing, cock Shamas
sit bolt upright and fluff out the white patch on the back from between
the wings. They also use this patch in threat display, and in any other cir-
cumstances where they are highly excited. Magpie Robins do the same but
are not quite so obvious about it.
The saularis has less of a range but has a longer song than malabaricus

dawn and dusk. The female often repeats the same song, more especially
at dawn. Apart from song, the male has a wide repertoire which includes
all kinds of bird calls. It can even be taught to whistle simple tunes. Prac-
tically any noise, such as a vacuum cleaner, will trigger off a song, as will
simply whistling at a bird. They will also occasionally make other sounds
of a high pitched nature. A particular call is usually forgotten if it is not
heard for a while. Both male and female of each species utter a "chat"
when excited, which is usually accompanied by an upward jerk of the tail.

Display and Mating
</subsubsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.998539055555556" page_id="56284675"  page_num="249" year="" vol="">
Only Woodley gives notes on the display of the Dhyals. The male di-
played to the hen by settling alongside her, puffing out his breast feathers
and shimmering his wings rapidly in the half closed position, which dis-
played his white wing bars to the full extent. In early attempts at mating
when the female was not yet in condition, she would open her beak and
threaten him as he approached.
In Lai's hybrids, the female became domineering at mating time, to
the extent of chasing the cock when competing for food. The male sat on
a high branch prior to mating (hjs flight aviaries are a minimum of 7 feet
high for this reason), sitting very quietly with his feathers slightly puffed,
occasionally making clacking sounds when he did fly. He did not sing as
much as usual. On the four occasions when mating was observed, the male
flew from a height and on to the female below and mating took place. No
mention is made of a display.
Two other pairs of Dhyals with Woodley failed to breed despite having
almost identical conditions. This was attributed to two factors: incompat-
ibility and, in one pair, the male could see the "old hen" across the garden
and constantly sang and displayed to her.

Nests

A female Dhyal built a cup nest in the inside quarters which is attached
to an outside flight with Oxley but all other authors' birds built in a box
of some description. Two authors (Hervouet and Woodley) used budgeri-
gar nest boxes with enlarged entrance holes. Either cardboard or wooden
half-fronted boxes were the most common receptacles provided, the size
of which seemed unimportant. Those used by Gibson measured 6 V 2 x 6 Vi x
10 inches. The box used by Lai was not so simple - a wooden box with
wire mesh covering the top was placed into another metal frame with some
roof. The inner box could be removed for cleaning. He also used tree
trunks, bamboo and even old tin cans as possible nesting sites. A hollow

log was used by Lewis's Dhyals on several occasions. The height of nest
sites provided varied somewhat and does not seem to be critical.
Fine, dried grass was the most commonly used material for nest con-
struction with fine roots and horse hair also being used - the latter, how-
ever, was discontinued when problems arose of chicks either swallowing or
becoming entangled in it. Nests were lined with fine material. Construc-
tion, where noted, was mainly done by the hen, with only occasional
assistance by the male. One pair of Woodley's Dhyals took only three days
to complete a nest.
Eggs and incubation
Gibson's Shamas laid a great many eggs. They weighed about 2.75 grms
and ranged in size from 22-23 mm by 15-16.5 mm, with the average being
22.5 x 16.25 mm. The eggs are pale green and almost covered with dark
brown markings.Four was the normal clutch (Hervonet's pair laid three)
but one hen laid six eggs and fledged all the chicks. This was the only
departure from four out of the many clutches. Often the first clutch of
the season was clear, as the cock had not been introduced to the hen on
time, but invariably all others hatched.
Eggs are not always laid early in the morning. Sometimes one, especially
the last, is laid in the afternoon. The incubation time is 13 days but all
usually hatch on the same day, the normal pattern being two in the morn-
ing and two in the afternoon, so the fourth egg often hatches in 12 days.
Occasionally I have had the last egg hatch in 11 days. Times are, of course,
from when incubation commences, which is usually with the third egg.
Eggs were laid and incubated over a wide range of temperatures, but
the Shamas were invariably the last birds to nest, after the weather had
warmed up. The earliest clutch commenced on 19th April and the last on
22nd August. However, all nests were outside, none being in a conservatory
which was a little warmer. The breeding season in Canada lasts up to four
months but is usually only two, making it the shortest season by far of all
Gibson's birds.
Lai's hybrids usually laid three eggs and only once did a hen have a
clutch of four. While some clutches hatch on the same day, more often
they hatched on consecutive days after an incubation of 13 or 14 days.
The younger siblings from a staggered hatch usually died unless given

Dhyal clutches are either four or five and take 12 or 13 days to hatch.
Eggs are blue-grey or greenish, heavily marked with reddish spots and
squiggles and, although much rounder, had the appearance of a Rook's egg

and was not dissimilar to those of some Blackbirds.
The first clutch of five laid by Woodley's birds in 1980 had a protracted
hatching period - two on 23rd June, two on the following day and the
fifth at lunchtime on the 26th. Clutches laid in the following two seasons
were more synchronised.
The number of clutches per season obviously depends on a number of
circumstances being favourable at the right time and the success rate of
earlier broods. Woodley's original hen was on her third brood for the
season at the time of writing his notes (July 1982) and had reared eight
from the previous two broods.
Chicks
With the exception of Mousebirds, Gibson found Shamas the easiest
of his softbills to raise. This is due to the fact that they will eat just about
any kind of insect or invertebrate. They will eat small earthworms which
are easily obtained and the chicks seem to be much tougher than most

others. The first meal one of the broods got was a 2 inch ferocious looking
Violet Ground Beetle larva. The hen pecked it into the tiniest pieces
before feeding it to the chicks. During the first three days, Hervouet found
the best foods to be ant eggs or small moths from bee hives; often it was
possible to add maggots, earwigs and small crickets. When the birds are 10
days old, maggots and mealworms are accepted. Generally, most forms of
livefood are taken when rearing.
Both authors remove the cocks when chicks are due. Gibson, however,
replaces them once the young are a week old to help with the feeding.
Males are removed for three reasons: wanting to nest again when the
chicks are only a few days old, the serious risk of the cocks murdering
the chicks when quite small, and to conserve live food if stocks are in
short supply.
Gibson&amp;apos;s males fed little while the young were in the nest but fed them
regularly after they came out. The hen did nearly all the cleaning, eating
most of the faecal sacs meticulously, until the chicks left the nest.
The first clutch bred by Gibson - the one with six eggs - all had rickets.
Thereafter all chicks got supplemental hand-feeding. Chicks were simply
lifted out and stuffed with scrambled egg and margarine. The hen sat
nearby clucking her annoyance but always returned immediately to the
nest. This was overdone at first, at least four feeds being given a day.
The chicks were bulging when they left the nest and weighed up to 26.5
grms. This was almost the weight of the mother (29 grms). Later chicks
weighed 20-21 grms. Eyes opened at six days and fledging took place at
11-13 days, with an average of 12 days.
Chicks could fly immediately they left the nest and could manoeuvre
quite well. When they have left the nest, the chicks give a long musical
note to solicit food. Shama chicks are grey and reddish brown with lighter
spots on the back and wings. The tail is scarcely through when they leave
but grows fully in about a month. Within three days of leaving, chicks can
be seen to cock their stumpy tails, "chattering" all the while.
The parents often nest again when the chicks are about a month old,
but the latter are always removed at this age anyway as they are always
self-supporting. Chicks have often been seen to feed themselves at only 20
days, although of course the parents are still feeding them. One chick was
seen to bathe at 24 days old.
At about 50 days old, males begin to sing rather shakily while females
will give a shorter burst of song. They will also start to fight seriously at
this time and should be separated. This was not done with the first brood
and the male was killed at 55 days by his sister.

The chick's quills burst open at eight days and they begin to moult at
about three months, although there is quite a variation. One chick started
to moult in September at 15 weeks and another, from a later brood, at
63 days. Both chicks were kept indoors and one moulted in February,
while the other did not. The chick which moulted built a rather crude nest
in a box and laid two eggs, at one year old. She was egg-bound with the
second but it was passed in a heated cage set at 30*C, and she recovered
uneventfully. This was the only case of egg-binding encountered by Gib-
son in his softbills. A hen also nested when only 10 months old. Only one
chick reared in four seasons turned out to be a male.
The hybrid Shamas (White-crowned x White-rumped) when mature do
not have any white spot on the head, or only a few specks of white if
present at all. The reverse parentage throws offspring which seem to be
more variable, as some are completely black on the head, and one cock
showed a nearly complete white crown as in the Sabah species, and also
had quite a long tail which was not previously the case. Young from the
same pair can vary in their characteristics.
Woodley experienced little problem with rearing Magpie Robins. The
adults are marvellous feeders, the cock participating from the outset.
They took only live food which was to be expected. Items most favoured
were ants' eggs and chopped mealworms (whole mealworms after the first
few days). Various preparations were used as additives to the diet for the
first broods but later only powdered cuttlefish "bone" was sprinkled
over the mealworms.
The adults fed the young by standing in the entrance hole and reaching
downwards. A low clucking noise was uttered by the adults to urge the
young to gape. As they grew older other types of food were offered, in-
cluding small clean earthworms (which were never taken), together with
spiders, moths and centipedes, all of which were greatly relished. Woodlice
would be taken on occasions but generally they were totally disinterested
in them.
Before the nestlings feathered, they were jet black with a shiny polished
appearance. Feather growth was rapid after a week and by the eleventh
day they were well feathered. Fledging then took place within a day or
two. Upon leaving the nest, young were marked like the hen, with grey on
the head, back and tail and with white underparts. The breast was speckled.
In bright sunlight, the head, nape and back of some young have a dis-
tinctive charcoal greyish-black, as opposed to the battleship grey of the
others. The darker ones turned out to be males and the lighter ones females.
It is also noticeable that the young hens have a browner edge to their pri-

mary feathers. There is a definite tendency for males to outnumber females -
out of 27 reared in three years the ratio has been 17:10 (1980, 2:3; 1981,
7:3; 1982, 8:4). Three birds reared by Lewis in 1981 all proved to be
cocks. Two of three Dhyals reared by Gibson were females.
