REPORT OF THE COUNCIL FOR 1926
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.985912791666667" page_id="56220222"  page_num="" year="" vol="">
After the various anxieties of last year, caused by the amalgamation
with the Foreign Bird Club and the change of Editor and President,
the officers have been able to settle down to more or less routine work,
and the year 1926 may be said to have been the most successful since
the war. The Magazine has been brought out each month up to
time and the volume consists of 348 pages with nine coloured plates.
(The largest volume ever produced was in 1902-1903, when it consisted
of 410 pages and 12 coloured plates.)
Each month has brought us more and more members and the future
looks more hopeful than it has done for many a long day.
We would like to tender our best thanks to all those who have
contributed to the welfare of the Society To authors who have
helped to keep up the high standard of the Magazine. To donors to
the illustration and general funds, for without their kind help we
could not have all the coloured plates that go to make the Magazine
so attractive. Especially we should like to thank Mr. Ezra for the
plate of the Blue Alexandrine Parrakeet, Capt. Stokes for the plate
of the Grey-winged Trumpeter and the Princess Stephanie's Bird of
Paradise, and Mr. Whitley for the plate of Whitley's Conure.
We again have to thank Miss Chawner for her valuable help in
translating French articles and we owe much to the untiring efforts
of our editor, Mr. Seth-Smith, who, in spite of his busy life, is able
to devote himself to the editing of what is now a first-class magazine.
(Signed for the Council)

The Medal may be awarded at the discretion of the Committee to any
Member who shall succeed in breeding, in the United Kingdom, any species of
bird which shall not be known to have been previously bred in captivity in Great
Britain or Ireland. Any Member wishing to obtain the Medal must send a detailed
account for publication in the Magazine within about eight weeks from the date
of hatching of the young, and furnish such evidence of the facts as the Executive
Committee may require. The Medal will be awarded only in cases where the
young shall live to be old enough to feed themselves, and to be wholly independent
of their parents.
The account of the breeding must be reasonably full so as to afford
instruction to our Members, and must appear in the Avicultural Magazine before it
is published or notified elsewhere. It should describe the plumage of the young,
and be of value as a permanent record of the nesting and general habits of the species.
These points will have great weight when the question of awarding the Medal
is under consideration.
In every case the decision of the Committee shall be final.
The Medal will be forwarded to each Member as soon after it shall have been
awarded as possible.
The Medal is struck in bronze (but the Committee reserve the right to issue
it in silver in very special cases) and measures 2 |inches in diameter. It bears on
the obverse a representation of two birds with a nest containing eggs, and the
words " The Avicultural Society--founded 1894 ". On the reverse is the following
inscription : " Awarded to [name of recipient ] for rearing the young of [name of
species ], a species not previously bred in captivity in the United Kingdom."
The Council has decided that from January, 1926, any Member of the Society
who succeeds in breeding any species of bird for the first time in Europe, shall receive
a special certificate in addition to the medal which is granted for the breeding of any
species for the first time in the British Isles.

THE GREY-WINGED TRUMPETER
[PSOPHIA CREPITANS)

<bodyText confidence="0.977458416666667" page_id="56220168"  page_num="1" year="" vol="">
By Captain S. Stokes, F.Z.S.
Of all the treasures sought out for us since the war in the vast
territories of South America, there can be no more charming birds as
pets than the Trumpeters. In pre-war days the arrival of a Trumpeter
was looked upon as an avicultural event, but lately, owing to the
breaking of fresh ground and the enterprise of our dealers and their
collectors, they arrive with fair frequency.
In the British Museum Hand List of Birds seven species of
Trumpeters are mentioned, namely P. crepitans, the Grey-winged
Trumpeter from British Guiana and Amazona, the subject of
Mr. Gronvold's excellent and very characteristic plate; P. leucoptera, the
White-winged Trumpeter from the Upper Amazons and Peru; P. viridis,
the Green-winged Trumpeter from the Amazons ; and P. obscura, the
Dusky Trumpeter from the same district, all of which have been
imported since the war. P. napensis from Ecuador, P. ochroptera from
Rio Negro and Amazona, and P. cautatrix from Bolivia, apparently
have not been imported.
They are all of about the same size, standing 18 to 20 inches high,
except the White-winged, which is rather larger, and all have a velvety
head and neck and some irridescence on the breast. William Beebe,
in that most fascinating book: Our Search for a Wilderness, says :
" These interesting birds have no near relations, but form a sub-order
by themselves. They run very swiftly but seldom use their wings,
and although they swim well rivers of any size are never crossed. Large

Captain S. Stokes--The Grey-winged Trumpeter
flocks are sometimes met with, but the birds travel more often in small
parties. They feed on the ground and roost in tall trees-. The voice
has many variations, but the sound from which the name is derived
is very loud and sonorous, and can be heard at a great distance."
The chief charm of Trumpeters, and a sine qua non in buying them,
is their absolute tameness, which enables them to be kept at liberty in
the garden during the day time ; and whereas other tame birds
mostly come to you for what they can get, a Trumpeter does so for the
mere love of human society. As long as there are people about to be
with he is happy. Individuals vary greatly in character; some are
frightened of strange dogs, others attack them without hesitation, but
usually they are friendly with the animals of the establishment. I have
three Trumpeters at Longdon, a true pair of Grey-winged and an odd
cock White-wing. They bestow their affections impartially on everyone,
but especially love visitors, and will rush up to ladies and children and
boom away in their mysterious Trumpeter voice.
They are into everything, and fear nothing ; sometimes they may
be found sharing the chauffeur's kitchen fire with the dogs and cats ;
they will help themselves to damson tart off the lunch table, they will
help wash a car or weed a rose-bed.
Owing to this extraordinary tractability, they are very commonly
domesticated and kept as pets by the Indians, and Mr. Chapman's
collector tells me that they take the eggs and hatch and rear them under
hens, so it is probable that many of those we receive are domesticated
birds.
Information about their habits in a wild state is scanty, but Beebe
says " I made careful inquiry concerning the nesting of the Trumpeter.
So-called biographers have credited it with nesting on the ground
or in a hole high up a tree, pf laying from two to ten or more eggs, which
in the words of the describers are white, dirty white, or green."
But two Indians agreed in telling him that they nest high up and
lay four or five white eggs, and the colour of the egg is confirmed by
one laid last summer by a White-winged Trumpeter at the London Zoo.
As to their keeping, three-quarters of their charm is lost if they are
confined in aviaries, neither do I consider them suitable for a small
town garden, as birds of this size require a good deal of exercise. They

should be full winged if possible, as clipped feathers spoil their appear-
ance, for when excited and pleased they droop their wings and flirt
them forward over their backs.
It is advisable to shut them up at night, or they will attempt to
roost on the highest roof or tree they can find, and I make a rule to do
so when the gardeners and the bird attendant cease work for the
day, otherwise they are likely to stray in search of humans. They are
not habitual wanderers, but sometimes suddenly take it into their
heads to go off on an exploring expedition. One day mine crossed the
village green and all three appeared in the bar of the village " pub " !
They seem fairly hardy birds, and would probably do without heat
in the winter, but I give them a little for comfort and do not let them
out on frosty ground. Their feet are rather delicate, but a covering
of granulated peat moss on their shed floor keeps them healthy and
also acts as a deodorizer.
As staple food they get soaked and broken chicken biscuit, meat
meal, banana and any spare cooked vegetables daily, with an occasional
feed of raw meat, and of course they find a good deal of natural food
such as worms and slugs. They also like a dead mouse.
Sexual difference seems to consist of a shorter beak and less bold
head in the female, and in the case of the Grey-winged a deeper band of
sepia brown above the grey. My pair are very affectionate to one
another, and constantly call if separated for a few moments. It is to
be hoped that some lucky member may be successful in breeding them,
thereby furnishing valuable information to science and a Medal to
himself.

Smith's Helmet Shrike (Prionops talacoma ) is rather a rare bird in
Rhodesia, associating in small flocks of about a dozen and seldom being
seen more than once in the same place, roaming over the bush, veldt
in search of its food, which consists mainly of insects, etc.
At a distance it recalls a large Pied Flycatcher more than a Shrike,

Sydney Porter--Notes from Rhodesia
in colour it is an arrangement of black and white. The feathers of the
head are thick and bristly and form a kind of crest. The most noticeable
feature is the bright yellow iris of the eye; whether the brilliancy is
accentuated by the sombre surrounding colour I don't know, but it is
certainly the most brilliant eye I have ever seen in any bird; even the
eye of the Glossy Starling is paled into insignificance when compared
to it.
This bird is of rather a confiding nature and will allow of quite close
approach. It roams over the wooded veldt and bush veldt.
The lovely Black and Scarlet Weaver Bird (Pyromelana oryx)
is very common in Rhodesia, where it is known as the " Red Fink
It is rather unique that during the last few years this bird has changed
its nesting habits. Prior to the accidental introduction of the Mexican
marigold, the Scarlet Weaver always nested in the tall reeds by the sides
of ruins or pools, but now it invariably makes its nest in the marigolds
which cover nearly all the ant-hills in most districts in Rhodesia, and
the plants when dead give the country a most peculiar appearance.
Each clump of marigolds will be about 30 feet in circumference and
about 6 feet in height, and is populated by several pairs of birds. It is
usually stated that these birds are polygamous, but from my
observation they don't appear to be in the district where I was, though
of course I may be wrong, but there always seemed to be the same
number of cocks on each clump as there were inhabited nests.
The males are always very much in evidence, fussing about on the
topmost plants and every now and then bobbing up and down in the
air like black and scarlet balls of plush on elastic strings, all the time
giving vent with great gusto to their harsh rasping song and making
a peculiar clapping noise with their wings.
The males all seem to get on very amicably together, for I have never
seen them fight. If one approaches one of the nesting sites the excite-
ment becomes intense, the sombre-coloured females slip away as quietly
as possible, while the males all gather together from the surrounding
ant-hills, alighting on the nearest one, puffing out their feathers and
making a fearful hubbub and retiring to the next nearest ant-hill as
one approaches.

bird that I have ever seen, is pouch-shaped and is rather difficult to
describe. The entrance is at the side ; it is woven of the finest flowering
grass, the stalks only being used in the weaving, the heads being left
free inside, forming a soft downy lining. The walls of the nest are as
thin as a woven fabric and transparent, the bright blue eggs, usually
four to six, showing through. The nest is extremely strong, and it is
almost impossible to pull it to pieces ; there is always a loop of grass
coming from one side of the entrance hole and fastened to a grass stem
about 8 inches away. I cannot imagine what it is for unless to add
greater security to the nest in a storm ; in one case at least it would have
had disastrous results had I not passed by, for I found a young fully
fledged Weaver hanging in it in such a position that it would have been
impossible to free itself.
The young resemble their mother, who has the usual female Weaver
Bird colouring. The breeding season is in the late summer, e.g.
February to March; a few months later the birds seem to disappear
and no trace is seen of them until the following spring.
These birds do a great deal of good in feeding upon the seeds of
obnoxious weeds.
The smaller Black and Yellow Weaver Bird ( Pyromelana eapensis
minor) is not nearly so much in evidence as its scarlet congenor, neither
has it forsaken its old nesting haunts in the tall reeds by the river ;
I believe this species is polygamous, for I have never seen more than
one male in the breeding grounds of several females, nor is it of the
same noisy fussy disposition, but the habits of the two birds resemble
each other in most other ways, except that this one will approach the
environs of human habitations, which its scarlet cousin never does.
The hens of the two species resemble each other except that the
species under discussion is slightly more yellow.
There are many members of the beautiful family of Bee-eaters
found in Bhodesia, comprising the most lovely of African birds. It
has not been my luck to see more than four species, namely, the well-
known European Bee-eater (Merops apiaster), the Little Bee-eater
(Melittopkagus meridionalis), the White-fronted Bee-eater ( Melitto -
phagus bullockoides) , and the exquisite Carmine-throated Bee-eater
(Merops nubicoides).

Sydney Porter--Notes from Rhodesia
The European species, as everyone knows, is a migrant; it associates
in flocks, passing over the country in one place one day and another
the next, except when they are breeding.
It is a bird that never fails to attract attention owing to its brilliant
colouring.
A flock of these birds will arrive in a certain locality one day,
spending their time between sitting on one special tree and hawking
for winged insects in the same manner as a Swallow--in fact, their
South African name is the " Summer Swallow ". Their hunting,
nesting, and departure is very systematic. These birds nest in South
Africa, burrowing into a perpendicular bank to the depth of several
feet and then depositing their fine round glossy white eggs. I have
seen no evidence of their nesting in Rhodesia. They are very much
in evidence in the spring and late autumn, when large flocks pass over,
coming from Europe and then returning.
Sometimes in a flock of this species will be seen a solitary example
of the Carmine-throated Bee-eater, a wonderful bird whose prevailing
colour is a peculiar shade of carmine ; the head is pale green, the rump
and tail-coverts blue, also the under tail-coverts. The under parts
are a pinker shade of carmine, the two central tail-feathers are elongated
to about twice the length of the others, the end portion being narrow
and black in colour ; its habits are similar to those of the European
species, and although it is migratory it does not go to Europe.
The beautiful Little Bee-eater, so very common in Rhodesia, is
a resident, and is only half the size of the European. The prevailing
colour is rich glossy green above, the lores black, also the ear-coverts,
the eyebrows turquoise blue, the throat bright yellow bordered
by a line of sky blue, below that is a patch of black fading into rich
russet brown on the breast, the under parts being light yellowish
brown, the two central tail-feathers bluish green, and the rest light
brown bordered by a black band and tipped with white. The flight-
feathers are similarly coloured. The long curved bill is black and
also the tiny feet. It is about 7 inches in length, the tail taking up
nearly half that length.
It is a very confiding little bird and will allow a very close approach.
It will sit on some slender twig in a conspicuous position for hours,

sallying forth every few minutes to capture a winged insect as it passes;
if the insect is small there is a click of the beak, a movement of the
throat, and it is swallowed before the bird returns to its perch, but
if the capture is a large one, such as a beetle or butterfly, it will be
brought back to the post of vantage, battered, and knocked on the
twig until it is in a fit condition for swallowing. When the bird is
on the twig it is always in constant motion, the long tail being jerked
up and down and the head turned from side to side the whole time.
The Little Bee-eater frequents the wooded parts of rivers where
all manner of insects are abundant, upon which it feeds. Sometimes
I have seen it quite close to the homesteads, but one never sees it out
on the veldt or far from water.
It nests in the banks of rivers and streams in much the same way
as a Kingfisher.
One pair I had under observation had their nest only 18
inches above the water, with the consequence that the nest was flooded
with the first rain of the season and the young no doubt drowned.
The other Bee-eater is the White-fronted, another beautiful
creature, whose prevailing colours are green, scarlet, deep blue, white,
and yellowish brown. I have seen flocks of these birds by the Hunyani
Biver hawking insects over the water. Their call note exactly resembles
the croak of a frog. I believe they are residents.
The Black-capped Bulbul (Pycnonotus layardi) is always in evidence
around the homesteads ; cheery and confiding in its demeanour, it
is always welcomed by the bird-lover but, alas, not by the fruit-grower.
Its ringing notes are the first to be heard in the morning and they
somewhat resemble those of the English Blackbird, but its song is
not as continuous.
This Bulbul seems to keep in small family parties and appears
to never wander very far from its own particular area.
It is about 8 inches in length, the head-crest and throat black,
the under parts silky greyish white, the upper parts, wings, and tail
brownish grey, the under tail-coverts bright sulphur yellow.
The food consists principally of fruit, supplemented by insects.
The beautiful little Green White-eye (Zosterops virens) is fairly
common throughout the year in Rhodesia ; it is seen in small parties

in the wooded parts and around kopjes during the summer, but in
the winter it associates in flocks and haunts the environs of the home-
steads, partly to feed upon the fruit; it is especially partial to guavas
and a fruit which is called a mulberry, but is quite unlike the English
mulberry, and it also feeds upon the insects which infest the cultivated
plants. I have watched them feed upon the " scale " insects which
infest the citron-trees and which are a great pest to fruit-growers.
The White-eyes are said to feed upon the nectar of flowers, but I have
never seen this species doing so.
The very embodiment of energy, the Green White-eye is never
for a moment still; consorting in small flocks, they make a systematic
search of the fruit-trees, passing from one to another during the whole
of the day.
These little birds, which seem to resemble both the Tits and the
Warblers, are of a beautiful pale yellowish green colour, lighter below
than above; the throat is a pale sulphur yellow. Around the eye
is the characteristic ring of white.
I have seen some examples with a rich orange-coloured throat,
but whether this is merely a variation from the true type or a different
species I don't know. I believe that this species has been bred in
captivity in England.
The Verreaux's Glossy Starling (Pholidauges verreauxi) is one of
the most beautiful of the Starling tribe, if not the most beautiful; its
beauty is of a simpler kind to that of the Boilers or other gaudy birds
of many colours. The whole upper parts, including the wings and
tail, also the throat, are glittering metallic red, the under parts white.
In stuffed skins the colours fade to a dull amethyst red, hence the
name Amethyst Starling, but in the living bird there is no trace of
that colour.
It is a wonderful sight to see a flock of these birds feeding upon
the mulberry-trees in the bright sunshine, their plumage glistening
and flashing in the sun. The flocks are usually composed either
entirely of males or females, but in the spring and summer the flocks
break up and the birds pair off for the nesting season and distribute
themselves all over the country. The nest is built in a hole in a tree,
usually in a dead one.

The female is quite unlike the male, being of a brownish colour,
the underneath being creamy white streaked with brown ; she rather
resembles a Thrush.
In the breeding season they are rather shy and difficult to approach,
but this is not so in the winter time.
Other species of Glossy Starlings are extremely numerous in
Rhodesia, moving about the country in vast flocks after the breeding
season. The Lesser Red-shouldered Glossy Starling (Lamprocolius
phcenicopterus bispecidaris) is the most familiar and is seen in flocks of
thousands at the end of the summer (March and April). In colour it
is brilliant oil green, the lores velvety black, the ear-coverts rich
purple, and the flanks greenish purple, the secondary and median wing-
coverts each tipped with a dark blue spot, the lesser wing-coverts
a mixture of brilliant bronzed purple-red, the under wing-coverts
bright purple, the beak and feet black, the iris brilliant yellow.
To see a flock of these birds turning and twisting in the brilliant
sunlight is a sight to be remembered ; one moment they appear black,
then, as the rays of light catch them at right-angles, their wonderful
colours are reflected with marvellous brilliance.
Once when staying with a friend I saw a sight that would bring
joy to any bird-lover ; not far from the house was a large ant-hill, and
on that particular evening the flying ants were coming out, and over
the nest was such a bevy of beauty that is seldom seen in a day's march.
Hundreds of Glossy Starlings of three or four kinds, several species
of Rollers, Bee-eaters, Shrikes, Swallows, Martins, Drongos, etc.,
all circling round together in a screaming flock, feeding upon the ants
as they flew into the air. Some time afterwards I saw a similar sight,
but in this case the birds were on the ground. The ants were a small
tree species and the flying queens were issuing from a small hole in
the ground at the base of a large M'harsh tree ; all round was a crowd
composed of hundreds of birds, Glossy Starlings predominating,
including many in the juvenile plumage of a mixture of cinnamon
brown and green ; the others consisted of White-crowned Bush Shrikes,
Bennet's Woodpeckers, Moselikatze's Rollers, Drongos and others that
I have forgotten. There was no squabbling or disturbances, the birds
came and took the insects in turn, for there were plenty to go round.

Sydney Porter--Notes from Rhodesia
The Pied Crow (Corvus scapulatus) is common and equally dis-
tributed over Bhodesia ; it frequents the cultivated lands and the
outskirts of the towns, evincing a partiality for garbage dumps and
such like places ; it is usually in evidence by the side of railway lines,
perching on the telegraph poles.
This bird is extremely garrulous and its raucous voice, which it
can inflect to a greater degree than most Crows, can be heard from
a great distance; on the wing this Crow seems especially loquacious.
The Pied Crow is seldom seen in flocks but in small parties of from
four to six. It is somewhat longer than the European Crow but is
the same glossy black colour with a broad white band across the breast
and white markings on the back.
The nest is built in a tall tree and is of the usual type. The food
consists of all manner of insects, carrion, frogs, lizards, etc.
The Black Crow (Corvus capensis) very much resembles the fore-
going in habits, etc., but in colour is wholly black. Both species do
a great deal of good owing to the fact that they consume large quantities
of obnoxious insects; they are experts in the art of digging for grubs
and often in a newly planted field their efforts are mistaken and they
are accused of taking the seed. The only time that they are trouble-
some is when the mealie cobs are getting ripe, then parties will invade
the lands and feed upon the milky grain, but that is small payment
for the beneficial work that they do at other times of the year, but
I am afraid very few people see this from a logical point of view and
many hundreds fall victims to the unenlightened gunner.
I had two nestling Black Crows given to me, a male and female,
which I reared upon a mixture of mealie meal, raw meat, milk, and eggs
that had been sat upon for a fortnight ! They throve apace and grew
into the most amusing pets I have ever had ; absolutely without fear,
they would follow at one's heels or perch on one's shoulder. Every
morning one of them, the hen, would come into my hut, hop on to the
bed and endeavour to pull the bed-clothes off, thinking no doubt
that humans should rise at the same time as the avian world.
They loathed the niggers and would go for them with beak and
claw. This was not because of any inborn aversion, but because
the niggers teased them.

They absolutely refused to sleep outside and would persist in
roosting on the highest point in any available bedroom, knocking
over bottles, flower vases, etc., and in that way becoming a nuisance,
so it was decided by the others (and, alas, I had to reluctantly agree)
that the Crows must be got rid of, so one day they were taken and
released some miles out on the veldt, but, alas, when passing the spot
where they were released some days after, their poor mangled bodies
were found, a mute testimony of the fate that had befallen them.
There was a very noticeable difference between the two birds,
both in disposition and size. The hen was much more inquisitive
and familiar than the cock ; she was also much slimmer, with a smaller
head and more tapering beak, and longer in the leg.

BUDGERIGARS AT LIBERTY

By the Marquess of Tavistock
Few foreign birds are more delightful at liberty than this common
little Parrakeet and, destructive as it is to growing shrubs in an aviary,
it has the recommendation, when free, of being innocuous to fruit,
buds, and blossom, and entirely blameless in its habits. Many attempts
have been made with Budgerigars at liberty, and nearly all have ended
in failure. Sometimes the birds have stayed fairly well at first and
have even bred, but on the approach of autumn their numbers have
dwindled and as winter advanced they have entirely disappeared.
After a number of unsuccessful ventures, however, I have at last
discovered the way to enjoy Budgerigars flying loose in one's garden
during five or six months of the year.
The first and, strange to say, about the most difficult step, is to
secure a stock of birds hardy enough to live and breed at liberty without
suffering from chills and egg-binding. You must buy from a real
outdoor-aviary where the inmates are used to sitting, at times, in
the rain. Budgerigars can be turned out after spending a few weeks
in their new home, but it is preferable to buy your birds in autumn
and keep them in an aviary until the leaves are getting thick on the
trees the following spring. By that time they will have grown

<bodyText confidence="0.998793166666667" page_id="56220181"  page_num="12" year="" vol="">
thoroughly used to their surroundings and the losses from straying
will be almost nil. It is not a bad plan to feed the birds during the
winter inside the aviary shelter and to teach them to go into the shelter
from the flight through a fairly small door not more than a foot square.
Before the Budgerigars are released an ample supply of artificial
nest-boxes should be fixed up in adjacent trees. These boxes should
be about 18 inches deep and made climbable inside by tacking a strip
of wire-netting from the entrance-hole to the bottom, which should
of course be concave. The entrance-hole should be 1J inches in
diameter with a strip of metal round the edge to prevent the birds
biting it larger and so allowing Starlings to take possession. Immediately
below the entrance there should be some small projection for the birds
to cling to, but apart from this, as little foothold as possible should
be provided for a climbing weasel, which can be a dangerous enemy
to sitting hens and their broods, and should be circumvented by a
little ingenuity in the construction and fixing of the nest. Budgerigars
take readily to an artificial box of an attractive pattern, i.e. nice
and deep with a small entrance-hole, and it is most undesirable for them
to start breeding in natural hollows where it is impossible to look in
and find out what is going on when the time comes for recapturing
the stock in autumn.
As soon as the spring foliage is sufficiently thick to afford some
protection from Owls, a piece of wire-netting should be taken off the
top of the aviary flight as nearly as possible above the hole leading
into the shelter where the food is kept. Hungry birds returning to the
top of the aviary after a fly in the garden are thus easily able to find
their way home again.
Directly the first broods of young are seen to be feeding themselves
they must be caught up and kept in an aviary until the following
spring, by which time they too will have grown attached to the place
and will settle down to breed. The juvenile Budgerigar is of a most
venturesome disposition. As soon as he can feed himself he is off to
see the world, and if you imagine that you can leave your youngsters
out until the winter catch-up, you will be grievously disappointed
and find nothing left but your original old birds diminished by such
casualties as the summer may have inflicted on them. There are two

ways of securing young Budgerigars. Either you can accustom
the adults to using a trap feeding-tray on which birds can be caught
by pulling a long string from behind a place of concealment (a good
pair of field-glasses enables one easily to distinguish birds in immature
plumage with their barred foreheads and duller markings), or it is
possible to capture young birds in the aviary flight by making the
opening in the top of the wire-netting comparatively small and putting
seed just below it as well as inside the shelter. Young and old birds
find their way in to feed, but the former do not readily find their way
out again the first time or two, and a person walking up can cover the
hole and secure them while they are flying round looking for the exit.
When captured they should be put, if possible, in a compartment of
the winter aviary, for if taken right away and wintered out of sight of
the garden which is to be their next summer's home they will behave
like freshly imported birds when let out in the spring and probably
stray and be lost. Young Budgerigars are rather delicate when first
caught up. They should be fed on soaked and not dry Canary seed
and be shut up in a snug shelter every night and on wet days. One
or two old birds in the same aviary help them to settle down and
not fret.
It is most important, not only in the case of Budgerigars but
with all perching birds kept at liberty, that they should have
undisturbed access to a constant supply of food. Letting the seed
run out or keeping the birds away from their food through people
working close to the aviary all day is a sure way of causing loss by
straying.
On 1st October all the nest-boxes should be examined. Any
containing eggs should be re-visited at night when the hen will be
sitting. The entrance-holes should first be quietly and quickly blocked
up and birds and nests taken down and put in a compartment of the
wintering aviary--the young birds' quarters will do. An especially
devoted mother will occasionally go on sitting and hatch and rear her
brood if the nest be fixed up in the aviary shelter, but as a rule the
hen will desert, in which case the eggs should be thrown away and the
nest fixed up in the tree where it was before. Some nests will probably
be found containing young birds. As soon as the youngest and last

of these broods have flown and been captured by the method already
described, another search should be made for hens with eggs, which
can be caught up at night, as already described. Then, when these
have been secured, all the old cocks and such hens as are neither sitting
nor feeding young can be trapped at their feeding-place by one of a
number of simple devices that anyone can contrive. There is, of
course, no objection to catching up at an earlier date cocks whose
mates have been made prisoners the first week of October, provided
they can be recognized with certainty and distinguished from the
fathers of families still in the nest. It is not desirable to leave one's
breeding Budgerigars out when the trees are getting bare of leaf, as
they more readily fall a prey to Owls and lack of cover makes them
restless and inclined to wander. No fear, however, need be entertained
of nesting pairs straying and getting shot earlier in the season. They
are excellent stayers then and never leave their owner's garden. On
fine mornings and evenings they may rise to a great height and fly
round and round as though preparing for a long journey, but a few
moments later they will swoop down again to the trees from which
they started and continue fussing and chattering round their nests.
These rules of management may sound elaborate, but they are
really very simple, and the slight amount of trouble is amply repaid
by the beauty of the lively little birds in a summer garden. Undoubtedly
the failure with Budgerigars at liberty in the past has been due to
four main causes :--(1) Delicate indoor-bred stock which, when they
vanish, are thought to have strayed or been killed, whereas in reality
they have just died of chills and egg-binding. (2) Eelease of birds not
thoroughly used to their surroundings. (3) Failure to catch up young
as soon as they feed themselves. (4) Attempt to winter adults at
liberty when there is insufficient cover and the weather is unfavourable
to moulting- and laying-birds.

SHORT-TAILED PARROTS
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.97826315625" page_id="56220184"  page_num="15" year="" vol="">
By E. Maud Knobel
Amongst a consignment of birds and mammals that came in to
Chapman's, 17 Tottenham Court Road, during November there were
three of the Short-tailed Parrots (Pachynus brachyurus). These little
Parrots are not often imported, and I only remember having seen
one once before, which was also at Chapman's and I believe w^ent
to the late Mrs. Dalton-Burgess; but I think I am right in saying that
Rogers, of Liverpool, has had them for sale from time to time, but
they are by no means common. These pretty little Parrots look
very much like Miniature Amazon Parrots, to which they are supposed
to be closely allied. They are about 8 inches in size and are green
all over with the exception of a red spot on the top of the shoulder
and a red band across the tail, which is extremely short. The wing-
feathers are green, but each feather is edged with a small border of
yellowish green. There was one male and two females, and according
to the British Museum Catalogue the sexes are alike, but I noticed
the male differed slightly in various ways. He had a few flicks of
reddish feathers down the breast, his beak was narrower and longer
than that of the females, both of which had broader beaks, and the
iris of the male, especially when dilated, went to a brilliant orange-
red whereas those of the females remained brown. He looked more
alert than either of the females and had more to say for himself,
whereas they were practically dumb. He looked as if he might have
become a talker if taken in hand. For their size the beak and mouth
is large, and on examining them more closely I discovered that they
have a tongue unlike that of any other Parrot. Instead of being round
it is flat and large, flesh-colour in appearance with a black edge. One
cannot help wondering what these small Parrots feed on in their wuld
state for they do not seem constructed to crack small seeds, but certain
it is that they belong to a genus entirely by themselves.
According to the British Museum Hand List this species occurs
in Upper Amazonia and Ecuador.

FOREIGN BIRDS AT PAIGNTON

<bodyText confidence="0.996754294117647" page_id="56220185"  page_num="16" year="" vol="">
The Paignton and District Fanciers' Association are to be heartily
congratulated upon the success of their show held on 24th and 25th
November, 1925. So far as foreign birds are concerned, surely never
before has such a choice array been seen at any provincial town.
Paignton and district is fast becoming famous as a centre of aviculture,
and it certainly has an advantage over the eastern and northern
districts in its milder climate.
Space will not permit of our giving here a systematic list of the
entries and awards. It must suffice if I mention that there were nineteen
classes for foreign birds alone, and an entry of no less than 155. The
condition of the birds was first-rate, and as for quality one has seldom
seen a rarer lot at any show ; in fact, there were here, in this com-
paratively small Devonshire town, many species that had never been
seen on the show-bench before. The fact that Mr. Herbert Whitley's
unsurpassed collection has its home within a short distance of the town
of Paignton of course accounts to a great extent for this, but he did not
by any means have it all to himself. The Marquess of Tavistock sent
a splendid team all the way from Havant, and thus we had the cream of
the two justly celebrated collections rivalling one another and helping
to form the finest provincial show of foreign birds that there has ever
been. Captain Rattigan sent a very nice collection of Grassfinches and
Waxbills, while Miss Blackburn, Mr. Longlands, Mr. Chudleigh, and
Mrs. Gaunter helped with their birds.
Perhaps the greatest rarity in the show was Lord Tavistock's fine
old Guilding's Amazon Parrot; while his two splendid Black Cockatoos
and Mr. Whitley's Spix Macaw and Dwarf and Citron-crested Cockatoos
formed a grand lot. Amongst the rare Parrakeets, Mr. Whitley showed
a most perfect Alexandra and a Stanley, while Lord Tavistock sent a
lovely pair of Malabars, a Yellow-bellied, and a Layard's. Mr. Whitley
exhibited a very perfect specimen of the Brown-necked Poeocephalus
and an equally good example of the extremely rare Pceocephalus ruji-
ventris, not to mention three female Eclectus of different species, one of
which was probably E. Cornelia. Among the rarer Grassfinches,
Mr. Whitley showed a first-rate pair of Pintail Nonpareils, while Captain

Rattigan showed a pair of Blue-faced Parrot-finches, the class also
containing a Parson-finch and a Sydney Waxbill, both uncommon
nowadays, not to mention several very good Gouldians. A very fine
pair of Dinemelli Weavers and an Allied Saltator must not be forgotten,
nor must I omit Mr. Whitley's Bengal Pitta, Amethyst Starling, and
Verditer Flycatcher, nor a very fine Glossy Starling with white eyes of
which I do not know the species.
The last class, which is for those that cannot find accommodation
elsewhere, is generally one of the best classes in a show of foreign birds,
and that at the Paignton show was no exception to the general rule,
every bird was worthy of a first prize, and the judging was no easy task ;
all belonged to Mr. Whitley. A perfect Abyssinian Roller; an equally
good Green Cassique (Ostinops viridis), a species never before shown,
though represented at the Zoological Gardens on rare occasions; a Black
Cuckoo, probably Crotophaga sulciroslris; a Violaceous Jay, a Beechey
Jay, a Piapec, a Piping Crow, and a Long-tailed Glossy Starling : a
wonderful collection.

A PAIR OF BULLFINCHES
By Catharine Currey.
They have lived with us for many years, and know their home so
well that they have flown about loose in the garden--with an orchard
adjoining, beloved of Bullies !--and have never failed to return to their
home, coming at my whistle. Every spring the hen lays eggs in a little
nest-basket in a sheltered comer of their cage, every year the eggs
are thrown out, I think by the hen, and broken, so they have no
progeny, bearing out what I have heard of them, that they never breed
in confinement. I do not suppose this applies to Bullfinches in a large
aviary. I have no feeling of regret when I remove the pretty blue
speckled eggs, as my object in bird-keeping has been limited to a study
of the bird itself, not the propagation of species.
In summer, and on fine days at other seasons, the little pair spend
their days in a roomy wire enclosure on the lawn, where there are
branches, turf underfoot, and a shallow flower-pot saucer to bathe in.
Here they fly and sing and hide among the branches, and bathe,

and no doubt imagine they are in the green wood, and at sunset they
go into their house-cage, which stands at the entrance to the enclosure,
where they roost for the night, and are taken into the house out of the way
of cats, rats, weasels, and other foes. Every morning they call to me
to put them out or, if the weather is very cold or foggy, to open their
cage door and let them loose in the room. In winter they only go out
for an hour or two in the sunshine to enjoy a good fly round and see
their wild brethren who come to call and flaunt their superior liberty.
When a wild Bullfinch comes to call and to flirt with my tame hen
it is most curious how cross she is afterwards with her mate and how
subdued he becomes. It is as if she said : " That one is handsomer than
you, and younger ! " But my little pair are very devoted, and if the
hen flies out of the room to hide, as is her wont, somewhere in the house
where she thinks she cannot be found, he calls for her with his most
plaintive little note. He is Very tame and comes on to the breakfast
table for brown bread-crumbs.
On their cage in a south window they have a large pine bough, on
which they spend their day nibbling the pine-needles, the turpentine
of which I think keeps away asthma and bronchial troubles, to which
birds are subject in winter. They know my voice, and go into their
house-cage at once when I bid them go to roost, for if they remain
loose when the lights come they get so dazzled and frightened that they
lose their way to their cage.
One afternoon lately I thought they were lost, for when daylight
began to decline, I could not find them on their branch, nor were they
in their cage. I searched for them everywhere and called, but there
was no answering whistle. I then proceeded to take the branch down
from the window, but no birds were to be seen on it, and before putting
it out of doors, I laid it on a stool, and it fell to the floor. Out flew the
Bullies unhurt, the hen straight into their cage, the cock to take his
evening flight before following her to roost. They must have been
hiding in the thickest cluster of pine-needles and clinging an very
tight ! The window they are in is often opened, but they never fly
out; their bough has a magic attraction for them !
They are charming pets and companions, and both sing sweet little
songs, almost exactly alike, the hen perhaps a trifle louder. But then
she is the master, a fact of which she is quite aware !

Mr. Walter Goodfellow, the well-known explorer and collector,
arrived in London on 19th November, 1925, from a collecting expedition
to New Guinea and brought with him a valuable lot of living birds,
mostly from South-East New Guinea, but a few collected in the Malay
States on his way home.
Amongst the collection were twenty-seven Birds of Paradise,
including Princess Stephanie's ( Astrarchia stephanice), Count Raggi's
(Paradisea raggiana), Lesser Superb (Lophorhina superha minor),
Lawe's Six-plumed ( Parotid sexpennis lawesi), Count Rudolph's
(Paradisornis rudolfi), Hunstein's Magnificent (Diphyllodes magnifica
hunsteini), and Manu codes (Phonygama jamesi and Manucodia atra).
Rare Doves included the Superb Fruit Pigeon ( Ptilopus superbus),
Black-capped Fruit Pigeon (P. melanocephala), Gestro Fruit Pigeons
(P. gestroi), Magnificent Fruit Pigeons (Megaloprepia magnifica), and
two species of Phlogoenas, P. rufigula and ? P. heccarii). Amongst the
Parrots were two Geoffroyus aruensis, a Stella Lorikeet ( Charmosyna
stellce ), some Mitchell's Lorikeets ( Trichoglossus mitchelli), and a Green-
winged King Parrakeet ( Aprosmictus chloropterus). The collection also
included a Blue-tailed Pitta ( Eucichla cyanura ), a very rare Barn Owl
{Tyto arfaki), a Sclater's Crowned Pigeon (Goura sclateri), and two
Black-headed Cat Birds ( Mlurcedus melanocephala).

A LIST OF COLOURED PLATES
Our member, Dr. E. Hopkinson, has spent a great part of his leave
at home during the past summer in preparing a complete list of all of
the coloured plates that have appeared in the Avicultural Magazine
since its commencement in 1894 to the end of 1925, and in Bird Notes
from its beginning (1901) to its termination. This list forms a most
valuable index to coloured figures of more than two hundred species of
birds, most of which have been drawn from life, and it will certainly
be of great value to aviculturists and ornithologists generally.
It has been decided to publish this as a separate pamphlet, which
we would advise our members to have bound at the end of the 1925

A SECOND EGG-TOOTH IN YOUNG PIGEONS
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.99306355" page_id="56220189"  page_num="20" year="" vol="">
Sir, -- I read with the greatest interest the remarks in the November
Magazine on a pair of young Red Mountain Doves in Mr. Whitley's
aviaries, as confirming and amplifying my observations made when
rearing the young of the Partridge Bronzewing Pigeon in 1908. It
will be remembered that I then recorded the presence of an egg-tooth
on both mandibles and that I remarked that while I was not aware
of any previous record of an egg-tooth on the lower mandible in any
bird, it was evidently not uncommon among the Pigeons as I had
also found it present in the newly-hatched young of the Brush Bronze-
wing and it was discernible in young Picui and Diamond Doves, but
that I had not found it in Columba or Turtur (Streptopelia). I did
not then enlarge on the subject (which will be found in Avicultural
Magazine, New Series, VI, pp 341-2,1908), as I had submitted a young
Partridge Bronzewing to Mr. Pycraft, who had promised to describe
the specimen, but I believe he never did so. I asked our members
to examine the newly-hatched young of any Doves or Pigeons they
might breed in their aviaries and to kindly report on this interesting
subject, and Mr. Whitlej^'s discoveries seems to be the first made
since.

of my small collection, having been in residence since 1912 or 1913.
I may say he has just about finished his moult, and looks good for
another few years. I bought him, apparently adult, from an Edinburgh
dealer sometime within the period mentioned. I was not then able
to identify the bird, but knew it was not a " Red-headed Finch " as
described. After a good many fruitless inquiries it was finally run
to earth in the pages of Butler's Foreign Birds for Cage and Aviary
(p. 110), and I was able to confirm the identification at the London
Zoo a year or two later. The colour arrangement is as described
by Mr. Shore-Baily, though I should have been inclined to describe
the body colour as rather a purple-brown or plum colour, while the
patches on the forehead, throat and rump seem scarcely so bright
as " brick-red ". In fact the name " blood-stained " seems pretty near
the mark. No doubt the tints vary considerably in captive birds.
Certainly the coloured areas of the specimen I saw in the Small Bird
House in the Zoo had faded to a brassy yellow, much as one some-
times sees in a caged Redpoll. I have always found this bird a most
interesting one, and in his younger days he had a fine exuberant gush
of ringing song--too ringing indeed on an early spring morning for
one whose bedroom window looked out on the top of the aviary !
He was very ardent and mercurial in temperament, and his jerky
attentions to any female passer-by were very amusing. I have never
seen a hen of this species, but we have had two different sorts of hybrids
from him at various times. The female parent of the first was a
Canary, and the occurrence was recorded in Bird Notes for 1913.
Unfortunately, from the hybrid-breeder's point of view, Canary crosses
were not eligible for a Medal! (Query : as all the more obvious
Canary crosses have now been obtained, would it not be encouraging
to award a Medal for a new one--assuming that this is not the rule
at present ?) The offspring, a cock, was exhibited at the L.C.B.A.
Show the same year, and was described in the December Bird
Notes. It is a very interesting fact that the Canary mother of this
bird was paired with a Twite, her family comprising four Twite hybrids
and the rara avis mentioned. There was absolutely no doubt about
this. The young bird was a Rosefinch to the life, in its long, Yorkshire
Canary build, its jerky movements, and its colour arrangement. The

red tints were, however, replaced by the yellow of the Canary. Though
unusual, it is not unprecedented, I believe, to obtain a clutch the eggs
of which have been fertilized by more than one male.
In subsequent years I have had hybrids from the Rosefinch and
Greenfinch hens on several occasions ; in fact I felt that I could always
get this cross by turning in a hen " Greenie Though it is some years
now since this happened, a pair of the offspring, a cock and a hen,
are still flying in the aviary. The cock has much of his father's ways
and song, and succeeded him as a disturber of the peace in the early
spring mornings, though the flight of years is toning down even his
exuberance ! So far as I can remember no record was made of this
breeding, as a Medal had been awarded a year or two previously to
a Foreign Bird Club member, a Mr. Wade, I believe, for a similar hybrid.
In his case I think the cross was got the other way about.
As to the breeding of the Rosefinches themselves, I fear Mr. Shore-
Baily is not after all the first in the field. According to Bird Notes
of June, 1914, Dr. Lovell Keays succeeded in breeding them. This
gentlemen had an interesting account of the birds in that Magazine
for June, 1915. There is also to be found in "' Records of Birds which
have been bred in Captivity ", by Dr. E. Hopkinson, which appeared
serially in the magazine, the following : 1st record, Teschemaker,
1910, F.B.C. Medal, B.N. 1910, 363. Zoo., 1912, 1913.
It appears this bird is the " House Finch " of the Americans. It
is described as very common in parts of the Western States, more
particularly southwards, and " exhibits a predilection for the neighbour-
hood of houses almost as strong as that of the English Sparrow. So
confiding has the bird become that it places its nest in any crack or
cranny ". It is rather curious that our rarity should rank as something
like a Sparrow in other parts of the world !

been accustomed, and which I regard as essential to the welfare of
this species, which does not usually survive many years in captivity.
The birds have been kept in a moveable aviary about 24 feet by 8 feet
by 8 feet. The flight consists of a rectangular enclosure of wire netting-
on a wooden framework, with a closed shelter shed, about 3 ft. 6 ins.
deep, from back to front, at one end. The aviary is moved on to fresh
turf once a year with the aid of wooden rollers.
The hen of this pair is tame, and nested in 1924 and last summer.
The cock is trained to fly at liberty out of the breeding season, and
return to a small aviary adjoining the hen's at night--a necessary
arrangement to prevent him from being devoured by owls. He never
goes any distance from home, so the risk of his being shot is very small.
He is not mischevious in the garden, and is extremely beautiful on
the wing, the Rock Peplar being unsurpassed by any bird I know for
grace and power when in flight.

HUMMING BIRDS
By J. Delacour
Humming Birds (Trochilidse) have always aroused more interest
</table>
<bodyText confidence="0.98811345" page_id="56220231"  page_num="" year="" vol="">
than any other family of birds, on account of their minute size, strange
shapes, sparkling colours, and humming flight, and to keep them alive
in confinement has been the dream of many amateurs, a dream usually
supposed to be impossible of fulfilment.
There is no need to insist on the general characteristics of the
family. Their tapering tongues adapted for suction, their excessively
sharp-pointed wings and tiny feet; their profile is familiar to everyone.
They have three toes all directed forward.
Humming Birds vary much in size ; if most of them are the
smallest of existing birds, scarcely larger than a hornet, others attain
a considerable size; the largest (Patagona gig as) has a wing 5 inches
long.
However it may be, the family is very homogeneous, not only in
appearance but in habits. All Humming Birds feed while on the
wing and visit the calices of flowers and leaves, where they find tiny
insects and nectar. Some are sedentary, others migratory, and in
summer they are found in the Far North. Some live on torrid plains,
some on the tops of mountains.
Humming Birds are purely American and are met with from Alaska
to Patagonia ; but they are most numerous in the tropics.

Aviculture
Old books and pamphlets mention Humming Birds in confinement
since the middle of the nineteenth century, and even before then ;
in his excellent book, Aviculture-Passeres, the Marquess de Brisay
entertains us with various attempts, some of which appear to have been
very successful. More recently Major A. Pam, in 1908, brought the
Zoological Gardens of London eighteen Humming Birds from Venezuela
which unfortunately did not survive ; only one (Lampornis prevosti)
held out for five weeks.
Several unsuccessful attempts were next made by German dealers,
and the only one which could be saved was one which Mr. A. Ezra
managed to keep alive. It was he, indeed, who, having first succeeded
in keeping Sugar Birds alive by giving them Mellin's Food, found
the same food made it possible to keep Humming Birds alive. The
first he tried, Ricordia ricordi from Cuba, lived several years, and in
such good condition that it was possible to exhibit it.
But it was the much-regretted Marquess de Segur who was the
first to try this method of feeding. He went to the Antilles and brought
back in March, 1914, fourteen Humming Birds, which he kept in perfect
health. In 1915 he received thirty more from Venezuela, and most
of them lived well.
In 1922 I brought from Guiana myself twenty-one Humming
Birds in perfect condition.
Here, briefly set forth, is what is required to procure Humming
Birds, keep them alive, and bring them over safe and sound.
My birds were all captured by means of a pea-shooter loaded with
a little ball of soft earth ; this hit the Humming Birds, which fell to
the ground stunned ; they were at once picked up and brought into
camp within two hours. They generally appeared to be lifeless.
Every Humming Bird had then to be held in the hand and its beak
plunged into a tepid mixture of Mellin's Food, sugar, honey, and milk
(fresh or condensed). It usually began to drink at once ; but some
were stubborn ; they were conquered by putting their beaks into my
mouth and breathing gently on them, then plunging them into the
mixture again. Should this not succeed there was another infallible
plan : to plunge the whole beak and nostrils into the liquid ; the bird
begins to suffocate, puts out its tongue, and having tasted the mixture,

</page>
<bodyText confidence="0.999660277777778" page_id="56220233"  page_num="27" year="" vol="">
willy nilly begins to drink greedily. Humming Birds are so gluttonous
that even when newly caught and held in the hand they will begin
to drink the delicious mixture as soon as they have tasted it.
The effect of this food on the Humming Birds is immediate ; one
moment the bird is apparently lifeless ; one swallow, and it flies
joyously about; but it weakens quite as rapidly, and must be taken
up again and fed every ten minutes until it is seen to feed itself.
This usually happens in from about four to six hours' time. Some
kinds and individuals are slower to settle down, and must sometimes
be forcibly fed for several days.
The manner of giving food is highly important, for, above all,
Humming Birds must not get any on their plumage as that is what
nearly always kills them ; the best feeding vessel therefore is a covered
one, with a hole in the lid ; the birds quickly discover and accustom
themselves to use it.
It is also absolutely necessary that their food should always be
perfectly fresh, and it must be changed as often as the temperature
makes it desirable, and, above all, be careful that the bird cannot
take even a taste of the mixture made the day before. The best way
of preventing this is to leave them in darkness until the fresh food has
been given them.
Humming Birds are so quarrelsome that it is impossible to keep
two in the same cage ; they must be kept singly from the moment
they are caught. But it is not necessary to give them a large cage, as
their way of flying enables them to take exercise while, so to speak,
remaining in one place. While travelling they do quite well in miniature
cages.
Humming Bird cages should be furnished with only one, or two
perches, so that they can fly without fraying their wings ; they should
be very slight. The floor should be covered with blotting paper. They
should be gently sprayed with water every day, or given a wetted plant
on which they can bathe. It is of the first importance that their plumage
should not get soiled, and if it does they must be carefully washed.
Lastly, they must have all the sun possible, and above all the
thermometer must never fall below 65* to 70* Fahr. : the best constant
temperature is from 70* to 80* Fahr.

Besides the cream prepared as we have indicated for Sugar Birds,
and to which a little powdered meat or " marmite " may he added,
it is a good plan to give Humming Birds of the Dronophilce tiny flies,
which are easily bred in a vessel containing potato and red wine.
Humming Birds can be successfully kept under these conditions;
some have even lived so for three years, which is at least as long as
they would have lived under normal conditions at liberty.
It is impossible to find out which species were formerly imported,
but the following seventeen can be given with certainty, which have
lived either in the Zoological Gardens of London or with the Marquess
de Segur, Mr. Ezra, or myself.
Campylopterus largipennis, a fairly large Humming Bird with a
long beak, coppery green above, grey below. I brought one back
from Guiana.
The Jacobine ( Florisuga mellivora), a very pretty bird, green above,
with white head and breast, a white band across the shoulders and
white abdomen. I brought two back from Guiana.
The Mauge ( Lampornis nigricollis), found from Panama to Brazil,
is coppery green above, black bordered with white and green underneath,
and a violet tail. It was imported by the Marquess de Segur and
Major Pam.
The Anais ( PetasopJiora iolata) has been exhibited at the London
Zoological Gardens ; it is rather large, green, with blue stripes on the
sides of the head and abdomen. It inhabits the Argentine Andes, and
Venezuela.
Lampornis prevosti, brought from Venezuela by Major Pam, is
distinguished from the above by having less black underneath.
The Grenat (Eulampis jugular is), from the Antilles, is velvety
black, with metallic red throat and breast; the wings and tail are
coppery green.
E. holosericeus, from the same Islands, is coppery green above,
golden green on throat and breast, which is edged with blue. The
abdomen is black.
Both these species were brought over by the Marquess de Segur,
and lived in France for a long time, especially the first-named.

of tropical America, is very small; it is brown, with a red mark on the
head and- another, orange yellow, on the throat and breast. Imported
by the Marquess de Segur.
The Crested Humming Bird ( Beliona exilis) was brought from the
Antilles with the two Eulampis ; it is a tiny black Humming Bird with
a green crest.
Ricordia ricordi, from Cuba, is rather small and has a rather long
beak ; it is golden green all over. Mr. Ezra kept it over two years.
The Fork-tailed Humming Bird (Thalumnia furcaia ). I brought
back eighteen specimens from Guiana, where it is very common. The
males are green with shoulders, breast, and abdomen purple-blue.
The females are grey with the back and wing coverts green.
Chrysuronia cenone , imported from Venezuela by Major Pam, is
green with blue head and neck, and shining golden coppery tail.
Chlorestes notatus, imported with the preceding, is coppery green
above, emerald green beneath with a blue chin and steel coloured tail.
Agyrtria milleri, sufficiently wide-spread between Colombia and
Brazil, is a little bird, green above, white beneath. A.fimbriata, slightly
larger, is entirely green, except that the lower abdomen and under-tail
coverts are white. Both species were imported by the Marquess de
Segur, and one A. fimbriata lived three years in France.
Saucerottea felides , imported by Major Pam and the Marquess de
Segur, is bronzy green above, reddish on the rump, brilliant green below.
It inhabits Venezuela.
The Topaz Humming Bird (Topaza pella) is probably the most
beautiful of all Humming Birds. It is large ; the male is splendid
metallic red with black head, golden-yellow throat surrounded by
black, and golden-green rump. The two median feathers of the tail
are green, the two next them black, prolonged, recurved, and crossed,
the others reddish. The females are golden green.
I brought a pair of this glorious Humming Bird back from Guiana.
Calypte helence , which the Marquess de Segur possessed, is a mite
from Cuba, the smallest bird known to exist; above it is steel blue,
head and throat bright metallic pink ; the feathers on the sides of
the throat very much developed, making a collarette. The body is
greyish white above.

NIGHTJARS
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.983758147058823" page_id="56220236"  page_num="30" year="" vol="">
By M. Legendre
The family of the Caprimulgidse includes birds which in their
shape and insectivorous habits approach the Swallows and Swifts,
and at the same time have some relation with nocturnal birds of prey ;
such as their crepuscular life, large eyes, and soft dark plumage, with
the same harmonies of colour. In size they vary from that of a Scops
to a Screech Owl. Like them they are thickly made ; sometimes they
have ugly faces with, in certain species, such as the Nyctihius of South
America, monstrous beaks recalling the cartilaginous jaws of a great
fish. They are found in fair numbers throughout the world.
Caprimulgus is the only genus which has European representatives.
It is the best-looking of the family, and its distinguishing marks are
a beak which is small but deeply split to beyond the eye and furnished
at the base with long stiff bristles. Its head is flat with very large
eyes, long pointed wings, a very long, slightly rounded tail, and
short tarsi.
The European Nightjar (Caprimulgus europceus ) in my opinion
has the most wonderful plumage of any bird, though, naturally, it has
no brilliant colours or metallic lustre. I speak of the arrangement,
the delicacy and harmony of its dark colouring, which ranges from
deep black to pearly grey passing through all shades of rust colour, and
not forgetting a few immaculate white spots which adorn the wings
and tail. Every long silky feather encloses a multitude of tiny black
spots over grey, or longitudinal black lines, or else a medley of shades
of reddish brown. The absence of all bright colouring is made up for
by a thousand delicate arabesques, and the whole of this silky vesture
is made to harmonize with the dusk.
The Nightjar, with its great eyes and large beak, has, through the
ages, been considered a singular bird. Accordingly, it has received
on all sides strange names, and at the same time remarkable stories
are told of it. First " Goat-sucker " because seeing it fly sometimes
of an evening close to flocks of goats or other cattle, with the intention
of securing the insects which they attract, it was supposed to have
the habit of sucking them. Also " Flying Toad ", because by some of

its calls and the shape of its beak it is supposed somewhat to resemble
that Batrachian.
This migratory bird comes to Europe about the middle of April.
It travels singly, and does not pair until some time after its arrival.
It lies hidden on the ground through the day in the middle of a bush,
or more often perched lengthways on a bough, from which habit it
has acquired the name of " Branch Chester ". Squatting motionless
on its tarsi with its dull mottled plumage it melts into the bough on
which it rests, a marvellous example of mimicry. As soon as the
evening comes it starts hunting and pursues all kinds of flying insects
after the manner of a Swallow, more particularly beetles and night-
flying moths. It flies somewhat rapidly, keeping its beak wide open.
The Nightjar nests on the ground in a large excavation under- the
shelter of a plant. It lays two or three eggs, which are white mottled
with pale brown. On the least disturbance the female moves its eggs
or its young to another spot.
The Nightjar leaves the country towards the beginning of September*
usually singly, as it came. This species is found throughout Europe
except in the extreme north (it is commoner in the south). It migrates
to all parts of Africa.
A sub-species (Caprimulgus e. meridionalis) is found in South Europe
and the Mediterranean islands. It is smaller than the above, and its
upper parts are lighter.
The Bed-necked Nightjar (Caprimulgus ruficollis) differs from the
European Nightjar chiefly by a white patch on the front of its neck,
and by a wide reddish band which surrounds the nape, goes down each
side of the neck, and spreads over the throat. It is a little larger, but
its habits and nidification are the same as with the other species. It
is found in South-West Europe and North-East Africa ; that is to say,
Spain, Portugal, South France, and Morocco. Further north (England)
it is an accidental visitor. It winters in the Sahara.
Another species (Caprimulgus cegyptius) is an accidental visitor to
Southern Europe. It is found in Asia as well as Egypt and Nubia.
The Nightjar is much easier to keep in captivity than is usually
supposed. It is not often found in collections because it is neither
brightly coloured nor lively, though I personally have always felt the

charm of its plumage. I have admired it at leisure, even under a
magnifying glass, when studying skins, and have always come to the
conclusion that the plainest and quietest dress has a beauty of its
own. I have successfully reared Nightjars twice in the country where
I could spare them a large aviary.
Though the Nightjar usually feeds while flying it will also take
food off the ground, and is easily accustomed to a food vessel. It
should have the usual insectivorous food with as many live insects
as possible, especially moths and butterflies during summer. In the
country nothing is easier than to find both these insects ; in a short
time on fine summer evenings one can catch them in quantity. For
the winter the bird requires warmth and food which is rich with
ephemera and dried flies. Its cage should be large with only a few
perches made from branches as thick as one's wrist with the bark left
on. Thus it can squat lengthways on them.
The birds which I twice reared from the nest became very confiding
*and would take food from the hand ; they were very gentle and
would allow themselves to be caressed, which was another point
of resemblance between them and the Scops. Like them, Nightjars
awake from their semi-sleep towards the close of day, when they
stretch their wings, hop about a little and go to their feeding vessels.
As the darkness increases these birds, which seemed so heavy stretched
along their perches, recover their agility and spirits and flit about their
aviary on their great wings, velvety and beautiful, like those of a large
nocturnal moth.
[We understand that the Nightjar has been bred successfully in
captivity in Berlin by Dr. Heinroth.-- Ed.]

Tlie Momotidse inhabit the forests of tropical America ; the genus
Momotus comprises about twenty species, all more or less alike.
Speaking generally, they are birds about the size of a Jay with long
notched beaks and large reddish-brown eyes ; their large heads are a
mixture of black and bright blue ; the upper back and under parts are
greenish-yellow more or less accentuated with two little metallic blue

are longer than the others, are terminated by paddles which are divided
from the remainder of the feathers by a length of bare quill; these are
produced by the breaking away of the barbs, after the growth of the
feathers, the bird itself assisting during preening operations.
The Common Motmot (Momotus momota) from Guiana and the
Amazon is most frequently imported ; it is reddish-green above. I have
often watched it in the Guiana forests, sometimes in pairs, sometimes *
in flocks. It prefers the lower branches and is not at all timid. When
it perches on a bough it incessantly utters the low cluck which is its
call, while j erking its long spathulated tail from right to left. This species
like the rest of the genus nests in holes in banks.
In a cage it is a charming bird, lively and intelligent, sometimes
it becomes spiteful through excessive familiarity ; it is better kept
singly, as it is rather noisy. I kept one for four years and it only died
then because my aviaries were destroyed during the war. Mr. Astley
had one ten years which then escaped. So it is evident that Motmots
live well in confinement; they are fed on insectivorous mixture,
mealworms, a few earthworms, and a little meat and cheese. The three
following species have been imported : M. lessoni , from Panama,
green beneath ; M. subrufescens , found from Panama to Brazil, russet
beneath ; M. swainsoni, which I brought back from Trinidad, chestnut
beneath. They all behave like the Common Motmot in confinement.
Here I will just mention the Todies (Todus), a little genus confined
to the great Antilles. They are very small long-beaked birds, having
rather short tails, and long thin tarsi; they are green above, yellow
beneath, with the throat and sides rose-coloured.

BEE-EATERS

In this genus {Merops), which is confined to the old world, we
find birds of gorgeous colouring. They possess the following
characteristics : medinm size, lengthy, pointed, and slightly curved
beak, short and weak tarsi, the middle toe is joined to the outer
one up to the second joint, and up to the first with the inner one,
the wings are long, rather narrow, tail long and rounded, with the two
middle feathers often prolonged beyond the others. The colouring
is bright and diverse and there is very little difference between the
sexes. These exceedingly peaceable and sociable birds have in some
measure the same conformation as the Swallows ; like them their
flight is sustained and easy, and they live on insects which they
generally take flying. They nest in flocks in holes dug in banks as do
Sand Martins.
As its name implies, the Bee-Eater lives chiefly on hymenopterous
insects, which it takes flying. Sometimes, if tired, it perches on a
projecting bough and waits for its prey to pass. There are tw T o
species of Bee-Eaters in Europe : Merops apiaster and Merops persicus,
the latter being very rare.
The Common Bee Eater (Merops apiaster) has the top of
the head, nape, and upper j part of the back chestnut red; the
lower back and rump yellowish-red. The throat is yellow,
encircled wfith a black collar, the rest of the under parts blue-green,
darker on the breast. The forehead is aquamarine, and a black stripe
extends from the beak to the parotid region. Olive-green wings with
the median feathers deep rust colour, and all the quills black tipped.
The tail is deeper green than the wings. Such is the costume of this
fine African bird which visits Europe some months in the year.
The Bee-Eater arrives in Europe towards the end of April or
beginning of May; it may then be seen in larger or smaller flocks
in the South of France, in the valleys on river banks, by lakes, and
sandy slopes. It occurs all along the Rhone, and over the Camargne.
The Bee-Eater nests in some places in the South, particularly in the
Department of Gard. It is an occasional visitor in the more central
parts.

Its nesting is similar to that of the Sand Martin. It prefers sandy
banks and cuttings above a watercourse, a cliff with earthy sides on
which its nails and beak can make some impression. It digs a gallery
of about 3 to 6 feet deep, this passage ending in a chamber
the level of which is decidedly higher than the entry. Some
observers assert that they have found a second chamber
behind the first one, and communicating with it by means of
a short passage. May this second chamber be intended for a refuge
from danger ? It lays from four to six pure white, lustrous eggs,
rounded, and measuring 25 by 20 mm. M. Heim de Balsac, in his
recent ornithological travels through the north of Italy, discovered
Bee-Eaters' nests tunnelled into the flat earth. As they could not find
banks the birds burrowed into the ground like rats (a fact likewise
observed in Spain by Dr. Bureau); M. Heim de Balsac discovered the
eggs at a depth of some 8 feet. After rearing their young the birds
flock again and wander until about September or October, when they
return to Africa.
The Persian Bee-Eater (Merops persicus) has its forehead adorned
with a little white band ; it is olive-green above, has a yellow throat
and light-green breast. A black stripe from the beak to the parotid
region; the wings are the same colour as the back, with the flights
tipped brownish, its tail is bluish green ; it is smaller than the other
species. It is found in East Africa and Asia to India. Pallas found its
nests in quantity on the steep banks of the Caspian Sea ; it appears
in Sicily and Italy, and is an accidental visitor north of the
Mediterranean. In 1882 two Bee-Eaters of this species were killed in
the Department of Herault.
The Bee-Eater, with its elegant shape and plumage adorned with
such beautiful colours, is one of the most beautiful of aviary birds.
But to domesticate an adult requires unlimited patience and most
attentive care before it will feed itself from its dish. It must be crammed
with all kinds of insects for a very long time, then with little pieces of
bullock's heart, which when they are a little tame the birds will accept
and catch on the wing. They will take many sorts of insects : bees,
wasps, cockroaches and grasshoppers ; they are particularly fond of
these last. M. Plocq even gave them cockchafers with the elytrse

removed. The artificial food should be the same as for a Hoopoe,
i.e. meat and mealworms. Naturally, they will accept all other insects
with pleasure.
It is much easier to rear the young from the nest, and I will refer
the reader to the article on rearing Hoopoes, for these two long-beaked
captives are similar in their habits and requirements. A young Bee-
Eater taken from the nest and hand-reared becomes very tame is not
at all timid, and willingly allo&amp;apos;ws itself to be handled. It likes to fly
gaily from one perch to another in a large aviary, come down to its
food vessel, take a mealworm or piece of meat, shake it vigorously in
its beak and swallow it. Then from time to time it sits motionless
on the perch for digestion's sake, and if the day's food has been rich
in insects it casts up a little pellet about the size of a pea and then
resumes its joyous activity.
This bird rarely drinks, and some fanciers will leave it without liquid
for a very long time ; this is not to be recommended, and it is not
much trouble to supply a little pan of water for the larger insectivorous
birds which are fed on meat. It is also well to teach them to take such
fruit as grapes, pears, melon, etc., fairly often ; these may be cut into
the same sized pieces as their other food.
Bee-Eaters will even enjoy greenstuff, for it must be borne in mind
that in a state of nature birds take foods which are unknown to us, and
which serve them as medicines.
Two exotic kinds of Bee-Eaters have once or twice been imported.
The Green Bee-Eater (M. orienlalis), which is to be found from North
Africa to Indo-China, is rather small, green, and has the top of the
head and neck coloured tawny brown, a bluish throat, a black line from
the beak to the cheeks and another on the breast.
The Australian Bee-Eater (M. ornatus), a larger bird, is green, having
the lower back and rump light blue, tail and wings deep blue, throat
yellow, edged with black at the base ; nape brownish yellow, cheeks
blue and black. A pair of these lived for a considerable time in the
London Zoological Gardens.
They should have the same treatment as the European species.

THE BIRDS AT FOXWARREN PARK
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.9769275" page_id="56220245"  page_num="37" year="" vol="">
By J. Delacour
Many of our members may have been surprised that no descriptions
of our present President's beautiful aviaries and enclosures have
appeared yet in the Magazine. The reason is that Mr. Alfred Ezra,
being continually building new ones and extending his collections, it is
rather a difficult task to give an account of them which will not be out
of date at the time it is published. These lines only endeavour to give
an idea of the birds in their surroundings as they were at Foxwarren
in the autumn of 1925.
Foxwarren Park is situated on the lovely Surrey Hills, and extends
over some 300 acres of sandy soil, very suitable for birds and mammals
on account of its dryness. Most of it is covered with woods and heather
with large meadows around. The view from the house is extensive
and very beautiful.
In the large and pretty garden surrounding the house a few birds
live at liberty. Demoiselle Cranes and Trumpeters of two species
(Grey-winged and Green-winged) add much to the charm of the scenery;
while some foreign Doves and Pigeons fly from tree to tree.
At a short distance, in a well-sheltered spot, a bird room has been
arranged in a small building, well lighted from the sides and roof and
heated by hot-water pipes. The room measures 32 by 16 feet. Along
three sides runs a table supporting cages of various styles and
dimensions, while a very pretty and light aviary, all built of wire and
iron (which used to be the home of many S unbirds and Humming Birds
in Mr. Ezra's London flat, some years ago), stands in the centre.
This aviary contains a fine series of birds : three Royal Starlings,
one pair of Swift Parrakeets, one Indian Pitta, one Yellow-fronted
Woodpecker ( Melanerpes flavifrons), two Black-headed Yellow Bulbuls,
and two White-shouldered Bush-chats (Thamnolcea cinnamomeiventris ).
The cages are inhabited by the following birds : three Sham as, one
Bakbakiii and one Black and Scarlet Shrikes (Laniarius atrococcineus),
one pair of Chestnut-bellied Niltava, three Golden-fronted Fruit-
suckers, three Robin Chats (Cossypha humeralis, C. caffra , C. bicolor ),
two Mocking-birds (Minins gilvus, M. modulator ), one white Blackbird,

one pair of Indian Mynahs, the male a wonderful mimic, and the female
an albino, three young Superb Starlings, born in the aviaries, and two
Avadavats, trained to sing tunes. The collection of Parrakeets is
most interesting ; there are wonderful Lutinos, three young Blossom-
heads, 10 Ping-neck, all with pink eyes ; one semi-lutino male Ping-
neck, of a pale yellowish-green ; one male Malabar ; one male Bayard's ;
two Long-tailed ; one Tabuan, and one Taviuni, one Pock Peplar, and
a pair of Eclectus (E. roratus).
Other Parrakeets are to be seen in a series of movable aviaries in
the park : Yellow-bellied, Pennant's, Stanley's, King, Barraband's, and
Crimson-winged, and above all, a wonderful pair of Alexandrines, the
male light-blue and the female pure yellow ; it is to be hoped that this
lovely couple of " sports " will soon rear young ones, some of them will
no doubt show most interesting variations ; blue varieties in Palceornis
Parrakeets are still rarer than yellow ones, and exceedingly beautiful.
At some distance from the Parrakeets' aviaries, a pair of Emus
inhabit an enclosure, as they proved very quarrelsome with other
birds and animals in the large enclosure, of which we shall now say
a word.
This enclosure consists of a stretch of hilly ground of some 16
acres, partly wooded and partly covered with heather, brush, and
grass, all surrounded by a high fence. This is made of iron posts and
strong wire netting of a narrower mesh at the lower part, 10 feet high
with 2 feet sunk in the ground, and a piece of netting overlapping
both sides at the top, so that it is perfectly safe from all escapes and
also from all intrusion of vermin. The enclosure contains several sheds
and a pool of water ; it is in view of the house, although the fence is
invisible, hidden as it is in a hollow in front, the whole effect being
extremely attractive. There live many mammals : Axis Deer, Black-
buck Antelopes, Red Kangaroos, Pock Damia, and common Wallabies.
Birds are represented by eight Sarus Cranes (four of which are full-
winged and live in a free state), seven Demoiselle, and four Black-
crowned Cranes ; some forty Chukar Partridges, Golden and Amherst
Pheasants, Monauls and Australian Brush Turkeys.
We now come to the aviaries proper, which have been built in an
open space, facing south and sheltered by a wood of young larch-

trees. The first group was built two years ago, and a second one has
just been added, which was almost completed at the time of my last
visit (October, 1925) but was not yet filled with birds. Others will be
added gradually for new birds, in particular, Pheasants.
The first group of aviaries, intended for small and medium-sized
birds, consists first of a building 80 feet long by 12 feet wide ; its height
is 12 ft. 6 in. in the centre and 9 feet on the sides. It is built of double
wood, with felt between to keep the warmth, the floor is of concrete
and the roof of wood, covered with ruberoid. There are large windows
on the roof and in front, giving plenty of light. It is heated throughout
by hot-water pipes and lit by electric globes. This house is divided
into nine compartments, each being 10 ft. 6 in. wide ; the first one is
used as a kitchen and a store for the bird keepers, while the other
eight constitute the shelters of the aviaries ; doors enable one to pass
from one to the other and also to the outdoor flights. The shelters are
furnished with branches and nests of different kinds, faggots fixed high
up, and tables for food.
The eight shelters correspond with eight outdoor aviaries, the
first one 21 feet by 17 ft. 6in., the other seven 10 ft. 6 in. by 17 ft. 6 in.;
those also communicate by doors with three large flights 42 feet by
31 ft. 6 in. Such an arrangement is very practical as it enables one
to let out into the large aviaries the inhabitants of any one of the three
small corresponding ones, or of all of them if necessary.
Those outdoor flights are built of raw larch trunks and covered
with very small mesh wire sunk deep in the ground so that intrusions
of mice or other pests are made impossible. A gravel path runs all
round, while the centre is grassy with trees and bushes here and there ;
perches and faggots are hung up in different places. The three large
flights have a roomy, concreted pool in the middle. The whole
arrangement is practical and convenient, and the birds form a great
attraction to the visitor. Seats are disposed all round the aviaries to
allow observation.
The second group, which has doubtless by now been completed,,
consists of three small aviaries with shelters and one large flight of
the same style and dimensions as those described above, with the
only exception that they are not heated. They are intended for hardier

Such was the Foxwarren bird collection just before I left for the
Far East, and readers will certainly excuse me for the roughness of
the above notes, written on board ship. Everybody knows that it is
quite a problem to do anything on an overcrowded ship, in the heat of
the tropics. Among the many boats that we have crossed in the Indian
Ocean must have been one on which Mr. W. Goodfellow, on his return
from New Guinea, was bringing wonderful birds for Mr. Ezra. How
I wish I could have seen them safely arrived at Foxwarren before my
departure ! But no doubt the Avicultural Magazine will bring me
news of my friend's ornithological treasures while I am collecting in
the Indo-Chinese jungle.

As this pretty little African Owl continues to figure occasionally
in dealers 5 lists I feel prompted by my success in keeping an individual
alive for over five years to send a few further notes, more especially
as I am inclined to believe that most, if not all, specimens that have
come into the hands of other aviculturists have failed to survive more
than a few months.
The Pearl-spotted Owlet, judging by my " Owlikins ", is not at all
hardy, and the early demise of others of his kind in this country may
have been due to their owners' failing to keep them sufficiently warm.

Although normally a healthy and lively little bird, Owlikins has several
times caught colds and chills, and only removal to the hospital hut--
that invaluable adjunct to a large collection of tropical birds--has
probably saved his life. According to my experience the Pearl-spotted
Owlet cannot be safely exposed to a lower temperature than
60* Fahrenheit, and draughts and sudden changes must be scrupulously
avoided. In the case of entiritis, loss of appetite and the usual symptoms
of bowel trouble are apparent. A more common and less serious form
of cold manifests itself in wheezing, and, if severe, in a dilation and
contraction of the eye. Heat, a temperature of 85*, is the only effective
remedy, it being impossible to give medicine to an owl owing to its
power of regurgitating any unpleasant-tasting substance it may be
forced to swallow. The food should consist of mice, sparrows, meal-
worms, cockroaches, and other insects, and must be given perfectly
fresh. Tainted meat is very injurious to owls, and the victim which
has been obliged by hunger to eat such food immediately loses its
appetite and drinks copiously. Owlikins baths occasionally, but only
when the temperature is high, and, unlike most birds, he is sublimely
indifferent to the dirtiness of his bath-water ! He is allowed out of
his cage daily for several hours' exercise in a small room. Owing to
the complete loss of his upper mandible he is somewhat handicapped
in feeding and playing, though not sufficiently so to prevent him
from killing and partly eating a Canary which happened to be in a cage
in a room into which he one da} 7 &amp;quot; escaped ! He has a less varied repertoire
of conversation than a Little Owl, and the only sounds I have heard
him utter are a gentle twittering cry when excited or alarmed and a
succession of plaintive, musical calls during the breeding season only.
The Pearl-spotted Owlet is not a bird I should recommend for a large
collection, where there is no special accommodation for its needs. As
a pet, however, it has some strong recommendations to counterbalance
its rather inconvenient sensitiveness to cold. It has the semi-diurnal
habits and much of the inquisitiveness, activity, and intelligence of
the Little Owl, which, when really tame, I consider unequalled among
birds as a companion. The markings of the Pearl-spotted Owlet's
plumage are very beautiful, and the tiny round face, alert yet solemn,
and capable of many changes of expression, is likely to win many hearts

for this most fascinating little elf. Adult birds can be tamed successfully,
although, naturally it needs some of the falconer's skill and patience
to do so, for they are very nervous.
One more word about food by way of conclusion : there is a wide-
spread belief among owners of birds of prey that a day's fast once a
week is beneficial, if not actually necessary. Without going so far as to
say that an occasional day on short commons will do an Owl any harm,
I have not the slightest hesitation in stating that far more Owls are
killed by under- than by over-feeding. I have never lost any kind
of Owl from over-fatness, even when the birds have been kept in rather
cramped quarters for an unlimited period with more food than they
could eat, but until I learned wisdom I more than once lost one from
the indirect results of giving too little food. Stint an Owl, even a very
little, especially during or after the moult and tuberculosis will take
advantage of his lowered vitality and speedily carry him off. Food
must not only be abundant, but natural, and, as I have already said,
quite fresh. Butcher's meat and fowls' heads of uncertain age are
a poor substitute for mice, insects, small birds, and, where large species
are catered for, rats and rabbits.
THE BIRDS AT LONGDON IN 19 C 25
By Captain H. S. Stokes
To justify my existence as an aviculturist and as a respite from
the feverish buying of almost any foreign bird that came new to me as
a beginner, I this year determined to thin out a few of the birds, make
up pairs of the favourite ones, and try to breed something. For real
pleasure, let me say, I still prefer an aviary full of beauty and fun and
life, and have devoted one--my largest--to this purpose. Here the odd
birds are kept, and the abiding joy of them shall be described later.
The remaining six aviaries in this range, smaller but of varying
size, were euphemistically dubbed breeding aviaries and pious hopes
expressed that they would justify their name. Alas, one's hopes are
seldom realized, and the unexpected usually happens. Next season,
we think, we shall profit by the mistakes of this one, yet there is always

so much to learn ; 1924 was hopelessly wet and cold for breeding,
1925 was gloriously fine, and we are told that many tropical birds will
not go to nest till the rains begin ! Out of twenty-two pairs of birds
put up only five young were reared, exclusive of Budgerigars.
To resume then : No. 1 aviary contained a few small Finches,
Diamond Doves, Lilac-crowned Fruit Pigeons, and Golden-eyed
Babblers. The Babblers were discovered eating the Diamond Doves&amp;apos;
eggs, and were hastily removed. A cock Cordon Bleu died on the
nest just as the eggs were due to hatch. The Lilac-crowns reared a
young one quite early in March and a second one in September, with
two more unsuccessful efforts in between. So I am now the proud
possessor of four aviary-bred Lilac-crowns, of which two are certainly
hens.
No. 2 aviary contained a cock and two hen Spreo superbus. To
these were added another pair to test their proclivities for colony
nesting. One of the new ones was immediately killed, and the other
barely tolerated. The three old ones reared between them one young
to the age of three weeks, when it died just ready to leave the nest,
presumably from a surfeit of mealworms. They all three stuffed the
poor thing with incredible quantities of all the live food I could supply
and from the continual clamouring I thought there must be at least
four babies to be fed. In this aviary also were four Tataupa Tinamous,
of which one hen, the largest bird, laid beautiful pink eggs, which
nobody sat on.
No. 3 had four Royal Starlings ( Cosmopsarus regius), probably
three cocks and one hen, who all looked perfectly lovely, but never
went near a nest box. However, they only arrived in April.
In No. 4 also some of the birds were certainly imported rather
late for breeding, and then had to be got into condition before being
turned out. Orange-headed Ground Thrushes built, but did not lay,
Mesias and Virginian Cardinals did nothing, Diamond Doves reared
two young, Giant Whydahs absolutely declined to look at one another
in spite of a patch of long grass grown for their special benefit. A pair
of Donaldson's Touracos were terribly wild at first, and probably
disturbed the other birds, but they have settled down nicely now and
feed one another. They have since been left in sole possession of this

aviary, and though it is an unheated one they are standing the cold
of late November very well, and are out for an airing even on the
coldest day.
No. 5 aviary had too many birds in it, and no results at all. Red-
eared Bulbuls, Golden-eyed Babblers, Crimson-crowned Weavers,
Lilac-crowned Fruit Pigeons (the hen perhaps not of breeding age),
Abyssinian Emerald-spotted Doves, and Black-breasted Colins. The
Colins went to nest under a tuft of grass and laid twenty eggs, and
as soon as the cock began to sit the hen died.
No. 6 contained Diamond Doves, again successful, and, to my
mind, the most charming of all the small Doves, Grey-tailed Fruit
Pigeons (Osmotreron griseicauda) from Java, beautiful stupid things,
and my beloved pair of Sibias. These did a great deal of love-making
and played about with bents and moss, but built no nest. Probably
the aviary was too low. A further indoor flight contained Blue
Budgerigars, which I put up for breeding in January, as the weather
was warm and the room well heated. One pair proved very prolific,
rearing thirteen young, of which the first two nests (five birds) were
all hens. The remaining two pairs reared only two between them, but
one of the hens was in a perpetual state of hideous moult, and now
threatens to be a dirty white colour instead of blue.
Parenthetically let me advise the giving of insectivorous food for
the rearing of young Blue Budgies. Mine have thriven amazingly on
it, and on leaving the nest are almost twice the size of the French
birds one sees in shops.
In the odd birds' aviary we have successfully moulted the Racquet-
tailed Drongo for the second time. But it is a long and difficult job,
and takes nearly three months to accomplish. One racquet was shed
quite six weeks before the other, and the flight feathers take a long
time to change. The trouble probably is that he is naturally purely
insectivorous, and is with difficulty provided with all the live food
necessary for a rapid moult. He makes up for it by occasionally
eating a Weaver or other small bird, but is a treasure for his extra-
ordinary powers of mimicry and beauty of song and comic ways.
A Senegal Touraco named Jacob fell sick, and astonished us by laying
an egg ! Such a bold, bad character we had thought must be a cock.

46 Captain H. S. Stokes--The Birds at Longdon in 1925
A second egg was laid sitting in a cigar box like any domestic pigeon,
with the Black-necked Grackle, devoted friend, standing on the edge
of it preening her feathers for her and me looking on below. So I
have hopes of making another story of this another year if she will
take to her new mate acquired with great trouble and a good deal of
cheek from kind forbearing friends.
At present the cock has rheumatism, and the hen bullies him
hopelessly, so they are separated for the winter--what lovely birds they
are ; tame and affectionate and beautiful, and flashing with green
and purple and crimson splendour as they leap through the air.
All sorts of other treasures inhabit this aviary : a Long-tailed
Roller, moulted now three times and not easy to manage at these
periods ; a Sun Bittern with a passion for Stickebacks (without their
spines); a Yellow-fronted Barbet (Cyanops flavifrons ), a tame amusing
glutton with an undying hatred for all other green birds. Robins,
various Thrushes, Tanagers, Hangnests, and Weavers add to the
throng, my only remaining Cayenne Crake, and a pair of Plumed
Ground Doves, which broadcast their eggs, but never sit.
Later arrivals among the birds include a pair of Crowned Lapwings
from South Africa, charming and tame, but already described in the
Magazine.
A pair of Flamingoes live on the stream immediately under my
bedroom window. They are turning pink, and look lovely among the
pink water lilies and pink and purple spiraeas and loose stripes on the
banks.
If you have a pond or stream nothing seems easier or more
picturesque to keep on it. Mine never leave the water, and require
nothing but soaked bread and wdieat and what they find for themselves.
Their skating walk, the endless curves and knots in which they tie
themselves, and the absurd angles of their legs are always a source
of wonder and amusement.

By the Marquess of Tavistock
Do you know X ? He is the malevolent demon who makes a
speciality of tormenting aviculturists. Have you a beloved pet,
unbeatable, perhaps, on the show bench, a bird with a constitution
of iron who never ruffles a feather when the thermometer drops
from 80* to freezing-point in the middle of the moult ? Then assuredly
X will invent some new and horrid ailment which will carry him off
in the pride of his health and vigour, while other birds of the same
species with not half his stamina and beauty flourish like green bay-
trees under the same conditions. Have you six cocks and only one
hen of a variety you delight in ? Then be sure that X will arrange
that the next fatal accident falls to the lot of the female and avoids
a male you could far better spare. Do you move heaven and earth
for years to secure a pair of some fearfully rare bird ? Be sure that
when at last you succeed, X will infect one of the pair with a lingering
and incurable ailment, on board ship, and it will arrive only to die by
inches before your eyes. Do you desire to breed a bird that with other
aviculturists is as prolific as a Budgerigar ? Then, for all the success
X will let you attain, you might as well be trying to breed the Cock-of-
the-rock ! As a general rule X gets things pretty much his own way,
however hard you strive against him. After all, you have only been
an aviculturist ten, twenty, or forty years, while he has been at his
game ever since he inspired a wild cat to eat the first Jungle-fowl
that the first pioneer of the poultry industry succeeded in taming.
In the matter of the Blue-wings, however, I am of opinion that,
on the whole, I am one up on X. This year my new aviaries were
for the first time more or less ready for this rare and lovely little Grass
Parrakeet, and I decided that I would breed Blue-wings. X made up
his mind that I should not breed Blue-wings. The battle began in
May, when my best pair of Blue-wings went to nest in a cage in the
dining room. The hen of this pair had laid the previous summer,
and the room was nice and warm, nevertheless X succeeded in playing
successfully his usual first card in a breeding episode by making the

hen egg-bound with her second egg. I moved her, cage and all, into
the hospital, where the heat enabled her to lay successfully. I kept
her there for about a week longer, at the end of which period, as she
appeared to have finished laying and to be sitting steadily, I put the
cage back where it was before. A day later the hen got egg-bound
again, and on looking into the box I found that this was only her third
egg ! X alone could induce a hen to arrange a space of a week between
the second and third egg of her clutch of four, but X, as you will be
aware, if you know him as well as I do, is a very resourceful individual.
This time the hen was very ill, and to my despair the almost unfailing
remedy of heat was unavailing and she sank and sank. In desperation
I tried a liberal application of olive oil, and to my surprise she rallied,
got stronger, and finally laid. Of course, after this I did not venture
to let her attempt any more eggs, so I removed the nest and gave the
unfinished clutch to a foster parent. X pointed out to the foster
parent that the eggs were smaller than her own and that she had better
eat them--which she promptly did. Thus ended the first round,
the honours being with X.
After having some fun with various newly-hatched broods, X
apparently departed at the end of June to visit the collections of other
aviculturists. During his absence three pairs of Blue-wings went to
nest, the last being the pair whose misadventures have been already
recorded. On his return (X is never away long, particularly during
the breeding season) he seemed annoyed at the turn events had taken
and proceeded to deal with the situation. His first step was to slaughter
the cock of the dining-room pair. He was a lovely little bird, the
largest and finest Blue-wing I have ever seen, and I had grown very
fond of him during the winter when he was in the house. The widow,
however, remained faithful to her nest in spite of her bereavement.
In due course all three hens hatched, and after a time a nice little
Blue-wing left one of the nests in the aviary shelter and a few days,
later ventured into the flight. It returned to the shelter of its own
accord during the afternoon, and fearful lest the precious baby should
catch a chill I decided to shut it in with its parents until the following
morning. Before driving in the old birds, I thought it would be wise
to replenish the food and water, and in order to do so unfastened a.

little side door very cautiously with my hand over the opening in case
the youngster were startled. At that moment X made a face at the
young Blue-wing from the opposite end of the shelter ; at least, I
suppose he did, for it came straight at my hand, squeezed through
my fingers, and was gone. My feelings can better be imagined than
described. What chance was there that I should ever recapture
alive a delicate nestling too young to feed itself, which had had but
a few hours to get an imperfect view of its surroundings ? In the case
of many Parrakeets the loud calls of the parents might attract the
wanderer, but the call of a Blue-wing is so feeble that it does not
carry 20 yards. Night fell without any further signs of the young
bird, and early next morning he was still missing. About eight o'clock,
however, to my great joy and surprise, the little Blue-wing alighted
on my aviary near me and wdth no difficulty found his way to his
parents, who fed him through the wire. At any rate, now he would
not stray, and if he escaped Owls and chills there should be a good
chance of recapturing him. All our efforts, however, that day were
fruitless and the evening set in wet. Next morning he again appeared
and by shutting up his parents and using an odd cock bird in a cage
as a decoy I was at length able to entice him into an aviary and return
him to his family none the worse for his adventures. His sister left
the nest soon after, and both have done extremely well and grown into
beautiful birds as big or bigger than their parents. For a time no
further complications arose, but one morning, to my disgust, I saw
that the widow was ill. Looking into her nest I saw three
nice babies of different sizes, one almost fledged, one partly fledged,
and one still quite tiny. What was to be done ? They seemed too
young to feed themselves and yet were too old to let me feed them.
I wondered if I could put them in the nest of the third pair if their
young were the same age, and with the help of the gardener I proceeded
to investigate. I was pulling out the sliding zinc tray of the shelter
in order to reach the nest when he called out to me, " One has fallen
down ! " and a moment later held up a tiny unfledged nestling (much
smaller than No. 3 of the other brood) who ought to have been in the
box for weeks longer. Evidently the accursed X had again been
busy, and I looked into to ascertain the full extent of the disaster.

50 Breeding Blue-winged Grass ParraJceets in spite of X
An even smaller chick lay on the sand below the box : it was quite
cold and almost lifeless : the box itself contained only a few addled
eggs. What had happened ? Had the old birds thrown them out in
order to nest again, or had they deserted them and had hunger forced
them to make a premature exit ? Instead of solving the problem
of the first three, it looked as though five babies were likely to come
to an untimely end. The elder chick of the two that had fallen out
proved to have a full crop, which did not look like desertion, so I
unfastened the nest box, made a slight alteration to render it more
difficult for the young to climb out, put it up again and put the young
Blue-wings inside, the warmth of my hands having somewhat revived
the smaller one. Then I shut the parents into the shelter and left
them for the day, hoping for the best and expecting the worst. Next
morning I looked into the nest again, thinking to find one corpse at
least, but I was agreeably surprised to find both young ones alive
and well. How or why such tiny nestlings climbed out of their box
remains a mystery. In due course both left the nest and at the time
of writing are strong and well. The father was a bird I bred some
years ago at Binstead, but in a fixed aviary he had always been
infertile.
The widow was not very weak when I took her in, but for a time
grew slowly worse and was quite unable to feed her family. I tried
hand feeding, but only the youngest would swallow anything and to
my sorrow I found him dead next morning. The eldest, under pressure
of starvation, began to eat soaked seed for himself on the second day
and just pulled through, but No. 2 was in a bad way, not only starving,
but suffering from bowel trouble and getting very weak. Desperate
measures had to be resorted to. If a Parrakeet is really ill it does
not do to be pedantic about natural food. Anything that you can
get down its throat that will nourish it is worth trying ; so in addition
to " Pinko " and " Yadil " as medicine, I started feeding the baby
on yolk of egg and mill^out of a fountain-pen filler. He showed the
most profound dislike both to the food and the method of its administra-
tion, but it kept him alive, and after a few days he actually grew
stronger, the bowel trouble abated, and finally he, too, began to eat
seed. He and his brother are naturally not so strong and well grown

as the other four, but they are alive and healthy and I am distinctly
proud of them. Even the old hen pulled through, apparently by the
use of " Yadil ", which, though believed by many to be a worthless
quack mixture, has apparently saved me more than one Blue-wing
when everything else has failed. But X had to have his final cut at
the unlucky family, for one day, when she was nearly well again,
a shaft of hot sunlight struck the hen through the hospital window,
and 1 found her suffering from sunstroke, an ailment to which Blue-
wings are rather prone. She is still alive and in the middle of a healthy
moult, but she cannot fly. Recovery from sunstroke is a very very
slow business, but I hope that in a year's time she may be well again..
It would be such a sell for old X !

The author of this book is a keen naturalist who has spent much
time during the past thirty-five years in studying the songs and call-
notes of British birds chiefly in Sussex, one of the best districts for
bird observation, with the result that he has now produced a book
that will be found both interesting and useful to the bird-lover who is
often very puzzled by the songs and notes he hears during his rambles.
The author deals fully with the motive of bird song, and points out that
although its chief objects are those of courtship and defiance, yet it
may often be attributed to pure joie de vivre. He gives descriptive
accounts of the songs and notes of one hundred and six species in the
order followed in the List of British Birds prepared by the Special
Committee of the British Ornithologists' Union, commencing with the
Crow and terminating with the Quail. Then we find tables giving
the period of the year during which the various species may be heard,
and lists of those species that sing while on the wing and on the ground,,
those that may be heard during the night, and so forth.

THE NYASA LOVEBIRD (AGAPORNIS LILIANPE)
On lltli February, 1926, arrived in London a consignment of several
hundred Lovebirds, which were thought at first to be Rosy-faced
Lovebirds (A. roseicollis). On their arrival Mr. Chapman's assistant
telephoned to me that the expected collection had arrived, but that
they did not seem to be Rosy-faces, and he was sending a pair to
me for identification. Having always been very interested in
the various species of Agapornis, I was excited at the prospect of
seeing in the flesh a new species of this interesting genus of
Parrakeets. I found without much difficulty that they belonged to a
species described by Shelley and figured by Keulemans in the Ibis
of 1894, and named after Miss Lilian Lutley Sclater. The species was
first noted in the district of the Upper Shire, Nyasaland, where it
was found by Sir John Kirk, who believed it to be Agapornis roseicollis.
In the Ibis for 1864, p. 329, he wrote : " Found in one spot, limited to
about twenty miles, on the Shire, between Nyasa and the rapids.
It was never seen elsewhere, but was found there on two occasions.
It is gregarious." Shelley quotes Mr. A. Whyte as follows : " Lovebirds,
from Fort Liwondi, Upper Shire river. Mr. Johnston procured several
of these Lovebirds from Mr. Whicker, the collector at Liwondi Station,
B.C.A. We had several of them for a considerable time in the aviary
at Zomba. My own became quite reconciled to confinement, and lived
for some time in a large compartment in harmony with Weaver-birds,

Grallinulas, Touracous, etc. Ultimately, however, the large-hilled
Porphyries resented their presence and ill-used them and finally killed
them. In its natural state this Lovebird is found in flocks on the wooded
hills on the east bank of the Upper Shire."
Writing of an ornithological expedition to the Zambesi River in
the Ibis for 1900, the late Captain Boyd Alexander remarks of
A. liliance : "We met with it first near Chicowa, again at Chishomba,
some thirty miles up the river, and lastly at Zumbo. This Parrakeet
frequented enclosed country overgrown with mimosa-bush in flocks
which sometimes numbered as many as twenty birds, the majority of
which were males.
" At Zumbo this species was fairly numerous within a small area
of country, outside of which it was not found. Throughout the day
small flocks would continually visit the water and travel back again,
the same way as they had come, to some thick retreat among the
undergrowth of acacia, and in their journey they were ever uttering
their rounds of cries, almost in unison, but so shrill that they almost
set one's teeth on edge.
" A half-cast at Matacania, just below Zumbo, had a number of
these Love-birds in an aviary. They did not seem to mind confinement."
This beautiful Lovebird may be described as about equal in size to
the West African Red-faced Lovebird. The head and throat are rosy,
brick-red, brighter on the forehead, the back of the head and hind
neck greenish yellow; the lower throat with a yellowish tinge. The
remainder of the plumage is bright grass-green, and the tail with the
inner webs of all but the central feathers red and banded with
blue and black in the method common to the genus. The bill is rosy red
and the naked skin surrounding the eyes pale grey.
Now that a beautiful species, quite new to aviculture, has arrived in
considerable numbers, it is to be hoped that aviculturists will preserve
it very carefully and do their best to breed it and retain it for many
years to come, without the necessity of further importations. It appears
to be a species with a somewhat limited range, and further wholesale
capture may seriously threaten its existence.

By G. H. Gurney
A very fine series of British Birds was staged at the great show
held at the Crystal Palace on 4th, 5th, 6th February.
Finch-like birds were well to the fore, there being something over
seventy Goldfinches exhibited, while the class for Bullfinches contained
sixty-one- specimens ; Greenfinches and Chaffinches were also well
represented, and the classes for Linnets, Bramblings, Redpolls, Siskins,
and Twites showed a fine series of each. The class for Hawfinches
contained seventeen birds, all very good, one being an exceptionally
pale-coloured specimen. Some nice Cirl Buntings were shown, and in
the same class a single, very fine male Black-headed Bunting. Twenty-
seven Yellcwhammers made a fine display, and in Class 142, Mr. D. A.
Macpherson's Corn Bunting rightly took first prise. In the class for
Pied and Albino birds were three or four very perfect entirely white
Sparrows, a beautiful Pied Chaffinch belonging to Mr. W. P. Bell, which
took second prize, and a nice silver Bullfinch; a very fine white Linnet,
the property of Mr. W. Duffin, must also be mentioned.
The insectivorous-feeding birds were a grand lot. In Class 144,
Mr. C. Tout secured premier honours with his really beautiful Nightingale,
while Mr. Madduck's Blackcap was second, though there were several
other Blackcaps nearly as good. Class 145 contained, amongst other
interesting birds, a beautiful pair of Long-tailed Tits shown together.
They were in perfect order, and belonged to Mr. W. Wolf, and took
first prize, second prize in this class being secured by Mr. Hellen's
Nuthatch, one of the best I have ever seen in captivity; this class
also contained a single Robin and several Crossbills. In the class
for Larks and Pipits the best bird was Mr. Fenton's Shore Lark,
though it was run very close by the Tree Pipit and Meadow Pipit, both
shown by Mr. Tout; the Shore Lark is a rarer bird.
I was surprised at the paucity of Skylarks shown, considering what
a very easy bird It is to keep alive in captivity.
In Class 147 all the birds were Interesting, and the first prize had
been awarded to Mr. Tout's faultless, and perfectly steady, Wryneck,

<bodyText confidence="0.966503" page_id="56220268"  page_num="56" year="" vol="">

Mr. G. Drowlev's Goldcrest gaining a second: this bird was nice and
tame, but a little rough ; the third prize was awarded to a good Tree
Creeper belonging to Mr. Gr. Rosser, while a specially sleek Black
Redstart only gained a fourth. The Class for Wagtails only contained
five birds, but these were all in perfect order, especially, I thought,
the Pied Wagtail, which took second prize, the others being Yellow
and Grey.
In the next class two Cornish Choughs were the most interesting
birds, both exceptionally fine, the specimen belonging to Mr. W. Topping,
which took first prize and medal, being a remarkably large bird,
perfectly steady, and in the most perfect condition, not a feather out
of place, and with a bloom on its plumage not often seen even in a wild
specimen; in this class also were a couple of exceptionally faultless
Magpies, and a nice Jay. In Class 150 Messrs. Nicholson's Waxwing
took a well-deserved first; all the Waxwings in this class appeared good,
but the winner was infinitely superior to any of the others, it was not
only perfect in every way, but was a fine large-sized bird of an exception-
ally deep rich colour. Other nice birds in this class were a very steady
Ring Ouzel, a Greater-spotted Woodpecker full of life and in good
feather, and a nice series of Redwings, Fieldfares, and Missel Thrushes.
A fine lot of Song Thrushes, Blackbirds, and Starlings filled Class 151.
I had not time to go properly through the hybrid sections, but
amongst the hybrids from two British Birds I noticed a Siskin-Linnet,
a Yellowhammer-Sparrow, and many of the commoner crosses.

By D. Seth-Smith
The foreign bird section was very well supported, and the twenty-
seven classes on the whole well filled. That foreign bird-keeping is
becoming more popular than ever, is shown by the greatly increasing
number of exhibitors.
In the class for Lories and Lorikeets, Miss D. G. Crossewell deserved
her first prize for a most perfect Musky Lorikeet. Mr. Whitley took
second prize with a pair of Red-collared Lorikeets, and fourth with a
good Black-capped Lory, while Mr. Frostick took third prize with a
fine pair of Yellow-backs.

Amongst the Lovebirds, etc., were no less than four pairs of
Abyssinian, a species practically unknown to aviculture a few years
ago. The best pair of these took the first prize for Mrs. Victor Cooper,
the second going to Mr. Whitley, for a good pair of Rosy-faced. Other
interesting exhibits were Lineolated, Tuipara, and Orange-flanked
Parrakeets.
In the class for Common Rosellas, Alexandrines, etc., a very perfect
Alexandrine shown by Mr. Jas. G. Adams took first prize, the class
being otherwise occupied by Rosellas, Cockatieis, and Ring-necks.
In the Conure class, Mr. Whitley took the first prize with a pair of
Red-headed Conures, and third with a bird that neither the judge nor
anyone else could identify. More will be heard about this bird in
the near future, but it is sufficient to merely state here the fact that,
although none of us knew it then, this was really the rarest bird in the
whole show !
Mr. Whitley again took first prize in the class for Kings, Crimson-
wings, Pennants, etc., with a splendid pair of Kings, Mr. Frostick
taking second with a good pair of Bauers, a pair of Pennants belonging
to Mr. Shipton coming third, and a very good Barnard, owned by
Mr. Whitley, fourth.
The class for all other Parrakeets was an extremely interesting
one, containing as it did the specimen judged to be the rarest bird
in the show, and exhibited by Mr. F. C. Hedges. This was a specimen
of Palceornis salvadorii or derbyana, for there is little doubt that these
two names refer to one and the same species, a very large moustached
Parrakeet with a delicate plum-coloured breast. These Parrakeets
are believed to inhabit Thibet, but the extent of their range is uncertain.
If there is any difference between salvadorii and derbyana , it is that the
former is a smaller race of the latter. In any case it is an extremely
rare bird.
The second prize in this class went to Mr. Whitley for a beautiful

perfect specimen of the same species ; while in the class for Cockatoos
and Macaws, Mr. Whitley's Hyacinthine was an easy first-prize winner,
Mr. Maxwell's Lears coming second, a hen Gang-gang belonging to
Mr. Hedges third, and Mr. Whitley's Citron-crest fourth.
In the " All other species of Parrots " class, Mr. Whitley took first
and second prizes with two hen Eclectus, both in beautiful condition,
Mr. C. T. Maxwell coming third with a very nice Hank-head, and
Mr. Hedges fourth with a Red-cap, a pair of which were also shown
by Mr. Whitley.
Quails and Doves. Mr. Whitley first with a fine pair of-Nicobars,
second with a perfect pair of Diamond Doves, and third with a pair
of Red Mountain Doves, bred at Paignton during 1925; while
Mr. Erostick took fourth prize with a pair of Painted Quails.
Space will not permit of my mentioning the individual exhibits in
the classes for Common Waxbills, Firefinches and Mannikins, all of
which were well filled, nor must I dwell upon the Grassfinch and
Bunting classes. In Class 194 Mr. Frostick's first-prize pair of Violet-
ears were in wonderful condition, and well deserved the first place in
a very strong class ; but I think Mr. Maxwell's pair of Parrot Finches
deserved more than the H.C. card which was all that they got.
The Versicolor Bunting is not as a rule an easy bird to keep in
first-rate condition, and Mr. Maxwell well deserved the first prize
obtained for his in Class 195, as did Mr. Frostick for his very perfect
Queen Whydah exhibited in the next class.
Amongst the Tanagers was a beautiful Tricolor, which obtained
first and special prizes in Class 198 ; Mr. Thurston's Superb, which
came next, being nearly as good.
The class for other Tanagers, Sunbirds and Sugar-birds, contained
a very perfect Mari qua Sunbird (first prize), shown by Mr. Maxwell,
a Yellow Tanager (second), and a very beautiful Pretri's Tanager (third),
belonging to Mr. John Frostick, while Mr. Maxwell obtained fourth
with a good Copper-headed or Black-backed Tanager.
In the class for Glossy Starlings, Mr. Maxwell obtained a first
prize with a good pair of Superb Spreos, while his Royal Starlings were
not in very good form, and only obtained V.H.C. Mr. Whitley took
second prize with a lovely cock Amethyst Starling, third with a very

Amongst the Crows, Jays, Toucans, etc., Mr. Whitley came first
with a beautiful Occipital Blue Pie, and third with a fine Aztec Jay,
while Mr. Frostick was second with a very fine Red-billed Toucan, and
Mr. Whitley fourth with a Green-billed Toucan.
Other species of Smaller Insectivorous birds contained several
gems, first of which came a very perfect .Lesser Niltava Flycatcher,
shown by Mr. Maxwell, who also took the third prize with a pair of the
very rare and curious Yuhinas, and fourth with a Blue-headed Bush
Chat, while the second prize went to a pair of Indian Zosterops, shown
by Mr. Frostick.
In the last class, which was for the larger insectivorous birds, not
previously classified, Mr. Whitley well deserved the first prize he
obtained for his magnificent Long-tailed Roller. Mr. Frostick came
second with a pair of Donaldson's Touracous, a species freely imported
recently, and third with a Golden-fronted Honeysucker, while
Mr. Whitley obtained fourth prize with a Blue Mocking Thrush.

One of the most beautiful places I visited in the Gulf States
(Gulf of Mexico) was Brackenridge Park, outside the city of San
Antonio, South-West Texas, a real bird sanctuary.
After my arrival, almost the first night, a " dinkum " moonlight
picnic was arranged in honour of the visitor from Europe.
We journeyed in automobiles to the park forest. At one part
seats and tables are provided and small portable iron fire-grates
with piles of cut wood are put there by Mexican labourers for the
use of visitors. While some of our party were cooking and preparing
supper, I went with my brother for a stroll by the riverside. The
water in the river and lagoons was a bright blue, and I saw for the
first time swarms of fireflies flitting among the foliage of many palm
and other trees, the drooping fan-like branches of which fringed
the river banks.

Like my first visit to a tropical forest, I shall not very soon forget
my first stroll by this river's bank. We saw a number of Darters
(Plotus anliinga), or Snake-birds as they are called, roosting on a dead
branch of a large tree. While crowding on this branch it broke,
and the birds were scattered, but soon flew up again and settled on
another branch for the night. They are never molested, so are
quite tame. While watching these curious birds a large river snake
swam across and overhead flocks of Turkey Buzzards were flying
to their roosting-places. We saw a number of birds, while new sights
and sounds met the travellers at every turn. The brilliant moon
came out in a southern sky, and the roaring of lions (caged lions)
the other side of the forest almost reminded one of Africa.
I visited this Park several times and found it a bird-lover's
paradise ; it is of vast extent, the greater part virgin forest and the
resort of many kinds of beautiful birds.
A part of this park was laid out in a very artistic way as a zoological
garden. The side of one of the hills had been cut away and the stone
quarried for building purposes, and this formed the background
of a number of cages, wired in front and the roofs thatched with
palm leaves. One of the most interesting of the cages was large
and contained about twenty American Hawk Owls, Eagle Owls,
Virginian Eagle Owls, and other large Owls, as well as a tame
Brazilian Caracara (Polyborus braziliensis), pure white, a most
beautiful bird. In other cages were lions, leopards, various kinds
of monkeys, wolves, and other kinds of animals. In another part
were several African Ostriches and cages with a large number of
Californian Quails, Bob-whites, Doves, Rails, and others.
One enclosure containing Pelicans was quite unique : a small
lake was covered over with strong wire-netting about 12 feet high ;
grape vines were growing on this wire-netting and more than two
hundred large bunches of black grapes were hanging over the Pelicans'
heads while swimming underneath. Grapes grow in abundance

always be found bathing at a small lagoon under some trees and
quite unable to fly.
This was an excellent place for bird observation, and I was never
tired of visiting it. One very pleasing sight I saw while standing
in the shade under a group of palm-trees : a hen Red-bird (Cardinal)
came very near and settled on the ground in the sun, being joined
very soon by three cock birds, looking very beautiful in their bright
red plumage as they hopped and toyed round the hen in the brilliant
sunshine. The friend who was with me seemed rather amused at
my showing such interest. In the park the Red-birds seemed almost
as plentiful as the domestic Sparrow at home.
At one part are some very charming sunken gardens, where flowers
of every description abounded, and I watched brilliant large butterflies
winging, their zigzag, flight, sometimes rising swiftly in a cloud and
chasing one another, their wings flashing like sunlit jewels under
a dazzling blue sky.
Some large plants were growing here with leaves large enough
to cover six people and locally called Elephant's Ears and with
crimson flowers, and beautiful water-lilies and bamboos 30 feet high
growing in the water. I shall hope to write later more fully of the
birds in this lovely tropical land.

Were my avicultural activities ever confined to one particular
bird I should without hesitation choose a cock Shama, as I consider
him unsurpassed by any cage-bird I have kept.
My present Shama was purchased from a well-known dealer
two years ago, and from his incessant song, powers as a mimic,
and his confiding, friendly antics he rapidly repaid his original cost
and more than earns his " daily bread 55 .
His song is worthy of careful notice and for ever interesting in
its variety, and from my own observation may be divided into three
parts, namely, call-notes, alarm-notes, and song proper, apparently
delivered in his joy of being alive and well cared for.

62 Wm. B. H. Bearby--Observations on a Pet Shama
The alarm notes one can associate with the spirit of combat
and are uttered on sight of a Starling, Thrush, or other likely rival.
Similar notes are also uttered on the appearance of a cat or other
prowler.
The call-note is apparently the natural call for a mate, and in
my case (not possessing a hen Shama) is uttered on the appearance of
a hen Blackbird or Thrush that comes within my captive Shama's
vision.
On such occasions his notes are sublime and he just bubbles
over with " soul music ", and under such conditions one wonders
where the volume of song comes from.
The song proper is rich and powerful and exceedingly varied.
It may commence with a set phrase repeated time and again, like
" What-oo-Willy What-oo-Willy What-appeeers-oo . .
repeated until one is weary of the monotony, when suddenly a change
comes with the trilling notes of Blackbird, Thrush, and other notes
all bursting together.
The annual appearance in spring of a particular Blackbird on
a particular tree just outside my window affords me a unique
opportunity of comparing his song with the song of my Shama.
The opening notes of the Blackbird are a challenge to my Shama,
who immediately bursts forth and who can, literally speaking, sing
the Blackbird off his feet.
There is nothing difficult about the keeping of a Shama, given
a roomy cage (24 inches by 18 inches by 24 inches at least), regular
feeding, and observing scrupulous cleanliness, and he should live
for years in perfect health.
I find a sheet of paper cut to fit the sand tray and lightly sprinkled
with fine earth and renewed daily is the best method of keeping
his cage sweet and clean. The earth should be occasionally varied
with fine gritty sand, as this sticks to a worm, snail, or other titbit,
and the small particles taken in this manner aid digestion. 1
Shamas are great bathers and in bright weather take to water
three or four times daily. Care should be taken to provide a bath at
\} It is doubtful whether the presence of grit with the food of soft-food eating
birds is not more harmful than beneficial.--E d.]

least 12 inches by 12 inches, as this lessens the possibility of their
breaking their 6-inch to 8-inch tails.
My staple diet is a well-known insectivorous food known as
" Mosquito " mixed fresh daily with either water, fresh milk, grated
carrot, or finely chopped lettuce.
Any garden grub, beetle, or small earthworm is a great titbit,
and should be used on freshly acquired birds as a means of taming.
During winter months, when garden grubs, etc., are scarce, one must
fall back on the humble mealworm, of which ten to fifteen daily are
apparently relished. These should be given by hand.
My Shama is so tame as to be often a nuisance, and follows me
about the house in the hope of getting some titbit and uttering a
very plaintive note of appeal that one finds difficult to resist.
He will share my meals with me from my plate and such things
as butter, cheese, and potatoes he gets a fair share of; he is
passionately fond of either cooked or raw meat, but this I allow him
very sparingly, and confine him to a piece about the size of a pea
once a week and raw for preference.
Being a most intelligent and confiding bird, a Shama can soon
be allowed his liberty indoors and accustomed to come at call. He
is most graceful in flight and an adept at " hawking " moths, house-
flies, gnats, etc., etc.
He is a bold, fearless pugnacious bird, and I should imagine never
associated with any birds less in size than himself and I can well
imagine him holding his own with many birds his superior in size.
Another interesting observation is that of his method of breaking
a very hard snail-shell to extract the contents. By arching his
neck he delivers a powerful blow on the shell against a stone or other
hard substance and thus quickly hammers his way to a meal.
I am in a position to procure at certain times of the year some
extra large tropical and semi-tropical spiders imported into
this country with bananas, and amongst these I have, more than once,
had specimens of bird-eating spiders measuring 4 inches to 6 inches
across, legs included. These I keep as a special treat for my Shama;
his method of attacking is to hover over the spider until it starts to run
and at the first favourable opportunity delivers one blow with his

powerful beak which puts the spider hors de combat ; he then proceeds
to enjoy a meal in a leisurely fashion off legs and all.
Another peculiarity I have not seen mentioned in articles on
Shamas is that all food offered is eaten, but that such things as small
bones, beetle-wings and cases, feather, skin of mealworms, and in
fact all food of an apparently indigestible nature is ejected in the
form of pellets.
I trust that these crude but first-hand notes will result in some
other aviculturist keeping at least one Shama, and I feel sure that
what extra trouble in cleaning and feeding is incurred will be hand-
somely repaid with an incessant song rendered by a real feathered pal.

in America by Toucans. Like these they are provided with enormous
beaks, which give them a very fantastic appearance, and with the
exception of the genus Bucorvus are adapted to an arboreal existence ;
they are fairly omnivorous, but prefer fruit and small vertebrate
animals. They can easily be distinguished from Toucans by their
short toes, three of which are directed forward, and by their always
more or less pointed curved beaks, generally adorned with a kind of
helmet. Their plumage is never brilliant, the colouring being a mingling
of brown, black, grey, russet, or white, sometimes relieved with yellow ;
the face is often bare and ornamented with bright colours or wattles.
They are all large birds, the smallest being about the size of a Crow,
the largest that of a Turkey.
Hornbills, with the exception of Bucorvus , inhabit forests and are
generally met with in pairs on large trees; the noise of their flight
is astonishing.
Their breeding habits are very peculiar ; they make their nests
in the hollows in trees, and the male walls up his mate with mud, only
leaving a hole large enough to feed her through, and bringing her food
all the time that she is incubating. Hornbills are found in the tropical
countries of Africa and Asia, the Philippines, and Oceania.

They do very well in confinement on a diet of cooked potato and
boiled rice, fruit, and meat, but on account of their size and the special
housing they require (particularly heat in winter for the most part)
they are rather birds for Zoological Gardens than for amateurs. Out
of about eighty existing species, twenty-three have lived in the London
Zoological Gardens, and we believe these are all that have been imported
into Europe. We give a list of these species, with descriptions :--\0x25A0

By J. Delacour and M. Legendre
Generally speaking Hoopoes are African birds. The type species
(Upupa epops ) visits Europe only to breed there ; and a sub-species
(U. epops indica) inhabits Asia. These birds are of medium size,
with curved beaks which are longer than the head ; they carry a crest
of two rows of feathers placed parallel. Their wings are of average
length, tail fairly long and square. They fly slowly with frequent and
regular wing strokes.
From the first of April this pretty visitor may be seen in France
along roads or in meadows, where it runs about gracefully, nodding
its head so as to display the beauty of its head-dress. It lives on insects,
chiefly beetles, worms, and flies, which it finds amongst the droppings
of cattle. It nests once a year, almost always in a hollow tree. When
the young are fledged the family still keeps together, and accordingly
companies of Hoopoes can be seen walking about a meadow or dusting
themselves in a sandy path. Towards the end of September, however,
they become scarce, for they do not wait for the nights to turn cold
before they return to the African sun.
The common Hoopoe is one of our prettiest birds with its russet
black and white plumage ; its fine fan-shaped crest adorning the
small delicate head, ending in a very slender curved beak. We will
therefore enlarge somewhat on its management, feeling sure that the
rearing of this much sought after bird can be successfully undertaken,
even by a novice if he will follow the directons given here.

long time, requires constant care, and gives little results; on the
other hand, to rear nestlings, at no matter what stage of their develop-
ment, is easy. The amateur must have patience, for some individuals
require cramming for a few days. We^have often hand-reared young
Hoopoes, and up to now have always succeeded, no matter whether
the birds were only a few days old or ready to leave the nest. There
is no need to give them an elaborate mixture ; we invariably reared
our broods on bullock's heart passed through a mincer, and an
insectivorous mixture.
Young Hoopoes must be fed every half-hour, giving them alternately
a ball of minced meat and a ball of insectivorous mixture. They
usually gape after the second or third day ; it is a good plan, as with
all other birds, to imitate their call. The food must be put well back
in the throat because a Hoopoe's tongue is small and not particularly
mobile, its beak is very delicate and care must be taken never to leave
any food sticking to the sides of the mouth. It is a good precaution
to wipe this with a damp rag.
Once the young Hoopoes have become sufficiently plump and eat
with good appetite, we come to the point of teaching them to feed
themselves. When at liberty the bird seizes its prey with its long beak,
beats it several times against the ground in order to kill it, or, in the
case of large insects, to detach the wings and legs, then tosses it into
the air and lets it fall into its throat. The small tongue presents no
obstacle.
Hoopoes must be taught to feed themselves. Caged or at liberty
in a room they are cheerful, active, and above all very tame (this
is a characteristic of the whole family). They continually tap the floor
with their beaks and ferret into every hole : instinct is at work, they
are looking for insects. From this moment they should be given only
bullock's heart cut up into little square pieces. Some authors, who
also recommend meat, advise cutting it into vermiform shape, but
I do not advise this, because, if the bird tosses up a piece, and it falls
across its beak, it cannot swallow it, and has to begin again. Before
cutting up the meat it is a good plan to let it lie in boiling water for a
few minutes ; bullock's heart, if completely raw, is apt to stick to the
beak, and is not easily dealt with.

A food vessel containing these scraps of meat should be placed
in the Hoopoe's cage, and they should be hand-fed from it, this is easily
done with the help of a little flat stick. The birds now require constant
attention ; throw them a few mealworms, they will rush at them, play
with them, kill them, and try to toss them up and swallow them. This
they will find difficult at first, and the worms will fall to the right
and left, but sooner or later they will get the knack of it. Some
individuals arrive at it almost immediately. Throw them scraps of
meat, and they will act in the same way.
When you feel quite sure that all have learnt to swallow mealworms
and meat, they need not be watched so closely ; mix the worms and
meat together, and then gradually diminish the worms, and leave
a longer time between meals.
Their staple food should be made up, according to our experience
and opinion, of bullock's heart cut up into little pieces. Besides this,
each bird should be given some mealworms or other insects every
day. For a change, and rather frequently, some chopped fruit, and
occasionally a very little bread and milk.
Do Hoopoes drink ? Opinions are much divided on this subject.
We are certain that they do, but not at all frequently. But in any case
under natural conditions Hoopoes probe in very damp spots whicli
would yield them such moisture as they need. In confinement they
should be given some moss and a little water in a deep vessel. The
birds will often probe there, and occasionally drink. We have never
known them to bathe ; but they enjoy rolling in the dust; in fact, this
is a favourite way of passing time and preserves the beauty of their
plumage.
In winter Hoopoes cannot stand either cold or too great heat; they
should be kept in a moderately heated place. Sudden changes of
temperature are particularly to be dreaded. If a Hoopoe is at liberty
in the house like a domestic animal, it must not be allowed to be too
close to the heating apparatus, because given too fierce heat its beak
will dry up, and sometimes the two mandibles remain permanently
apart. This has frequently been observed by different amateurs.
Hoopoes may live several years in confinement, as long as five and
six years are on record. I kept one three years; it died from an

accident, as is so often tlie case with birds which are allowed liberty.
They are quite ready to breed if given a hollow log to nest in, and if
given daily a sufficient quantity of insects on which to feed their young.
The exotic species of Hoopoes have never been imported; they
closely resemble the European bird. During the last two years,
however, a small number of the so-called Wood Hoopoe ( Irrisor)
have come over ; these are African birds which have long curved
beaks like Hoopoes.
They have no crest, their legs are short, and tails long and very
much graduated. At first they were classed in the same family as the
Hoopoes, but later on as distinct, but allied ; which last seems to us
to be correct.
Wood Hoopoes live in small flocks in the forests, climbing trees and
hunting insects in crevices of the bark; their call is somewhat
unpleasing, and they have a disagreeable odour. They nest in hollow
trees, and lay greenish-blue eggs.
They do well in confinement on insectivorous mixture, to which
should be added insects, bread, and milk, and a little meat; they are
also fond of fruit. They are much easier to feed than Hoopoes. They
are harmless in confinement, and we keep them in an inner aviary
together with Tanagers, Barbets, Fruitsuckers, etc. They appear
to be hardy.
Irrisor erythrachynchus, which is found from Senegal to Abyssinia,
has been imported ; it is a handsome bird, metallic-green and blue,
with purple lights ; the two long central feathers in the tail are entirely
steel-blue ; the others are spotted with white, as are the lesser wing
coverts; the beak and feet are red. Both sexes are alike, and young
birds which are most frequently imported are black with dark brown
beaks.
A very closely related species, 7. viridis , found in South and East
Africa, has been imported, and some specimens kept in the London
Zoological Gardens lived very well.

THE NESTING OF ORANGE-FLANKED
PARRAKEETS AND ABYSSINIAN LOVEBIRDS
By W. Lewis
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.99899825" page_id="56220283"  page_num="71" year="" vol="">
Having been asked by the Editor for further particulars of the
breeding of my Orange-flanked Parrakeets and Abyssinian Love-
birds, I would like to say that I consider a lot of my success has been
due to the fact that I have little time to watch my birds and only
see them in the morning for feeding and again in the evening ; the
rest of the day they are left alone.
The aviary in which these birds bred is 12 feet by 6 feet by 6 feet,
half covered, half open wire flight, the nest-boxes being husks,
log-nests, and box-nests, the latter being 10 inches square. The
occupants of this aviary last year were one pair of each Canary-
wings, Tuis, Tuiparas, Orange-flanks, Red-headed and Peach-
faced Lovebirds. The three last-named started visiting the nests
and sleeping in them from the end of May, two using boxes and the
Abyssinian taking to a large husk. None of them made any kind
of nest, although they made a nasty mess of any piece of wood they
could find including the frame of the aviary flight.
In the middle of June the Orange-flank hen kept to her nest,
so I concluded she was laying or sitting and left her alone. To my
great pleasure, on 14th August, a little head peeped out and by the
23rd I had got five fine young birds climbing about; but alas ! two
were killed by a Peach-face, and to avoid further trouble I removed
the three remaining young birds to a flight-cage indoors, where they
fed on canary millet and Quaker Oats.
With reference to colour of the young birds I did not notice much,
except that they were paler than the adults and had not their bluish
caps.
The Abyssinians took to a husk a little later in June and laid
four eggs, which they hatched, but only reared two young, which
were of the same colour as the hen when they left me three months
later for another home. The young of these birds were fed on
seed only by the parents and started eating seed for themselves
as soon as they left the nest, and would not look at Quaker Oats

( Continued from p. 11)
Two Drongos are found in Rhodesia, the Fork-tailed (Dicrurus afer)
and the Square-tailed Drongo (Dicrurus ludwigi). The latter was
extremely common in the district where I was living, principally
around the homesteads after the manner of the European Blackbird,
and although it is called the " Blackbird " by the Rhodesians, it in
no way resembles that bird.
It is about 8 inches long, and of a uniform glossy purplish-black
except the wings which are sooty black. The lower back feathers are
rather full, and cover the wings in repose, and are also peculiar to the
touch. The head feathers are slightly elongated, and form a semi-crest.
The tail is very slightly forked. The underside of the wings when the
bird is in flight has a peculiarly light appearance, though when the
wing is examined it appears to be a uniform dull black, but the webs
are of a very thin texture, and almost transparent, and the light
appearance may be accounted for by the light shining through as in
the Red-winged Starling.
The legs and beak are black. The female is of a duller brownish
shade.
The male has a song which he sings at dawn and even, which,
although it is impossible to call sweet, is by no means unpleasant.
I have never seen this species on the ground, though I have seen
it pick up terrestrial insects by flying low and hovering over the ground,
but usually they feed upon insects caught around the trees. The
flight is graceful, and is usually in a semi-circle from tree to tree,
though at times I have seen them perform aerial gymnastics above the
tall tree tops, but in general demeanour they resemble the Fly-catchers,
to which birds they are allied.
The nest is a very meagre affair, made of a little fibre and placed

at the end of an upright decaying tree stem, though they also make a
fragile saucer-shaped nest between the horizontal forked branches of
a tree. The eggs are two in number, and resemble a small European
Blackbird's egg, at least those do that I have seen, but I am told they
vary greatly in colour.
The young for the first week or more are extremely fat and ugly,
the skin being of a dull black colour with very little down, but when
they are feathered they resemble the female.
The Fork-tailed Drongo is very similar, rather longer in size and
with the tail very much forked, the central tail-feathers being about
two-thirds the length of the outer ones.
The beautiful little Paradise Fly-catcher (Terpsiphone perspicellata)
is also found around the homesteads, and also in the shady woodlands.
In colour it is steel-green upon the head and crest, the rest of the
body chestnut, except the under parts, which are slaty-grey.
The two central tail-feathers are enormously elongated, and are
about 11 inches in length. The beak and eyelids are cobalt-blue,
the legs greyish-blue.
The hen lacks the long tail and the dark green head, which is grey.
These fairy-like little birds live in pairs in the trees, sallying forth
at various intervals to capture insects on the wing.
They seem to come in the spring, and disappear at the end of the
summer, though I don't know for sure whether they are migratory.
The nest is a most beautiful structure, small and cup-shaped, and
placed on a twig or between a fork and covered with spiders' webs
and lichen.
The House Martin ( Chelidon urhica) and the European Swallow
(.Hirundo rustica) are exceedingly numerous during the summer, but
they disappear in the autumn, except a few of the Martins, which
remain all the year round. Their habits are the same as when they
are in Europe, except that they do not breed.
In flocks of the two former birds a few Rufous-breasted Swallows
(Hirundo semirufa) are often seen. These birds are larger than the
ordinary Swallow, and are of a glossy blue-black, the whole under parts
from the beak to the under tail-coverts and also the rump a deep
rufous. I have sometimes watched these birds bathe in the Umsururu

Kiver; suddenly flying down from out of a flock of other Swallows,
they will rush along the surface of the water for several yards, beating
up a spray with their wings, having a kind of shower bath. They repeat
this performance several times, then mount high into the air to dry
themselves. I have never seen the other Swallows bathe in this manner.
The South African Hoopoe (Upupa africana) rather resembles
its European congener, but is of a deeper brick-red colour. It is
found in the wooded parts in pairs or small parties. I have only seen
it in the summer, though I believe it is a resident. They do not seem
to be very common where I have been.
The nest is made in a hole of some sort, either in a bank or in a
decayed tree or a wall. The eggs when freshly laid are pale blue in
colour, but soon turn dirty white
The Wood Hoopoe (Irrisor viridis), or Kakelaar as it is called by the
Dutch, is a strange looking bird, and appears to have no affinity to
the true Hoopoes.
It is fairly common in Ehodesia, but is rather local. It is about
16 inches in length, the tail taking up 9, and the beak 2 inches.
The head and throat are dark metallic bluish-green, the mantle,
scapulars, and breast rich oil-green. The two long central tail feathers
rich purple, going into steel-blue at the end. The other feathers of the
tail, which is graduated, are steel-blue with two white spots, one on
each web near the tip. The wings are glossy dark purple, the primaries
having a white stripe across the middle, the primary coverts have the
basal half steel-blue and the other half white. The lower back and
lower parts underneath, black. The long curved bill and feet,
bright red.
The Wood Hoopoes associate in small parties of from about four
to six, and haunt the wooded parts by the rivers and streams, though
I have sometimes seen them right out on the veldt. They utter a
peculiar chattering cry as they fly from tree to tree. This cry is rather
like that of a monkey, in fact, they are called " monkey birds 55 by the
Rhodesians.
When disturbed the Wood Hoopoe flies on to the trunk of a tree
in the manner of a creeper and runs up the bark until it gets into the
branches, in fact its whole demeanour resembles that of a creeper, it

climbs about all over the trees, sometimes running upside down on
the under side of a branch, all the time making a systematic search
for the tiny insects upon which it feeds.
I have noticed that it is partial to dead lichen-covered trees, making
a minute examination of the lichen for insects.
I know nothing of their nesting habits, though I believe they nest
in holes in trees.
The Scimitar Bill (Rhinopomastus cyanomelas ) is very much like
the Wood Hoopoe, to whom it is closely allied, but it is much smaller
with the long curved beak and feet black; also its habits are
very similar.
Soon after my arrival in Rhodesia I was told about a bird called
the " Turkey Buzzard ", a large bird, some kind of a vulture with a red
beak; now, people knowing that I am interested in birds, describe all
kinds of weird and wonderful ones that they have seen, and in the days
when I did not know quite as much about human nature as I do now,
I replied that there were no such birds, only to be disdainfully told
that I knew nothing about birds ; now when one of these mythological
creatures are described, I say nothing, but as several people used to tell
me about the Turkey Buzzards, I began to think that there must be
something in it, but these large black vulture-like birds " that lived in
trees " remained a mystery until one day I was out with a friend, to
whom I pointed out a small party of Ground Hornbills (Bucorax caffer)
and asked him if he knew them. " Of course," replied my friend, " but
they're not Hornbills, they're Turkey Buzzards," and so the mystery
was solved.
These strange birds are distributed over Rhodesia in small numbers.
In the district where I lived there were two small parties consisting
of ten birds, five in each party, and in the one I had under observation
most of the time I was there, there were two hens and three cocks.
The Ground Hornbill is glossy black in colour, with the primary
wing feathers white, but this colour is only visible when the bird is in
flight, the peculiar raised and pouch-like skin of the face and throat
is bright scarlet, in the hen it is blue edged with red. The enormous
beak and legs black. The eyelids have remarkable long curved eye-
lashes, which give the eye a peculiarly soft gentle expression.

Sydney Porter--Notes from Rhodesia
I have spent many interesting hours watching these birds. They
always keep in small parties, and never wander more than a few yards
from each other. They are shy, and one can seldom approach within
less than a hundred yards of them, they seldom take flight unless one
comes upon them unexpectedly and surprises them, then they fly about
a mile or so, settle, and walk leisurely out of sight, but if they see one
approaching they will walk away, and if one is walking at an ordinary
pace it is impossible to catch them up.
They live on the wooded veldt, usually in the vicinity of a river,
stream, or marsh, and during the greater part of the day they make a
systematic search of the ground for material to satisfy their voracious
appetites. I have seen an individual catch and eat as many as a dozen
frogs in a very short time, and yet go on searching just as diligently
as ever. Nothing seems to come amiss to these birds, frogs, lizards,
snakes, rats, mice, and every kind of insect; when anything is found
it is tossed up into the air, caught and swallowed; of course, large things
are picked to pieces.
The call is a loud boom which can be heard from a great distance.
The Ground Hornbill will perch in trees occasionally, but not
often during the day, at night it roosts in the trees.
If caught young they make charming pets; a friend of mine had one
which loved to play at ball with her little girl, catching the ball in its
beak and throwing it back ; it also used to love to come and sit on her
dress when she sat on a low stool or chair.
These birds seem to breed very slowly as there are very few about,
and they have few enemies, and are seldom shot. In the Union of
South Africa they are protected, and the killing of one involves a very
heavy fine if the offender is found. I do not know whether they are
protected in Ehodesia, but if not they certainly should be, for no other
bird consumes such quantities of obnoxious insects and reptiles.
I have never found the nest, but it is said to be composed of sticks,
and placed on a large tree trunk, or in a large hole in a decayed tree.
The other South African name besides " Turkey Buzzard " is
" Brom Vogel ", which is of course Dutch.
The Ground Hornbill equals a Turkey in size.

found in pairs by rivers, pools, or streams where the water is constant
all the year round. In appearance it resembles the European Dabchick,
but is a little darker in colour. If one sits quietly by the side of a
river these little birds will show little fear, playing about, disporting
and feeding within a few yards of one. They seem to obtain most of
their food, which consists of fish, small frogs, and aquatic insects, etc.,
by diving, usually their catch is brought up to the surface and eaten,
but at other times when nothing is brought up I conclude that it
must have been eaten under the water, or that the birds did not catch
anything. They can stay under the water for an incredibly long time.
I have sometimes seen an odd bird going through a peculiar display,
if it can be called a display. The hind part of the body is raised higher
than .the front so that the lower breast and under parts are exposed
from the back, then the feathers all round the tail are flattened back
towards the head, so as to form a circle in the centre of which is the
tail stump with the few downy feathers which constitute the tail. The
effect is most peculiar, all the time the bird is swimming round
and round.
When disturbed the Dabchick utters a shrill piping note.
I must relate an amusing incident that might have been a tragedy.
I was watching a pair of these birds disporting themselves on a wide
pool in the river, when down stream came what at first sight appeared
to be a log, drifting slowly almost imperceptibly towards the birds.
The seeming log was really a hungry crocodile bent on making a meal
of one of the birds; nearer and nearer he came until he was only a foot
or two from the birds ; then,, in a second, they realized. I have never
seen birds so amazed before; in an instant they had dived, and came
up yards behind the crocodile's tail. The huge reptile then realized
that he had lost his lunch, and sank, as quietly and slowly as he had
come, to the bottom of the river.
Among other water "fowl may be mentioned the Black Crake
(Limnocomx niger ), a small plump black bird about half the size of the
English Waterhen. It frequents the rivers and streams, and is usually
seen running over the lily leaves on the surface of the water, picking
up aquatic insects, and small molluscs, etc., upon which it feeds.

Sydney Porter--Notes from Bhodesia
graceful bird, in colour a mixture of light brown, white, and black, it
appears to run swiftly over the surface of the water, but is in reality
running on the aquatic vegetation which lies just beneath the surface.
It is an extremely shy bird, and I have seldom been able to observe it
for any length of time.
The Greenshank (Totanus glottis) a migratory bird from Europe, is
seen by the large rivers in the spring and summer, but disappears in
the autumn (April). The Green Sandpiper ( Totanus glareola) is
exceedingly common and visits the cattle kraals in small parties in
search of the insects, especially flies, which abound there.
The Painted Snipe (Rostratula capensis) is also seen, usually solitary
in the marshy places and swamps in the summer.
The Avocet (Recurvirostra avocetta), so well known in Europe,
unique on account of its strange thin upturned beak, is a frequent visitor
to the large rivers, where it can be seen on the mud flats and sand
banks searching for insects.
The Blacksmith's Plover (Hoplopterus armatus), a striking looking
bird, a mixture of black, white, and lavender grey, which derives
its name from its peculiar metallic cry, which resembles the ring of
a blacksmith's hammer on the anvil; it, too, is found on the mud flats
by large rivers.
The Wood Ibis (Pseudotantalus ibis) I have occasionally seen in the
company of smaller fry on the mud flats. Why it is called an Ibis, or
Wood Ibis especially, is a mystery to me, for it resembles a small
Marabou (Leptoptilus crumeniferus) , which bird is very occasionally
seen, but both species are far from common.
Of the Heron family, many species are fairly common in the summer
time by the rivers and in marshy places. The Purple Heron ( Ardea
purpurea), the little Black Heron ( Melanophoyx ardesiaca ), the Squacco
Heron (Ardeola ralloides), the Night Heron ( Nycticorax griseus), whose
habits are not nocturnal while it is here, for it can be seen fishing in
the rivers in the day and roosting in the tall mimosa-trees at night.
The Red-necked Little Bittern (Ardetta payesi) seems to be a resident,
for a young one was shot with the nestling down still adhering to its
feathers, in the winter months, many miles from water. But I have
never seen any trace of a nest of this species, but no doubt like the nests

of most Bitterns, it would be well bidden in the reeds. The other
members of the Heron family, the Egrets, I have mentioned previously.
The Hammer-headed Stork (Scopus umbretta), a strange bird known
to most ornithologists, rejoices in many names in Africa : Hammerkop,
Paddevangu, Iteguana, and other names I cannot spell! It is very
unstork-like in appearance, especially when flying, when it rather
resembles a Brown Hawk.
It is common all over South Africa; at the Cape I have seen solitary
individuals standing by little pools against the roadside, not far out
of Cape Town.
T n Rhodesia, it is quite common, living in the vicinity of rivers and
swamps; it is a quiet and dignified bird, and will allow one to approach
it quite closely, but when it thinks one has come far enough, it will
silently take wing and float away, the flight being particularly light
and buoyant.
Sometimes it utters a strange harsh metallic cry. One can always
be sure of seeing it in certain localities usually when there is a nest,
even if it is a very old one, and it seems seldom to wander far from its
particular area.
It feeds by the banks of rivers and streams, pools and lakes, catching
its food by wading in the shallow water, or by standing motionless
and waiting for its prey to come near.
In size it is about 22 inches in length, and of a general sepia-
brown in colour. The feathers of the head and nape are elongated,
and give the bird a very peculiar appearance. The tail is banded with
a darker brown.
The nest is most unique, and is one of the strongest structures
ever built by a bird; at first sight it appears to be nothing but a huge
heap of rubbish with a hole at one side, inside the nest is circular, the
floor and roof being flat and composed of reed stems of equal length
and thickness, all placed neatly side by side, and cemented together
with mud, looking as though it were the work of a human being instead
of that of a bird. The nest is built either on an inaccessible rock or in
a tree.
One nest that I saw was built in the fork of a tall tree, the angle
of the fork being built up with large stems to support the base of the

without damaging it at all. The eggs are four in number, and chalky-
white in colour.

Among my books is one that I value greatly and that interests
me much, for it is a record of aviculture of more than a hundred years
ago, and it shows that many of the species that we deem to be rarities
now were not unknown in captivity then. The title is Portraits of
Rare and Curious Birds , with their descriptions, from the Menagerie of
Osterley Park in the County of Middlesex. It is written by W. Hayes
and family, who are apparently responsible for nearly 100 beautiful
hand-coloured plates, which appear as bright and fresh as if recently
executed, though the book was published in 1794.
The King-Vulture was there, and was considered " extremely
sensible of cold, so as to be affected on the first appearance of frost,
and notwithstanding the greatest care and attention it seldom survives
the winter of our climate". The West African Crowned Crane is said
to have been first brought to Europe by the Portuguese in the fifteenth
century ; at Osterley Park it was " much delighted with being taken
notice of, and was a constant attendant on those who visited this
delightful spot, making the tour of the menagerie with slow and
measured step ; and always parting with the company with much
apparent regret, which it expressed by raising the head, extending
the neck, and making a hoarse, unpleasant cry ".
But the Demoiselle Crane was considered " the most pleasing
bird in the Osterley collection. ... It accompanies the visitors in
their walk in the most graceful manner imaginable, and puts itself
into a variety of attitudes, as if it were preparing to entertain the
company with a dance". It is interesting to note that the subject
of the coloured plate, with several others, were hatched and reared
in the Osterley menagerie.

The Golden Pheasant, known at that time as the Painted Pheasant,
was well established and practically a domestic bird, and instances
were quoted of the hen assuming the plumage of the cock. Of the
Silver Pheasant we read " This, like the common Pheasant, is always
wild and restless ; and though in some degree reclaimed, it is never
perfectly domesticated, but on every opportunity discovers a vindictive
disposition, furiously attacking, with its bill and spurs, whoever
approaches or enters its pen
Of the Chinese Ring-necked Pheasant we read that " although
these birds were formerly considered as very rare and valuable, there
is every reason to believe that in a short time they might become
as abundant as the common Pheasant At the present time the
original English Pheasant has been obliterated by the King-neck.
Of foreign Ducks, the Carolina and Mandarin were both represented
at Osterley. Of the latter we read, " A pair of these scarce and valuable
birds were a long time preserved in this menagery ; and though every
care and attention was paid, in the hope of having them breed, it was
not attended with success."
Writing of the Great Bustard, of which a pair were kept in the
menagerie, the author remarks : " They inhabit most of the open
countries of the southern and eastern part of the island, from Dorsetshire
to the Wolds in Yorkshire, and are frequently met with on Salisbury
Plain." Yet the day of the Great Bustard as a British resident must
have come to a close very soon after this.
A pair of Globose Curassows are figured, and we read that " from
this pair several were bred and raised in this menagery, and in that
number a most beautiful one, which, from the variety and richness
of its plumage, was termed the Zebra Curasso ". The rare Galea ted
Curassow, Pauxis pauxi, was also kept. Of a pair of Nicobar Pigeons
we read that although given every care, attention, and accommodation
the eggs were never productive, though the hen went to nest several
times.
The Indian Green-winged Dove, the White-crowned Pigeon, and
the beautiful Blue-headed Dove of Cuba were all represented in the
menagerie. Hopes were entertained that the Cuban Doves might breed,
but they failed to do so.

The Black Francolin, Red-legged Partridge, and even the Chinese
Painted Quail were represented in the collection. Of the last of these
we read that they " are held in great estimation by the Chinese, who
train them up to fight, as we do game cocks in England 55 . Of Parrots
they had the Red and Blue and the Blue and Yellow Macaws, the
Lesser Sulphur-crested and the Moluccan Cockatoos, the Blue-headed
Pionus, and the Red-faced Lovebird, the Rosella, Ring-necked, and
Blossom-headed Parrakeets, the Purple-capped Lory, Swainson's
Lorrikeet, the St. Thomas's Conure, and the Blue-crowned Hanging
Parrakeet.
The Secretary Bird found a home in this remarkable collection,
as did the Spoonbill and the Scarlet Ibis, the Yulturine Eagle, White-
headed Eagle, and Yirginian Eagle-Owl, the White Stork, the Purple
Gallimile, and the Hoopoe.
The smaller birds must have been well represented too, for we have
good illustrations given of the Paradise, Pintail, and Queen Whydahs,
the Grenadier and Red-billed Weavers, the Paradise, Necklaced and
Spotted Emerald Tanager, the Brazilian and Baltimore Hangnests.
There was also the Hill Mynah, the American Goldfinch, the Blue
Jay, Blue Grosbeak, Red Cardinal, and Dominican Cardinal, the
Yellow-headed Marsh-bird, and the Red-breasted Meadow Starling.
While of ornamental Finches there were the Java Sparrow, Green
Singing Finches, Nonpariel Bunting, Spice Finch, Striated Finch,
White-headed and Tricoloured Mannikin, Cordon-bleu, Avadavat,
Common Waxbill, Jacarini Finch, Melba Finch, and Violet-eared

which some of these originated, as, for instance, in the case of the

immunity, and all efforts at recapturing it have so far proved
unavailing. For some days it kept fairly close to the aviary, sitting
in the tops of the tallest trees, from which it would repeatedly call
to the one still in the aviary, but not even a mouse, which it dearly
loves, would tempt it to come down. It spent the nights in a thick
ivy tree. During the last month it has flown much farther afield,
and has been seen in a wood some way off, also sitting on the top-
most branches of a dead fir-tree quite close to some stacks, presumably
on the look-out for mice. It takes long flights across the park, and
has now become very shy, and will not allow anyone to approach
within 50 yards. Several times it has been seen perching on the
top of the flagstaff on the tower of the house. As far as one can
see it looks the picture of health, and is apparently able to perfectly
withstand the exceedingly severe weather we have been having. I
suspect its food consists mainly of small birds, which it is able to
catch, with possibly the addition of mice and small rats.

[All of the true Lovebirds (Agapornis) make their nests in holes
in trees, lining the cavity with material such as pliant strips of green
bark. In captivity they may make use of other material such as
grass or fine shavings of wood. They should be provided with a large
box with a hole near the top and be supplied with building material.
The late Mr. Reginald Phillipps found that A. roseicoUis carried the
nesting material to the nest tucked between the stiff upper tail-
coverts. So far as we are aware very little is known of the Abyssinian
Lovebird in its wild state, and Mr. W. Lewis appears to be the only
aviculturist who has bred it.-- Ed.]

Directly I touched the hedgehog it let go the bird, which ran some
distance. I picked it up but could find no hurt on it. Is there any
explanation of this ? How could the hedgehog find the bird in the
dark and how did the bird get in the middle of a large lawn in the
dark ?
Arthur Lewis.
[A hedgehog is a dangerous animal where young birds are
concerned, and will readily destroy them, including young chickens
and game-birds. Very little comes amiss to it in the way of food,
which includes insects, mice, frogs, reptiles, eggs, and fruit. It is
also a good climber and will readily scale wire-netting, dropping
down like a ball on the further side. The young Thrush, whose life
our correspondent saved, was probably roosting on a low branch
and when detected by the keen nose of the hedgehog and approached
it fluttered to the middle of the lawn to which it was followed by
the hedgehog with evil intent and the use of a keen sense of hearing
and smell.-- Ed.]

For many years past a standard handbook on the management
of British and Foreign birds in captivity has been a great need of
all aviculturists. Aviculture , of which the first volume has now been
published, fulfills that need. It contains 326 pages of letterpress,
and deals in a practical way with the whole group of Passeres. It is
written in a popular way, but at the same time is accurate and scientific.
There are ten coloured and seventeen uncoloured plates, and although
both plates and letterpress have appeared in the Avicultural
Magazine, it is very convenient to have them bound in one handbook
with a good index, making it an easy matter to turn up any desired
species, and to read what an expert has to say about its treatment.
There are no less than ten authors, all of whom may be said to
be experts on the group or groups of which they deal.
We hope that many of our members will order copies of this book,
which can be had from our publishers, Messrs. Stephen Austin &amp; Sons,
Fore Street, Hertford, price 15s. net.

KINGFISHERS, ROLLERS, AND FROGMOUTHS
Kingfishers
By J. Delacour and M. Legendre
The Kingfishers ( Alcedinidce ) are distributed over the whole surface

of the globe, but particularly abound in the hot portions of Asia, Africa,
and Oceanea. One solitary representative is common in Central and
Western Europe.
The Common Kingfisher (Alcedo ispida) is a rather small bird, having
a thick, short, dumpy body ; a large, long head, with a lengthy beak,
short tail, and moderately long wings. Though its shape is lacking in
grace it is compensated for by its finely coloured plumage. The upper
parts of its body are wholly bluish-green, with small speckles on the
head. A reddish patch under the eyes succeeded by a pure white one ;
throat and front of the neck white ; the under parts are rust red ; feet
red. The female is much like the male. Certain authors assert that her
colouring is deeper or greener ; she only has the base of her mandibles
orange red, the male invariably has a uniformly brown beak.
The Kingfisher is a solitary and lonely bird, which avoids the com-
pany of its kind and that of all other birds. It sees a rival in every other
living thing, and endeavours to be the only occupant of the little
hunting ground which it has selected. It cannot rise high into the air,
flutter in the light of the sun, or seek its food among large trees ; by
the conformation of its feet it is unable to run along the ground. It

rarely walks, at most taking a few steps along a branch or stone. Its
food, which consists of small fish and aquatic insects, retains it on the
banks of brooks and rivers rejoicing in clear and limpid waters. Like
other fishing birds, it sits silent and attentive, perched for hours on a
bare branch, watching for its prey to pass ; as soon as it comes within
sight the bird pounces on it with the rapidity of lightning and with the
boldness caused by an empty stomach.
In the month of April it seeks its mate and during the breeding season
the pair are constantly together. The eggs are laid in May, the nest
being constructed in a hole in the bank of a rustic stream. This
ends in a chamber which the female lines with grass, feathers, and
fish-bones ; in it are laid from five to seven round ivory-white eggs.
After the young have been reared the family breaks up and the
Kingfisher is again a solitary individual.
The amateur who owns a large aviary containing a stream or pool,
and who can provide small living fish will find it easy to rear a young
Kingfisher, for the captive is living its natural life. In this way many
zoological gardens and amateurs keep them for a considerable time. We
know an individual near Paris who always keeps some in confinement,
as he has the good fortune to include a fishing river in his grounds.
A stroke of the net brings up a quantity of little fishes, which he keeps in
an aquarium and throws every day into the pool in the aviary ; when the
aquarium is empty he replenishes it from the river. A few dead and
leafless boughs should be arranged to serve as perches. Kingfishers
are indifferent to changes of temperature.
But for the amateur who desires to keep a Kingfisher in a medium-
sized cage, or even in a bird-room, but who has no small fish other than
what he buys now and then from the nearest fishmonger, it is a very
different matter, and fraught with difficulty. Firstly it is very hard
to keep the cage and its surroundings clean, because the excreta is
scattered far and wide. It is necessary to have a little vessel with a
perch fastened to the side, for the food must be thrown into the water
for the bird to take it. This receptacle, filled with water, must be
firmly fixed in order that it cannot be upset, and deep enough for the
bird not to injure itself when it plunges.
It should be fed on fish, little bits of meat, and mealworms.

Naturally the more fish it gets the better the bird's health will be.
Failing fish, which cannot always be bought small enough, small frogs
will serve. M. Plocq asserts that they readily eat sea fish, provided
that they are not salted. But, in spite of every care and under the most
favourable conditions, it is very difficult to reclaim an adult wild caught
individual; young birds taken from the nest and hand-reared live
longer, but when all is said they rarely reach their second year of
captivity.
The European Kingfisher belongs to the most strictly fish-eating
group of the genus. Very many foreign species are less difficult to keep,
because their diet is more or less insectivorous. The large kinds of
Kingfishers devour reptiles and small mammals.
A certain number of exotic Kingfishers have been imported alive
into Europe. All have well-developed tails and are larger than the
European species.
The Pied Kingfisher ( Ceryle rudis), very common in the temperate
and hot parts of Africa and Asia, is about as large as a Starling and has
a slight crest. It is spotted all over with silvery white and black ; its
beak is black. It is very piscivorous.
The Large-billed Kingfisher (Pelargopsis gurial) is still larger than the
preceding. It has a scarlet beak, very thick and long ; its wings and
tail are bright blue-green, the back pale blue ; the top of the head is
greyish-brown ; the remainder of its plumage is tawny. There are many
sub-species in the tropics of Asia and the Sond Islands. P. malaccensis
has been imported once.
The Halcyons are smaller and have not quite such powerful beaks
as the preceding. They live on fish and small vertebrates, insects also,
which are the chief food of certain among them. Four species have been
imported up to date, and did very well on chopped meat; it is as well
to add insects, worms, and fish occasionally.
The White-breasted Kingfisher ( Halcyon smyrnensis) is commonly
met with from Asia Minor to Indochina. It is a very beautiful bird,
having red beak and feet; wings, back and tail of a fine blue-green,
bright and silky ; the top of the head, shoulders, flanks, and belly
brownish-red ; the throat and breast white.
The Red-rumped Kingfisher (H. pyrrhopygius), from Australia, has

the crown of the head light blue striped with white ; wings, tail, and
the middle of the back blue-green ; the lower back and under tail-
coverts russet; all the underneath parts white ; a black band runs from
the beak to the nape passing through the eye ; black beak, reddish
yellow feet.
The Sacred Kingfisher (H. sanctus) may be found from Java to
Australia ; it is fine blue above, with yellowish white nape which is also
the hue of all the upper parts of the body, with a black line running
through the eye and surrounding the nape ; beak and feet black.
A coloured plate with an account of this species, by Mr. Seth-Smith,
appeared in the Avicultural Magazine for April, 1900 (Vol. VI,
p. 117).
H. vagans, from New Zealand, differs especially in having a very
wdde black mark running from beak to eye and round the nape.
The Laughing Jackasses, Dacelo, are very large Kingfishers, with
stout bodies, enormous heads, relatively short but very powerful
beaks. Three Australian species have been imported, and they are very
easily fed in the same way as Crows ; meat, mice, sparrows, insects, etc.
As a matter of fact, these birds are more curious than pretty ; they utter
a resounding cry which resembles a noisy laugh. D. gigas is the largest;
its back, wings, and tail of several shades of brown and grey ; the head
is white, with a brown stripe on the top and two others by the eyes.
The lesser wing-coverts are marked with light blue. The beak is black.
D. leachi is smaller. It is like the foregoing, but its head is thickly
striated with brown ; its wings, rump, and tail are dark blue, and the
under parts variegated with dark brown. D. cervinus is like it, but has
lighter colouring.
Of the closely allied genus, Sauromarptis, which is confined to New
Guinea and the adjacent islands, Mr. Wilfred Frost imported five
examples of S. tyro from Aru for the Zoological Society of London
in 1921.

homogenous family, provided the curious ground Rollers of Madagascar
(Brachypteraciince) are excluded. They all have large wings, coloured
either light or dark blue, which make a splendid show when they fly ;
some have rather long, narrow beaks and light colouring (Coracias),
while others have short, wide beaks and darker colouring (Euryslomus).
Rollers are purely insectivorous birds, catching most of their prey on
the wing. They take up their stations on dry branches, or very often
along the roads on telegraph wires or posts, flying off to catch an insect
and quickly returning to the same spot. They often delight in
performing extraordinary aerial antics, and fly with remarkable ease.
Rollers nest in hollow trees ; they are noisy and utter harsh cries.
They live well in confinement if placed in a large aviary where they can
use their wings ; their food should be a mixture (to which it takes time
to accustom them) of bread and milk, cheese, and, above all, raw meat
rolled in powdered insects ; mealworms and earthworms ; they are very
fond of beetles.
I have nearly always kept some of these birds as I like them
particularly. I have had or still possess the six following species, all
of which to my knowledge have figured in our aviaries except Coracias
cyanogaster , recently imported from Gambia by Dr. Hapemson.
The European Roller (Coracias garrulus ) is pale blue ; its back is
more or less greenish-chestnut.
The Abyssinian Roller ( C . abyssinicus) , which differs only in having
two tapering feathers on each side of the tail.
Lort's Roller ( C . lorti), from Somaliland, which has purple cheeks
and throat.
The Long-tailed Roller ( C . caudatus) , from Central and South Africa,
which has mauve cheeks, throat, and breast.
The Indian Roller ( C . indicus), with a short tail, may be recognized
by its cheeks, throat, and breast, being chestnut shot with mauve
and striated with white.
All the above species have the top of the head, belly, wings, and tail
blue ; and the forehead, eyebrows, and throat white.
The Variegated Roller (C. ncevius) has a very distinct uniform ; its
head is chestnut, washed with purple, with nape and eyebrows white ;
under parts chestnut shot purple striated with white; wings and tail

brilliant mauve purple; tail dark green. It inhabits Equatorial
Africa, Senegambia, and Abyssinia.
The Blue-bellied Roller ( C . cyanogaster), of which one specimen has
been received by the London Zoological Society, is large, with a forked
tail ; it has a black back, head, neck, and breast pale yellow, and deep
blue belly ; the tail and wings, like those of the other species, are light
blue and dark blue. It is a native of Senegambia.
The Broad-billed Rollers ( Eurystomus ) are not as frequently
imported ; the best known are :--
The Eastern Broad-billed Roller ( Eurystomus orientalis) , deep
blue shading into green, with brighter throat; the top and sides of
the head blackish-grey ; feet and beak red.
The African Broad-billed Roller ( Eurystomus afer), rust-colour,
shot with purple on the head and under parts ; the lower belly, rump,
back, tail, and flights blue. Dark grey feet; yellow beak.
The Frogmouths
By J. Delacour
The species of birds which make up the family of the Podargidoe
are among the most curious. They are nocturnal and remind one, by
their brown plumage with its various and delicate markings, of the
Owls and Nightjars; they are specially remarkable for their short,
enormously wide, beaks, having a gape which is more like a reptile's
than a bird's.
Only one species is American ; the very curious Steatornis , which
inhabits caves in Trinidad, Venezuela, and other southerly parts of
South America, in which it lives all day, and rears its young. It comes
out at nightfall in order to feed on the fruit of the palms, which it
swallows whole with their large kernels.
The rest of the family, belonging to three different kinds, may be
found in the hotter parts of Asia and Oceania. They have enormous
heads and gapes. They are insectivorous birds, and hunt among the
branches at night. In the daytime they stay perched with their bodies
placed vertically and blending with the bark.
Some years ago three specimens of the Australian Frogmouth
(Podargus strigoides ) were obtained by the Zoological Society of London.

(Continued from p. 80)
The dainty Crowned Plover or Lapwing (Stephanibyx coronatus) 1
is very common in certain localities in Rhodesia, and is rather a nuisance
at night if one wishes to sleep as it seems to be both diurnaland nocturnal,
arid when it sleeps is a mystery. In the day it plays about, feeds, and
has little impromptu meetings : at night it seems to spend its time in
running about or flying round and round, all the time giving vent to
&amp;lt;a variety of extremely loud plaintive cries. Most of the night seems to
be given up to this form of exercise for no apparent reason whatever.
A little party of these handsome Plovers lived around the hut of
a friend of mine, and as they would come quite close up, I had good
opportunities of observing them, through the ever-open door, over the
breakfast-table.
They seemed to thoroughly enjoy life, both in the day and at night.
This little party usually had a Double-banded Courser (Rhinoptilus
bicinctus) in attendance, and he (or she) was on the most friendly terms
with the Plovers ; he would attend the meetings, going up to each bird
in turn and watching with great interest anything that they did.
In the mating season the birds go through a short, but strange
display. Immediately after mating has taken place the cock and hen
come up to each other with short dainty steps, stand side by side, so
that they touch each other, then they each raise the outer wing to
its full extent and expose the pure white under wing. This form of
display, which may be endearment, only lasts for a few seconds.
It is rather unusual for these birds to haunt the environs of a home-
stead. They usually prefer to frequent the open veldt, but my friend,
P An illustration of this handsome Plover appeared in our Magazine in
September last.-- Ed.]

Sydney Portei--Notes from Rhodesia
who is interested in birds, protects them and all other birds. They seem
to know this and flock around his place, and usually in the feathered
throng one sees many rare and interesting birds.
In colour the Crowned Plover is pale olive-brown on the back and
wings, a spot in the centre of tht, crown is black ; this is surrounded by
a broad white ring, and this in turn is surrounded by a broad black
edging that terminates in a point on the nape. The upper breast is
pale brown, and below this is a black line which divides the brown from
the pure white under parts. The upper tail-coverts white, also the tail
which has a black band near the end. The wing coverts are mottled
with white. The beak and legs are a beautiful rosy pink. The whole
contour of this bird is extremely graceful, and the colours clear and well
defined.
In the marshes or on the veldt by rivers the Wattled Plover
(Lobivanellus lateralis) is very common, and is even better known than
the previously mentioned bird. Its colours are the same, but the
arrangement is different; the beak and long, thin legs are a beautiful
willow green colour and between the eye and the base of the beak is
a wattle about three-quarters of an inch long of the same green colour,
with an orange spot near the tip.
Its habits are very much the same as those of its near ally the
Crowned Plover, but it seems to prefer the damper places. It is just as
garrulous both in the day and at night, but the note is different; also
when it is disturbed it will circle round uttering its cry.
I have been in the breeding grounds of both birds, but have failed
to discover either eggs or young. The flight of both species is light,
airy, and buoyant in the extreme.
The only member of the Psittacidse that I have seen in Ehodesia
is the pretty little Meyers Parrot (Poeocephalus meyeri), which is far from
common. It is found on the wooded veldt, usually in small parties or
in pairs.
In colour it is sooty brown, with a yellow frontal band, the edge of
the wing and under wing-coverts being bright yellow, the abdomen
bright bluish-green, the lower back and tail-coverts light blue, the beak
and legs dark brown, and the naked skin round the eye black. The
length is about 9 inches. The male and female are similar. The

whereabouts of these little Parrots can usually be detected by their
shrill cry, which they utter at frequent intervals as they feed. They are
partial to the m'harsh trees. These trees, or at least the female tree,
bears a fleshy fruit, which looks something like a small new potato
with a large stone inside ; it also has a most peculiar astringent taste.
This fruit they are very fond of.
The colour of the Meyers Parrot harmonizes so well with the foliage
of the trees, that it is almost impossible to see it when feeding in a tree.
I have been underneath trees which have contained several of these
birds, and have had to watch for half an hour or more before being able
to discern them; all the time they sent down a perfect rain of pieces
of fruit and stones, and every few minutes uttered their shrill cry.
Usually these birds are exceedingly shy and wary and are very
hard to approach, but if one gradually approaches them and the birds
see that no harm is intended, they can be watched from quite close
quarters.
Young Meyers Parrots are sometimes caught by the natives and sold
to the white people, who usually feed them upon hard maize, which
soon ends their career on this plane ; if they manage to survive they
make delightful pets. The flight of the birds, though in a degree rather
laboured, is exceedingly swift. Besides feeding on the m'harsh fruit,
they eat many other kinds of wild fruit and berries.
When at Cape Town on my way to Rhodesia I saw a cage full of a
nearly allied, but most beautiful Parrot, namely the Rueppell's
Parrot (Pceocephalus rueppelli). I would certainly have bought them
had I been on my homeward journey.
The pretty little Golden-breasted Waxbill (Estrelda suhflava), so
well known to aviculturists at home, is fairly common in Rhodesia,
though it is never seen in the same numbers as the Common Waxbill
(Estrelda astrilda). It frequents the marshy lands or the veldt
that borders the rivers or streams where the grass and reed seed
is plentiful, upon which it feeds. It breeds all the year round,
except in the worst part of the rainy season. If in the summer
or autumn it nests in the Mexican Mangolds on the ant-hills,
like the Scarlet Weaver, making a pouch-shaped nest, woven of
the finest flowering grass-heads, between two or more stems of

the mangolds. The nest is very much like that of the Weaver,
but is smaller and finer. If it nests in the winter and spring, when the
mangolds are dead, the nest which is of a much firmer and thicker
construction, is built in the thick matted dry grass, sometimes almost
on the ground. The tiny white eggs, not much larger than elongated
peas, are five in number ; the male incubates as well as the female.
Sometimes in the thick undergrowth and reeds by the rivers is seen
that strange and illusive bird, Levaillant's Cuckoo (Coccystes cafer).
About the size of the European Cuckoo, but more slender in build,
glossy greenish-black in colour above, a white band on the wings, the
tail tipped with white, the under-surface white, the throat and chest
being streaked with black ; also the sides and flanks. The head feathers
are elongated, and form a long, pointed crest.
This Cuckoo is a migrant, arriving in the late spring and leaving
in the autumn. It is shy and retiring, and will not tolerate observation
from a human being ; as soon as it sees one it slips away into the under-
growth or reeds. I have only seen solitary specimens, and owing to its
timidity have been unable to find out much about its habits.
This Cuckoo feeds upon insects, principally the poisonous
hairy caterpillars, which no other birds will touch, and in that way is
of great economic value. No doubt it is parasitical, like its near ally
the Black-crested Cuckoo (Coccystes serratus), but nothing seems to be
known for sure in regard to its breeding habits.
The family of Shrikes is well represented in South Africa, there
being about thirty-five different species, and many of these are
inhabitants of Rhodesia. The Mozambique Shrike (Dryoscopus
mossambicus) is fairly common, and is found in small parties in the bush
bordering the rivers. It is not very striking to look at and in colour
is an arrangement of black above and a pinkish creamy white below,
with white markings on the wings.
One is at once attracted by the calls of this bird, which are quite
unique. The most familiar is a loud single note, which can be imitated
by making a loud " Oh " in the throat with the mouth open. This call
is made at intervals of a few seconds, and can be heard from quite a
distance. Another cry is something like " you--er ", " you--er ",
half whistled, and in the middle of each note is another sound, like a

harp string being plucked. This is very metallic and staccato, and both
.sounds are uttered simultaneously ; it seems as though the bird had
two vocal organs, and at first I couldn't believe that the sound could
be made by a bird, until one day when I was sitting hidden in the long
grass by the side of the Umsururu River one of these birds came quite
close, and I was able to see and hear it.
Then there is the Long-tailed Shrike (Urolestes melanoleucus) that
has also great vocal powers ; in fact, most of the South African Shrikes
are noted for their loquacity. This bird has a very loud chattering cry,
and unlike the Mozambique Shrike is fairly tame and confiding. At
first sight it rather recalls a Whydah, about 18 inches in length, the
tail occupying from 12 to 13 inches, dull black in colour, the feathers of
the head being lanceolar in shape. The scapulas, which are elongated
and cover the back, the tips and basal half of the flight feathers, the
tips of the tail and secondary wing-coverts, and also a few of the flank
feathers, white.
This bird lives in small parties on the bush veldt, and is seldom seen
in the immediate vicinity of rivers, but prefers the dry sand veldt.
It frequents the neighbourhood of old native kraals where the vegetation
is luxuriant and is conducive to an abundant supply of insects, upon
which these birds feed. The nest--which is very unlike the usual neat
nests of the Shrike family--is a bulky and rough affair, placed at the
top of a tall tree.
The Lesser Puff-back Shrike (Dryoscopus cubla) is found around the
homesteads and is known at once by its peculiar note, which resembles
a whistle blown at frequent intervals, hence its local name--" The
Policeman's Whistle ".
It is a very small bird for a Shrike, less than 6 inches in length,
and is a mixture of grey, black, and white ; the lower back feathers,
which are white, are elongated and very full, and the bird is able to
puff these out so that it resembles a ball; no doubt these feathers are
used in the courting display. The nest is a most beautiful structure,
made of the finest grass and so bound round that no ends are visible,
and covered with cobwebs from a giant spider's web. The strands
from these great webs, one of which I measured was 15 feet high and
12 feet broad, are in great demand for the building of nests, the threads

being so strong that if a dozen are plaited together it is impossible to
break them. Once I found a Flycatcher (Hyliota rhodesiae) entangled
in one.
I have only seen two species of Crane in Rhodesia, namely the
Wattled Crane (Buyeranus carunculatus) and the Crowned Crane
(Balearica regulorum). The former is, I think, comparatively rare, and
I have only seen solitary specimens flying over at a great height.
It is a large bird, the largest of the African Cranes, and is grey and white
in colour. The latter is quite common, and during the summer a pair
can usually be seen by any large sheet of water or in the swampy
reaches of the rivers. They spend their time searching for insects,
mollusca, and Crustacea, upon which they feed. The two birds usually
seem devoted to each other, and seldom wander far away. Sometimes-
they indulge in a strange dance, more often than not one bird will perform
for the benefit of the other, but occasionally both birds will take part
in it. During this dance the birds seem to lightly hop and skip about on
the tips of their toes, with outstretched wings and bowing necks ;
nearly always they face each other.
These birds are shy, and it is impossible to approach within several
hundred yards of them. Their gait is extremely graceful and stately,
and their flight easy, light, and buoyant. Sometimes they will come into&amp;apos;
the cultivated lands and feed upon the sprouting grain, and are con-
sequently shot by the farmers. I am afraid that the Rhodesian farmers,
in common with those at home, imagine that if any bird is seen in the
grain fields it is necessarily feeding upon the grain. This is a great
fallacy, for the chances are a hundred to one that it is feeding upon the
obnoxious insects, though the present case is perhaps an exception.
The Crowned Crane builds its nest in the tall reeds and grasses in the
marshes or swamps. It is a bulky structure, composed of reeds well
trodden down, and rather resembles a Swan's nest. Two bluish-white
eggs are laid, which soon become stained by the damp vegetation of
which the nest is formed. A pair of these birds nested every year in the
marshes by the Umsururu River, but they always failed to bring up
any young, for their eggs were always stolen either by niggers or white
people. The male of this pair, poor fellow, had a hanging leg, it having
been broken by a shot, but he danced just the same on his one remaining

leg. The. colouring of these birds is well known to all aviculturists, so
that a detailed description is. rather futile, sufficient to say. that the
bristle-like crest or crown and the beautiful pink cheeks render this
bird unique.
Many years ago the Southern Ostrich (Struthio australis) wandered
in great numbers over the drier parts of South Africa ; now, alas !
its numbers are greatly diminished, and it is comparatively scarce.
Small numbers are still found in the wilder parts of the Union of South
Africa, in the Kalahari Desert, in Bechuanaland, and in rapidly
decreasing numbers in Rhodesia.
The Ostrich has. three great enemies, namely .the nigger, the white
man, and the jackal. The nigger takes the eggs and kills the young for
food; the jackals also kill a great number of young Ostriches ; the
white man kills because it.comes into the mealie lands and causes
great havoc with the crops. An Ostrich that a friend of mine
shot had thirty-six mealie cobs in its crop, so that one can imagine the
damage that a flock would do to a crop. The white man also kills for
the feathers and for sport, though I have never yet been able to under-
stand why wanton slaughter, no matter whether of Ostriches, Pheasants,
or Doves, should be called sport; but no doubt it satisfies some
primitive blood lust which is instinctive in some people.
On the estate where I stayed there were four wild Ostriches, one
male and three females. All four were extremely shy, but they could be
easily observed if one hid behind the stones on the top of a kopje.
Usually their movements were slow and leisurely ; they moved along
cropping the grass or herbage, but upon sighting a human being they
would set off at a. steady run. Once I was fortunate enough to witness
a display of the cock bird. Two hens were feeding with the cock when
the other hen came in sight; when she was about three hundred yards
away the cock swelled out his throat and neck, and gave vent to a
series of loud " Ohs 55 ; after this he opened his wings, pressing them
against the side of the body so that the tips of the white plumes of each
wing met over the back. With the wings like this he ran several yards
and then brought the wings to the normal position again. Then,
advancing several more yards, he knelt down, the body being inclined
forwards. Then he opened his wings at right angles to the body, and

moved each one alternately with a rowing motion, the wings resembling
great waving fans. This performance was repeated ad lib . until he
reached the hen, who stood rather unconcernedly, her body tilted
forward and her wings hanging down in front of her legs. After it was
all over the cock walked away with his wings folded over his back !
The male wild Ostrich seems to differ slightly from the tame one
in having the tail feathers dark greyish-brown, whereas the tame one
has the tail white. The birds mentioned laid every year, but the eggs
were always taken by niggers. Sometimes I have seen stray wanderers,
either cocks or hens, out on the veldt passing from one part of the
country to another ; these birds are extremely shy.
Of the various species of Whydah- birds inhabiting Rhodesia I
have only seen two, the Red-collared Whydah ( Goliuspasser ardens) and
the Pin-tailed Whydah (Vidua principalis). The former, which is not
very common, inhabits the vicinity of rivers and marshes, where the
dense reeds grow. The males are usually very much in evidence, where
they are found either perched on the tops of tall reeds or trees or some
other point of advantage, where they form a conspicuous object. The
hens are seldom seen, as they frequent the undergrowth, and their
unobtrusive colouring renders them difficult to discern. The male is
deep silky black, with a crescent-shaped collar of scarlet on the upper
breast; the tail feathers are enormously elongated and look like
narrow black ribbons tied on to the bird.
I have frequently seen it stated that the long tail feathers hinder the
bird in its flight, especially during the rainy season, but I have never
found this so ; during the rainy season of 1924-25, which was the wettest
season on record for Rhodesia, and when 2 inches of rain was very
often recorded in an hour, I saw these birds, nearly every day and the
rain never seemed to hamper them in any way; indeed, their flight
always seemed much easier and more buoyant than that of most other
Weavers.
The other Whydah is found around the homesteads and is one of the
most conspicuous of all the birds that frequent the environs of the
homesteads during the summer. It consorts in small parties, con-
sisting of about a dozen or more hens and one or two cocks. It is always
found in the vicinity of fowl-runs, stables, or anywhere where it may

find stray com or mealie meal. Sometimes the males will indulge in
aerial gymnastics; from the top of a tall tree they will shoot straight,
up into the air for some yards, make a series of twists and turns, and
then come down head first, the long tail feathers streaming behind.
In the winter when the males are in undress plumage they associate-
in flocks, and frequent the grasslands, cultivated fields, and farmyards
but they are shier then than when in breeding plumage. This bird is-
so well known that a description of the plumage is quite unnecessary.
There seems to be few gallinaceous birds in Rhodesia. I have only
met with five, namely the Coqui Francolin (Francolinus coqui ), Shelley's.
Francolin (Francolinus shelleyi ), Humboldt's Francolin ( Pternistes\0x25A0
humholdti), the Cape Quail ( Coturnix africana ), and Crowned Guinea
Fowl ( Nmnida coronata). The first mentioned is common owing to its-
habits of frequenting the thick grass and bush veldt, where it lives in
small coveys, feeding upon bulbous roots, tender shoots, and all manner
of small insects and seeds, etc. When disturbed it runs for a short,
distance, and then takes wing ; its flight is exceedingly hard, but.
extremely rapid. It is one of the most beautiful of the Francolins.
A detailed description of the plumage would fill a page, so that I will
only give a general impression. The whole of the head, neck, and throat-
bright yellowish-buff, washed with greyish-chestnut on the crown ;
the breast and under parts creamy white, heavily barred with black, the
markings becoming less pronounced on the lower parts. Some of the
long flank feathers have a chestnut spot on. The upper parts are the
usual Partridge colour, a mixture of browns, black, and grey. The base
of the beak bright yellow, the rest horn-colour. The legs are also,
bright yellow. The hen is different, altogether of a paler colour and she
has a white throat, and the barring of the breast is less defined. The
local name is Iswempe (pronounced cs swimpy "), which is of Zulu,
origin, and is derived from the bird's call, which is usually uttered in
the morning and evening. This call is loud and penetrating and consists,
of " Swirnpi, swimpi, swimpi ", uttered a great many times.
Shelley's Francolin is about twice the size of the previously
mentioned bird, and is often found consorting with it. Above it is the
usual Partridge colour mentioned previously; on the upper parts, the
throat is white, bordered by a band of black and white feathers, the

crown black, each feather edged with buff. The ear-coverts pale buff,
*a black and white stripe runs from the eye to the base of the neck,
the upper breast mottled chestnut and white, the lower breast feathers
white with transverse bars of black. The flank feathers, which are
elongated and cover the wings in repose, have the end portion of one
web chestnut, and the other mottled black and white and chestnut.
The legs are flesh-coloured, the beak horn-coloured, darker at the tips.
The hen is somewhat similar, but paler in colour, and has the throat
creamy white, and the stripe from the base of the beak running
over the eye to the base 6f the neck creamy white mixed with black.
The upper parts are washed with grey and the breast markings are less
pronounced. She has no spurs.
Humboldt's Francolin is a much larger bird still, being about as
large as a fowl. This bird is partly aboreal as well as terrestrial, and is
often seen in trees, especially the males. It frequents the thick bush
near rivers, and is seldom found in the open like the other two, but is
not nearly as numerous. The cock has a loud crowing note, which he
utters when in a tree. The general colour is dark greyish-brown above,
the throat is naked, also a patch round the eye. This is brilliant red,
the neck, breast, and sides black and white, being striped longitudinally.
The centre of the abdomen is black, the legs and beak bright red. The
flank feathers are very long. This strikingly looking bird is more or less
confined to Rhodesia, where it was once extremely common, but now,
owing to persecution, it is getting far less so.
The Crowned Guinea Fowl is quite common, and is found in flocks
in the thick bush, usually by rivers ; it is wary and shy and very difficult
to approach. It very seldom takes to the wing when disturbed, but
runs at a great speed. In most ways it resembles the domesticated
Guinea Fowl, but is black instead of grey, the spots also being larger.
It is very regrettable that this bird is extensively shot, for it is of great
economic value, destroying an immense amount of objectionable
insects that infest Rhodesia and at times make life unbearable. It
feeds upon the maggots of the dreaded tse-tse fly (the cause of sleeping
sickness) and other pest-carrying insects.
The Cape Quail is common in Rhodesia, especially during the
summer. It differs very slightly from the European Quail. A native

once brought me two young ones a few hours old ; he had killed the
mother, and succeeded in capturing two of the chicks. They were the
tiniest little balls of fluff, and it looked rather hopeless to try and rear
them, as they were half dead ; but I managed it, keeping them in a box
with a hot-water bottle in, and feeding them upon chopped egg and
mealie meal at first, which had to be forced down, and afterwards upon
ropoka, various grass seeds, and the larval form of a small species of
grey ant that abounds in Rhodesia. They grew up into fine birds, a
cock and hen. The latter died for some unaccountable reason, and
I let the cock go.
I have seen other species of Quail, but I am not sure of their species.
The pretty little Kurrichane Hemipode (Turnix lepurana) is often
mistaken for a Quail, a bird which it superficially resembles, but on
close examination it will be found that it is quite different in shape.
While the Quails are more or less rotund in shape, the Hemipodes
are ovallanceolate in form. The neck is longer and the head smaller ;
they will be found on close examination to lack the hind toe. The
Hemipodes are unique owing to the fact that the hen is the larger and
brighter of the sex, the male performing the duties of incubation, etc.
The Kurrichane Hemipode lives on the grass veldt, and is partial
to the edges of cultivated lands, where it associates in small parties.
It is seldom seen away from the thick grass, so is not very well known.
It feeds upon seeds of grasses and various plants, and also upon insects.
It is about 6 |inches in length. Above it is chestnut and black, the
feathers edged with grey. The throat silvery cream, the feathers tipped
with black. The feathers at the side of the neck and breast black
edged with cream. The centre of the upper breast light yellowish
russet. The lower parts silky white ; the flanks light chestnut; the
flights grey ; the larger wing-coverts a mixture of chestnut, black, and
white ; the tail feathers, which are very meagre and soft, are a mixture
of browns ; the lower tail-coverts light chestnut; the beak is leaden
blue ; the feet yellowish brown. The female is very similar but brighter
in colour.

When the late Mrs. Dalton Burgess's collection of birds was offered
for disposal, I was fortunate in procuring, amongst others, a very nice
pair of these Jays. Mr. Hedges, who, I understand, had been assisting
Mrs. Dalton Burgess for years with her birds, informed me that they had
on several occasions in the previous year attempted to breed. When the
warm weather came in the spring of 1925, I decided to give this pair an
aviary entirely to themselves, and I fixed up a number of suitable nest
sites, well concealed from view. Almost immediately after I put the
Jays into the aviary, they selected the fork of an old tree covered with
brushwood nailed high up in the corner of the flight. Here they com-
menced building with, pieces pulled off a plant of honeysuckle, and small
twigs. They lined the nest almost entirely with root fibres, discarding
all other materials supplied. Within a few days of the nest being com-
pleted the first egg was laid, which I had a peep at by using a ladder
on the outside of the aviary. The egg was nearly oval, and about the
size of an ordinary Jay's egg, being a beautiful russet-brown colour,
marked with darker spots and blotches. Altogether three eggs were
laid. After incubating for ten days, one of these was missing ; the other
two hatched out, I think, on the fifteenth day, and the young were duly
fed on cockroaches, nestling sparrows, and mealworms for a week,
when to my great grief both of them were thrown out of the nest. The
cock bird amused himself by banging their heads on the door leading
to the sleeping quarters.
They went to nest again, but whether more eggs than one were
laid or not, I cannot say. The hen bird sat for a considerable time, and
eventually I had a look and found the nest empty ; I therefore came to
the conclusion that father had been busy again. I searched the aviary
all over for any remains ; the only thing I could find was a leg, but
whether it belonged to the first brood or the second, I cannot say.
After this exhibition of cannibalism, I began to think my chances
of rearing this beautiful Jay very remote, and practically gave up hope,
a&amp; it was now the middle of August and the summer in Lincolnshire

nearly gone. However, they relined the nest and commenced again,
laying three eggs. On the fifteenth day from the hen bird commencing
to sit she duly hatched out three youngsters. At this time I had a
friend whose stores were infested with mice, and who regularly supplied
me with six to twelve every day, and as these were taken in preference
to mealworms or any other food I could find, the young birds grew at
a surprising speed. Moreover, these very shy birds commenced to act
in a quite different manner. Instead of getting out of my way and con-
cealing themselves in every possible bush, they came screeching and
scolding every time I went near the aviary. They seemed almost to
beg for more mice and still more; in fact, they became so
extraordinarily tame that I could actually touch the hen bird when
giving her a mouse. As soon as she had got it, the cock bird would scold
me as hard as he could until I was out of the aviary, as much as to say,
" You dare touch my family." This, of course, was very encouraging,
as I knew by their attitude they meant business this time. At a week
old the young ones were covered with a very dark soot-coloured down,
and possessed what first appeared to be an enormous crest. On the
twelfth day the largest young one left the nest but, of course, was quite
incapable of getting about the aviary. I put it back in the nest, but it
was out again in the afternoon, and as it was rather a wet evening I
moved it into the shelter. The thirteenth and fourteenth days saw the
other two birds out of the nest, and also put into the shelter, where all
three birds remained for three weeks before they were able to get about
the aviary. The plumage on leaving the nest was : head and body,
sooty black ; back, pale bluish-grey. What appeared to be the afore-
mentioned crest, turned out to be an extraordinary formation of
feathers, growing from above the eyes, and standing straight up,
cockade fashion, over the beak. This crest at the end of December was
still standing up well over the beaks of two of the birds. The third,
which is much smaller than the others, and I believe a hen, has almost
entirely lost this crest, it having become quite flat over the head.
At the present time the beak and legs are a pale flesh colour ; back
and tail bluish grey. All three birds are now healthy and strong, and
are quite capable of tearing to pieces and devouring a mouse or small
rat without the assistance of their parents.

Members at any time in the neighbourhood of Beaconsfield should
make a special point of visiting Courtlands, the home of Mr. F. G.
Hedges, F.Z.S., M.R.A.O.U. Although Mr. Hedges has only been there
a short time, he has made remarkable progress with his aviaries, and
when they are finished they will most certainly be numbered amongst
the finest in the country, and it will be hard to find anywhere aviaries
better adapted for the acclimatization of foreign birds.
The position is almost ideal, well removed from a main road and
standing on the edge of a large beech wood. All the aviaries and bird-
rooms are built in sections for easy removal. There are three aviaries
with open-fronted shelters, 4 feet wide, 4 feet deep, 6 feet high front and *
7 feet high back ; the flights are 12 feet long, 4 feet wide, and 6 feet
high, ! in. mesh wire-netting being used. The inhabitants of these three

Adjoining these aviaries are six smaller ones; the houses of which are
6 feet wide, 4 feet deep, same height as the previous ones. A large window
of rose glass is fitted in the front of each, the floors throughout are of
concrete. The flights are 9 feet long, 6 feet wide, and 6 feet high. These
are occupied by various shades of Blue Budgerigars, Cobalt, Lilac,
Blue, Grey, etc., some fifty pairs, all flying in the open and all in
exceedingly fine condition. Facing this range is a similar one, as yet
unfinished, but destined for more Blue Budgerigars.
Mr. Hedges has probably bred more Blues than anyone in England,
and is undoubtedly the originator of the Cobalt Blue, although various
unfounded claims are made abroad. As well as the above, there are

small flocks of Apple-greens, Jades, Olives, Yellows, and Greens.
A nice pair of Whites were also bred last year. Besides these there are
two larger aviaries, with houses 12 feet wide, 4 feet deep, height as
before ; the flights are 12 feet wide, 24 feet long, and 7 feet high.
Here are quartered the experimental Budgies, every conceivable
cross and variation, but as yet no Cinnamons !
The various bird-rooms are next visited, and amongst others are
the following birds, mostly in pairs: Temmincks Blue Thrushes,
Orange-headed Ground Thrushes, Spreo and Glossy Starlings, Troupials,
Shamas, Pekin Bobins, Backet-tailed Drongos, African Boilers, Slaty-
headed Scimitar Babblers, Dials, Yellow-shouldered Whydahs, Golden-
fronted Fruitsuckers, Masked and Denemelli Weavers, Bed-headed
Parrot Finches, Abyssinian and Nyasa Lovebirds ( Agajpornis liliance),
Senegal Parrots and Guiana Parrotlets. In his study Mr. Hedges keeps
his few especial pets. The famous Palaeornis salvadorii, winner of the
Foreign Bird " Grand National 55 at the recent Crystal Palace show,
of course takes pride of place; a very nice cock Princess of Wales
Parrakeet, a cock Bedcap Parrot, and a hen Gang-gang Cockatoo
(bred by him in France for the first time in Europe). Another rarity,
this unfortunately, however, a stuffed specimen, is a Pesquet Parrot,
the cock bird of a pair imported by Mr. Hedges for the late Mrs. M. A.
Dalton-Burgess; it might be mentioned that this is the only pair known
to have reached England alive. 1
Pheasant runs and Duck pens are in the course of construction, and
when finished will add further charm to an already very fine collection
of birds.
The following are some of Mr. Hedges previous breeding successes :

As far as I am aware there appears to have been very little recorded
of Fieldfares and Redwings as cage or aviary birds, so I thought the
following notes might be of interest to those aviculturists who keep
some of the larger insectivorous birds. Though both are pretty regular
and comparatively common winter visitants to this country, yet it is
very seldom one is enabled to get Sufficiently close to them in their
wild state--especially Fieldfares--to appreciate the beauty of their
plumage. Both are handsome birds, though not so brilliantly coloured
as are some of their foreign relations. Nevertheless the blending of
soft browns and slaty blues of the back and head of the male Fieldfare
together with the dull orange of the upper breast, heavily spotted
with dark brown and the beautifully pencilled flanks make him a very
attractive bird.
Redwings at a short distance are no doubt mistaken by many
for Song Thrushes, being very similar in outline and general appearance ;
the two obvious and distinctive features are the light cream-coloured
line above the eye and the rich red-brown of the flank feathers ; these
latter are hardly visible at times, for instance, immediately the bird
has alighted, the wing feathers then obscuring the reddish feathers,
which are those of the breast--not the wing. These coloured feathers
overlap the wing when the bird has settled down.
The cold spell experienced at the commencement of December
last year had the effect of drawing both species from the fields and
meadows to the more sheltered places such as gardens and shrubberies
around houses. Both these migratory thrushes have always interested
me, and I had often thought that I should like to have a pair of each,
with suitable companions, in an aviary--each pair, of course, in a
separate enclosure. Previously, however, the mild winters had rather
militated against catching them, and none of the local bird-catchers
seemed keen on trying.
During the cold snap at the end of November I happened to be
out one evening with my terriers when on passing under a thick holly
bush they disturbed a bird which dashed off into the darkness. A few

minutes later I heard it fluttering against the tennis netting. Thinking
in all probability it was either a Song Thrush or a Blackbird I was
about to leave it when it occurred to me that perhaps it might be
a Fieldfare, two or three of which had been seen in the garden the day
before, so pushing through the bushes I secured the bird. On bringing
it to the light it turned out to be a fine Redwing, which I placed in
a large box-cage in an indoor bird-room. The cold weather continuing
a flock of about a dozen Fieldfares visited the garden, some old windfall
apples which had been left in the grass under the trees were the
attraction. So I decided to rig up a trap--quite a simple contrivance--
a piece of strawberry netting over some thin iron rods fixed on short
stakes with a falling trap-door at one end, controlled by a cord leading
to a " hide " in the shrubbery ; the bait being the aforementioned
windfalls. Within half an hour of setting it I had caught a fine hen;
it was then nearly dark. Before leaving I had the end of the cord
fastened to my bedroom window. Next morning there was a great
commotion outside, and on carefully looking out I saw a fine cock
Fieldfare doing battle with a Missel Thrush inside the trap ! Pulling
the cord I hurried down, secured the Fieldfare and released the Missel
Thrush. Two days later another cock was caught. Then the thaw
set in and the remainder departed to the fields again. I noticed
whilst they were in the garden they were very intolerant of any other
Thrushes, driving away Blackbirds and Song Thrushes as well as
Starlings and the only Redwing which came into the garden at
that time.
To begin with I kept each of them in a box-cage. They are,
however, too large for such confinement and made their cages in a filthy
state in a very few hours. Regardless of this I think they should be
kept at least a week in a comparatively small area to get over their
initial wildness. Later they were transferred to a good-sized enclosure
in the loft bird-room.
I do not remember having seen it recorded that Fieldfares are
exceptionally pugnacious birds. That they are, there is no doubt,
and within a few hours of being put in this place I had to rescue both
the hen and the second cock from the attacks of the first; both birds
had taken refuge in a corner and were mercilessly set upon if they

dared come out or approach the food tray. So this meant catching
them up and fixing up three separate flights. I now have the first cock
and the hen in adjoining flights separated by tightly strained fish
netting. It is interesting to watch them--the cock bird is continually
displaying to the hen, drooping his wings and showing the pale slate-
grey colour of the lower back, and raising the feathers on the shoulders,,
thereby intensifying the bright brown colouring there, the hen at the
same time raising and spreading her tail and lowering and flirting her
wings. That she is not exactly admiring his attentions is shown by
her sudden dashing at him through the netting; he replies to the attack,,
and up they go to the top of the house and then on to the floor--like
two Bantam Cocks ! This happens at intervals during the day. They
appear quite unable to injure each other through the net, I think
owing to its movement and the narrowing of the meshes as they
hang on them.
I always knew it was a dangerous practice to keep cocks and hens
of most of the Turdidse in the same aviary, especially as the breeding
season draws near, but I do not think any of the Thrushes can surpass
Fieldfares for vindictiveness to their own kind.
At present I have not had the experience of keeping Redwings
together. So far I have not been able to secure any more, though
with the return of the hard weather there are quite a number in the
Valley close by, but they are more difficult to attract, not caring for
the apples as the Fieldfares do. The one I have I still keep in a large
cage and it has become quite tame, though it will not yet take meal-
worms from the hand, but it hops down immediately to get them.
As I look after all my birds myself, to save time in the mornings
I prepare the food for the Fieldfares and Redwing overnight and
change the water of the latter. The curious thing is it invariably
comes down by artificial light and bathes directly the fresh water is
put in--not just a splash from the edge of the pan, but a real soaking,
jumping into the middle of the dish and splashing vigorously.
Regarding freshly caught Thrushes, they should never be confined
to begin with in cages with fronts of metal bars or fine wire-netting,
for they are certain to damage themselves severely against this. In
a few hours this Redwing had cut its forehead by being put into a cage.

with a fine wire-netting front, the only one available at the time ; it
was changed at once into a quickly improvised one with a string-net
front and it now shows no sign of the injury. For the same reason the
wire-netting of the flights should be protected by this string netting
strained about 3 inches inside. This prevents the birds injuring
themselves as they are rather liable when suddenly alarmed, in their
early days, to go full tilt at the wire ; the string netting just breaks the
shock and bounces them back and they soon give up the idea of flying
against it.
Neither Fieldfares nor Redwings appear at all difficult to " meat
off " ; the former were given apple together with some crushed dog
biscuit moistened to a crumbly paste with boiling water to which were
added a few soaked grocer's currants, and some insectile mixture. A
few mealworms were also given and earthworms when available.
For the first day or so they only ate the apple, then the currants
were picked out and now (eight weeks after capture) they eat the
biscuit greedily and practically ignore the apple, though they still
have it. The currants are the favourite food of them all.
No full description of the song of the Fieldfare seems to be given in
any of the bird-books at my disposal, so it should be rather interesting
to hear what it is like if I am successful in keeping them in good health
through the spring and summer. I propose keeping the two cock-birds
just out of sight of each other.
Seebohm describes the song of the Fieldfare as " a wild desultory
warble Bewick, writing of the Redwing, says " like the Fieldfare
they leave us in the spring for which reason their song is quite unknown
to us, but is said to be very pleasing ". 1 Bewick further mentions the
interesting fact that " the Romans kept them and fed them with a sort
of paste made from bruised figs and flour and various other kinds of
food to improve the delicacy and flavour of their flesh ".
With Fieldfares, of course, it is quite easy to distinguish the sexes--
the male bird showing much more slaty-blue both on the head and
[ x A writer in British Birds of March, 1926, describes the song of the Redwing
as heard at Reading in January : " The phrases of the song were so varied and
the pauses so few and short as to be reminiscent of a well-trained Hartz

neck and lower back than the hen and the upper breast is of a deeper
colour--I think pale dull orange would describe the shade--and it is
more heavily spotted. The cocks I have vary a good deal in colour ;
one has a much deeper coloured breast, and in the other the bluey shade
on the head is more intense. Another distinguishing feature is the
partially yellow and black mandibles of the cock birds. With the
Redwing the differences are practically non-existent. I wonder if any
member knows of any definite plumage distinction ?

Some people, who probably consider themselves to be sportsmen,
cannot resist the temptation to kill every unusual bird that makes its
appearance in the country-side, a fact which accounts for the scarcity
of several species, such as the Hoopoe and Golden Oriole, that might
become established if only they were left alone. The following cutting
from The Gamekeeper , which has been sent us by Mr. 0. Beever, refers
to an unfortunate Ring-necked Parrakeet which had escaped from
captivity and which might at least have been left in peace :--
" When out rabbiting extraordinary ' bags ' are sometimes obtained
and a local party had a somewhat unusual experience last week. One of
their number espied a bird flying towards him, the flight of *which he
could not identify, so he attracted his companion's attention. ' It's a
snipe,' said one. 4 No it isn't,' retorted another, ' it's a hawk. Look
at its flight.' ' Well, here goes,' said the third as he raised his gun and
fired. ' Bang, bang.' The noise apparently attracted the bird for it
flew into a neighbouring tree and gazed inquiringly at the sportsmen.
&amp;lt; Bang, bang, bang,' went the guns, and finally a forlorn bundle of
feathers dropped to the ground with a sickening thud. Even then the
sportsmen's curiosity was not satisfied for they were still unable to
identify their victim. In due course the body was sent to me and on
examination proved to be a female ring-necked Parroquet from far-
away India. Evidently escaped from captivity, the bird had apparently
had a good time, for it was in excellent condition in spite of the previous
hard weather with which we have been favoured in this locality."

We should like to congratulate our member, Mr. Satya Charan Law,
of Calcutta, upon whom the degree of Ph.D. has been conferred by the
University of Calcutta on account of his work in Zoology and Aviculture.
In the account of the Foreign Birds at the recent Crystal Palace
show, a Conure, exhibited by Mr. Whitley was referred to as " a bird
which neither the judge nor anyone else could identify ", and further
that " more would be heard about it in the near future This particular
bird had baffled everybody who had seen it for some time past, and
finally Mr. Whitley was persuaded to send it to the Natural History
Museum for identification. There it was examined by at least three of
the most competent ornithologists in the country, who decided that it
belonged to an undescribed species, and was unnamed. We understand
that Mr. N. B. Kinnear, of the Natural History Museum, has now named
it after its owner, Mr. Herbert Whitley, and it is proposed to publish
a coloured plate of it in the Avicultueal Magazine before long.
Mr. Alfred Ezra's collection has been augmented by the following
rarities, all of which were recently imported by Mr. Walter Goodfellow :
One Count Raggi's, one Magnificent, two Princess Stephanie's, two
Lawe's Six-plumed and two Superb Birds of Paradise ; two Manucodes,
one Blue-tailed Pitta, two Fairy Blue-birds, two Yellow-fronted
Ground Doves, two Grey-breasted Ground Doves, one Green-winged
King Parrakeet, two Black-headed Cat-birds, one Stella Lory, one
Timor Lory, two Mitchell's Lorikeets, two Green-naped Lorikeets,
one Black-capped Lory, three Superb, three Black-capped, four
Lilac-crowned, one Jambu, one Gestro, and three Magnificent Fruit
Pigeons.
The awarding of medals for the breeding of species for the first
time had got rather behind-hand of late, but arrangements have been
made to issue them more promptly in future, where there is no doubt
that the species has not been previously bred in the United Kingdom.
But we should like to mention here that now that ornithologists are
paying so much attention to the naming of geographical races of birds,
and calling them sub-species under separate names, it might happen
that some member would succeed in breeding a bird which was merely

a sub-species or local race of a species that had been previously bred, and
in such a case it is unlikely that the Council would award a medal.
In the Condor of January-February, 1926, Dr. Casey A. Wood writes
a long and interesting article entitled " Lessons in Aviculture from.
English Aviaries ", in which he describes a motor-tour which he under-
took in 1924, accompanied by Mrs. Casey Wood and our Honorary
Secretary, to some of the principal private aviaries in the south and
middle counties of England. The author compares our inhospitable
climate with the beautiful climate of California, where he hopes to
encourage a liking for aviculture. He was very impressed with what
he saw of aviculture here, and suggests to his compatriots of the Pacific
Coast that they should take advantage of the age-long experience of
their Transatlantic cousins.

THE PROBLEMS OF BIRD PROTECTION 1
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.996640125" page_id="56220334"  page_num="112" year="" vol="">
Birds in England is the title of a very carefully thought-out treatise-
on the subject of the protection of bird life in this country, and of all
of the problems which this involves. Changes are constantly taking
place in the bird population, and where one species declines another
increases, and the probability is that, at the present time there are
quite as many, if not more, birds in England now than at any period.
But, although there may be more individuals, a good many of these
are of the less desirable kinds, and some of the finest species have gone.
There are several contributory causes to the changes that have
occurred. The drainage of marsh-lands has removed the breeding sites
of some of our Waders ; the extravagant extent to which game-
preservation was carried out in the Victorian era accounted for the
ruthless massacre of such fine species as the Peregrine, Buzzard, Eagles,,
and Owls, while the protection of the coverts has undoubtedly been
beneficial to many other species. The collector of skins and eggs is
probably responsible for the final extermination of several species that

were so rare as to make their dead skins and egg-shells of value. In
fact the author has no use for the collector, who he regards as the root
of most of the evil that has been wrought.
The ruthless destruction of the birds of prey, Nature's Police, whose
dutv it is to keep the smaller fry within bounds, has led to the abnormal
increase of certain species such as the Starling and the Sparrow, and
thus upset the balance of Nature to the detriment of mankind.
These and other problems are thoroughly and ably discussed in
the volume before us, while chapters are devoted to the work of such
naturalists as Gilbert White, Montagu, Bewick, Jardine, and finally
Hudson.
We heartily commend this book to all who have the welfare of our
native birds at heart.

The Riviera is such a favourite resort of English people during the
winter and early spring months that a book dealing with all of the birds
that occur there was much needed, and we congratulate our member,
Mr. Collingwood Ingram, on having produced a work that cannot but
be of extreme value to all who are interested in the ornithology of that
favoured district. The author's father, the late Sir William Ingram,
a keen lover of birds and for many years a member of the Avicultural
Society, owned a villa near Monte Carlo, and there his son spent much
of his early life and, inheriting a love for birds, kept careful notes on
the various species he met with, notes which have now been amplified
by all the available records existing, and developed to form a book
containing a complete list of all of the birds that are known to have
occurred in the Cote d'Azur, from the Esterel Mountains to the
Italian frontier.
The spring is by far the most interesting time to study birds in the
Riviera, for the waves of migrants, after crossing the Mediterranean
by night, break upon the shore and in the morning may be noticed in
1 Birds of the Riviera, being an account of the Avifauna of the Cote d'Azur

all the undergrowth along the coast before continuing their journey
northwards. After a night of inclement weather every bush may teem
with Nightingales, all of which disperse in a day or two.
Unfortunately almost every bird is considered to be edible, and only
appreciated for this quality, so that when a large party of Bee-eaters
attempted to set up a breeding colony in a steep bank under the village
of Biot, the young were all killed for eating purposes as soon as they were
large enough, and after a second attempt and like reception they failed
to return again.
The Quail might still be common in England every summer were it
not for the hostile reception afforded it on first landing in Europe.
All who contemplate a visit to the Riviera should take with them
a copy of Mr. Ingram's book.

Sir, --No doubt many members have now become possessed of some
of the recently imported Nyasa Lovebirds, and I think an exchange
of views or reports on observation will be of interest to others.
I purchased four of these birds about three weeks ago, and after
hours of observation I cannot yet sex them, and have concluded that,
until placed into suitable breeding quarters they never will be definitely
sexed.
They are extremely active in climbing, and very swift in flight,
and utter a quite pleasing note. They are very fond of millet-spray,
and my own four specimens clear quite four sprays per day, besides a
staple diet of equal parts of Canary and white millet
I have tried them with every conceivable kind of fruit, which so far
they just ignore.
I have found them very destructive to woodwork, and can be
amused with suitable twigs with the bark left on, which they
apparently enjoy stripping.
As the habitat of the species is confined to the neighbourhood of
the Shire River, a malarious district in Nyasaland, it is highly probable

Sir, --At the recent meeting of the Council a vote of thanks to the
Hon. Secretary and Treasurer was carried unanimously.
I think that Miss Knobel's work is appreciated by all on the
Council, but I doubt whether the members in general realize how much
the Society is indebted to her.
The duties of Secretary and Treasurer provide almost daily work
throughout the year, and the amount of correspondence is continually
increasing, and I understand that during the past year Miss Knob el
wrote over nine hundred letters in this connexion.
Continual care and judgment is required in dealing with the money
matters. We have lately passed through a difficult time, and it is owing
to our Secretary's skill and hard work that our Society is in its present
comparatively flourishing condition. May I urge members to pay their
subscriptions punctually, and thus save letters of personal application ?
The Magazine cannot be produced at its present high standard on
our annual income with the present membership, and any donations
will be gratefully received.

Above all it is desirable to increase onr membership, and all should
do their best to obtain new members. With a membership of 600 the
Magazine could be produced so as to pay its way. Until that number is

and management will be required to make both ends meet.

By the Marquess op Tavistock
About three years ago, disgusted by the losses and poor breeding
results experienced when keeping a large and valuable collection of
Parrakeets in ranges of aviaries of the usual type, I decided on an
entirely new venture and constructed movable aviaries which, by the
use of wooden rollers, could be shifted on to fresh ground each year.
The site available was a meadow, fairly well sheltered, except from the
east, but possessing the drawback of being exceedingly wet in rainy
weather, owing to the absence of any fall in the ground to encourage
drainage. Each aviary is about 24 ft. long, 8 ft. high, and 8 ft. wide,
and normally contains one breeding pair of birds only. The entire
aviary, including the floor, is covered with in. mesh wire netting,
with an inner lining of very thick inch mesh netting for the few birds
I have that can bite the thinner wire--Alexandrine, Pileated and
Barnard's Parrakeets being the chief offenders in this respect. The
 |in. mesh defeats rats, which are very numerous all round, but it does
not entirely exclude mice, especially young ones. Grass quickly grows
through the meshes of the floor netting, and in a very short time it
is completely covered. Practically all ledges and framework are on
the outside of the wire, so that no droppings can collect on them and
the birds cannot destroy the wood. The bottom frame is made extra
stout and strong so as not to crack easily when the aviary is being

lifted on to the rollers for the annual move. Moving is done in autumn
and the old site is afterwards heavily salted and limed. Having observed
by experiment with birds at liberty, that even such tropical species
as the Hooded Parrakeet (Psephotus dissimilis) can pass the winter
out of doors if sheltered from wind and wet, I originally had only
hanging shelters made, wdiich were entirely open at the bottom, but
were so arranged that the birds could find protection no matter what
the direction of the wind happened to be. This plan was not an entire
success. It seemed to suit Kings, Crimson-wings, Ringnecks and their
allies, wdien not breeding, but in a bad summer when the nights were
cold the mortality among the unfledged young was great, and it did
not suit the Broadtailed Parrakeets at all, mainly, I think, because
they would not take advantage of the shelters but insisted on sitting
and roosting on the open perches till they were ill with cold and
exposure. In stormy weather during the warmer months of the year
there were also occasional losses from pneumonia, apparently of the
aspergillary kind. I therefore did away with most of the hanging
shelters and constructed a shelter shed about three feet wide at the
end of each aviary, boarding the end up completely and lighting it
by small windows, protected by ware netting. The floor of the shelter
is formed by three sliding zinc trays filled, with sand, and the perches
are so arranged that all droppings fall in the middle of the trays and
not on the edges, or on the frames on which the trays run. Once a
month the sand is collected in a bucket; the trays are taken out and
scrubbed ; the entire interior of the shelter is sprayed with " Budge "
and water, and the earth beneath the trays is liberally sprinkled with
salt to discourage the growth of fungi, moulds and bacilli. In the
back of the shelter there is a door, but human access to the flight is
gained only by a door in the far end of the flight itself, two doors in
the shelter being productive of draughts. Every effort is made to
render the shelter bone-dry in all weathers, and cracks in the wood
are stopped up from outside with putty. There is a felt roof over the
wood and over that corrugated iron. In one side of the shelter there
is a little door about 18 in. square on the inside of wdiich food dishes
are hung on a wire bracket. The birds gain access to the flight through
a hole in the front of the shelter, near the top, on a level with the

perches and near the food-bracket end. There is a window in the back
of the shelter exactly opposite the hole, so that the birds, seeing the
light in front of them, enter more readily from the flight. The hole
itself is closed by a slide, and the birds are driven in at night and shut
up throughout the year. When first introduced into the aviary the
birds are shut up in the shelter for a few days in order that they may
grow thoroughly accustomed to it and learn where the food is. Should
they prove very obstinate about re-entering the shelter after their first
day in the flight a " wing " of string netting on a wooden frame is
hung up to guide them to the opening and prevent them from continually
breaking past the person who is trying to drive them in. Most birds
quickly learn what is expected of them, and even young ones usually
go in without trouble after a couple of days. Bourke's Parrakeets are
by far the most foolish and intractable, and it requires a good deal
of patience at first to train them. In the case of Many-colours the top
of the shelter must have an inner lining of canvas a few inches below
the real roof, for, if suddenly startled in the night, they are prone to
dash violently upwards and fracture their skulls. Grass Parrakeets
of the genus Neophema , in addition to the canvas roof, need to have
all the windows of the shelter protected by taut string netting, a few
inches from the wire and the roof and end of the flight must be similarly
treated. To prevent them from biting holes in the string netting and
getting between the string and the wire, smooth boards about 8 in.
wide must be fastened right along each side of the flight immediately
below the string netting. Grass Parrakeets are poor climbers, and the
boards give them, no foothold from which to bite the string netting
above them. Bourke's must have the whole of their shelter and the
whole of their flight lined, and the string netting must be carefully
watched and tightened when it stretches slack. They have a perfectly
fiendish ingenuity in discovering a slack or unprotected spot against
which to crack their fragile skulls. They do not, however, bite holes
in the netting. In the back of the shelter, not far from the feeding door,
is a kind of box, zinc-lined, with a space of a few inches between the
zinc and the outer wood. There is a door in the side of the box which
can be reached by a person standing outside at the back of the shelter.
The front of the box is open to the interior of the shelter from which it

<bodyText confidence="0.999763305555556" page_id="56220346"  page_num="120" year="" vol="">
is separated by wire netting only. This box is large enough to contain,
if necessary, three good-sized brooder lamps for heating purposes,
the zinc lining and air space between it and the outer wood preventing
the danger of fire. One lamp prevents the temperature falling below
freezing point except in the severest weather. Two maintain a nice
warmth and three make the shelter really cosy, even when it is very
cold. The possibility of heating the shelter in three different degrees
is a very great ad vantage when dealing with the more valuable and
delicate birds. New arrivals that have not yet moulted in England
are often much, safer if provided with a bit of artificial heat during their
first summer. Fairly hardy birds that arrive in late autumn or winter
can, with judicious management, be got into their breeding quarters
months before it would be possible if the shelters were unheated, and
in this way one can often avoid wasting a year before they are ready
to nest. A moulting adult, or a youngster not many weeks out of the
nest, is sometimes, when kept in an unheated aviary, upset by the
first chilly weather of autumn. To return such a bird to a cold aviary
after its recovery is to court disaster, and the alternative of keeping
it caged in a warm room until the following spring has little to
recommend it; if the invalid be one of a breeding pair, the lack of
exercise seriously affects its value for stock purposes, while if it be young,
the same adverse factor inflicts an almost irreparable check on its
growth at the most critical period of its life. On the other hand,
if the bird be returned to a moveable aviary with a heated shelter,
it frequently passes through the winter without further trouble and
spring finds it in perfect health and vigour. Little need be said about
the aviary flight. At the end nearest the shelter the roof overhangs
about a couple of feet and there is a little protection at the sides so
that the birds can use a dry and fairly sheltered perch without having
to enter the shelter itself. There is also some wind and rain
protection at the opposite end of the aviary near the top, while over
the centre of the flight there is a circular piece of boarding a few feet
square to provide extra shade. In the end of the flight, opposite
the shelter, a small door about 18 in. square gives access to a
bracket on which hang the bath and fruit vessels. No seed is kept
in the outer part of the aviary, but a handful of oats is thrown in every

week to sprout among the grass. For catching purposes I have a box
of wire netting on a wooden frame with an inner lining of taut string
netting to prevent birds hurting themselves against the wire. This
box can be hung on to the top corner of the end of the aviary flight
by means of two hooks. A small inward and upward opening door
in the same top corner of the aviary flight is then pulled up by a piece
of string some yards in length, which, is passed through a mesh of the
roof wire, one end being fastened to the lip of the door, and the other
being held in the hand of the person doing the catching. A slide
closing the catching-box and separating it from the aviary is then moved
back and everything is ready. The person holding the string, the
other end of which is fastened to the raised catching-door, takes his
stand in the centre of the flight, while his assistant gently drives the
bird into the corner, where it either runs along the perch and walks
into the catching-box, or flies straight in. Before it has time to
discover its mistake the person slacks the string which was holding
the little hinged door against the roof of the aviary, the door drops
down of its own weight and the bird is caught without netting or
handling. All that remains is to push forward and fasten the slide
of the catching-box and readjust the little top door of the flight. It
is important never to forget to close the catching-box slide, a mistake
that is easily made if one is hurried or absent-minded. If you do
forget, directly the catching-box is unhooded, the bird sails out to
liberty and your catching has to be done over again under far more
difficult circumstances ! I never, if I can possibly avoid it, catch a
bird by shutting it into the shelter and then netting it. It makes them
very nervous of the shelter, where it is important that they should
feel perfectly secure. A wary and obstinate bird that will not enter
the catching-box can be compelled to do so by hanging up a. " wing 55
like that recommended for birds which refuse to re-enter the
shelter.
Nest-boxes are fixed up inside the shelter near the end furthest
from the feeding-door, lamp box and hole giving entrance into the
flight. A sitting bird is less likely to be disturbed if her box is as far
as possible from the feeding-door, while by having the feeding-door
and entrance hole on the same side, though of course at right angles

to one another, yon do not, every time you feed, drive out into the
flight a shy bird that is sheltering from the cold.
So much for the aviaries themselves ; what has been the effect
on the health of the inmates ? Infectious diseases, like tuberculosis
and septicaemia, have vanished altogether. The only disease of a
possibly infectious character has been pneumonia, which seems to
be the aspergillary kind. A mould or fungus which usually grows
on musty grain and other vegetable matter is said, under certain con-
ditions, to develop a malignant character and attack the tissues of
living birds. It is a warm-weather ailment which occurs from May to
October w T hen it is muggy and violent rain-storms alternate with sunny
intervals. I am hoping to defeat it by having the shelters and food
perfectly dry and by disinfecting wdth Budge and salt at regular
intervals.
What I may call obscure and miscellaneous ailments, such as sudden
death from heart or kidney trouble, have been few and for the most
part confined to two or three species. They may have been due to
wrong feeding, as there have been no cases since I put the birds most
liable on a seed mixture containing no hemp, sunflower nor peanuts.
Chills have been the main and only serious cause of loss, which
perhaps is not surprising seeing that quite three-quarters of my present
collection is composed of the less hardy and less easily kept species.
Here again I am hoping that the new type of shelter and the driving
in of all birds at night throughout the year will greatly improve the
situation. It took me some time to learn that the most unhealthy
months of the year, when chills are most frequent and heating of the
shelters is most necessary, are not the coldest and wettest months,
but the late summer and autumn. In January and February, when
there is ice and snow and constant slush and the flights are partly
under water for weeks at a time, the death and sickness rate sinks to
zero. They begin to rise at the end of June, to decline again in late
November. Of course the moult has something to do with it, but it
is by no means always the moulting birds that fall sick in the latter
half of the year, and I can only conclude that the higher temperature
fosters the rapid growth of those germs which take advantage of a bird&amp;apos;s
slightly lowered vitality due to a change in temperature. In winter

the bird's vitality is tried, perhaps to an even greater extent, by the
weather, but the microbes, being even more adversely affected by the
cold than the birds, no great harm ensues.
Perhaps the most encouraging result of the new aviaries has been
the effect on the fertility of the birds and the stamina of the young
reared. Under the old regime some pairs would not nest at all, the
percentage of clear eggs was very high, and the great majority of
young birds that left the nest were degenerate and weakly, sometimes
to the eye, and always when themselves tested for breeding. I am
inclined to think that this is the almost universal experience of those
who breed the larger or more delicate Parrakeets in fixed aviaries.
The first generation are not equal to the parents ; the second generation
is markedly inferior ; in the third generation (if you get one) you are
done and have to buy imported stock. In the movable aviaries
practically every hen goes to nest that might reasonably be expected
to do so. The fertility of the cocks is high. I do still get infertile
eggs, but the cause is nearly always a non-physical one, the cock taking
a dislike to his partner, or falling in love with a neighbour.
Ring-necked Parrakeets used to have some deformed young in
every nest. Now the young are always perfect. They show signs
of coming into breeding condition when 10 months old and nest when
2 years old, although the cocks are still in immature plumage. It
is rather curious that a fine adult pair which bred last year in the
Black Cockatoo's large aviaries, which are now the only fixed ones,
were the only pair of birds in the collection to produce defective young.
These aviaries have only been up three years.
Hen Barrabands in the movable aviaries come into breeding
condition when 10 months old and hen Rock Peplars the same. In
ordinary aviaries they always take two years to mature and cocks
reared under such conditions are nearly always sterile. Cock Barra-
bands bred in the movable aviaries were finer and more vigorous
at two years old than their imported parents, but a cock bred in a
fixed aviary was never any good for breeding, even after years of
complete liberty. He was lively enough and paired, but Ijnever got
a fertile egg with him.
According to the old writers, aviary-bred cock Crimson-wings

are three years before they breed ; a Crimson-wing Princess of Wales
hybrid, hatched last summer began to display when 5 months old
and is now (February) so anxious to mate that he will come up to the
end of the aviary and display to me, although he has never been patted
or tamed.
Blue-winged Grass Parrakeets, bred in fixed aviaries, often showed
a tendency to grow defective flight feathers. The cocks were always
sterile and the hens laid soft-shelled eggs or died egg-bound. One of
these cocks bred after a year in a movable aviary. The young showed
extraordinary hardiness and vigour. They actually began to display and
feed one another when little more than three months old and continued
to do so in the very middle of the winter when they were in full moult
and their tail feathers half in quills. They ran about most happily
among ice and snow ; and they had only one brooder lamp to warm
the aviary shelter, which did not prevent the water from freezing
on the coldest nights. Yet, in a general way, Neophema venusta
is a decidedly delicate bird, and imported specimens in the finest con-
dition often need artificial heat, even in summer, if they are to escape
fatal chills. Why there should be such an enormous difference in
the breeding stamina and freedom from infectious disease when birds
are kept in movable aviaries, I find it difficult to say. My old aviaries
were extremely clean, the soil was disinfected, the turf changed, fresh
green food was provided daily and only one pair of birds occupied each
compartment; yet the breeding results were wretched and the rate
or mortality was far too high, although as long as they lived the birds
were usually in perfect plumage and excited the admiration of visitors.
In the light of the last three years' experience never again will I go
back to the fixed aviary with soil or sanded floor, and I should strongly
advise all who keep Parrakeets--and perhaps certain other families
of birds also--to follow my example if they possibly can. I am quite
sure that they would get better results in a small movable aviary
than in a fixed one twice or three times the size. Of course it is rather
easier to make fixed aviaries nice-looking than movable ones, but he
is indeed a poor avicuituralist who puts handsome architecture before
the health and longevity of his birds.

aviaries, I should construct them rather on the principle of an up-to-date
dog kennel, with a tiled floor that could be washed down at frequent
intervals and thoroughly disinfected. Green food would be brought
in daily and kept fresh in jars of clean water. On the floor would be
a very large zinc tray containing fresh turf and sprouting oats, the
turf being renewed as often as possible. Goat-keepers find that their
animals do well when moved daily on to fresh pasture and also when
their green forage is cut and brought to them in a stable, but if the
goats are tethered constantly on the same ground they are apt to
sicken and die. I have a strong suspicion that the same principle
works in the case of birds. Either they must have a frequent change
of soil and " pasture ", or earth, sand, and herbage must only be
presented to them in a way which ensures it being absolutely
uncontaminated by droppings.

I have elsewhere recorded that a female Great Bustard, which,
with others, I received from Spain, as a nestling, in 1897, died last
January after being in my collection 28J years. As this bird, with
others of her kind, have lived for many years with me, it may be useful
if I state what treatment has appeared to suit them, in the rather
bleak climate of East Yorkshire.
To begin with, the staple food they have always had has been
sound barley-meal three-quarters, with good Crissel, or poultry-meal
of good quality one quarter, scalded with hot water, and mixed into
a crumbly (not sticky) mass. This, with a little boiled potato, a few
bits of stale bread, and some cabbage leaves, is wljat the birds practically
lived upon. As to the cabbage, it is well to wire the head to a post
or fence, so that the birds can peck at it without soiling it on the ground.
My Bustards have never cared for uncooked meat, nor have I ever
had one that would more than occasionally take a freshly killed mouse
or Sparrow.
The old bird, which I have just lost, though to the last very shy with
strangers, would come gently up to me, if alone, and take from my

hand small bits of cooked meat, potato, brussel sprouts, and, before
anything else, " Yorkshire Pudding," which, by the way, all Cranes
that I have kept have been especially fond of !
My Bustards have never seemed to mind dry, frosty weather, so
long as they have been quite protected from wind, and still more from
wind with rain. They have always had dry sheds with plenty of
peat-moss litter on the floors, facing south, the front partly boarded
up, but so as not to exclude the winter sun, the upper part wired up
with small-meshed netting to keep out small birds, which in winter
will leave little in the food-pans. Unfortunately Bustards, like some
other birds, Cranes, for instance, can not be trusted to take advantage
of shelter provided for them, and have to be driven in if the weather
threatens ; or, better still, they should be kept in if the weather is
doubtful in the morning. In summer and early autumn my birds
remained out all night, for they can stand a certain amount of summer
rain with impunity if there are bushes in their enclosure, against which
they will stand to protect themselves against wind.
But though they no doubt benefit by opportunities for exercise,
it is rather disappointing to find how little natural food they seem to
find, even in a large enclosure with grass left long. In fact it has
been, in my case, quite exceptional to see the Bustards " foraging
They are fond of dusting, and should have access to some hollow in
the ground, filled up with sand and ashes. My birds have been fed
twice a day, with additional tit-bits supplied by myself as an " extra
It only remains to mention the extreme nervousness of Great
Bustards in confinement, their liability to be seized with paroxysms
of terror at the sight of some unfamiliar object such as a woman's
dress, a child, or dog. Also the remarkable brittleness of the large
bones of a Bustard, which greatly contributes to the seriousness of
any accident. My first Great Bustard came to me in an unlined
basket with both legs and one wing hopelessly shattered. In addition,
I have known three adult Bustards, kept in private grounds, each
destroyed by dashing itself against the fences, startled by the
unexpected visit of a stranger (to the bird), two of these birds being
my own.

These birds are so popular that it is not necessary to give a lengthy
description of them. Everybody knows their hooked beaks, their
feet with two fingers rather than toes, their dazzling plumage and
their power of imitating human speech.
Parrots and Parrakeets constitute the order of Psittaciform.es ;
the larger species are usually called Parrots and the smaller Parrakeets,
but these designations do not follow any scientific classification.
In confinement these birds are kept according to their kind, either
chained to a perch or in metal cages or in aviaries. It must never be
forgotten when housing them how powerful an implement for
destruction they possess in their beaks.
The Parrot family is so large and so various that it is difficult to
give a general description which will apply to all the groups, so that we
must describe the care and the food required by each of the families
into which we shall divide them.
For all that, we may here insert some account of their management
and their diseases.
At least three-quarters of the diseases from which Parrots suffer
in Europe have their origin in chills, and if the bird is not too seriously
attacked it may be saved by being placed in a confined space in a
temperature of 85* to 90*. Great heat will do more to cure it than
any medicine, and every one who has a number of birds should set
aside as a hospital a room heated preferably by gas or electricity.
Where this means of heating cannot be employed a stove may be
used, but those which burn either coke or anthracite are open to the
objection of requiring to be stoked day and night every two or three
hours if an even temperature is to be maintained. People who have
only a few birds might save the life of a sick one by placing it in an
incubator modified according to the needs of a bird which can fly
and which requires light to feed by.
It is a wise precaution always to keep new arrivals in quarantine
for a week or two at least, for Parrots and Parrakeets are subject to
divers contagious and incurable diseases, which they may contract

cither in the bird-dealer's shop or on board ship. To neglect this
precaution is to expose oneself sooner or later to disastrous consequences.
Egg-binding is not uncommon, at least among certain species,
and breeding hens should be kept under observation as far as possible
without disturbing them. It may be caused either by the hen being
kept in too low a temperature or by lack of vigour. A Finch will
SDinetimes lay her first egg safely after having looked puffy and wretched
for some hours ; and the hens of some foreign Sparrows may be egg-
bound with their first and afterwards complete their clutch without
further trouble ; but among Parrots the case is different ; if a hen
is ill with her first egg she will never lay again without treatment.
The treatment consists in placing her in a very hot place just as though
she were suffering from a very severe chill. When a Parrot has had
trouble with her first egg, she will have it with all the others if her
owner is rash enough to replace her in the aviary and to allow her to
nest as soon as she has laid her first egg. But the truth is, as a general
rule, that a hen which has suffered from egg-binding is useless to try
and breed from, for she will have the same trouble with each egg that
she tries to lay.
It will possibly be useful to warn intending breeders of Parrots
that a male which has any serious defect in his feet is of no use to breed
from and no eggs will be fertilized by him. A defective wing is not
so important. Parrots and Parrakeets differ in this way from the
Passeres.
A sick Parrot may be detected by the usual signs ; ruffled plumage,
half-closed eyes, head tucked under the scapulars. The following
is an excellent way of disco vering whether a bird is sick or only asleep :
if both its feet are on the perch and its head hidden away, it
is certainly ill, but if one foot is tucked up there is nothing much the
matter.
The only really effective way of disinfecting a cage or an aviary
is to expose it entirely to the flame of a plumber's lamp. The best
disinfectant for the ground is a strong dose of sea salt; lime is useless.
Aviaries may be of two kinds, movable or fixed. I personally
make use of fairly large rectangular wooden aviaries for the majority
of my Parrots, 24 by 8 feet high by 8 feet wide, completely covered,

even the bottom, with wire netting \ in. mesh and provided with w&amp;apos;ooden
shelters. These aviaries can be moved bodily and by means of rollers
transported annually to a fresh piece of ground. They are safe from
small marauding animals and the grass which grows through the netting
supplies abundant fresh green food. Every year when the aviary
is moved the ground on which it stood is disinfected so that when it is
used again it is perfectly wholesome.
Fixed aviaries should be built in such a way that they can be
kept scrupulously clean. The floor should be cemented as for a kennel.
The usual custom of having the floors of earth and grass-covered is
bad. All that can be done in renewing the grass and sand if keeping
the same species of Parrots there, though they may breed, they will
certainly fall ill and die. Naturally this will happen sooner to the
rarer more delicate kinds than to the commoner and more robust.
Paint and varnish should not be used in a Parrot aviary, but
carbonide, once it is really dry, is safe.
Aviary keepers need never be afraid of allowing a Parrot to bathe
whatever the temperature may be. Even wdien newly imported
they never contract illness through bathing.

New Zealand possesses some curious and large Parrots having
long dark-coloured beaks which recall those of birds of prey.
The first, the Kaka Parrot (Nestor meridionalis) lives in the two
islands, frequenting the forests ; it is omnivorous and particularly
fond of seeds, fruit, and larvae, which last it finds under the bark
of trees. Its plumage is olive brown above, each feather having a
darker tip ; its lower parts, neck, rump, and the lower part of the
back are deeply tinged with red on a greyish olive ground ; the cheeks
are tinged with orange yellow, the head with dirty white, and. red under
the wings. The female only differs in having a weaker beak.
Although rare in captivity the Kaka lives well either in a cage
or aviary ; it should be fed on seeds and fruit, potato, carrot, biscuit,
and a little cooked meat.

The Kea Parrot (A 7 , notabilis) is larger than the preceding, and its
beak is longer and slighter. It is dull olive brown, each feather
bordered with black ; the wings above and the rump are red tinted,
underneath orange red. The hen bird is slightly duller.
This species lives in the mountains of the Southern Island ; it is
omnivorous, but since the country has been inhabited, it has developed
a pronounced and criminal taste for mutton fat; and these Parrots
pierce the loins of sheep in order to devour the fat enclosing the kidneys.
In captivity the Kea requires the same treatment as the Kaka.
It has occasionally been imported, but not nearly as often as it might
be, since it is a most engaging species when kept in an aviary. A
pair will play together for hours and show great interest in their
surroundings.
In New Zealand, on account of its propensity for killing sheep,
it is regarded as an outlaw&amp;apos; and a price is put upon its head, which
results in large numbers being killed. In fact the Government of
New Zealand seem to be doing their best to exterminate this Parrot,
one of the most interesting of the Parrot tribe.

Lories constitute one of the most beautiful families of Parrots : they
are natives of Oceania and are remarkable for their vivid colouring,
their amusing ways, and their tameness. Some of them have short
square tails, some have them pointed and as long as their wings. They
have small delicate beaks and their tongues end in a brush.
Lories feed on nectar and pollen, on fruits and buds ; some kinds
live almost entirely on the honey in eucalyptus flowers.
They are usually delicate in captivity as regards warmth and food.
The Lorikeets of Australia are the only really hardy species. The
other Lories, however, can be maintained alive for many years if they
are kept in an even temperature and wrell fed.
For their staple food they should have bread and milk made with
sugar or honey, which should be renewed twice daily and made by
pouring hot milk on bread put to soak the day before ; the mixture

should be fairly liquid. My Swainson's and Red-collared Lorikeets
are satisfied with bread and milk and live for years without ever being
ill and without apoplectic fits, which are common among Lories.
For other kinds some fruit should be given along with bread and
milk, or Mellins food. Oranges should not be given. It is a wise
precaution to thin the milk with barley water.
Many people give their Lorikeets canary-seed, which I consider
unnecessary, and other seeds are harmful. Lories which can be kept
in outdoor aviaries, particularly Trichioglossus, must not be exposed
to full sunlight. Lories will breed in confinement either in or out
of doors ; they should always have either boxes or logs, to spend the
night in. Pairs are usually very quarrelsome, but will sometimes
live together without accidents, and one or two dozen of these
magnificent birds in an aviary looks very beautiful.
It is necessary to take great precautions when importing Lories ;
while at sea they should be kept in a closed place and never be exposed
to the open air. When they are landed they must be carefully kept
under cover and in a high temperature until they are well acclimatized.
It is for want of these precautions that so many losses occur on the
voyage and after landing, and this is the main reason why Lories
which are so abundantly and cheaply obtainable in the ports of
Oceania and in Singapore only reach Europe in small numbers and
command such high prices.
The first group is made up of rather large Lories which have square
but rather long tails. Most of the birds contained in this group are
quietly coloured. The following have been bred in confinement.
The Black Lory (Chaleopittacus ater), from New Guinea, which
is purplish black, the tail greenish yellow and purplish red. It is
imported from time to time, together with a closely allied species
from Mysol (C. bernsteini), which only differs in having red thighs.
The Red-eronted Lory (C. scintellatus) has also been imported
several times from the same places. It is green with a red face ; the
neck and back and under sides are streaked with yellow.
Lories of the genus Eos are much like the preceding, only much
smaller and daintier. Nearly all are beautiful bright red variegated
with blue or black. They are rarely imported, for they are delicate

and stand the journey badly. It is to be regretted, for they are
beautiful birds.
The Blue-cheeked Lory ( Eos cyanogenys), from the north-
east of New Guinea, is red with cobalt blue cheeks and black marks
on the wings, tail and belly
The Blue-streaked Lora ( E . reticulata), from Ke Islands, is
likewise red, with little blue spots on a line with the eyes, on the
shoulders, and the end of the back ; black spots on the wings and tail.
The Blue-tailed Lory (E. histrio), from Sangi Island, is red,
with the crown of the head, a line from the eye to the shoulder, the
upper part of the back and the wings, and the breast deep blue ; the
tail also, and black and blue markings on the abdomen and wings.
The Red Lory (E. rubra) is entirely bright red, except for black
tips to the wings, the brick red tail, and a light blue spot in the middle
of the wings. It is a native of the Moluccas. E. goodfelloivi differs
in having pale blue ear coverts, back and thighs purple blue ; it has
been imported for Mr. Brooke.
Wallace's Lory (E. ivallacei) is a native of the islands to the
north of New Guinea. It is like the preceding except that patches
on the wings, belly, and neck are black. E. similarvata is a near
ally from Oli, imported in 1901.
The Violet-necked Lory (E. riciniata), from the Moluccas,
is most frequently imported. It chiefly differs from the preceding
in having a black stomach, and violet neck and nape.
The White-backed Lory (E. fuscata) is very different from the
rest; it is occasionally imported from New Guinea. Its head is brown,
shading into yellow on the crown ; the feathers of the back and chest
are brown with yellow edges ; the underparts are red mingled with
brown ; the wings and tail are brown with blue, yellow, and red tints ;
the lower part of the back is white.
Lories of the genus Loriu$ have shorter tails and larger heads
than the above, thejr are hardier, too, and more commonly imported.
The Purple-capped Lory ( L . domicilla) has been a favourite
cage-bird since the eighteenth century. It conies from Assam and
Amboyna and is very freely imported. The Singapore Market is
always supplied with them, though comparatively few reach Europe.

They are charming birds, tame and usually gentle, though they may
become spiteful when paired. Their colour is a splendid red washed
with yellow on the breast, which is caused by the yellow bases to the
feathers. The wings are green, the primaries spotted with yellow,
and the coverts blue. The crown of the head is black, passing into
violet on the nape.
The Black-capped Lory (L. lory), from the north-east of New
Guinea and the neighbouring islands also reach us fairly often. It is
red with green wings and tail; the crown of the head is black, the
upper part of the back and the belly deep blue. It has been bred in
confinement.
The Jobi Island Lory (L. jobiensis) has also been imported.
Its chief difference consists in having a w T ide red band across the back ;
L. cyanochen, which has a blue nape and&amp;apos;the upper part of the back
to the head, but without the red collar.
The Chattering Lory (L. garrulus) is most commonly brought
over, also the cheapest in the Singapore Market. It is all red except
for green wings and tail and a yellow T band across the shoulders. It
has been bred in Europe and has even been crossed with Swainson's
Lory. Two allied species have been imported-- L. tibialis, which
has no yellow band, and blue thighs ; and L. flavopalliatus, which
has a bright yellow back.
The Solitary Lory ( Calliptilus solitarius), from Fiji, of which
the London Zoological Gardens has had several and Mr. Astley has
possessed two specimens, is like the preceding in miniature. Half
as large, its head and belly are black, its back, wings, tail and nape
green ; shoulders, cheeks, throat and breast red. It is a delightful
and fascinating bird, and has been termed the Ruffed Lory on account
of the long silky feathers surrounding the neck.
The Vini Lories ( Vinia ), from Samoa, and the adjacent islands,
are much like the above. Vinia kuJili differs in having its head green
and a blue nape ; Vinia australis has a green breast and blue crown.
The charming CoripJtili of Haiti and neighbouring islands come in
here. They are exceedingly rare and have never reached us alive ;
they are very small and entirely blue.

Lorikeets and are more in the style of what are called Parrakeets ;
they are rather small and have long pointed tails.
The best known genus is Trichoglossus, of which the popular
Swainson's Lorikeet is the type.
Swainson's Lorikeet ( Trichoglossus novce-hollandice) is about as
big as a Turtle Dove. It is found in East Australia and Tasmania.
It is a beautiful green above, has a blue head, throat, and belly ; the
chest and flanks red and yellow, a spot of the same on the back. It is
by far the most popular species of its whole family, as it is not delicate,
can live out of doors all the year round and breeds freely in an aviary.
The sexes are very much alike, but the hen is slightly smaller than her
mate, with a smaller, rounder head. It has often been reared in
confinement and when acclimatized is quite hardy if given a log to
roost in and a good shelter from cold and damp. It is a clamorous,
playful, active, and amusing bird. When paired it is very spiteful
towards other kinds of Parrots, and the male and female are experts
in the art of combined attack ; in this way they can put to flight
and injure birds larger than themselves. They are rather less vicious
towards others of their owm family and are often quite harmless with
small birds. A Lorikeet without a friend to assist him in fighting
may sometimes become a peaceful inhabitant of a large aviary full
of other Parrots.
Tame Lorikeets stay well at liberty, but wild ones unless paired to
a tame mate generally leave after a wdiile. Hen Swainson's are not
very subject to egg-binding and rear their young even in the middle
of winter.
The Red-collared Lorikeet ( T . rubritorques) takes the place of
the above in North-Western Australia. It differs only in having the
nape of the neck orange r?d and its breast more orange. It behaves
in the same way and breeds as readily in confinement.
The follow-ing species are all much alike and have been imported
from time to time.
The Blue-faced Lorikeet ( T . hamiatodes), from Timior, differs
in having a yellow&amp;apos; breast. It is rarely imported ; its ways are similar
to the preceding, but it is not often in the market.
Forsten's Lorikeet ( T.forsteni ), from Sumbawa (?), is the smallest
and has breast and sides entirely red. It has been bred in an aviary.

The (xREEN-naped Lorikeet (T. cyanogrammus). found from
Ceram to New Guinea, has breast and sides red with blackish markings.
T. nigrigularis takes its place further south ; it is almost identical.
Another, very similar, is found to the west.
T. massena is chiefly distinguished by its bright green collar.
T. brooki is a closely allied subspecies. T. mitchelli, from Lombok,
has a red breast.
The Ornate Lorikeet (T. ornatus), from the Celebes, is not so
much like the others ; it is green with a blue cap and behind the eye
blue ; cheeks and throat, red ; breast, red washed with green. The
tail is short.
Mrs. Johnstone's Lorikeet (T. johnstonice), discovered in 1902
at Mindanao in the Philippines, was brought over by Mr. Goodfellow,
and has been bred in confinement. Its shape is like the preceding ;
its general colouring is green scaled with yellow on the breast, the
forehead, chin, throat, and a line from eye to nape, red.
The Scaly Lorikeet ( Psitteuteles chlorolejridotes) is green, with
breast and the back striated with yellow and green ; red under the
wings. It lives in Australia, has been bred, and behaves like Swainson's
Lory in captivity. A nearly allied species from Timor (P. euteles)
has a grey green head and is light green underneath the body ; it also
has been imported.
The Varied Lorikeet (Ptilosclera versicolor ), from north-west
Australia, is green above the body, the crown red, nape, cheeks and
the breast yellow and mauve.
The Musky Lorikeet ( Glossopsittacus concinnus), also an
Australian, has been fairly often imported, but is delicate. It is a pretty
little green bird with yellow sides, the parotic regions and forehead
are red and the top of the head washed with blue. This Lory exhales
a rather pleasant odour of musk. Gl. pusillus, from South Australia,
has been imported ; it is green with a red face.
New Guinea and the neighbouring islands are peopled with splendid
little Lories, with strange shapes and resplendent colouring ; but
alas ! they never come over to us ( Hypocharmosyna, Charmosynopsis,
Oreopsittacus). But the most beautiful of all perhaps was imported
by Mr. Goodfellow and nested with Mr. Brook.

Stella's Lory (Charmosyna stellce) defies description, its plumage
combining different shades of red, green, violet, blue, and yellow
most exquisitely arranged, and its &amp;apos;form to the tip of its pointed tail
is perfect. This beautiful species is found in south-eastern New
Guinea.
The following species were also imported from New Guinea for
the late Mr. Brooke :--*
Hypocharmosyna wilhelminoe and II. placens , two pretty species
of small size, the former smaller, green, with blue, red, and yellow
marks ; the latter, larger, green also with blue cheeks and red under-
wings.
Charmosynopsis pulchella , whose head, tail, and under parts are
carmine red, with a yellow mark on the nape, back and wings green,
and blue spots on the head and back.
Oreopsitta grandis , a lovely little dark green bird, with the top of
the head, tip of tail, and underwings scarlet, and dark blue cheeks
spotted with white.
To sum up we must mention the small Lories with thick heads
and short tails which have for a long time been considered to belong
to a separate family. One species has been imported to Amsterdam
from New Guinea (Cyclopsittacm melanogenys ), a pretty little green
bird &amp;apos;with a brown and white head and orange under parts. An allied
species, C. diophtalmm , has also been imported, in 1908.
A VERY MIXED AVIARY
By A. H. Barnes
Last year, in January as far as I remember, I purchased a pair of
Bengalese which at once went to nest in a small box cage, but the cock
soon died, for no apparent reason, neither did I trouble to have an
inquest. The hen deserted the nest with three eggs, and I turned her
in with the other common foreigners including a pair of Black-headed
Nuns, by which she was welcomed, and the three sat side by side and
thought of dreamy things, as seems to be their nature. I failed to find
another mate for the hen, and so in despair bought a cock Spice bird.

They were all put into the outdoor aviary, and the Spice bird at once
sang his husky little love-song to the Bengalese, and was accepted by
her, but the Nuns were all against him and chased him away when
he tried to join the family circle. Nothing daunted he built a large
untidy nest of hay, with a little assistance from the lady, but then the
trouble started. On no account would the Nuns allow him to enter
when the Bengalese was inside. About the end of July, however,
things improved and they all became more or less friendly.
I was away for a month, and when I came back there were young
in the nest, to judge by the sounds that issued forth at meal times.
I should think the young were about a fortnight old when I saw the
Nuns also go into the nest and heard squeals and expected cold-blooded
murder to be taking place ; the Spice bird meanwhile got very agitated
outside but had not the pluck to go in after them. However they duly
came out again and as they all seemed very much alive when their
parents went in afterwards I hoped for the best. All went well, and
when four youngsters came out at about a month old they were fed
by their own parents and the Nuns, so much so that when I brought
them indoors I could not catch them all at once and so left the Nuns
and the two smallest youngsters out for another week, during which
they fed them the whole time. I lost one of the young birds in the winter,
also the Bengalese and one Nun, but the remainder are all merry and
bright, and there is very little difference between them and the Spice
bird, the chief difference being that the lacing of the breast is not
quite so distinct in the young birds.
And now the comic part of the whole episode is that the other
morning I heard one of the young birds singing his little husky song,
but he was not singing Bengalese song or that of the Spice bird, he
was giving a very good rendering of the song of a Java Sparrow \
three of which have shared the aviary. I have just bought a pair of
Pekin Bobins and put them, in the aviary, and if I find this precocious
youngster dead with laryngitis I shall at least know that he did his
best but ambition killed him.

By James B. Housden
The beautiful Braekenside Park which I have already mentioned
was a veritable paradise for the naturalist, and the excitement caused
by the sight of fresh birds, fresh flowers, and fresh butterflies, and
the sound of fresh bird songs is not soon forgotten. The number and
variety of birds in this park, much of which is virgin forest, is
extraordinary.
One of the most interesting birds found here is the Mocking Bird
(Mimus polyglottus), the " Mocker " as he is locally called, and one of the
chief of songsters, which possesses not only a song unrivalled in variety
of notes, but also remarkable powers of imitating the songs of other
birds. Some morning one may hear a Robin's song from a tree near by;
a Red Bird answers him, and then an Oriole chimes in, but when one
tries to find the three bright birds he finds only the Mocker. At another
time I mistook one particular bird's melody for that of a Thrush, the
imitation being perfect. I have often been awakened at midnight
on brilliant moonlight nights by his song.
The nest of the Mocker is carelessly made of almost anything he
can find ; I have found it in many strange places, usually with five
bluish green eggs, very much like those of the Catbird.
The Meadowlark (Sturnella magna) is found in great numbers in
the more open grounds, the rich yellow plumage of the throat and
breast, with the prominent black crescent on the breast, is not observable
when the birds are walking in a mule track or on the grass.
It builds a snug arched nest with dried grasses and other material,
lined with finer grasses. Nesting on the ground, its eggs and young
are exposed to many enemies, chief amongst which are snakes which
destroy both eggs and young birds.
The Yellow-headed Blackbird (Xanthocephalus) is found generally
distributed on the prairies in all favourable localities throughout
Texas, collecting to breed in colonies in marshy places, often in company
with the Red-winged Blackbird. In the Yellow-heads the whole head
and neck are a brilliant yellow, the rest of his attire is shining black.
The eggs are from two to six in number, but the usual number is four,

a dull greyish white with small blotches of purplish brown. The
Blue Giosbeak (Guiraca carulea) is found in all the Gulf States from
the Atlantic to the Pacific. The male is brilliant blue, darker across
the middle of the back, the female brownish yellow, darker on the
breast and tail. The young resemble the female. Two broods of young
are usually reared in the season.
The family of Tanagers is remarkable for the number of species,
the gaudy colouring of many, and the interesting fact that they are
confined to the American mainland and adjacent islands.
This family includes approximately (so one American writer
says) three hundred and eighty species; of these only four are
known in Texas. The male of the Louisana Tanager (Piranga ludo-
viciana) is a beautifully coloured bird ; the female is plainly coloured,
but still beautiful with its olive green plumage. They build a shallow
nest, eggs three to five in number greenish blue in colour, speckled
with brown and purple.
The Scarlet Tanager (P. ergtliromelas) is the best known of the four
in the Southern States ; he makes his home in the woods, and when
migration takes place in the spring, chiefly from Central and South
America, the males arrive at the site of their summer home a few days
before their mates, and are sometimes seen in small parties, forming
a brilliant group.
The nesting season begins in the latter part of May, the nest being
built in low thick woods or in a tangled thicket; very often also in an
orchard, on the horizontal limb of a low tree or sapling. It is loosely
made of twigs and fine bark strips, and lined with rootlets and fibres
of inner bark. The eggs are from three to five in number, and of a
greenish blue, speckled and blotted with brown, chiefly at the larger end.
The male of the Summer Tanager (also called the summer Red-bird)
is vermilion red when adult; the plumage of the female is less attractive.
The cock bird requires several years to attain full plumage. Immature
individuals show a mixture of red and yellow, the amount of each
colour varying according to age. The female is a dull orange colour.
The nest is compactly built of a cottony weed, with Spanish moss,
and lined with fine grass stems. The eggs are beautiful, being a bright
emerald green, blotched with shades of lilac and dark brown.

By Dr. Maurice Amsler
I think many will agree with me when I say that if one has pairs
of the same age the sexing of some species of Lovebirds is not difficult.
In the case of Agapornis roseicollis, of which I have at different times
had several true pairs, the cock was always the handsomer and deeper
coloured of the two.
I only possess one pair of the new Nyasa Lovebirds ; they are a
true pair, and I believe have young at the moment. The hen is
recognizable at a glance, being of a much lighter salmon colour than
the male. It is possible, of course, that the male is an older and therefore
a better coloured bird.
This species appears to be a very ready breeder, as I hear of nesting
on all sides and also of clear eggs !
My own pair were kept in a small wire cage for a few days, but the
moment I placed them in a large box cage some three feet long with a
nest box attached they disappeared into the nest, and at once started
to make nesting material of their perches.
Nothing came amiss to them; sticks as thick as a lead pencil,
millet sprigs, hay, twigs, and more especially bark, which they chewed
off green willow twigs. These birds are in a living room, and I have
had many opportunities of watching them, yet I have never seen them
put their nesting material under their rump feathers as do the Peach-
faced and Black-cheeked Lovebirds. Both sexes incubate, sometimes
separately, more often together, building continues after the laying of
the first egg. I counted up to five, after which it was impossible to
get a view of the nest cavity without seriously disturbing the nest
and possibly breaking the eggs.
A . liliance is often called the Nyasa " peach-faced " Lovebird.
This is a misnomer, I feel sure, as the species is much more closely
allied to the Black-cheeked (A. nigrigenis) ; its size, shape, quick
movements, white circum-orbital zone, and especially its call and alarm
notes constantly renewed, are of the Black-cheeked Lovebirds which
we all bred so freely some years ago.

species--a chance flock appears to have been encountered and it may
be many years before we get another importation.
If, as I expect, these birds are freely bred, it will be well for members
to make exchanges of their young stock so as to avoid inbreeding.
The sexing of these young birds may be difficult, as pointed out by
Mr. Bearby in the April number of the Magazine, but if one decides to
exchange only one sex, say the males, there should be a sufficient
number of correct guesses to prevent excessive inbreeding.

In a letter dated 30th March from Major A. E. Snape to the Honorary
Secretary concerning the production of the Avicultural Magazine,
the following paragraph appears :--
" I would like to mention here that I have received eight or nine
letters from members stating that they are dissatisfied with the present
Magazine, as nothing of a helpful nature has been shown for a very
considerable time and it would appear that nearly all the matter
has been copied from other journals or taken from Continental
experience, W&amp;apos;hich is vastly different from English, owing to climatic
conditions, etc., etc. I just mention this as a matter of interest, and
for the benefit of all concerned."
It is certainly a matter of very great interest to the Editor to hear
that his work and that of the members who give up their time to
provide a magazine for the great majority who merely read it, does
not please Major Snape and his eight or nine correspondents. All
we can say is that we have done our best to improve the Magazine,
and if the contents thereof do not please the members it is the fault
of those who do not write (such as Major Snape and his eight or nine
correspondents) and so deny us the pleasure of publishing the matter
that would be of a " helpful nature ".
We must take strong exception to the statement that " nearly
all the matter has been copied from other journals ". It is true that
the special articles, intended eventually for the book Aviculture,
appear simultaneously in English and French, in the Avicultural
Magazine and UOiseau, this arrangement having been fully explained
in the Magazine wdien the series commenced in January, 1924, but
we never copy from other journals unless there is some very special
reas n for doing so.

Avicultuml Notes
On several occasions our Magazine has consisted of 32 pages,
some eight pages more than at any time since the war, and the number
of plates published has been equal to that of the most flourishing period
of the Society's existence. We frankly admit that we cannot under-
stand what Major Snape and his friends have to complain of. We
should naturally all like an even better Magazine if we had the money
to produce it and if members would send us more copy (we fail to find
Major Snape's name in the list of contributors), but it is a little dis-
couraging, when members give up their spare time and put in a lot of
work to make the Magazine a success, to receive complaints such as
that of Major Snape.
At the same time we would like to say that any suggestions from
members, or just criticism, will be very carefully considered ; but we do
not feel that those who never contribute themselves are quite in a
position to criticize the contributions of others.
Dr. J. du Berrie claims to have been very successful in breeding
foreign birds in cages, and a small indoor aviary. Writing in Cage
Birds of 27th March he remarks :--" Most of my blue-bred Budgerigars
were bred in cages 1 foot square. The under-mentioned birds I have
been successful in breeding last year in a small indoor aviary : Indian
Babblers, Spreo Starlings, Green Glossy Starlings, Abyssinian Love-
birds, Blue-winged Lovebirds, Red-crested Cardinals, Cordon-bleus,
Fire Finches, Missel Thrushes, and Budgerigars.
" In one part of the aviary I had altogether one pair Red-crested
Cardinals, one pair Abyssinian Lovebirds, and a pair of Blue-winged
Lovebirds, and about ten pairs of various Budgerigars, all of which
nested and reared young.
" In the centre part of the aviary I had one pair of Indian Babblers,
one pair Long-tailed Glossy Starlings, two Cassiques, one pair of
White-throated Jay Thrushes, and one pair of Indian Mynahs. All
these nested barring the two Cassiques and the White-throated Jay
Thrushes. The young I took away and hand-reared.
" In the other side of the aviary I had one pair Missel Thrushes j
one pair of Spreo Starlings, one pair of Green Glossy Starlings, and
one only Purple-headed Glossy Starling. All these nested, and I
hand-reared most of the young ones.

" At present I have going to nest in cages one pair of Kosella
Parrakeets and one pair Pennants' Parrakeets. These four are together
in a large cage in the sitting room."
Aviculturists would like to know the secret of Dr. du Berrie's
success, for he must certainly have some method of inducing his birds
to breed under what would generally be considered most unfavourable
conditions. To breed Budgerigars in a cage of only 1 foot square is
an achievement, but to breed Indian Babblers, Long-tailed Glossy
Starlings, and Indian Mynahs in a small indoor aviary which they had
to share with Cassiques and White-throated Jay Thrushes sounds
almost incredible. And what would most aviculturists say to the idea
of attempting to breed a pair each of Rosellas and Pennants in the
same cage in a sitting room ? Certainly Dr. du Berrie must possess
some very valuable secret ; or is he trying to pull somebody's leg ?
The Nyasa Lovebird seems to be a most accommodating bird,
and if any foreign bird is adapted for breeding in a cage it seems to
be that species. It has only quite recently arrived, but many
aviculturists seem to have either eggs or newly hatched young. We
hope that our members will seiid us as full accounts as possible of the
nesting of this Lovebird in their aviaries.
We are glad to be able to announce the forthcoming appearance
of Dr. Hopkinson's Record of Birds which have been bred in Captivity
at which he has been working, during his leaves from service in West
Africa, so long.
It will be published by Messrs. H. F. &amp; G. Witherby, of High
Holborn, and is expected to be ready early in the autumn.
The work, which records the successful breeding of more than
800 species of birds and about the same number of hybrids, will be a
great addition--if not an absolute essential--to any avicultural
library.
We are also able to announce that Messrs. Bernard Quaritch, of
11 Grafton Street, New Bond Street, W. 1, will shortly be issuing a
revised edition of Parrakeets , by Mr. Seth-Smith. This book has been
unobtainable for some years past, but a limited number of copies of
the letterpress have been traced. These will be republished with a new
introduction and a supplement bringing the work completely up to date

Sir, -- I shall be grateful to you if you will include this letter in
your next issue of the Magazine, in order that other people may benefit
by the terrible misfortunes which I have had with my Budgerigars.
I moved into a new house at the beginning of the year, and I had built
a large aviary to take twenty-four or more nesting pairs. It was built of
concrete and brick with flights both indoor and out. It has stove,
electric light: everything cjuite perfect. On the second day, however,
two Blue-bred Budgies died. They had looked quite fit a few hours
before, and I was puzzled. A day or so afterwards a sort of epidemic
began. My husband examined two of the birds and came to the
conclusion that they were poisoned. Mr. George Hedges, hearing of
my trouble, kindly came to see if he could help. He thought it possible
that the hazel branches (used as perches) which had stood near some
apple-trees in this garden might have been sprinkled with insecticide ;
I therefore removed the branches and sent a twig to be analyzed.
The report was that there was arsenic on the twig. So I thought that
I had now got to the end of my troubles.
All went well for about a fortnight, when the same illness broke
out once more. I sent three birds to Mr. C. H. Hicks, who telegraphed
that they had died of acute peritonitis, owing to some tiny particles
of tin, zinc and lead. I examined the wire of the flights and found that
it had been very badly galvanized, and that I could pick off with my
fingers pieces as big as a pin's head. I sent for an ironmonger and set
him to work scrubbing the wires with an iron " boiler-brush He
removed (literally) handfuls of metal dust; it was very hard work,
and it took him about a week, but since then I have not had a bird ill.
In all I lost two Cobalt Blues, eight ordinary Blues, and seven Blue-
breds. All seventeen birds were hens (of course, my best hens). The
cocks did not seem to be affected in any way. The illness was similar
in the last ten or twelve cases, and was very easily recognized. A
perfectly healthy bird would become mopey, sleepy and distressed.
In an hour or so very violent diarrhoea would begin, and the bird would
die within four to twelve hours.
There was undoubtedly arsenic on the branches, and this may
have been the cause of the first deaths. Anyhow, I. want to warn your
readers against : (1) The danger of using branches which have been
near fruit trees, and (2) against the danger of using galvanized wire
until it has been carefully examined.
Dora E. Wall.

At the moment of the June issue of the " A VICU LTURAL MAGAZINE" going to
press we have in stock one of the very finest collections which has ever been seen in England,
and a visit to our premises cannot fail to be of interest to all those interested in the purchase
of living Animals and Birds.
We have just received a very nice collection of Australian Birds, including : Blue-winged
Grass Parrakeets, Tasmanian Mountain Lories, Red Rumps, Adelaides,
Pennants, Rozellas, Bicheno Finches, Double-banded Finches, Sydney
Waxbills, etc., etc., and all interested should not fail to call and see them.
During the past six weeks we have probably handled more rare Birds than have been seen
in this country for a very considerable period of time, and it may be of interest to our
readers to hear that we are in a position to secure such desirable stock.

It will be of great interest to our readers to hear that one of our collectors has just left
Cape Town on board the s.s. " LLANSTEPHAN CASTLE" with a superb collection
of the very rare BLACK-CHEEKED LOVEBIRDS ( Agapornis nigrigensis) , one of the
most attractive and desirable of Lovebirds, which has practically not been seen in this
country since the War, and all interested in acquiring a pair or pairs of these most
delightful Birds should not fail to notify us of their requirements, as the demand is certain
to exceed the supply.
On the next boat following the " Llanstephan Castle " another of our collectors is returning
with a small collection of the almost equally attractive Peach-Faced Lovebirds
(Ag&amp;apos;apornis rosicollis) , and here again early application for specimens is advisable.
To those interested in Indian Soft-billed Birds we would certainly recommend a visit
to our premises, where they will have the pleasure of seeing a very fine collection indeed,
including the following species :--

This very fine and rare Parrakeet was first described from a specimen
living in the aviary of the Earl of Derby at Knowsley in 1850. In a
communication to the Zoological Society of London, published, with a
coloured plate in the Society's Proceedings of that year, Mr. Louis
Fraser wrote :--" The first specimen to which I would wish to draw
the attention of the Society is a Parrakeet of large size, which I propose
calling Palceornis derbyanus.
" The specimen has been for many years in this collection, and
I have chosen for its specific name that of its noble owner. The species
is easily distinguishable from all other members of the genus by its
large size, and the colours of the bill, head, and breast."
The type specimen, a female, is now in the Liverpool Museum.
Two others, also females, were deposited by the Hon., now Lord,
Rothschild in the Zoological Gardens in 1899, and lived there for some
years.
In 1924 Mr. John Frostick obtained a fine male specimen from a
ship hailing from China, which passed into the possession of the late
Mrs. Dalton Burgess, and at her death into that of Mr. F. G. Hedges.
When first received Mr. Frostick identified this bird as Palceornis
salvadorii from specimens so named at the British Museum, and this

individual was exhibited under the name of Salvadori's Parrakeet
at an exhibition held at the Crystal Palace in February last, when it
rightly secured several important prizes.
Professor Oustalet gave the name of P. salvadorii to some specimens
receiyed from Tibet and North-West China, whereas the typical
P. derbyana was said to inhabit Hainan, but there are specimens from
both localities in the Tring Museum, and a careful study of these has
convinced Lord Rothschild that the two cannot be separated, and the
name Palceornis salvadorii of Oustalet must therefore be regarded as
a synonym of P. derbyana , Fraser.
The coloured plate published herewith was drawn from the very
fine living male specimen now in Mr. Hedges' possession, and an
excellent plate of the female, drawn by Joseph Wolf from the type
specimen, was published in the Proceedings of the Zoological Society
for 1850.
A comparison of these two illustrations shows clearly the difference
in the coloration of the sexes, the chief distinguishing characters being
in the colour of the bill, which is red in the male and black in the
female, and the under-surface, which in the male may be described as
lilac-blue, whereas that of the female is very much more of a rosy
pink, and was originally described by Louis Fraser as " rose-coloured
purple However, individual specimens vary considerably in the
depth of the colour of the under-surface. This bird is some twenty
inches in total length.

A very interesting account of the breeding of Agapornis taranta
from the pen of Herr Ed. Schiitze appears in the current number of
a publication known as " A. Z." (Austausch Zentrale der Exotenliebhaber
und Ziichter).
This species was first imported to Germany in 1906, when a few
specimens arrived. Others did not arrive until 1923 and these were
received from England. The price was at first about 120 marks per
pair, but it soon fell to half that, and now they can be obtained for

some 15 marks for a pair. The first to arrive were in poor condition, and
the species got the reputation of being delicate, but later arrivals were
extraordinarily strong, though needing to be kept moderately warm,
otherwise they were found to be susceptible to disease.
In the autumn of 1924 a pair of these Lovebirds was placed in an
aviary (about 6 feet by 8 feet) inhabited by other birds such as
Budgerigars and Grassfinches. Here they took possession of a nesting
box, and lived with their companions on friendly terms.
At the end of January, 1925, the female remained in the nesting
box, and appeared to be incubating. On the 17th of February, an
examination was made which revealed three almost round eggs. Another
inspection on the 23rd showed two young ones hatched, the third egg
being unfertile, the size of the eggs being 23&amp;apos;18 mm. The incubation
period appeared to be about eighteen days, but could not be ascertained
precisely. The female very seldom left the nest, and when she did it
was only for a very short time. She was diligently fed by the male.
From the 26th February onwards the female was more frequently out
of the nesting box. The male did not, as yet, feed the young direct,
but he regularly fed the female, who fed the young, which cried out
loudly. This changed early in March, when the male took part in the
feeding of the young. By 16th March the young were almost feathered,
and when removed from the nest-box made no complaint but squatted
on the ground.
On the 19th March they looked out of the box for the first time,
but the first young one did not leave the box until 29th March. In size
and colour the young, on leaving the nest, resembled the female, except
that the red of the beak was paler. The second young bird left the
nest four days after the first. Both proved to be females. On 9th April
the young began to feed themselves, but were still diligently fed by their
parents. By 27th April the young were independent of their parents,
though these still fed them occasionally until 4th May.
For the first weeks the young birds were given soft food containing
ants' eggs and hard-boiled egg. On this food they thrived, and later
took to eating seed, especially millet, but they also took nearly all
kinds of bird-seed, including oats, sunflower, and grass seed ; also green
food. Hemp they did not care for. They bathed frequently.

A very interesting point observed was that these birds built no nest
as other Lovebirds do, but the female plucked the feathers from her
breast with which to form a nest platform.
Herr Schiitze goes on to say that he does not advise the keeping of
these Lovebirds with other small birds during the nesting period, as
he has known of cases in which they have become spiteful and bitten
the legs of their companions

COCKATOOS

<bodyText confidence="0.9811344" page_id="56220378"  page_num="148" year="" vol="">
By The Marquess of Tavistock and J. Delacour
Cockatoos are a family of large Parrots peculiar to Australia and
the neighbouring isles ; they have crests and square or slightly scalloped
tails. They have very different habits and diet, but they all have
extremely powerful beaks, and can use them to such purpose that
ordinary wire netting cannot resist them. They destroy wood with
the greatest ease, and feed on seeds in an aviary as when at liberty.
Most of them live well in cages, and as they are gramnivorous they are
easily kept.
The sexes of those of the genus Cacatua can be distinguished by
the colour of the eyes, those of the male being black, and those of the
female brown.
The Great Black Cockatoo (Microglossus aterrimus) is noticeable
above all other Cockatoos by its enormous beak, its large crest and
short tail, black plumage, and cheeks of which the bare skin is pink.
It lives in Northern Australia and New Guinea. This bird ornaments
the tree where it nests with pieces of palm leaves. It is not common
in confinement, where it is easily fed and is tame and gentle. Its note
is a shrill whistle.
The Black Cockatoos ( Galyptorhynchus ) are peculiar to Australia.
They have large rounded beaks, rather short thick crests, long wings
and tails. They live in woods, and tear the bark off trees in order to
find grubs, of which they are very fond. The various species are all
very much alike.
The Banksian Cockatoo (C. banksi) is a native of South-East

Australia ; the adult male is black, with a scarlet band across the sides
of the tail. The female's head is more or less spotted with pale yellow,
and her breast is barred with the same and dull red ; the base of the
tail is yellowish, or yellowish red spotted with black. There are several
kinds which differ from one another in size and up to a certain point
in the colouring of the female. Young birds closely resemble the
females, but the young males are always darker than females of the
same age. They take four years to acquire their full adult plumage,
and in the last transitional phase they are all black, and the red band
on the tail is spotted with black.
On account of its loud screams and its power of breaking out of
its aviary, by means of its formidable beak, the Black Cockatoo is by
no means everybody's bird, but it has so much personality and charm
of its own that it is very interesting. Birds taken after they are full
grown are quite untameable, and seldom live long, but young ones
taken from the nest become much attached to mankind. This is
particularly so with male birds, for the hens are less gentle and
affectionate. Banksian Cockatoos do not like being touched, and even
the tamest suffer rather than enjoy fondling, but they delight in being
spoken to and being allowed to perch on their master's head or shoulder.
Male birds become so devoted that if they are intended to breed they
must not be made too much of, or they will neglect their mates for
the sake of their human friends.
Black Cockatoos should be fed on hemp seed, sunflower seeds, and
peanuts, together with Brazil nuts if they will take them. They are
very fond of oak apple grubs, and some will eat smooth caterpillars.
On acquiring a Black Cockatoo inquiry should be made as to which
seeds it is accustomed to feed on, for they will sooner die of starvation
than take to new foods. They are very sensitive birds, and often refuse
food for two or three days in a new place. There is no need to be uneasy
at this, for they have a great power of fasting. One of my birds lived
fourteen days without food of any kind.
Black Cockatoos are generally gentle and peaceable with other
birds, and if they sometimes put on a threatening aspect it is caused
by fear. But male birds become very jealous of each other, especially
tame ones, and cannot be put together.

These birds cannot stand cold as well as their white cousins, but
they can bear a few degrees of cold ; fog and snow do them more harm;
it is better to give them some warmth in winter. They are long-lived
if well cared for, some of mine must have been in confinement for
forty years at least, and show no signs of age.
They have laid and incubated in confinement, but so far young have
not been reared.
Tame specimens may be allowed their liberty, but at first it takes
some trouble to teach them to leave their abode ; like many of the
larger Parrots they are afraid to come down beyond a certain height.
When in flight they are curious and imposing, their long wings and
tail making them look lilte aeroplanes. A fine old male which I
owned had a habit of flying by night and uttering his loud weird
mournful cries. The sight of him both by day and night frightened the
wild birds, and, strange to say, my Australian Parrots, but he would
not have hurt a fly. He was very fond of one of the gardeners, and
would follow him when he rode home on his bicycle about three miles
off, and return at evening to the window-ledge which was his favourite
perch.
The Western Black Cockatoo (C.c. stellatus), which is a native of
Western Australia, is smaller and has a rounder crest. Its habits are
the same.
Living specimens of the following have been imported :--\0x25A0
C.c. mcLcrorhynchus from Northern Australia.
The Funereal Cockatoo {C. funereus), from the south-east of
Australia and Tasmania, is dark brown mixed with yellow, and with
a yellow spot on the cheeks. The sexes are alike. I had a female for
some months, she was tame, but rather vicious.
C. viridis from the south-east has also been imported. It differs
from the Banksian in having a weaker beak; the female has less
yellow about her.
The Gang-gang Cockatoo (Callocephalum galeatum) has fine
grey plumage, barred like a Cuckoo, shading into yellow on the wings
and underparts, a red head, ornamented with crest slightly curved
forward. The female's head and crest are grey, but all her body is
shaded with red and yellow, especially the breast and underparts. The

sexes are distinguishable even in extreme youth. This fine bird inhabits
South-East Australia and Tasmania.
The Gang-gang becomes tame and affectionate, and can be left at
liberty all the year round if its owner does not mind seeing it break
off cypress branches when it is eating the seeds. In captivity, it must
not have either hemp or sunflower seeds, with these exceptions its
food is the same as for other Cockatoos ; it likes fruit. It does better
in an aviary than in a cage.
This species has bred in an aviary, and a pair belonging to Mine.
Lecallier has reared young each year for three years. It has also nested
at liberty in Europe. The Gang-gang is spiteful to other Cockatoos ;
its flight is silent like that of an Owl.
The Sulphur-crested Cockatoo (Cacatua galerita) is well-known
as a cage-bird. It is very common in Australia and Tasmania. It is
a hardy long-lived bird in confinement; it becomes much attached to
its keeper and allows itself to be handled and sometimes makes a good
talker. But if it gets excited it screams horribly. The sexes are alike,
white, with crest and under the tail pale yellow ; but the eye of the
female seen in a good light is dark brown, wdiile that of the male is
black. It has bred in confinement.
It is a striking and interesting bird when at liberty, but as it is
likely to stray it is wise to warn one's neighbours.
When a pair of any kind of Cockatoos is let loose, it is prudent
to choose a really devoted couple, and to liberate the male bird only
for several months, then to catch him up again, and let the female
out for the same length of time. Afterwards they can safely be allowed
out together. This species is not friendly with other birds. Its food
should be a mixture of two parts of canary seed to one of oats, half of
hemp, half of sunflower, and one of maize, pea nuts, fruit, and green
food if it will eat it.
There is a closely allied species in New Guinea which differs only
in being somewhat smaller and having the skin round the eye more
lead colour.
The Lesser Sulphur-crested Cockatoo (C. sulphured) is dis-
tinguished from the above by its much smaller size, yellow spot on its
cheeks, and yellow plumage generally. The male has black eyes, and

the female reddish. It requires the same treatment as the larger species.
It is found in Celebes, where it is very commonly kept in confinement.
C. parvula, from Timor, is distinguished from the above by finer
bill and its plumage being of a purer white.
The Citron-crested Cockatoo (G. citrinocristata ) from Sumba
differs only in having a fine orange-yellow crest. It is rare in confinement.
Leadbeater's Cockatoo (C. leadbeateri) is the finest of all the
Cockatoos. It is very hardy and breeds readily. It is white above,
pink beneath and under the wings and tail, and has a salmon-red
crest marked with yellow. The male has black eyes, the female brown.
This fine bird inhabits the south and interior of Australia. It is very
noisy, and although it can be tamed and taught to speak a few words,
it is less confiding and affectionate than the Sulphur-crested Cockatoos.
It has been bred in Europe, both in confinement and at liberty; both
sexes shared the incubation. It requires the same treatment and the
same food as its congeners, but is not to be trusted with other birds.
The White Cockatoo (0. alba), from the Moluccas, is pure white
but for a slight yellow tinge at the base of the feathers of the wings
and tail. It is a large bird, and its very powerful head is ornamented
by a large round crest.
It becomes very tame in captivity, very affectionate, and often
speaks extremely well. It is inclined to pluck itself in a cage and
should accordingly be given wood to gnaw for the sake of occupation.
It should only be given hemp seed and sunflower seeds sparingly. It
has a loud and disagreeable scream.
C. opTitahnia is a very near relation, but its crest is tinged with
yellow.
The Moluccan Cockatoo (C. moluccensis) lives in Amboyna and
is like the preceding. It is a magnificent bird, nearly as beautiful
as Leadbeaters. It is roseate white, and the feathers in the interior of
the crest are bright orange. It becomes very tame and learns to speak
but its scream, fortunately rarely heard, is enough to wake the dead !
It is said that it will stay well at liberty and can endure cold well. It
should be treated like the above. The hen has brown eyes, the cock
black. It is spiteful towards other birds.
The Bare-eyed Cockatoo (C, gymnopis ), from Australia, is known

by its short straight crest, and by having its eyes surrounded by bare
lead-coloured skin. The male and female are alike. It is white, tinged
yellow under the tail, its face and crest being spotted with rose
colour.
It is gentle and speaks well in confinement, but is spiteful to other
birds. It damages trees if at liberty. When kept in a cage it must not
have hemp or sunflower seed as these upset its liver.
C. sanguinea , which inhabits the same regions, and only differs from
the above by the absence of bare skin under the eye, is perhaps only
a variety.
Goffin's Cockatoo (C . goffini), from Tenimber Island, is a miniature
of the above. M. Delacour has remarked of a specimen which lived for
many years in confinement, that while it was pure white when kept
indoors, it turned bright pink when in the open air ; the change taking
place within a few days.
Ducorps Cockatoo (C. ducorpsi), from the Solomon Islands, is
white, with crest, cheeks, vent, and under the wings pale yellow.
The Philippine Cockatoo (C. hcematuropygia) is white, but has
crest, cheeks, and under-tail feathers pale red ; it is yellow under
the wings and tail. This species and the four which precede it are
allied forms.
The Roseate Cockatoo (C . roseicapilla ), from Australia, where it
is known as the " Gallah ", is a handsome bird, well known to everyone,
its only fault is its disagreeable voice. Its wings, back, and tail are
pearly grey, its head, neck, and breast are a beautiful pink, mixed
with white on the crest, which is short and rounded.
It becomes tame and affectionate in confinement, and is by far the
gentlest of the Cockatoo tribe towards other birds with the exception
of the Black Cockatoo. It may be kept in an aviary made of strong
wire netting. It is not a good talker, and rarely learns more than one
or two words.
When acclimatized it can stand the winter in the open air, but the
female should not be allowed to go to nest either in the aviary or at
liberty as long as the cold weather lasts.
This species has reared young at liberty and in an aviary, and it
has been crossed with C. sulphurea, but the young are very delicate

during the first six months and highly susceptible to chills and other
diseases. When in breeding condition the hues of the neck and breast
become more intense, and there is no doubt that this is due to repig-
mentation of the feathers, as there is no sign of moulting. Both sexes
incubate, but the male only replaces the hen for a short time when she
goes off to feed, and does not stay on the nest as do other kinds of
Cockatoos.
Albino Roseate,Cockatoos have sometimes been taken in Australia ;
they are very pretty, as they keep their rose-coloured breasts, but no
such albino has yet been brought to Europe.
The male Roseate has black eyes, the female nut brown.
These Cockatoos are delightful at liberty, but it is not easy to
induce a pair to stay. The greater number leave at once, some may
remain for weeks or even months, and then go. The best plan is to
get a wild cock and a tame hen, but not so tame that she will let strangers
pick her up. When the birds have become attached to each other
the cock may be released for some months, then after catching him
up, release the hen for the same period, afterwards allowing both to
b$ at liberty together. The hen must be shut up in an aviary from
October to April to keep her from going to nest during the cold weather.
It is pretty to watch the flight of Roseates and they appear
thoroughly to enjoy their freedom. They do not injure fruit or trees
often, though they may occasionally peel the bark off a branch, but
not to any great extent.
They sometimes fly away from their home, and are chased by
Rooks and Jackdaws, but if these become a nuisance a few shots will
teach them to mind their own business. Roseates should be fed like
the Yellow-crested Cockatoos.
The Slender-billed Cockatoo (Licmetis nasica) also inhabits
Australia ; in shape it resembles the Bare-eyed Cockatoo, but has an
even shorter crest, and its long, slender, slightly curved beak gives
it a peculiar appearance. It is fairly large, white, with rose-coloured
spots and red-tinged head, neck, and breast; the eye is surrounded
with a rather large patch of bare bluish skin.
The sexes are alike. This kind does well in captivity, and becomes
extremely tame and affectionate, and often learns to talk. It should

have the same treatment as the other Cockatoos, minus sunflower
seed and hemp. Some individuals like raw carrot.
L. pastinator is also imported ; it is merely a local form of the
above occurring in Western Australia, slightly larger and more rose-
coloured.
The Cockatiel (Calopsittacus novce-hollandice ) is placed after and
next to the Cockatoos ; like them it has a fine crest and belongs to
Australia. It is a well-known bird ; the male is grey, with white
shoulders, head and crest yellowish with orange-red cheek spots. The
female is distinguished by having the two outer feathers of the tail
yellow, spotted with black and a greyish head.
Cockatiels generally agree very well with other birds, but breeding
couples may quarrel amongst themselves. They are very prolific,
and rear several broods in succession, laying a great many eggs. Both
sexes incubate.
The Cockatiel is very hardy and endures cold better than almost
any other Parrot. When tamed it makes a delightful companion, and
can be taught to say some words. Unfortunately, it does not stay well
at liberty, though a male whose mate is shut up, and who has no other
companions, sometimes stays about his owner's garden until taken by
Owls. It is advisable to release him hungry on a calm day, winter is
the best time for the experiment, for he will only perch on bare branches.
Its flight is extremely graceful and powerful, and so delightful to watch
that one is almost resigned to losing the bird.
Cockatiels should be given two parts of canary seed to one of oats
and one of hemp, with all kinds of green food.
Now we come to a particular family of tiny Parrakeets belonging
to New Guinea and the neighbouring islands, the Pigmy Parrots
(Nasiterna), which have large heads and short, square tails, which
remind one of Cockatoos. They all have brilliant colouring, and
measure at most 3 to 4 in. in length. Unfortunately, these fascinating
little birds have never been imported. They are seed eaters, and should
not be difficult to keep.

MACAWS
By The Marquess of Tavistock
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.998868454545454" page_id="56220388"  page_num="156" year="" vol="">
Macaws belong to a group which includes the largest of the
Parrakeets, having enormous beaks and very long tails. They are
all natives of the tropical parts of America, and many kinds, which
have now vanished, inhabited the Antilles Islands. They live in
woods, and always fly about in pairs. Their large size and powerful
beaks make them difficult to keep in aviaries, for which reason they
are generally kept chained to their perches. But unless they can be
given a properly constructed aviary, or can be allowed to fly loose, it
is better not to keep them at all.
Once acclimatized, the larger species stand cold well, and may be
wintered out of doors. With the exception of the dark blue kinds
(Anodorhynchus) they stay well and are less destructive than would be
supposed when given their freedom. They may have some of their
wing feathers clipped for greater safety. A Macaw flying from tree to
tree is a wonderful spectacle. They are not particularly vicious with
other birds, rarely using their powerful beaks to attack them. When
domesticated they manifest great affection towards their owners, some
even talk very well, but their natural voice is proportionate to their
size !
Their food should consist of seeds--two parts of canary, two of
oats, one of wheat, one of maize, one of hemp, one of sunflower, together
with monkey nuts and fruit. Very young birds should have bread and
milk as well, a food which is bad for most Parrakeets, but does not
appear to harm young Macaws. They are very long-lived.
The Hyacinthine Macaw (Anodorhynchus hyacinthinus), from
Central Brazil, is an enormous bird, its colour a magnificent deep blue ;
its nature is particularly gentle and reliable. It is quite hardy, but does
not stay well if at liberty. Young birds require bread and milk, which
should be left off after a time.
Lear's Macaw (A. leari) likewise comes from Brazil, it is smaller
than the preceding, and not such an intense blue. I have succeeded
in keeping one or two at liberty, but it is very difficult to make them
stay. It is an affectionate species, and speaks very well; it is quite

hardy, and I had a freshly imported one which went without food for
two dajrs and two nights on the top of an oak tree in the depth of
winter. It was in bad plumage, but did not suffer in the least. The
sexes are identical.
The Glaucous Macaw (A. glaucus), from Southern Brazil, and the
Argentine, is still smaller and greyer. It is very seldom imported.
Spix' Macaw (Cyanopsittacus spixi), from Eastern Brazil, is the
smallest of the blue Macaws, more like a large Parrot. Its colour is
pale blue, greyer on the head. It is a charming bird, but very rarely
imported. It has laid in confinement.
The Blue and Yellow Macaw ( Ara ararauna), very well known.
It is found from Columbia to Paraguay. It is a very beautiful bird,
and has been bred in confinement.
The Bed and Yellow Macaw (A. macao), which is found from
South Mexico to the Amazon and Bolivia, is another very popular bird,
light red and blue, with yellow on the wings.
The Bed and Blue Macaw (A. chloroptera) is almost as common
as the preceding. Its range is from Guiana to Bolivia ; it may be
distinguished by its darker red colouring and blue and green wings.
The Military Macaw (A. militaris) is a native of Mexico, Columbia,
Peru, and Bolivia. It is a fine golden-green bird with red forehead and
middle tail feathers The wings and the rest of the tail are mostly blue.
It is fairly often imported, but not quite so frequently met with in
Europe as the above.
The Macaws which have still to be mentioned are much smaller.
Their colour generally speaking is rather deep green, relieved with
blue, red, brown, or yellow.
The Severe Macaw (A. Severn), inhabiting Panama and Brazil,
has blue wings and tail, washed with red underneath, its head is bluish,
forehead and chin brown, the fold of the wing red.
Illiger's Macaw (A. maracana), found in S. Brazil and Paraguay,
is smaller. It has a rose-coloured forehead, and two red spots on the
back and belly. A. couloni, from Peru, is distinguished only by the
absence of the rose and red spots.
The Gold-necked Macaw (A . aureicollis) , from Bolivia and Paraguay,
has a blackish-brown head, and a wide yellow collar behind its neck.

The arrival in London of four living examples of that wonderful
Parrot, the Golden Conure or Queen of Bavaria's Parrakeet, Conurus
guarouba) is a very notable event in the history of aviculture, and
Mr. Chapman is to be congratulated on having secured these very rare
birds, as it is many years since a specimen was seen in England.
This is a large Conure, and when adult its plumage is of a brilliant
golden yellow all over, with the exception of the primary and secondary
wing-features, which are of a bright grass-green. The bill and feet
are flesh-coloured. The young birds are splashed with green over most
of the plumage, and most probably when quite young are almost entirely
green.
The Golden Conure has not been represented at the London Zoo
since 1880, and the only specimen the writer has seen before these new
ones was one in the Jardin d'acclimatation in Paris, in 1900. This
species occurs in North-Eastern Brazil, but it appears to be rare in its
own country.
Another rare species of which Mr. Chapman recently obtained an
example from Abyssinia is the Crowned Starling, Galeopsar salvadorii.
It is a blackish bird with somewhat glossy plumage and chestnut
primaries, a long graduated tail and a peculiar dense patch of bristly
feathers on the forehead and fore part of the crown which distinguishes
it from all other Starlings. It was named by the late Dr. Bowdler
Sharpe in 1891, and formed the subject of a coloured plate in the.
Ibis for that year. This bird is new to aviculture, and we understand
that the specimen imported has found its way into Mr. Ezra's aviaries.

Captain Stokes writes " My young Nyasa Lovebird hatched
about 16th April is growing famously. Only one egg hatched. The
nestling is vivid green about the back, and the beak is already fairly
bright red ; the orange-brick colour of the face is already quite discern-
ible. It is being reared on canary seed, quaker oats, and green food ;
they touch nothing else. 55
In a collection of birds recently received by Mr. Chapman from
India were some Indian Coursers (Cursorius coromandelicus) which,
so far as we know, are new to aviculture. Three examples were acquired
by the Zoological Society and the remaining two went to Captain
Stokes. It is of a rich rufous colour, with a conspicuous white stripe
over the eye--a very handsome species. The Zoo is now able to exhibit
three species of Courser together in one of the aviaries in the Small
Bird House.
With the Coursers came two handsome species of Lapwings--the
Red-wattled ( Sarcogrammus indicus ), an apparently new species to
aviculture, and the Yellow-wattled (. Lobipluvia malabaricus), both
of which may now be seen in the Diving-bird House at the Zoological
Gardens.

Professor A. Landsborough Thomson has rendered a great service
to ornithology in the admirable manner in which he has collected the
known facts, and discussed the various problems presented by the
migration of birds, in his important volume entitled Problems of Bird
Migration. It is a subject that has exercised the minds of ornithologists
for very many years past, but the problems presented by it are still
far from solution. The method of marking birds by means of affixing
light aluminium rings to their legs has been most successfully practised

the whole world, and it is certainly one of the most important works
on ornithology that has appeared for some time, and we commend

THORBURN'S BRITISH BIRDS 1
Our members will be glad to hear of the appearance of the third
volume of this very beautifully illustrated work, the first two volumes
of which have already been noticed in this journal. The present
volume deals with the Geese, Ducks, Pigeons, Sandgrouse, Grouse,
Pheasants, Partridges, Rails, Bustards, and Waders, and, like its two
predecessors, contains no less than forty-eight coloured plates, which
fully maintain the high standard of excellence which one always looks
for, and seldom fails to find, in Thorburn's work. We have frequently
been asked to recommend a good book on British birds which will
enable anyone to identify the various species, and here is such a book
with a coloured illustration, admirably executed, of almost every
bird, and, moreover, at an extremely moderate price. Thorburn's
British Birds is certainly the most attractive bird-book that has
appeared for a long time, and both author and publisher are to be
heartily congratulated on the production of a work that every bird-
lover will wish to own.

The following letter was addressed to the Hon. Secretary :--
Madam, --On reading the Avicultural Magazine for the month of
May it was with some astonishment one noticed an article by the
Hon. Editor on a letter written by me, as a Member of the Council, to
the Avicultural Society, which caused me not a little pang of regret.
The comments were on a portion of a letter, and I hope in fairness
to all concerned that this will at least be given equal prominence in
the next issue.
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.734218" page_id="56220394"  page_num="162" year="" vol="">
(1) Possibly the Hon. Editor is not au faix with Council matters,
as he was not present at the last meeting of the Council at the Zoo
offices. Otherwise he would have known that a further member of the
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.761139647058823" page_id="56220394"  page_num="162" year="" vol="">
Council commented upon the articles appearing in the Magazines,
and he also stated that he 1 personally had read them before in the
French magazines, etc.
(2) The Hon. Editor has mutilated a sentence of mine. This should
read exactly as it is written in the first paragraph commented upon,
namely, that nearly all the matter has been copied from other
journals --or taken from Continental experience, etc. This rather
alters the whole case, with which we think he will agree. Consequently,
the first sentence in the third paragraph of his comments does not
apply.
(3) I would point out that my correspondents are not personal
friends of mine--I have, in fact, never had the pleasure of meeting
them. Presumably they wrote me as late Hon. Secretary of the
Foreign Bird Club and one who was mostly responsible for the
amalgamation.
(4) The complaint about copy being scarce is not correct, as the
Hon. Secretary informed the Council at the last meeting that we had

inundated with copy.
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.8764779" page_id="56220395"  page_num="163" year="" vol="">
(5) The cost of the Magazine is not an insuperable problem, as I
have shown the way to practically double the Magazine at no increased
cost.
(6) The writer unfortunately has to travel, and consequently
cannot, for obvious reasons, be in touch--only at infrequent intervals
--with a hobby of which he is passionately fond.
Possibly the Hon. Editor when he adopted personalities was not
aware of this.
(7) One knows just as much as the Hon Editor the thankless
job it is to be a Hon. Officer of a Club or Society, and it is up to all to

pull together for the benefit of all the members, particularly where
there are a great many novices, and this should be borne in mind
by him.
My last sentence quoted in the Magazine shows that my letter was
not in the nature of a personal complaint.
Lastly, one can do just as much work for a Society and not appear
on the surface, and this, I for one, do not mind doing.
(8) The question of plates has nothing to with any officer of the
Club but solely the generosity of the donor--whom I am sure all will
thank. The bulkiness of a novel is no criterion of the matter contained
therein and this, in so far as knowledge for the novice, applies to the
Magazine.
It is most unfortunate that this matter has been rushed into print--
at least personally I think so. My letter was written to the Hon. Secretary
on business of the Society, as stated above--with a copy to the President
--and it was purely a matter for the Council, and not the members,
particularly where only a part of a letter is quoted by him. Why not
the preceding paragraph to the one mentioned, when a different
complexion is put on the whole subject.
Why must one officer--even though he be the Hon. Editor--
endeavour to pillory a member of the Council for bringing forward
a matter of public interest before the Council before discussion by the
Council.
Put the whole matter to the vote of members, whether they prefer

conditions, or space, to an article, no matter how well written, on
something which they are never likely to acquire. The vote I trow
will be for the former, whereas the latter, I contend, has predominated
with most of the articles of late.
One hopes that the Hon. Editor will, in future, respect informa-
tion which is given for the benefit of the Council, before he takes it
upon himself to publish matters of a nature such as he has done with
regard to myself.
The attack is most uncalled for.

Sir, ---Will you please allow me to say that in my humble opinion
the general interest of the Avicultural Magazine has never been greater
than it is at present, and has been for the last year or two.
Many of us readers enjoy the articles " copied from other journals ",
and we would be very sorry indeed to see a return to the days when
most of the articles referred to beginners, accounts of the attempts
at nesting by their Zebra or Cut-throat Finches, or the sad and sudden
death of a Bull-finch from over-eating.

Sir, --Seeing a quotation from Major Snape's letter in our Magazine ,
I wish to say I appreciate your work as Hon. Editor. I consider the
Magazine has never been better with matter that appeals to every one.
I wish we had more letter correspondence, as in the old days.
At the present time, I keep only Budgerigars, and have nothing of

competition. She kicked off by laying seven. The building of a nest
was the furthest thought from her mind, though hubby had carried
bits of grass, etc., round and silng his microscopical melody until he
had to give up in sheer exhaustion. Her ladyship merely deposited
the first two eggs on the floor of the cage, which, by the way, is of the
large box type. As I could see she was not going to make the nest,
I made one myself in a small cress basket, and placed it on the floor
of the cage in the corner, putting the two eggs therein. She laid the
balance of the clutch in the improvised nest, and sat well, with the
exception of one night, on about the seventh day, when she decided
that the weather was too warm for sitting ; however, she returned the

following morning, and apparently tlie eggs had not suffered from this
undue exposure. She only hatched two, which she fed well for two
days, after which she found this was too exerting for her, so spent most
of the following day standing on the side of the nest, watching the
two unfortunates lying starving in the nest.
In about three weeks' time she again went to nest, this time building
her own in a Hartz Mountain cage, but she refused to sit. Ever since
this, right up until to-day, she has been fooling about in and out of
a cigar-box, and, to tell the truth, I have not worried much about
her, as I have given her up as a bad job for this season. However, I
decided to-day to clear the nest box out altogether, and find, to my great
surprise, that it contained thirty eggs.
I ask you, what do you think of her, and what can I do to make
her settle down to home life ?

BREEDING RARE PARRAKEETS IN AMERICA

Sir,-- I have been trying for some little time to induce American
ornithologists and bird-lovers to undertake the systematic breeding
in moveable aviaries of those species of Parrakeets which are threatened
with extinction in a wild state from causes beyond human control.
In my efforts I have been very ably assisted by Mr. Charles Metzger,
of 6312 South Ashland Avenue, Chicago, who, though unable to
attempt any breeding himself, has been most energetic in collecting
information and in trying to obtain support. Some of the facts that have
come to light are of no little interest. In the first place, the fact has
been established that the climate of parts of California is admirably
suited to the experiment, and some of the very birds I am most anxious
to save have been bred in considerable numbers, even under conditions
of aviary management which are far from ideal. In the second, we have
found out that there are at the present time in the hands of certain
Californian ayiculturalists, breeding stocks of Blue-winged or Elegant
Grass-parrakeets, Bourkes, and perhaps even Turquoisines. One

Japanese gentleman recently acquired three pairs of Bourkes, and during
the course of the year bred seventeen young, although he kept all his
birds together--a very risky proceeding in view of the pugnacity of
many cock Bourkes, and their naturally solitary habits when nesting.
It is even possible that there may be more Bourkes in California at
the present time than there are wild in Australia, so exceedingly scarce
does this lovely little Parrakeet seem to have become.
Encouraging as I find this unexpected news of rare species breeding
well in captivity, there is another side to the picture. At present hardly
any of the owners seem to be properly aware of the priceless value
of their avian treasures. They are keeping them just anyhow, a number
of pairs together, with birds of other species occupying the same
aviary, and free to disturb nests if they will. Sometimes, dreadful to
relate, rare Grass-parrakeets seem to have been cleared out to make
room for the domestic Budgerigar ! There appears to be very general
ignorance as to what Parrakeets are really rare, i.e. rare in a wild state,
and what are a legitimate source of pride to the breeder. Mealy Bosellas
may be more prized than Bourkes, because they happen to be
temporarily scarce in the American bird market, and a person may be
more proud of breeding Indian Ringnecks and Alexandrines than
of breeding Blue-winged Grass-parrakeets.
I should like to implore our American members to make the most
of their wonderful opportunities before it is too late. If they do not
happen to live in California they can perhaps help to finance a preserva-
tion experiment in that country. The saving of a rare and beautiful
bird from extinction is surely a matter of importance to all bird lovers,
even though they may never be able to make the species a part of their
own collection.
Owners of rare birds need to be discovered and aroused to a sense
of the value of what they possess. Arrangements need to be made
for the purchase of all surplus stock they are willing to sell for use in
breeding under the best conditions to ensure continued stamina and
fertility. Mr. Metzger would, I am sure, be delighted to give what
help and information he could.
In conclusion, it might be well for me to point out that the Grass-
parrakeets of the genus Neophema, all of which are in need of preserva-
tion, are, in the case of certain species, much alike, and a certain amount

of knowledge is desirable to avoid the mixing of different kinds, and
the production of scientifically uninteresting hybrids.
The Blue-winged Grass-parrakeet ( Neophema venusta) is the
commonest, and the one most often imported. It is the only Grass-
parrakeet found in Tasmania, Gould's statement that N. chrysostoma
also occurs there being apparently an error due to the fact that male
Bluewings are often " orange-bellied
The adult male Bluewing has a broad band of blue on the wing of a
uniform dark colour. The Blue-winged Grass-parrakeet is often miscalled
" Elegant " by dealers. The true Elegant Grass-parrakeet (. Neophema
elegans) is found on the mainland of Australia. It differs from the
Bluewing in the fact that the adult male has a narrow band of blue on
the wing of two colours--pale blue on the edge, dark on the . inner
side. The Elegant Grass-parrakeet is sometimes miscalled the Orange-
bellied by dealers, as adult males often have orange patches on the
abdomen, like some Bluewings. The Orange-bellied Grass-parrakeet
(.Neophema chrysostoma) is a very rare bird, also from the Australian
mainland. It is the greenest of the grass parrakeets, but its distinguish-
ing feature lies in the frontal band which is broad, rather irregular
in shape, and of a not very intense blue. Adult male Elegants and
Bluewings have the blue band across the forehead narrow, clear cut,
and intensely vivid.
The Rock Grass-Parrakeets ( Neophema petrophila) is the most
soberly coloured of the genus. The greater part of the plumage is a
brownish olive green, and the blue areas on the wings and forehead
are smaller and less vivid than in the other species.
Females of all the above-mentioned species bear a general
resemblance to males, but they have less colour on the forehead--
practically none at times--and the blue areas on the wings are smaller,
duller, and mingled with green feathers. The colour of the belly is
also less bright. Young birds in first feather are even greener than
hens, and more destitute of frontal bands. They assume adult plumage
at an early age, and are in full colour long before they are a year old.
The two remaining members of the genus---the Turquoisine and the
Splendid Grass-parrakeet--are too distinct to need description.

THE BREEDING OF THE NY ASA LOVEBIRD
By Captain H. S. Stokes
A good deal has been written about Agapornis liliance since -the
large consignment arrived a few months ago, so that no further descrip-
tion of it is necessary--and those readers who have not seen it in the
flesh will find it faithfully portrayed in the coloured plate.
My first pair were put into a small inner aviary about 4 ft. X 3 ft.
X 6 ft. high, along with a lot of blue Budgerigars for lack of other
space, and thinking they would like a box to sleep in I put in several
Budgerigar nest-boxes. To one of these they took at once, spending
most of the day there. After a few days we took advantage of one
bird being out to look inside, and to our delight found a neat nest
containing six eggs. The nest was made of oak twigs finely shredded
up and stems of the flowering grass supplied as green food. I did not
at the time see the birds carrying this material, but have since seen
them carrying in odd bits of grass and even feathers, always in their
beaks, so gather that this is the general means employed, and not, as
with some species of Agapornis, on the back.
Although they were as good as gold with the blue Budgerigars,
I yet thought it wise to give them the flight to themselves and extracted
the other occupants as quietly as possible. At this stage of the
proceedings I went abroad for a month, and presently heard from my

170 Captain H. S. Stokes--The Breeding of the Nyasa Lovebird
bird girl that on 16th April, finding both birds off the nest, she looked
in and found one egg hatched. The baby grew well and at three weeks
had all the brilliant colouring of its parents except that the orange red
of the head did not extend as far back as in the old birds. At a month
old, 18th May, it came out of the nest fully grown and flying strongly,
and made its bow to the world as one of the first--and I hope the first,
English-bred Nyasa Lovebird.
The other five eggs were afterwards found all to contain dead chicks,
which may have been due to both parents having sat together con-
tinuously. It is not possible to say how long incubation took. Parents
and young retire every night to the nest, where they are cooking a
second clutch of eggs ! Meanwhile a second pair and a half came from
Miss Chapman, of Birmingham, who is very clever at sexing birds
and pronounced them to be a cock and two hens. I suppose I am
particularly stupid about this, but to this day they look as much alike
to me as three pins, and I am quite unable to distinguish them. A
small outdoor aviary, unheated, but with cosy bedroom quarters,
was prepared for them, and I gave the bird girl orders to listen in for
a good wireless weather report (a new found blessing to aviculturists),
and to put them out when a warm day was promised. This fortunately
came at Easter, just after I had left England. We betted on the
supposition that they would go to nest at once and get their eggs laid
in the warmth and so escape egg-binding, and this actually happened.
One hen laid, lining the nest just as the other one had done, but
in this case the cock did not sit with her, but spent the day with the
odd hen.
A few days after my return I was thrilled to find three young
hatched, all of which are growing strongly. In both cases the food
supplied was merely canary-seed and white millet, green food, and
a little insectivorous food, though it is doubtful if they do more than
scatter this last on the floor.
The species seems very hardy, not particularly destructive, and
above all tractable in disposition. As we have at last a good importation
of a new species with all these good qualities, and which seems to
breed like a rabbit anywhere and at any time, let us take good care
and waste no opportunity to perpetuate it in our aviaries, and keep up

a healthy stock by means of change of blood. It appears to be a very
local species, confined apparently to an area of a few square miles,
and Mr. Chapman's collector who happened across them said it was an
awful journey down to the coast, so we may not get any more for years
to come.
[Reports have come to hand of others being successful in breeding
this Lovebird, but whether anyone can produce an earlier record
than the above we do not know. At any rate, we should be glad to
publish accounts from any other members who have bred the species
so that our knowledge of its nesting habits may be as complete as
possible. The accompanying coloured plate illustrates two additional
very beautiful species of Agapornis from Tanganyika, for an account
of which see Yol. Ill (Fourth Series), page 154.--Ed.]

By Dr. E. Hopkinson, C.M.G., D.S.O.
Three " Bambara Jobo " (one old and two young) form part of my
present bird-family out here in Gambia, and I hope to get them home
shortly, as they are all in robust health, as they ought to be from the
forefather's name, though as a general rule in captivity they are not.
According to Sclater's Systema Avium Aethiopicarum, their
scientific name is Poicephalus robustus fuscicollis (Kuhl), and for an
English one " Gambia Brown-necked Parrot " indicates their restricted
range, which is given as " Gambia and Portuguese Guinea ". In the
Gambia itself, too, they are distinctly local, at any rate during the
breeding season, for then they are practically confined to the middle
hundred miles of the river, where the mangroves reach their tallest.
They nest in holes in these water-side trees and on their fruit the young
seem to be fed almost entirely, though when older they eat many other
things and are particularly fond of ground-nuts and great pillagers
of the heaps in which these are piled to dry after pulling.
This restricted natural diet is, I expect, the main reason why young
" Bambaras " are usually so short-lived in captivity--at least that with
but few exceptions has been my experience, though old ones live well
enough out here, but, as far as I know, the three years one once lived

172 Dr. E. Hopkinson--The Broicn-Necked Parrot
in the Zoo is about the longest life one has had at home. I hope these will
falsify this belief, for although the old one firmly refuses to eat anything
but ground-nuts, the young are willing to try anything, and are eating
plenty of rice, bread, biscuit, etc., as well as nuts, which is always a
good sign.
The old bird, which is intended for our indefatigable Secretary,
to be tamed as an example of what can be done in that line, is so far
chiefly distinguished for its history and the means by which it became
my property. This involves three parties : (1) a wicked old strong-
headed Parrot (i.e., this bird), which had had the run for a long time
of a native yard ; (2) a careless Joloff mother ; (3) her enterprising but
only toddling Joloff baby boy. One day a month or two ago No. 2
arrived carrying No. 3 in her arms, and No. 1 in a piece of sacking ;
the former was yelling and weeping (quite naturally as the next pro-
ceeding showed), and the latter adding to the din most successfully.
The baby was deposited on the ground and the sacking shaken open ;
out came a much dishevelled shrieking Bambara and a small blood-
stained package, which the mother carefully opened and picking up
the baby almost put the whole into my arms. I then realized the state
of affairs. The poor baby was minus the end of one thumb, and the
small parcel was this thumb, which I was expected to immediately
and successfully replant in its place. So much for a long and wide-
spread medical reputation out here. Of course, I could do nothing more
than put a little dressing on the injured hand and produce lumps of
sugar to stop the crying, which they did at once, and send the mother
away after a lecture on her lack of proper motherly care and especially
in leaving an old Parrot and a young black baby loose in the same hut
together. The biter and the thumb were left with me, the latter by
accident (only discovered later), the former in return for two shillings
of our best present-day brass coinage, to save the bird from the rightly
angered parent, who then departed, disappointed as to her main hope,
but at any rate with a comforted and temporarily quiescent infant.
The main interest to me in the two young birds is that they are
certainly the rubricapillus of Forbes and Kobinson. As soon as I began
to know these Parrots and get specimens at different ages, I felt almost
certain that rubricapillus was merely a juvenile stage of fuscicollis.

Dr. E. Hopkinson--The Brown-Necked Parrot 173
Others I have had confirmed this belief, and now these two (a pair
I believe) make me absolutely sure.
The adult is a thick-set bird with a big strong beak, whose general
body-colour is a dullish green, brighter below, with small red (something
between scarlet and brick-red) shoulder-patches, anklet rings and fore-
head, while the rest of the head is grey tinged with reddish in some
examples, and sharply defined at the neck from the green of the body.
In the young the green is rather brighter and lighter and the whole
head is pink (not red) and as sharply defined at the neck as is the
grey of the adult. There are no red shoulder-patches or anklets, though
one of these two has a suggestion of pink round the ankles (the male
I presume), and the head colour, which is much more pink than red,
is darkest on the crown and paler in front and at the sides. It is a
colour most difficult to describe (vulgarly I think of it as " grog-blossom
nose-colour"), and owing to its shade and the peculiar lie of the feathers,
it looks at a little distance more like bare engorged pink flesh (like a
Vulture's or Turkey-cock's) than plumage. Altogether a young bird
looks most certainly quite a different thing to its parents, for besides the
clear cut between the pink head and green body, the beak of the young
is distinctly smaller and less formidable as a weapon.
This juvenile colour is gradually replaced by that of the adult.
When the young leave the nest the pink head is paler and a cleaner
looking pink, which gradually deepens into that described above ;
this in time changes into grey by feather-growth, for these have grey
bases from the first, which gradually extend, the ends being worn away
(I suppose), till the grey feathers with only pink tips cover the whole
head, and the whole looks grey tinged with pink. After the moult
all the new head-feathers apparently are entirely grey with just a
suspicion of reddish except on the forehead, which is a bright scarlety
red, like the shoulder-patches and anklets.
These two young ones are perfectly tame and delight in being
handled and in human company, though they keep up a sort of com-
plaining whine nearly all the time, but the old one, although he will
tolerate humans within about a yard of him and other birds within
about ten yards, is still pretty wild. The two young ones he merely
notices to bite, and one which foolishly entered his cage, of which he

Aviculturists visiting the Academy should make a point of seeing
Room No. VIII, where they will find a number of pictures of birds,
some representing species apparantly entirely new to ornithology.
First we come to the " Man with the Macaw In his right hand he
is holding up a slice of melon on which is perched a green Budgerigar
(I suppose this is too insignificant a thing to count in the title) and in
his left hand he holds a blue and yellow Macaw with a very thin neck
and particularly brilliant plumage.
The next picture is perhaps the most fascinating of all, " The
Bird Shop ". How many of us know the lure of a bird shop ? We
approach it with palpitating heart and a joyful expectancy, hoping
to find something entirely new and wonderful that we are hoping to
be the happy possessor of. How often we leave with a feeling of
disappointment or anxiety as to whether the new possession is quite
what we expected or whether it is going to condescend to live with us.
In this bird shop there is something to suit all tastes : cages of canaries,
pigeons, a cockatoo or two, and endless green love-birds (species
unknown) which hang in rows. On the left of the door hangs a green
parrot about the size of an Amazon, with a blue head and yellow
breast, guaranteed never to have been imported before !
Near this picture is another entitled " Fine Feathers ". Here we
have two Macaws, the blue and yellow and the red and blue, but these
are so surrounded by flowers that it is not until one looks closer that
one discovers a Sulphur-Crested Cockatoo hanging in mid-air, and on
looking still further a rather washed-out Leadbeater Cockatoo in the
background. As a pendant to this picture is another by the same
artist entitled " Sanctuary ". In this there is a group of Turkeys and
Chickens, also so surrounded with foliage and fern that it is hard to
find them, but as it is their sanctuary perhaps one is not meant to.

At right angles to this we come to " St. John in Patmos ". He is depicted
as a monk holding a white feather in his hand and on his left shoulder
sits an enormous Eagle with white shoulders ; they do not look a very
happy pair. As a contrast to this we next come to " Reflections
Here there is a river with a swan sailing majestically down in the fore-
ground and a few ducks near by. On the left is a grassy lawn on which
further away are more ducks, quite a peaceful scene.
And lastly we find "Rima" kneeling on very green grass surrounded
with exotic flowers on which various species of Humming-birds are
hovering. A snake is stretched out in front of her, and in her right
hand she holds up a " Roseate Cockatoo ". I always had an idea that
Rima came from South America, but perhaps this one lived in Australia ;
anyway, one turns away with a feeling of uncertainty as to how exactly
she and the Cockatoo came to meet.

This being my second trip to New Zealand in five years, I had more
time to observe the bird life than on the first visit, and I was fortunate
in the fact that my daughter's home is right back in the thick bush of
the King Country on the Wanganui River, and we were staying with
her during the breeding season, November and December. This gave
me every opportunity of studying the birds, native and imported.
While on board the Rotorua , about 400 miles east of the West Indies,
a Frigate Petrel, evidently disturbed by the ship, flew on board at
night and, hitting some netting, fell at my feet. He was stunned but
not much the worse, so I put him in a box for the night, releasing him
next morning, when he sailed away quite strong and happy. He showed
no alarm at being handled ; standing on my open palm bowing, as these
birds do, before taking flight. Singularly, another Frigate Petrel
came on board in the same way in the Indian Ocean on the way
home and was treated similarly.
At Curacoa the graceful Frigate Bird, looking like a gigantic swallow,
swept round our ship while taking in oil. I never saw him settle
on the water or eat anything, and from what I gather, few people ever

have done so. Between Curacoa and Panama several Martins came on
board in the evening ; migrants from North to South America. They
are different to our Martins, having the red throat like our Swallow,
but not the Swallow tail, and the general colour is more purple than
dark blue-black. An Osprey or some kind of fish Hawk followed us
one day in the Carribean Sea, perching on the gaff on the mizzen mast,
off and on giving me quite a good view. I was glad to see that the Little
White Heron is made quite a pet of in Panama, and is quite, numerous
on the road to Old Panama. Four I saw in the portico of the President's
Palace looked charming in their rather Moorish surroundings of palm
and pools and marble and mosaic floor. There were large flocks of
" Jack Snipe " so-called, feeding on the shore of Old Panama Bay.
I watched far off, to identify them, and I fancy they were Sandpipers ;
there were also numerous flocks of Geese. The great clumsy Buzzard,
like a large owl in flight, was very much in evidence. The next bird of
interest was the Boatswain Bird, a white gull of which the male bird
has two long thin tail feathers, bright red in colour, unfortunately
much prized by Pitcairn Islanders for sale to people on ships calling
there ; hence the destruction of a beautiful bird for two feathers.
The native birds of New Zealand are becoming scarcer every year
owing to the felling of bush and the cultivation of land, but in the bush
where the growth is so dense that one cannot leave the track without
the aid of a slasher, they are plentiful and happy.
To wake up at 4 a.m. of a spring morning and hear the chorus of
song from Tui, Bell Bird, Thrushes, Blackbirds, and numerous others
was something to be remembered for the rest of one's days. The Kiwi
we hear as we do the Corncrake at home, in the evening after sunset,
but I never saw one ; they are mostly nocturnal in habit and like dense
bush where none can follow. I read the article on Keas in the May
number with interest. I never saw a Kaka Parrot, and they are now
very rare even in the North Auckland district, which with the North-
Eastern Hawke Bay district were the chief stations. By the way, the
pronunciation of Kaka is " Cawcaw ". Nestor notabilis, the Kea,
though much persecuted, is still to be seen plentifully down at Waiho
in Southwestland near Franz Joseph Glacier. The Brothers Graham,
who are great mountaineers and run the hotel at Waiho, are also great

lovers of the natural, and are doing their bit to protect the birds around
them. At any rate, I saw and heard quite a number of them, and most
amusing and interesting birds they are. One day, watching half a dozen
feeding in the paddock opposite the hotel, much as Starlings do, one
suddenly found a toothsome morsel and began calling " Kea-kea-kea ",
and dancing round in great excitement. The others, some little distance
away, immediately began to hop and flop to it, when commenced a
regular football scrum. The owner of the titbit threw himself on his
back on it, and with his claws kept the others off; the row and the antics
for a minute or two afforded the most intense amusement. Another
time one showed great interest in the contents of a bottle that was
standing upright under a shed. It walked all round and then managed
to climb up and look down the neck without knocking it down. I never
saw one in captivity, but I am sure they would make the most enter-
taining pets. I think the birds that interested me most were the
Fantails, very like our Longtailed Tit in shape, but larger and dressed
in black and white. They are very tame and inquisitive little fellows
coming close up and spreading their tails like small Peacocks and flirting
them from side to side while inspecting you with sharp black eye and
emitting sharp little cheeps the while. They are very numerous in the
bush and, being fly-catchers, are of great service to mankind in that
" fly-ridden country ".
There are no Swifts, Swallows, or Martins in New Zealand,
consequently flies of all sorts are a plague; though there are numbers
of fly-eating birds in the bush there are few in the open country.
Of British birds I fancy the Starling, Blackbird, and Thrush
predominate in this order numerically, then Goldfinches, Greenfinches,
Yellowhammers, and, of course, the House Sparrow. The Goldies
have a great time, for I never saw thistle seed more plentiful than in
all parts of New Zealand.
I fancy the earlier importers of British Birds knew as little about
their habits as they did about rabbits ; consequently they introduced
birds that were best left out. It is a pity they cannot get a few Blue
Tits imported to clean the European trees of some of the blight (scaly)
which is killing them wholesale, more particularly the Oak.
My return home was via Sydney, and while there for a week I visited

the Zoo. It is the most admirably situated Zoological Gardens, and
the various animals, birds, and reptiles looked in excellent condition
and in most natural surroundings. Practically no indoor keeping, but
all on the lines of the Stellingen Zoo. The aviaries only have slight
shelter from southerly winds. Of course, they have a climate there,
not winter and July like ours. The Parrots, Parrakeets, and Cranes
made one's mouth water, they all looked so happy and well, and then
to see dozens of pairs of small birds like Gouldian Pinches in perfect
health in the open, when we have difficulty in keeping one pair in health,
made one long for a little more sun at home.

The Parrakeets which we are now going to describe are part of the
same group as includes the Macaws ( Conurince).
They differ from them chiefly in being smaller, having weaker
beaks and feathered cheeks. They are usually very abundant in their
native countries and look very handsome when flying in flocks, as is
their habit.
Conures are easily kept and bred in confinement. When acclimatized
they can winter out of doors, and the ordinary Parrot aviaries suit
them perfectly. The trouble is that they scream and destroy the wood-
work of their houses, consequently they are not very attractive in
confinement.
The majority will live long in cages, become domesticated and very
amusing companions, learning to talk or whistle. Their intelligence
is certainly of a high order. They should have a mixture of seeds,
millet, canary and hemp, to which may be added sunflowers, oats, and
monkey nuts for the larger kinds, also green stuff and fruit. They
stay fairly well if they are allowed their liberty, particularly unpaired
birds.
Some species have bred in captivity, for instance : Conurus nenday,
C. oeruginosus, C. jendaya, G. solstitialis, C. aureus , Conuropsis
carolinensis , Pyrrhura leucotis, P. chiripepe, and P. lucida, Myopsiltacus
monachus, Psittacula passerina, Brotogerys tirica, and B. jugularis.

American Parrakeets are on the whole less attractive to avicul-
turists than their relations in Australia. Green in all shades is their
chief and rather uniform hue, enlivened sometimes with very bright
red and yellow. But the elegance of their shapes, though not to be
compared with the Australian species, their liveliness, their brilliant
and shining plumage suffice to make them very desirable cage and
aviary birds.
American Parrakeets are medium sized and small, and have feathered
faces, except round the eyes in some kinds ; and usually long tails.
But some much shorter-tailed species are included in this group, which
remind one of the short-tailed Parrots.
The species of the genus Conurus are typical of the whole family.
About thirty are known, and many of them have been kept in confine-
ment in Europe. Their characteristic is a long tail and wings in which
the fourth flight feather is sharply attenuated at the tip, and by their
short beaks, having the cere partly bare, leaving the nostrils exposed.
They are divided into several easily distinguishable groups according
to the colour of their rectrices.
(a) Yellow rectrices. This characteristic applies only to the Golden
Conure (C. guarouba), which is very different from all the others in
its bright yellow colouring, the wings only being dull green. This is
a large species measuring 14 inches in length. It inhabits North-East
Brazil, and is unfortunately rarely to be seen in our aviaries. It
is the handsomest of the group.
(b) Rectrices green above, blackish underneath. Several species of
this group resemble the preceding in that their predominating colour
is yellow and their beaks are blackish. Such is C. solstitialis from
Guiana and the Amazon ; it is smaller than the last, and its plumage
is a fine yellow deeply tinged with orange ; its wings and tail are green
shading into blue.
The Jendaye Conure ( C . jendaya) is better known in captivity,
it differs from the above in having a green back, the rest of its plumage
is bright yellow deepening to orange red on the face and abdomen ;
its wings are largely blue. It inhabits the Eastern provinces of Brazil
together with another nearly related species ( C . auricapillus) , in which
the green of the upper parts extends to the occiput and the cheeks,

so that only the front face and the vertex are yellow like the under
parts, with lores and round the eyes red.
Let us also mention in this group the Black-headed Conure
(C. nenday) which has about the same size (roughly 12 inches) and general
appearance. It may easily be recognized among its relations by the
brownish mask which covers the face and the top of the head to the
nape ; the rest is entirely green shading into bluish, and becoming
yellowish on the breast and abdomen. The feathers on the thighs are
bright red and the wings blue in parts. This species, which is often
met with in confinement, comes originally from Paraguay and the
surrounding country.
(c) Rectrices green above, olivaceous golden green beneath. This
group is by far the richest in species, and these may themselves be
divided into two types of differing coloration.
One is characterized by the whitish beak and uniformly green
plumage, only relieved by red markings on the head, the fold of the wings
and the feet. This red colour only appears quite late in the develop-
ment of the bird, and so only adults of these closely related forms
can be identified with any certainty.
One of the best known of this group is the Red-headed Conure
(C. rubrolarvatus) from Peru and Ecuador, about the same size as the
Black-headed Conure, it may be known by its red plumage, which, in
adults, extends over the forehead, cheeks, round the eyes, the fold of
the wings, and the feathers under the wings, and on the thigh
feathers.
C. mitratus strongly resembles it, but is decidedly larger and is only
red on the head and a few scattered feathers on the body ; it is a
native of Bolivia and the North of the Argentine.
We may also mention in this same group C. wagleri from Colombia
and G. finschi from Costa Rica.
Other species, allied to the preceding, may be known by having
no red on the forehead ; such are the Cuban Conure (C. euops), the
Green Conure ( C . leucophthalmus), which may be known by its large
yellow under wing feathers, and the Porto Rico Conure ( C . maugei)
belonging to the island of Mona near Porto Rico. We can only name this
from memory as it has only once been brought to our notice in captivity

in Europe. Lastly, the Mexican Conure (C. holochlorus) has no red at
all in its plumage, which is entirely green even when adult.
Another type of colouring in this same group of Parrakeets is
distinctive owing to the absence of red in the plumage and by having
the wings more or less blue ; in addition the beak is brownish, rarely
light coloured.
The smallest species of this genus belong to this category, among
them C. aztec, which does not exceed 9J inches in length. It is a
native of Mexico and Central America; its plumage is green,
changing to yellowish on the abdomen with the throat and breast
olive brown and the flights partly blue.
C. nanus from Jamaica is a little larger than the above, otherwise
it differs only by its pale beak and browner throat and breast.
The Cactus Conure (C. cactorum ) is very common in Brazil. It is
the same size as C. nanus but its green plumage is enlivened by the
orange yellow of the breast and abdomen, and its eyes are surrounded
by a circle of yellow feathers. This same circle is a characteristic
of two neighbouring species, C. mruginosus from Venezuela and Guiana,
and C. pertinax from St. Thomas' Isle, and Santa Cruz, the last named
is easily recognizable by its orange yellow face.
Lastly this group contains two species which are remarkable in
having a large orange frontal spot: they are Petz's Conure ( C .
canicularis) from Mexico and Central America, a small species, and
the Gold-crowned Conure (C. aureus) from Brazil, which is without
doubt the most frequently seen in captivity of all the Conures. Its
plumage is green above with bluish vertex, below the body is olive,
becoming greenish on the abdomen ; finally, as in all this group of birds,
the wings and tail have blue markings.
(d) Green reduces , the laterals marked reddish brown at the base
of their inner portions.
This last group of Conures only includes two species, the Sharp-
tailed Conure (C. aculicaudus) , which is the most common and inhabits
Bolivia, Paraguay, and the North of the Argentine. It is a fairly large
bird with uniformly dull green plumage, the face and crown of the head
blue. The beak has the upper mandible whitish, the lower brown.
The Blue-crowned Conure ( C . hccmorrhous) from Brazil is rarer ;

it can only be distinguished from the preceding by its brighter green
hue and the forehead and vertex alone being blue, and by its beak being
altogether pale.
The genus Conumpsis likewise near to the true Conures is represented
by the only Parrakeet of North America (0. carolinensis), a bird which
presents a special interest at the present time, but of a retrospective
kind. It was supposed to have become extinct about twenty years
ago owing to the severe persecution it underwent. Formerly very
abundant in the Southern United States, where it pillaged the crops,
it may perhaps still exist, but only a few individuals in the lonely
districts on the Gulf of Mexico.
This bird is about the same size as the yellow-headed Conure;
its plumage is elegant, green beneath, with the fold of the wing, head
and nape yellow, and orange face. At one time it was very common in
the aviaries of amateurs, but can now be seen only in museums, where
it is fairly common, for it is, with the Passenger Pigeon of America,
one of the most recently extinct birds of our day.
The species belonging to the genus Cyanolyseus are the largest
of all the Conures, and thus approach the Macaws. Only two species
are known, very much alike in their plumage. The best known in
confinement is the Lesser Patagonian Conure (C. patagonus),
which attains a length of about 17J inches. Its colouring is
somewhat dull, but varies considerably, and thus reminds us that
this bird deprived of the brilliant colours of its relations, originated
in a temperate climate. It inhabits the Argentine and Patagonia.
Its hue is olive brown with greyish brown throat and breast; the lower
part of the back, rump, upper tail-coverts, and sides', yellow ; the
middle of the abdomen and the tibiae orange red. Pound the top of
the breast is a whitish badly defined band, often interrupted in the
middle. The wings are greenish with the primaries and their coverts
dull blue ; the tail is bluish green.
C. byroni from Chili only differs in being yet larger, its total length
being 20 inches. It is very rare in confinement.
Another Chilian Parrakeet also rare in our aviaries is the Slight-
billed Parrakeet ( Henicognathus leptorhynchus), the only species of
its genus, and distinguished from all other Conures by its exceptional

beak, tbe upper mandible of which has the culmen almost straight,
and is prolonged in front to a sharp point. Its size is that of the larger
Conures, but the general colouring of its plumage more closely resembles
that of the Parrakeets of the genus Pyrrhura. It is dull green with a
grey edging to each feather, particularly clear on the head ; the fore-
head and lores brownish red, likewise a rather indistinct mark towards
the centre of the abdomen. Its wings are green, shot with blue, and the
tail is entirely red with a greenish tip ; the beak is black.
The genus Mierosittaca also contains only one species, M . ferrugineus,
known as the Chilian Conure, very much like the above in its plumage,
but smaller and with a normal beak like that of the Pyrrhura. It is
decidedly the most southern of all Parrots still living, since it is to be
found from Chili to the Straits of Magellan.
The Conures of the genus Pyrrhura are the most typical repre-
sentatives of the group of American Parrots. They have bare beaks
and nostrils, a characteristic which distinguishes them from all the
other types previously described, which always have those parts more
or less hidden in feathers.
Nevertheless the birds of the genus Pyrrhura differ from Conurus in
that the fourth flight feather is of the normal shape as well as by different
colouring in more elaborate and elegant patterns, especially in the
rectrices being almost invariably a rather coppery red-brown, at least on
the underside. They are comparatively small birds ; a large number
of species are known but they are not so frequently met with in
captivity as the true Conures and up to the present only a small
number have been imported. They are hardy and easily bred, and are
far prettier and more pleasing than the typical Conures.
The Red-eared Conure (P. cruentata), a native of South-East
Brazil, is one of the largest species of the genus, yet it scarcely attains
12 inches in length. Its plumage is very variegated if not
particularly brilliant: green, with brown-black head, each feather
narrowly edged with ochre yellow, the forehead and lores brown-red,
the throat and cervical collar blue. The sides of the neck have an
orange spot; the lower back and middle of the abdomen also each have
a large spot of dark red ; the fold of the wing is red, the rest green,
shaded blue : the rectrices, coppery brown, are strongly olivaceous
above.

The Red-bellied Conuke (P. vittala) is also a native of Brazil and
Paraguay. It is smaller than the above, and has much the same
colouring, but differs in having transverse bands of grey and yellowish,
which are conspicuous on the olivaceous ground of the throat and breast.
Besides this the head is entirely green, save for a narrow frontal stripe
of chestnut red, and the fold of the wing is green. This same colour
scheme, characterized by undulation on the breast, which are due to
the edging of feathers either paler or darker, is found in most of the
other Pyrrhura.
The White-eared Conure ( P. leucotis) is certainly the most widely
known in confinement, for all that it is in reality becoming scarcer
and scarcer. A native of Eastern Brazil, it is remarkable by its small
size which does not exceed 8J inches. In its colouring it
resembles P. vittala , but is distinguished by having the top of the
head brown-black, the cheeks chestnut red like the forehead, and the
region round the ears dirty white ; also by the red fold of the wing.
In P. picta from Guiana and Trinidad the light grey edges of the
throat and breast feathers show up clearly on the brown black ground
of the first and the olivaceous hue of the second, which gives a scaly
appearance to this portion of its plumage. The top of the head is black,
the forehead blue, and the auricular region grey. The plumage otherwise
is like that of P. leucotis , but it is a slightly larger bird. It is very
rarely seen in confinement, whereas Lucian's Conure (P. luciani ),
a very near ally, which differs only in having when adult the forehead,
vertex, and cheeks red, is common in captivity and easily reared.
The other species of this genus have no red dorsal spot. P. perlata
from the Lower Amazon is almost the only member of the group which
has been recorded in confinement. It is green, with frontal band,
cervical collar, cheeks, sides, and under tail feathers bluish, the vertex
brown, throat and breast brown with paler or blackish edging to the
feathers ; the abdomen having a reddish mark ; the fold of the wing
and under wings red, the tail coppery brown.
Azara's Conure (P. chiripepe), very closely related to the above
has lately been imported and bred in confinement.
Some fine species contained in this group and unknown to aviary
keepers, may be mentioned ; they are remarkable for the fact that

their great wing coverts form a bright-hned speculum : such are
P. calliptera from Columbia which has a bright yellow speculum tinged
with red, and P. souancei from Ecuador with red speculum.
Of the two species of the genus Myopsittacus only the Quaker
Parrakeet ( M . monachus) is known to aviculture, but of all the Parrots
which we have described, it is the most frequently caged. Originally
from the subtropical parts of South America, Uraguay, Bolivia, and
North Argentine, it can the more easily endure our climate. Its
colouring is very distinct; although not bright it is sufficiently elegant
owing to the contrast between its grey face, throat, and breast, each
feather edged with paler grey, and the green of the rest becoming slightly
yellowish on the flanks ; its flights are blue and the beak whitish. It
is about the same size as the Black-headed Conure ( C . nenday),
but is stouter, and notwithstanding its somewhat quarrelsome nature,
is a much-appreciated cage bird. Unlike all other Parrots, it builds a
purse-shaped nest of twigs.
The three genera of which we still have to speak contain much
smaller birds than those described above. Some are the smallest
Parrakeets yet known. They have, like Pyrrhura, and unlike Myop-
siitacus, the cere bare and the nostrils uncovered.
The shape of the beak, which is slender and laterally slightly com-
pressed, recall the Prologerys , of which about a dozen species are known
and have almost all been imported into Europe. With some the tail
is longer than the wings, as among the most typical Parrakeets, which
they resemble also in their general appearance. The All-green
Parrakeet ( B . tirica) is the giant of the race, although its extreme
length is but 10 inches ; it lias uniformly green plumage, paler and
somewhat yellowish on the face and upper parts of the body, with
blue flights ; it is a native of Eastern Brazil. The Orange-winged
Parrakeet ( B . chiriri) from South-East Brazil and Bolivia is slightly
smaller than the preceding and adorned with a yellow patch on the
wings. The Yellow-winged Parrakeet (. B . virescens) from the
Upper Amazon is a pretty, small species, with bluish face, and wings
which have, besides the yellow patch of the coverts, the primary
irmer flights and the secondaries yellowish white, which contrast with
the blue outer flights.

The other species have considerably shorter but equally cuneiform
tails. In this group we may mention :--\0x25A0
The Orange-flanked Parrakeet (B. pyrrhopierus) from
Ecuador and Peru, which owes its name to the bright orange underwing
feathers which enliven the otherwise uniform green of its plumage.
The Tovi Parrakeet (B . jugularis) is common throughout Colombia
and Central America and characterized by the yellow under wing-coverts
and the olive brown upper wing-coverts, contrasting with the generally
green or bluish plumage, and by a little orange spot under the chin ;
this last characteristic does not exist in the variety apurensis recently
discovered in Venezuela by M. Delacour and brought back alive to
Europe by him.
The Golden-fronted Parrakeet (B. tuipara) from the region
of the Lower Amazon, is adorned with an orange frontal band and spot
under the chin, also a small speculum of the same colour on the wings.
The Golden-winged Parrakeet ( B. clmjsopterus) is a small
species scarcely 7 inches in length, resembling the preceding,
and having like it a whitish beak, but the chin and forehead brown.
It inhabits Guiana and Venezuela.
Lastly the Tui Parrakeet (B. tui) from the Upper Amazon of
the same size as the former and resembling it in its plumage, except
that it has a brown beak and no orange speculum on the wings : on
the other hand its sinciput is yellow and the sides of its head sometimes
ornamented with a post-ocular streak of the same colour.
The birds of the genus Bolborhyncus, less numerous than Brotogerys,
are distinguished by having the beak, and especially the cere, slightly
swollen laterally. They have the massive look of the Short-tailed
Parrots, except B. aymara , which has the tail as long as the wings.
This bird is green, bluish on the wings and tail, head brown fading to
pale grey on the sides as well as on the throat and breast. It inhabits
the Andes of Bolivia, Argentine, and Chili.
B. aurifrons is considerably smaller and confined to Peru ; the
male is green with bluish flights, face and throat yellow, also the middle
of the breast and sides. The female is uniformly green.
The Lineolated Parrakeet (B. lineolatus), the only species which
is common in confinement, comes from Mexico and Central America ;

it differs considerably in plumage from its congeners. Dull green with
face and under parts of the body yellowish, it is ornamented on the back
and sides by black transversal stripes which become spots on the
uropygium and wing and tail-coverts, the quills being black edged
with green.
The last type of Parrot which we have to describe belongs to the
genus Psittacida and are known as Parrotlets. It contains the smallest
of all the American Parrakeets. They are not more than 5 inches in
length and are veritable pigmies among the Psittaciformes. In appear-
ance they are like African Lovebirds ( Agapornis ), with which they are
often confounded by amateurs and dealers.
The Passerine Parrotlet (P. passerina) is a common little bird
in Brazil, and fairly so in confinement. The male is a fine green,
having the face and under parts of the body slightly yellowish, emerald
green round the eyes ; the uropygium and lower back deep sea blue,
also the secondaries and wing-coverts ; the short rounded tail is green,
the beak whitish. The female has no blue at all in her colouring, and
differs considerably from the male.
This bird is susceptible to cold when first brought over, but once
acclimatized it is very hardy and can stand bad weather well, provided
that it is protected from wind and damp. These Passerine Parrakeets
are fairly peaceable with other birds, but frequently attack one
another when in high condition, often with fatal results, so that two
pairs should not be kept together. They go to nest readily in an aviary,
but the eggs are often clear. They will live in a cage, but it is cruel
to keep them shut up for long together.
They should be given hemp, canary, and millet, soaked bread and
greenstuff.
The Parrotlets do well at liberty where owls are not too numerous,
but as the young are very susceptible to cold it is wise to catch them
up before the second brood.
The Blue-rumped Parrotlet (P. cyanopygia) from West Mexico
differs from the above in that the blue parts are turquoise.
The Guiana Parrotlet (P. guianensis) , extending from Columbia
to Guiana and in the Lower Amazon region, is almost entirely
green. The male has only the innermost wing-coverts above and

below blue, the female is distinguished by the complete absence
of this colour.
With the Psittacula, a closely related type of true Parrakeets,

of the New World species of Parrakeets which have been kept alive

The arrival in London of a large consignment of Black-cheeked
Lovebirds is an important avicultural event, as the species appears to
have been imported only once before and that in 1908. The original
consignment went to Germany and was from there doled out in small
numbers to the various dealers in Europe. It is a most desirable species
and a comparatively free breeder.
A very interesting collection of birds, several of which are new
to Aviculture, was received at the zoological department of Messrs.
Gamages on 31st May, having been collected and brought home by
Mr. Webb, to whom belongs the credit of landing them in most
beautiful condition, in fact we have never seen birds, newly arrived
after a long voyage, looking more perfect. Almost any one would have
been suitable for a place on the show-bench.
There were several examples of the White-fronted Bee-eater
(Merops hullochoides), an extremely beautiful species, green with the
forehead white, the crown blue, and the throat bright carmine. A
delightful bird for a sunny outdoor aviary provided with a well-
warmed shelter. A good insectivorous food, plenty of mealworms,
and a piece of meat to attract the flies, are necessities to the success-
ful keeping of Bee-eaters.
The Blacksmith Plover (Hoplopterus speciosus) is one of the most
handsome of the waders, a combination of white, black, and lavender-

grey. There were only three in the collection, two of which went
to Mr. Ezra's collection and the third to the Zoo.
There was a single example of the Bronze-winged Courser (Rhinop-
tilus chalcopterus), a rare summer visitor to South Africa and another
addition to the avicultural list. It is clad in various shades of brown
and sandy buff, and some of the wing feathers are tipped with metallic
violet following a bar of metallic green. This very interesting bird
has also found a home in the Zoological Gardens.
Still another Plover, much smaller than the others, and of which
there were three specimens, was the Three-banded Plover (Mgialitis
tricollaris), a small bird allied to our Ringed Plover, with the breast
ornamented with three bands--black, white, and black.
The Pied Babbler (Craterops bicolor), of which there were several
examples, is a most attractive species, entirely white, with the
exception of the wings and tail, which are black.
There were four specimens of the exquisite White-breasted Sunbird
(Cinnyris leucogaster), which, in addition to its brilliant colouring,
is said to have a very sweet song. Anderson tells us that in the pairing
season its voice is " enchanting beyond description, being a concentra-
tion of the softest trilling and melodious notes ".
These are only a few of the best of a very interesting collection
consisting mostly of rarities. We were glad to see a fair number of
the Crowned Lapwings, of which species a few were imported by the
same collector last year, and so far as we have heard, all have lived.
It has thus proved itself a most suitable species for Aviculture.
Another Starling, new to Aviculture in this country, has been sent
to Mr. Ezra by M. Decoux ; a large bird of a greenish hue with a
conspicuous white forehead. It is the White-capped Starling (Heleropsar
albicapillus), whose natural habitat is Somaliland and probably
Abyssinia. Its portrait appeared in the Ibis for 1860.

Avicultural Notes
The Air Service would seem to be a most excellent means of
transport for birds from the Continent. The Zoological Society recently
obtained some Ruffs and Reeves from Holland which came by aeroplane.
They were only a few hours on the journey, and arrived in excellent
condition.
Mr. H. L. Sich, who has just moved to Worthing, writes : " I believe
my Nyasa Lovebirds are incubating in a 4 inch box placed in an all-
metal canary breeding cage 18 inches by 8 inches wide, where I put
them during the move down to Worthing, as I had no other room.
They started laying before, during, and after the move, so I have left
them where they were." Certainly few birds are so accommodating,
and there would be no excuse if aviculturists allowed this species to
ever become scarce in captivity.
Prince Taka-Tsukasa, a most enthusiastic aviculturist, writes from
Japan :--" I am having quite good luck this breeding season, I have
three grey and four mauve Budgerigars from mauve parents, and now
four more very young birds in the nest and six young blue ones, one
of which turned white, and now ten more small blues in the nest and
some dozens from yellow and green birds. One young Abyssinian
Lovebird, a dozen Reeves and two dozen Amherst Pheasants, three
or four Swinhoes, one Impeyan, four Cabot's Tragopans, and I hope to
have young Pallas' Sand-grouse as I have a bird sitting on five eggs."
The Prince sends his best wishes to his bird friends in England, who,
we are sure, will wish to congratulate him upon his success.
Hearing that the Abyssinian Lovebird had been bred last year by
Mr. Alfred G-. Groves, of Bath, we wrote for further particulars and
the date of leaving the nest, and Mr. Groves writes :--" The Abyssinian
Lovebird bred last year left the nest the second week in June. The
parents came from the late Mrs. Dalton-Burgess' collection. Three eggs
were laid, but only one was fertile, and the young remained in the
nest for a long period."

THE MANAGEMENT OF RED-CAPPED PARRAKEETS
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.9945746" page_id="56220427"  page_num="191" year="" vol="">
Sir, --The rare and interesting Pileated or Red-capped Parrakeet of
Western Australia, although it has been bred in England, is certainly
a tricky bird to manage and to acclimatize. Either it is incurably wild
and nervous, or, if hand-reared, excessively bumptious and greedy.
For many months after importation it is exceedingly subject to chills,
and it is about the only Parrot that ever catches cold through injudicious
bathing.
If one keeps it in a cage with a view to acclimatizing it very gradually,
it proceeds to over-eat itself, even if fed on plain canary seed, and dies
of fits, so one may be faced with the dilemma of turning it out and losing
it from chill or keeping it in and losing it from fits ! After a good deal
of trouble with a bird I could not turn out on account of the cold,
which began to have the usual apoplectic attacks, I tried a strict system
of rationing, allowing it only a teaspoonful of canary seed a day, and
as much fruit and green food as it liked. The plan answered admirably
as it has never had another fit and yet keeps in very good condition.
Birds in an aviary do well on an ordinary mixture, working off any
tendency to fatness by constant activity. At present mine are
desperately anxious to breed, but unfortunately I have only males.

Sir, --From time to time I have seen it stated that the Musky Lorikeet
(Glossopsittacus concinnus) produces a smell of musk. I note that
M. J. Delacour repeats this assertion in his article on Lories in last
month's Magazine. I possessed a pair of this charming Lorikeet for
some considerable time, and in spite of careful observation, never
detected even a suspicion of musk. I should like to know if this species
produces this odour in captivity or only in the wild state, as I presume
it really does produce an odour of some kind to have got its name.
If so, how ? or is the whole matter a fallacy ? Perhaps M. J.
Delacour or any member who has had experience with this species
would be so good as to make known his observations.

THE HARDINESS OF ORNAMENTAL FINCHES

<bodyText confidence="0.939595133333333" page_id="56220428"  page_num="192" year="" vol="">
Sir, -- I have just returned from New Zealand, and it maybe of interest
to some readers of the Avicultural Magazine to hear how my small
birds have fared in the hands of very inexperienced caretakers during
my absence of nine months. Knowing the adverse conditions they
would have to endure while I was away from home, I disposed of many
of my birds before leaving in September last, thirty-nine being the
number left. Included in this number were the following : Javas,
Saffron Finch, Orange Bishop, Nonpariel Buntings, Combassou, Bronze-
wing Mannikin, Zebra Finch, Fire Finch, Pink-cheeked Waxbill, Orange-
cheeked Waxbill, Lavender Finch, Silverbill, Pekin Nightingale, Grey
Singing Finch, Cordon Bleu.
The winter here, I understand, was all before Christmas, the weather
after being mild and damp. The thermograph charts of temperature
in the aviary shelter show twelve days of 10* of frost between 19th
November and 7th December, giving an idea of what the survivors
stood. The birds were allowed freedom to go outdoors or remain in
as they pleased. The result was a loss of fourteen, and included two
Pekin Nightingales, who would bath in the coldest weather late in
the day, two Bronze-wing Mannikins, two Fire Finches, one Lavender
Finch, four Pink-cheeked Waxbills, one Snow Bunting (cat), two
Redpolls (cat).
The Lavender Finch was an old cock I had had two years. Fire
Finches were old birds, two young ones are alive and busy nesting.
Pink-cheeked Waxbills all gone, evidently more delicate than Orange-
cheeked, who have stood it well. If I had been at home I should have
caught up the Pekin Robins and kept them away from too much bathing,
as I had trouble with them the previous winter from the same cause.
All the others are in perfect condition, the hardening seems to have
improved the colour and quality of plumage, particularly in the Non-
pareil Bunting (cock) ; he is a beautiful bird and full of beans. Silver-

bills are as hardy as Sparrows, and breed like them. My old cock Zebra
Finch is thoroughly at home now after his fourth winter outdoors,
and he wants a mate badly. He shall have one and deserves it.
I was really astonished to find the Fire Finches alive, also the
Cordon Bleu ; it only goes to prove that we do not know what birds
will stand hard weather until we try.

NESTING HABITS OF LOVEBIRDS
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.994952090909091" page_id="56220429"  page_num="193" year="" vol="">
Sir, --I wonder what definite and accurate information exists
as to the breeding habits of Red-faced, Peach-faced, and Abyssinian
Lovebirds in a wild state ? I have read that the first breeds in holes
in trees, the second in the nests of the Sociable Weaver-bird, while
a relative of mine, who has lived for some time in Abyssinia, told me
that the Abyssinian Lovebird appeared to be breeding in the nests
of another species of Weaver. It would be interesting to know whether
genuine Lovebird eggs have been taken from the sites mentioned
or from others, and, if so from what others. I have found that the
Madagascar and Black-cheeked Lovebirds, when kept at liberty in this
country, nest readily in holes in trees, as though accustomed to the
practice ; probably the Nyasa Lovebird would do the same. The
Abyssinian Lovebird I have never kept at liberty. The Peach-faced
Lovebird makes no attempt to use trees but searches buildings for an
available nesting place and will make use of a hole such as would
satisfy a Starling. The Red-faced Lovebird makes no attempt to
breed at all, which almosts suggests that it can find nothing in an
English garden at all suitable to its requirements, 'whatever they may be.
It is a very unusual thing for a true pair of birds of any species to pass
year after year at liberty in perfect health and make no attempt at
nesting.

lie called "Wild canaries from Africa ". When I called he only had two
left, both hens, which I bought. I took one up to South Kensington
where it was identified as Anomalospiza butleri. Later on I found a
cock-bird at Harrod's.
They could tell me very little about it at the Museum except that
it was rather rare, which I think must be because being a plain brown
bird with a yellow throat and under parts it has very little to recommend
it to either the specimen hunter or the trapper.
I think mine are nesting now, but high up in the shelter of the aviary
in a basket nestbox where I cannot get at the eggs. If all goes well
I will write a further account of them. I do not know how many were
imported or if any were sold elsewhere. The song is a " Ghee ", rather
metallic, repeated about twelve times, very much like the Corn Bunting
and sometimes like the Meadow Pipit.
It approaches the hen on a perch or on the ground with both wings
fully extended trying to show off as much of the yellow under parts
as possible. They seem to be more of a Bunting than a Finch.
They are not mentioned in the catalogue, vol. xii, which is the only
one I have.

From America :--1 pair Hutchins' Geese, 1 pair Least G-eese (Branta
minima), 1 pair Blue Snow Geese, 4 South American Comb Ducks,
1 female Orinoco Goose, 1 pair Canvas-backed Ducks, 1 male Bose-
breasted Grosbeak, 1 pair Blue Birds, 1 pair Baltimore Orioles. The
last six birds were kindly presented to me by the Zoological Society
of New York, as well as a fine pair of Kangaroos.
Although I had already bought some Bheinardt's Argus in 1924,
which arrived in miserable condition and soon died, the present birds
in my collection are the first to live in good health in Europe. It is
a very desirable addition to my collection of Pheasants. The very rare
Benauld's Ground Cuckoo, which is only represented by half a dozen
specimens in the museums of the world (London and Paris), one which
I gave last year to Lord Bothschild is a notable addition to aviculture.
My friend and associate aviculturist in Indo-China, M. P. Jabouille,
now has seven more in our aviaries at Hui. We have also there, in
good health, three Elliott's Pittas, which, up to this year, had only
been known through the two (male and female) type-specimens in the
Paris Museum, and which we were fortunate enough to rediscover this
year. It is a gorgeous bird, of different shades of blue and green above,
yellow striped with black underneath. I hope to import some alive
on the return from my next trip. M. Jabouille has also live specimens
of the Annamese Pitta, a big brown bird, with a greenish back. The
White-bellied Cissa is also imported for the first time, and is a rare
species. All the Japanese birds, most of them so rare in Europe,
were either presented or procured by my Japanese friends, Prince
Taka-Tsukasa, Dr. N. Kuroda, M. Matsunaga, and F. Mitsui, whose
kindness to me during my visit to their country I cannot acknowledge
sufficiently. All these birds will remain in my collection or in that
of my friend, Mr. A. Ezra.

A PIGMY PARROT
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.973196944444444" page_id="56220432"  page_num="196" year="" vol="">
Sir, --I see in the Avicultural Magazine for June that no
Pigmy Parrots have ever been imported, but I have an idea that
I saw an account, some few years ago, that one or two of these tiny
birds escaped in the Crystal Palace about the time a bird show was to
be held. I am not sure whether judging was far advanced or not.
It was stated at the time that the bird was rare, but I don't know if
the species was settled. Apparently no recapture was made, and the
bird was lost to aviculture. You may be able to ascertain if there is
any record, but I feel sure that I have some foundation for my inquiry.
J. Weir.
[In the Avicultural Magazine for March, 1911, appeared an
account of the Crystal Palace show of that year, from which we quote
the following paragraph : " M; Pauwels sent a so-called ' Pigmy
Parrot which, unfortunately, escaped before the show and was
not re-captured. This bird was not, however, a true Pigmy Parrot
(Nasiterna), but a species of Cyclopsittacus. No specimen of any species
of true Pigmy Parrot has ever been seen in Europe so far as I am
aware."-- Ed.]

We have received daring the month of June magnificent collections of Birds from Abyssinia,
Australia, India, Mexico, and South Africa, and we think we are quite safe in saying that
there have never been such large and splendid collections of Birds to be seen under the same
roof before, not only in England but throughout the entire world, and a visit to our
premises cannot possibly fail to be of great interest to those interested in living Birds.
Perhaps one of the most popular of the Birds which we have recently received is the
Black-cheeked Lovebirds, one of the most desirable of this charming family, and all
interested in a pair or pairs of these most rare and attractive species should not fail to
advise us early.
It may be of interest to Aviculturists to hear that before these Birds had been in England
for a week at least 3 pairs were reported to us as having commenced breeding operations.
Below we give a resume of the more interesting Birds which we have in stock at the
moment, but this list is, owing to the lack of space, by no means complete, and all are
recommended to write for a copy of our Monthly Notes and current Price List:--

As I recently landed three of these birds over here alive,
I have been asked to write something from personal experience about
them in their own country, that is among the high mountains of
South-East British New Guinea, or Papua as it is now officially called.
This is not the first importation, although it has not been exhibited
in the Zoological Gardens before, for in 1909 I brought over for the late
Mr. E. J. Brook no less than seven, comprising four fully adult males
and three females. One male died about a month after arrival, but the;
rest lived for some years ; the longest, I think, eight. These two lots,
however, are the only ones so far to have left their native country
alive, where they live far inland along the tops of steep razor-backed
ridges&amp;apos; very difficult of access, but more of this later.
Like many of the other dark plumagcd Paradise Birds, it is difficult
to describe, with the exception of a few fixed colours about the head
and chest; it changes colour from whichever angle you look at it.
Many would think at a first glance that the greater portion is&amp;apos; black ;
but in reality there is little or no real black about it except the primaries.
The following is Bowdler Sharpe's description of the adult male :--*
" General colour above olive green of a velvety -texture ; ramp
and upper tail-coverts blackish ; wing-coverts black with an olive-green

gloss ; quills black, with a purplish gloss on the inner secondaries ;
tail feathers black, the inner ones with white shafts, and with a beautiful
purple gloss, the edges recurved ; head metallic steel green, with a purple
gloss ; forehead and sides of face as well as the throat and chest
glossy emerald-green; ear-coverts more steel blue, but becoming
purplish as they form a frill on each side of the nape ; sides of neck and
a broad band across the chest bronze velvet, with a lilac or purplish
reflection ; the chest band edged below with fiery copper which
separates the breast from foreneck, rest of under surface coppery red
with metallic green shades on flanks and abdomen. Total length
31 inches, tail about 26 inches."
I may state here that when one of Mr. Brook's birds died, the tail
measured close on 31 inches, and that of another 29J inches. Both were
in unusually fine condition. The basal white shafts of the tail feathers
mentioned above are a very conspicuous feature of the bird and suggest
that it has lost the upper tail-coverts which ought to conceal them.
Another and still more striking peculiarity is the way these long and
broad feathers blow about, and even in a forward direction under the
perch, for all the world as if they were broken at their base or only
badly fastened on to the bird. I remember that after Mr. Gronvold
had been up to Hoddam Castle to make some sketches of the birds from
life, and brought the results back to the Natural History Museum,
it was remarked that it was an impossibility for the tail to assume the
positions he had depicted. My friend, the late Mr. Ogilvie Grant, drew
my attention to it, but I told him it was quite correct, as he himself
found out later, and often referred to it.
This species was first described by Finsch and Meyer in 1885, but
another imposing looking member of the same genus was known as
far back as 1782, but has never yet been brought over alive. 1
The frills formed by the ear-coverts as described by Sharpe are only
seen, however, when the bird displays, and are then one of its most
striking features. In captivity the Stephanies are remarkably tame
and confiding. They took insects from my fingers within half an hour of
being caught. I cannot remember any other species of bird from any
part of the world which would do this, except the still more remarkable

say, comes from the same locality as the Stephanie. They are seldom
found lower down than 8,000 ft., and there are only two other members
of the same family as far as I know found still higher. These are
Sir Wm. Macgregor's Paradise Bird ( Macgregoria pulcher) and.
Lady Macgregor's Bower Bird (Loria lorice). I caught by a fluke one of
the latter in 1909 when catching Stephanies and Meyers, and it lived
for several years over here. When it arrived it was in olive-green
immature stage, but soon moulted out to the adult male plumage. It
was a lovely little bird, and almost as tame as the other two when
caught. Magregoria I have seen alive living as far as I know only on.
Mount Victoria and the adjacent Range, but I have been told
it is a very inquisitive bird, easily attracted by chopping wood or some
such sound; so it looks as if it might be as tame as the others, and
perhaps far easier to catch. The others keep almost entirely to the
highest trees in their region, but there is a time of the year when they
come nearer the ground, when the pandanus fruits are ripe. There are
many species of these weirdly shaped trees in New Guinea from the
coast right up to quite high altitudes, each with a different shaped
fruit, some kinds being of an enormous size. All are eagerly eaten by the
Paradise Birds in their district. Some are of a greasy nature, and make
the birds very fat while the fruit lasts.
I have found the Stephanies rather silent birds. I cannot remember
having heard the three I recently brought home utter one sound during
the time they were under my care, which was over four months.
A female built several nests in Mr. Brook's aviaries, and laid two
eggs, but both were clear, the male bird at the time being in full moult.
It was found to be quite an effort for the males to grow these long tail
feathers perfectly ; so at that time they received special attention in
the matter of food supplies or they were defective in some way. They
had access to outdoor flights on almost every day in the year. They
much preferred to come out on dull, drizzling, and even foggy days.
Their lovely colours are certainly seen to the best advantage out of
doors, in fact, only then can they really be fully appreciated. In their
own mountains the climate is anything but ideal. There is certainly
a short season of clear sunny days, but more often than not it is raw,

exceedingly wet, and with spells when the clouds envelope everything
in a dense wet fog, sometimes for two weeks at a stretch. It seems
strange that living under such conditions the Stephanie and Meyer
appear to suffer no inconvenience when brought down to the hot,
steaming coastlands ; much less so than some of the other Paradise
Birds, such as the Superb and Lawe's Six-plumed, which live at a
lower altitude. The first I brought home came through the Bed Sea
during the month of August, when it was exceptionally hot even for
that month. The present male in the London Zoo did, however, suffer
from the heat one day on the voyage home, and I thought for a time
I was going to lose him. It was in Thursday Island, when taking the
birds on board the boat for Singapore. Owing to a temporary strike
of the wharf labourers, the cages were left standing in an open truck
on the pier in the hot sun for nearly an hour. The men would neither
move them themselves nor allow me to do so. When they were finally
arranged on board I found the Stephanie in a very bad way, and it
only recovered after I had placed it in the shade, turned to catch the
breeze. I kept it in this position all night, and took my bed up along-
side of it to make sure that it was not disturbed by rats, ship's cats,
or the crew. The other two never suffered in the same way. This species
is much less pugnacious than some of the others, for I remember in
1909, when I ran short of cages, I brought two males over together.
This is not advisable though, for if they do not actually fight, one may
be keeping the other from its proper share of the food.
The Stephanies seem to be gregarious and were invariably found
feeding in the same trees with the Meyers. They are not rare in their
own districts. One reason may be that in the plume-hunting days few
of the shooters cared to take the risks of going so far up the mountains
with the attendant difficulties of carrying supplies.
I had hoped to have brought home as many this time as in 1909,
and I should have done so, but the people I took up with me--Leva
Devas--were a truculant lot, adverse, like all Papuans, to leaving their
own region ; impatient of the cold, so that after three days' stay on the
high ridge, and just as I was beginning to get the birds, one discontented
man set the others off, and all started on the three days' march back
to their homes. I should have been left helpless there had I not returned

with them, and no amount of persuasion or bribery would induce them to
remain even one day longer. I found afterwards that a series of big
dances and feasts in their tribe was the real cause and although I was
still among them after these were all over, I could not get them to go
back again.
When I caught my first Stephanies and Meyers on the former
expedition, I recall how great was my anxiety as to whether they would
feed or sulk. Nobody had ever had one alive before, and the Meyer
especially, with its long and delicately curved bill, seemed so ill adapted
to cage life. After leaving the first one alone for half an hour, I anxiously
returned to peep at the cage, when a glance showed that it had already
fed on papayia. I remember my companion (a half-caste Samoan who
acted as interpreter) and I killed the fatted calf to celebrate it. The calf
in this case, I believe, was a solitary bottle of whisky I had among the
stores.
In their habitat these birds never seem to come down into the
valleys, but always to keep to the ridges, probably making long
journeys in this way. If the fruits on the highest ridges are not ripe,
probably those on lower ridges will be. Even after their capture,
troubles are by no means at an end, for it is extremely difficult so far
in the mountains to get a supply of fruits. It must be remembered that
newly caught birds do not take for a long time to the artificial foods
we get them to eat over here ; so there is little or nothing beyond fruit
and live insects to tempt them, and the latter are very hard to get
regularly for any number of birds. Then, again, the heart-breaking
journey back to the coast, when day after day the poor birds are
shaken about on the backs of careless wild savages, who attach no
importance to their load whatever, in fact, they cannot understand what
interest we see in them, or why we lavish so much care over them, or
waste good fruit on them. They are just birds, good to eat, and beyond
that they do not appeal to them in the slightest. Again, these carriers
are just as likely as not to abandon their loads on the trail, and run off
never to be seen again. At certain times during the day the men must
all be assembled to give the birds a short rest and time to eat and drink,
after which, if great watchfulness is not maintained it is more than likely
they will turn the cages upside down and start to carry them off again

in that position. Probably, too, a suitable camping site may not be
reached until long after dark and in pouring rain, when, however
tired you may be, poles have to be cut, flies erected to house the cages,
and others for ourselves ; food cooked, water fetched, and the hundred
and one things incidental to a camp. Then it is impossible to start again
very early in the morning--I mean at five or six o'clock--as all the cages
have to be cleaned, the birds fed and watered, and given a chance to
feed, after which perhaps off again in pouring rain. A little wetting
more or less is immaterial, however, when rivers and streams have
constantly to be crossed. Undoubtedly the most killing parts of all are
those appalling razor-backed ranges which run parallel with the coast
along almost all the mountainous parts of the country. Almost as steep
to climb, some of them, as the sides of a house, and still worse to come
down the other side, many of them only a few feet across at the top,
in one endless procession. Add now to all this, mud, thorns, stinging
bushes, and plants, and almost every known kind of insect pest which
never leave one. Some will naturally ask, why go to all these hardships
and discomforts just for a few birds % To them I can only answer,
I don't know, but something calls one back again and again, although
each time I have been to New Guinea, north, south, east, or west, I
have inwardly vowed that if I got out of the country alive I would
never go back again, but I do. Perhaps it is the call back to nature,
where it is to be found in its wildest and most savage moods.
To me the greatest wonder of all is when I look at these New Guinea
birds safely housed over here at last, however they came through it
all alive ; and I can't help standing before them with my mind going
back to the inaccessible mountains from which they came, their capture,
the anxious moments, the awful camps we had on our march to the
coast, the difficulties of fruit supply ; the wild, fierce-looking men who
carried them, journeys by canoes, schooner, and steamers; the
worrying changes en route to England, and many other hardships only
too soon forgotten in the comforts of civilization again. But the wonder
is still there, and I am the only one who knows it all. Therefore to me
they awaken the same thoughts each time I see them and so long as
they live with us over here.

By E. Maud Knobel, F.Z.S., M.B.O.U.
The family of Amazon Parrots is a fairly large one, comprising some
forty-two or more known species. With the exception of one,
Guildings, they are mostly green in colour, with other brilliant hues,
such as red, blue, and yellow, on the head, wings, tail, etc.
They come from Mexico, the southern parts of North America,
Central America, South America, as far down as Brazil and some
of the adjacent islands.
They vary very much in size, some measuring not more than
8 inches, while others may be as big as 21 inches. Individuals of the
same species sometimes vary considerably in size, due probably to
locality.
Many are well known, like the Blue-fronted, and are imported in
hundreds, or even thousands, every year, to find homes amongst both
rich and poor in England and the Continent. Others are extremely
rare and seldom if ever imported. Two, the Imperial and Guildings,
are almost extinct, and of one, Anattereri , there is not even a skin either
at the Natural History Museum or Lord Rothschild's Museum at
Tring.
One may divide these Parrots into three groups : (1) Those that
have white beaks, which are to be found mostly in Mexico and the
southern parts of North America and the islands, Cuba, Dominica,
Jamaica, St. Vincent, and the Bahamas ; and I may add here that
where a Parrot has a white beak he also has white or yellowish feet.
(2) Parrots that have black beaks with a red or yellow spot, found
mostly in Central America. (3) Those with black beaks, which come
chiefly from Brazil; birds having black beaks have grey feet. There
are exceptions to this rule, but taken as a whole I do not think there
are any Parrots with black beaks found in Mexico, nor are there birds
with white beaks found in Brazil.
The Amazon Parrot in its native state does not build a nest, but lays
its eggs in a hole in a tree. The eggs are white and generally two in
number. With the exception of the Bahama Parrot, which I believe
was bred by the late Mr. Bonhote, none of these Parrots have bred in this
country.

The question of sexing Parrots has often been a problem, for the
plumage in the Amazons is the same in both male and female. Many
suggestions have been put forward for determining the sex, such as the
shape of the beak, whether long and narrow or thick and broad, the
colour of the eye, the shape of the head, whether round or flat, and so
on, but none of these have proved very satisfactory.
Personally I have always sexed my own birds by feeling the pelvic
bones. In the male bird these bones lie so close together that they feel
as if they actually touched, but in the female they are wider apart.
In a young female they may be very close together, though they never
actually touch, but as the bird becomes adult they widen until they may
be an inch or more apart, wide enough to allow the egg to pass through.
In keeping a number of birds together I have noticed that the only
males I have had are as a rule smaller, more compact birds than the
females and the green is of a deeper shade. But male Parrots in
this country are extremely rare, and it is not often that one has the
chance of seeing the two sexes together. One has to ask why this is--
I think there are probably three reasons : First, they are harder to
catch if adults; secondly, they are far more delicate than the
females ; thirdly, the traders go for the big, fine looking birds, and leave
the smaller ones behind as not being so desirable.
Most of this group are eminently fitted for cage and aviary life, and
make charming pets, even the most fastidious person could hardly say
it was cruel to keep a Parrot in captivity. They delight in human society,
and are extremely responsive to kindness, and the more a Parrot is
petted and played with the more fascinating pet will it become. A
Parrot should not be left alone in a room for long at a time, or it will
become dull and mope, and if it has nothing to play with will suffer
from ennui, and may take to feather plucking for the sake of something
to do. Birds treated like this deteriorate in intelligence and become
uninteresting, and are not half so amusing as those that see plenty of
society. That is why Parrots do so well at the Zoo ; they not only have
a constant stream of visitors, but all sorts of titbits are continually
being offered to keep them on the qui vive. No one, therefore, should
undertake to have a Parrot unless he or she is prepared to devote a,
certain amount of time to it.

Parrots are not only highly intelligent and therefore highly sensitive,
but they are very active birds, and need plenty of exercise and amuse-
ment to keep them in health and spirits. Personally I prefer a square
cage with a flat top, with china seed- and water-pots, and I do not think
it matters if it is not very big, as long as a bird is constantly let out to
exercise its wings. I do not mean by this that he should fly about the
room--they are clumsy fliers at the best, and if they have their full
wings have a way of dashing into windows and other objects in the
room, to the detriment of themselves and everything else. So I keep
one wing slightly cut, and if they try to fly they fall on the floor.
They very soon learn this, and by the time the wing feathers have grown
again the desire to fly has probably left them, and they are quite content
to flap their wings on a stand or the back of a chair.
For my own Parrots I have a rather heavy steel dog chain hanging
from my ceiling with a hook at the bottom on which I hang each cage
in turn. Here the birds can climb up and down and exercise their wings
to their heart's content.
I may add here that the links of the chain should be so big that there
is no possibility of the beak or claws being caught. I also give my
birds a small piece of steel chain for them to play with, which I hang on
one side of the cage. They will go through it link by link, an occupation
which keeps them happy and amused for hours.
In all cases steel chains should be used, as brass ones are apt to
get verdigrease upon them, which is poisonous. Parrots also need
something to exercise their beaks upon, and sticks of wood, reels of
cotton, etc., make the most delightful playthings. The best wood is
willow, beech, poplar, chestnut, and hazel, as these will not splinter.
To those living in the country sticks of wood with the bark on are
easily supplied ; but to those living in towns the supply of these often
presents a real difficulty, and to those I would recommend clothes pegs.
They are cheap--about a penny half-penny a dozen--they are made of
a very hard wood that does not splinter, and one will last a few days.
Paper is also very useful, old letters or bits of note-paper they will play
with for a long time.
When once an Amazon Parrot is acclimatized, it is moderately hardy,
and can easily be kept in confinement for many years. The best food

mixture I have found consists of equal parts of the best mammoth
Spanish Canary seed, sunflower seed, and hemp seed ; add to this in
the same quantity a good mixture of poultry corn, containing wheat,
oats, dari, and maize. Personally I prefer white or striped sunflower
seed, as black is apt to stain the excreta, and I am sure it pays well in
all cases to give the very best seed. To this may be added fruit of all
sorts, pea nuts, dry biscuit, and mine always have a small piece of toast
and butter or marmalade for breakfast and a small piece of cake or
sugar for tea. The best fruits are apple, banana, grapes, and
cherries, which they seem specially fond of ; but strawberries and
raspberries I have never found a Parrot care much for. For green food,
lettuce, watercress, and peas in the pod, but no green food should ever
be given that has had the frost upon it.
Coarse sand should be used for the bottom of the cage, which should
be cleaned out daily and a clod of earth for them to peck at every few
days keeps them in health. Water, of course, should be given, fresh
every day, and I always use water that has been kept in a room some
hours and not straight out of a cold water tap. For freshly imported
birds or delicate birds, it should be slightly warmed. The vessel in
which the water is given should be of china and should not only be
rinsed out every day, but wiped dry in order to entirely get rid of the
slimy deposit that water leaves. Many people have an idea that water
is bad, or, at least, unnecessary for Parrots, but when one realizes
that these birds come from a country teeming with moisture and full of
luscious juicy fruits, such as we know nothing of, to be deprived of
water and fed on a hard seed diet is nothing short of cruel. I had a
Parrot once that had been treated like this, and had had no water for
four years--all it was given was a spoonful or two of tea once a day. She
was a fine big bird, but the feathers were hard and dry and had no gloss on
them whatever. I had of course to use great caution in giving her water
at first or she would have over-drunk herself. I gave just a few sips at
a time, until at the end of a week I was able to leave the water in the
cage for her to help herself as she pleased. It was really extraordinary
at the end of a month how different the plumage had become, the
feathers lost all that wiriness and assumed a smooth soft glossy
appearance.

A Parrot should not be left in a draught even for a few minutes ;
at the same time I do not think they should be exposed to the full glare
of the sun ; few birds if left to themselves choose to sit in the sun for
long at a time. They should, I think, too, have their cages covered over
at night, leaving an air-hole at the top ; they like the protection from
light and it keeps them warm.
Most Parrots have strong likes and dislikes, some liking men
best while others attach themselves to women ; it used to be thought
that this was a matter of sex, male birds liking women and vice
versa, but I feel sure that this has nothing to do with it. Why it is,
I do not know, but certain it is that you will never find the same Parrot
equally attached to both a man and a woman. The same way with
children--some love them and get very excited if a child enters the room,
others dislike them and are not to be trusted with them. At the same
time a Parrot seems to learn more easily from a woman than a man,
and they will imitate children in an extraordinary way, laughing
and crying and quarrelling exactly as they do ; the high-pitched shrill
voices seem to appeal to them rather than the deeper voice of a man.
It seems a well-known fact that Parrots more easily pick up sounds
outside a house than those inside, and are able without any trouble to
imitate cocks crowing, dogs barking, motor-horns, the bleating of
sheep, and so on.
The best time to teach a Parrot to talk is when he is quiet, and a very
good plan is after he is covered over for the night to repeat some ten
or twelve times what you wish him to learn, and then without another
word leave the room and let him think it over. Some learn very
easily while others never get beyond a word or two, but all can make
some sort of noise and all can scream at times. If one has a young
bird the screaming can be checked to a certain extent by covering
over, or putting the cage on the floor, or taking him out and distracting
his attention in some way, but an old and inveterate screamer is hard
to do with, for he becomes a nuisance to everybody around him, and
if there are other Parrots he may teach them to take to this horrid
habit.
The best time, too, for taming a Parrot is in the evening, they are
far gentler then and can be coaxed and handled more easily, whereas

in the morning they are often, like some people, inclined to be
" nervy
I never let my Parrots come out of their cages by themselves, but
always make them step on to my hand first. They soon learn to do this,
but it needs a little courage to start the first time with a strange Parrot.
Patience and gentleness are the two great factors for training a Parrot
and gaining its confidence. Never be in a hurry, and once be hasty you
may undo the work of months. But once it is tame there is no end to
what it will allow you to do with it--turn it upside down, roll it on its
back as if it was a ball of fluff, kiss it all over and, in fact, do just what
you like with it, and it will never turn on you, but just play gently
with your fingers,
Sometimes it is a difficult problem to get a Parrot out of the
travelling cage or transfer it from one cage to another. It is useful to
know he will always go upwards. So if you lie the cage he is in with the
door open uppermost, then put the cage he is to go into with the door
open downwards, and having the two doors together, you will find he
will at once walk into the upper cage.
Parrots are long lived and many take a long time before they feel
" at home " in new surroundings. A newly imported Parrot that has
come straight from a dealer generally takes about a month to settle
down, but a Parrot that has come from another home may take
much longer. I had a bird once that belonged to an old lady, and he was
supposed to be a marvellous talker. I heard him several times before
I decided to buy him, so I knew he could talk. But having got him home
he became dumb, and it was over six months before he even uttered a
sound. Then quite suddenly when we were sitting at dinner one night
he started, and we were spellbound. He was certainly a wonderful bird,
and from that moment he was all right. Another time I brought home
a Parrot and apparently it seemed in the best of health, but for three
days it ate nothing and I got most fearfully worried about it. I tried
everything I could think of, but nothing seemed any good ; suddenly
I had a brain-wave, and it certainly was an inspiration--I took the seed
out of the china dish and put it into a zinc one. The trick was done--*
he fed from that moment, and though I have had that bird since 1917,
he still won't eat his seed except in a zinc dish, though he does not

mind the water in a china one. It just shows what conservative
creatures they are.
The age of a Parrot, especially after a few years, is difficult to tell,
but there are certain signs which denote young birds. Very young birds
are generally uniformly green all over, showing no blue or yellow on the
head, or wherever the predominant colour of the adult bird may be,
and no red on the shoulder, but birds as young as that are seldom seen
on the market. When they arrive here they have generally moulted
out, and show some marks of the adult plumage. But even when
moulted out, there are other signs to tell if a bird is young. The eye
is paler and does not show the bright orange or red when the pupil is
being dilated. In the case of birds with black beaks, the beak is greyer
in the young bird, becoming blacker with age, and the nails on the feet
are black at first, afterwards turning grey. The feet in young birds
feel very soft and supple, in older birds they become hard and rough,
and in very old birds extremely so.
To my mind there is no more delightful pet than a young Amazon
Parrot, preferably a Blue-front, that you can bring up and teach as
you like, and they are well worth all the trouble and patience they
involve. But it does mean both of these and a certain amount of risk
too, to get it accustomed to our food and variable climate. The matter
of feeding often presents a difficult problem, for when brought over
they are mostly fed on a food called farina, if not that then on boiled
maize. If only the importers would get them accustomed to hard seed
and water before shipping them, I believe the mortality would be
considerably reduced. Young birds are often very shy about trying
anything new to eat, and it is quite a fallacy to think you can starve
a Parrot into eating what he does not want to. He generally prefers
to die.
If possible it is a good plan to put a young bird near an old
acclimatized one, then when he sees him eating apple or seed or
whatever it is he will be tempted to try it for himself. The dealers often
adopt the plan of keeping two birds in one cage when they first arrive,
as one will copy the other in the way of eating, and they keep each
other warm. But the moment they begin to recover from the long
journey and to get vigorous they will have to be separated, as they

may fight and the stronger will bully the weaker, and they have a way
of going for the toes and biting them off, hence the number of Parrots
one sees without their full complement.
In the case of feeding young birds just imported, or birds that are
sick, I find it is no good keeping to any hard and fast rule. They are
sometimes as difficult to suit as any human baby, and it is often not
a case of what is best for them but what they will condescend to try.
The books tell you never to give tea, coffee, slops of any kind, animal
food, etc., but what are you to do ? A bird that is ill will not as a rule
touch hard seed, one must try something or you will lose your bird. And
I may say here that until a bird is actually dead I never despair. They
may look dying a dozen times a day and yet pull round. I had a case
in point -some few years back in a baby Blue-front. She had only just
arrived, in fact, had only been here an hour or so when I first saw her.
I spotted her at once because of her remarkable plumage and carried
her off. She had been fed entirely on farina, and I tried everywhere in
London to get this stuff but failed, so I had to resort to all sorts of other
things. Bread and milk, bovril and toast, rice-pudding, potato--
she would just give a peck at each in turn and then refuse to even try
it again. Seed, apple, or banana she would not even try. At last one
morning when I uncovered her she looked about as bad as any bird
could, and I thought " Well this is the end ". I tried all the morning to
feed her and induce her to take something, but it was no good. Lunch
time came, and on the table was a plain suet pudding. I cut off a piece
and put it in her cage, and to my utter surprise she tried it, ate it, and
later on I gave her some more and for the best part of a week she lived
on plain suet pudding ! At the end of the week she was ready to try
hard seed, and to-day is one of the handsomest birds I have ever seen
and a very good talker. Well, one has to ask oneself, " What did the
trick ? " " Was it the suet ? " I am very much inclined to think it
was. Anyhow that suet pudding broke down all hard and fast rules
with me. One is told that butter is a thing a Parrot must never touch,
and yet over and over again I have noticed the first thing a Parrot will
go for when let out at a meal time is butter. They seem to crave for it,
therefore can it be so bad for them ?

when I was still in bed I had a message that a little girl had come over the
moors and wanted to know if the lady was there " that knew all about
Parrots ", and if she would come at once to a Parrot that was very ill.
I went and found the bird lying on its side at the bottom of the cage,
with its eyes shut, looking for all the world as if about to give up this,
life. I took it in my hand and gave it a teaspoon of brandy and warm
milk. It opened its eyes. After ten minutes I gave it another spoonful.
In a short time it stood up on its feet and we then gave it some warmed
bovril and toast, which it took and liked. It then got up on its perch.
For a week I visited it, and fed it on warmed bovril and toast, boiled
potato, boiled rice, and boiled cabbage. At the end of that time it
was recovered enough to go back to its hard seed and water. It was a
very old bird, and though it died eventually, it lived for some months
after I saw it. I have given these two examples for what they are worth.
I am not able here to go into the various diseases Parrots may suffer
from ; all I want to attempt to do is to suggest a few of the remedies
I have found of use in bringing young or sick birds round. Warmth is
always a great help. They should be kept in a room that is warmed
during the winter and for a newly imported bird I always keep three
sides of the cage covered for the first few weeks. I never feel a bird is
really acclimatized until it has been through one winter here. But a
really sick bird requires to be kept fairly near a fire. So often, on getting
a young bird home, it develops one of two things, either running at the
nostrils, which means a cold, and may, if not taken at once, turn to
bronchitis or pneumonia, or its digestion goes wrong, and it gets
diarrhoea or the reverse, constipation and enteritis. Once it develops
enteritis I doubt if there is much to be done ; it is a horrible disease and
carries off more birds than almost anything else. But whatever is the
matter a bird should be taken in hand at once and not left for a day or
so before some remedy is tried.
For running at the nostril, bathe the nostril with a piece of cotton-
wool and a few drops of glyco-thyrmoline and warm water, taking care
it does not go into the eyes ; then put a spot of vaseline on the nostrils.
To do this it is best to get the bird out of the cage either on the top or
the back of a chair, then with a cloth over the left hand seize it round
the neck from the back, holding it just so that it cannot bite, but not

tight enough to throttle it, then with the right hand bathe the nostrils,
etc. After a few times it seems to like it; it is soothing and at once
clears the air passages. Substituting sawdust in a thick layer for sand
at the bottom of the cage, and sprinkling this with a few drops of
eucalyptus will help to dry up the catarrh, but one has to remember
that it is pretty strong stuff and very few drops will suffice.
For diarrhoea a few drops of brandy in the water or a small pinch of
prepared chalk in the food. If it still continues, take the bird right off
seed and give some other food, so as to give the stomach a rest. Toast,
which is more digestible than bread, can be given with either warmed
bovril or warmed milk, and I may say here that I have never found
cow's milk very good ; I much prefer using Nestle's, the sweetened kind.
Rusk or arrowroot biscuit soaked in it makes a digestible diet, and to this
may be added a tiny pinch of chalk. Boiled potato, boiled rice, or
porridge can be tried, and apple is a wonderful help. Some birds when
they are ill will only eat apple, and I just let them have as much as
they like.
For constipation, if apple or banana does not help then take them
right off seed, and feed as above. Some birds are terribly thin when
they arrive, and these should be fattened if possible. Rolled or Quaker
oats mixed with the food are very excellent and much liked. Sugar
is also a great fattener. Scott's cod-liver oil emulsion is another splendid
food. Some birds love it and will look eagerly for it while it is being
prepared, others won't touch it, and others it does not suit at all,
causing sickness. The bottle must be warmed until it will run, then take
a teaspoon of it and crumble into it some sponge-cake and give twice
a day. When the pupil looks very black and is much dilated, it generally
means one of two things, either the bird is in pain or the heart is in
some way affected. Putting the bird on a warmed hot-bottle (not too
hot) may give relief for the first, and for the latter warmed black coffee
with brown sugar they will take in a spoon and like, and it helps
to stimulate the heart.
In conclusion there are two things to remember in birds that are
ill. First that the food must be on a level with them, within easy reach,
as a sick bird does not like moving about, or it must be offered to them
from time to time, either in a spoon or pot. Secondly, that an ill bird

requires feeding little and often, a spoonful or so every two to four
hours, and that it should not be left to go all night without something.
It is natural that all parrots should moult some time during the
year, that is shed their feathers, but some do it spasmodically, only
shedding a feather or two now and again, while others may do an out
and out moult. There Seems no rule as to what time of year one may
expect this, as Parrots never seem to settle down to the altered seasons
in this country from their own, and even Parrots belonging to the
same species may not moult at the same time of year, but one is glad
when they do not choose the winter months for this performance.
Parrots about to go through a thorough moult generally start by eating
enormously, entirely finishing up the contents of the seed-dish, and
this should be replenished during the day if necessary ; they should
have as generous and liberal diet as possible to enable them to make
the necessary blood to push out the old feathers and make the new
ones; by doing this one prevents what is known as getting
" stuck in the moult ". It is curious to note that a bird about to go
through the moult always starts by shedding the bastard wing feathers,
also that a feather shed in one wing is almost immediately followed by
the corresponding feather in the other wing.

By J. Delacour
A few years ago Prince Taka-Tsukasa gave us a very full and
interesting account of bird-keeping in Japan, 1 and I knew well that
aviculture was flourishing in his country ; but I must admit that I
was greatly surprised and delighted to see what a high level it has
attained, and admired immensely the way in which the birds are housed,
kept, and bred. In fact, I feel quite enthusiastic about Japanese
aviculture.

J. Delacour--Japanese Aviculture
The reception given to me by Prince Taka-Tsukasa and the members
of the Japanese Cage Bird Club was one which cannot be forgotten.
During the three weeks that I spent in their beautiful country I was the
object of the kindest attentions at every moment, and I cannot
adequately express my grateful feelings. I was therefore able to visit,
in company with Prince Taka-Tsukasa, under the best possible auspices,
not only all the natural and artistic treasures which Japan possesses to
an unrivalled degree, but also the most interesting collections of birds,
breeding enterprises, zoos, and bird-shops.
Perhaps a few words on what I have seen may prove of interest to
our members. It may not be out of place to give some general
information on the different birds which are generally found in captivity
in Japan, and the way they are treated ; but as Prince Taka-Tsukasa's
article already dealt with the subject, I shall be short. 1
Although representatives of almost all groups of birds are to be
found in the zoos and some large private collections, Cranes, Pheasants,
and Waterfowl are the most popular among the big birds. Manchurian
Cranes are very numerous and highly prized. I may have seen quite
one hundred kept in different places. Their value, however, is perhaps
even higher than it is in Europe, as they are so much sought after.
Most of the birds, if not all, are bred in captivity in Japan, and I was
astonished to find that it was quite an easy undertaking. Pairs are
kept in quite small enclosures, with a little water, fed on grain and small
fish. When the young hatch out they are given earthworms for the
first three days. Afterwards they are fed on cut-up fish, which their
parents pick up for them in their beaks. Fertility of eggs increases
with the age of the birds. White-necked and Hooded Cranes which
in a wild state visit Japan in the winter are also to be seen, but they are
much less popular and valuable. Imported Sarus, Demoiselle, and
Common Cranes are often offered ; White Asiatics are rare, while a
fine pair of Black-necked and one Australian Crane figure in the
Tokyo Zoo.
There are good collections of Pheasants in the zoos and some private

and Copper Pheasants 1 being the commonest. The Korean Ring-
necked Pheasant is also very popular. Peafowl of different kinds
are numerous. Among the rarer species Argus, Monauls, Crossoptilons,
Germain's Polyplectron, and Elliott's Pheasants, Crestless, Noble,
and Siamese Firebacks, Sonnerat's Junglefowls, and Cabot's Tragopans
are kept in several collections, while a hen of the scarce Malayan
Polyplectron lives in Mr. Okada's aviaries and some Mikado Pheasants
at Dr. Kuroda's. Chinese and Formosan Bamboo Partridges
(Bambusicola thoracica, B. sonorivox) are common, while Grey and
Red-legged European Patridges are considered rare. Sand Grouse
( Syrrhaptes) are common, as are Chinese-painted Quails and
Hemipodes ; I also saw some Vulturine Guineafowls. Black Swans are
the commonest of the group, Eastern Bewicks and Whoopers being also
occasionally seen ; the Mute Swan is a great rarity in Japan. Geese are
scarce, the only common species being the Eastern varieties of the
Bean and White-fronted and the wild Chinese Goose. Native Ducks,
Mallards, Chinese Spotbills, Mandarins, Falcated, Shoveller, Pintails,
Wigeon, Tufted, Baikal, and Common Teal are often kept, and also
some other species imported from India. African and American Ducks
are very scarce.
Some Pheasants, Partridges, Quails, and Ducks are reared every
year, but it does not seem that, so far, the results have been nearly so
good as in France or in England. However, more Japanese amateurs
are now taking interest in those birds, and no doubt will soon breed
them on a large scale.
Pigeons and Doves are not very numerous, but I have seen pairs of
Jambu and other Fruit Pigeons, Nicobars and Crowned Pigeons of
three species, Plumed Ground Doves, Green-winged and Bleeding
Hearts, Diamond, Zebra, and Peaceful Doves, Crested Pigeons, and
other commoner species. One bird dealer had a fine pair of Gallicolumba
stairei and a Japanese Green Pigeon.
There are many Parrots ; a few Macaws and Cockatoos are kept in
many private or public collections ; among the Amazons, the Yellow-
naped. is considered the best, and many are to be seen. There are many

Lories, more than in Europe, and numerous Palceornis. Australian
Parrakeets are much appreciated ; I have seen all the more ordinary
species, and among the rarest Swift, Barnard's, Many-coloured, Bock
Peplars, Bourke's, and Elegant Grass Parrakeets.
Budgerigars have recently become very popular, even Green and
Yellow fetching #1 a pair or more. Blue, Cobalt, and other rarer
varieties are scarce and costly. Many are now reared in Japan.
Small birds, however, are the favourites with the Japanese, who can
keep and breed them perhaps better than any other people. Both
insectivorous and seed-eating birds seem to thrive as well, if not better
than in any other country.
While many are housed in aviaries similar to ours, most are kept in
cages. Japanese cages are simply wonderful; whether they are open
bamboo cages or breeding-box cages, they are always pretty and most
beautifully constructed. In comparison, our best cages look desperately
coarse, unfinished, and tasteless. It would need pages to give some
idea of their beauty. Open bamboo cages generally rest on a pretty
lacquered tray, from which they remain separated by a movable
barred bottom. For each cage there is a special case, into which it can
be put at night and when it is found necessary ; a wooden shutter
and another one covered with thin paper allow of the cage being shut
in with or without light. Feeding and drinking pots are of pretty
ornamental china. The decoration of some cages is most luxurious,
and I have seen wonderful ones, with gorgeous lacquered and other
ornaments. The usual inmates of such cages are the lovely Loo-Choo
and Japanese Bobins, Blue Flycatchers ( Cycinoplila ), Zosterops, various
Tits and Thrushes,jBedstarts, Bush Warblers, Buntings, Orioles, Jays,
and Magpies, etc. Higher cages are used for Larks. All these native
birds are easily obtainable and commonly kept. Foreign birds are
treated in the same way; among them, many rare species from Formosa
can be found. Malayan and Chinese birds are the most abundant on
the market, where a good many South American and some East
African birds can also be obtained. European, North American, and
West African birds are extremely scarce.
Box cages of a special model are used as breeding cages
for some kinds of seed-eaters, and prove most convenient for Canaries

White Java Sparrows, Bengalese, all domesticated for many years,
and also for the Australian Grass Finches. For the past few years their
breeding has been undertaken most successfully. Hundreds of breeders
exist nowadays all round the Tuner Sea, and especially in Osaka and
around that great city. I have visited a score of such breeders, all of
them being tradesmen, shopkeepers, etc., to -whom bird breeding is
a source of pleasure and profit.
Each breeding establishment consists of several hundred box-
cages, arranged in four or five rows on the top of one another, under
some small wooden hut or corridor with a glass front. Each cage is
devoted to one pair of birds. Usually a breeder keeps some fifty pairs
of Canaries and Java Sparrows and the same number of different
Australian Finches, while 200 pairs of Bengalese are necessary. While
Canaries and Javas reared their own progeny, all the eggs from, the
Australian Finches are given to the Bengalese, who hatch and rear
them better, and being tamer, are much easier to handle. Also the
rarer birds, not being allowed to sit, lay many more eggs all through
the year, with the exception of the moulting time.
Gouldian, Long-tailed, Masked, Parson, Bichenos', and Cherry
Finches are bred every year by the thousand. A man I visited in April
had already reared 200 young Gouldians since the beginning of the year.
Other species are much rarer or more difficult, but I have seen young
Parrot Finches, Crimson and Rufous-tailed, reared in that way. In
spite of the large number thus reared in Japan, Australian Finches still
fetch very high prices, higher than ours, so great is the local demand.
But there is little doubt that the ever-increasing production will bring
prices down before long ; then captive-bred birds, much stronger than
wild caught ones, will be supplied to the European market by Japanese
breeders. In the meantime, we really ought to try their methods, and
increase in that way our own stock, as there is no doubt that their
results are very much superior to those obtained in our aviaries with
this group of birds. The uniform food supplied to seed-eaters consists of
various seeds, green food, and a very good mixture, which I highly
recommend ; white millet immersed in raw yolk of egg, which all
birds eat readily ; it is very easy to make, and keeps for two days.
In Japan all insectivorous birds, native and foreign, are fed on the

same mixture, composed of ground husk of rice and rice itself, salad
and fish meal. Prince Taka-Tsukasa gave us all details of it in his article,
to which I refer our readers ; the percentage of fish meal only varies a
little according to the more or less strict insect-eating habits of the birds.
I sincerely believe that this food is the best of all such artificial foods,
and is much more beneficial than any of our complicated mixtures of
various insect-powders, etc., judging by the longevity and condition
of Japanese cage-birds. One must bear in mind, of course, that no live
insects are given in Japan, except in the case of moult or illness ; meal-
worms are not obtainable. Consequently birds thrive on the artificial
food, and on it only. I have actually seen large numbers of the most
delicate native birds, such as Wrens, different Bush Warblers, Wood-
peckers, Flycatchers, Cuckoos, Orioles, etc., fed in this way and looking
in the pink of health, while I also watched several Birds of Paradise
(King, Bed, and Lesser), Tricoloured, Scarlet, and other Tanagers,
various Sugar-birds and Honey-eaters, etc., in perfect condition,
which never had been given any other food but this mixture, no fruit
or insects whatsoever being put into their cages. Such results speak
for the excellency of the food. It will be interesting to learn that ready
made powder is now sold in Japan at a very reasonable price (a tin of
about 1. litre for 35 sens, or 8 d.) ; all there is to do is to moisten it.
Japanese insectile food is usually given rather damp.

By J. C. Edwards, Los Angeles
Referring to the article in the June Avicultural Magazine on
the breeding of the Abyssinian Lovebird in Germany, permit me to give
my experiences with these and other birds on the west coast of the
United States of America.
We received a dozen or more pairs of the first of these birds that
came to New York, and of these we reserved six pairs for our own flights
and sold the others to different fanciers. These birds have all been
turned into aviaries with other birds, and so far none have bred except
one pair obtained by Mrs. J. Bainfields, of Los Angeles, which laid
four eggs in 1925, but reared only one youngster to maturity. In the

present year they laid four eggs, hatched three, but reared only two of
these, which are doing nicely. These birds are apparently getting ready
for a second attempt. The eggs were laid on a nest made of pieces of
paper and canvas which they pulled off the front protection of their
cage. This pair of birds are in an aviary with some softbills,
and Mrs. Bamford reports that they partake greedily of the mealworms
and gentles intended for the other birds, and believes that her success
is partly due to this insect food.
With the six pairs retained we have had no results to date. We
turned them into one of our large 20 ft. by 40 ft. aviaries, of which we
have twelve, with Budgerigars, and they took possession of the nest-
boxes at once, slept in them every night, but nothing doing as to nests
or eggs. Thinking that they should be in separate pairs, we turned
individual pairs into each aviary, again with Budgerigars. In 1925
prospects seemed good, and we had several nests with eggs, which,
however, unfortunately never hatched. In 1926 we had four pairs alive,
but as we had found that they interfered with the other birds more or
less going into their nest-boxes, we are this season trying them in with
twelve pairs of Cockatiels and two pairs of Redrumps in the same
flight. We have found several eggs, but none hatched to date,
15th June.
I now believe that the failure is entirely our own fault; we go over all
of our nest-boxes every two weeks so as to remove the soiled ones,
infertile eggs, and dead birds, and it seems that these birds do not
bear interference with their chosen box, and leave nest and eggs every
time they are interfered with. However, we keep learning all the
time, and in another year we shall try and have them in separate
smaller aviaries, each pair by themselves, and so arranged that they
will never be disturbed.
The Redrumps have done well so far, in spite of being in with all the
Cockatiels. One pair has six matured youngsters from three broods,
and is busy with the fourth batch. The second pair, obtained later,
Teared two in their first brood, and will probably rear another.
The Cockatiels are doing nicely, they are mostly 1925 youngsters,
but of these several pairs reared young this season.
Of the six pairs of Nyasalands ordered, we received five pairs alive,
nnd these also went with five pairs of the Grey-heads into one of the

large aviaries. These little Brick-heads are surely the most interesting
of birds, they made themselves right at home, and when they saw the
running water took to it at once and had a water and sunbath the
first hour in their new home. The next thing that interested them
seemed to be the nest-boxes, which they took to at once, as on the third
day I noticed some of them carrying nesting material into them. They
do not seem a bit particular as to nesting material, anything was
welcome, strips of paper, string, straw, and feathers were used
indiscriminately. As they have only been in the aviary two weeks it is.
too soon to expect more. One pair that we sold of a previous lot we
had laid four eggs in the second week in their new home, but the female
died egg-bound with the fifth effort.
The Grey-heads are not doing anything so far ; they seem just too
busy watching the Nyasalands and wondering what is coming next.
They have their eyes on anyone coming into the aviary, and are right
there chattering away as if they meant to say " don't you dare to go
near that nest-box ".
All of our birds are out of doors all the year, where they can suit
themselves as to sunshine, shade, fresh running water, and almost
everything else any bird may wish for.
The Bed Bosellas of Mr. Henry Otto reared one brood in 1924,
but did nothing in 1925 ; but this year they laid eight eggs, hatched
four, and reared three to maturity, and are now getting ready for the
second attempt. Mr. Otto also reared successfully a nest of four Long-
tailed Grassfinches, the Bed-eared Bulbuls have four eggs, and the
hen of the Himalayan Bobins is setting on five eggs.
Mr. Cosmos Morgan reports success with five nice Cordon Bleus,
and Mrs. J. Reiser reared seventeen Gouldians from one pair during the
past season.
Of course, there are any number of the lesser Finches, such as
Zebras, Javas, and Mannikins, bred hereabouts more or less successfully.
The great trouble with our aviculturists is that they try to keep too
many birds in the same aviary. It is true they make quite a good show
that way, but the mortality is always high and there are many dis-
appointments which results in some of them giving up birds entirely.
There must be hundred of aviaries in Southern California with no birds
in them, just because they are too much trouble to keep alive.

About a couple of years ago Mr. Chapman sent me a pair of these
very pretty Doves. I lost the hen during the winter, so was glad when
I heard of another consignment being on the market--of these I secured
four pairs and an odd bird, which turned out, fortunately, to be a hen.
The birds were in very poor feather, some being nearly bare, and all
had their primary flights broken or cut off. I put them all together in
a small empty aviary to wait until they were able to fly properly and
be turned out into more roomy quarters. It was some considerable time
before they could do more than run about the floor, also they were very
wild. However, eventually I picked out the best pair and turned them
out into a large out-door aviary, where they soon improved still further,
coming into lovely condition. It is a large aviary, and some time later
I was tempted to turn out another pair, that were ready to go out,
into the same aviary, with the unfortunate result that they were chased
about and killed by the first pair before I fully realized what was going
on. I left the original pair in this aviary all last summer. They kept out
of sight, for the most part making no attempt to breed, until this spring,
when they began inspecting the various nesting places. As so often
happens they chose a very unsuitable one for these particular Doves,
which are somewhat nervous and easily frightened off the nest. The
nest was built in a holly-tree quite close to the outside walk, down which
every one who wishes to go to the aviary either to see or to attend to the
birds has to pass. Two eggs were laid, and they commenced to sit,
but used to fly off when anyone went past. The hen was by far the worst
and eventually she would not go back one evening, though the cock
continued to sit all the night. Next morning, unfortunately, I found the
nest deserted, and the eggs cold. The birds soon started looking for a
fresh nesting site, and again selected a most unsuitable one. I did not
wish to lose a second pair of eggs from the same cause, so determined
to risk driving them away before the eggs were laid by fixing a
substantial screen of yew branches on two sides of the nest. This was
quite effectual. The birds sat closely and never moved from the nest.

One young one was hatched and attended to by both parents almost
night and day, the cock and hen frequently being on the nest together,
and sleeping there at night. The young one was well reared, and did
not leave the nest until it was well able to fly. The first night it roosted
on a tree near the nest beside the cock bird, but afterwards by itself.
The only fact worth noting specially is that the old birds seemed greedy
for mealworms when feeding and also ate gentles. I have never seen
them eat them previously, though they may have done so. The young
bird is very similar to its parents, except that it is a darker brown on the
body, and the face and breast are also darker. I turned out a second
pair into a good-sized aviary, which contained a pair of Monaul
Pheasants ; they have also nested and I think have young ones a
few days' old, though I have not actually been in to examine the nest.
In each case they have used an artificial nest and added some small
sticks, hay, and a few bits of straw. I have not found them trouble-
some with other Doves, of which there are a good number in each of
the aviaries where they are breeding. I give Dr. Butler's description
of them, but would like to say that the difference between the sexes
in colour is very slight, but the hen has a decidedly smaller head. I
had no trouble in picking out two pairs to send away to a friend, and
I correctly sexed the pairs I selected for my own breeding.
Description
The adult has the upper surface of a brownish-olive tint; the fore-
head pinky-white, shading into grey on the crown ; back of head and
nape dark olivaceous-brown, washed with purple ; flights brown, the
inner webs cinnamon ; tail olive-brown, the shafts of the feathers
blackish, the outer feathers darker and tipped with white ; chin and
upper throat white ; cheeks, lower throat, and breast dull vinous ;
chest, abdomen, and under tail-coverts white, the last slightly tinged
on the outer webs with brown ; sides, brown ; axillaries and under
wing-coverts, cinnamon; feet, crimson; bill, black; naked skin
round eye, blue ; iris, brown (?). The female is very similar, the fore-
head less white, and the colouring generally, perhaps, a trifle duller.

Towards the end of last summer I received from a friend four
examples of Zenaidura graysoni. They were young birds not fully in
adult plumage, but otherwise in excellent condition, so after ten days
rest I turned them all out into a large out-door aviary as the weather
was warm and fine. They enjoyed the liberty and ate quite a lot of
green food (privet leaves, grass, etc.). I eventually lost one hen from
this cause. It must have eaten some poisonous weed, as it died some
months later from intestinal inflammation, which had been going on
some time. I soon found out I had only one male and three females
and all the hens seemed inclined to go to nest; so I selected the best
one and removed the other two hens. The pair I left soon started to
make a nest on an old basket nest foundation. Two eggs were laid and
the birds sat steadily ; they were very tame, and I had great hopes of
a successful result, but unfortunately they left the eggs just when they
were hatching. Both eggs were fertile, and the shells were chipped, but
quite cold. As the weather had turned much colder, I decided not to
risk another nest though they started building a fresh one almost
immediately. I took them inside and kept them in during the winter.
In the spring they started to build in the indoor aviary, which is a warm
one ; so I let them continue. However, I nearly lost the hen when she
laid, owing to egg binding. I then took her away, and put in another
hen, which went to nest, laid, and failed as before to hatch. Later I
turned out the original pair, and they proceeded to nest at once, but
again the eggs, which in every case were fertile, failed to hatch. I began
to wonder if I should ever breed them, but the last attempt has been
fully successful, and I have two strong healthy young ones fully
reared, and the pair are sitting again in the same nest. The young were
reared in a small basket nest fixed up under the overhanging roof of
an out-door shelter shed in the large aviary. They were, of course,
well sheltered in this position from all rain, and largely from wind.
The old birds looked after their young very well, and drove away any
other doves that came near when they left the nest. The first few days
they wandered about on the ground, and found their way inside the

shelter-shed and slept on the dry leaves, etc., which cover the floor.
I think this probably helped in the rearing of them, as they had a dry,
warm bed at night. I noticed the old birds ate freely of gentles when
rearing their young. The young resemble their parents to a large
extent, except that they are darker brown, and there are more smoky
black markings on the sides of the wings, almost amounting to a bar.
The eye is dark, and the mandibles brown to black. They are
undoubtedly a true pair, as the cock shows decidedly more cinnamon
on the breast and is slightly larger, though there is but little difference
in the size. I found these doves quite good-tempered with the numerous
other doves in the aviary, but, as frequently is the case, they dislike
any others of the same species, and used to chase an odd hen about,
so I removed her. I shall certainly not leave the two young ones very
much longer in the same aviary. I have seen both the young ones in
the large bird house feeding, and expect to have no further trouble
with them.
Zenaidura graysoni inhabits Socorro Island, and may be described as
follows ---
Upper parts brown ; sides of the neck with a patch of metallic
coppery red ; a black spot below the ear-coverts ; the inner upper
wing-coverts, some of the scapulars and inner secondaries with
black spots ; occiput dark grey ; forehead, sides of the head, throat,
and lower parts rufous cinnamon ; sides, axillaries, and under wing-
coverts grey ; quills brown ; two central tail-feathers brown, the lateral
ones grey, with the basal portion of the outer web brown, the outer
one has also the outer web grey ; all the lateral feathers have the
apical portion grey and an iregular black band between it and the
basal portion : " bill black ; iris, feet, and legs red."

Messrs. Chapman received another large consignment of Lovebirds
early in July from Northern Rhodesia, consisting of Black-cheeks
(Agapornis nigrigenis) and Nyasas (A. liliance), and a number which
were without doubt hybrids between these two species. They are

identical with A. liliance, with the exception that their cheeks are
blackish, some specimens showing this peculiarity very clearly, while
others possess a mere dusky shade on the cheeks. The two species
apparently meet on the border of Northern Rhodesia and Nyasaland,
and these dark-faced birds are clear evidence that the two hybridize
in their natural state, the hybrids being doubtless fertile.
Dr. Amsler pointed out in our May number that these two species
are closely allied, an observation that has been confirmed by the very
interesting discovery of wild hybrids being produced. Such hybrids
are extremely rare in nature, and where these do occur and prove to be
fertile, such fertility seems to be evidence of the two being not distinct
species but races of one and the same species, but the question as to
what is and what is not a species is a difficult one.
It may be said that there, is no evidence that these hybrids will
prove to be fertile, but the fact that many of these birds showed very
little trace of the dark colouring on the cheeks points to their not all
being of the first cross, blit some being the progeny of hybrids mated
with pure Nyasas.
The Zoological Society has received from the Sudan three examples
of the Shoebill (Balceniceps rex), one of the most extraordinary birds in
existence. Its home is on the banks of the White Nile and its tributaries
from Khartoum to the Great Lakes. It has been called the Whale-
headed Stork, though it is probably really a very specialized Heron
with an enormously broad and powerful bill, the precise purpose of
which is somewhat obscure, though we know that fish of some kind
forms its principal diet.
M. Delacour's article on Japanese Aviculture will be read with the
greatest interest by British Aviculturists, who may gather from it some
very useful hints. We always knew that the Japanese were very clever
people, but we now learn that through their cleverness we shall soon
have intensively bred Gouldians and other rare and delicate species
sent over here with a guarantee that they have been " manufactured in
Japan And they are doing it by utilizing their new product, the

Bengalese, as foster-parents in the same way as we use broody hens
for rearing young pheasants.
The Bengalese is rarely imported nowadays, possibly because it is
proving so useful in Japan, but at one time it was one of the commonest
of our aviary birds, but though we had the chance then of putting it to
a very practical use we failed to do so because we failed to recognize
its capabilities.
The use of fish-meal as a food for cage and aviary birds has never
been fully recognized by us over here. It is largely used for feeding
laying hens, and also for turning pigs into prime bacon, and is a cheap
and economical food. We may surely take a hint from our Japanese
friends as to its value as a bird food.
The price of Blue and other abnormally coloured Budgerigars has
sailed up to about three times the amount it was a year ago, and the
reason of this appears to be that the Japanese have recognized the
value of these birds as a commercial proposition, and have purchased
every one they could secure. We shall soon hear of their being bred in
thousands in Japan.
But we must not let our friends have it all their own way. In the
Blue Budgerigar in all its shades, we have a really good thing, and we
may as well make the best of it ourselves and not let all our best birds
go out of the country.
The extremely interesting sight of Sarus Cranes in full flight may be
witnessed almost any day in the neighbourhood of Weybridge, Surrey,
the birds belonging to Mr. Ezra's fine collection at Foxwarren Park,
where there is a small flock of them, two of which have full powers
of flight which they make full use of. Ascending in wide circles, they
may be watched until they almost disappear from sight, to such an
altitude do they attain ; and when they appear to be mere specks in
the sky, they may be heard trumpeting to their companions below.
To watch them planing down in wide circles and finally landing
amongst their companions is a sight not readily to be forgotten.

A very beautiful example of lutinism is that of a Fruit Pigeon that
has recently been added to Mr. Ezra's collection. It belongs apparently
to the species known as the Southern Fruit Pigeon, Crocopus chloro-

bird is of a beautiful golden yellow, reminding one somewhat of the
lovely golden Fruit Pigeons that inhabit Fiji.

Sir, --Dr. Hopkinson's letter in the Avicultural Magazine for
June, 1926, asking for information concerning various genera of
Fringillidce which may have been kept in captivity, has caused me to
check through the records of arrivals at the New York Zoological
Park. I realize that importations to Europe are of chief importance to
most readers of the Avicultural Magazine, but I send the following
notes on Dr. Hopkinson's inquiries, in case they may be of interest.
Two specimens of the Japanese Grey Bunting (Emberiza ( Tisa)
variabilis), were received on 4th July, 1913. These birds were brought
to America from Japan by Mr. K. V. Painter, a member of the
Avicultural Society and presented to the New York Zoological Park.
The Green-tailed Towhee ( Oreospiza chlorum) has been represented
in our collection by a total of sixteen specimens, the first of which was
received in September, 1910. Two birds of this species were sent in
exchange to the Zoological Society of London in October, 1910, but
whether or not they arrived safely I do not remember.
In the course of years we have had three forms of Arremonops :
Schott's Sparrow (A. verticalis), Lafresnaye's Sparrow (A. conirostris
coniroslris), and Richmond's Sparrow (A. c. richmondi).
At the present time we have a single specimen of the White-naped
Sparrow (Atlapetes albinuclia), received 28th October, 1924. This is a
charming species, which should be better known to aviculturists.
The Brown-capped Grey Tanager (Schistochlamys capislrala) was
fairly common in the American market at one time, though it has
recently become scarce. We have had a total of seven specimens, the
first of which, was received in August, 1915. Dr. Hopkinson included this
genus in his list through inadvertence no doubt, as it is commonly
assigned to the Tanagridce .

We have received during the month of June magnificent collections of Birds from Abyssinia,
Australia, India, Mexico, and South Africa, and we think we are quite safe in saying that
there have never been such large and splendid collections of Birds to be seen under the same
roof before, not only in England but throughout the entire world, and a visit to our
premises cannot possibly fail to be of great interest to those interested in living Birds.
Perhaps one of the most popular of the Birds which we have recently received is the
Black^cheeked Lovebirds, one of the most desirable of this charming family, and all
interested in a pair or pairs of these most rare and attractive species should not fail to
advise us early.
It may be of interest to Aviculturists to hear that before these Birds had been in England
for a week at least 3 pairs were reported to us as having commenced breeding operations.
Below we give a resume of the more interesting Birds which we have in stock at the
moment, but this list is, owing to the lack of space, by no means complete, and all are
recommended to write for a copy of our Monthly Notes and current Price,List:--

I conclude my account of this group of New World Parrots with
a list and short description of the different species :--
Guilding's Parrot ( Amazona guildingi). --This Parrot is
exceedingly rare, in fact a short time ago it was thought to be extinct,
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.950854625" page_id="56220475"  page_num="" year="" vol="">
but a few examples are known to have survived, and we now see a
very good specimen in the parrot house at the Zoo. It is a large and
magnificent bird, and its plumage is a rich mixture of yellow, brown,
orange, and blue ; beak white. Habitat , St. Vincent.
The Imperial Parrot (A. imperialis ), like the preceding one, is
another of the largest and most beautiful of its type. Also thought
to be almost extinct, but two years ago the Zoo were fortunate enough
to procure a specimen. The back is green, but the head, neck, and
breast are a wonderful dark purply red, the collar being almost black
purple ; beak horn brown. This Parrot was formerly known as the
" August " Parrot, Amazona ( Chrysotis) augusta. Habitat , the Island
of Dominica.
The St. Lucia Parrot (A. versicolor) is another rare bird; green,
with a blue head and salmon pink breast; beak black with a light
yellow spot. Habitat , the Island of St. Lucia.
Bouquet's Parrot (A. bouqueti). --Another of the big Amazons.

Green with a blue head, and bright red on the upper breast; beak,
yellow-white. Habitat, Dominica.
The Vinaceous Parrot (A. vinacea) is much smaller than any of
the preceding. Green, with a red band on the forehead and lores, red
also in the tail and wings, and the breast wine colour ; beak, red with
a yellow tip. Habitat, S.E. Brazil and Paraguay.
The Guatemala Parrot (A. guatemulce). --A large green bird with
the top of the head blue ; beak, horn colour. Habitat, Central America.
The Green-headed Parrot (A. virenticeps). --Another big bird
very much like guatemalce, but the blue on the head is more restricted,
and is only on the forehead and lores ; beak, horn colour. Habitat,
Costa Bica.
The Mealy Parrot (A. farinosa). --A large green bird with a yellow
orange mark on its head which merges into purple black on the nape.
The plumage has the appearance of being covered with fine white dust,
giving it the name of " Mealy " ; beak, white. Habitat, British Guiana.
The Plain-coloured Parrot (A. inornata).-- It is green all over
with slight purple on the nape of the neck. There is red in the wings,
but not in the tail; beak, white horn. Habitat, Ecuador.
The Mercenaria Parrot (A. mercenaria). --A much smaller Parrot,
dark green above, light green below, red in the wings and tail, and
yellow on the edge of the wing ; beak, black with a yellow spot.
Habitat, Colombia and Ecuador.
The Blue-fronted Parrot (A. cestiva). --These are the most
frequently imported, they make very good talkers, and are lively and
amusing in their ways, and can be thoroughly recommended as pets.
Green with a blue forehead, head, cheeks, and neck yellow, but this
may vary very much, and I have seen some Blue-fronts showing no
yellow and others no blue. There is red in the wing and tail; beak, black.
habitat, Brazil.
The Orange-winged Parrot (A. amazonica). -- Green with the
forehead blue, crown and lores yellow, orange in the wing and tail;

come over here are young showing no yellow collar which they do not
acquire for some years. They are most desirable and talented birds,
but delicate when first imported. Habitat, Western Mexico to Costa Rica.

large handsome bird, green, with the head and neck yellow, a large
splash of red or yellow on the top of the wing, and red in the wings and
tail; beak, white. Some of these make wonderful talkers, but are
very nervous birds when first they come over. Habitat, Mexico.

blue on the front and round the eyes. Very rare. Habitat, Brazil.
Dufresne's Parrot (A. dufresneana ).--A large green bird with
an orange forehead, blue cheeks, orange in the wings and tail; beak,
white with a pink spot. Habitat, Guiana.
Red-topped Parrot (A. rhodocarytha) differs from A. dufresneana

The Capped Wheatear (Saxicola pileata) is an extremely common
bird in Rhodesia, especially around Salisbury, where it is usually to
be seen flying from one small ant hill to another on the bare stretches
of land around the town. It at once attracts attention by its conspicuous
plumage, which is a mixture of black, white, and chestnut.
In the other parts of Rhodesia this bird seems to prefer the sparsely
covered bush veldt, for one never sees it on the wooded veldt. In
the districts where these birds are numerous the ant hills are quite
white with their droppings.
They feed upon ants, grasshoppers, etc., in fact, any small insects
which they may find.
The Red-eyed Dove (Turtur semitorquatus) is exceedingly abundant
in the wooded districts of Rhodesia. It is very much like a large edition
of the Cape Turtle Dove (Turtur capicola), but is somewhat darker in
hue. It is usually seen about in pairs, but in districts where it is not
disturbed or shot it is found in large flocks feeding upon the ground
around the old Kaffir kraals and lands. When disturbed it rises with
a heavy clattering flight and seeks shelter in the nearest tree. It
seldom wanders far from its feeding grounds.
The Red-eyed Dove loves to get into a thick shady tree during the
heat of the day, and there it utters its loud but by no means unpleasant
" coo " and chases its companions from branch to branch.
It nests in the high trees, making the merest apology for a nest,
scarcely more than a dozen or so fine twdgs, on which it lays its two
glossy white eggs.
The large and handsome South African Stone Curlew or Thicknee
((Edicnemus capensis) or Dikkop, as it is known to the Rhodesians,

is found rather sparingly in Rhodesia on the open veldt or in other
places destitute of trees.
It can run with great speed, but is singularly confiding ; when
approached it will run round a pile of stones or an ant hill and wait,
and if one attempts to follow it up it will just play a game of " hide and
seek " with one. Its large soft brown eyes at once attract attention.
This bird's presence is greatly esteemed by the farmers and planters,
especially when amongst the tobacco, owing to the fact that it consumes
great quantities of insect pests. I have frequently seen it in the tobacco
lands running up and down the rows of plants looking for insects.
The charming little Blue-breasted Waxbill (Estrelda angolensis)
takes the same place in Rhodesia as the Sparrow does at home. It is
found all the year round in small parties around the homesteads,
farm buildings, and cattle kraals. Tame, gentle and confiding, it is
encouraged by all except a few brutal white boys who find pleasure
in slaughtering it with air guns. Its melodious " ting-ting " is heard the
whole day long in the gardens and plantations. If one throws a
handful of mealie-meal a yard or so from where one is sitting these
beautiful little birds will flock around to pick it up. The nest, which
I have often found in lemon-trees, looks like a ball of fine grass ; it is
composed of fine flowering grass heads, the entrance being at the side.
The tiny eggs are white in colour.
Tits are rare birds in Rhodesia ; the only one I came across was
the Grey Tit (Parus afer). It is found either singly or in pairs about
the plantations and its habits seem to differ very slightly from those
of the other Tits.
The beautifully coloured Half-collared Kingfisher (Alcedo semi-
torquata ) seems to be the African representative of the European
Kingfisher, a bird which it resembles both in size and colour. It was
exceedingly common by the Umsururu River, near where I stayed,
where one could see it perched on an overhanging reed or branch
quietly waiting for some stray fish to pass underneath. If one happened
to be in a canoe the bird appeared to be entirely indifferent to one's
presence, and it was an easy matter to watch these birds fishing only
a yard away from one ; they seldom flew away until one was close
enough to touch them.

I once saw three of these birds on a reed stem having a whistling
contest, all three were whistling with great gusto and trying to outdo
the others. They were sitting perfectly upright with their beaks pointing
to the sky and their stumpy tails moving up and down at a great rate.
The song was sustained and quite sweet, and until then I never knew
Kingfishers sang.
The Black-bellied Knorhaan or Bustard (Otis melanogaster ) is the
common Knorhaan of Mashonaland, it inhabits the sparsely wooded
veldt, but is especially partial to the old cultivated lands. It lives
in a solitary condition, and owing to the height of the grass is seldom
seen unless put up by dogs or disturbed as one walks through ; it then
flies up and sails along with leisurely wing beats, looking more or less
like a huge black and white butterfly rather than a bird; it flies for a
mile or so before it settles, and then runs with great speed.
The general colour above is a sandy rufous, the feathers being
finely vermiculated, the downy part of the feathers being pink ; the
wing feathers are most beautifully marked and resemble those of the
Sun-bittern ; the under parts in the male are black, in the female sandy.
The plumage of these birds harmonizes so well with their surroundings
that it is almost impossible to see them even when at quite close
quarters.
All the Knorhaans, fourteen of which inhabit South Africa and
Rhodesia, are essentially birds of the great open spaces of Africa,
roaming many hundreds of miles over the veldt, seldom in one place
for any length of time except in the breeding season, feeding upon all
manner of insects, seeds, etc., and like all the other members of the
Bustard family making no nest, merely laying their dark, mottled eggs
in a scrape on the ground under the shelter of a tussock of grass.
These birds seem to be troubled with ticks (one of the curses of
Africa), and I have frequently seen them about the birds' heads ;
one bird which I saw had a huge tick the size of a bean adhering to it
just below the eye.
The Knorhaans have remarkably large eyes, which are usually
dark brown, this gives them a particularly soft and gentle expression.
Of the numerous Larks which inhabit the grass veldt the Rufous-
naped (Mirafra africana) and the Red-capped (Tephrocorys) are the

commonest. They are usually seen on the tops of ant hills singing
their rather monotonous song. There is one kind of Lark (I have never
been able to make out the species) which at certain times of the year
soars to a great height and claps its wings with loud resounding claps ;
while going through this extraordinary performance the bird remains-
stationary for several seconds in the air.
The beautiful Orange-throated Lark (Macmnyx capensis ), perhaps-
the most beautiful of all the Larks, is very common on the open veldt.
In colour it is the usual lark brown above, the lesser wing-coverts edged
with orange and the primary wing feathers with yellow, the throat
is bright orange red, the rest of the under parts clear orange yellow,
the red throat is bordered by a thin black line. The female is duller
in colour.
The habits of this handsome Lark seem to differ but slightly from
those of the rest of the family, except that it is very fond of perching
on the trees, when disturbed it flies to the topmost branch of a high
tree and there remains motionless. It also utters its song from the top
of a tree.
There are numerous Owls in Rhodesia, the most noticeable of all being
the Spotted Eagle Owl (Bubo maculosus). This bird is found in solitary-
state around the wooded kopjes, it seldom if ever flies abroad in the
daytime unless it is disturbed in its retreat, when it flies from tree to
tree, turning round as soon as it alights and blinking at one in such a
manner as would lead one to suppose that its powers of sight in the
daytime were very limited indeed.
This large Owl makes its nest, or rather I should say lays its two
white eggs, on the ground in a slight depression and when the young
are hatched it is extremely bold in their defence, and will take to
subterfuge to lure the intruder away from the nest; usually one of the
parent birds will flutter on the ground as though in its last throes,
rolling over, lying with outstretched wings and screaming, in fact, the
performance is so realistic that one half wonders whether the bird
really is wounded.
The Marsh Owl (Asia capensis) is found, as its name implies, in
the low-lying marshy districts, where one often puts it up out of the long
grass or reeds.

It seems to spend most of the day sleeping in a kind of a nest by
a tussock of grass and sallies forth at the approach of dusk in search
of its prey. When disturbed this bird has a habit of flying very slowly
away and keeping its eyes all the time fixed upon one ; I have seen these
birds literally flying with their heads turned completely round and with
an expression on their faces which conveyed far more eloquently than
words their utter contempt for me.
I had a young bird of this species, but it was terribly fierce, and as
it would not eat we had to cram it, which was by no means a pleasant
job. One night it broke the door of its cage and escaped ; I was
not sorry to see the last of it.
Woodford's Owl (Syrnium woodfordi) is also a lover of the open
spaces on the veldt, and like the Marsh Owl is frequently put up out
of the thick grass. It is very handsome and far from common anywhere
in Africa.
The Cape Barn Owl (Strix flammed) is the commonest of all the owls,
and is usually especially numerous around the farm buildings. One
of these birds used to come every night to a box that was fixed on to
a stable wall for the use of pigeons, and there it would hammer with
its beak on the box for hours at a time, and although I often watched
it I could never find a reason for this strange behaviour.
The Cape Barn Owl is very much like its European cousin, but it is
slightly darker. It combines with the Jackals to break the peace of
the still tropical nights with its horribly raucous voice.
At certain times of the year the Eastern Red-legged Kestrel (Tin-
nunculus amurensis) is exceedingly common, and is seen in flocks of
thousands. It is an inhabitant of the Ear East, Japan, and China,
and it migrates to South Africa during the Northern Winter. Its
appearances are exceedingly erratic : it will appear in tens of thousands
one day, and not a single individual will be seen the next; sometimes
a flock will take several hours to pass over a certain given spot.
It hawks for its prey in the air very much after the manner of a
Swallow, and at certain times of the day great flocks of these birds
can be seen at a great height in the air feeding principally upon
locusts and flying ants, which it catches with its feet. If there is a
swarm of flying ants anywhere the Kestrels are sure to be there,

continually dashing through the swarm and capturing an insect each
time. At other times if there are no flying ants or locusts in the
vicinity the birds will sweep low over the mealie fields, taking any
kind of insect that is to be found.
These lovely Hawks seem to have certain times for resting,
principally in the afternoon, when a flock will roost en masse on the top-
most branches of tall trees, usually dead ones.
The value of these birds to the farmers and planters is inestimable,
for the number of insects which they consume must be enormous.
The Larger Kestrel (Tinnunculus rupicoloides) is a resident, and
is fairly common on the wooded veldt, where a solitary example is
often to be seen perched high up on the dead branch of a tree on the
look-out for its prey. I have only seen it catch and eat large grass-
hoppers and locusts, but no doubt it partakes of larger fry.
The Little-banded Goshawk (Astur polyzonoides) is a fairly common
resident of Mashonaland, but it is never conspicuous like the other
birds of prey, partly on account of its small size and partly because
it keeps in the thickly foliaged trees.
When disturbed it flies with an undulating flight from one thick
tree to another, and hides itself amid the leaves.
The African Buzzard Eagle (Asturinula monogrammica ) is a small
bird, and the name " Eagle " seems rather a misnomer ; superficially
this bird resembles a small thick-set Falcon. It is abundant in Rhodesia,
though I believe it is rare elsewhere. It is found in the wooded districts,
and seems to keep in the vicinity of water, where no doubt its prey is
abundant. This Eagle is a quiet, gentle, and unobtrusive bird, doing
very little harm and feeding upon large insects, principally flying
ants and locusts.
I have nearly always found it in pairs living in the thick and dense
trees ; it is not at all timid, and will allow one to approach quite
closely before it flies away. In colour it is a light powder grey, the under
parts being white finely barred with black, the cere and feet a
coral red.
I did not see a great many of the numerous Eagles that inhabit
Rhodesia, but the species that I have seen and been able to identify
are&amp;apos; the Booted Eagle (Eutoemaetus pennatus), a small brown buzzard-

like bird ; the Tawny Eagle (Aquila rapax), a large bird of a light brown
shade; and the huge Wahlberg's Eagle (Aquila wahlbergi), a bird of
uniform dark brownish grey with large brilliant yellow eyes, which
give the bird a terribly fierce expression.
I have usually seen these birds on the wing, and one's chance
of studying their habits is almost nil, but they are essentially creatures
of the air, and shun the habitations of mankind except occasionally
to steal an Owl.
To me a caged Eagle seems a pathetic creature, a king robbed of
his heritage, with the longing for freedom ever in the expression of
its proud fierce eyes.
Heuglin's Robin Chat (Cossypha heuglini) is fairly common in certain
localities where thick undergrowth is plentiful.
In the dense tangle vegetation of the great ant hills by the Umsururu
River I often found this handsome bird, where it is more often heard
than seen. It has a remarkably rich Thrush-like song, which it utters,
from the centre of a thick bush. It is a shy bird and very difficult
to watch. It appears to keep in pairs.
That strange bird the Wood Ibis (Pseudotantalus ibis), whose home
is in the tropical interior of Africa, is found sparingly in Rhodesia,
but it is only seen in the rainy season or summer, sometimes singly,
but often in pairs and occasionally in small flocks. I have seen as many
as fifteen together. They frequent the swamps, marshes, and the
sides of rivers.
They are large heavy birds, and from a distance look very much
like their near relation, the Marabou.
The Wood Ibis is a shy bird, no doubt on account of its large size,
but by doing a considerable amount of stalking--a rather unpleasant
business when one wears " shorts "--I have been able to observe
these birds at close quarters. They have certain times for feeding,
namely, in the early mornings and evenings ; the other part of the day
is spent in resting.
A number of the birds will congregate together while one of them
does sentry duty, the others spend their time in preening, yawning,
and dreaming, and altogether appearing to be very lethargic ; but on the
slightest sign of danger there is great consternation in the ranks, and

with a great flapping of wings the whole flock rises and circles higher
and higher into the " blue ".
A flock of these huge birds soaring in great spirals with outstretched
motionless wings is a sight to be remembered. A peculiar noise like
the sound of a distant aeroplane is produced when the birds are soaring
high up in the sky.
In colour these birds seem to vary a great deal, some individuals
appear to be a dark brownish grey, while others appear to be nearly
white, their sombre plumage is set off by the huge strangely coloured
greenish yellow beak and red face markings.
Sometimes a solitary bird or perhaps a pair will suddenly drop down
into a flock apparently from nowhere ; this casues a mild commotion,
the other birds lose their lethargic manner and at once become interested
in the newcomers, strutting about with their tails spread and carried
at right angles to the back. The Wood Ibis feed upon any manner of
insect, reptile, or fish, frogs seem to be their favourite diet.
The Great Reed Warbler (Acrocephalus aoundinacus) is a summer
visitor to Rhodesia, and from November to March is found in the
reed beds bordering the rivers. It is a large bird for a Warbler, and
at first sight is liable to be mistaken for a Thrush.
The Grass Warblers of the genus Cisticola are extremely common
on the veldt and in tbe patches of coarse grass and reeds by the rivers,
where they at once attract attention by their loud scolding notes,
which they utter from the top of a tall grass stem or bush, the meanwhile
flicking their long tails from side to side.
These Warblers, of which there are twenty-two different species,
are very hard to distinguish from one another, but the commonest ones
appear to be the Grey-backed Grass Warbler (Cisticola subruficajpilla),
Fraser's Grass Warbler ( C . rufa), and the Rufous Grass Warbler
(C. rufilata). The nests of these birds are beautifully woven structures
of fine grass, and are placed on the ground in the shelter of a clump
of grass. The tiny eggs are white.
Other species of Warblers are plentiful, and are to be seen in
great numbers all over Rhodesia inhabiting the thick bush and reeds
by the rivers and pools, but their skulking habits and general brown
plumage makes them very hard to identify, especially when one thinks

that there are over ninety different species inhabiting South Africa
and many differing but very slightly from each other.
Vultures appear to be fairly common in Rhodesia, and at any time
of the day--except in the early mornings--when out on the veldt one
is sure to see one or more of these huge birds high up in the sky, a tiny
speck quite black against the eternally blue sky.
Vultures travel along at a great speed without a motion of their
huge upturned pinions ; I think that this is accomplished by the bird
floating with an undulating motion and by slightly inclining the wings
at varying angles.
Vultures are spoken of as repulsive birds--certainly their table
manners are not of the best, and the food upon which they feed is
not altogether savoury, at least from our point of view, but when soaring
in huge circles with upturned wings or when sitting on a lofty mountain
crag, the Vulture looks anything but the ignoble bird that he is painted,
also he always keeps his feathers in spotless condition.
Kolbe's and the Black Vulture (Gyps Jcolbii and Otogyps auricularis)
are the common Vultures of Rhodesia, but they are not so common as
formerly, owing to the laying down of poisoned carcases for the large
carnivora : owing to this the Vultures have quite disappeared from
some parts of South Africa.
The Glossy Ibis (Plegadis falcinellus) is sometimes seen consorting
with the flocks of Buff-backed Egrets that wait attendance upon the
herds of cattle, but they are only summer visitors from the more
temperate climates, and are rare in South Africa.
With the coming of the summer and the rains many species of
Duck are to be seen on the secluded pools and small lakes, and the
marshes and swamps.
The Pink-billed Duck (Poecilonetta erythrorhyncha) comes in large
flocks, varying from twelve to many hundreds of birds. These Duck
are wild and shy, though when disturbed they foolishly fly round and
round in circles over the water from which they have risen, making an
easy shot for the gunner.
The South African Pochard (Nyroca erythrophthalma ) seems to be a
rare bird in Rhodesia as far as my observation of it goes ; it is found
singly on the secluded reaches of the reed-fringed rivers, it is usually

comparatively tame ; an individual that I had under observation was
quite fearless and would come swimming round and round as I sat
on the bank. I grew to regard him as a pet, and though I asked for
him not to be shot he was one day slaughtered by a callous youth,
much to my regret.
The beautiful little Pigmy Goose (Nettopus auritus) is one of the most
beautiful of the African ducks. These birds invariably live in pairs
on the quiet reaches and backwaters of the rivers, and many pleasant
hours I have spent in watching these charming creatures ; as soon as
they get used to one's presence, they will paddle round and round in
front of one, each time getting nearer ; this is only done out of curiosity.
I once saw a drake eat a large blue water lily; it was floating
on the water almost at my feet, and as soon as the bird saw that I
meant no harm he swam up, hesitating every few yards ; when he was
within reach of it he stopped, gave me a good look, seized the flower,
which was almost as large as himself, and pushed it in front of him
until he reached his mate, where he proceeded to pull it to pieces and
eat it. The little duck was anxious to get a piece, and she swam
round all the time he was devouring it, but he refused to share it with
her, no doubt thinking that she was quite at liberty to pluck one
for herself.
A very noticeable feature of the drake is the beautiful almoncj
green of the feathers on the back of the head and neck.
The unique and handsome Knob-billed Duck (Sarcidiornis melano-
nota) or Comb Duck is fairly common on the ponds and lagoons,
throughout Khodesia (though not as numerous as formerly) in the rainy
season ; it is to be seen in small parties of from four to six. It is
extremely shy and wary, no doubt owing to the great persecution it
undergoes at the hands of the gunners.
The Comb Duck is a large bird exceeding in size the European
Shelduck, and in colour is brilliant metallic purple blue above, the
speculum being a wonderful copper colour, the neck, breast and the
whole under parts being pure white, the neck and upper breast
indiscriminately spotted with black ; there are two tufts of silky yellow
feathers at each side of the tail. The drake has a peculiar horny knob
or comb on the upper mandible, and in the old males this reaches.

a large size ; it is very noticeable when the birds are in flight. The
ducks are much smaller, being about the size of the European Mallard,
and their metallic plumage is much duller.
These birds roost at night in the dead trees on the river banks.
When feeding they keep a sharp look-out for danger, and upon the
slightest sign of a human being they take wing and travel many miles
before alighting again.
The Long-tailed Cormorant (Phalacrocorax africanus) is an
exceedingly common bird on the rivers, and is often confused with the
Snake Bird or Darter, a bird which it closely resembles both in colour
and form. It is of a bronzed brown colour, each feather being edged
with black, the centre of the breast is light creamy brown ; these birds
Wary a great deal in colour, some being almost black, while others are
nearly buff. They are essentially birds of the water, being perfectly
at home in that element, but are extremely clumsy and ungainly
when in the trees. They swim with the entire body submerged, only
the head and neck being visible above the surface. They can dive and
swum under the water with great agility, and can remain under the
surface for an incredibly long time.
In the evenings the Cormorants come from many miles to roost in
one special tree by the edge of the water, which is usually the roosting
place of Egrets as well. Their food consists entirely of fish.

In June, 1924, I had privately imported from Dutch Guiana
(Surinam) four of these Parrotlets. They arrived in splendid condition
and were put in a large flight indoors, where they soon settled down
and by their behaviour proved to be two true pairs. The hens, I may
say, are easily recognized by their yellowish foreheads, whereas the
cocks are bright green right down to the upper mandible ; also they
show much less blue in the wing. Further, it may be noted that the
pairs faithfully keep together at night, each pair roosting by itself.
For no apparent reason one of the cocks died within a fortnight,
and was soon followed by his mate. The remaining pair I turned

Dr. Wildeboer--Breeding of the Guiana Parrotlet 245
out in an outdoor aviary at the beginning of September. In this aviary
there is a mixed collection of Waxbills, Mannikins, Grassfinches, small
Doves, and also a true pair of Blue-winged or Passerine Parrotlets. How
I wish I had not had the latter, for alas their presence led to disaster.
The Guianas soon chose a square closed nest-box with a round opening
in the front of about 1J inches diameter. In this box there was a little
hay, and it was really meant for a pair of Java Sparrows. As it was
getting rather late in the season I did not think the birds intended
breeding, but merely chose the box for sleeping quarters. On looking
inside, however, I found to my surprise that the little hen had laid.
The egg is white in colour, slightly oval in shape, and a little smaller
than that of a Budgerigar. She laid four eggs, and then I found her one
morning on the floor of the aviary, apparently eggbound. As the
nest-box felt nice and warm inside, I decided not to take her in straight
away, but give her a chance in her own nest. On peeping in again
just before dinner I saw to my satisfaction that the number of eggs
had increased to five. She laid two more eggs without any trouble,
and from now on it was quite an exception to see her out. The cock
must have fed her on the nest, as he spent most of the day feeding
outside. At night, however, he always went into the box, and even in
the daytime he sometimes sat beside the hen. Things looked very
promising and would no doubt have gone all right, had not my cock
Blue-wing at this period died. The hen did not mourn his loss for long,
but tried her hardest to get the cock Guiana for second husband. He,
however, would have nothing to do with her, and at the most only
tolerated her to the extent of allowing her to perch beside him. I have
no doubt that during one of these tolerant moods Mrs. Guiana must
have flown out of the nest for a little exercise. Mr. G. promptly left
the Blue-wing hen and went to his lady-love. Mrs. Blue-wing became
jealous, lost her temper, and scalped her lawful rival to death. And
that was the sad end of my first attempt at breeding Guiana Lovebirds.
It was not until the beginning of this year that I was able to secure
another hen from a well-known London dealer. Twice after advertising
for one I had a hen Blue-wing sent to me. To distinguish the two birds
the feet are a good guide, for in the Blue-wing they are distinctly grey,
whereas in the Guiana Parrotlet they are of a pinkish flesh colour.

246 Dr. Wildeboer--Breeding of the Guiana Parrotlet
I caught the cock bird and put him with the new hen in an indoor
flight. In the beginning of April I put them in the outside aviary.
(Needless to say the hen Blue-wing was first removed.) They soon
went to nest in the very same box, laying seven eggs, and after sitting
for nearly three weeks the hen left them, or rather she left the nest-box, for
there was only one egg to be found, and this was fertile. What became
of the other eggs I cannot say ; as I have neither mice nor any birds
that interfere with eggs in this aviary, I think the birds must have
destroyed them themselves, most likely being disgusted with my
repeated interference.
After a while they went to nest again, choosing another box, the
dimensions of which were 4J in. X 5 in. x 7 in. Except for being only
half its size it was exactly like the first one and also contained a little hay.
On 23rd May the hen laid her first egg, and in all she laid eight
eggs. This was only ascertained later, as she rarely left the nest after
laying ; indeed, she spent most of her time in the nest-box several
days before laying. In the third week of June I had an opportunity
to peep into the nest again and counted four naked youngsters and
four eggs. Two more of these hatched, and the remaining two were
clear. Unlike Budgerigars the chicks remain naked for a long time ;
there seems to be hardly any down, and when the quills appear the
naked skin can still be seen between them. It is quite easy to pick out
the young cocks by the blue in the wings, which is entirely lacking in the
hens. Also the foreheads of the latter are distinctly yellowish.
On 16th July, that is approximately 32 days after hatching, the
first youngster, a little hen, flew out of the nest. The next day two more
left the nest. They do not appear to be wild, and allow one to approach
them within a yard. One of them even came on to my finger. They
are exactly like their parents, only a shade smaller, and quite strong
on the wing, rarely missing the perch they intend to fly to. There are
three more in the nest fully feathered and quite ready to leave it.
In my opinion the Guiana Parrotlet goes to nest more easily than
the Blue-wing, and also is a more reliable sitter, at least, that has been
the case with the pairs I have. They are also much livelier birds and
more pleasing to the eye except for the lovely blue rump and underwings
of which the cock Passerine Parrotlet may boast.

There are three important Zoos in Japan, at Tokyo, Osaka, and
Kyoto. All three are about the same size and importance, Osaka
being perhaps the best. They are well laid out and beautifully planted
with cherry trees, which were in full bloom and looked their best at
the time of my visit.
Each of these Zoos has a good collection*of big mammals : Elephants,
Hippopotamus, carnivorous beasts, and Monkeys, and very good birds.
Nearly all kinds of interesting native birds, big and small, are exhibited.

tion. The young birds are sent to smaller stations in the various
provinces, where they are propagated and finally liberated. The
native Green Pheasant (P. versicolor) and the Corean Ring-necked
Pheasant (P. colchicus karpowi) are extensively bred, while there is a
fine general collection of game-birds, and also of cage-birds, as well
as a nice museum.
It is very gratifying to find that in Japan almost everybody
who is an ornithologist is also a bird protectionist and an aviculturist,
the different aspects of bird study being all the better for the combina-
tion. Aviculturists who keep and breed cage-birds are certainly
more numerous in Japan than in any other country, and perhaps
this fact is not well enough known.
As to larger collections, there are as many in Japan as anywhere
else, and they are just as good. It is true that there are no large
ornithological parks in Japan, as a few exist in Europe, but I have
visited excellent aviaries and some aviculturists have built a large
number of them. As a rule, Japanese aviaries are well built, mostly
of wood, and have very good and roomy shelters ; they resemble
ours in general style, but perhaps are a little smaller on an average.
Most of them are meant for one or two pairs of birds only.
I have visited eight collections, which are considered the best in
Japan, and shall give a short account of them.
Prince Taka-Tsukasa, who visited Europe last year and is well
known to many of us, keeps a large number of birds in his garden in
Tokyo. His present accommodation consists of a bird-room with
cages and some fifty aviaries ; most of them are covered with a wooden
roof. But our member is now building a new home and new aviaries,
larger and more numerous, in the suburbs, where he hopes to move in
a year or so. His collection consists mainly of Pheasants, Pigeons,

Blue Budgerigars, brought from France last autumn, have already
bred and produced a pretty " white " male, while one pair of mauve
(or cobalt) born in the summer, 1925, have already reared two broods,
four mauve and four grey young ones. Guiana Parrotlets breed freely.
Suthoras are very pretty little birds with tiny beaks, quite abundant
on the Shanghai bird-market; their diet is that of the Tits. I had
the pleasure of bringing safely from Indochina a fine male Rheinardt's
Argus Pheasant, Edward's Pheasants, Siamese Firebacks, Tantalus

Dr. N. Kuroda, the well-known ornithologist, lives with his father,
Marquis Kuroda, in a beautiful old house, with a very large and
beautiful garden, situated in the centre of Tokyo. His museum, by
far the best in Japan, is of great interest, and his collection of skins,
especially of Far Eastern birds, is truly excellent. The pearl is a pair
of the exceedingly rare Pseudotadorna cristata, of which only one other

enjoy a most interesting old Japanese sport, in which the birds are
caught by means of a sort of large butterfly net when they rise from
narrow channels. I had the pleasure of taking part in one of those
Duck-catching parties which Dr. Kuroda had kindly organized for
my benefit. In a courtyard close to the garden and on the way to
the museum, there are many aviaries and a bird-room. The jewels are
three males and one female of the fine Mikado Pheasant, a Formosan
species that has quite disappeared from European aviaries, and as
the Government rightly prohibits the capture of this rare bird the only
chance we have of ever seeing it again in our countries lies in Dr.
Kuroda's future success with his birds and new ones he may obtain
through an official permission. There are also Corean and Chinese
Ring-necked, Versicolor, Elliott's and Copper Pheasants, and different
hybrids, Common and Specifer Peafowls, Chinese and Formosan
Bamboo-Partridges, two species of Godwits, Turnstones, Cayenne
Rails, Gulls ( Larus crassirostris), different Parrots, among which a
beautiful and rare Lory ( Eos rubiginosus) , several native Thrushes
(T. cardis, eunomus, hortulorum, pallidus, chrysolans), Japanese Robins
and " Nightingales " ( Horornis c. cantans and H. c. canturians), Suthoras,
Blue Magpies (Cyanopica cyanus japanicus) and different seed-eating
birds.
Marquis Yamashina also owns very nice aviaries and is mostly
interested in Waxbills and other small birds. His aviaries are quite
new, pretty, and convenient; there is one suite of eight and another of
five small aviaries, with roomy houses, each one for a pair of birds.
I noticed among others Diamond Sparrows, Sydney and Crimson-
rumped Waxbills ( Estrilda rhodopyga) with nests and young, three
birds which do not breed in cages. There is also one large aviary for
Spicifer Peafowl, and three others, which can communicate with
two large flights, rather like those of Mr. Ezra, where Corean Pheasants
and many small birds are living. In two pretty cages, in the drawing
room, I noticed pairs of Japanese and Samoa Zosterops. There is also
a bird-room with numerous cages of native birds.
Mr. Takanaru Mitsui is mostly interested in domestic fowls, and
I have seen many very ornamental and curious Japanese breeds in
his large and lovely garden ; of course, the famous long-tailed Phoenix

Fowls, also called " Yokohama " in England, being the most remark-
able one. I have seen cocks with tails 6 to 12 feet long. M. Mitsui
has also a fine aviary, with Amherst Pheasants and many small birds,
including a Scarlet Tanager seven years old. In his house he keeps a
marvellous collection of artistic cages and of pots for food and water,
true works of arts. He also has a wonderful series of water-coloured
drawings and photographs of all the Japanese breeds of poultry.
His cousin. Mr. Takanaga Mitsui, keeps a very large number of birds,
\0x25A0and also of poultry, pigeons, rabbits, orchids, and dwarf trees, all of
the best kinds. Near the house is a pretty and large flight with a fine
\0x25A0pair of Argus Pheasants and many small birds. In his bird-room I
especially noticed a Pied Hombill, a Bald Starling ( Sarcops ), a Wood-
pecker, Long-tailed Tits, and Roulrouls. Farther on one saw pens
with Manchurian, Common, Demoiselle and Sarus Cranes, many
Pheasants' and Parrakeets' aviaries and a large garden for Ducks
and Waders, either native or Indian species. The whole constitutes
a large and fine collection.
M. Hattori keeps his birds in the old Japanese fashion, all in cages,
except for an aviary of Budgerigars. He has a very fine collection
of Parrots and small birds, among which I especially noticed White
Canaries, Colombian Siskins, many Australian Finches, and Dufresne's
Waxbills.
All the above amateurs live in Tokyo. Mr. Y. Matsunaga's garden,
at Fujigori, is one of the prettiest that I have seen, in a most beautiful
situation, the glorious Mount Fuji making a wonderful background
to it. Behind the garden a large piece of ground has been devoted
.to birds. In the garden is a nice small birds' aviary, where Chinese
Quails, Dusky Rails (Porzana fused), Diuca Finches, and Black-headed
Siskins are conspicuous ; there are also several curious hybrids between
the last-named bird and the Canary. In the yard one finds several
rows of good aviaries of different types and sizes, which house Cabot's
Tragopans, Germain's Polyplectrons, Lima's, Elliotts', Reeves', and
many other Pheasants, Sannerat's Jungle Fowl; numerous Parrakeets,
among which there are King, Barnard's, Ornate Lorikeets, Plum-headed,
etc., and many rare Weavers, Waxbills, and Finches, with nests and
young. In the cages of the bird-room is a fine series of native birds,

the rarest being a fine White's Thrush ( Geocichla dauma), a Japanese
Bock-thrush, two perfect albino Larks, and many foreign species,
including Yellow-winged Sugar-birds. A pair of Black Swans on a
stream, while a pair of fine Manchurian Cranes have nest and eggs.
A young one from last year lives in the next enclosure. Many birds
are bred every season in these aviaries. M. Matsunaga is also a very
keen protectionist, and is doing a lot of useful work in that way,
promoting bird sanctuaries and editing excellent popular pamphlets with
coloured plates in the style of those .of the American Audubon Societies.
The last collection that I visited was that of Mr. K. Okada, at
Thami, near Osoka, in the heart of the best bird-breeding district.
This is considered as the most important in Japan. For the number
and rarity of species it can well bear comparison with any other in
the world. So devoted to birds is Mr. Okada that he called his home
after one of his favourites,/&amp;apos; Gouldian Finch House." Behind the house
a large garden has been given up to birds ; aviaries are built all round
and in the middle, with very numerous compartments, so that most
pairs can be kept separate. There are also three bird-rooms with
cages. The whole installation is very substantially built, prettily
arranged, and well kept.
Mr. Okada keeps most species of Pheasants and game birds, the
rarest being Argus, Vulturine Guinea Fowls, Monauls, Noble and
Crestless Firebacks, and above all a female of the scarce Malayan
Peacock Pheasant; there is also a pair of the interesting Formosan
Tree-Partridge (Arhoricola sonorivox), a fine pair of Globose Curas-
sows and Roulrouls. Germain's Prolyplectron and Noble Firebacks
were bred last year as well as commoner species. A Flamingo and some
Ducks inhabit a very pretty flight. His Columbidce are numerous,
and I noticed the following rare ones : Crowned Pigeons, Bleeding-
Hearts, Plumed Ground-Doves, and Jambu Fruit-Pigeon.
The collection of Parrakeets is excellent and very extensive, the
best species being Pennant's, Bauer's and Stanley's Broadtails ; Bourke's

Among the many small birds were all the Australian Finches
existing in Japan as well as most Weavers, Waxbills, and Whydahs,
and Finches are represented. Special mention must be made of the
following: Orange-breasted Flycatcher (Cyornis tickellice), Asiatic
Sun-bird, Tricoloured Tanager, Black-headed and Yellow-winged
Sugar-birds, Tricoloured and Pin-tailed Parrot-Finches, Pectoral and
Rufous-tailed Finches, Sydney and Yiolet-eared Waxbills, Fire Finches

As may be expected from the number of amateurs, bird dealers
are extremely numerous in Japan. The city of Osaka, for an example,
has over one hundred bird shops, fifty of which have been started within
the last two years ; it shows plainly that aviculture is rapidly increasing
in the country.
With Prince Taka-Tsukasa I visited many shops in Tokyo and
Osaka, and on the whole they can well bear comparison with those
nearer home. They are very well stocked and very well kept as a rule.
In almost every one specimens of many delightful native song birds,
such as the Robins, Warblers, Flycatchers, Thrushes, etc., are offered,
each in a pretty bamboo cage, at very reasonable prices. Foreign
birds are always abundant, and there are rare ones too, Chinese and
Malayan species being the commonest. Parrakeets are numerous,
and also Lories and Lorrikeets, which seem to come oftener to Japan
than to England, judging by the quantity and variety seen in the shops.
Some Cranes, Ducks, and Pheasants are also represented in several shops.
In Tokyo there is a dealer who keeps, in Akasuka Park, quite a
fine menagerie, with Elephants, Hippopotamus, Carnivors, Monkeys,
and crowds of large and small birds ; he shows and sells them, and
apparently is doing very well out of it. We have nothing like it in
London or in Paris.
*&amp;apos;*&amp;gt;**$
I hope the above notes will show to many of us, who may think
that we are the only good aviculturists in the world, that our Japanese
friends have not much to learn from us, and our members should do
their best to keep pace with such enthusiastic bird-lovers.

The two illustrations are of the Flamingo Ponds in the Adelaide
Zoological Gardens, which ponds were erected in 1886, and have,
for many years, provided one of the most attractive exhibits of the
Adelaide Zoological and Acclimatization Society.
The Flamingoes have always done remarkably well, and it is very
rarely that a death takes place among them.
Although they have ample space, it is strange that under the
circumstances they have never laid an egg or shown any sign of nesting.
There are nine species of Flamingoes, and they have a very wide
distribution, as they are found in most of the warmer regions of the
earth, Australia being one of the few exceptions. They are essentially
waders, and obtain their food, which consists of waterplants and small
aquatic animals, by placing their heads under water and searching
at the bottom of shallow lagoons or marshes.

A VISIT TO FOXWARREN PARK
On Saturday, 24th July, about fifty members of the Society accepted
the kind invitation of Mr. and Mrs. Ezra to spend the afternoon at
Foxwarren Park.
Although the weather was dull, the drive from Hyde Park Corner
to Cobham in a charabanc kindly provided by Mr. Ezra was very
enjoyable. The party arrived about 3.30, and after a cordial greeting
from our host and hostess, a most pleasant time was spent admiring
the fine collection of foreign birds and mammals. First we visited
the indoor bird-room near the house. This contained some fine
specimens of the Birds of Paradise, Lutino Parrakeets, a perfect pair
of, I think, Mitchell's Lorikeets, one Yellow-fronted Woodpecker,
very tame, and a most lovely and rare bird, and the Lutino Pigeon,
referred to in last month's Avicultural Notes. This must be equal in
rarity to the Blue Alexandrine, and Mr. Ezra must be proud of having
two such unique specimens in his possession.

We now moved on to the large range of aviaries which have been so
well described by Mr. J. Delacour in the February issue. In this
article a detailed list of the birds was given, so only just a few are
mentioned in these notes.
The Spreo and Royal Starlings at once catch the eye, with their
glorious colouring, but equally charming are the Bee-eaters, Touracous,
Giant Wliydahs with their flowing tail feathers, and the dainty little
Diamond Doves. Personally I could spend hours by these aviaries
with never a dull moment, and most likely the rest of the party could
do the same.
The Parrakeet aviaries were next visited, and here lives that
exquisite freak, the Blue Alexandrine and his Lutino mate. I hope
in the near future they may nest. Who knows what new colour their
offspring might be ! A pair of Barrabands had a fine healthy family
of three on the wing in another aviary. All the birds seemed perfectly
happy and in splendid condition. With housing as near perfect as
possible, it could scarcely be otherwise.
We now made our way back to the house, where tea was ready,
and after a short rest, visited the large enclosure of about 16 acres of
paddock and wooded land. Here, amidst the gorse and heather,
live wallabies, Red kangaroos, blackbuck, and deer. Many are
quite tame and come up to be fed and petted. Roaming about also
were Saras and Demoiselle Cranes, Chukar Partridges, and several
species of Pheasant, including Monauls. Under the trees we saw
the nest of a Brush Turkey. These birds do not incubate their eggs,
but lay them in a heap of leaves and let the natural warmth of the
decaying leaves do this for them. Mr. Ezra did not know at the time
of our visit what the nest contained, but we hope he will be able to
report a success later.
The clouds which had threatened more than once during the day
now broke, and rain began just as we were starting for home.
London was reached about 8.15.
On behalf of the Members and their friends I should like to thank
Mr. and Mrs. Ezra for the most enjoyable time spent with them at
Foxwarren Park.

CONCERNING HOODED PARRAKEETS
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.989263315789474" page_id="56220504"  page_num="256" year="" vol="">
Sir, --I had the opportunity recently of seeing on their arrival at
Mr. Chapman's a pair of Hooded Parrakeets, not in fully adult plumage,
but far enough advanced in the moult to enable one to see what
the ultimate colour distribution would be.
It is this matter of colour and its distribution which prompts-
this note concerning these Parrakeets because one feels that the
variations (? different species or subspecies) of Hooded Parrakeets
are not completely tabulated in any one book.
I do not pretend to a wide knowledge of these birds ; I have only
seen eight live specimens and three of these were in immature plumage :
these latter were on exhibition (on deposit) in the Parrot House at
the Zoo in May, 1923. I was told they belonged to M. Delacour.
Among the remaining five there were, however, three quite distinct
and different types of adult male, and my note concerns these. I have
never seen the Golden-shouldered Parrakeet (P. chrysopterygius ) with
the primrose-coloured front (forehead) as pictured in Mr. Seth-Smith's
book Parrakeets , and do not include this in the tabulation, otherwise it
makes a fourth variety of these interesting and beautiful birds.
The varieties I have seen are as follows :--*

adult birds put up for breeding. The male had a uniformly chestnut-
brown coloured hood and an orange lower abdomen and under tail-
coverts, and was obviously the bird described by Professor Collett
and named by him P. dissimilis. I note that in correspondence on
this subject in the Avicultural Magazine for 1912 and again in his.
big work on The Birds of Australia, Mr. Gregory Mathews states
definitely that Professor Collett's description must have been incorrect,
but if he was describing a bird such as the one I saw no other words
to my mind could have described it more accurately. I made particular
note of the colours and their distribution at the time. I had to wait
to see Miss Clare about another bird, and spent the wait looking at
these. I had no particular interest in Parrakeets then, but being much
struck by these noted their colours, asked what species they were.

and which I think I again saw in June this year. This bird was very
like the Golden-shouldered Parrakeet as pictured in Mr. Seth-Smith's
book save that it had no primrose front, i.e. it had a black hood and
the feathers of the abdomen and under tail-coverts white barred
with red.
I rather think this bird must have been one of a batch of six or
seven imported by the late Mr. Hamlyn early in 1923, and that the
three immature birds I saw at the Zoo on deposit in that year were
from the same batch ; if so, and if they did belong to M. Delacour,
perhaps he could tell us if they also turned out to be of the type referred
to here. Taking into account the date of arrival and their immature
plumage, one thought that this small batch of birds might have been
part of the proceeds of the rediscovery of the " Golden-shouldered
Parrakeet (P. chaysopterygius) " [s^c] reported by Mr. McLennan,
of the Royal Australian Ornithological Society, at Cape York Peninsula
in the Emu in October, 1922, and referred to in the Avicultural
Magazine in February, 1923, in Mr. Seth-Smith's article. The bird
I saw, however, was not a true P. chrysopterygius, nor have I seen
this type described.
3. The type as imported by Mr. Chapman in July this year, which
have the black hood and an orange lower abdomen and under tail-
coverts and are the type figured in Mathews' big work as the " Black-
hooded Parrakeet (P. dissimilis)
One can but conclude that these four varieties of the Golden-
shoulder, for they all have the shoulder marking identical, are local
variations of the same bird ; whether they should rank as different
species or only as subspecies is a matter for the systematists, but one
strongly inclines towards the latter. The matter is exactly comparable
to Barnard's Parrakeet and its local variations, known as B.b. whitei,
B.b. macgillivrayi, and the variety (unnamed so far as I know) which
has no yellow band on the abdomen, a particularly beautiful female
example of which last was shown at a Crystal Palace Show recently
by the Marquess of Tavistock ; four varieties here also.

The question has been raised as to whether the chestnut brown-
headed variety (1) is an early adult male plumage, which becomes
black subsequently, but the pair imported by Mr. Chapman show
the moult from juvenile plumage to black direct, and this whs also
confirmed by the late Mr. Hubert Astley in 1912 when he bred them,
though which of the types of Hooded he possessed, whether orange or
red and white underneath I do not know, but they had black
hoods.
It is a pity that there is confusion as to the naming of these varieties,
for instance, if one sees the name P. dissimilis is one to put Mathews'
or Collett's interpretation on it ? Or again, does P. cucullatus apply
to the first, second, or third variety I have spoken of ?
These local varieties taken into account with the well-known
variations from type of nearly all Australian Parrakeets of the
Platycercus, Barnardius, and Northiella groups, and others, and the
fact that their hybrids are said to be fertile seem to point to the fact
that Australian Parrakeets generally must be in a particularly active
state of evolution, more so than any other mammalian or avian--
or indeed vertebrate--group that one knows of, unless one excepts
such animals as dogs, cats, pigeons, and--lately--Budgerigars ; but
in contradistinction it must be remembered that all of these latter have
evoluted purely by artificial selection, so the comparison is not a fair one.
Though much averse to the idea that hybridization may give rise
to new species, particularly as hybrids are so commonly infertile,
one was much struck by a male hybrid, Eedrump (P. haematonotus)
X Bluebonnet ( N . haematogaster) (or so it was catalogued) exhibited
at the Crystal Palace Show already referred to, it almost exactly
resembled a male Many-colour Parrakeet (P. varius), yellow front and
all! and some of the Platycercus and Barnardius hybrids at present
on exhibition at the Zoo strongly remind one of other but nearly
related species.

[There is no doubt that Australian Parrakeets vary very con-
siderably according to the locality in which they occur. They vary
also with age, and we are inclined to think that the difference in colour

Sprawson is accounted for by the different ages of the specimens in
question.
The bird described with a chestnut-brown hood is, however, of
very great interest, as it appears to answer to Collett's original
description of P. dissimilis, which description has been generally
considered to have been incorrect owing to the fact that subsequent
specimens all had black hoods in the males, although agreeing in every
other respect with his description. Mr. North named these black-
hooded birds P. cucullatus. Certainly the brown head is not a sign of
immaturity, but may it not be a sign of old age ? It would bo
interesting to know what became of Miss Clare's specimen.
In any case this is a very interesting observation and it only shows
that we have a good deal yet to learn about these extremely beautiful

SIZES OF CAGES FOR BRITISH BIRDS

<bodyText confidence="0.997337764705882" page_id="56220507"  page_num="259" year="" vol="">
Sir, --The law as to the size of cages for British birds was explained
to the Plymouth magistrates on Friday, 9th July, in the course of a
case against Samuel Shepherd, of 15 High Street, Plymouth, for confining
two Goldfinches in cages which were not large enough to permit them
to stretch their wings freely. Inspector John Mulloy, of the R.S.P.C.A.,
said that a lot of people who kept birds in small cages did not know
what size cages were stipulated by law, and he therefore wished to take
that opportunity of informing the public what the position really was./
In the case of Larks the cages must be 18 inches long, 10 inches wide,
and 9 inches high ; for Chaffinches, Greenfinches, Goldfinches, Bull-
finches and birds of a similar size the minimum measurements were
10 inches long by 8 inches wide, and 9 inches high ; and for Twites,
Siskins, Redpolls and Linnets the size was 9J inches long, 7 inches
wide, and 9 inches high. With regard to the summons against Shepherd
the Inspector said that the defendant had now provided the birds
with a larger cage, and he therefore applied for its withdrawal, a course-
to which the magistrates consented.

THE NY ASA LOVEBIRD
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.982655333333333" page_id="56220508"  page_num="260" year="" vol="">
Sir, --Perhaps my experience up to date in regard to the breeding
\0x25A0of the Nyasa Lovebirds may be of some interest as it differs somewhat
from that of Captain Stokes. I obtained a pair from Mr. Hedges in
April, which I turned into the outdoor aviary about the end of the
month. Almost immediately they began stripping the bark from some
apple-tree boughs and carrying this to the nest-box they had selected.
Three eggs were laid, one was unfertile, one I unfortunately broke, and
the third was hatched on 19th May. The young Nyasa is a sturdy little
fellow, but is still as I write (1st July) in the nest-box, although he looks
fully fledged. The parents are building again, and sleep in the box at
night. It strikes me as being curious that the bird bred by
Captain Stokes emerged from the nest when only a month old ; whereas
mine, at six weeks, has not attempted to leave home ? The nest-box is
now so full of twigs, grass, etc., etc., that it is a constant source of wonder
to me how it can accommodate the three birds.

as well as the one in a cage. The stronger cock of the outside couple
took to feeding his companion all day long, and one afternoon I found
the latter very quiet and showing the preliminary symptoms of a fit.
I at once caged him and half-starved him for a few days, allowing him
no seed at all. On his return to the aviary I provided only a limited
quantity of plain seed, and there has been no further trouble. Oddlv-
enough, it seems to be only tame Pileateds that so persistently over-
eat themselves. Before the w~ar I had several of the same species, some
of which lived for many years and nested, and I never had the least
trouble with their diet, either in cage or aviary ; all of these were
incurably nervous and unsteady.

WHITLEY'S CONURE

The subject of the coloured plate is a large Conure, which has lived
for some time, and is still living, in Mr. Herbert Whitley's collection at
Paignton. It had puzzled many of us as to what species it belonged to,
and when it came to London last February for the Crystal Palace Show,
Mr. Whitley allowed me to take charge of it and send, it to South
Kensington to be identified. Here it was examined by a conference of
ornithologists, who pronounced it to belong to a species undescribed.
It had been originally purchased from Mr. Chapman and had probably
come from Brazil, though its exact habitat was unknown.
Mr. N. B. Kinnear described this bird in the Bulletin of the British
Ornithologists' Club , vol. xlvi, page 82, naming it after Mr. Whitley.
He gives its generic title as Aratinga, a name which is said to have
priority to that of Conurus, and which it must supersede. Its
official name therefore is Aratinga whitleyi, Kinnear.

SOME PECULIAR ACTIONS OF BIRDS

A year or two ago, when there was a Wood-Hoopoe in one of the
aviaries outside the small bird house at the Zoo, I noticed with con-
siderable interest that it was probing the inside of a monkey-nut
husk with its bill, while holding it against the perch with its foot.

Frank Finn--Some Peculiar Actions of Birds
I consider this a peculiar action, because in the matter of using their
feet in dealing with an object, or depending on their bills alone, birds
are very conservative, and no bird I know of allied to the Wood-Hoopoes
uses its foot in this way. In climbing on the wires the action of this
bird was like a Woodpecker in action, though less active, while on the
ground it also hopped with the tail dragging in Woodpecker fashion.
When it flew I noticed that it drew the neck in and held the feet drawn
up in front as the Common Hoopoe does.
I have noticed at the Zoo a peculiar habit of the Rhea, which I have
never seen recorded, though I have seen a photo of the bird in the
position to be described lying down on its chest, with the legs stretched
straight out behind it, and the head erect, yet with the eyes closed. The
bird was apparently asleep, though in the ordinary resting position the
legs are tucked underneath it as usual, and the neck laid down on the
back. The head, however, points forward, and I have noticed that none
of the Ratite birds, except the Kiwi, seem to turn their heads round
behind the wing in the manner of birds generally. Neither do the Ratite
birds ever flap their wings so far as I have seen, nor do the Wika Rails
or the Kagu--which is apparently flightless. Do no flightless birds
use the flapping exercise ? The Penguins do, but their Sightlessness
only applies to aerial flight, for as we all know they do fly in the water,
and are very strong winged.
To return to the Rhea, it has a very peculiar action, when dusting,
for it picks up the dust in beakfuls and throws it over itself in that way.
In drinking it pecks up the water in mouthfuls instead of scooping it up,
but I have not noticed if other Ratite birds drink in this way.
Two birds of which I have not seen the courtship recorded are the
Crested Screamer and the Flamingo, but I have seen both display at
the Zoo. The Screamer puffs itself out, raising its wings behind some-
what after the fashion of the Mute Swan, and after pairing the hen
assumes this display pose.
The Flamingo displays by first standing fully erect and stiffly holding
out the wings so as to show the under surface, and then craning its neck
and body downwards and forwards and again extending the wings,
which in this pose display the upper surface ; thus the red and black is
exhibited in all possible ways. I have, however, never seen pairing take

In July, 1925, I joined a small expedition organized by the Natural
History Museum of Salisbury (Rhodesia) for the collecting of
ornithological and other specimens. The start was to be made at the
beginning of July, but this was delayed owing to the visit of the Prince
of Wales to Rhodesia, but on the 19th-of July I started in advance with
all my kit for Umtali, a beautiful town on the borders of Portuguese
East Africa, and two hundred miles north of Mount Selinda. We had
heard that a motor-lorry was leaving that week for Chipinga, a small
hill village twenty-five miles north of Mount Selinda, hence my journey
in advance to arrange the transport of our baggage. My reason for going
was twofold, in the first place, to see the country, and secondly, which
was perhaps my chief reason, to make a study of the rare birds which
inhabit the Mount Selinda region. By boarding the motor-lorry
we should be saved a three weeks 5 trek by ox or donkey-wagon--
travelling by wagon is quite pleasant for a few days, but after that it
becomes very wearisome. There were few birds of interest in Umtali
itself except the White-necked Raven (.Oorvultur albicollis), which
frequents the streets in search of garbage, etc. This bird is glossy black
with a crescent-shaped patch of white on the hind neck. There was also
the White-shouldered Bush Chat (Thamnolcea cinnamomeiventris ), a
beautiful bird resembling both in looks and habits a Rock Thrush. It
is found on the outskirts of the town in the rocky hills.
So on the 23rd of July, before the first flush of dawn had turned
the high peaks of the Xnyamutseri Mountains rosy pink, as it did after-
wards, we had started. The road, or rather track, lay through mountain
passes, through dense tangled jungle, typical African bush veldt, over
high mountain ranges, through wide clear limpid rivers and sometimes

through country strangely reminiscent&amp;apos; of the English countryside.
After two days we arrived at our first camp. Mount Belinda.
The .bird life en route was as varied as it was wonderful, and to
name every bird seen would read like a hand list, so I will only mention
the most noticeable. Hornbills were very much in evidence, both the
Red-billed and the Yellow-billed, we saw not only hundreds but
thousands of these birds, they literally swarmed along some parts
of the track, usually they were in the trees, but often they were to be
seen on the road itself. Then there were the beautiful Purple-crested
Touracous, but these were few and far between, the wonderful Purple-
Rollers (Eurystomus), the huge Trumpeter Hornbills, and flocks of the
Emerald-spotted Doves.
Mount Belinda (formerly known as Ohirinda) is not a very imposing
mountain ; it is composed of two peaks, known as Mount Mamma and
Mount Penga, between four and five thousand feet in height. The Mount
Belinda region is one of the most fertile in the whole of Africa, and is
composed of vast ranges of mountains and hills, range -upon range as
far as the eye can see. In height they range from a thousand feet in
the hot Sabi valley to over eight thousand in the great Chimanimani
Range in Portuguese East Africa. The whole country is very well
watered by rivers and fast-running mountain streams, and this in
common with the damp tropical heat supports a growth of luxuriant
tropical vegetation which is conducive to a wonderfully rich bird life.
The twin peaks of the. mountain are clothed by a dense virgin forest,
the like of which is found nowhere else in Southern Africa. This forest
is composed mainly of mahogany and Brachystegia trees of huge
dimensions, many reaching over two hundred feet in height, but it is
impossible to see the tops of the trees from the inside of the forest;
in some parts the undergrowth is absolutely impenetrable, but most
parts are easy of access owing to the presence of native paths.
I was held spellbound when I first entered the forest, it was perpetual
twilight except where some fitful ray of sunshine penetrated the green
tracery above and lit up a patch of the undergrowth below ; deathly
silence reigned, broken occasionally by the distant cry of the Hornbills
or Touracous far up in the tree-tops or by the crash of some forest giant
falling decayed to the ground, The hot air reeked with the odour of

decaying vegetation and the heavy perfume of the various flowering
creepers which festoon the trees. On every hand these giant trees tower
up until they are lost in the tangle of vegetation above. During several
months spent in this lonely but wonderful part of the country several
hundreds of species of birds were seen, but 1 have only described in these
notes the rarer ones, with a few exceptions.
The Starling family is very poorly represented in the Belinda region,
the only Starling which I have actually seen on the mountain is the
Verreaux's Glossy Starling (Pholidauges verreauxi), but this bird, so
common in other parts of South Africa, is quite rare ; the Purple,
Long-tailed Glossy Starling (.Lamprotornis purpureas) is fairly plentiful
in the surrounding districts, on the well-wooded veldt and in the jungle.
The Yellow-billed Oxpecker (Buphaga africana) or Locust Bird, was,
I understand, once very plentiful in the district until the dipping of
cattle became compulsory, the bird then partook of the arsenic-poisoned
ticks which adhere to the cattle for a considerable time before they fall
off, consequently the birds have passed away for ever not only from that
part but from most parts of South Africa.
The Black-headed Oriole (Oriolus larvatus). This beautiful Oriole
is more often seen than heard, though it is very common. Its presence
can be detected at once by its loud clear ringing notes. It lives in the
thick bush by the mountain streams, where it can obtain an abundant
supply of insect food. It is an interesting bird to watch, for it gives one
the impression that it thoroughly enjoys life--hopping from branch
to branch, shaking out its wings, puffing out its feathers and uttering
its rich, joyous calls. Above it is greenish olive, bright yellow on the
low&amp;apos;er back and the upper tail-coverts, the whole of the head, face, and
throat, extending to a point in the centre of the breast, black ; the under,
parts are bright clear yellow ; the wings black, marked with white
and yellow ; the tail feathers black, tipped with yellow, except the two
central ones, which are olive yellow. The legs, feet, and beak black.

other Weavers even when out of colour by their large size and brighter
colouring. In the breeding season these birds distribute themselves all
over the country, building the usual type of Weaver bird nest on the
end of a thin twig of a large tree.
The Smith's Weaver (Sitagra ocularia). This lovely Weaver,which at
first sight might be mistaken for an Oriole, is found in the wooded
kloofs through which ran the swift mountain streams on the slopes of
Mount Selinda ; it is by no means common, and is found in pairs.
Sometimes it comes into the trees near the few homesteads and utters
its peculiar un-Weaverlike call. I have frequently seen these birds in
the tangled palm clumps by the streams making a minute search of the
vegetation for insects. I believe that this species in common with the
other members of the genus Sitagra is almost, if not entirely,
insectivorous. I have seen the birds pulling to pieces the little bunches
of dead leaves which gather in the branches of the trees in search of
insects, very much after the manner of the Yellow-streaked Bulbul.
It is of a confiding nature, and is consequently easy to observe. In
colour this Weaver is of a general olive green above and golden yellow
below ; the throat is a very deep rich brown merging into golden brown ;
the front of the crown and the cheeks are silky golden brown ; the legs
leaden blue and beak black ; the iris is white, which gives the birds a
hard, cruel expression. The hen is of a general yellowish olive colour,
and lacks the dark markings. The male has a harsh rasping song,
which he is fond of uttering perched on the branch of a bush or tangled
vegetation. The nest is unique, it is of the usual type, but the entrance
tube is usually tremendously elongated ; one in the Pretoria Museum
is said to have the tube 12 feet in length. I have seen some long ones,
but nothing approaching this size.
The Black-backed Weaver (Sycohrotus bicolor). Another beautiful
Weaver, differing from all other Weavers in its habits, being a forest-
loving bird and seldom if ever seen outside the gloomy confines of the
tropical forests. Its demeanour is very un-Weaver like, and seeing it
for the first time in its natural haunts one would little guess that it was
a Weaver. It haunts the dense masses of creeper which festoon the tops
of the giant trees, climbing about with remarkable agility, and searching
for the small insects which constitute its main food ; in fact, it must be

almost, if not entirely, insectivorous, for there are no small seeds in the
forest upon which it can subsist, and it seldom if ever comes to the
ground. The construction of the nest differs but slightly from that of
the other Weaver birds ; it is retort-shaped, with the entrance tube
hanging down. It is hung from the end of a long slender branch, at a
great height from the ground, and is consequently impregnable. I
know of no other bird which places its nest in such an inaccessible
position. I have often seen these birds, at least the males, busy pulling
the fine hair-like roots of the various orchids and other parasitic
plants from the trunks of the forest trees, doubtless with the object
of nest-building. I have also watched the birds nest-building ; the
male seems to do most of the work, while the hen sits near by and
sings. The male weaves for about five minutes, and then flies off, and in
an incredibly short time returns with a beak full of the fine orchid
roots. One would think that the bird would find it difficult to get up
the long narrow entrance tube, but this is not so, it just shoots up as
it flies, without settling ; on reaching the entrance it closes its wings,
and the impetus seems to send it right up into the nest. I have often
seen this, for the walls, owing to the fineness of the material used, are
almost transparent. In colour this bird is a peculiar shade of greyish
blue-black above, which gives it a powdered effect ; the whole under
parts are deep golden orange ; the male and female are similar. Flitting
about in the sombre gloom of the forest, these birds look extra-
ordinarily brilliant, for being in the tops of the trees one only sees
the breast.
South African Ruddy Waxbill (Lagonosticta rubricata). These
charming little birds are to be found in the old Kaffir lands in small
parties of from eight to twelve, where they feed upon the seeds of various
grasses and weeds. When disturbed they seldom if ever rise up into
the air, but fly through the long grass uttering a continual twittering
note ; they are very difficult to observe, for it is only occasionally that
they settle on the top of a grass stem, preferring to remain on the ground
or in the thick vegetation where they breed. In colour the male is rose
grey on the head, cheeks, and nape, the upper parts and wings brown,
the upper tail-coverts crimson, the tail black, edged with the former
colour, below claret colour, the sides being finely spotted with white ;

the centre of the abdomen buff, the under tail-coverts black. The hen
is paler in colour.
The Bed-billed Weaver (Quelea quelea). This well-known bird is
extremely common, and visits the patches of grain with the other
Weavers in huge flocks.
The Red-collared Whydah (Coliuspasser ardens). The birds when out
of colour associate in vast flocks comprising of thousands of individuals,
visiting the wheat patches and doing an immense amount of damage.
I have known a flock to eat almost every grain from a five-acre patch
of wheat in a very short space of time. They are shot by the Dutch in
thousands and eaten ; they are plucked, roasted in fat, and eaten
whole. Many times I have been out to dinner when thousands of
these birds have been dished up on a huge plate, but I could never bring
myself to eat them. The males can always be distinguished when in
undress plumage by their black wings.
The Eastern Yellow Seed-eater (Serinus icterus). These brightly-
coloured little Serins frequent the old Kaffir lands and kraals on the
slopes of Mount Selinda. Their habits do not differ from the rest of the
seed-eaters. They associate in small flocks, picking up their food from
the ground. The male has a very sweet song, which he sings from the
topmost branch of a flat-topped mimosa-tree.
The Golden-breasted Bunting (Emberiza flaviventris). A well-known
bird in most parts of South Africa and, like the seed-eaters, is found
around the cultivated lands searching for seeds on the ground. It is
never to be seen in flocks, but always in pairs. I have frequently seen
them in the beds of dry rivers searching in the sand for food. The male
is a handsome fellow, a mixture of chestnut, black and white above,
the head being striped black and white, and the lower bright golden
yellow tinged with orange in the centre of the breast. These birds are
usually very tame and when disturbed only fly a yard or two out of
one's way.
Yellow-throated Lark (Macronyx croceus). South Africa is rich in
various species of Larks, about forty different kinds being found south
of the Zambesi, but the pick of them all are contained in the genus
Macronyx , the yellow-throated Lark being one of them. Although a
true Lark, this bird seems to live far more in the trees than on the

ground, its extremely long claws seem to be no handicap to it in perching
on the most slender twigs. Its song, which is uttered from the top of a
tall, bare tree, consists of two notes (pe--wit), many times repeated.
In colour it is light brown above, each feather having a darker centre ;
the edge of the wing, the margins of the flight feathers, and the outer
tail feathers yellow. The whole under surface bright canary yellow ;
the throat is divided from the breast by a narrow black collar.
Mount Selinda is rich in the number of Sunbirds which haunt its
amazing flower-covered slopes, no less than ten species being found
there. The exceedingly rare and beautiful species which is indigenous
to the district, the Melsetter Sunbird (Nectarinia arturi), I unfortunately
did not see, to my lasting regret.
The Nyasaland Yellow-bellied Sunbird (Cinnyris venustus nyassae).
These exquisite little birds are comparatively common on the slopes of
the mountain, they frequent the thick tangled bush and jungle on the
outskirts of the forest, where they suck the nectar from the wonderful
flowering shrubs and creepers. They are particularly partial to a large
tree which bears a profusion of scarlet flowers and by sitting for a time
under one of these trees one may observe dozens of these beautiful
little birds ; also on the patches of flowering shrub on the mountain
slopes in the brilliant sunshine of the early morning these fairy-like
little birds can be seen literally in hundreds busily engaged in sucking
the nectar from a certain orange-brown flower, which looks like a large
nettle, and is, I believe, called the Leonotis. The males have a very
sweet but short song ; usually they perch on the topmost twig of a bush
or small tree and sing this short refrain with great gusto, half opening
the wings and fanning the tail from side to side and swaying the body
from side to side ; they seem to put their very life into the short string
of melodious notes. Often they sing hopping from branch to branch,
glistening in the sunshine like living jewels. I have never seen a bird
put so much energy into its song as this tiny mite does. Sometimes after
the song was over the males would " show off " to the females ; puffing
out their feathers, they would spread out the brilliant orange pectoral
plumes (which are normally hidden), like miniature fans on each side
of the breast, and chase the hens from tree to tree. I have frequently
disturbed a pair of these birds which had a nest in a dense thicket

on my approach the birds would flutter round and round uttering
piteous calls. I was never able to find their nest, owing to the denseness
of the vegetation, but no doubt they had young ones. A nest which
I did find was a very small structure, pouch-shaped, with the entrance
at the side, woven of fine grass, with pieces of coarse grass leaves
stuck on outside by the means of cobwebs. The inside was lined with
soft vegetable down and feathers, and the whole was fastened by the
top to a slender twig and placed about 3 feet from the ground in
a thorn bush. In the early spring (September and November), when the
Leonotis flowers have died down, a few of these birds enter the forest
to feed upon the nectar of the flowers of the forest creepers, the rest
seek pastures new until the Leonotis blooms again. These sunbirds
are remarkably tame, and allow one to watch them from a few yards
distant. Mount Selinda is the only place in Africa south of the Zambesi
where they are found. The adult male is rich metallic purple green
above the crown ; the upper tail-coverts are purple ; the tail black,
edged with the same colour ; the throat is metallic blue, going into
brilliant purple on the breast; the under parts are golden yellow ; the
elongated pectoral tufts bright orange. The legs and beak, black. The
hen is greyish about the head, dark olive green on the back, and greenish
yellow below. The young resemble the hen, but are much lighter in
colour, the upper parts being bright olive green and the lower parts
bright greenish yellow.
The Lesser Double-collared Sunbird (Cinnyris chalybeus). This is
another exquisite creature which is fairly common on the mountain.
Its habits are very similar to those of the rest of the family, except that
it frequents the environs of the few scattered homesteads and is seldom
seen far away from them. It feeds mainly upon the nectar of the hibiscus
and the bougainvillaea and upon minute insects. The males are
extremely pugnacious, and frequently engage in furious combats.
I have often seen two males fall to the ground in locked embrace,
almost exhausted by their exertions, and have all but been able to pick
them up with my hands. I have only found one nest belonging to this
species ; it was a very untidy structure, very different to the neatly
made nests of most of the Sunbirds. It was placed at the top of a tall
tree, and composed of fine grass and vegetable down ; the entrance

was at the side, and had a kind of rough porch over it. A description of
this bird is unnecessary, for a good plate appeared in the Magazine
some little time ago of the following species from which the
present differs only in size and the width of the scarlet band across
the chest.
The Greater Double-collared Sunbird (Cinnyris afer). I have seen
this Sunbird but seldom ; it never frequents the environs of the home-
steads like the preceding. It is timid and extremely wild, and lives on
the high wooded veldt. It is at once distinguished from the Lesser
Double-collared Sunbird by its much larger size, and by the fact that
the upper half of the breast is scarlet instead of only having a narrow
band as in the former bird.
The Kirk&amp;apos;s Sunbird (Cinnyris kirJci). This bird reminds one of the
Amethyst Sunbird (Cinnyris amethystinus), being of a general deep
black with a wonderful purple maroon bloom ; the crown is golden
green, the throat and lesser wing-coverts brilliant reddish purple, the
legs and beak black. It is a rare bird and far from common anywhere.
It is found on the scrub-covered slopes of the surrounding hills and
mountains, and occasionally on the less densely covered slopes of
Mount Selinda. This Sunbird is extremely wild, and it is impossible to
get within several hundred feet of it ; this is perhaps on account of its
colouring, which makes it the most conspicuous of all the Sunbirds.
At a distance it looks much larger than it really is. It is only in certain
lights that the plumage assumes the remarkable plum-bloom shade
mentioned.
The Olive-coloured Sunbird (Cinnyris olivaceus). These drably
coloured birds, which might easily be mistaken for the females of some
brightly coloured species, are frequently seen in the thick bush.
They are not common, and are usually seen singly though sometimes
in the company of other sunbirds. On clear hot mornings when the
whole countryside is bathed in brilliant sunshine, a great many Sunbirds
are to be seen on the jungle-covered slopes of the mountains ; some-
times there are hundreds of them, and amongst the bejewelled throng
there are usually to be seen several of these sombre coloured birds.
They appear to be almost twice the size of the other Sunbirds ; these,
in company with the others, delight in sucking the nectar from the

Leonotis. If one encroaches on their breeding grounds a great com-
motion commences ; the birds flutter round within a few yards of .one,
chattering and scolding to the uttermost of their powers. During the
breeding season one seldom sees more than an odd bird in the forest,
and then never more than a few hundred yards from the edge ; there
they search the bases of the large Dracaena leaves for insects, hovering
meanwhile in the air after the manner of a humming-bird ; they do
not do this for any prolonged period, only for a few seconds. After the
breeding season is over these birds desert the open mountain slopes,
and take to the seclusion of the gloomy forest, where they go about in
small parties searching the low vegetation for insects. I have frequently
seen these birds making great efforts to unroll leaves which contained
insects, sometimes a bird would hang on to a leaf in the air and exert
its full strength until the leaf broke. The Olive-coloured Sunbird has a
very sustained song for a Sunbird, and quite a sweet one, too ; it lasts
for several minutes at a time. In the sombre gloom of the forest all
birds seemed to assume a dark olive colouring, and I have frequently
mistaken these birds for some of another species. The colour of this
Sunbird is generally olive green, greyer on the breast; the rather long
pectoral plumes are bright golden yellow, but these are never seen unless
the bird displays. The length is about 5J in. ; the legs and beak
are black.
The Collared Sunbird (Anthothreptes collaris). A gem of the first
water. Glittering metallic golden green above, also on the throat and
chest, which is divided from the breast by a narrow collar of metallic
purple ; the wings are olive, the lesser wing-covert and tail black,
edged with metallic green ; the under parts bright yellow ; the legs
and bill black. This is one of the few Sunbirds in which the female
resembles the male ; she differs only in having the whole under surface
yellow. This, to my mind, is the most exquisite of the Sunbirds, the
tiniest of them all, yet so perfect in colouring. It is quite common on
the slopes of the mountain, and like the other Sunbirds, is seldom found
far from the Leonotis flowers while they last, flitting from flower to
flower, its resplendent emerald plumage flashing and glittering in the
sunlight. There is only one other African bird which rivals it in metallic
beauty--the Emerald Cuckoo. A dried skin can give but little idea of the

beauty of the living bird. As well as frequenting the flowers for nectar,
these birds may be seen making a minute search of the thorn-trees for
small insects, especially spiders. In most of their habits these birds
resemble the Nyasaland Sunbirds, except that when the honey-
bearing flowers are over at the end of September, they abandon the
open slopes of the mountain, and penetrate far into the forest, the
attraction being, it seems, the white star-like flowers of a giant forest
tree, and during the succeeding months they can be seen in
hundreds in the perpetual gloom. The beauty of their metallic plumage
is marvellous when by chance they alight in the pathway of a slanting
ray of sunshine which penetrates the green twilight. Once when
wandering about in a densely-wooded kloof I came across a Sunbird
of a species that I had never seen before ; it was a beautiful creature,
and as far as my notes show was as follows : the head velvety black
with an amethyst gloss ; a broad collar of smoky brown on the hind
neck ; the mantle and scapulars metallic amethyst; the wings brown,
the tail black, the whole under surface pure white ; the female grey.
I only saw one pair of these birds ; they were busily engaged in searching
for insects on the bushes. They were shy, but I was able to observe them
for a long time with the aid of binoculars.
Later I came across them again in Portuguese East Africa, and was
able to study them at close quarters ; their habits seem to differ but
slightly from those of the rest of the family. They seem to be
very rare.

Perhaps it would be as well to record in a short note some particulars
of this most charming bird. It was recently mentioned in the editorial
notes as a species new to aviculture, five specimens having arrived
in June from South Africa with Messrs. Gamage's collection.

274 Captain H. S. Stokes--The White-fronted Bee-eater
The back, wings, and the tail (which is square) are bright green,
rump cobalt blue, breast and back of head brown. Forehead and
throat pearly white, below which is a broad band of scarlet. Beak fully
an inch long, black with a black streak from the base of it to behind
the eye. Legs short and feet very small.
The birds were in the most exquisite condition and feeding eagerly
on locust meal and hard-boiled egg. So in my enthusiastic ignorance
(and not from superior conceit) I braved the gloomy forebodings and
fearful prophecies of the pessimists--" awful birds to keep ; they must
be propped up on their perches, fed all day by hand, washed, kept very
warm, and must speedily die of indigestion and misery "--and brought
a pair home.
In ten days they were promoted from a cage to a good-sized flight
cage with outdoor attachment, and speedily learnt to catch mealworms
and black beetles. (No, I do not approve of black beetles in the
kitchen, but there they are, and I thank a kindly providence which
supplies them as a digestive for Bee-eaters and other glories.)
After this came hot weather, and the President and the Editor and
the Secretary to see the birds, and with some trepidation we turned
them for the occasion into my small Finch aviary, only to find them
the most charming, sensible, and tractable birds we ever had.
Every night, and whenever it rains, they go indoors of their own
accord. All day when the sun shines they hawk and hover and swoop
for flies, and delight us with their skill and beauty and ease. It is
impossible to throw a mealworm in any direction which they do not
catch.
Probably the secret of it all is that never have Bee-eaters been
brought over so exquisitely before or been so carefully meated off
in the early stages of captivity.
Anyhow, they are a joy and a blessing, and I was surprised that
the other three remained three weeks in the shop without a buyer.
But perhaps it was also a blessing for them that they did, for after
Mr. Ezra's visit to me they quickly found a home in his beautiful
aviaries, where no doubt many members had the opportunity of seeing
them at the party he so kindly gave to us all.

Last summer I was fortunate in obtaining a very beautiful lutino
specimen of the Blue-fronted Amazon, the first lutino bird of the Parrot
family I have seen, which showed the albino features of red eyes and
pale beak and feet. As already described in a previous letter, it is
golden yellow where the normal form is green and pure white where
the normal form is blue, while the red areas of the ordinary plumage
are retained. The effect of primary feathers half snowy white, half
velvety crimson, against a body plumage of the richest gold is wonder-
fully striking and beautiful. Naturally I made plans for trying to
breed from so remarkable a bird and as most captive Amazons and
nearly all lutinos are hens, I decided to obtain a cock, which I did through
the kindness of our Secretary. In time the Amazons became quite
friendly, but I was by no means certain that they were a true pair.
The lutino was by far the more lively of the two and rather overpowered
and bored the green bird by its demonstrations of affection and playful
attacks. In the spring, the cock, which had never been very strong,
began to show signs of illness, so I removed him from the outdoor
aviary and decided to offer the lutino the choice of a robust partner
of either sex. I again appealed to our Secretary for assistance, and
by her help obtained two fine Amazons which, by the pelvic bone test,
she felt sure were male and female. We first introduced the female
to the lutino, who tolerated her for a little and then began to bully
her. We then tried the male but the reception he got was, if possible,
even worse than that accorded to the lady. Either the lutino was still
faithful to its invalid companion or else it had come to the conclusion
that it was far too good to be bestowed in marriage upon a common
Green Parrot! The unfortunate new arrivals had a very thin time
indeed. If the male left the wire netting and tried to climb on to a
perch the lutino erected all its feathers and bore down upon him,
uttering peal after peal of sarcastic laughter until it reached him and
hurled him to the ground ; then, with an even louder guffaw, it settled
down to watch for the next move. If the hen Amazon ventured on
to a perch, the lutino struck up a species of chant, delivered in the

manner, half purposeful and half abstracted, of people who like to
hum a tune as they go about some occupation they know to be dis-
pleasing to their neighbours. " Tum-ti, tum-ti, tum-ti, tum-ti,
tum-ti, tum-ti, tum-ti, turn ! " it sang as it strode after the object of
its animosity. We were rather nonplussed and the lutino's sex remained
shrouded in considerable obscurity as, although it was always " Tum-ti,
tum-ti " for the hen and " Ha-ha " for the cock, the precise significance
of the difference between the two modes of address was not easy to
discern. None of the avicultural literature dealing with the sexing
of birds gave me any help at all. As, however, the shape of the lutino's
head bore more resemblance to that of the cock Amazon than the
hen and the attacks delivered on the latter were a shade less vicious,
I decided to remove the cock. He was accordingly placed in an aviary
by himself where he seems very happy and amuses us with his con-
versational and musical accomplishments. Among the latter is a most
remarkable song delivered in a voice I hesitate to identify with his
late owner's, though, as I believe she told me she had the bird when
quite young, I do not know of what other lady's voice it can be an
imitation !
For several days it was necessary to shut the lutino up for a few
hours in order to give the hen Amazon a chance of feeding in peace
and resting undisturbed by the tune of " Tum-ti, tum-ti ", but gradually
they became more reconciled and at the time of writing, if not exactly
on affectionate terms, are quite friendly and unafraid of each other.
But probably I shall have to wait until next spring before I can be
certain that the two are a true pair.
Besides the Blue-fronted Amazons I had a hen Guilding's and an
Inornata. The Inornata I bought about a year ago as a mate for the
Guilding, for I never expected to be able to secure a second example
of that rare and magnificent Parrot. The old hen Guilding has been
in my possession about fourteen years and was a good time in England
before she was offered to me, so she must be a fair age, as, like most of
her race, she was adult when first captured, probably by shooting.
She was devoted to her first owner, but has never really taken to anyone
else, her natural shyness being accentuated by the fact that she is
short-sighted, although there is no visible defect in her eyes. My

Marquess of Tavistock--Some Notes on Amazon Parrots 277
old friend, Canon Dutton, well-known as an authority on Parrots,
used to consider that the great island Amazons were not so hardy
as the better known South American species and had little or no
aptitude for learning to talk. My own experience has not altogether
confirmed his opinions, as my hen Guilding has spent several winters
in an outdoor aviary, at one time in a very exposed one, and she has
never shown the least sign of illness : I do not think, however,
that the big island Parrots are altogether suited to cage life, as,
when deprived of exercise, their term of life does not often exceed a
few years.
It is true that I have never known but one big Amazon that talked,
but this may be due to the fact that the few that have been brought
into captivity have nearly always been fully adult when taken. Reared
from the nest, they might learn to talk as well as their smaller
relations.
Resigned as I had become to the idea that my hen Guilding was
probably the first and last of her race that I should ever own, it came
as an agreeable surprise this spring when Mr. Seth-Smith told me of
another for sale in good condition, but with its appearance rather
spoiled by a badly damaged eye. I was still more pleased to hear
from Miss Knobel that the bird was almost certainly a young male.
I disposed of the Inornata and a few days later the new Guilding arrived.
He was a great contrast to others of his own and closely allied species
that I have known. Instead of being slow and stately in his movements
and a rigid abstainer from any form of conversation but his natural
calls, he was excessively lively and friendly and a great chatterbox,
saying a fair number of words that could be understood and still more
that were unintelligible. As he was in fair plumage and in excellent
health I soon turned him into the aviary with the hen. The change
he highly approved of and life became one huge joke. He raced about
the perches at full speed shouting " Abra, abra, abracadabra, abra-
cadabra, what d'yer want ? Ha, ha, ha, ha, haaaa ! ! " and his first
rain bath sent him wild with delight. His relations with his intended
bride, however, were not idyllic. She was afraid of him and when
he unintentionally cornered her in a place from which she could not
escape, she bit and swore as though her life depended on it. He,

handicapped by his blind eye, grew angry and frightened in his turn
and the result was a most thorough misunderstanding. Bed-time,
when they had to be driven into the shelter for the night, usually
produced a scene between the two shy and short-sighted individuals.
Their conduct reminded one extraordinarily of the peoples of two
nations who, with no desire whatever to injure one another by aggression,
through complete ignorance of each other's feelings, nevertheless
embark on a bitter " defensive war ", both parties believing with
equal sincerity that life and honour are at stake. The two Parrots,
however, were more fortunate than belligerent nations in that they
were not denied an opportunity of studying each other during quieter
moments. Very soon it began to dawn upon them that they were not.
out for each other's blood. The cock began to make playful attacks
on the hen, and pulled her leg gently, both literally and metaphorically.
She in turn learned that he did not mean to hurt her and so by the
time I returned from my holiday they had become very good friends
and were preening each other's feathers. The cock has not lost his
good temper now that he has a mate of his own species and still displays
to a human friend by spreading his tail and bobbing his head with the
crown depressed, while the pupil of his eye contracts. I fear that
I can scarcely expect them to breed, for even if the hen were not too
old to lay, would she and her partner ever manage to rear a brood
with only one sound eye between them ? Perhaps a pair of spectacles
might help !
I may add in conclusion that the cock Amazon is already quite
famous through the Press. His arrival was mentioned in more than
one daily paper and indirectly he was the cause of a rather unkind
reference in Punch to Mr. Cook of mining fame, who was advised to
take warning from the fate of a race of Parrots nearly exterminated
by their fondness for sitting on volcanoes ! Guilding's Amazon was,
of course, nearly wiped out by an eruption in the only island it
inhabits.

By The Marquess op Tavistock
The Yellow-rumped Parrakeet is the scarcest in captivity of all the
true Platycerci , and its natural habitat appears to be restricted. To
those who have never seen one it is best described as a small Pennant
with the red of the Pennant's plumage replaced everywhere, except
on the forehead, by pale greyish yellow. In the bird books it is often
depicted as a beautiful primrose colour, but the Yellow-rump of real
life is not, either in England or Australia, a gaudy bird and might
appeal to those to whose taste a Bosella is too brilliant. Both my
hens have quite a lot of reddish colour on the breast and might almost
be mistaken for very pale Adelaides : indeed it is a very open question
whether Yellow-rumps and Adelaides are not local races of the same
species ; or the Adelaide may be a natural hybrid between Pennant
and Yellow-rump, now well established and breeding true. My first
Yellow-rump was a hen with two toes of one foot missing. She came
to me at a time when I was trying to keep most of my Parrakeets
at liberty and I turned her with a cut wing into an open-topped
enclosure. When her feathers grew she stayed about all right, but
before the winter was far advanced she was badly injured in a fight
with some other Parrakeet and had to be destroyed. My next Yellow-
rump, a cock, reached me a year or two later and I started him in the
same way. He was an assertive bird : there were some Pennants in
the garden at the time the moult restored him the use of his wings
and one of the cocks had a pretty whistle the Yellow-rump soon learned
to imitate perfectly. Not content with this plagiarism, he proceeded
to appropriate the Pennant's wife and some months later I was only
just in time to prevent him murdering that luckless bird with the
able assistance of the lady. Not long afterwards the hen Pennant
took possession of a hole in an old beech-tree and was no more seen,
and it looked as though I should be able to prove whether my theory
as to the hybrid origin of Adelaides was correct. Alas ! it was not
to be: some weeks later the Yellow-rump vanished and inspection
of the hole in the beech-tree showed it to be empty. Clearly some

vermin had killed the Pennant on her nest, and her mate had strayed
before I realized the need of replacing her.
I did not see another Yellow-rump for very many years, but last
winter I was fortunate enough to secure five, three cocks and two hens.
They were rough and very wild, but quite healthy and indeed have
never given me a day's anxiety. The Yellow-rump is a hardy bird,
and is in no respect more difficult to manage than the common Rosella,
being very unlike the Tasmanian Yellow-belly (P. flaviventris), which
is decidedly tricky.
Like most newly imported Australian Parrakeets the Yellow-
rumps started to moult soon after their arrival. Being anxious to give
them a chance of breeding, and knowing that you can take a certain
amount of liberty in the matter of low temperatures with newly
imported birds of the genus Platycercus, provided their plumage is in
good order from bathing and you do not expose them to fog and cold
wind, in April I moved the Yellow-rumps from the warm bird-room
to the aviaries they were to occupy as their permanent homes. The
aviary shelters were heated with a couple of brooder lamps and at first
the birds were only allowed out into the flights in the warmest part
of the warmest days. The single cock, which was the best one, I left
alone, keeping the pairs together that had travelled together. In
this I made a mistake, and had I given him a hen I should probably
have had two nests instead of one.
The hen Yellow-rumps of the pairs were in better condition than
their mates and as summer approached began to show signs of nesting.
One pair were much steadier than the other, but it was the cock of the
timid couple who first began to feed his hen, and it was she who in
June laid four eggs in the nest-box in the aviary shelter. One young
bird was hatched and left the nest towards the end of July. It is pale
yellowish green on the neck and breast and rather darker green on the
shoulders and wings. The blue areas of the plumage are much as in
the adult, but perhaps slightly smaller and the red forehead is well
developed. The beak is the usual pale horn colour of young birds of
the genus. As compared with an Adelaide of the same age the Yellow-
rump is much yellower on the breast and rather more blue on
the wing.

Captain H. S. Stokes--Breeding the Yellow Wagtail 281
The young bird is doing well at the time of writing and flies strongly
and can find its way in and out of the shelter : the parents are moulting
again, as are the other pair which did not nest, partly, I think, because
they were interfered with by a Brown's Parrakeet at liberty who fed
the hen Yellow-rump through the wire. The cock also fed her, but had
not sufficient energy to resent and drive off his rival. I believe the
Yellow-rumped Parrakeet has been bred on the Continent many years
ago, but I am not aware that it has been bred in England.

By Captain H. S. Stokes
As a rule I do not keep British birds in my aviaries, preferring to see
them in garden, field, and wood, but as this delightful species does not
occur locally I sent for a pair, and they arrived just after the general
strike.
The cock Yellow Wagtail is a deep greenish yellow and longer in
the leg than the Grey Wagtail, which is also yellow, but paler, and is
particularly smart and attractive, especially when paddling in the
water.
The aviary chosen for them was one just being made, of which
only the shed and a small portion of the flight were ready. Into this
they were turned, and we busied ourselves with other things.
On looking round a fortnight later we were astonished to find a
beautiful nest built on a truss of straw indoors and up against the
wall, made entirely of coarse pieces of peat moss litter off the floor and
lined with feathers. To this was added some soft hair which I threw in.
Three eggs were laid, but the hen never seemed to sit on them.
Finally, in June, when the annual family migration to the seaside
took place--always a period of intense activity in aviary building !--
the Editor came to see the birds and he agreed that the nest would
probably be forsaken and a new one built. For by this time the outdoor
flight, 60 feet long by 10 feet wide, against a creeper-covered wall,
was completed, with ample nesting cover.

Aviculture in Germany
On 12th July I went in to tidy up and to pull out the old nest and
was thrilled to find a sturdy young bird gaping up at me for food from
the nest. Up till this time, when the young one must have been well
over a week old, no live food had been supplied except an occasional
treat of mealworms, so the parents must have fed it entirely on insects
captured on the wing.
This was particularly encouraging, as there are numerous other
insectivorous birds sharing the aviary--Bulbuls, White-capped
Redstarts, Orange-headed Thrushes, and Pagoda Starlings.
Thereafter mealworms, gentiles, and freshwater shrimps were
supplied in moderate quantities, but still flies seemed to be preferred.
On 17th July the young one left the nest, and a week later was
fending for himself.
The species has already been bred by Mr. Teschemaker, as recorded
in this Magazine for 1914, page 81, but these scanty notes may serve
to remind members of a charming bird to acquire when offered.

Red-billed Hornbills (Lophoceros erythrorhynchus) have this year
nested at the Berlin Zoo. Recent numbers of Die Gejiederte Welt give
accounts of the event.
The hen was walled up in the cavity selected for the nest, and
fed by the cock through an opening left for the purpose, exactly as
is the case in the wild ; two broods appear to have been hatched,
and one young bird lived twenty-one days, a really notable avicultural
event despite the absence of complete success. The articles are
illustrated with good photos of the male feeding himself, and later his
immured mate, as well as of the young produced in two stages of
unfeatheredness.
Other illustrations in the numbers of the last few months which
particularly appealed to me are a series of photographs of young

The first of these is apropos of Mr. Ezra's new acquisition mentioned
in the June number of the Avicultural Magazine as new to aviculture,
but according to Die Gefiederte Welt this species was brought to the
Berlin Zoo in 1924. Of the second, the White-headed Spreo, three

Advertisements of " Bengalese " at 12 marks a pair are of interest
in connexion with our recent article on Japanese Aviculture and the

I can find no mention of Yol. I of Aviculture in any of the numbers
I have seen, an omission which must be due to want of knowledge of
the work, I think, as the Die Gefiederte Welt is usually so well-informed
and so all-inclusive in matters avicultural.

BLACK-CHEEKED AND NYASA LOVEBIRDS

<bodyText confidence="0.999258176470588" page_id="56220539"  page_num="283" year="" vol="">
Sir, --It might interest members to know that I have a Black-
cheeked hen Lovebird mated to a cock Nyasa sitting on fertile eggs.
This really happened by accident.
I had put a couple of either species in adjoining flight cages, and
presumed, as they did not make any effort to nest, they were not true
pairs. They eventually gnawed their way through, and I then gave
the four birds the use of the double flight. A cock Nyasa speedily
mated to a hen Black-cheek and within a week she was sitting on eggs
and is due to hatch off on or about the 25th inst.
Provided the hybrids are reared it will be interesting to note if
they correspond with the specimens Messrs. Chapman imported and
which were concluded to be wild-bred hybrids of these two species.
My experiences in breeding Nyasa Lovebirds might interest and be
of assistance to other members. I procured several of these birds from
the first importation, and was fortunate enough to get at least three
true pairs. One pair quickly took possession of a nest-box, laid five
eggs, and steadily incubated the eggs. On examination I found all

five eggs containing dead chicks, and presuming the period of inbuca-
tion to be twenty-one days, they had all died on the 20th or 21st day.
With this particular pair this happened with three nests containing
nineteen eggs in all (as soon as one lot of eggs were removed they laid
right away).
After a little thought and suggestion from Captain Rattigan,
I came to the conclusion that lack of sufficient humidity in the air and
low temperature whilst incubating was the cause, and having another
pair that had been sitting on five eggs for eighteen days (counting
from date first egg was laid) I decided to provide the necessary moisture
and every morning soaked their eggs in warm water and lightly sprayed
the interior of the nest-box. I was later rewarded with four strong
youngsters, which on day of writing are practically fully feathered
and ready for flight.
During this operation the Nyasas sat within 2 or 3 feet of their
nest and the hen straightway went back to incubate and evidently
in no way objected to this interference.
From my observation the parents of this species feed their young
on the following : chickweed, seeding grass, oats or groates, and white
Spanish seed, first masticated by the parents and given to the young
in a thin liquid form. They are fed by both parents frequently and
the interior of the nest kept very clean.
The eggs are evidently laid on alternate days as the last young one
hatched out ten days after the first but received just as much care and
attention as the bigger and stronger occupants of the nest.
As we have had a good importation of a new species which is in
every way hardy, attractive in colour, and a very free breeder, we
should snatch the opportunity to perpetuate it in our aviaries. An
exchange of blood with aviary-bred specimens should be easily arranged,
and the possibilities of breeding this tractable species unlimited.

don't think he was a young bird when she got him. He is extremely
lively and full of character and habits. He always takes his bath about
tea time, and since (many years ago) his particular glass bath (which
was a smallish flower vase like a small fish bowl) got broken, he will
take it out of nothing but his drinking-pot in which he can only get
his head. When not quite up to the mark I give him a drop or two
of whiskey in his water, which bucks him up wonderfully. He is now
moulting but still most cheerful, with a voice as strong as ever.
He does not keep himself quite so sleek as he used to do and his feet
give his age away, as they are extraordinarily gnarled and hard. He
strongly objects to having his toe-nails cut, bites my finger all the time,
and shrieks at the top of his voice, and when done he absolutely chuckles
at me, as if to say, " I hurt you jolly more than you did me," which is
quite true as he leaves a mark which lasts nearly an hour. He knows
people--old friends he always has a pleasant word for. I hope I am
not worrying you by this long letter about my bird. My birds have
always lived long : a Greenfinch 19J years and a Canary 12 J.

<bodyText confidence="0.994442571428571" page_id="56220541"  page_num="285" year="" vol="">
Sir, -- I have read with much interest the article on, and seen with
much pleasure the fine coloured plate of, the Derbyan Parrakeet in
the June number of our Magazine. This is the favourite Parrot of
the Chinese, and he is generally kept by rich people who hang up one
or two of them in their halls or gardens. The poor birds are kept
as almost all Parrots in Chinese hands, on swings made entirely of
metal, perch and all, and are generally fed on dry paddy.
Keeping such a lively-bird chained up and feeding him on such
a monotonous diet, certainly does not increase the happiness of the
Parrot, but still I have known examples living for many years and
looking in very good condition. The Chinese consider this Parrakeet
a good talker, but all the birds I have come across only spoke a few
words in Chinese. These command high prices, as the Chinaman is
yery fond of talking or whistling birds. I am rather surprised that

the Derbyan Parrakeet is such a rara avis in Europe. A few examples
are always to be found on our bird market and sometimes, generally
during the early autumn, this species arrives in quantity and I have
seen as many as twenty in a birdshop, all tied to a bamboo frame
and looking not exactly happy. Pere David states that this Parrakeet
comes from Nepal and Arracan, passing during the summer to the
wooded valleys of the upper Yantze, via the province of Szechuan,
where the Chinese capture him and bring him in quantities to Chentu,
the capital of this province. He does not mention Hainan as its
habitat, but credits this island as the fatherland of Palaeornis lathami,
a species somewhat similar in colour to the Derbyan, but much smaller.
If one asks the Shanghai dealers where they get their birds from,
they invariably reply " from Szechuan " ; in this instance they seem
to be correct, but generally they name this province as the abode of
any rare or gaily coloured bird. One even assured me that his

A HERMAPHRODITE GOULDIAN PINCH
Sir, --About eighteen months ago I secured a freak Gouldian
Finch, one half is the colouring of a cock and one side that of a hen.
One side of the head is red, the other black. When it turns one side,
you are looking at a red-headed cock bird, and the other side a black-
headed hen. The colouring is perfect. It has moulted, but still
remains the same. This year I put a Red-headed cock with it and to
my surprise I found they nested and had eggs but they were infertile,
so it must be a hen. It would be interesting to know if a case like
this has been known before.

<bodyText confidence="0.990314424242424" page_id="56220543"  page_num="287" year="" vol="">
Sir,-- Towards the end of August, by a happy accident, I met
Mr. A. le Soeuf, of Sydney, in the Bird-room at the South Kensington
Natural History Museum, and from a few minutes' somewhat hurried
conversation I understood that for some time past he had had quite
a considerable number of Hooded and some Golden-shouldered
Parrakeets under observation in aviaries ; that the coloured shoulder-
patch differed in the two birds ; that though both raise their head-
feathers, each does it in quite a different manner ; and, that he has
come to regard them as different species rather than local varieties.
Unfortunately our hurried chance meeting did not permit of his
dilating on these and possibly other points concerning them.
I would suggest that Mr. le Souef be asked to write an account of
whatever differences and similarities he has noticed, as the information
would be of great interest.
Concerning the editorial note that colour varies with age : that,
of course, must be recognized, and may account for some of
the differences, but if the orange lower abdomen and under tail-coverts
be the juvenile type (and we know it is, from the specimens recently
at Mr. Chapman's and also from the partly moulted immature skins
sent by Capt. Wilkins to the Natural History Museum recently), then
the brown-headed bird Miss Clare had would seem to have been a young
one, and the brown hood not therefore a sign of old age.
Evelyn Sprawson.
[That the Hooded (P. dissimilis) and Golden-shouldered Parrakeets
(P. chrysopterygius) are distinct species there can be little doubt,
especially since the differences were pointed out by Messrs, le Souef
and Kinghorn in the Emu of July, 1924. But Captain Sprawson,
in our last number, suggested that there might be more than one race
or sub-species of P. dissimilis, the Hooded Parrakeets, which was
first described as having (in the male) a brown hood or cap, whereas
in subsequent examples this has been black. Captain Sprawson's
statement that he saw a male with a brown hood has raised the question
as to whether there may not be two races. --Ed.]

YOUNG PARROT FINCHES
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999303171428572" page_id="56220544"  page_num="288" year="" vol="">
Sir, --In spite of the fact that I have four cock Parrot Finches
to one hen and that there are over fifty other birds in the same
division of the aviary (flight 30 by 14 feet) three young Parrot
Finches left the nest on 17th August. The most forward of the
young birds has to-day, the 20th, a band of bright red feathers
on the lower part of the brown patch which the young show on
that part of the breast, which will eventually be red. I have notes
in my journal saying that I bought Parrot Finches off Chapman on
13th June, 1925, and last February, and that some of them had no
red on the breast, yet they must have been older than these, two
of which could hardly fly on the 17th.
I have seen statements, somewhat loose, that the young on leaving
the nest are coloured like their parents, but that is generally contra-
dicted by others. I notice that their tails show red and that there
are some blue beads at the base of the beak, something like those
found in young Gouldian Finches only not so large. I also noticed
three blue beads at the base of the beak of some young Black-faced
Quail Finches which unfortunately died in the nest.
H. L. Sich.
[In the Avicultural Magazine for December, 1905, the present
Editor published some notes on his experience in breeding Parrot
Finches, of which he reared a number, and the following paragraph
may be quoted apropos of the observation made by Mr. Sich.
" The young birds have the sides of the mouth ornamented with
four brilliant blue beads which appear to be semi-luminous, at any
rate they are visible in the darkness of the nest when all else seems
blackness, and there seems little doubt that they enable the parents
to see where to place the food, for when the old bird stands in the small
entrance-hole the young birds are practically in darkness. When they
leave the nest the young birds are a dull green with tail dull reddish,
and a certain amount of red on the face. The extent of this latter,
however, varies very considerably, some having practically none while
in others the face is nearly as red as in a poor adult specimen. The
young birds have the lower mandible of the bill bright yellow, while
the whole bill is black in the adult." --Ed.]

A BLUE ALEXANDRINE PARRAKEET
By Alfred Ezra, O.B.E.
Nowadays one sees beautiful varieties of yellow, blue and other
coloured Budgerigars. Originally these freaks were due to accidental
variations, but they have been established by several breeders.
Similar freaks also occur in birds in their wild state, particularly in
those of the genus Palceornis of India. For many years I have had in
cages different specimens of lutinos of the Blossom-head (P. cyano-
cephala), the Ring-neck (P. torquata ), and the Alexandrine Parrakeets
{P. nepalensis). Although these birds are very rare, the blue specimen,
which is their counterpart, but in which the yellow tinge has entirely
disappeared, is rarer still. Up to the present I do not know of any
blue varieties with the exception of two specimens, the one illustrated so
.accurately in the accompanying plate, and a male Ring-neck (P. torquata)
of similar colour belonging to Mr. M. G. Mullick, of Calcutta. I need
not elaborate on the beauty of my bird, of which Mr. Gronvold gives
such a true and accurate portrait. It is a male and belonged to my
brother, Mr. David Ezra, of Calcutta, and as far as I know he was taken
from a nest in the wild state. He was with my brother for about a year
and then I brought him here over two years ago. For the first six
months I kept him in a cage, but since then he has been in an outdoor
aviary measuring 20 ft. by 6 ft. For companion he has a female lutino
of the same species. They have flourished out of doors during the

last two winters, which have been most severe. They are very attached
to one another, and the hen laid twice last season, once at about
Christmas time and again in February. Unfortunately the eggs were
clear in both cases. It is interesting to note that, while the two known
blue Palceornis are males, the lutinos are almost always females.
Several lutino Bing-neck hens, mated to normal coloured green
cocks, have bred in aviaries, but all the offspring so far have been green.
Should the offspring breed, let us trust some of the young will be
yellow. I hope next season to mate my blue bird to a normal green
hen, and the lutino hen to a green cock.

I gave last year an account of the breeding of the Black-headed
Sibia, and hope that the following details of a further partial success-
in breeding these birds may be of interest.
The early part of this year was, in London at any rate, cold and wet.
The four Sibias, two adult and last year's two young ones, had been
kept in the largest breeding aviary but apparently the birds were not
inclined to breed together. Unfortunately, I had omitted to ring the
young birds, and found that I could not distinguish which were which.
After many different sortings I left what I thought to be the parent
birds in the aviary with a pair of Superb Spreos.
The Starlings went to nest at once, and soon after the Sibias were
seen to be carrying hay into the nest-box. Whether they were copying
the Starlings it is impossible to say, but it was surely a strange place
for birds of this class to nest.
The attempt, if such it was, however, was soon nullified as the
Starlings denuded the nest-box of everything the Sibias had put into it,
and from that time until I moved the Starlings the Sibias made no
further attempts to build a nest.
About a fortnight after the Starlings had been moved (about the
26th May), the Sibias started to build about 5 ft. above the ground in
a small tree and in a most exposed position. Two eggs were laid and in
spite of the bad weather, there was some heavy rain, the birds sat

very closely. Exactly fifteen days after incubation commenced tbe
young (one only) was batched.
From the experience gained last year I felt pretty certain that unless
the young bird died the Sibias would not leave the nest for any length
of time, so on the morning that the young one was hatched, a hole
about 18 inches square was cut in the wire netting just near the nest,
and a perch put up for the birds to alight on. Within two minutes the
cock bird was out in the garden. Soon after that the gardener next door
rushed up to tell me one of my birds had escaped. Shortly after the cock
was busy chasing the two young Sibias in the adjacent aviary.
The first day was rather an anxious one, particularly as I had to
leave home for the day, and on my return the cock was nowhere to be
seen. The gardener, however, was very reassuring, and told me that
the birds had been busy feeding and had even refused mealworms,
so that apparently they were finding plenty of suitable food.
For the first week mealworms were entirely disregarded ; but
subsequently the hen, possibly a little too lazy to go far, would con-
descend to take a few from the path outside the aviary. Both birds
were impudent even to the extent of entering the greenhouse
for spiders and at times came down and partook of cake at tea-time.
The question now arose what was to be done when the young bird
left the nest. I did not want to shut the parent birds up in the aviary
again, and hoped that when the young one had left the nest it would *
stay in the aviary, but this hope was doomed to disappointment, for
on the morning of the 17th day after hatching the young bird had been
enticed out of the aviary by the parents.
I had to decide whether to risk losing the lot or to shut them up,
and I decided on the latter. The young bird was easily caught and put
back in the aviary, where the parents immediately followed and the
hole was wired up again.
Now comes the strange part of this story. In spite of the fact that
plenty of mealworms were given, the parent birds refused to feed the
young one, and we found it dead the next morning. It was a sad ending
to what promised to be an interesting experiment.
I have often wondered what would have happened had I left the
birds out. I believe that the two parent birds, at any rate, would have

returned to the aviary, but fear that when the young bird was in
a position to feed for himself, they would have driven him away.
I propose to try again, however, next year, and leave them out.
It may be of interest to mention that the garden is within 4 miles
of Charing Cross and the Finchley Road along which buses, etc., are
continually running is only about 300 yards away.
Many years ago a number of these birds were loosed in Kent in the
hope that they might become part of the population, but apparently
they were newly imported birds and nothing resulted ; but there appears
to be no reason why they should not be acclimatized, as I have found
them very hardy.
I never found out how far the birds went away from the aviary, but
that they enjoyed their freedom is unquestionable.
Has this experiment ever been tried with insectivorous birds before ?
I know the Marquess of Tavistock does quite a lot on these lines with
Parrots and Waxbills, but have never seen any account of an
insectivorous bird being allowed its freedom. It will be readily realized
that if this can be done successfully the food problem of the young chicks
is reduced to a minimum.
As an example of the difficulty of rearing insectivorous birds, my
Blue Robins have nested twice, three chicks the first time and four the
second time, but never succeeded in rearing any, which is very dis-
appointing. In each case the young birds left the nest and died soon
after from what appeared to be rickets. This in spite of the fact that
mealworms were augmented with hundreds of spiders. Has anybody
had this experience with Blue Robins, and if so have they been able to
overcome it ?

but is not often seen, owing to its habit of frequenting the dense bush
and jungle: its plumage resembles that of the Mozambique Shrike

(D. mossambicus) except that most of the secondary wing feathers are
edged with white whereas the Mozambique has only two edged with
white.
Its song consists of a series of low, rich flute-like notes.
The Lesser and Greater Puff-back Shrikes (D. cubla and D. ferruz
gineus). Both of these birds are very common and haunt the wooded
kloofs and sometimes the forest itself, where their cries at once attract
one's attention, the commonest cry being " Beat-you-well ", but they
have many other calls, another one being " Are-you-well ", these
calls are remarkably clear and loud, and are one of the characteristic
sounds of the forest.
When displaying to the hens, the cocks puff out the loose downy
feathers on the back until they look like black and white balls of
down and chase the hens from tree to tree with a very peculiar jerky
flight, rather like that of a Weaver bird when displaying.
Bush Shrike (Chlorophoneus nigrifrons manningi ). These wonderful
birds, perhaps the most beautiful of all the Shrikes, are really East
African birds, but I have seen them at Selinda. They seem to be
exclusively forest birds, though I once saw an odd one in a tree by the
homestead. They live only in the tops of the tallest trees in the forest
and when in the dark foliaged mahogany-trees, they look like balls of
orange flame flitting about. Their behaviour strangely resembles that
of the Black-backed Weaver, and I have frequently been confused
between the two birds, for their breasts are practically the same colour
and it is impossible to see the upper part of the bird from below. These
shrikes have a remarkable series of rich full notes which are impossible
to describe.
They are usually found in company with other birds, at least that
has always been my experience, in the little parties of Warblers,
Bulbuls, etc. : which move about the forest with the Drongos. In
colour this bird is blue grey on the head, nape, and the upper part of
the mantle, a narrow frontal band and also a stripe from the base of
the beak to the nape, including the lores and ear-coverts, jet black. The
upper parts bright olive green, the tail feathers all but the central
ones, tipped with yellow, the under parts rich golden orange, going
into olive yellow on the flanks and pale yellow on the under tail-coverts.

The beak black, the legs blue grey. The female has the same arrange-
ment of colours as the male, but they are duller.
The Orange-headed Bush Shrike (Laniarius sulphur eipectus).
Another of the brilliantly coloured Shrikes, a most beautiful
creature, which is occasionally seen in the wooded kloofs. I frequently
saw it in the large trees which surrounded the vegetable garden of the
homestead on the mountain slopes. Upon observing one for the
first time it appears to be exceedingly shy and crouches motionless
on a bare branch on a tree, meanwhile making itself as slim as possible,
and when in that position rather resembling a Bee-eater more than a
Shrike. But after a time, when it sees that no harm is meant, it comes
quite close, hopping quite unconcernedly about the trees making a
thorough search for the insects upon which it feeds, and occasionally
giving utterance to its astonishing notes.
Southern Grey-headed Bush Shrike (Laiarius starJci). This large
and richly coloured Shrike can only be observed by very patient
watching, for it seems only to inhabit the dense tangled undergrowth
by the mountain streams, where it creeps about in search of insects.
One of these birds I had under observation for a considerable time in
a large fig-tree : it kept hopping up to a hornets' nest, seizing an insect
each time but running it up and down its beak for a long time before
swallowing it.
Like the rest of the family, this bird has an amazing repertoire of
rich flute-like notes.
The Bertrand Bush Shrike (Laniarius herlrandi). A beautiful bird
but by no means as brilliantly coloured as the rest of the family. It is
found rather sparingly in the dense parts of the forest, where it utters
its peculiar song from the middle of a thick mass of tangled creeper at
the top of a huge tree. This bird seems to be migratory, for it is only
heard and seen at certain times of the year. It goes about in pairs.
The Zambesi and Smith's Helmet Shrikes (Sigmodus tricolor and
Prionops talacoma). These two strange birds are both found on the
wooded slopes of Mount Selinda but in habits they differ greatly ; the
former is shy and wary and frequents the dense trees, the latter is
extremely tame and confiding and will sit preening its feathers within
a few yards of one.

Sydney Porter--Notes on Birds of Mount Selinda 295
Both birds are found in small parties and are extremely garrulous,
as all the Shrikes usually are. As well as insects I have seen these birds
capture small lizards and eat them, but before swallowing them they
batter them about on a branch for a considerable time. The peculiar
red wattle which surrounds the eye of the Zambesi Helmet Shrike
makes the birds look at a distance as though it has sore eyes. I think
that this wattle is unique among birds.
The Black-capped or Layard's Bulbul (Pycnonous layardi). This is
by far the commonest bird on the mountain and in the Selinda district,
every bush and tree seems to be inhabited by them : if a census could
be taken I am sure it would number tens of thousands. These Bulbuls
are omnivorous in their diet, feeding upon fruit, insects, honey, berries,
and even flowers.
Reichenow's Bristle-necked Bulbul (Phyllostrophus strepitans ).
This is a very rare bird and is very seldom seen ; it associates in small
parties, and lives low down in the dense bush on the edge of the forest,
where its presence can always be detected by its loud chattering cry.
The plumage of this Bulbul is very sombre and it superficially
resembles a large brown Warbler rather than a true Bulbul.
The Yellow-streaked Bulbul (Phyllostrophus flavistriatus ). These
Bulbuls are essentially birds of the forest and are seldom found outside
its confines. They are found in small parties passing from one part
of the forest to another, searching the trees and undergrowth for insects.
They show remarkable agility in running up and down the trunks
of the large trees, but I noticed that they only did this on the trees
which had a rough bark or were covered with moss or lichen, thus giving
them a good foothold.
I have often seen these birds pulling to pieces the bunches of dead
leaves which had accumulated in the foot of trees or in the bushes
below, or in the dracaena heads ; they do this in search of spiders and
insects. I have also seen the birds pull the bark off the creepers and the
trees, and they were invariably rewarded by some titbit.
These Bulbuls have a very curious habit of alternately flicking the
wings when searching for insects ; raising first the one and then the
other over the back.
This species, like the rarer Malanji Bulbul, is very fond of grubbing

about in the dead leaves on the ground ; at first I was greatly puzzled
by the sound of rustling leaves always so close at hand, but I was
always unable to see any living creature and it was only after patient
watching that I discovered it was these birds. When they discovered
that they were being watched they would remain perfectly motionless
and as the plumage harmonized so perfectly with their surroundings,
it was well nigh impossible to detect them.
The call of this Bulbul is a clear full note and sometimes it will run
these notes together, thus forming a kind of a song ; occasionally one
hears the true song of this bird which is composed of remarkably rich
flute-like notes and is quite the finest song of any of the Bulbuls.
These birds are experts in catching insects on the wdng, and at times
when the forest is full of a species of small white moth the Bulbuls can
be seen chasing and catching them in mid-air with great agility.
They are also fond of chasing each other through the forest uttering
their remarkable loud ringing notes.
During the month of October I have seen the Bulbuls carrying
beakfulls of fine roots no doubt with the object of nest building, but
though I have searched most diligently, I have never succeeded in
finding a nest, which I believe is a small structure placed between the
leaves in the head of a dracaena.
In colour the Yellow-streaked Bulbul is dull olive above, the head
dark grey, the throat white, below, pale grey finely streaked with
pale yellow, getting deeper on the flanks and sides.
The Malanji Bulbul (Phyllostrophus milanjensis). These green
Bulbuls whose real home is on the high Milanji Plateau in Nyasaland,
are found rather sparingly in the Mount Selinda Forest. They are quite
forest-loving birds but they do not keep exclusively to the forest as
does the Yellow-streaked Bulbul, for examples may sometimes be seen
in the dense jungle growth on the lower slopes of the mountain and also
in the kloofs.
These birds usually live near to the ground and are fond of rooting
about in the dead leaves in search of insects ; they very seldom fly
for any distance, but hop from branch to branch in the thick under-
growth.
They are not nearly as lively or as entertaining as the other Bulbul

but are very quiet and unobtrusive : though easy to approach and watch
when one finds them, they quietly slip away should one approach too
closely.
I have never seen them in parties, but nearly always in pairs or
singly, though sometimes an individual will be in a party of the Yellow-
streaked Bulbuls.
I have seldom heard them utter a note, in fact they are the quietest
birds of the forest.
The general colour of the Malanji Bulbul is a very rich olive green,
yellower below, the outer webs of the flight feathers yellowish green,
the head dark grey, the throat light grey, the feathers of the ear-
coverts have a central white stripe, the eyebrows white, the upper
breast feather with a greyish streak, the legs and beak black, but the
soles of the feet are bright yellow, the eye is large and dark brown.
In the sunshine the bird's plumage, which looks very sombre in the
gloomy light of the forest, assumes a most beautiful moss green shade.
The Mount Selinda Wren-Warbler (Spiloptila chirendensis). This
very rare, delicate, and fairy-like Warbler is found only in the Forest of
Selinda, and in the small forest patches on the neighbouring hills and
mountains. It is a very illusive little bird and frequents only the foliage
at the top of the high forest trees and seldom if ever ventures down into
the undergrowth, as does its congener, the more familiar Bar-throated
Warbler. It keeps in parties composed of four or five individuals and
makes a minute search of the leaves for the tiny insects upon which it
feeds, passing from tree to tree and uttering all the time a series of low
notes. Sometimes the birds will playfully chase each other from branch
to branch with their feathers puffed out and tails spread.
This is the smallest bird which I came across in Africa, its body is
not nearly as large as that of the smallest Sunbird, but the loose fluffy
plumage and exceedingly long tail make the bird appear much larger
than it really is.
In colour this bird is delicate grey, almost white below, and it is
so slim that it could be passed with ease through a small finger ring.
The Bar-throated Warbler (Apalis thoracica). This beautiful little
Warbler is found on the edge of the forest where it at once attracts
one's attention by its loud note. It is the most confiding bird that I

ever came across, and upon seeing a human being it will at once come
wdthin a few feet, hopping about the bushes eyeing one from every
angle, and uttering its chattering notes. This Warbler is usually found
in pairs, though it is occasionally seen in small parties.
It makes a strange clicking noise with its wings as it flies from tree
to tree.
The Cape Thrush (Turdus olivaceus). A local variety or subspecies
of this Thrush inhabits the forest, it is much smaller and very much
darker than the typical Cape Thrush.
It is only found in the deepest recesses of the forest, where it lives
principally on the ground in the shelter of the thick undergrowth
and searches amongst the dead leaves for the insects which constitute
its main food.
I have seldom seen it, for as well as only inhabiting the most
inaccessible parts it is exceedingly shy. Very occasionally I have seen
individuals in the high trees, but this is only at certain seasons of
the year.
Peter's Thrush (Turdus libonyanus Iropicalis). This beautiful Thrush
is fairly common, and one or two are always sure to be seen in the
tangled bush by the mountain streams. It is not at all a shy bird
and will sometimes burst into a rich melodious song whilst one is
watching it.
The most noticeable feature of the bird is its bright orange beak.
The nest, rather a meagre affair, is placed between the fork
of a tree and is almost impossible to detect owing to the material
harmonizing so well with the trunk of the tree ; it is like the nest of the
European Thrush but is shallower and covered on the outside with
lichen and bits of bark.
The call is rather Finch-like, the birds continually answering one
another. The Peter's Thrush is subspecies of the better known
Kurrickaine Thrush (Turdus libonyanus).
Swynnerton's Pobin (Erithacus swynnertoni). This rare and very
beautiful Robin is found in the dense thickets in the Selinda Forest
where it hops and creeps about the undergrowth. It was discovered
by a Mr. Swynnerton, who for some years resided near the forest, and
was described in the Ibis for 1907. He described it as common, but

Sydney Porter--Notes on Birds of Mount Belinda 299
during the period that I was there I found it far from common, seeing
perhaps on the average two pairs of birds each time that I went into
the forest.
The birds are usually found in pairs, and their presence is easily
detected by the fact that they are continually uttering a low twittering
note. There is a kind of forest cricket which makes a noise almost
identically the same, and I have frequently been deceived by it.
These birds are strikingly tame and confiding, but are very difficult
to watch on account of the dense undergrowth.
In demeanour they very much resemble the European Robin, and
always keep either on the ground or on the low branches very near to it.
Upon seeing a human being they will approach within about three
yards, uttering all the time their curious low twittering, and when
they have had a good look at the intruder they disappear again into the
tangled vegetation.
The tail is carried at an angle of about 45 degrees over the back,
and is continually jerked up and down, thus making the wffiite under
tail-coverts very conspicuous.
The nest is placed between the leaves of a dracsena head.
The food consists of insects which are found in the rotting
vegetation on the ground.
In colour, the male is olive green above, browner on the wings, and
grey on the wing coverts, the head and throat are grey, below the
white throat is a white band, and below this a black one, the under-
parts are bright orange, the under tail-coverts pure white, the female
is the same but not so brightly coloured.
The Angola Rock Thrush (Monticola angolensis). This bird is only
an occasional visitor to the Selinda district, though it sometimes breeds
there, the breeding season being August. It is seldom found on the
ground as with most of the Rock Thrushes, but nearly always in the trees.
It is a quiet and unassuming bird and is consequently very seldom
seen. I once saw one vigorously chasing a female Black Cuckoo Shrike
from tree to tree. It seems to be an extremely rare bird in the whole
of South Africa.
The general colour of the male is slaty grey, marked with black
above, the throat and breast light grey, unmarked, the lower parts

light chestnut. The female differs considerably, the whole of the upper
surface being of a mottled brown colour without a trace of grey.
The White-starred Bush Robin (Tarsiger stellatus). I only saw this
species once perched in a high tree in the forest. This is rather unusual,
for this bird, like the previously mentioned Robin, is practically
terrestrial, living in the thick undergrowth and searching amongst the
dead leaves for insects. It is a very shy and retiring species, and is.
no doubt more plentiful than is supposed.
The Natal Yellow Flycatcher (Chloropeta natalensis). The demeanour
of these beautiful little Flycatchers rather resembles that of the
Warblers, which birds I first mistook them for.
They frequent the bracken and grass-covered spots on the edge of
the great forest, seldom if ever perching upon the trees, but upon the
bracken and grass stems. They are invariably found in pairs.
Both birds have a very peculiar short song which is uttered at
frequent intervals and resembles the song of a warbler.
In colour both birds are olive green above, the feathers of the
head being full and loose, forming a crest, the under surface is bright
yellow with a greenish tinge. The legs are black, also the upper
mandible, the lower one being brown. The beak is very broad and
compressed.
A Flycatcher, which I could not identify, is conspicuous not on
account of its colouring, which is very sombre, but on account of
its demeanour, for it is usually seen in a very agitated state climbing
about the creepers which hang from the forest trees, fanning its-
wings and tail.
These little birds seem to be in a continual hurry, and give one the
impression that life for them is just one long hustle.
They are always found in pairs and keep very close to each other.
This is a very tiny Flycatcher, the smallest I have ever seen, the
long fluffy plumage making it appear much larger than it really is.
In colour it is blue grey, the head which is crested is jet black, the
tail greyish black, the outer feathers tipped with white, the outer edge
of the first two being white. The centre of the abdomen, light grey.
The male and female are similar.

Sydney Porter--Notes on Birds of Mount Belinda 301
*Flycatcher of the forest and can he seen and heard everywhere. It is
extremely tame and very inquisitive and upon seeing a stranger it will
approach within a few yards uttering all the time its strange alarm note.
Usually it is found in pairs, though at some seasons it associates
in small flocks, and travels from one part of the forest to another, the
birds chasing each other from branch to branch singing meanwhile
a peculiar low song, or after the males have playfully chased each other,
they sometimes have a singing contest, sitting side by side they trill
their hardest.
Of all the forest birds I prefer this one, it seems such a companion-
able kind of a creature.
In colour it is a mixture of rich chestnut, black, grey, and white, the
female differs in the arrangement of the colours.
The Lead-headed Flycatcher (Terpsiphone plumbeiceps). This bird
differs only from the Paradise Flycatcher in the colour of the head.
It is far from common and is occasionally seen in the wooded kloofs,
flying with light airy grace from tree to tree, its extraordinary long
tail feathers streaming behind.
This Flycatcher has a harsh but very distinctive song which it
utters as it flits about amid the branches.
When the male displays he chases the female from tree to tree, and
upon getting near her, he lifts up his long tail so that it forms an arch,
sways from side to side, and sings his discordant lay which no doubt is
sweet to his better half's ears.
From October these birds become more plentiful, coming down
from the North.
They are extremely restless creatures, and are continually on the
move, passing from tree to tree the whole day through.
Drongo (Dicrurus spec. ?). There is a Drongo which is very common
in the forest of Mount Selinda, and it seems to be intermediate between
D. afer and D. ludwigi, but differs from both in having the under wing
and the under tail-coverts spotted with white. Its whole demeanour
differs from that of the Square-tailed Drongo, a bird which I w T as very
familiar with in Mashonaland. Its calls are entirely different; also I have
never come across a bird with such a variety of notes. Sometimes this
used to be rather annoying, for upon hearing what I thought was the

call of a new bird in a dense part of the forest, I would stalk it sometimes
for hours, getting nearly torn to pieces meanwhile in the terrible
" wait a bit " creepers as the Dutch call them, only to find that it was
this Drongo.
There is a very interesting description of this bird in the Ibis for
January, 1907. It is described as D. ludivigi , and it tells how this bird
acts as a protector of the other forest birds. Perhaps I may be forgiven
for quoting it in full :*--
" It possesses to the full the bold habits and loud and varied cries
of its near relative D. afer , and quite takes its place in Chirinda (Selinda)
as the ' Induna yezinyone ' (General of the Birds), for not only will it
defend the rights of its own fellows, but is also perfectly ready to play
the knight errant to any forest damsel in distress. Only the other day
upon going up to a sapling in which a Haplopelia was sitting upon her
eggs I was vigorously assailed by a pair of Drongos, which flew straight
in my face and only turned back when a yard from me, they were backed
by noise rather than action by a family of Bulbuls, yet the Doves are
not of the Drongo clan."
Personally I have never seen the Drongos defending the other
birds, but I have always noticed that where ever a pair of the Drongos
were there were many other species of birds, forming a very mixed
party, and roaming together from one part of the forest to another. *
These parties were composed mostly of Warblers, Shrikes, Bulbuls,
Flycatchers, and Black-backed Weavers.
The Black Cuckoo Shrike (Campophaga nigra). The Cuckoo Shrikes
are a strange class of birds and though they resemble in some ways
both the Shrikes and the Cuckoos they are allied to the Drongos. The
Black Cuckoo Shrike might easily be mistaken for the Square-tailed
Drongo and many times I have had the greatest difficulty in distinguish-
ing between the two birds. In size and colour these birds are almost
identical, but in demeanour they are entirely different. The present
bird lacks the light butterfly flight of the other bird, neither has it the
habit of returning to the same perch as does the Drongo after its frequent
aerial excursions after insects ; also the Cuckoo Shrike is usually accom-
panied by his very strikingly coloured mate.
The Cuckoo Shrikes, though inhabiting South and East Africa, are

far from common anywhere in those regions, they are quiet birds, and
do not obtrude themselves upon one's notice, they live in the thick
trees and spend most of their time searching the insects which constitute
the main portion of their food.
Hartlaub's Cockoo Shrike (Campohhaga hartlaubi). This bird is
unique on account of the great difference in plumage between the two
sexes, whereas the male is glossy blue-black with the lesser and median
wing-coverts bright lemon yellow, the female is a striking mixture of
grey, white, and brown, heavily barred with black and washed all over
with bright yellow, brighest on the flanks and back. One seeing these
birds for the first time would think that they were entirely different
species.
They seldom make any sound and live in the dense vegetation
by the mountain streams, and are seldom seen except in the early
morning, wdien they are busily engaged in searching for insects.
The Black-chested Cuckoo Shrike (Graucalus pectoralis). This is
a very shy and retiring species and moves about in the tops of the
trees, it also catches insects on the wing after the manner of a Drongo.
This bird resembles a Shrike more than any other member of the
family, possibly this is owing to the pale grey plumage.
The only note that I have heard both sex utter is a clear, thin, but
very melodious piping whistle, though at times the male bird will
lengthen himself out, give utterance to a peculiar low metallic note.
I once saw a pair of these birds take possession of a large tree and
drive away every other bird in the vicinity, once they had a very tough
fight with a Black-headed Oriole. After the birds had kept this up for a
considerable time, they departed.
The colour of this Cuckoo Shrike is a very pale French grey, darker
on the throat, the under surface is pure white, the central tail feathers
are grey, the rest blackish tipped with white. The tail coverts are very
long, and almost cover the tail. The gape is exceedingly wide.
The Grey Cuckoo Shrike (Graucalus ccesius). I found this bird very
much shier than the Black-chested Cuckoo Shrike, and also very hard
to observe, for it only frequents the tops of the tallest forest trees,
where it searches for insects.
It always goes about in pairs.

804 Sydney Portei--Notes on Birds of Mount Selinda
In colour it is a uniform slate grey, lighter on the head, the lores
are black.
The Blue Swallow (Hirundo atroccerulea). These beautiful little
Swallows are fairly common about Mount Selinda, but their appearance
is very erratic. Some days they will be seen the whole day through,
but at other times they will disappear for a week or two. When flying
the under wing-coverts appear to be white, but this is due to the fact
that the shafts of the flight feathers are that colour.
Like the rest of the family these birds are wonderfully agile on the
wing. Their flight is so light and buoyant that they appear more like
feathers blown about by the wind than birds.
Sometimes they skim the surface of the water, catching flies and
other small aquatic insects which walk on the surface.
The Blue Swallow, as its name implies, is a beautiful dark shining
blue over the whole of the body.
The Smaller Stripe-breasted Swallow (Hirundo puella ). These birds
are seldom seen but when they do appear they are usually seen with
the Blue Swallows circling round and round at no great distance from
the ground, hawking for small insects.
They settle at frequent intervals on the trees, and give utterance
to a low twittering song.
The Scimitar Bill (Rhinopomastus cyanomelas). These strange little
birds are often seen running about the trunks and branches of the
frees after the manner of a Tree-creeper.
I once saw one of them dispose of a very large hairy caterpillar,
it must have battered it about for at least a quarter of an hour on a
branch, possibly to get rid of the hairs before swallowing it, an opera-
tion which in itself seemed to be a great effort.
It is simply wonderful how advantageous the long thin curved
beak is, it enables the bird to probe into holes and fissures in the bark
of the trees in search of insects which it would be quite unable to reach
if its beak was straight.
Nightjars are very common indeed on Mount Selinda, I observed
three species, namely the Bufous-cheeked (Caprimulgus rufigena),
the Fiery-necked ( C . fervidus), and the Standard-winged (Cosmetornis
vexillarius).

These birds are seldom seen during the day unless one puts them up
out of the grass. At night they are very active, and I have frequently
caught them with the aid of a hunting lamp ; they are blinded by the
brilliant light and can be picked up on the road.
The Standard-winged Nightjar is fond of lying in the sandy wagon
track which runs from Mount Belinda to Chipinga, and upon the
approach of a motor-car, a rare occurrence in that part of the w^orld,
the bird gets into such a state of confusion owing to the glare of the
headlights that it almost gets tangled up in its extraordinarily
long wing feathers (these feathers are only worn in the breeding season,
and are between 2 and 3 feet long, and look like two white ribbons
tied on to the bird).
The Cinnamon Roller (Eurystomus afer). This remarkably handsome
bird I have seen but a few times. It frequents the tops of the thickly
foliaged trees, and it differs very much in its habits from the
other Rollers in being very inobtrusive, whereas the others love to
flaunt their beauty before every eye.
These Rollers are very hard to see when in the trees, their plumage
seeming to harmonize so well with their surroundings, but their
presence can usually be detected by the harsh croak which they utter
at frequent intervals during the day.
I have several times observed a pair of these birds sitting on a
branch about a foot away from each other, and each one alternately
throwing back its head and making a very peculiar gurgling sound,
which seemed to run right down the scale; this noise is made deep down
in the throat with the beak closed. The other cry or croak, though not
loud, is extremely penetrating and can be heard from a great distance.

essential. On the other hand, if only required as pets, and very charming
pets they make, they can be kept under almost any conditions.
They are very hardy and are practically omnivorous, so, of course,
are very easy to cater for. They are, however, liable to get their feet
frostbitten in very severe weather, and are better kept under shelte 1
whilst these conditions prevail.
At the beginning of last season I had two pairs of the small Cayenne
Wood Rail (Aramides cayennensis) and one pair of the much larger
Ypecaha Rail (Aramides ypecaah ). I turned these into a fair-sized
aviary, about one-third of which consisted of a pond, heavily over-
grown with bullrushes and other aquatic plants, and bordered on one side
by a thorn hedge about 6 feet high. Both the cock Wood Rails were
extremely tame, and were very fond of being handled and petted. The
cock Ypecaha was also tame, and would feed from the hand, but all
three hens were extremely wild and were never seen. When they had
been together a week or two the two Wood Rail cocks had to
be separated, as they were continually fighting. When in action they
are very much like two long-legged Bantams, striking at one another
with their feet, and gripping each other's necks with their powerful
beaks. When equally matched they do each other little harm, but if
one bird is markedly weaker, he is pretty certain to be killed. When one
cock had been removed the other promptly made friends with the tame
Ypecaha. I expected now that I had made a mistake in the sex of this
bird, as I frequently saw them caressing each other, and it was not
long before they were obviously mated. It appears that as in most
cases in the Limicolae, the female is considerably larger than the male.
About this time the Ypecaha began to &amp;apos;show traces of extreme bad
temper. It would unhesitatingly attack anyone entering the aviary,
at first by frontal attacks, which were more or less easily beaten off,
but afterwards by much more effective attacks from the rear. Its
habit was to lay in wait behind a bush or bunch of weeds, and then
spring upon its victim from behind, clutching the calf of the leg with
its claw and then driving in its pickaxe-like beak. The effect upon
visitors to the aviaries was astonishing. Artificial silk stockings were
very poor protection. I must confess to having had at times some
amusing moments. However, its attacks at last began to become more

serious. My man complained that he had had holes pecked in his
trousers. I did not mind that, hut when he stated that he had holes
pecked in his boots also and wanted new ones, I thought it time to
take action, so when I next entered the aviary and it started to peck
holes in my boots, I gave it a little kick, which unfortunately disabled
its leg. I found the next day that the reason for its savagery was that
it had a nest in the reeds. The nest was entirely concealed in the centre
of a dense clump of water-mint, and was approached by a runway
of broken-down reeds. The eggs were cream coloured with mauve and
brown spots, and were exactly like some eggs received direct from Brazil.
I have no doubt that I should have bred some interesting hybrids
#
had it not been for my hasty temper.
This year I turned into the same Aviary a pair of the Wood Rails
and the smaller of the Ypecahas. One of the Wood Rails was much
larger than the other, and I thought at the time it must be a different
species. * For some weeks nothing happened. The cock remained equally
tame, he would always come to be played with, and would sing at
request, much to the amusement of visitors, but I never saw the hen,
and the Ypecaha was equally wild. Early in July I noticed the beginning
of a nest in a willow about 6 feet above the water, on 15th July this
contained five eggs, one of which I took for my collection. On com-
paring this egg with the- Ypecahas' egg laid the preceding year, and
with those from Brazil, I was surprised to find that there was practically
no difference. As the Ypecaha is a very much bigger bird, I thought
that the eggs would also be larger, but this is apparently not the case.
The Wood Rails having the Aviary to themselves, were not disturbed.
The cock sat by day and the hen by night, and as the former was so
tame I was able to get some good photos of him on the nest. On
4th August four young ones were hatched, these remained in the nest
all the next day. How they were got down I do not know, but on the
6th I found the cock brooding two pretty little dark chocolate coloured
young ones. I concluded that the hen had the other pair, but if this was
the case she evidently let them die, as I never saw them. The cock now
built a nest of dead reeds about 6 inches above the water, and for the
first two days looked after his young ones entirely himself.
They fed readily from his beak, taking soaked bread, small seed,

and maggots. The third day the hen resumed charge of them at night,
leaving the cock at times for a little exercise and recreation. During
all this time I have not heard either bird singing, and the cock did not
present himself for his daily petting.
At ten days old the young became much shyer, possibly the influence
of the hen, but as the cock still takes charge of them by day I am hoping
that they may grow up reasonably tame.
About the middle of August I went for my holiday, so have no
particulars of happenings during that time. On my return in September
I found the young birds had grown remarkably and were independent
of their parents. They were about two-thirds the size of their parents,
and were already assuming the adult plumage, the orange on the breast
of the larger of the two being very conspicuous. The smaller bird
was much duller in colour. They were very shy, and kept closely to
the thick cover of the reed bed. Not much is known of the wild life
of the Wood Rail, but writing of the Ypecaha, Hudson says :--
" These Rails are found as far south as the thirty-fifth parallel of
latitude, and are abundant along the marshy borders of the Plata,
frequenting the vast reed-beds and forests of water-loving Erythrina
eritsa-galli. Where they are never persecuted they are bold, pugnacious
birds, coming out of the reeds by day and attacking the domestic
poultry about the houses and even in the streets of the villages situated
on the borders of their marshy haunts. But when compelled to place
man on the list of their enemies, it is a difficult matter to get a sight of
one ; for, like all birds that rise laboriously, they are vigilant to excess
and keep themselves so well concealed that the sportsman may pass
through their haunts every day of the year and the Ypecaha still be
to him no more than a ' wandering voice '. But even persecution does
not entirely obliterate a certain inquisitive boldness which characterizes
them. Usually they roam singly in quest of food, but have reunions
in the evening and occasionally during the day, especially in gloomy
weather. On misty days they often wander to a distance from the
covert, walking with an easy, somewhat stately grace, jerking the tail
at every stride, and running with a velocity no man can equal. Where
there are woods they usually fly, when disturbed, into a tree ; and it is
in connexion with this habit that the Ypecaha sometimes makes a curious

mistake in places where it has not been much shot at. One day, while
pushing my way through a dense growth of rushes, I saw two Ypecahas,
not 15 yards from me, on the horizontal branch of a tree, to which they
had evidently flown for safety. I was anxious to secure them, but
surprised at their temerity, and wishing to find out its cause,
I approached them still nearer, and then stood for some time observing
them. It was easy to see that they fancied themselves quite safe from
me while off the ground. In the most unconcerned manner they con-
tinued strutting up and down along the branch, jerking their &amp;apos;tails, and
turning about this way and that, as if to tantalize their baffled enemy
by ostentatiously displaying their graces.
" When surprised on the open ground the Ypecaha lies close, like
a Tinamou, refusing to rise until almost trodden upon. It springs
up with a loud-sounding whirr, rushes violently through the air, till,
gaming the reeds, it glides a few yards and then drops : its flight is
thus precisely like that of the Tinamou, and is more sounding and
violent than that of the Grouse or Partridge. On spying an intruder
it immediately utters a powerful cry, in strength and intonation not
unlike that of the Peafowl. This note of alarm is answered by other
birds at a distance as they hastily advance to the spot where the
warning was sounded. The cry is repeated at irregular intervals, first
on one side, then on the other, as the birds change their position to
dog the intruder&amp;apos;s steps and inspect him from the reeds. I have
surprised parties of them in an open space, and shot one or more ;
but no sooner had the survivors gained their refuge than they turned
about to watch and follow me, sounding their powerful alarm the whole
time. I have frequently been followed half a mile through the rashes
by them, and by lying close and mimicking their cries have always
succeeded in drawing them about me.
## Whilst screaming they rush from side to side as if possessed
with frenzy, the wings spread and agitated, the beak wide open and
raised vertically. I never observed them fight or manifest anger
towards each other during these performances ; and, knowing the
pugnacious spirit of the Ypecahas, and how ready they are to seek a
quarrel with birds of other species, this at first surprised me, for I was
then under the mistaken impression that these gatherings were in some
way related to the sexual instinct.

" Whilst watching them I also remarked another circumstance.
When concealing myself amongst the rashes I have&amp;apos; been compelled
to place myself so disadvantageous^, owing to the wet ground, that
any single bird straying accidentally into the space would have dis-
covered my presence immediately; yet the birds have entered and
finished their performance without seeing me, so carried away are they
by the emotion that possesses them during these moments. But no
sooner has the wild chorus ended than, aware of my presence, they have
fled precipitately into the reeds."
Since writing the above the Cayenne Rails have made another nest
and are again incubating, which points to their being double brooded
(29th September).

In addition to the Amazon Parrots ( Amazona ) which have already
been dealt with there are certain other American genera which must
be mentioned here :--
The Short-tailed Parrot (Pachynus brachyurus) is a perfect
miniature Amazon, its length not exceeding 8 inches. It has a large
beak and square, very short tail. It is a green bird with red patches on
the shoulders and another at the root of the tail. It is a native of the
Upper Amazon and the Equator, and is very rarely imported.
The genus Pionus contains several species, they are smaller than
the Amazons ; their under tail-coverts are always red, and the rest of
their plumage usually spotted with various colours. Generally speaking,
they are gentle and affectionate, and sometimes are good talkers. The
sexes are alike.
The Blue-headed Parrot (Pionus menstruus) from South America
has a blue head, neck, and upper chest, with a black crescent on its
cheeks ; the rest of the body is yellowish green ; sub-caudals red ;
beak brown and pink. It is the species most commonly met with in
captivity

The Sordid Parrot (P. sordidus) from Venezuela has a mingled
blue and grey head, its back, wings, and tail are grey and green ; the
under part of its body is grey shot with violet, sub-caudals reel ; the
beak orange red.
Maximilians Parrot (P. maximiliani ) from South-East Brazil
and Paraguay, has a blue head, neck, and breast, and a red forehead ;
its abdomen is green, with blue markings, sub-caudals red and blue ;
its back, wings, and tail yellowish green ; beak yellowish brown.
The Red-beaked Parrot (P. corallinus) from Colombia and the
Equator is deep green, lighter beneath with a violet band across the
breast; beak and sub-caudals bright red.
The White-fronted Parrot (P. senilis) from Cental America has
the forehead, front of the head and a spot on the throat white ; breast
and neck blue and dark green ; the abdomen, back, wings, and tail are
olive green mingled with brown and blue ; sub-caudals red, beak
yellowish.
The White-headed Parrot (P. seniloides) from Venezuela and
Colombia is green shaded violet on the breast, with the top of the head
and cheeks white, spotted with black and red ; sub-caudals red, beak
yellowish.
The Bronze-winged Parrot (P. chalcopterus) from Colombia
is greenish and blackish blue, with the wing-coverts brown and red
sub-caudals ; tail and quill-feathers, blue ; beak yellowish.
The Violet Parrot (P. fuscus) from G-uiana is brown variegated
with purple above, reddish purple underneath ; forehead red, beak
grey and yellowish white.
The Hawk-headed Parrot (Deroptyus accipitrinus) is one of the
choicest and prettiest Parrots. Fairly large, but slender and lengthy,
it has a somewhat long tail and strong, short beak. It differs from the
Amazons in having the feathers at the nape of the neck very much
developed and rounded, which it can raise like a collarette ; its feathers
are red, edged with blue, as are also those of the breast and abdomen ;
the head is brown, streaked with pale grey. The rest of the body is
green, variegated with black and blue on wings and tail; beak black.
Hawk-headed Parrots are natives of Guiana and the banks of the
Amazon, they are charming birds in confinement, gentle and confiding,

equal to the Blue-fronted Amazon, although they do not talk so well.
When first received they are delicate, but hardy when once acclimatized.
Unfortunately they are rare and seldom met with.
The Blue-bellied Parrot (Triclaria cyanogaster), from South-East
Brazil, is likewise very rare. It is green, the middle of the abdomen
is violet blue and the beak white. It lives very well in captivity. It
is the same size as the Pionus, but has a longer tail.
The Caiques are distinguished by their slight figures and light
colours, in which different shades of yellow and red predominate,
ranging from orange and yellow ochre to creamy white.
The Black-headed Caique (Caica melanocephala) from Guiana,
has the top of the head and the quills black, the mantle, wings, and tail
green ; an emerald green spot under the eye ; nape, face, neck, thighs,
and sub-caudels different shades of yellow; breast, abdomen, and
sides tawny white, beak and feet black.
The White-bellied Caique (C. leucogaster) from the Lower
Amazon has the head, neck, and sub-caudals varying shades of yellow;
breast and abdomen tawny white ; back, wings, tail, and thighs green ;
beak yellowish white ; feet light horn colour.
C. xanthomera from High Amazon is distinguished by.its yellow
thighs from the preceding species.
The Bed-Capped Parrot (Pionopsittacus pileatus) from South-
East Brazil, is a delightful little bird of about the same size as a Caique,
having a short narrow tail. It should be treated like a Parrakeet.
The male is green, with the wings and tail partly blue ; the vertex
and sides of the head red ; beak light grey and brown. The hen has
no red on the head. This species is very gentle and familiar, and makes
an admirable cage or aviary bird. Unfortunately it is rare. There are
about ten more species in the genus, all very pretty, which have never
been imported, except the P. caica of Guiana, which is green with a
black head, the neck feathers and the nape are yellow outlined with
black, wings and tail marked with deep blue.
The genus Urochroma comprises another group of very pretty
little American Parrots, with bright and varied colouring, which
unfortunately are never brought over nowadays. Formerly it seems
that at least one species, U. cingulata, was occasionally brought to

Europe, for this little bright green Parrot, having part of the wings,
back, and tail black, with yellow and pinky lilac markings, is often
represented in eighteenth century pictures. It inhabits Trinidad and
Venezuela. The same may be said of that curious Vulturine Parrot
from the Lower Amazon (Gypopsittacus vulturinus).
A BURIED COMPLEX
By the Marquess of Tavistock
Psychology tells us that if certain instincts and impulses are checked
and driven in upon themselves and denied their natural outlet, the
result is a warping of the personality and the appearance of odd
prejudices, or perhaps fears. What is true of men also seems to be true,
to a certain extent, of birds. Apart from the simpler pleasures of eating,
drinking, bathing, and exercising himself, the two main interests in one
adult Broad-tailed Parrakeet's life are the joys and cares of marriage
and the excitement of a real good fight. He does not just fight to
secure a mate or hold what our modern scientific field naturalists call
a " territory " ; he fights for the pure joy of fighting, and his wife is
scarcely less fond of it than he, either giving him the moral support of
much back-chat directed against his opponent, or herself engaging the
latter's lady in open conflict. Now it stands to reason that if you take
the poor fellow and condemn him to permanent solitary confinement
within the narrow bounds of a Parrot cage, something is pretty sure to
go wrong. He may just pine away and die after a few years ; or he may
take to feather plucking; or, if his body survives the strain of the changed
environment, his mind may become affected ; in other words, he may
develop a buried complex. Cock Broadtails hardly ever show that
intense affection for human beings, which is the main reason why so
many tame birds make bad breeders, but long confinement in a cage
is apt to affect their minds in a way which causes them to be a vexation
of the spirit to anyone wishing to pair them up. I knew one whose
complex caused him to hate all birds of his own genus, and most of all
the females of his own species, but who was filled with a passionate
and promiscuous affection for all Parrots and Parrakeets of other
genera, regardless of sex. Another, although a perfect fiend with

human beings, was terrified of the hen who was provided for him, and as
a cock Broadtail, like a bishop, must rule his household wisely and well
if any good is to result, nothing ever came of that menage. A third was
so affected by the sight of the female, when, after long years of waiting,
she at length gladdened his eyes, that he fell dead from his perch in a
fit of apoplexy.
For several years I have had two hen Brown's Parrakeets ; one,
mated to a cock kindly lent me by one of our members, is at present
engaged in rearing a family. The other has already figured in the story
of " The Diplomat The poor old diplomat, a Mealy Rosella, at length
joined the majority last winter, and the Browns was left without a
mate of any sort or kind, let alone the cock of her own species with
whom I had always been longing to provide her. But when I visited
the Crystal Palace Show what should I see but a fine cock Brown's,
a winner in his class, industriously feeding the bars of his cage. I
decided instantly that if it could possibly be arranged I would soon
give him something better to feed than that. On looking him up in
the catalogue I found he was priced at a very high figure--about twice
his actual value, but visions of a nest of young Brown's floated before
my eyes and despite the fact that I have invariably had the worst
possible luck with every bird I have paid an outrageous figure for
in order to make up a breeding pair, I claimed him the same evening.
A few days later, however, my hopes were dashed to the ground, for
I received a letter from the Show Secretary telling me that for some
mysterious reason my cheque only reached him after the Show was over,
and in the meantime the owner--a lady--had decided not to part with
the bird. I determined to have one more try and wrote again asking
whether the Brown's owner would be prepared to consider lending him
for breeding purposes if she received half of any brood that might
result. Not long afterwards I had a very kind letter from her saying
that on thinking things over she had decided that " Joey " would be
happier with me, and so I could have him after all. He had been
privately imported and they had had him some time, and were very
fond of him. I thanked her very much indeed, saying that I felt rather
a brute for taking away a pet to which she was attached ; I did agree,
however, that, apart from selfish considerations, Joey (who was merely

steady and not finger-tame), would be happier in an aviary and she
would find the talking Parrot with which she contemplated replacing
him, a very satisfactory substitute ; remembering, however, the odd
inhibitions from which caged Broadtails are apt to suffer, I suggested
returning Joey if he did not approve of the hen on being first introduced,
as with birds of his family it is usually a question of love or hate at
first sight, and both passions are usually enduring. It did not seem
worth while that Joey's owner should have to part with him if he was
not going to settle down to increasing the Brown's population. In due
course Joey arrived and was introduced to his intended bride. He
seemed rather overwhelmed by the novelty and excitement of his
surroundings--freedom in a big aviary and the presence of numerous
other birds of his own and allied species. However, for a little while
things seemed to promise well; he displayed to the hen, who showed
the combination of appreciation and modesty proper to the occasion.
Later in the day, however, he was inclined to attack her and drive her
about, but as she did not seem to take his hostile demonstrations very
seriously, I put it down to over-excitement and decided that if I
kept him they would soon settle down. So Joey and the hen occupied
adjacent aviaries with a communication passage open between them.
At night I shut them up in separate shelters, for I did not dare to leave
them together in a confined space. Weeks went by, but the wretched
Joey refused to settle down. Sometimes he would be quite friendly and
allow the hen to sit by him on the same perch, but soon afterwards he
would start driving her savagely from pillar to post. I tried everything
I could think of to induce him to behave : I hung up a nest-box, hoping
that the suggestive influence of the round, dark hole might restore
equilibrium to his erratic soul; but he ignored it. Most of the time he
spent on the side of the aviary nearest to that occupied by the other
pair of Brown's, whom he was evidently dying to fight. I therefore
covered that side with canvas, so that he could no longer see them. But
Joey was irreconcilable ; for years he had been denied the glories
of battle : the calls of his neighbours excited and maddened him ; he
longed to sink his beak once more in someone's flesh and feathers and
if no better substitute were provided he would gladly make use of the
hen. Finally I grew completely disgusted with him ; I could no longer

afford to devote a whole aviary to him, so I decided to give him his
liberty. There was, as I thought, no unattached hen, other than his
present companion, on whom he could bestow his affections. If he
wanted a fight there were some eight pairs of Broadtails, in different
aviaries, who would be only too ready to oblige him and perhaps when
he had had his bellyful of fighting his complex would be solved, and he
would be ready to be sensible. I accordingly removed him to the aviary
up the garden from which liberty birds are usually started, and when
he had learned where the food was, I let him go. Joey wasted no time ;
as soon as the top of the flight was opened he darted through it. A few
moments later he was heading for the aviaries like a parched traveller
in the desert who sees a spring before him. He passed over the hen
Brown's aviary, not heeding her for a moment and flung himself on to
that occupied by the pair. The cock, though moulting, was more than
ready : Joey had a perfectly glorious morning.
Fortunately, however excellent the intentions of the combatants,
not much damage can be done through half-inch mesh wire-netting ;
it is too narrow to permit the terrible grip that tears the upper mandible
completely off. By the evening Joey was tired and his toes were some-
what sore, but he was otherwise uninjured ; he had, however, conceived
some respect for his opponent, and spent most of the following day
harrying a young pair of Yellow-rumped Parrakeets who did not at
first realize that he could not reach them and that the murderous
threats he hurled at them could not be carried into execution. For some
weeks he divided his time between the pair of Brown's and the pair of
Yellow-rumps ; although socially a failure, he was not in other respects
a fool, for he returned to the aviary up the garden for food and made use
of its shelter in bad weather with a readiness surprising in a bird so
newly turned out and strange to the place. As time went on, the
Yellow-rumps not only lost their fear of him, but the cock began to
resent his presence and finally made himself master. Joey led an
unhappy existence, assaulted and bitten in the toes both by the Brown's
and the Yellow-rump, but the perverse fowl still preferred to play the
part of unwanted hanger-on to both pairs sooner than accept the
advances of the nice lady who was still longing to bestow her heart upon
him. Finally he did leave the two unfriendly couples to console himself

elsewhere, but, alas ! not in the way I either anticipated or desired.
It happened that there was a second pair of Yellow-rumps. The hen
was very forward in every sense of the term ; the cock, a new arrival,
was less so. Joey, by this time had had almost enough of warfare and
was beginning to be inclined to allow an innings to the tenderer passion.
He made advances to the hen Yellow-rump which her husband was too
poor-spirited to resent. Soon he was feeding her through the wire.
The abandoned lady believed in having two strings to her bow, for when
her proper mate offered to feed her she made no bones about accepting
his attentions also. My aviary attendant then put a stop to the scandal
by catching up the Brown's and condemning him to the society of a
young cock Crimson-wing. Joey bit the Crimson-wing in the leg,
and was then removed to his old aviary, next the hen Brown's. I have
not ventured to let her join him, as three months' liberty have put him
in splendid condition and she might have difficulty in escaping if he
attacked her. He now spends all his time on the opposite side of the
aviary calling to the Yellow-rump ; but the Yellow-rump has com-
pletely forgotten him.

It is a matter of common remark that two writers on aviculture,
both experienced, will often give the same species of bird an entirely
different character, one describing it as hardy, the other as delicate
and short-lived. If the reader has had good luck with the bird in question,
he is apt to consider that there was something lacking in the aviary
management of the authority who has labelled it delicate ; if, on the
other hand, he has been unlucky, he will probably come to the con-
clusion that the person who found it hardy was unusually fortunate in
coming across those exceptionally robust specimens that occasionally
occur among many delicate species, which will live and thrive under
conditions which are soon fatal to nine-tenths of their fellows.
I have had the, perhaps not altogether unusual, experience of keeping
a large collection of the same set of species of birds in three different

districts consecutively, during a period of some twenty years or rather
less. Careful post mortem examination has been made of practically
all birds that died. As a result of my observations, I have discovered
an interesting, if not very welcome fact, which throws further light on
the contradictory experiences of apparently equally skilful aviculturists.
Quite apart from feeding and housing , temperature and degree of moisture,
condition of soil and condition of bird, certain districts are far more
unhealthy than others for certain species of birds. This would appear to
be due to the fact that some localities, for reasons I do not pretend to
understand, are more favourable than others to the rapid growth and
virulence of bacteria inimical to birds, particularly those causing
pneumonia and perhaps also enteritis. So marked is the effect of a
locality favourable to harmful bacteria that it may outweigh every other
influence commonly and rightly regarded as having an important
bearing on avian health. There are some birds I have found it almost
impossible to keep alive in one district even during perfect weather, and
when in perfect condition and ideally housed, which in another
district gave no trouble at all in worse weather, when newly imported
and housed in dirtier, draughtier, more sunless, and in every way
more unsuitable aviaries. This does not mean that there is any virtue
in dirty and ramshackle aviaries, as we are sometimes half-inclined to
believe when we see birds which we can hardly keep alive breeding in the
aviaries of our friends, under very inferior conditions ; but it does mean
that there is another extremely important factor which has hitherto,
perhaps, rather escaped notice. We are told that many of the bacteria
causing human diseases are present in small numbers nearly everywhere
and that it is only when certain conditions favour their undue increase,
or when a person's vitality is lowered that they become dangerous.
The same is doubtless true of bacteria causing disease in birds. We can
do a tremendous lot to protect our birds from disease by keeping them
in perfect plumage and bodily condition by correct feeding and housing.
There are some birds that will never get ill anywhere so long as their
housing and feeding are of the best; there are many which will keep
healthy in most places if their food and accommodation are excellent.
Some of the commonest and most troublesome diseases are also to a
great extent controllable. Septicaemia in its various forms can be

prevented by cleanliness and the use of movable aviaries, unless perhaps
in cases where the whole area has been infected by the release of large
numbers of diseased birds from a dealer's store. Tuberculosis can also
be kept down by the same precautions coupled with generous feeding
and the disinfection of the ground by dressings of salt. There are,
however, one or two highly susceptible species of birds which one cannot
count on keeping free of the scourge for a reasonable period even when
great care is taken. Enteritis has many forms : usually it is a chill
ailment, and can be, to a great extent, prevented by not exposing birds
to a greater degree of cold and wet than they are able to bear with
comfort. There are, however, kinds of enteritis which in certain districts
attack certain species of birds with a frequency and virulence which
renders the keeping of those birds a well-nigh hopeless task. But
undoubtedly far and away the worst microbe enemy one has to contend
with is that causing pneumonia. In the existing state of our knowledge,
its attacks, to a very great extent, can be neither prevented nor cured.
It is not kept away by cleanliness and disinfectants ; it destroys both
young birds in sheltered nests and adults in perfect health and
plumage ; it is far more active in the warm months of the year than in
the cold ones and it is not even discouraged by hot sunshine and a long
spell of drought. Locally it can be very severe and render the keeping
of quite a number of desirable and ordinarily hardy birds a troublesome
or even hopeless business. " Pneumonia districts " are not necessarily
large : one place may be very bad and another, not more than a dozen
miles away, comparatively safe. Neither does there seem to be much
connexion between the prevalence of pneumonia and the severity
of the climate : just as pneumonia is worse in fine, warm weather than
during the frost and wet of winter, so the mildest and most southerly
localities may be far more deadly than the bleaker and colder north.
In conclusion I should like to emphasize the tremendous importance to
the aviculturist of proper post-mortem examination of all birds that
have not been killed by quite obvious accident or violence. Without it
he is working more or less in the dark, for I have not the slightest
hesitation in saying that the most experienced people living will be
wrong in quite half their diagnoses of the complaints of birds found
dead or ailing. If a person finds that he is losing many birds from

enteritis, it is an indication that lie needs to provide more warmth and
shelter. If the birds die even in cosy quarters, he had better give up the
species that furnish regular casualties and confine himself to something
hardier. Of course, enteritis is sometimes due to poison, usually mineral,
for birds are very resistant to vegetable poisons and fairly discreet
about avoiding plants that would harm them ; in poisoning cases the
nature of the trouble is usually apparent to the expert who examines
the bodies. If birds are lost from tuberculosis, septicaemia, or
aspergillosis and from some diseases of the heart, the need is indicated
of movable aviaries and disinfection of soil, shelters, and cages. If
space is limited, concentration on hardier species and the abandonment
of the more delicate ones is again the only policy. If fatty degeneration
of the internal organs is reported, the remedy is, of course, plainer
and more suitable feeding and more opportunity for exercise, while
frequent reports of pneumonia announce the unwelcome news that the
aviculturist is living in an unhealthy district and may have to abandon
one and perhaps several species that he may have kept successfully in
the past in another locality.

By the Editor
One of the clauses in the new Wild Birds Protection Act provides
that " it shall not be lawful for any person without the leave of the
Secretary of State knowingly to liberate imported birds of any species ",
which means that a certain branch of aviculture becomes illegal.
One of the most attractive branches of aviculture, indulged in by
few, has been the liberation of certain tropical species which have
remained in the neighbourhood and bred under natural conditions,
returning at frequent intervals to their aviaries for food and shelter.
Under such conditions, several species have lived well, and we have
never heard of their doing any harm or increasing to the extent of
becoming a nuisance to the community.
If a species is introduced from a tropical to a temperate climate
it cannot survive for any length of time without a certain amount of

protection during the winter, and hence its increase can readily be
checked; but because some ill-advised persons thought fit to intro-
duce a hardy European species such as the Little Owl, every other
foreign species that we in this country would wish to study in life is
condemned to strict captivity ; unless it shall please the Secretary of
State to allow it to fly round our gardens.
But we cannot forget that the introduction of species both of
birds and mammals to countries other than their own has done untold
harm in many cases, and so we cannot be surprised at the insertion of
the above clause, though what it has to do with wild bird protection is
not altogether clear.
But we believe that wherever harm has been done it has been because
the introduced species has been moved to a climate or other conditions
more favourable to its existence than it enjoyed in its native habitat.
An event of considerable avicultural interest is that of the successful
breeding during the past summer of the Eed-breasted Goose at Woburn.
For the past fourteen years a small flock of these rare and handsome
Geese has enjoyed semi-freedom without the least attempts to reproduce
their species, but this year one disappeared from the flock and was later
discovered sitting upon a clutch of eggs which were taken and hatched
under a hen.
Another very interesting achievement has been the successful
rearing of a brood of Boulroul Partridges in Mr. Whitley's collection at
Paignton. We believe this is the first time the species has been reared
in Europe, though a young bird was once hatched in the late
Sir William Ingram's aviary at Monte Carlo.
The Boulroul is a bird of the dense jungle, and is not likely to
attempt to breed unless kept in an aviary very densely stocked with
growing shrubs and undergrowth, a miniature jungle, in fact.
Mr. Whitley has been breeding Glossy Starlings for some few
years past, and has bred them again this year. There has been some
uncertainty as to the species. They are certainly some species of
Lamprocolius and probably chalybeus.

Officers for 1927
A very interesting hybrid has been reared in the Primley aviaries,
between Burchell's Starling Lamprocolius australis and the Red-winged
Starling Amydrus morio, two very distinct species.
An important discovery with regard to Rollers has been made by
Mr. Whitley. He had several specimens of Lort's Roller ( Coracias lorti)
and these have gradually changed colour and become identical with
specimens of Coracias caudatus, proving that the former is merely one
phase, of plumage of the latter, and that the name C. lorti must in
future be regarded as a synonym of C. caudatus. It is only by keeping
birds in captivity and carefully observing them that such discoveries
can be made.

Sir,-- It may interest some of the members of the Avicultural
Society to hear of the breeding of the Prince Lucian Conure (Pyrrhura
luciani), but unfortunately the young died at the age of one week
The hen laid four eggs, after an incubation of twenty-one days two
were hatched and two dead in shell, and all eggs were fertile ; the hen
sat the whole time during incubation, but made no attempt to feed
the young after hatching. When found dead, their crops were quite
empty, and do not appear to have been fed from the time of hatching.
I should be very interested to know through your valuable
Magazine if there is any record of the Prince Lucian Conure having
been bred and reared.
Francis R. Child.
[In the article on Conures and their Allies, by Messrs. Delacour
and Berlioz, which appeared in our July number, the authors refer to
this species as being " common in captivity and easily reared ". We
believe, however, that in England at any rate it is extremely rare.

walls, each being screened with a 2 ft. square board hung from the
ceiling in front of it.
On 27th May, having turfed the flight and made a long-shaped
curved mound, like a golf bunker at one end, I opened the door and
out they went. Under the excitement of a larger and better world
some of them forgot their eggs in the boxes, and these birds were among
that number, as I later found a solitary egg of theirs in the shell of
a large coconut. On 17th June I discovered an open nest built of grass
stems alone, in a little recess on the ground among the grass half-way
up the side of the mound with two eggs in it. The hen laid two more.
The eggs are about the size of those of the Canary, white covered with
small dull red spots, some of them at the thicker end uniting to form
blotches. By 3rd July there were three young birds several days old;
one died later. On 9th July the most forward of the two left the
nest, before it could ify ; the next day the other, only half feathered,
climbed out on to the top of the mound, where I found it sunning
itself and looking about at everything that attracted its attention,
opening a large orange-yellow throat expecting food when any other
bird came near. This second bird was drowned a few days later.
I had stupidly supplied a bathing dish with steep sides, quite forgetting
about the young birds : now, I have made a shallow pond.
The young bird is now much like its mother, except that the under
parts are greyish white with a faint tinge of green ; the throat is
streaked with dark brown, which does not appear in the adults ; bill,
horn ; legs and toes, flesh coloured.
In a previous note I described the birds with yellow throat and
under parts. In the cock bird this is really green like the rump, but
that shade which looks yellow in the sunshine. The hen is much duller,
with the upper part of the breast brown. Now they have eggs again
in a nest built a few inches off the ground in the middle of a clump
of ornamental grass called Ribbon Grass by nurserymen. This nest
is much deeper than the last.

and the accompanying plate gives a very good idea of the shape,
attitude, and colour of this bird. My specimens are still in robust health
and are quite tame, but so far have not shown any signs of breeding.
This may be on account of my aviaries, which do not afford the birds
sufficiently natural conditions. They went through last winter safely,
being shut into a warm place at nights, and let out all day, except
when the pond was frozen. I feel certain that under more natural
conditions they would breed without great difficulty, and I hope this
will be accomplished in the near future.

In the spring of 1925 I obtained three or four pairs of this charming

weeks, gave them their liberty. They had grown accustomed to entering

to feed. There are two ways of feeding Waxbills at liberty if you do
not wish to have the bother of trapping the all-devouring Sparrow
on an open feeding-tray. Either you can train your birds to feed
inside a closed shelter and enter it by a small opening : as the food is
not visible from the outside, wild birds will not discover it. Or you
can put the seed tray in the open and put over it a sort of dish cover
arrangement made of wire netting of a mesh that will admit Waxbills
but exclude Sparrows. (Large birds, such as Pigeons or Parrots, can
be trained by gradual stages in an aviary before release to feed inside
a kind of box where the food dish is out of sight of the entrance hole.
The box must be placed on the wire roof of an aviary flight and must
have no bottom. Light will then enter it from below and prevent the
feeding dish from being too much in the dark, but wild birds will be
unable to enter it from below as they would ultimately learn to do if
they could get directly underneath it.)
The Lavender Finches stayed about quite well, and in late August
I noticed a young one on the feeding tray. It looked rather rough,
and the weather becoming vilely cold and wet, I did not see it again.
Four old birds remained at the beginning of winter, and of these three
survived until the following spring. They were given their liberty on
all but the very worst days and were shut up in the warmed shelter
each night by the simple device of putting, each afternoon, an inward-
pointing funnel of wire netting in the entrance hole of the shelter
and feeding place. Birds going in to feed were unable to find their
way out again until released on the following morning by the removal
of the funnel. Visitors were sometimes not a little surprised to see quite
a cloud of Waxbills and Grassfinches dart from the aviary when let
out after breakfast and could hardly believe that every one of the
little birds would find its way safe home again by the evening.
In early summer I bought three or four more Lavender Finches
to bring the flock up to about eight. I often saw them about, but it
was not till fairly late in September that I noticed a Lavender Finch
that did not seem to know its way out of the aviary flight which it
had entered to feed. I knew at once that it must be a young one, and
the glasses showed this to be the case. It was a much stronger bird
than that of the previous year, and I discovered later that it was one

of a nice brood of four, all of which have done well and can now hardly
be distinguished from their parents. I have often been surprised at the
amount of cold that very late broods of Waxbills can stand, and the
rapidity with which they grow to maturity in the chilly, shortening
days of autumn. The first Cordon Bleus I ever bred left the nest in
October in a deluge of cold rain followed by a hard frost and a biting
wind. Yet they did not seem to mind a bit.
The Lavender Finch is certainly to be recommended to anyone
who likes to try a few of the commoner small foreign birds at liberty.
It is, if in good plumage, not more difficult to acclimatize than other
Waxbills. It is a good stayer, is extremely beautiful, and shows itself
a lot. Unlike the Firefinch and common Waxbill it seldom gets
egg-bound through absurd efforts to breed in February and March.
A highly insectivorous species, it will " work " your rose-trees for
aphis with all the grace and efficiency of a Blue Tit and unlike the latter
bird will not proceed to undo the merit of good deeds by destroying
your green peas and pecking holes in all your choicest pears and apples.
In conclusion, I ought perhaps to add that if Waxbills are fed only
inside a shelter it is sometimes necessary to give young birds a little help
in finding the seed by fixing small dishes of millet just inside and just
outside the entrance hole. As soon as they feed freely on the outside
dish it can be taken away and the inside one alone be left. Then, when
they pass freely through the hole, the inside dish also can be dispensed
with. A little care and judgment is needed, for if the outside seed dish
is too large and conspicuous and is left too long, you will find that you
are training Sparrows as well as baby Waxbills--a most undesirable

Among the birds I have bred in the aviaries this year is the Golden-

They laid three eggs and hatched one young one, the other two eggs
being unfertile. This year they took to the same box as last year, laid

two eggs about the end of April, but as they are rather shy birds I
never went anywhere near the box, so as not to disturb them. I looked
in the box in June, quite the beginning, and saw there one young bird
and one bad egg. The youngster was covered entirely with grey down,
and it seemed to remain in that condition for a long time, and I felt
rather nervous as to whether it would ever grow any feathers ; but in
July it started, and left the nest about the 20th August. It exactly
resembles its parents in plumage, and was quite difficult to distinguish
from the old birds, except that the colouring in the old birds is rather
more opaque and the young bird has a little more of a bluish sheen on it.
I have kept the old birds outside winter and summer for three years,
and they are really beautiful, and do not seem to mind the cold in the
least. I think this is the first time this bird has been bred in captivity.
This may interest our members. Last year I bred hybrids (from
Adelaide cock and Pennant hen). There were three young birds : one
(I believed to be a cock) I gave to the Zoological Society. The other two
I kept ; they were out all winter. I believe the two I kept were a cock
and hen, but I kept them with an Adelaide cock, an odd bird I had,
and to my surprise this young hen hybrid paired with the Adelaide
and laid six eggs. Although she was not in her adult plumage she
incubated the eggs, and three hatched ; but unfortunately they died
at four or five days old, the reason being, I think, my wife gave a large
garden party to all the village, over a hundred people being present.
This so upset the birds that the hen hybrid would not brood the young
for some hours and they died. But I shall try again next year with the
pair of hybrids, and shall hope for better luck.

I was very much surprised on looking through Dr. Hopkinson's
new book to find that there is no record of the breeding of this bird
in England. As it is quite often imported it is possible, of course,
that it has been bred and the breeder has not thought it worth while
to record the event.

Under the circumstances the following short account of my birds
may be of interest. Early in 1925 I turned a pair into a medium-sized
aviary containing a number of other birds, the largest of which were
a pair of South American Thrushes. At the end of May the hen built
a small cup-shaped nest in the privet bush and laid four eggs, white,
sparsely spotted with reddish brown. Ten days later four young ones
were hatched. These did well, and when I went for my annual holiday
were well feathered ; but on my return I could find no sign of them,
so conclude that they must have been killed by the Thrushes. This
spring I put the pair into an aviary, where except for a pair of Peacock
Pheasants they were the largest birds. They went to nest in June
in a creeper, and on 4th July three young ones left the nest. These
were coloured like their mother, but three weeks later were beginning
to show some of the bright colours of the male bird. On 15th July
these birds were again sitting, this time in the top of a small conifer.
Four young ones were reared from this nest, and at the time of writing
the males are nearly in full colour. The St. Helena Seed-eater is a good
aviary bird. The cock is handsome and a good singer, and they are not
quarrelsome with other birds. Habitat: South Africa.

By the Marquess of Tavistock and M. Delacour
We will now consider those Parrots, which are usually placed in
two groups, Pioninoe and Psittacince, but which we shall find it more
convenient to study together.
They are perfect as cage birds and are considered the best talkers,
but they live just as well in an aviary.
The Grey Parrot (Psittacus erythacus) is well known to be an
unrivalled talker, and it is only by accident that one occasionaly meets
with a female without any aptitude for talking.
Everybody knows the Grey Parrot with its ashy grey plumage
and red tail. It is a native of Equatorial Africa. An acclimatized
Grey quickly adapts himself to captivity, but newly arrived specimens
have a bad reputation for delicacy, due sometimes to their liability to
chills, but more often to infectious diseases contracted on the voyage

in dirty and crowded cages. A Grey Parrot's cage should be large
enough for it to be able to spread its wings. The swing, with which
most Parrot cages are furnished, should be removed, as well as the
grating at the bottom of the cage, both being useless. The tray should
be filled with a thick layer of sand and grit. A piece of wood or a
small branch of a non-poisonous tree should be given so that the bird
can gnaw it and amuse itself ; also a bath, which must be easy to get
into and too heavy to be upset. Grey Parrots do not often bathe,
but like an occasional wash, and cannot keep their plumage in really
good condition if they are deprived of it.
Their seed mixture should consist of two parts canary, one part
millet, one hemp and one sunflower, with monkey nuts and fruit. A
little piece of cake does them no harm now and again for a treat, but
tea, coffee, cream, milk, meat or butter should never be given. Young,
freshly imported birds often require maize boiled daily until they begin
to eat seed, but the maize should be withheld as soon as they can do
without it. Bread and milk is sometimes good for a sick Parrot, but
is bad for those in health.
Grey Parrots when caged must be kept out of draughts and not
exposed to sudden changes to temperature, although when they are
really acclimatized they can stand cold well; I have a very fine
specimen which seems perfectly happy in an outside aviary on a cold
winter's day.
The young often give vent to a disagreeable cry, but it is due to
fear and is abandoned as the birds grow older and tamer. An adult
Grey, unlike an Amazon, never screeches when it is full grown, although
it may whistle shrilly from time to time.
Hen birds often lay in captivity, but it is rare for young to be reared,
probably because Grey Parrots are not often encouraged to nest in
confinement; also it is only very rarely that cocks are brought over.
Individuals having white or red patches in their plumage are not
uncommon, and wholly white and wholly pink specimens with red
tails have been imported. Albino Parrots, of any species, are usually
females.
Although slow and deliberate in their movements, Grey Parrots
show much intelligence, and there is no doubt that some understand

the meaning of certain words which they have been taught. Most
of them become devoted to one person only, and are spiteful to others,
but some are gentle even with strangers. Unlike Amazons, they are
never guilty of biting those whom they really love.
The Grey Parrot has been bred at liberty in England.
The Timneh Parrot (P. timneh) from West Africa is darker grey
and has a brown tail; it is imported now and then, but is said not to be
as good a talker as the Grey.
The curious Parrots known as Yasas come from Madagascar and
the neighbouring islands. They do not attract one by their beauty
but make affectionate and amusing companions.
The Greater Vasa ( Coracopsis vasa) is brownish black, the wings,
lower back, and tail being dark grey ; the sexes are alike in colour,
but there may be a difference is size. It is a hardy species in the sense
that it is easily fed, little subject to illness, is long lived in an aviary
or a cage, and once acclimatized can winter in the open air. On the
other hand, if a Yasa does fall ill, even from a slight cause such as a
cold or shortage of food for one day, all treatment usually fails and the
bird dies in spite of every attention.
When it becomes tame the Yasa often has considerable talent
as a talker and mimic, and shows great affection for its owners, but
it is sometimes noisy. Yasas should be fed on canary, hemp, sunflower,
monkey nuts and fruit. It is a native of Madagascar.
The Lesser Vasa (C. nigra), also from Madagascar, differs from
the last mentioned in being much smaller. I had one which was the
most charming and affectionate bird that I ever owned. It should
be treated like the Greater Vasa.
It is a species which, though not delicate, offers only a poor resistance
to illness.
The Comoro Yasa ( C . comorensis) resembles the Great Yasa, but
is not quite so dark in colour.
C. sibilans, a smaller species, also occurs on the Comoro Islands.
The Praslin Parrot (C. barJcleyi), from the Seychelles, is another
small and rarely imported species.
The genus Posocephalus contains small or medium-sized African
Parrots, with short tails and large heads. They are prettily coloured,

and once domesticated become charming companions, and learn to
say a few words. They are related to the Amazons and other American
Parrots, and require the same treatment whether in a cage, aviary,
or at liberty, as the Grey Parrot.
The Senegal Parrot (P. senegalensis), well known by the name
of " You-You ", is freely imported. It is a favourite with many
amateurs, because it is intelligent and amusing, its chief fault being a
shrill cry and a tendency to bite in play ; some individuals, however,
are always gentle. It is a little green Parrot, with head and neck grey
and belly orange yellow. The male has a larger and thicker head
and beak, and a darker grey mantle, with less green. So far as I know
it has not been reared in captivity, although it has shown some inclina-
tion to nest.
Specimens in good condition can pass the winter in the open ; they
are fond of bathing. They inhabit Senegambia.
Meyer's Parrot (P. meyeri), from N.W. Africa, is a pretty little
Parrot much like the preceding. It should have the same treatment,
but it will not live long unless given more roomy quarters than an
ordinary cage.
The Yellow-fronted Parrot (P. flavifrons), from Abyssinia, is
different shades of green with the top of the head and the face yellow.
It is rarely imported.
The Red-bellied Parrot (P. rufiventris), from E. Africa, is brown,
with green rump and belly, and red on the breast and under the wings.
A few have come over latterly. The female has no red.
Ruppell's Parrot (P. ruppelli), from S.W. Africa, is brown with
thighs and under side of the wings yellow ; the hen is a bluish green
on the lower back, rump and under the tail, being thus brighter than
the male.
The Brown-headed Parrot (P. fuscicapillis), from S.E. Africa, is
green with a brown head, grey cheeks and yellow under the wings.
Jardine's Parrot (P. gulielimi), from W. Africa, is green with
the crown of the head, the fold of the wings, and thighs orange, the
lores and upper part of the back black, as well as the lower parts and
small wing-coverts. It is larger than any of the others.
Levaillant's Parrot (P. robustus) is still larger with a very big
beak ; it has dull colouring, a mixture of brown and green, occasionally

a red band on the forehead and fold of the wings. It is a native of
S. Africa.
The Brown-necked Parrot (P. fuscicollis ), from 8. Africa, only
differs in having the head and neck silvery grey.
All these species, excepting the first two, have been very rarely
imported.
Although it inhabits New Guinea, we will here include Pesquet's
Parrot (Dasyptilus pesqueti), which is related to the Grey Parrot.
This curious bird, so different to other Parrots, is very large ; its beak
is long and narrow like a Vulture's ; it is dark brown, with the under
parts, part of the wings, and the rump bright carmine red. Male birds
have a little red on the head which the females lack.
Pesquet's Parrot is almost unknown as a cage bird, and there is
much need of information from owners of any actually living in
captivity. I had a female for two or three years ; she moulted and did
fairly well on bananas, Savoy biscuits and prepared milk food (Dr.
Allinson's food) mixed as for a baby. At times, however, she had
digestive trouble, which showed that this diet was not ideal. The
person to whom I eventually gave her found her to be fond of bread
and milk and raw eggs, and she lived some time longer with these
additions to her diet, but always refused seed. Fruit by itself did not
nourish her sufficiently. She was very susceptible to cold, and could
not live out of doors in bad weather even in summer, but she liked
rain to wet her feathers.
My Pesquet's Parrot did not appear spiteful to other birds, and
though she threatened those who approached her I think it was from
fear. A Budgerigar which had the audacity to attack her had no reason
to repent of its boldness, though it was not much bigger than the beak
of its enemy.
Pesquet's Parrot has a terrible voice and uses it freely. Its cries
remind one of a combination of a Black Cockatoo, a Klaxon horn,
and a rattle.
My bird had much character and intelligence, and was very
sensitive. . If she was sent to a new place she became morose and
unhappy and refused food for some days ; she was very much attached
to the person who fed her, and allowed herself to be handled, but
she did not like strangers.

Last summer I obtained three specimens of this rare South American
Parrakeet and later a fourth, which, however, proved an unfortunate
investment; soon after arrival it developed a persistent " wheeze ",
which no treatment would cure, and finally it started to have fits, one
of which proved fatal. On examining the body we were surprised to
find a deep hole in the back of the skull, clearly an old injury. How on
earth the bird managed to survive several months with such a wound
and retain a healthy appetite I cannot imagine.

A. Decoux--Breeding the Brown-headed Firefinch in France 335
The three seemed to be quite young, judging by the presence of some
green feathers on the cheeks. They were rather exhausted by their
journey, and had one or two slight illnesses before they began to do well;
one had also plucked itself on the voyage, but it seems to have
abandoned the habit now that it has good food and plenty of amuse-
ment. As one bird has a longer and more powerful head than its com-
panions, I am hoping that both sexes are represented. Two of the
Conures have now pretty well completed their moult, and are a beautiful
rich golden yellow all over except for the dark green wing feathers.
The three are on very good terms with one another, but the cock (?)
has been influenced by the modern female fashion of " bobbing ", for
some weeks ago he bit off the tail of one of his companions. Apparently
decided that it suited her, he proceeded to deal with the other in the same
way. He seems satisfied with the arrangement, for he has not
mutilated their plumage since, nor has he shorn off his own caudal
appendage ! The Queen of Bavarias are typical Conures. They have the
piercing voices of their genus and the same playful ways and destructive
habits. I keep them at present in a large cage, some feet in length, and
see that they are supplied with plenty of branches, which they enjoy
reducing to fragments. They have very large appetites, eating all kinds
of seeds, nuts, apple, and greenstuff.

Waxbills, which had just arrived from Abyssinia. For some weeks
I kept them indoors, in one of my bird-rooms. They seemed rather
more delicate than the Common Firefinches, and I lost some from chills
or bronchitis, for the temperature was then rather low. At the end of
July there were only seven of them left, two adult cocks, a young one
beginning to assume the adult plumage, and four hens. I turned out
the cocks and three hens into a small outdoor aviary, thickly planted
and with a comfortable shelter attached to it. We had put up some

pine-branches against the shelter walls and on 4th September I found a
typical spherical nest. It stood at about 2 feet from the ground, was
made of hay and feathers and had two entrance holes, instead of one
like the ordinary Firefinch's nest. This is perhaps a proof of a more
cautious and timid character, for the second hole is evidently used to
take flight if some enemy should approach the other. Every time one
of the Firefinches entered the nest it shut the entrance hole with a
feather, so that the nest appeared completely closed. It contained an
egg absolutely like the common Firefinch's and two or three young
ones, one or two days' old. They were fed by both parents with live
insects, chiefly small ants and their eggs, the seeds of flowering grass, and
also with regurgitated white millet.
Two young left the nest on 22nd September, about three weeks old.
They resembled the young L. senegala, though a little darker. The bill
was black, with the three small warts, two white and one blue, at the
base of the bill, characteristic of the young Senegal Firefinch. About
ten days after leaving the nest they were independent of their parents.
In early October the hen repaired the old nest and laid again, but
the birds were frightened out of it by a pair of Superb Tanagers, and left
their eggs.
This species had not been previously bred in France, but it had been
last year in Germany. Herr Karl Nurnzig, the editor of Die Gejiedert
Welt, wrote me that a pair reared seven young ones in two broods in
his son's aviary.

The hybrid Alexandra X Crimson-winged Parrakeet I described some
time ago has recently completed his first moult. I am inclined to
think he is now in adult plumage for, although a Crimson-wing is said
to take two or three years to get his full colour, the hybrid has shown
himself so exceptionally forward that he is probably by now mature
in every respect. He started to display long before he was a year old,
and this spring mated with a hen King. Eggs were laid but were

broken, so I cannot say if any were fertile. The hybrid is now a pretty
and graceful though not a gaudy bird. His tail has become much
longer, bright green above, black underneath, all except the two longest
feathers (which are only very slightly tipped with yellowish pink)
having a wide pink edging. The head is bright, pale green ; mantle
rather darker and more olive green ; flights, olive green; rump,
bright blue ; throat, salmon colour ; breast, pale green shot with bluish
mother-of-pearl: a good many of the breast feathers are partly crimson
at the sides and near the base. On each wing is a large patch of pale
greenish yellow, bordered on the lower edge with crimson. Under
the wings are many crimson feathers and there are a few of the same
colour over the ribs. The thighs are a mixture of pale green, pale blue,
and crimson, each individual feather often showing two colours. It is
rather remarkable that the hybrid should show crimson on the breast
where this colour occurs in neither parent. It will be remembered
that Mr. Astley's Barraband Alexandra had a wholly red breast.
In disposition the hybrid takes after his father rather than his
Crimson-wing mother. He is friendly and very lively, displaying
even when in full moult. He is also inclined to be a mimic and imitates
the calls of Bingnecks, Rock Peplars, and Barrabands. His own
call is intermediate between that of his parents, as is his display.
Although he has spent practically all his life in a large outdoor aviary
and no special effort has been made to tame him, he will fly towards
me if I speak to him, come quite close and show obvious pleasure
and excitement at being noticed. A curiously pronounced inclination
to make friends with man from entirely unselfish motives is
characteristic of the Alexandra Parrakeet as a species. No Parrakeet
is so easily and quickly tamed, and, like the Banksian Cockatoo, it
comes to you, not for the food you may give it, nor in order to be stroked
(for it dislikes any form of handling), but just because it likes to be
talked to. What conceivable enjoyment a bird, with all its natural
wants, including a mate, already supplied, can derive from an exchange
with a human being of expressions of mutual esteem and goodwill,
I am wholly unable to guess, but the fact remains !

The collection in the Small Bird House at the Zoological Gardens
has been enriched by the very generous gift from Mr. Spedan Lewis
of three male Birds of Paradise, namely a Wallace's Standard Wing,
a Greater, and a King, besides some Three-coloured Parrot-Einches
and a Sclater's Crowned Pigeon.
Wallace's Standard Wing has not previously been seen alive in
Europe. It is one of those rarieties which the late Dr. Alfred Bussell
Wallace discovered during one of his memorable journeys in the fifties.
He found it on the island of Batchian, in the Moluccas, and it was after-
wards found on Halmahera. The Halmahera bird has been separated
as distinct by Salvador], though the distinctive features are somewhat
vague.
It is a strange looking bird, brown in colour, with the breast covered
with a large shield of bright green, the sides of the shield being produced
into two long tufts reaching down each side as far as the thighs. From
the wing coverts spring two long whitish plumes, which end in an
elongate spatula.
The collection in the Small Bird House is a very fine one now. No
less than eight species of Paradise Birds are represented, namely
Greater, Baggis, Prince Budolph's, Hunstein's Magnificent, King,
Wallace's, Lesser Superb, and Princess Stephanie's, and almost all are
in full adult plumage.
The display of the Lesser Superb bird is a wonderful sight, which
may be witnessed almost any day, the best time to see it being the
morning. The hood of soft blackish feathers which grows from the nape,
and is generally carried resting on the back, is, during the display,
expanded and thrown out on either side in front of the body, and,
forming a dark screen, showing off to perfection the vivid green shield
which grows on the breast; at the same time the metallic bluish-green

feathers on the top of the head show up as two vivid spots, being divided
by the upraised bill and tuft of black bristles above it.
Dr. Karl Neunzig, editor of Die Gefiedert Welt , is doing some valuable
scientific, work on nestling birds, and would be very grateful if English
aviculturists would send him dead specimens of nestling Grassfinches,
Mannikins, Waxbills, Whydahs, or Weavers. His address is Neue
Bismarckstrasse 42, Berlin-Hermsdorf, Germany.
The October number of the Emu contains much interesting matter,
and an article that will especially appeal to aviculturists describes the
successful breeding in captivitjr of the Boobook Owl. The author,
Mr. David H. Fleay, of Ballarat, Victoria, kept no less than five of these
owls together in an aviary and a pair of them mated and the hen
successfuly hatched two chicks. Instead of the other three Owls proving
troublesome, they proved of great assistance in the rearing of the
young Owls. A series of very excellent photographs showing young and
adult birds accompanies the paper.
Another note of interest to aviculturists gives the history of a tame
" Currawong 53 or Pied Crow-Shrike ( Strepera graculina). It had been
reared from a fledgling and became a pet of the household. He was a
cunning, quaint, and delightful bird, on the best of terms with the home
folks, but rather suspicious of strangers.
In the same number our old friend, Mr. G. A. Heumann, writes on
" Mistletoe Birds as Plant Distributors 33 . He describes the tiny and
beautiful Dicceum hirundinaceum, which he has constantly observed
in the wild state and often kept in captivity. In 1912 he sent a pair to
the London Zoological Gardens, where they lived well for some years.
He tells us that as an aviary bird this is all that could be desired, an
exceptionally good liver, very tame, and beautifully marked ; its only
disadvantage when kept in Australia is that it attracts the wild birds
of its kind, which distribute the mistletoe-seeds amongst his fruit-trees.

The recent stormy weather has driven a good many birds out of
their normal environment. A Puffin was discovered on the roof of
a house in Hampstead and sent to the Zoological Gardens, while reports
were received of another one in North London. At least five Snowy
Owls have settled on ships in the Atlantic and been brought safely
home, four of them finding their way to the Zoo.

With the publication of the fourth volume of this book a work of
great value to bird students is completed, a work which, in spite of
its very moderate price, contains no less than 192 coloured plates by an
artist unsurpassed in the faithful delineation of birds. Although this
is called a new edition, it is really a new work, the whole of the coloured
plates being new and specially drawn for this edition. The letterpress
has been re-written, and the number of coloured plates is more
than double that of the first edition.
Volume IV deals with the Orders Limicolce, Gavice, Alcce , Pygopodes,
and Tubinares. Perhaps there is no more puzzling group of birds
than the Sandpipers, and it is a great help to those wishing to identify
them to have accurate coloured plates of all that, or more than are even
likely to be met with. Or take the Gulls. How many of us, when staying
at the seaside, have been doubtful of the species of some of the Gulls
that we have met with. The difference, for instance, between the
Common Gull and the Kittiwake is sometimes puzzling unless one
carries in one's head the distinguishing features. For our own part,
and we commend the practice to all bird-lovers, we always make a list
of the birds met with on a holiday, and we find it adds immensely
to one's pleasure, and on these occasions a book such as Thorburn's
will prove invaluable. Descriptions, however accurate, are un-
satisfactory. One cannot picture the bird in one's mind from a

RECORDS OF BIRDS BRED IN CAPTIVITY 1

Aviculturists will be pleased to hear of the appearance of Dr.
Hopkinson&amp;apos;s book, for every one of them must plead guilty to the desire
to breed some species for the first time in captivity, and to be the one
to claim the record. But it is not always easy to find out whether a
bird has or has not been bred before without wading through a great
deal of literature, and we must all be very grateful to Dr. Hopkinson
for the immense amount of trouble he has taken to tabulate the existing
records in easily accessible form. It was not an easy task, and we know
of no one so well qualified to take it on. It is surely a book that every
aviculturist will wish to have by him for reference.
The number of species of which there are breeding records is no
less than 816, though these are not all British, and these form the first
part of the book, - the second being devoted to hybrids, of which there
are a very large number. Part three consists of a summary of the whole,
in which an attempt is made to indicate the comparative value of the
records by the use of different kinds of type.
To trace every exisiting record is a very difficult task-, and it would
indeed be extraordinary if none had&amp;apos;been missed. The author frankly
admits that there must be many sources of information that he has
been unable to tap, and many unrecorded successes of which he is
ignorant. His book should bring to light these sources, and any missed
records will be incorporated in a future edition.
Of the Snowy Owl (page 118) the author could -find nothing
more than a record of incomplete success ", yet if he will refer to Vol. V
of the Avicultural Magazine (first series) he will find at pages 72
and 182 Mr. St. Quentin&amp;apos;s account of the successful breeding of this
species on two occasions.

The name of the Common Crane is printed in italics (page 304),
indicating a doubtful record,.but there is no doubt that a chick was
hatched at the London Zoo on 23rd June, 1863, and it lived for
twenty-seven years ! But some such slight discrepancies as these are
inevitable in a first edition of a work of this kind, and we heartily

Sir, --All bird-keepers should obtain a copy of Records of Birds Bred
in Captivity, by Emilius Hopkinson, C.M.G., D.S.O., M.A., M.B.,
B.Ch. (Oxon), E.Z.S., M.B.O.U., just published by Messrs. Witherby,
High Holborn, London. Dr. Hopkinson, the well-known expert, gives
most valuable and interesting information on subjects he is so well
informed on. The book is cheap, only 15s.
Part II on Hybrids, English and Foreign, is most valuable. Mr. Lee
S. Candall, of New York, is quoted for most of the American records.
M. Jean Delacour, the great French aviculturist, and Mr. Hugh Wormald,
of Norfolk, give valuable notes on Ducks.
All the English species bred in confinement are mentioned, and the
hybrids. Foreign hybrids bred are numerous, and aviculturists
who desire to go in for this fascinating hobby would do well to study
the book. I notice in the book Neunzig says : " Breeding Diamond
Sparrows is not easy, and generally takes place only after some time
(often years) in captivity." I may say that I purchased a pair from
Mr. Chapman last September and they have built a nest in a sheltered
aviary already.
T. W. T. Miller.
A NEW WAXBILL
Sir, --At the October meeting of the B.O.C., Mr. Sclater exhibited
and described as Estrilda xanthopyga two specimens of a new Waxbill,
which had been obtained by M. Delacour from a Marseilles dealer and
were therefore believed to have come from West Africa.

I feel almost sure I saw a pair of the same bird at Mr. Whitley's last
year, and again this, when they were paired up in an aviary to them-
selves in hopes of breeding. If they are the same, West Africa as the
habitat has no greater claims than East, for Mr. Whitley's birds came,
I think, from Chapman's and were therefore more probably from the
east side of the Continent. They arrived at the same time, I believe,
as the first (or second) lot of Nyasa Lovebirds. Perhaps both the
Parrakeets and the Waxbills come from the same district, which
aviculturally appears to have been only just opened up.
The new birds are like Common Waxbills, except that where these
are pink (brow and rump), the new ones are tawny brown and have
yellow brown beaks. Those I saw in the Paignton aviaries in their
flight and ways to me suggested Orange-cheek rather than Common
Waxbills. May they long survive and may they reproduce, but when
their time does come, may they find an honoured resting place with
their prototypes !

Sir, --The plate of Mr. Ezra's beautiful blue Alexandrine Parrakeet
may make it worth putting on record that there was recently in the
Perth Zoological Cardens, Australia, a Yellow-collared Parrakeet
which was blue where the normal form is green, and white where the
normal form is yellow.
Mr. Le Souef also informs me that he has seen a yellow bird of the
same species with a white collar and about half a dozen lutino Rosellas,
and he has heard of Piping Crows with yellow areas in their plumage
in place of white.

have found them very good for Budgerigars, Rosellas, Lavender-headed

Mannikins, and Madagascar Weavers that did fairly well.

The aviaries consist of a shelter 18 in. wide open in front, made
of flooring boards with a roof sloping towards the front, running the
length of the aviary. The wire flight is 6 ft. long and 4 ft. wide.
There are three shelves in the shelter. The top one is divided by a
bit of wire netting to prevent quarrelsome birds from running along
the full length of it. Seed saucers and jars are on the other two.
A number of small branches are fixed about them for the birds to
sleep on. I get L-shaped twigs and nail them against the wall or the
front of the shelf, inverted or sloping if desired. Nesting boxes are
on the top shelf but raised an inch or so above it by slips of wood.

NESTING ATTEMPT BY THE ALLIED SALTATOK
Sir, -- I thought perhaps my experience with the Allied Saltator
(Solicitor similis) might be of interest to your readers. I purchased
two of these birds from Mr. Chapman last January and turned them
into my outdoor aviary. They got on well together and with seven
other species of Tanager, besides a mixed collection of other birds.
About the middle of May one of the birds got very busy building. This
was witnessed by my friend and neighbour, Mrs. W. Lewis, who
happened to call one day about this time. So far I had noticed no signs
of mating between the two. The nest was built of twigs and grass, etc.,
lined with wool and hair in a wooden box in a comer of a shelter over
which I had fixed a bough of spruce. On completion of the nest the
building " bird went for the other violently. I was out at the time
and only rescued it half-dead, and it died of shock during the day.
From this I conclude that they were both hens. The survivor then
started laying. She laid three eggs and then sat for two to three weeks
without result, of course. She then built another nest and produced
three eggs. And she repeated the process twice again during the
summer, making four nests in all. The eggs are of the colouring of a
Blackbird, though about half the size and considerably more pointed
at one end. I have kept one of the nests with its three eggs (blown)
and shall be pleased to send it to anyone who collects foreign
birds' eggs.

Sir,-- I thought it might possibly be of interest to other members
of the Avicultural Society to hear of the rather odd nesting site chosen
by a pair of Firefinches I have had at liberty during this summer.
Although they had an abundance of trees and shrubs of every kind to
choose from they elected to build their nest in a bundle of peasticks
which had been tied up and put with two similar bundles in a wheel-
barrow, in an open-fronted shelter adjoining a potting shed.
When the nest was completed, and while I was away for a few days,
one of the gardeners who had occasion to use the barrow removed the
bundle of peasticks containing the nest and laid it on the ground. He
was eventually told it contained the Firefinches' nest, and a few days
later replaced it in its original position in the barrow. The Firefinches,
nothing daunted, returned to their nest and laid four eggs, which they
are at present incubating. The site chosen for the nest is excellent
in that it is completely protected from the weather, but dangerous
in that the shelter is not altogether free from rats and mice.
If their nest is successful it will be the second time I have bred
Firefinches at liberty, as I was lucky enough to have a brood of four
young successfully reared two years ago, but in that case the site chosen
for the nest was a large low growing bush close to the aviary in which
they were fed. It is a noticeable feature with Firefinches at liberty
that whereas with most of the small Waxbills, etc., it is advisable to
keep them in the aviary from which they are going to be liberated
for at least a week or more, in order to get used to their surroundings,
Firefinches may be quite safely let out almost immediately, without
much fear of their straying.

THE EFFECT OF LOCALITY ON THE HEALTH OF BIRDS
Sir, --Since writing my article on the effect of locality on the health
of birds, I have had further striking proofs that it is often the prevalence
or comparative absence of injurious bacteria that is the most important
factor and not the weather, the temperature, nor the condition of the
bird. Last summer, on a hot, sunny day, I turned a Hooded Parrakeet
in excellent condition into an outdoor aviary. By the afternoon it was

seriously ill, and I only pulled it round with difficulty by keeping it in
the hospital at a very high temperature. Re'cently, now that the worst-
months for bacterial infection, according to my experience, are over,
I have been allowing the bird to fly in an outdoor aviary during the
daytime in all but the very worst weather. Although there is usually a
difference of about thirty degrees between the temperature of the outside
air and the hot room where it sleeps (where I have to maintain great
heat for invalids and delicate new arrivals), it has remained in excellent
health. This case is typical of a good many others.

Sir, --I read Mr. Sherriff's article on the breeding of Sibias in the
November number of the Magazine with great interest.
Mr. Sherriff asks whether anyone else has ever tried giving parent
birds their liberty when feeding young.
Our older members may remember that I bred the Great Tit and
Orchard Finch in 1915, the former were in a small aviary to themselves--
they were recently caught birds, and very wild until they hatched their
seven young, when both birds, but more especially the male, became
very confiding and tame.
This gave us the idea of giving the birds their liberty, which I did
by opening the feeding-door of the aviary. The cock immediately flew
out and disappeared--I thought for good, but he soon returned with a
mouthful of greenfly and fed the hen in the box.
Although there must have been plenty of insect food about he
persecuted me for mealworm, which both he, and later on the hen,
preferred to anything else. Oddly enough these birds also, like
Mr. Sherriff's Sibias, used to enter the house and help themselves to
cake, etc., even in the presence of numerous people. In 1916 my
Orchard Finches again showed signs of breeding, so I put them in the
aviary occupied the previous year by the Tits ; they built, laid, and
hatched, and when the young were two days old I again opened the
feeding door with quite satisfactory results. The cock again was the
tamer of the two parents. He must have had extraordinary powers
of vision, for he would often meet me in a field some 80 yards away

from his nest, and fly straight back with a couple of mealworms for his
young. I am not aware that he ever so greeted any stranger.
I also saw him more than once sitting on a telephone wire high above
the crowded High Street of Eton singing away and as oblivious of the
crowd below as they were of the presence of an American bird above.
In the case of both species, I usually closed the feeding door in the
evening, when I was sure both birds were home, and I kept it shut
for good when I judged that the young would shortly fly. It is possible
that the periodic captivity so imposed made the parents use some of the
artificial food and insects which I provided, and that the change of diet
when freedom was finally withheld did not produce the same effects
on the young as the sudden change in Mr. Sherriff's case from complete
freedom to captivity.
Some three years ago two pairs of Zebra Finches had their liberty
in my garden and reared a few young. The old birds had access to the
ordinary seeds which were placed in a trap cage. When I caught up the
two families in the autumn they were all placed in one aviary, and I
was much disappointed to lose all the young in from 24 to 36 &amp;apos;hours,
f can only presume that they had fed entirely on grass and weed seeds
and that the sudden change of diet caused their deaths.
It would certainly be wise if repeating such an experiment to prepare
a supply of soaked and sprouting seed before catching up the young.

Sir, ---It is, I think, commonly believed, and certainly commonly
stated, that the first living importation of Birds of Paradise to Europe
were the two Paradisea minor brought to the London Zoo in 1862. But
in Latham's General History of Birds , 1821-4, a much earlier case is
mentioned under P. apoda in a foot-note (vol. iii, p. 183) qualifying a
statement in the text that it is stated that they cannot be kept alive
by art The note reads as follows :--
" The late Mr. Pennant furnished us with an instance to the contrary
from Sir Joseph Banks ; one of them having been brought alive to

I have not seen the first edition of the Indian Zoology , hut in the
second, dated MDCCXC, we find that what Latham refers to is another
foot-note (by Pennant) saying :*--
" Sir Joseph Banks did me the favour of communicating the
drawing of the Common Bird of Paradise brought alive to England.
T. P. 55
This foot-note refers to an account of Paradise Birds given in an
Essay on India by J. R. Forster, which forms part of the volume.
Not very much perhaps to go on, but such definite statements by
two of the authorities of the time must mean something. Is the drawing
mentioned known, or is there other reference in the literature to this
important event ? A " first arrival 55 is always noted with interest
by present-day aviculturists, and an early " firstlike this should be
of special importance. I therefore hope that further details are known
and will be forthcoming.
