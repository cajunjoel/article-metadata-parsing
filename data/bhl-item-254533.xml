AN INTERESTING WOODPECKER FROM CUBA
By Jiri Felix
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.973204" page_id="56365620"  page_num="" year="" vol="">
(Zoological Gardens, Prague, Czechoslovakia)
In the beginning of September, 1963, the Prague Zoological Gardens
received a lot of Cuban birds as a present from the Havana Zoo.
Among them in a large travelling cage were eight Black-browed
Woodpeckers --Centurus superciliaris superciliaris (Temminck). One of them
died during the journey, but the others--four males and three females--
were all in very good condition and only their feathers were a bit wet
and dirty.
The Black-browed Woodpecker is very prettily coloured. The back
and the wing-coverts are striped transversely black and white. The
crown and nape of the male is crimson red, the female has a transverse
black stripe on the crown. Over the beak there is a pink spot. Over the
eye there is a black stripe, the face is greyish-white, the breast and the
throat yellowish-grey, and the centre of the belly, pink. The outer
and central tail feathers are striped black-white, the others very
black. The under tail-coverts are also striped black-white. The pri-
maries are black and have wide white stripes at the base. The secon-
daries have white spots. The bird measures about 10 inches.
We placed all seven Woodpeckers in a heated house in one cage
measuring 3 by 5 by 5 feet. We put four pieces of tree-fragments with
natural holes into the cage. The Woodpeckers did not quarrel at all,
only when feeding they drove each other away, but without any
struggle. The birds very quickly climbed on the trees and into the holes
where they also slept at night.
The food of these Woodpeckers is very interesting. It consists mostly
of sweet fruit and products, but also of insects and if they have nothing
else they also eat grain. In nature the Woodpeckers visit fruit-gardens
and peck up the pulp of the fruit. They like to visit orange plantations
and also love bananas. Where there are no fruit gardens they feed on
various fruits of wild trees. They gather the insects of rotting trees, as
do the European Woodpeckers, with the help of their strong and hard
beaks. Sometimes they fly to the ground where they gather different
insects and invertebrates.

J. H. REAY-BREEDING OF THE JUNGLE BUSH QUAIL
In captivity, the feeding of the Black-browed Woodpecker is very
easy. At first, before they became accustomed to our mixture, they got
Tenebrio molitor and different fruit. Later on they got accustomed to a
mixture of hard-boiled eggs, scraped carrot, and cooked scraped meat
with ant-eggs. Sometimes they got some Tenebrio molitor and every day
halves or quarters of pears, apples, oranges, or pieces of banana. In
winter they also feed on compotes--apricots, pineapple, plums, pears,
etc. It is very easy to feed them, because we need only give them food
once a day--in the morning. The birds then feed during the whole day
as they like. If the temperature gets higher and the food is damaged
more easily, we give the Woodpeckers the whole fruit and they eat out
the pulp themselves. The Black-browed Woodpecker does well in
captivity and with its gay feathers it is very decorative. It is also easy to
obtain food for them during the whole year.

BREEDING OF THE JUNGLE BUSH QUAIL
(Perdicula asiatica)
By J. H. Reay
\0x25A0
I am not sure if the Jungle Bush Quail (. Perdicula asiatica) has been
bred in the United Kingdom, but there was a vague reference in the
Avicultural Magazine some years ago to the breeding of the Rock
Bush Quail ( Perdicula argoondah) the only other relative of these
charming small partridge-like birds.

As they are commonly imported I am surprised that they have not
been regularly bred, but they do have a reputation for being shy and
difficult to tame. However, they will settle down if given the right type
of aviary accommodation with plenty of cover made up of clumps of
grass in the flight, an open shed with plenty of dry sand on the floor and,
very important with all ground birds, a board about 6 inches wide by
2 feet long raised off the ground by a brick at each end under which they
will roost. My birds laid their eggs under this board. I would add that
all quail, etc., should have one wing clipped prior to being released in
the aviary so that by the time the feathers have grown the birds are
completely settled and happy ; although they will fly up if startled I
have never known them to damage themselves.
As they are natives of India I have (previous to the winter 1963-64)
brought them into the bird room at a temperature of not less than
50* F. But that winter they stayed out without any ill-effects and the
Jungle Bush Quail hen laid a clutch of six eggs at the end of March
though she made no attempt to incubate. She had laid a clutch the
previous November and hatched one youngster which unfortunately
did not survive owing to the bad weather prevailing at that time.

However, coming to the present success story, the brief history is
that the hen laid her first egg on 27th August and continued laying
every day for the next eight days completing a clutch of nine beautiful
cream-coloured, highly glossy, eggs under the said board. No nesting
material was used, the eggs were laid on the bare ground, just a few
inches from the entrance door and once the hen started sitting nothing
moved her. Incubation started on 4th September and first chick
hatched on the afternoon of 25th September and the rest on the
morning of the 26th, approximately twenty-one days. (Salim Ali
states sixteen days.)
The chicks were only slightly bigger than Chinese Painted Quail
chicks and on the first two days could get through the J-inch
netting partition. The Jungle Bush Quail chicks had very dark brown
down with a buff-coloured stripe on the back of the head. Five hatched
and then the hen walked away leaving the other four eggs with per-
fectly formed chicks in them. We wonder if she was disturbed by the
Rock Bush Quail in the adjoining aviary which had a clutch of five
glossy-white eggs laid in a similar position to the Jungle Bush Quail's.
Unfortunately the Rock Bush lost all interest in her clutch when the
other chicks hatched.
The hen Jungle Bush Quail did all the incubating, but once the
chicks hatched it became a joint affair and an interesting fact is that
the whole family returned to the original nest-site each night to roost.
Another amusing fact is that when the chicks were small, if suddenly
disturbed by anyone approaching the cock called the youngsters
away and the hen fluffed herself out in the same way as a domestic
hen with a chick, adopting an aggressive attitude until she considered
it safe to rejoin the family.
The five chicks are now (November, 1964) almost as big as the
parents and quite independent. They are like the cock in colour,
except that they have no chestnut colouring on the forehead or throat,
and no buff stripe above the eyes. The rest of the plumage is brown
with buff stripes on the back and black markings on the wings ; the
under-parts are white with black bars. The adult hen is reddish-buff.
I She laid a further clutch of five eggs but being so late in the season I
removed them.
Rearing the chicks was a simple matter. Maggot and chopped meal-
&amp;apos; worms were given twice a day for the first week, plus pannicum, millet,
and maw seed ; some British finch mixture was thrown into the
aviary, cod-liver oil food was given each day. The only other occupants
of this aviary were a pair of Bourke's Parrakeets.
As described, J. H. Reay has bred the Jungle Bush Quail (Perdicula
asiatica). It is believed that this may be a first success.

(Galloperdix lunulata)
By A. J. Swain (Bromham, Bedford)
There are three members of the Spurfowl genus, all partridge-sized
birds ; the Ceylon and two species from India, the Red and the
Painted. The range of the latter, the subject of this report, is mainly
Eastern India, although it does occur in central parts, and its confines
are by no means easily defined. According to Hume the Painted
Spurfowl has a great liking for rough scrub and rocky ground, and
rarely will it take up permanent residence in true jungle.
As the name implies, at least one spur is present on each tarsus, and
most authorities quote the cocks as having two and the hens one.
However, the pair in my aviaries sport a total of nine spurs, the Spurhen
having two on each leg, and the Spurcock two on one leg and three on
the other.
Having seen pictures of the other two species it is my opinion that the
Painted Spurfowl is the most attractive. From some angles the cock
could be likened to a miniature Tragopan. The colouring of the Spur-
cock is that the head is black spotted with white, and the throat and
neck white spotted and streaked with black, while the underparts are
yellow shading to buff towards the rear with black spots concentrated
on the breast. The primaries and secondaries are brown with iridescent
green and purple patches showing on the black scapulars. It is the
chestnut upper-parts which in certain lights remind the observer of
Tragopans, as each feather has a white spot surrounded by a black
circle, more or less complete, although few of these are symmetrical
ocelli as with Tragopans. The Spurhen is mainly brown, being darker
above, lighter below, and with a very dark head. She also has buff-
coloured moustache stripes, and like the male bird her flight feathers
are brown.
While I agree with most other authors that Spurfowl in general are j
secretive and very easily alarmed, I found that their confidence is quite
readily obtained by a measure of patience and by providing some j
concentrated attention. To illustrate this I record that within ten days j
of the attempt first being made and with only ten minutes or so daily j
being devoted to the task, the Spurhen was accepting mealworms from |j
my fingers.

I obtained my pair of Painted Spurfowl in December, 1961, and they
were installed in quarters heated by an infra-red lamp. Their staple
diet comprised Turkey Breeder Pellets moistened at times with skimmed
milk and at other times with water. These rations were supplemented
from time to time with various kinds of fruit, white millet, and meal-
worms. Apart from a primitive type of courtship being enacted in
which, to the accompaniment of a subdued and almost inaudible
twittering, the Spurcock approached the hen and offered her a delicacy
such as a mealworm, no attempt to nest was made in 1962 or 1963,
although hopes were raised in the springs of both years when the hen
was seen to respond to her mate's advances and to take the titbits
proffered.
During November, 1963, it became necessary to move the Spurfowl
to different quarters, this time with the heat being provided by a
paraffin heater. As the new aviary was less sheltered and secluded I
considered that it was not as conducive to breeding as the previous one,
but in this I was to be proved wrong.
In the second half of May, 1964, the hen was missing for fairly long
periods, and after a search on the 23rd May, four white eggs were
found in a deep scrape in a corner of the shelter. This scrape was in
the litter of dead leaves and broken straw placed in the shed for the
birds' benefit at the beginning of the previous winter, and this material
was tinder dry. As great caution was taken so as to avoid hindering any
intended breeding, a full inspection was not made before 23rd May,
therefore the interval between the laying of the eggs was not recorded.
For the same reasons of caution no attempt was made to measure the
eggs during the incubation period. While the hen was sitting the cock
was never observed to approach the nesting site, and the only time they
spent together was during the feeding breaks taken by the Spurhen
morning and evening.
It was assumed that the hen began to sit 24th May, therefore the
hatching date of 15th June gave an incubation period of twenty-three
days. All four eggs hatched and the chicks were very closely brooded for
the first forty-eight hours. At this stage the young were seen to be
typical gallinaceous chicks, exceptionally lively, slightly smaller than
Grey Partridge chicks of the same age, the down being coloured a dark
sooty brown above, with a lighter shade below.
The rations offered to the Spurhen and her brood had as a basis
Turkey Starter Crumbs, with custard made from egg and milk, dried ant
pupae, and white millet, the whole being mixed together and moistened
to a crumbly mash with water. About a score of mealworms and twice
that number of maggots were also provided, the maggots always being
greedily consumed first before any of the other food was eaten. The
hen was extremely solicitous towards her chicks, holding morsels in her
bill and offering them in turn to the young, and she always ensured that

they were satisfied before taking any food for herself. These meals were
given first thing each morning and in the early evening.
During the period when the chicks were dependent upon the Spurhen
for their warmth, the cock was prevented from entering the brooding
quarters, in view of his known pugnacious nature ; nevertheless he
showed his willingness to attack in defence of the brood if he considered
their safety to be threatened.
The chicks grew rapidly, with feathers soon showing through the
down, and at the age of six days the flight feathers were fully developed,
and they were able to fly some 18 inches from the floor. When
they were twelve days old the body feathering was practically complete,
the colour now being dark brown all over, with fine vermiculations in
buff on the upper feathers. At the age of five weeks colour began to
show on two of the chicks, indicating that the brood consisted of two
pairs. Two areas began to colour simultaneously, the breast where light
buff feathers appeared, and the mantle where the feathers became
chestnut. A few days later the heads of the two cocks had traces of black
and white.
A set-back occurred on 25th July when one of the young cocks, which
the previous day was seen to be refusing food and standing apart from
the others, died. When handled, its carcase was found to be in a
wasted condition with very little flesh on the bones, although it had
been feeding normally right up to the day prior to its death.
The remainder of the brood continued to flourish, and at the age of
ten weeks I considered that they were independent of the Spurhen,
evidence of this being that they roosted alongside her on the perch
provided in the shed, instead of being brooded by her in a corner on the
floor. Also they were now ignoring the calls of the hen to a large
extent at feeding time, and fended for themselves. However, as the hen
was exercising a steadying influence on her chicks, I left her with them
for a further three weeks.
I am convinced that our aviaries will benefit if, with patience and
perseverance, an established breeding line of this colourful, engaging
little game bird can be secured.

As described, A. J. Swain has bred the Painted Spurfowl, Galloperdix
lunulata. It is believed that this may be a first success.

(&amp;apos;Calospiza larvata fanny)
By J. A. Johnson (West Bromwich, Staffs., England)
On walking into my aviary shelter during the first week in August,
1964, I found my Mrs. Wilson's Tanager hen sitting in a nest-basket
which was installed for my Waxbills to nest in. I waited for several days
until one morning, on going into the shelter, the hen flew out and
enabled me to inspect the eggs. There were two eggs each a muddy
green in colour with brown spots. The hen sat on the eggs during the
next twelve days, during which I did not disturb her. At the end of this
period I was able once again to inspect the nest but found that the eggs
had disappeared.
Around the end of August the hen went to the nest again but this
time the eggs were laid in a nest which my Zebra Finches had built in
some wire-netting attatched to the shelter windows. On this occasion
she sat for about a week before I could inspect the nest, after which I
again found two eggs. I left the bird alone for ten days, when she came
off the nest again and created a terrible fuss while I was feeding the
other birds. I then looked into the nest and saw that a chick had
hatched.
I tried to feed the young Tanager on everything I knew, nectar,
sponge-cake with pure honey poured over it, pears, grapes, sultanas,
currants, and maggots ad lib. I watched the parents catching moths and
small insects in the aviary and bushes in the outside flight.
Three weeks later I again found the hen creating quite a fuss and on
walking into the shelter I saw the young Tanager on the wire netting
attached to the shelter window. Realizing that it would not return to
the nest having once come out, I put it into a large cage on its own
together with some food and left the door open. The parents soon
found their way into the cage and began making a fuss and feeding the
young bird.
The bird is now (18th November, 1964), about nine weeks old and
feeds itself although the parents still give it tit-bits. I spray the young
bird three times a week with luke-warm water ; if this is not done the
bird soon becomes quite messy. I have also installed a shallow bath in
order to encourage the young bird to bathe himself.
The colour of his parents is just beginning to show in his feathers.
My only hope now is that the young bird does not injure himself when
he goes on the wing, which is always a risk.
As described, J. A. Johnson has bred Mrs. Wilson's Tanager
(Calospiza larvata fanny ). It is believed that this may be a first success.

J. J. YE ALL AND-BREEDING OF THE MASKED JAY-THRUSH
THE BREEDING OF THE MASKED JAY-THRUSH
(\0x25A0Garrulax perspicillatus)
By J. J. Yealland (London, England)
The Masked or Black-faced Jay or Laughing-Thrush inhabits eastern
parts of China southward of the Yangtze valley ; also parts of Indo-
China. La Touche says that it is abundant and that " the noisy and
harsh screams of this bird are a familiar sound on the Yangtze as well
as in gardens and jungle in the south-eastern provinces. The nest is
found on reeds in the reed-beds of the Yangtze, in bamboos at various
heights, and also in thick hedges. It is a large untidy cup of tendrils,
grasses, leaves, etc. The eggs are greenish-white, intensely glossy,
but of uneven texture. They measure about 28-5 by 22-5 mm."
In 1956 a pair of these birds arrived from Dr. K. C. Searle who
obtained them in Hong Kong. They lived in one of the outdoor
aviaries at the Bird House, but in the spring of 1962 they and a pair of
White-throated Jay-Thrushes were put into the large open Waders'
Aviary in which bamboos, privet, ivy, and a willow are growing. In
that year a nest was built in a privet bush by the Masked Jay-Thrushes
and eggs were laid, but none hatched. In the spring 1964 a nest was
built high in a privet bush. It was made of straw and grass and was " a
large untidy cup " as La Touche has described.
The height of the nest and the density of the privet made observation
difficult and " noisy and harsh screams " were uttered by the birds
whenever anyone went near the nest. The number of eggs and how
many young hatched we do not know, but one chick was reared and
has been for some time quite independent of the parents.
After the chick hatched the White-throated Jay-Thrushes took an
interest in the proceedings and whenever the parents were away one of
the White-throated perched on or near the nest. After the young one
had left the nest the White-throated as well as the parents were seen to
feed it. The White-throated may have been responsible for one of the
three nests built in the aviary during the spring and summer, but they
were not seen to do any building and it is not known whether any eggs
were laid--certainly there was no incubation.
Mealworms, cleaned maggots, and insectile food mixture were
provided. The birds may sometimes find " natural " foods in this large
aviary, but this could not amount to much.
As described above the Masked Jay-Thrush (Garrulax perspicillatus)
has been bred at the London Zoo. It is believed that this may be a
first success.

ACTIVITIES AT THE EDWARD MARSHALL
BOEHM AVIARIES IN 1963

Yes, it is 1963 I refer to, it is no misprint. Owing to the number of
new species that were bred that year, my time was fully occupied in
preparing the articles covering these species in detail. Now they have
been concluded, I feel that a summary of the entire season would be in
order. For ease of reference, I propose doing this in common-name
alphabetical order, referring to individual papers as and where neces-
sary. I had thought of doing it in the chronological order of events but,
since, at times, so much was going on over the same period, it could only
have led to confusion.
To commence, a pair of African Black-headed Orioles Oriolus l.
larvatus, took to an open nest-box affixed to a locust tree and the female
built a rather untidy, open cup-nest of coarse grasses and rootlets, with a
skimpy lining of Spanish moss. One egg, greyish-white with brown and
grey spots was laid on 21st April, but, the following day, the bird was
on the ground in obvious distress. She was placed in the hospital room,
under a lamp, and, fully recovering, was returned to the aviary on the
24th. Immediately she went back to the nest and settled down on the
egg that had been left there. Advantage had been taken of her absence
to measure the egg which was 29 by 20 mm. Although her original
distress had been attributed to egg-binding, no egg was laid in the cage
and neither was there a trace of another egg anywhere in the aviary.
So, what the trouble had been is not definitely known, but the rest and
warmth obviously cleared it up.
A look at the egg ten days later led us to conclude that it was fertile
and in this we were not mistaken for, on 10th May, it hatched. The
nestling was covered with snow-white down and had a pink gape with
two purple spots in the roof of the mouth. Although the incubation had
been a solitary affair, the male joined in with the rearing, live food ;
appearing to be the sole diet employed at that early stage. At six days
old the youngster's eyes were open, and yellow was showing in the wing
butts, black feathering being visible on the back and in the flights two J
days later. At eleven days the parents began to add ground raw beef
and fruit to its diet and, by the 27th, the body and wings were feathered
up although, except for some fluff, the head was bare. It left the nest at
nineteen days old and it was seen that the flight feathers were black,
edged with white, the tail feathers were yellow, and there was yellow
showing on the shoulders, but the head still bore fluff only. The under-
parts were dirty white, flecked with yellow. Success, however, was not
to be for, the following day, it was found suspended in an azalea bush
with its thigh broken. It died later that same day. Although they went to
nest twice more that year, having two chicks each time, the adults failed

to rear any of them. However, they were successful in 1964 and, since it
is believed that this may be the first breeding of the species in captivity,
a separate paper on that nesting will be prepared at a later date.
Three pairs of Black-headed Sugarbirds, Chlorophanes spiza, went to
nest but only two young were raised. As the nesting of this species was
described fully in Avicultural Magazine, 1962, 49, no further details
will be given here. However, prior to passing on, I would like to
mention that the two birds were hatched by one female who then died.
They were promptly transferred to another aviary where a female had
two clear eggs. These were removed and replaced with the day-old
chicks. To our great delight the foster parents took to them and the
fourth generation of Black-headed Sugarbirds joined the other inmates.
The Black-throated Cotinga, Pipreola riefferi, the breeding of which
was described in A.M., 1963, 141, had four nests, but failed to rear any
young. Why this should have been is not fully understood for the feed
supplied followed the exact lines of the previous year, but all to no
avail. Another disappointment experienced that year was with the
Bronzy Sunbirds, JVectarinia kilimensis , for, although they reared one
chick up to the point of leaving the nest, it did not survive. However,
we were pleased with the successful breeding of the Thailand Hoopoe,
Upopa epops longirostris, see A.M. , 1964, 163. This same pair bred again
in 1964, one chick as before, but another pair had five young in all,
thus enabling more data to be gathered on the development of the
young.
Amongst the Australian species at the Boehm aviaries there was a
pair of Crescent Honeyeaters, Phylidonyris pyrrhoatera , and, when they
went to nest, great hopes were raised. The female built a deep, open-
topped nest of fine grasses and Spanish moss, low down in an azalea
bush. Two eggs, pale pink, spotted, and flecked with reddish-brown
were laid late in May, but, two days later, they had disappeared and
the pair made no further attempts at nesting. With the Fairy Blue
Birds, Irena puella , however, it was a different story and these did rear
three fine birds, see A.M. } 1964, 18. The pair of Fairy Blue Wrens,
Malurus cyaneus , the breeding of which was described in A.M., 1962, 84,
went to nest again and had three young, all reared to maturity. It was
felt that it was this pair of birds that might well have been responsible for
the loss of the Honeyeater's eggs, for the two species shared the same
aviary.
Although there has been a pair of Crested Fireback Pheasants,
Lophura ignita, at the aviaries ever since I have been here, we have
never had any luck in the breeding of them. It seems that as quickly as
the male gets his crest, the female plucks it out and, as soon as she lays
an egg, he destroys it. We endeavoured to avoid this by separating them
after mating had been witnessed. However, although she laid two eggs
they were both clear. Better luck next time, we hope.

Another first-time success for us, and we believe of the species in
captivity, was with the Golden-crested Myna, Mino coronatus, whose
rearing of one male was detailed in A.M. 1964, 216. Grey-winged
Blackbirds, Turdus boulboul, made several nests in a large open aviary
but, although eggs were laid on at least three occasions, they all
disappeared. Work of the Orange Cock of the Rock we suspect.
However, to add to our firsts, Joyful Greenbuls, Chlorocichla l. latissima ,
reared one young as related in A.M., 1964, 170. In the same aviary as
the Grey-winged Blackbirds mentioned above there was a collection of
Knysna, Purple-crowned, Schalow's, and Red-crested Touracos. There
were four Knysnas, two of which took to an open wire nest in a hemlock
tree. When three eggs were produced, on two separate occasions, all
clear, it became apparent that they were both females. The remaining
two made no attempt to nest that year but, subsequent to the disposal
of the other two, have nested and details of this will be included in the
1964 reports.
The Masked Wood Swallows, Artamus per sonata, that had made an
attempt at nesting the year before, were successful in 1963, raising five
young in all, A.M. , 1964, 186, refers. The most satisfying breeding of
all, however, was that by the Natal Kingfishers, Ispidina picta natalensis,
full details of which were given in A.M., 1964, 15. Mr. Boehm had put
a lot of work into preparing a suitable aviary and nesting conditions, and
the success fully justified the outlay of effort. The rearing of three
Natal Robins, Cossypha natalensis , A.M., 1964, 70, was another first
for us.
As with the Black-throated Cotinga, success with the Orange-
breasted, Euchlornis jucunda, also eluded us. Three times they went to nest
two eggs each time of which but one hatched, but on no occasion did
they live more than five days. It appears fairly conclusive that it must
be lack of the correct rearing food for, although several diets were tried
both that year and the next, we still have failed to rear any young.
Since their main food in their native habitat is small berries, we have
built up a stock of elderberries in the deep freeze in anticipation of 1965.
Unlike the Black-throated species they are not very insectivorous, and
do not even bother to look at small, live fish, one of the main diets with
the rearing of the Black-throated in 1962. They are a definite problem
and represent a great challenge which we still hope to be able to meet.
A pair of Philippine Painted Quail, Excalfactora chinensis lineata , had
nine eggs but the mice got at them so we had no bumble-bee size young \0x25A0
to keep an eye on. The Palawan Peacock Pheasants, Polyplectron
enphanum , however, did have one young, a male. It was an entertain-
ment to watch the young bird at but seven days old, no bigger than a
day-old domestic chick, climb 3 feet up into a hemlock to roost under
its mother. The first time it occurred it was not seen, for, at the late
afternoon feed only the female was visible and she was up in the tree.

After searching everywhere for the chick without success, it finally
poked its little head out from under its mother. The following day its
going to bed procedure was kept under observation, a good twenty
minutes being involved in its laborious ascent, twig by twig.
In the same aviary as the Joyful Greenbuls was a pair of Red-eyed
Bulbuls, Pycnonotus nigricans , who also reared two young, see A.M. , 1964,
214. Similarly, in a room abutting on to the aviary containing the
Touracos, a pair of Red-winged Starlings, Onychognathus m. morio, had
three young from two rounds, A.M. , 1964, 133, refers. Sharing the
aviary of the Fairy Blue Wrens and Honeyeaters there had been a pair
of Crested Green Wood Partridge, Rollolus roulroul, since late 1961. In
September 1963, they went to nest having six eggs, of which three
hatched and were reared to maturity. There were two females and one
male in the brood, and this natural breeding, not resorting to an
incubator or foster parent as is so often done with this type of bird, was
most gratifying.
To round off the 1963 season the White-browed Wood Swallows,
Artamus superciliosis, A.M. , i960, 229, had two rounds and the White-
cheeked Touracos, Turacus l. leucotis, four, described in this number of
the Avicultural Magazine. The total number of species with which
success was achieved was fifteen, forty-five young being reared in all.
Of these species, I have reason to believe that eight of them had not been
bred in captivity before.

A SELDOM-SEEN HYBRID

delighted when, through the kindness of a good friend, I received two
of these handsome, sleek birds, which I placed in a separate section of
my aviary. Late in the spring they became exceedingly active. One of
them would fly into an open-top nest-box in the rear of the pen, there to
coo loudly, the (to me) queer-sounding " cluck-cluck-cluck " soon
attracting the other bird. The latter would then fly to the nest-box,
and, perching on the rim, would also coo vigorously, the while shaking
head and body up and down, but would not enter the box. The two
birds would render this " concert " frequently every day for many
weeks, when, finally, it culminated in spirited wing-flapping and fighting
at the nest-box. Away from it, the birds got along well, neither troubling
the other in any way, as would doubtless have been the case with most
male domestic pigeons. Knowing nothing about the behaviour of
Snow Pigeons, I left the two specimens together for some months,
meanwhile endeavouring to obtain information which might throw

light on the behaviour of this handsome wild species, particularly
nesting behaviour. In this effort I failed. All I really knew about
Snow Pigeons in captivity was that quite a few years ago Professor
Ghigi had successfully crossed them with racing homers in his Italian
lofts.
To come to the point : being unable to procure a female Snow
Pigeon (I was convinced by this time that I had two males), I sent for a
female Strasser, a well-known domestic European breed. Large,
broad-breasted, this particular specimen had the same lovely blue and
clear white colour, which makes the Snow Pigeon so good-looking, the
only difference being that the Strasser was barless. Larger than the
Snow Pigeon, this hen was descended from a long line of very carefully-
bred Strassers, an excellent domestic strain which has produced
squabs true to colour for many generations. In less than a week, she
was mated to her wild partner, and soon thereafter she laid fertile eggs
which were the size of pullets eggs. Her Snow Pigeon mate took his
proper turn at incubating them during the day, as is customary with
most pigeons. When, after about eighteen days 5 incubation, the squabs
hatched, they were fed well and seemed to thrive ; however, when
twelve days old, they both died. I suspected throat canker, but did not
see any. The youngsters 5 crops were well filled. Besides the usual
domestic pigeon-feed mixture, I gave the parent birds wild-grass seeds.
There followed several more settings of eggs which duly hatched, the
young dying at an early age. Being desirous of raising some young
from this colourful pair of pigeons, I placed one egg--two would have
been too many--under ringneck doves. In due course they hatched a
squab and raised it well. At three weeks of age the youngster was
larger than either foster parent, considerably larger. Seeing the diminu-
tive ringneck male feeding the " huge 55 hybrid reminded me rather
vividly of pictures I have seen portraying young, fledged cuckoos
towering, at feeding time, over their pint-size foster parents--warblers.
Even though both , male wild Snow Pigeon and female domestic
Strasser, boast a beautiful blue-and-white (light blue) plumage colora-
tion, the hybrid squab assumes, as the accompanying photograph
shows, the typical colour of the Rock Pigeon (Columba livid )--dark
blue with jet-black wing-bars and practically no white whatever. To
all appearances it is, at least at this age and time, a typical and rather
" rapid 55 throw-back to this supposedly common ancestor of all
domestic pigeon breeds. The hybrid's behaviour in the nest, unlike that
of domestic squabs, was always vigorously defensive, the bird flapping
its muscular wings at my hand whenever I reached into the nest to make
sure the squab was being fed well. Another somewhat unusual side-
light on its behaviour : when only ten days old, and not able to walk as
yet, during hot weather the youngster would leave its nest-box, which
stood on the floor of the aviary, and somehow manage to climb onto

a flat brick nearby, there seemingly to cool off and to rest until late
afternoon, when the young hybrid would literally waddle back into its
nest for the night. I am almost tempted to call this repeated behaviour
" intelligent," that is, for want of a more suitable term.
Note by Derek Goodwin
Our editor has asked me to comment on this interesting note by
Professor Naether. Our late member Mr. T. H. Newman, who was
such a keen and accomplished pigeon keeper, successfully bred the
Snow Pigeon, at least so far as rearing the young to and past the
fledgeling stage but found that most or all of the captive-bred young
died (if I remember rightly) when less than a year old. He described his
breeding of this species and its calls and displays, or at least some of
them, in our magazine (Newman, 1911). This beautiful species appears
to have been little studied in the wild state, the most informative
account, so far as I know, is that of Schafer (1938) who gives observa-
tions on its ecology and draws a vivid word-picture of the flocks of
Snow Pigeons battling against the gales as they fly on an undeviating
route from their feeding grounds in the cultivated valleys up the
mountain sides to their roosting places high above.
Apparently some hybrids bred by Professor Ghigi (1922) from a male
Ghazzi Modena Domestic Pigeon and a female Snow Pigeon were also
coloured all over but as Cole (1939) pointed out when discussing these
hybrids and refuting Professor Ghigi's belief in the multiple origin of
the Domestic Pigeon, the resemblance between the colour pattern of the
Snow Pigeon and such domestic pigeons as the Ghazzi Modena (or the
Strasser) is largely superficial. The white parts of the Domestic
Modena or Strasser are due to unpigmented feathers, the feathers of
the white parts of the Snow Pigeon are not entirely unpigmented. It is
of interest that although, like its Snow Pigeon parent, this young
hybrid clearly shows three wing bars (Rock Pigeons usually show only
two with, sometimes, a trace of a third) these are jet black as in the
Rock (or Domestic) Pigeon not dark drab as in the Snow Pigeon. It is
to be hoped that this interesting hybrid will survive and that Professor
Naether will be able later to let us have an account of its adult plumage
and a comparison of its calls and displays with those of the two parent
species.

By J. O. D'eath (Hadley, Herts, England)
The number of non-migratory Anatidae to be found on the Con-
tinent of Africa comprise some eighteen or so species, to which can be
added the Spurwing and Egyptian Goose, the Knobnose or Comb-
duck and Pygmy Geese. The majority of the foregoing have been
fairly well represented in collections in this country since the war.
Such species as Fulvous (. Dendrocygna bicolor ) and White-faced Whistling
Duck (. D . viduatd), Cape Teal [Anas capensis ), Yellowbill ( Anas undulata)
and African Pochard (. Aythya erythrophthalma ) have not only been kept
but bred freely. The rarer Hartlaub's (Cairina hartlaubi) has been
propagated for the first time at the Wildfowl Trust, Slimbridge.
However, the keen waterfowl collector scanning the available literature
will encounter therein under the African section two species which to
him are merely a description in the book accompanied by a coloured
plate, the opportunity of seeing these birds alive in captivity having
been denied him up to the present.
The species referred to are the White-backed Duck ( Thalassornis
levconotus) and the Maccoa Duck ( Oxyura maccoa ).
In January, 1961, I planned my first safari through the then British
East African territories of Kenya, Uganda, and Tanganyika and was
airborne for Entebbe, Uganda, in January, 1962.
Apart from seeing and filming the wonderful panorama of wildlife
that East Africa has to offer, much at the back of my mind was the
anticipation of seeing the various indigenous waterfowl. However,
at the end of a seven-week safari covering several thousand miles, I
returned home rather chastened, as the visions I had conjured up of
the African skies being blackened with ducks proved to be an illusion.
The reason for this, however, was that my first visit to East Africa had
coincided with one of the severest droughts for many years and the
normal habitat of the ducks had been completely altered. I did,
however, see my first Hottentot Teal in the wild and such species as
Red-billed Pintail, Combduck, Yellowbill, and Cape Teal. The
European migrants such as Shoveler, Garganey, and Pintail were also
present in small numbers.
Like any other visitor to East Africa, I began counting the days to
when I could next return and on New Year's Eve, 1963, I landed at
Nairobi with an extensive safari planned. I took an early opportunity
of visiting the Coryndon Museum and was shown the extensive collec-
tion of bird skins by John Williams the leading authority on East
African birds. On 10th January I flew from Nairobi to Arusha in
Tanganyika and then proceeded by road some ninety-odd miles to the
Lake Manyara National Park where I was to stay with Game Warden,

Max Morgan Davies. Lake Manyara is at the southern end of the
Great Rift Valley and is a wonderful place for migrant water birds.
Here, however, I was to draw a blank in my search for the Maccoa and
White-back. Inquiries from local farmers, game scouts, and profes-
sional hunters yielded no definite information. However, a government
geologist passing through was convinced he had seen White-back on a
small dam or lake some fifty miles distant and although not mapped he
gave us a pin-point. By extreme good fortune we were able to borrow a
glass-fibre boat and an outboard motor from a professional hunter.
On 16th January, with the boat on the roof of the Land-Rover, we
ascended the Mto-Mwa-Mbu escarpment and headed for the Baso-
duish district. We found our objective fairly easily. It was a sheet of
water about three-quarters of a mile long and 400 yards wide. From a
distance one could see a reed bed at the southern end and an area of
submerged trees at the northern extremity. With the naked eye at a
range of about a quarter of a mile, one could see an enormous con-
centration of birds on the surface of the water. We approached the
waters edge and field glasses swung into action. It was immediately
apparent that the vast number of black dots we had seen at our first
sighting were African Coots (Fulica cristata ) which were present in some
thousands. As our eyes became more accustomed to the scene, we
started to note other species and excitedly called them out to each other.
Hottentot Teal, White-faced and Fulvous Whistlers, Knobnose,
Red-billed Pintail, various waders, Egrets, etc., were quickly identified.
Suddenly beyond a big raft of Coots I sighted a party of at least fifty
White-backs and then as one's eyes penetrated the heat shimmer
rising from the water, it quickly became apparent that the White-backs
were present in considerable numbers. For one moment I thought I
saw a male Maccoa disappearing into the reed bed but the sighting was
too brief to be certain. Without further delay the boat was launched
and the outboard motor hummed into life. We headed for the southern
end where we had noted the reed bed extending into the water. As
we swung round a small circular clump of Papyrus, I had a perfect
view of a pair of Maccoa in a clearing, the cobalt-blue beak of the male
glistening in the sun. They quickly dived and were lost to sight. The
motor was throttled back and we quietly zig-zagged our way through
the reeds and in another clearing were rewarded with the sight of two
female Maccoa which quietly swam away from us. It was then decided
to complete a survey of the remainder of the lake and we cruised
slowly along to the northern end recording the various bird species as
we went. African Black Duck and a solitary female African Shoveler
were added to the list. One female Maccoa quietly swam 5 feet in front
of the boat for about 50 yards. It became apparent that the Maccoa
population was no more than three pairs whereas the White-backs
were estimated at 500 to 600. We came ashore for lunch and liquid

refreshment which was badly needed with the midday sun at its full
strength.
After lunch we made another sortie and adopted a new technique
in driving the boat at full throttle at a reed-bed, reversing and repeating
the process. By this method we cut several navigable channels which
gave us access to open areas within the reed-bed. The water had an
overall depth of 3 feet and was fairly clean by African standards.
In the clump of reeds (Cyperus articulatus) on the edge of one of these
open pools I noted a nest which looked exactly similar to that of the
European Coot (Fulica atra ). On investigation it proved to be something
quite different. In fact, it was the nest of a Maccoa and contained five
eggs. These were white in colour and of rough chalky texture, virtually
identical with those of the Ruddy Duck ( 0 . jamaicensis ), but I would
say, a fraction larger. The platform of the nest was 9 inches above
the water and identical in construction to that of a coot. There was no
approach platform and no evidence of down. The thought occurred
to us that the Maccoa might be parasitic in its choice of nest site,
utilizing a Coot's nest but there was no evidence of this, moreover the
huge Coot population referred to initially were not nesting. The
eggs were tested in water and appeared to be fresh. It was decided to
collect these and make a supreme effort to send them by air to the
Wildfowl Trust, Slimbridge. We were not very sanguine of repeating
our good fortune as our preliminary survey had shown the existence of
two to three pairs at the most on this water. Continuing our way we
found another similar nest but this time it was that of a White-back and
contained three large brown eggs unlike those of any duck I had seen.
The colour can only be compared to that of the domestic Rhode Island
Red poultry. My hopes were high that as there were only three eggs,
they must certainly be fresh, but on testing them in water they floated
ominously and on breaking one it was obvious that it had been
incubated for about two weeks. It was 7 p.m. when we came off the
water and after loading the boat we reached camp at 8.30 p.m. after
quite a tiring but momentous day.
The next day was spent resting and on 18th January we paid another
visit to our new found lake. It was immediately noticeable that in the
twenty-four hours that had elapsed the White-back population had
diminished considerably, a possible theory being that some local
migration was taking place. My notes show that after a diligent
search we found a nest with five fresh White-back eggs and another with
a single one. These six were collected for shipment to Slimbridge.
A little later another nest was found with a female White-back sitting
very tight on three eggs, one of which was chipping. We found nothing
further and returned to camp. I was due to commence a safari to the
Serengeti Plains the next day so our engagement with the Maccoa and
White-back had to be broken off. My Game Warden friend suggested

that on my return from the Serengeti an attempt should be made to
catch White-backs and Maccoa, and in my absence he would prepare
mist nets, etc.
After a long and dusty return safari I arrived back at Manyara on
26th January. My journal shows that we left on our first catching
expedition at 9.30 a.m. and on arrival at the lake I immediately
sighted three female Maccoa through the glasses, but owing to their
small numbers I entertained very slender hopes of meeting with success
in their capture, and it was on the White-backs that our intentions
were mainly centred. We decided that as the White-backs were
reluctant to take wing our best chance of capture would be to submerge
two-thirds of the mist nets and endeavour to drive the birds into them,
and on meeting the net they would dive and become entangled.
Our first attempt at setting the nets was considerably hampered by a
high wind which had sprung up and it was virtually impossible to set
the nets from the boat. The only alternative was to wade in the water
and accomplish the operation this way at the risk of contracting that
unpleasant African disease Bilharziasis. After several setbacks the net was
finally positioned at the entrance to a small bay and we then attempted
to drive a party of fifteen White-backs towards the net. This operation
was completely unsuccessful and our first catch was three Coots and a
Great Crested Grebe (Podiceps cristatus). After several more abortive
attempts we decided to cancel operations and returned home con-
siderably chastened.
My time in Tanganyika was running perilously short as I had a
lengthy safari through Uganda in front of me, but I was determined to
have the satisfaction of handling a live White-back before I left. We
decided on one last desperate attempt and this time it was to be a night
operation. A home-made net and shaft was fashioned and at 5.15 p.m.
on 1 st February, we set off once again. On this occasion we had addi-
tional help in the form of the manageress of the nearby safari lodge
and an African game scout. On arrival we waited for the sun to go
down and at 8 p.m. we launched the boat. Our equipment comprised
the aforesaid hand-net, the Land-Rover battery and a powerful spot-
light. It was soon apparent that any White-backs that were in open
water dived out of range on approach. We learnt, however, that those
which were in an area where there was submerged weed presented a
better opportunity. The method of operation was that the netsman
took his stance in the bow of the boat and the spotlight operator
behind him, with the third assistant on the outboard motor. The duck
were picked up in the beam of the spotlight and when the boat was
within 50 yards the motor was throttled back and a reasonably
stealthy approach made. At 9.35 p.m., under a three-quarter moon,
our first White-back was netted and we subsequently caught two more.
We also attempted to catch Hottentot Teal but they proved too wary.

S. T. JOHNSTONE-BREEDING RESULTS AT THE WILDFOWL TRUST
It became apparent that ideal capture conditions require a completely
dark night with no moon at all. We came off the water at midnight,
and arrived back in camp at 1.30 a.m. tired but triumphant.
Subsequent observations show that the White-back establishes well
in captivity and is noteworthy for its lack of shyness even immediately
after capture, making no attempt to skulk but standing its ground and
hissing at anyone approaching and allowing itself to be picked up.
I would also describe it as a gross feeder. This species is not easy to
sex and the cloacal method is the most reliable. To the unitiated, it is
not apparent how the White-back derives its name, as the prominent
white patch on its back is not visible until the bird is in flight.
The Maccoa shows opposite characteristics under captive conditions
and is of extremely shy and retiring disposition, only feeding when
unobserved.
Both species have been kept in the Wildfowl Trust collection at
Slimbridge and are believed to be the only ones in Europe. The
White-back has wintered outside but the Maccoa appears to be more
tender and requires winter housing.
It is to be hoped that with the continued improvement in air
communications, these two species, the subject of these notes, will be
seen in collections in the future and a break-through made in breeding
them. According to Delacour, Waterfowl of the World , Vol. Ill, p. 257,
the Madagascan form of White-back was bred by the late A. Ezra at

By S. T. Johnstone (Slimbridge, Glos., England)
It had been predetermined to limit the number of birds raised this
season to under 1,000 at Slimbridge and 300 at Peakirk. Last season the
figures were 1,350 and 380 respectively. For this purpose, a number of
species of geese and duck were allowed to incubate their first clutches.
The year has been a poor one at Slimbridge for several species, the
Shoveler being particularly unsuccessful--no eggs from the Cape or
New Zealand and clear eggs from the Argentines, even the Common
produced only a dozen or so youngsters. On the other hand, Peakirk
bred Cape and New Zealand Shoveler for the first time. Garganey
and Blue-winged Teal failed to produce young. Last year over forty
Ringed Teal were reared ; this year only a dozen survived from
the twenty-five hatched, scarcely enough to replace winter losses. *
The Smew eggs were infertile and no Barrow's Goldeneye hatched. The
North American Ruddy Ducks have never recovered from the 1962-63

winter, when fifteen breeding pairs were reduced to five. Not more than
fifteen hatched, of which half survived.
Against this rather dismal background we have had some excite-
ments. Ninety-four kinds were represented in the 1,200 birds raised at
the two establishments, and first breeding records were established for
Slimbridge with Crested Screamers, Brown-breasted Whistling Duck,
Whooper Swan, Trumpeter Swan, Patagonian Crested Duck, Bronze-
winged Duck and Baer's Pochard, the Bronze-winged Duck and
Patagonian Crested Duck being the first breeding in captivity. Baer's
Pochard have been bred previously by Mr. Kooy at Den Helder in
Holland. These successes bring the total kinds reared at Slimbridge to
130.
The long-felt desire to breed Her Majesty's Trumpeter Swans has
been fulfilled. The female had laid the previous two years but on each
occasion had deserted the eggs after partial incubation. We were,
this time, able to put two eggs under a Black-necked Swan (her own
were hatched by hens) and two under a Black Swan. Both hatched a
cygnet after thirty-three days, a seemingly short incubation period,
enchanting little things with steely-white down and pink bills and tarsi.
One has felt that Slimbridge was not the most suitable place for
breeding swans, but maybe this is not so as Mutes, Bewick's, Whooper's,
Trumpeters, Black, Black-necked, and Coscorobas have been reared
here. Our female Whistling Swan died from an impaction of the
oviduct after building a nest.
It is only in the last three years that we have added the Anhiminae
to our collection. At present only the Black-necked and Crested
Screamers are represented. The male of the latter had gone sick in the
winter so that the first two clutches of eggs laid were clear. Through
the kindness of the London Zoo a male was loaned to us and a third
clutch of eggs produced two chicks after the parents had incubated for
forty-one days. Quite delightful little things with a spherical head on an
equally spherical body. The down is a mustard and pepper colour and
the crown a rich orange, the characteristic beak and lores a purplish-
grey and the prominent feet are pale pink.
The Baer's Pochard had laid nine eggs producing nine ducklings
after twenty-eight days of incubation by a bantam. The ducklings are
midway in size and colour between the Common White-eye and the
Australian Hardhead, being a greenish-brown above with pale yellow
underparts. There are six yellow blotches on the upper parts, two on
the rump, two on the thighs, and two on the scapulars. The cheeks are
yellow and the bill has a pink tip and sides, the tarsi are black, and the
eyes brown. The ducklings were reared next to a brood of Common
White-eye, and the comparative darkness of the latter was most
noticeable. One of the Patagonian Crested Duck collected for us by the
Savick expedition laid in October, 1963, but the eggs did not hatch.

S. T. JOHNSTONE-BREEDING RESULTS AT THE WILDFOWL TRUST
This season two females laid and the nine ducklings hatched have been
reared, five by bantams and four by the parent birds. Although the
adult birds of the two races of Crested Duck are very similar, the
ducklings are quite distinctive. The overall colours of the Andean
Crested ducklings are brown and fawn, the Patagonian Crested Duck
grey and cream. The throat and lower cheeks are white, the under-
parts cream. The cap, neck, and back grey, the brown eyes situated in
the grey area of the head. There are four cream blotches on the back
and the legs and bill are pale grey. The eggs are cream in colour with
an average weight of 55 gm. and measuring 63 by 46 mm.
A Patagonian and an Andean Crested duckling were reared together
when one could observe the brownness of the marked eye stripe and
large bill of the latter.
The Bronze-wing Duck (Anas specularis) which frequents an area
including Southern Chile, Argentina, and Tierra del Fuego, is a
Mallard-sized duck with an overall mottled brown plumage, a white
patch on the cheek and a triangular white chin strap. The speculum, a
brilliant bronze, is brighter than that of the Crested Ducks. There are
very few specimens in captivity, the only birds I know of being at the
Wildfowl Trust and at Cologne Zoo.
Ten years ago the well-known Dutch aviculturist, D. G. Schuyl,
acquired two birds which were accepted as a pair. Eggs were obtained
and a possible reason for the infertility was suggested to be the extreme
tameness of the birds. Mr. Schuyl described how they followed him
like dogs, and took great delight in being fondled. Eventually through
his kind co-operation, the birds came to Slimbridge in 1955. On
cloacal examination it was found that both were females. They were
released in our Orchard Pen, an enclosure much frequented by the
visiting public. Both birds were delighted to have so many people to
follow round and engage their attention. This predilection for humans
was, however, greatly to their detriment, for they got under the visitors'
feet and were consequently lamed in a very short time. It was neces-
sitous therefore to shut them behind a fence in a small enclosure.
Here they both proceeded to lay eggs in a clump of Christmas roses.
All sources were now explored with a view to obtaining a male
bird but we could find no one in South America who could acquire a
bird for us. The Savick expedition in 1961 were commissioned to
catch us some specimens at all costs. This was successfully achieved and
four birds were caught and dispatched by air. Unfortunately there
were delays in transit ; a single bird arrived alive and this, a female,
only survived a short while. Meanwhile sad to relate, one of the original
birds died. Eventually we learned that Cologne Zoo had obtained two
males and in December, 1963, Dr. Windecker the Director arranged for
one of them to be brought to Slimbridge. After quarantine the male
and our surviving female were installed in the Guinness Aviary. We

chose an enclosure where there were clumps of pampas grass to help
the male feel at home. On 12th February we had the first egg, and
five were laid in all. They were removed after five days and placed
under a Silky cross bantam.
Over the years it had been customary for members of the staff to
pick up the duck at every opportunity, a practice one deprecated for
one felt that if ever we acquired a male we would find that this
imprinting on humans would have destroyed the bird's interest in its own
kind, and that if she did lay, the eggs would continue to be infertile.
It was therefore all the more surprising that in spite of this preference for
humans three eggs were fertile. Two embryos died at an early stage
but after thirty-one days the remaining egg hatched. This long
incubation period suggests that the species may be related to the
perching ducks, the cairinini, or shelducks.
The duckling was large and rather similar in colouring to a Chiloe
Wigeon. It was dark brown above, the under parts being cream.
The cap was grey-brown and the dark brown eye surrounded with
reddish-brown down. There was a distinct white area on the cheeks
and throat. There were also four white blotches on the back. The
large bill and the tarsus were slate-grey.
Apart from a few shrimps, the duckling was not seen to take any food
for the first three days, and spent most of its time on the back of its
foster-mother. On the fourth day, however, it commenced to eat the
grated egg and Turkey Starter Crumbs provided. The bird grew apace,
and was feathering at three weeks, the white face patch developing at
once.
On the day the duckling hatched, the first egg of a second clutch of
five was laid. The duck was allowed to incubate for the first three
weeks, when it was found that she had cracked one egg. However, the
remaining four were fertile. She was given five Mallard to hatch, which
she duly did, but was inclined to neglect them after the first few days.
Her own eggs now under a bantam, hatched again after thirty-one
days, but to our dismay all four had their metatarsi fully flexed. The
" clenched fist " effect of the feet persisted for forty-eight hours but
then gradually disappeared when the ducklings became quite normal.
They are now fully grown and in typical adult plumage.
The eggs are creamish-yellow, the average weight being 75 gm. and
the size 70 by 51 mm.
Other interesting species reared include Magpie Geese, Andean

24 c. EVERITT-BREEDING THE WHITE-CHEEKED TOURACO
BREEDING THE WHITE-CHEEKED TOURACO
By Charles Everitt (Trenton, N.J., U.S.A.)
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.998700571428571" page_id="56365645"  page_num="24" year="" vol="">
The Touracos, of which there are nineteen species in all, are confined
to Africa where they are to be found mainly between the latitudes of
5* N. to io* S., fifteen of the species inhabiting the eastern regions.
Once classified under the Cuculiformes, they are now regarded as a
separate order of birds, the Musophagiformes, with the family name
of Musophagidae. Their association with the Cuculiformes was due
partly to the structure of the feet, as they have two toes front and rear,
the outer hind toe being reversible, thus giving them, at times, the
appearance of a normal three-toe forward and one rear-toed bird.
It was their fowl-like behaviour, plus several other characteristics, that
led to their being grouped in an order to themselves.
Many of the species are referred to as Plantain-eaters, rather than
Touracos, and, within their own family, they are split into two groups,
fourteen of the species having red flight feathers, the others having
grey. The group bearing the red flights have body colours of green
and various shades of blue, ranging through to purple. A great charac-
teristic of this family is that it is one of the few groups of birds that has
green pigment in the feathering. Further, the red in the flights is a
true pigment that is soluble in an alkali.
Prior to passing on to the breeding of the White-cheeked species
(Turacus l. leucotis ), I would like to mention a valuable product that is
extracted from the red flight feathers. These contain uroporphyrin,
averaging 3 mg., per feather. This is a member of a group of complex
compounds called porphyrins. One of these substances is part of the
haemoglobin molecule in blood, and is responsible for its red colour.
Occasionally the mechanism of the liver, which breaks down blood,
becomes deranged, resulting in a very unpleasant, and at the present
time incurable, disease called porphyria. Uroporphyrin is used mainly
in medical research concerned with this disease and various other
liver ailments. Apart from blood and red Touraco feathers, por-
phyrins also are found in minute quantities in various molluscs and egg
shells, some Bustard and Owl feathers and, it has been stated, in the
" under feathers 55 of night birds. Undoubtedly there are other sources
of supply from various bones and feathers, and research on this is going
on all the time. All red feathers moulted out by the numerous Touracos
at the Boehm aviaries are collected and forwarded, at irregular
intervals, to the recipient mentioned at the conclusion of this paper.
I have no information as to the method employed to extract this by-
product, but I have been advised that, after the uroporphyrin has been
extracted the feathers are almost colourless. This indicates that the red
colour is due to the presence of this material, itself reddish coloured, in
the feathers. Turacin has been named in the past as the source of this

red pigmentation, but this latest research shows that, although turacin
may be present, it is not the sole factor involved.
To return to the title subject, the nominate race of the White-
cheeked Touraco is to be found in Eritrea, through Abyssinia, to south-
east Sudan. The sexes are alike in colouring, the head, neck, back, and
breast being green. The crest is navy-blue and they have white
patches on the ears and in front of the eye. The eye is surrounded by
wattle-like bare skin of orange-red, the same colour as the bill. The
greater part of the flight feathers are crimson, the wing-coverts and
rump being blue-grey. The broad feathered tail is dark blue, the belly
grey, and the legs and feet are black. They are arboreal birds, spending
most of their time climbing around in the trees, the adaptability of the
foot, mentioned earlier, being a great asset. Normally they fly but short
distances, tree to tree, with a weak, dipping flight. It is at such times,
as they glide in to alight with outstretched wings, that the red in the
flights can be seen to the best advantage.
Their main diet is fruit, tree-buds, shoots, green leaves, and insects.
At normal times little attention is paid to mealworms but, when there
are young in the nest, they come to the ground like a fowl. At one feed
the male in this particular breeding was seen to take eighty-seven
mealworms and the female over seventy. After this repast they both
drank from the stream, collected fresh shoots off a cultivated honey-
suckle bush, and then up to the nest to feed their young by regurgi-
tation.
The pair at the Boehm aviaries, received in February, 1961, direct
from Africa, had four rounds in 1963 from which seven young were
reared to maturity. As each nesting was identical, even to being in the
same nest, the time-table pattern calls for but one description. The first
nesting was in April when the female selected a site about 10 feet up
in a White Pine. A very fragile nest of twigs, fitted into a crutch in
the branches, was prepared by the female alone, so, owing to its
insecure appearance, a wire-netting basket, about 12 inches across
with a central depression of 3 inches, was fitted where the twigs had
been arranged. The pieces of nesting material were placed back in this
structure in as near the same positions as was possible. Immediately
the ladder was removed, even before we had left the aviary, she was
there rearranging the twigs to her liking, and was soon adding more
to them.
The first egg was laid on 3rd April, with a second the following
day. They were plain white and averaged 41 by 33 mm. in size.
Incubation, lasting for seventeen to eighteen days, was shared, and it
was on the hatching of the first chick that another peculiarity of the
Touracos was revealed to us. The chick, on emerging from the shell,
resembled a precocial hatching for it was covered with a thick, black
down, and its eyes were beginning to open. However, despite these two

characteristics, it became apparent that they did not possess the high
degree of thermal control as with newly hatched nidifigous birds, for
both parents constantly brooded them the first nine days or so of their
existence. Their bills were pink, with a black tip, of the basic shape of
the adult bird, and their gapes were pink. The bill gradually darkened
until, at seven days old, it was only the base of the lower mandible
that was light coloured. As with the incubation, the rearing was
shared and it was now that the great consumption of mealworms
began. Either parent, the other staying on the nest, would descend to
the ground, collect as many mealworms as it appeared to require,
about thirty in the early days increasing to a near hundred as the
chicks grew, and then drinking and eating fresh shoots, as mentioned
earlier, prior to feeding the young.
It was noticed that the feeding at one session was undertaken by
one bird only, the other, on vacating the nest, normally spending its
time preening, bathing, and feeding itself. Live-food was distributed to
them hourly during the hours of daylight, and seldom were they seen
feeding the nestlings other than at these times. Quills were showing in
the wings at five days, the tail commencing to show at nine. By the
twelfth day, white barrings were showing in the wings and, by nineteen
days old the young birds began crawling around on the branches in the
immediate vicinity of the nest. It was now that the parent birds left
them to themselves for periods of thirty minutes or so, this interval
increasing as the nestlings further progressed. Red flight feathers were
visible at three weeks old and they fledged at twenty-five days. Now it
could be seen that, in addition to the colour in the flights, green was
showing on the neck, the remainder of the plumage being dull blackish-
green. It is considered that the young birds were capable of finding
their way around from the nest at a much earlier age for, since this
breeding, a young Knysna Touraco travelled over 50 feet at the
tender age of seven days and carried on roaming around the aviary with
its parents from that time on. This little episode will, no doubt, be
covered in greater detail in a later paper dealing with our 1964
breedings.
At seven weeks old the young White-cheeked Touracos were seen to
be eating leaves of the honeysuckle and, from then on, could be
regarded as self-supporting, although they never ate mealworms, a diet
not now sought by their parents either. A white cheek-patch was now
beginning to show, although the surround of the eyes and the bill were
still dark coloured. It was at six and a half weeks that a white mark
showed before the eyes, this becoming a distinct patch by the time they
had reached sixty-five days old, by which time the head and breast had
acquired adult colouring. However, it was not until after the eleventh
week that the bill and eye circle began to change, the full adult appear-
ance of the eye being attained at 108 days, but the bill did not complete

its change for a further four weeks. In all, a period of 136 days elapsed
from the time of vacating the nest to their assuming full, mature
colouring.
Whilst all this had been going on the parents had nested again,
and two more young Touracos were flying around. In fact they nested
in April, June, August, and October, raising seven young in all. It
should be mentioned here that it was necessary to remove the indepen-
dent young birds as soon as the next round hatched, as the adult male
began persecuting them.
It is known that this species of Touraco has been bred in captivity
before, but it is felt that the information contained above might be of
general interest to those who have not had the opportunity of seeing an
earlier report.
I would like to add that I am indebted to P. W. Bickerton, B.Sc.,
of Koch-Light Laboratories, Ltd., Colnbrook, Bucks, England, for the
data regarding the properties of the red flight feathers, and it is to
that firm that our collections of feathers are dispatched to further them
in their good work.

The summer of 1964 proved remarkably dry except for some rainfall
during June with the result that the breeding season was comparatively
trouble-free. A total of 276 birds of twenty forms was bred in the
Trust's collection.
Both Temminck's and Cabot's Tragopan produced chicks and those
of the latter included a cock bird, the first to be reared in the collection ;
two hens were also produced. The original pair of imported Cabot's
Tragopan was made into a trio by the addition of an extra female for
the second season running but without any success. The four eggs laid
by the old hen were all fertile while those produced by the new bird
were all clear.
Twenty Blue Eared and one Brown Eared Pheasant were reared
but of the former only four turned out to be males. There are now
seven pairs of this species in the collection. Swinhoe's again had a
successful season and a further eighteen birds were reared to add to
those awaiting shipment to Taiwan where they will be released in a
protected area to reinforce the depleted wild stock.
Elliot's, Koklass, Tonkinese Red Junglefowl, and Cyprus Rock
Partridge were reared in smaller numbers while all the commoner
species bred freely.

28 P. WAYRE-NEWS FROM THE ORNAMENTAL PHEASANT TRUST
Among the smaller game birds perhaps the most notable success
was the breeding of eight European Quail from wild-caught birds
imported from Spain under special licence.
Research into the taxonomic relationship of Common and Japanese
Quail continues and recordings have been made of the calls of both
races and of their hybrids. Trouble from fighting amongst young quail
has occurred from the age of six weeks onwards and a range of specially
designed batteries has been constructed so that individuals can be kept
separate except when paired during the breeding season.
The Trust has assisted the International Council for Bird Preserva-
tion with much information concerning those species of pheasant
threatened with extinction in the wild with the result that fifteen
species considered to be in danger now appear in the I.C.B.P. Red
Book list.
The Trust's collection of game birds now numbers 445 individuals of
forty-two different forms. It is not, however, our policy merely to amass
as many species as possible for it is considered of far greater importance
that a really sound nucleus of breeding stock of those species in danger of
extinction should be maintained. Many tropical pheasants are unsuit-
able for large-scale propagation in this climate and though they will be
represented whenever possible in the collection the main work with
them will have to be left to those lucky enough to live in warmer parts
of the world. It is worth noting that of the fifteen species on the Red
Book list only four can be considered tropical in this sense and of them
one, Edwards's Pheasant, is hardy and breeds well in our climate.
It seems probable that the Trust's work in the future will concen-
trate more and more on building up numbers of hardy species en-
dangered in the wild. Eight of the fifteen species on the Red Book list
are represented in the collection and already six of them have been
bred successfully at the Trust so that finance may well prove the one
factor which will ultimately limit the scale and permanence of our
work.
It would not be fitting to end this short report without mentioning
the good work being achieved in this field by some of our members with
such species as Elliot's, Edwards's and Hume's Bar-tailed Pheasant.

The fine summer lasting well into the autumn led to increased
attendances at the Park. Close on 100,000 visitors included 10,000
school children in organized parties during the summer term.
A pair of Rheas received as young birds from Frankfurt Zoo in
1962 produced a total of twenty-one eggs, the first eight to be laid
were set in a still-air incubator run at ioo*F. on 14th July, and four
chicks hatched on 22nd August after an incubation period of thirty-
nine days. The fresh eggs averaged 1 lb. 7 oz. in weight and the newly-
hatched young averaged 13! oz. each. They did well on a diet of
turkey pellets and chopped green food. One further chick was hatched
from the next clutch, the remaining eggs proving infertile. All five
young Rheas have grown well and are thriving.
Snowy Owls again laid three eggs but the young disappeared within
hours of hatching, presumably eaten by the female owl. It is planned to
remove any eggs laid next year half-way through the incubation
period, and to attempt to hatch and rear the young artificially.
A pair of European Eagle-Owls went to nest at the end of February,
laying three eggs in a shallow box fixed high up in their shelter and
lined with turf and pine needles. The female commenced to incubate
on 1 st March and on 6th April two youngsters hatched giving an
incubation period of thirty-six days. Their food, consisting of raw hare
and rabbit was immediately increased and the two young owls thrived.
On 23rd May they were taken from the nest to be photographed,
though still covered with down, their wing and tail feathers were well
grown. It was not until 21st June, seventy-six days after hatching, that
the first youngster left the shelter and came out into the flight but even
at this age it was scarcely able to fly.
As a result of a conversation with Mr. Kai Curry-Lindahl at the
Bird of Prey Conference at Caen in April, it was decided to offer this
young pair of Eagle-Owls as a gift to the Swedish Authorities to assist
their scheme for the reintroduction of this bird into Swedish forests
where in some areas it has become extinct. The offer was accepted and
at the time of writing the young owls await shipment by air to Stock-
holm.
Upon arrival at their destination they will be taken to a remote part
of the forest where it is desired to re-establish this species. They will be
put to breed in a large aviary and their progeny will in due course be
released. The parent birds will always remain captive as it has been
found in practice that the best way is to release the young in the autumn
but to continue to feed them for at least a further month on the top of
the aviary. They gradually learn to become independent and eventu-
ally take up their territory in the surrounding forest.

30 M. F. COUPE--BIRDS BRED AT CHESTER ZOO, 1 964
Little Owls made two nests beneath an old tree stump in their aviary,
then both laid a clutch of eggs at the same time, so that after two
changes of mate for the original bird we still have two females !
The walk-through aviary for smaller British birds continues to be
very popular with the public and despite the number and variety of
inhabitants and the preponderance of males there has been some
breeding. Blackbirds reared one youngster and Bullfinches five in two
broods. A new and much bigger walk-through aviary is at present
under construction for larger British and European birds. In it we hope
to establish a breeding colony of Lesser Kestrels which have recently
been received from Spain, as well as some of the smaller waders.
The wader pool has been much improved by the addition of a
shingle ridge made of stones brought from the Norfolk coast. The
sea-lyme grass on the dunes has spread giving plenty of cover. Both
Common Curlew and Oystercatchers laid scattered eggs, some of
which were hatched under bantams.
Two hundred and thirty-four waterfowl of twenty-eight different
kinds were reared in the Park. They included three Cereopsis and thirty
Emperor Geese.
Nest-boxes were occupied by Tree and House Sparrows, Blue and
Great Tits, and a pair of Tawny Owls.
Recent arrivals include a pair of Capercaillie, four Black-winged
Stilts, ten Lesser Kestrels, six Siskins, one Golden Plover, two pairs of

Although the first birds to be given their liberty in the Tropical
House were only released in June of this year, many have hatched
youngsters or started nesting activities. Numerous young Red-eared
Waxbills and Cordon-Bleus can be seen, but the most satisfactory l
breeding was that of a Pin-tailed Whydah (Vidua macroura ).
This species of Whydah is parasitic upon certain Waxbills and ours
laid in the nest of a Red-eared Waxbill. The nest was left entirely alone
and keepers reported their first sighting of a solitary young Pin-tailed
Whydah towards the end of August. The youngster closely resembles
the female, except that it has a light orange coloured bill.
A pair of Scaly-breasted Lorikeets (Trichoglossus chlorolepidotus) have
been accommodated in the Bird House since J uly, 1959. They can be
viewed either from inside the house, where they have a heated, glass-
fronted flight, or in their spacious outdoor aviary, bordered by flower

our usual practice, they were not disturbed in any way. Towards the
end of July a young one was heard calling for food and finally left the
nest on 17th September.

By J. J. Yealland
Four specimens of the Nilgiri Wood Pigeon (Columba elphinstoni ), a
species new to the collection, have been presented. This pigeon
inhabits south-western parts of India, and Jerdon says, that it frequents
dense woods, singly or in small parties of five or six, feeding on various
fruits and buds and occasionally on small snails, to procure which it
descends to the mossy banks. The nest is a typical one of twigs and
only one egg or chick has been found in the nests examined.
Other presentations of particular interest are three Spotted Tina-
mous (Nothura maculosa) from Mr. Tom Spence who bred them, two
Chinese Pond Herons, four Eastern Cattle Egrets, and two Grey-
headed Gallinules from Dr. K. C. Searle, a Woodcock found in
London during foggy weather and a Plum-headed Parrakeet.
Two Spoonbills, four Tufted Guineafowl (jV. meleagris ), and a
Snowy Owl have been received in exchange and two Chinese Necklace
Doves have been bred in the Gardens from parents received from Dr.
Searle early in June.
In 1959 Dr. Wackernagel wrote in the Magazine (p. 20) on the
feeding to birds of a canthaxanthin preparation manufactured in
Basel and used for the colouring of human foodstuffs such as margarine.
As a result of giving this preparation in the food of certain birds here
the Scarlet Ibises, Cock of the Rock, and a Yellow-backed Sunbird have
had the natural colour of the plumage restored, the most striking
example being the sunbird whose normally red areas were, before the
moult, a dull pale brown.

Linnaeus or Linne ? A correspondent asks why sometimes one name
is used and sometimes the other. Carolus Linnaeus (1707-1778), the
great Swedish botanist who founded the system of classifying plants,
was the son of Nils Ingemarsson. It was customary in those days for
persons to Latinize the patronymic name or to adopt a Latin name.
Thus, when the young Ingemarsson began his University career he
adapted the Latin name of the Linden or lime-tree. In 1761 Carolus
Linnaeus was made a Knight of the Polar Star and with ennoblement
changed his name to the more aristocratic-sounding Swedish Carl von
Linne. His great books were, of course, written in Latin so he naturally
used this form of his name. Incidentally, of all authors, Linnaeus alone
is recognizable merely by the initial letter of his surname.

Possibly of all parrot-like birds the little Senegal Parrot could be
considered to make the most endearing pet, but anyone who has ever
had a Caique of any kind would surely dispute this suggestion. Unfor-
tunately, but comparatively few people have had an opportunity of
keeping even a single Caique, so that as far as Great Britain is con-
cerned even breeding attempts have been but few. The only complete
success was obtained by the late Lady Poltimore in 1936, when she had
one young Black-headed X White-bellied reared. In America, however,
just one or two aviculturists have been successful, notably Gilbert Lee
who reared three White-bellied in 1932. By far the most successful
breeder is Mrs. Frank Williams, of Princeton, Florida. Since 1957 she
has been breeding the Black-headed and now has no less than thirty-
four, including several that are second generation bred in captivity.

It is almost impossible to imagine anyone keeping Gannets Sula
bassana, let alone breeding them, but such was the feat of E. T. Booth,
in 1880 and 1881. Booth had very considerable experience with these
birds both in the wild and in captivity. He kept a number in the garden
of his house in Dyke Road, Brighton (where the Booth Museum is now
housed) and it was there that they bred. On 1st July, 1880, one egg was

very full account, in diary form, in Rough Notes, vol. Ill, 1881-87.

A NEW DICTIONARY OF BIRDS. Edited by Sir A. Landsborough
</sectionHeader>

Thomson. Thomas Nelson and Son, Ltd., Edinburgh, 1964. Price
5 guineas net.
The study of birds continues to attract a wider and wider public,
judging by the number of books and other publications devoted to the
subject. It is all the more surprising, therefore, that, until now, the only
really comprehensive work of reference on birds, A Dictionary of Birds, by
Professor Alfred Newton, F.R.S., assisted by Dr. Hans Gadow, F.R.S.,
was published in 1896. Whilst the title of the present work reflects this
prototype, it is in no sense a revision of that famous classic of ornitho-
logical literature but an entirely new undertaking. It is differently
conceived, is less historical in its approach, and is the work of more than
200 contributors--authors, artists, and photographers--from every
part of the world. It was one of three enterprises planned at the
Centenary of the British Ornithologists' Union in 1959, and was under-
taken as a service to ornithology. The contributors, like the Editor,
have worked in a purely honorary capacity and all royalties will accrue
to the B.O.U. under its agreement with the publishers. These proceeds
will be set aside as the nucleus of an endowment for ornithological
research and special publications.
The dictionary proper is preceded by a brief survey of the major
articles on general subjects, which are more suitable for deliberate
reading as distinct from quick reference. Then follows a list of major
articles on bird groups and the system of classification, which is that
adopted in the Check-list of Birds of the World, by the late J. L. Peters and
his successors. Finally there is a list of contributors arranged alpha-
betically by surnames and the editorial introduction.
The book is intended for readers of very different kinds : the general
reader who wishes to extend his knowledge of birds ; the ornithologist
wanting information outside his particular field ; and the biologist
who wishes to draw upon the specialized subject-matter of ornithology.
A certain amount of background information from other branches of
science is also included such as climate and vegetation, environmental
factors affecting bird-life, and more general subjects such as evolution,

genetics, and the application of statistical methods. Birds in human
culture will be of interest to all types of readers as it includes such
subjects as folk-lore, literature, and the arts.
Some idea of the scope of the dictionary may be indicated by listing
the titles on a page opened at random--" Locus, Locust-Bird, Logger-
head, Logrunner, Longclaw, Longevity, Longitude, Longspur, Long-
tail, Loomery, Loon, Lore, Loriinae, Lorikeet, Lory, Lotus-Bird,
Lourie, Louse-flies, Lovebird, Lowan, Limbar, Lung, Lure, Lym-
phatic vessels, Lyrebird. 53
In addition there are sixteen colour plates specially chosen to
illustrate general aspects, and thirty-two black-and-white plates
(photographs) selected primarily to illustrate different activities of birds,
and a selection of birds of many families and from various parts of the
world. There are also numerous text-figures.
This " New Dictionary 55 is a worthy successor to Alfred Newton's
well-known volume, and as a comprehensive reference work will be
indispensable to any ornithological library. Ornithologists throughout
the world owe a debt of gratitude to the British Ornithologists 5 Union
and especially to the editor for the production of such a landmark in
bird literature.

illustrations by Donald Watson. Oxford University Press,
London, 1964. Price355.net.
So many books on British birds have been published recently that it
would be thought that saturation point had almost been reached, but
the Oxford Book of Birds cannot in anyway be regarded as superfluous.
Written in a clear and lucid way by that well-known field ornithologist
Bruce Campbell and with excellent illustrations by Donald Watson,
this joint production by two Scots reaches a high standard of merit.
In the introduction it is stated that the book describes every bird
which has ever been authentically recorded in the British Isles, even
if only once or twice. Consequently, most of the birds of western Europe
are included in the text and often in the illustrations too, and also the
American visitors whose increase in recent years has been so remarkable.
The descriptions of the various species contain a great deal of informa-
tion precisely presented and a simple device used to show in which
months of the year a bird can be seen in Britain, in which months eggs
or young in the nest may be expected, and the months when song can be
heard, by using different types and underlining for the number of the
month is most helpful. The book opens with notes on classification
and at the end are chapters on flight, anatomy, behaviour, breeding,
and migration.

The ninety-six colour plates show the birds in their natural setting
which is an added help to identifying them when seen in the field.
There are also a number of attractive black-and-white drawings
illustrating flight, display, feeding, and so on.

YELLOW GOLDEN PHEASANTS
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.988971684210526" page_id="56365659"  page_num="36" year="" vol="">
In order to save Mr. McCance and other breeders in Australia time and trouble I
hasten to write to assure Mr. McCance that there is no connection genetically between
the yellow Golden Pheasant and other Golden Pheasants with yellow bands or other
yellow markings on the breast. The yellow Golden is a true recessive mutant, and
behaves exactly like all other recessive mutants, i.e. when mated to a normal Golden
Pheasant it will produce nothing but normals. If the yellow parent is mated back to its
own sons or daughters from this first mating, approximately 50 per cent Yellows will be
produced. None of the birds that are split for the Yellow factor (i.e. the progeny of the
first mating) shows any outward sign that it carries this factor. If there is any yellow on
the breast this is quite unconnected with the yellow Golden, and only means that the
strain was not pure in the first instance.
The yellow Golden Pheasant breeds true, and cannot throw any normals, being
a true recessive. Neither does it produce any parti-coloured birds. The yellow-
banded Golden Pheasant and other Golden Pheasants with varying amounts of yellow
on the breast in spots or patches (however much Mr. McCance may care to persuade
himself to the contrary) are the direct result of a crossing with Amhersts, possibly many
generations back. However many times these birds are bred together and selected for
a large amount of yellow, they will never produce a Yellow Golden Pheasant.

THE WHITE PEAFOWL OF AHMEDABAD
By Sir Godfrey Davis (Boughton Monchelsea, Kent, England)
I first knew Ahmedabad in 1914 when it was a comparatively small

town of 350,000 people, but nevertheless of some importance as a
centre of the textile industry. Now it is a city of over one million people
with more than sixty textile mills. Many of its inhabitants are Jains
who regard all life as sacred, and, indeed, so tame and unmolested
were the birds and beasts that some few miles out of the city, one could
ride past a herd of lovely blackbuck, and so tame were they that they
would not even trouble to move as one rode by. Birds were similarly
unmolested and tame and peacocks semi-sacred and semi-domestic
would dance before the domestic fowls in the compounds and
bungalows.
Similarly in what we used to call the " Field of Ants " one could see
the pious shopkeepers stopping from time to time and stooping
apparently to dust something on the ground. This was rice-flour to
feed the ants and especially in cold weather, say, from November to
February, the migrants from the north would assemble here. There
were wagtails by the hundreds--a smaller species than the Pied--
which was also there--I did not identify. The adult male had yellow
breast and dark olive-green cap and greyish-green back. With many
young birds, generally grey in colour, all these birds would quarter the
ground feeding on the small brown ants the pious so regularly fed
throughout the year. Mynas, Hoopoes, migrant Redstarts, and the
Indian Brown-backed Robin would join in the feast while Red-backed
Shrikes from their vantage points on cactus hedges would pounce on
the unfortunate beetle or other insects. The lovely Sarus Crane with
its loud echoing cry would fly low overhead and the Ring-necked
Parrakeets would fly in fast-moving flocks between the great trees.
Much is now changed and only on my last visit, in 1964, it was
reported that the police searched the house of a Muslim (who do not
regard life as sacred) and found over 100,000 peacock feathers,
presumably the lovely eyed feathers of the train. No herds of black-
buck are to be found within 80 miles of the city ; they have been

slaughtered and sold for meat in the bazaar. Besides the few in the Zoo
paddock and a few in a garden attached to the prison the only black-
buck in Ahmedabad is in harness and draws a children's go-cart in the
Zoo. But it was about some of the birds in this Zoo which I set out
to write, more especially the white peafowl.
The Zoo is a municipal zoo ; it is not a large one and owes a great
deal, indeed as does the city itself, to the enthusiasm and knowledge
of its Superintendent, Mr. Reuben David who is not only a great bird
and animal lover and exceedingly competent superintendent but also a
skilled musician and learned in the art of Indian music. So far as the
Zoo proper is concerned--apart from the Children's Zoo--Mr.
David's outlook was well expressed in his statement in response to a
remark of mine, that he first thought of the birds and then of the
visitors. The Zoo at Ahmedabad is also fortunate in that the city
stands on the banks of the Sabarmati River--one of those great rivers
which do so much to beautify and indeed to water this thirsty land--
whence comes for the Zoo unlimited quantities of coarse silver sand,
which is used lavishly for the aviaries and seems to keep them always
fresh and clean.
What struck me most about the aviaries is their spaciousness. For
instance, the aviary in which the flock of adult white peafowl is kept
is 60 feet long and 34 feet wide ; it is gable-roofed and is 11 feet high
at the apex and 6 feet at the eaves ; there is a cement plinth 1 ft. 6 in.
high and of similar depth in the ground, and the wire netting is of fine
but strong thin wire, made in Bombay ; each mesh of \ inch is made up
of an attractive weave of five or six strands of this strong thin wire.
Oleanders and bamboos are freely planted in the aviaries and what
particularly attracted me were the laying shelters for the peafowl.
One of these is quite a massive affair ; it faces one entrance and is to
one side of the aviary. It is 10 feet long by 14 feet deep but is divided
lengthwise down the centre, so each shelter in effect measures 10 feet
long by 7 feet deep. The fronts of the shelters can be closed by wire-
netted doors, so when the birds are sitting the doors can, if necessary,
be shut against intruders. The top of this shelter, and indeed of other
shelters is enclosed by a plinth about 4 inches deep so that the birds can
use this as a place to dust themselves or as a look-out.
All hens which lay do not necessarily go broody--mostly it is the
older birds that go broody--so the eggs which are laid outside the
laying shelters are collected and six are placed under each broody
peafowl hen. In this way forty young were reared in 1964 and they sell
for 600 rupees a pair--a rupee equals is. 6 d. The young for the first few
days are fed on hardboiled eggs mixed with that great standby of
Indian bird-lovers, parched gram flour, and then brought on to that
other famous standby, about which I have previously written, finely-
chopped bullocks' kidney mixed with parched gram flour and fried for a

few minutes in ghee or clarified butter. But I suppose here turkey-
crumbs and pellets would serve equally well.
In this same aviary was another laying-shelter--they are rather
massive affairs of brick and cement--which measures 18 feet in length
by 6 ft. 9 in. in depth and 3 ft. 4 in. in height with a plinth 5 inches
deep which contains a dusting floor and a place for rest and look-out.
Again the front of the shelter can be closed by doors.
The aviary for the young birds is also large and spacious, the floor
covered thickly with sand from the river bed, frequently swept and
renewed ; it measures 52 feet in length and because of the varying
width of the site measures from 26 feet narrowing to 18 feet in width.
It is similarly provided with laying shelters which are also used by the
birds as shelter from the sun and the monsoon rains.
So much for peafowl. The other birds are equally well looked after.
There is one aviary much the same height as the others but measuring
50 by 50 feet and which is divided likewise into two equal parts,
so that each aviary is 25 feet wide. In one there is planted, about 6 feet
from the sides of the aviary, a hibiscus hedge, so that there is formed a
shaded enclosure and within this is a pond where a pair of Mandarin
ducks live and breed in a small kennel-like structure raised a few feet
from the ground with access by a ladder. In this aviary are Bulbuls,
Yuhinas, and Zosterops in lovely bright plumage due, I suppose,
partly to the damp humid climate and hot sun. These and other
insectivorous and frugivorous birds are fed on fruit, plantain and
papaya mainly, and chouga, the insectivorous food to which I have
referred. I saw Fairy Bluebirds in exquisite condition and Golden
Orioles with the deep golden plumage of the wild birds all so fed.
Other aviaries--I thought of an ideal size both for smaller birds
and for a pair of pheasants--measure 15 by 30 feet in breadth and
length respectively and in these aviaries there were laying shelters but
with a variation. These were two-storeyed shelters, so on the roof of the
first storey the birds could dust and sun themselves and shelter from the
monsoon rains and in some cases the roof of the second storey had a
surrounding plinth so that there were two roofs on which the birds
could sun themselves. Small outlets in the topmost plinths allowed
the water from the monsoon rains to escape, though in the monsoon all
the aviaries were partially covered with bamboo matting, to lessen the
impact of the heavy monsoon rains.

SOME BIRDS OF THE NORTHERN TERRITORY
OF AUSTRALIA

<bodyText confidence="0.996216102564102" page_id="56365705"  page_num="40" year="" vol="">
By Alan Lendon (Adelaide, S. Australia)
The publication of Michael Sharland's book, A Territory of Birds ,
coinciding with the Adelaide Festival of Arts early in 1964, was the
stimulus necessary to bring to fruition a long contemplated visit to this
area. As a result, a recently undertaken trip by three well-known local
ornithologists and the writer produced many observations which
should be of interest to readers of the Avicultural Magazine.
The trip lasted three weeks and one day, and was only just long
enough to give a reasonable picture of the avian population. It was
timed for the end of July and beginning of August, which is about the
middle of the 44 dry " season at 44 the top end " as the northern tropical
part of the Territory is called. The weather experienced was quite
perfect, day temperatures in Darwin being about 90* F. with a low
humidity, whilst the nights were mild, although somewhat airless.
Further south, the days were very similar but the nights were frequently
bitterly cold. The whole of the centre of Australia from Port Augusta
to well north of Tennant Creek, is in the grip of a severe drought of
several years duration, and in consequence dust storms are frequent
and severe, and we were unfortunate enough to encounter one on the
afternoon of our only complete day at Alice Springs.
We drove by car to Port Augusta, some 200 miles north of Adelaide.
From there we proceeded by train to Alice Springs where we unloaded
the car. In the next three days we reached Darwin, a further 950 miles,
with overnight stops at Renner Springs and Mataranka. We then
stayed a week in Darwin, doing trips of up to a 50-mile radius from
there each day. We then started southward again, our first stop being
for three nights at Pine Creek (150 miles), which we used as a base for
two trips to the western fringes of Arnhem Land, some 60 miles to the
east. Thereafter, two nights and the intervening day were spent at
Mataranka, a further night at Renner Springs, and two nights and the
intervening day at Alice Springs. The total mileage done by the car
for the trip was 3,400, without the semblance of any mechanical
trouble, and in addition, we travelled 750 miles in each direction by
train between Port Augusta to Alice Springs.
For the trip 242 species were identified, of which 212 were seen only in
the Northern Territory. From a personal point of view, no less than
seventy were new birds in the wild state to the writer. It is not proposed
to mention every species seen but to comment only on those of out-
standing interest.

exquisite little bird, was surprisingly tame and easy to see, unlike most
fruit pigeons, which are frequently heard and seldom seen. Particularly
good views of this species were obtained in the Darwin Botanical
Gardens. The Green-winged Pigeon (Chalcophaps chrysochlora ) was only
seen on a few occasions and proved to be remarkably shy and elusive.
Bar-shouldered Doves (Geopelia humeralis ) were common everywhere
north of Mataranka and frequented all types of country, including man-
groves. The Peaceful Dove (G. placida ) was widespread in the higher
rainfall areas, whilst conversely, the Diamond Dove (G. cuneata) was
restricted to the drier regions.

River, we flushed, from dry grass, a large flock, comprising some forty to
fifty birds, of the Partridge Pigeon ( Geophaps smithi), which was
formerly well known in captivity in Adelaide but has gradually
disappeared from local aviaries. In the same area, inhabiting the sand-
stone bluffs, we found some numbers of the rarely observed Chestnut-
quilled Rock Pigeon ( Petrophassa rujipennis) , an attractive and unusual
species which was represented in the Adelaide Zoo many years ago
and was successfully bred there on several occasions.
Crested Pigeons ( Ocyphaps lophotes) were widely distributed, particu-
larly in the drier areas, whilst Common Bronzewings ( Phaps chalcoptera)
were only seen in a restricted area near Mataranka. Perhaps the most
attractive of all was the delightful little Plumed Pigeon (. Lophophaps
plumifera ), of which we only saw a pair and a party of five in the
vicinity of Renner Springs.

</subsubsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.987206827586207" page_id="56365707"  page_num="42" year="" vol="">
Psittacines were extremely numerous, although the total number of
species seen was not large. The commonest species was undoubtedly
the Red-collared Lorikeet ( Trichoglossus rubritorquis) , which was in vast
numbers at " the top end ", in pairs and small flocks, feeding mainly on
the attractive orange blossom of the local woolly-butt (. Eucalyptus
miniata). The Varied Lorikeet ( Psitteuteles versicolor) was not nearly as
plentiful as we had expected, although ultimately we came on two
large congregations in the vicinity of Mataranka. The naked skin
round the eye, unusual in Lorikeets and reminiscent of some of the
African Lovebirds, is very noticeable in the field.
Red-tailed Black Cockatoos ( Calyptorhynchus magnijicus) were seen near
Alice Springs in small numbers, but were particularly numerous in the
north in small parties and in flocks of up to fifty birds. They were seen
feeding on eucalyptus nuts and were often flushed from the ground,
when the brilliant colouring of the tail feathers was seen to particular
advantage. The Sulphur-crested Cockatoos (. Kakatoe galerita) differed
from the southern birds in that they occurred in only ones and twos and
were surprisingly silent. Two captive specimens examined had very
pale blue skin around the eyes and rather long crests, suggesting a
close affinity with the New Guinea birds (if. triton ). Little Corellas
(if. sanguined) were in very large flocks which seemed never to leave the
margins of lagoons, while the Galah (if. roseicapilla) was seen in all
types of country, those in the extreme north being noticeably smaller
and paler.
Cockatiels (. Leptolophus hollandicus) were numerous in small flocks over
an area between Newcastle Waters and Adelaide River and Red-
winged Parrots ( Aprosmictus erythropterus) were in large numbers every-
where north of Warlock Ponds. They appeared to be really red-winged
as opposed to the crimson-winged birds of Eastern Australia.

One of the author's personal highlights was the finding of the
Northern Rosella ( Platycercus venustus). Only twelve birds were seen,
all but two of them between Pine Creek and El Sherana to the eastward.
They were singularly un-Rosella-like in behaviour, being relatively
silent and always found in trees, rather than being flushed from the
ground, as is so common with other members of the genus. Port
Lincoln Parrots ( Barnardius zonarius) were numerous in the vicinity of
Alice Springs where a number of Mulga (Many-coloured) Parrots
(.Psephotus varius) were also seen.
A great disappointment was the failure to find the Hooded Parrot
(.Psephotellus dissimilis) , said to be reasonably common in the vicinity of
Pine Creek, where suitable termite mounds are plentiful. Another
disappointment resulted from an attempt to see Bourke Parrots
(Neophema hourki), which were reputed to water at daybreak at a dam
near Alice Springs ; this failure may have well been due to arriving
on the scene a little too late, owing to inaccurate directions. Finally,
Budgerygahs ( Melopsittacus undulatus) were extremely numerous over a
fairly limited area, mainly between Newcastle Waters and Mataranka.
Kingfishers, etc.
These proved to be extremely plentiful, especially in the far north.
The Blue-winged Kookaburra ( Dacslo leachi) was widely distributed
north of Warlock Ponds ; it is very much more colourful than the
southern bird and its laugh is entirely different. The Sacred ( Halcyon
sanctus) and Red-backed (//. pyrrhopygius ) were widely distributed,
particularly the latter. The vivid blue Forest Kingfisher ( H . macleayi)
was mainly in the tropical areas, whilst the large greenish Mangrove
(H. chloris) was, as the name implies, confined to the coastal area.
A solitary Azure ( Alcyone azurea) was observed on the Waterhouse
River, near Mataranka whilst one of the party obtained several
fleeting glimpses of the Little (A. pusilla) at Berry Springs.
The Australian Bee-eater ( Merops ornatus) was extremely numerous
and widely spread throughout the tropical areas.

A relatively small number of species were observed, but several of
them were of outstanding interest. The Pied Goose ( Anseranas semi-
palmato ) was widely dispersed, but on only two occasions did we see the
large flocks that we had anticipated. Likewise, the Green Pygmy
Goose [Nettapus pulchellus) was found wherever there was suitable water,
but the numbers were not large, the biggest flock comprising some
seventy birds quite close to Darwin. This is a most attractive little bird
and is very tame. Flocks of the Whistling Tree-Duck (. Dendrocygna
arcuata) were met with on three occasions, each time numbering

<bodyText confidence="0.966498414634146" page_id="56365709"  page_num="44" year="" vol="">
several hundred birds. One of the highlights was the finding of a flock
of between thirty and forty of the relatively uncommon White-headed
Shelduck or Burdekin Duck ( Tadorna radjah). These were seen at
Harrison's Dam, near Humpty Doo, and were remarkably tame, some
refusing to leave the shore and walking slowly away from us, whilst
others paddled about a short distance offshore. Unlike most shelduck,
there is no obvious difference between the sexes. The only other
anatidae seen were three species commonly met with in the south,
viz. Black Duck (Anas superciliosa) , Grey Teal (Querquedula gibberifrons)
and White-eyed Duck (Nyroca australis). An unusual incident occurred
when a flock of nine Grey Teal landed on bare ground at the side of
the main highway, just in front of our approaching car.
Birds of Prey
Members of this order were very numerous throughout, no less than
eighteen species being identified. However, in an account such as this,
only a few notables warrant mentioning. The outstanding species
was the magnificent Black-breasted Buzzard ( Hamirostra melanosterna)
of which we saw six examples. This bird, Australia's third largest hawk,
is quite unmistakable in flight because of the large, pale-coloured
" windows " in its wings.
A magnificent specimen of the White Goshawk (Astur novae-hollandiae)
was seen near El Sherana and allowed easy observation as it merely
flushed from one tree to an adjacent one. Other notables were Spotted
Harriers (Circus assimilis), White-breasted Sea-Eagles (Haliaetus leuco-
gaster ), and Red-backed Sea-Eagles (Haliastur indus) , the last named the
familiar Brahminy Kite of the East.
Sundry Large Birds
This aggregation, although completely unrelated, forms a useful
gathering together. A solitary Emu (Dromaius novae-hollandiae) was seen
on the trip ; it appeared to be keeping company with a wild donkey !
Only four Pelicans (Pelecanus conspicillatus) were seen and they were
widely separated. The Australian Bustard (Eupodotis australis) , was
seen on four occasions, a pair and a single bird near Mataranka and an
immature bird near Tennant Creek. This bird was ridiculously con-
fiding and made us realize how easily and frequently these birds are
shot, although fully protected. Shortly after this, we were not amused

carrying the head of a very recently decapitated bird of this species !
Brolgas ( Megalornis rubicundus) were extraordinarily numerous in
suitable areas, whilst Jabirus ( Xenorhynchus asiaticus) were seen on nine
occasions, almost always solitary birds.

<bodyText confidence="0.96934675" page_id="56365710"  page_num="45" year="" vol="">
Eleven species were identified, the notables being the Great-billed
Heron ( Ardea sumatrana) , of which two, possibly three, were seen on
the Waterhouse River, near Mataranka ; the Pied Heron ( Notophoyx
aruensis) an attractive small bird of navy blue and white plumage, of
which only three specimens were recorded ; the Reef Heron ( Demigretta
sacra), of which several, mainly of the grey phase and a single white
bird, were seen on the Darwin beaches, and lastly, the Plumed Egret
(Egretta intermedia ), which is rare in Southern Australia, was by far the
commonest of the three white egrets which were present. In passing, it
is perhaps worthy of note that the Straw-necked Ibis ( Carphibis
spinicollis) , which is extremely common, competes with the Fork-tailed
Kite as a scavenger.
Quails and Bustard Quails
Several Brown Quail ( Synoicus australis) and a single Little Quail
(Turnix velox) were seen. The highlight of this group was the sighting,
in three separate localities, of a Bustard Quail, which we feel certain
was the Chestnut-backed ( Turnix castanotum), a bird unknown to avi-
culturists. The diagnostic feature, seen in the brief glimpse of the bird
at rest, was the massive bill ; in flight, the dark reddish brown upper
parts were obvious.

Waders

<bodyText confidence="0.981508315789474" page_id="56365710"  page_num="45" year="" vol="">
At that time of the year, most of the migratory waders were in the
Northern Hemisphere, but quite a few stragglers were seen. Notable
amongst these were a pair of Terek Sandpipers ( Xenus cinereus) easily
identified by their orange-red legs, long upturned bill, and extremely
rapid movements, and a number of Large Sand Dotterels ( Charadrius
leschenaulti) . The Masked Plover ( Lobibyx miles) replaces the Spur-
winged Plover (L. novae-hollandiae) of the south and was not as numerous
as we had expected. It was always in the vicinity of lagoons and dams
and was only observed at the extreme " top end ". The fascinating
Lotus Bird or Jacana ( Irediparra gallinacea) was in reasonable numbers
wherever suitable growth of waterlilies occurred, and its progress on
the leaves was a never-ending attraction. We encountered vast
numbers of Australian Pratincoles ( Stiltia Isabella) at Humpty Doo and
small flocks in other places ; this species has been common and has
bred amongst the outer suburbs of Adelaide on several occasions in
recent summers.
Fantails, Flycatchers, and Robins
The charming little Rufous Fantail ( Rhipidura rufifrons) was seen on
three occasions only ; although a known migrant, the Darwin area

seemed a far cry from the Dandenong Ranges near Melbourne, where
the author had first encountered it. The Northern Fantail (R . setosa )
was common ; it was larger and duskier than the White-shafted
Fantail (R. flabellifera) of the south, which it obviously replaced.
The Leaden Flycatcher ( Myiagra rubecula) was widely spread every-
where from Mataranka northward ; the sexes differ markedly and the
wing-quivering habit is very noticeable. The closely allied Broadbilled
Flycatcher (M. ruficollis) was observed only in the mangroves near
Darwin ; in this species, the sexes are alike and closely resemble the
female Leaden.
One of the most striking birds of the whole trip was the magnificent
Shining Flycatcher ( Piezorhynchus alecto ). This bird was met with in a
variety of habitats north of Mataranka but always in close proximity to
water. The male is a uniform blue-black, whilst the female is even more
striking with blue-black head, reddish-brown back, and white
underparts.
Two close relations of the Brown Flycatcher or Jacky Winter
(Microeca fascinans ) which was seen between Newcastle Waters and
Pine Creek, were the Brown-tailed Flycatcher ( Microeca brunneicauda )
an insignificant little bird seen only in the immediate vicinity of Darwin
and the Lemon-breasted Flycatcher (M . flavigaster) which was common
everywhere north of Mataranka and which has a delightful song.
The Buff-sided Robin ( Poecilodryas cervinventris) was seen for the first
time in a dry, bamboo-lined creek on the Marrakai road. Here a pair
were delightfully tame and exhibited an unusual habit of elevating
their tails after alighting. Several more of these attractive birds were
subsequently seen but they were never as tame or confiding as the
first pair.

<bodyText confidence="0.999273066666667" page_id="56365711"  page_num="46" year="" vol="">
The Brown Whistler (. Pachycephala simplex ), which at first we found
difficult to distinguish from the Brown-tailed Flycatcher mentioned
above, was not uncommon in the mangroves and coastal scrub of the
Darwin area ; however, its song, which Sharland found so entrancing,
was not in evidence at all, possibly for a seasonal reason. One member
of the party had a brief and not very satisfying glimpse of a pair of the
large White-breasted Whistler (P. lanioides) in the mangroves near
Darwin, and subsequently a female was seen. Apart from the size
difference, the female closely resembles the female Rufous Whistler
(P. rufiventris) which was common in the north.
The Shrike-Thrushes were rather disappointing, being shy, relatively
silent and not nearly as plentiful as their southern relations. The
Brown ( Colluricincla brunnea) was the most frequently observed and we
did not think that, in the field, we could distinguish it from the Grey
(C. harmonica) of the south. The Little (C. parvula ) was only seen on a

the two species to be about twenty to one.
Both Trillers were common. The Varied ( Lalage leucomela ), which is
the larger, was only seen in the extreme north and was replaced quite
soon by the White-winged (L. tricolor ) which extended well down the
highway to as far as Renner Springs.
Some Unrelated Species
The Yellow Fig Bird {Sphecotheres flaviventris) was only observed in the
far north ; it was invariably found in moderately large, noisy flocks
feeding in trees and the contrast between the gaudy males and rather
drab, streaked females was very marked. The Red-breasted Babbler
(.Pomatostomus rubeculus) was plentiful almost everywhere from the
extreme north of South Australia right through to Darwin ; unlike its
southern relations, it was not seen in flocks of more than four birds.
The Crimson Chat ( Epthianura tricolor) was seen fairly frequently
from Alice Springs as far north as Pine Creek ; it presented a problem
in that a very small proportion were mature cock birds, however, it is
learnt from experience of the species in captivity, that there is an eclipse
plumage. No Orange Chats ( E . aurifrons) were seen, although the two
species very commonly occur together.
The Black-tailed Tree-Creeper ( Climacteris melanura) was compara-
tively plentiful in the eucalypt forest from Larrimah northward ; it is
a very dark coloured bird with a buff wing-stripe which is prominent
in flight. Near Alice Springs we saw examples of the White-browed
species (C. affinis). An allied bird, the White-winged Sittella ( Neositta
leucoptera ) was seen in small flocks on a few occasions only at the " top
end " ; it gives the impression of a predominantly black and white bird
with marked white wing-bars. Near Alice Springs its place was taken
by the Black-capped Sittella (JV. pileata), with orange wing-bars.
Wrens, Pardalotes, and Silvereyes
The Red-backed Wren ( Malurus melanocephalus) was plentiful
wherever suitable grassy country existed north of Warlock Ponds, only
a small proportion were males in their brilliant red and black livery.
Near Tennant Creek we found the Purple-backed Wren (M. assimilis)
and in the vicinity of Alice Springs, the brilliant Turquoise Wren
(M. callainus) was observed.

The only Pardalote we identified at " the top end 55 was the Black-
headed ( Pardalotus melanocephalus) which we frequently flushed from its
nesting burrows on roadside banks.
We thought the Yellow Silvereye (gosterops luted) was going to elude
us, but ultimately we saw one in the mangroves near Darwin and a few
days later saw several more ; it is, as its name implies, much yellower
than the greenish southern and eastern forms.

Wood Swallows
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.987206833333333" page_id="56365713"  page_num="48" year="" vol="">
Representatives of this genus were present in quite incredible
numbers, and we saw five of the six Australian species, the only missing
one being the common Dusky Wood Swallow (Artamus cyanopterus ) of
the South. Its place was taken in the centre and everywhere as far as
Mataranka by the Black-faced (A. melanops ) ; thereafter this bird
became quite rare although a few stragglers were seen further north.
As it disappeared, its place was taken by the Little (A. minor), a delight-
ful species which I had not seen before, very dark grey and brown in
coloration and much smaller than any others of the genus. We found
the White-breasted (A. leucorhynchus) in many places at " the top end ",
but, as always, in the vicinity of water. It was very common in the
town of Darwin itself.
The Masked Wood Swallow (A. personatus) was in countless thousands
over a large area between Elliott and Pine Creek, and to the east
thereof and amongst them were quite small numbers of the White-
browed (A. superciliosus) , probably not more than one in a hundred.
This reverses entirely the ratio of these birds seen in the south, where the
White-browed is always the more numerous.

We saw no less than twenty species of this family in the Territory
and were fortunate in identifying all that are confined to the north.
Many of them are not particularly spectacular, but two of the smaller
ones were particularly striking. They were the Red-headed ( Myzomela
erythrocephala ) which was common in the mangroves and its close
relative the Banded (M. pectoralis), a striking little black and white bird,
which we saw in several places. Another brilliant species was the
Golden-backed ( Melithreptus laetior ) which was first identified by the
similarity of its call to that of its southern relative, the Black-chinned
(M. gularis).
Of the larger species, the Blue-faced ( Entomyzon cyanotis) was widely
distributed from Mataranka northwards, this was the White-quilled
race ( albipennis ), which probably warrants the specific rank which was
originally conferred on it by Gould. Occurring over an identical
distribution was the raucous and rather ugly Silver-crowned Friar
Bird (. Philemon argenticeps ).

<bodyText confidence="0.989751720930232" page_id="56365714"  page_num="49" year="" vol="">
The numerous species of finches provided one of the highlights of the
trip ; eight species being seen, of which six were new to the author in
the wild state.
The Zebra Finch ( Taeniopygia castanotis ) was seen in considerable
numbers between Alice Springs and Mataranka ; thereafter it dis-
appeared entirely and its place appeared to be taken by the Black-
ringed Finch or Black-rumped Double-bar ( Steganopleura annulosa)
which was not observed south of Dunmarra but became progressively
more common north of that point. A great thrill was the location of a
small flock of about thirty Painted Finches ( Emblema picta) on a stony,
spinifex-covered hillside between Wauchope and Banka Banka ; this
species is quite unknown in the tropical areas further to the north. The
Chestnut-breasted Finch ( Donacola castaneothorax) , although said to be
common, was only observed on one occasion when a party of some
fifty birds, both adult and immature, were found feeding in a gully on
the Darwin foreshore.
Of the truly tropical species, by far the commonest was the Long-
tailed ( Poephila acuticauda ) which was plentiful from Larrimah north-
ward but absent in the immediate vicinity of Darwin. This was the
red-billed subspecies ( hecki ). Not nearly so common, but nevertheless
widely distributed over exactly the same area, was the Masked Finch
(P. personata). Both the foregoing species were seen feeding newly
fledged young. The Gouldian Finch (P. gouldiae) was only observed on
four occasions over roughly the same area but each time in flocks of up
to fifty birds, both adult and immature. The first sighting was memor-
able in that they flushed from the roadside into nearby trees where
males and females of both red and black-headed phases and immatures
could be seen in the one binocular field !
The Crimson Finch ( Neochmia phaeton) was invariably seen in
Pandanus palms in the immediate vicinity of water. In suitable
localities it was plentiful, quite tame and could be attracted by making
squeaking noises. Here again adult males and females and immatures
of all ages and plumage phases could be seen ; one of the latter was
seen to be taken by a Little Falcon (Falco longipennis ).
Sundry Large Passerines
Both species of Oriole, the Olive-backed ( Oriolus sagittatei) and the
Yellow (0 . flavocintus) were present from Mataranka northward, the
latter being the commoner the further north we went, although both
were present in the Darwin area. They have rich, varied notes and are
reputedly good mimics. The noisy and striking Spangled Drongo
(Chibia bracteata ) with its noticeably forked tail, was plentiful in the
Darwin area and for about a 50 mile radius therefrom.
The Great Bower Bird ( Chlamydera nuchalis) was extremely plentiful

everywhere north of Dunmarra. We found two bowers, one of which
was very sturdily constructed of upright sticks ; at one end there were
about a hundred bleached snail shells, at the other, a few fresh leaves
and green berries and in the centre, some hundred or more fragments
of shattered windscreen glass.
Three species of Butcher Birds were observed, of which the Pied
(Cradieus nigrogularis) was widely spread everywhere from south of
Alice Springs to the Darwin area. The Silver-backed [C. argenteus) is the
representative of the southern Grey (C. torquatus) and was only seen
north of Adelaide River and was by no means common. The Black
(C. quoyi ) proved very elusive and was finally tracked down in man-
groves near Darwin by its currawong-like note, described by Sharland.
Even then, only a couple of fleeting glimpses were obtained.
The only Magpie seen (and here we disagree with Sharland) was the
Black-backed ( Gymnorhina tibicen), which was reasonably plentiful in

apparent reason, somewhere not far north of Elliott. We thought the
Australian Crow (C. cecilae) replaced the Australian Raven (C. coro-

" scarecrow " where the light bases to the neck feathers were obvious.

In the write-up on the activities in the Edward Marshall Boehm
Aviaries in 1963 (Avicultural Magazine, Vol. 71, No. 1, 1965),
I made mention of a near miss with the Black-headed Oriole-- Oriolus l.
larvatus. Since in 1964 a successful breeding was made, the first of this
species in captivity so far as I am aware, I feel that further details might
be of some general interest.
This is one of the true Orioles and comes from Africa where it ranges
clear across the continent from Angola in the west, up to the Sudan and
Ethiopia, and then down and across to Bechuanaland, the Transvaal
and Portuguese East Africa. The sexes are much alike in appearance,
so much so that to sex an individual specimen would be difficult unless
it were a full-grown-adult. With the mature male the head and neck
is black, the rest of the upper parts being olivaceous golden-yellow.
The wings are black, the edges of the flights being whitish, with the
outer edges of the inner secondaries being olivaceous-yellow, the inner
edges being black. The coverts of the inner primaries also are edged
with olivaceous-yellow. The tail has a variable pattern of yellow-green,
decreasing in depth of colour towards the outer feathers. With the
exception of the central pair, all the tail feathers have broad yellow

tips. The under-parts are golden-yellow, richest at the throat and
gradually paling towards the vent. The bill is pinkish-brown, legs and
feet are blue-grey, and the iris is crimson. The main difference in the
sexes is seen in the intensity of the black of the head and neck, that of
the female being more dusky, and the depth and colour of the under-
parts. Further, both sexes have a small yellow patch in the centre of the
flight feathers, best seen when at rest, that of the male being slightly
larger than the female's. They are about 9 inches in total length.
The first pair owned by Mr. Boehm was received from Portuguese
East Africa in September, i960, but unfortunately the male was killed
by a Green Cardinal. It was not until April, 1962, that a replacement
was obtained and placed in the same aviary as the female, the Cardinals
having been disposed of. They shared this enclosure of some 30 by
12 feet with pairs of Amethyst Starlings, Black-headed Sugarbirds,
Meve's Glossy Starlings, and White-breasted Rails, together with a
solitary young male apricot Cock of the Rock.
The nesting in 1964 took place in the same nest-box referred to in
the earlier article mentioned above, but this time the first egg was not
laid until 5th May. This, however, was destroyed the following day,
the Cock of the Rock being the culprit. He was caught up promptly
and transferred to an aviary where no nestings were in progress. With
a second being laid two days later, incubation, which was shared,
commenced, hatching taking place on the 25th. The progress of the
nestling, and the care of it, followed the same pattern as the previous
year, it fledging on 12th June.
At eighteen days old the head was darkening in shades of blackish-
green, the underparts were pale whitish-yellow heavily flecked with
dark brown. The nape of the neck was yellow and pale barrings were
showing in the wings. It did not acquire full independence until
9th July, and, at the end of a further twelve days, the fleckings on the
underparts had almost disappeared. Even at this stage the male parent
occasionally offered it mealworms, which it accepted, but basically it
was self-supporting.
The bird is now eight months old but the head is still not the solid
colour of either parent, it being faintly flecked with yellow. Further,
the black neck-line is not clearly defined, as it is with the older birds,
the golden-yellow of the throat being interspersed with it, giving a
striated effect. From the size of the wing patch it seems to bear more
resemblance to the adult male, but its call is more like that of the female.
It will be interesting to note at what age it does acquire full adult
colouring and whether it is easily sexable. Further advice on these
points will be given as soon as all the answers are revealed to me.

By W. D. Cummings (Keston, Kent, England.)
Here, at the Keston Foreign Bird Farm, we like to record all the
breeding results and attempts over the year, for we have some very
unusual experiences, and this year was no exception.
We had an early spring this year and a long dry summer and this
of course has a strong effect on the breeding results. The early breeders,
like the Ring-necks, reared some good broods and the young blue
Ring-necks were the biggest and strongest for years. The later breeders,
such as the Rosellas and Stanleys had poor results due to the very dry
conditions in the nest boxes. One pair of blue Ring-necks failed us
completely; they are at the best of times very nervous sitters, and this
is mainly the cock bird's fault as he calls the hen off the nest on the
slightest provocation. The other pairs reared six beautiful young j
between them. Besides these, we reared quite a few young lutinos but j
unfortunately we lost the cock Ring-neck, father of the young albino
reared last year--he was just found dead in the shelter, although |
perfectly fit and plump a few hours before, whilst the blue hen, to
which he was paired, was sitting. To be on the safe side, I took her
three eggs away and put them under a pair of lutino Ring-necks, who i
are extremely reliable sitters and feeders, and put their eggs under the
blue hen. This was only possible because both hens commenced laying
on the same day, and both hens safely reared broods--the blue hen j
reared one lutino and one green Ring-neck, and the lutinos reared :
three young blues. We had hoped there might be another albino
amongst the latter brood, but no such luck!
The Amazon Parrots did badly; the Blue-fronts, Festive Amazons,
and Cuban Amazons all had infertile eggs. The old breeding pair of j
Grey Parrots reared only two young, and the second pair of Grey
Parrots, including a daughter of the older pair, who reached maturity
this year and nested, but although she brooded for several weeks, there
was no sign of eggs when the nest-box was finally taken down. The
Leadbeater's Cockatoos had two nice youngsters, this, in spite of the
fact that they were disturbed by intruders while sitting. The whole of
the nest-box was lifted off and placed on the ground, exposing the eggs ;
this could not have happened long before I visited the aviary because
I found the eggs still slightly warm and hurriedly replaced the
top and beat a hasty retreat--to coin a phrase! If you have a cock
Feadbeater's that is a good sitter he is worth his weight in gold, and
this is such a bird, for in no time at all he was investigating the nest-box
again and, finally, after approximately fifteen minutes, was sitting
once more. Most Cockatoos, unless they are finger-tame, will not stand
this sort of interference.

Both pairs of Barraband's had infertile eggs, although the cock birds
were very fit and are exceptionally fine birds.
The Grass Parrakeets did well--the Bourkes especially. We reared
thirty-eight Bourkes from five pairs, which is quite exceptional; we
are breeding for colour and prolificacy in these delightful little birds,
and have built up a very useful strain. For the first time this year we had
two broods leave the nest in almost adult colouring, with bright pink
breasts, and there were two broods of six. One pair of Splendid Grass
Parrakeets also reared six and we finally reared fifteen in all of these
beautiful little birds.
With Turquoisines we did not do so well, but many of them were
newly mated pairs.
One result we were delighted with was the rearing of a young
Plum-head from the lutino Plum-head cock, by a pair of yellow
Red-rumped Parrakeets. They hatched and reared this young Plum-
head--a normal coloured bird--with two of their own young. I had
not intended this to happen ; I think it safer not to mix broods, and
gave the Red-rump eggs a good shaking, but I suppose they were so
fresh it did no harm to the embryo. When the eggs have been sat on
for over five days, it is usually effective. This pair were only given two
Plum-head eggs, the other being infertile ; the remaining three
Plum-head eggs were put under a pair of normal Ring-neck Parra-
keets, kept for the purpose, who conveniently laid at exactly the same
time. This pair disgraced themselves for they hatched three young
Plum-heads and just let them die at a few days old. However, we will
persevere with this pair of Red-rumps.
The other pairs of yellow Red-rumps reared eight to ten young be-
tween them. Again, in these, we concentrated on colour and vigour, and
the young cocks all came out of the nest with bright red rumps, and some
of the adult hens also obtained reddish rumps at just over a year old.
The colour of these yellows varies considerably in the different strains ;
some yellow Red-rump cocks, at maturity, assume quite a green
overall colour and look, from a distance, like a slightly duller normal
coloured cock bird. Others only have a mantle of green and this
emphasizes their blue wing butts and pale yellow backs ; this is a very
pretty combination. Again, the hens vary from very pale yellow to
a poor coloured dark greenish-yellow.
We reared a brood of five little Andean (Aymara) Parrakeets and
are building up a nice breeding stock of these delightful birds. They
are easier to sex as they come out of the nest because the cocks have
distinctive silver breasts and darker caps. They come out of the nest
in adult plumage and only differ in size from the adults. We had a
spare hen of this species, which we successfully paired to a green
Budgerigar cock; they mated and laid but, as expected, the eggs were
all infertile.

We have also paired Budgerigar cocks successfully to Bourke Grass
Parrakeets and Peach-faced Lovebirds--the latter were reared under
Budgies themselves--but with no results. All of them mated successfully
and laid but, in every case, the eggs were infertile.
Of course, birds that built open nests fared better this year than those
using boxes, and we had some very interesting results amongst the
insectivorous species. We reared a beautiful brood of three young
Rufous-bellied Niltavas ; they were perfect specimens and were reared
entirely on gentles, mealworms, and blowflies. They were easily
sexable as they fledged for the two young cocks both had cobalt blue
tails and much darker brown speckling on the breast; the hen was a
paler brown and less heavily speckled on the breast. They quickly
assumed adult colouring and, at three months, approximately, they
were replicas of their parents. We reared one young one under a
different hen two years ago, but we lost it during some particularly
bad weather before it was fully self-supporting.
This is the most crucial time of all for young birds, and it is most
important to ensure that food is easily available when they start to feed
themselves, and to make allowances for the weather. This cock Niltava
was a most solicitous father and, as far as I could see, did most of the
feeding himself. I never once saw the hen carrying live food. In the
same aviary we had the albino Sparrows but I am afraid the adult hen,
mated to her split albino son, made no attempt to nest; although they
paired frequently.
One pair of White-capped Redstarts (India) which we have had for
several years, nested this year or rather, I should say, I found their nest
this year. They could easily have nested other years without my
knowing, for they proved to be the most furtive breeders that I have
ever known ! If it had not been for the fact that they nested in an old
semi-open Budgie nest-box, very close to the shelter entrance, and the
cock bird sitting around and occasionally giving warning cries when
I went near it, I would never have investigated the box. There was a
neat little nest in the bottom, containing four heavily blotched eggs.
During the next ten days I never once saw the hen coming off the nest,
although I tried to catch them unawares ; nor did she have the fluffed-
up look of a sitting hen. She hatched three of the four eggs, but
unfortunately they must have disappeared soon after hatching. I had
laid on an increased supply of live food, just in case. I have found it
impossible to keep a pair of these together all the year round, except
in a very large aviary, for they become territorial and aggressive during
the winter months, and the hens always come off worse.
At long last, I managed to get a young cock Azure-winged Magpie
from Tom Spence, and I have tried several birds from different sources,
but they all proved to be hens. Meanwhile, our old hen has laid
infertile eggs year after year, for nine years. This year she only laid

four eggs instead of the normal nine, hatched three young, and
promptly died. So, after all, we had no results.
We reared several young Western Bluebirds but we are in urgent
need of fresh blood for these pretty little North American birds.
Our Blue-shouldered Mountain Tanagers reared two more young,
but we have not yet succeded in breeding to the second generation.
Our great surprise was with the pair of Fairy Bluebirds. Early in
April the hen started carrying large twigs about the aviary, and seemed
to be very excited. The cock bird always seems slightly nervous of the
hen and, although he follows her about in a nervous fashion, mates quite
freely with her. They make delightful, excited, and very musical
burbling noises as they fly fast round the aviary. The hen built the nest
in a thick Macrocarpa bush and, since there was plenty of nesting
material about, I left them entirely alone. All was quiet for a fortnight
and I seldom saw the hen so she was obviously sitting. Then everything
changed--there was great excitement so I presumed they had hatched.
The hen bird, followed by the cock, flew into the shelter for food so I
nipped into the aviary, with a box to stand on, to see the results for
myself. There were two fluffy black youngsters with large red gapes
perched on the nest, which looked extremely insecure, so I hastily
stacked a bundle of sticks and grass under the nest to support it, and
withdrew. The nest was well constructed but the materials were dry
and brittle, and had not held together properly and, consequently, had
slipped to an angle ; with the growing weight of the youngsters it would,
in time, have surely fallen to the ground. Both birds were carrying
mealworms about and took live food freely. However, it was obvious
from the size of the youngsters' gapes, that they could take much
larger insects than I could provide. I found beetles and spiders, but
not in sufficient quantities, and after eight to ten days I found the
youngsters dead on the ground. After a break of two to three days the
hen went to nest again, using the same nest and laid two more eggs;
these were large, pale grey in colour with blotches of brown, grey, and
purple. Once more, youngsters were hatched, but with the same
results. Then, for the third time, the hen built in a new site, laid two
eggs and hatched one youngster, but again she failed to rear. Meal-
worms and gentles and gentle chrysalis seemed sufficient to rear to a
certain age, but it was obvious from the size of their gapes, that, in the
wild state, the youngsters could be fed quite large grasshoppers and
insects, and a substitute would be needed in captivity. We managed
to obtain a supply of locusts hoppers but they, in turn, were not large
enough. We shall have to try trapping moths, with the aid of a night-
light, next year but this will not be easy to place in a small aviary
without disturbing the birds. Anyway, we hope for better luck next year.
Fairy Bluebirds seem to be fastidious feeders and both cock and hen
appear to have different tastes in fruit. They are much hardier than

one would suppose from their jungle habitat in Malaya, and ours fly
outside during the day, all the year round, only being shut in their
shelter at night, in the winter. They are given slight heat during the
winter months, just enough to keep the water from freezing.
Finally, back to seed-eaters--a pair of Blue-bills (Spermophaga
rujicappila) which we obtained last year. These large and beautiful
seed-eaters, of predominantly red colouring--the hen having speckling
on the lower half of the breast--are of an extremely nervous disposition.
This pair took a long time to settle down in their small aviary, shared
with a few young red factor Canaries, and, if anyone appeared, would
shoot into their shelter and even hide on the floor to avoid being seen.
In the spring they showed no interest in nesting and dropped into a
heavy moult about May, so I gave up any hope of breeding from them
this year. Then, about September, the cock bird started singing a
monotonous, disjointed song somewhat similar to the Peter's Spotted
Firefinch, to which they seem distantly related ; and I noticed a small
pile of grass on a perch at the back of the shelter. I caught up all the
Canaries in the flight, without disturbing the Blue-bills, and put a wire
netting support under the perch in the shelter and placed some more
hay and grass stems on top. To my surprise, within twenty-four
hours, the cock bird had built a beautiful domed nest at the back of the
shelter. After a few days they started sitting and were most conscien-
tious about taking turns on the nest, the cock bird doing most of his
by day.
After three weeks, and still they were sitting tight, I thought the
eggs must be infertile and, on investigation, found one large white egg,
dried up inside. I removed this and, within a few days the cock
commenced singing again. I next found the hen, looking slightly egg-
bound, out in the flight and several hours after that discovered a soft-
shelled egg there. However, I did not wish to break their cycle and
decided to risk the hen but, as a precaution, put a lamp in the shelter
to give a little additional warmth at night. This seemed to work for
they started sitting in the nest again. Eight or nine days later I dis-
covered an egg with a fully developed embryo inside, on the floor of
the shelter and found the nest empty. This decided me that it would
be a pity to risk losing the hen with further efforts this year, and so
I removed the nest and all the nesting material. We hope for better
things next year, and perhaps to get them to nest in the spring.
We also had a near success with the Venezuelan Hooded Siskins--
the one fertile egg I placed under a pair of red factor Canaries, who
reared it to fledgling, but unfortunately, due to an accident, it fell out
of the nest. Unfortunately too, I was away that day and found it dead
when I returned. I am very keen to breed these delightful little birds.
The hen of this pair regularly every year lays her eggs in the seed dish
and makes little effort to build a nest.

We also reared numerous pigeons and doves. Australian Crested
Pigeons did well both in aviaries and at liberty, and we have a very
reliable breeding stock of these lovely pigeons. Some are given to stray
at liberty but we have never managed to get two pairs to stay and breed
at liberty, for one pair always drives the other pair off, even though
there are plenty of trees and nesting sites available. As with the
domesticated Barbary Doves, once you have discovered, through trial
and error, a reliable staying strain at liberty, you have no more trouble.
One autumn we caught up nineteen young Barbary Doves and the
original three breeding pairs. Our Australian Common Bronze-wings
are not such reliable breeders, but we managed to rear half a dozen
from our three pairs, annually. We also bred six to eight young White-
breasted Barbaries.
Our Tambourine Doves nested for the first time this year and laid
three clutches of eggs, a creamy colour, not the usual white eggs of the
dove family, but unfortunately they were all infertile. They are the
most attractive little doves with snow white breasts and ruddy brown
backs, but they are timid and take a while to settle down in an aviary.
For several years I have been crossing small blue domestic pigeons with
European Stock Dove hens, but find the young extremely difficult to
rear. This year approximately six pairs of squabs hatched, but none
reared beyond three weeks old. I have been told that the first cross
hybrid is fertile with a domestic pigeon and think this should be an
attractive liberty bird. I have found the domestic pigeon X European
Wood Pigeon much easier to achieve, but this is a sterile hybrid. I
have tried this back to a domestic pigeon and to a pure Stock Dove,
but with only infertile results.
So far, this winter has been very mild and our collection of birds
looks very well, and we look forward to further exciting breeding results
next year.

By R. G. Kirkham (Nairobi, Kenya, formerly Ireland)
The 1964 season from my point of view has been quite the most
interesting and troublesome, for many a long year. I went to Uganda
early in April leaving behind my blue Ringnecks on the point of
laying. A lutino Ringneck hen mated to a Plum-head cock also just
about to lay and nothing else even remotely interested in the nest-
boxes provided. I came back four weeks later to find the blues had laid
a clutch of clear eggs (worse luck) and the lutino hen likewise. Greater
Patagonian Gonures had also laid, but when ? and how many ? That
was the 64-dollar question. Naturally I was very anxious to investigate.

but common sense and cowardice prevailed. Never have I owned such
a terrible pair of birds. They fought and screamed at each other all
day long, and while the hen was sitting the cock positively gorged
himself on sunflower and hemp, which they both love, and just
dropped a few odd dandelion and spinach leaves through the entrance
hole to the sitting hen. I never saw her off the nest during incubation
and by the time the eggs hatched out I am sure she must have been
half-starved. I think she had been sitting for about four weeks, when we
heard hoarse croaks coming up from the bowels of the box, and flesh
and blood could stand it no longer. I just had to know what was going
on. Arming myself with two catching nets I timidly entered the aviary
to be immediately attacked by both parents. I succeeded in catching
them one in each net and so, while both birds cursed and swore, I was
able to get a quick look in the nest to find three of the most ugly
youngsters and one egg unhatched, that was about 7th June. On,
Monday, 3rd August, and being in a Bank Holiday carefree mood, I
decided to take another look, so again risking life and limb and catching
up both parents I took a peep and saw three huge youngsters. They
filled the nest-box. They looked like adults and they swore like adults
and the only difference I could see is in the beaks which are light horn
colour, though the old birds are black. They were fully feathered and
appeared ready to leave the nest. They consumed vast quantities of
food, sunflower, hemp, and green food--such appetites ! In a des-
perate attempt to satisfy them I provided that good old standby-
bread and milk, which the parents consume by the plateful and then
hurl the plates to the ground, smashing them nine times out of ten.
Yes--the young birds seem to be thriving, but the death rate in plates
is very high. However, I reckon its a small price to pay for breeding
these terrible birds. I have a theory about them ; I think they would
make excellent homers. Early in the year they accidently escaped
through my carelessness in leaving their feeding hatch open, and away
they went like a pair of Bloodhound Rockets. I felt I had seen the last of
them, and mourned their loss, but 36 hours later they were back home
again and in their aviary. Hungry, thirsty, and abusive, and ever on
the lookout to remove one of my fingers, should I leave it within reach
of those noisy beaks. To make up for all my trouble with the
Patogonians my Crimson-wing hen went quietly to nest. She laid four
eggs, reared three young without any fuss or bother and then laid a
second clutch of three, of which one has hatched to date. If readers can
bear to suffer with me, perhaps, in the near future I can tell of several of
my tribulations and failures, of which I have many.

The most interesting although not quite successful breeding result
was the hatching of two young Kagus (Rhinochetus Jubatus ). The two
pairs of this extremely rare bird being threatened with extinction on
its native island New Caledonia were imported into the Berlin Zoo in
1962. Already in 1963 both males performed their impressive display
behaviour, so that the pairs were separated from each other.
In October, 1964, one of the pairs began to build a nest of small
boughs behind a bush in a corner of their spacious aviary in the
pheasantry. On 28th October the single egg was discovered, being of
the size of a small hen's egg (2 *48 in. length) with dark brown and
grey spots on light brown ground colour like a Crane's egg. It was put
into the incubator in spite of being a little damaged. When blown
four weeks later it was found that the egg contained a small,
undeveloped embryo !
On 17th November the same hen had laid another egg which again
was taken away and put into the incubator. On 19th December a first
pecking was heard and twenty-four hours later the chick hatched,
after an incubation period of thirty-four days. However, being very
weak and not having retracted the yolk sac it died the next day. With
its reddish brown down it looked very much like a small Crane chick.
On 6th December a third egg was laid and this time the female
seemed to be ready to incubate the egg herself. However, as a pre-
caution the egg was taken away again but exchanged for a plaster
egg. When after twelve days the Kagu hen was sitting on the nest
persistently the true egg was returned to her. The part of the pheasantry
where the Kagu aviary is situated was closed to the public, so that the
breeding birds were not disturbed.
If the recorded breeding period of thirty-five to forty days was
correct, the hatching of the young was to be expected between the
10th and 15th January, 1965. On 10th January early in the morning
no indication of the impending hatching was discovered, but about
9 a.m. both birds were seen pecking at the egg and pulling the young
out of the broken shell. Unfortunately it was injured heavily by its
parents so that it died a short time later. However, the chick was well
developed, the yolk sac was retracted, and it would have survived if
the parents had shown normal brooding drive. We do hope sincerely
that this pair will rear its next brood successfully. The bodies of the
two chicks were given to the Senckenberg Museum, Frankfurt/Main,
for further investigation.

To the best of our knowledge no zoo until now succeeded in breeding
the Kagu, except a private aviculturist on New Caledonia itself and
another one in Australia early this century, although Kagus have been
very long-lived in captivity.
At the Berlin Zoo a pair of Kagus imported in 1934 made breeding
attempts and laid an egg twice or three times a year during several
years, but the eggs always proved infertile. By the way, one of these
two Kagus with a few other animals even survived the Second World
War and died in October, 1945, being then about twenty-one years of
age. Having now again at least one breeding pair we hope to contribute
to the conservation of this strange, endangered species in a not too
distant future by breeding Kagus in captivity.
Among the other hatchings another young Crowned Pigeon (Goura
cristata ), the second one in second generation, and three Peach-faced
Lovebirds may be worth mentioning.
New arrivals include 4 Indian Snakebirds, 2 Cape Teals, 4 Blue-

By Terry Jones (Leckford, Hants., England)
At Leckford we have a small collection of parrakeets consisting of
seven pairs of breeding birds and several immatures.
Two pairs of Stanleys each laid five eggs and started laying within
a day or so of each other. One pair had five fertile eggs and the other
pair five clears, so I gave the fertile eggs to the pair with the clear eggs
and they hatched and reared the five, but I think the foster-father had
his doubts about those children for I never saw him feed them, or even
his wife after they had hatched. The robbed pair promptly laid again
five more eggs, all infertile !
Two pairs of Pennant's ; one consisting of a magnificent cock and a
moth-eaten hen who nips the ends off her feathers on her front and
back, so she appears a blackish bird with a red head. She is also rather
small and slack-flighted but her youngsters year after year are the
finest I have ever seen. Incidentally, the young on leaving the nest
are sometimes green and sometimes red. She reared three this year;
one unfortunately crashed and fractured his skull. This autumn this
hen intrigued me by giving a prolonged display of " anting ". I had
thrown some lettuce thinnings on the floor, and I am sure there were no
ants in them, but she went through the typical anting motions, picking
something off the roots---Soil? Latex?--and putting it amongst her
plumage, particularly about the sides of her breast, under her wings,
and also near the tail gland. The second pair of Pennant's, a very
nice-looking pair, hatched and reared four. This pair have always had
green youngsters. The hen of a pair of Mealies admired the moth-eaten
Pennant's and copied her in changing herself into a blackish bird with
of course a white head. Her husband did not approve of this, so they
did not breed. She laid from the perches because he would not have
her near his box.
And finally two pairs of Princess of Wales's. The first pair are birds
we have had for a very long time. The male is an outstanding bird.
The hen is curious in that each summer when breeding she goes
nearly blind because her eyelids seem to grow! I have never handled
her of course, but like most Princess of Wales's she is very tame, so
one can observe her pretty closely. These growths scale off and once
the young have flown her eyes revert to normal. In 1963 this pair
behaved as never before. The cock lived in the box with her while she
was incubating, and the youngsters got trampled, only one being
reared. However, this year all was normal, the cock going into the
box to assist in feeding the growing brood, but while she was sitting,
and when the young were small merely feeding the hen whenever she
came off. She hatched and reared six, two being fostered on the second

pair. The second pair consists of a superb four-year-old hen, daughter of
the above, and a very nice but small cock. He was the typical henpecked
husband, shoulder high to his wife. I never saw him feed her. I never
saw her have the slightest liking for him. He always had to get off
quickly, but like the male spider he must have been tolerated in a
moment of weakness because to my surprise two of her four eggs were
fertile. She had started to sit the same day as her mother. While she
was incubating the cock never fed her, nor did he go into the box to
feed the young; he was not allowed. Whenever one went in to feed
or supply green food, she came off, fed rapidly, and went back, but
after the young had flown he was punctilious in feeding them because
he could do so and keep an eye on his mate. When their two youngsters
were pin-feathered I put rings on their legs, and added the two eldest
of the old hen's six who were the same age, so both pairs reared four.
I do not let my birds rear second broods. I have done so, but if you
really have an eye for a bird the second crop are rarely as good as the
first. There are far too many second-class birds about and I do not
want to add to them.
When writing about the Pennant's eccentricities I should have
described something besides the anting which I had never seen before,
and that was the eldest of their three youngsters repeatedly feeding the
youngest. The only instance I have seen of immatures feeding
babies is in the case of Waterhens, but in this instance it has always
been the case of members of the first brood feeding little chicks of the
second or third broods.
It was a wonderful summer for rearing waterfowl and a good number
were reared, but nothing which we had not bred before. The major
disappointment was the hen Coscoroba Swan which was bred in
Philadelphia Zoo ; she laid three clutches of clear eggs for the second
year running, although paired to a magnificent wild-caught male.
Thanks to Mr. Peter Kooy she has just got a new mate, but as he is
newly imported I doubt he will be any use this year, but we can hope.
The other male has now a wild-caught female we have had for several
years, the first of three or four females which were sent here as males
by the Dutch and Belgian dealers.
Ten goslings were reared from the single pair of Ne-Nes we house
for the Wildfowl Trust, bringing the number reared here to fifty. We
did breed two unusual goslings--a leucistic Ross. It hatched a silver
gosling which is not unusual, but it had flesh-coloured beak and legs
instead of dark ones; its flights when it fledged are brown coloured
and fade badly. The other gosling is a female Ashy-head in which the
whole wing, shoulders, secondaries, and primaries is white.
Finally we have reared a baby Crane here for the first time since
about 1940. The London Zoo sent us two Sarus Crane eggs, one of
which was clear. These were set under a smallish hen, and the youngster

hatched quickly on the thirtieth day. I had a spare hen sitting and
after the Crane was dry I transferred him to this hen and left him a
further twenty-four hours. He could have been returned to the hen
that hatched him of course, after she had been off to feed and relieve
herself, but we thought the second hen would be more placid. When
he was approximately forty-eight hours old, he and the hen were
transferred to a brooder with an infra-red lamp. Clean sacks were
laid on the floor and the Crane was offered raw mince which he started
eating straight away. We fed him regularly at two-hourly intervals.
After the first day or so we added hard-boiled egg and powdered
oyster-shell to the mince, but soon gave this up when we discovered
he liked eating oyster-shell by itself. Always before him was a shallow
dish of water partly filled with gravel so he would not slip when
paddling. A few freshwater shrimps in the dish gave him endless
amusement, but it was nearly always the hen who caught them for him.
This Crane we believe to be a hen, but when a baby it got named
Stanley, owing to its facial resemblance to a baby Starling of that
name which a member of the staff had reared a year or two previously.
I protested at the time that Stanley was a confusing name for a Sarus
Crane, but was told that visitors who knew anything about cranes
could see he was not a Stanley Crane. He was one of the nicest birds
we have ever reared, and quickly developed a dual loyalty to us and
to the hen. The main snag when rearing a Sarus Crane is the rate of
growth. It grows out of everything, for it starts life about the size of a
domestic gosling and at eight weeks is over 5 feet tall. As the weather
was lovely we transferred him and the hen to a wired-in run during
the daytime, and while we were working with the ducklings on the
lawn we lifted him out so he could run about, and this was how we
discovered that a young crane will devour some water weeds until,
like a gosling, he is literally full up from crop to throat. These weeds
we gather from the river for such green-food eaters as Red-crested
Pochard, Wigeons, the brown Shelducks, etc. The particular favourites
are " water celery 55 and " water carrot These are the fly fishermen's
names for two umbelliferous plants whose subaqueous foliage is ever-
green, and I think are varieties of Oenanthe. It is this foliage which is
greatly relished by swans and waterfowl generally. Stanley one day
discovered a bucketful standing on the lawn. After that he had a
daily ration. Actually he preferred the stalks to the leaves themselves.
Cranes are so easily reared artificially that one should never leave
them in this climate to be reared by their parents. They are mostly
too rare and too valuable to expose to so many hazards. All species of
crane have been reared in captivity in the past, with so far as I know
two exceptions, the Asiatic White which had laid in Europe but never
hatched, and G. nigricollis which was so rare in captivity that there were
never a pair in captivity together. In 1939 we had all the species of

crane bar two, the Whooping and G. nigricollis, and obtained the whole
lot within the space of two years. All were wild-caught so in that time
few had settled enough to breed before the war came, but in 1939 we
reared the Australian and the little brown Canadian Crane, and had
eggs from the two female White-necked ; we possessed no male. The
Chinese have throughout their history been renowned for their skill in
breeding animals, birds, plants, and fish, and I hope that perhaps in
some of their zoos are pairs of Hooded and other very rare Asiatic
Cranes, and that someone is trying to preserve a nucleus for posterity,
as was done in the case of Pere David's deer.

By R. G. Kirkham (Nairobi, Kenya, formerly Ireland)
First opened to the public in May, 1962. These beautiful gardens,
situated on the borders of Wiltshire and Somerset, and about half a
mile from the Red Lion at Wolverton (a very good pub indeed), are
not difficult to find and contain many rare, interesting, and exotic
birds.
The gardens, situated in what was formerly Rode Manor, and
covering about 17 acres, were started by Donald Risdon, a former
General Manager of Dudley Zoo, and his wife Betty, and both have
worked very hard indeed to build up the collection to its present level
of about 850 birds comprising 120 different species. Donald has always
been keen on keeping birds at liberty, and one of the first things he did
was to establish a small flock of free-flying macaws, and what a spec-
tacle they are ! To see a pair of Blue and Yellows chasing each other
in and out between the trees, and performing aerobatics for the benefit
of the visitors taking tea on the lawn, is a sight not to be missed.
Incidentally, they were thought to be two males, but one of them named
" Arthur " laid two eggs in a box optimistically provided, and is now
busy incubating them, while Donald keeps his fingers crossed and hopes
for the best. There are also a very fine pair of Moluccan Cockatoos
flying at liberty. These are known as " Mr. and Mrs. Honey " and are
T.V. and Radio personalities having appeared on many programmes.
Another bird of great character and few feathers is a Greater
Sulphur-crested Cockatoo known as " Sigi ". An inveterate feather
plucker, of uncertain age and with a rich vocabulary obviously acquired
during many years' association with a drunken sailor. " Sigi " is not to
be lightly dismissed, and when he shrieks a few well-chosen words in a
loud brass-bound voice from the topmost branches of a 30 ft. high fir

tree, it is impossible to ignore him. Other cockatoos to be seen in the
aviaries are Roseate, Leadbeater's, Lesser Sulphur-crests, White-
crested, Blue-eyed, and last but by no means least the tiny Philippine
Island Red-vented. Quiet, gentle, and well mannered, they are every-
thing a well-bred cockatoo should be--and the exact opposite to

Part of the charm of the Gardens are the lakes--sounds a bit Irish
but its true. There are two ponds joined together by a short river
emptying into a beautiful natural lake which makes a perfect setting
for a fine collection of water birds. Penguins and Flamingos, ornamen-
tal ducks and Black-necked Swans. Barnacle and Emperor Geese and
indeed many more. In the paddocks facing the lakes Demoiselle and
West African Crowned Cranes disported themselves and paid little
attention to their neighbours the ducks and geese. In a nearby range of
ten parrakeet aviaries the cocks dosed in the midday sun while the hens
carried on the serious business of incubation. Altogether a very satis-
factory domestic arrangement.
Two important aviaries not to be missed are those housing starlings
in one and touracos and toucans in the other. These never fail to
attract attention, and visitors are always surprised to learn that they
live outside all the year round. Incidentally, I am sure this is the main
reason why they look in such wonderful condition and plumage.
The collection grows rapidly, and each time I come to Rode there are
new birds to be seen and new aviaries built to house them. I know it is
Donald's ambition to keep and exhibit everything from humming birds
to ostriches. In this he is being ably assisted by his head keeper
Michael Curzon who is responsible for the day-to-day feeding and care
of the birds. I might add, that it is hoped to embark on a comprehen-
sive breeding programme next season and, with this in view, plans
are already being made and suitable breeding quarters prepared.
In conclusion, I feel I have done scant justice to a splendid collection
having said nothing about peafowl, pheasants, owls, pigeons and doves,
rooks and quail--but they are all there to be seen and enjoyed, and I
am assured that members of the Society will always be cordially
received, and are asked to make themselves known to Mr. or Mrs.
Risdon when they visit Rode.

66 C. EVERITT-BREEDING THE EASTERN BEARDED REEDLING
BREEDING THE EASTERN BEARDED REEDLING
By Charles Everitt (Trenton, N.J., U.S.A.)

The Eastern Bearded Reedling --Panurus hiarmicus russicus --is a
sub-species of the Bearded Reedling, or Bearded Titmouse, or Reed
Pheasant, all names being synonymous, known in East Anglia, but
this species comes from the Far East.
The sexes are dissimilar in appearance, the male having a head of
blue-grey, the remainder of the upper parts being orange-tawny.
From the lores, and partly encircling the eye, is a black patch that runs
down the neck in a conspicuous moustachial streak, ending in pointed
feathers, rather like the drooping moustache of the operetta mandarin.
The scapulars are bullish-white, the secondaries being streaked with
buff, black, and tawny. The primaries and outer tail feathers are
margined in white. The chin, throat, and breast are greyish-white,
the breast having a pinkish suffusion. The flanks are tawny and the
under-tail coverts are black. The bill is orange-yellow, the legs and
feet black, and the iris yellow. The female has no moustache, the top
of her head is brown, and the remainder of the upper parts are streaked
faintly in dark brown. Further, the under-tail coverts are buff. They
are about 6J inches in total length.
Two pairs of these birds were received by Mr. Boehm from Dr. K.
C. Searle in March, 1963, and after a period in the reception room of
the main bird-house they were released into aviaries, each pair to a
different one. The pair with which we are now concerned was located
in the aviary containing the Natal Kingfishers, the breeding of which
in 1963 was recounted in Avicultural Magazine, 1964, 15. The
Reedlings, however, made no attempt to go to nest that year and it was
not until June, 1964, that they began to construct a nest. The site
they selected was a taxus bush, the upper sprigs of which the female
joined to a privet that was growing alongside. It was a deep nest, the
two plants being woven together, and it took about a week to com-
plete. The female did most of the actual work, the male bringing
pieces of material in the form of Spanish moss, dog clippings, fine
grasses, and rootlets.
The first egg was laid on 28th June, with a second and third on the
next two days. Incubation, commencing with the laying of the last
egg of the clutch, was shared, and two chicks hatched on nth July.
The other egg was clear so it was removed, and employed to obtain the
following data. Creamy white, with a pinkish suffusion, in basic colour,
it was thinly speckled with pale brown spots, and marked with wavy
hair-lines of the same colour. It measured 19 by 15 mm.
The nestlings were minute, but had most intriguing gapes of red,
the roof of the upper mandible being a deeper colour and bearing

conspicuous white spots. The whole was margined in deep orange.
For those who are familiar with the work by Dr. Joel Carl Welty,
there is a very good photograph of gaping Reedling nestlings, by
E. Hosking, on page 336 of The Life of Birds . Both parents tended to
the rearing of the chicks, the female doing most of the brooding with
the male taking over whenever she did vacate the nest. This was a
time when live ant eggs would have been invaluable, but such things
rarely can be found in any of the adjacent woodlands or pastures. As
a substitute, leaf-mould and rotting bark were collected daily and
distributed in the vicinity of the nest, plus a liberal supply of the smallest
mealworms it was possible to gather from the breeding drawers. At
six days old the young birds 5 eyes were open and they were feathering
up in tawny-orange, with black stripes. Further, the parents were
now feeding them larger mealworms and larvae, together with moths
and flies that had been caught in one of the many night insect traps
located around the grounds.
Although they left the nest on 20th July, it was considered a little
premature, and being mainly due to their having been disturbed by
a visiting television camera crew. Accordingly they were put back in
their nest, finally fledging three days later. Their colouring closely
resembled that of the adult female except that their heads were
streaked with dark chocolate, and there was a broad dark coloured
band down the centre of the back. Also, one had a black spot below
each eye, and it was revealed subsequently that this particular fledgling
was a male. It is felt that this may well be an early sex indicator but,
to be conclusive, it will be necessary to see if it occurs with any future
breedings of the species. Independence was gained on 3rd August, at
twenty-three days old.
Full adult plumage was acquired at the early age of ten weeks.
Now it is only the coloured leg bands that distinguish them from their
parents. As intimated above, one was a male and the other a female,
so the young male was removed and placed with the second adult
female received in March, 1963, the original male having died.
Immediately he was released into the other aviary he started his.
twittering call and the older female flew out of the bushes to join him.
It is hoped that further breedings of this species will be forthcoming,
not only to confirm the early sexability of the fledglings, but also
because they are such attractive birds and an appreciable addition to
any aviary collection.

BREEDING THE FAIRY BLUEBIRD AT CHESTER

By M. F. Coupe, (Chester, England)
A pair of Fairy Bluebirds (Irena puella) were purchased in May, 1964,
and later released in the Tropical House. Both birds settled down well
and during July were seen carrying nesting material.
Eventually a nesting site was chosen on a rocky ledge some 7 feet
high, at the rear of the alligator pool. The nest resembled that of a
Thrush, but mud was not used in its construction. In accordance with
general policy at Chester Zoo we disturbed the birds as little as possible.
Incubation, by the female only, commenced on 20th August. The
male bird occupied a perch nearby, making a great deal of noise in
the form of loud whistling. On 3rd September the remains of one
egg-shell were found a short distance from the nest.
The young bird was fed by both parents ; food consisting of fruit
for the first few days, then a mixture of fruit and live food and finally,
live food exclusively. The young Bluebird grew rapidly, leaving the
nest fourteen days after hatching. Although so young it appeared to
be quite strong on the wing.
Unfortunately the story has rather an unhappy ending. Seven days
after leaving the nest the young bird was attacked by a Spreo Starling
and was found drowned the following morning.

A Towhee-like bird found at a continental dealer's place by Capt.
de Quincey and sent here last October has been identified as Pogonospiza
mystacalis , the Chocolate-crowned Ground Sparrow, a native of Peru
and representing a genus new to the collection. Its general likeness to
the Towhees is such that one of its former generic names was Pipilo.
The bird, like specimens seen at the British Museum, has some white
feathers scattered here and there on the head, but not in any constant
pattern.
Other species new to the collection are a pair of Von der Decken's
Hornbills ( Tockus deckeni), purchased ; three Siberian Accentors
(.Prunella montanella) and a Pallas's Rose Finch ( Carpodacus roseus)
presented by Dr. K. C. Searle together with a young One-wattled

Four or five hundred years ago the Kite was so numerous in the
streets of London that foreign visitors were amazed by its abundance.
Since those far distant days its fortunes have declined to such an extent
that in 1905 only five birds were known to exist in its last refuge in
mid-Wales. The position is now a little improved and in 1964 there
were eighteen pairs. The results of the breeding season were, however,
poor, as only seven young were reared from seventeen nests. The
Royal Society for the Protection of Birds is particularly disturbed
because the young were removed from at least three nests and, in
spite of very extensive inquiries, they have been unable to trace them.

J. W. Steinbeck, Walnut Creek, California, has bred Scheepmaker's
Crowned Pigeon Goura scheepmakeri , of New Guinea. There are two
races ; the southern form sclateri, and the south-eastern scheepmakeri ,
Goura albertisii is a synonym of the latter.
I often regret that I was never able to obtain a good pair of Gouras.
The few offered to me at various times invariably had very defective
feet and so had to be declined.
Gouras live mostly on the forest floor searching for seeds and berries,
as well as for grubs and insects ; they also frequent river banks. I like
to imagine these hen turkey-size birds fossicking in search of food ;
a wide variety seems acceptable as even the remains of small crabs are
recorded as having been found in their stomachs.

The highlights of the June and July meetings of the Avicultural
Society of Australia are the breeding reports for the past season sub-
mitted by members. These are detailed in Australian Aviculture for
November and December. It is interesting to note that so many
Scarlet-chested Parrakeets are being bred. Some of the more successful
breeders are Ron Hastings, thirty-four reared ; Geoff Haywood,
thirty-eight; Frank Ripper, twenty-one; P. Vroegop, twenty-one
from three pairs ; and Doug Ikin, about fifty. Ikin also bred fifteen
Hooded and nine Kakariki (Red-fronted New Zealand) Parrakeets.
Amongst the five Princess of Wales's Parrakeets bred by Ron Hastings
was a blue.
Rae Mitchell, who specializes in Gouldians, reported that he had
180 young yellow-headed Gouldians flying from twenty-two pairs of
stock birds. Quite an achievement !

Vol. i, A Population Study of the Song Sparrow. Vol. 2, Behaviour
Study. By Mrs. M. M. Nice. Dover Publications, Inc., New
York, 1964. Price 1 dollar 75 cents.
Everyone interested in birds will welcome the re-publication of
these classic studies which first appeared (published by the Linnean
Society of New York) in 1937 and 1943 respectively. The Song Sparrow
(Melospiza melodia) is a drab little New World bunting with a pleasing
song that has become familiar to ornithologists throughout the world
through being chosen by Mrs. Nice as an object of study. The sub-
titles only give an idea of the main emphasis of each volume for both
contain a very great deal of information on behaviour and no one
interested in this subject can afford not to read either.
As in all her works Mrs. Nice here combines meticulous scientific
accuracy with an intense feeling for and sympathy with the living birds,
whether these are the wild ones she studied at Interpoint or the
individuals that she hand-reared and kept for even closer observations.
The wealth of information on biology, ecology, and behaviour of the
Song Sparrow is enriched by comparisons with behaviour of many
other species, Homo sapiens included. The books are illustrated with
sketches, diagrams, and photographs and contain numerous references
to other works--some equally worth reading--on birds of different
kinds.

The aviculturist who wishes to know more about birds than their
identification and breeding, will find much of interest in this concise
account of bird biology, based largely on the exhibits on this subject
in the Sanford Hall at the American Museum of Natural History,
New York. But as a result of this, many of the examples and illustra-
tions refer primarily to American birds and it is rather unfortunate
that the substitution of English names for their American equivalents
has not been more carefully checked for various mistakes in identifi-
cation have crept into the text.
The author deals first with the origin and evolution of birds and
then design for flight including diagrams of flight forces and a discus-
sion of the very complex problems concerning biophysics of bird flight.
The next chapter deals briefly with a variety of topics such as body size,
feeding, plumage coloration, classification, higher taxonomic categories,
and adaptive radiation and convergence. Migration and navigation
include recent discoveries of how some birds navigate by the stars.
Courtship and reproduction, bird songs, and calls are explained in
detail and in an appendix there is a list of the common and Latin
names of the birds cited in the book.

Mrs. Wilson's Tanager
In the January-Feburary issue of the Avicultural Magazine Mr. J. A. Johnson
is claiming a first breeding success for the " Mrs Wilson's Tanager ". So that future
confusion can be avoided I would like to point out that the latin name Calospiza
larvata fanny has been superseded by Tangara nigro-cincta fanny.
All the Galliste tanagers now have the generic name Tangara and the four races of
the " Golden Masked Tanager " are as follows:
Tangara nigro-cincta franciscae --Costa-Rica, W. Panama.
T. nigro-cincta larvata --S. Mexico, British Honduras, Honduras, E. Guatemala,
Nicaragua.
T. nigro-cincta fanny --E. Panama, W. Colombia N. W. Ecuador.
T. nigro-cincta nigro-cincta --Colombia, S. Venezuela, E. Ecuador, British Guiana,
E. Peru, W. Brazil, N. Bolivia.
All are very much alike, the differences being in size and intensity of colour--
A. J. Lawrence.

<bodyText confidence="0.995588444444445" page_id="56365740"  page_num="73" year="" vol="">
As mentioned in the very first of my articles I welcome criticism but I do demand
that any opinions differing from my own be backed by proof before they can be
considered.
Mr. A. C. Hunt (Vol. 70, No. 6) has taken exception to my treating the Twenty-
eight Parrot at the subspecific level, an arrangement officially adopted by the R.A.O.U.
Checklist in i960 (Emu, Vol. 60, No. 2). It is within Mr. Hunt's right to state his
views but the authoritative stand taken in his letter is unjustified, when there is a lack
of substantive evidence.
It is quite apparent that the writer is not familiar with modern systematic trends
and ideas, nor does he fully understand what constitutes a species. I suggest he read
such works as " Systematics and the Origin of Species " by Ernst Mayr and carefully
study modern papers dealing with ecology and distribution such as those in the
Bulletins of the American Museum of Natural History and the American Museum
Novitates treating the birds of New Guinea and the South Pacific. He would then
realize that plumage, size and even voice often have little importance, serving only
as indicative properties, when establishing the status of populations within both
continuous and interrupted distributions. It would also demonstrate that his statement
on the descriptions of the black-headed forms of Barnardius is completely meaningless.

THE SACRED KINGFISHER
(.Halcyon sanctus )
By J. Delacour (Cleres, France)
All Kingfishers are not fish-eaters, like the well-known European

and North American species (genera Alcedo and Ceryle ). Many feed
more on large insects, lizards, and other small vertebrates, sometimes
far from any water. This is the case of the birds of the large genus
Halcyon , which are found in Asia, Africa, and Oceania, as far as
Polynesia. They are rather large in size, have a thick bill, and a fairly
long tail. Most of them are brightly coloured, with a great deal of blue
in their plumage.
Halcyon are easy to keep in captivity, as they will readily feed on
meat rolled in insectivorous mixture, mealworms, and any other insects
available. One of the species often seen in zoos and private aviaries is
the Sacred Kingfisher, a rather small species, not very bright in tone,
but nevertheless quite pretty and attractive, as the accompanying plate
shows. It is confined to Australia, New Zealand, New Caledonia, and
the Loyalty Islands, with various local sub-species differing slightly in
the size of the bill, the shade of the blue upper parts and of the buff
underparts, which also vary in the barring of the breast, according to
locality, age, and sex.
Sacred Kingfishers are often seen near settlements. They are tame
and common in most places. They nest in holes in trees, also in tunnels
of banks.
The larger and brighter, but otherwise similar White-collared
Kingfisher (Halcyon chloris) is found throughout tropical Asia, from the
African coast of the Red Sea to Malaysia, east to Tonga and Samoa,
south to the New Hebrides. There are several dozen local subspecies,
all equally suitable for aviaries.
Halcyon are usually peaceful in a mixed collection, but some are
inclined to eat eggs and young birds. Very recently a Siamese White-
collared Kingfisher devoured the eggs of a Fairy Bluebird in one of
my tropical aviaries. It has, however, never molested small Waxbills,
Sunbirds, and Hummingbirds in the same enclosure.

By Derek Goodwin (London, England)
It has long been customary among ornithologists to contrast the
method of drinking used by pigeons with those of other birds such as
passerines or galliformes. It has been stated or implied that pigeons
drink by suction like a man or a horse but that other birds drink by
scooping up water and then raising the head to let it run down the
throat, the term " schlucken 55 has been widely used in the German
literature for this type of drinking movement. Aviculturists have long
been aware that many estrildines drink in an apparently identical
manner to that of pigeons and recently this knowledge has become more
widespread. It has also been discovered that some species of warblers

(1 Sylvia ) that normally drink by the " scooping up " method may drink
</equation>
<bodyText confidence="0.998542551724138" page_id="56365753"  page_num="76" year="" vol="">
in the pigeon manner when young and that among the estrildines the
method of drinking does not appear to correlate with phylogenetic
affinities, but to be connected with living in arid places and to be
an adaptation to the need to imbibe a large amount of water
quickly at a single visit to the water source. Wickler has recently
discussed drinking methods in part of a long paper on behaviour
patterns in birds (Wickler, 1961). He filmed the drinking of Diamond
Doves (Geopelia cuneata) and Long-tailed Grassfinches (.Poephila acuti-
caudo ) and showed that the throat movements of the two species were
identical. He points out that sandgrouse do not drink quite in the same
way as pigeons since they make repeated sucks and raise the head after
each. He also states that the Tooth-billed Pigeon drinks in the same
manner as a goose and that the Diamond Dove does not insert its bill
so deeply into the water when drinking as does the Domestic Pigeon
(Columba livid).
My own few observations of sandgrouse drinking are all of captive
birds in zoos but such as they are they agree with Wickler's description.
However, Meinertzhagen (1964) and others, have claimed that sand-
grouse drink by continuous sucking in the same manner as pigeons.
At least in view of the number of other birds now known to drink by
sucking and the fact that at least some sandgrouse do not drink in this
way, there is no reason for anyone to suppose that their drinking
methods indicate any close relationship between sandgrouse and
pigeons. For myself I have long thought sandgrouse are probably most
closely related to the true plovers to which, in spite of the differences
involved in their adaptation to living in arid regions and feeding on
seeds, they show many similarities, especially of behaviour.
I think that the difference between the sucking drinking of pigeons
and some others and the " scooping up 55 method may not be so

definite as has been implied. It seems to me probable that many birds
that drink " normally " suck as their bills go into the water and do not
rely solely on scooping and gravity as sometimes appears. In some
instances differences of drinking behaviour have reference to different
circumstances and may not therefore be a specific character when seen
in two different species.
Watching many species of passerine and galliform birds drink I have
always had the impression that, unless the amount of water consumed
was minute, they must at least give a " quick suck " as their bills dipped
in the water as the movements shown seldom looked as if they would
result in much water being scooped up in the lower mandible. This is
admittedly a mere subjective impression and I hope others will give
their comments. I vividly recall, although I unfortunately made no
notes on it at the time, seeing a Domestic Hen drinking from a thin
trickle of water running over concrete. She kept her bill down much
longer than is usual and I distinctly saw pulsating movements in her
throat as she did so. Both galliformes and passerines will often drink
dew or rain drops from twigs or foliage or, under artificial circum-
stances, a drop of water from the end of a slightly leaking tap or pipe.
When they do so it usually appears as if the water were sucked into the
bill, not that the bird just scoops at it " hit or miss ", in which case most
of the water drop would I should think be lost.
A tame Blue Tit that I had for some time was very fond of " multi-
vitamin If a drop of this was placed on my hand or finger the bird
would put its head sideways and suck in every bit with some throat
(and tongue ?) movements. No doubt wild Blue Tits use this technique
(as did my bird too) to eat the more liquid internal parts of insects when
these have become smeared on their perch. This putting the head
sideways and ingesting food with the bill more or less parallel to the
substrate has been claimed as part of learned behaviour used by a
Blue Tit with a deformed bill but it is, in my opinion, a completely
innate and normal part of the species' repertoire.
At the moment my only captive birds are various species of waxbills
( Estrilda , Uraeginthus , Amandava). All of these are species that are
supposed to drink in the " normal " way. I have repeatedly noticed,
however, that when they drink the head is often raised little if any
above the horizontal so that it would seem likely that at least some
suction as well as gravity is involved. Although all these forms normally
appear to use typical " scooping up " drinking movements, at least
the Blue-breasted Waxbill ( Uraeginthus angolensis ) the Cordon Bleu
( U . bengalus), the Blue-headed Waxbill ( U . cyanocephalus) , the Red-eared
Waxbill {Estrilda troglodytes) , the Rosy-rumped Waxbill {E. rhodopyga ),
and the Black-capped Waxbill ( E . nonnula) can also drink by suction.
All these, but particularly the Estrilda species will sometimes suck the
drops and smears of " honey-dew " from aphis-infested leaves. When

Typical posture of Blue-headed Waxbill when raising head after drinking in the
" normal " manner.
so-doing the bird puts its bill to the surface of the leaf and although
it may move its bill forward as if " trying " to perform the upward
scoop, the general appearance is that of a drinking pigeon. This is still
more obvious with the Uraeginthus species when consuming the white or
yolk from a waxbill's egg which has been broken through falling (laid
from the perch) or else deliberately broken for them by me. Even a very
thin layer of fresh albumen is consumed by inserting the bill, or at
least its tip, and then sucking with clearly visible throat pulsations.
The fact that these species which drink in the " usual " manner can and
do change to " pigeon-type 5 5 sucking when necessary certainly lends
support to my idea that they suck when their bill goes into the water
" to scoop " although admittedly it does not prove it.
While it is quite possible that the Diamond Dove under strictly
comparable circumstances may insert its bill less deeply into water than
does the Domestic Pigeon (Columba livid) it is certain that the latter
varies the degree to which it inserts its bill. So also does the Speckled
Pigeon (C. guinea ), the Barbary Dove (Streptopelia " risoria "), the Red-
eyed Dove ( S . semitorquata ), and, in all probability, most other pigeons.

D. GOODWIN-REMARKS ON DRINKING METHODS OF SOME BIRDS 79
A pigeon (we will assume C. guinea or C. livia , but in essentials the
behaviour described is probably general in the family) that is
(apparently) thirsty and drinking from clean, fairly deep water plunges
its bill deeply in, sometimes over the nostrils, commonly so that the
nostrils are only partly or not quite below surface level. One that is not so
thirsty (as evidenced by the lesser time spent in contact with the water)
usually inserts its bill less deeply. A pigeon drinking from shallow,
scummy water shows (unless it is very thirsty) some apparent distaste
and hesitation. It usually makes a quick side to side movement with its
bill tip just under or touching the water surface (essentially the same
movement as is used to scratch for food when the substrate is friable)
then inserts only the end of its bill in the more or less scum-cleared area
and drinks in a very " un-enthusiastic-looking " manner. A pigeon that
is desperately thirsty may plunge half its head under water in its frantic
desire to drink. Needless to say every intermediate stage between the

above described forms occurs. Incidendy, nestling pigeons and thirsty
fledglings that have not drunk (except in the course of being fed by
their parents) will, if their heads are dipped into a cup of milk or water,
commence to suck at the moment that the liquid touches their nostrils.
Although pigeons (Didunculus apparently excepted) drink by sucking
they also lift their heads after drinking in a very similar manner to that ,
of other birds. They also slightly expand the upper part of the throat
and gape and I have always thought that they take a deep breath at
this point just as we automatically do after taking a deep draught of
liquid.
Having thus given evidence to suggest that the ability to suck liquid
in an essentially pigeon-like manner is probably widespread and
certainly may be used as an alternative method by species that nor-
mally drink by the " scoop and swallow " and that therefore some
sucking probably occurs even with " typical " drinkers I must in
fairness give one piece of contrary evidence. Jays {Garrulus glandarius ),
when eating eggs, do not suck them as a waxbill does but pick up bill-
fuls of yolk and white, a rather wasteful and inefficient process where a
fresh large egg is concerned. In a natural state, however, many of the
eggs taken by the Jay are either small or partly incubated or both and
for these " eating " might be more effective than " drinking ".

By Mrs. G. W. Sharratt and Miss G. M. Sharratt
(Chellaston, Derby)
We first saw the Yellow-backed Lories in a Nottingham pet shop, and
were so impressed with their striking appearance that we decided to
purchase them right away. They were brilliantly coloured red birds,
about ioJ inches long, with a splash of yellow on their backs, green
wings, and horn coloured beaks. Their eyes were bright amber and their
feet blackish-grey. These birds are natives of the Moluccan Islands and
are extremely entertaining aviary birds as we found when they were
placed in an enclosure which was 7 feet square and 9 feet high, at the
end of a centrally-heated conservatory.
Shortly after their arrival, they were supplied with a next-box which
they soon used for sleeping in at night. In the third year of occupation
the hen laid two eggs, but after incubating them for thirty days the
chicks were found to be dead in shell on inspection. No further attempts
at breeding were made that year.
In the spring of the following year two eggs were laid and a chick was
hatched on 24th April, but it only survived two days, the other being,
once again, dead in shell. Approximately a fortnight later two more
eggs were laid. One was hatched successfully, and the other was clear,
the incubation period being twenty-eight to thirty days. This chick
only lived for six weeks having been killed in the nest by the parents.
The weather was very warm, and we noticed the Lories had been
mating again while the chick was still alive, and we could only conclude
the hen wanted to lay again as two eggs were found in the nest a few
days after the chick's death. These eggs were successfully incubated
and hatched, the nest having been kept moist with an occasional spray
of lukewarm water. The chicks were found in the nest on nth Sep-
tember and appeared to be a few days old at that time. All went well
for the first three weeks, when the chick's eyes were open and some
feathers were showing through. During this time, in addition to the
parents' usual food, maggots were given daily.
On 17th October the hen failed to appear for her morning feed when
called. On inspecting the nest the hen was found to be dead with her
claw caught in the bottom wire grid of the box. The chicks, however,
were both alive and well. Close observation over a few hours showed
that the cock was not prepared to feed his young, so they were brought
into the house and placed in a cardboard box lined with tissue paper,
which was to become their home for the next few weeks. Owing to the
liquid nature of their droppings, tissue paper was used as it was soft and
easily removed when soiled. An attempt at feeding was made with

the usual lory mixture of honey and Farex, given on the end of a spoon.
In addition, honey sweetened water and Heinz babies' apple puree was
given. At night a baby's hot-water bottle, well wrapped in a woollen
cloth and then in tissue paper to keep it clean, was placed in the box to
keep the chicks warm.
The chicks were partly feathered, with black beaks and eyes, green
wings without flight feathers, and the yellow on their backs was already
quite plain. They gave a low-pitched cry resembling a cat purr. This
continued until they were about three months old. When they were
six weeks old they weighed 5J ounces and were still feeding well every
hour until 10 p.m. at night, the next feed being at 7 a.m. in the morning.
They now took their food from a cake-icing syringe with a fine writing
tube attached, which could be placed well inside their beaks. After
every feed they had their beaks wiped with moistened cotton wool, as
they tended to throw their food about a lot.
Meanwhile, a week after the chicks were removed from the nest, the
cock, who had been pining for his mate, died, leaving the enclosure
empty. By this time they recognized our voices and squeaked when
they were spoken to, so we promptly christened them Bubble and
Squeak. In all stages of their development Squeak was quick to learn
and took the lead, Bubble following suit about two days later.
27th November. Chicks gained \ ounce in weight. Gradually, they
dictated their own feeding times, and the feeds were now spaced out
at 2 J to 3 hours according to their appetite. Bubble and Squeak were
now becoming very lively and could perch on a finger or the rim of
their box.
On 15th December they were transferred to a small parrot cage,
three sides being covered in several thicknesses of newspaper to avoid
draughts. They were able to perch and climb almost immediately.
On weighing them again they were both found to be 8 ounces.
At first a water pot was placed in the cage, but Bubble and Squeak
were still taken out to be hand fed, until it was noticed they were
drinking for themselves, when a small amount of food was placed in
another vessel. We continued with supplementary hand feeding for
about a fortnight during which time they both became independent
of us.
Now four months old, they are growing rapidly and are fully
feathered. Their eyes are gradually turning lighter and their beaks are
almost horn colour. They have just been introduced to the enclosure
where they were hatched, and are flying and climbing well.
Several well-known bird breeders of our aquaintance tell us that this
species has not been hand-reared before, and indeed has rarely been
bred in this country.

(Yuhina nigrimentum)
By W. J. Painter (Farnham, Surrey)
From 1961 to 1963 I kept a pair of Black-chinned Yuhinas in my
aviary. In summer they were kept in an outdoor flight 15 by 8 by 6 feet
and during the winter in a cage 36 by 18 by 15 inches in a heated shed.
They were rather drab in colour, brown above and buff below, with a
white chin and a tiny black patch at the base of the bill, while the
head was mostly grey. Their most conspicuous feature was a crest
formed by the elongated feathers of forehead and crown which are
black with grey edges and can be erected in a spiky tuft. In my pair
I noticed that the feathers in the crest of the cock were broader and
more rounded at the tip, while those of the hen were narrower and more
tapering, making her crest appear a little longer. The birds made up
in character for what they lacked in colour, being very active and
inquisitive. They were fed on a proprietary brand of nectar paste,
together with fruit, live food, and softbill food, and when in the flight
took such insects as they could find. It was noticed that they did not
take the nectar mixture when it was fresh, but waited until it had
become thicker and more sugary.
The cock had a rather short song of three high-pitched short notes
followed by a harsh and long-drawn-out note. Although it did not
seem very loud it could be heard plainly from about 20 yards away.
Song occurred through most of the year. In two successive summers,
1961 and 1962, the pair nested in the flight, nesting commencing in
June. The cock had a most interesting display in which he crept
through the bushes with his crest flattened, wings half spread and
quivered, tail spread, and the flank feathers fluffed so that he had an
odd flattened appearance. Throughout this performance he made a
hissing noise. The hen appeared to take no notice. Another display
also occurred in which the cock took up a position on a perch above
the hen and sang his apology for a song. On the last long note of this
he rotated forwards and downwards on the perch with wings and tail
spread to their full extent, to end hanging upside down below the perch,
in a posture suggestive of some of the Birds of Paradise, and then
righted himself and returned on to the perch again by completing the
full circle.
Both the nests built in 1961 were suspended cups attached to pieces
of heather fixed near the top of the aviary. The main structure was
made of teased-out sisal string in 6-inch lengths, and lined with a little
horsehair and vegetable down. In each case two eggs were laid. The
male assisted with the incubation, and the incubation period was

twelve to thirteen days. Unfortunately the adults deserted the young
soon after this on each occasion. It was difficult to be sure why. It
might have been due to the exposed position of the nest or to the food
requirements when there were young to be fed. Yuhinas were bred
in 1963 by T. Shute of Swindon and an account appeared in Cage and
Aviary Birds , from which it was apparent that a considerable amount of
time was spent daily in collecting insect food by beating nettle clumps,
over an open umbrella. It was found that although a large range of
insects and invertebrates were offered the adults ignored most of these
and would only feed their young on spiders and what were described
as " greenfly as large as a housefly " and were probably green plant
bugs. The species would appear to have specialized needs when
feeding young. A friend who had a pair of Yuhinas nest in 1964 lost
the single young one at fourteen days when it was about to fledge,
apparently through lack of sufficient live food.
In 1962 my pair nested again, this time in a small enclosed wicker
basket, but deserted a clutch of three eggs after about a week.
While these notes are mainly concerned with failed nestings they may
be of help to others, and there appears to be practically no information
on the display and song of this species apart from these brief notes.

The breeding pair occupy a wooden shelter about 4 feet square and
4 feet high, the floor of which is raised 3 feet off the ground. To this is
attached a small wire netting pen about 7 by 7 by 7 feet, in the top
of which is a trap-door which is opened each morning to allow the
birds complete liberty, and closed at dusk when they have returned
for their evening feed.
The cock was acquired at the end of 1961 and the hen about six
months later. Their ages were unknown as in both cases the iris had
turned white, but as they were active birds and both learned to fly
as soon as they had moulted it can be reasonably assumed that they
were young enough not to have been cramped by close confinement
for long.
I was not sure of their sex until the summer of 1964. There is no
difference in their appearance and even though I can detect one from
the other by minor idiosyncracies this is rather because I know the
birds personally than from any obvious difference. Behaviour is the

clue. The cock blushes when excited--his bare face assuming a deep
pink. He nods his head up and down as a form of greeting at the same
time " blazing 55 his eyes by contracting the pupil. The hen is less
demonstrative. She seldom blushes and when she does her face hardly
colours at all.
These are the only differences I can detect between a known
breeding pair. If one looks very carefully head on at them the culmen
of the hen's beak does look slightly narrower and more arched but
the difference is so slight as to be unreliable. Birds are not cast in a
mould like machines, they vary individually in facial expression and
structure as much as other animals--otherwise how can they recognise
each other ?--and to lay down hard and fast rules about width of
skull and beak can be misleading.
Another factor which can cause confusion is that immature macaws
seem to form " friendships " rather than pairs. We now have a dozen
specimens at Rode comprising the Blue and Yellow, Red and Yellow,
and Red and Blue, or Green-winged species. All these live at controlled
liberty ; that is to say they are free during the day and shut up at
night so they all have access to one another. I have known cases
where two and sometimes three birds will pal up, sitting together and
preening one another--behaviour which is apt to lead one to hasty,
but quite wrong conclusions.
The Blue and Yellow pair of which I am writing were at first
friendly with a Red and Blue. All three birds flew together and shared
the same house. They were even on occasions seen trying to mate high
up in the trees. It was only when the Blue and Yellows started to
breed that the Red and Blue was driven off. It flew 30 miles away
and had to be retrieved by car. Even now I do not know its sex. At
one time I had felt sure it was a hen as I thought I had seen it mating
with the cock Blue and Yellow but it has since palled up with a small
Red and Yellow which I had assumed (perhaps wrongly) was a hen,
so I am none the wiser.
To return to the Blue and Yellow pair, after the Red and Blue was
driven away it became obvious that something was afoot. They
started to scratch about in the sunflower seed husks on the floor of their
wooden roosting shelter, backing into a corner with their tails crossed
over one another and threatening me when I looked in. So, more as
an experiment than anything else, I gave them an old open topped
wooden box which happened to be made of extra stout timber. To
my surprise they took to it immediately so I hastily half filled it with
broken up rotten wood which they proceeded to chew up in typical
parrot fashion. This was at the beginning of July and by 27 th July the
first egg was laid followed by a second two days later. The hen covered
the first egg most of the time and began to sit in earnest when the
second was laid. At no time did I find the cock incubating although he

would get into the box beside his mate to threaten me when I opened
the shelter door to feed them.
As incubation wore on the cock became bored with his own company
and often sought the companionship of his human friends. If my wife
or I happened to be sitting in the garden he would fly across to join us,
perching quietly on the back of a chair or a nearby branch. This was
no cupboard love, although he dearly loved a bit of bread and butter
or cake, for he would often come when we were not eating. For those
who see a bird only as an automaton dominated by stimuli and
reflexes, this bit of my story will sound like anthropomorphism, but
the fact remains that here was a bird with a mate of his own, with the
company of other macaws around, completely free to fly where he
wished, who chose the company of those human beings whom he knew
and trusted for the sake of their company and nothing else. This has
been one of the most rewarding experiences I have ever had in all my
many relationships with animals.
It is I know easy enough to tame a confined bird especially if it is
hand-reared and therefore " imprinted " on human beings, but it is
quite another thing to bridge the gulf which divides ourselves from wild
things (I expressly exclude here domestic animals) and establish an
understanding on mutual terms with a creature which is not bound
to do so.
I would add that neither of this pair is hand tame. They will fly
to us when called but decline to be touched.
One of the eggs hatched on 22nd August ; which one of course I do
not know, but this establishes the incubation period as between
twenty-four and twenty-six days. When I was able to retrieve the other
I found it contained a partly developed embryo. The eggs are small for
the size of the bird--a bit larger than those of a pigeon. It was
impossible to see the chick during the first week or so as both parents
guarded it jealously. Friendly as they were towards us away from the
breeding house, we had only to approach it if they happened to be out
for them to dive straight down and in through the entrance hole.
As the chick began to grow so did the parents' appetite. Seed and
fruit were not enough. It was obvious that they needed bulk which
was easy to swallow and regurgitate. Bread liberally smeared with
butter was a favourite, closely followed by cake and sweet biscuit.
Large amounts of cooked meat and fat were also eaten avidly. I know
this is against all the rules but it becomes increasingly evident to me
that the larger parrots at any rate do require animal food. They eat it
greedily at all times whether they are breeding or not.
After the first week I managed most days to have a peep at the
youngster when both parents were out exercising. It was naked and
blind, in fact like an enlarged young Budgerigar of the same age. On
one occasion I had a qualm as it lay on its back and seemed unable

to right itself so I gently turned it over. For the first four weeks it
grew rapidly without showing signs of feathering. Then the wings
began to darken as the quills came through. The beak darkened and
the eyes opened and from then on it was conscious of intruders and
scrambled out of sight if it could under an overhanging ledge on the box.
The wings and back were the first to feather, then the tail started to
sprout, the head and body to darken and the characteristic black
streaks on the face became apparent. At ten weeks the young macaw
was well feathered, but the tail and flight feathers were still short.
At twelve weeks it clambered out and perched on the rim of the nest-
box and at thirteen weeks it came out into the open with its parents.
At this stage it was slightly smaller than them, its eyes were dark and
the beak was smaller and less hooked, but its plumage was every bit as
brilliant as that of the old birds.
It soon learned its way out of the trap in the flight and took wing
closely accompanied by the old pair. It flew strongly from the start
but landed in the trees clumsily for the first few times. Having found
its way out it seemed stupid about returning and in spite of the com-
bined efforts of its parents and myself it did not grasp the idea of
re-entering the trap-door in the flight. It ran all over the wire netting
top trying to get in, but ignored the trap-door.
It was now December, the nights were getting cold and I was
worried about so young a bird roosting out. So after it had been
out a week I managed to put a net over it one evening after dark as it
roosted on top of the flight. I kept it in for about a week and let it out
again, but the same thing happened so the next time I decided to
confine it to the aviary for the winter.
Now at the time of writing (March, 1965) the youngster is just over
six months old, as big as its parents and except for the dark eyes is
indistinguishable from them.

In Avicultural Magazine, 1961, page 175, there is a very detailed
record of the breeding of the Rufus-bellied Niltava by Mr. Kenneth A.
Norris after, as so often experienced with this type of bird, many
setbacks. I can well recall Mr. Norris's hopes way back in 1958, and
I was more than pleased to read of his success in 1961, despite the fact
that he pipped us at the Edward Marshall Boehm Aviaries for the
first breeding of this species in captivity.
It was in December, i960, that Mr. Boehm acquired a pair of these
birds which were released, early in 1961, into a planted aviary of
16 by 30 feet. They shared this with a pair each of Blacked-chinned
Yuhinas and White-browed Wood Swallows, both species having been
bred the previous year, A. S., i960, 229 ; a pair of Black-headed
Sugarbirds, and one or two odd species of other small birds. The
Niltavas, however, made no attempt to go to nest, the female dying
later that year. There had been no disagreement witnessed between
them, in fact they ignored each other, and when she was picked up
obviously sick, she was well fed and unmarked, indicating that she had
neither been attacked nor kept off her feed in any way.
It was not until February, 1962, that Mr. Boehm was able to obtain
any more, and then a shipment of two pairs, both males dead on
receipt, arrived. After a suitable period of acclimatization in the cage-
room, one of the females was placed with the original male. As with
the previous pair they ignored each other completely until about
March, 1964, when the male began to chase the female, finally
attacking her. Fortunately one of us saw this happen so the female,
damaged about the head, was secured and returned to the cage-room
where she made a full recovery. However, since the male was now
singing all day, it was decided to try the other female with him. It
must have been a case of love at first sight for they settled down well
together and, in May, she built a nest in a wire basket just under the
roof of the aviary.
Four eggs were laid but these, and the nest, had disappeared seven
days later. She then selected a hole in the wall of the main bird-house
that formed one end of their aviary. The nest, untidily built, as
emphasized by Mr. Norris in his article, was completed early in June
and, over the period the 7th to the 10th, four more eggs were laid.
These appeared at first sight to be uniformly coloured pinkish-brown
but, on closer examination, it could be seen that they were basically
whitish, speckled very finely with pinkish-brown, giving the uniform
impression. They measured 16 by 20 mm.

<bodyText confidence="0.995488466666666" page_id="56365768"  page_num="89" year="" vol="">
Incubation, by the female only, apparently began on the laying of
the second egg for, on the 24th, two hatched with a third the following
day. However, by the 26th, all the chicks and the remaining egg had
disappeared. This, judging by the agitation of the female, was the
work of a predator. At that time we had Eastern Hoopoes with young
in the nest, and a Masked Wood Swallow, mated to a White-browed
Wood Swallow, had three first cross youngsters, just fledged, in the same
aviary, together with the normal run of mice that it was impossible to
keep out. Who was the predator ? That was the question to be
answered. In an endeavour to pin it down, a clear egg from a Black-
headed Sugarbird was placed in the Niltava's nest and arrangements
made for it to be kept under surveillance during the daylight hours.
This latter precaution was unnecessary, however, for within ten
minutes of my leaving the aviary and taking up first watch, the male
Masked Wood Swallow flew straight to the nest and took the egg out.
He held it undamaged in his bill flying over to the tree where his young
had perched, cracked the egg on the branch and fed the contents to
them. Without further ado the Swallow family was caught up and
transferred to another aviary where no nestings were taking place.
On 7th July, the Niltava laid again, the full clutch being completed
by the 10th, the same calendar dates as those in June. This time
three hatched on the 22nd, the fourth egg being clear, so maybe the
commencement of incubation does not occur until the clutch is
completed. Due to the location of the nest it was not possible to get
sufficient light on to them to see the colour of their gapes but, at eight
days old their eyes were open and they were feathering up in a darkish
colour, flecked with a lighter shade. They all fledged on the same day,
4th August, and were sexable immediately, the male being coloured as
described by Mr. Norris, the two females being much lighter and with
distinct white throat patches. They were independent by the 15th, and
had to be removed from their parents as the adult male began to
persecute them.
Although not visible, the females did possess the blue tabs on the
neck for these were disclosed on catching them up and parting the
neck feathers with one's fingers. Now, March, 1965, the male is in full
adult colour and the blue tabs on the females are just beginning to
show through.
The parent birds had one more clutch later in August, but all the
eggs were clear and were used to obtain the descriptive data mentioned
above. Since then the male attacked the female and, although rescued,
she had been badly injured about the head and died the same day.
However, we do have one further adult male and three adult females,
and it is planned to pair some of these with the young birds with the
hope of producing more of these most attractive birds. The main
problem will be selecting aviaries for the various pairs as they are

inclined to be aggressive, more in a bullying manner than definitely
antagonistic for, if the other bird flies off, normally all is well. Most
of these attacks occur during live-food feeding times so it is often
possible to check any real damage, the danger really existing when it is
natural live-food that is being competed for by the birds.

The various buildings and accommodation of zoological gardens
never cease to need being improved, while some of them even require
periodical replacements. Indoor installations for birds belong to the
latter category.
American zoos, compared to those in Europe, have always been
relatively well equipped with such installations. But modern techniques
for keeping and displaying flying birds have changed considerably
for the better during the last twenty years, and, in the principal zoos,
the old-style bird houses, with lots of small cages, have gradually
been replaced by more attractive ones. Existing buildings have been
completely overhauled and transformed in Philadelphia and Chicago
for example, and new ones built in other cities. The Bronx Zoo
in New York opened last year (1964) a very beautiful aquatic
bird house and an entirely new house for small birds is due to be
erected soon.
The National Zoo at Washington had a large bird house, completed
some thirty years ago. It was then considered good and up-to-date,
but after all these years the house was the worse for wear, and the
accommodation had become antiquated. It was decided to use the
old structure, but to rebuild and to change it completely inside. Its
transformation started in 1963, as the first phase of a ten-year project
for the complete rehabilitation and improvement of the entire zoo,
under the care of Dr. T. Reed, the Director, and a group of architects.
The National Zoo is a part of the Smithsonian Institution, which
administers the museums and other establishments of learning of the
capital of the United States and is directed by a Secretary. Our
colleague Professor Dillon Ripley was appointed early last year to
that position, perhaps the most important of its kind in the country.
Being particularly interested in zoos and in aviculture, he asked me to
help by becoming Consultant for the National Zoo, a task that I was
happy to accept.
The major part of the work in the bird house had already been

completed before I began to be concerned with it. I could only
supervise the details of the technical arrangements and the decoration
of the aviaries. But I hasten to say that I had little reason to regret it.
Wherever possible the exhibits have been designed for the eye-level
of a child rather than an adult. Instead of stairs, there are ramps
whose maximum grades have been kept within 10 per cent. Visual
barriers between the visitors and the animal have been eliminated
or minimized through the use of curved glass, straight glass, or fine
stainless steel wire. Exhibits are on only one side of walkways, to aid
the visitor in his orientation and to create a one-way traffic pattern.
Labels have been designed to permit easier reading for children and
for people using bifocals. Many labels are situated a few inches from
the floor and are slanted about 45 degrees. They consist of coloured
photographs embedded in transparent fibre glass and are back-lighted
by fluorescent lights in the sign boxes.
The bird house has twenty-seven exhibit cages, a large flight room,
and two indoor-outdoor cages. Some of the cages have removable
wall panels that provide flexibility in cage size ; some feature indepen-
dent control of temperature and humidity ; and some have fronts
consisting of series of vertical-tensioned, small-diameter wires that
provide maximum viewing. Each exhibit is equipped with facilities
that reflect the needs of a particular group of birds.
In the service area, on the lower level, are a shower room and
locker room for keepers, two offices, bird-kitchen and scullery, with
modern stainless steel equipment, a dumb-waiter, an incubator room,
seven " holding " or quarantine cages, a feed-storage room, a storage
area for carts and utensils, a utility room, and public rest rooms.
In the central flight room, birds fly free in a simulated rain forest.
Rods in the clear plastic ceiling have nozzles for which " rain " falls
on areas planted with exotic trees and shrubs. The visitor strolls along
the winding walks beneath the birds in flight, and he enjoys an
unobstructed view of the tropical aviary from 9-foot-high ramps along
two of the walls. The flight room is 72 feet long, 51 feet high, and
32 feet high.
The flamingo exhibit comprises an indoor-outdoor habitat divided
by sliding glass doors. In warm weather the doors will be opened and
the pinioned flamingos will stroll outdoors, in and around a 50-foot
pool. This outdoor area is believed to provide ample space for flamingo
breeding. When landscaping is completed the flamingos' outdoor
area will be separated from the visitors' area only by a low hedge.
These bird installations, practically all indoor, will soon be supple-
mented by a great flight cage, almost ready for use at present. Its
tent-like shape is outlined by six slender parabolic arches of steel, and
the whole is enclosed by a netting of vinyl-covered wire with a 1- by
2-inch mesh that forms a circle 130 feet in diameter. The mesh is

attached by clips to 72 half-inch cables of wire rope radiating from the
90-foot mast.
There are already a number of aviaries in the zoo, some very spacious,
so that there is room for a very comprehensive collection. There will
be suitable facilities for a great deal of observation and experimentation
with live birds, as one of our aims is to build up an adequate centre for
scientific research.
There is no doubt that the aesthetic value of the new bird house,
particularly the great hall, will increase during the coming years when
the trees and shrubs have grown to their proper size, and also as our
collection continues to improve. I am, however, glad to say that after
just over three months, both vegetation and birds appear to prosper in
a very satisfactory manner.

Mr. A. V. Marques has presented a specimen of Xipholena atropur-
purea , the Brazilian Chatterer, which represents a genus new to the
collection. This bird is very like the well known Pompadour Chatterer
(.X . punicea), but is darker in body colour ; X. lamellipennis is rather
similar, but has a white tail and longer wing-coverts, and so the three
would appear to be closely related.
An Ashy Starling ( Cosmopsarus unicolor) , a species not previously in
the collection, and two Red-billed Buffalo Weavers ( Bubalornis albiro-
stris intermedius) a new subspecies, have been presented by Mr. M. C.
Harris together with two Ring-necked Doves (Streptopelia capicola), a
Vinaceous Dove (S. vinacea), a Mourning Dove (S. decipiens), an
African Palm Dove ( S . senegalensis) , a Cape or Namaqua Dove ( Oena
capensis), and a Black-billed Sparrow Weaver [Rlocepasser mahali melanor-
hynchus).
Other arrivals of particular interest are a Sulphur- and White-
breasted Toucan, a pair of Hartlaub's Turacos, and a pair of Shelley's
Starlings ( Spreo hildebrandti shelleyi). Dr. H. T. Ferreira, who brought
the Xipholena already referred to, some specimens of Cotinga cincta and,
among others, two Pteroglossus viridis humboldti, has given fourteen
tanagers-- Tangara fastuosa , T. flava , Ramphocelus carbo , R. bresilius ,
Thraupis bonariensis, T. ornata , and Tanagrella velia.
A pair of Palm Doves from Tripoli were presented by Dr. E. Hufnagl
who wrote, " They live entirely in the tops and fronds of the many
thousands of date palms of this city and come only occasionally down
to pick up some grains. They feed on dates too. They are a lovely
sight when, early in the morning as soon as the first sunlight colours
the tops of the palms, they begin to stir, call to one another, cooing
softly in the way of the Turtle Doves and then, in a graceful rapid
flight, come down to the water tanks to drink."
A Wood Pigeon that was found in the Gardens as a fledgling in 1948,
and has lived at the Pheasantry ever since, has recently died.

In the January-February number of the Magazine I mentioned a
pair of Cormorants in St. James's Park. A. W. May, Birdkeeper,
informs me that four were released on the lake. They appeared to be
doing quite well but unfortunately one was lost. The intention is to
replace it.

On his retirement, after fifty years' service, G. B. Stratton, Librarian,
was awarded the Silver Medal of the Zoological Society of London,
" in recognition of his devoted service to the Society's publications and
Library."
It is opportune to mention that for some years past Mr. Stratton has
been responsible for the very concise Index to the Magazine.

The trials and disappointments of an aviculturist ! One of our
members who specializes in Grass Parrakeets writes : " Last season was
the most disappointing I have ever had. A pair of Turquoisines
hatched eleven youngsters in two nests and let them all die when they
were about three weeks' old. Blue-wings hatched four youngsters and
refused to feed them. Splendids laid infertile eggs, and a hen Hooded
died from egg-binding in November." Our member does not, however,
despair, and ends his letter : " I am hoping for better things this year."

In the last number of the Magazine A. J. Lawrence pointed out, quite
rightly, that Calospiza has been superseded by Tangara. The correct
scientific name of Mrs. Wilson's Tanager would now appear to be
Tangara nigrocincta francescae.
Dr. P. L. Sclater, A Monograph of the Birds Forming the Tanagrine
genus Calliste , page 84, published in 1857, writes : " I have thought it
right slightly to modify the designation of this Calliste , calling it
" francescae " instead of "fanny ", as the latter appellation is neither
Latin nor like Latin, the language in which all scientific nomenclature
ought to be written."

F. A. Ripper, Secretary and Treasurer, Avicultural Society of
Australia, reports of the last breeding season : " I bred Indian
Ringnecks for the first time, five in one nest; Princess Alexandras for
the first time, four in one nest; and Barrabands, six in one nest. The
latter, I believe, to be abnormal as five seems to be the usual maximum
in the wild. I managed to keep my number of Bleeding Hearts level
with two reared ; offsetting the loss of two adult birds due to the
Indian Ringnecks killing one and a second falling victim to another
Bleeding Heart."

Fortunate indeed are those members, and I know just a few, who
possess any of John Gould's works. The sale prices of all the classic
ornithological books with colour plates are rising steadily, but none
more so than for Gould's works. At a recent Sotherby's sale copies of
several were sold. The Birds of Australia , eight volumes, with 68 1 hand-
coloured plates, published in 1840-1869, realized #4,400 ; The Birds
of New Guinea , five volumes, 320 hand-coloured plates, 1875-1888
(completed after Gould's death by Bowdler Sharpe), #2,400 ;
A Monograph of the Trochilidae, or Family of Humming-birds , six volumes,
418 hand-coloured plates, 1849-1887 (completed by Bowdler Sharpe),
#2,300.

Nowadays the Budgerigar, to all intents and purposes a domestic
species, is rarely mentioned in our pages. Longevity in birds is always
a matter of considerable interest, hence the mention now.
Brian Vesey-Fitzgerald, who conducts the pets' column of a Sunday
newspaper, recently mentioned a Budgerigar that had died aged
sixteen and a half years. As the potential life-span of Budgerigars bred
in captivity is believed to be about twelve years, Vesey-Fitzgerald
wondered whether this age was perhaps a record. As a result he
received a shoal of letters from readers having aged birds. He
summarizes : " Now I know of one budgie of twenty-five years, two of
twenty-two, six of twenty (one ringed as a nestling by the breeder),
nine of nineteen (one ringed), twenty-eight of eighteen (one ringed)
and thirty-six of seventeen (two ringed)."
As is usual on such occasions the evidence for all the very old birds
is not as conclusive as one could wish. The ringed twenty-year-old is
within a few weeks of twenty-one and still lively and talking.

It is a very remarkable fact that whereas Mandarin and Carolina or
Wood Duck are supposedly so closely related they show a very
marked reluctance to mate with each other. The Carolina has pro-
duced hybrids with a number of other species but the Mandarin has
totally failed in this respect. The explanation is that the Mandarin
possesses a number of chromosomes differing from that of all other
Anatidae. Authorities are in agreement that this makes hybridization
extremely unlikely, if not actually impossible.
But are the pundits now to be confounded by events at the Tracy
Aviaries, Salt Lake City, last year ? George Allen and Calvin Wilson
have collaborated in writing an article in the Game Bird Breeders ,
Pheasant Fanciers and Aviculturists ' Gazette , January, 1965. In this they
describe the rearing of two hybrids of this cross, both drakes. The
parentage of one is given as Mandarin X Wood Duck, and of the other
as Wood Duck x Mandarin. Only these two hybrids are known to have

been produced from the two nests. If there were any young females they
were not detected--they could have joined the free-flying flock.
The male parents appear to have been free-flying from the wild
flock. Although the writers seem to have no doubt concerning the
parentage there must always be very considerable uncertainty when
one at least of the parents is full-winged and strict control is not
exercised.
One sentence, and by sentence I intend its dual meaning, in the
account I do not like. This reads : " The fate of the two Mandarin-
Wood Duck hybrids is that they are to be killed and mounted for
display at the administration building at the Jean Delacour World
Waterfowl and Game Bird Preservation Center, for this is truly an
interesting freak of nature."

I expect that at one time or another most of us have thought how
nice it would be to import our own birds. Some of us have, of course,
been quite successful in this respect. But any such venture can lead to
great disappointment and considerable financial loss. This can be
illustrated by two recent reports from aviculturists resident abroad.
I think they had perhaps better remain nameless. The first writes from
America : "I was in hopes of obtaining some doves and pigeons
through a friend, who after spending three months in the Philippine
Islands, was able to collect a large number of fruit pigeons as well as
Bleeding Hearts. When he had them nicely tamed, he brought the lot
(over ioo) to this country by way of Honolulu, where a very unco-
operative veterinary at Customs had them all destroyed. They had
been 16 hours en route and were therefore a little rough in plumage,
but otherwise in good condition. He did not even examine them or
admit them into quarantine, just glanced at them and condemned the
entire lot."
And the second report, also from America, says : "I purchased six
Demoiselle Cranes from a firm in England that guarantees live arrival.
They shipped them very promptly, via B.O.A.C., to San Francisco.
They arrived late one evening and we were there when the plane came
in. One bird was dead upon arrival, another one died en route home,
another one was dead at daylight the next morning and the fourth one
died that morning. The other two are still alive and doing O.K. I cut
off the heads of the four dead birds, dried them, and sent them to the
suppliers, along with a bad order report from B.O.A.C., stating that
four birds died. They claim that since only one bird arrived dead that
is all they will replace, but I think that is drawing the line pretty thin.
If I had not taken delivery until the next morning four would have been
dead. They recently wrote me that they would replace the one dead
bird and sell me the other three at a reduced price of $40.00 each."

EUROPE : A NATURAL HISTORY. By K. Curry-Lindahl.
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.98641225" page_id="56365781"  page_num="98" year="" vol="">
Hamish Hamilton, London, 1964. Price 94?. 6 d.
In this superbly illustrated book Dr. Curry-Lindahl surveys the
European continent, selecting eighteen typical regions and examining
the animal and plant life in relation to the landscape in order to present
a simple but effective picture of its ecology. His own experiences have
enabled him to present a more intimate and lively picture of the
various parts. In the text and in the coloured and monochrome
illustrations the birds have close competition from landscape, flowers,
and mammals, but at least we are here able to see them in their true
context as part of a complex biological pattern. An attempt to discuss
so much in a limited space makes arbitrary selection inevitable at times,
a fact which one notices most in a discussion of the British Isles, but a
convincing overall picture is given of the wildlife of Europe from the
Mediterranean to the Arctic ; and the factors which have, and are,
influencing it are also discussed.
For those of us who keep birds in aviaries a work of this kind must
always raise the query--" is the limited distribution of so many of
these species due to an accident of environment and competition or do
they find something in their habitat which is absolutely vital to their
well-being and survival ? " Examining the present situation one is
struck by the fact that the only species that we keep with any real
success are semi-desert species, accustomed to extremes of temperature
and food shortage, and ready to breed at any time if food, water, and
nest-site are available. If we are to succeed with more species we
should perhaps examine more closely these studies of birds as part of
an environment and try to decide what the factors are that create a
suitable habitat in which a species might maintain itself for perpetuity.

AUSTRALIAN PARRAKEETS. By Dr. H. D. Groen, Haren
(Gr.), Holland, 1965. Price 635. net.
The Dutch edition Australische Sittighe was reviewed in the
January-February, 1964, number of the Magazine. A German edition
followed and now, with a view to a very much wider circulation, an
edition in English has been published. This edition shows two interesting
additions, coloured plates of a pair of lutino Rosellas, and also of the
synthetic Paradise Parrakeet (Golden-shouldered X Many-coloured),
both from photographs supplied by Sir Edward Hallstrom.
The previous reviewer observed that the colour reproduction,
though good, in many cases did not do full justice to the brilliance of the

living bird. There is now a marked improvement in the quality of the
plates and in a number of cases replacements have been made.
The reviewer has had nearly fifty years 5 experience of keeping and
breeding parrakeets and is, in consequence, very critical of any books
on the subject. On this occasion he is unable to find anything to
criticize !
Finally, Dr. Groen acknowledges his indebtedness to W. R.
Partridge who read through the manuscript and made any necessary
corrections--a very happy choice of collaborator.

Pest Control in the Garden and Aviary
Many articles have been written about pest control in aviaries and cages,
particularly where red mite, greenfly, and grey lice are in evidence. For many years
I have kept all classes of birds and have, as many breeders must admit, suffered losses
from red mite attacks. I do, of course, refer to the wooden cages.
About a year ago I painted my cages with a new (at least to me) paint, and
lo and behold ! exit the red mite, grey lice, bluebottles, flies, the lot--and not for
once either--at all times do they remain clear of my cages.
In the past few years, I have painted my cages annually, scrubbed them, used
formaldehyde, paraffin, and a host of different sprays. These have been effective for
a little while, three to four months, then back again the little horrors came, in what
seemed a bigger force than ever before. The poor birds puffed up like balls of feathers,
some even died. Then I discovered this completely new type of insect pest killer.
It is so simple that one wonders why it had not been thought of before, it is
permanently effective, yet harmless to even the most sensitive of birds and humans
also. If any insect gets on the cage for more than 15 seconds it is bound to die.
Now, this new revolutionary insecticidal agent is an emulsion paint recently
evolved by the Walpamur Co., of Darwen, Lancs., and what is more they claim it is
fully effective for the decorative life of the paint, and even if you only paint once in
two years the new additive called " IFGA ", Insect and Fly Control Agent, now
incorporated in Walpamur emulsion paint, is effective as the day it was applied.
The makers claim that the additive does in no way impair the performance of
decorative qualities of the paint, it is available in all colours and is inter-mixable and,
what is more, it is no dearer than any other standard paint of the same five-year
quality that is sold on the market to-day.
I know from past experience that red mite on cage birds is a pest that kills, so I am
delighted that I have found a paint that kills and keeps away red mite and IFGA does
just that.
My wooden cages are kept in a temperature of 65* F., an ideal breeding ground
for red mite. All the traps, breeding barrels, perch ends now show no signs of red mite
at all thanks to IFGA.
IFGA should not be confused with the deadly Aldrin, Dieldrin, and D.D.T. ;
these are detrimental to life, but a child could lick the surface of a toy painted with
Walpamur emulsion paint for a long time before even any mild toxic symptoms
would appear.
I have therefore no hesitation in recommending the Walpamur emulsion paint
to my colleagues in the bird world, with complete confidence that it will be the means
of ridding cages, show cages, and everything we so earnestly treat every year, of vermin.

BRIEF FIELD OBSERVATIONS ON THE MEXICAN
PARROTLET
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.9247149" page_id="56365794"  page_num="" year="" vol="">
By Joseph M. Forshaw (Canberra, Australia)
Summary
The Mexican Parrotlet (Forpus cyanopygius Souance) was the subject
of limited observations, during January, 1965, at Alamos, Sonora,
Mexico, and a brief account is given of the flight, voice, and feeding.
Introduction
Description .--The adult male Mexican Parrotlet has an overall
length of 5-5 inches (140 mm.). The upper parts are mainly dull
green, with the forehead and sides of the head bright yellowish-green.
Bright turquoise blue is exhibited on the greater wing-coverts, lower
back, rump, and underwing-coverts, while the underparts are yellowish-
green. The short, pointed tail is green on the upper side and yellow-
green underneath. The rather large, thick bill is horn coloured, the
iris yellow, and the feet greenish-grey. The adult female differs in having
the blue replaced by bright green. This small, stocky parrot somewhat
resembles the familiar African Lovebird (Agapornis spp.) in general
appearance.
Distribution .--Blake [Birds of Mexico , 1953) gives the range of this
endemic Mexican species as the arid foothills and lowlands from south-
eastern Sonora in the north to Colima and Zacatecas in the south. It
is also found on the Tres Marfas Islands off the coast of Nayarit.
Throughout these areas most types of country below 4,000 feet
(1,250 m.) are inhabited.
Habitat
These observations were made on the outskirts of the town of Alamos
which is about 30 miles inland from Navojoa in the state of Sonora
near its southern border. The town and surrounding area are about
1,600 feet (500 m.) above sea level, but one small mountain, which is
shown in the right background of the accompanying plate, rises to
1,787 feet (about 560 m.).

02 J. M. FORSHAW-FIELD OBSERVATIONS ON THE MEXICAN PARROTLET
Situated in the foothills of the main mountain range known as the
Sierras, Alamos is the centre of an agricultural community. The
countryside consists of hills covered by forest and scrublands inter-
spersed with cultivated farmlands. A few seasonal watercourses wind
their way down from the higher mountains and it is along these that
the larger trees are found. These trees are mainly oak and a type of
native Ficus sp. A few conifers are present but these are uncommon.
While the author was in the area the creeks were dry, but the larger
trees still attracted the parrots and all the birds seen were frequenting
this particular habitat.
Flight
Generally observed in small flocks numbering about forty birds, the
parrots seemed to understand the principles of formation flying when
on the wing and they moved in perfect unison. This resulted in the
flock twisting and turning as one bird.
Flying at only 6 to io feet above the ground, they showed flashes of
bright green while darting through the trees and over the lower shrubs.
On leaving the uppermost branches of a tree the flock would literally
dive towards the ground, continue to fly at the characteristically low
level, then rise suddenly to alight once again in the upper branches of
another tree.
The very swift and direct flight is undertaken with short rapid wing-
beats without any noticeable periods of gliding. While in the air the
screeching call-note is emitted continuously.
It is interesting to note that some reports indicate that flights at
high altitudes are undertaken by these birds when travelling to and
from feeding and watering localities. Although this was not observed
in the field, the strong powers of flight suggest that such reports are
probably correct.
Voice
When perched in the treetops or flying overhead, the contact call is
used to maintain union within the flock. This high-pitched, rolling
screech is surprisingly penetrative and may be heard for a considerable
distance. While feeding, an occasional single, high-pitched note is
given.
Feeding
Feeding was only seen once. Two flocks flew into the large Ficus tree
illustrated in the accompanying plate. Although the author assumed
an observing position directly under the tree soon after the parrots had
alighted, it proved virtually impossible to locate the individual birds,
so well did their green plumage blend with the foliage. When a piece
of wood was struck against the trunk of the tree they took fright and

flew into a nearby oak tree. While in the very upright alert stance now
adopted the blue rumps of the males were very conspicuous. After
some five minutes they returned to resume feeding and, by carefully
following a group of three males, the author was able to compile these
notes on the mode of feeding.
Before settling down to feed there was much calling and fluttering.
Feeding was very methodical and the birds worked their way through
the outermost branches examining, or even tasting, all the fruit and
eating that which had reached a satisfactory stage of development.
Most pieces falling to the ground suggested a preference for fruit which,
although still green, was beginning to ripen. The continual shower of
falling pieces of fruit, and the occasional emission of the high-pitched
note described above would appear to be the features most likely to
betray the presence of these charming parrots while they are feeding.
Conclusion
These field observations are by no means extensive enough to serve
as standard examples of behaviour for the Mexican or Blue-rumped
Parrotlet. However, they do provide information that should be of
some benefit to future field observers in Mexico.

this country. It is a native of the River Plate area of the Argentine and
Uruguay and of the mountainous regions of S.E. Brazil. I always
admired the specimen caged for so many years at the London Zoo,
but it was not until 1962 that I saw a pair in a dealers shop and
purchased them at a reasonable price. Though it was in autumn, the
birds were placed in an outdoor aviary with a heated shelter and both
survived comfortably the very severe winter of 1963. I think they were
both cock birds. In the following winter one bird died, but I was able
to buy another bird from a private importer in April, 1964. This bird
was undoubtably a hen and I was disappointed when no breeding
was attempted last summer. Last winter the pair were placed in
another aviary with a mixed collection of softbills and seedeaters.
They spent most of the daylight hours in the flight regardless of weather
and had to be shut in the shelter each night. They interfered with
none of the other occupants. An excellent article on the White-capped
Tanager by Mr. H. C. Martin together with a photograph appeared in
the Avicultural Magazine in June, 1939. A coloured illustration
appears in Pageantry of Tropical Birds , by J. Th. Descourtilz, which
really does justice to this very attractive Tanager. Unlike most
Tanagers, it is not a greedy bird and is simply catered for.
In general the bird is coloured deep blue all over, with the wings and
tail darker and with a lighter blue patch on each shoulder. The head
is capped with white in the centre of which is a deep red tuft. The
hen has a less prominent cap and red tuft, otherwise the sexes are
alike The legs are slate-blue as is the beak which is stout and like a
Cardinal's in shape. In Mr. Martin's article he mentions that the bird
is sometimes called the Cardenal Azul (Blue Cardinal) or the Cardenal
Imperial. We exhibited one or other of our pair at a few shows but
without much success. They need a really good light to show them to
advantage.
In early April, 1965, I noticed that both birds were being bullied
by some of the other occupants of the aviary and in particular by a
Paradise Tanager, so I removed them to a planted summer aviary
measuring 9 feet long by 6 feet wide by 6 ft. 3 in. high which had the
roof partly covered at one end. Another small shelter at the same end
protected the food. A nest-basket was placed 5 feet up under the
covered roof section at one corner and two nest-boxes with open fronts
were at similar heights away from each other. The aviary, like all our

others, had been heavily limed during the winter and re-seeded with
grass. A large log on the ground, a number of shrubs, and a well grown
cupressus provided ample cover. We had a near miss with Natal
Robins in the same aviary last year when they nested in a box, laying
but not hatching their three eggs.
On 19th April I noticed the hen Tanager carrying nesting material,
so I added to their stock of loose feathers and fresh-cut grass and also
placed a small pot of ground cuttlefish in the food shelter. On
27th April both birds were seen in the flight so I had a quick look in
the nest-boxes and basket to see what was going on. A cup-shaped
nest of grasses had been built in the basket and in it was a large
pointed egg, greeny-blue with large brown spots to halfway. It was not
until 8th May that I had another opportunity of a quick look at the
nest and on this occasion there were three eggs. I checked again the
next day when the hen was off the nest and there were only two eggs and
again on nth May when I felt two young birds. They could have
hatched the day before. Additional mealworms were fed at once and
from then on for some days mealworms and gentles were fed ad lib.
Their usual " fruit " softfood was supplied together with half an apple
and half a pear each day, two items which I rarely give alone. Not
many mealworms were consumed until 13th May when the weather
was very hot and sunny. On 17th May when I was on holiday abroad,
my husband had a look at the nest and saw the two seven-day old
chicks quite clearly. From now on slightly less than \ oz. mealworms
and a little more than \ oz. gentles were consumed each day. The
portions of pear and apple were also consumed but the remaining
food was scarcely touched.
On 23rd May the nest was examined again and the two young
birds were seen to be well feathered with large white gapes. On
Monday morning, 24th May, the thirteenth day after hatching, one
young Tanager had left the nest and the second one was seen in a bush
a couple of hours later. It was raining heavily and not very warm.
In colour the birds were a dull slaty-blue all over and on the heads
sprouted a few whitish feathers. The eyes were dark and the beaks and
legs were also a deep blue similar to the parents. Mealworm consump-
tion doubled for the next couple of days when it again dropped back
to a daily \ oz. By 27th May both birds were flying well and the white
head feathers were more pronounced appearing like eyebrows. Tails
were now sprouting and the birds were getting very sleek. The next
few days continued cold and wet, but the young Tanagers were
unaffected by the conditions and as far as I could see they roosted in
the bushes. Early June was warm and sunny and I noted on the 5th
that the young birds were almost fully grown with long tails though
not as " cobby " as the parents.
On 9th June, after a mixed spell of weather, I noticed the hen Tanager

sitting in the nest basket and when she came off a quick check showed
two eggs. The cock Tanager was still feeding the young birds so I
decided to leave them a few more days before separating them. On
14th June the cock bird was again seen feeding the young birds, this
time with sultanas as I had cut down quite drastically on such extras
as mealworms, pear, and apple. About that time we had a pair of
Chestnut-bellied Rock Thrushes nesting in an adjoining aviary with
the hen Thrush also sitting on two eggs. The two nests were only about
3 feet apart. The hen thrush is a very nervous bird and her first clutch
of four eggs had been clear so I did not want to disturb her at this time
and decided to leave the young Tanagers with their parents for a few
more days.
On 21 st June one of the Rock Thrush eggs had hatched out and while
I was carrying out routine feeding (the hen was off the nest) my husband
quickly caught the two young Tanagers in the adjoining aviary and
caged them in a birdroom. There were no longer any eggs in the
Tanager's nest, but there was a broken one on the floor. The nest was
badly disturbed. It seems, therefore, that we had left the two young too
long with their parents and this has cost the second clutch. The two
young Tanagers settled down in the cage at once, eating the usual soft
food plus apple and a little live food. Four days afterwards they were
placed in an aviary containing other, but smaller, Tanagers and many
seedeaters such as Cordon Bleus and Lavender Finches where they
remain at the time of writing (4th July). They are still the same dull
colour, show no signs of lighter shoulder patches or red head tufts, and
the two white " eyebrows " remain undeveloped. I don't expect this to
change until their first moult. Their parents show no signs of producing
a third clutch.
As described above, Mrs. K. M. Scamell has bred the White-capped
Tanager, Stephanophorus diadem atus. It is believed that this may be a
first success. Any member or reader knowing of a previous breeding of
this species in Great Britain or Northern Ireland is requested to
communicate at once with the Hon. Secretary.

(&amp;apos;Chalcomitra senegalensis gutturalis )
By B. E. Reed (Wednesbury, Staffs, England)
This paper is an account of the successful breeding of the Scarlet-
chested Sunbird ( Chalcomitra senegalensis gutturalis ).
After this pair of birds just failed to rear their young last year
(see Avicultural Magazine, Vol. 70, No. 5, page 166), the hen
was again seen to be sitting on 7th June, 1964, and two infertile eggs
were removed from the nest on 26th June, 1964. These were expected
to be infertile as the cock had started to moult.
After doing very well on the Show Bench in 1964, the cock was placed
in a flight in our birdroom for the winter. The hen was placed in the
next compartment. (There was a cardboard partition between the
two.) The cardboard nest-box which was used last year was put up
and the cock was introduced to the hen on Monday, 3rd May, 1965.
The hen started building on 10th May and finished the nest on
14th May. As before she would only build when the sun was shining
and the materials used were Canary Nesting Material and bits of
grass. The lining was scraps of paper off the floor. A point which I did
not mention last year was that all material was soaked in water or
nectar before being used.
The hen was seen to be sitting on Friday, 21st May, and the young
bird was believed to have hatched on 3rd June, as we found the remains
of the egg-shell on the floor (colour of egg from remains of shell, cream,
heavily blotched and streaked with greyish-brown). The hen was seen
to be catching fruit flies and we also gave her about fifty spiders. The
consumption of spiders was really tied down to how many we could
catch per day and not to how many the young bird would consume. On
4th June the hen was fed another fifty spiders and she took great
quantities of fruit flies. After trying several methods of obtaining
spiders such as collecting with an umbrella in nettle beds, etc., none of
which were very successful, we hit on the idea of knocking down old
garden walls. (We were lucky in the respect that there are a lot of
houses in our area due for demolition.) The spiders collected were
quite large, i.e. approximately S to \ inch body size. The hen took
seventy spiders on 5th June.
On 6th June the young bird was heard cheeping, ninety spiders were
consumed. Incidently, we had a couple of funny experiences on these
spider catching expeditions. On one of them, one of us knocked half a
garden wall down and it turned out someone was living in the house !
Eighty spiders were fed to the hen on 7th June and 105 on 8th June.
On 9th June we first saw the young bird--115 spiders were con-
sumed. The hen was feeding by hanging on the front of the nest in the

typical sunbird manner. The inside of the mouth of the youngster was
yellow ; it was already feathering up. The spiders were now being
killed and fed whole and not by regurgitation as before. The porch over
the entrance to the nest dropped down on the ioth and the hen would
not feed the young bird. I got in the flight and pushed it back up.
The hen fed the young sunbird immediately. They took 135 spiders.
On Friday, nth June, the same thing happened again so the porch
was removed from the nest (135 spiders).
On 12 th June we were catching spiders and two demolition workers
came up and asked what we were doing--we told them and they
thought it very funny but they helped us for about an hour (in fact
they asked the foreman if they could put it on their time sheet)--
125 spiders were fed to the hen. On 13th June the hen appeared to be
getting a bit tired ; however, the cock suddenly decided he would
contribute to the proceedings and started feeding about 7 p.m.;
between them they fed 145 spiders. On 14th and 15th June the parents
fed steadily, taking 130 and 120 spiders respectively. The cock made
a lot of fuss about his contributions.
The sac containing the droppings was removed from the nest by the
hen approximately six or eight times per day ; on 16th June the
youngster was seen to turn round in the nest and eject the sac con-
taining the droppings directly into the hen's beak (155 spiders). The
cock did most of the feeding hovering before the nest and placing the
spiders into the youngster's open mouth. He also did most of the feeding
on the 17th, 135 spiders being taken.
On 18th, 19th, 20th June, 110, ninety and eighty spiders respectively
were fed to the youngster ; we were now having difficulty in finding
the live food as it was raining a lot. On 21st June we only collected
about fifty and the youngster seemed a bit weaker than before, although
it was preening itself. Our supply of fruit flies had by now diminished,
as when you have a pair of sunbirds nesting besides about fourteen
other sunbirds in a birdroom it does not take long for them to vanish.
As last year they refused houseflies, meat flies, etc., but being a bit
desperate I offered the cock a maggot. This he took and fed to the
youngster--over the day he took a total of forty-five maggots although
the hen would not look at them. The adults were very tame and all
live food was taken from the hand. I was a bit worried as the young
bird could be seen quite clearly and it had its head under its wing
nearly all day.
I went down the aviary at 8.20 a.m. on 22nd June and the youngster
was sitting on the perch and begging for live food. I saw it fly a couple
of times in the day although it sat still most of the time. At about
3.40 p.m. on the same day it was feeding out of the nectar tube (130
spiders). The young bird was over two-thirds full grown on leaving the
nest, beak approximately two-thirds the size of adults, tail J inch long.

Similar colour to hen but more barred under parts, also blackish chin
and neck. More olive-yellow below. On 23rd, 24th, and 25th June,
seventy, thirty-six, and ten spiders respectively were fed to the
youngster. It was now drinking a lot of nectar and starting to get very
active ; its tail was approximately f inch long.
On Saturday, 26th June, it was as big as the adults and very fit.
It was by now completely independent, refusing to take any spiders.
The hen also fed it ripe pear on 21st, 22nd, and 23rd June.
We would once more like to thank Mr. Allan Lavendar for his help
in catching the large quantity of spiders used (over 2,200). Incidently,
after helping us last year he has turned from a non-fancier to keeping--
dare I mention the word--Canaries !
We removed the nest on 25th June, 1965, as the hen was building
again and we shall soon be going on holiday. All the rest of the details
with regard to feeding, mating, display, etc., are as stated in my
article last year. On 29th June, 1965, the youngster was removed from
the flight and placed by itself in a cage, as the hen was worrying it. It
is doing very nicely and it seems bigger than its parents.
As described, B. E. Reed has bred the Scarlet-chested Sunbird
Chalcomitra senegalensis gutturalis. It is believed that this may be a first
success.

BREEDING THE BLUE-EYED COCKATOO

The Blue-eyed Cockatoo is said to be a native of New Britain and
New Ireland. Its general colouration is white, part of the crest is pale
yellow, but this is hardly noticeable unless the crest is raised. The pale
yellow colour is also present on the under-wing, the feet are lead
coloured, the beak is black, and around the eye is a naked patch of
skin which is sky-blue in colouration and from which the bird gets its
name. The sexes are similar, apart from the iris of the hen which is
much paler than that of the cock, although it does not have such a
reddish tint as that of a hen Leadbeater.
Morphologically the Blue-eyed is similar to the Moluccan
Cockatoo but the hen Moluccan Cockatoo does not have a pale iris.
I have had eggs from this latter species but no young, but have high
hopes for 1965.

IIO A. V. GRIFFITHS-BREEDING THE BLUE-EYED COCKATOO
The display of these two species differs in that the Blue-eyed does
not strike the perch with the foot whilst emitting ear-splitting screeches
like the Moluccan does, but the Blue-eyed has a mutual display
screech which is repeated alternately by cock and hen in a staccato
" barbet " fashion.
My Blue-eyed Cockatoos were imported from Dr. K. C. Searle in
April, 1963, and there was quite an appreciable difference in size ;
possibly they were different subspecies. The two larger birds were
obviously thought to be cocks ; however, on closer examination one
of the larger ones was seen to have a paler iris. During the summer of
1963, this pair was put into an aviary 36 feet long, by 4 feet wide and
7 feet high, in which was installed a hollow tree trunk. In October,
1963, there was an egg in the nest, but a few days later the hen was
egg-bound ; she was brought indoors and eventually passed an egg.
The rest of the winter was spent in the birdroom, then about the end
of April she was put back in the same aviary with her mate, but by
this time due to lack of accommodation the length of the aviary had
been reduced to 18 feet. Towards the end of May the hen again became
egg-bound and passed a soft-shelled egg.
On recovery the hen was returned to the aviary and although the
pair spent most of the time in the nesting-log no eggs were found until
19th July when two eggs were present.
We left for our holidays on 21st July, giving instructions that a
careful watch was to be kept during the first week of August, and on our
return on 11 th August I was informed that there was a chick in the nest
and one unhatched egg, which eventually turned out to have a chick
dead in shell.
These Cockatoos have never been very enthusiastic over Sunflower
seed, and would take no hemp, eating mainly Paddy rice and Canary
seed, and as I thought this diet pretty low in protein on which to rear
a youngster I was at a loss to know what to do, but then I remembered
that my Triton Cockatoo was very partial to maggots and, as it
happened, the Blue-eyed had the same tastes, so that these were fed
at the rate of two handfuls night and morning, plus apples cut more or
less into eighths, as unless cut small enough they would not touch
them (a case for an avian psychologist); green food of various kinds
was tried, but they were not very keen.
The chick at two weeks old could stand up quite strongly and was
sporting quills, and at six weeks old it was fully feathered, even to the
yellow on the underside of the crest. It did not leave the nest until
10th November.
Immediately it started perching I commenced to handle it and it is
completely hand-tame, and never attempts to bite. I am dearly
hoping that it is a hen as there appear to be more cocks than hens of
the species, but at present the iris is very dark.

(Domicella garrula garrula)
By W. H. Collard (Director Natal Zoological Gardens, S. Africa)
The following is an account of our successful breeding of the Chat-
tering Lory, Domicella garrula garrula. Although these Lories occupied
their present aviary for approximately seventeen months, a nesting-box
was not introduced until some six months ago (June, 1964). It was
constructed of rustic timber, measuring 15 by 15 by 24 inches high,
with a hole 4 inches from the top and containing 3 inches of rotted
wood. The birds immediately became interested in the nest and
spent quite some considerable time investigating its interior and
usually doing so together. About the first week of September, it was
noticed that the hen was almost continuously in the nest-box, but
would emerge to investigate the slightest noise. Unfortunately it was
not possible to establish the exact date of laying of her first two eggs,
as we were reluctant to cause any unnecessary disturbance, plus the
fact that it was impossible to examine the interior of the nest.
On 4th October we could contain our curiosity no longer, and with
the aid of a torch and a small mirror, we discovered that the nest
contained one downy chick and from its size and condition we feel
little doubt that it was either hatched that day or the day previous.
On the next day another examination revealed a second chick, and it
was then that we established that only two eggs were laid. The cock
bird thereupon assisted with the feeding, although at no stage did we
ever notice him share the incubation. Their food consisted of our own
nectar and softbill mixture, plus apples, sultanas, pawpaw, banana,
bread and milk, and hard-boiled egg.
For about three weeks after the hatching the hen was almost
continuously in the nest, but little sound was heard from the chicks
even at feeding time, as we had experienced with our Forsten's
Lorikeets. This caused the writer to take the liberty of putting his

hand in the box and the resultant snake-like hissing and scratching
established that all was well, and at a guess would say that the babies
were then about quarter grown. An anxious watch was kept on the
parents for the next couple of days in case they deserted their family as
a result of this possible indiscretion, but they did not seem to mind and
in fact both sat on the tree near their home, watching the inspection
with interest as though seeking approval of what they had accomplished.
As the time passed the babies began to give vocal evidence of their
existence at feeding times, but as stated nothing to the racket that
emanated from our Forsten's Lorikeets. At last the great day arrived
when the first chick emerged from the nest, the other content to sit at
the entrance and take stock of the outside world. This was on
19th December, 1964, seventy-six days after hatching. The following
day both were on the tree with their parents and fully coloured, except
for their beaks being black in colour and their general size a little
smaller than the adults. They did not, as was the case with our
Lorikeets, return to the nest at night, but slept under the shelter close
to their parents ; mother and father both creating a din from this
location until their brood joined them at the advent of dusk. Although
they are both still being fed, we have noticed them feeding themselves
at the feed table whenever this is visited by the adult birds. Tavistock
states that these birds lay three eggs, but our Purple-capped and
Black-capped Lories, and Forsten's, Ornate and Mitchell's Lorikeets,
plus the Chattering have all laid only two eggs, so we can only presume
that this is the normal clutch.
In conclusion, we would mention that the aviary measures 36 feet
long by 20 feet wide by 11 feet high with a miniature stream and
is planted with guava and mulberry trees. It is also occupied by a
further Chattering Lory, seven Purple-crested Touracos, a pair of
Nicobar Pigeons, one Blue Jay, and a pair of Delalande's Green Fruit
Pigeons, all of which agree except if they perch on the tree near the
breeding Lories' nest box.
Needless to say, we are very proud of this achievement and would
like to know whether there are any previous records of the breeding
of Chattering Lories.

(Forpus cyanopygius lutescens )
By K. Harrap (Bulawayo, Rhodesia)
About July 1964, I acquired through exchange a pair of Turquoise-
rumped Parrotlets ( Forpus cyanopygius lutescens ), habitat West Mexico.
</construct>
<bodyText confidence="0.996180216216216" page_id="56365806"  page_num="113" year="" vol="">
They are very attractive little birds approximately 5 inches in length.
The male is bright green above, lower back and rump turquoise blue,
secondaries darker blue. Underwing coverts are blue and green, bill
ivory. Female is paler with no blue and a little yellow on forehead.
An excellent plate of this species appears in E. N. T. Vane's Lovebirds
and Parrotlets .
The birds were put in an outside aviary 21 by 6 by 6 feet with a mixed
collection of Widows and Bishop Weavers. Nest-boxes of budgie size
were supplied and a little soil plus sawdust to the depth of 1 inch put
in each box. These, however, were ignored, the birds preferring to
roost clinging to the aviary wire at one end of the flight. However, one
evening in December coming quietly to the enclosure I observed the
hen coming out of a nest-box and from then on this was used as a
dormitory.
About the second week in January the female was spending long
periods in the box and I suspect serious sitting started about then, as
the female completely disappeared and was not seen till a month later,
when I saw the cock feeding her at the nest entrance.
The birds were very nervous and I was worried that if I took down
the box to examine it, they would desert. A few days later, however,
an opportunity presented itself when I saw both birds enter the shelter
for food. Looking in the box I was surprised to see five young ones in
various stages of growth looking very like baby budgies. The largest
one was about ten days old and the pin feathers were well developed.
Seventeen days later, this chick appeared fully fledged when seen at
the nest entrance, although it did not fly until four days later. Two
weeks elapsed before the last young one left the nest. Sexing was easy
the young male showing the blue rump and wing feathers; the females,
the yellow forehead.
The feeding of these birds was the same as for the Budgerigar with the
addition of striped sunflower. This was supplied ad lib. whilst they were
feeding the young. Green food such as spinach, lettuce, and seeding
grasses, which last only a short time here owing to drought, were also
given and much appreciated by the adults.
The five young are now self-supporting, but unfortunately owing
to their habit of clinging on the wire when first out of the nest, two of
them were badly bitten on the feet by lovebirds in an adjoining

OBSERVATIONS ON THE BLACK-HEADED
PLOVER IN CAPTIVITY
(i Sarciophorus tectus)

This article has been written as a result of the observations on a pair
of these birds in a large aviary in the Bird House at the London Zoo. I
have been very fortunate in the fact that I work in the Bird House, and
am therefore able to watch these birds every day, and have consequently
achieved a much fuller knowledge of them than I would have done
otherwise.
There have only been four of these birds in the Zoological Society's
collection, the first pair being received 12th July, 1934 ; one died 1941,
the other in 1942. Of the second pair, one was purchased on 14th
February, 1956, and the second was presented two years later on 27th
April, 1958.
In structure, the Black-headed Plover is somewhat similar to the
familiar Lapwing of temperate Eurasia, the main difference being in
the crest, which is much shorter, and in the wings, which are pointed
(not markedly rounded as in the Lapwing).
The plumage, however, is quite different, viz. the upper-parts are
mouse-brown, the under-parts white with a pale mouse-brown breast
which has a black line running down the centre of it and the head is
black with white chin, throat, and bands behind eyes which meet on the
nape ; the tail is similar to that of the Lapwing, being white with a
broad black subterminal band ; the bill and legs are pinkish, the
former having a black tip, and the eyes are pale yellow.
When incubating, the bird usually rises immediately at the approach
of an intruder with a shrill rattling cry and the wings spread at the
approximate angle of 60 degrees. This alarm note is usually accom-
panied by the erecting of all the head-feathers, and is also used in other
alarming circumstances. If the bird is driven from the nest by a
trespasser, it will return immediately it departs (be it another bird, or
a human). When settling down on the nest, the bird parts its legs,
looks downward toward the eggs, and then lowers itself gently down
upon them, this being followed by a quiver as the bird settles to com-
mence incubation. I did not observe any courtship behaviour, except
that the male followed the female just before coition, but this pursuit
also happened at other times, but to a lesser extent. During coition,
the male, mounted upon the female, produced the already-stated

shrill cry and ruffling of head-feathers as their tails meet. When moving
on the ground, the head is held stiffly erect, the gait being made up of
a few quick steps or a run (the rear portion being bobbed), this being
followed by a pause, when the head is bobbed and a tit-bit may be
picked up. The birds do not often wade in the water. They are
frequently seen standing with the legs bent and head sunk into
shoulders ; the stance on one leg is also a typical posture, the other
being either slightly elevated or tucked right up under feathers of belly.
The birds are also often seen to rest on the full length of the tarsi,,
somewhat reminiscent of a Guillemot or Razorbill. When feeding,,
the entire body is tilted, the legs bent, and head lowered, the bird then
usually pauses for a moment as though it were not sure, then picks up
the morsel with a sharp stab of the bill! The same procedure is carried
out when drinking, with the exception of the pause and the stab. The

tail is often lowered slightly and quivered sideways, usually when the
bird is motionless, but also sometimes when moving.
The nest was a scrape in the ground, lined with many small stones.
The eggs (two or three) were oval (not markedly pear-shaped like
those of the Lapwing) and measured approximately 32 by 27 mm., but
this varied considerably. The ground-colour varied from some shade
of buff through to an almost creamy-white, and the markings consisted
of specks, spots, and blotches of dark brown, grey-brown, and near-
black ; these markings were usually distributed evenly over the shell,
but a few were occasionally clustered together hence forming a zone.
I examined thirteen eggs all from the same bird. The incubation
duties were carried out by both sexes.
In the wild these birds survive on a diet of insects and molluscs
(snails, etc.), but in the zoo they thrive on a mixture of boiled egg,
minced-meat, biscuit-meal, dried shrimps, dried insects, mealworms,
and maggots.
There are two races, the more southerly S. t. latifrons being similar to
S. t. tectus, but is smaller and has a broader white band on the forehead.
It is an inhabitant of tropical Africa, but stragglers may be encoun-
tered in Egypt and Syria.

THE YEAR 1964 AT THE BOEHM AVIARIES
By Charles Everitt (Trenton, N.J., U.S.A.)
Although a great number of new to aviculture, that is, first-in-
captivity breedings, did not occur at the Edward Marshall Boehm

Aviaries in 1964, it was a most successful year in all other ways, some
thirty-one different species being involved in nesting, of which eighteen
safely reared their young to maturity. It all started late in January
and went on right through to November, certainly a full year. I do not
intend to cover it in chronological sequence but in alphabetical generic
name order, irrespective of whether young were reared or not.
As an opener, the Masked Wood Swallows, Artamus per sonata (Avi-
cultural Magazine, 1964, 186, refers), raised one young in 1964. With
the thought in mind to produce a visual male White-browed Wood
Swallow, Artamus superciliosis^ a male Masked was paired to a female
White-browed, bred in i960 ( A.M ., i960, 229). From two rounds,
five young were raised, comprised of two males and three females.
They all favoured the male parent so far as masks were concerned, but
had none of the lighter colouring of the adult Masked Wood Swallow.
The plan is to pair the young male first crosses back to female White-
browed, and to proceed on these lines with, as stated above, the object of

producing a visual male White-browed, as all the original males of this
species have died. It may take three of four years to achieve the target,
but it should be worth it.
I now pass along to one of the less successful attempts for the Princess
Stephanie Birds of Paradise, Astrarchia stephaniae , although having three
rounds of one egg each time, all the eggs were clear. This year three
pairs of this species are all busy building nests but, except for one pair
in which the male is not yet in full adult colour, their efforts have been
confined to nest building only. The female with the younger male did
lay an egg but, as in 1963, this was clear. The Joyful Greenbuls,
Chlorocichla 1 . latissima, the original breeding of which was recounted
in A.M., 1964, 164 and 170, had three rounds of one egg each time,
over the period February to April, but they were all clear. However, it
did permit further data being gleaned on the species in as much as the
eggs were greyish with dark brown markings, almost completely
obscuring the thicker end, and they measured 20 by 15 mm. The nest
was a very untidy, open-cup affair, mainly constructed of twigs and
pine needles, and was very shallow in design.
One pair only of the Black-headed Sugarbirds, Chlorophanes spiza ,
went to nest, the female having been bred at the aviaries in August,
1961, and the male in June, 1962 (A.M., 1962, 49), and there were two
young, both males. As in i960, when the Rosy Pastor paired off with a
Pagoda Mynah (A.M., 1960, 234), another voluntary and, so far as we
were concerned, completely unwished for, hybridization took place in
the Starling family. In one of the aviaries there were two Royal
Starlings, Cosmopsarus regius , and the pair of Spreo Starlings, Spreo
superbus, that had bred every year since i960 ( A.M. , 1962, 208). Late
in May one of the Royals was killed, and the Spreos were reconstructing
their nest in the box they had used the previous year. Two eggs were
laid and, on 9th June, the first hatched, to be followed the next day by
the other. The nestlings were reared by both Spreos, eventually fledging
on 29th and 30th June. Up to now they had not been followed in their
development in the nest for, not only was the box most awkward to
get at, but we felt we had garnered all really pertinent information
from previous nestings. However, as soon as these fledged it could be
seen that there was something different about them. They had longer
bodies and slighter heads than all previous nestlings of the species, and
the underparts were a lighter colour. It became obvious within a short
time that they were not true Spreos, but hybrid Royal/Spreos. Now,
at nearly twelve months old, the survivor, the other dying of a chill
contracted during the winter, has the head and body shape of a Royal,
and the tail is elongated, but not to the extent of a pure Royal. The
colouring of the head follows more to the pattern of a Spreo, but the
underparts are of the same rich, golden colour of an adult Royal. It is
felt that this is rather a hybrid Royal/Spreo than vice versa, due to the

I 1 8 C. EVERITT THE YEAR 1 964 AT THE BOEHM AVIARIES
predominance of the characteristic colour and contour of the Royal
Starling. As to its sex and fertility, proving of this will be a project of
the future.
The Natal Robins, Cossypha natalensis , that had made their first
breeding in 1963 ( A.M. , 1964, 70), had two rounds but only reared
two young, the second round being destroyed by a female Ribbon-tail
Bird of Paradise. Now I come to a series of non-successes, the first being
with a pair of Magnificent Birds of Paradise, Diphyllodes magnified, that
had one round of two eggs, both clear. Next, the Orange-breasted
Cotinga, Euchlornis jucunda , that had failed to rear their young in
previous years ( A.M. , 1965, 12), had four rounds but, although the
eggs hatched on all occasions, no nestling survived for more than
eight days. A pair of Striped Kingfishers, Halcyon chelicoti , had three
rounds of three eggs each time, but all were clear. However, on the
brighter side, the Fairy Blue Birds, Irena puella , the first breeding in
captivity of which was recorded in A.M., 1964, 18, had four rounds
from which five fine birds were raised to maturity. From the previous,
and these breedings, it has now been revealed that the young males
begin to assume their adult colouring at eight months old by the
showing of dark patches on the underparts, bright blue showing in the
tail at ten months old but, even at twenty-two months the shining blue
of the back is not yet a solid colour, although the tail and underparts
are of the full adult shades.
The Natal Kingfishers, Ispidina picta natalensis , bred for the first |
time in 1963 ( A.M. , 1964, 15), only had one round from which one
young was reared. Incidentally, the male in this case deserted his
previous mate and paired up with a young female. Maybe this had
something to do with the ultimate poor results. Such remarks, however,
cannot apply to a pair of Black Crakes, Limnocorax flavirostra, that had six
rounds from which nineteen young were reared. There was one very
curious thing about this nesting, and that was that the older round
took over the care of the younger, this pattern continuing right down
the line to the fifth round looking after the sixth.
A near miss was experienced with the Crested Fire-backed Pheasants,
Lophura ignita, for, although the male was removed in time to permit
one egg to remain undamaged and this subsequently hatched, the
female appeared to be loath to uncover the chick and lead it to food,
and it was smothered at just under two days old. A pair of Fairy Blue
Wrens, Malurus cyaneus, not the pair reported upon in A.M., 1962, 84,
but one of the young females of that breeding paired to an imported
male, had one round from which two were reared. The Golden-crested
Mynahs, Mino coronatus, the first breeding of which was described in
A.M., 1964, 216, had three rounds in 1964, rearing six fine birds.
These nestings did enable some further information to be gathered for
it was learned that they are sexable in the nest, the males having quite

conspicuous yellow marks above the eyes, those of the females being
much duller.
The Bronzy Sunbirds, Nectarinia kilimensis , that failed to rear their
young in 1963, had one round but, this time, the egg was clear. The
male later got into the aviary occupied by a pair of Ribbon-tail Birds
of Paradise and that was the end of him. A pleasing breeding, and a
first so far as the Boehm Aviaries are concerned, was with the Rufus-
bellied Niltavas, Niltava sundara, described in detail in A.M. , 1965, 88.
Now follows three more successes, the first being with the Red-winged
Starlings, Onychognathus m. morio , first reported upon in A.M., 1964,
133, who had two rounds from which two young were reared. Secondly
comes the Black-headed Oriole, Oriolus l. larvatus , another first for the
aviaries and, I believe, a first in captivity. This breeding was covered
in detail in A.M. , 1965, 50. The third was with the Eastern Bearded
Reedlings, Panurus biarmicus russicus, as recorded in A.M., 1965, 66.
This also was a first for us and, as a sub-species, might well be a general
first.
In the field of aviculture one must be prepared always for setbacks and
frustrations, such events being typified in the following four misses.
A pair of Southern Black Tits, Parus niger , nested twice in a hole in a
tree but failed to rear any young. It was not possible to examine their
eggs due to depth of the hole but, by the light of a hand-torch, it was
seen that there were four eggs, clear plain blue, each time. After a
period of eighteen days in each case, broken egg-shells, discarded from
the nest, were the only fruits of their efforts. As to whether the eggs had
been clear or not, no knowledge is held. Red-eyed Bulbuls, Pycnonotus
nigricans , the breeding of which was written on in A.M., 1964, 214, had
two eggs, both clear, the female sickening just after laying the second
and dying. Although the Black-throated Cotinga, Pipreola reifferi, the
initial breeding of which was covered in A.M., 1963, 141, had two
rounds from which three young were hatched in all, they, like the
Orange-breasted Cotinga mentioned earlier, failed to rear their young
beyond the fourth day. The Palawan Peacock Pheasants, Polyplectron
emphanum , that had produced one male offspring the previous year,
did have one egg but, after sitting for four days, the egg disappeared,
an empty egg-shell being discovered later. The handiwork of mice,
we fear.
However, the Crested Green Wood Partridges, Rollulus roulroul,
did have six fine chicks, two of which got trapped between the enclosing
wire and the base-board, but the other four developed into one male
and three females. A pair of Ribbon-tail Birds of Paradise, Taenia-
paradisea mayeri, the birds responsible for the loss of the young Natal
Robins and the male Bronzy Sunbird, did go to nest three times. There
was just one egg each time and, alas, they were all clear. The nest was
constructed of dried grasses and bamboo leaves and was located high

up, about 9 feet, in a clump of bamboos. The eggs were a rich brown,
splashed and splotched with a deeper shade, mostly around the thicker
end, and measured 27 by 40 mm.
A first for the Boehm Aviaries was experienced with the Knysna
Touracos, Turacus c. corythaix , which, from two rounds, reared three
young. Their first nesting was at the top of a hawthorn tree where the
female took over a discarded Grey-winged Blackbird's nest. Five days
after the eggs hatched one of the nestlings was found at the foot of the
tree dead, with its head badly damaged, the upper mandible being
torn off. Neither parent bird was near the nest and it was feared that
the other also had gone but, later in the day, the parents were observed
hanging round a bush about 50 feet distant from the hawthorn tree.
Closer examination revealed that there was a young Touraco in another
Blackbird's nest. Somehow it had travelled through the intervening
trees and shrubs to this new location and, although it always returned
to its new home each evening until three weeks old, there was no know-
ing where it might be found during the day for it just wandered around,
always escorted by its parents. It certainly was a fine example of how
near young Touracos come to being nidifugous. For a second round
the parent birds selected a more conventional site, a wire basket in a
pine and, although they reared two more, it was never necessary to
remove the first round bird as had been the case with the White-cheeked
Touracos ( A.M. , 1965, 24). Incidently, the White-cheeked Touracos,
Turacus l. leucotis , again reproduced in 1964, having three young from
two rounds.
The pair of Grey-winged Blackbirds, Merula boulboul , whose old
nests had been made use of by the Knysnas, made several attempts to
start another family but each time their eggs were destroyed by some
Rufus Jay-Thrushes, of which there were four in that particular aviary.
Last, but by no means least, two pairs of Thailand Hoopoes, Upopa
epops longrostris , nested, producing six young in all. The first breeding
in captivity of this species was described in A.M., 1964, 163.
To summarize, and to reiterate the remarks in the opening para-
graph, a total of thirty-one species nested, eighteen of which successfully
reared a grand total of sixty-nine young to maturity. There were
seven new species for the Boehm Aviaries amongst these, making an
overall total of fifty-two species bred here during the past five seasons,
many of these being firsts in captivity.

The two Kagu chicks [Rhinochetus jubatus) hatched but not raised on
20th December, 1964, and on 10th January, 1965, were followed by
two other young ones. From an egg laid on 31st January and incubated
artificially for thirty-four days a chick hatched on 5th March, which
was well-proportioned and seemed to be strong and healthy. It was fed
by forceps with small pieces of snail and minced meat but vomited
everything it did not digest normally and died after two days. The
fifth egg was laid on 21st February and again put into the incubator.
It hatched after thirty-five days, but again the young one was very
weak, the navel was not yet closed completely and it died after twenty-
six hours. The successful rearing of Kagus in captivity seems to be as
difficult as the raising of Great Bustard chicks, and we shall do our best
to find out the still lacking presuppositions for the final breeding
success.
As the Kagu hen seemed to be strained by continually producing
eggs we offered her a plaster egg on which she was sitting persistently
until the brooding drive faded.
Among the other hatchings those of two Cereopsis Geese, one
Magellan Goose, two Black Swans, one Crowned Pigeon, three Great
Eagle-Owls, and one Horned Owl may be worth mentioning.
After years of efforts at the beginning of 1965 a wish of the Berlin
Zoo became true : two young pairs of Lesser Sandhill Cranes (Grus c.
canadensis) arrived as a gift of the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, which
had also kindly donated a pair of Trumpeter Swans to the Berlin Zoo
in 1963. The Cranes were captured in their winter quarters at the
Bitter Lake National Wildlife Refuge in New Mexico. Furthermore,
a short time later another pair of Lesser Sandhill Cranes were acquired
from the Assiniboine Park Zoo in Winnipeg, Canada.
Other new arrivals include two Indian Snakebirds, four Black-
headed Gulls, one South African Shoveler, six Hottentot Teals, ten
Mandarin Ducks, one Ferruginous Duck, one White-naped Crane,
one Great Bustard, two West African Tiger Bitterns, one White-bellied

goslings are about full feathered food consumption is much reduced.
18th July. --First brood now fifty-four days old, second brood fifty-
three, third brood forty-six. The geese were driven into a catch-pen at
the top of the orchard ; goslings, caught, wing-clipped and put in
sacks then the old geese let out. Goslings taken out of sacks and
inspected and banded and put in pen, then all let loose together.
It was very unsatisfactory as goslings went all over the place and old
geese were very uneasy while waiting, and got in bushes. When
goslings got on pond they went back to them.
21st July. --Mash feed now halved ; I only feed at 9 a.m. and
4.30 p.m.
27th July. --We caught and looked over the goslings again, cut the
clipped feathers shorter on some of them. We have to watch very
carefully that clipping is close as when the pond is frozen they skid on
the ice and cannot stop. The bank of the pond on the south side
falls away 18 inches and the netting is only about 8 feet from here,
so they do not need much lift just to slip over. This time we kept
the geese in the catch-pen after we had caught the goslings, dealt with
each gosling, put it back with the geese and let them all loose together.
They walked back to the pond more or less in line ahead--no trouble
at all.
31st August. --Our Pink-footed geese are now as follows :--Wild-
caught : 1939 goose ; 1946 gander. Home-bred : one gander 1957,
two geese 1959 ; one gander and one goose i960 ; probably one gander
and two geese 1961. Ten goslings of 1964 seem to be about equal in
number of sexes.

They continue to go to the top of the pen early in the morning.
We have been very dry here the last three years, very little water
going into the pond from the spring though we can put in some from
our reservoir.
I should say the top of the pen is about 12 feet above the pond
level. We used to catch the geese by driving them to the top then
down one side about half way to the catch-pen. They rushed in and
were inclined to break out. We now catch at the top and the geese are
very much quieter.

By C. J. O. Harrison, R. Restall, and J. Trollope
(London, England)
Introduction (C. J. 0 . Harrison )
It is a well-known fact that some birds will retrieve an egg that is
outside the nest-cavity by rolling it back into the nest, drawing it
towards them with their chin. H. Poulsen (1953) listed forty-two
species, of seventeen different families, which were known to do this,
of which the Painted Quail (Excalfactoria chinensis) was one. The great
majority were, as might be expected, ground-nesting species, and the
movement only involved a relatively short journey of the egg from
outside to inside the nest-cavity.
I recently became interested in the Painted Quail and when discuss-
ing it with other aviculturists was rather startled to hear the statement
that the hen would, on occasions, lay eggs in various parts of an aviary,
but that if these were left she might subsequently be found incubating
them together in one place. The obvious and immediate question was
why she should do this, and in addition I wanted to know how the eggs
were moved and for what distance. In searching for further informa-
tion I was fortunate enough to gain the co-operation of two fellow-
aviculturists, Mr. R. Restall and Mr. J. Trollope, who independently
undertook to try and discover what occurred. In spite of lack of time
and many other commitments both succeeded in observing and con-
firming what occurred. The following sections give their observations.
Egg-rolling Behaviour -- I (/?. Restall)
3rd April, 1965. To-day an egg was laid in the flight about 1 foot
from a favourite depression behind cover and against a wall. The cock
then rolled the egg on a long elliptical course round to the nest-hollow,
over an uneven earth floor with stones and sprouting plants. He rolled
it by standing facing the egg, say about 2 inches away, and nodded it
towards him with the underside of the bill ; then up for a walk around

and back to the egg for another roll. The walks in between the rolling
sessions seemed to be ( a ) some kind of displacement activity and
(b) getting the lie of the land and planning the route.
4th April. A second egg appeared in the nest-hollow. The hen
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.99057985" page_id="56365821"  page_num="128" year="" vol="">
showed a great deal of interest in a soap-box hutch at one end of the
flight and often sat in it. It was about 5 feet from the nest. One of the
eggs was rolled almost to this, but eventually returned to the nest.
On one occasion the hen clearly fancied a site in the centre of a large
clump of daffodils and both eggs were rolled over to it. However, the
birds decided against it and rolled the eggs back again. The total
distance for each egg on this journey was 7 to 8 feet. I believe that the
distances involved were restricted by the size of the flight. Both eggs
were subjected to continual rolling and one became dented. By 5th
April one had disappeared and the other went soon afterwards.
On 1 ith April an egg was laid in the scrape. On 12th April one was
laid in the entrance to the shelter but was in the nest with two others
by 13th. Three more were added in the next three days. The hen
failed to brood properly and by 23rd April these eggs were being rolled
about. On 5th May a new clutch of six eggs were found in a nest in the
shelter with no evidence of rolling. After two more had been laid these
were incubated by the hen.
Egg-rolling Behaviour --II {J. Trollope)
Seven eggs were laid in a nest-hollow in a corner of the flight
behind a privet bush between 12th and 18th June, 1964. The flight was
5 feet square and had an earth floor covered with a tangle of privet,
weeds, and bracken. The eighth egg was laid on 19th, 2 feet from the
nest, but by next morning the hen was sitting on all eight in the nest.
Subsequent clutches followed a similar pattern, at least one egg being
laid away from the nest and later found in the nest-hollow with the
others.
On 14th May, 1965, one egg was laid in the corner of the flight which
was normally chosen as a nest ; next day one egg was laid near the door
on the opposite side, some 4 ft. 6 in. from the nest. On the morning of
16 th this egg was also in the nest and in the afternoon a third egg was
laid 3 feet from the nest (1) (see diagram). About half an hour later this
egg had been rolled to near the door, a distance of about 5 feet (2), and
since it was in a good position for observation a watch was kept. After
an hour during which both birds passed the egg on many occasions but
ignored it, the cock crouched over the egg and pushed it with the bill
between his thighs with a deft movement, and with repeated strokes of
the bill rolled it, moving backwards, towards the nest side of the aviary
(3). At all times the movement of the egg was controlled by the thighs,
the motive power being the neck and head, and the bill providing the
" drive ". He rolled it for about 4 feet and stopped suddenly, giving the

Egg-rolling by Painted Quail (for explanation see text),
subdued clucking with which he calls the hen when he finds a titbit.
A few minutes later he rolled the egg back to its former position by the
door (4). The hen then began to roll the egg towards the nest in exactly
the same manner as the cock but only moved it about 9 inches. I then
picked it up and placed it 3 ft. 6 in. (6) away from where the hen had
left it, moving it in the direction of the nest. The cock almost immedi-
ately rolled it back to the earlier position (7) near the door in a most
practised manner and at surprising speed, guiding it through the
tangle of weeds, etc., with ease. After about 20 minutes the cock rolled
the egg back to within a few inches of the nest, a distance of about

place to another and that the ability to do so is highly developed.
The male shares in this behaviour and may perform the major part of
it. This is something more than the mere ability to roll an egg back
into a nest. It seems very likely that the aviary situation, as opposed
to natural conditions, was to some extent responsible for the amount of
rolling observed and it seems possible that this was partly correlated
with the relative openness of the environment. While the surrounding
circumstances might affect it, they would not be sufficient to account
for the presence of this egg-rolling behaviour in such a highly developed
form. Both the ability and the tendency to roll eggs in this manner
must be present in the wild bird and it is unlikely that this would be
so unless there were a need for such behaviour which was not also
present in other game-birds.
There are two possibilities. The quail might be laying in scattered
sites and subsequently bringing the eggs together for incubation, in
which case one might suspect it of being an anti-predator device to
ensure that the whole clutch was not lost at this stage. There would,
however, seem to be a tendency in most cases to lay and assemble eggs
in one place and so this seems unlikely. Alternatively the bird might
lay in a normal manner in the majority of cases, but possess the ability
to move the eggs from one place to another if the circumstances
demanded it. Useful as this might be it is absent from the majority of
avian species and in this particular case it is difficult to suggest a reason
for such behaviour when so little is known of the behaviour of the
Painted Quail in the wilds. It inhabits grassland and appears to be
rarely seen unless accidentally flushed.
Few other species have the ability to move their eggs from one place
to another. The exceptions in this respect are the Jacanas and some
Rails which may move whole nests of eggs which have been disturbed
by man, but appear to possess this ability mainly to cope with the
danger of sudden inundations in the places where they nest and to
save their clutches from floods. The Painted Quail nests in grassland
which may be on the borders of marshes and Captain C. R. S. Pitman
informs me that in parts of Africa they breed on level grasslands at a
time of year when these may be subject to shallow flooding by heavy
rains. While we cannot be certain it seems probable that the egg-
rolling behaviour shown by this species in aviaries indicates the presence
of a more highly specialized adaptation of the egg-retrieving behaviour
present in other species ; and that it is used to move eggs to a place of
safety if the site becomes unsuitable for some reason, with a strong
possibility that the need to escape a waterlogged site may be the most
important factor.

A large collection of Australian birds which arrived from Melbourne
Zoo on 29th April, 1965, brought our stock of birds to 1,007 specimens.
Pairs of the following species were received : Western Magpies,
Sulphur-crested, Bare-eyed and Roseate Cockatoos, Kookaburras,
Swainson's Lorikeets, Golden-mantled Rosella, Stanley Rosella, Rock
Peplar, Port Lincoln, Barnard's, Pennant, Red-rumped, King and
Barraband Parrakeets. It is hoped that many of the birds will breed
successfully in the near future.
Other new arrivals of special interest were Red-crested and Purple-
crested Touracos, four Gentoo, two Humbolt's, and two Rockhopper
Penguins, pairs of Hawk-headed Caiques and Crested Screamers, and
a Saddle-billed Stork.
The European Great Eagle-Owls and the Golden-mantled Rosella
Parrakeets have young and two Green Singing Finches have already
left the nest in the Tropical House. Spotted Eagle-Owls and Blue-
winged Sivas have eggs on the point of hatching.

Another characteristically generous gift of twenty-four Birds of
Paradise from Sir Edward Hallstrom includes five of the Ribbon-tailed
[Astrapia mayeri) which is a species of an especial interest to members of
the Avicultural Society, for it is named in honour of an old friend of
many of us, Mr. Shaw Mayer, who, as described in the Bulletin of the
British Ornithologists&amp;apos; Club in 1939 by Mr. C. R. Stonor, first produced
tangible evidence of the existence of this beautiful bird in the form of
some feathers including a pair of the very long central tail feathers.
J. G. Hide first recorded seeing this species in his book Papuan Wonder-
land published in 1936. Astrapia mayeri inhabits an area to the westward
of Mount Hagen and, as is well known, Sir Edward has bred it in his
aviaries.
Mr. F. Hargreaves brought the collection and it included Princess
Stephanie's [Astrapia stephaniae) , Sickled-billed [Epimachus meyeri ),
Lesser Superb [Lophorina superba minor) , Magnificent [Diphyllodes
magnificus) , Count Raggi's [Paradisaea apoda raggiana) , and a specimen
of Loria loriae that was thought to be a Bower Bird but is now included
in the Paradisaeidae. This is of a genus new to the collection and, of
course, Astrapia mayeri is a new species.

Other species not previously in the collection at Regent's Park are a
Crested Malimbe ( Malimbus malimbicus) presented by Capt. R. S.
de Q. Quincey, a pair of Little Green Barbets ( Megalaima viridis), and
four Southern Tree Pies ( Dendrocitta leucogastrd) received from our
member Mr. S. R. Sane, of Bombay, who also sent four Ruby-throated
Bulbuls (Pycnonotus melanicterus gularis) , a new subspecies, four White-
throated Ground Thrushes (J^ootkem citrina cyanotus ), and a pair of
Chestnut-bellied Rock Thrushes ( Monticola rujiventris ).
Other notable arrivals include two Falcated Teal and two Collared
Laughing Thrushes from Dr. K. C. Searle, a Purple-crowned Fruit
Pigeon ( Ptilinopus s. superbus ) that flew on to a ship in the Torres
Straits, a Baltimore Oriole and a Scarlet-breasted Sunbird ( Chal -
comitra senegalensis) that came into a house in Sussex last summer.
A pair of Azure-winged Magpies have been received in exchange from
Ueno Zoological Gardens, Tokyo, seven Grey-headed Gulls ( Larus
cirrocephalus poiocephalus) from Mr. David Roberts and two Rothschild's
Grackles from Capt. de Quincey who bred them. It is hoped that
these will breed with two received a few years ago from the Surabaya
Zoological Gardens, for this is a species that aviculturists should try to
preserve by breeding in aviaries, because it seems certain that it is in
danger of extinction on Bali to which it is confined and from which,
in spite of protection, some have been exported. Birds bred in the
Gardens include four Kenya Eagle-Owls, two Spotted Eagle-Owls, a
Barn Owl, and a Princess of Wales' Parrakeet.
A Derbyan Parrakeet presented by Mr. Ezra in 1937 has recently
died.

The oldest inhabitant in the Scottish National Zoological Park,
Edinburgh, a Golden Eagle, died last year. When it arrived in the Park
it was assumed to be a male and was given the name of " William ",
but after twenty years an egg appeared and an attempt was then made
to change the name to " Williamina ", but " William " she remained.
From then on she laid an egg approximately every second year. She
had occupied her enclosure for thirty-eight years, and as she was an
adult bird when she arrived at the Zoo it can be assumed that her life-
span was something over forty years. There is a good photograph of
this magnificent bird, with some fuller notes in the Annual Report , 7964.

Rarely do we hear further of the young ones that are contributory in
no small way to the success of members awarded the Society's Medal.
Two reports have, however, been received during the past few weeks.
W. R. Partridge writes : " The two young Magpie Starlings are, I am
glad to say, a true pair, and as I still have the spare adult hen from the
original importation, I am pairing the young cock to her, and running
the young hen around. I lost my breeding hen Rothschild's Grackle a
few weeks ago, obviously murdered by the cock." And J. H. Reay
says : " You will be interested to know that the brood of Jungle Bush
Quail have all been reared and are three cocks and two hens."

J. A. Fell, Thorpdale, Victoria, reports of the past breeding season :
" My collection of parrot-like birds did not do much good. They
failed to come into breeding condition and the majority of those that
did nest failed in their attempt to rear young. Mortality for the season
was unusually high, especially amongst the breeding stock. The
following birds were, however, reared : Peach-faced Lovebird,
fifteen ; Nyasa Lovebird, five ; Blue-winged Grass Parrakeet, three ;
Turquoisine Grass Parrakeet, ten ; Bourke Parrakeet, four ; Cockatiel,
three ; Red-rumped Parrakeet, one ; Blue-bonnet X Red-rumped
hybrid, two ; Western Rosella (Stanley), one ; Pale-headed Rosella,
two ; Adelaide Rosella, one ; Eastern Rosella, two ; and bush
Budgerigar, five. During the past few months I have increased the
number of aviaries by twelve to forty-four and I now have forty species
put up for breeding."

The rare and vanishing ones. The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service
report that the world population of wild Whooping Cranes now stands
at forty-two--the highest number since record keeping began in 1938.
Last spring thirty-two Whooping Cranes left the wintering grounds
in Texas and moved north to the breeding grounds in the vicinity of
Wood Buffalo National Park along the Alberta-North-West Territories
border in Canada, 2,500 miles away. Twenty-five were mature bird c s
giving a " possible " of twelve nestings--eleven nestings were successful !
In addition, there are eight Whooping Cranes in captivity.
The world population of the Japanese Crested Ibis is now eleven ;
four young ones were reared last year. It is good to learn that the
Japanese Government has bought the breeding area. It is to be hoped
that they will also purchase the birds' wintering area and so provide
them with the greatest possible protection.
The latest census of the Japanese Stork shows that only fourteen
birds remain. No chicks have matured since i960.
Professor Dillon Ripley has estimated that there are probably less
than 150 Monkey-eating Eagles left in the Philippines.

The sign at our gates informs the world that this is " Galley's Wood
But whence the name ? For some time I tried unsuccessfully to discover
why our property is so named. Documentary evidence there is none,
and local folk-lore authorities were quite unable to advance any logical
explanation. Now, quite by chance, I believe I must have the answer.
Three Green Woodpeckers were busy on one of our lawns when our
head gardener Edward Payne, a Kentish man with an inborn love of
Nature, said "Just look at those Galley Birds ". Surprised, I said " I
thought everyone called them " Yaffles ". To which he replied " Most
folk do but I prefer to call them Galley Birds ". This led me to refer to
Kirke Swann, A Dictionary of English and Folk-names of British Birds :
and there, sure enough, I found " Galley-bird or Gally-bird : The
Green Woodpecker ; signifies merry or laughing bird, in allusion to
its loud call, being derived from A. Sax. gal. = merry ". The " French
Galley-bird " is the Lesser Spotted Woodpecker--French implying a
stranger or foreigner : It was formerly a common practice to designate
an uncommon bird by the name of its supposed country of origin.

I believe the Royal Zoological Society of Scotland received its first
penguins in 1914. Since then it has been famous for its penguin colonies
and the many breeding successes that have occurred there. Last year the
breeding in the Gentoo Penguin colony proved to be an all-time record,
with thirteen chicks reared (fifteen hatched) from twenty-two eggs in
eleven nests. In three of the eleven nests twin chicks were successfully
reared. Of particular interest was the successful rearing of a Gentoo
chick by parents who had not yet undergone their transitional moult
on arriving in the Park from the Antarctic. Two pairs of unmoulted
Gentoos laid two eggs each. In one of the nests both eggs proved
infertile, but in the other one egg hatched and the chick was successfully
reared by its parents. In the Annual Report , 7^64, there is a photograph
of one of the Gentoo parents, in delayed moult, feeding its chick.
Other interesting photographs are of three young Corncrakes with one
of the parents, and of three fledgling Sacred Ibis chicks on their nest--
one of the last died at the age of four months, but the other two have
assumed adult plumage and are doing well. The King Penguins laid
fourteen eggs and hatched and reared three young ones.

In 1743 Edwards figured an African bird under its native name
" Touraco ", probably in imitation of its call. Albin had, however,
already figured it in 1738, calling it " The Crown-bird of Mexico " ;
doubtless he had been misinformed of its country of origin. We
nowadays know this bird as the Guinea or Gold Coast Touraco,
Tauraco persa (Linnaeus).
The purpose of this note is that one sometimes comes across variants

of the spelling--Touracou, Turacou, Tauraco, Toerako (German)--any
is perhaps preferable to the African vernacular Loerie, or even Plantain-
eater Touracos, of which there are twenty species, belong to the Family
Musophagidae. Isert first used this name in 1789 when he named a
bird of this group Musophaga violacea. Musophaga means an eater of
bananas or plantains and Isert seems to have based his name on in-
correct information concerning its feeding habits. The late Dr. James
P. Chapin, known not only for his monumental Birds of the Belgian
Congo , but also on account of his many years field-work in the Congo,
has written : " Plantain-eater would intimate that the birds commonly
eat plantains and bananas. In the wild state I have never known one
to eat these cultivated fruits, which are regularly harvested while green.
Neither have I known any to eat the wild bananas that grow here and
there in Africa.

Had Mr. J. M. Forshaw not used the Avicultural Magazine for the publication
of his learned papers, I would not have bothered airing my views.
In his reply (A.M., March-April, 1965) to my criticisms, regarding his treatment
of the Twenty-eight Parrot he used the word " authoritative " in a rather disparaging
manner. However, he seems to have missed the point, that from an avicultural point
of view (and after all that is the view that readers of this Magazine take) I could be
considered authoritative on Australian parrots.
I have always taken the view that as evolution is continuous, one must be cautious
in stating adamantly that speciation begins or has not begun at an indicated time or
period. Therefore, if a bird in the field, to an average observer appears quite different
from a close relative and is easily identifiable as such by its size and colour, we can
acknowledge a species.

In the May-June number of the Magazine Charles Everitt says that pairs " are
inclined to be aggressive ".
We have reared young Niltavas here at Keston for the last three to four years and we
find them, even whilst breeding, completely non-aggressive to seed-eaters of the same
size and in the same aviary. They are in with Himalayan Greenfinches, Siberian
Goldfinches, Albino Sparrows and Australian Common Bronze-wing Pigeons. We
have not tried them in with other insectivorous species but this, we would have
thought, would be asking for trouble.

(Chaimarrhornis leucocephalus (Vigors))
By D. M. Reid-Henry (Woodford, London, England)
The hills of northern India are gashed by deep ravines which have
been scoured out by the action of many centuries' wear. The melting
snows and glaciers of the high Himalayas, urged on by seasonal rains,
come crashing down to gouge out a way to the sea, bringing with them
anything and everything that can be moved. Boulders the size of a
house are flung about like the toys of a petulant child and the bed of
the torrent becomes cluttered and choked with the tumbled ruin. Here
these great rock masses find a resting place ; there they are pushed on
to find room lower down the valley. When they stop against all further
movement, the water has to find a way between, round, or over the
chaotic arrangement, and thus it is that waterfalls and cataracts are
made.
When the weight of water lessens as the rains decrease, smaller
flotsam packs into the spaces between the rocks and forms a base on
which some moss may grow. Later on some other sturdier plant may
find a place to throw down its roots into the rotting vegetation in the
crack, and the result of all this tortured raging by Nature is the
establishment over the ages of the past of one of the most beautiful
regions of the world.
In the higher reaches of the watercourse, where the snow and ice
have only just begun to melt, the edges of the stream are clothed with
very primitive vegetation of lichen and moss growing on the rubble
of scree which has been ripped from the mountain side by the elements.
While lower down coarse tussocky grass gives shelter to a variety of
small cringeing primulas and flowering shrubs.
The bird-life in these great altitudes is varied and interesting. But
anyone fortunate enough to have the chance to explore the region will
be struck by the abundance of the little bird which is the subject of this
essay.
The White-capped Redstart is found on all the streams of the
Himalayan region from Afghanistan right through to China. Moreover,

D. M. REID-HENRY-THE WHITE-CAPPED REDSTART
it is a bird that is not averse to ascending to any height where it can
still find any kind of insect life. It is said to breed as high as 16,000 feet
and Whistler states that the majority of nests are found between
8,000 and 13,000 feet. In the wild state the nest is situated in any
suitable cavity within sight of a stream. It is a large, rough mass of
roots, grass, moss, and other available debris lined with hair or other
softer material to hand in the particular locality, and it is lodged in
a sheltered crack in a rock or bank, or amongst the stones of a scree
rather like a Wheatear may choose.
The sexes are alike, and the territory occupied by a pair is defended
by both with equal vigour against any intrusion by others of the
species, and also in some cases against other birds such as wagtails.
But this behaviour could possibly be in an effort to bully other birds
away from a feeding area.
Normally this Redstart does not favour those reaches of a river that
are heavily overhung with forest trees. It prefers more open streams
well strewn with rocks, and mostly where the current is fast-running.
The methods of hunting vary from the straight fly-catcher type of foray
into the air, to picking up drowning insects caught by the spray and
flung into the torrent. It is adept at choosing the right moment to
dive down and snatch the morsel without getting swamped itself. As
soon as any particular quarry is caught, the bird returns to its perch
and carries out the typical erecting and depressing of the tail with
bowing and bobbing of the head. This very characteristic movement
shows off the sparkling white crown and the steel-blue-black in striking
contrast, whilst the whole is beautifully set off by the very rich maroon
chestnut which makes up the rest of the colour scheme. Altogether it is
a very lovely bird indeed, but never so attractive as in its wildly
romantic natural haunts. There one's attention is instantly drawn to its
presence not only by the flashing contrasts of its plumage, but also by
its ringing, persistent high-pitched call which is one of the features of
the mountain streams.
My first encounter with the bird in the wild was during one of my
many trips north from Patna on the Ganges to get away from the press
of military duty for a while. I found an area which was reasonably
accessible to me for the short time I could be away, and there I would
retreat on every available weekend.
On the first occasion I landed at the small government rest-house,
left my things to be put out by the bearer, and set off up the hill
a-birding. This was a new experience for me as I had never before
been into the foothills of the great Himalayas. My knowledge of
Indian birds in the wild was mainly confined to those species one may
meet in the Plains : now I was making the aquaintance of a whole new
list of the rich Indian wildlife.
There is a great exhilaration for someone at home in remote places

whenever he treads new ground, and I had listed forty-three new
species in the first two hours. Then I came to just such a stream
as I have tried to describe above when I had climbed about
1,000 feet from the rest-house down in the valley. The air was cool
and full of the noises that the jungle has to offer. The sun shone and
the stream, although running well was nothing like in spate. A haze
of whizzing insects sung above the inevitable giggling of the water and
all things were so very right.
Then, there he was !
To cut a long story short--for indeed I could dwell upon that day's
excursion at length--I got my glasses fixed upon that Redstart and
kept him in view for an hour. Upon my return to the rest-house I
spent most of the evening making drawings from memory and making-
up my list of species seen during the day. The total came to 102 of
which no fewer than sixty-one were for me new birds.
The accompanying coloured plate is painted from one of the
drawings I made on the occasion.

We have kept a pair of these beautiful little Redstarts for over three
years in a large planted aviary, containing a sizeable pond for four pairs
of ducks, and which also includes Golden Pheasants, a pair of Giant
Whydahs, Yellow-bellied Grosbeaks, Virginian Cardinals, Crested
Bronze-wing Pigeons, and Bob-White Quail. The aviary is approxi-
mately 40 feet long and 20 feet wide. The sexes are alike in colouring,
mainly black with a deep-chestnut belly and rump and a snow-white
capped head. They do best in outdoor aviaries and are constant
bathers, and if confined indoors their plumage dries and they have
difficulty in moulting. They are extremely hardy, and this also applies
to the Fairy Bluebirds, whose feathering becomes dry and brittle if not
subjected to humid air.
The White-capped Redstarts are strictly territorial in the winter
months and pairs split up, so it is only possible to keep a healthy pair
together in a fair-sized aviary with a good deal of cover. They nest in
rock crevices in the wild state, near mountain streams, so we hang
substitute lovebird-size nest boxes, with small ledges, around the
aviary near the roof, so that the other birds cannot interfere with them.
The cock bird is quite aggressive and, except for the larger ducks and

fowl, also the cock Great Whydah, rules the inmates. However, they all
have different habits and there is plenty of cover and room.
At night the redstarts seem to roost in one of the small barrels put up
for the free-winged Mandarin and Carolina Ducks to nest in. It is
quite likely that in previous years they have attempted nesting in these,
without my knowledge, for they are extremely furtive nesters and
if this year and last they hadn't chosen a small lovebird-type nest-box,
hung near the shelter, I would not have known about it. I mentioned
in our Annual Keston Notes that they hatched four young last year in
this box, but that they disappeared on hatching. It was difficult to
pinpoint the culprit, but I caught up the cock Azure-wing Magpie
(the hen had since died) as being the most probable suspect ; although
he was harmless to the Crested Pigeons reared every year, and made no
attempt to touch the duck eggs. The cock Redstart spent most of his day
near the box, whilst the hen was sitting, and drove away any bird that
came near. The hen commenced sitting towards the end of April, but
would slip off the nest whenever the cock bird gave the warning, and
she was so adept at this that, although the box is completely exposed,
I only once thought I saw her leaving the box. However, while the
cock remained on " sentry duty " I knew things were alright.
The next phase in this jig-saw puzzle was after feeding live food in
the aviary one day; I was about to retreat when I saw the hen chase the
cock away from the nest-box. The young should have hatched by this
time and this was my cue. It is no easy matter, in an aviary of this size,
to catch up a small bird like a Redstart, but this was clearly the only
thing to do. It took two of us, with strategy, a few minutes to catch up
the cock bird.
From then onwards the hen could be seen frequently with beakfuls
of live food until, on nth May, one young bird left the nest. I
imagine this was the sole survivor of the cock's interference.
The hen proved to be a model mother and reared it until it is now
completely independent. My explanation for this near tragedy is that
being strictly territorial in the wild state, the cock would spend more
time challenging rivals and have less time on his hands for domestic
matters. The same probably applies to the Blue-shouldered Mountain
Tanager, where sexes are alike in colouring and which are strong,
aggressive birds ; and we find it necessary to remove the cock when the
youngsters are due to fledge. He attacks and kills them as soon as they
leave the nest.
The young White-capped Redstart looks like a much duller edition
of the adults. The black is a sooty black, and it lacks the chestnut belly
and just sports a dull orangey colour on the rump. The white cap is
nowhere near as snow-white as on the adults. It appears to be a young
hen for it, and its mother, are now living amicably together, although
it is fully independent.

[Irena puella cyenea) AT KESTON
By W. D. Cummings (Keston, Kent, England)
Last year I gave a few details in our Annual Breeding Notes of the
attempt, and ultimate failure, to rear the young of a pair of Fairy
Bluebirds. They made three attempts and hatched one, two, and one
youngsters respectively, and reared them up to approximately ten days
old. From their habits, when the young had hatched, of fly-catching
and hovering over bushes, and darting in and fetching something out
of them, I presumed they needed larger insect life than I could provide.
The idea, this year, was to provide a night-light in order to attract
larger moths and beetles, but unfortunately events rather overtook me
and I had not the time to put this idea into practice.
Spring is a very busy time and it was not possible to spend too much
time on the Bluebirds, but they beat me to it. We keep this pair in a
thickly-planted aviary about 20 by 17 feet, which they share with a pair
of Tambourine Doves. I find that they dislike other birds too close to
them, so we gave them the aviary virtually to themselves. Fairy
Bluebirds are not aggressive but they are obviously upset by other birds,
and give way easily if another bird shows aggression towards them. They
are excitable and active birds in an aviary and have proved themselves
ideal for outdoor aviary-life in the country, being colourful, hardy,
active and easy to keep. The only precaution we take is to shut them
in their shelter at night, during the winter months, and provide slight
heat during the coldest weather.
Their daily diet consists of chopped-up dates, apples, grapes, and a
slice of pear, together with insectivorous mixture, gentles and meal-
worms. This year we included minced meat which, apparently, was
the cause of our success in rearing two young this year. On a remark
by a fellow fancier, that he could get his Bluebirds to eat little else other
than minced meat, I decided to try this. I first saw the cock bird with
a beakful of minced meat, and feel it was he who first fed solids to the
young after the first week. Even when the young were fledged, the
hen continued to feed them on a mainly mealworm diet. This has been
the only difference in feeding between this year and last.

W. D. CUMMINGS-BREEDING THE FAIRY BLUEBIRD AT KESTON
I stopped shutting in all our birds about the beginning of April and,
generally speaking, the hardy Blue-shouldered Mountain Tanager, in
the same range of aviaries, is the first to commence breeding. They
always commence nest-building while still being shut in at night, in
early March, and although results would be doubtful, I would leave 1
the entrance hole open if it didn't affect the shelter temperature for all ;
the other inmates in the same range. This year, to our amazement, the
Fairy Bluebirds commenced nesting the following week, when the
nights were still cold, and even the indigenous Blackbirds had hardly
commenced nesting activities. However, the hen built in a thick
Macrocarpa bush--as last year--an open nest of rough twigs, lined
with fine grasses. She laid one egg which hatched during the last week
of April, and the young left the nest about 10th May. Similar to the
Tanagers the Fairy Bluebirds seem to lay one, or at most, two eggs at a
sitting--a large, heavily-blotched egg. The young appear to grow
quickly but are dependent on their parents for at least a month after
leaving the nest ; and both cock and hen assist in the feeding. The
young left the nest looking like a small edition of the hen, and of similar
colouring. The hen went to nest before the first youngster was fully
independent but, due to heavy showers and thunderstorms, this nest
proved abortive. She has since reared another youngster, which has
been fledged about a month, and is just about independent.
As described, W. D. Cummings has bred the Fairy Bluebird Irena
puella cyanea. It is believed that this may be a first success.
Any member or reader knowing of a previous breeding of this
species in Great Britain or Northern Ireland is requested to com-
municate at once with the Hon. Secretary.

(.Loriculus galgulus)
By Francine G. Buckley (Section of Neurobiology and Behavior,
Cornell University, Ithaca, New York, U.S.A.)
Candidiasis is a fungus disease caused by Candida albicans which is
closely related to the Aspergillus group of fungi. The disease normally
attacks the alimentary system of vertebrates although in the case of
Loriculus it attacked the respiratory system, ultimately causing their
death.
After having tried unsuccessfully for two years to obtain Hanging
Parrots of the genus Loriculus for ethological studies, I finally located a
source of L. galgulus in Malaysia. My first shipment of twenty-four
birds arrived in May, 1964. The majority were immature, with two
adult females.
Our usual practice with newly arrived parrots is to keep them
isolated while giving them prophylactic treatment with Aureomycin
as a safeguard against psittacosis. I followed the procedure of three
days of antibiotic mixed in their food and four days of no treatment
with a total of thirty days of Aureomycin therapy being the ulti-
mate aim. Much to my dismay all but two birds died suddenly and
mysteriously within one month. The birds had appeared to be doing
well on a diet of sweet fruit salad, grapes and a honey and bread
mixture. Their plumage was fairly well preened and the birds seemed
to be alert. Upon autopsy and tissue culturing, no sign of disease was
found.
The following fall I obtained twelve more birds from the same
source--nine immatures and three adult females. Once again they
started to die. This time I was giving them Terramycin, every third
and fourth day for two weeks. Autopsy of our first loss proved to be
more rewarding than the previous autopsies. The bird, a young
female, had a black cottony growth covering the lungs, which was
cultured and identified as the fungus Candida albicans.
A few days later, careful observation of the remaining birds (now
nine in number) evidenced symptoms of a respiratory disease. It was
impossible for me to discern any signs of disease until the birds were
too far gone, when symptoms of laboured respiration, regurgitation
and coughing (in one case), emaciation in the pectoral region and
general loss of alertness became obvious. At that time I was unaware
of any successful treatment for this disease. I had separated the ill
birds from the others and kept the cages clean, as well as ceasing anti-
biotic treatment upon discovery of the cause of their death. This
was not sufficient and all were dead within two months.

Upon further investigation I learned that E. R. Squibb and Sons
market Amphotericin B, an antimycotic, in combination with tetra-
cycline antibiotic, under the name of Mysteclin F. Unfortunately I
could not obtain this in time to prevent the last of my birds from dying.
We now believe that the birds contracted the Candida infection
while in route from Kuala Lumpur to New York. They arrived
cramped in a small box filled with rotting fruit after a four day journey.
Candida albicans is a normal inhabitant of the gut of most vertebrates,
becoming pathological only under conditions of other diseases or stress.
It thrives on rotting fruit and is transmitted through droppings and
litter. It enters the body through the mouth, as evidenced by lesions on
the tongue and in the gastro-intestinal tract. Since the birds were
already weakened by a long journey and having to adjust to a different
climate they were highly susceptible to disease. Their diet of sweet
juicy fruits further complicated the matter. It is believed that Candida
albicans became fatal to the birds because of further weakening of their
natural defences against candidiasis by the prophylactic antibiotic
treatment which completely wiped out any native bacterial flora
which would have combatted the fungus.
We have lost other parrots (notably Agapornis sp.) under similar
circumstances and now feel that prophylactic treatment for psittacosis
with tetracyclines might do more harm than good in certain cases. In
almost ten years of working with parrots we have never had a case of
psittacosis but we have lost many birds from unknown causes. In light
of learning that 44 an ounce of prevention may not be worth a pound of
cure " we now recommend that any new groups of birds be kept
isolated and allowed to adjust to their new environment and recover
their strength. After a period of adjustment they should then be given
proper treatment to prevent their infecting other birds with diseases
they may be harbouring or may act as carriers for, not necessarily
being affected themselves.
I have since received more Loriculus galgulus from the same source
and have treated them prophylactically with Mysteclin F in its pedia-
tric form of fruit flavoured drops, for a period of two weeks. The birds
are doing well and I have now had them for four months as at
2 ist August. It should be noted that if given orally mixed in food or
water, Mysteclin F will only attack diseases centered in the gastro-
intestinal tract since it is not absorbed by the gut. Squibb is now
working on a water soluble form that will be absorbed by the gut,
which would be more helpful in combatting respiratory diseases.
When absorbed by the gut or given intravenously, Mysteclin F is

Three Kiskadees (Pitangus sulphuratus) were presented to the Zoo on
23rd July, 1964, and after a brief stay in an aviary, were set at liberty
in the Tropical House. They settled down immediately and were often
seen perched over a pool, on the look-out for small fish. Very soon they
showed every sign of going to nest but, unfortunately, destroyed other
birds' nests to obtain their own nesting materials, and it was decided to
transfer the Kiskadees to an aviary within the confines of the Tropical
House.
During the third week of April, 1965, they came into breeding
condition, fighting ensued, and one bird, evidently the surplus cock,
was killed.
A dome-shaped nest of dry grass was built in a half-open-fronted
nest-box at a height of 8 to 9 feet. The hen went to nest on 25th April
and it was assumed that laying took place on or around that date. The
birds were disturbed as little as possible and the height made it
impossible to see into the nesting box. It was thought that hatching
took place about 14th May, but no eggshells were found. Feeding,
mainly by the hen, was almost exclusively of maggots and mealworms.
On 12th June one young Kiskadee left the nest. It resembled the
parents but had paler yellow plumage on the breast. When the nest
was examined no unhatched eggs or eggshells were found. The
youngster has now been transferred to the new Temperate Bird House
and has settled down well with a collection of Starlings.
The diet of the adult Kiskadees in the Zoo consists of minced meat,
maggots, a little chopped fruit, biscuit meal, farex, and yeast. Small
fish, caught in the Zoo's canal system, are also fed.
As described, the Kiskadee Flycatcher (.Pitangus sulphuratus) has been
bred at the Chester Zoo. It is believed that this may be a first success.
Any member or reader knowing of a previous breeding of this species
in Great Britain or Northern Ireland is requested to communicate at
once with the Hon. Secretary.

BREEDING THE MAGNIFICENT BIRD OF
PARADISE

One of the smaller species of Birds of Paradise, and of the sub-family
Cicinnurinae, the Magnificent, Diphyllodes magnified, is to be found over
a wide range in New Guinea. There are variations in the colouring of
the head and secondaries according to the districts they frequent, and
at least six races have been attributed to this species. These are the
nominate race, D. m. magnified, and the five following sub-species :
D. m. chrysoptera, D. m. septentrionalis, D. m. extra, D. m. intermedins and
the D. m. hunsteini, the species to which this breeding refers. The habitat
of this race is the eastern parts of the island.
In mature plumage the sexes are not alike, the male being colourful
and equipped with erectile feathered adornments, and the female
rather sombre in colour. The crown of the adult male is covered with
short, velvety, brown feathers, edged with slightly longer ones of
golden-brown. There is a bare patch of skin immediately behind
the eye shaped like an elongated triangle, the base being adjacent
to the eye and running towards the back of the head. Over the nape
is a frill of pale yellow, longish feathers, the edges of the frill being
rounded as if scalloped with scissors. This frill, or fan, is one of the
erectile ornaments, the other being the breast-shield, that is put into
full use when the bird is displaying. The upper back is covered with a
triangular patch of reddish-black feathers, the lower back, and upper
tail-coverts, being reddish-brown with lighter tips. The short, broad
tail is brown, the central pair of feathers being shiny green, these
alternating into two long wires, curved outward at the tips, and with
very small external webs. The primaries are brown with golden basal
edges, the secondaries being broader edged until they are almost all
orange-brown, except the tips, forming a distinct wing patch. Under
the chin is a small tuft of blackish-brown feathers, the throat itself
being of the same colour. Immediately below this is a narrow line of
metallic blue followed by a breast-plate of bright green with a marginal
edge of shining green. Down the centre of the shield is a band, three
or four feathers in width, of blue-tipped feathers. The abdomen,
almost concealed by the breast-shield, is sooty-brown, and the under
tail-coverts are black. The bill, legs and feet are slate-blue, the bill
being a slightly lighter shade than the legs. The female, except for
having the same colour bill, legs and feet, and the bare patch of skin
behind the eye, is entirely different. She is pale brown above, with
darker tips to the feathers of the head; the wings and tail are dark
brown with pale rufus marginings and the under-parts are a dirty
white, closely cross-barred with dark brown. The tail is slightly longer

than that of the male. Both birds are about nine inches in length, that
is, disregarding the elongated tail of the mature male.
In the initial collection of Birds of Paradise presented to Mr. Boehm
by Sir Edward Hallstrom in November, 1961, there was one mature
male and one young male Magnificent. In November, 1963, a
further pair and two females were received from the same source, so
one of these females was placed with the original mature male that had
been occupying an aviary since his arrival. In September, 1964, it was
noticed that this female was gathering twigs together and trying to
assemble them on a 2 inch wide timber just above the entrance door
to their aviary. An open-top box, 8 inches square with 3 inch high
sides, was secured there and, without any hesitation, she began to
construct her nest. This was an open cup made of twigs and rootlets
and was completed by the female alone, the male not being seen even
to contribute materials. He spent his time stripping leaves off many of
the trees and shrubs, ruining some completely, and giving vent to his
raucous cry.
On 18th September one egg was laid, with a second the following
day. Incubation was by the female only but, at the end of ten days it
was realised that the eggs were clear. A great disappointment but it
did at least provide the opportunity of gathering the following data
concerning the eggs. They averaged 23 by 32 mm., and were pale
brown with paint-brush-like sepia markings radiating from the thicker
end for about half the length of the egg. The thinner end was com-
pletely clear. This marked the end of their activities for that year.
However, in January, 1965, the female cleaned up her old nest and,
on 6th January, laid an egg which she began to incubate without
delay. Twelve days later it was seen that the egg was damaged, for
one third of the shell, longitudinally, had been removed and there
was part of a live chick protruding through the inner membrane. There
was nothing one could do about it so it was left there, and it had
disappeared by the following morning.
On 31st January, the hen laid again, with a second egg on 1st
February. In case the previous damage to the egg had been caused by
mice, a protective guard of aluminium was fitted round the nest and,
for a similar reason, the male was removed to the adjoining aviary.
One of the eggs hatched very early on 18th February, the second later
the same day. The newly hatched nestlings were devoid of any body
covering, had bright pink skins, and yellow gapes with a negligible
margin. The development of the nestlings was very much like that of
young Magpies, the body darkening the second day until, by the fifth
day they were bluish-slate, and there were quills showing under the skin
of the wings. Their eyes were open at six days old and, the following
day there were quills showing down the centre of the back, those in
the wings having begun to open. By the eleventh day the head, back,

and wings were feathered and, for the first time, they were seen rearing
their heads, calling for food. Despite quite lengthy watches being
maintained at various times, the female was never seen to feed the
chicks but, judging from the feed-pan, it seemed that the rearing was
done mostly on ground raw beef and live-food. The latter consisted of
mealworms, crickets, and grubs dug up in the nearby woods, the latter
occupation not being a light task for, at that time of the year, most
of the ground was covered with snow.
One young had fledged on 6th March, and the other the following
day. In colouring they resembled the adult female, and they were flying
well from their first day out of the nest. Independence was gained on
28th March, at thirty-eight days old, and they were then removed from
their mother to quarters on their own, and the male was reunited with
his mate. It was decided that, if they did go to nest again, the male
would be left there so as to ascertain if he did in anyway assist with
the rearing or care of the young. Although she did lay further eggs in
April they were both clear, but there is still plenty of time.
So far as I have been able to find out, this is the first time this
particular species of Bird of Paradise has been bred in captivity but,
of course, I am always open to correction on this point.

By Edward Hindle, F.R.S. (London, England)
Many species of birds undergo colour changes in captivity which
may be either the result of some deficiency in their diet or of mutations
which are liable to occur on rare occasions during breeding. One of
the best known examples of the former is the Flamingo in which the
bright pink colour is due to a carotenoid absorbed from their food,
sometimes contained in a blue-green alga, more often in Crustacea or
molluscs. The Green Magpie Cissa chinensis chinensis, is another inter-
esting example (described in Z** Life VI, p. 41) for in captivity the
delicate green of the head and back soon develops a bluish tinge. This
is almost certainly the result of some deficiency in the carotenoid
content of the diet and might well be corrected by the use of material
(such as Canthaxanthin described by Wackernagel, A.M.,V. 65, p. 20.)
which favours the development of yellow pigment in the feathers.
A bewildering variety of colours have developed in certain members
of the Parrot family, especially in Budgerigars and to a lesser degree in
Lovebirds and Parrakeets. These are the result of mutations and as
might be expected are more likely to occur when large numbers are
being bred. Mutations in the larger species are almost unknown and
therefore it seems worth while to put on record an example seen in a

small collection of animals, well shown in a terraced garden, included
a number of free-flying Macaws and in one of the Blue-and-Yellow
Macaws, Ara ararauna , the yellow pigment was absent, so that it was
coloured blue and white. Mr. Jean Delacour and Miss Phyllis Barclay-
Smith, also saw this bird, which was tame enough to permit a careful
examination.
I have been unable to find any record of such a mutation in this
species although it has been known in captivity since the sixteenth
century. Possibly the comparative rarity of its breeding in captivity
may explain the absence of any previous record.

It was my privilege to spend another month in Australia in 1964.
One never tires of watching the birds of that fine country, nor meeting
its friendly ornithologists, and my last visit was as pleasant and inter-
esting as the previous one. I arrived at Perth from Johannesburg
early in October and this time I was joined there by Professor J. Nouvel
the Director of the Paris Zoos. Our hospitable friend Dr. Dom Serventy
was there to welcome us and took us down to the beautiful country of
the extreme South-West.
We then went to Adelaide and from there, in the company of Dr.
Alan Lendon and of several other bird enthusiasts, we left on a
" birding " trip to the upper Murray River, close to the borders of
South Australia, New South Wales and Victoria. It was a wet, cold
spring in those parts of Australia, flood waters were everywhere, and
even the usually dry mallee looked lush and green. We saw plenty of
Yellow Rosellas, which are confined to the valley itself, where we also
observed many Rock Peplars and Redrumps. On higher and drier
ground, Barnard's, Blue Bonnet and Many-coloured Parrakeets were
abundant. We saw a flock of some forty Feadbeater's Cockatoos, a
rather scarce species. Galahs were, of course, commonly met with in
the drier and more open country. The saltpans near Adelaide, as well
as the marshes along the Murray, were less thickly populated with
ducks than is usually the case because floods everywhere gave them
much additional habitat. We saw, however, a great many, as well as
lots of Black Swans. We observed again the little flock of Blue-winged
Parrakeets that inhabits the bushes and small trees around the saltpans.
The Adelaide Zoo still has a fine collection of birds, particularly
of parrakeets which nest in numbers in its very practical aviaries. In

the hilly country east of Adelaide Mr. R. McKechnie has started a
country zoo, mostly of native animals and birds which promises to
become very interesting.
Monsieur and Madame Van den bergh of Antwerp, joined us at
Melbourne where Dr. Dorward was our kind guide. In terrible weather,
cold, windy, and wet, he took us to the southern shore, where we had
the rare luck of seeing five wild Cape Barren Geese (Cereopsis ), a species
normally confined to small islands. We also found the tunnels where
Mutton Birds (Shearwaters) and Fairy Penguins nest. In a State Park
along the shore more than sixty Pennant's Parrakeets, old and young,
were peacefully feeding on the grass by the road not at all disturbed by
cars rushing close to them. The Healesville Zoo of native animals
and birds was better than ever and many King Parrakeets, living in
their natural state of freedom, have become so tame there that you can
almost touch them. A large flock of Yellow-tailed Black Cockatoos
was encountered in a nearby forest. The Melbourne Zoo is now in the
course of reconstruction and will soon be greatly improved. There
are already some well displayed and good collections there.
Later on, in Northern New South Wales, I spent two days with Dr.
J. L. Brereton and his students at the University of New England at
Armadale in Northern New South Wales. They make a special study
of Parrakeets, and we saw many Common Rosellas and Pennants
feeding on and along the roads. At West Burleigh, south of Brisbane,
Queensland, we visited the Fauna Reserve of Mr. David Fleay, where
extraordinary breedings have taken place, particularly of owls and
hawks. It is always a joy to meet such an experienced and gifted
naturalist. And of course, the 1,500 wild Scaly-breasted and Swainson's
Lorrikeets, feeding on honey-water and bread, and perching on the
bystanders' shoulders and arms are always an extraordinary show to
be seen in the neighbourhood.
The meeting of the International Union of Directors of Zoological
Gardens in Sydney was a great success, thanks to the efforts of Sir
Edward Hallstrom. As always it was a great pleasure to see all the rare
animals and birds that he keeps at the Taronga Park Zoo, and in his
private collections.
But the best part of our trip was perhaps the few days we spent at
Canberra with Dr. H. J. Frith, Chief of the Division of Wildlife
Research. That governmental institution has accomplished a great
deal since its fairly recent establishment. It has been competently
organized and run, and its staff is excellent. Therefore the knowledge
of the Australian fauna, its life habits and its behaviour has been con-
stantly advanced. Among the birds, waterfowl are extremely
important--they constitute the best game of the continent and their
relation to cultivation can be a problem, so that their wise management
is a necessity. The many primitive and very peculiar genera and

species of Australia are of very particular interest and deserve careful
attention. Until two years ago there was no adequate installation,
either in zoos or in private collections, to keep satisfactorily, and
eventually breed, the smaller and more delicate species of ducks. In
order to make possible a detailed study of their biology, I commented on
that situation during my visit to Australia in 1962, and Dr. Frith had
said he had already planned the building of suitable ponds and pens.
This had been done by 1964, and I was delighted to see at close
quarters such rare birds as Freckled and Pink-eared Ducks, which had
never so far been kept in confinement nor observed sufficiently. The
photographs reproduced here taken at the Canberra station will give a
better idea of the aspect and shape of the various species than any long
description. All the species of Australian waterfowl, with the exception
of the Cotton Teal, were represented at the time of my visit in
October, 1964.
From a first study published by Dr. Frith (, Nature , 202, No. 4939
pp. 1352-3, June, 1964) it already appears that the Freckled Duck
(1 Stictonetta naevosa) does not belong to the River Ducks ( Anatini) . The
downy young, never described before, is of a uniform light grey,
paler below, showing no pattern, and it resembles those of the Swans in
colour although shorter and different in shape. But it is entirely
unlike those of the Whistling and other ducks and of the geese. The
adult male has a sharp S-shaped bend of the trachea, about one inch
long, outside the sternum which recalls that of the swans. In general
posture and behaviour the live bird is faintly Swan-like, certainly not
resembling any duck, even the Whistling Ducks. Much more has to
be found out before a sensible appreciation of its taxonomic position
can be ascertained, but it is probable that the genus Stictonetta stands
close to the swans in the tribe Anserini or constitutes by itself a special
tribe.
As to the equally mysterious Pink-eared Duck ( Malacorhynchus
membranaceus ) Dr. Humphrey believes, after an anatomical study, that
it is an aberrant member of the tribe Oxyurini, the Stiff-tailed Ducks.
Further work at the Canberra station will no doubt add much light
on the interesting question of the affinities of some primitive waterfowl
of Australia.

By Professor Carl Naether (Encino, California, U.S.A.)
The practice of using foster-parents to raise foreign dove and pigeon
chicks is fairly widespread in the United States. Some aviculturists--
and they are to be commended for their point of view--assert that it is
the function of aviculture to maintain foreign birds in captive sur-
roundings so congenial and homelike to them that they will in due
time breed and raise their own young to maturity. These men and
women, thoroughly dedicated, take their hobby seriously : they would
not dream of resorting to the use of any foster-parents, no matter how
urgent the need. Nor would they attempt to raise young birds by hand.
Those aviculturists who do utilize foster-parents more or less regularly
justify their practice often on the ground that not to do so would
deprive them of the pleasure and satisfaction of seeing the young of
certain, more or less rare, species mature, and thus, perhaps, save them
from extinction. There are certain species of foreign doves and pigeons,
which, to the best of my knowledge, have never raised their own chicks
in captivity in this country, regardless of whatever painstaking care
was afforded them by their keepers. A notable example is the hand-
some Plumed Dove from Australia, which will nest fairly readily in this
country's aviaries, but which will not for some good, but unknown,
reason raise its young. Hence foster-parents or raising-by-hand are
resorted to so that the species in captivity, always small in number,
will not disappear entirely, for it is one of the most charming in exist-
ence, and, as well known, not available by import from its native
Australia. Incidentally, it seems strange that after so many years of
keeping this dove in captivity in various parts of this country, not a
single keeper should have learned the reason for its not feeding its
chicks to maturity. Quite likely, the reason concerns the method of
feeding these lively doves, or the kinds of food given them.
Very recently, some interesting cases involving the use of foster-
parents for certain species of foreign doves and pigeons have come to
my attention. Thus the egg of the Bartlett Bleeding Heart Pigeon was
given to a pair of Ring-necked Doves which hatched it promptly. The
young squab seemingly thrived for five days, then died though its crop
was well filled. This unfortunate occurrence happened several times.
The foster-parents were fed on both small grains and some soft food.
In both instances, the crop was impacted: apparently small seeds did
not constitute the right sort of food for the young Bleeding Heart squabs,
which undoubtedly are fed soft food by their parents in the wild, and
also in captivity if properly cared for, for many days. Moreover,
being fed by both ringneck " parents ", the young squab may have

been " overfed ". The same pair of foster-parents, given a day-old
squab of the Key-West Quail Doves, raised the youngster to maturity
without any difficulty.
Even more revealing is the following case : the egg of a pair of
Crowned Pigeons, which for some good reason always refuse to brood,
was hatched in an incubator. The young squab was transferred to the
nest of a pair of racing homers, which were " in milk ", and which fed
the foster-child for six days when it died, also with a full crop. The
foster-parents, however, were not given any soft food, only the usual
seed diet, on the assumption that with the aid of their " milk " they
would raise the Crowned Pigeon squab readily. Their keeper, it should
be emphasized, had had no experience of keeping or raising foreign
doves or pigeons, and had in consequence no knowledge of their dietary
or other requirements. On his behalf, I wrote to Curator Lint of the San
Diego Zoological Garden, which has been quite successful in raising
young Crowned Pigeons successfully.
In response, Mr. Lint wrote in part as follows : " We have shared
the same experience in losing Crowned Pigeon squabs fed by foster-
parents with an impaction of the crop.
" In our aviaries, in the breeding season, we remove all grain and
feed, leaving only the soft food. Our basic diet consists of bread and
milk ; diced grapes ; raisins, soaked over night ; bananas, pears,
cherries, and apples. We raised Crowned Pigeons successfully for the
first time in 1942. At that time we used canned fruit : fruit cocktail
diced in very small pieces.
" Twelve Crowned Pigeon chicks have been reared successfully in
our collection, representing three species. We have never had any
success trying to hand-rear Crowned Pigeon squabs. After hatching in
the incubator, four or five have lived only six or seven days on artificial
feedings.
" Crowned Pigeon squabs usually leave the nest for the first time
when they are approximately four weeks old. The parents continue to
feed the chick still with soft food. At three months the chick is usually
weaned, and it feeds at this time with its parents. "
Needless to add, I passed this very helpful and revealing information
promptly on to the fellow fanciers involved in the above-described
case. If other members of the Avicultural Society have had similar
experiences in the use of foster-parents for foreign doves, I trust they
will come forward promptly and give us dove enthusiasts the benefit of
their knowledge and their skill.

A new walk through Bird House, erected on the site of what was a
range of parrakeet breeding aviaries, was first opened to the public
on Friday, 16th July, this year. Visitors enter the new building from the
original Bird House, constructed some years ago and now used mainly
to exhibit breeding groups of parrakeets.
This new Bird House is 130 feet long by 47 feet wide by 16 feet high,
and is constructed mainly of double layer P.V.C. sheeting, which gives
maximum light penetration and good heat insulation. Ventilators in
the roof and at either end of the building ensure a continuous flow of
fresh air. During the winter, supplementary heat for both houses will
be provided by a hot air blower, oil-fired boiler. Double doors between
the old and new houses and at the exit of the latter, prevent any
possibility of escape by the free-flying birds.
Flowing from a vertical waterfall at the near end and running the
full length of the house, is a meandering stream, traversed by bridged
walks. Spacious floor to ceiling aviaries (11 in all) with angled doors,
are provided down each side of the house. The whole area has been
attractively planted and extensive use has been made of natural
sandstone.
The free-flying birds also have access to the long flight of the original
house. Species at liberty include Victoria Crowned Pigeons, Purple
and Red-crested Touracos, Violet-backed Starlings, Rosy Pastor, a
pair of Grey-headed Kingfishers, Variegated Bittern, Snowy Egret,
Double-striped Thicknee, Fairy Bluebirds and a Lapwing. All these
have settled down well, despite the large number of visitors passing
through the house each day. Unfortunately a Grey-necked Wood Rail
could not enjoy liberty for long. He is particularly tame and when
visitors were seen stroking him, for his own safety the Wood Rail was
returned to the large Macaw flight of the Parrot House.
Species in aviaries include Swainson's and Cuvier's Toucans,

I bought a pair of Yellow and Blue Macaws five years ago ; they
arrived with clipped wings and even when new feathers grew they
never learned to fly in their aviary which was 40 feet long. They were
quite content to climb about on the wire netting, which proved to be
too weak to stand up to their powerful beaks, and on many occasions the
birds chewed their way out. But since they did not fly they were quite
content to stay on top of the aviary, and after returning them to their
rightful quarters many times I decided to let them stay outside. It was
not long before one made an attempt to get into a near-by tree, there
was a wild flapping of wings and the bird landed far short of the tree,
but soon walked the last bit and climbed to the top of the tree, where it
spent the rest of the day happily chewing the branches. By evening
time the bird wanted to go back to the aviary to feed, and since the
tree was much higher than the aviary the bird was able to land on top
of the aviary without much trouble.
The next month or two were spent in much the same way, the
second bird also learning to fly, at first to near trees, then to some
further away, until to-day, three years later, both birds are very strong
fliers and a neighbour has seen them fly over his house which is 2 miles
away. They never land however, anywhere except in the trees in
my garden but just fly round very high for the pleasure of flying. The
sight of these two birds coming in to land on the aviary after one of
these high flights is really beautiful ; even to see macaws in a really big
aviary one cannot appreciate what great masters of flight these
birds are.
Last year the birds were seen mating and I was hoping they would
breed, but their attempts were thwarted by a swarm of bees entering
their nest-box ; fortunately the birds were not stung, but it put them off
breeding for that year. I am now hoping for better results this season.
I have also a pair of Hyacinthine Macaws which have been out of
their aviary a few times, but these birds do not seem to stay in the
garden like the Yellow and Blue and I have often had trouble returning
them. I do, however, think this is because they can fly quite well and
when they are out they fly too far and lose their bearings. If they had
started off in the same way as the Yellow and Blue I am sure they
would stay at liberty just as well as the others.
The only Macaw I have which has laid eggs so far is a Scarlet,
whose " mate 55 turned out to be also a hen. I must try to get a true
cock for her and see if she will repeat her feat.

Our Birds of Paradise--the most exciting collection of birds ever to
be exhibited at Chester Zoo--arrived on 15th May, 1965. They are
housed, a pair to each aviary, on both the upper and lower levels of the
Tropical House. We have specimens of nine of the thirty-eight species
found in New Guinea, plus one Loria's Bird (Loria loriae) , which was
once classified as a Bird of Paradise. The majority are young birds
still in juvenile plumage but already the colourful feathering of the
adult bird is becoming apparent in the males of some species.
The following are the species exhibited at Chester :--

A third chick has been bred by the pair of Barn Owls that reared one
in 1963 and another in 1964. While this present young one was still
in the nest more eggs were laid and are now being incubated. In the
wild state this owl sometimes, of course, breeds twice in the one year.
Two Great Eagle-Owls have been bred and the Spotted ( africanus )
are nesting again. Among other birds bred in the Gardens are Barnacle
Geese, Sonnerat's Jungle Fowl, Swinhoe's Pheasants, and Red-legged
Partridges.

The compiler of notes such as these is faced with an insurmountable
obstacle--a date line. The fact that the Magazine is a bi-monthly
necessitates copy being in the hands of the printers at least a month
before publication. This, of course, prevents the notes being of much
actual news-value and only allows their being of limited topicality.
That is the reason why so many of the items are of a biographical or
semi-historical nature.

In October, 1948, Charles Cordier and his wife went to the then
Belgian Congo mainly in search of the Congo Peacock Afropavo
congensis. He gave a graphic account in the Magazine, 1951, 206-221.
On that occasion seven birds, six males, and one female, were
collected and delivered safely to the New York Zoological Park, on
15th June, 1949. The female, which later proved to be an elderly bird,
with atrophied ovary, died after eight months. Four of the males died
within the next seven years, and now one of the two surviving males has
died, on 13th March, 1965. It thus lived in the Zoo for fifteen years,
eight months and twenty-six days. Death was caused by an impaction
of the cloaca. The sole survivor is apparently still in good health.

Derek Goodwin, at present with the Harold Hall Expedition in

Australian bird life. Oddly enough I have only once seen Budgies and
then a few only passing in flight. I have, however, seen any number of
Crested Pigeons, Galahs, Red-rumps, Many-coloured Parrakeets,
Diamond Doves, and many others of interest to aviculturists. Over very

large areas the Crested Pigeon is as common as the Wood Pigeon in
England, perhaps more so. Incidentally, the old writer in the A.M.
who described (from an escaped bird) the display flight of this species
is quite right (allowing for exaggeration or an exaggerated display by
his bird) and the Australian scientist who told me he had studied this
species in the wild and it had no display flight is quite wrong. Other
pigeons I have seen are the Common Bronze-wing (very shy and
secretive and comes to drink only at dusk), the Zebra Dove, and one
Flock Pigeon, a fine male, all alone."

Many members will remember the excitement, and this is no
exaggeration, when the first Picathartes to be exhibited alive was put
on view in the Tropical Bird House, Zoological Society of London.
This bird, then known as the Grey-necked Picathartes, Picathartes oreas,
but now as the Cameroon Bare-headed Rock-Fowl, was collected and
brought to England by Cecil Webb in 1948. He described its capture
in the Magazine, September-October, 1949, and the account was
illustrated by a coloured plate. The original painting by Roland Green
was later presented to " Webbie " at a B.A.C. Meeting, in appreciation

The Ninth Annual Lunch, at the invitation of the Chairman and
Council of the North of England Zoological Society, through the
Director-Secretary Mr. G. S. Mottershead, was held at the Zoological
Gardens, Chester, on 30th June, 1965. Over one hundred members
and guests were present.
Miss Geraldine Russell Allen, Chairman of the North of England
Zoological Society, presided at the lunch and welcomed the visitors,
and Mr. Oscar Dunmore, the senior member of our Society present
thanked the Chairman and Council on behalf of our members. The
weather was wonderful and the roses probably better than they have
ever been--just in full bloom. The Tropical House was, of course, the
centre of attraction. It has grown up a lot and is maturing fast. The
impressive new Temperate Bird House is well on the way to completion.
The fine collection of Birds of Paradise, of ten species, looked in
excellent condition, and very fortunately there have been no losses.
Mr. and Mrs. G. S. Mottershead, Mr. and Mrs. G. F. Williams,
Miss A. L. Howard, and indeed the entire staff were untiring in their
efforts to make the visitors welcome and the warmest thanks of all are
accorded to them for a very enjoyable and memorable visit.

Long years ago I conceived a desire to possess a pair of Ravens. I did
not anticipate any great difficulty in procuring them and made a quite
elaborate enclosure in readiness. But, in spite of making my want
widely known, I failed in my quest. The reserved accommodation was
eventually used for other purposes and then, as so often happens,
I was quite unexpectedly sent a pair. Now what to do with them ?
I offered them to the Tower of London but they were politely refused,
having their full complement of six. I did, after very considerable
difficulty, eventually find a suitable home for them. Apparently
Ravens are not the most popular of birds where aviculturists are
concerned. I think that maybe they are best admired in a zoo.
Four young ones have recently been hatched in the Paignton Zoo.

" Unfortunately one of the young ones was injured last week and has
died, but we are very glad to say that the other three are thriving and

all seem to be perfect specimens. They are now three months old and
have been separated from their parents. They are feeding well and
seem set for a good long life."
Ravens have been freely bred in confinement both by Lord Lilford
and W. H. St. Quintin. The latter was first successful in 1904, and in
1908 a nest of " five very fine young birds " was reared.
Possibly the first young were reared in the early 1870s as in Notes on
Cage Birds , First Series, page 163 (edited by Dr. W. T. Greene) there is
a letter from a correspondent Ellis S. Harris : "I have a fine young
pair which were hatched in March, 1881, from a pair of old birds in
possession of a gipsy, who had bred them from domesticated birds for
the last ten years. They reared six young this season. He tells me that
the hen makes her nest in an old box, and that the cock bird takes his
turn on the nest. He lets the birds out in his yard at breeding time."

DOMESTIC BIRDS. By Derek Goodwin. Museum Press Ltd.,
London, 1965. Price 15^. net.
The domestication of animals in general, and of birds in particular,
is a fascinating subject. Very few indeed have been really domesticated,
that is to say have been accustomed to live with man, and to be
managed and selected by him to the point of being altered in shape and
size in order to become more useful to his welfare.
It is obvious that a small number of species only have shown any
inclination to domestication as defined here. Mr. Goodwin has
excellently dealt with them. After a chapter of general topics, he
reviews the waterfowl, derived from four species : the Graylag Goose,
the Swan Goose, the Mallard and the Muscovy. The game birds
follow : Chicken, Peafowl, Guineafowl, Japanese Quail and Turkey.
Then the pigeons : Barbary Dove, Domestic Pigeon and Diamond

Dove ; the Budgerigar ; and some passerine birds : Canary,
Bengalese, Zebra Finch and Java Sparrow. Finally the Cormorant,
used for fishing in China and Japan.
Semi-domesticated birds are also mentioned : the Common
Pheasant, the Golden and the Amherst, the Silver, the Californian
Quail, the Canada Goose, the Carolina Duck, the Mute Swan, the
Ostrich, the Cockatiel, Red-rumped and Bourke's Parrakeets, and the
Gouldian Finch. Actually this last list is necessarily arbitrary. A
number of species, commonly reared in captivity for many generations,
could be added. The Peafowl, in my opinion belongs there, as breeding
by man has never altered its size or shape. The same can be said of the
Diamond Dove, the Zebra Finch, the Java Sparrow and the
Cormorant. But it is always difficult to draw a line.
The information given is accurate and adequate, and the style is
exactly as it should be. All told Mr. Goodwin's book is excellently
written and highly informative.

WATER BIRDS WITH WEBBED FEET. By P. Geroudet.
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.9341154" page_id="56365870"  page_num="161" year="" vol="">
Translated from the French by Phyllis Barclay-Smith. Blandford
Press, London, 1965. Price 4.2s. net.
This book was originally written for Swiss and French readers. It
includes as webbed-footed birds not only ducks, gulls, petrels,
cormorants, and auks, but also grebes and divers. In general the work
is rather like the late T. A. Coward's Birds of the British Isles , but more
consistent and complete in the information given for each species.
There is a general introduction to each family, and for each species a
brief description and measurements are given, together with a synopsis
of distribution, with special reference to Belgium, France, and
Switzerland, and a summary of breeding biology. For all but the rarest
birds there is in addition a section, variable in length, dealing with
identification, behaviour, feeding habits, and other points of interest.
It is in this section that the personality and enthusiasm of the author
reveal themselves, aided by the excellent translation. A series of
pleasant, somewhat stylized paintings show thirty of the species, and
some others and their nests are shown in black-and-white photographs.
A most pleasant feature is the numerous small sketches, often showing
some aspect of behaviour or courtship display, which enliven the text.
It is a little difficult to determine where such a book fits into the wealth
of bird books now available, but I think it will prove a valuable
supplement to a field guide for the many who now take their holidays
abroad and need something a little less parochial than the average
English work.

Some field observations from Australia
The Cattle Egret has arrived in Australia. It first appeared in the far north, but
has rapidly spread south and has lately been reported from Tasmania. It is behaving
here exactly as it does in other countries as to its association with cattle. There is some
speculation as to how it got here, but I have no doubt that it arrived under its own
steam.
Recently I was out driving for the day and when we went into the bush to cook the
steak I noticed a pair of Yellow Robins extremely interested in our fire. At first
I thought they were looking for disturbed insects as I have often seen birds catching
them in front of an advancing bush fire. But this was not so. They perched right
alongside the fire--I hunted them away several times as I thought they would get
burned--but they returned each time. Then the cock bird hopped into the ashes and
went through the motions of bathing. He then hopped into a low branch holding an
ember in his beak and " anted " with it. The hen did nothing but seemed an interested
spectator.
A man I know has an orange orchard near here. He had the misfortune to have a
visit from a flock of White Cockatoos--they quite wrecked his crop. They did not eat
the oranges but tore them open and ate the seeds ! They certainly made a mess of
them.

The Blue Mutation of the Splendid Parrakeet
As far as I know, the only reference to a mutation of the Splendid or Scarlet-chested
Grass Parrakeet (Neophema splendida) which has appeared in the Avicultural
Magazine was made in one of the delightful articles by Jean Delacour on his travels
in Australia. He mentioned seeing in an Adelaide Aviary specimens in which the
blue areas were more extensive than usual. Only occasional references to a blue
mutation have been made in the magazine of the Avicultural Society of Australia.
However it is apparent that fair numbers of blue and split blue specimens have been
reared in Victoria in the aviaries of Mr. Doug. Ikin. Recently a few arrived in this
country and Mr. Ikin has generously donated a pair to the London Zoo. Both the cocks
and the hens retain the typical blue areas of the normal Splendid Parrakeet but the
green is replaced by slatey blue and the yellow by pale cream. In the cocks the scarlet
chest patch is replaced by an area which is best described as apricot in colour.
The specimens of a blue variety which I have seen so far appear to possess all the
charm of the normal Splendid, which I have always believed to be the most desirable
of aviary birds, and are very attractive in their own right. It is to be hoped that it
will be possible to establish them in European aviaries.

Cyanoramphus novaezelandiae hochstetteri (Reischek)
By A. A. Prestwich (Edenbridge, Kent, England)
The Antipodes Island Red-fronted Parrakeet was discovered in 1888
by Andreas Reischek. In naming it he said : " I have taken the liberty
of naming it Platycercus hochstetteri , after Arthur von Hochstetter, the
son of a sincere friend from whom I received many kindnesses, and who
has too soon passed away " (Trans. New Zealand Inst., 21 , 1889, p. 387).
Reischek's " sincere friend " was Dr. Ferdinand von Hochstetter
(1829-84), a noted geologist, for many years Professor of Mineralogy
and Geology at the Polytechnical Institute, Vienna, who did much
valuable work in New Zealand.
The Antipodes Island Green Parrakeet C. unicolor (Lear) had been
known for some sixty years before Reischek made his discovery. In 1831,
a living example arrived at the Zoological Gardens, London, and this
bird was named by Lear Platycercus unicolor and depicted in his Illustra-
tions of the family Psittacidae, pt. 4, 1831 (= pi. 25 of the bound volume).
The Antipodes Islands are a small, uninhabited, rocky group in the
South Pacific, about 480 miles south-east of the southernmost point of
South Island, New Zealand. The name is due to the fact that the
islands are, as near as possible, the antipodes of London. It is inter-
esting that such an island group is able to maintain two so closely
related parrakeets.
W. R. B. Oliver visited Antipodes Island in April, 1927, and in his
New Z ea l an d Birds , p. 560, says :
" Red-fronted Parrakeets were seen in the penguin colonies on the
shore hunting among the rocks for food, as were also the Antipodes
Island Green Parrakeet (C. unicolor ) and the Southern Islands Pipit,,
Parrakeets were seen all over the island, in scrub and tussock, keeping
near the ground. They flew only short distances. They were quite
unafraid and allowed a close approach. The food of the Antipodes
Island Red-fronted Parrakeet consists as far as is known mainly of

plant substances : coprosma berries, leaves of grass, stitchwort, and
coprosma (Guthrie-Smith), and heads of lycopodium (Waite).
These birds clean up the broken egg-shells of penguins after skuas
have devoured the contents
But what is really surprising is that on Macquarie Island, an island
800 miles south-east of Tasmania, and about 1,000 miles west of
Antipodes Island, there was once a parrakeet, the Macquarie Island
Red-fronted Parrakeet C. n. erythrotis (Wagler), probably identical to
the Antipodes Island Red-fronted. Unfortunately, very few skins are
available for comparison--the British Museum (Natural History) has
only two specimens of erythrotis --but authorities, while not unanimous,
do seem in the main of the opinion that there are insufficient distin-
guishing characters to warrant the recognition of two subspecies,
although the great distance between the two islands does lend support
to a distinction.
Oliver says : "In the early part of the nineteenth century sealers
on Macquarie Island killed large numbers of this parrakeet for food.
They also captured a few alive and took them to Sydney for cage birds.
When the Russian expedition under Bellingshausen called at Macquarie
Island in 1820 the naturalists collected twenty parrakeets for museum
specimens while a live one was bought from a sealer for three bottles of
rum. The live bird was taken to Sydney where it and a black cockatoo
were prized more than all the other live birds that were obtained during
the expedition ". In 1880 J. H. Scott visited Macquarie Island and
reported that the parrakeet " occurred in great numbers round the
shore. Makes its nests under tussocks 55 . When A. Hamilton visited the j
island in 1894 he found no parrakeets.
Again quoting Oliver : " From some sealers on the island he :
gathered the information that the parrakeets frequented the shore
where they searched for crustaceans and other small animals amongst
the heaps of cast-up seaweed. According to sealers' reports in the early
part of the nineteenth century the parrakeet laid its eggs in burrows
in the ground ".
It is presumed that they were exterminated by cats which had been
abandoned by the penguin slaughterers.

The Black Bulbul has a wide distribution ranging from Madagascar
to Japan and the many countries in which its several races are to be
found include India, Ceylon, Burma, Indo-China, Formosa, and
Central and South China.
The bird measures about i o inches in length, the sexes are alike, the
bill and legs are bright coral red and the tail is forked with the outer
feathers slightly curved outwards. All races, I believe, have a loose
untidy crest, but the general feathering in the species varies as between
the races from ashy-grey to jet black. Some races have white heads.
We purchased four Black Bulbuls in 1957. Two of these were
ashy-grey being either M.m. psaroides from the Himalayas or M.m.
nigricens from Assam, and two were almost all black which we later
identified as M.m. nigerrimus from Formosa. We were told at the time
of purchase that two of the birds were from Formosa but we did not
believe it ! Examination of many skins of the various races of
Microscelis madagascariensis at the Natural History Museum, South
Kensington, confirmed the statement of the dealer, Mr. Dineen, then
of Colliers Wood. Our four Bulbuls had the forward portion of the
primary and secondary flight feathers of a lighter colour than the rear
(broader) portion to give the effect almost of a silvery diffusion to the
lower part of the wings. This shading is not general with all the races.
One of the Bulbuls died two years ago leaving us with three, which we
still have and which over the years we have exhibited with con-
siderable success at many Bird Shows, including the National Show.
For some years we have kept the Bulbuls in mixed collections of large
softbills and whydahs. A male of the black-type Bulbuls {M.m.
nigerrimus) has mated each year with one of the ashy-grey race. Gener-
ally three eggs have been laid in a cup-shaped nest in one or other of
the half open nest-boxes we have provided and the hen has incubated
them for many weeks without result. Either I have removed the eggs
to give the pair another chance or the eggs have eventually disappeared.
At mating time the pair always became very aggressive to the other
two Bulbuls and last year the cock killed a cock Summer Tanager
before I could enter the aviary and save it. They were not aggressive
to larger birds such as Spreo Starlings and a Giant Whydah. Some-
times the Bulbuls were wintered without heat, at other times they were
caged with some heat, it depended on the severity of the winters and
the accommodation available.
This spring we decided for the first time that when they came into
breeding condition we would give the pair the aviary to themselves to

see if they could successfully breed when left undisturbed by other
birds. The male also appeared to be getting on in years and we doubted
if he would live through another winter. On 18th May I observed one
of the females chasing the other (I have assumed since the fourth bird
died that we had one male and two females) and obviously incited by
the male which was creating in the manner of the species, i.e. with
wild excitable shrieks. I quickly removed the now somewhat battered
odd Bulbul and left the pair in the aviary as planned. This aviary is
shaped like an " L " with a shelter at one end. At the other end (the
base of the " L ") is a well-pruned and old-established nut tree around
which a part of the flight had been built. A half open nest-box was j
fitted about 5 ft. 6 in. up in the tree and a wicker nest-basket in the
shelter. Last year for the first time the hen did not use a box but built
a nest in the tree about 4 feet from the ground and incubated her eggs
for about six weeks. This time the hen took to the nest-box and after
several false starts she finally built a deep nest inside the box. It was
in late June when I realized that the hen was sitting and when she was
off feeding I felt inside the nest to find the usual three eggs which are
quite large in size having a pinky background covered with brown I
splotches and speckles. There was also a broken egg on the floor of the
flight, which was grassed and contained a couple of shrubs. On 7th July
both birds rushed into the shelter when I arrived with the daily feed,
but it seemed to me that they ate all the live food and did not carry any
to the nest. All the same I gave extra mealworms and gentles. The
next morning the same thing happened again, but this time I opened
the flight door and felt in the nest. There were three chicks probably
two days old. I gave a pot of mealworms and gentles and a little later
on I saw the hen take some to the nest-box and feed. There was nothing
reserved about this hen. After years of disappointment she now had
a family and did not mind who knew it ! One saw her either inside
the box with her head and beak pointing upwards brooding the chicks
or perched on the edge of the box cramming mealworms down their
throats. For the next 10 days the main food taken was mealworms
with a few gentles and practically no soft food. I occasionally saw the
male bird take a mealworm out to the nest-box, probably to feed the
hen, but it seemed that all the feeding, at least when we were about,
was done by the hen.
On Sunday, 18th July, one young Bulbul left the nest in the morning
and by early afternoon all three youngsters were in the flight. In colour
they were slaty-grey, whitish underneath with dark beaks and eyes.
The legs and feet were a dirty flesh colour. When evening came one
young bird had found the shelter but the other two were still in the
flight, which was separated by S inch wire-netting from another flight
in which were a breeding pair of Rothschild's Grackles. Each time the
young Bulbuls clung to the partition netting they were attacked by

the grackles and defended by their parents all of which created quite
a din. When we approached the aviary the old Bulbuls then turned
their attacks to us. However, after a time we managed to shut the
parents in the shelter, collected the youngsters and put them through
the flap. It was almost dark by this time and rather than risk a repeat
performance the next day we decided to keep the family of Bulbuls in
the shelter for a while.
The young birds came on fast and I cut down on mealworms and
increased the gentles. After a couple of days I reduced the gentles and
forced the hen to feed the regular soft food which contained chopped
dates, soaked figs cut into small pieces, soaked sultanas and shredded
apple all added to the basic insectivorous food I give all softbills. The
three young birds were not very active and were generally perched
close together in a line clamouring to be fed and were satisfied by the
hen alone. I never saw the cock feed them in the shelter. The hen fed
the young birds only a few feet from us and was as unconcerned at our
presence as she was when feeding them in the nest. On 28th July the
hen started tearing up the newspapers which covered the floor, placing
the shreds in the wicker nest-basket. Needless to say, with each instal-
ment the contents fell back on the floor. I thought it time to let the birds
into the flight once again. The hen left first and went straight to her
old nest to be followed by the male and the three young birds which
were now flying well and had half-grown tails. All were ignored by the
grackles. In between sitting in the nest-box the hen fed the youngsters
who most of the time sat with her. On 10th August I checked the nest
to find the usual three eggs. The cock looked anything but spruce, he
seemed just about to moult, so at this stage I did not expect the eggs to
hatch out. Incubation was also intermittent because the young
Bulbuls seemed to be unable to feed themselves and all the work fell
on the hen.
On the mornings of the 17th and 18th August, I watched carefully
when I gave out the daily ration of mealworms to the family. The hen
came off the nest and gave every mealworm to the three young birds,
keeping none for herself and leaving none for the cock who was not
so tame and kept out of the way. At 2 p.m. on the 18th there was a
terrific commotion, the screechings and wailings sounded like a cat in
distress. I thought the eggs must have hatched out after all, so I fed
more mealworms which the hen promptly thrust down the throats of
the three young birds which had followed her into the shelter. When
I checked the nest, however, there was only one egg and a search in
the flight revealed two dead chicks which could not have been there
many minutes. In fact, I think they hatched that day or the previous
evening. Both had been injured, but whether before or after death I
do not know. It is possible that the family occupancy of the nest was
the cause. There was no sign of any egg-shells. Another possibility is

that we did not give enough mealworms to satisfy the demands of the
three young birds, as it seems that the nearest open gape gets priority
in the bird world.
We now did what we should have done a week earlier and caught up
the three youngsters, caging them as far as possible from their parents.
The hen went back to her solitary egg and then sat until ist September
when I removed the egg. Both birds are in a heavy moult at the time
of writing (3rd September), and the three young birds after starving
themselves for the best part of a day, soon consumed everything
provided. They are now in an aviary to themselves, have grown full
tails and show small crests. The beaks are still black, the legs a little
more flesh coloured, but there is no sign as yet of the brilliant coral red
bills and legs of their parents.
As described above, Mrs. K. M. Scamell has bred the Black Bulbul,
Microscelis madagascariensis (Muller). It is believed that this may be a
first success. Any member or reader knowing of a previous breeding of
this species in Great Britain or Northern Ireland is requested to com-
municate at once with the Hon. Secretary.

I have for many years been an admirer of the tiny Avadavat. It must
have been as long ago as October, 1914, when newly arrived in India
I saw a cageful of these lovely little birds on the verandah of the
bungalow of the district magistrate of Ahmedabad. It was from
Ahmedabad that the Avadavat gets its name. It was from there,
they were, I think, first exported by the Portuguese in the seventeenth
century. Be that as it may, they are charming little birds ; they sit in a
row on their perch and from time to time one will stand up, as it were,
and sing. When first caught they are of a deep rich carmine colour, at
least the adult cocks, and I have been out in the early morning with
Waghris, a criminal tribe, so-called, to net them and I have held in
my hand these living little pictures. I have likened their colour to that
of a ripe tomato and the gradual fading in captivity to the yellow-brown
of the unripe tomato, but this is a crude description of so dainty a little
thing. I have seen the birds described, especially the Bombay form,
as a mahogany-red but this is a description which applies even to the
Bombay form as it loses the deep carmine of the wild bird--
indeed sometimes as the sun shines on its plumage, scarlet might seem
the colour.

I long endeavoured to find out why the colour fades as it does even in
India. I watched the tiny flocks in their natural haunts and observed
that they were constantly bathing in the marshy lands which they
frequented. I brought some back with me to England and bred some
in a large French cage I bought in a shop in Guernsey. The breeding
cock did get a touch of red in its plumage but nowhere near the
glorious colour of the newly caught bird. I carried the large cage, in
which the pair of birds were kept daily, into the garden of the house
in which we lived at Highgate. The plumage of some of the birds in
course of time became black. This was melanism with a vengeance.
It was only last year when I returned to my old love and bought
some Avadavats going out of colour at 5^. a pair, that I discovered the
secret of this beauty. Of the sixteen I purchased only a few cocks came
through the winter without showing the blackened plumage in varying
degree which so disfigures these little birds. The hens are also
subject to this darkening of the plumage but not usually to this
excessive degree. And these few cocks I determined to experiment
with. It was not the size of the cage that mattered because no distinc-
tion, it seemed to me, could be seen between the eight kept in a large
and roomy cage and the eight left in a smaller cage. I had at one time
thought the small panicum millet which we in India called " Kong "
was the darkening factor in the plumage of these little birds--at least in
captivity and so it may be--but all these birds were fed on a good
mixture of millets. Then I thought that it was dampness they wanted.
They lived on marshy land and constantly bathed in small pools, as
I had myself observed, and so I put the undarkened birds in cages,
carried these cages every day on to the lawn in the courtyard of this
large house I now inhabit, and watered them with rain water from an
ordinary watering-can ; they pecked at the grass through the bottom
wires of the cages. I gave them a daily portion of white worms which
</bodyText>
<equation confidence="0.525428" page_id="56365888"  page_num="169" year="" vol="">
I bred ; I gave them half ripe seeding grass and, as the weeks passed,
</equation>
<bodyText confidence="0.999422636363636" page_id="56365888"  page_num="169" year="" vol="">
some few of the cocks started to get the lovely carmine feathers of the
wild bird. I asked Mr. Prestwich to come and see them which he
kindly did. I think he was impressed and as I told him what I had done
he said " Just common sense ". And so it was--and a lot of trouble--
as the cages were brought into the house and out again, night and
morning.
I have treated my other small waxbills in the same way and they are
all in lovely plumage but the necessary disturbance has resulted only
in nests and eggs so far. But it is a beginning and I have in my cages,
come through the harsh English winter, some Avadavats in all the
carmine, scarlet, or crimson beauty of the wild.

I had not realized until recently that I did not report on my birds
last year as has been my habit for a long time. My excuse is that I left
Cleres early in September to go to South Africa, where I attended the
African Ornithological Congress. I spent October in Australia,
November in New Caledonia, returning to Los Angeles and New York,
through Tahiti in December.
A good many improvements have been effected at Cleres during the
last two years ; new steel-framed aviaries have replaced old ones,
and others have been added, particularly one for very small teal and
waders on a stream of running water. Pigmy Geese, Cotton and
Hottentot Teal are doing well in it ; also Superb Spreos, Red-headed
Marshbirds, and Collared Kingfishers.
Dr. E. Beraut kindly brings me a number of humming birds from
Brazil each year. About fifteen in a large outdoor aviary did very well
throughout the warm spring and summer of 1964, but, as is inevitable,
after a time when they felt fit they started killing one another, until
only one of each species was left in October when they were taken in
for the winter. They were Wood-nymph ( Thalurania glaucopis), Red-
tail ( Clytolaema rubricauda) , Crested ( Stephanoxis verreauxi), White and
Green ( Leucochloris albicollis ) ; but there were still four Black Jacobines
(Melanotrochilus fuscus) , a more accommodating species. In 1965 we
separated them more carefully. A pair of sunbirds usually share the
humming birds' aviaries but such savage species as Taccazze will
attack and kill them, and they have to be watched.
A nice collection of Colombian and Central American Tanagers and
Sugarbirds are now well established in the large indoor aviaries built
in what used to be the dining-room of the chateau. There are a few
other birds with them, particularly Rosita's Buntings ( Passerina
rositae ), a magnificent species from South-West Mexico, quite rare as a
wild bird, which has never before reached Europe alive. It resembles the
well-known Indigo Bunting, but it is a third larger, of a lighter and
brighter blue, with deep pink on the breast and abdomen and a white
ring around the eyes. The female is brownish grey and the male has no
eclipse plumage.
Among the young birds reared during the last two years, I should

one. Mr. Dillon Ripley had presented me with two pairs in 1963 and
their many young were reared. The other one is the Lesser Grey
Duck (A. superciliosapelewensis ), sent by Mr. A. T. Tonnelier, from New
Caledonia. It is found throughout the islands of the South Pacific and
resembles the New Zealand Grey Duck (A. s. superciliosa ), itself a little
better marked than the Australian (A. s. rogersi), but it is one-third
smaller, and therefore more attractive. Eight young were reared in
1964, and more in 1965, for the first time in captivity, as it appears that
the subspecies had never before been imported.
Quite a few ducks now breed freely on the lake and other ponds.
Duckling hatched under such free conditions seldom survive as they fall
prey to rats, crows, and other pests. Even when these pests are
controlled, the ducklings may die for lack of sufficient food. We have
now remedied this by placing here and there small runs of large mesh
wire-netting on wooden platforms, where proper starting mash and
pellets are provided. Small ducks can get through and feed, while
adults are kept out and cannot gobble it up.
During the last two years the following species have bred success-
fully : Grey-lag, Swan, White-fronted and Snow Geese ; Common
Shelducks; Falcated, Mandarin, and Bahama Ducks ; Chilean
Pintails ; Chiloe Wigeons ; Chilean, Cinnamon, Silver, Puna, Sharp-
winged, Brazilian and Garganey Teals ; Common Shoveller;
Australian White-eyes. Red-heads are known to be semi-parasitic
and this year two have been reared by a Chilean Pintail and one by
a Cinnamon Teal. Whistling Ducks ( Dendrocygna) are seldom successful
in bringing up their broods on the lake, but in 1965 four Cuban and
seven Fulvous survived. Hartlaub Ducks hatched young in September,
1964, but failed to rear them. They had to be removed from the lake
in 1965 as they relentlessly persecuted any female that came out with a
brood, causing the ducklings to scatter and die. It was astonishing
as they never bothered other birds ; but the sight of a brood drives
them mad. Male Comb Ducks also had to be taken away, as they
attacked other large ducks, particularly Shelducks.
Among the game-birds reared in 1964 and 1965 the following are of
some interest : Bar-tailed Pheasants, Ceylon and Sonnerat's Jungle
Fowl, Cheer, and some Specifer Peafowls from a two-year-old imported
pair.
We recently received from New Zealand pairs of Keas, Weka Rails,
and Paradise Shelducks, the latter for a change of blood.
About eight pairs of Red-headed Parrot Finches in a large indoor
flight breed continuously ; these beautiful birds are easy to keep and to
propagate ; they do not quarrel badly between themselves or with
other birds. This species is not rare in New Caledonia and permits to
export a very limited number of pairs are issued each year to a few
bird fanciers to be exchanged for desirable foreign species.

By Canon J. R. Lowe (Backford, Chester, England)
Owing to a contretemps with a flying squirrel, we lost in the winter
of 1964-65 a hen Grenadier and a cock Violet-eared Waxbill. The
widower and the widow were kept together until the spring of 1965
indoors. It was some weeks before the two birds sat next to each other
at roosting time, but at last they seemed to accept each other as an
engaged couple.
In May they were put out in a small garden aviary, their only
companions being a pair of Turquoisine Parrakeets. During late
May and June three dome-shaped nests were made and both birds
built. On each occasion two white eggs were laid and the birds were
seen to pair frequently. On each of these three occasions the eggs were
infertile. The cock Grenadier sat most of the day.
The fourth nest was begun in mid-June and by 3rd July there was
certainly a living youngster in the nest. Well was left alone and on
18th July two young birds left the nest. They were rufous-brown
on the back, somewhat lighter on breast, and slight indication of royal
blue on rump ; beaks black, legs dark. One young bird promptly
drowned itself on the first day. The remaining bird has done well and
is now (25th August) as large as the Grenadier cock. The colour is now
much more the rich rufous-brown of the Grenadier on head, shoulders,
and back. Purple ear-patches are showing as well as the blue of the
Grenadier round the eyes. The beak is changing to red, tail dark and
rather full like the Grenadier. One imagines that more purple will
develop on the breast when the juvenile plumage has been shed.
The cock Grenadier was a model parent. A good many mealworms
were used during the raising of the young, as well as green food and

usual foreign finch seed mixture and small softbill mixture was also
offered, but not much used.
The pair went to nest a fifth time, but all four eggs were clear. The
hybrid has now been brought indoors ; its behaviour is that of a cock
and he sings.
I was interested in the article on egg-rolling by the Painted Quail in
the July-August, 1965, number of the Magazine. My own birds are
great rollers of eggs. I heard of an explanation as to why hen Painted
Quail lay eggs so indiscriminately about their aviary. The suggestion
is that in the wild eggs are laid round about the actual nest when eggs
are being incubated ; these eggs outside the nest are attacked by a fly
that lays its eggs through the shell of the egg (some ovidepositor !),
maggots hatch out, so that when the little Quail hatch there is a source
of food. This I suggest is a pretty tall story.
A young hen Quail hatched in April laid a batch of seven eggs in
early August, sat for over a week, then left the nest for good ; all seven
eggs had developed embryos. She laid again and has four fully fledged
young.
Bourke's Parrakeets (a 1964 pair) had two nests and reared two and
three young with no trouble. The 1964 pair of Turquoisines laid five
eggs in late May, all infertile. She then laid eight eggs, hatched three ;
one died early on in egg, four were infertile. One youngster turned out
of nest on first day but the remaining two were reared for a week and
then left! We hand-reared them with great success for two days and
then slightly overdid the heat and lost them. They took food, a cereal
cream, with great avidity.
We find Tailor Birds a very pleasant addition to a garden aviary,
they are jolly little birds very Wren-like in behaviour. They only went
out in late July ; but next year if they go out earlier they may make an
effort to breed, given a bush with fairly big leaves. A pair of Stanleys
spent weeks house-hunting, and in the end did nothing. Zebra finches
obliged throughout the summer ; they seldom with us lay more than
five eggs and the families vary between two and four.
The somewhat elderly White-spotted Bluethroat hen lost her mate
in April. She had eggs with us in Gloucestershire and last year, our
first in Chester, had a further four eggs but in neither case was there any
fertility. ^
A Corn Bunting hen had two beautiful nests on the ground, two eggs
and one egg respectively, but as her only possible husband was a Reed
Bunting, her vigils were wasted.
A pair of Crimson-winged Pytillias laid in February indoors and sat
with no fertility. When placed outside nothing has been done through-
out the summer. Three young Goldfinches left the nest on 16th August.

The hybrid pigeon, above referred to, has gone through its seasonal
molt which has in no wise intensified or diminished its plumage colour.
Visitors who see this male pigeon for the first time invariably take him
for an ordinary blue Rock Pigeon or even street pigeon, since they do
not know his ancestry nor can they see the typical Snow Pigeon tail-
marks which this hybrid reveals. However, there is considerable
likeness in the appearance of this bird's body to suggest definitely Snow
Pigeon ancestry. Thus, the small, fine head is distinctive, as is also the
entire body conformation ; and, of course, the bird's behaviour, details
of which will follow shortly.
Having the hybrid's mother, a blue Strasser hen, no longer in my
possession, I mated him with, or more exactly, I placed him in the
company of, a white racing homer hen. He was very much afraid of
her, flying away the moment she appeared anywhere near him. This
reaction continued for several weeks ; but finally propinquity did its
job ! The birds began to live together peaceably. Even though there
appeared to be neither billing nor cooing marking the two birds'
behaviour, there was copulation on several occasions. The hybrid took
no interest whatever in any suitable nest location or nest-building, leaving
these matters entirely to the hen. Within less than a week she laid two
large eggs, which, quite remarkably, she incubated day and night,
leaving the nest only for short periods of time to seek food and drink. Her
" mate " would simply not have anything to do with taking his turn at
incubation. For five days and nights she sat tightly on the eggs, then
deserted them. Both eggs proved to be fertile, contrary to the assertions
of many fancier friends who confidentially expected infertile ones.
From now on the behaviour of the hybrid male changed, but for what
reason I do not know. Billing and cooing became the order of the day,

and both birds inspected the old nest location. The pair, now definitely
mated, built the usual flimsy nest in the same box that was used before.
On 21 st July, so my notes run, the hen laid the first egg, and not until
three days later, the second egg. And, worth noting, this time the male
took his regular turns at brooding the eggs. At first, very shy, he would
fly off the nest suddenly whenever I went past it. Gradually, he began
to " accept " my presence once or twice a day, vigorously flapping his
wings at me as I passed and voicing his displeasure with his sharp
sc kuck, kuck, kuck 55 often repeated and inherited from his Snow
Pigeon father. In due course of time, he ceased both actions, letting me
pass his nest almost unnoticed. Ordinarily, a domestic pigeon male
incubates from about io in the morning until 4 or 4.30 in the afternoon.
Not so, this Snow Pigeon hybrid, who usually sat tight until 6 p.m.
It was 7th August when the first egg hatched, the second one
hatching 9th August. Both chicks were light-coloured, and both grew
apace until 17th August, when both died. They were very well
developed physically ; their crops well filled. There was no indication
of canker or similar common pigeon disease. At this time it could be
plainly seen that both were pure white, the colour of their racing-homer
mother. I am reliably informed that the chicks of hybrid matings
involving wild and domestic breeds frequently die at this age, even
though my informant had no research data supporting his assertion.
Assuredly, it has been quite revealing to observe the changing
behaviour of the hybrid male during the entire breeding period,
particularly his assuming incubation and later feeding duties regularly,
and seemingly becoming tamer and more and more domesticated.
Following the demise of the squabs, breeding activities stopped and the
molt came on. Now for several months the pair has been quiescent, the
hybrid male especially showing no inclination whatsoever to resume
nesting, but perching quietly most of the time. Since Snow Pigeons at
large instinctively observe seasonal changes, nesting for only a few
months in the year, it may be that my hybrid, having inherited relevant
tendencies from his Snow Pigeon father, will also nest only during a
few months of the year, and not the whole year through, as do many
of my wild foreign doves in our mild Southern California climate.
Having secured another well-marked, blue, barless Strasser hen,
I will attempt to mate him to this sizeable bird, whose plumage
colours--blue and white--at least suggest a pattern similar to that of
the Snow Pigeon. Since further fertile sets of eggs are quite likely in the
offing, I hope in due course of time to raise one or more chicks to
maturity and thus continue this rather fascinating experiment.

Introduction
There are two ways in which one bird may signal its intentions to )
another. One is by sound, the rather simple avian language of call-
notes and song ; and the other is by postures which indicate its mood |
or intentions. It is important that another individual should note and
understand such postures, even when they are slight and subtle, and in
many species such postures are made more obvious by the presence of
patches or patterns of brightly coloured feathers, the appearance of I
which will change according to the bird's position. This appearance
may be further modified by the degree of erection of the feathers, and
this will depend on the extent to which the bird experiences alarm or
aggressiveness at that time. We tend to take the bright patterns and
colours on a bird's plumage for granted, but there is plenty of evidence
that they are the result of selective evolution. Although there seems
to be a limit within which variation can occur, yet within this limit
conspicuous features are evolved to distinguish one species from another
and to assist one bird in interpreting the signals conveyed by another
member of its own species. If, therefore, a bird possesses bright and
conspicuous colours or patterns on its plumage then we may suspect
that these have some function in communicating information to other
birds ; and since this information will be in the form of visual signals
we can both see them and attempt to interpret them.
When I started to keep Painted Quail, Excalfactoria chinensis, I was
very intrigued by the distinctive colouring of the male, and anxious to
see what part it played in the behaviour of the pair. By contrast the
female is dull in colour. She is warm buff below with narrow, scalloped
transverse barring of dark brown on the feathers, heaviest on the
flanks. The throat is pale buff and the eye-stripe reddish-buff, while
the ear-coverts and crown are brown, the latter heavily barred with
dark brown and with a central streak of pale buff. The wing-coverts
are thickly marked with wavy transverse bars on a light brown ground,
and the back is heavily barred and blotched in dark brown on a brown
and buff background, while along the centre of most feathers is a
narrow streak of pale buff. The whole pattern is a cryptic one, of the
type that one associates with game-birds, and it is amazingly effective
at hiding the bird. The combination of transverse bars and long streaks
seems to create a two-dimensional effect that destroys the appearance
of solidarity. I have gazed intently at a single tussock of dead grass on
the aviary floor which I knew concealed the female, but found it
difficult to distinguish just where she was crouching, her pattern and

colour blending with her surroundings to a far greater extent than I
would have expected.
The male is rather different. His back is coloured like that of the
female but of a generally darker tint. The crown of the head, the nape,
and the whole of the back have a similar pattern with transverse
blackish bars on a brown background, with a pale streak along the
middle of the head and pale longitudinal buff streaks on most of the
feathers. Thus far it indicates the basic rule of such plumages that,
however conspicuous the colouring, it will tend to be least obvious
when viewed from above. This is presumably an anti-predator device
intended to foil birds of prey. The male is a glossy slate-blue on the
upper breast, the colour extending on to the side of the head and fore-
head, and right along the flanks to the edges of the upper tail-coverts.
Fig. i. Male plumage.
Contrasting with this is an area of rich chestnut-red from the mid lower
breast over the belly, under tail-coverts, and tail, the last being hidden
by the long, brown-patterned upper tail-coverts. The most conspicuous
markings are on the throat. An area from the base of the bill, covering
ear-coverts and throat and extending as a rounded shield on to the upper
breast, is jet black. On this black patch are several contrasting white
markings. There is a gular crescent extending as a broad band of
white near the hinder edge of the patch and tapering towards the hind
ear-coverts. A white malar streak from the base of the bill broadens
into a club-shaped patch on the lower ear-coverts, and a narrow white
streak from the nostril extends back to the lower eye-lid (see Fig. i).
In the following notes I have tried to describe the more obvious
postures in which plumage and voice are used by this species to convey
information from one bird to another. I have also used rather simpli-
fied sketches which are intended only to indicate how the appearance of
the plumage areas varies, and are not exact drawings of the appearance
of the bird at such times.
Normal Movement.
When moving about in the open the Painted Quail tends to move in
a slightly crouching posture, the head only a little higher than the

hunched body. In this position the throat and flank colouring of the
male are reasonably visible. In general the head tends to appear rather
small in comparison to the body, and its size is a little exaggerated in
the sketches. In many respects there is much in the behaviour of the
Painted Quail that suggests a tiny rail rather than a gamebird. When
moving through low cover it tends to crouch and I have seen a bird in
an aviary, finding a tiny run through the grass, glide along it with its
belly practically touching the ground and its head held low, and moving
as easily as though it were on wheels. It will run rapidly and appears
very reluctant to fly unless forced to do so. Walking and running are
accompanied by rapid nodding movements of the head.
Movement of any sort appears to be invariably accompanied by a
constant soft calling, which I would describe as close contact notes.
This appears to keep the birds in touch with one another and reassure
each of the other's presence. The call of the female is a faint high-
pitched piping which the cock answers with a soft clucking at a slightly
lower pitch. At times these calls are barely audible at four or five feet ;
distance and it is extremely difficult to be sure that the bird is uttering :
them ; but at moments of excitement, or when the birds are separated,
they become considerably louder. They appear to be uttered all the time
that a bird is on the move, almost as though it could not move without
them.
Alarm Crouch (Fig. 2).
When the birds are alarmed by a sudden approach, particularly if it
is from some large predator or person that looms over them, they
crouch. In the crouch the body is lowered until breast and belly are
flat on the ground. The head is lowered until the bill-tip practically
touches the ground, and the feathers are sleeked. This posture is
striking in that the conspicuous plumage disappears almost completely,
and on uneven ground or among herbage may not be seen at all. The
sleeked body shows only the barring and streaks that help to conceal it,
while the crouching posture eliminates the shadow that would betray
a standing bird. The only slight anomaly in this posture is that since
the tail end is rather more conspicuous than in ordinary circumstances
the chestnut-red under tail-coverts of the male are partly visible from
some angles. This is not a very noticeable feature, however, and this
posture admirably demonstrates the advantage gained when con-
spicuous colouring is limited to the underside.

Following Signal.
I was puzzled by the appearance of the chestnut-red colour on the
under tail-coverts and tail of the crouching male. While it was obvious
that such colour on the underside might be of value it was difficult to
see why it should be present on an area of plumage which was only
obvious from behind. However, when watching a pair in the grass of
their aviary at the London Zoo, where the aviary interior is raised a
little, and watching a male trot off along tiny paths through the
growing grass, followed by the female, I was immediately struck by
the conspicuousness of this chestnut-red rear end as it disappeared
along the track. I think that this probably functions as a following
signal in a species in which the pair appear to remain together and
where there is much movement along small tracks through thick
vegetation.
Tidbitting (Fig. 3).
One of the most pleasant features of the Painted Quail is the strong
social bond between members of a pair. This appears to give rise to
more highly developed social interactions than are apparent in other
species. When the male finds a source of food he will call the hen to it.
If it is a single item such as an insect he will pick it up in his bill,
uttering all the time a distinct clucking note, a soft " chook 55 louder
than the close contact call mentioned earlier. At the same time he
adopts a special food-offering attitude in which the whole body is
slanted over to one side away from the female, and presented broad-
side-on, so that the slate and chestnut-red of flanks and underside
becomes more apparent. At the same time the neck is arched with
head lowered a little and the bill turned towards the female so that the
slightly expanded black-and-white throat pattern is displayed to her as
the food is offered. Sometimes the food is dropped and picked up by
the female, but on other occasions she takes it from the male's bill. This
behaviour appears to be homologous with the calling to food shown by
the domestic fowl, Gallus gallus , and I have therefore used the term
" tidbitting " which is used for such behaviour in that species.
A more extreme form of tidbitting was described to be by R. Restall

who repeatedly saw the male of his pair offer food by flattening itself
on the ground with head extended and food held in the level bill,
while the wings were spread at the sides. I have only seen this from
my birds once, when the female ignored the spider which I had given
the male and, being scared by my presence, ran over his back to flee.
His head was not so low as to hide the throat pattern completely, and
his wings were about two-thirds spread.
This behaviour seems a little odd, but it can be seen in the forward
threat that the directing of the head towards another bird indicates 5
hostility. The lateral drawing away in tidbitting and wing-display
can therefore be interpreted as the opposite of this, an indication of
definite non-hostile appeasing tendencies ; and this flattening down
might be the result of this appeasing tendency carried to extremes in a
bird whose reactions were thwarted by the indifference of the female,
or in which the appeasement tendencies were present at very high
intensity.
Fig. 4. Grow.
Crowing (Fig. 4).
The Painted Quail male, as in most other related species, has a loud
crowing call which appears to be used for advertisement purposes. It is
a rather high-pitched tri-syllabic whistling call on a descending scale
" quee-kee-kew ", the middle note being short. On some occasions
this middle note may be lacking, producing a di-syllabic call, and I
once heard the call rendered with four notes. When the call is uttered
at full intensity the bird stands very upright and as it utters the call
throws its head well back, jerking the whole body upwards and back-
wards at the same time. I have also heard it uttered by a resting bird
which has not bothered to shift from its hunched posture. In this case
the most striking feature was the sudden momentary widening of the

white gular crescent at each call. From a distance of some seven or
eight yards, with the bird half-hidden in cover, a sudden little white
flash was apparent at each utterance.
Growl (Fig. 5).
In addition to the crow there is another relatively loud call, here
referred to as the growl. When the bird has been seen uttering this it
has either had head and body in a low horizontal position or been in
a hunched posture with the head slightly higher than the body. From
the periods when it has been heard we can also infer that it is given
at times by resting birds. When this is given a bird tends to fluff its
feathers and lift its wings slightly as though puffing itself out to look
larger. It then utters a low-pitched hoarse " koraah ", a relatively
loud sound. As it is uttered the neck and throat are distended as though
a relatively large volume of air had been taken in and was now being
expelled with some effort. This call may be very long-drawn-out, with
a slight rising inflection.
I am a little uncertain about the function of this call. I have heard
it from a solitary bird in a dealer's cage, and from my own male when
he has been startled and has run and lost contact with the female, and
friends who keep these birds inform me that when the female is incu-
bating the cock may roost away from her and call frequently with this
note during the night. The only common element appears to be its
occurrence in a male that is not with a female, and I suspect it to be a
distance contact call, intended to restore contact between birds
separated by some distance. As far as is known it is only used by the
male. It might possibly be homologous with the covey rallying call
used by some other game-bird species.
Forward Threat (Fig. 6)
In keeping a single pair of birds there is relatively little chance of
noting aggressive behaviour except in interaction with other species.
Both sexes of the Quail pair tended to react aggressively towards finches
which approached closely when they were feeding. Later very strong-
reactions were observed towards a pair of Japanese Quail (Coturnix
(c.) japonica ) caged next to them. In spite of the fact that the latter

were four or five times as large as the Painted Quail they were im-
mediately threatened by the smaller birds if they approached the
wire-netting. The threat posture was a slight crouch with the head
held low and bill pointing forwards but raised slightly. In this posture
none of the ventral chestnut-red colouring could have been visible to
the threatened bird. No special vocalization was noted at such times.

Sexual Display (Fig. 7).
Precopulatory display was observed several times. The male would
follow the female around, running in a series of arcs, first to one side of
her and then to the other, in a rather upright posture with the belly
and flank feathers fluffed out so that a very extensive area of chestnut-
red plumage was visible from the front. He appeared to attempt to
display this pattern to the moving female and when she allowed a
close approach seized her by the nape and mounted her. Each moun-
ting was accompanied by a single short faint plaintive note uttered by
the male. The chestnut-red feathering would appear to play an
important part in the display. In an earlier comparative account of
the wing display of pheasants, Kruijt (1963) has described this as it
occurs in the Painted Quail. In the display the male lowered the wing
furthest from the female. Kruijt was puzzled by the fact that whereas

in most pheasant species the body side nearest the hen was lowered in
display, the reverse was true in the Painted Quail. If we assume the
ventral colouring to be important in the courtship display of the
species, then this display becomes understandable since the posture
which he shows (see Fig. 8, drawn from Kruijt's paper) is the one in
which this coloration would become most apparent in a lateral
display. The Red-legged Partridge, Alectoris rufa , has a similar display
in order to show the flank markings ; the wing furthest from the hen
being drooped and spread so that the primary tips may scrape the
ground (Goodwin, 1955). In the presence of body-tilting away from
the female to display the ventral colouring, this display shows some
similarity to the behaviour shown during tidbitting.

Only the more conspicuous and obvious postures of the Painted
Quail have been described here, but it is evident that each one combines
with the plumage colouring to present a different colour pattern and
one which will clearly indicate the bird's emotions or intentions.
Consider, for example, the relatively different amounts of slate-grey
and chestnut-red exposed if a bird is viewed from the front by another
bird during high-intensity crowing, sexual display, normal walking,
and forward threat.
At first sight this species appears to have a much more complex series
of signals and calls than do other, less conspicuous, quails. This might
be a real difference, in which case we may suspect that some factors
such as the habitat, or the long pair-bond as compared with the short
breeding season and migratory habits of species such as the Common
Quail, Coturnix coturnix , create a need for a complex form of communi-
cation. Alternatively it may be only an apparent difference, in which
case the obviousness of these signal postures in the Painted Quail is a
tribute to the effectiveness of this combination of colour pattern and
calls in conveying information not only to other birds but also to us
who watch them.

There does not appear to be a very great volume of information on
comparative posture and display in the gamebirds, apart from the true
pheasants and the grouse. The Red-legged Partridge, Alectoris rufa , has
been well described by D. Goodwin (1955), the Common Partridge,
Perdix perdix , by D. Jenkins (1961), and the Red Grouse, Lagopus
scoticus, by A. Watson and D. Jenkins (1964) ; but as yet we have
relatively little information on the quails, and in view of the difficulties
involved in even seeing these birds in the wild it is obvious that it is only
through aviculture that this will be achieved.

I am writing to you regarding an article which appeared in the
September-October, 1964, issue of the Avicultural Magazine
headed " Pheasants at The Sydney Royal Show ", by Norman
McCance (Avonsleigh, Victoria, Australia).
I would like to clear up the misunderstandings that have arisen about
my birds and here, as briefly as possible is the story of the origin of the
Yellow Banded Golden.
From the 1956 hatch of Golden Pheasants one cock bird appeared
that was different from the rest (this bird coloured in 1957), he was a
normal Golden except for the fact he had a yellow band about 1 \ inches
wide across his upper breast, with the normal red above and below the
bar. I immediately traced ancestors of this bird, and found for at least
eleven generations they had been mated Golden to Golden.
Confident that I had a mutation, I set out on a test mating pro-
gramme. I mated this bird back to its mother, there were no banded
birds from this mating ; the following year I mated one of the young
hens back to the banded bird and produced approximately 30 per cent
banded birds. Continuing with this line breeding I increased the
number of banded birds to almost 100 per cent.
Having no other family of birds to use for outcrossing I resorted to
inbreeding and they have been breeding true since i960, with no
ill-effects from the inbreeding.

I submitted the information concerning the breeding of these birds
to the CSIRO Division of Animal Genetics, and this is what they
state :--
" The results appear to fit well the hypothesis that the banded
condition is a dominant or semi-dominant autosomal mutation that
is fully expressed only in males.
In the following scheme the mutant gene will be written as B and
the normal gene as -J-. The original banded male would then
beB + .

From the information available the males with yellow ruffs could
be BB in which case the mutant is semi-dominant as the B + and BB
phenotypes can be distinguished.
Since mating the banded male to his daughters has not caused the
appearance of any characters it is impossible that the banded condi-
tion is due to crossing with a different strain of pheasant."
I hope that this will clear up the controversy, and that it will be of i
interest to readers of the Avicultural Magazine.

By J. F. Fulbeck (Covina, California, U.S.A.)
Although America is rich in birds, and in groups associated for the
study of birdlife, not many aviculturists would know what you were
talking about should you mention the Carolina Parrakeet. Yet, as late
as the 1880s, this colorful North American hookbill still was found in
sparsely settled areas, and prior to that time was plentiful in the south-
eastern section of the country. What accounted for the loss of the
only native psittacine that North America claimed was a combination
of avarice and irresponsibility. The assault on the Carolina Parrakeet
was a group act for which no charge was made and for which no indi-
vidual was held to account. It was what fiction writers claim does not
exist : a perfect crime.
Conuropsis carolinensis was a large and strikingly attractive bird ; it
measured over a foot in length and was over half a foot tall. In its day,
it was found abundantly along river bottoms within the boundaries of
its range, which extended from South Virginia on the Atlantic coast
eastward through Ohio, Indiana, Illinois, Missouri and eastern Texas,
and southward to the tip of Florida and the Gulf Coast. It was a brilliant
and happy-go-lucky bird, but as is sometimes said of human beings, it
was just " too good to live ". It takes no 007 to solve the riddle of its
death sentence ; the odds were against its survival from the first.
On the credit side, it was hardy. It fed on wild fruits and seeds along
river edges and in nearby forests, showing preference for beechnuts and
pecans, and the seeds of bur grass, thistle and cocklebur, and switching
in the winter to the seeds of sycamore, pine, and cypress. It travelled
in flocks. Though they did not migrate, the birds often moved widely
after food. For a long time the Carolina Parrakeet held its own against
enemies, but it was not equipped to withstand one enemy, whose
forces were vastly superior : it was no match for man. The disparity
between the two was hardly sportsmanlike ; it was no contest : but
the settlers of North America and their descendants admit many

errors beside which the destruction of one native bird seems small.
At the time, they rationalized, the bird needed killing for many reasons.
These are the reasons given :
Its flesh was edible, and its bright plumage was saleable. Fewer birds
in the sky were counted nothing if there was meat on the table, or if
milady could wear a gaudy-feathered hat in church that Sunday. It
made a loveable and fascinating pet ; as a cage bird it was in demand
both in America and abroad. Also, at least in a limited sense, it could
be classified as destructive, since its diet included grains and fruit.
It was a gregarious bird, a characteristic that made it especially vul-
nerable ; so fond was it of its companions that when some were shot
the rest returned, again and again, until there were no more left to
return. In the 1880's its presence became less apparent but some
birds were still about. These, when they were discovered, usually
were shot.
Inevitably, the gaily coloured parrakeet, a bright combination of
rose, green, yellow and white, no longer was in evidence. The hollow
trees in which it nested no longer held the two or three white eggs in
the spring, and its raucous cry, which it gave continuously in flight,
no longer was heard in the land.
There is some hope, a small hope, that the Carolina Parrakeet is not
extinct. Some naturalists embrace the wistful belief that a few still
may exist in some isolated place, perhaps the Great Dismal Swamp or
some equally desolate area almost impregnable. If the bird has found
refuge where men and guns do not appear, America still has a toe-hold
on one of the most attractive specimens of its native wild life--a small
part of the natural wealth of a great country, that was squandered on
the altar of greed.

Too few people, in other countries, realize that some of the best
collections of live birds existing at present are located in Northern
Italy. It has been my privilege to visit a few of them recently with my
old friend Professor A. Ghigi, whose series of pheasants, at Bologna,
still count among the best in the world. Some forty Hume's Bartails,
eight Satyr Tragopans, and many others have been reared in 1965 in
his aviaries, and he possesses such unusual species as Malay Crestless
and Sumatran Firebacks, Argus, Ocellated Turkeys, and White
Eared Pheasants. It is always a great pleasure to stay with him,
as I have done for so many years. At the age of 90, he is just as active as
ever, and we did not waste much time during the four days I spent at
his fine villa on the hills above the old city. On the first day, we went

to the national station and game farm at Corticella, where a number of
Quails, Partridges, Francolins, and Pheasants are reared and experi-
mented with, and also to the excellent commercial installations of
Dr. Buracchi, one of the best bird dealers. Our second day was well
filled by visits to two outstanding collections, those of the brothers ;
Callegari, near Ravenna, and of Dr. Roberto Bucci at Faenza.
Dr. P. F. Callegari has a big garden in the suburbs of Ravenna,
where he and his brother keep a large and unusual collection of birds
as well as a few mammals. Let us mention of the latter a family of
Lesser Pandas, with young born there, and a tame Great Anteater, :
which positively astonished me ! he was curled up in the fork of a
large tree, about 30 feet above the ground ! I had no idea that these
large Anteaters were climbers--its owners stated that it went up
every morning, sleeping the whole day there, coming down to feed
in the evening, and spending the night indoors.
The most difficult birds live in perfect condition in the Ravenna
aviaries. There are a number of waterfowl, waders, and some game j
birds at liberty in the grounds, including a beautiful pair of African !
Jabirus. Close to the house are many large moveable cages, about
6x4 feet, which contain various insectivorous and fruit-eating birds,
several species of Kingfishers, Trogons and Tanagers, a number of
other seldom seen species, and, best of all, a dozen Bee-eaters, among
them the beautiful Carmine (Merops nubicoides) and the Pigmy (M.
pusillus ), besides European M. apiaster and M. bullockoides, all in perfect
condition. A pair of small Wood Hoopoes were particularly attractive.
These cages are brought into a large hall during the winter. In
September, a few birds were kept there and two hand-reared Nightjars
were its most exciting denizens. Lots of live insects are reared and
collected to feed all these birds, hard to keep as a rule.
There is in the garden a roomy greenhouse with indoor compart-
ments and outdoor flights, full of rarities : Pied Kingfishers, Rollers,
Quetzals, etc., and many large aviaries. Several shelter interesting
birds of prey and pigeons, others almost a complete collection of
European waders, particularly Snipe and three Woodcock, tame and
in perfect condition after over three years in captivity. These waders'
aviaries are large and thickly planted, with suitable shallow ponds.
Finches, Weavers, and other small birds live in others. But perhaps the
best of all is a large-domed one, with an extensive pond of running
water (perhaps 30 X 15 feet) where Mergansers and, more par-
ticularly, Great Crested Grebes are kept in excellent shape, living there
for many years. The secret of such an unusual success is the fact that
no fish, particularly cut-up fish, is ever thrown into the pond, but are
placed in a small catching basin where the overflow from the pond
falls and runs out continually. In that way, no fish oil can pollute the
water in which the Grebes swim. Otherwise, they would have their

feathers oiled and soiled, and then die quickly. This condition is a must
with most delicate swimming birds, such as Grebes, Puffins and Water
Ouzels. Anybody interested in out-of-the-ordinary captive birds
should visit this amazing Ravenna collection.
Dr. Roberto Bucci lives at Faenza and there are two important
collections that he has gathered. One is in the town's public park,
where Dr. Bucci has generously built fine accommodations. They
consist of a large enclosure, well landscaped and planted, which
contains great numbers of waterfowl, waders, some deer and game
birds, and looks most attractive. There are separate aviaries for
parrots, doves, and small birds, and large, planted cages for leopards,
pumas, monkeys, and other animals, all done in good taste and no
doubt with experience of their needs. His home, outside the town, is
surrounded by a fine park, with well designed ponds. There are
Rheas and Emus with their young, Cranes, Storks, Swans, many Geese
and Ducks, and all the existing species of Flamingos. Along one side
are numerous aviaries containing many species of pheasants, small
birds, doves, pigeons, and parrots. I noticed among the latter a
beautiful pair of Spix Macaws, four Queen of Bavaria's Conures, and
several rare species of Pyrrhura. Dr. Bucci has business interests in
Brazil and brings some birds from that country. His collection
is certainly among the largest and best anywhere at the present
time, artistically displayed and well cared for.
We went another day to Monte Grosso, a pretty watering town,
with hot springs, in the foothills near Padua, where Mr. Sanguin
possesses a large collection of Pheasants and small game birds, well
housed along the walls of his garden, with vast breeding enclosures at
the back. It is almost a complete collection, with many varieties, open
to the public in the afternoon. Many breeding successes have been
achieved there.
The morning of my last day was devoted to a visit to Count
Mazett Zannini and the large garden of his old and fine house in
Bologna. There are waterfowl in the garden, as well as Demoiselle
Cranes which breed there annually. Many aviaries line the walls of the
garden, accommodating small birds, doves, and particularly excellent
parrots, parrakeets and lories. I was especially pleased to see
perfect Gang-gang Cockatoos, Hyacinthine and Ambiguous Macaws,
Queen of Bavaria's Conures and a number of Australian and South
American species, including several hybrids, Rock Peplar X Crimson-
wing.
I wish I could have seen more Italian collections, but I am certain
that a short description of those I was lucky enough to enjoy, will incite
some of our members to look for them when they go to that wonderful
part of Europe.

The 1965 breeding season at the Berlin Zoo was again very successful. !
Our pair of Snowy Owls, which raised the first four young ones bred
in any German zoo in 1962, established a record this year : from eight ;
eggs seven hatched and all seven young ones were reared successfully !
The first egg hatched on 29th May, the second on 31st May, three more
between 1st and 4th June, the next on 1 ith June, and the last on 13th
June. The difference in size between the first and the last young was
striking ! It is unlikely that such a big clutch could have been reared
in the wild. This is possible only in captivity where sufficient food is
available. The whole Snowy Owl family was eventually consuming
more than one hundred mice a day ! In 1962, from six eggs, four
hatched ; in 1963, from five eggs, four young ones were raised, and in
1964 from five eggs, four hatched.
After breeding the first Great Bustard in captivity last year, this time
again three young ones hatched, one of which was strong enough to
survive. However, when it was nearly grown up and put with the flock
unfortunately it was killed by the other Bustards.
In our breeding colony of Flamingos the first Chilean Flamingo
bred in any German zoo hatched on 5th July, 1965. During the pre-
ceding years both the Chileans as well as the European Flamingos had
been sitting on their eggs persistently, but only Europeans hatched.
Now again on 17th and 21st June, 1965, two young European Flamingo
chicks hatched, but one of them unfortunately was drowned during a
thunderstorm when nearly four weeks old. The remaining two chicks
grew up rapidly and are doing well.
However, it is a rather unsatisfactory result, that only three of
altogether twenty-two eggs hatched, which may be explained by the
difficulties the pinioned birds have in copulation.
Among the other hatchings two Cormorants, eight Cuban Tree
Ducks, two Laysan Teal, 170 Mallards (!), forty-three Australian
Black Ducks, thirty-seven Wood Ducks, one Philippine Duck, two
Magellan Geese, five Swan Geese, two Emperor Geese, four Black-
necked Swans, four Banded Plovers, seventy-two Wild Turkeys,
eighteen Ocellated Turkeys, four Impeyan Pheasants, one Siamese
Fireback, twenty-one California Quails, four Great Eagle-Owls, one
Little Owl (hand-raised), one Derbyan Parrakeet, and eight Grey-
breasted Parrakeets may be worth mentioning.
The participants of the 20th Annual Conference of the International
Union of Directors of Zoological Gardens, which was held at the Berlin
Zoo in early September, were greatly impressed by the outstanding
breeding results in our bird section.

were among the most welcome new arrivals this year, which are only
seldom permitted to be exported from Australia. To our knowledge
no other zoo in the world is as lucky as the Berlin Zoo in now exhibiting
in a spectacular collection the seven main species of Pelicans, two of
which have already been bred successfully in 1964. This time unfortu-
nately the Pelicans settled down to breed in another part of their
enclosure where they were too much disturbed by each other and by
the public. All the eggs laid were soon destroyed.
Moreover, two pairs of the valuable King Parrots, four Eyton's
Tree Ducks, and six Silver Gulls [Larus novaehollandiae) arrived from
Australia--a result of the new contacts between the Berlin Zoo and
several Australian zoos established on occasion of the 19th International

The most valuable newcomers were five Bald Crows (Picathartes

four Andean Flamingos, which arrived on 13th August and are
extremely difficult to keep in captivity because in the wild they live
only on certain microscopic algae. The Berlin Zoo is now showing all
six existing species of Flamingos.

A first principle in captive bird breeding is that success comes
slowly to new collections. For this reason the Bronx Zoo's staff has
been delighted with the rapid response of its new water bird groups
to a building for aquatic birds that will become one year old on 25th
September, 1965.
The building, with unusual habitat exhibits has been described
elsewhere (see " A New Home for the Waterbirds of the World ",
Animal Kingdom , LXVII (5), 131-141), but its already promising
breeding returns have not been recorded.

Bird breeding results for 1965 have been good throughout the Zoo.
The Tropical House proved ideal, although it is often difficult to
ascertain which species have bred when so many are at liberty in
such an enormous building. Nests are usually high in thick tropical
vegetation, therefore not easy to find. We have observed young
Cordon Bleus, Green Singing Finches, Indian White-eyes, Tri-coloured
Nuns, Blue-winged Sivas, Orange-cheeked and Red-eared Waxbills, and
a Kiskadee was reared in an aviary. (. Avicult . Mag., Vol. 71, No. 5, p. 145.)
Species bred in other parts of the Zoo include : Fischer's Lovebirds,
Great Eagle, Spotted Eagle and Snowy Owls, Golden-mantled Rosella,
Pennants and Red-rumped Parrakeets, Cockatiels, Common, Silver,
and Reeves's Pheasants, and Half or Vitelline Masked Weavers.
A pair of Golden-mantled Rosellas also hatched and reared a
Cockatiel. The adult Cockatiels were moved to another aviary, but
not before an egg had been laid in one of the nest-boxes. The Golden-
mantles took over the nest and reared the Cockatiel with their own
young. Both youngsters left the nest on the same day and have settled
down very well. This poses an interesting question--will the Cockatiel
accept another of the same species, or does it consider itself a Golden-
mantled Rosella Parrakeet.

As reported in the September-October issue of the Magazine, a pair
of Barn Owls, living in the British Owls' Aviary, which reared one chick
in 1963, another in 1964, and one in an earlier brood this year, nested
a second time and have now brought up a family of five. Other birds
bred in the gardens include two Spotted Eagle-Owls (also a second
brood), a Cattle Egret, three Night Herons, two Hume's Bar-tailed
Pheasants, two Sonnerat's Jungle Fowl, and an Erckel's Francolin.
A specimen of the Ringed Warbling Finch (. Poospiza torquata ), a
species new to the collection, has been presented by Messrs. G. H. and
J. R. Newmark. Other gifts include a pair of the blue mutation of
Splendid Parrakeet, already described by Dr. J. R. Hodges, bred by
Mr. D. Ikin, and donated by him ; a Pond Heron (. Ardeola grayi ) from
Miss Locker Lampson ; a Grey Kestrel (Falco ardosiaceus ) and a
White-headed Starling from Mr. Tom Spence ; a Brown-throated
Sunbird ( Anthreptes malacensis) --the Phillipine Islands race--a Flower
pecker believed to be an immature or female Palawan Yellow-rumped
(Anaimos johannae) and an unidentified ^oskrops from Dr. K. C. Searle ;
a Violet-eared Humming Bird and an Amazilia from Mrs. D. Ashken,
and several tanagers including the Masked Crimson Tanager ( Ram -
phocelus nigrogularis ) from Dr. J. Bowden.
The first clutch laid by our breeding pair of Sarus Cranes was sent to
Leckford as before, but these failed to hatch. A second clutch was laid
and incubated by the parents, but the eggs disappeared within a few
days of the potential hatching day, whereupon a single egg was laid
and incubated, hatching on 29th September.

The present-day aviculturist can, if he so wishes, obtain humming
birds with little difficulty ; but before the last war, being great rarities,
they were available to only a favoured few. The most enthusiastic and
successful devotee was our late President Mr. Alfred Ezra. One especial
favourite was a Garnet-throated Eulampis jugularis, well known on the
show bench. It arrived in October, 1934, and died on 1 ith November,
1942 ; being over eight years old it must surely hold the British record
for longevity. In America, however, an Emerald-throated Sericotes h.
holosericeus that arrived at the New York Zoological Park on 21st July,
1 953 , died as the result of an accident on 28th February, 1964. It was
thus in the collection for ten years, seven months, and seven days.

Reuben David, Superintendent, Ahmedabad Zoological Gardens,
India, reports two breeding successes. Red Lory Eos bornea on two
occasions hatched eggs but failed to feed the young. The third time
the two eggs were substituted in the nest of a partial lutino African
Ring-necked Parrakeet Psittacula krameri which had just laid. Two
young were hatched on 24th March, 1965, one died on the 27th but
the other was thriving and practically full-grown at the time of the

eggs incubated by a broody hen hatched, both young proved to be
females. June, 1964, three chicks were hatched from seven eggs, two
males and one female ; one male died. Thus from the two clutches
three females and one male were fully reared.

Psittacines are, of course, the parrot-like birds comprising the large
and very natural family Psittacidae--parrots, parrakeets, lories lori-
keets, parrotlets, cockatoos, macaws, conures, and quite a few others.
But what can be regarded as the equivalent collective name in English ?
Americans, with characteristic forthrightness, call them " hook-
bills "--even a club embodying this name has been suggested. The
name is certainly descriptive, but surely they are deserving of one
rather more euphonious.
And now, parrakeet or parakeet. The spelling is a matter of individual
preference, but as parrot is spelled with two Rs it is logical to follow
suit with parrakeet. In Great Britain, with the principal exception of

Down the years countless aviculturists and so-called bird-fanciers
must have had pipe-dreams of making a living out of breeding birds.
Just a very few have succeeded in making their dreams come true ;
some have managed to make a paying hobby of it, but the great
majority are indeed lucky if, as the result of their endeavours, they
make enough to pay for the food and incidental expenses.
The prospect does, however, appear to be dazzling when one hears
of the success of Dr. E. P. McCabe, of San Antonio, Texas. Three
years ago he bought five pairs of Splendids and since then has been
breeding them steadily, to such an extent that in spite of having disposed
of quite a few young ones he has at present about seventy. With the
price of Splendids in the United States $500 a pair that means a very
substantial total. But then, of course, Dr. McCabe did have a capital
outlay of some $2,500, with the prospect of a very considerable financial
loss. He is fortunate in that he has some very good breeding pairs. And,
apart from having the " know-how Dr. McCabe is also fortunate in
that he does not have to, and does not expect to, make money out of
his birds.

I have always been particularly interested in waterfowl. Possibly
because I have not had the facilities for keeping them myself and I
have had to admire, and perhaps envy, those owned by others more
favourably situated. I did once have a pair of Sheld-duck. I had been
given to understand that they were non-injurious to plants and, in my
ignorance, I thought they would look attractive walking about the
lawn. Attractive they most certainly were but they had not been
properly pinioned, or perhaps not even pinioned at all, because on the
very first day of arrival the drake took flight and I saw him no more.
The duck remained with me some time, but contrary to what I had
been led to believe she was quite destructive ; consequently, she had
eventually to be sent to another home.
Thus the advent of the Wildfowl Trust Annual Report always gives me
particular pleasure, especially the section devoted to the year's work.
The Sixteenth Report, 1963-64, says : " first breeding records were

WILD AUSTRALIA. By M. K. Morcombe. Published by M. K.
Morcombe, P.O. Box 54. Armadale, Western Australia, 1965.
Price 12s. sterling, including postage and packing.
This publication combines some most beautiful and interesting
photographs of Australian birds and beasts with informative text on
both the subjects of the photographs and the methods by which they
were obtained and a calendar. It can be used as the " usual " sort of
illustrated calendar for a year, then the calendar sheets removed, and
the whole kept to bind as a book with future issues.
As is, unfortunately, usual with colour photography the reproduction
is not faultless, greys especially tending to be too blue. This is, however,
a very minor flaw and should not put anyone off buying it. To those
who have travelled in Australia such colour photographs as that of the
Roseate Cockatoo flying from its nest hollow will evoke vivid memories
and to those that have not will give some idea of the colourful beauty
of some of even the most abundant species in the outback.

THE NEED FOR ANIMAL PROTEIN IN PHEASANTS' DIET
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.985248458333333" page_id="56365922"  page_num="199" year="" vol="">
Having only kept and observed pheasants for four or five years, I am a comparative
novice with this family, and therefore write with some trepidation ! I have, however,
one or two observations which may at least provoke discussion.
The first point I would like to make is that I believe that what I call the " digging "
pheasants, Monals, Crossoptilons, etc., need a great deal of animal food. Though the
text-books indicate that they dig for roots, groundnuts, etc., I think that in reality
their digging is mainly in search for worms, grubs, beetles, and other forms of under-
ground animal protein. My Blue Eared Pheasants go mad for maggots and mealworms
(at great expense !) and will even break up and devour large black garden slugs,
a rather revolting sight but no doubt of great benefit to the birds. They are also very
keen on green food and fruit, and much less interested in grain, seeds and pellets.
Although it is undoubtedly well known to the experts, I think that the average
amateur pheasant enthusiast does not realize how truly omnivorous the family is and
many books on the subject fail to stress this point. Anyone who has kept domestic
poultry or bantams on free range will know how the grain bill drops in the spring and
summer due to the consumption of insects and green food. I suspect that although
in-breeding may be the main cause of infertility in ornamental pheasants, wrong diet
is a strong secondary cause.
I also suspect that the cause of cocks scalping and even killing their hens is also due
to animal protein deficiency. Having drawn blood during their somewhat strenuous
love-making, the cock continues to peck at the wound due to a craving for animal
protein. The fact that this happens very often with Monals, as my friend Mr.
Humphrey of Parbold will confirm, may be additional evidence of this.

I read with interest the article by Mrs. Scamell on her successful breeding of the
White-capped Tanagers. Our pair at Keston this year went to nest but had four
infertile eggs. The interesting point with this pair was that the cock bird did all the
incubating. I never once saw him off the nest; occasionally I saw them sitting side
by side. He may have been a youngish bird for he is much more colourful now he
is through the moult--a deep cobalt blue body colour with an extensive white cap.
They are very finch-like vocally, in habit, temperament, and in a partial seed diet,
so it is not surprising that they share incubation ; although Mrs. Scamell makes no
mention of this concerning her pair.
