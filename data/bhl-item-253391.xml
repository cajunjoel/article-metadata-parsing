BREEDING THE MAURITIUS PINK PIGEON AT JERSEY
ZOOLOGICAL PARK
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.989940857142857" page_id="56283433"  page_num="" year="" vol="">
By David Jeggo (Deputy Curator of Birds)
In June this year two Mauritius Pink Pigeons, Columbi mayeri, were
hatched and reared at Jersey Zoological Park by the same pair that at-
tempted unsuccessfully in 1977 and who still remain in their same accom-
modation.
It was their fourth clutch of the season. The male began to court in
early May and a substantial nest of dried leaves, twigs and strands of
woodwool was constructed on one of the outside platforms. We believe
the first egg was laid on the 16th May as the female was on the nest for
the whole of that day and the next day the male began to share incubation.
As one or two eggs had rolled from the nest and broken, we removed
one of the clutch to foster pigeons.
Both eggs chipped on the 30th May. With the two previous attempts
the newly hatched chick had been left uncovered to die of cold while the
female happily brooded the remaining egg. We hoped that, by leaving
only one egg, the problem might be eliminated.
The next morning the one young one was moving strongly under its
brooding parent. In the afternoon we gave the second young one back
as the foster pigeons had no "milk".
Both progressed well and we watched them develop perfectly, always
one a little more advanced than the other. In the warm afternoon sun of
the third day the chicks covered in yellowish down were left uncovered for a
short time. When 9 days old they were well pin feathered and these were
opening to reveal the chestnut colour of the upper parts, and buff* on the
flanks. In the evening of that day, the 8th of June, the male was displaying,
cooing and bowing to the female. By 11 days old the young were left
unattended for much of the day. The male continued to display and the
pair began to nest again, this time on an inside platform. This had been
modified since they last used it. An oblong frame of 2&amp;quot; x 2&amp;quot; timber had
been fitted into it. If the nest could be confined to the small deep interior
this created, it was hoped there would be less chance of a chick chilling.
The first egg of the fifth clutch was in the nest on the 17th of June and a
second egg was added later. The male carried out normal incubation as
well as most of the feeding of the two young. These were now almost
totally feathered, chestnut upper parts and tail with buffish head and

underparts, legs, feet and bill, darkish brown with a dark brown eye, a
quite distinctive juvenile plumage.
At twenty days both left the nest flying strongly and landing with ac-
curacy, they could return to the nest with no problem and at will. Five
days later, the 24th June, they were going inside and feeding from the
seed bowl and although they still begged from the male they seemed
largely independent. During the rearing period the pigeons changed their
diet little, feeding mainly on seed, particularly wheat. More mashed, hard-
boiled egg sprinkled with Vitetrin was provided than usual and taken,
and a plentiful supply of fresh leafy willow branches was available
at all times. Chopped fruit and vegetables were almost completely ignored.
On the third of July the young were moved to a recently completed
range of aviaries built specifically for the Fink Pigeon breeding programme.
One of the eggs of the sixth clutch unfortunately broke but the other
hatched on the 1st July and this chick was raised successfully. While it
was being reared, the male again began to display. However the female
was not in a correct state to commence another cycle and became in a very
distressed condition from the constant driving of the male. We separated
her while he continued to raise the young one. This was removed at the
end of August and we re-introduced the pair who soon began to nest
again, laying another clutch, the seventh, on the same inside platform
on the 8th September. Both eggs hatched on the 22nd September,
but only one chick survived more than twenty-four hours. At the time of
writing (October) this is thriving and the first two are fast completing
their adult plumage.
There is also encouraging news from the aviaries on Mauritius where
a number have been bred so perhaps we can soon look for a significant
increase in the world population estimated to be only between 30-35 in
1976 .

Chalcopsitta s(c)intillata
By R. T. Kyme (Wyberton, Boston, Lines.)
Starting about 1972 Mrs Stephanie Belford began to import several
aviculturally rare New Guinea parrots. Included amongst these were the
three mainland species of Chalcopsitta: Duyvenbode's C. duivenhodei , the
Black C. atra and the Yellow-streaked. I acquired two Duyvenbode's--
which is another story--and the Yellow-streaked. At the time the Yellow-
streaked appeared to be a true pair: they often mated and were most
different in appearance. The bigger one had more red to the face and more
colour to the body. However, my previous experience with several species,
taught me that the only genus of lory that is sexable from external appear-

ance is Charmosyna. Nevertheless it took me two years to make up my
mind that they were both male: it has been my experience that lories that
have made no attempt to breed after two or, at most, three years are
like-sexed. Two more Yellow-streaked were bought in April 1976 which
the vendor (as is so often the case with brush-tongued parrots) assured me
were a true pair. The pairs were acquainted with one another by housing
them side by side and then, after clipping the tips from the tails to dis-
tinguish them apart, I exchanged one bird from each flight. It was then
immediately obvious that the newcomers were hens and the original "pair"
were male--as suspected.
It was not long before chicks were hatched from both pairs; unfortun-
ately after a few days, with one pair, and three weeks with the other, the
sets of chicks died. It was high summer and the deaths appeared inexplic-
able (on reflection I believe that it may well have been from "chilling"--
being tropical parrots they do not brood too closely--from the faeces-
damp nest-filler). Worse was to follow, for one of the hens was later found
dead. By good fortune the pet-shop-bought replacement proved another
hen. She and her partner became extremely tame. The next year, 1977,
once again I had chicks from both pairs and, again, after a few weeks they
were found dead; to be followed, later, by the older hen. Her mate was
sent off to Pencynor Bird Gardens. Now, iter losing at least six rounds of
youngsters--for the hens laid again after losing the chicks--I had quite
despaired of getting the parents to rear their own young. This year, 1978,
I had firmly decided to hand-rear them or, should the layings coincide,
foster them out with my very successful pair of Dusky Lories Psuedeos
fuscata. However, neither of these stratagems proved necessary, for the
parents raised two, slightly feather-plucked, chicks which left the nest in
late August and early September from eggs laid in the second week in
March. That is 20 weeks, 140 days, or nearly half a year for a complete
nesting cycle. It is assessed that the chicks are still dependent on the
parents for some nourishment and use the nest-chamber as a roost for
some weeks after fledging.
It has been my experience that the male is more aggressive. When the
pair are fed it is the cock who attacks physically although it is both sexes
which utter the high-pitched, deafeningly loud, mobbing calls. While they
shriek they keep the tail flared right out, the wings outstretched and the
long, rather narrow, feathers to the head and neck ferociously bristled.
Yet no matter how fierce they appear, they only too readily lap nectar
from a spoon held, safely, on the other side of the wire while they curse
the feeding hand. Curiously although they hiss in courtship display they
seem not to in aggressive encounters as will, say, American parrots, the
cockatoos and the Cockatiel.
This year the first egg was laid on the 8th May with the second two
days later, and as always the incubation period was 24 days. On hatching,
the chicks are covered with a thin, long, whitish down which is very

sparse over the head and neck. The ear-hole is open. This natal down is
later replaced by a dark grey one preceding feather quills. The rate of
growth is particularly slow. And this despite the youngsters always,
seemingly, having their crops bulging with a nutritionally very rich
nectar food.
This diet consisted of:--

<bodyText confidence="0.991470777777778" page_id="56283436"  page_num="4" year="" vol="">
This is mixed with if pints of hot water. Then 10 drops of Abidec, 6 drops
of Cyatem B 12 and a mustard spoonful of P.Y.M. are added. Bread and
milk was offered and the milk was taken, but the bread was scattered about
in typical lory fashion.
The nest box was kept reasonably dry by adding an occasional handful of
peat; however it eventually became so sodden that a fortnight before they
finally fledged quite a lot of the insanitary nest box filler was removed and
replaced by drier material. This nitrogen-rich compost was found to be
full of maggots (of the housefly ?). The first chick left the nest on the
26th August and the second two days later. They were very different in
appearance from the adults, for the head was completely black and the
belly had only a slight indication of yellow streaking. The legs were jet
black contrasting with the dark grey of the older birds and the periorbital
skin was white--in the parents it is black. Within a few days the chicks
were feeding themselves and the parents are, even now, extremely pro-
tective towards them.
As described the Yellow-streaked Lory Chalcopsitta sintillata (or
scintillata ) has been bred by Mr R. T. Kyme and this is believed to be the
first success in this country, but anyone knowing of another is asked to
inform the Hon. Secretary.
Note
When Mr Kyme's paper was received, he was asked whether the diet
of the lories included fruit, but as no reply had arrived at the time of
sending the copy to press, it was concluded that no fruit was given.
We have since heard from him that in addition to the diet listed, the
birds are offered grapes, orange, apple, pomegranate, raisins, berries of
rowan and such vegetables as beetroot and spinach.---Ed.

A SEMI-ALBINO SNOW GOOSE
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.942088058823529" page_id="56283439"  page_num="5" year="" vol="">
Prof. S. Dillon Ripley (U.S.A.)
In late June, 1978, among a hatching of young wild geese at our farm
in Litchfield, Connecticut, I was interested to note one gosling which
seemed small and particularly pale in downy plumage, with a faint yellowish
suffusion to the tips of the down. Particularly on the neck this suffusion
was strong enough to give the impression of a downy Peking (domestic)
duckling.
The bill and legs of the gosling were also pale, a light greyish yellow,
pale enough to give me the impression that our hatchling was a Ross's
Goose Anser rossii , of the pale yellowish-white phenotype.
In a few weeks as normal growth progressed it became apparent that
our pale gosling was a young Snow Goose Anser caerulescens caerulescens.
As feathers replaced the down, the bird became noticeably different from
its siblings of the year. The last pale yellowish down to be replaced by
feathers was in the neck area (as well of course as the less visible back and
rump, which was covered with purer whitish down), Feathered out, this
bird, a male, appeared surprisingly different in colour!

<listItem confidence="0.835331" page_id="56283439"  page_num="5" year="" vol="">
(a) Bill and feet paled to pink. At eight weeks this colour was similar
to the adult Snow Goose in contrast to the blackish-grey bill and feet
of the normal juvenile. The iris was pale blue, not brownish, and also not
pink or reddish, as might have been the case with an albino.
(b) The plumage was white throughout, totally lacking the greyish-
brown suffusion, especially to the upper parts characterised by juvenile
Snow Geese.
(c) Uniquely, the primaries in the juvenile feathering moulted out

pure white.
From the above it seems apparent that this individual represents an
undescribed white "morph" of this species. I can find no listing of such
a plumage in the literature. The most recent, and rather comprehensive
reference to Snow Goose species plumage is in Ralph S. Palmer (1976)
HANDBOOK of north American birds, Volume 2, pages 123-127. (Yale
University Press, New Haven and London.) who mentions; "Aberrant
individuals reported include entirely white Lesser Snows" in the wild,
without further characterization.
I hope to breed this individual to normal Lesser Snow Geese to deter-
mine if this is a strain which will persist genetically as in the "silver"
Bahama or White-cheeked Pintail Anas bahamensis which occurs among
captive populations, especially in Europe.

BREEDING AND HAND-REARING THE RED-LEGGED
HONEYCREEPER
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.980061952380952" page_id="56283440"  page_num="6" year="" vol="">
By Les Gibson, (Burnaby, British Columbia, Canada)
Cyanerpes cyaneus is known variously as the Red-legged Honeycreeper,
Yellow-winged Honeycreeper, or with the term honeycreeper replaced
by sugarbird. The names are not very useful. It does not creep, it hops,
and the yellow is only under the wings of the male, where it is scarcely
visible. Suggestions for a better name are welcome. The sexes are dimor-
phic and the cock in breeding plumage is like a giant Morpho butterfly.
The hen is not unattractive, as the species is of an interesting shape.
They are good aviary birds as they fly about constantly and never skulk
in the foliage and they are bold and unafraid in the presence of other birds
or people. They never interfere with other birds and will live with others
of the species when not breeding.
The following is an account of the nesting of this species and, for
reasons that will be explained later, the attempted hand-rearing of two
chicks.
References to birds in the wild are taken from "Life Histories of Central
American Birds" (Pacific Coast Avifauna no. 31) by Alexander Skutch.
This patient and astute observer of birds originally went to Central
America as a botanist, but finally settled there to complete these works
over a period of nearly 20 years. Unfortunately the books are out of print,
but anyone who keeps any bird found in Central America should en-
deavour to read them.
This species ranges from South Mexico to South Brazil, and into the
Caribbean. The nominate race comes from Trinidad and there are several
very similar subspecies. The main habitat is lowland tropical rain-forest,
or more open plantation country where there are large stands of tall trees
at frequent intervals, for the Honeycreeper is arboreal, foraging well up
in the trees. They travel far in small flocks when not breeding and may
move around after food supplies.
Like other arboreal birds they bathe in the treetops in wet leaves, or in
rain. My birds did the same whenever the plants were being sprayed.
Otherwise the only time they were ever on the ground was to bathe in
the water dish. In cold weather they did not bathe at all, but usually
kept their beaks clean by wetting them, then wiping them on a twig.
Background
The pair of birds under study were two of six birds (4m 3f) obtained
in June 1976. One cock was not too bad, the other five and especially the
hens, were in shocking condition. This was because the wholesaler had
had them for some time because of--believe it or not--"lack of demand".
They had frayed, dried feathers completely glued to the body by nectar,
to the extent that none could fly over 1#&apos; (Jm). A good wash was followed
by drying with a hair blow-drier. The latter is an indispensable piece of

equipment in my aviary. This produced much more comfortable birds,
but they could fly no better because of the poor feathering. The exception
was the present cock, who could get around quite well.
Two cocks died within a month. One had a crippled foot on acquisition
and an abscess on this yielded a pure culture of the yeast Candida albicans.
This is unlikely to have been directly connected with the death. The other
had a bloated abdomen (like peritonitis) but for some reason it was not
examined. The four cocks were all in full colour when obtained.
The two hens had been in the worst condition. Neither could flap at all.
One had a dropped wing and the other was completely threadbare.
Within two months the good cock moulted well, out of colour, and in
another month the threadbare hen also moulted well. These two could
then fly normally and are the pair in this account.
The hen with the injured wing did not moult and showed signs of
senility. It could no longer sit on a perch and it shook much of the time. It
was put in a small cage without perches where it walked to its food by using
its good wing as a crutch. It began to tremble permanently and yet it still
managed to eat by using its wing as a support. It usually fell into the nectar
and eventually it had to be bathed at least once a day. Remarkably it
went on like this for three months and it was in such a pathetic state that
euthanasia was administered with great reluctance on my part, and no
doubt on its part too! After such a length of time like that the chances of
it recovering were nil. Two weeks later, in the middle of December, the
cock which had not moulted died in full colour. It had started to show
signs of unsteadiness like the hen and had been swaying at the feeding
dish for the previous two weeks. It was very thin at io.5g. The other two
cocks weighed 14 and 15.25^, and the senile hen weighed X2"6g. The
remaining pair moulted beautifully again in March, the cock coming
into full colour. The birds had overwintered in a frost-free conservatory
where they had remained for two years until this account was written.
The cock weighed 15.yg at the time of writing.
Housing
The accommodation was a lean-to conservatory, built against the south
side of the house and covering two of the house windows. It measures
18 x 9 x 10 feet high (3 x 2.7 x 5.4m) and is made of clear acrylic sheeting.
It is only heated to the extent that it is not allowed to drop below freezing
point in the winter. It is poorly ventilated (to conserve heat) and con-
sequently is always very humid. The dense vegetation gives a tropical rain
forest appearance with masses of vines on the walls and under the roof.
Flowers are poorly represented because of the heavy shade. It gets very
hot in the upper air layers in summer, and may get quite warm from
solar radiation on sunny windless days in winter, (e.g. over y2 0 F-22 0 C).
It is usually always below 40 F (5*C) in January and February and this
did not upset the cyaneus s nor the pair of Zosterops which shared the

accommodation. Four Red and White Rails ( Laterallus leucopyrrhus )
wintered there also. The only luxury allowed the birds was that their
nectar and rice pudding was warmed on very cold mornings.
Temperatures were monitored by a maximum/minimum thermometer,
visible from inside the house, plus another outdoor-indoor thermometer
at the other end of the aviary.

Four of the Cyanerpes originally moulted well on a diet of banana
and milk-nectar only. This latter was made from equal parts of milk
and water, to which 2 teaspoons of honey were added per xooml. of
liquid. Occasionally both honey and sugar were used. No difference in
the birds was noted, so sugar is mostly used now because of its convenience.
This has been stepped up to 4-6 teaspoons of sugar in the same volume.
The Honeycreeper loves banana, which it slices off with a sideways,
scissor-like action of the bill. Skutch noted that the favourite food of
wild birds at his feeder was banana. In spite of the rather specialised-
looking bill, wild birds take a wide variety of foods including fruits and
berries, small insects and, of course, nectar from flowers. They often hang
head-down to pick insects from the underside of leaves or to probe
flowers.
In the aviary, the Cyanerpes sampled a wide variety of fruits and
berries but none became a regular part of the diet like banana. Food
must be soft and/or in small pieces. Mealworms are normally ignored.
Small spiders and caterpillars are taken. Occasionally they hawk fruit
flies ( Drosophila ), but aphids and other very small insects (smaller than
fruit flies) are apparently too small. Small ants, which swarmed over
sweet food and bloated their abdomens with nectar, were neither used
for food nor for anting.
In the second year, rice pudding was added to the menu of all my birds,
mainly for the Chloropsis. The Cyanerpes immediately put this somewhat
ahead of banana as their staple, and these two foods almost exclusively
supply all their needs. The milk nectar is still drunk copiously with a
rapid pumping action, without lifting the head. The nectar adds nothing
nutritionally over the rice, as the latter is made with equal parts of rice and
sugar, covered with milk and simmered for about an hour until soft.
Rice absorbs about twice its volume of liquid, so be sure and add more
milk during cooking. Use long grain white rice.
These birds appear to be physiologically adapted to nectar con-
sumption, and I certainly would not try and keep them without it. The
amount of nectar consumed goes up a bit in hot weather, and there is a
noticeable increase in cold weather. Milk is still added as it is advantageous
to other birds that do not eat the rice. Nearly all my birds drink some.
There is a drawback to the milk in that it goes sour more quickly but
there is an advantage in that you can see when it needs to be changed.

50/50 milk and water was originally used as I had suspected that birds
may not be able to cope with lactose (milk sugar). They can't but it
takes 4% (dry weight) in the diet to cause trouble. However the formula
was kept at this as it does not sour as quickly as whole milk. Nothing is
measured accurately and the proportions vary from day to day. The sugar
content was increased and it is now anywhere from 15-25% (usually 15-16%).
Some of the low percentages of sugar in nectar are quite ridiculous. It
must be particularly hard on humming birds as they would have to
drink so much to get any calories. Humming birds in my garden are fed
a 30-50% sugar solution. Flower nectar can be up to 75% sugars, and
bees won't even collect it below about 18% as they are expending more
energy than it returns.
Nectar is fed in cup-sized glass bowls, which are easy to clean. Drip-
type containers do just that---they drip, and are a messy, wasteful nuisance.
An additional hazard is that fungus grows rampantly on nectar stains.
The hen changed her diet at only one point--just before laying. She
then began to eat mealworms frantically, and this is a good indication
that laying is imminent. A few mealworms were put out daily the year
round for the Zosterops, and except at the above point, the Cyanerpes
never touched them. The hen also ate some scrambled egg as well as
any small insects that could be supplied, such as spiders and wasp grubs.
As soon as the eggs were laid, she went back to her normal diet. The
cock remained conservative throughout this period and ate only the
original diet. The feeding of chicks will be detailed later.
Cyanerpes cyaneus can be kept in excellent condition, and moulted,
on the simplest of diets. Their food can be kept in the refrigerator for
several days until needed. Rice pudding should be tasted after about
three days for sourness before serving. Often it will smell alright but
taste sour. Scrambled egg that has gone off is readily detected by the
smell. None of the foodstuffs should be left with the birds for more than
one day. All the food items were fed ad. lib. No vitamin supplements were
added to their nectar or other foods.
Calls and behaviour
This species has an extremely limited vocal range. The normal call
heard throughout the year, and much more so in the breeding season, is a
harsh nasal "chaa" (as described by Skutch, and I can think of no better
description). This 'chaa' is used by both sexes, the male being more vocal.
The male also has a quiet whistled 'chip'. I could find no record of a
song in the literature and was unaware of any but, amazingly, after having
had the birds for two years, I recently heard the cock singing. He had, in
fact, been singing all along when in breeding plumage. The song was
so quiet it could not be heard outside of the aviary. It was not unlike the
slightly louder warble of the Zosterops which could just be heard outside,
and for this reason it had been missed. When working inside the conserva-

<bodyText confidence="0.999784363636364" page_id="56283444"  page_num="10" year="" vol="">
tory with the cock Cyanerpes being the only bird present I was able to
confirm that he was singing. It is difficult to transliterate, but the song,
such as it was, was a short, not unpleasant warble, consisting of a short
note whistled twice quickly then a longer ascending note, followed by a
rapid double note, repeated five times. This sequence was repeated at
infrequent intervals with no variation. It was so quiet that I was unable
to record it on my poor quality equipment, from the other end of the
aviary. He sang on and off all day for a week after the hen escaped, then
stopped when cool, dull weather arrived.
The 'chaa' is used by both birds when showing aggression, usually to
each other, and occasionally towards the Zosterops, who were unimpressed.
The same note is more frequently used during the mating period and it
is difficult to see where the aggression stopped and the passion began.
The birds continually insulted and threatened each other and mating
was interspersed with chasing and fighting to the extent that they were
often rolling on the ground. The cock got the upperhand in these battles
until the eggs were laid. Then he suffered to the extent that he became
wary of approaching the nest as he was often literally beaten to the ground.
The aggressive posture used at the feeding dish and also in courtship
consisted of the bird crouching with the head drawn into the shoulders
and the beak pointing straight up, accompanied by the endless # chaa-chaa\
In retrospect, I now know that the cock serenaded the hen, practically
in her ear, in the manner of Australian finches. The cock moulted in
March into his breeding plumage and stayed in colour for exactly six
months, moulting to a green colour in September. He lost only the body
feathers twice a year. The black wing and tail feather were only moulted
once in autumn and these readily distinguished him from the hen. The
hen followed the same pattern but remained green the year round.
After turning blue, the cock stepped up his pursuit, culminating in a
nesting attempt in the first week in July. The summer had been hot and
dry since May. The first indication of the nesting was that the hen sud-
denly began eating mealworms, which had been put in for the Zosterops
(who were also nesting). The long beak has poor pecking capability and
she took from 5-8 minutes to soften up a large mealworm before consuming
it. After a few days of this, she began to carry very fine strands unwound
from coarse string, or strands of horsehair, and look for a place to put them.
She was very fussy and tried many spots. Finally a loose network base was
laid in a honeysuckle at a height of 5Jft (1.65m). The weather turned dull
and wet and the work was abandoned. After two weeks, when it got
sunny and hot again, the whole process starting with the mealworms was
recommenced. The cock flew about after her, watching all this and calling
incessantly. She had even more difficulty in choosing a second spot,
trying one place after another. This took two to three days, after placing
strands of building material in at least 4 sites.

Nesting
The nest was finally built in 2 days, at a height of yjft (2.25m) in a jasmine
vine, directly above the water dish and, most conveniently, only 18 inches
(46 cm) from the kitchen window. Here I am most indebted to Skutch's
observations. He noted that building in the wild commenced with the
collection of large amounts of cobweb. This had not been supplied last
year when a halfhearted attempt at breeding was made. Nor was it sup-
plied when the nest base was built two weeks earlier. In the interval I
read the report on the spiders' webs. This was supplied and the very
minute it was put in, the hen began to collect it. Even more dramatic
was its effect on the Zosterops, who both dived in, literally, head first
and carried much of it off. In view of the reaction of these birds it would
be worth making spiders' webs available to a variety of species. It would
almost certainly prevent disintegrating nests. I have had this problem
with Zosterops and particularly with Pekin Robins. The cobweb was
supplied more easily than might be imagined. First I tried to pick up a
whole web from corners in the garden shed, in a v-shaped stick. This was
then transferred to plants in the aviary. The collection was soon simplified
by taking a large umbelliferous weed flower-head, cutting the flowers off
to leave a network of stems, and leaving it to dry and thus stiffen. Webs
were then collected by simply rolling them up with the plant until it
looked like a candy floss stick. The crawlspace under the house provided
all the cobwebs needed and there I found many spiders apparently living
well on escaped mealworm beetles, (I had been telling my wife for years
that beetles "can't escape from a plastic container".) The flower head was
stuck in a Hoya vine in the aviary and the hen Cycmerpes and the Zosterops
had it cleaned off in minutes.
It could be argued that the hen stopped building and re-started because
of the weather. But last year the pair were both in excellent shape and
circumstances were identical, apart from the absence of cobwebs. Also
the reaction of the hen was immediate. She was literally down within
seconds to gather the webs. I feel sure that the base she constructed two
weeks earlier was abandoned because of its lack of proper anchorage.
She did not commence with the base this time as there was no bottom
support. The nest was slung from the rim at two points, not quite op-
posite, on stems of jasmine. A very open but firm outline was made by
first sticking the anchor threads down with cobweb while she worked
them around the stems. The anchors were of fine grass and fine strands
from nylon string. A horsehair network was attached to these using
cobweb and weaving, then a base of fine grasses was added. The hen
sat inside and built the wall around herself. The wall was an open lace
network of horsehair reinforced with fine grass. There were many spaces
through the sides and it looked as though it was designed for a hot cli-
mate. The final result was a securely anchored structure with open
network sides and a thicker base. The inside diameter was 2 inches

(5.25cm) and the inside depth was ij inches (3cm) making this a very
shallow nest. The base added a further  |inch (1.5cm) to the overall
depth. In comparison the Zosterops' nest was as deep as it was wide.
Unlike nests from some other birds, there was no danger of the
Cyanerpes nest coming apart. The cock took no part at all in building.
Incubation and eggs
The day after the nest was completed the first egg was laid. Observations
of wild birds showed only a clutch of two. However, this bird laid 3 eggs.
The egg is greenish white with purple-brown markings which are heavier
from the middle to the big end. The hatched shell is white, the yolk
evidently accounting for the greenish hue. One egg measured 17 x 14.5mm.
All 3 were fertile but one did not develop past about 8-9 days. The two
eggs hatched on successive days, at 13 days incubation for each. The hen
was a good sitter and the nest was examined daily when she was off.
She was off a lot because it was very hot and the cock did not feed her.
In comparison, the Zosterops hen which had one fledged chick at this
time, was hardly ever off as the cock fed her on the nest. Two days after
the Cyanerpes laid the Zosterops laid again. They were about to be re-
moved as they were pilfering nesting material from the Honeycreepers'
nest in the absence of the hen. The cock Cyanerpes made no effort to
stop them in spite of being double the weight of a Zosterops. This robbing
was only when there were no eggs in the nest. It was stopped by plastering
lots of grass and horsehair around the Cyanerpes nest and, finally, when
the hen Cyanerpes was sitting, the Zosterops stayed away. I made it a
practice to be working in the greenhouse all the year round so that all
the birds were used to my presence. This made examination of the nest
easy and the hen would come off the eggs to feed and go back on while I
trimmed the vines etc. Whenever I hosed the place (to keep the heat
down) she would return to cover the eggs at the first sprinkle, if she had
been off. The temperature was in the mid nineties *F (mid thirties *C)
during the day throughout the incubation and the hen was off frequently.
The cock did not incubate, but sat throughout the whole period on the
same perch nearby. If the hen came off he followed her like a shadow.
If he came too near the nest, or annoyed her by sticking too close, she
often beat him. In view of the cock's lack of effort at protecting the nest
from the Zosterops, I can only presume that he was standing on guard to
prevent the intrusion of another cock, or another pair of Cyanerpes.
Indeed he often spent many minutes on end flying at his own reflection
in a window, prior to the nesting.
Chicks
The dark grey chicks had a few wisps of grey down. The very first feed
they received (from the hen) was the rice pudding. Later they were fed
banana. This was a great relief as the hen was not going to depend solely
on live-food. She also brought a few fruit flies. Wasp grubs and mealworms

were not used. On the second day small spiders and any small soft insect
was used in addition to the rice and banana. Only the hen fed the chicks,
which could be heard cheeping when only a few hours old. The cock
became very excited when the chicks hatched and he hung upside down
above the nest with large billfulls of rice or banana. This food was con-
stantly proffered and eventually taken by the hen who gave very small
pieces to the chicks. The cock had never previously offered food to the
lien, either at courtship or during incubation. He never went to the nest
when the hen was off and was always nervous when approaching. He
always arrived circuitously, a twig at a time. In contrast, the hen just flew
straight on to the nest. My relief at the hen feeding her normal diet was
short-lived. When the first chick was two days old (and the other only one)
she came into the kitchen through the open window when I was putting
out food. The feeding station was a platform just outside the window. I
had been doing this for two years without a problem. But she was looking
for insects and was quite unafraid. She hopped along the sink then, in
spite of being in a very enclosed area, she bounced off my shoulder, went
downwards under some wall cabinets, went out to an enclosed sundeck,
into a narrow passage and out into the garden--no easy feat, involving
the turning of four corners.
She landed in a cherry tree just outside of the aviary and immediately
began to collect insects. She hung upside down and poked under the
broad leaves and, within a few minutes, had 5 or 6 insects lined up in
her beak. I had walked behind her by this time and she actually flew
down to a fence post within 6ft (2m) of me, and I could clearly see the
insects she had gathered. I was hopeful that she would go back into the
passageway. Next she flew higher into an apple tree and had a look
around. Moments later she was off fast and straight over a house, at a
height of about 30ft (9m). She has not been seen since.
The chicks were obviously comfortable in the 95*F (35*C) heat, so I
left them. The cock came a few times with large offerings of food and
jabbed them at the chicks who almost choked. He even brought a meal-
worm which they could not take, so he finally ate it--the first time I
saw him eat one.
He was very nervous at the nest and never once landed on the rim,
always hanging from above and looking around nervously for the hen.
The chicks were hand-fed in the nest. They begged promptly when
the nest was thumped with a finger. At night they were put in a nest of
tissue inside a small portable incubator at 97-98^ (36-37*C), and spent
the night safely. They were cheeping at first light and were hand-fed
5-6 times an hour, for a 15 hour day. It remained hot and they were put
back in the nest for eight hours each day, at 91-95*? (33-35*C). The
cock repeated his useless performance for 5 days and on the sixth day he
did not go near the nest at all. He is obviously programmed solely to the hen.
The chicks were kept at 93-95*F (34-35 *C) each night, and as the

days wore on, I wore out. By the sixth day, (time being counted by the
oldest chick), feedings were being given at about 4 an hour.
From day one to day four the chicks only excreted at between 7 and
17 hour intervals, (the latter including night time). This was disconcerting
at first, until it was found to be apparently normal. The cock had removed
droppings from the nest since the chicks were born until he lost interest
on the sixth day.
The chicks were kept indoors when it was obvious that the cock was
of no help. They grew at a tremendous pace, but when the younger was
five days old, it did not beg first thing in the morning like the elder chick.
It was breathing noticeably faster and this was timed at i3o/minute,
compared with the larger chick at 100/min. An infection was thought
to be the most likely cause of distress (correctly as it turned out) and the
chick was given cephalexin. This oral cephalosporin was given as a few
specks of powder on a tooth pick, washed down with nectar. The chick
was force-fed all day and at night was given Septra (sulpha and trime-
thoprim), an antibiotic with a 12 hour effect. The next morning, at 7 a.m.,
it begged weakly and took a feed. At 9 a.m. it threw up its food and did
the same again at 9.30. This is usually a terminal sign in all birds, young
and old. It died at 10 a.m., in its seventh day from hatching, 6 days old in
24hr. periods. I always count day one as the day following hatching.
The other chick continued to beg and feed, but not quite so vigorously
as on the previous day. In the afternoon it was breathing at 110/min.
Suddenly between 9 and 10 p.m. its breathing went up to 140/min. and
at 10 p.m. it coughed up its previous feed. It was given a dose of Chlor-
amphenicol, but died at 5 a.m. the following morning at 8 days. Its eyes
would have opened within 2 days. Its wing feathers were the only feathers
present and they had just burst out of the quills on the seventh day,
having grown from 12.5 to 15mm on that day.
The youngest chick weighed 3-9g, and on the same day the elder
chick weighed 5.3g, about a third of the adult weight. On the day the
latter died it had lost almost half a gram. Both chicks had a shrivelled,
dehydrated appearance just before death. An immediate postmortem
on the young chick revealed a septicaemia caused by the bacteria Enter 0-
bacter cloacae , a common inhabitant of the mammalian gut and one that
may be found in the intestine of omnivorous softbiils. The chick was
examined within an hour of death.
The larger chick had no obvious infection or other identifiable cause
of death. The decision on whether or not to give the larger chick anti-
biotics was an agonising one, and this was made even worse by the negative
findings. It is possible that the chloramphenicol did wipe out infecting
bacteria, and the chick could have died from endotoxins released from
dead bacteria.
The chicks were fed for the first few days on a pulp made from beef
or chicken, mixed with an equal volume of rice pudding, mashed in a

blender. Scrambled egg was mashed in later. The chicks had very small
throats and the feed was given from a toothpick. The toothpick was held
in place to support the head in an upright position, while the chick
slowly gulped the pulp. The hen supported the chicks in a similar manner.
The main problem was food being too tacky. Later wasp grubs were used
as a staple and they proved to be ideal. They were first cut up, being
too large, and the pulpy mass was gathered upon a toothpick. The chicks
were able to swallow this quickly. At a week old they could still only
swallow small pieces of food that would easily have been taken by a 2-3
day old Pekin Robin. Small spiders under 2mm were readily swallowed.
Nearly every feed was washed down by a drop of nectar. When the chicks
got sick they had obvious difficulty in swallowing. Food was given at
room temperature or somewhat colder (having been refrigerated) except
for the first day when it was heated. There were no particular colours
in the gape, other than a bright red tongue. The tongue was used to push
backwards and pump the food, a little at a time, down the throat, and
they were in constant danger of choking from the large, infrequent feeds.
By contrast the mother was feeding minute amounts every 3-4 minutes
(the chicks were younger, of course).
When only 1 and 2 days old, the chicks begged easily to many stimuli.
The main one was a bang on the nest. They also responded to a light being
flashed on them (if in the dark), and to a variety of chirps and whistles.
They responded steadily to a little whistle that I had not heard the parents
make and it was then that I suspected that one or other parent could
whistle, at least quietly. As the chicks reached 4 days they usually responded
only the first time to banging the nest, and two toothpicks were held
ready to catch them as they were apparently incapable of holding up for
long. However, as they got older it appeared that they were unwilling to
hold up in the absence of a parent bird. The older chick could actually
be seen listening intently for a verbal sign. A little experimentation showed
that a high-pitched kissing noise brought them up most times. The chicks
could literally be seen to grow each day, and in a week the birth weight
had quadrupled.
This species reversed my usual finding that soft-bills are easy to nest,
but difficult to rear. The Cyanerpes need more specialised conditions
than most to induce nesting, but I am sure that the mother would have
raised the chicks easily as she was not depending solely on live food.
The experience with the senile hen and the chicks shows a species that
is more tenacious of life than almost any bird I have dealt with.
Getting the chicks to a week old and losing them added further despair
on top of the loss of the hen, and this has (so far) been the ultimate frustra-
tion in a frustrating hobby.
I am unlikely to be able to replace the hen, as the supply is non-existent
here, and as far as I know I have the only (captive!) Red-legged Honey-
creeper in the country. It's just as well the bird doesn't know this.

The Red-headed or Chestnut-crowned Laughing Thrush Garrulax
erythrocephalus is a medium sized babbler ranging in distribution from
the western Himalayas through S.W. China to S.E. Asia. Coloration is
variable, but briefly it is a mainly greyish bird with chestnut crown and
golden olive wings and tail. Sexes alike. For a more detailed description
with plate see King, Dickinson and Woodcock (1975).
Two birds obtained in January 1970 were housed in a planted aviary
for over six years during which time nests were built and eggs laid.
Nothing came of their efforts, so in September 1976, the two, along with a
third, were introduced into a large planted flight measuring 13 x 9 x 4m
high. A large apple tree dominated a third of the cage with bamboo,
Forsythia, red currant and ivy providing low cover. Despite having to
share the flight with some ten other birds, they settled quickly into their
new environment, spending much time busying themselves turning over
leaves and stones in search of insects and soon gained confidence enough
to snap up any unearthed livefood as the ground was turned.
Half-hearted attempts were made during the following January and
February by individuals at nest construction, but as none had apparently
paired, structures rarely developed beyond the preliminary few strands
of grass. Nest building started in earnest on 9th April when all three
assisted in forming a base seven feet up in a clump of bamboo, part of
which was tied around a steel support and apple branch giving it additional
strength. Progress was slow due to inclement weather but a bulky nest
of dried grass was ready for lining by the 16th. Apart from the base, the
remainder had been built by a pair consisting of an original male and new
female. The female alone lined the cup with lambs' wool and leaf skele-
tons. She roosted on the nest on the 19th and a pale blue egg was present
next day. However, no interest was shown in it, and it was removed
two days later and placed in an incubator. It measured 30.5 x 20mm and
although fertile, proved dead in shell.
A second nest was started a week later, this time in ivy and built only
by the pair who were now spending much more time together while the
odd bird remained alone, neither attempting to assist or interfere. Interest
soon waned and the half-completed nest abandoned, only to have them
start repairing their original nest almost immediately, making the cup
much more shallow. The first egg was laid on 9th May followed by a
second next day. Incubation proceeded normally with both sexes sharing
the duties and after 14 days, one hatched. Brooding was continuous by
the female but the male was not seen to take food up to her; consequently
late evening she came off and amid excited chatterings by all three, the
pair mated beneath the nest. Half an hour lapsed and with no sign of

her returning, the then cold chick and remaining egg were removed to
an incubator. The second egg hatched overnight but both chicks survived
for only two days. Several more attempts were made during the remainder
of the summer but none progressed further than eggs.
During winter, the odd bird died leaving last year's pair together.
Although both birds had been seen carrying dried grass throughout the
winter months it was not until 10th March that an almost complete nest
was noticed in some thick ivy which, due to the unpredictable weather,
took another three days to complete. It was positioned next to the wire
and was clearly visible from outside. The first egg was laid on ist April
followed by two others at daily intervals (previous clutches had consisted of
only two eggs.) Sitting commenced with the first egg and after a period of
15 days, one hatched, followed by the other two on subsequent days. No
shell was found but the male was seen on edge of nest with a piece in
his beak; whether this was eaten or removed was not determined.
Both parents took turns to brood and feed the chicks with the female
doing the bulk of the brooding. Livefood in the form of crickets, maggots
and mealworms was offered and flies and earthworms were found within
the flight by the parents, each being meticulously killed before taken
up to the brooding bird who in turn fed the chicks. Only one chick was
present on the 20th. It continued to grow rapidly and was first left un-
attended on 1 st May when both parents spent much time chasing flies
attracted to the flowering red currants.
Finally left the nest around 10 a.m. on the 7th after being perched
for an hour or so on the edge, which meant the fledging time was between
19 and 21 days, depending on the day hatched. The weather preceding
was overcast and rainy, so I suspect fledging was delayed as it is with other
softbills reared at the gardens in such weather and would estimate that 16
or 17 days would be nearer the correct time, but as we only reared one, it
remains to be seen what the fledging period is when fine conditions prevail.
On leaving the nest, the chick was about two-thirds the size of adults
with uniform grey brown plumage and very short tail. Spending most of
the first few days on or near the ground, it soon began to hop confidently
and was following its parents around within a week. First started to pick
up at five weeks old, progressively accepting less until independent a
week later.

THE BAHAMAN PARROT
Amazona leucocephala bahamensis
By Patricia and Clarke Carraway (Seffner, Florida)
Introduction by Ramon Noegel
Patricia and Clarke Carraway are members of our staff here at Life
Fellowship (New Age Ranch) in Florida. They have long shared an interest

and concern for the plight of endangered wild life, and in the past seven
years they have spent much time in the Cayman Islands and Jamaica
studying the habits of the native Amazon parrots to aid in the captive
breeding programme of the New Age Ranch. Such expeditions were
solely sponsored by the New Age Assembly Church which is actively
engaged in conservation of endangered species. When I approached them
with the possibility of going to the Bahamas to research bahamensis , their
enthusiasm was overwhelming. Coupled with youth, education and a drive
to succeed, they have greatly added to our knowledge of these rare parrots,
for they brought back much information not heretofore assembled. At
present we are endeavouring to captive-breed six of the Caribbean Island
Amazons (Amazona leucocephala leucocephala , A.l. caymanensis , A.l.
hesterna , A. agilis , A. collaria and A. ventralis). Our successes with the very
rare Cayman and Cuban Amazons have made this costly but noble effort
well worthwhile. Only those who have spent considerable time in the
Islands can appreciate the urgency of our message regarding the increased
effort for captive breeding. On islands, some of which are so small one can
walk from end to end in half a day, it is only a matter of time before
increased human development wipes out the natural habitat of these
beautiful parrots. While smaller birds may adjust to living in close proxi-
mity to man, the parrot cannot and will not. Some well meaning conser-
vationists still share the dream of a safe natural environment for the
Island Amazon parrots, but without years of education (which may
well prove too late) there is little hope for such dreams becoming realities.
On these small land masses the people must resort to clearing the parrots'
habitat for their homes and plantations. As tourism develops along the
coastline, the local inhabitants are forced inland for cheaper land to build
on. It is foolish to think that people so acquainted with extreme poverty
and who have had little or no instruction in conservation are going to put
the parrots ahead of their own necessity to exist. Therefore, captive breed-
ing still remains the only solution to the immediate problem. In the future,
where the islands are large enough, we may see areas set aside for natural
refuges for the native fauna. If such a time should hopefully come, the
New Age Ranch will be only too happy to supply breeding stock to these

depleted areas. At present we are the only ones ever to have captive-bred
the Grand Cayman Island Amazon and the only ones to be currently
breeding the Cuban Parrot in the U.S., the only other present captive
breeding of the species being in the Moscow Zoo.
Our first encounter with the Bahaman Parrot was in Chicago on a cold,
snowy, windy day in November of 1975. There, in Fields Museum of
Natural History, in the upper archives away from public displays, were
three trays of Bahaman Parrots among hundreds of trays containing
specimens of other birds. What once were parrots is closer to the truth,
for though still in excellent condition, these were but skins of specimens
collected by the Field Expedition at the turn of the century. We would like
to thank the dedicated people of Fields Museum for their help and interest
in our search for information on this parrot.
The next real chance to see our Bahaman friend came in July of 1977.
At the end of the breeding season at the New Age Ranch, a private,
non-profit zoological organization dedicated to the breeding of rare and
endangered birds, our friend and director of the Ranch, Ramon Noegel,
suggested that my wife and I go to Abaco, Bahamas. There we would
observe and photograph the reportedly largest, most beautiful of Amazona
leucocephala, the Bahaman parrot. Ramon decided to remain at the ranch
to keep things running smoothly and ensure its continued success. He
would have his hands full, for many parrots had already hatched: he had
taken them from the nests and begun feeding a special formula while
hand-raising them. Others were due to hatch and would be occupying his
attention also.
Once on Abaco, we began inquiring for local knowledge of the existence
and habits of the parrot. We were given many enthusiastic confirmations
of the existence of them on the island, but few people seemed to know
much more. We soon found out that a law had been passed ten years ago
by the Bahaman government to protect the parrots. It is now unlawful to
kill, harm or capture them for any reason with a punishment of a $1,000
fine for violation of the law. From the response of the people we met on
Abaco, it became clear that this action was approved of and adhered to by
most Bahamans.
In the Cayman Islands, where Amazona leucocephala caymanensis and
A.l. hesterna are found, such an attitude of concern for the preservation or
protection does not appear to prevail. Rather, the parrots of Grand Cayman
and Cayman Brae are, for the most part, thought to be a nuisance and pest,
and are treated likewise. Both of these islands are considerably smaller
than Abaco, and the parrots on these smaller islands are in much closer
proximity to people, towns and plantations. With this in mind, the
Bahaman parrot is in a better position to survive in the native state than
either caymanensis or hesterna, at least for the time being.
We encountered only four captive Bahaman parrots on Abaco, all of
which were taken from the nest as babies 11 and 12 years ago. We were

allowed to photograph and handle these four, which seemed to us like the
fulfillment of a dream, for now we had come into personal contact with all
of the Amazona leucocephala subspecies. Months of field work in each of
the Cayman islands and now the Bahamas, coupled with years spent in
study, breeding and raising of the nominate races, caymanensis and
hesterna , all made it more keenly appreciated in finally meeting bahamensis.
At first sight, it might be mistaken for the true Cuban, with the same
striking colours and patterns. However, upon closer examination this
view soon changes, for the Bahaman, though equally as proportioned as
the Cuban and hesterna , is distinctly larger than any of the others. Inci-
dentally an excellent coloured plate by H. Goodchild of the Bahaman
Parrot was published in the June 1904 number of the Magazine.
Although each of the subspecies has the same basic colour patterns,
including blue flight feathers and red in the tail feathers, each of them is
distinctly different from the others. Through observing the Bahaman
parrot, in cages and in the wild, we found that what sets this subspecies
apart as the most beautiful of leucocephala is the amount and intensity of
the red and white patches, the amount of black edging on the green
feathers and the size of the bird compared to the others. Not only can
similarities be found in the appearance of the subspecies of leucocephala 5
but also in the behavioural patterns among these birds. On an island
measuring approximately 160 miles long by 30 miles wide at the widest
point, all of the parrots on Abaco congregate in an area of about 15 square
miles located at the south-eastern end of the island. And here stands one
similarity in the behaviour of Amazona leucocephala on all of the islands
mentioned. On all of these islands, the parrots live in certain areas and
though they will fly near homes or settlements in order to feed, they do not
roost or nest in close proximity to human dwellings: rather, they prefer
the remote places for the breeding.
The Bahaman parrot of Abaco has a great advantage over his cousins,
caymanensis and hesterna , in that it is in a much larger and less restricted
feeding and breeding area. On Grand Cayman and Cayman Brae, the
advancement of civilisation has taken more and more of the natural terrain,
absorbing what was once used by the parrot. This may not seem as a threat,
for most people are not aware of the peril placed on these parrots, but with
the increase in tourism, land sales and island development, the effect on the
plant and animal population is devastating. This is especially true with the
parrots, for as they get pushed further and further away from areas being
developed, the suitable breeding areas are soon diminished to the point of
non-existence on such small islands. Today, it appears that caymanensis ,
hesterna and possibly bahamanensis have passed their zenith in existence,
and are now aimed in a downward spiral toward extinction.
Of the natural lands that do remain, only a part seem suitable for the
parrot. Why this is so is not completely understood; however, as mentioned
before, the parrots inhabit relatively small areas of the entire land available.

On Abaco, much of the natural pine-forest was removed for timber in the
late 1960s, which seems to have been one of the factors influencing the
present location of the birds in the south-eastern section of the island.
Another factor seems to be the abundance of food and amount of under-
growth serving as protection. Some of the foods which we observed the
Bahaman parrot eating were sea grapes, wild guava, poisonwood berries
(a type of sumac) and gumbo-limbo berries. However, what they seemed
to prefer most was the pine. This they would nibble on in whatever form
available, from the young pine cone and tender shoots of new branches
to the very bark of the trees. We observed many trees that had been well
worked over by these continual nibblers. Pines do not grow on Cayman Brae
or Grand Cayman and consequently the native parrots do not of course
feed on it there, but at the Ranch we have fed it to all of leucocephala ,
finding them all fond of it.
Generally, all leucocephala have access to the same foods and it all grows
on the same type of land. Rock is more like it, very hard rock. Amazingly,
this "ironshore" supports an abundance of life forms. Plants, shrubs and
trees crowd the rocky surface of these islands forming great areas of under-
growth which the natives call "carpetland" or "velvetland". The land is
pitted with thousands of holes ranging in size from a thimble to a house,
and in depth from a couple of inches to 50 or more feet. This is the land
that is the haven for the parrots, for it provides them with all the food and
shelter they need.
The predominant colour in all of the leucocephala is green, but this green
varies in shade and outline among the subspecies. In the Brae parrot
(hesterna), the smallest of the four, the green appears to be more brilliant,
but less iridescent than that of the Grand Cayman (caymanensis) parrot
and lighter than either the Cuban or Bahaman parrot. The outline, or edge
of each green body feather is black on all leucocephala , yet on the Bahaman,
this is more pronounced than on the Cuban, followed by hesterna and last,
caymanensis. The pink-red colouring of the throat area is common to all,
but this also varies. The Bahaman and Cuban have the largest splashes
of this colour ranging from pink to bright red. Hesterna does not have as
much quantity, but the shade can be just as bright: the Grand Cayman
parrot usually has a light pink colour on the throat and less of it than on
the others.
The beautiful green and striking red are brought into sharp focus by the
snow white cap. This white can cover an area starting behind the nasal
holes, to the full crown on top, down the sides of the face encircling the
eyes, and finally completing the white under the eyes on the cheek area.
This beautiful showing of red and white has been found in abundance on
mature Cuban and Bahaman parrots where the top of the head is entirely
white and the throat and breast are completely red, forming a solid
breastplate with contrasting green elsewhere edged in black. Hesterna has a
distinct white crown which, when fully developed, is not nearly the size

of the white area on the Bahaman or Cuban. The Grand Cayman Parrot's
crown is smaller and drab, the white turning to a yellowish cream colour
with bits of pink in some cases.
In all of these parrots, the red and white coloured areas increase in size
as the bird grows older. This, too, seems to vary in the species, for among
all of the parrots we observed in the field, as well as those involved in the
breeding programme at the Ranch, no two are quite alike. There does seem,
however, to be an overlap in the amount and tone of red and white that
can be found in these birds. Part of this can be attributed to age, as in the
comparison of an immature and a sexually mature parrot: the mature
parrot will usually have more and brighter colour, both red and white.
Other factors that may also influence the colour, such as health, diet,
season, moult, sex, activity and temperament, need to be considered and
researched further if conclusive understanding is to be gained.
Another notable pattern is the wine coloured patch of feathers found on
the stomach and extending down to the legs in some specimens. The
intensity and size of this pattern varies considerably, but is common to all
leucocephala. The Bahaman parrots which we observed on Abaco had very
little of this colouring and we found that it was usually limited to the legs.
Reportedly, however, the southern Bahaman parrot of Inagua has this
purplish tint in grand fashion starting at the lower breast and extending
down to the legs: hesterna seems to carry this trait the most, for in most
cases, leucocephala hesterna have large and vivid patches of this colour. It
appears that this colour trait is recessive in the northern Bahaman parrot,
for what reasons we are not sure.
The parrots of Abaco have been found to nest in rock holes as well as in
the holes of trees. We were shown several nest sites in the rocks that were
used by parrots in which some of the now captive birds on the island were
found. Another nest from which young were taken years ago proved to be
the top of an old dead palm tree. The palm was approximately four and a
half feet tall and eight inches in diameter. It was unusual, for there was
no covering on the top of the hole and no side entrance into the nest and
the parent simply sat in the shallow hole in the top of the stump about ten
inches deep. Our guide informed us that two broods of three and two
chicks respectively were taken from this palm nest only to be released later
by the authorities. It seems reasonable to assume that the Bahaman parrot
makes use of a variety of available nesting sites, whereas on Cayman Brae
and Grand Cayman, the nests were found only in trees. The trees included
cedar, gumbo-limbo, mahogany and ironwood, and the holes were found
to be quite deep. The absence of such large trees on Abaco could account
for the adaption to other forms of nest site.
We spent days and evenings into the night observing the Bahaman
parrot, for we knew that through observing them in the native habitat we
would gain a better understanding of their needs in captivity. The parrot's
apparent enjoyment of flying interested us greatly, for we had found that the

caymanensis rarely flew long distances, but seemed to prefer to flit from
tree to tree in the wild or walk in the aviaries rather than fly. Hesterna , too,
rarely flies long distances, possibly due to the limited habitat. On Abaco,
however, we saw through binoculars flocks of 20 to 30 parrots fly until
completely out of sight. Not only did they fly long distances, but they
played in the air, squawking and diving at each other. These parrots were
definitely more adept with the use of their wings than their Cayman island
cousins and, if in captivity, would need a large aviary for exercise.
Much has been gained through our encounter with the Bahaman parrot,
some of which we have tried to share in this article. We realise that this is
but a part of what has been done in researching Amazona leucocephala and
that much more is needed if these beautiful Amazons are to remain a part
of their native homelands. But research is only a part of this work, as all
of us at the New Age Ranch so well realise. As of this writing (February,
1978) the Ranch has successfully bred and raised 18 leucocephala , including
the first captive breeding of A.L caymanensis in the world. We feel that
research such as we have done on Abaco and in the Cayman Islands has
enhanced our understanding and appreciation of all Amazon leucocephala --
and more. We have been given the desire to continue breeding this rare
and endangered species in hopes that the future will hold a better chance
for its survival and that generations to come will have the same privilege
of seeing these parrots alive.

HAND-REARING OF THE ROSEATE SPOONBILL
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.9523909375" page_id="56283457"  page_num="23" year="" vol="">
By Walter Crawford (Head Keeper, St. Louis Zoological Park, U.S.A.)
During the past seven years, the St. Louis Zoological Park has main-
tained a small group of six Roseate Spoonbills Ajaia ajaja and for the
most part they are housed in the Zoo's 1904 World's Fair Flight Cage,
which measures 15.24 metres high, 25.60 metres wide and 60.96 metres
long. In winter, however, the birds are moved to inside quarters, which
measure 2.74 metres high, 4.57 metres wide and 11.58 metres long. A
large pool, natural perching materials, and both natural and artificial
light are available indoors. The spoonbills share this area with egrets,
herons, storks, screamers, ibises, terns and pelicans.
Prior to this time the spoonbills had not shown any inclination to nest
when housed outdoors, so a total of five nesting platforms constructed of
hardware cloth were installed in their inside quarters. Two measured
.17 by .45 metres, and three were .07 by .25 metres. The two larger
platforms were mounted on the limbs of dead trees, which in turn were
attached to support beams. The three smaller nests were placed on a

large heating duct that extended the length of the cage. The nests mounted
on the limbs were utilized by the spoonbills where they constructed their
own nests with no help from attendants.
The birds were transferred to their inside quarters during the first part
of November, 1977. By December they had formed pairs and had almost
completed constructing their nests. During this period considerable
aggression was observed between the spoonbill pairs. Once pairs had
chosen nest sites, aggression and interaction declined. Intense interaction
was also noted between the egrets and spoonbills.
The two nesting pairs laid a total of eleven eggs. Previous years had
shown that many eggs were broken or cracked during interaction of
various pairs; because of this the eggs were removed as soon as they were
discovered in the nest and placed in a Humidaire Model 14 Incubator.
During incubation the wet bulb was maintained at 30*C and the dry
bulb at 38*C. The eggs were turned manually three times a day. Of the
nine that were fertile, only one hatched. The chick appeared healthy and
was covered by a thick white down. After the chick had thoroughly dried,
it was moved to a brooder unit where the temperature v/as maintained
at 35 *C. The first feeding took place at 36 hours after hatch. At this time
the chick was very active and extremely vocal. Three days after hatching
the temperature was dropped to 32*C, and at ten days after hatching the
temperature was lowered to 29|*C. This latter temperature was main-
tained until the chick reached three weeks of age. At twenty-one days of
age the chick seemed able to regulate and maintain its own body tempera-
ture so it was kept at room temperature (22-27*C) for the duration of its
stay in the unit. On the thirty-fifth day the chick was moved to larger
quarters, an open top holding cage that contained an artificially constructed
nest of twigs placed in a large metal pan. This provided the chick an
opportunity to grasp the sticks in order to build its leg muscles as well
as promote the maintenance of healthy feet and toes.
Table 1 gives a breakdown of the diet used. The most practical way
of feeding the chick proved to be the tube feeding method. A 1 cc tuber-
culin syringe was used and to this was attached a Cholangiocath tube
that had been cut to the approximate length of the bird's neck. This
pliable plastic tubing proved to be easy to work with and clean. The end
was then rounded off by passing it over a flame. The tube was inserted
carefully down the throat past the trachea and the gruel was slowly
injected. Care had to be taken so that food was not given too quickly or
in too large a quantity in order to prevent aspiration. Table 2 illustrates
the quantity of food and the feeding interval for the first eight weeks.
At eight weeks of age, the gruel diet was supplemented with whole
fish (smelt). At each of the three daily feedings of 60 cc of gruel, one
whole smelt was forcefed to the chick. At ten weeks of age the gruel
feeding was cut to one 60 cc feeding a day in the morning and two
feedings of three to five whole smelt. At twelve weeks of age all gruel

forcefeeding was stopped., but it was offered in a pan free choice. The
bird was then fed whole, as well as chopped smelt by hand in any amount
it would consume. By fourteen weeks of age the bird could be induced
to feed by the attendant just placing his hand in the dish.
When the bird reached four months of age, it was placed in an outside
cage with an adult spoonbill so that it would learn natural feeding habits.
The birds were fed in a pool in the cage, and soon the young bird was
feeding as actively as the older bird.
It has since been moved into the large flight cage with all the other
species and has acclimatised very well. It has completely lost its depen-
dence upon man for food and is an active member of the flock.

METHODS USED BY THE TROCHILIDAE (HUMMINGBIRDS)
WHEN CAPTURING INSECTS
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999165428571428" page_id="56283460"  page_num="26" year="" vol="">
By A. J. Mobbs (Walsall, West Midlands)
From the moment when observations first began on the Trochilidae up
to the present day, the belief has persisted that hummingbirds are able
to extract insects from flowers by groping around with their tongue
until an insect adheres to it or becomes entangled in the fimbriated tip.
Certain authors have gone as far as to give hummingbirds chameleon-like
powers, believing these birds capable of taking insects by darting out
the tongue.
Gould (1861), when discussing the many types of beaks found in the
Trochilidae wrote that the "short-billed Lesbiae (sic) cling to the upper
portion of those (Brugmansiae) flowers, pierce their bases, and with the
delicate feelers at the extremities of the tongue, readily secure the insects
which there abound." Wagner (1946) admitted to being unable to deter-
mine how hummingbirds actually took insects from tubular flowers, but
stated "Probably the tongue, thrust into the flower, gropes about until
an insect adheres to it." Skutch (1951) believed that the Little Hermit
(Phaethornis longuemareus) took insects from "the corolla of a great many
flowers." However, in one of his more recent writings (Skutch 1974),
he agrees that such behaviour is impossible. Weymouth, Lasiewski and
Berger (1964) in a highly technical paper on the tongue apparatus in
hummingbirds, state that "Insects are entangled in the fimbriated tip
of the tongue when the hummingbird is probing into flowers, or picking
up insects from some surface . . ."
When describing the capturing of airborne insects by a Deville's
Hummingbird (Amazilia beryllina devillei ), Wagner (loc cit ) believed that
the bird plucked insects from the air by "darting out the tongue for a
fraction of a second so that the insect was caught upon it." In a recently
published work Lack (1976) erroneously describes how he saw a perched
Jamaican Mango (Anthracothorax mango ) twice take insects from vegeta-
tion by extending the tongue.
Scheithauer (1967) describes how he placed a fruit fly on the tongue of
certain hummingbirds to see if the tongue was in fact sticky enough to
be able to hold the insect. Although he pressed the fly down slightly,
it fell off as soon as the bird's beak was tilted.
Although it is impossible for any of the Trochilidae to capture success-
fully insects on the tongue, it is possible for an insect to inadvertently
become adhered to it (usually when the insect has been taken insufficiently
far enough into the gape for it to be swallowed). Should this happen, the
bird will shake its head and move the tongue in and out of the beak until
the offending insect has been dislodged. Should the insect prove difficult
to remove, the bird will often become most distressed and continually
scratch the beak in an attempt to remove the insect. Even when the insect

has finally been dislodged, the bird may, due to stress, carry out displace-
ment scratching for a moment or so afterwards.
As will be seen from the appendix, the shape of the beak does not
determine methods used when capturing insect prey. To give but one
example: the beak of a female Purple-throated Carib (Eulampis jugularis) is
similar in shape to that of certain Phaethornis sp., yet never does the
carib glean insects as do the latter. The extreme curvature of beak in the
Sicklebills ( Eutoxeres ), would appear to be a poor tool with which to
capture airborne insects, yet birds from this genus have been seen to
take prey in such a manner. However these birds also glean insects and
do appear to use this method more regularly than the hawking method.
Olson, Powell and Eisenmann (1968) thought it remarkable that a female
White-tipped Sicklebill (E. aquila ), captured on 9 July 1966 should
have a crop filled with small wingless ants; but in my estimation, such
prey would be far easier for such a bird to capture than would winged
insects.
Species from the genera Ramphomicron , Metallura and Chalcostigma will
use Method 5 (see later for description), but it is rare for the first named
to do so. In confinement, hummingbirds can usually obtain sufficient
livefood without having to revert to methods which would perhaps be
rarely used in the wild. Vuilleumier (1969) gives an account of a female
Olivaceous Thornhill (1 Chalcostigma olwaceum)&amp;gt; walking on densely matted
grass cushions of a meadow, picking up insects as she went. The italics
are Vuilleumier's not mine; I do not consider it an unusual feat for a
hummingbird to walk on the ground, having witnessed such behaviour
in a number of species.
In captive birds, only one genus appears to use method 5 almost ex-
clusively. However, from observations made on wild birds, it is obvious
the helmetcrests ( Oxypogon sp.) use this method regularly to obtain insects.
Although all hummingbirds include insects in their diet, certain species
(such as those living at high altitudes) are without doubt more insecti-
vorous than others. All the species I have studied have increased their
intake of insects prior to and during the annual moult. In fact it is possible
to anticipate the moult by the number of insects taken. Certain species
when deprived of insects for any length of time, may be seen to hawk
imaginary prey. Amazilia sp. in particular may be observed hawking
particles of dust which have been illuminated by shafts of sunlight. Highly
insectivorous species which are deprived of insects during the period of the
moult, often develop stress marks in their plumage; this being most
noticeable in the primaries and tail feathers. Such species may also develop
areas of white in their plumage (see Mobbs 1973).
The methods used by certain members of the Trochilidae are described
as under. The list is not complete due to the observations having been
made on captive birds only; many of those made in the field often being
suppositional and therefore unreliable.

Method 1 --Hawking
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.968704325581396" page_id="56283462"  page_num="28" year="" vol="">
This consists of the hummingbird chasing after airborne prey with
beak agape. Certain species will feed on swarms of flying insects by cap-
turing individual insects one after another until the swarm is dispersed,
or until the bird becomes satiated. Other species hawk their prey in the
manner of many flycatchers, i.e. make sorties from a prominent perch,
taking an insect and then returning to the perch. A further method entails
the hummingbird hovering above stationary winged insects in an attempt
to startle them into becoming airborne, when the bird will then snap them
up.
I have found the hawking methods described to be interchangeable
amongst the species concerned, no species using solely one method. As an
instrument for taking insects whilst on the wing, the hummingbird's
long, thin beak appears greatly inferior to the broad, flat beak of a fly-
catcher or swallow or the capacious mouth of a swift or goatsucker.
Moreover, it lacks the rictal bristles around the mouth which help to
deflect flying insects into it. However, the hummingbird compensates for
the narrowness of beak by its superb control of flight. When a hummer
captures an insect in flight, its forward movement forces the prey so far
to the rear of the gape that it is readily swallowed. Should for some
reason the insect not be taken far enough into the gaping beak, it will be
discarded.
Method 2 -- Gleaning
One is able to study this method far more easily in captive hummingbirds
than in the field. However, it has been mentioned in numerous ornitho-
logical papers, but in none of these can I find a complete description.
Insects are gleaned from a surface (usually leaves or bark); the humming-
bird taking its prey in the tip of the beak, tossing the insect into the air
and flying at it with beak agape so as to enable the insect to be taken into
the rear of the gape.
Certain species will take an insect from a surface, toss it into the air
and then with beak agape, fly backwards tilting the head so as to enable
the prey to fall into the rear of the gape.
As will be seen from the appendix, certain species have been seen to
use methods i and 2, whereas others appear to use one method only.
Why this should be I am unable to determine; one thing is certain however,
the size and/or shape of the beak is not a deciding factor. Species which
inhabit the more open areas are more likely to be successful with method i,
even so many of these species certainly use method 2 also.
The following two methods are a form of gleaning, but are I feel
sufficiently specialised to warrant being placed under a separate heading.
Method 3 --Special&apos; Gleaning (a)
This method is as far as I am able to determine used only by the Blue-
chinned Sapphire ( Chlorestes notatus). The bird, whilst hovering, will

inspect a surface for insects and upon locating one, will open the beak
approximately 6mm, then approach the insect until the beak is almost
touching the surface on which the latter is resting. The bird then taps
the surface (usually twice) with the beak thus causing the insect to fly
directly into the beak, when it is immediately swallowed. Although
this method proves highly successful, insects can be seen to escape on
occasions by flying to one side of the open beak.
The force used by the sapphire when tapping the surface with its beak is
considerable and should the surface be solid (e.g. wood, fibreglass, etc),
the noise made is audible from a distance of some 12m or more.
Method 4 -- 'Special&apos; Gleaning ( b )
A method of gleaning used by the Violet-headed Hummingbird (Klais
guimeti), consists of the bird taking an insect from a surface but instead
of tossing the prey into the air, manipulating the mandibles so as to force
the insect far enough into the gape to enable it to be swallowed. The
Violet-headed also uses method 2 (see appendix).
Method 5 --Running! Walking Procedure
As already mentioned, this method is most certainly used by Oxypogon
sp., and possibly by other species found at high altitudes. However, due to
such species being very difficult (or impossible) to maintain in captivity,
I can include only one genus under this heading. The method (which for
want of a better phrase I call 'running/walking' procedure) entails the
hummingbird hunting insect prey either on or close to the ground by
actually running or walking, snapping up insects as it goes. To enable the
prey to be taken far enough into the gape, the bird will upon capturing an
insect, toss it into the air and with gaping beak, tilt the head backwards.

UNUSUAL FEEDING HABIT OF A LESSER SULPHUR-
CRESTED COCKATOO
By Paolo Bertagnolio

<bodyText confidence="0.992631733333333" page_id="56283465"  page_num="31" year="" vol="">
In "Further notes on tool-using by birds and related behaviour",
by Jeffery Boswall (A.M., 3,1978), is quoted a comment by Derek Good-
win on an unusual drinking habit of a captive cockatoo. Amongst other
things Derek Goodwin says: . . .
I think I am right in saying that parrots do not pick up objects in their
feet. They pick up an object in the bill, then move the foot to the bill
and grasp the object while the bill manipulates (or billipulates) it".
I am acquainted with at least one exception to the rule, concerning one
of my Lesser Sulphur-crested Cockatoos, a semi-tame male (of the sub-
species parvula or perhaps occidentalis ) housed in an outside flight to-
gether with a rather wild female. This bird usually grasps a handful of
sunflower seeds with his right foot, which he then raises to the bill,
picking one of the seeds and dropping the others. While the first seed is
being shelled and eaten a new handful is taken and so on.
Rather suprisingly, this unusual technique is invariably used when the
bird is hungry (as for example immediately after the food dishes have
been refilled), while at other times he can be seen to pick up seeds in the
traditional way.
Another curious habit of one of my parrots that is worth mentioning,
regards a Grey Parrot. This bird, for a period was housed in a disused
barn containing a number of vertical hay racks made of T iron bars 2m
high, on top of which some perches had been fastened. When I entered
the barn the bird, a tame female, used to come down holding with both
feet one of the vertical bars and letting herself slide along it. She was
able to descend quite quickly and to stop at different levels, simply re-
leasing or increasing her grasp on the bar. When the bird was attracted by
a favourite titbit it was amusing to see it slip down at full speed and to
abruptly stop only two inches from the cement floor. I have always been
surprised not to see smoke arising from the feet of this living lift from the
considerable friction.

SOESTERBERG, HOLLAND.
On the continent of Europe interest in parrot breeding has increased
remarkably during the past decade or two. In Holland, Belgium and
Germany particularly, there are hundreds of breeders producing annually
large numbers of lovebirds and Australian parrakeets. Even rare species
such as Cloncurry, Hooded and Brown's Parrakeets are regularly bred
and find ready buyers at very high prices. However, less interest is shown
in the South American parrots and in lories and lorikeets.
Our members, Mr. and Mrs. J. Spenkelink, are typical of Dutch
aviculturists in that they keep Tasmanian Rosellas, Platycercus cale-
donicus , and olive Peach-faced Lovebirds, Agapornis roseicollis , of which
they bred 23 and 16 respectively in 1978. However, they also maintain a
collection of conures, ringnecks and hanging parrots with which they
had remarkable breeding success.
Results with the Pyrrhura conures were especially notable. Few avi-
culturists keep these most attractive birds, the Red-bellied being an
exception. In 1978 they reared four species, a total of seven forms and
43 young which must establish a record for this genus in one season.
These included cruentata , the Blue-throated Conure, the largest of the
genus and one of the most beautiful with its tan-coloured ear coverts.
This success was a repeat of 1977 when five were reared. This species
has only rarely been bred in captivity; it is currently being bred in Britain
by a member of the Society in Yorkshire, Harry Sisson.
The Painted Conure, P. picta , has yet to be bred in Britain; the Spenke-
links bred two races in 1978--four of the nominate and six of amazonum.
Two races of the Black-tailed Conure, P. melanura , were reared, resulting
in the considerable total of eight berlepschi and 11 chapmani. P. melanura
was imported into Britain and Europe often during the 1960's; is any-
one in Britain still breeding it? Finally, nine Red-bellied Conures, P.
frontalis , of two races, kriegi and chiripepe , left the nest.
Five species of Aratinga conures were reared, one of which has yet to
be bred in Britain and possibly has not previously been reared in Europe--
Weddell's, A. weddellu Two young were reared. Although Petz's Conure,
A. canicularis , is often imported, it is rarely bred, thus the breeding of
three young is of interest.
Most notable among the conure breedings, for it may be a 4 'first" in
Europe, is that of two Red-throated Conures, A. holochlora rubritorquis.
This is a striking bird with its broad band of red across the upper breast;
it is rare in captivity. Finally, four Golden-fronted Conures, A. auricapilla
auricapilla , were reared. The latter was almost unknown on the avicultural
scene before the mid-1970's but has now been bred in a number of
collections in Europe and the USA but probably not in Britain.
Exceptional results were obtained with hanging parrots. Three pairs

each of Blue-crowned, Loriculus galgulus , and Vernal, L. vernalis , are
kept in a colony with two pairs of the Philippine, L. philippensis. This
resulted in two Vernal, four Blue-crowned and eight Philippine being
reared. The two pairs of the latter were double-brooded, rearing three
and two, and two and one. Fourteen must easily be a record number of
hanging parrots reared in one collection in one season.
The Psittacula parrakeets also did well; to complete a most impressive
list for 1978, six Moustached Parrakeets (four P. alexandri fasciata and
two P.a. cola ) and four Blossom-headed Parrakeets, P. cyanocephala rosea ,
were reared.

BREEDING RESULTS DURING 1978 AT JERSEY
ZOOLOGICAL PARK
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.987495238095238" page_id="56283468"  page_num="34" year="" vol="">

Breeding results in the bird collection during 1978 at the Jersey Zoo-
logical Park were in the main most encouraging. Undoubtedly the most
significant were from the two species only arrived from Mauritius the
year before.
The Pink Pigeon raised four and Meller's Duck laid several clutches
from which 12 ducklings were reared, with a most fortunate sex ratio of
pairs.
The Bare-faced Ibis fledged eight young (one hand-reared). During the
previous winter their nesting cliff had undergone modification, levelling
the granite work and broadening and concaving the ledge, which was
then divided by vertical partitions to provide some twenty individual sites.
These improved facilities may be reflected in the improved results.
Among the waterfowl four Nene were raised for the first time here.
Cereopsis Geese produced seven goslings, less than usual. One pair of
Coscoroba Swans did particularly well raising six cygnets themselves and
we handreared one from the second pair. In addition four Ross's Geese
and the usual Laysan Teal, Hawaiian Duck, Mandarin and Carolina were
produced.
The White Eared Pheasants were outstanding, having their best year
so far successfully, rearing 38 chicks. The Brown Eared Pheasants as
usual hatched a few chicks which were raised. After the introduction of
two new cock Edwards' Pheasants all four pairs were fertile this year but
unfortunately the number of birds available to the W.P.A. programme
for this species was reduced as several developed leg perosis. However,
twelve fine specimens were despatched in August.
One pair of Keas reared a nice young female. The Amazon parrots laid
a most disappointing glut of infertile eggs due mainly to a lack of males.
All four Guilding's Parrots have now laid. So we look for males before
any progress can be made on this front.
Two Salle's or Hispaniolan Parrots bred here in 1973 laid for the first
time, both in the same box seven eggs in all. The only pair of Salle's Parrots
to lay were again infertile. As they have done for the past seven years two
pairs of Thick-billed Parrots hatched young. It seems we are beset with
having to hand-rear their young and are busy with three from one nest,
but unfortunately lost the two from the other.
Turacos had their best year of late. Three pairs of Pink-crested hatched
young and two of these succeeded in rearing a total of three. Grey Turaco
raised a brood of two but failed with their next; it is five years since we
have bred this species. The White-crested Turaco nested late in the season
and laid in September with the two eggs being fertile.
Our only pair of Gold Coast Turaco built a nest but went no further.

A frustrating season was encountered with the Woodford's Owls and
owing to some strange behaviour from the females several early chicks
were lost, however the year is not completely blank with one successfully
raised. One pair of Snowy Owls had five young.
The number of Rothschild's Mynahs reared to maturity is again quite
fair, the latest figure being 25 young this year, but the end result slightly
disappointing. We have increased our breeding pairs from 3 to 5 but the
percentage of chicks they raised was far lower than in 1977.

The South African National Cage Bird Association presents an annual
Championship Show on the second weekend in July, which is hosted by
a club in a different region every year. In 1978 it was the turn of the
Western Province Cage Bird Society and the venue was the Civic Centre
at Sea Point, a suburb of Capetown. The Western Cape is inclined to be

somewhat isolated, aviculturally speaking, from the rest of the country,
and the total entry of i,6oo birds is approximately half of what may be
expected on a National Show staged in the Witwatersrand area where the
population is very much greater. The various breeds of domesticated
Canary made up the lion's share of the show. However, some interesting
wild birds did appear in their section (230).
Foreign wild birds are not too easily come by in the Western Cape
because of the distance from the major importers, which are to be located
within easy reach of the only international airport---Jan Smuts, near
Johannesburg. Runner up to Best Foreign Bird went to one of the very
few softbills staged, a very fine Pileated Jay, whose class also contained
the young Pileated Jays bred by G. O. Brown to be described later. The
supreme award was given to a particularly fine specimen of a Black-crested
Finch, and another strong contender in the American section was a
magnificent and steady Rainbow Bunting. All the American buntings
were represented, and there was one of the Sporophila finches, which
are seldom seen in this country.

F. C. BARNICOAT--NEWS FROM SOUTH AFRICA
Capetonian fanciers seem to have compensated for their lack of rare
foreign species by becoming the leading specialist breeders of Zebra
Finches in South Africa, and this section was quite impressive with good
examples of all the mutations. The bird at the top, however, was a fine
normal cock. Red, Black and Yellow-headed as well as White-breasted
Gouldians were of high quality, and I was fortunate to take Best Australian
with a Red-headed cock I had transported nearly a thousand miles from
Johannesburg. The Diamond Sparrow, Blue-faced Parrot-finch and all
four grassfinches were to be seen.
The Asiatic section was dominated by Bengalese and Java Sparrows,
though Red and Green Avadavats, all the nuns. Pin-tailed Nonpareils
and Pekin Robins made a bit of variety. The award for best Asiatic bird
was made to a variegated Java Sparrow, a species that always seems to
fare surprisingly well on the show bench in South Africa, presumably
because our judges seldom fail to be impressed by the immaculate,
smooth plumage normally sported by these birds.
As usual, the most disappointing foreign section was that for European
birds. For some reason they do not seem to be imported as frequently as
the birds from other continents and seldom do really well, either because
of the heat or because of the difficult adjustment to the seasons of another
hemisphere. The five specimens of European seedeaters were headed by
a Greenfinch. Best dove on show was a Gold-billed Peruvian Ground
Dove, but this section, too, was very small.
In this country a section for African birds is kept very distinct from
that for South African birds, because the former may be kept, sold and
transported without a permit. On this show the African Section was one
of the smallest seen on a National Championship and the winning bird
was a Scaly-fronted Weaver.
In the South African section soft-billed birds were conspicuous by
their absence. Usually there is an attractive range of sun birds to be seen,
but this year there were none. A few white-eyes, bulbuls and glossy
starlings were all this section had to offer. There was, however, a most
interesting albino specimen of a white-eye, found when very young on
an apple farm in Elgin. Rejected by its parents, presumably because of
its abnormal colouring, it owed its life to the keen fancier who happened
to find it. The normal grey tint had become purest white, but the yellow
colour was unaffected and showed up as a pure and bright canary yellow.
The bird was most attractive and caused quite a sensation, but was
unfortunately not in the top condition required to win a major award.
The usual South African waxbills--Common, Orange-breasted, Blue,
Red-billed and Jameson's Firefinches, Swee, Melba and Violet-eared
were quite well represented, though most species are found in the Trans-
vaal rather than the Cape.
As was to be expected the strongest section on this show were the
serins, many of which have their stronghold in the Cape. Black-throated,

Yellow-eyed, Black-headed, Forest and Cape Canaries and Yellow, Bully
(Sulphury), Streaky-headed and White-throated Seedeaters as well as the
delightful little Cape or Totta Siskin were out in force. A particular high
light were 3 outstanding King Blackheads, including a hen bird. This is
the rare sub-species of the Black-headed Canary with the attractive white
markings on the head, and is a much sought-after avicultural prize in
South Africa. The buntings too--Cape, Larklike, Rock and Golden-
breasted--were very attractive. Appropriately enough the medal for best
South African wild bird was won by a fine and steady Cape Canary.
The fact that the National Show has to be held during mid-winter to
suit the canary fancy unfortunately precludes the eclipse plumage birds
like the whydahs, and many of the weavers from making their appearance,
which is such an attractive feature of our summer shows.
For many years the South African National Cage Bird Association has
awarded a medal to fanciers who breed a bird for the first time in this
country. These schemes ran into financial difficulties as well as the old
problem of establishing where certain claimed first breedings were really
such. The Board decided therefore to issue certificates for all approved
breeding claims, but only one medal for the "Most meritorious breeding
of the year", to be selected at the Conference by the delegates representing
the different bird clubs throughout the country from all the claims
received during the past year.
For 1978 four breedings were put on the final short-list to be voted on
at the Conference: the Pileated Jay, Cyanocorax chrysops from South
America; the Thick-billed Parrot Rhyncho psitta pachyrhyncha, a delightful
dark green parrot with deep velvety red forehead, wing edges and thighs,
which is a native of Mexico and is now so rare as to be possibly an endan-
gered species: the Red-faced Crimson-wing Cryptospiza reichenoviiy an
attractive estrildid in olive-green and dark red from East and Central
Africa: and the Australian King Parrot Alisterus scapular is , which is, of
course, well known outside South Africa. The medal was voted to the
Pileated Jay, the difficulties involved in breeding this bird being con-
sidered somewhat more taxing on the keeper than was the case with the
other breedings. In addition, the successful breeder G. O. Brown of
Port Elizabeth, had taken the trouble of bringing the obviously young
Pileated Jay to the show, where it provided a centre of attraction.
As it will possibly be of interest to many members, I now include G. O.
Brown's own account of his breeding success, which he wrote for a Club
news letter.
Breeding the Pileated Jay
"About two years ago I obtained two of these Jays. They come from
Brazil, South America, and love to eat mice and insects etc. They are
bigger than the Starling family and have a deep purple blue colour with
white on the breast and stomach, the beginning of the white on the breast

being a distinctive line about half way down. These Jays have a crest of
bristle like feathers that remain in a fixed position.
"Later I obtained another four, and therefore have six. These were
divided up into two cages of three each. Sometime in 1976 it was observed
that these birds were feeding each other. It was decided to move the one
lot into a big aviary about 10 m x 4 m x 4 m with no other birds, as they
will kill off any birds in their aviary. Soon after being moved into their
new aviary they started carrying sticks around.
"From the underpart of the asbestos roof that is three metres in width
I suspended some branches, keeping them clear of the sides and thus
ensuring that no rats could get to the branches. At this stage I made a
mistake by putting the other three in an adjoining aviary of similar
dimensions. By now the hen in the first aviary had built a nest, deep cup
shaped, and was in condition for breeding. The close proximity of more
Pileated Jays seemed to excite her mate as well as the new cock next door.
The males would hop around and make a burring sound, and push the
white feathers on their chests out erect and hold them there for a moment.
The hen layed three mottled brown eggs, but these disappeared after a
few days.
"The birds then went into a moult, and this was the end of the story
for that season. At this stage I removed the Jays next door and this had
a calming effect on the birds I had first put out in the aviary.
"Somewhere in Cage and Aviary Birds I had read some information
on Jays which included the statement that unless they had a big aviary
where they could hide their food they would die of frustration. I hoped
I could take the frustration involved in breeding them myself! I was
determined to breed the Jays in 1977, 80 I P ut split rings on the first three
Jays so as to be able to identify them, and decided to remove the wire
dividing the two aviaries, which would provide them with the much
larger area of 20 m x 4 m x 4 m. I let out into this aviary three of the Jays,
which I was certain were one male and two females. I also decided to feed
at one end of the aviary, well away from the breeding area. I let the floor
of the aviary grow wild. Taller weeds grew up through the grass floor
covering, reaching a height of over a metre.
"Nothing happened until January 1978, when they rebuilt the same
nest as used previously. Four eggs were seen, only to disappear a few days
later. At this stage, I gave up and took little interest apart from feeding.
"Then some weeks later I looked into the nest by standing on a box
and to my surprise there were chicks. I can only think that the second
hen must have layed in the nest just after the disappearance of the four
eggs. At no stage did I notice any bird sitting on the nest.
"The male always gives a warning call when a person gets anywhere
near their cage. Could it be that the sitting hen immediately left the
nest at the alarm call of the cock and was thus never caught incubating?
It was also mid summer and very hot, so perhaps the eggs could have

been incubated only at night.
"One chick was reared and stayed in the nest for about 30 days and
sat on branches above the nest for five days before flying. Six weeks after
leaving the nest the young Pileated Jay was eating. Its plumage was darker
than the adult&apos;s and it had a very dark eye. While the chick was learning
to fly, all three adults were very protective".
Breeding the Red-Faced Crimson Wing
This breeding was achieved by John Hanson of Randburg just north
of Johannesburg. He specialises in the rarer African seedeaters, notably
the twinspots, with which he has had considerable success in aviaries
of quite modest dimensions. As he now has youngsters from the pair he
bred last year, which contested the S.A.N.C.B.A. Medal, thus reaching
the second generation with this species, I have thought that a few remarks
about his experiences will not come amiss.
The Red-faced Crimson-wing very seldom comes on the market in
South Africa and only in extremely small numbers. As one might expect,
it is a species better known to Rhodesian aviculturists than in South
Africa. It is a bigger and more heavily built bird than the waxbills and
is basically an olive green bird with very dark, though rich red wings and,
in the case of the male, with broad red eye stripes. They make a very
attractive pair.
John Hanson achieved his first breeding of them last summer in an
aviary 5 m long, 1.3 m wide and 2 m high, shared with two other pairs
of waxbills. About 1 m of the length is taken up by shelter, which, how-
ever, is fully open in the front.
In addition to the usual seeds, live food is given regularly in the form
of either mealworms or white ants (termites) fed every other day, the
two being alternated. When babies are known to be present an effort is
made to feed some form of live food every day, however. The inflores-
cences of grass, when in season, are more greedily taken than any other
food, and were supplied daily and formed a major part of the rearing
food. In fact Hanson considers greenfood a more important aspect than
live food and as much and as varied supplies of grasses and weeds as
possible are provided.
The first nest was built in a bundle of gorse-like bush fixed up in the
shelter. Like all subsequent nests it was built of dried grass and was a
bulky affair. It was not, however, a stable enough structure and its bottom
collapsed, plummeting three babies to the ground, which were not dis-
covered until the following morning, when they were dead.
The second nest was given support in the form of a piece of wire netting
discreetly inserted under the bulky structure. The Crimson-wings showed
no objection to this interference and went right ahead with the construction
of their nest. Like the nest built by the young pair this season, the nest
was about a foot in length and about two thirds that in diameter. Despite

the bulk of grass the actual nest chamber was small, neat and round and
situated very much towards the front of the structure. In every nest there
was a sort of escape hatch towards the back or side. In this second nest
two young ones were successfully reared, a third having died in the nest
when fully feathered.
The youngsters were predominantly a dull grey-green when they left
the nest with a little dull red on the rump, and in due course they coloured
into a fine pair. They are kept in a different, but similar aviary to that of
their parents, and this summer they were the first to nest. At the time
of writing they are busy rearing four babies, while their parents have
built a nest again, this time in a privet bush in the open flight of their
aviary, and are incubating.

Members will have learned with sorrow of the deaths of Newton R.
Steel and Captain H. S. Stokes.
Newton Steel had been a member since 1956 and had served several
terms of office as a Council member where his knowledge and advice was
always appreciated. He was an expert aviculturist and a regular contributor
to the Avicultural Magazine.
Captain Stokes was one of the Society's earliest supporters having
become a member in 1922. He was made an Honorary Life Member in
1972.
Mats Tell writes from Ljungbyhed, Sweden: "During the 1978 breed-
ing season I managed to breed from seven species--the best result ever--
Four Virginian Cardinals, three Bluish Finches, four Bicheno's, two Silver-
eared Mesias, two Bourke's Parrakeets, two Azara's and five Sun Conures.
The Lesser Patagonian Conures and the Eclectus Parrots again failed;
the conures were, however, all females and I have now acquired another
bird--I hope it is a cock! The Eclectus Parrots laid early in spring but
upon checking the logs there were no signs of any chicks. I think their
eggs were infertile.
I lost my old breeding male White-throated Seedeater. The Lesser
Redpolls were released in May. For three seasons my Nonpareil Buntings
were observed looking for a nesting site but got no further.
In Sweden generally some good breedings were recorded: one Yellow-
naped, two Orange-winged and four Blue-fronted Amazons, four
Timneh Parrots and three Slender-billed Conures, Enicognathus lepto-
rhynchus , were all reared to maturity. An 18 year-old cock Spengel's
Parrotlet was again fertile and some chicks were reared. Two Swedish
"firsts" among finches are worth mentioning: the wild Canary and the
Red-fronted Serin, Serinus pusillus , were bred this year. The main rearing
food for both species consisted of dandelion seed."

The R.S.P.B. reports that 21 Red Kites were reared in central Wales
during 1978. An isolated population like that must have become very
inbred long ago, to no great detriment presumably, but, of course, only
the fittest survive and evidently inbreeding is not a serious factor among
the really healthy.

The author is well-known in both avicultural and ornithological circles
for his studies on parrots. In this book he treats those which he puts in
the subfamily Psittaculinae, in which he includes the genera Psittacula 3
Tanygnathus , Edectus , Psittinus , Bolbopsittacus , Geoffroyus , Prioniturus ,
Alisterus , Prosopeia , Aprosmictus , Polytelis , Loriculus and Agapornis.
Thus besides many generally lesser-known forms, the book deals with
such well-known avicultural favourites as the lovebirds, the Rose-ringed
Parakeet and its many fairly close relatives, the King Parakeet, the Crimson-
wing and the Barraband.
A short introduction is followed by a Chapter 1, in which the author
lists the forms that he includes in his subfamily Psittaculinae and defines
the physical and behavioural characters that distinguish them. Chapter 2
on the housing and feeding of parrots. Here, on the strength of his own
observations and experience, the author questions or denounces, rightly in
my estimation, some long-accepted avicultural dogmas. However al-
though I believe he is right in saying that it is of more importance that an
enclosure for parrots should protect the inmates from cold and wet than
that it should be large, I cannot accept his implication that the fertility
of modern man and the fact that modern Budgerigars are bred in cages
are valid arguments against the need for exercise. Indeed if I thought
that those aviculturists who now breed such beautiful creatures as
Bourke's, Elegants, Eastern Rosellas, Rose-ringed Parakeets etc, would
ultimately produce the equivalent of the exhibitors heavy, macrocephalous
monstrosities that have now replaced forever (since no fresh "blood" is now
obtainable from Australia) what formerly was one of the most beautiful
and the most easily kept of parakeets --the Budgerigar--I would wish them
complete lack of success instead of the reverse.

Chapter 3 deals with breeding the sub-family in captivity and here,
besides much helpful information, contains a great deal of useful and
interesting information on nesting and parental behaviour.
Chapter 4 deals with behaviour or rather some aspects of behaviour
that have not already been dealt with. This is a subject where one feels
there is much truth in the saying "One picture is worth a thousand words"
and it seems a pity that this book, otherwise so lavishly illustrated, does not
have a few line sketches of some of the postures and displays described.
Perhaps, as is often the case, it was a matter of having to keep the number
of illustrations within circumscribed limits for reasons of cost or space.
Chapter 5 deals with genetics, colour mutation and colour definitions.
The rest of the book's chapters each deal with a genus or group of genera.
Every species within each genera is described and the known information
on it, both in the wild and in captivity, is given. The book concludes
with a list of references to important papers or books dealing with one
or more of the birds discussed. It is illustrated with 30 colour plates,
depicting some 19 species (some species have two or more plates to show
their different colour varieties) and 18 line drawings, which include several
distribution maps. The author writes throughout in a clear, agreeable
and often witty manner. As in all books, or at least all that I have ever seen,
there are one or two apparent errors in type-setting or the like but none
of any importance.
At #15 the book may appear expensive to those who, like the reviewer,
date from a time when a loaf, of bread cost 2d (old pennies!) and a bar of
chocolate--id, but, as things now are, it seems well worth the price. I
think it will be of great value to anyone with some interest in any or all of
the parrots it deals with and absolutely indispensable to anyone who intends
to keep them.

VETERINARY ASPECTS OF CAPTIVE BIRDS OF PREY
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.994658976190476" page_id="56283478"  page_num="44" year="" vol="">
By J. E. Cooper b.v.sc., d.t.v.m, m.r.c.v.s.,
Published by the Standfast Press, Saul, Gloucestershire. Price #10.00.
Man's association with captive birds of prey is a particularly long one;
in fact, documentary evidence suggests that hawks were used for falconry
over 2,000 years ago. During this long association, many diseases became
recognised and described in literature. The cures advocated were varied
and bizarre and in some instances, probably did more harm than the
malady they were meant to combat. In the first section of this well pro-
duced book, the author very capably guides the reader through the
colourful, archaic terminology of falconers. For instance; the droppings of
a long-winged hawk (typical falcon) are called "mutes", whereas those of a
short-winged hawk, such as Goshawk, are referred to as "slices". Also
some of the ancient terms used by falconers to describe the problems
that afflicted their birds are translated into modern parlance and thus the
reader learns that "Fellanders" is now known as capillariasis, "Snurt" is
rhinitis and so on.
The main body of the book deals in detail with physical diseases,
infectious diseases, metazoan and protozoan parasites, foot conditions,
nervous disorders, nutritional disorders and poisons. The author draws
heavily on his considerable veterinary experience with hawks to describe
symptoms, possible causes and, where known, the treatment most ap-
propriate for the disorder. In addition, the findings of many other research
workers are outlined so as to provide a comprehensive and up to date
survey. The source of this information is quoted in an extensive bibli-
ography.
Although the book is concerned specifically with birds of prey and
certainly some of the problems such as bumblefoot are much more
frequently encountered in birds of prey maintained under falconry con-
ditions than in other groups of birds kept in aviaries, many of the disorders
described apply generally to birds maintained under controlled conditions.
For this reason I would, without reservation, recommend this book to
anyone involved in the care of birds. The illustrations, which clearly
show the external symptoms, pathological specimens and radiographs
associated with various problems are most interesting and the section
that lists numerous drugs and agents together with dosage, means of
medication and other comments is of particular value.
Finally, although members of the veterinary profession will undoubtedly
find this book a very worthwhile acquisition, a professional training is
not necessary to understand the text, because the author carefully ex-
plains the medical terms and other specialised terminology in layman's
terms.

As members will know, John Yealland has retired from editing the
Avicultural Magazine. The Society owes a great debt to him for, under
his skilful editorship in the last five years, the Magazine is generally
acknowledged to have reached the highest standard in its 84-year history.
As Curator of Birds at London Zoo. John Yealland was known and
respected the world over as a great aviculturist and when he retired from
that post and undertook the editorship of the Avicultural Magazine, he
brought with him an immense store of practical knowledge of keeping
and breeding birds, as well as a considerable literary flair and the ability
to distinguish instantly fact from fantasy. His wit and wisdom have been
enjoyed by many and we are indeed fortunate that he has promised to
keep a watchful eye over future issues.
It is with the greatest trepidation, if not alarm, that I attempt to follow
in his footsteps. Whilst I have always had a deep interest in the keeping
of animals in captivity generally, and have spent most of my adult life
"in the business", first at London Zoo and then at Sladmore Gardens,
I could not profess to be an aviculturist at all. In fact, the only bird I
have ever kept was a flightless African Grey Parrot whose few words of
conversation, after thirty years in a newsagent's shop, would be quite
unprintable in the Avicultural Magazine.
I agreed to undertake the editorship only on condition that the Council
would act as an editorial committee, with experts in the various groups
of birds advising on their particular subject. I know that I can count on
their support but in the end the Magazine can only be as good as the
material contributed, and it is really up to all the members to maintain
the present high standard. So I would urge any member who has made
an interesting study or observation of captive birds to spare time to write
it down. Don't be discouraged if it is not long enough for an article--a
short, half-page note is just as valuable, or why not write a letter for
inclusion in the correspondence column ?
Only a very few members are able to attend the social meetings and,
for the great majority, publishing the Avicultural Magazine is the Society's
chief function. In addition to the membership, the Avicultural Magazine
has a large readership in the many university and museum libraries which
subscribe to it and it occupies a niche which is not filled by any other
journal. It has a reputation throughout the world for informative articles
on every aspect of aviculture, written in an interesting and readable style,
and bridging the gap between the very technical journals and the more
general cagebird magazines. I do appeal for all your help in maintaining
this tradition.

Request for Information on Captive Grayson's Doves
The Socorro or Grayson's Dove Zenaida graysoni is a highly distinctive
insular form of the common Mourning Dove Z. macroura of North
America., either a full species or an exceptionally well-marked subspecies.
It has been successfully hybridized with the Mourning Dove in captivity.
In a wild state, Grayson's Dove is known only from Isla Socorro, the
largest of the Islas Revillagigedos, located in the Pacific about 200 miles
south west of the tip of the peninsula of Baja California, Mexico. It is an
attractive bird, substantially larger, longer-legged, longer-billed and
longer-tailed than the Mourning Dove, and much darker in colour,
being an almost uniform deep orange-cinnamon below, including the
under tail-coverts (which are white in the Mourning Dove).
During an expedition to Isla Socorro in April 1978, no Grayson's
Doves were seen at all, in areas where they had been described as com-
mon as recently as 20 years ago. It is thus possible that Grayson's Dove
is extinct in the wild state. I would like to request information from any
reader of avicultural magazine who may own living Grayson's Doves,
or have pertinent information about where such birds are currently being
kept. Any such stock should be conserved carefully, bred if possible,
and in no instance permitted to hybridize with other doves. I am also
seeking information about the source of any such captive Grayson's
Doves in order to learn how recently they were still being imported either
directly from Socorro or from a dealer or breeder in Mexico or elsewhere.
If any reader has such information, please communicate with me at your
earliest convenience.

FIRST BREEDING AWARDS

May I be allowed to reply to C. J. O. Harrison's letter "reappraisal of
awards for first breedings" Vol 84 no. 3 ?
I cannot agree that the Society should consider abandoning the issuing
of medals and would like to make the following points:--
1.) Whilst I do not agree with the taking of rare birds, there are a great
many birds which are rare in captivity but not in the wild. Many such
birds can be kept and possibly bred by the specialist aviculturist. The
strong international pressures referred to by Dr. Harrison seek not only to

prohibit the trade in 'rare' birds* but in all wild birds. They would do
better to direct their efforts to ensuring that all livestock dealers* trappers
and airlines were better equipped to deal with their charges than the
majority are at present.
2. ) The unusual or rare bird has always been very much more expensive
than the common species and the quarantine regulations now in force
have merely increased the price unreasonably while the majority of soft
bills are in poorer conditions after the quarantine period than if they had
been taken straight from the shipping box and sold.
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.829683214285714" page_id="56283481"  page_num="47" year="" vol="">
3. ) I would suggest that more birds are destroyed by man's encroach-
ment upon/interference with the environment than are destroyed by the
bird trade* (although I deplore any losses). May I point out that control
methods used in various countries destroy not only common species
but also rare ones.
4. ) Our overseas members are in the Society because it offers the best
avicultural literature in the world at a price which for them is relatively
cheap. Why is Dr. Harrison so concerned with democracy in a society which
does not hold an A.G.M.
5. ) Any reputable aviculturist would/does let other members of the
Society see any unusual breedings in order that they are not classed as
dubious records* or is Dr. Harrison suggesting that today's members are
any less reputable than the members of a few years ago ?
6. ) If Dr. Harrison's statement that the majority of members are de-
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.97257" page_id="56283481"  page_num="47" year="" vol="">
barred from obtaining rare birds because of scarcity/price is carried to its
logical conclusion in that the number of birds available will decrease* then
I fail to see how the issuing of medals can be an unnecessary burden on the
Society's finances.
I would add that breeding rare birds (or any livestock) is a great leveller
and is as likely to be achieved in a small garden shed with privacy as in a
large aviary with many inhabitants.
Personally I would like the issuing of medals to be worldwide* even
if it means raising subscriptions. Furthermore, whilst I agree that the is-
suing of medals for first breeding is an attractive "carrot" for the written
article* I would like to know what Dr. Harrison proposes we replace this
"carrot" with if we are to continue to receive first breeding articles.
I do not believe that undue emphasis is placed on the first breeding, as
written reports help further breedings of that species. Moreover, I would
like to see some form of recognition for repeated substantiated breedings.
In conclusion I would like to add that all people who keep livestock
condone the international traffic to some extent whether we like it or not.

the society's medal (Instituted ist November 1896)
The Medal may be awarded at the discretion of the Council to any
Member who shall succeed in breeding, in the United Kingdom, any
species of bird which shall not, in the opinion of the Council, be known
to have been previously bred under controlled conditions in Great Britain
whether naturally reared by the parents, reared by a foster parent or hand-
reared. Any Member wishing to obtain the Medal must send a detailed
account for publication in the Magazine within about eight weeks from
the date of hatching of the young, and furnish such evidence of the facts
as the Council may require. The Medal will be awarded only in cases
where the young shall live to be old enough to fend for themselves. The
question of awarding a Medal for the breeding of subspecies of species
that have already been bred shall be at the discretion of the Council. No
Medal can be given for the breeding of hybrids.
The account of the breeding must be reasonably full so as to afford
instruction to our Members, and must appear in the avxcultural maga-
zine before it is published or notified elsewhere. It should describe the
plumage of the young, and be of value as a permanent record of the nesting
and general habits of the species. These points will have great weight
when the question of awarding the Medal is under consideration.
In every case the decision of the Council shall be final.

BREEDING THE RED-BILLED HORNBILL Tockus erythrorhynchus
AT THE COTSWOLD WILD LIFE PARK

By j. SIMMONS (Senior Head Keeper)
The Red-billed Hornbill is a small Hornbill (17 to 18 inches) commonly
found through East and Central Africa and into South Africa. The upper
parts are brownish-black with a white line down the back. The underparts
are entirely white, the wing-coverts are covered in quite large white spots and
the bill is red, sometimes black at the base of the mandible. The male differs
from the female in having a longer beak, in some pairs this is really obvious at
a casual glance, whilst in others it needs careful scrutiny.
On 24th February 1976, a shipment of birds arrived from Kenya, which
included four Red-billed Hornbills, all in good condition. On arrival these
birds were housed in a large indoor cage at the back of the animal kitchen. A
single male Red-billed Hornbill which had been in the collection since 1974
was housed with the new arrivals to help them adjust to their new surroundings
and diet. The birds were fed on chopped day-old chicks, chopped lean raw
meat, chopped boiled egg, a very small amount of finely diced fruit and
brown bread, mealworms, well-cleaned maggots and our own insectivorous
mix. All the food was sprinkled with a multi-vitamin powder.
On 2nd April, all the Hornbills were put outside into a new aviary,
10m X 3m X 3m high, with a heated shelter. After a week one of the new
males was looking "off-colour". It was taken into the bird hospital for
treatment but did not respond and died on 18th April; a post-mortem
revealed nothing of any significance.
The original male Hornbill paired up with one of the new females and
bullied the other two Hornbills which had to be removed to another aviary.
Mud in a metal dish was provided for the pair of birds and a nest-box of
approximately 7 inches square by 2 feet deep was positioned on the back wall
of the aviary, about 5 feet from the floor, amidst a rambling rose. On 5th May
the pair of birds were carrying around mud in their beaks and trying to mud

up the nest hole. The mud kept falling off the box and so a natural ring of
bark was fixed around the nest hole. This proved very satisfactory and the
Hornbills started again on 15th May to mud up the new entrance.
On 28th May the birds were observed mating and had completely mudded
up the nest entrance by 5th June. By 16th June nothing more had happened
so the mud from the hole was removed. This acted as a stimulant and the
birds again started to mud up the hole.
On 22nd July, the female was sealed inside the nest-box and the male was
feeding her through a small slit in the mud. The male spent the next two days
passing dry grass into the female. Before anything was passed to the female
the male would call to her. All went well, the male diligently feeding his mate
and on 27th August, chicks could definitely be heard. As soon as the chicks
were heard, extra live food and locusts were added to the diet. Calcium and
multivitamin were applied liberally to the live food during the rearing
period. The incubation period must be approximately 30 -- 34 days.
All went well and on 19th September a chick's beak was seen at the hole; it
was quite yellow compared to the deep red of the male's beak. On 20th
September the male was feeding direct to the chicks, previously all food had
been passed to the female. On 21st September two chicks' beaks could be
seen.
On 24th September at 12 noon the female broke her way out of the box, she
looked rather 'grubby'. By 26th September the chicks had sealed themselves
back into the nest box. Both parents now fed the chicks through the very
small slit in the mud.
At 10. 30 a. m. on 8th October, the first chick broke its way out of the
nest, after about two hours of hammering at the mud. It was slightly bigger
than the female with a short orange-yellow beak and indentical plumage.
Three chicks' beaks could be seen at the nest-hole and they had mudded up
the hole by 4 p. m. the same day.
On 14th October another chick emerged from the box and within two
hours the remaining chicks had mudded up the hole again.
On 16th October a third chick emerged from the box and on 19th the
fourth and last chick emerged from the box. All the chicks were perfectly
formed.
The nest box was removed and examined the next day and it was interesting
to find that there was about 12 inches of dried grass and small sticks which
the Hornbills had added to the 4 inches of wood pulp which had been placed
in the box prior to it being placed in the aviary.
Since 1976 we have raised to maturity from this pair of Hornbills, and the
other pair which were removed to another aviary, a total of 23 birds.

The Lilac-breasted Roller is a truly handsome bird and must rank as the
most elegant of all the Coraciidae. It is found in parts of East, Central and
South Africa and is typically seen perched on telegraph poles and dead
stumps. Along with the other members of the Roller family it feeds on large
insects such as locusts, butterflies, beetles, etc. It also takes small lizards and
the like.
The Lilac-breasted Roller measures approximately 16 inches which includes
its long thin tail streamers. As its name suggests, the throat and breast are a
very rich lilac, the rest of its underparts are a greenish-blue. The forehead is
bright blue fading to browny green on the head and back of the bird. There is
some white around the eye, dividing the blue forehead from the lilac throat.
The rump and wing-coverts are very bright ultramarine blue and the long
tail streamers are blue, tipped with black.
Four Rollers were part of a consignment of birds imported in February
1976 from Betty Roberts of Kenya and they were all in very good condition.
On arrival the birds were placed in a large indoor cage in the back of the bird
kitchen. They were fed on chopped day-old chicks, chopped lean meat,
chopped hard-boiled egg, maggots (well-cleaned), mealworms, locusts and
pink baby mice all sprinkled with a multi-vitamin powder and our own
insectivorous mix.
On 1st April 1976, the four Rollers were placed in an outside heated shelter
and kept locked in until 15th April, when they were released into the
adjoining flight. They showed no signs of breeding that year and were
brought inside for the winter on the 15th December. On 4th April 1977,
while still in their winter quarters, one of the Rollers was found dead; a post
mortem revealed nothing of any significance. The remaining three were put
back in an outside flight on 9th April.
All went well with the remaining three Rollers until 18th October, when
one of the birds was found dead. A post mortem again revealed nothing. The
remaining two were then taken inside again for the winter.
It was suspected that the remaining two birds were a pair as one was
slightly larger and had a bolder-looking head. This proved to be the case and
more or less as soon as the birds were put back outside for the summer on the
1st April 1978, the bolder looking bird (the male) started taking an interest in
one of the nest-boxes in the corner of the aviary. The aviary measures
approximately 20 feet by 12 feet high with an adjoining shelter. The
other inhabitants of the aviary were a single Bronze-Wing Pigeon and a trio
of Bamboo Partridge.

Unfortunately, due to various circumstances a trio of Green Wood Hoopoes,
a pair and their previous year's youngster, had to be moved into the aviary.
No aggression was shown between the Rollers and Hoopoes, but the Hoopoes
took over the nestbox and the male Roller switched his attention to
another nestbox placed about 10 feet from the ground on the side of the
aviary amidst a large Buddleia shrub. The male kept flying to this box
which was a "coffin type" box measuring 8 inches square by 2 feet high and
calling to the female in a series of harsh chattering notes.
On 7th April the female Roller spent most of the day in the box, as she did
for the next two days. Between 9th and 21st there was always one of the
Rollers in the box and it was assumed that they must be incubating eggs. On
29th April the birds were acting as if they had chicks, extra live food was
supplied to the already mentioned diet. All the food was dusted with calcium
and Abidec drops added as well as the multi-vitamin powder. Over the next
few days activity seemed to die down and on 8th May an inspection of the
box revealed nothing, no sign of eggs or chicks.
The Rollers carried on going in and out of the box during the rest of May
and on 28th June quite distinct chick-like noises could be heard from the
box. The food was as before with the addition of cockroaches. As the days
went by the noise from the box increased. Both parents carried food, mostly
live food, into the box.
On 21st July the box was inspected and one really healthy looking chick
was observed. It was nearly as large as the parents, fully feathered with the
same markings but much duller colours, with a very short tail and no tail
streamers.
On 23rd July the chick left the nest box. It spent most of the next day on
the aviary floor beneath the box but by the next day was perching alongside
its parents, who both continually fed it. On 1st July the male Roller suddenly
became more protective towards the youngster and spent the next two weeks
attacking any of the keepers who ventured into the aviary.
It is interesting to note that during the nesting and rearing periods the
Rollers showed no aggression towards the Green Wood Hoopoes, even all-
owing them to perch on top of the nest box which contained the young bird.
At the time of writing, 16th February, 1979, the young Roller is fine and
locked with its parents in the heated shelter attached to the aviary. It is
suspected to be a male by its general build.
As far as we can ascertain, this is the first breeding in this country.
As recorded above, the Lilac-breasted Roller Coracias caudata has been
bred at the Cotswold Wildlife Park and this is believed to be the first
success in this country. Anyone knowing of a previous breeding in Great
Britain or Northern Ireland is asked to inform the Hon. Secretary.

By L. GIBSON, (Burnaby, B.C.)
This bird is known variously as the White-breasted Rail, Red-and-white
Rail and Brazilian Rail (or crake). It is interesting to note that the dissimilar
words "Rail" and "Crake" both have their origin in onomatopoeic attempts
at describing the noise made by the bird. Almost certainly the original bird
described was the European Corncrake Crex crex. The scientific name is a
fair rendering of that bird's call.
The Red-and-white Rail is a typical Rallus, with the black and white bars
on the sides. This pattern is so common world-wide, and it is beyond me
why such similar birds are split into several genera. This one is, however, one
of the more colourful rails, being basically a bright ginger to chestnut red,
with a white breast. The bill is yellow and green, and the iris of the eye is a
beautiful billiard-ball red. Even the legs are a colourful reddish-pink, much
like the Redlegged Honeycreeper C. cyaneaus in colour.
Almost no information is available on the bird in the wild, other than that
it comes from Brazil and neighbouring countries. It must be fairly common
as it has been the only rail to show up the bird trade, and consequently
some have appeared in private collections. Normally this group of birds is
seen only in zoos, and only occasionally at that.
Leucopyrrhus is probably unusual in the group in that it spends much, if
not all, of its spare time in bushes, trees or other high spots in the aviary.
Dense foliage is preferred. On the ground, the bird likes to be within
sprinting distance of cover, and will work its way up if possible. However, if
not disturbed it will walk about, bathe and feed in full view and indeed will
come running for a mealworm.
They are very quiet birds and communicate with a single low whistle. A
few extra calls are added when chicks are around. They are peaceful and do
not molest small birds even when they (the Rails) are breeding. However,
their bush-walking habits could disturb other nesting birds. They have one
drawback in that they find nests irresistible and like to see how many of their
group can pile into one nest. I have seen four squeeze into a canary basket.
The long legs and large feet make them look much larger than they actually
are. An adult bird weighs around only 40g (about an ounce and a half).
The feathers are very soft, even on the wings and tail, and they are
apparently quite waterproof. Even after total immersion in water, the rails
never become bedraggled and flightless like my other (passerine) birds.
Bathing is amusing to watch. They like deepish water and wade in to the
depth of their long legs. Then they do several rapid knee-bends, immersing
themselves entirely. They finally retire to some high foliage where a long
time is spent preening. Mutual preening is rarely indulged in. Baths are
often taken several times a day, and commonly in the late evening. It was

never ascertained if the birds could actually swim, as a large enough volume
of water was not supplied. As every experienced aviculturist knows, water
can be dangerous in an aviary, especially to chicks.
The small, rounded wings are rarely used for normal flight -- at least not
in the confines of a small aviary. They are used to give the bird a flying start
when running up a bush, and for balance when walking along a narrow
branch. The bird usually flies the last little bit to the ground after walking
down through the foliage to a clear space. Even this short flight is taken only
after much hesitation and then only after the bird has checked several times
that there are no suitable pathways to walk down.
Sexing
Three birds were almost identical in colouring, but one was noticeably la-
rger than the other two. The 4th had the same feather pattern, with the typ-
ical bars on the flank, but its colouring was different. Where the others were
red, this bird was a light greyish brown. It had black eyes and blackish brown
legs. At first it was thought to be an immature bird and later thought to be a
hen. It was finally concluded that it was a closely related (and as yet
unidentified) species. Of the red birds, the largest one had a lighter ginger-red
head and neck. The two smaller birds were identical to each other, being a
darker chestnut colour.
This difference in colour could only be seen when the birds were together
at close quarters, and in good light.
The only record on these birds that I have read was a breeding account by
C. Everitt of the Boehm Aviaries, Trenton, New Jersey. Although these
birds were banded, Everitt could see no difference between them in the large
aviary, and he did not record a difference in size.
I am fairly sure that the large bird was a hen, and the two smaller ones
males. The odd one remains a mystery, but I think it would be a hen. Sexing
was complicated by the fact that all 4 birds shared every activity, from
incubating to feeding and brooding the chick. The largest birds' legs were &apos;&apos;
(7mm longer) that the 2^&amp;quot; (65mm) of the two small birds. It was made even
taller by the obviously larger head on a stouter neck and at 43.2g., it was the
heaviest. The two smaller birds weighed 37.5 and 40g., with the odd one
weighing in at 42g. So size and weight would be a good means of sexing them.
Housing
Nesting took place in a densely planted conservatory which was described
in the 'Avicultural Magazine' article on Pekin Robins (No. 1 Vol 84 1978).
Nesting
These birds roost in a nest all the year round. They will utilise any suitable
nest, or use an open-topped box or basket. As a last resort, they will build a
nest of their own. The roosting nest is less elaborate than the breeding nest.
My birds used an open cardboard box 61 / 2 &amp;quot; X 6 1 / 2 &amp;quot; X 5&amp;quot; deep (16.5 X 16.5
X 13cm). Some dry grass had been put in the box, and for roosting the birds
twisted this into a nest and added a few leaves. The nest is semi-domed, like a
normal nest tilted at 45*.

When breeding is imminent a more substantial nest is made. This consisted
of adding a thick lining of leaves to the roosting nest. Large or long leaves
(bamboo) were used and were pasted on when wet to give a smooth interior.
Leaves were piled into the water dish for several days until they were soft and
workable. Leaves in the water dish are a good indication that breeding is
underway, providing of course that there is no other source of wet leaves. As
the conservatory was fully enclosed, fallen leaves were rather dry. Failure to
provide a source of wet leaves may result in an atypical nest being built, or
may even hold up breeding. Only once was a nest built without the use of
artificial support. It was made by the large red (hen) without any help from
the others. This nest consisted of a large pile of soft wet leaves with a thick
base. The heap was 7&amp;quot; (18cm) deep and 6 -- 9&amp;quot; (15 --23cm) across. It was
placed almost 7 &apos; (2m) up in a dense Honeysuckle Lonicera. The bird carried
up the large wet leaves one at a time, and had some difficulty getting them
through the tangle of growth.
Because of the nesting activities of other birds in the aviary, the Rails were
all moved out before this natural nest could be used. Although their new
accommodation was a large, well-planted, outdoor aviary, which was shared
by some Mousebirds (Colius), the Rails unfortunately ceased all breeding
activity -- probably because of the move.
Eggs
Two eggs were laid. The egg is white, rather sharply tapered and huge. It
weighs about 8.5g, which is 20% of the weight of the adult bird, (or even
more if the largest bird was not the hen). In the Kiwi class, this is comparable
to a breakfast egg of half-a-pound or more. The egg was l l A&amp;quot; X almost 1&amp;quot;
(32 X 25mm), and the shell was thick. The incubation period was not noted,
as the exact day of laying was missed.
A chick hatched on April 29th (1977), so breeding had commenced early in
the season. The other egg had not hatched two days later, so it was chipped
open. A well-developed dead chick was found inside.

The chick was fascinating to watch. It was jet black all over, save for a
white tip on the upper mandible. It had black furry down and barely
discernible wings. The feet were huge, and the whole effect looked like a
stuffed toy. Within two hours of hatching it had left the nest, (this was not
observed) and was seen following an adult rather unsteadily. By the next day
it was quite steady and a lot faster. It followed whatever adult happened to be
passing. This did not seem to matter, as all four adults fussed over it. When
approached by a human, it did not 'freeze' as noted by Everitt, but simply
went on its way. At this early stage, at least one (cock) bird would divebomb
an intruder's head, and all the birds would set up an agitated clucking.
At the age of two days it was running over the whole length of the aviary,
and was seen to drink by itself. The chick was unable to get back to the nest at
night (as reported in the Boehm Aviaries), and it was brooded on the ground
by all of the adults. At night it jumped on the back of an adult (usually a small

red), and was covered completely by the wings. The adult bird simply
crouched on the ground at whatever spot it happened to be in when darkness
fell. The chick slept in this fashion for at least the first week.
The chick was fed by all of the adults, and was also preened by them. The
hen was particularly active in preening and was seen to lift the little one off
the ground by its down feathers. Especially in the first few days, the chick
was fed by the brooding bird, which was in turn given food by one of the
others. During the day the chick was usually underneath the brooding bird,
and occasionally on its back. At night it always slept on the adult's back,
while it was still small enough to do so.
An approaching bird would run up with food and offer it to the brooder.
The exchange was accompanied by a few little clucks. The brooder in turn
clucked to the chick, which would pop its head out from underneath the
adult's feathers. The chick was then offered the food, which it had to take
from the adult's beak. It was never fed down the throat, nor did it gape. The
inside of the mouth (and the tongue) was dark grey.
It was not ascertained at what age the chick was completely self-supporting,
but at two to three weeks the adults became less concerned about it. If the
aviary was entered, the parents left the chick to escape by itself, which it did
at high speed. It remained at ground level all this time, and was never heard
to cheep.
At three weeks of age the ivory tip had almost disappeared from the beak.
An ivory patch had developed at the base of the top mandible and was
beginning to take on the yellow-green of the adult, and a few white streaks
were appearing on the breast. At this age it was moved to an outside aviary,
and by the second night it had found its way into the original nest, which had
been put in a bush at a height of 2ft (60cm). It then roosted there with one or
other of the adults. The other three remained, as usual, in the highest foliage
in the aviary. At 30 days old, the chick could be seen in the topmost branches,
and from then on all five birds roosted in a box at a height of 6(2m). The
chick was by now the tamest bird of the five, and so it remained.
At this stage it was moulting its baby wing feathers. The replacement of
the black down was very gradual, beginning on the breast. Then the head
and neck became reddish, the colour change spreading gradually towards the
tail. However, many dark feathers remained all over, so that when the bird
was fully grown, it had a very dark overall appearance.
By six weeks of age, the chick was as large as the biggest adult (hen) when
the chick was weighed at 14 weeks, it was found to be the heaviest bird at 46g.
and was thus presumed to be a hen. It had weighed 7.8g. at birth, and the
only other time it was weighed was at 11 days, when it was 18.5g. By now the
eye was a dull red and the legs were reddish-brown (the eyes and legs being
black previously).
All the Rails were then disposed of to the local zoo. Because of the large size
of the aviary they were put in, it has not (so far) been determined when the
chick acquired the tull adult colouring. All the birds remain well there at the

time of writing (some 4 months later) and the chick still had some dark
feathers at the age of 8 months.
Feeding
The chick was rasied on the adults&apos; diet without the use of live food. For
the first three or four weeks it was fed almost exclusively on scrambled egg
and soft bread and margarine. Mealworms were only given twice, and the
adult who found them first immediately took them to the chick. The
mealworms were offered straight to the chick without them being killed or
pre-softened. The chick gobbled them up without any pre-manipulation.
The Rails are about the only birds I have who eat dry dog kibble (chow)
powder voluntarily (i.e. when other food is still available). It was unlikely
that the powder was fed to the chick, because of transportation problems, but
later the chick ate this alongside the adults. The chick was first seen eating by
itself at 13 days, but it was almost certainly doing so many days before.
The adult birds also ate some rice pudding and drank milk nectar, which
had been put in for the Cyanerpes and Zosterops , which shared the aviary.
The rails never molested these little birds.
The Laterallus love garden worms and any kind of insect, but these birds
did so well on the manufactured diet that live food was rarely offered. They
were never seen to eat green food and it was never offered in the feeding dish.
However it was difficult to check if they were eating it or not in the densely
planted aviary. Millet seed was consumed regularly whenever it was given.
This was offered mainly in winter just in case they had been eating naturally
available greens in summer. Fruit was ignored. No doubt they would eat
poultry meal.
Health
When first acquired, all the birds were thin, and heavily infested with a
small strongyloid nematode. These roundworms were easily removed by
giving each bird an unmeasured pinch of Thiabendazole, washed down with
water, on two successive days. The Rails remained healthy and moulted well
on the somewhat restricted diet outlined above.
They were wintered outside in the conservatory, with temperatures touching
freezing at times. Now they are enjoying a deserved life of luxury in the more
comfortable surroundings of a tropical aviary at Stanley Park Zoo, in
Vancouver. As a matter of fact they are only next door to their old friends the
Mousebirds, -- more of which anon.

BREEDING NOTES ON THE ACORN WOODPECKER
Melanerpes formicivorus
AT THE HOUSTON ZOOLOGICAL GARDENS
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.992432700000001" page_id="56283512"  page_num="68" year="" vol="">
By WILLIAM Todd (Senior Keeper, Tropical Bird House)
Although breeding of the Acorn Woodpecker has been recorded at least
once previously (Callegari, 1966), we feel it important to present what has
occurred with this species at the Houston Zoological Gardens.
We received our original pair as a donation in May 1972 from a private
aviculturist who had imported them from Mexico. Although we have been
unable to examine study skins or fina adequate descriptions of the 8 subspecies
recorded by Peters (1948), it is the nominate form he lists as occurring
throughout Mexico, and I would suppose our specimens to be representative
of this race.
The Acorn or Ant-eating Woodpecker (in older literature the bird will be
listed under the generic name of Balanosphyra, which, in 1951, was reduced
to subgenus of Melanerpes by the American Ornithologists' Union) is generally
coterminous with the Western oak forests of North America, ranging from
Oregon, south through California, Arizona, New Mexico, western Texas,
into Mexico and Central America to Panama.
Outstanding, colourful birds, they exhibit subtle, yet definite sexual
differentiation. On both cock and hen, the beak is black, as is the feathering
immediately surrounding the beak; the lores, chin and throat are a yellowed
white; the eye-line, occiput, nape and back, upper breast, wings and tail are
black; the belly and rump, white; the sides and lower breast, white streaked
with black; the feet grey, the forehead and crown of the cock are scarlet and
his irides a golden yellow. Across the forehead of the hen, and continuous
with the eye-line is a black band, separating the yellowed white of the lores
from the scarlet crown; her irides are a less conspicuous brown.
Throughout much of their range, and as long as the season permits, the
birds subsist on acorns, yet a large variety of foods has been recorded,
including cultivated almonds, sap extracted from trees, insects captured on
the wing, and even lizards and bird eggs. Although jhey chisel holes for
obtaining sap and storing acorns or nuts, these woodpeckers appear to have
abandoned the more traditional habit of drilling for larvae of wood-boring
insects (MacRoberts, 1972). As might be expected, they nest in holes excavated
in trees, but they are unusual in that a pair may be aided in nesting duties by
unpaired adults (Skutch, 1943). When not nesting, they often travel in small
flocks and may all sleep together in the same hole.
Our pair of birds was housed in a large glass-fronted exhibit of mixed
species when the present curator, Robert J. Berry, assumed this position in
1972. In August of that year he had them isolated in a smaller glass-fronted,
sky-lighted exhibit measuring approximately 8 X 12 X 12 feet, due to their
continual soiling of the walls in the larger exhibit by defecation in flight. A

standard nest box I2 n X I2 n X20 n with a 4&amp;quot; diameter hole was hung high
on the wall of the exhibit facing the glass. To the satisfaction of the staff the
birds began nesting in the spring of 1974, but the first clutch of 4 eggs
reported on May 15 did not hatch, nor did the 2 eggs found on June 24, and it
was not until August 29 that they were successful in hatching 3 young.
Unfortunately, the chicks were found dead on the cage floor on September 6.
On December 31, 2 additional young were hatched after an incubation of
about 15 days. On 3 January, 1975, 1 of these chicks was found dead on the
cage floor, and on the curator&apos;s advice, the second chick was removed from
the nest to be hand-reared. Food consisted of Purina Cat Chow softened in
water, and Zu-Preem Bird of Prey Diet. Rearing progressed well until the
chick suddenly became gravely ill, refusing further food. Near death, it was
given an injection of Gentocyn and made a dynamic recovery to be raised to
maturity.
On March 18, 2 more chicks were hatched and successfully reared by the
parents, fledging about a month later on April 16. The juvenal plumage of
the birds resembled in pattern that of an adult male, but duller with black
feathers interspersed in the scarlet of the crown. The black forehead band
distinguishing the hen appears with the post-juvenal moult. Fear that the
exhibit cage would prove too small for more than the pair of birds prompted
the removal of the young, which, given a more spacious situation might have
assisted with future broods as reported of wild birds, on May 21 when
another chick was reported to have hatched. Two weeks later, however, the
nestling, still with unopened eyes but sprouting feathers, was found dead on
the gravel floor, apparently thrown from the nest.
Throughout the breeding history of our pair of birds, there have been
numerous instances of eggs, both fertile and clear, broken or consumed by
the parents, as well as chicks of various ages thrown from the nestbox. One
may only speculate about the motivation of such destructive behaviour.
Perhaps the infrequent but inevitable human interference; the birds are by
no means tame and protest the least intrustion vociferously. And although
we have done our best to minimize the disturbance of maintenance during
nesting periods, the stream of faces at the exhibit window no doubt contributes
to their insecurity.
The most recent successful hatching was around mid-September 1975,
the chick not actually being discovered until the 29th of the month already
sprouting feathers. The single chick fledged successfully and was well cared
for by its parents, but in December it was noticed that the maxilla was being
deformed by a buildup of food material on the palate. Following capture and
removal of the debris and necrotic tissue, the bird was returned to the
company of its parents. The trouble was determined to have been caused by
the addition of Flamenoil to the soaked Dog Chow (see below) giving it a
gummy consistency. This knowledge came too late, however; although use of
the supplement was discontinued, the trouble persisted, and in January of
1976, the bird was removed to the zoo clinic where it died of sinusitis on the
13th.

W. TODD - BREEDING THE ACORN WOODPECKER
Since the last successful fledging, several more clutches of eggs have been
laid, but unfortunately all have been destroyed by the adults prior to hatching.
Planned relocation of the pair to a more suitable facility may induce further
reproduction.
The adult woodpeckers are provided with a varied diet of Purina Dog
Chow soaked in water, small amounts of Zu-Preem Bird of Prey Diet,
sunflower seeds, unshelled peanuts, small amounts of mixed fruit (diced
apple, papaya, raisins), chopped endive, commercial mynah bird pellets
and a few mealworms. In addition, part of an ear of corn and half an apple,
diced in the peel, are affixed to the tree, and acorns are provided in season.
The diet is supplemented by a sprinkling of Paltone animal vitamins and
oyster flour on food items every other day. It was originally found necessary
to stuff the crevices of the exhibit branches with peanuts and bits of meat
until the birds became accustomed to eating from a tray placed on the cage
floor.
When feeding young, the birds are provided with additional live food:
decapitated crickets (the undigestible chitinous heads may obstruct the ali-
mentary tract) are supplied several times a day as well as occasional newborn
mice.
The parents feed at intervals of about 10 minutes, snatching a morsel and
flying to a favoured perch crevice where they hammer it into an edible state
before proceeding to the nestbox.
When not breeding, the parents spend a great deal of time "storing food",
in particular peanuts and mynah bird pellets, either in holes they themselves
have drilled, or in convenient ducts from which such items may never be
recovered.
Serious aggression between the adult birds has never been noted although
threats and attacks have occasionally been directed at their reflections in the
exhibit glass.

Colibri coruscans x Colibri thalassinus
By R. J. Elgar (Manchester)
By late spring 1978, my male Brown Violetear Colibri delphinae and
female Green Violetear C. thalassinus had both moulted and I was hoping
for a repeat of the breeding I had in 1977 (Elgar, 1977). Unfortunately,
early in June the male Brown Violetear died, while at the time, the female
Green Violetear was active, attaching spider's web to several plant stems in
the flight.
At this time I had been unable to acquire a male Green Violetear and the
female seemed unwilling to accept display and mating from male
hummingbirds of a different genus to herself. After a lot of thought, I
introduced a male Sparkling Violetear C. coruscans. This species is notoriously
aggressive and will vigorously defend its singing perch and feeding tube. I
have three males of this species, so I introduced the smaller and less
aggressive of them and it settled down without causing trouble to the rest of
the hummingbirds.

1. Male perched on one of the three display perches in the flight, which
he uses regularly, utters short burst of song, interrupted by his advert-
ising call. While making calls, he will vibrate his wings vigorously at a
45* angle, at the same time leaning slightly backwards to show violet
patch on breast; and with ear-patches extended.
2. After phase one, he flies straight up with a slow floating wing beat,
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.975700227272727" page_id="56283516"  page_num="72" year="" vol="">
swaying from side to side, to a height of about fifteen inches above his
perch, which he then slowly descends to. He will repeat this several
times, usually singing, until a female is attracted to the vicinity of his
perch.
3. The male will then fly to the female and hover in front of her with his
bill pressed into the female's lower breast or vent area, swinging the
rest of his body from side to side: his ear-patches extended, and singing
continuously. This lasts only a few seconds; he will then quickly fly
round the back of her and, with bill pressed to her nape, mate.
NESTING ACTIVITY 1977- 1978
In 1977 the female nested on four occasions, twice in nests constructed
by herself and on both occasions the eggs laid were infertile. She nested
twice in nests constructed by myself -- hatching three chicks -- but reared
only one to independence.
In 1978, her first nest was made by myself, using the method I have
previously described (1977). On this occasion though, she attached dark
brown moss to the sides of the nest, covering the light grey sphagnum moss
I had used. The nest was placed on a horizontal stem of a Arrow-headed
Vine Syngonium vellozianum , some twenty-four inches from the floor. This
plant grows from the floor and clings against some of my flight cages. The
female had chosen this site, by starting to build there, before I provided my
man-made nest.

would be infertile, but rather than remove immediately, I thought I would
let the female incubate them for a week or two. The following week-end I
was cleaning the flight cages as usual. When I started the cage where the
nest was only inches away from my face the female left the nest to feed, and
I looked at the eggs. To my surprise they were both fertile. I carefully left

Until the second egg was laid, she only incubated at night. The first egg
hatched at 8.30 pm on 8.8.78, some sixteen days after being laid, and
thirteen days after incubation started in earnest.
The second egg hatched at 7.00 am on 10.7.78, fifteen days after being
laid. With the thirty-four hour gap between the chicks hatching, there was
from the beginning a noticeable difference in their size.
From my notebook:
"July 13th. First chick has pin feathers showing, second chick very
small but healthy.
July 17th. First chick&apos;s eyes open, pin feathers starting to open,
second chick very weak, no noticeable development for several days.
July 18th. Morning, second chick dead in nest underneath the first
chick.
July 19th. Remaining chick's feathers showing well, female sleeps on
her usual perch, does not brood chick, now 11 days old.
July 21st. Female calling to chick before alighting on nest to feed it.
July 24th. Chick fully feathered primaries and tail almost fully grown.
July 26th. Chick on rim of nest most of the day exercising wings, it
sleeps in the nest at night.
July 28th. Female is very aggressive towards other hummingbirds in
the area of the nest and the two feeders that she uses. The chick is now
answering her call prior to feeding. I think this call is to build up a bond
between parent for when the chick flies.
July 30th. Morning, chick is very active in nest, exercising wings and
preening. In the afternoon it is on rim of nest snapping at fruit flies.
July 31st. In eagerness to be fed by female, chick ventures from nest to
stem of plant about four inches from nest, but scrambles back to nest after
being fed.
August 1st. Morning, chick perched with female twenty-four inches
from nest, chick flies at 24 days old."

It was not until August 10th, that I witnessed the young hummingbird

to thirty minutes, but by the fourth day, began to tire of this and only fed
the chick occasionally, usually after persistent begging. Throughout this

fruit flies and probing and examining everything in the flight, including the

By JOHN V. DENNIS (Princess Anne, Maryland, USA)
What was my reaction when I first saw the ivory-bill? This is a question
that people not infrequently ask me and sometimes with a look of scepticism
on their faces. Everyone would like to see a living Ivory-billed Woodpecker
but few people believe that the bird still exists. Thus the very mention of
"ivory-bill" evokes the same kind of bemused doubt that greets a believer in
the Loch Ness monster or abominable snow man. This does not surprise me
since, when searching for the bird, I have often felt that I was looking for an
unseen presence. Yet this is a bird that I have seen severeal times, and to share
my experience with the ivory-bill and tell something of its past, present, and
uncertain future, I have brought together the following pages.
Audubon called the bird the "Van Dyke" because of its elegant attire. The
Indians, recognizing its other-worldly character, put a high value upon the
bill and feathers. These trophies were regarded much as wampum and used
as an article in trade. Mark Catesby, writing in 1731, stated that the Canadian
Indians make "coronets of 'em (the bills) for their princes and great warriors,
by fixing them round a wreath, with their points outward. " He went on to say
that the northern Indians purchased the bills from southern tribes for
anywhere from two to three buckskins a bill. A hundred years later the trade
was still underway. Audubon spoke of entire belts of Indian chiefs ornamented
with the feathers and bills of the ivory-bill.
As the years went by, the ivory-bill slowly gave way before the American
Indian, white settler, lumberman and, not least in importance, the museum
collector. Unlike the Pileated Woodpecker, Dryocopus pileatus which
superficially resembles it, the ivory-bill showed no tendency to adapt to
man. Wherever wilderness disappeared, the ivory-bill also disappeared.
Once widespread and found from the Ohio River and south-eastern North
Carolina to Florida and eastern Texas, the ivory-bill has steadily retreated.
The same process has repeated itself in Cuba where the insular race has
retired to the remotest mountains of Oriente Province.
By wilderness, I do not necessarily mean pristine wilderness with big
trees. I have good reason to believe that the ivory-bill is able to adapt to cut-
over timber. But the stumbling block is that it seems to require an ingredient
that is ever harder to find these days -- solitude. Wilderness filled with
hunters, fishermen and vactioners is incompatible with its needs.
Regarding size and general appearance, overall measurements considerably
exceed most of those found in the crow-sized, dark-plumaged Pileated
Woodpecker. The ivory-bill is a striking contrast in black and white. This is
evident both when the bird is at rest and when flying. The Pileated also
shows white in its wings when it is in flight, but the white is in different
places. A good look at the wing pattern of any North American woodpecker
as it flies is a valuable clue to its identity. Another helpful clue is that the

J. V. DENNIS - THE IVORY-BILLED WOODPECKER
ivory-billed and pileated are the only crested woodpeckers in North America.
Also useful if the all-white bill of the ivory-bill. However few of those
reporting an ivory-bill mention the bill. This is because the bird is usually
flying away from the observer and hence the bill is not visible.
A few other identifying features are worth mentioning. The flight of the
ivory-bill is straight and duck-like while that of the pileated is undulating
like most woodpeckers. The ivory-bill has a strange call note that has been
likened to the sound of a clarinet or tin trumpet, and also a conversational
chatter. Finally the ivory-bill does not drum in characteristic wood-pecker
fashion; its way of expressing itself is to make a double rap upon hollow
sounding objects.
So long as much of eastern North America was clothed by unbroken
forest, the ivory-bill was secure so far as food was concerned and safe from all
enemies except man. If dead trees and the beetle larvae they supplied (its
main source of food) became scarce, the ivory-bill moved to another part of
the forest. This was its habit. Essentially nomadic and moving from one area
of recently dead trees to another, it was not restricted by territorial boundaries.
Even when nesting, according to Dr James T Tanner, noted authority on the
ivory-bill, it roamed a territory of about 6 square miles.
Even before the forests were felled, the ivory-bill could not be regarded as
common. Early ornithologists were always thrilled by any experience they
might have with this strange, almost legendary bird. Alexander Wilson, on
slightly wounding an ivory-bill near Wilmington, North Carolina, took the
bird to his hotel room. During his absence the bird created considerable
havoc to the walls and furniture. Wilson was touched by this bird's piteous
calls.
By the early 1800's the ivory-bill seems to have retired to the deepest and
most remote swamps it could find. Whether the large timber of southern
swamps was always its home is not known. Very often its nesting site was a
hole in a cypress tree. On the other hand, it was sometimes observed
roaming pine forests in search of food. The Cuban race of the ivory-bill
seems to be primarily a bird of the pine forest. Perhaps persecution by man
drove the North American ivory-bill to the heavily timbered swamps that
blanket whole river valleys in parts of the south.
More than anything else the ivory-bill's call note was its undoing. As I
know from personal experience, the ivory-bill is extremely hard to locate
through vision alone. Its contrasting black and white plumage blends too
well into the lights and shadows of the forest where it makes its home. In the
words of Audubon, its eerie, oft repeated call note is the circumstance that
leads to its destruction. The call is so unmistakable and unlike other sounds
of the forest that anyone with a trained ear can quickly recognize the
presence of an ivory-bill. Tanner stated that all the ivory-bills he had ever
seen were first located by hearing the distinctive call note.
So few ivory-bills were reported after 1920 that many began to assume that
the bird was already extinct or was about to follow the Passenger Pigeon and

Carolina Parakeet into oblivion. But with the discovery of the ivory-bill in
the 80,000 acre Singer Tract in Louisiana in 1932 and reliable reports, at
about the same time, of the ivory-bill in the Santee Swamp in South
Carolina, there was a mild surge of optimism. Tanner, writing in 1941,
estimated that some 24 ivory-bills were left and these scattered in about five
areas in Louisiana, Florida, and possibly South Carolina. He admitted that
looking for an ivory-bill in the immense wooded swamps of the South was
like looking for "an animated needle in a haystack". I agree with this
statement and am inclined to believe that Tanner was much too cautious in
estimating ivory-bill numbers. The great difficulty in finding the bird,
coupled with uncertainty regarding sightings made by others, makes count-
ing ivory-bills a near hopeless task. Moreover failure to find the bird in a
given area is no proof that it is not there. This was a conclusion reached by
Arthur A Allen and Peter Paul Kellogg in relating their experiences with
the ivory-bill in Florida and Louisiana.
In 1934 the number of ivory-bills in the Singer Tract stood at a high of 18
birds, but in 1939 the number had fallen to 8. This decline had taken place
without logging and without any known persecution by man. Roger Tory
Peterson, visiting the Singer Tract in May of 1942, was elated to have caught
glimpses of two birds. A final sighting of a Singer Tract ivory-bill seems to
have been made in 1948. This was after the Tract had been heavily logged.
Much less is known of the occurrence of the ivory-bill in the Santee
Swamp of South Carolina. It was presumed that any birds along the lower
Santee vanished with the lumbering and hydro-electric development that
took place in this area in the late 1930's and early 1940's. Yet reports of ivory-
bill sightings continued to come in from the Santee and adjacent swamps
until about 1971.
There is a large element of uncertainty involved in judging reported
sightings of the ivory-bill. Many people jump to the conclusion that any
large woodpecker with some white on it is an ivory-bill. Only a good look,
with special attention to the wing pattern, can confirm the fact that the bird is
an ivory-bill and not a pileated. When in flight, the pileated shows a
considerable amount of white, especially on the under-surface of the wings.
There is also confusion with the much smaller Red-headed Woodpecker
Melanerpes erythrocephalus. Careless reports involving other species of
woodpeckers have done much to discredit the genuine report that now and
then comes to light. This situation has led some ornithologists to throw up
their hands and call all "ivory-bill sightings" cases of mistaken identity. As a
result there has never been any real programme instituted to save the ivory-
bill. The overly sceptical have seen to this
In the meantime, the insular race of the ivory-bill in Cuba has, if anything,
fared more poorly than the bird in North America. Even before 1900, it
appeared to be on the verge of extinction. In April of 1948, in company with
Davis Crompton of Worcester, Massachusetts, I visited Oriente Province at
the eastern end of Cuba in order to investigate rumours of the bird's

occurrence in remote mountain districts. We had luck beyond all expectations.
After searching fruitlessly for several days in big timber along stream valleys,
we shifted our attention to burned-over, cut-over pine forests. No sooner
had we entered a pine studded ravine several miles south of the small
lumbering town of Moa than we saw fresh diggings in dead trees. Later we
located an active nest site in a dead pine tree. The male and female of the pair
were taking turns on eggs. A third bird, possibly an offspring from a previous
nesting, lingered in the immediate vicinity. We returned from Cuba with
photographs of the birds as well as a skull of an ivory-bill found at the base of
the nest tree. The skull was deposited with the Museum of Comparative
Zoology at Harvard while an account of our expedition appeared in the
October 1948 issue of The Auk.
With the coming of the Fidel Castro regime a curtain fell on the future of
Cuba's few remaining ivory-bills. Luckily within the past few years Warren
B King of The International Council for Bird Preservation has established
correspondence with two Cuban ornithologists who have tried to follow the
fortunes of this bird. I am indebted to Dr King for sharing with me his most
recent correspondence from Cuba. Writingin June 1974,Orlando H Garrido
stated that he was afraid that no more than 6 or 8 pairs still existed. He based
his estimate largely upon the hope that an undiscovered population existed
in the mountains south of Moa. But he felt that the bird was near extinction
and that the problem lay more with intensive lumbering than persecution by
man. Luis S Varona, writing in July 1974, stated that the ivory-bill is fully
protected by wardens at two reserves and that the timber in these reserves is
also protected. He mentioned an ivory-bill sighting in May of 1972 and
another, at a different location, in November of 1973. Two reserves have
been established for the protection of the ivory-bill by the Cuban Academy
of Scienses. These are Cupeyal and Jaguani in Oriente Province.
On returning from Cuba, I came to know Herbert L Stoddard, a well-
known ornithologist, who was as familiar as anyone with the Ivory-billed
Woodpecker in Florida and Georgia. During four Florida boyhood years,
between 1896 and 1900, he had seen somewhere between 12 and 15 ivory-
bills. Stoddard did not agree with a view held by James Tanner that the
ivory-bill required virgin timber. He noted, for example, that a taxidermist
shot a pair of ivory-bills in 1924 in a tract of timber in Florida that had been
heavily cut over in 1904. Stoddard blamed the decline of the ivory-bill almost
entirely upon "the man with a gun." Although he was very close-mouthed, it
was well known in ornithological circles that Stoddard knew a great deal
about the recent whereabouts of the ivory-bill. I did learn this much from
him. He and a fellow passenger in a small plane circling over the Altamaha
River in Georgia during a thunderstorm clearly saw an ivory-bill in flight at a
distance of no more than 150 feet. The sighting was over the lower Altamaha
but no date was given. Probably it was in 1958 that Stoddard observed a pair
of ivory-bills in beetle-killed spruce pine near Thomasville, Georgia. In
Stoddard's autobiography MEMOIRS OF A NATURALIST published in 1969,

he states: "I have observed three ivory-bills in the Southeast in the last fifteen
years, and while these sightings are several years old, I feel quite confident
that the ivory-bill still has a chance to survive."
In early March of 1950, while a graduate student in ornithology at the
University of Florida, I joined another ardent ivory-bill searcher, Whitney
Eastman, on an expedition to the Chipola River in northwestern Florida.
Local woodsmen had reported the ivory-bill in swamps along the river. After
a day or two with Eastman and his party, I began to have misgivings about
the venture and thought it best to return to my studies at the University. To
my great surprise, a few days later newspaper accounts across the country
told of the rediscovery of the ivory-bill by Eastman and his party. A male
ivory-bill was said to have been seen on March 3rd and a female the following
day. In spite of a strong wish to believe this report, I found myself in the same
camp as the sceptics. Nevertheless I made a return trip to the region and
again saw nothing. Finally, in April of 1951, my luck along the Chipola took
a turn for the better. The same guide that had been with Eastman assured me
that he would show me an ivory-bill. "No siree, this ain't one of them good
gods," he said. "This here's an ivory-bill for sure."
When country people used to seeing the smaller woodpeckers saw the
much larger, more spectacular bird that was the Pileated Woodpecker, they
were apt to exclaim "Good God!" Hence this common name that was in use
in many parts of the South. The still more spectacular ivory-bill was sometimes
called the lord god.
My scepticism about the Chipola stemmed partly from exaggerated accounts
given by the guide. Whenever a large woodpecker showed itself in the
distance, it was always an ivory-bill. He even made the claim that ivory-bills
had once nested in a large magnolia tree by his cabin. I was encountering
what might be called "backwoods embellishment." Regardless of what it
was, the backwoodsman always felt compelled to elaborate beyond what
might be called the facts of the matter. He did not realize that the mere
existence of an ivory-bill was more exciting and more valuable than any story
he could possibly concoct. I was to meet this same kind of embellishment on
even a larger scale in the Big Thicket of Texas.
As it turned out, this time my guide used good judgement. I was left in a
rowboat, partially concealed by cypress trees, and within sight of a large dead
tree where an ivory-bill had reportedly been seen going to roost toward dusk.
As the minutes slowly ticked by, I began to feel a mounting excitement.
There was something to be said for the confident manner of my guide. It was
nearly dark when I was startled by the sound so well described as the tooting
of a child's tin trumpet. A few blasts came from the darkness beyond the
roost tree and then silence. I watched and listened for a while longer, and
then my guide appeared and took me back to camp. This, to my knowledge,
was the last time the Chipola offered any evidence of the ivory-bill.
During the fall of 1966, after a long absence from the search, O was again in
pursuit of the ivory-bill and this time in cut-over pine woods that reminded

me of the habitat I had seen in Cuba. On August 28 of that year, two eager
bird watchers from Chicago, Bedford P Brown, Jr. and Jeffrey R Sanders,
were driving east from Pensacola, Florida when they decided to leave the
coastal highway on the chance that they might sight a wild turkey. After
entering the wild, desolate fringes of Eglin Air Force Base, near Pensacola,
they came to a clear flowing stream where pine trees merged with creek
bottom hardwoods. On a sudden impulse, they got out of their car and stood
watching and listening at a narrow bridge. Suddenly the loud toots that I was
now familiar with came from out of the heavy growth that lined the stream.
In writing to me about this experience, Brown described what an eerie,
suspense filled few minutes they had until they caught sight of two large
woodpeckers scaling bark from trunks of beetle-infested pine trees. He went
on to say: "Our entire experience with the birds totalled only about 16
minutes. We have not the slightest doubt in our minds that the birds were
correctly identified as ivory-billed woodpeckers. In fact, I would go so far as
to say that the unique call note of the ivory-bill would make the identification
of the bird a simple matter for me."
I did not have the same luck. During the two weeks that I explored the area
where the Brown and Sanders sighting had been made, I stumbled upon a
secret weapon's testing site and had other close encounters with the military.
My conclusion, as I reported to the World Wildlife Fund, under whose
auspices I was conducting my search, was that the two men in question had
had the extremely good fortune to chance upon a pair of ivory-bills foraging
in recently beetle-killed pine trees.
I should not conclude my Florida accounts without saying something
about a bizarre occurrence involving what may have been ivory-bills at an
undisclosed location in Polk County north-west of Lake Okeechobee. I say
bizarre because the evidence gathered by the two searchers, H Norton Age.y
and George M Heinzmann, was so contradictory. Beginning in 1965, these
men, learning of a possible ivory-bill in a wooded tract on a large ranch,
began making frequent trips to the area. At first it was a game of hide-and-
seek with an unseen presence. Later they caught tantalizing glimpses of one
or two large woodpeckers that seemed to fit the description of an ivory-bill.
When a storm toppled a tree containing a large roost or nest hole, the men
retrieved two small fluffy blackish feathers and a white feather from the hole.
The feathers were sent to the Smithsonian Institution where the white
feather was identified by Dr Alexander Wetmore as that of an ivory-bill.
This should have clinched the matter. But then came disappointment. The
searchers submitted tapes of calls they thought were those of the ivory-bill.
The Cornell Laboratory of Ornithology reported back that the calls were
those of the Pileated Woodpecker. The findings of this strange case were
therefore inconclusive.
In December of 1966,1 turned my attention to the Big Thicket of Texas.
This heavily wooded area, with its swamps and upland forests of hardwoods
end pine, had long had a tradition of ivory-bill presence. But not since 1904

had there been a confirmed record. Where should I begin looking in an area
that contained approximately 500,000 acres?
But I did have one clue. The previous April, Mrs Olga Hooks Lloyd, well
known among Beaumont, Texas bird watchers, had reported to friends that
she had seen an ivory-bill in the Neches River swamp near the Steinhagen
Reservoir. Her description of the bird was so convincing that I decided to
concentrate my search in this area. It was a region of dark winding bayous,
trees laden with Spanish moss, and many trees dead and dying as a result of
flooding. Toward dusk, on the second day of my search, I was rewarded once
again with a nasal trumpet-like call that I decided could only be produced by
an Ivory-billed Woodpecker. Because of rain and impassable roads, I was
forced to postpone my search for a few days.
On December 10th, I had taken the same route twice along the edge of a
winding bayou without seeing or hearing anything encouraging. Then it
happened! The magnificent bird I had been searching for suddenly rose in
front of me. Sweeping majestically from where it apparently had been
feeding on the ground, it soon settled upon the trunk of an enormous cypress
tree. Before I could view it again with my binoculars, it had circled around to
the far side of the trunk and within seconds had taken flight to the dense
woodland on the far side of the bayou. I was exuberant; yet at the same time
disappointed over not having seen more of the bird. The black, chill waters
of the bayou were far from inviting. But after failing to find a way across, I
finally waded in and barely made the opposite bank without having to swim.
Donning my clothes, I set out in the direction the bird had taken. Soon I was
lucky enough |o see the ivory-bill perched on a stump and with wings
outspread as though protesting the nearby presence of other birds. Numerous
small birds and also a pair of Pileated Woodpeckers were in the immediate
vicinity. I had come upon one of those mixed flocks you find in the winter
woods. Although the light was poor, I got the general impression that the
crest of the bird was black, thus making it a female. The male ivory-bill has a
red crest.
Further search in Texas by myself and others has contained many
disappointments, glimpses of possible ivory-bills, unverified call notes, and
finally the recording of the ivory-bill calls on tape. This recording, which I
made on February 25, 1968, when searching for the ivory-bill under the
auspices of the National Geographic Society, has since been reported upon
favourably by Dr John William Hardy of the Florida State Museum. The
only reservation that Hardy first made after subjecting the tape to repeated
careful analyses was that there was a suggestion of Blue Jay Cyanocitta
cristata mimicry in the notes. He felt he could not rule out the possibility of a
Blue Jay having given a remarkably accurate rendition of the ivory-bill tin
trumpet call. But Hardy, after making spectographic and principal frequency
analyses of Blue Jay calls, has written me since that the Blue Jay calls bear no
resemblance to those of the ivory-bill. The notes I recorded that February
day, without seeing the bird that made them, have therefore been established

as those of the Ivory-billed Woodpecker. A tape had not been made of the
ivory-bill's voice since Allen and Kellogg of Cornell obtained the only
recording ever made in February of 1935. This was in the Singer Tract.
Knowledge of ivory-bill presence in the Big Thicket did much to spur
efforts toward the creation of a Big Thicket National Preserve. In October of
1974 a bill was passed by Congress and signed by the President creating a
Preserve of 84,550 acres. This acreage was not in one solid tract but in a
number of smaller tracts, thereby embodying the "string of pearls" concept.
This concept called for the preservation of isolated tracts of prime importance
throughout the Big Thicket.
What about the Big Thicket today? Has the saving of some wilderness and
continued logging and exploitation elsewhere affected the ivory-bill? Since
there are almost no figures to go upon, about all I can do is hazard a guess. I
am reasonably confident that the ivory-bill still holds on in parts of the Big
Thicket. Among a number of sightings in recent years that have come to my
attention, there is one by William Mounsey that deserves attention. In May,
1976, with a team from the University of the Wilderness in Colorado,
Mounsey set out to explore remaining ivory-bill habitat in the Big Thicket.
After visiting more southerly sections, the party reached the Steinhagen
Reservoir near where I made my sighting in December of 1966. Mounsey
with two other members of the party claim they saw a male ivory-bill in flight
on May 21. A second bird, or perhaps the same bird, was seen some 7 to 9
miles away by a member of the party on May 22.
If these reports are trustworthy, and I believe they are, the ivory-bill is
probably still holding on in the Big Thicket. This would be encouraging
news, for nowhere in presumed ivory-bill habitat has change come so
drastically and so quickly as in the Big Thicket. The whole character of this
once great wilderness is changing and no one knows what effect this may
have upon the several endangered species of the area.
Turning to Louisiana, where ivory-bill history was made during the days
of the Singer Tract, I can find much the same story that I found in the Big
Thicket. The tradition of former ivory-bill presence is strong while every so
often a hopeful report comes to light. Probably the river swamps of southern
Louisiana and nearby Mississippi are as likely places as any to look for the
Ivory-billed Woodpecker at the present time.
One of the most extraordinaty ivory-bill stories every to my way of thinking,
came out of a Louisiana swamp a few years ago. A business man was in the
habit of training his hunting dogs in the Atchafalaya Swamp which lies about
20 miles west of Baton Rouge, the city where he lived. He knew something
about birds and more than once spotted a large woodpecker flying away in
the distance that reminded him of pictures he had seen of the ivory-bill. He
took the matter to someone he already knew who was an authority on birds.
This was Dr George Lowery, foremost Louisiana ornithologist and a pioneer
in finding and learning about the ivory-bill in the Singer Tract. As Lowery
knew fron long experience reports of this kind were all too often based upon

mistaken identification. Therefore he treated the man's reports with the
scepticism he thought they deserved.
Lowery's acquaintance did not give up. He began taking a camera along
with him into the swamp. Then came the day he had been waiting for. The
date was 22 May 1971. This time the birds --a pair of them --were closer
than ever before. Trying to create as little disturbance as possible, he
returned to his car in order to cage his dogs and thn he began stalking one of
the birds with his small camera. By this time the female ivory-bill had
disappeared, but the male, occupied at a hole about 40 feet up on a tree trunk,
gave him his opportunity. He had time to click off a single shot with his
camera, and then another one after the bird moved to a second tree. Overjoyed,
he returned to Baton Rouge with the proof that would convince his friend.
This time Lowery was impressed. He returned to the spot with the man
but failed on this trip and succeeding ones in finding an ivory-bill. Nevertheless
he put enough confidence in the man's sincerity and the photographs (poor
though they were) to give this sighting discrete publicity. A brief account of
the event, that appeared in the October 1971 issue of AMERICAN BIRDS,
contained neither the photographs, the name of the man, nor even the name
of the swamp. Apparently Lowery was afraid that the photographs, because
of their poor quality, would not be accepted as valid evidence. Indeed this
proved to be the case. The photographs were passed around to a number of
fellow ornithologists. The comment was highly unfavourable ranging from
scepticism to charges of outright fraud so far as the dog trainer was con-
cerned.
But no one should write off the Atchalafaya swamp, a heavily forested
bottomland, lying parallel to the Mississippi River and measuring about 30
miles in width and 100 miles in length.
Although heavily cut-over and bearing little resemblance to Tanner's
description of ideal ivory-bill habitat, it almost certainly supports, or has
supported, a number of Ivory-billed Woodpeckers. Dr Lowery told me
personally that one of his students in November 1967 had identified an
ivory-bill in the Atchafalaya Swamp. Then came the much disputed
photographs, which, if anything, seemed to create more scepticism than
ever. But almost overlooked in connection with this controversy is a brief
note that appeared in a 1975 issue of AMERICAN BIRDS. Only these facts
were stated: on 11 November 1974 an observer, Robert Bean, sighted an
ivory-bill in flight when driving along a main highway some 20 miles west of
Baton Rouge. Bean, the note went on to say, had identified the bird on the
basis of its characteristic wing pattern.
Mr. Bean, who is director of the Louisville Zoo, kindly responded to
questions I asked him about his sighting. Driving eastward in a lorry over a
long bridge across the Atchalafaya swamp, he suddenly saw directly in front
of him an ivory-bill flying at car-top level. The bird, no more than 15 feet
away, was flying across the highway. During the five seconds or so that the
bird was in view, he saw it barely clear the guard rail and then alight in a tree

at the edge of the swamp. He couldn't stop because of the traffic and the
added hazard of having a cargo of zoo animals in his lorry. Sure of his
identification, he told his extraordinary story to Burt Monroe, a well-known
ornithologist living in Kentucky. Hence the bare details that reached
AMERICAN BIRDS. The record takes on added significance when it is
realized that the sighting was made in the same general part of the swamp
that had witnessed the photographic attempts by Lowery's friend.
What of the future of this rarest of the rarae aves} Has the bird a chance
when wilderness is ever in shorter supply and few will even admit that the
bird exists? While I have no great reason for optimism, I am encouraged by
the many efforts now underway to preserve southern swamps. As more such
lands come under protection, the ivory-bill may yet find the food, shelter,
and solitude it needs. Let us hope that it is not too late.

Amazona leucocephala palmarum
By Ramon NOEGEL. (Seffner, Florida).
Here at the New Age Ranch we are often asked what is the difference
between the nominate race A.l. leucocephala and the Isle of Pines Amazon.
Since we have only the existing captive collection of the various representa-
tives of this group, with the exclusion of bahamensis , we will try to give a good
comparison. I have personally had specimens of both the Cuban and the Isle
of Pines subspecies in my possession since 1946. The Cuban Amazon was the
first large parrot I ever owned and has remained my favourite ever since. In
1946 they were the cheapest Amazon on the market and we had two lovely
examples. Many of our Cuban neighbours had these parrots and I suppose
there were as many as sixty here in Tampa at that time. It was not uncommon
to see them in their cages on front porches or on balconies of apartments in
the downtown Latin quarter.
Palmarum , has a deeper scarlet red on the throat and cheeks whereas the
nominate race has more of a pink cast in this area of colour. This holds true
for the Bahamas' representatives of leucocephala also. Therefore we might
say the farther east in range, the more pink the colour of the throat and
cheeks, whereas the further west and south, the deeper the red. The vinaceous
is richer and more pronounced, often verging on a purple appearance. This
colour is more accented with black edging on each feather than in the Cuban
Amazon. In the Isle of Pines Amazon both sexes are equally the same in the
deep scarlet throat colouring. In the Cuban the throat and cheeks of the male
during breeding season are a deeper hue than is evident in the female. Due to
the heavy black edging on the green feathers, palmarum appears a darker
green. It is a slightly larger parrot than its Cuban neighbour. The eye ring is
larger and the white on the crown is more extensive. In most specimens there
is a pink feather in the black ear coverts or just above or behind them in the
green feathers. There is of course much individualism due to age and
genetics. However, in both the Cuban and Isle of Pines Amazons there is less
variability than may be witnessed in both the Cayman Islands Amazons
caymanensis and hesterna.
Before the depletion of the species on Cuba, well over a thousand species
were annually shipped to England, Europe and the United States. By the
I940's the parrot hunters began turning their attention to the Isle of Pines for
a better source of supply. The island at that time was mainly used for
agriculture and there still existed vast forested areas where the parrot's
habitat remained secure. Their nests were usually in the bowl of a dead
Royal Palm where a woodpecker had previously nested. The parrots would
simply enlarge the existing accommodation by digging and chewing out the
soft fibre of these decaying palms.

R. NOEGEL - ISLE OF PINES AMAZON
It has been my good fortune to know personally two of the old time parrot
hunters from the Isle of Pines. Both fled the Isle when the Communists took
over the government of Cuba. It has been from these two men that we have
been able to obtain much valuable information regarding this Amazon. Our
breeding pair of palmarum were brought to this country by one of these
hunters. They were among the few personal treasures he was permitted to
leave with, and he was allowed to bring them into the U.S.A. as his pets. We
obtained them from him only after much persuasion. At that time they had
been in his possession nearly twenty years.
He related that it was not uncommon for him to have as many as one
hundred of these baby Amazons which he hand fed on cooked corn meal and
banana. This substance was fed to the young in an almost liquid form and
they thrived on it. Its nutritional value may be questioned but one cannot
deny there are quite a few of these Amazons in existence which are past thirty
years of age and still going strong. All of our original Cubans and Isle of Pines
Amazons are well over twenty years of age. Most were brought to this
country before Castro came into power. This seems to have been the same
diet for young Amazons raised in Cuba before their decline made the
continued taking of parrot young unprofitable. My friends explained to me
that both the procedure of taking young Amazons from their nests and the
type of food used are age old traditions that originated in Cuba and were
handed down from father to son in typical Latin fashion.
Generally speaking the parrot hunters were farmers who sold young
Amazons to supplement their meagre income. Areas were staked off so that
each hunter was allowed a fair share of the breeding places frequented by
these birds. It was of course illegal to take parrots from a fellow hunter's area
but many a shrewd rogue would rob eggs from his neighbours' nests and
place them in nests within his boundary thus causing parent birds to raise six
young instead of the usual four found in the average clutch. I was further
informed that individuals showing the most colour potential were of greater
value when sold in Cuba. This, therefore, doubtless caused a tremendous
drain on the more colourful birds and would in time influence a trend to less
colourful specimens in the future generations.
This is the prime reason, no doubt, for the two specimens having been
kept by one of these hunters and which we now have. They are both
endowed with extreme colouring in the red factor. The hen has red all the
way down her throat and on to her breast and thence a splash continuing
down her left side on the abdomen which cuts clearly through the vinaceous.
The cock, likewise, is well marked with red, having his entire mantle from
wing to wing in this colour. I was told such colouring was not uncommon
when my hunter friend was a child sixty years ago. There were many Cuban
Amazons kept here in Tampa when I was growing up but I never saw any so
brilliantly coloured as these and rather suspect that the average Isle of Pines
Amazon was more brilliantly coloured a hundred years ago.
During my four month stay on Cayman Brae I learned from the senior Mr

Lazzari, then eighty-four years of age, that his father came from Cuba and
was accustomed to taking young parrots from their nests on Cayman Brae.
He would then row out to passing ships and barter the parrots for flour, sugar
and cloth, all scarce items on this small out-of-the-way island. This seems to
be the only incident of parrot hunting for commercial purposes on Cayman
Brae. Undoubtedly Mr Lazzari had learned the value of the parrot trade
before emigrating from Cuba to Cayman Brae in the nineteenth century.
There is reliable information that leads us to believe that this beautiful
Amazon has been traded in for well over two hundred years. Certainly it was
one of the better known New World parrots in England and Europe in the
eighteenth century.
While neither the Cuban nor the Isle of Pine Amazons are entering the
U. S. , due to the political situation as well as to being on the endangered
species list, they are still flowing regularly into Europe, especially into
communist countries. We recently had a letter from a gentleman in Switzerland
who purchased a pair in Austria while on a business trip. There are a number
of these parrots now being listed in the census section of the International
Zoo yearbook. For the most part these are in communist zoos. The Moscow
Zoo reports a breeding success, but designates it to be with the sub-species
from Cuba, not palmarum. Therefore, we may well be the first to have bred
this subspecies in captivity.
To date, we have bred eight specimens, two in 1975, three in 1977, and
three in 1978. All are as extremely coloured as the parent birds. This is
especially so with the 1977 hatch which have the vinaceous well up to the
breast area and the red already extending well down on to the breast. When
they reach maturity they will no doubt be more striking in appearance than
the parents. I recall purchasing a young Cuban from the last clutch raised by
Velma McDaniels. While already a very beautiful specimen when it arrived,
it blossomed, so to speak, overnight when it reached four years of age. The
white and pink on the head and throat increased noticeably during the fourth
year.
Both the Cuban and the Isle of Pines Parrots are very active and constantly
curious when anyone is in their area. Ever ready to encourage a handout,
they fly back and forth or sway to and fro on the perch to attract attention.
Unlike the Cayman Island Amazons they are not prone to obesity, being far
too active for that. The Grand Cayman Island subspecies is a slow mover and
would rather just perch than move about, being only stirred when food is
placed in its aviary. We noticed this trait during our many visits to the
Cayman Islands and especially during the four months I lived there in 1976.
Like its Cuban neighbour, the Isle of Pines Amazon lays four to five eggs
in a clutch. Caymanensis has two to four eggs per clutch while hesterna from
Cayman Brae produces the smallest clutches consisting of only one to three
eggs. This last reference is from observation of three nests in the field and
from our two laying hens here on the Ranch. From information gained from
two of our members whom we sent to the Bahamas, bahamensis averages four

eggs to a clutch. Incubation period is twenty-eight days. The young are well
feathered when seven weeks old and starting to sample soft foods about this
time. They are usually completely feeding on their own by ten weeks of age.
Today the Isle of Pines has become a kind of incubator for Cuba's post-
revolutionary generation, boasting over twenty boarding schools which are
spread over the island. Some twenty thousand students attend these schools
and work in the citrus groves following school hours. There are also four
schools for African students and one for Ethopian children. In keeping with
the island's conversion from an agricultural community to a training centre,
the local authorities want to change its name to the "Isle of Youth."
We can well imagine what this sudden modernization will do \.o palmar urn's
habitat. While there are still vast wilderness areas in Cuba, we cannot hope
for such on the Isle of Pines. Captive breeding will eventually be the only
solution for the continued propagation of many of the Caribbean Islands
parrots. Under-developed countries cannot be expected to concern themselves
with the welfare of parrots when they are more pressed with the problem of
feeding their peopl. Conservation of wildlife in distant regions sounds all
well and good as we sit in our cosy homes being well fed, but it is an almost
impossible probability, especially on small islands where land is at a premium.
We simply must come to understand and recognize the fact that many
species of wild life simply cannot survive in their native habitat. If we wait
for under-developed countries to acquire a concern for their natural wildlife,
we will see many unique species disappear.
It has been our intention from that start of our breeding project (1966) of
rare and endangered Caribbean Amazons to place the young with qualified,
experienced aviculturalists and zoos. Beginning last year (1977) we have to
date distributed five pairs of the leucocephala group to different zoos and
individuals here in Florida. All these were offspring from our breeding pairs
of palmarum, caymanensis and leucocephala. If we can, in time, distribute
enough of these unusual and beautiful Amazons for future captive breeding
colonies, we may well have been the instrument of saving them from total
extinction. To my knowledge, we are the only ones to have ever bred
caymanensis and palmarum in captivity and the only ones currently breeding
the nominate race in the U.S. We have the only captive group of hesterna
outside their native island and at the time of writing this article one of our
three pairs is incubating two fertile eggs, so we hope for success with this
smallest representative and the most threatened of the leucocephala group.

Introduction
Of the many external factors controlling reproduction in birds, light has
long been considered a primary factor. Much of the experimental work and
field studies have concerned temperate zone birds. Many of these investigations
were stimulated by Rowan's (1925) original discoveries and later work.
However, as noted by Marshall (1959) Rowan's work so dramatically empha-
sized the importance of light, that people lost sight of other factors which are
also extremely important. These include temperature, food availability and
rainfall, not perhaps rainfall per se , but the environmental changes that occur
because of rain.
Hall (1970) in a study of Ploceine weavers, while acknowledging that in
many tropical species, the start of breeding and onset of rainfall are
synchronized, found that later stages of reproduction were due to social
factors. The early experimental work on the effects of light on reproduction,
resulted in the use of extended artificial lighting for commercial poultry egg
production. Later the domesticated Japanese Quail, Coturnix c.japonica , was
used in the laboratory and egg production was enhanced by the same
methods.
For the aviculturist in the U.K. it has been standard practice to keep
foreign birds in heated or 'frost proof' quarters with or without artificial light
during the winter. The birds are released into outside aviaries for breeding,
usually from the period May/June until about September. Some aviculturists
have used artificial light and heat to breed birds during the winter, breeders
of the Gouldian Finch among them. It has long been noted that some foreign
birds, especially the Gouldian and other Australian finches, attempt to breed
in the winter months, reproduction still being synchronized with their feral
breeding period. This was more marKed with the Gouldian Finch when these
birds were still imported from Australia; Boosey (1962) mentions this problem
with Gouldians. In this paper 14 years data are given on breeding results from
birds kept in outside planted aviaries from April to November, without
artificial heat or lighting. The data and number of species are limited because
of my former practice of using the period of May/June until September for
breeding. To date, if severe weather occurs before November, the birds are
removed to heated quarters with artificial light.
Comments on Housing and Diet
The aviaries have soil floors and are planted with privet bushes, clumps of
gorse are hung up at various heights to provide nesting sites and cover and a
wide variety of nesting receptacles is provided. The only other primary
factor over which the author has control is food supply. Although all the

species, in avicultural terms, can be classed as 'seed eaters', in my experience
few of them will successfully breed, or even maintain top condition in the
long term, without live food or high protein supplement. The doves may be
considered exceptions in this respect, but these have occasionally been seen
to eat insects, maggots and other invertebrates. Another variable is the
decline in the number of 'natural' insects available in the aviaries, as the
weather becomes colder.

The data are presented in a crude form, as a statement of which birds bred in
the period April to November, and which species bred successfully in a
period of declining daylight, from the summer solstice onwards. The species
which attempted to breed but were unsuccessful are also recorded.
Rearing means that the parent birds reared the young to independence.
As can be seen from the table, twelve of the fifteen small passerine species
bred successfully from June onwards, and six species reared young as late as
the Oct/Nov period. Of the two Quail species, both reared young after June,
and one reared young in Sept/Oct. In the Columbidae , all five species were
the most consistent breeders after June, even as late as the Oct/Nov period.
The single species of Hemipode (Bustard Quail), reared young in Aug/Sept
period:

The exclusion of data from birds outside of the April -- November group,
has resulted in limited data in some species and a chance bias towards the
Ethiopian faunal region. Of the Ethiopian small passerines, the most notable
late breeders are the Pytilias and Green Singing Finches, the records of both
include data from captive bred pairs. The Cut-throat and Cordon-bleus,
although breeding late were represented by single pairs. The only small
passerine from the Oriental region, the Red Avadavat, was a late breeder.
Of the two quail species, the Oriental Chinese Painted Quail bred
successfully no later than August, but the Ethiopian Harlequin reared young
as late as October; however the Harlequin data were obtained from more pairs
including captive bred birds. The five species of doves, three Neotropical
and two Ethiopian, all reared young as late as Oct/Nov. This is probably due
to the production of crop-milk, giving the doves independence from live
food for rearing young. It has long been accepted that the Cape Dove, O.
capensisy is not the easiest dove to breed, aviculturists find them susceptible
to cold and uncertain breeders. It is interesting to note the success of this
species in rearing young so late in the year.
If one tries to correlate late breeding in captivity with a given species, such
as the Green Singing Finch, to periods of feral breeding in the country of
origin, various problems are evident. The distribution of S. mozambicus

J. TROLLOPE - BREEDING RESULTS AND PHOTOPERIOD
covers a vast geographical region, months of breeding in different areas show
considerable variation. Mackworth -- Praed &amp; Grant (1960) record nearly
every month of the year for the breeding of three subspecies of S. mozambicus
in Eastern and North-Eastern Africa. Roberts (1961) records the period
November to March, for Southern Africa. Therefore without a sure knowledge
of the subspecies involved and area of origin, it is only an assumption from
such limited data as mine, that these Serins are retaining their feral breeding
period in captivity, at least for imported and second generation stock.
Another factor is that so many tropical and sub-tropical species are apparently
opportunistic breeders with rainfall initiating the start of the reproductive
cycle. However, it is apparent that in an average season in Southern England
established foreign 'seedeaters' can successfully rear young in a period of
declining photoperiod and temperature. The reason for this I would suggest,
is the hopefully 'optimal' and constant food supply available.
Summary

<listItem confidence="0.774665714285714" page_id="56283538"  page_num="92" year="" vol="">
1) Limited data are presented from 14 years' breeding records of foreign
'seed-eating' birds, kept without artificial light and heat in outside aviaries
from April to November in Southern England.
2) From a total of fifteen passerine species, twelve bred successfully from
June onwards and six of these reared young as late as October/November.
3) Two quail species both bred successfully after June, one reared young in
September/October.
4) Five species of doves reared young as late as October/November. The
production of crop-milk giving the doves independence from live food for
rearing young, is suggested as the reason for late successful breeding in
Columbidae.
5) A single Hemipode species, reared young from June onwards until
September.

CITRON-CRESTED COCKATOOS IN SUMBA
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.99697030952381" page_id="56283539"  page_num="93" year="" vol="">
By S. B. KENDALL (Chertsey, Surrey)
As some members of the Society may be aware I have kept and bred the
Citron-crested Cockatoo Cacatua sulphurea citrinocristata (Fraser) continuously
for about twenty years. It is, to my mind, by far the most attractive subspecies
of C. sulphurea, which occurs throughout Australasia, the crest being quite
differently coloured from any other I have seen. According to the literature it
is confined to Sumba, one of the most southerly of the "Eastern Islands" of
Indonesia and I think this is correct.
For a year during 1977--1978 I worked in Indonesia, mostly in Sulawesi
(Celebes) and in February of 1978 was able to visit Sumba. Although the trip
occupied ten days, opportunities for bird watching were extremely limited,
an unusually large amount of time being taken up with travel or waiting for
transport. There are in fact regular flights from Denpasar in Bali but
weather conditions can disrupt travel and within the island itself travel can
be difficult (I spent about 14 hours covering 60 kilometres on one occasion,
this including leaving my lorry in the middle of a river). Nevertheless the few
hours available for bird watching resulted in some memorable views of the
Citron-crested cockatoo.
On arrival at Waingapu in the Island I made enquiries about cockatoos and
was told that they could indeed be seen on the outskirts of the town and were
locally hated because of their depredations on the maize crops. I was told also
that these birds had sulphur crests exactly the same as those found on the
other islands. This proved to be incorrect but caused me some concern
particularly because an otherwise remarkably informative article of the last
century which I have among my books (Doherty, W. 1891) said the same.
Leaving Waingapu in the east of the island I travelled south-east to a place
near the coast called Melalo, where I spent two nights. As night approached
it was apparent that the small patch of original (?) forest on the edge of which
I was staying was a roost for cockatoos (I was unable to see the colour of the
crest in flight) and also for another large parrot which at the time I was
unable to identify, but which later proved to be an Eclectus, presumably the
Sumba subspecies.
I arranged to spend about three hours from daybreak, until I had to work,
in the forest with a local man who, it was insisted, was to protect me from the
python^. He proved a pleasant character who kept quiet if only because my
Indonesian is very poor and my knowledge of local languages, needless to
say, is non-existent. The forest was moderately dense with numerous very
tall (30 metres?) trees in the tops of which were Citron-crests beautifully
displayed in the early morning sunshine and Eclectus parrots in pairs. The
hens appeared through my binoculars to be plain red; the cocks green with a
little blue in the wing and one or two so dark as to be reasonably described as
black. I considered the possibility that these were rain-drenched ordinary

cockatoos but doubt it.
During the night I had been aware of what seemed to be an unreasonable
amount of cockatoo shouting from the roost and the reason became plain
when we came upon two locals who had been engaged in catching the birds.
The technique was to place a stick with a series of nylon nooses in the tops of
the roosting trees in the evening and to recover the birds in the morning after
a night presumably suspended upsidedown. The nooses were definitely
nylon not wire and I do not know whay the captives did not bite their way to
freedom.
Three out of four recent captures were mature hens which might well have
been breeding, for the birdcatchers said that they were going up one of the
tall trees in the late afternoon to get a young Eclectus parrot, about which
they knew, from a nest hole. I arranged to accompany them but only to the
base of the tree! However, in the early afternoon the skies opened and rain
descended in quantities that ensured that for the period few living things left
shelter and at first light next morning I had to return to Waingapu.
Obviously from such a brief acquaintance with the Citron-crested Cockatoo
I learnt very little but Sumba is not a place to which many people are likely to
travel and a few comments from one who has been there may be of interest.
My experiences were confined to aerial views (small aircraft, low altitude) of
the north coast approaching Sumba from Bali in the west and flying overland
from Waingapu in the east to Waikelo in the west which took me over the
centre of the island, and to ground travel which was confined to the eastern
part of the island.
It is just possible that the cockatoo occurs on some tiny islands like Sabu
but I doubt it and I feel that the future of this very beautiful bird is very
insecure. It is clearly being exploited by the bird-catchers. Tall forest trees,
which it surely needs for nesting, are confined as far as I could see to hill tops
and ravines, most of the island being covered with stony pasture. According
to what I was told, deforestation started a very long time ago. Sandal-wood
trees, if they ever occurred in large quantities are now said to be virtually
extinct. Serious erosion, in my observation, was occurring down the ravines
and the shallow estuarine waters were mud-stained far out to sea.
This is a situation about which we can all feel sad. Unfortunately nobody
with much personal experience of such places finds it easy to propose a
remedy.

NOTES FROM A KENYAN COLLECTION
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.98111868292683" page_id="56283541"  page_num="95" year="" vol="">
By MALCOLM Ellis (Wadebridge, Cornwall)
Some while after my account of the breeding of the Red-headed Blue-bill
Spermophaga ruficapilla in Mr Syd Downey's aviaries at Langata, Kenya
(A.M. vol. 83, pp. 124--125), he wrote to inform me that the bird bred, a
male, had died. Much to Mr Downey's regret, he failed to separate the
young male from its parents, as soon as it was old enough to look after itself.
He returned from a short safari, to find the young male, dead: it appeared to
have been killed -- presumably by its father. Shortly afterwards, the adult
male was among several birds which died, Mr Downey thought, as a result of
being poisoned, either from the chlorination of the water supply or possibly
as a consequence of cattle dip getting into the supply, which originates from a
stream used by the local Masai. This view was reinforced by the fact, that at
the same time, a neighbour's goldfish died.
Because of the Kenya Government ban on all hunting and trapping, etc.,
there was considerable difficulty obtaining another male, as a mate for the
female Red-headed Blue-bill. It was not until July 1978, that one was
obtained. On September 17th, the pair were observed to be nesting -- the
male and female taking turns on the nest. This continued for approximately
3 weeks, after which both birds were observed off the nest. On October 27th,
two young, which were both able to fly, were seen for the first time. Later, Mr
Downey, was surprised and delighted to find, that there was in fact, three
young blue-bills. He states, that it would appear that approximately 6 weeks
elapse, from the time of nesting, to the time when the young leave the nest.
As on past occasions, the pair of Red-headed Blue-bills were provided
with a large armful (about 2 cubic feet (0.056 cubic metres)) of dry grass.
This was placed about 4 feet (1.219 metres) from the ground, supported by
branches, in a dark corner. Mr Downey, feels sure that this, combined with
segregation (providing the pair with an aviary to themselves), will be successful,
if anyone else cares to give it a try.
Another notable success was the breeding of a Ross's Turaco Musophaga
rossae. At the time of Mr Downey's first letter, the young turaco was almost
indistinguishable from its parents and readily joined in the family 'duets'. A
further letter informed me that the pair of Ross's Turacos had nested again
and hatched two chicks, but for some reason neither survived. They appeared
to have been sat on too heavily and, Mr Downey, wondered, if the nest which
he arranged for them, was too cup-shaped. He added, he knows, that in the
wild, the nest is a bare, flat platform.
According to Mr Downey, his Tambourine Doves Turtur tympanistria,
never stop nesting: so much so, that he has been forced to consider releasing
some. His Tambourine Doves, in common with the Red-headed Blue-bills,
like a dark area in which to nest. Other species which have recently bred,

include, the Chestnut Weaver Ploceus rubiginosus, Speke's Weaver P. spekei }
Lemon Dove Aplopelia larvata and Crowned Lapwing or Plover Vanellus
coronatus. The last, as it always does in the wild, nested right out in the open.
The nest was merely a shallow depression in the soil. Two eggs were laid and
both birds took turns to sit for the incubation period of 28 days. The young
grew at a remarkable rate and were soon indistinguishable from their parents.
The plovers are fed minced meat, hard-boiled egg and mealworms, and, of
course, catch other insects for themselves.
Mr Downey, has obtained and tamed two Speckled Mousebirds Colius
striatus. He writes, that if they are taken from the nest when very young, they
are easily tamed and make delightful pets, which want to be with you all the
time; he adds, that children love them.

I am very pleased to report that 1978 was another year of success with the
breeding of Stanley Cranes at Haughton and five were bred.
Our pair laid the first egg on 5th June and did not lay a second, so I decided
to put this under a broody bantam on 8th June but the egg turned out to be
infertile. The next eggs were produced on 24th and 27th June, and were put
under broody bantams on 27th June. It is interesting to note that in 1977 the
first egg was laid on 10th May but in 1978 on 5th June. I can only presume
that this was due to the late spring. The fact that we did not allow the cranes
to sit on the eggs did not seem to put them off laying.
Again this year we removed the newly-hatched cranes and put them along
with a day-old chicken under artificial heat (250w. infra-red light) as we
believe that the chicken teaches the crane to eat.

REPORT ON THE BIRD COLLECTION AT

More birds than any other group of animals were purchased this year and
successful hatchings numbered 122.
During the winter months, three Jackass Penguins Spheniscus demersus
were hatched and our small colony now comprises 7 males, 8 females and 3
unsexed young. Three species not previously bred in the collection were a
Barn Owl Tyto alba , from parents bought only 2 months earlier, a Common
Coucal Centropus sinensis and a Sarus Crane Grus antigone. The latter was
hatched, incredibly, under a small 'broody' bantam and appeared to thrive
until at the age of 2 months it became apparent that the bones of the legs were
failing to develop satisfactorily. Sadly, the condition was considered incurable
and the bird was humanely destroyed.
13 Monk Parakeets Myiopsitta monachus were successfully hatched and
reared and we now have 24 of these birds, some of which we hope to release
in the grounds during 1979. Other notable hatchings include 13 Crested
Quail Doves Geotrygon versicolor and 6 Blue-eared Glossy Starlings Lampro-
tornis chalybaeus , the parents of which have been rearing clutches twice
annually for the past five years.
62 Blue Peafowl Pavo cristatus are presently roaming the Zoo and
surrounding woodlands, but it is worth recording that losses to predators
during 1978 average out at 2 birds per month. In addition, 18 other birds
were also taken by foxes. These comprised 10 waterfowl, 6 Turkeys Meleagris
gallopavo , 1 Helmet Guineafowl Numida meleagris and a Crowned Crane
Balearica p.pavonina which had lived here for over 19 years. A feature of the
collection several years ago was the large number of Red Junglefowl Gallus
g.gallus roaming the grounds in company with the Peafowl. These too all fell
victims to the fox, but next year, as a result of over 20 successful hatchings
from captive stock, further birds will be released.
33 Waterfowl were acquired during 1978 including 3 Blue-winged Geese
Cyanochen cyanoptera, 4 Laysan Tea \ Anas platyrhynchos laysanensis. 3 Ruddy
Sheld Duck Tadorna ferruginea and a Canvasback Duck Aythya valisineria for
pairing. 'Paddock' birds purchased were 2 Demoiselle Crane Anthropoides
virgo, 2 White Stork Ciconia ciconia and at long last a hen Kori Bustard
Ardeotis kori for our widowed cock. As well as the Barn Owls mentioned
earlier, two other species bought were a pair of Little Owls A thene noctua and
a male Spotted Little Owl Athene brama for pairing with our only female at
the Tropical House.
Parrot arrivals included a pair of the beautiful Sun Parakeet Aratinga

REPORT ON THE SOCIAL MEETING - 15th MAY, 1979

Breeding Kestrels was the subject of an illustrated talk by James
Kirkwood at the recent joint meeting of the Avicultural Society and the
Hawk Trust held at Burlington House, Piccadilly. Mr. Kirkwood said that
breeding birds of prey is a young branch of aviculture. He was breeding
Kestrels not for release (only two or three British species benefit from a
breeding and release scheme) but to monitor their food intake.
Regarding our native birds of prey, he said that there was a need for
accurate surveys of populations and ecological requirements, provision of
nesting sites and, in winter, of food; wardening to reduce disturbance
(especially for Kites, Peregrines and Golden Eagles) and a need to educate
the public.
Preparatory to breeding from his Kestrels, he cuts their talons in February
and examines them to make certain they are in good health. To prevent
aggression male and female are placed in the breeding aviary at the same
time.
The aviary is of the "skylight and seclusion" kind; the sides are covered
and there is no direct sunlight. The floor covering is partly of gravel and
sand, and gravel aids the birds' digestion. There are few perches and these
are placed where they are needed most. The floor covering is of grass and
low shrubs and therefore requires little maintenance.
There are peep holes so that the birds can be watched unobserved.
A food platform is not provided because the Kestrels would immediately
remove food placed on such a platform; instead, the food is thrown in the
grass. For this species a low perch is required for successful copulation,
during which the male extends his wings upwards. Eggs are laid on a gravel
and sand mixture in the nest-boxes; the incubation period is 28 days and
the usual clutch numbers four to seven.
Incubation is carried out by the female; an interesting slide depicted the
large brood patch of an incubating bird. Males incubate for a few minutes
while the female is feeding.
A sequence of slides showed a chick at various ages; at one day, its eyes
were open and it had a thin covering of down. At two to four days, chicks
can sit on their haunches. By 11 days they are able to maintain their body
heat and the primaries are appearing. By 14 days they have a thick covering
of down and are eating four voles each per day. At 18 days they are able to
stand. Maximum food consumption occurs at 10 days, when they are
consuming 60 per cent of their weight daily.
Mr. Kirkwood has found that in cold weather Kestrels require little extra
food, in comparison with teal or geese, for example; thus they are well
adapted to our climate, Females increase in weight during the breeding
season, especially in captivity when they weigh up to 300g.
The probable reason why the female is larger is that she is therefore able
to store more body fat.

On the subject of rearing Kestrels, Mr. Kirkwood said that from the age
of four days they are fed on whole minced mice and that they cast pellets
from the age of five days. Prior to this they are fed on strips of meat with no
bone, given with the aid of a pair of tweezers.
It is possible that the ratio of females to males hatched is as high as 2:1.
James Kirkwood's talk was followed by an enlightening lecture on avian
pathology, especially that applicable to Birds of Prey, by John Cooper,
MRCVS, author of Veterinary Aspects of Birds of Prey. Many interesting
slides provided the audience with a better understanding of the subject.

HIGHLAND WILDLIFE by RICHARD PERRY.
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.997903131578947" page_id="56283547"  page_num="101" year="" vol="">
Published by Groom Helm, London. 1979. 202 pages, 16 black and white
photos. Price #6.95.
This is an account of wildlife on upper Speyside in the highlands of
Scotland, and comes from observations made during the seventeen years or
so that the author lived there. It is described as an extensively revised,
augmented and up-dated edition of IN THE HIGH GRAMPIANS, which
has long been unavailable. It includes new chapters on deer, dragonflies,
birds of prey, the Dipper and some of what it calls the summer-resident
waders. From the Preface, it would seem that material for these chapters has
come from writing by the author, which has appeared in several popular
publications.
More than half of the book's twenty-eight chapters are mainly about birds.
These include the Crossbill, Ring Ouzel, many of the birds which live along
and on the River Spey and on the Cairngorms, where among the breeding
species are the Golden Plover, Dotterel and Snow Bunting. Inevitably, there
are throughout, references to the Red Grouse, Black Grouse, Ptarmigan and
Capercaillie. Speyside's most famous breeding bird, the Osprey, is not
included, presumably because the period of observation was before ite
returned and began to regularly breed there during the early to mid-
Nineteen-fifties.
Richard Perry presents a highly readable account that successfully combines
beautifully descriptive writing with a considerable amount of information,
which frequently includes the localities, dates and other details of his
observations. My only misgivings concern the description (on p.58, not p.48
as listed in the Index) of the Great Grey Shrike as "a monstrous black and
white striped 'chaffinch' with ivory-coloured underparts" and when writing
of the aggressive posturing of cock Ptarmigan, the reference (p.173) to their
"long tails".
Birds are the subject of ten of the sixteen photos. The photos are rather
disappointing, not just because they are only in black and white, but because
most are little more than portraits and show hardly anything of the species'
highland habitats.
These relatively minor criticisms barely distract, however, and I am sure
that this book will be enjoyed by those with an interest in wildlife and the
countryside, especially those planning a holiday on Speyside, who will glean
much useful information not just about the wildlife, but also the area's
extremely changeable weather. Some potential readers will doubtless be
deterred by the price of this fairly slim volume, which does seem excessive

FIRST AID AND CARE OF WILD BIRDS
Edited by J. E. Cooper and J. T. Eley. Published by David and Charles,
1979. 288 p.p. Photos and drawings. Price #9.50.
All who are remotely concerned with the care of wild birds have been
waiting a long time for a book such as this and it must surely become a
standard reference.
Anyone who has worked in a bird gardens, or a zoo, as I have, will have
experienced the endless calls for help from finders of injured, sick or
orphaned birds and whilst many of these casualties are doomed, others die
because of well-intentioned but uninformed treatment. Even the veterinary
surgeons on the whole lack sufficient knowledge to deal confidently with
most of the cases brought to them. It is hard to imagine any situation that will
not be covered by this excellent book Members of the public who suddenly
find themselves responsible for a wild bird in distress may be helped in some
way by consulting this book in their local library, provided that they have an
elementary grasp of technical terms, but one visualises that its main function
will be to advise the staff at animal clinics and rescue shelters, and in
veterinary surgeries, as well as members of natural history societies and
indeed anyone concerned with the preservation of wildlife.
The editors have assembled twenty chapters from authors who are experts
on themes as diverse as the legal aspects of sheltering wild birds, the
treatment of wounds and injuries, pesticide poisoning and oil pollution,
capturing, holding and housing injured wild birds, diets, anaesthesia and
euthanasia, as well as chapters on the care of individual groups of birds such
as waterbirds and birds of prey. There are some very useful appendices
listing recommended equipment and medicines, drugs and dosages, as well
as an extensive bibliography with many references for suggested further
reading. There is also an appendix giving timely warnings and advice on the
health hazards to human volunteers involved in the care of birds.
In all, this book is a very valuable summary of the current literature and
fills a large gap.

Published by David McKay Co. Inc. New York. $10.95.
Subtitled "An Introduction to Their Behaviour and Breeding" this book
deals with the keeping of both domestic and wild species. Part 1, entitled
"The Facts of Aviary Life", contains chapters on "The Pleasure of Their
Company", in which the author enthuses over the delights of pigeon-
keeping and gives much information on the housing and treatment of both
domestic and wild species; "Character and Behaviour of Pigeons and
Doves", in which the behaviour of pigeons both as a class and as individuals
known to the author is described; "The Life Cycle of Pigeons and Doves", a
description of some aspects of pigeon behaviour, especially those relating to
the breeding cycle; and "The Fun of Flying: Racing Homers, Rollers,
Tipplers", in which the author describes and enthuses over the competitive
use of these domestic pigeon breeds.

Part 2, "A Gallery of Favourites" has a chapter each on the Ringneck
Dove (Barbary Dove), Diamond Dove, Bleeding-heart Pigeons (mostly on
the Luzon and Bartlett's Bleeding-hearts), Mountain Witch Dove (Crested
Quail Dove), Band-tailed Pigeon, Splendid Pigeon, Galapagos Dove, Plumed
Dove, Crowned Pigeon and Pink Pigeon. These chapters contain a good

deal of information, usually based on practical experience of the author
(where he has bred the species in question) or of other successful breeders.
The author's style may jar on some, as I must confess it does on me, but
in view of his status as Professor Emeritius of English at the University of
Southern California it is clearly impeccable American English. What does
shine happily out is his zeal and affection for his favourites. His own
personal experiences and recommendations seem to me the most valuable
parts of the book, although I do not find myself in agreement with all his
interpretations of behaviour. Some of the other information in the book is
doubtful (e.g. that wild pigeons often rain bathe until "for some time they
cannot fly", p.35). The words "variety" and "breed" are frequently misused
when "species" is meant and the colour varieties of the Barbary Dove are
wrongly termed subspecies. It is, however, interesting to know that so
many new colour varieties of this old favourite (or perhaps, alas, now in
Britain no longer a favourite) have been produced in the USA. It would be
nice to have more detailed descriptions of them (one is briefly described as
having "lavender neck and breast, and orange wings") and their history.
The book is profusely illustrated (unless I have miscounted) 84 black and
white photographs. Many of these are of domestic pigeons (over 60 individual
Racing Homers being shown in a total of 14 pictures), their lofts or their
not very photogenic keepers, and some are of wild species whose plumage
state and evident fear suggest very recent handling. There are, however,
many good and interesting photos of wild species, for example a Blue
Crowned Pigeon in defensive threat display, a sun-bathing Galapagos Dove

REQUEST FOR INFORMATION CONCERNING POSSIBLE METHOD OF
SEXING BLEEDING-HEART PIGEONS
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.99760328" page_id="56283551"  page_num="105" year="" vol="">
Neither the Luzon Gallicolumba luzonica or Bartlett's G. criniger show
marked plumage dimorphism and sexing is usually determined initially by
the slightly larger size and bolder appearance of the males. Even so, it can
still prove difficult to choose a true pair even in a group, and ultimately
behaviour is the only criterion that can be used with any certainty.
However, during the course of 1978 our pair of Luzon's, which had laid
fertile eggs the previous year and up to that point had been very nervous,
became extremely tame and would accept mealworms from the fingers
through the wire of their flight. It was then, when a close view of both birds
was possible, that a difference in iris colours, similar to those evident in
certain Hornbills and Cockatoos, was noticed. Males showed blue, while
females purple.
This method was then applied to the two pairs of Bartlett's in the collection.
The adult breeding pair showed the same iris colour differences between
male and female but a second pair, recently formed did not. Both had blue
irides but behaved as a pair, even to the stage of mating and therefore cast a
shadow of doubt. However, towards late summer the behaviour patterns of
the two reversed and it became evident both were males. They were then
split and a female, sexed solely on iris colour was introduced to one of the
males. Within two months a youngster had been reared.
I feel confident that the difference in iris colour is a trustworthy method of
splitting the sexes of both species and would welcome any information on the
matter from aviculturalists who have bred either species, or who have birds
of a particular sex, either proven or suspected. Hopefully, any forthcoming
information and views will be included in a future article on Gallicolumba.

SEXUAL RATIO IN ECLECTUS PARROTS; INCIDENCE OF TWIN CHICKS
IN PSITTACIFORMES
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.986171608695652" page_id="56283552"  page_num="106" year="" vol="">
During the 1978 breeding season my pair of Grand Eclectus Parrots
Eclectus roratus roratus produced a total of eight chicks. A method for
increasing chick production was attempted by removing the chicks from the
nest at three weeks of age for hand-rearing in order to let the hen recycle. I
am quite satisfied with the volume of production, but the sexual ratio of the
chicks left something to be desired. Of the 8 birds, 7 were males, 1 female.
In correspondence with others who have produced this species it appears
that you will have sexual runs, meaning that for a period all males will be
produced, then a period predominating in females will follow.
Sexual ratios have been controlled in certain laboratory animal offspring
by exposure to specific light spectra. (Popular Mechanics, September 1978).
I would be most interested in hearing from anyone producing Eclecti (any
race), sexual ratios and the lights spectra in use.
In addition, the second egg of a clutch produced in October 1978 failed to
hatch which was unusual. By candling the egg it was found to be fertile but
the embryo was dead. Upon opening the egg I was surprised to find twin
chicks, both attached to a single yolk sac, approximately 5 days from
hatching.
I have seen documented cases of successful hatching and rearing of twin
Cockatiel Nymphicus hollandicus chicks but on no occasion have I found any
documentation with respect to large Psittaciformes.
I would appreciate hearing from anyone knowing of any documented
accounts.

FIRST BREEDING AWARDS: FURTHER COMMENTS
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.994221678571428" page_id="56283553"  page_num="107" year="" vol="">
I have had several private commendations on my views on first breeding
awards, and Mr. Reed's letter in the Jan-March 1979 number is the first
criticism I have seen. I had never thought of our members outside Britain
as individuals taking advantage of a cheap deal, but as fellow aviculturists
following similar pleasures in different settings, and since we are not the
British Avicultural Society they have a right to expect as much consideration
as anyone else. The age of parochialism is past, I hope. In view of our
scattered membership I cannot really see that democracy is served by
AGMs which only a tiny section of our membership are likely to be able to
attend.
I believe there is a possibility of fraudulent claims for breedings where
people might have access to young of native species, and the situation
would be worse if we tried to operate our present awards on a world scale. I
regard the data of some recent claims for breeding native species as
unsatisfactory, and I do not accept that the committee should be expected
to act as arbiters, or to apparently certify breeding claims.
As regards the replacement for a "carrot" which Mr. Reed asks me for, I
must reply that I don't think it is necessary since I do not believe that we are
dealing with donkeys. In the same issue as Mr. Reed's letter, a few pages
further on, there is a rule which states quite simply that the Society "shall
have for its object the study of British and foreign birds in freedom and
captivity". It is the results of such study that aviculturists have to offer each
other, and the magazine is the publication in which they can do this. I think
that those who feel that they have worthwhile information to share will
offer it in this way, and if we never have another claim of the first breeding
of a species, except as an incidental aside in an article giving information on
the keeping and breeding of birds, I do not think we shall have lost anything
of significance.

BOOMING DISPLAY OF THE YELLOW-KNOBBED CURASSOW

Crax daubentoni
Delacour and Amadon (Curassows and Related Birds , 1973:221) state that
male Yellow-knobbed Curassows Crax daubentoni do not have a booming,
territorial song but rather, employ a "prolonged, high-pitched, leisurely
whistle." In this regard, we mention a male of this species, taken as an adult
and held in the Houston Zoo since 1971, that utters both forms of song,
frequently in conjunction and apparently in territorial display. Standing on
a branch, or occasionally on the ground, the specimen gives the descending
whistle previously described; then, following a short pause, it emits a low
boom in the manner of other species. The whistle is given with the neck
stretched up and the beak open wide. The bird then leans forward, bows
the head and, slightly retracting it, utters a two-syllable boom with the
second note barely audible. The calls are repeated four times a minute and
a calling session lasts as long as twenty minutes and may be performed
several times a day. The territorial calling appears at times to be triggered
by the presence of humans, whom the birds regard as adversaries, possibly
due to imprinting as a result of having been hand-raised in Venezuela. This
specimen and a female with which it is housed are believed to be the only
examples presently in the United States.

FACE-CLAWING IN PARROTS
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.987179111111111" page_id="56283554"  page_num="108" year="" vol="">
In the October -- December 1978 issue of the Magazine, Stewart Levinson
asked for additions to his list of Parrots which indulge in face-clawing. Of the
more than 100 parrots in my collection, only 2 indulge in this behaviour
habitually and purposefully. They are a Slender-billed Parakeet, Enicognathus
leptorhynchus, and a Chilean Parakeet or Conure, Enicognathus feruginea.
I believe that this behaviour is more likely to occur in birds kept on their
own, i.e. those without a mate to preen their heads. The Slender-billed
Parakeet had been kept alone for about 13 years before it was possible to find
a mate for it and the Chilean is a pet bird kept on its own.

PARTIAL MOULT IN A HONEYCREEPER

Cyanerpes cyaneus

The Cyanerpes male referred to in the Avicultural Magazine (Vol. 85,
No. 1, p. 6 -- 15) went into a partial moult in September, after breeding.
Only about l h of its feathers were replaced by the out-of-season green.
These were mostly on the lower abdomen and were patchy. This was
thought to be a bad sign -- perhaps of senility, as it had previously moulted
completely. However, in the spring, it moulted all its feathers perfectly, and
is as radiant and active as ever.
SEXING Garrulax mitratus AND Cyanocorax yncas
Having had a pair of each of these birds, I found that although they are,
of course, unrelated, they could be sexed in exactly the same way. Both
species have a narrow line of white feathers on the lores, going from eye to
eye, bordering the upper mandible. In the male of each, this band is more
pronounced, being broader and whiter than in the respective hens. The
difference is more readily appreciated if a pair is examined together. In
both the Jays, and in the hen Chestnut-capped Laughing Thrush (or, less
correctly -- Chestnut-capped Babbler), this observation was confirmed
later unfortunately by post-mortem examination.

For over ten years a pair of Giant Pittas has been part of the extensive
softbili collection housed in the Hixon Tropical Bird House. During those
years no attempts at nesting were recorded. In the spring of 1978 the first
nesting occurred shortly after completion of the "Asian Jungle", a naturally
landscaped, heavily planted diorama exhibit which the pittas share with
twelve other species of Asian forest birds.
In the beginning, nest construction by the male was rather sporadic, with
the bird standing near the nest site for periods of fifteen to thirty minutes
with nesting material held in his bill. It appears that the nest-building
instinct, though present, was not fully functional after so many years of
dormancy.
The first nest was constructed five feet up in a dense clump of fishtail
palms where several leaf stalks overlapped. The nest was covered cup open at
the front with a landing platform of rough twigs and leaf petioles. One of the
most interesting aspects of the nest was its disproportionately large size in
relation to the birds building it. Bamboo twigs, palm leaves, grapevine bark,
Johnson grass stems and fern fronds were used to build the nest. The lining
was dried grass stems, arum leaves and a few Muscovy Duck contour
feathers. Both sexes shared in nest construction.
This first attempt was interrupted by a sudden, acute respiratory infection
in the female. With prompt medical attention she was spared, but the illness
required several weeks of treatment. Nesting activities ceased for that year.
In the spring of 1979 the male began carrying nesting material around the
exhibit again. The nest was similar to that of last year although was four feet
up in the front corner of the exhibit only a few inches from the glass front and
the public. As previously noted, both sexes share in the nest construction.
The time between beginning of nest construction and the production of the
first egg varied from ten to eighteen days. The first clutch of eggs (2) was
pulled from the nest and artificially incubated. This option was chosen due
to the rarity of the species in captivity. (So far as we can determine, this is the
only pair in the United States). The eggs were replaced by Coturnix quail
eggs which were approximately the same shape and size. Both sexes shared

in the incubation, alternately sitting "tight" on the nest until the quail eggs
were removed. The first clutch of pittas hatched May 15 and unfortunately
survived only two days.
Several days after the dummy eggs were removed the birds began building
another nest in the fishtail palm location. Construction was similar to
previous nests, but progressed rapidly and appeared complete in five days
rather than ten to fourteen. On May 29 the first egg was seen and removed
from the nest to be replaced by a quail egg as before. Three days later two
additional eggs were discovered in the nest and also removed for artificial
incubation. Only two eggs of this clutch of three proved fertile. The first egg
hatched in fifteen days, the other in fourteen days. At sixteen days of age
these hatchlings died. A respiratory ailment was suspected.
The third attempt at nesting was in another palm about 10 feet to the right
of the previous nest. After several days the male gave up and appeared to be
finished for the year. Several days later nest construction began at the site of the
first nesting. This time construction was very rapid without the long 20 -- 30
minute pauses in searching for nest materials which previously been part of
the procedure. Two eggs were laid in this clutch and again they were pulled
and replaced. The pair alternated sitting for 11 -- 12 days until another bird
broke the dummy eggs while both birds were feeding. They then abandoned
the nest site, no further nesting attempts were seen and moulting started.
Both sexes shared in nest construction after it was initiated by the male, and
the time between beginning of construction and the production of the first
egg varied from ten to eighteen days.
The eggs are yellowish white, finely spattered with dark brown on the
larger end with random flecks occurring over the entire egg. Eggs measure
32mm X 26mm and average 10 grams fresh weight. Incubation was in a
Marsh Farms Roll-X with turning grids removed. Temperature was maintained
at 99.5*F dry and 86*F wet bulb. The eggs were turned manually five times
each day, 7:30 a.m. to 6:00 p.m. Eggs were placed longitudinally on moist
sand in a plastic container. Incubation period varied: 14 days (1 egg), 15 days
(2 eggs) and 16 days for the other three. Hatching occurred about twelve
hours after pipping. (The 14-day egg was one of those discovered after three
days and could in fact have been incubated by the parents for a day or two
prior to pulling).
The hatchlings were purplish-black, leathery looking, almost naked creat-
ures with fluffy white tufts of natal down on the hind crown and dorsal areas.
The soles of the feet and rictal areas are yellowish white, and gape bright crim-
son. The average hatchling weight was 9.5 grams. The diet consisted of finely
diced whole three-day-old mice and Wayne dog food pellets soaked in
ABDEC vitamin water. After six days, the diet was augmented with freshly
moulted mealworm larvae and Vs grown crickets. The chicks were fed six
times per day from 7:30 a.m. to 5:30 p.m. The amounts increased from one
piece of each food item to three pieces of pinky mouse, one piece dog food
and one larva as they grew. Growth was rapid with an average weight gain

of 4.2 grams per day for the first fourteen days. At twenty days they became
active, hopping about with the characteristic bounding motion of the adults
and drinking on their own. At twenty-four days the birds started self-
feeding. It was interesting to note that the bird that was only one day older
fed the second chick until it was also self-feeding. At twenty-eight days the
birds were observed perching in the evening and by thirty days were weaned
to our insectile diet supplemented with live mealworms and crickets.
During the nestling period the only vocalization was a subdued cheeping
similar to that of a begging American Robin nestling.
Aviculturists frequently sell a pair of birds who don't nest within a year or
two of acquisition. Sometimes perseverence pays. After ten years the pittas
responded nicely to environmental change. Discouraging as it was to lose the
first clutch of chicks, we were willing, and more importantly, the birds were
willing to continue. As this draft is being completed we are pleased to*
observe that the parents are nesting again, perhaps as a result of our placing a
man-made nest similar to their own in a suitable site. The birds totally
ignored it for several days and then proceeded to use it as a platform on
which to build a new nest. Construction was complete this time in three
days.
We would be pleased to receive information about the location of any Giant
Pittas in captivity for possible acquisition of unrelated stock to improve
chances for long term propagation success.

<bodyText confidence="0.998502243902439" page_id="56283568"  page_num="112" year="" vol="">
By L. GIBSON (British Columbia)
Turdoides are distributed across Africa and tropical Asia. Typical babblers,
they are sturdy short-winged, long-tailed birds with the strong legs of
ground-feeders. All species are of similar size, appearance and habits. Their
main characteristics are a gregarious and vocal nature combined with a lively
curiosity. They are at the same time wary and fearless. Drably attired in
greys and browns, the one bright spot is the eye. The colour of the iris is
yellow or reddish and in T. jardinei it is a fiery orange-red, which gives the
bird a rather fierce demeanour. They make interesting aviary subjects as
they mostly stay in view and are constantly active. Turdoides are however
seldom kept in aviaries, probably because of their lack of colour.
T. jardenei is the nominate race of a group known as Arrow-marked or
Arrow Babblers, so called from the small white arrowhead markings on the
breast. The birds are found in Central East Africa (up to 5,700&apos;, 1750m in
Zambia). At least five sub-species have been described, each shading into the
other with minor colour variations. It is questionable if some of them deserve
separate status. They live in rather open country where they keep to clumps
of cover and fly in a typical follow-my-leader fashion from one bush to the
next. Rather fluffy birds, they look heavier than their actual weight of 85
grams.
Often described by field observers as noisy, I find that in this species at
least, the calls are interesting rather than annoying. In the aviary, and also in
the wild, babblers like nothing better than something new to liven up their
day. Col. Meinertzhagen, in his book 'Birds of Arabia', noted that Arabian
Babblers T. squamiceps would gang up on any creature (or object) that
happened along. They would tease creatures as diverse as jackals and
tortoises, and hound them out of the territory. Unnatural objects, such as
waste paper or cloth, also invoked a noisy inspection. Not having a jackal
handy (although there are coyotes near here), I tested the babblers' reaction
to a white mouse. This caused great excitement and they chased it around
the aviary for 15 minutes, jumping at it bravely and encouraging one another
with a barrage of cackles. As far as could be seen they did not actually strike
the mouse, and they certainly were not about to make a meal of it.
Plastic toys, coloured cloth, etc. elicited a similar response but this only
lasted for a minute or two as the object did not respond to teasing.
In his book 'Birds in my Indian Garden', Malcolm MacDonald writes of
Jungle Babblers T. somervillei periodically having free-for-all mock battles,
which start for no apparent reason. The above book gives useful and detailed
information on nesting and other habits of a number of birds of avicultural
interest. If only more specific information on feeding had been given,
especially of chicks, this work would be a standard reference.

Arrow Babbler on leaving nest at 14 days old (Note strong legs)
Meinertzhagen described a nightly pre-roosting dance by T. squamiceps
where a small group of birds took turns at dancing or parading to the admiring
babbles of the audience.
My birds did neither of the above acts, but perhaps to get typical babbler
behaviour there should be a group of six or seven birds, as is usually noted in
the wild. Turdoides are called the "Seven Sisters" in India, and I have heard
this applied to Garrulax. MacDonald quotes Salim Ali (Birds of India) as
giving the Hindi name of Sat Bhai. This means "Seven Brothers". Seven
Sisters (Sat Bhin) is more likely correct as the word for bird is feminine, and
MacDonald uses "Sisters" in his translation of the name. I will leave this to
the pundits.
T. jardinei did have an evening pre-roosting ceremony, which was likely a
proclamation of territory. Every evening at dusk the cock would fly to the far
(non-roosting) end of the aviary, and sit on an exposed branch. Then he
stretched up on his legs and extended his head to the full length of his neck.
Clapping his wings hard to his sides he would give a full throated babble.
This was repeated a few times then the others joined him. After several
choruses from all, they retired for the night. They sleep huddled together in
typical Timaliinae fashion.
Diet
The adults were easily fed. The basic 'convenience' item was dry dog food
powder. Presumably they took to this as they had probably been getting an

insectile food before arriving here. They voluntarily ate this powder even
when other food was available, and so far only 3 species have done this here.
The other mainstay, of which they were very fond, was soft bread, usually
spread with margarine, and sometimes butter. Almost every aviary bird I
have kept liked soft bread (with or without margarine). Even the Chloropsis
eat it, and it is fed every day in large quantities to everything. It formed
the bulk of the babblers' diet. Some scrambled egg was eaten daily
and chopped boiled chicken was given when available, usually three or four
days a week. Mealworms were given when they could be spared, and any
kind of insect was eaten, but worms were never taken. No fruit, berries or
greens were eaten with the exception of grapes, and the birds were very fond
of these. This must surely have been an acquired taste, and was one which
the chick quickly picked up. Turdoides have a curved, delicately pointed
beak, suggesting an insectivorous nature. The beak is not very heavy for the
size of the bird, and is used to push debris sideways as they hunt for insects
on the ground. It is not stabbed into the ground.
Calls
The Arrow Babbler has a limited voice range, and there is really only one
basic call. Variations are only in the length and volume of it. This sound is
fairly described as a "caw". The birds are in constant vocal contact, and the
usual close communication is a quiet chuckle consisting of a few half-caws or
clucks. A half-call consisting of several caws in succession, is used for general
excitement, alarm, or for something of interest. This call is heard every time
a dish of fresh food is put in the aviary, or whenever the nest was inspected,
or if a white mouse is passing through! A full-chorus babble is usually a
territorial proclaimer, as far as can be judged in an aviary. It was used by the
cock when courting and nest-building, and to a lesser extent by the hen at
these times, and by all the birds for a short time each evening. There was no
dawn calling. With little imagination the cawing sounds like crazy laughter
-- certainly more so than any species of laughing thrush that I have heard. It is
a bit like a Kookaburra starting off, in style if not in actual notes. The chick
was able to make an identical mini-babble on the day it left the nest. The calls
made by the adults and the juvenile were the same, and were of no help in
distinguishing one bird from another.
Sexing
As behaviour patterns are the same for both birds (except for the cock
feeding the hen), this only leaves plumage differences as a means of sexing.
With practice one can sex an individual bird, but it has to be close or be
restricted in movement, for the aviary they scarcely keep still long
enough to be identified. Identification is much easier in bright light, and dull
conditions, or even back-lighting, makes for much hard staring. Often it is
only the arrival of the other bird which settles the matter.
The cock has whiter and more extensive arrows. These are small downward

pointing arrowheads on the tips of the breast feathers. On the hen, these do
not go as far down the breast as on the cock, and she has scarcely any on the
neck other than on the chin. The male has lighter marks going around the
head and neck, giving him a more dapper silver-grey appearance than the
browner hen. Although this difference is obvious, it can only be seen at
close quarters. The remainder of the plumage of both birds is a greyish-
brown. The eye colour is the same attractive orange in both adults, the
juvenile having black eyes. The legs and beak are the same greyish black in
all the birds. The only picture of T. jardinei I have seen (and indeed the only
mention) is in 'The Dictionary of Birds in Colour', by Bruce Campbell. The
bird in the photograph is a male. If the pictures in this book do not convert
the reader to softbills, nothing will.
It is presumed that the brighter bird is the male, although only an internal
examination would finally establish the sex, remembering that this bird did
most of the sitting. The browner bird was seen in the nest at night when the
eggs were laid (for both clutches), but was not seen there again at night,
either for incubating or for brooding.
Health and Housing
The birds were obtained on 6th October, 1978. They were in excellent
condition apart from having overgrown beaks. One was badly crossed and was
trimmed back into shape. Their beaks have been fine ever since, due to the
birds being kept in an earth-floored aviary. The birds each had a single dwarf
tapeworm Hymenolepis sp, which were easily removed,' (see Modern Treat-
ment of some Avian Parasites).Avicultural Magazine, Volume 84, No. 4.
Being in excellent feather, they were immediately put outside in a small
roofed aviary with a bob-hole into a heated room. They remained there until
the spring. Every night during the winter, the birds were chased inside if
they had not already gone in.
In March of 1979 the weather was unusually warm and dry. On the third
of the month, the babblers were put out in a large (10m) planted aviary as
described for mousebirds in Avicultural Magazine, this issue.
The babblers initially shared the aviary with a pair of White-crested
Laughing Thrushes Garrulax leucolophus. In spite of a 15% weight advantage,
the Garrulax gave way to the Turdoides at the food dish, etc. This was the
only time I have seen White-crested Thrushes back off from anything! This
was helped by the fact that the babblers were in sole possession of the aviary
a week before the Garrulax were added. When the Turdoides began to nest, the
Garrulax were removed. Later, three Blue-naped Mousebirds were put into
the aviary at the time when the babblers had a 4 week old chick, and there
was no serious confrontation.
Nesting
From building to laying took longer than any other species which nested
here. MacDonald also commented on the leisurely pace of nesting in the

wild. The first nest was started on April 19th, 1979, and was more or less
complete by the 25th. The birds continued to add a strand or two until at
least the 29th of April, but did not lay until May 6th, 7th and 8th. They then
started to fill the nest box with grass, around the nest, and by the time a chick
left, the box was completely filled. The first nest (the only successful one)
was made in an open cardboard box 9X7^ X 6&amp;quot; deep (23X 19X15cm) at a
height of 5&apos; (1.5m) in a laurel bush in the aviary shelter. The shelter is
enclosed in clear acrylic sheeting. The nest material was rather coarse, as was
the construction, and long dried grasses formed the bulk of the structure. A
few twigs were incorporated. Later the box was filled with grass and a few
small leaves.
Eventually two more nests were built in the box, one being on top of the
original. Yet another nest (the second) was well constructed and well hidden
in a wisteria vine, against an old birch trunk. This was close to the roof at
5&apos;10&amp;quot; (1.8m), and was also in the shelter. The nests averaged 3%&amp;quot; (9.5cm)
inside diamater with a depth of lft&amp;quot; (4cm). The outside diameter was 5^&amp;quot;
(14cm) and the outside depth was about 2 l /2 n (6.5cm), so the walls and base
were quite thick.
The nest box could conveniently be looked into from outside the aviary,
by standing on a concrete block. These useful blocks are moved around for
this purpose, and also serve as feeding tables. Both birds built, but it was not
noted if one did more than the other. The cock displayed and called loudly
throughout construction.

Eggs
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.9989559" page_id="56283572"  page_num="116" year="" vol="">
The eggs were a beautiful shiny turquoise, being more blue than green.
This is probably the colour of most Turdoides eggs, and for the Arrow Babbler,
3 is apparently the average clutch. They were not measured or photographed
as I do not like to touch a first clutch. In shape they were more round than
elongated. Meinertzhagen notes up to 9 eggs in the Arabian Babblers' nest,
and both he and MacDonald thought that the babblers shared nests.Surely
this is the only explanation for a nine-egg clutch. Although only one pair of
birds is reported on here, observations on them and a chick point towards
this sort of communal behaviour.
Three eggs were laid in the first clutch and two eggs in the second. The hen
was almost out of breeding condition by the second round, and a smaller
than normal clutch (in numbers, not in size) is usual under end of season
conditions. The incubation period is 13 days. In the first clutch two hatched
on the same day, one early in the morning and one at 5 p.m., at 14 and 13 days
respectively. The first egg was scarcely inpubated at all on the day of laying
The third egg hatched the following morning, at 13 days. The birds were off
the eggs so much that I was surprised when all three hatched. For instance,
as soon as fresh food was put in, both birds came down to inspect it. No other
bird which has nested here ever left the nest just to see what was new in the
food dish, as distinct from a trip for the purpose of eating.

At least 80% of the daytime incubation was done by the cock, with the hen
relieving him for 5 --15 minute spells. It was later established that he was
also on the nest at night. In contrast to the building period, both birds
became very quiet and relatively inconspicuous as soon as the eggs were laid.
Chicks
When the eggs hatched, not a trace of shell was found. Although of course
they may have been lost in the mass of flowers, it is usual that eggs (and dead
chicks) are carried to the furthest point from the nest and dropped right at
the wire.So it is presumed that the eggshells were eaten.
The pink chicks were completely devoid of down, and had no particular
gape colours. Like all softbills, they were seen begging almost immediately
and were being fed within an hour or two of hatching. As with the incubating,
the cock did most of the brooding. For the first day he also did most of the
feeding. The hen was seen to take food to the chicks for the first time at 6
p.m., but both fed about equally thereafter. As well as thinking that two hens
may share a nest, MacDonald noted up to five adults feeding one brood. The
casual attitude of the hen would certainly fit with the above, and it is possible
that such behaviour could be a first step towards parasitism.
For the first day, the birds were given mealworm pupae. Thereafter they
were given mealworms and pupae, and the chicks were fed solely on these.
No other live food was available, except what strayed into the aviary, and the
birds would not eat earthworms. The adults stopped eating the normal diet
and did not touch it thereafter as long as mealworms were given.
On the second day one chick died and it was dumped at the far end of the
aviary where it was easily found. It was plump at 3.25 grams, and had a 1&amp;quot;
(25mm) mealworm in its stomach, so it was obviously getting fed. The
mealworm had no head, which meant that the parents were at least killing
them. This was interesting because either parent just picked up a mealworm,
gave it one or two perfunctory bangs, and then fed it straight to a chick.
There was no maceration, or beak manipulation to soften it, or any attempt to
pick it into smaller pieces.
Mealworms and pupae were fed ad lib, and at least once a day, a large
number were smeared with soft margarine, mainly to supply Vitamin D. A
hand-feeding programme was also commenced on the second day of
hatching.
Hand feeding consists of giving the chicks one to three feeds a day of
scrambled egg moistened with milk. Occasionally other items are added to
this, mainly chicken and sometimes cheese.
This system is used for all softbill chicks. It invariably does some good,
even if it only to relieve the demand for live food, and it certainly never does
any harm. There has never been a problem arising from handling the chicks
of any species bred, and after about two days of this, parent birds become less
excited and usually stay nearby and become annoyed rather than fearful or
overly aggressive.

When the aviary was entered, the off-duty bird melted quietly into the
foliage so that the place looked empty. The sitting bird waited until approached
very closely before flushing, and yet it voluntarily came off readily. Irrespective
of which parent was sitting, the hen always made a noisy, close defence of the
nest whenever the chicks were being examined. This made up for her earlier
poor sharing of the labours and while she did so the cock usually flew back
and forth silently at a distance, or else he disappeared into a bush. Occasionally
he babbled from a safe distance. Both birds cleaned the nest, usually eating
the droppings which were in a sac up to 9 days. They cleaned up until the
nest was vacated.
The chicks begged regularly until the sixth day, responding to a bang on
the nest, or more usually, simply on the nest box. By the fourth day it was
obvious that something was wrong with one chick. It had difficulty in
swallowing and the other one was drawing away rapidly in size. Strangely the
same thing happened a few weeks later with one Shama chick in a nest of
three. On the seventh day, the healthy chick's eyes opened, and the small
chick died. It weighed only 6.4g, having dropped from 8.2g on the previous
day. At this point the healthy chick weighed about 18g. The dead chick was
found at the end of the aviary like the first little one. It had a full stomach, and
there were three particles of eggshell present. Hen eggshells are permanently
kept in all aviaries. The chick also had 2 tiny cornet-shaped snailshells, about
2mm long, in its stomach. I suspect these and the eggshells were there as grit,
although 'real' grit was not found. There was no obvious cause of death.
The remaining chick prospered, but would not beg when its eyes opened.
In response to the parents' clucks it lay flat in the nest and drew its head into
its shoulders, and tightly closed its eyes. However it was getting used to me,
and as it was always hungry, it compromised by adopting this position as
instructed, and then, with eyes still tight shut, it would open its beak and
take the food. For the parents it came straight up. The parents were also
getting used to this, and the hen often just sat on the edge of the box and gave
a few annoyed caws when I was feeding the chick. She was fairly tame and
would occasionally take a proffered mealworm. The cock never did, but he
would come quite close for mealworms.
The chick's feathers burst out of the quills on the 9th day, and yet at this
time its tail was an inch long. This is the first chick I have had whose tail grew
before the wings. However, the tail stayed at this length for a while and the
wings outgrew it. When 14 days old, the chick left the nest. It weighed 46g
which is about 53% of the adult weight. It moved 2 metres to a weigela bush
where it remained absolutely still and was hard to find. It was weighed and
photographed, and it took the whole thing very calmly. The rather scruffy,
nondescript brownish chick had no features of note other than very large
well-developed legs and feet, and a tiny triangle of arrow markings under its
chin. It could barely flutter, but could hop and climb, and the parents called
it up to suitable dense foliage. Both parents were very attentive, with the hen
still being the aggressive defender. They constantly checked on the chick

and called to it, and if it thought there was no-one around, it called back in a
tiny voice with an identical call.
With the chick out of the nest, the parents, who had gone very quiet up to
now, recommenced their evening cackling ceremony. They also commenced
'breeding preening' which consisted of one bird sitting bolt upright, with the
head and neck extended upwards, and the neck feathers sticking straight out
to be preened by the other bird.
At 16 days, the chick could fly a little, and it was still being hand fed once a
day as the parents still only fed mealworms. On this day one bird (I think it
was the hen) was seen babbling with a piece of grass in its beak. An almost
completed nest was then found in a wisteria vine, but it was not used.
Construction had not been seen at all, and as the cock was mostly brooding,
the hen must have been the major builder.
The birds were going through tremendous numbers of mealworms. These
had been supplied ad lib., but by now, on the 17th day they kept running out
and were being replaced several times daily. On this day, one adult was seen
to eat a grape for the first time since the chick hatched, possibly because of
the mealworm shortage. Once when the mealworms were replenished, nine
were fed to the chick at one time, about evenly by both parents. Nine of these
mealworms weighed 1.75g or 3.5% of the weight of the chick. This is like
someone gulping down a 4 --5 lb snack all at once. At this stage the parents
usually half-opened their wings when giving a mealworm to the chick. I have
only seen this in one other bird; the cowbird, although, for obvious reasons,
I don't have much time for wild-bird watching.
The Brown-headed Cowbird Molothrus ater is a parasitic species. The
chick does not throw out the eggs of the host, as does the cuckoo. Depending on
how crowded the nest is, some of the legitimate chicks may survive, in spite
of being outgrown by the cowbird. Soon after fledging young cowbirds join
up with adults. Possibly the parents skulk around waiting for them. I
watched a pair on my lawn feeding three juveniles. The parents spread their
wings at the instant of feeding, exactly like the babblers. Does anyone have
any theories on this?
The cowbird is one of about 15 species of wild birds that have nested in
my garden, (none of which I have got around to writing about). The aviaries
and the numerous trees, plus winter feeding, help to attract them, and over
30 species have visited here. The rarest and most spectacular visitor was a
Pileated Woodpecker Hylatomus (Dryocopus) pileatus.
The babbler chick had a very long fledgling period, as would be expected
of such sociable birds. By 20 days the chick could fly fairly well, but it still
remained well hidden. It only began to sit out in the open at 26 days, when it
was seen at the food dish for the first time, although it was not seen to eat.
Only two or three mealworms a day were given by now, so the chick must
have been getting the normally supplied diet. When mealworms were put
into the feeding dish, both parents would come down with much cackling
and eat a few. Then each would take two or sometimes three mealworms at a

time to the chick, who swallowed them all in one gulp.
By the 27th day the chick was seen eating from the feeding dish, although
the type of food was not discerned. On this day three adult Coitus were put in
the aviary. The babblers simply kept them out of the nesting half of the
flight, otherwise there was no trouble. No actual fighting took place. Also on
the 27th day, mealworms were discontinued, but mealworm beetles were
given. These were fed to the chick as soon as they were put in. By now the
chick was flying around after the parents.
The following day, the hen began gathering grass. In the evening she flew
to the cock with a beakful of grass and banged him forcefully on the wing
with it -- a clear invitation to get on with nesting. Both birds then gathered
grass on and off for the next 17 days and built a third nest on top of the first
one in the box. By now the chick was 45 days old and was still being fed
whenever mealworms were given.
On this day the Coitus laid, so all three babblers were removed to a small
10&apos; diam. hexagonal aviary. The nest box was put in with them. The
following day the adults stopped feeding the chick, which by now weighed
76 g. Yet another nest (the fourth) was built in the box and when the chick
was 54 days old, two eggs were found. Then I broke my golden rule of daily
examination. When the nest was examined nine days later (on the 23rd of
June) the nest was empty, and not a trace of the eggs, or chicks, was found.
The exact date of laying was not known, nor were the eggs checked for
fertility. A horrible possibility is that they hatched and died because no live
food was supplied. This is unlikely, as the hen was noticed missing within
two days, so the hatching date would have been close to the estimate. But the
answer would have been known had I stuck to daily examination of all nests,
every single one of which has been examined each day with this sole
exception. No problems have ever arisen from this inspection, in over 30
species, or 45 if birds in my garden are counted, species, not nests.
The fully grown youngster had by now very white arrows on about a third
of its breast, and so was presumed to be a male. At the time of writing, the
breast markings are still extending, and from a distance it is impossible to tell
the young one from the parents. However at five months, it still has black
eyes. These birds are a model family. All sit side by side and indulge in
mutual preening, and call each other to the food dish. By contrast, Shama
chicks in another aviary were killing each other by eight weeks of age. The
nesting Shamas, (and Coitus) were the cause of my neglecting to inspect the
babbler eggs daily. It was a good thing that the Shamas were inspected daily,
for reasons you will hear of in a following issue of this magazine.

WOODPECKER Dendrocopos major

By W. P. HERRING (Fraddon, Cornwall)
Due to the activities of wood cutters in our district, four young Great
Spotted Woodpeckers were brought to me during the evening of June 4th.
They had survived the impact of the felled tree and were only discovered
when the tree was being sawn into blocks, one cut totally exposed the nest
cavity not more than 10 inches from where the chicks were.
The tree had been felled at 1 p.m. but it wasn't until 6.30 p.m. that the
chicks came into my possession, by which time they were cold and very
weak. There was a staggered size difference, with the estimated age of the
youngest being not more than three days old, making the eldest approximately
six days old. The eldest was beginning to show feather stubs on tail and
wings.
They were immediately placed in an old budgerigar breeding box and put
in the airing cupboard next to the hot water cylinder as it was most important
to get the chicks as warm as possible quickly. The period it took them to
warm up gave us ample time to consider a suitable diet and after a telephone
conversation with Rex Harper, the following experimental formula was
used: 3 teaspoons Farex; 1 teaspoon glucose; Vi yolk hard boiled egg and l /2
small slice of brown bread with crust removed.
We found that if the bread was quickly dipped in water, enough moisture
was provided to bind all the ingredients together without becoming to sticky.
The food was given to the chicks as small pellets every two hours from 6.30
a.m. to 10.30 p.m. Finely chopped raw beef was added to two meals each day,
being mixed thoroughly with the basic diet. Following each feed, a solution
of honey dissolved in warm water was given by means of an eye dropper.
Initial feeds comprised of two pellets per chick which increased to ten each
feed by the twelfth day. The first four days seemed to be the critical period until
we found the right quantity of meat to include with the food. The chicks
remained weak for these few days, especially the youngest which seemed
very sleepy and was unable to hold its head up. During this period they lived
in the airing cupboard.
Their box was kept as clean as possible. After each feed they were removed
to another box with clean coarse sawdust, the type produced by a chain saw.
This prevented clogging and also ensured the nest would not become too
dusty.
The birds droppings were carefully watched and, as on one occasion, they
became runny, the quantity of meat was reduced for a day or two. After the
initial period of weakness and adjustment to their new diet the fledgling
rapidly gained strength and their eyes began to open.
By this time they were used to being handled and loud cries were heard
whenever their box was approached. Feathers soon appeared on the wings

and tail and a faint reddish tinge on the top of their heads began to show.
For some unknown reason the chicks never gaped for food so the method
adopted for feeding remained the same, the pellets being pushed to the back
of the throat so they had to be swallowed. Until the chicks were feathered,
these could be seen as little yellow balls through the skin at the side of their
necks, thus giving us an indication as to the amount of food to give at each
meal.
At the end of the first week the climbing instinct was beginning to appear.
They would climb up the sides of their box and liked to hang on the side
looking around while the remaining chicks were fed. It was at this stage that
if all four chicks were placed together in cupped hands they would make
mewing noises and within half a minute be asleep. When returned to their
box they soon settled down until their next feed. It was found easier for two
people to feed them so I administered the pellets and honey while my wife
held them.
I now built a new box such as would be used for breeding Redrumps. The
sloping side had rough bark nailed to it so they could climb. This also
prevented them from soiling their plumage. A deep layer of coarse sawdust
was placed in the bottom.

Slight attempts at preening were made on the eighth day and woodpecker
tapping was heard for the first time coming from within the box. The chicks
were by now getting very strong and obviously wanting to explore their
surroundings and after the tenth day spent a few minutes out of the box after
each meal. They liked to climb over my wife, daughter and myself and jump
onto backs of chairs. By the twelfth day they were all over the room, under
the furniture and up the curtains. After this exercise they would always come
back to me, climb up and go to sleep nestling against my neck.
At this stage it was not necessary to be so punctual with their feeding
times. One mealworm each was now given daily, the heads being removed to
aid digestion. An extra meat meal was introduced making three a day. At
times the chicks would take pellets from our fingers and pick up the odd
mealworm from the table.
When we had had the birds for a fortnight I made a large cage approximately

<equation confidence="0.632491" page_id="56283579"  page_num="123" year="" vol="">
4ft X 3ft X 2ft which the chicks were placed in each morning out in the

garden and brought inside each evening for their usual exercise, exploring
the house. The cage had a large branch behind which they could hide and
much of their time was spent stripping the bark off it and peeping around the
sides.
By the sixteenth day, adult calls were heard frequently especially when
they were let free indoors. By now they could fly the length of the room --
over 16ft. Their feeds were now at roughly 3 to 31/2 hour intervals with
mealworms being increased to three each per day. They were very curious,
tapping at everything and testing with their tongues. Despite obviously
strong beaks, they were always very gentle with my family and myself.
By the eighteenth day, they were fully feathered and over 7 inches long.
The red cap was more pronounced in two of the chicks than in the others; the
latter having just the forehead red while the usual extent of red was present
in the others.
Meals were now cut to four a day with the birds readily taking pellets from
tweezers. A shallow bowl of water was placed inside the cage along with
mealworms and pellets. By the twenty-second day they were only fed on
demand from tweezers. The chicks soon learned to feed themselves and on
July 1st were released into a large outside aviary furnished with several old
logs, branches and pieces of bark for them to turn over.
Holes were bored in the branches and filled with maggots, mealworms and
blowfly pupae. A dish of pellets were always available and their honey and
water was given through the wire. They were very active and enjoyed their
new, larger more natural environment spending much time hopping around
the branches and hanging upside-down from the wire on the roof. They
spent a fortnight in the aviary before finally on the 15th day they were
released into the wild.
The release area was carefully chosen and consisted of a heavily wooded
area owned by Mrs Joyce Daniel who encourages wildlife in the district.
They were transferred to the location in a large cage where they spent two

hours surveying their new surroundings. They were fed and when the cage
was opened their was no panic, they just flew to the nearest tree and started
pulling moss and bark off the branches. They remained close together for
several hours but gradually moved farther away, constantly calling.
Mrs Daniel was most helpful in placing food in several places which the
birds soon found and fed from it for a few days. My family and I paid a visit to
the point of release the following day and all four were observed obviously
enjoying their freedom, fit and well. They seemed pleased to see us and came
close to us, with one actually coming to my shoulder giving me a farewell
peck before returning to his natural habitat.
Since that time the birds have been frequently heard by Mrs Daniel and a
month after release, all four were seen feeding at her bird-table. Occasionally
they are stil heard and seen within a few yards of her house. We had the
woodpeckers for six weeks during which time we spent many hours feeding,
preparing food, building cages and searching the countryside for dead wood
etc., but it was an experience which none of us would have missed and which
we shall remember for the rest of our lives.

General plumage pale pink, underside of crest deep salmon, undersides of
wings and tail washed with yellow and salmon pink, naked periothalmic
ring coloured white with a tint of blue, bill black, iris dark brown to black in
adult males, reddish brown to red in adult females, brown in immature
birds, overall length 52 cm.
In adult birds sexual dimorphism is exhibited by the colour of the iris,
contradictory to Forshaw's "Parrots of the World" 1973. In more than 30 cases
visual determination of sex was confirmed by laparoscopic examination. In
all cases where the iris denoted immaturity it was also confirmed by laparoscopy.
This would appear to indicate a correlation between colour of the iris and
sexual maturity.
Distribution
Moluccas, Indonesia, and surrounding islands.

Elliptical, white.
Acquisition
Both birds were originally kept as individual pets. The male was known to
be five years old and the female 12 years at the time of acquisition in 1974.
Housing
The flight is framed with 1&amp;quot; angle iron, the mesh is 2&amp;quot;X4&amp;quot; welded fabric.
Inside dimensions are 8&apos;high X 8&apos; long X 4&apos; wide. The flooring is tile
covered with newspapers, changed and disinfected three times weekly.
Nest Log
Natural log hollowed out with a chain saw, top and bottom of %&amp;quot; plywood
covered with sheet metal. Viewing door is 10&amp;quot; X 10&amp;quot; installed 5&amp;quot; above the
nesting platform for easy inspection, chick removal, etc., also covered with
sheet metal to discourage chewing. Inside log dimensions 4&apos; long X 16&amp;quot;
wide, entrance hole to nest is 10&amp;quot; in diameter.
Lighting
Since August 8, 1976 a 50/50 blend of Gro-lux (1) and Vita-Lites (2).
Photo period maintained the year round is 16 hours' daylight, eight hours off
with a 15 watt incandescent night light.

Diet
Sunflower seed, hard corn, hemp, canary seed, millet seed, peanuts,
Purina pigeon chow pellets (breeder formula) (3). This base mixture has
added to it cold pressed wheat germ oil at the rate of one tablespoon per
pound of seed. Fruit and vegetables rotated every other day. All feeds are
sprinkled liberally with Vionate (4) powder, a vitamin, mineral supplement.

Management
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.98810025" page_id="56283582"  page_num="126" year="" vol="">
Three times yearly each bird gets a physical examination. This involves an
accurate weighing, clipping nails and beak if needed, palpating extremities
etc. for unusual masses, dusting with avian specific ectoparasite powder,
routine fecal examination, radiograph if none previous, cloacal swab for
culture and blood sample if a laboratory equipped to do avian blood is
available.
Note: My fellow aviculturists would find that if a similar programme were
implemented within their collections, when problems did arise one could
present the attending veterinarian with a very informative individual case
history which would greatly enhance the possibility of a successful line of
treatment. All too often veterinarians are presented with birds far past the
point of treatment, only to be condemned for losing the bird when poor
management practices were the greatest contributors to the loss. In addition,
the resulting data from this type of programme, if compiled properly, could
prove invaluable to the aviculturist of the future.
Introduction
December 20,1974. Both birds were introduced into the flight at the same
time, excessive mutual preening followed a brief period of mock threat
displays. Both birds settled down and no aggressive behaviour was observed.
For the next 25 months periods of sexual activity involving loud vocal and
physical displays, followed by frequent copulation, seemed to cycle at four to
six months intervals. During these periods both birds spent considerable
amounts of time excavating the nest cavity in addition to spending time
together in the log.

On the evening of January 14,1976, one egg was observed in the nest box,
January 16, 1976, the second egg was laid. Incubation began with the first
egg, each hatching in 28 days respectively. This being their first attempt the
decision was made to allow the adults to raise the chicks if possible. The diet
at this time did not contain pigeon pellets or Vionate powder, the supplement
in use was Gevral protein (5). The lighting was totally incandescent during
this nesting. The chicks were observed daily by using a mirror and flashlight.
(The viewing door had not been installed prior to this nesting). During this
procedure the male would leave the log and threaten from a nearby perch but
the female remained inside with the chicks visually obstructing a total view

of either chick at any given time. The adults consumed enormous amounts of
fresh corn on the cob almost ignoring their normal fare. The feeding sounds
were extremely audible so I also used these as an indicator for how things
were going. By five weeks both chicks were partially feathered and appeared
to be past any critical stage. It was during this week that I noticed the
vocalizations, lessening in volume but concluded it to be a protective measure
in the wild so as not to attract attention to the nest.
On March 24, 1976, at 4.00 p.m., the flight was fed and I inspected the
chicks, everything appeared normal. We had company that night, the first
time since the hatching. By 10.30 p.m. no feeding sounds had been heard so I
decided to investigate. Both chicks were found dead under the female. See
figure # 1.
My first impression on seeing the trauma-induced areas along the tibia,
femur, carpus and metacarpals was that the male had killed them. On further
inspection the tibia of the left leg on the eldest chick was found to be broken
and rehealed. The real cause of death was disclosed after radiographic
examination. See figure # 2.
Both chicks were suffering from a severe calcium deficiency (see figure #
2) where the broken left tibia is easily demonstrated. In addition to these
obvious breaks close observation revealed numerous hairline and overlay
fractures along the humerus, radius and ulna. The external areas of trauma
were caused by the chicks not being able to balance in the normal tripod
position, thus falling forward and extending the wings to cushion the fall
abrading the wing areas in the process.
April 2, 1976. Replaced Gevral protein in feed with Vionate powder, also
changed light spectrum in the room from 100% incandescent to a 50/50
blend of Gro-lux and Viat-Lites to provide a source of ultra-violet light for
the production of Vitamin D to assimilate proper levels of calcium.
On September 10,1976 a soft shelled egg was found broken on the floor of
the flight. A second egg was not produced during this cycle.
Eggs laid on December 25 and 27, 1976. Incubation went normally. Each
hatched in 28 days respectively. During this nesting period the adults were
given an oral D3 supplement daily on walnuts which they both ate readily.
This addition to the diet was given in the hope it would balance the Vitamin
D requirements and allow the chicks to assimilate the proper levels of
calcium. The daily dose was extrapolated from one used for poultry. By the
second week it was clear something was wrong. The chicks were developing
at a much slower rate than normal. Both chicks died a day apart before the
end of the second week. Histopathological findings of moderate calcification
in the lungs and kidneys suggested the possibility of oversupplementation
with Vitamin D.
Eggs laid on May 21 and 23, 1977 were incubated normally full term but
were infertile.
Eggs laid on December 11 and 13,1977 were incubated normally full term
but were infertile.

Single egg laid on February 3,1978 hatched in 28 days. I allowed the chick
to remain with the adults for six days and then it was removed for hand
rearing. Beginning weight 35.4 gms. the diet to be used this time was
formulated by Ralph and Tina Small (6). Brooder temperature was maintained
at 90* -- 92*F, the chick being fed every two hours settled into this feeding
schedule nicely and over the next nine days gained 68.0 gms. On March 21,
1978 slight respiratory sounds were audible during the morning feeding.
This was noted in the bird's records but not much thought was given to it
since the chick was eating very well, gaining weight, etc. On March 22, 1978
during the morning feeding there was obviously something wrong again.
The respiratory sounds were louder and the breathing was laboured, the
flesh tone of the chick over the next few hours developed a blue tint
indicating the bird was cyanotic.
The chick died in a convulsive state at 12.30 p.m. Histopathological
findings again showed extensive calcification in the lungs and kidneys,
indicating oversupplementation with Vitamin D. Since the diet in use was
identical to the one which Ralph and Tina Small had used to raise many
Umbrella Cockatoos Cacatua alba, I was at a loss as to what happened
variable present was the fact that the respiratory sounds began four days
after the chick's glass brooder was moved from my bedroom to the birdroom.
In effect the chick went from a normal lighting environment of semi-
darkness to full spectrum light with ultra-violet stressed which caused a
rapid lay down of calcium in soft tissue, hence the determination of over-
supplementation of Vitamin D. Under normal conditions psittacine chicks
are not exposed to ultra-violet light until they fledge.
With all this behind me I sat down with my records in hand and began to
establish some parameters for handling the next chick, if I was fortunate
enough to have another chance.

Protocol:
1. Take for hand rearing on day one;
2. Keep in dark to simulate nesting environment;
3. Feed chick every two hours around the clock until the time between
feedings naturally increases;
4. Weigh chick daily to closely monitor the growth rate;
5. Formulate diet.

The first two weeks being the most critical, using "Composition of Foods,
Handbook No. # 8" put out by the USDA (7), I began to compile a list of
foodstuffs frequently used in hand-feeding formulae and compared them to
the food values of feeds known to be available to this species in the wild. My
impression of the resulting data was that hand-feeding formulae for the most
part are too high in protein and are excessively supplemented with vitamins
and minerals. With this particular species one must remember that the
normal time from hatching to fledging is at least 12 weeks. The organism

itself is meant to develop slowly and to artificially accelerate different stages
of this growth phase is surely asking for trouble. Below are the Phase I and
Phase II formulae to be implemented.
Phase I, Day 1 -- Day 14 (inclusive)
1 cup raw wheat germ flakes
1 cup raw shelled peanuts
2 cups Gerber mixed cereal
1 pound 14-grain seed and nut mix (8). Contents: millet, buckwheat,
brown rice, pecans, almonds, sesame seeds, pumpkin seed, sunflower
seed, barley, rye, whole oats, triticale, wheat and alfalfa seed.
Notice no vitamins or minerals added.
1 4^oz jar of Gerber strained creamed spinach
All ingredients are ground until they will pass a 32&amp;quot; nd mesh screen, then
distilled water is added to the desired consistency.
</footnote>
<table confidence="0.45347925" page_id="56283587"  page_num="131" year="" vol="">
Cook approximately 3 mins.
Phase II, Day 15 and on
1 4 l /2 oz jar strained oatmeal with apple sauce and bananas
1 4|/20 z jar strained creamed spinach
1 4^oz jar strained apple sauce
l /2 cup Small's dry diet
l /2 cup Phase I powder (discontinue after two weeks and replace with same
amount of Small's diet)
</table>
<bodyText confidence="0.993585909090909" page_id="56283587"  page_num="131" year="" vol="">
Add distilled water to proper consistency.
Please note, the Phase I and Phase II formulae specify spinach. Its
inclusion has a two-fold purpose -- to keep the peristolisis of the gut mobile
and the high content of oxalic acid in its make-up should help to chemically
bind some of the calcium and magnesium present in the food so it may be
excreted as insoluble oxalates. However the actual extent to which oxalic
acid can limit the utilization of these elements has yet to be established. The
thought behind the oxalic acid is that at this point I feel it is much easier to
correct a deficiency than reverse a toxicity.
Eggs laid on April 27 and 29,1978. Upon inspection of the nest box on April
30, 1978, the first of the two eggs was found broken. The male had been
unusually flighty during this cycle so the decision was made to take the
remaining egg for artificial incubation. The temperature was set at 99%*F
with the humidity at 86%. This temperature and humidity was to be maintained
throughout the 28-day incubation. After the fifth day in the incubator, the
seventh day of actual incubation, it was determined that the egg was fertile
by candling it. The development of the embryo was monitored daily by
placing a high intensity penlite against the egg in order to visualize the
internal changes. The egg was not handled except to turn it five times daily.
The embryo developed at a normal rate until the 17th day when I noticed a
reduction in the vascular pattern surrounding the embryo. The embryo did
not develop past this point. Subsequent sterile cultures did not disclose any

bacterial or fungal invasion.
Eggs laid on July 7 and 9, 1978, 28 days later one egg hatched, the other
proved infertile. Removed chick on August 4, 1978. See figure tf 3 for size
comparison to unhatched egg and quarter. There is dense yellow down in
this species, its distribution especially around the crest area. In order to
maintain the proposed feeding schedule the chick was transported daily to
and from work with me. For the next 14 days the chick was maintained on
the Phase I formula with its increased fibre, reduced protein, vitamin and
mineral content. By day 14 (see figure tf 4) the chick's weight had increased
to 65.7 gms, the daily weight gain was in increments of 1--4 gms on the
Phase I formula as opposed to 1 --12 gms daily on previously used formulae.
Also indicated in figure tf 4 is the technique I used for feeding. The upper
mandible is held while the chick pumps to swallow, the formula is slowly
inserted into the trough of the lower mandible. To me this is a lot cleaner
than other methods and more natural for the chick than using a curved
spoon.
The volume of feed increased from eight drops at each feeding on day one
to 3|/2cc on day 14. At this point I decided to gradually implement the diet
change. (See Phase II formula for specifics). As soon as the Phase II formula
began the weight gains increased to 1 --12 gms daily, usually 10--12 gms. By
day 23 (see figure tf 5) the weight had increased to 118.4 gms and the time
between feedings had stretched to three hours. The chick was maintained
strictly on coarse pine chips in various sized bowls to accommodate the
growth rate and prevent leg problems so often encountered by improper
substrates, etc.
By day 35 the chick's weight was 412.6 gms, see figure tf 6. Figure 3 6
shows size comparison to the egg and also gives an idea of the placement of
feather tracts and feather follicle development. On day 58 the length of time
between feedings extended over five hours frequently, the weight at this
point was 702.6 gms, see figure tf 7.
By day 75 the chick was only being fed twice daily, morning and late
evening. During the day it sampled soft foods, grapes, fresh corn, etc. At this
stage the chick seemed to be gaining control of its motor movements, it was
observed standing on one leg scratching the head with the other, then
holding food in one foot and eating.
On day 115 (see figure tf8) the weight was 781.2 gms, a finished product
completely feathered, flying, cracking seed, etc., but still accepting the late
evening feeding.
During the entire hand feeding process a chart was maintained indicating
the date, time fed, daily weight, amount fed, brooder temperature, nature
and volume of faecal material and miscellaneous comments.
I cannot overemphasize the importance of proper record keeping. It has
proved to be an invaluable aid in accomplishing the successful breeding of
this species and its eventual documentaion. I have been able to compile each
account as it occurred so the reader can draw his own conclusions.

By no means am I attempting to establish set standards by my management
programme. So many articles appear to infer that if their method is used,
success will follow. This is not always so. I have seen producing pairs of
Moluccan Cockatoos housed in spacious 15&apos; wide X 30&apos; long X 6&apos; high
aviaries and on the same token another pair bred in a cage 2&apos; wide X 2&apos; long&apos;
6&apos; high with a 20 gallon metal garbage can attached to the outside. Proven
hand-feeding formulae frequently work in one place but not another. Why?
There are so many variables present that unless proper records are kept,
compiled and eventually published, breeding the larger psittaciformes with
any rate of consistency will continue to evade us.
The role of the aviculturist is changing. In years past just maintaining
certain species was enough. Now this is unacceptable. The whole purpose
for maintaining a species in captivity is to increase our knowledge of its
captive requirements and eventually produce self-sustaining captive populations.

THE BREEDING AND BEHAVIOUR OF THE
YELLOW-THROATED SPARROW Petronia xanthocollis

The petronias, whose general breeding biology and behaviour appears to
be close to that of sparrows in the genus Passer , have received little attention
from aviculturists. The only breeding records for the U.K. are those of
Meade-Waldo, (1896--7) P. petronia and Trollope (1977) P. dentata.
This lack of interest in the genus is not difficult to explain as, even in the
days of uninhibited bird importations, shipments were few and erratic
because of poor demand, as these birds lack colour, singing ability and rarity,
three of the values on which avicultural demand is based. Petronias are not
easy birds to breed, but they are interesting and display little of the inter-
specific aggression attributed to sparrows of the genus Passer. Apart from
their lively and interesting behaviour, I think another avicultural virtue they
possess is that, as hole-nesters, they can fill an ecological 'niche' in an aviary,
without displaying the aggression which some other hole-nesters, such as
titmice demonstrate.
Description (From two males and two females)
A more slender and elegant looking bird than sparrows of the genus
Passer , with a longer pointed conical bill.
Approx. 6 ins. (152.4mm).
Male: Bill, dark horn, showing little if any seasonal change, irides, dark
brown. Upperparts ashy-brown, wings brown with two bars, the upper
white, the lower pale huffish, and a chestnut patch on the lesser wing-coverts.
The chin is greyish-white, with a pronounced yellow patch on the throat.
Underparts greyish becoming white on the abdomen, legs and feet light
brown.
Female: Bill, greyish-brown, the ywllow throat patch is very faint and the
chestnut wing patches are replaced by a pale ruddy brown, not readily
noticeable.
Young birds at 18 days: Bill, light horn, whitish near tip, irides brown, upper-
parts greyish-brown, slight indication of bars on wings, underparts light
grey, feet and legs light brown.
Distribution and habitat
The distribution of P. xanthocollis extends from Iraq, Iran and Afghanistan
almost throughout the Indian subcontinent. Whistler (1963) records that
they are essentially a bird of the trees in both cultivated and barren land, but
avoid heavy forest. They will nest in gardens and readily use nest boxes
where provided.

Two pairs of P. xanthocollis were purchased in July 1974, pairs 'A &amp; B',
they were rung with coloured identification rings. The male of pair 'B' died
during the winter of 1974. The surviving three birds were housed in an
outside bird room from November to April, heated to approx. 50*F, and with
artificial light provided until 2030 hours. Pair 'A' were released into a planted
aviary every season in April.

Food and Feeding
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.990975914285714" page_id="56283592"  page_num="136" year="" vol="">
The birds are fed on mixed millet canary mixture and live food, mainly
maggots. Greenfood such as chickweed and seeding grasses are provided
when available, while cuttlefish (crushed) fine grit and oystershell are always
provided. As noted with P. dentata most live food is accepted with the
exception of white worms.
Breeding
In 1977 and 1978, pair 'A' were released into an aviary planted with privet
bushes, a wide variety of nesting receptacles from waxbill-type nesting
baskets, to budgerigar nest-boxes were provided. The aviary measured
3.25X1.5X2.25m, clumps of gorse were hung up to provide additional
nesting sites and cover. In both seasons a nest was made in a budgerigar nest
box and eggs were laid; however they were deserted and some were found on
the aviary floor under the nest box.
In April 1979, pair 'A' were released into a planted aviary (which measured
3.25 X 1.5 X 2.25m high). On 14th May, the male bird was observed
'singing' at the entrance hole of a budgerigar nest box hung on the aviary side
some 2m from ground level at the front of the aviary, during the next few
days this activity continued and he was seen displaying to the female. On
19th May the female was seen carrying dried grass, feathers and bits of paper
to the nest box, and both sexes, spent some time inside the box. The pair
were seen copulating on a perch on 11th June, the nest contained one egg
when I examined the box. A second egg was laid on 12th June and a third on
the 13th. As far as I could ascertain, incubation commenced with the third
egg, but the birds were very wary about entering the box if they thought that
they were being observed and I used binoculars to watch them. Three chicks
hatched on the 28th June and the parents displayed great excitement, flying
up and down the aviary and continually flying back to the box and going
inside. I suppied lots of small maggots (known as 'pinkies' to fishermen)
and tipped a collection of insects and spiders into the aviary twice a day;
these were obtained by beating nettle&apos;beds with a stick, into a plastic bag.
The parent birds soon learnt that this bag contained live food, and would fly
down to the aviary floor as soon as they saw the bag, waiting for me to shake
out the contents. Six days after the chicks were hatched, I supplied the birds
with mealworms, but these were ignored. Although the adults had shown
little interest in mealworms when not breeding, I thought they might like

them when they had chicks. The parents would never fly to the box directly
if they thought they were being observed, but would fly to the rear of the
aviary and work their way back to the box, using the gorse clumps on the
aviary sides as cover. Both parents were soon removing fecal sacs from the
nest box, and the chicks' hunger calls could be heard from the seventh day
after hatching.
One chick left the nest at 1700 hours on 12th July and the second at 1830
hours. The remaining chick was out of the nest in the a.m. of the 13th. The
pattern of care for the young at this stage seemed to be similar to that of P.
dentata ,, the male bird feeding the young. The female spent a lot of time in
the box on the 13th and an egg was laid on the 14th and a second on the 15th,
the female incubating the second clutch. The young birds of the first brood
were flying on the 14th, and one was seen feeding itself on the 22nd, although
they were still soliciting food from the cock on the 24th. The chicks were
completely independent and removed from the aviary on 3rd August.
The second brood which consisted of two chicks were dead on the 6th;
they appeared to be well nourished and no apparent cause of death was
obvious.
Eggs
Greenish-white ground colour marked with brown and ashy brown, not
so heavily marked as those of P. dentata.
Nest
A crude cup made in a mass of dried grass, paper etc., which nearly filled
the whole nest box, the cup was lined with feathers: as with P. dentata there
was no indication of any attempt to use any other nest site than a hole.
Chicks
Unlike P. dentata , the chicks of the first brood did not return to the nest
box after leaving. The chicks of the second brood had a purplish skin and
showed dark grey areas of feather growth. The gape and palate markings
were white.
Voice
The advertising call is given by the male at the nest box, long before and
after nesting has commenced. The call or 'song' is a cheerful but rather
monotonous 'chip-chop, chip, chip-chop, chirric-chik'. When aggression is
displayed to other birds a 'churr-churr' note is given.
Displays
The sexual display consists of the male approaching the female with the
head lifted, displaying the yellow throat patch to her. The posture is not so
upright as that of P. dentata and the wings are moved, so displaying the
chestnut patches. The threat display is a head forward movement; sometimes

BREEDING THE BROLGA

Baraboo, Wisconsin, USA)
The International Crane Foundation has maintained a pair of Australian
Cranes or Brolgas Grus rubicundus since 1974 without breeding success until
1979. Beginning in 1976 the Brolgas at ICF were subjected to periodic
artificial rain in an effort to simulate the Australian rainy season in which
they breed. In 1979 the artificial rain was increased to a one hour period in
the morning and a one hour period in the afternoon beginning in June. The
rain was produced by using three soaker hoses (each 25 feet long) suspended
above the pen on the flight netting and was operated daily by student
researcher Kate Lindsay.
The Brolga enclosure consists of an unheated shelter (4.6m X 4.6m) and
an outside pen (13.7m X 18.2m) covered with nylon mesh flight netting. The
pen contains tall grass with a few shrubs and is surrounded by old Christmas
trees for privacy.
Because both birds are flightless they are artificially inseminated during
the breeding season. This year AI was done every other day beginning in
May. The male produced 45 semen samples from May 4th to August 24th
averaging .19ml per ejaculate. The female Brolga laid her first and only egg
on July 30th after receiving 28 good inseminations.
The brownish spotted egg was immediately collected and placed in a
forced air incubator at 37*C dry bulb and 30*C wet bulb. While in the
incubator the egg was turned automatically every 2 hours. On the 26th day
the egg was transferred to the hatcher and was not turned thereafter. The
hatcher is maintained at 33*C wet bulb. During the incubation period the
198.6 gram egg showed a 13% weight loss.
The silver grey chick hatched on August 30th after an incubation period of
31 days. The chick pipped at 1400 hours on August 29th and was helped
from the shell 28 hours later. The chick weighed 122.1 grams 16 hours after
hatching. The chick was fed a 23% protein starter diet in a ^inch pellet form.
It was first observed drinking water at 2 days of age and also began eating
pellets from a spoon on the second day. The chick's weight fluctuated up and
down for the first four days but began to increase steadily by the fifth day.
The chick was eating well on its own by the fourth day.
The brooder pen is about 1 metre square and is located in a heated room
kept at 25.5*C by an electric space heater. A 250 watt red heatlamp suspended
above the floor maintains the brooder pen at about 31*C through a plug-in
thermostat. A second heatlamp is connected to a back-up thermostat and set
to operate in case the first lamp fails. The floor of the pen is covered with
indoor-outdoor carpeting which is changed twice a day. The chick was taken
outside for short exercise periods beginning on the first day and allowed to
swim for a few minutes in a wading pool every day the temperature permitted.

C. LaRUE - BREEDING THE BROLGA
While exercising, the chick frequently catches and eats grasshoppers, crickets
and other insects.
By two weeks of age the chick was moved to a large pen with sand on the
floor. The exercise periods were increased and the chick's diet was changed
to a 19% grower ration also made in the Vs inch pellet. The chick's weight
gain is monitored closely through daily weighing to prevent leg problems.
The daily weight gain is kept below 20% and is regulated by exercise and by
switching to the lower protein grower diet at two weeks of age.
The adult Brolgas are fed a 20.5% protein breeder diet during the summer
and a 19% protein maintenance diet during the winter. The adult pellet is
3 /i6 inch and is accepted by young birds when they are 4--6 weeks old. The
only supplements fed include small amounts of whole corn during the winter
and vitamins in the drinking water for young birds during their first 6 weeks.
At the time of this writing the chick is 30 days old, doing well, and weighs
963.9 grams. The adult birds have started moulting and appear to be finally
adjusted to our northern hemisphere seasons.

BREEDING ATTEMPT WITH THE GOLDEN-COLLARED
HONEYCREEPER IN 1977

Tangara pulcherrima
By A. McEWEN (Plymouth, Devon)
The Golden-collared Honeycreeper, until recently was placed as sole
representative of the genus Iridophanes (de Schauensee, 1970) but is now
generally included with the Tangara (Ingels, 1974; Gruson, 1976).
The male has a black head, upper mantle and tail-coverts. Breast and sides
of body are straw coloured with lower breast and abdomen whitish. The
collar is bright golden yellow and wings purplish blue. Sexual dimorphism
exists with the female lacking the golden collar and having a greenish back
and greyish breast and throat. A coloured plate depicting the male appears in
de Schauensee.
The pair were obtained in October 1975 when still immature. The male at
the time being much the same colour as the female. From the first the pair
were very bold and confiding and the cock was seen to feed the hen several
times each day, even though they were, as already mentioned, still in
immature plumage.
By January 1976 both birds had completed a moult and were now in full
colour. In early April a cup-shaped nest was built in the fork of a branch in
the outside flight and constructed mainly of sheep's wool and dry leaves.
However, no use was made of it.
In the same month of 1977 the same site was used to construct a similar
nest, this time using horse hair as no sheep's wool was available. Both of these
nests were built by the male only. No eggs were laid but the female was seen
to spend the whole of one day sitting in it and being fed by the cock.
Within a few days of seeing this unusual behaviour the male was seen to
"attack" the female repeatedly and very aggressively. These attacks took
place inside the birdroom, even while I was present. The cock would fly at
the hen at terrifying speed, "screaming" his high pitched call note and
seemingly oblivious of the other birds in the birdroom. The female, with
equal speed, would dash wildly about before finally landing in a place where
she might avoid the male. During the periods she remained hidden, the male
searched for her and "screamed" in an agitated manner. Eventually, she
would break from cover and the whole mad dash would be repeated. After
the third of these chases the cock, doing his usual searching for the hen,
spotted her, and, as before, dashed at her in just the same furious fashion as
on the three previous occasions. This time, however, the hen remained
cowering where she was, whereupon the male landed on herback and fed her.
The following day a nest was being constructed, again of horse hair and
dry leaves and also in the fork of a branch, but this time inside the birdroom.
This nest was again, so far as could be seen, built solely by the male, with the
female seeming very indifferent to what was going on, though she did, on two

occasions, visit it with him. Within a few days, and with the nest still
incomplete, the hen w r as seen building a second nest in a nest box, also in the
birdroom and at the highest point available within it (the cock's nest being
some 4ft off the ground, while the hen's was approximately 6ft 6ins.). The
nest box was the type normally intended for small finches and was 5 inches
square with a small oblong slot at the top of the front to facilitate inspection.
The nest within was made of coarse fibres, removed from disused furniture;
these formed the cup which was later lined with horse hair.
The two nests were eventually completed after about a week with neither
bird helping the other to complete their nest. They still flew together when
visiting the outside flight but seemed oblivious to each other's building
activities. The male, however, continued to feed his spouse through this
period,
This period of great activity was followed, much to my surprise, by a long
period of almost total inactivity. Neither bird seemed its usual boisterous self
and both were very quiet during this period; though they were noted for their
constant calling to each other, even this seemed to occur only rarely. Most
important of all, however, was the fact that the pair showed no interest at all
in either of the two nests which they had spent so much time building.
I had begun to believe that all of this was just a false alarm when, after
roughly one week, I entered the birdroom to see the hen sitting in the nest
which she had built in the nest box. The cock was in attendance on a perch
about one foot away. He was continuously uttering a call I had not heard
from him before. It consisted of only two notes, one high and one low, and
was delivered slowly but at regular intervals. He maintained this constant
calling for about an hour after I entered the birdroom. I never heard this call
at any time again.
The cock eventually fed her on the nest very excitedly several times in a
relatively short space of time. Later, the hen left the nest to fly with the cr&amp;gt;ck
into the outside flight which gave me a chance to look in the nest box; it
contained one egg.
The cock now became very aggressive for the first time towards the other
birds in the birdroom which approached the vicinity of the nest. He never
actually attacked any of the birds however; he simply drove them away from
the immediate area in which the nest was situated and then returned to his
perch near the nest. The second egg was laid the following day.
The hen carried out incubation alone and, since she and the male would
make occasional trips together to the outside flight, it was possible for me to
regularly check that the eggs were alright. They seemed surprisingly large
for the size of the bird and were a pronounced oblong shape, pale bluish-grey
in colour with rust coloured streaks -- faintest at the narrow end and
becoming gradually more dense over the length of the egg until, at the blunt
end, they converged to form a solid patch of rusty brown. I noticed with
interest that the eggs were turned lengthways daily. The blunt ends facing
the nest box entrance one day and the narrow ends facing the entrance the
next, and so on.

The first chick was hatched early one morning with the second hatching
around 2.30 p.m. the same day. It was now that the real difficulty presented
itself for, although the parents had always taken maggots and mealworms
since their arrival, they refused to feed anything but flies to the young. They,
themselves, continued to take nectar, fruit and softfood.
Since there were very few flies about within the birdroom, it was necessary
for me to begin catching them myself out in the garden and bring them into
the birdroom for the birds to take. A reasonably successful method was
found of achieving this by placing an empty milk bottle over a fly which was
sunning itself on a leaf or such, it invariably flew upwards into it. It was
possible to catch 10 -- 12 flies at a time in this manner without any escaping.
These were then released into the birdroom where they were eagerly snapped
up by the parents. It was necessary to repeat this process as often as 20 times
a day to keep up with the demand for them by the parent birds who got so
used to the procedure over the following three weeks that, as I entered the
birdroom, they would sometimes, in their anxiety to get at the flies, land
upon the bottle while I was still holding it.
It should be mentioned that all other birds sharing their aviary had been
removed prior to the hatching of the chicks so there was no competition for
any live food placed in the birdroom.
Another aviculturist friend in my area, knowing of my plight would help
out with fly catching operations when he could and would also bring with
him any spiders he happened to find. The latter were taken by the birds along
with flies (blue bottles) but greenfly, fruitfly, beetles and grasshoppers were
all ignored when offered.
In the evenings when there were no bluebottles about, it was possible to
catch horseflies instead but, although they were taken, they were not so
much in favour with the parents as had been the bluebottles. Once the hen
had settled for the evening, usually around 6 p.m. nothing further was taken
for the young, even though there was still two or three hours of daylight left.
At one point the hen was seen to take a piece of pear to the nest and offer it
to the young but it must have been refused for she left the nest still carrying it
in her beak.
The youngsters developed well and after six days were seen to have their
eyes partially open, the following day they were fully open. They feathered up
slowly but seemed perfectly alright. When almost completely feathered it
was easily seen that they were cock and hen. The young cock being black and
fawn in the areas where, as an adult, he would be black and golden straw
coloured. At this age, however, there was no blue, these areas, wings and tail,
being black also. The young hen was a dull version of the adult hen.
Unfortunately, the young cock was found dead in the nest at 13 days old. I
had noticed for some time previously that the young hen -- the larger of the
two -- was getting more than her fair share of the food being offered, often
reaching past the young male to take the food being offered to him. But there
was nothing I could think of to do to prevent this.

The hen continued to thrive and was often seen preening herself in the
nest. One day however, she was found out of the nest and, when checked,
was found to have a long piece of horse hair knotted around her foot. I have
never experienced this trouble with sheep's wool and would never use
horse hair again as a nesting material. Although the hair was carefully
removed it was obvious that it had tangled around the foot some time ago
since it never took on the correct attitude and remained slightly turned
inwards and semi-closed.
The youngster itself seemed very fit and, when returned to the nest soon
settled down to calling for food. This deliberate calling to be fed by the
chicks, was noticed after the first few days of their being hatched.
In the evenings the hen would settle on the nest for the night as she had
from the first. At no time was the cock ever seen to actually go on the nest.
Indeed, the only time he visited it at all was to feed either the hen or the
chicks.
The chick eventually left the nest at 17 days old and was continued to be
fed by the parents. That is until the 23rd day when, on entering the birdroom
it was found drowned in a shallow dish of water on the floor where, I
presume it must have landed having taken its first flight -- with a 10ft X 8ft
floor area in which to land it found a 6 inch diameter dish of water.
The adults were fluttering about in obivous distress and were calling
piteously. This distress was short lived and it was not long before the hen was
seen repairing the same nest she used in the box. There followed the period
of complete inactivity and again after roughly one week, the hen was found
sitting on the nest.
When the opportunity arose to check, she was found to be sitting on only
one egg. During her incubation of this egg I saw and heard the cock singing
what I can only describe as one of the saddest sounding songs that I have ever
heard from a bird. It was the only time I had heard him truly "sing", indeed, I
had thought that this species had no real song at all. I never heard him sing
like that other than on that one occasion.
The egg eventually hatched and, again, I was faced with the fly-catching
problem. However, this time, unlike the previous occasion, the weather was
particularly cold and therefore very few flies were to be seen let alone caught.
I therefore decided to let the parents fly at liberty in the garden to catch
whatever food they chose.
I had done this some time before with Pekin Robins quite successfully and
could see no reason why it should be that this species prove any less faithful
to their young. A hole was opened in the wire-netting and it wasn't long
before the male came out, looked around excitedly, dashed into the nearest
shrub -- and was never seen again!
Rightly or wrongly I decided to leave the hole open to allow the hen
opportunity to catch food for her youngster and, hopefully to allow the male
to re-enter should he return. The hen, although she came into the outside
flight, did not go through the hole but went from corner to corner of the

flight calling loudly for the cock.
Ironically, on the following day, blowfly chrysalids set inside the birdroom
to hatch into flies for the birds to feed to any young, did hatch and the
birdroom then abounded with blowflies which the hen fed to the chick.
Periodically she would go into the outside flight and, again, spend some little
time calling for the male.
The chick appeared to flourish under her attention until the 7th day when
on entering the birdroom, the chick was found dead on the birdroom floor.
Needless to say that the hen had finally made use of the hole in the wire. I
never could fathom why the chick died so abruptly, and though I kept a vigil
for many weeks after, I never saw either of the adult pair again.

Colius macrourus
By L. GIBSON (Burnaby, British Columbia)
The half-dozen species of Colius all live in Africa, from the southern edge
of the Sahara desert to the Cape Province. C. macrourus lives in a wide band
across the continent just south of the Sahara and is, like other Colius , a dry
area bird, which is naturally at home in fairly arid country. The range of this
species falls mostly between 650 -- 3,000 ft (200 -- 900m), but other species
are found in the 5 -- 6,000 ft (1500 -- 1800m) plateaux of South Africa,
where they may encounter cool nights. These birds are therefore used to
wide variations between day and night temperatures, but they are all miserable
in wet conditions. They have adapted well to farmland, parkland and
suburban gardens, and can be found inside many city limits. Regarded as a
threat to crops, they are fair game to farmers, gardeners and small boys. If
concentrated in any numbers Colius could do considerable damage to fruit
crops. In addition, they may eat or damage a variety of leaves, flowers and
vegetables.
Mousebirds are interesting to watch as they are completely unlike other
birds in habits and appearance, indeed they are in a scientific order all by
themselves. To anyone who has kept these birds, the suggestion is nonsense
that the name is due to rodent-like "running about". This statement is
repeated in several books, probably all copying some obscure misinformed
source, as is fairly common practice in avicultural literature. In foliage, they
proceed in deliberate jumps, and on the ground they move in clumsy hops
for very short distances.
The birds are uncomfortable on the ground and spend as little time there
as possible, and the maximum amount of travel noted there was five hops.
Due to the long tail and the peculiarities of the leg, they are unable to take off
from the ground as readily as normal birds. No doubt they are called
mousebirds because of the long tail and the short brownish-grey, fur-like
body feathers.
Colius are not active flyers, and are not built for easy flight. The wings are
small and the long tail seems to unbalance the bird, so that, in a short flight at
least they fly with the body tilted slightly, head-up and tail down. The
perferred and usual landing position is with the body almost vertical, so that
they land woodpecker-like against the chosen surface. Landing horizontally
involves something of a flop, especially on the ground. When the birds enter
a dense bush with no obvious branch to land upon, they simply crash
through the leaves until the feet find a grip. When chased within the confines
of the aviary, they crash about in a similar manner. When undisturbed, the
normal method of movement within a bush is slow and deliberate, consisting
of a hop or jump, followed by a definite pause, the bird usually being
inclined more towards the vertical than the horizontal. This upright stance is

normal for mousebirds.
The inner toe of the Colius is reversible and the birds are commonly seen
perching on a vertical surface with all four toes pointing upwards (forward).
However, the first toe may be out sideways in a horizontal plane, or pointing
down.
The fourth (outer) toe is also reversible, but from my observations at least,
it is not so commonly used this way, whereas the first toe is used freely in
either direction. When the bird is sitting on top of a thin branch, the toes grip
in the normal manner of three forward and one (the first) back. When
perching horizontally or when standing, the bird rests on the tarsi. It
commonly rests the abdomen on a branch, but does not do this when eating
at the feeding table. Mousebirds are incapable of standing up "normally' on
their legs for more than a few seconds, and this is usually seen only when they
are hopping. To the uninformed, they look like they have broken legs or
rickets {Rachitis). This is because the leg is structured to be free swinging,
and they can hang upright with the feet above the head, like swinging
gibbons, or bats in reverse. The birds can hover a bit, and they can fly fairly
straight up to the roof and cling there. Because of these clinging habits, the
feet are disproportionately large and powerful, as are the tarsi, evidently at
the expense of the upper leg. As can be gathered from the above, one should
make provision for the perching requirements of these birds.
The tail is 8in (20cm) long, and is two-thirds of the total length of the bird.
The shafts are very thick and rigid at the base, but taper to fine soft tips. The
tail is used as a support against vertical surfaces and for this reason as much
as a quarter of the length may be worn away by moulting time. The tail
feathers are in matched pairs, the two central ones being longest. The shafts
are lined with very short barbs, so there is practically no surface for air-lift.
Probably for this reason (rather than length and weight) the tail drops in
flight. By contrast, the tail is useful as a balance against the forward perching
position of the feet.
Mousebirds are by nature very wary and they retain this characteristic in
the aviary. In a cage or very small aviary they panic readily. This fact, along
with their odd perching habits, (not to mention their copious droppings),
makes them totally unsuitable to life in a cage. They do best in an earth-
floored aviary with some dense cover, roofed over at least partially, to keep
some of the bushes dry. They also appreciate some sunlight, especially early
or late in the day.
The four adult birds I obtained were nervous in a confined space, but
when moved to a large aviary they settled well and could be observed freely
from a discreet distance. They still moved to the opposite side whenever an
observer approached the wire, and they would not come down to feed if
anyone was nearby, but they are not skulkers. They only became disturbed if
the aviary was entered, and then only a little.
As Colius do not like flying, much of their spare time is spent lounging
about, preferring a wide branch or ledge to support the whole body while

they sunbathe or preen. Most of the time they could be seen in the open, and
only kept to dense cover when nesting or shepherding chicks or, of course, if
being chased. The favourite socialising place was a small dead pear tree. All
non-breeding activity is always carried out in a group, and an isolated bird is
very uncomfortable. They are completely gregarious and even when nesting
never molested smaller birds, although they can hold their own at the
feeding table. The nearest they came to being aggressive was a half-hearted
peck at any other species who happened to be monopolising the banana, (this
usually worked). However, they never did this to each other, and never used
a threat posture, even if the nest was disturbed, although this has been
described for other species of Coitus. The only time they became really
agitated was when the newly fledged chicks were being caught up for
photographing. Both parents then came very close, especially the hen, and
gave a few excited whistles.
At night all four birds roosted together, except when nesting. They sleep
head-up, with the feet grasping a twig just above the head. The bodies are
pressed together with the tails meeting perfectly so that it is difficult to tell
how many birds are in the bunch. Alternatively they will roost on a vertical
surface, usually the wire, and at the highest point available. In this case they
press together side-by-side. This sleeping position makes them vulnerable to
cats, and should be discouraged by chasing the birds inwards at dusk. The
high altitude plateaux habitat in some parts of the mousebirds' range can
drop to quite low night temperatures in the winter (e.g. around 40*F (5*C)
or less, and probably for this reason the birds have developed their protective
roosting habit. This is further made necessary by the sparse hair-like covering
of the body feathers. Colius will huddle together during the day if it cold.
After a cold night they can be seen against the wire, thawing out in the scant
rays of the morning sun.
It has been suggested that they are partly poikilothermic. Although they
provide mutual protection from the cold, I would not like to keep them
outside at freezing temperatures. Night temperatures did drop to the mid-
thirties *F (2*C) every night when they were nesting, and there was nightly
frost starting two nights before the chicks fledged. But the birds were always
dry. They are very miserable when wet, and would probably succumb
rapidly if they got both cold and wet at night.
Health
The mousebirds were never sick and, at the time of writing, (chicks six
months old), all are in good health. They are one of the few species I have
kept in which no parasites were found/ They have come through three
moults without any problems. An adult bird weighs around 50g.
Housing
When the birds were acquired it was midwinter, necessitating housing
them indoors. These birds love to eat, and they presented a problem in that

they were eating enough bananas to finance a small revolution in South
America, and consequently were producing enough guano to start a modest
fertilizer plant. Their penchant for clinging to the wire sides of the cage
made cleaning up all the more difficult. In their favour, the droppings are on
the dry side and, like everything else about these birds, they are strange and
unbirdlike. The problem was lessened by covering the inside of the roof with
plastic sheeting and leaving a large square of bare wire in the centre.
Droppings were (more or less) confined to the middle of the floor after that,
and cleaned up by peeling off a layer of newspaper about twice a day.
In the spring the birds were moved outside to a small, roofed aviary which
they enjoyed, but which was unsuitable for nesting because of the lack of
plant cover. They were later moved to a large aviary 32ft X 10ft X 7ft high
(9.7 X 3 X 2.1) which had dense cover in the shelter end, and a wide
assortment of flowers and seeding plants, interspersed with lettuce covering
the rest of the ground. The shelter area is solid wood on the north end, with
acrylic sheeting on the side and roof, for a quarter of the length of the aviary.
The far (east) side of the aviary is formed by the garden wall, which is made
of solid concrete blocks, and backed by a row of dense Chamaecyparis trees.
The highest plants are in the shelter and consist of a dense tangle of wisteria
and honeysuckle at roof height, above a rhododendron. Just outside the roof
area is a fairly thin weigela bush 6ft (2m) high. The vegetation outside the
shelter area was kept lower and thinner, to encourage birds to roost in the
covered area. The mousebirds shared the area with six Chloropsis and a hen
Blackcap S. atricapilla , hen Shama and a pair of Leiothrix. Later five rails
were added. Because several Chloropsis insisted on sleeping in the wiegela,
the area above it was roofed over with plastic sheeting. The sides of the
aviary are of 16 gauge ^in X lin welded wire. This is an important
consideration for Colius as they frequently perch on the wire. Thinner wire
netting would be damaging to their feet.

Feeding
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999763" page_id="56283605"  page_num="149" year="" vol="">
The preferred feeding situation is arboreal, and the birds were fed at a
stand made of concrete blocks. When given a choice, they would not eat on
the ground, and descended there only to have a sand-bath, which they took
several times a week. They never bathed in water. An old report on wild
mousebirds mentions that they gathered at a red "mineral-earth" patch,
presumably to eat the minerals. I never saw them take grit, as do all
omnivorous birds, and they ignored red mineral grit, sold for pigeons.
Possibly these wild birds were just bathing, and it is strange that no one
seems to have recorded the fact that they are earth-bathers or, at least, I have
not seen such a report.
Reports have been made of mousebirds eating vegetables in African
gardens, but mine never once landed on the ground to eat the wide assortment
of plants, including lettuce, to be found there. It is interesting to note that
they stripped a large brassica plant by hanging from a rhododendron bush to

do so.
A similar plant nearby was not touched because it could not be reached
from a branch, yet the plant itself was big enough (1m) to be perched upon.
This mystery plant sprang from bird seed (which the Colius never touched).
Strangely, the birds never ate greens from their feeding dish, and did not
touch leaves of the aforementioned plant when they were pulled and placed
on the feeding table. The other plant eaten was a weigela bush. Only new
shoots and young leaves were taken. Some damage was done to new honeysuckle
shoots,but it was not clear whether the Colius or the Chloropsis did this. Large
masses of yellow broom flowers Genista were put in the aviary, when in
season. The mousebirds ate the insides of these flowers, usually biting out
the stamens.
They could have been attracted by either the pollen or the nectar. Nectar-
milk, put in for the Chloropsis , was consumed regularly by the mousebirds
and yet I never once saw them drink water, although others have seen this.
Probably the dry nature of the natural habitat has modified the need of the
Colius to drink water, and much of the required moisture is obtained from
food. Ground-growing flowers in the aviary were untouched, but red rhodo-
dendron flowers were pulled off and dropped uneaten. Although I suspect
the Colius had a hand in this, only a Chloropsis was actually caught in the act.
Rather conservative feeders in the aviary as far as variety goes, the
mousebirds made up for this by disposing of huge quantities of the preferred
foodstuff. No nibblers, they fill up to the brim at each feed, and I once saw a
bird take 75 bites of banana, without a pause, in exactly 3 minutes. This is a
long, single feeding time for a small bird. When newly obtained, they
moulted soon afterwards on a diet of banana spread with soft margarine and
little else. Banana was always eaten first, and apple, orange and pear were
eaten only when the banana was finished. C. macrourus is one of the few
species in my collection that would not eat bread. They snacked regularly on
scrambled egg, which was originally put in for other birds, and they ate some
rice pudding. Some soft berries, like raspberries, were eaten when nothing
else was left, but hard berries were never touched. Assorted cooked and raw
vegetables were only eaten if the birds were getting desperate and no live
food or meat of any kind was eaten. They would not eat "insectivorous"
mixture.
Assorted small eggs (e.g. Zosterops), were placed on the feeding table, but
they were not even damaged. Eggshell was not eaten. Food was never
chopped up. Banana was fed whole with a strip of skin peeled off. Other large
fruits, such as apple, were cut in half. The raptor-like razor-edged beak is
ideal for quickly slicing pieces out of fruit. Apple for instance, is eaten neatly
down to a paper-thin skin. Yet the formidable beak is never used in anger or
in defence, even if the bird is held in the hand. Sometimes food is held under
the foot, which in spite of its parrot-like versatility is never used to pick up
food. No doubt this is because the bird could not stand on one leg.

The mousebirds were more reluctant than most to try new foods. When I
was experimenting with this, they held out as long as possible, whistling so
plaintively that I often gave in and supplied them with banana. About half a
large banana was consumed per day by each bird, along with some other
food. Margarine was seldom spread on the bananas when it was noted that
the birds were drinking milk and eating egg.

Calls and Sexing
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999755151515151" page_id="56283607"  page_num="151" year="" vol="">
These very quiet birds were never heard to make any noise other than a
single long whistle. The call is rather plaintive although not unattractive,
and was never found to be annoying or boring. They use the whistle to
communicate if they are apart, and thus help to bring the flock together
again. The call was also used in alarm if they were flushed (e.g. from the
feeding table). If the food dish was not replenished for some time, the birds
hung around and called forlornly. Calling was not noted in courtship or
during nesting, and the only other situation in which it was heard was when
chicks were being chased for examination.
The chicks themselves were quiet, only cheeping a little in the nest. Just
after they fledged they were heard to call like the adults. So the same call is
used in several situations. It is used commonly for communication, and
whenever these phlegmatic birds get excited. Perhaps they have subtle
differences in pitch etc., which only they can hear. This could easily be
checked with the right equipment.
The whistle is low-pitched and one bird had a slight but noticeable
increase in pitch over the others. It was fairly certain that this was the
smallest bird, and it was also surmised that this was the only hen. This bird
could be spotted by its shorter tail, (by about 1cm). The other 3 birds were
slightly larger, and were all the same size. All four birds were identical in
colour, as viewed in the aviary. The difference in tail lengths could only be
seen if the birds were together, especially on the wire.
The difference in whistle pitch is probably a good way to pick a pair, and is
a method that has not been exploited by aviculturists. For instance, Zosterops
can be sexed this way, and in my experience, with several species, the hen has
the higher pitched call, as would be expected.
Practically no signs of courtship were seen, although it must be admitted
that not much attention was being paid to the Colius because of the lateness
of the season. On and off through the year, one or other large bird was seen to
feed the small one. During nesting, while the presumed father was incubating,
one large bird fed the off-duty mother, then they locked beaks and twisted
their heads from side to side for a few seconds and that is as worked up as
they were ever seen to get.

Nest and Eggs
In spite of their rather clumsy comings and goings, the mousebirds were
remarkably secretive nesters. So much so that the first clutch had been laid
for nearly a week before being spotted, and no nest-building had been seen.
This was partly because no courtship activity was evident earlier, and the
late date added to the surprise. The eggs were first noticed on August 27th,
1978. It may have been more than a coincidence that the eggs were laid
during a very wet spell, following almost six weeks of warm, dry weather.
This follows the pattern of wild birds in savanna areas, who nest during or
immediately after the brief wet season.
The nest was in a small wicker basket. This was originally a closed basket
in which waxbills had nested. It had started to come apart, so had been
unwound for about half its length then stood on end, to give a somewhat
tapered cup S^in (9cm) across at the top. It had some ribs sticking up around
the rim to a height of 4 -- 6 ins (10 -- 15 cm). This unlikely site was crammed to
its full depth of 3^ in (9cm) with lumps of short grass, pulled mostly from
dry turf. No weaving was involved. The filling was almost level with the top
of the basket, leaving only a slight depression. The only attempt at a lining
was the addition of 3 Chloropsis body feathers. The basket was wired 5ft
(1.5m) up in a thin weigela bush, but there was a thick umbrella of leaves at
the top of the bush which effectively hid the nest.
Two eggs were laid, and both hatched. The eggs were rather symmetrical
(ellipsoidal) and were a matt white and chalky to the touch. Reddish-brown
angular spots and short thin scratch-like marks were fairly evenly distributed
over the eggs. Some of these marks looked so like chips in the shell that some
anxious moments were experienced before it was ascertained that they were
merely markings.
The weather was very wet and cool during incubation, the highest day
temperature being 56*F (13*C) and the lowest night recording 39*F (4*C).
The eggs were never left uncovered for more than a second or two, one bird
nearly touching the other when they changed over. Most of the incubation
was done by the hen, and she was fed on the nest by her mate by regurgitation.
It was not determined if the hen fed the cock on the nest, but this was
unlikely as she was off for shorter spells of up to half an hour. It was fairly
certain that the two non-breeding birds did not bring food to the nest, but
due to the identical appearance of the birds, this could not be completely
ruled out, for they all shared other activities. It was certain, however, that
only two birds shared the incubation. The male bird slept beside the nest at
night, and possibly in it. The thick canopy of leaves made it impossible to
check his exact position. The other two birds roosted together elsewhere.
Both birds sat very tight, and neither flushed readily. Even after several
hours of unbroken incubating, the hen would not leave until I was less than a
yard (lm) from the nest, and obviously going to touch it. A daily inspection
did not upset the birds unduly, and they always waited at a discreet distance.

<bodyText confidence="0.991071704545455" page_id="56283609"  page_num="153" year="" vol="">
The incubating bird always returned directly to the nest immediately after
the aviary was vacated. The normal cautious approach to the nest was used
only when there was already one parent sitting. They appeared to be
concerned about the eggs cooling. The other two birds were unaffected by
the inspections and did not appear concerned about the nest. It was difficult
to say if they were directly concerned about the fledged chicks as all the birds
stayed in a fairly tight group.
The grey colour of the birds blended very well with the dark green foliage.
The sitting bird covered the small nest and yet was difficult to see. It further
aided concealment by sticking its tail up alongside a wicker rib or weigela
twig. The tail was never left sticking straight out or hanging down over the
rim of the nest and the bird sat facing in random directions. The birds were
always cautious about approaching the nest, especially when the chicks had
hatched. The nest was only 6ft (2m) from the feeding table, but the bird
collecting food always flew to the end of the aviary, then approached the nest
circuitously, stopping at every patch of cover on the way.
The incubation period was not determined exactly for various reasons, but
it is very short, probably 10--11 days, and not more than twelve. A strange
thing happened with the second clutch. When the first chicks were three
weeks old, three eggs were laid. Six and seven days later two more eggs
appeared. The later eggs were normal-sized at 21 X 16mm, while the first
three were slightly smaller, with the smallest being 20 X 15mm. All 5 were
fertile and the first one hatched on October 4th, but the chick had difficulty
in getting out of the shell and was only half out by 1 p.m. Normally they are
out within three hours of sunrise. The next day it was missing, and the
following day the two, now very dark, 'old' eggs were broken open. They
contained dead chicks of about a week old. Six days after the first chick
hatched, a healthy chick emerged from a 'new' egg, followed by another
chick the next day. Although possibly a second hen laid in the nest, I very
much doubt it. But I am at a loss to explain the double clutch. It was as if the
bird knew that the first clutch was defective, because the second eggs were
laid at about the time the first two stopped development.
Chicks
The chicks hatched on successive days, so incubation must commence
immediately. C. macrouris chicks are completely naked, and the body is grey
with a yellowish tinge. They look very like psittacines, with their hooked
beaks. The head area, including the beak, is a horrible bilious yellow-green
colour, and there is a white spot (?egg-tooth) on the tip of the upper
mandible. They eat from the word go, and were always very fat. By the time
the older chick was 3 days old, it was half as large again as the smaller one.
The chicks were examined daily and this did not put the parents off feeding
or brooding. This was just as well, for no way was found to make the chicks
beg, thus hand-feeding would have been hopeless at an early age. When
disturbed, the chicks pressed down in the nest and remained motionless.

L. GIBSON - BREEDING THE BLUE-NAPED MOUSEBIRD
After the eyes had opened, they did the same and closed their eyes tightly.
The chicks at first rested head-to-tail in the nest, until the eyes opened fully
at about 6 days, then they both faced in the same direction as the sitting
parent. They stuck their heads out, one on either side or both on the same
side, and cheeped quietly for food. The chicks were fed by the sitting parent,
usually the hen, who received food by regurgitation from the male. It is
unlikely that the hen brought food this way to the cock.
As with the eggs, the chicks were never left uncovered for a moment, and
they were brooded until fledged. The exception to this was when one or
other chick voluntarily sat out for a while. In spite of the cool weather
(45 -- 55*, 7--13*C) a chick would occasionally become hot enough to
hyperventilate by sticking its head well out and rapidly oscillating its throat,
while gaping widely. The adults cooled off this way too.
Only when the chicks left the nest were they seen to be fed directly by the
visiting parent. It is likely that the chicks could have been fed directly for a
few days before leaving, as at 11 --12 days they voluntarily climbed from the
nest and sat on adjacent twigs, but returned at nightfall, along with the
mother. At 15 and 16 days they vacated the nest and moved into dense vines,
just under the roof, within the shelter. All the adults huddled around the
chicks at night, but only the parents fed them. The second chicks were
slightly smaller than the first in size, at the same age. They were a day older
before they climbed out of the nest, but still left it by the 15th and 16th day.
The rapidly shortening days and consequently shorter feeding time probably
caused this slight difference. There was by now only about ten hours of
daylight -- two and a half hours less than there was for the first clutch. The
weather changed dramatically for the second clutch, which hatched on the
10th and 11th of October. The month broke records for sunshine and
warmth, but consequently the clear nights were cold. The days were around
60*F (15*C) and the nights in the mid-thirties (2*C). There was frost on the
two nights before the chicks left the nest on October 26th and each night
thereafter. So three days after the second brood fledged, all the Colius were
taken indoors.

Feeding Chicks

The chicks were fed on only four items of food. The principle food was
scrambled egg, followed by banana. The bananas were spread with soft
margarine at least once a day, although this was probably superfluous in view
of the amount of egg consumed. Leaves were fed daily to the chicks as could
be seen by the green colour in the crop, through the thin, stretched skin, for
the crops were always bulging. These,were the only softbills I have raised
which had a crop. The bulging throat further likened them to baby parrots.
The leaves were either from the brassica or from the weigela, as these were
the only plants depredated. All four adults steadily chewed the leaves and
shoots from around the nest, so that by the time the second chicks left, the
nest could be more readily seen through the gaps. The fourth food item was

boiled, sweetened rice pudding, made with milk. Not a great deal was eaten,
and it was fourth in choice.
No meat or any other foodstuff was used. Interestingly no insects of any
kind were fed to the chicks, although a fair variety was offered, including
mealworms, pupae and beetles. The adults were never seen to search for
insects in the aviary, and they ignored the assortment of flies, spiders, bees,
aphids, etc. that passed through.
The ofurepeated statement in the literature about mousebirds making off
with fledglings would not apply to C. macrourus , and indeed they ignored a
dead, two-day old Zosterops chick. Although I cannot find the original
reference, if I remember rightly, it was a single observation on another
species, and possibly there was some explanation other than predation.
When the mousebirds nested, all the other birds were removed except
the hen Blackcap. Nectar-milk was then supplied to the Colius on a somewhat
sporadic basis. Although the adults continued to drink it, there was no way of
determining what role, if any, it played in the feeding of chicks. In retrospect,
this could have been checked easily by dyeing the nectar red, and checking the
chicks' crops or droppings.
When f ledged, the chicks looked like the adults, but with shorter tails. They
lacked the red colour on the legs and beak, but they did have little crests and
faint blue nape-patches. The crest was obvious at a week old, as was the

sprouting body 'fur', which grows out all over, and not in the usual tracts of
other birds. The khaki-green beak showed a little red colour at the base in the
seventh week, and by 3 months the beak (and the legs) were a pale pinkish
colour, which served as an instant differentiation from the red of the adults.
On leaving the nest, the chicks could climb well, but could flutter only
about a metre. Two days after, they could fly from bush to bush with an
upright, hovering flight and large spaces were crossed by landing on the roof
wire at 10ft (3m) intervals. The chicks were fed by the adults for at least 40
days, although I believe they could have fed themselves at about 18 days.
The fledgelings remained hidden for much of the day, high up in dense
vines, and were fed there. Even when they later accompanied the adults to
the feeding table, they begged and were fed. As all the birds left the premises
when the oldest chicks were 8 weeks old, I did not ascertain exactly when
parental feeding stopped entirely.
I have long given up the idea of "free-breeding aviary strains of birds, to the
Nth generation", which people are continually advocating as highly desirable.
It is highly impractical (except, perhaps, for zoos). One reason is that I would
not be able to accumulate information on more than two or three species,
when my aviaries would be full. The other (and not the least) reason is that I
usually have great trouble in disposing of exotic birds, and the thought of 16
or 20 mousebirds happily munching through a "six-hand bunch" has frightening
economic considerations. So they went to the zoo, where they joined nine
other birds from these premises. As a matter of fact they are now next door to
their old aviary companions, the rails. Many birds have come and gone from
my aviaries, some scarcely remembered, but the mousebirds will always be
remembered clearly, and I actually miss them.

BREEDING THE GREEN-CHEEKED CONURE

<bodyText confidence="0.9684795" page_id="56283613"  page_num="157" year="" vol="">
Pyrrhura molinae
By GEORGE A. SMITH (Peterborough)
The Green-cheeked Conure comes from Bolivia, Brazil and the Argentine:
see figure. Export of birds from the two latter countries is prohibited and
Bolivia is so politically and commercially isolated that, it seems, only one
person, Dr. Romero, deals in birds, largely confining himself to the Plum-
crowned Pionus Pionus tumultuosus and the Red-cheeked Macaw Ara rubrogenys.
Therefore, other than those that I have, the only Green-cheeked Conures
that I know of in Europe are those at Walsrode Zoo, in West Germany, and
with the Spenkelinks in the Netherlands.
In appearance the Green-cheeked Conure is not spectacular. It is very like
the better-known Red-bellied Conure Pyrrhura frontalis: differing because
the top of the tail is maroon-red, for its entire length, and there is a brown,
and not a green, cap to the head. They may be imagined as green, black-
billed parrakeets with a white skin surrounding the eyes, scalloped feathers
around the neck and upper chest and a patch of dull red to the abdomen.
They are squawky-noisy when alarmed; but this is bearable and might be
acceptable to any but the most unreasonable of neighbours.
By inserting the Pearly and the Crimson-bellied Conures P. perlata and P.
rhodogaster between the Red-bellied and the Green-cheeked Conures, Peters
(1937) must have considered that they were a most distinctive species.
Forshaw (1978) did not question Peters. It is, however, curious that Miss
Rosemary Low (1972), who is definitely on the side of the 'lumpers' when it
comes to American parrots, also treated them as separates. She has recently
told me that, now that she knows them better, they are so similar as to be the
same. The three 'species' (the Blaze-winged Conure P. devillei being the
third), in my opinion, are conspecific. It might also be explained that the
three museum skins of the 'Yellow-sided Conure P. hypoxantha\ are rather
obviously, 'diluted' examples of the Green-cheeked Conure: it is most likely
that the 'dilution' is a nutritional deficiency and not a genetic mutation.
I bought four adult Green-cheeked Conures from Mrs. Stephanie Belford
in late autumn 1978. Their wildness had caused them to break their tails
into stubs and badly fray their flight feathers as they frantically moved about
their cage. To settle them down they were put into a 2X1X2 metre-high
aviary well away from the house and disturbance. After a month, or so, the
damaged feathers were plucked to get the birds to look more presentable.
Somehow they were never moved from their secluded flight, so no observations
could be made on their behaviour. They are quite the wildest birds I have
kept and on the handful of occasions when I could glimpse them unobserved
-- through the garage window -- it seemed that they had formed two pairs.
Expecting them to lay any day I was not surprised to find an egg (measuring
25.2X23.4mm) on the 22nd March. By next morning it had gone. No more

appeared and it was, therefore, assumed that while this hen was laying the
second was, simultaneously, cleaning out the nest-box before she too laid.
This was confirmed for on the 6th April a larger egg was discovered
(measuring 26.6X 21.9mm). (The average weight of six, perfectly fresh, eggs
was 7 grams). This egg was taken in case it might be destroyed. A smaller,
rounder, egg the next day proved that there were two laying hens. This egg,
and the next three, was taken for artificial incubation, where at a temperature
of 100*F (38*C), four hatched after 22 days. Between them the hens
continued laying until they had another seven eggs. Left in the nest box they
took between twenty-two and twenty-four days to hatch. The two hens sat
amicably enough side-by-side to incubate and the males seemed equally
friendly towards each other. These seven eggs all hatched; but chicks
disappeared. On investigation it was found that they were being excessively
groomed and the damage to the ends of the wings and the feet caused
bleeding and once they weakened the chicks were mutilated even more.
When they died the parents promptly ate them. It was only the fresh-
hatched chicks that were killed and I took it that four parents, between them,
were too attentive for the good of the chicks.

At about this time I had two Hawk-headed Parrots Deroptyus accipitrinus
hatch in the incubator. One Hawkhead died, after four days, and the other
did not grow as it should. I might explain that, having previously hand-
reared a Hawkhead, a growth-curve was there for comparison. It was
decided that the best way of getting this chick started was to put it with* the
Green-cheeked Conures, for it has been my experience that it can be very
difficult for parrot chicks, when artificially reared, to put on weight after
hatching. Anyone can rear a week-old chick. Obviously it is my foster-food
that is to fault; but that is a subject for another article. To test the conures I
first gave them the three, so far successfully hand-reared conures. These
they accepted except that the day I put the Hawkead with them I found that
they now had but five chicks left: half the brood they might have had. The
Hawkhead sounded different from a Green-cheeked chick: it was loud and
penetrating whilst they had a little pipping squeak. The next day the
Hawkhead was fed and fluffy. (One extremely noticeable difference between
hand-reared and parent-reared parrot chicks is that the parents carefully
groom and clean them. So that, for example, the Green-cheeked chicks, fed
by myself, were thinly coated with a yellow sparseness of down that was
pressed close to the body. Within a few hours of being put with the parents
they, like their natural-hatched siblings, were completely enveloped with a
whispy down that gave them a furry-look). Two more Green-cheeks were to
be cannibalized and yet the Hawkhead flourished. After twenty-four days
the Hawkhead was removed for (successful) hand-rearing. At seven weeks
old the three Green-cheeked Conures left the nest. They differed from the
adults only in that they had less maroon-red to the abdomen and the red of
the tail appeared to be of a clearer and paler red. All seven live in perfect
harmony and the parents did not nest again.

By GERT SKIPPER (Herlev, Denmark)
During an expedition to the Belgian Congo in 1913, the American
zoologist J. P. Chapin purchased from a native of the Ituri Forest region, a
red wing feather of a bird which was totally unknown to him. He later tried
to identify it on his return to America but was unable to do so. It was not until
twenty-one years later when working on a book on the birds of the Congo
that he visited the famous Musee du Congo at Tervueren in Belgium. There
he found two dusty mounted birds, erroneously identified as young Blue
Peafowl, with red feathers bearing a striking resemblance to the one he had
obtained in the Congo. He could still not identify the bird and the mystery
remained until 1937, when, on an expedition to the Congo, Chapin managed
to obtain specimens and duly named the species Afropavo congensis.
The cock is a blackish bird with dull green back and areas of green and
violet metallic gloss. He also has a crest with a peculiar tuft of white bristles
preceding it. The hen differs in that she is basically reddish-brown with
green back; her crest is smaller and she lacks the white tuft of bristles.
Since its discovery the Congo Peafowl has been kept in captivity on only a
few occasions in Europe and America. Antwerp Zoo, the most successful
establishment with this species, obtained specimens some years ago and it is
their progeny that we have stationed here at the Copenhagen Zoo. The hen
of our original pair had been some time alone since the loss of the male. He
was replaced early in 1978 and, within a short period a clutch of four eggs was
laid. These all proved to be infertile but from another clutch of four, two
hatched late in April. However, these survived for no length of time, dying at
the ages of seven and twenty-eight days old, despite seeming to thrive in the
early stages of development.
After this failure, conditions and diet were altered. The first two attempts
were made in winter and spring and therefore the birds were in inside
accommodation measuring 3X4 metres. The ground covering was of sand
except for a small area of earth and dead leaves where the nest was made.
Access was now given to a connecting outside aviary of the same dimensions
as the inside quarters. The floor of the sheltered part was left as bare earth
apart from some dead leaves. The remainder consisted of a fine grassmat
with two huge bamboo plants as cover. Suitable perching was placed a metre
or so off the ground.
By late June, the first egg of the third clutch was laid in a simple scraped
nest situated on the ground near the back of the aviary. Three more eggs
were laid at 48 hour intervals. The eggs were uniform brown in colour and
only slightly larger than a fowl's egg. The male was removed as a precaution
as soon as incubation started, after which, the hen undertook her duties
perfectly only venturing off the eggs to feed. After twenty-eight days, two
hatched followed by a third the next day. The fourth egg was infertile.

Considerable care was taken this time regarding the feeding. As the birds
were kept outdoors on a natural ground, no extra live food was given, the hen
managing to pick or dig up sufficient from the leaves. A little chicken food
mixed with an insectile mixture, cheese and plenty of finely diced apple
was given twice a day. The whole mixture was sprinkled with a vitamin and
mineral powder. Enough food was given at each feed to ensure it was entirely
consumed before the next was given. After a few days a little minced meat
and sprouted seed were added.
Many observations were made on the feeding of the chicks. The female --
and later the male -- fed the chicks with guided feeding playing only a small
part at the beginning. This method gradually took over as the chicks grew
but they were still given certain items, usually live food, by the parents for
some time afterwards. All items of the diet were consumed but they were
especially fond of sprouted seed while much time was spent busily searching
for insects among the leaves which were always appreciated.
Additional live food was given when several weeks old and took the form of
grasshoppers, cockroaches, house flies and a few mealworms, but not more
than could be eaten in a few minutes. Various new food items were added
from time to time with small berries such as the mountain cranberry greatly
relished. Unlimited access to sprouted seed was given, something they liked
much.
A clearer picture now became evident as to what could have been wrong to
cause the demise of the last brood. Firstly, the diet was evidently too rich,
giving an excess of protein with too little calcium. The amount of chicken
food and insects were reduced during the initial stages of growth. Secondly,
it was thought that the sand covered floor created too dry an atmosphere.
Bathing was rarely witnessed indoors despite adequate facilities, but once
outside the birds eagerly bathed on the wet grass after rain. Thirdly, the male
was separated once incubation had commenced for fear he would do harm to
the eggs and chicks. This time he was put back when the chicks were about a
week old, and immediately he called and started to feed them. As a later
breeding attempt showed, he is better taken away during incubation as he
started to peck at the incubating female.
The chicks grew well and at two weeks old, were roosting with their
parents off the ground. One later died of coccidiosis but the remaining two
developed quickly and proved to be a pair; being clearly distinguishable as
such at six months.
The latest breeding attempt indoors is progressing satisfactorily -- three
chicks are, at the time of writing, six weeks old. The extremely bad summer
this year forced the birds inside, but fortunately the measures taken to prevent
a recurrence of the first failure indoors have proven successful.

COCK RED-CHEEKED CORDON-BLEU HATCHING

In the past twenty-one years during which I have always had specimens of
at least two, and often all three species of cordon-belus or blue waxbills,
Uraeginthus spp. I have on some occasions had males of the Red-cheeked
Cordon-bleu, U. bengalus , and both males and females of the Cordon-bleu or
Blue-breasted Waxbill, U. angolensis, form homosexual pairs. Male pairs of
the Red-cheeked Cordon-bleu sometimes take over nests with eggs from
heterosexual pairs. Most often in such cases neither male will incubate or
brood at night and, when this is so, young are seldom (though occasionally)
hatched and never survive. On a very few occasions a male has sat regularly
at night and young been hatched and reared. Usually such homosexuallv
paired birds have to satisfy their thwarted parental drives by adopting one or
more young of a heterosexual pair after they have fledged, sometimes taking
over the whole brood and feeding it so well that its own parents bother no
further but cease feeding their fledglings. This happens if (and only if) they
are in any case going to nest again.
I recently had a cock Red-cheeked Cordon-bleu take over the entire care
of a young Blue-headed Cordon-bleu, U. cyanocephala , from at least the day
on which it was hatched and probably from two or three days before
hatching. The case seems worth recording in our magazine even though it
may be typical of what would occur if a cock of this species were bereaved at
the time this one was.
This year I had left in my bird room only a few pairs of Blue-headed
Cordon-bleus, two pairs of Golden-breasts, Amandava subflava, and two homo-
sexually paired male Red-cheeked Cordon-bleus. One of these latter had had
for over a year some semi-crippling, possibly arthritic, complaint. For about
six months he had been unable to fly but in the late spring of this year
regained his powers of flight to some extent. He and his mate took over a nest
containing one Blue-headed's egg. After they had been sitting about a week,
to my surprise, another egg was laid in it, necessarily by one or other of the
hen Blue-headed Cordon-bleus. I imagined that, as usual, neither cock was
sitting at night, so took little heed of their nesting behaviour. However, about
ten days after the second egg appeared in their nest, the arthritic(?) cock
suddenly became worse, no longer took turns on the nest and within two
days had died. Two days later I noticed that the other cock was still sitting,
and on feeling and then looking into the nest, found to my surprise, a nestling
that could not have been more than two days old (I could not see it very
clearly) and that I think was then less than a day old.
I did not much fancy its chances of survival but in this I was, happily,
proved wrong, as it was successfully reared by its foster father and is now
independent. I am not sure of its sex* as it is one of those ambiguously
plumaged young Blue-headed Cordon-bleus, neither so bright around the

head as to enable one to be sure it is a cock or with so little blue as to enable
one to be sure it is a hen. I hope on humanitarian grounds that it will be the
latter as it is almost sure to be firmly imprinted on its foster father's species
and as he has not now got a mate, two problems will thus be solved at once it
is proves a hen. It regularly clumps beside its foster father when resting
though this may merely be because it has no siblings -- normally young
Uraeginthus clump with siblings of the same brood -- and he now has no
mate.

By A. W. E. FLETCHER, (Warrington, Cheshire)
It is well known that in certain species of teal the plumage is the same in
both sexes and no eclipse takes place. A less known, but more interesting
aspect of such species is that the drake helps the duck to rear the offspring in
the same way that a gander helps a goose. In species where an eclipse
plumage occurs, the drake is entirely indifferent to the ducklings and may
indeed be hostile.
An interesting example of this has occurred over the past four years in my
waterfowl collection.
A widowed Cape Teal Anas capensis drake paired up with an odd Chestnut-
breasted Teal Anas castanea duck before I could obtain a mate of his own
species for him, and during the last four years they have hatched six clutches.
In no case have they reared less than three of the seven or eight ducklings
hatched in a collection which includes ten or eleven pairs of geese and many
other smaller waterfowl. They also receive attention from Crows, Magpies,
Jackdaws and Grey Squirrels.
Although the geese can cope fairly satisfactorily with such vermin, none of
the smaller waterfowl, on the occasions when they have been allowed to
hatch their eggs, have succeeded in keeping their ducklings alive for more
than two or three days.
The Cape Teal drake's behaviour is extraordinary and like all his kind he is
bad tempered at all times, but once the ducklings are hatched he becomes a
bulldog. No goose is too big to be attacked and he has been seen giving chase
to the little Muntjac deer which share the enclosure.
On one occasion a duckling got stuck in a loose roll of wire netting lying on
the ground and when I went to rescue it, both duck and drake attacked me
fearlessly.
The procedure after the ducklings hatch is always the same. One of the
smaller ponds (12ft X 8ft) in the enclosure is almost choked with water iris
and the ducklings are always taken to this spot for the first week after they
hatch. The only help they get is that suitable food is placed at the edge of the
pond twice a day. The drake makes certain that no other waterfowl approach
it.
After a week or ten days, they can be found on any of the several other
ponds and at three weeks old the ducklings are sturdy enough to be brought
by the parents to the area where the whole collection is fed. The drake
remains extremely aggressive until the ducklings can fly.
None of these hybrids have been pinioned and no doubt some have been
shot by Mersey wildfowlers. The odd one or two return from time to time
and one is thought to have been seen at the Wildfowl Trust's Martin Mere.
My conclusion is that species without an eclipse plumage have a very
distinct advantage over those where the female alone is involved in rearing.

By BRUCE W. Miller (Supervisor of Birds)
The 1978 bird breeding season was one of the most successful in recent
years. In November 1977, S. David McKelvey arrived to serve as staff
aviculturist, and the bird department began new growth period. I became
supervisor of birds in September of 1978.
During the early part of this year, the Hixon Bird House has been
renovated, and units have been set up as miniature habitats with appropriate
plantings and murals to simulate an African waterhole, the Australian
outback, an African village, a Texas coast line and a riverbank in Africa.
Many of the birds expressed appreciation for their new homes by nesting for
the first time since arrival at our zoo years ago.
A large outdoor African walk-through flight cage was completed and
stocked this year, and a number of birds successfully nested there also. Plans
are being completed for off-exhibit holding and breeding areas which will
simplify management of this large collection. The number of species has
been reduced from more than 450 to about 350 in order to improve breeding
programmes. The total collection remains at 1500+, and this year it received
a "Master Breeder" award for a mixed collection from American Pheasant
and Waterfowl Association.

White-crowned Pigeons are a species rarely kept in zoos or by private
owners.
Therefore, the Berlin Zoo was fortunate in being able to obtain two pairs
of this species from Cuba on an exchange basis. These pigeons originate
from the Caribean Islands, east Mexico and southern Florida.
Already during quarantine the birds proved to be rather aggressive and
had to be separated. Only after changing partners several times was a
breeding couple established, while the two other birds would not become
accustomed to one another.
The pair was housed in an indoor aviary of 4m by 3m, shared with a pair of
Crested Screamers Chauna torquata: an outdoor aviary of the same size was
also available. The free use of the outdoor cage is given during the summer
months, while during the winter the birds are only let outdoors in mild
weather. They are fed the ordinary pigeon diet.
To offer the pair a chance to breed, a nest support made of wire was
supplied on which the birds built their nest in spring 1979, using straw for
building material. That year they bred twice, one egg each time. Interestingly
enough, already by the end of the first month after hatching, the sex of the
young was clearly indentifiable. The first chick hatched showed a dirty grey
colouring on its forehead which is characteristic for the female, while the
second one was clearly identifiable as a male by its characteristic white
forehead.

An interesting report has been received from the Norfolk Wildlife Park
concerning a solitary Grey Heron Ardea c. cinerea which has lived for some
years amongst the willows on an island in the Park, having been originally
brought in by the RSPCA with a broken wing which had to be amputated.
Having proved to be very aggressive towards any potential mates, it has lived
on its own until this year. During April it was seen to build a large nest of
twigs and branches on the ground on the island and then to be incubating
four eggs. These were first assumed to be infertile but by 29 May four chicks
had been hatched and at about this time the Park's staff noticed a wild heron
associating with the pinioned bird. It was assumed that the wild one was a
female since, judging by its size, the resident bird was a male. The wild female
was often seen leaving the nest on the island when the staff began work in
the park early in the morning.
Daily observations were then made and it appeared that the wild, presumably
female, heron incubated during the night whilst the pinioned, apparently
male, bird took over during the daytime. Both parents fed the chicks, all of
which survived to independence and can now be seen in the willow trees on
the island.

Derek Goodwin writes from London: "German aviculturists have brought
the care and breeding of Gouldian Finches to a fine but very demanding and
expensive art. Among the many other foods needed, according to the experts,
is a mixture of egg yolk and ground millet that must be dried in the sun . The
hens laying the eggs from which the yolks are taken for this purpose must be
on free range, have been tested by a vet. and found free from all
diseases and, most important, must never be allowed to eat any food that has
been grown on soil that has been treated with phosphates or other artificial
manures. Besides this, they must have unripe spray millet, soaked seed,
"wood earth," mineral mixtures, an assortment of live food plus extra vitamins.
So I somehow don't think that the Gouldian Finch is ever likely to become a
widely-kept domesticated species. I'm glad that I personally think the more
easily-kept cordon-bleus are more beautiful."

By Dr. JEAN Delacour, President of the Avicultural Society
It is about a hundred and fifty years ago that pheasants of many species
began being imported, reared and established in Europe. In those days,
parks, extensive shooting preserves and game farms were numerous. Their
owners were trying to introduce new game birds and most of them maintained
pheasantries to exhibit the most beautiful species, which constituted fine
additions to their gardens. Zoological societies, particularly in Paris, London
and Antwerp, were organized and they built their zoos; one of their main
activities was to import, acclimatise and propagate suitable mammals and
birds which could be distributed later to their members. There were also a
number of bird amateurs, who kept important collections of pheasants, as
well as many lesser breeders, most of them enthusiastic and very competent.
To mention only the most famous -- Baron Comely near Tours (Beaujardin),
Baron Alphonse de Rothschild at Ferrieres, M. Delaurier at Angouleme,
had splendid collections in France and reared a number of species for the
first time in captivity. Fortunately their successes have been recorded in the
Bulletin de la Societe d'Acclimatation.
When I started collecting pheasants in 1905, many species were still
extensively bred.Fine pheasantries were not rare and I shall cite a few; those
of Mm C. Debreuil and J. Hermenier in France, A. Ghigi in Italy, W. H. St
Quentin and H. D. Astley in England. Other breeders were numerous, and
there was a number of commercial game farms. In fact it was then easy to
acquire, each summer, specimens of all the species kept in captivity.
There were no blood pheasants available but tragopans were commonly
reared; Satyrs remained fairly rare but Temminck's and Cabot's were avail-
large numbers . Himalayan Monals were widespread, as were Brown Eared
Pheasants; the Blue had not yet come (I imported it for the first time in 1929).
Argus were fairly rare, but Grey Peacock Pheasants common and there were
a few Malay and Germain's. Silvers, Kalijs, Swinhoe's were abundant in diff-
erent forms. Also Elliot's and Reeves's; Coppers were rather scarce and Mikado
came later. There were no Bar-tailed; Cheers were uncommon but available.
I collected and brought over Edwards's, Imperials and Crested Argus in
1924. Firebacks were not too numerous, except for the Siamese, and Bulwer's
and Salvadori's arrived for the first time in the late thirties, as well as the
Palawan, the Bronze-tailed Peacock Pheasants and Blyth's Tragopan.

Pheasant keeping started developing in America at the same time. Until
then, only the New York (Bronx) Zoo and a very few others, and privately,
Colonel A. Kuser in New Jersey had good collections. But excellent breeders
soon appeared, in particular Messrs. C. Sibley, F. Yessler, C. Denley, Dr. D.
S. Newill, W. J. Mackensen, W. Leland Smith.
At the same time in Europe, very important collections had replaced the
previous ones and those of Cleres and of Mme Lecallier in France, Spedan
Lewis in England, M and Mme Malisoux in Belgium, A. Ghigi and others in
Italy, Holland and Germany.
It all resulted in the organizations of the Ornamental Pheasant Society in
Europe, and of the American Pheasant Society. Their publications were
excellent and they worked well together.
Pheasant studies and collections had reached a peak in 1939, but the war
destroyed the European stocks to a great extent. A few rare species, particularly
Blyth's Tragopans and Crested Argus disappeared and have so far never
been replaced.
There still were, however, a number of birds left in America and even in
England. Soon after 1946 others came from their native countries and
pheasant collections prospered again. They have now reached a very high
standard and I feel happy to witness the accomplishments of many friends,
particularly in America. Changes in physical and social conditions have
necessitated new techniques and ways to rear birds, and they prove to be
adequate.
The propagation of game birds is the more important at present since most
species are threatened with extinction in their native lands by the destruction
of the forests, their indispensable habitat, not to speak of the increasing
interference of man.

Since some sixteen of the forty-eight species of pheasant are officially
listed as endangered, any aviculturist who decides to keep and breed these
very beautiful birds can make a worthwhile and important contribution to
conservation.
Obviously the various species all need different techniques for successful
breeding and it would be impossible to detail these in a short article but there
are several basic guidelines which apply to most of the species and I have
tried below to list these to anyone who has not yet kept pheasants.
One must start by considering the species one would like to keep for this
will determine the type and size of aviary necessary. Undoubtedly, the
easiest to obtain and to keep is the Golden Pheasant Chrysolophus
pictus which everyone knows. They have the advantage of being very hardy
and also inexpensive. The major drawback is that they take two years to
mature and attain full plumage. However, they can be a problem if one
breeds a number of them only to find that you cannot give them away as they
are so plentiful. One could, instead, try one of the long-tailed pheasants, the
Reeves' Syrmaticus reevesi for example which is only slightly more expensive
than the Golden, or even the Elliot's Pheasant Syrmaticus ellioti or Hume's
Bar-tailed S. humiae. These latter two are not so easy, being very aggressive
towards their hens in early spring but one can cope with this, the Elliot's
and the Hume's are both listed as endangered species but can readily be
acquired in this country.
Having made up one's mind on the species, then one can plan one's aviary.
For a pair of Golden the minimum floor area would be 100 square feet; for
the larger pheasants about double that size. Within reason the larger the
aviary, the better it is for the birds but with materials costing so much
obviously one must provide adequate rather than luxurious accommodation.
The choice of materials must lie with the individual, but a treated timber
framework with wire mesh Qfo&amp;quot; or 1&amp;quot; mesh to keep out vermin) is the most
common. The aviaries should be 6ft. tall to allow ease of access for the
keeper. Although most of the pheasants that a beginner is likely to have are
very hardy, they must all have some form of shelter both from the rain and
also from draughts. Nearly all pheasants like to roost off the ground so a
perch under some form of roofing must be provided. The roof of the main
aviary can be either soft synthetic netting or wire mesh but must be capable
of withstanding any likely snowfalls. The birds will appreciate some form of
boarding round the base of the aviary to exclude draughts and it also has the
benefit of preventing them from trying to attack their neighbours if two or
more aviaries are built side by side. One should also sink the wire netting into
the ground about one foot to deter foxes and the next-door neighbour's
Alsatian from digging in and killing one's birds.

N. L. S. WKALLEY - PHEASANT AVICULTURE
With most species of pheasant, a pair should live happily together but on
no account should one ever out two or more adult cock birds together or the
murder of one will soon follow. With the more aggressive species such as the
Hume's or Elliot's provision should be made to keep separate, but within
view, the cock and the hen for all but the spring breeding season. This can be
done quite simply by dividing one's aviary with wire netting without forgetting
a small connecting door. In this way the unfortunate harassment of the hens
can be avoided. If the aviary is sufficiently large, one can put several hens to
each cock bird with excellent results.
All breeders have their own ideas on the flooring for the aviary. The
cheapest is to leave this as grass. This has the advantage in that as long as the
area is well-drained and not too small, of looking natural and of course all the
pheasants love to eat the grass and scratch and dust-bath in the soil
However, some species, for example the monals, will peck out all the grass
within a very short period, but more seriously in a permanent aviary one can
do little to contain the build up of disease and parasites. Many breeders now
use sharp sand or gravel, both of which are easier to keep clean and well-
drained. Although this adds to the initial cost of the aviaries, if one is thinking
of keeping some of the more expensive species, it is essential as valuable and
rare birds can be lost unnecessarily.
Some planting of bushes to provide both shelter and to add to the aesthetic
value of the aviaries should be done. Again, this will be a personal choice. I
personally have rhododendrons and juniper but these are slow growing
although they are resistant to the attentions of the pheasants. There are
numerous shrubs and grasses which are suitable. A selection of evergreen
and deciduous makes the most attractive.
Perhaps the next point to consider is feeding which in modern times is
very simple for all but a few species.
There are numerous proprietary brands of made-up foods available for
the various stages. These can either be pheasant or turkey pellets, since the
content is much the same. The types of pellet or crumb are entirely self-
explanatory. Breeder pellets for the adult birds before and during the
breeding period, chick crumbs for the first three --four weeks after the
chicks hatch, a grower pellet for the next two months and a maintenance
pellet for all other times with some mixed corn added. Too much wheat,
which many use for economy, leads to fat unhealthy birds and problems at
laying time.
The amount one feeds to the birds is really quite simple. One can either
always have hoppers with an ad-lib supply of food but this, of course, attracts
rats and therefore disease, or one can feed them by hand. The birds will soon
tell you if you are not giving enough by rushing towards you whenever you
appear or be leaving stale food on the ground if overfed. Hand-feeding does
tend to help tame down the birds and this is obviously desirable from all
standpoints. A small quantity of titbits such as sultanas and chopped pieces
of apple will also be appreciated. Most pheasants need plenty of green food

such as lettuce leaves, particularly if there is no grass in the pens. Fresh water
is another obvious must as is grit available at all times. This is, by necessity, a
very simplified guide to the feeding requirements and several of the rarer
species will need special treatment, but it does show how what was once a
chore, whan all feed had to be home-made, is now so simple as to make it a
pleasure and allow one to enjoy one's birds all the more.
Disease is another wide-ranging subject since there are unfortunately so
many ailments that the pheasant family can catch. One must take precautions
to keep out rats and sparrows and always maintain a high standard of hygiene
particularly with the young stock. Treatment against worms particularly the
gapeworm should be done regularly two or three times a year with one of the
proprietary drugs available. Other than this, one should simply keep an eye
on one's stocks and notice any signs of ill-health as soon as possible. There
are several good books on the diseases and their symptoms which should be
in every keeper's library. Diagnosis before death is difficult except in a few of
the commoner ailments but one most always send dead birds for a post-
mortem in order to contain any outbreak.
If the keeper seriously wishes to breed the pheasants he has, provision for
the hatching and rearing of the chicks must be made in good time before the
birds start to lay in March/April. There are a number of small incubators
available, the best probably being the Marsh Roll-X which is automatic and
very simple to use. This, however, is a large expense for the breeder who has
only a few birds. Perhaps an easier alternative is to keep a small flock of
bantams or to attempt to find broody hens at the right time. As much care
should be taken with the health of these as with the pheasants. The advantage
of a bantam foster-mother is that she will not only hatch the eggs but take
care of the chicks afterwards with the simple provision of a coop and small
run. However, if one hatches in an incubator some form of heater probably
an infra-red dull-emitter which are easily purchased. Some chicks can be a
problem to start feeding but with some hard-boiled egg or ants' eggs in
addition to the chick crumbs, most will respond.
With artificial heat, one must slowly wean the chicks from about a 90*F
heat for the first week to no heat at all by five --six weeks of age, a process
which they will achieve naturally with a foster-mother.
These, then, are the major factors governing basic pheasant aviculture
and on re-reading this article, I can think of many queries that will occur to
the would-be breeder. There are, however, many books on the subject, some
very much up-to-date with the latest developments and these should be
consulted. There is, however, no substitute for practical experience and
learning by one's own mistakes the best guide. Everyone will develop their
own techniques and have their own ideas but this, after all, is the pleasure of
any undertaking.

By K. C. R. HOWMAN (Shepperton, Middx. England)
The last decade has seen great advances in avicultural techniques, particularly
amongst aviculturists concerned with waterfowl and pheasants, where the
benefits from research in the poultry industry on game farms and by
organisations, like the Wildfowl Trust, are most applicable.
My own techniques are now almost unrecognisable from those I used
when first starting twelve years ago. Many of the mistakes made then have
been eliminated by redesign of the equipment used at the different stages. So
much so that it is hard to remember all the unnecessary mistakes one made as
a beginner. In this article I will try to recall some of those errors and how
they are now avoided by describing the techniques used when starting, and
how they have been developed.
There is not the space to discuss other than briefly aviary design and its
effect on the health and propogation of pheasants. However, we all have to
build aviaries for our first pheasants and this can be where we make the first
mistakes that can affect the breeding potential of the birds they house.
Following on from the inevitable Golden Pheasant, my first birds were
from the group of long tailed pheasants Syrmaticus and were Reeves's
Elliot's and Hume's. Grass formed the base to the pens and the size of those
first aviaries was 7&apos; wide by 24&apos; long. The first lesson was soon learned when,
within months of introducing the birds, the pens were bare earth. So one
quickly learned that few pheasant species will retain a grassy base to their
pen if it is under 200 square feet, and this needs to be at least doubled for the
more vegetarian species.
Where pens cannot be increased in size, a base of sand or pea gravel may
well make a more practical base, and certainly has the advantage of looking
neat and being hygenic. Only recently have we found that a weld mesh floor
2&amp;quot; above the earth both protects the grass roots and reduces disease problems.
As with humans however, green food or roughage does help the diet, and if
a sand or gravel base is used the introduction of bunches of weeds, or lettuce,
is advisable. My own amateur rather than scientific observations would
indicate that grass or other green food plays an important part in the
production of fertile eggs.
In spite of aviary shortcomings, we did get fertile eggs in our early years.
No proper plans had been made in advance, so the hunt for broody hens
began and we soon realised that mistakes 2 and 3 had been made and that in
this modern age of hybrid chickens our own flock of bantams was essential --
more important still was proper planning before the start of the breeding
season.
Coops and runs were hurriedly acquired from a game keeper who had
used them for rearing game pheasants and with them sets of nesting boxes.
As with most aviculturists, it is a spare time hobby and one quickly found
that the old fashioned method of pegging out broody hens was time consuming

Nest box with run attached
and led to many potential broodies never settling down. The nest boxes were
therefore given a sliding hatch and small wire runs, 2&apos;6&amp;quot; X 12&amp;quot; were
attached. Eleven years later we still use this system which is simple and
effective.
At that time the only small electric incubator available was the Curfew
still-air incubator. A reliable machine but one from which hatches seldom
exceeded 50% with ornamental pheasant eggs from start to finish. However,
we quickly learned that as a hatcher it was excellent and that double time
could be extracted from most broody hens by taking eggs away from the hens
and putting them into the Curfew for hatching and at the same time setting a
new clutch under the broody.

Small still-air incubator. A moving air version of this is now available.
This however produced its own problems in that instead of a broody hen
to rear the chicks, brooder lamps were necessary.
It is in the brooding of chicks that we have made most changes. In year one
it was entirely with broody hens out on grass in coops and runs. Losses
occurred for many reasons. We had escapes from under the runs, chicks
flying out when being fed, broody hens attacking the chicks, or losing
interest and letting them be chilled. Thunderstorms took their toll as did
disease and all in all we felt a more efficient method was necessary.
Escapes and ravages of the weather were easily catered for by a number of
small runs inside a shed. Disease also seemed to be less serious but was not
eliminated. As the runs were fixed and not being moved onto fresh ground
constant cleaning was necessary and the time factor alone necessitated a
change.
Black heat infra red lamps were the choice of brooder and these were hung
within oil tempered hardboard surrounds with peat as the floor. Highly
successful for the first two to three weeks -- then problems of chicks flying
out. We made up weldmesh tops to the surrounds, but from three weeks
onwards every time we fed and watered, chicks would be flying in all
directions.
The solution was to do what should have been done in the first place, and
construct small pens 2&apos; X 3&apos; fitted out with a black heat infra red lamp and
250 watt bulb. In addition to a door of the full width of the pen, small 9&amp;quot; X

9&amp;quot; doors were also made for feeding without risk of escapes. The pens were
constructed in rows on either side of the shed and in two tiers, one above the
other to save space. Thus thirty units were contained within a shed only 30&apos;
X 10&apos; with a central corridor.
In the early days after trials with different bases, peat was found to be the
best and produced no problems other than dust. Provided the pens were
sprayed each day with a fine mist sprayer this problem was controlled and
indeed the feathering of the chicks also benefitted. However, with thirty
pens of chicks cleaning became very time consuming and a further improvement
was made in substituting fine gauge mesh floors.
Weldmesh floors are boring for the chicks and two things have been found
to help this. One is the introduction of perches into every pen. Even at two
days old many chicks will start to use them. The other is to hang up every day
bunches of weeds for the chicks to peck at. This keeps them occupied and
reduces feather pecking. Feather pecking once started used to be hard to stop
even with constant debeaking. However, plastic bits developed for the
poultry and game farming industries have come to our aid and if used
sensibly almost totally eliminate the problem.
Incubators have advanced enormously and small, comparatively inexpensive
units are now available with automatic turning and of moving air type.
However, whilst undoubtedly they are great timesavers, I still prefer, when
possible, to use a broody hen as the incubator. In one respect only therefore
we are still using the same fundamental rearing technique with which we
started.

By DR. A. F. Anderson Brown (Lowestoft, Suffolk)
Aviculture is undergoing a revolution. Each year there are fewer wild-
caught birds available, due not only to their vanishing habitat, but also to the
quarantine regulations designed to protect the poultry industry from acci-
dentally imported disease.
Successful breeding of captive birds has become imperative, and made
possible by the tremendous advances in nutrition, genetics, and incubation
in the poultry industry. The wealth of knowledge and experience of this
industry is percolating into aviculture.
Incubation, for so long an art, is now an exact science, thanks to the
chicken.
When first laid, an egg may be regarded as a genetic plan for a new bird, with
sufficient tools and building materials to make it. Should the plan be
defective, or the tools inadequate, it will not produce a new bird. Nothing
can be done to improve the egg once it has been laid, but it can be ruined by
T^ad management afterwards.
Pre-incubation care of the egg
An egg begins to deteriorate from the moment that it is laid. The rate of
this deterioration depends on the physical conditions under which it is
stored, the ideal being a temperature of 55 degrees Farenheit, and a relative
humidity of seventy per cent. Under these conditions, and if stored for less
than a week, turning the eggs does not produce an increase in hatchability. If,
however, conditions are not ideal, or if the egg is to be stored for longer than a
week, then turning does produce a significant increase in hatchability.
On the assumption that storage conditions are never ideal, it is prudent to
turn the eggs daily, and never store for longer than a week.
Hygiene and disease
With the exception of virus diseases, such as Newcastle, and Salmonella
infections, which are transmitted inside the egg, all other harmful bacteria
gain entry to the egg through the pores in the shell after it has been laid.
Many more bacteria will enter the egg if it is wet and dirty, than will if it is
clean and dry. Sterilising the egg before storage will only kill those bacteria
on the shell, but does not harm those that have already entered.
Eggs should be picked up as soon as possible after laying, and clean ones
put straight into the store. Dirty eggs should be cleaned with sandpaper, and
then sterilised with detergent hypochlorite solution, at the manufacturer's
recommended strength and temperature. Fumigating with formaldehyde
vapour, at the concentration recommended for chicken eggs, does seem to
produce a slight drop in hatchability. Washing with a damp cloth merely
spreads any potential infection to every egg handled, and ensures the speedy
passage of the bacteria into the egg.

The incubator room
The incubator room should be kept at a steady even temperature of about
seventy degrees Farenheit. Marked fluctuations of day and night temperature
are mirrored inside the incubator, as no one make has a perfect design of heat
distribution. The humidity within the room should be kept as constant as
possible and it should be well-ventilated. Direct sunlight should not be
allowed to fall on the machine, or it will cause overheating. The room must
be kept scrupulously clean, and all incubator debris, dead eggs etc. removed
immediately. Infection from one egg can rapidly spread to the others.

Development of the embryo within the egg will proceed very slowly at
temperatures above seventy-two degrees Farenheit, and the embryo will die if
maintained for any length of time at a temperature above one hundred and
five degrees. Successful incubation only occurs if the embryo is maintained
within very narrow limits at a temperature of 99.5 deg F. Short periods of
cooling down to 72 deg F are not harmful, but overheating is very detri-
mental.
In the initial stages of incubation, the embryo does not produce any heat,
but towards hatching time, the living chick within the egg is producing
animal heat, and maintains its own body temperature several degrees hotter
than the air in the incubator.

<bodyText confidence="0.999383058823529" page_id="56283646"  page_num="182" year="" vol="">
The liquid contents of the egg evaporate through the shell pores. The
developing chick utilises the foodstores in the egg, effectively burning them
to produce carbon dioxide and water. This water must too evaporate. The
humidity within the incubator determines the rate of water evaporation, and
to successfully hatch, an egg must lose about twelve per cent of its initial
weight by hatching time. If there is too much loss of water, the chick cannot
mobilise the calcium of the shell for bone growth, and if there is too little, it
cannot concentrate its waste products in the egg membranes. A common
cause of poor hatches is too much water in the early stages. Humidity levels
can be monitored either by observing the air cell size, or by weighing the eggs
at periodic intervals.
At hatching time, when the chick is breaking out of the shell, the damp
membranes are exposed, and rapidly toughen if they dry. This tough
membrane prevents the chick from escaping, and it dies of exhaustion.
Toughening of the membranes can be minimised by giving the eggs a dry
shell period just before they chip, and then raising the humidity to the
maximum possible for hatching. Still air is less drying then moving air.

The optimum concentration of carbon dioxide in the incubator is about
0.03%. It is virtually impossible to give too much ventilation, but a stuffy

Pheasant eggs need more turning than chicken eggs. Twice daily is not
really sufficient, and it is best done hourly automatically. Insufficient turning
in the early stages is a very common cause of dead in shell, but in the last
three days prior to hatching, turning is not necessary.
The Incubator
There are many makes and sizes of incubator available. If the potential
value of the eggs is considered, it is false economy to buy an incubator merely
because it is cheap. The smaller incubators are often manufactured to a
price, temperature control and humidity levels being somewhat elastic, and
needing constant adjustment and supervision.

In this type of machine air movement is by convection, so that the top of
the egg chamber is hot, and the bottom cooler. There is only one plane across
the box at the correct incubation temperature. The eggs must be in this
plane. The manufacturers instructions must be followed to the letter, but in
general, the thermometer is placed two inches above the floor of the egg tray,
and the controls set to give a temperature of 103F above the eggs. The upper
surface of the egg should then be about 102F, the centre 99.5F, and the floor
of the machine about 90F.

the manufacturer's instructions must be followed to the letter, as the
temperature in the egg trays may be slightly different from where the
thermometer is sited, and the optimum temperature does vary with the air
speed within the incubator. Turning can be automatic, or mechanical, as can
humidity control.
Hatching
The physical conditions for hatching are totally different to the preceding
setting period. The chicks are producing more heat, and need more ventilation.
Where large numbers of eggs are hatching in one machine, it is usual to lower
the temperature half a degree, and open the vents fully to give a relatively dry
period. As soon as a significant number of the eggs have chipped, the
ventilators are partially closed, and extra humidity added. From now until
the hatch is complete, the door of the incubator must not be opened, or this
precious moisture will be lost. Once the hatch is complete, the ventilators are
opened to allow the chicks to dry off.

Where more than one or two clutches of eggs per season are being
incubated, it is preferable to have two machines, one for setting, and one for
hatching. The eggs are set at weekly intervals, and transferred to the hatcher
either on the twenty second day, or when the first of the clutch starts to chip.
After each hatch, the hatcher should be thoroughly cleaned and disinfected,
as should the setter at every available opportunity. At the beginning and end
of every season, every incubator should be thoroughly fumigated.

EXOTIC PHEASANTS AT LIBERTY
By IAIN GRAHAME (Lamarsh, Suffolk)
Introduction
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.987997128205128" page_id="56283654"  page_num="190" year="" vol="">
During the latter part of the last century and early this century, when
many of the large houses in Europe boasted fine collections of exotic birds
and animals (and countless staff to administer to their needs), it was still
possible to do things on a grand scale. Aviaries were often of intricate design,
or so immense as to create almost feral conditions for the occupants. There
are descriptions of 'good results' being obtained in England from pinioned
Tragopans 'kept in five-acre paddocks' and, at Cleres, 'where hundreds of
Tragopans were raised between 1920 and 1940', these were housed in
aviaries covering 2,500 sq. ft. (Delacour, 1951). Koklass imported to Europe
in the 1880's thrived so well that they were regarded as a potential 'new game
bird in France' (ibid.). Reeves's and Soemmering's Copper Pheasants were
recommended as 'adapted for the covert' (Tegetmeier, 1873).
Modern trends in aviculture are altogether different. Improved methods
of husbandry, economic considerations and lack of space have all led to very
much smaller aviaries. In Holland, for example, excellent breeding results of
Tragopans are regularly obtained in aviaries measuring no more than 50 sq.
ft.
Despite the obvious advantages of keeping exotic pheasants under such
cramped conditions, the aesthetic appeal is inevitably limited and the birds'
movements severely restricted. Pheasants look their best against a natural
background of mountain, marsh or woodland -- a far cry indeed from plastic
water bowls and artificial perches!
For aviculturists with sufficient space at their disposal, enormous pleasure
can be derived from keeping certain pheasant species at liberty. This short
paper enumerates some of the factors that should be taken into consideration
when embarking on such a venture.
Protection
Exotic pheasants should be pinioned prior to release and the release area
selected should be surrounded by a protective, escape-proof fence. Both these
factors are important, not only to provide protection for the birds, but to
minimise the danger of introducing exotic species into an alien environment.
Since a fence that serves both these purposes will be extremely costly it
will restrict those that can keep exotic pheasants under such conditions to
zoological parks, wildlife parks and suchlike. For others, it is perhaps
fortunate that such ideal species for liberty as the Golden and Lady Amherst's
Pheasants are (following numerous escapes!) now classified as British species,
although both originate from China. Unpinioned stocks of these can readily
be established in a suitable woodland area after a transitional period in a
makeshift pre-release pen. Old fruit cages or Whitlock pens can both be used

for this purpose. In order to avoid hybridization, however, only one of these
two species should be put at liberty in a given area. One word of warning
must be added regarding Goldens and Amherst's, namely that both are
aggressive to game pheasants and, consequently, no gamekeeper can be
blamed for killing them.
In order to ensure that the true exotics do not escape over a nine-foot high,
fox-proof fence, all branches close to or hanging over this fence from the
inside must be cut down. Pinioned pheasants can readily jump onto any
object six foot from the ground and, if suitable tree formations exist they will
hop to roost to a height of fifty feet or more -- one of the most enjoyable
sights of liberty pheasants!
Selection of Pheasants
Exotic pheasants that are aggressive (e.g. Reeves's), or delicate (e.g. tropical
species such as Firebacks and Peacock-Pheasants) are not suitable for release
in cold climates. Nor, as mentioned above, are combinations of species that
will readily hybridize with each other -- e.g. Golden/Amherst, Brown/Blue
Eared, Silver/Kalij.

The Satyr Tragopan will thrive at liberty.
Another limiting factor in selecting suitable pheasants for liberty is that
the males of all pheasants are, in varying degrees, aggressive toward males of
their own and other pheasant species. One exception, the commonest of all
pheasants kept at liberty, is the Indian Blue Peafowl, together with its captive
mutations, the White and the Black-shouldered. All pheasants suitable for
liberty are polygamous, so up to six hens can be kept with one cock.
It is my experience that among the most suitable species for release into a
protected environment are Lady Amherst's, Blue Eared, Mikado and Koklass.
The latter, being predominantly vegetarian, will thrive in grassy areas
containing plentiful trees and shrubs. The Koklass, incidentally, also seems
to be one of the least pugnacious of all.

Pheasants kept at liberty not only look far healthier than those in aviaries,
but feather damage is rare and incidence of disease very infrequent.
Great care, however, must be taken in pinioning these birds, and for this
operation an intramuscular TT injection (3 cc.), as well as the application of
suitable antibiotics and a fly-deterrent ointment to the wound is important.
Gapeworms are particularly prevalent in the autumn, but as the symptoms
are quickly recognizable, infected birds can easily be caught up as required,
confined to an aviary or shed and given an anthelmintic drug (e.g. Mebenvet)
for the prescribed period.
Food and Water
At Daws Hall Wildfowl Farm, where a large collection of waterfowl are
kept on series of ponds, liberty pheasants drink where they feel inclined and
feed with the other birds. With the immense amount of natural food available
to them, their intake of corn and pellets is very small. Where such conditions
do not prevail, clean water and food must be distributed as required.
Breeding
Due to inter-specific aggression, predators and other factors, spectacular
breeding results from exotic pheasants at liberty are unlikely to be obtained.
The routine on this farm is to lift all first clutches and to hatch and rear the
offspring using broody hens or artificial methods. Later clutches are left to
the parent birds and some will always succeed in hatching and rearing their
own offspring. It is interesting to note that pheasant poults raised by their
own mothers grow far quicker than those subjected to artificial methods.
From the time of leaving the nest, the chicks are remarkably independent
and roost with their mothers a week from birth.
Behavioural Observation
Those keeping pheasant species at liberty have unrivalled opportunities
for observing their natural behaviour. By keeping a notebook and recording
as much information as possible, much can be learned about the natural
instincts of these beautiful and fascinating birds.

WORLD PHEASANT ASSOCIATION:
THE FIRST THREE YEARS
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999059775" page_id="56283659"  page_num="195" year="" vol="">
By DR. T. LOVEL (Andover, England)
One evening in May 1975 three friends and their wives were discussing
over dinner the pheasants which they all kept in their aviaries. The talk
turned to the lack of up-to-date knowledge about these birds in the wild and
the great need for research on their requirements in captivity. By the end of
the dinner a clear decision had been taken to endeavour to form an internat-
ional organisation specifically devoted to this group of birds. This was how
the World Pheasant Association came into existence. On the 20th June a
meeting in London attended by a dozen enthusiasts formed the Foundation
Council meeting. It was agreed that the organisation would have four object
ives: conservation, education, research and good aviculture with the form-
ation of reserve collections. The next important decision was to invite Jean
Delacour,undoubtedly the most famous living ornithologist in the world, to
become our president, and to this he readily agreed. It was on his advice that
we decided to include all the Galliformes , rather than just the pheasants which
had been our primary aim. This meant that the grouse species, the partridges
and quail, the megapodes, the large family of cracids, the curassows, guans
and chachalacas, the turkeys and the guinea fowl were all included in our
scope. We decided on the name of the World Pheasant Association, notwith-
standing its narrow scope, as "Galliforme" was considered too esoteric and
"Gamebird" too loaded.
The take-off from that inaugural meeting was truly phenomenal. We set
out to attract members and now have over 1400 members from more than 50
countries. Quite soon individual countries wished to have their own sections
or chapters of W. P. A. and these have been formally started in Pakistan,
France, Nepal, India and West Germany. Other chapters will follow soon,
and eventually become strong enough to publish their proceedings in their
own languages.
The chairman of each group is ex-officio a member of Council, and we
have found the language barrier to be of little significance, for one can
overcome any difficulties when such enthusiasm is present. To facilitate
matters, however, our brochures are now printed in four different languages.
W. P. A. was elected a non-governmental member of the International
Union for Conservation of Nature and Natural Resources (IUCN), a signal
honour for such a young organisation. It has also been accorded formal
liaison relationship by the International Council for Bird Preservation (ICBP).
Clearly any organisation is of little value without money with which to
implement its policies, so in 1976 W. P. A. launched an ambitious appeal for
funds under the presidency of Lord de L'Isle. This was a great success and in
less than 12 months we achieved our target of giving W. P. A. an income of

around #10,000 per annum over the next ten years, which will support
several of the important projects that we wish to encourage. However, this
does not by any means imply that we are flush with funds! Almost all this
money is already ear-marked for specific projects and we have now reached a
stage where ideas for new work come in almost daily. Each involves a lengthy
process of consultation and reference to acknowledged authorities in that
particular field, for we must be sure that a project is well worked out and
likely to produce worthwhile results, and that we get our priorities right.
Bird people always like to get together. A one-day meeting in September
1975 at Ashmere was followed by our first convention at Daws Hall the
following year. This proved very popular and therefore in 1977 we hosted an
international convention which began at Ashmere and then moved to Cleres
for the celebration of our President's 87th birthday. 240 people came from 16
countries, including the U.S.A., Canada, Pakistan, Mexico and Australia.
Next year another very successful convention was held at Bradford and
Harewood Bird Garden. We feel that it is of vital importance to bring people
together in this way, either in large conventions or in smaller symposia and
workshops, to achieve the best cross fertilisation of ideas and methods. A
symposium on the woodland grouse species last December brought together
scientists from every country where Black Grouse and Capercaillie are found,
so that the present status and future needs of these birds could be reviewed;
the proceedings have now been published for the benefit of others.
Research is paramount in our programme. In Great Britain the study of
the infertility problems of the Brown Eared Pheasant in captivity was under-
taken at Cambridge University by Dr. Douglas Wise (Project 72) and in eight
weeks he had proved that these birds suffer from a behavioural problem in
failing to mate, rather than being truly sterile. This had never been demonstrated
before and was of great importance, both for this species and in indicating
the troubles which other species may develop in captivity. In Malaysia we
supported Geoffrey Davison, who is already doing research on the Great
Argus Pheasant, in a new project No. 33) which enabled him to undertake a
long and hazardous mission to the extreme north of Malaysia, and there to be
the first non-Asian ever to see the Crested Argus, Rheinartia ocellata , in
the wild. We also supported his participation in the Royal Geographical
Society's expedition to the Gunong Mulu reserve in Sarawak where he
surveyed the phasianids of the area. Further work on the Malaysian phasianids
is being planned. In Nepal the Langtang Expedition of Durham University
was supported by W. P. A. (project 103) and much useful information about
the pheasants in that area has been obtained. In Papua New Guinea our
research fellow, David Bishop, has begun a two year survey of the megapodes
(Project 24) in the area and in spite of numerous difficulties, injury and
illness, David has proved an outstanding field worker.
In Pakistan, W. P. A. has carried out field censuses on the Western
Tragopan and Koklass pheasants (Project 39) and recently financed the
appointment of Dr. Sheldon Severingham of Cornell University to undertake

full time field work in Pakistan (Project 86). Shel is well known to most
pheasant enthusiasts for his five years' research in Taiwan on the Swinhoe's
and Mikado pheasants, and he proved to most people's satisfaction that
both the Mikado andSwinhoe are far from being near to extinction.
They are difficult to find, but undoubtedly exist there, in some number, and
the Mikado particularly is making a considerable come-back where primitive
high forest has been felled and replaced by secondary scrub. Recent habitat
destruction, however, in Taiwan causes great concern for the future of both
species -- vide W. P. A. Journal III.
Education is always vital -- and W. P. A. has endeavoured to teach the
general public about the need for conservation of the Galliformes by every
means. It has held displays at numerous events such as the British Game
Fairs, Scottish Game Fair, and similar events overseas, and this has attracted
great interest. At the Game Fair 1977 we calculated that 18,000 people had
passed through the W. P. A. stand in two days. We decided to publish a
Newsletter and an annual Journal and under the co-editorship of Iain
Grahame and Steve Wylie (St. Louis Zoo) this has been an outstanding
success. A Newsletter three times a year gives members an up-to-date
account of what is going on in a bright and informative way. The Journal is
published once a year and comprises over 130 pages of original work,
research reports and articles specially commissioned, all of the highest
quality and interest. It has already been accepted as one of the leading
scientific journals on this particular subject. W. P. A. has also been honoured
to be the joint publisher with Spur Publications of the second edition of Jean
Delacour's great work The Pheasants of the World. This was very exciting and
I personally felt a tremendous responsibility as I brought the precious
typescript back by hand from Jean's house at Cleres to deliver it to the
printer. After numerous crises lasting almost six months I was able to take
the first six copies from the printer to the Convention in September 1977 and
to give the very first copy into the hands of the author. W. P. A. has made a
film, Vanishing Pheasants which has been shown in four continents and this
will be followed by other films in due course.
Trainees from Pakistan, Thailand and elsewhere have come to Britain for
education on pheasant management and aviculture (Project 69) and have
gone home to put this experience into practice. An education committee has
been formed to oversee all these activities and to plan future developments.
Conservation is a word that is on everyone's lips, but W. P. A. feels strongly
that rushing some European-bred birds into a tropical country for release
without proper studies both before and after such release is a waste of time
and effort, to say nothing of birds.
Even in captivity, birds bred in a temperate zone such as Britain do not
withstand the abrupt change to tropical life, and therefore W. P. A. does not
believe in sending out adult birds at all to such areas. In Nepal, Pakistan and
India the W.P.A. has first sent out from the U.K. eggs of good bantams to
establish a flock of broodies which are reliable and quiet. This also tests the
ability of the airline concerned to carry .eggs safely, and of the recipients to

handle and rear these hardy birds. The following years we have sent eggs
from Cheer and Monal Pheasants and have obtained good hatching results.
In 1978 a large programme has been devised for the export of eggs of both
these species and of the White-crested Kalij to both India and Pakistan. We
are sure that chicks hatched in these countries will do very much better than
if they had been reared in the U.K. and flown out later.
It is most important to have a healthy avicultural programme because of
the great need for stocks of these species to be preserved as reserve popula-
tions for future or indeed present calamity in the wild. Such species as the
Elliot's, Hume's and Edwards's Pheasants are maintained throughout the
world in considerable numbers, and until precise field work can be done in
the wild to determine their status it is very important to maintain these birds
in captivity. The Edwards's Pheasant has started almost at the inception of
the W. P. A. The official approval of the IUCN was obtained for the founda-
tion of such a Stud Book; we had no knowledge of this pheasant's status in
the wild except that it lived only on the demilitarized zone of Vietnam, and
had been rare even before the twenty years of warfare devastated that country.
Its status in captivity was also unknown, but worrying tendencies to genetic
mutation were beginning to appear. Sterility and a tendency to breed only
male young was also apparent in some countries.
Now after three years' work running the Stud Book I can say that I have
registered over 850 individual Edward's Pheasants, a population never coun-
ted before. We can also contrust pedigrees, give advice on the best pairing of
birds and arrange transfer of birds between one breeder and another (and
indeed between one continent and other), to obtain the best possible "mix" of
the genetic pool available. Every major collection in the world which possesses
this species has co-operated with this study, and scores of private breeders
have sent in their replies to my questionnaire. I shall never manage to record
every single Edwards's Pheasant, but the vast majority will, I am sure, benefit
from being identified, numbered and watched over! There is already
considerable evidence that fertility in the U.K. stock has improved markedly
since this study began, particularly thanks to the generous help given us by
Jersey W. P. T.
Avicultural research on such important topics as nutrition, soil-borne
diseases and release techniques into the wild are all important, and W. P. A.
is currently undertaking research in these and other matters.
One could continue forever writing about W. P. A. -- indeed for those of
us at the hub of the organisation, it has taken over our homes and lives to a
large extent! It has produced many opportunities for us to lecture and for
some to travel abroad; it has meant that we have made many marvellous
friendships which otherwise we would never have achieved; and for those of
us who stay at home it has meant that we can do much to preserve these
beautiful and endangered birds in the peace and quiet of their own gardens,
and thus contribute to their ultimate survival.

As I have been enthralled with this genus for the past twenty
years, it will not be difficult to write this article. Of the- 48 species of
identified pheasants, thirty-seven have been successfully maintained in my
aviaries at one time or other and another five have been observed elsewhere.
Although the display and feathering of the male Argus is the ninth wonder of
the world, the colouring and courtship of the common Golden and Amherst
males exquisite, and that of the peacock pheasants spectacular, the tragopans
must be considered as the best all-round aviary genus with singular
courtship display, hardiness, long life and friendly nature.
This article will be confined primarily in its material to the Temminck's
Tragopan temmincki ' Satyr Tragopan satyra and Cabot's Tragopan Tragopan
caboti. The first two have been propagated in captivity for many years by the
writer with fair success and the latter rather recently. I do not have any secret
formula or special know-how, but I do care for the welfare of my birds, am
attentive to their needs and can detect at once when they do not appear
normal. Further it is not my intention to use this space to reiterate the many
vivid descriptions of colour, habitat, etc. so oft repeated in regards to these
species, but offer a list of references that can be found at the end of the article
where such information is available.

The successful propagation of tragopans is directly related to the quality
of the stock, a propitious mating, ideal aviary conditions and _good fortune.
The species reached new lows in their captive propagation during the period
from 1955 through 1975.
The Blyth's, which prior to that time was kept in several private aviaries
has disappeared in captivity. A captive population of this species was collected
for the Kohima Zoo in India from the Naga Hills, but their breeding success
has been limited.
The Western has always been extremely rare in captivity and it is only in
recent years that working projects for their captive breeding have been
initiated in Pakistan with the assistance of the World Pheasant Association.
This remarkable organization has been responsible for progress in captive
breeding programmes of endangered species of pheasants in Pakistan, India
and Nepal. They report the existence of two specimens in captivity in their
last Census.
The Cabot's though bred freely in captivity prior to 1920 was not available
for the private propagator until 1976. The last Cabot's imported into the U.S.
were those obtained by the late Walter Oakie in 1954; however he never
raised any young. The current stock all originate from birds imported by the
Pheasant Trust from China via Hong Kong. It is believed that about 15 birds
(wild caught) were imported over a period of ten years and although a good
number of young were raised, it was not until 1975 that any of the stock was
sold to a private propagator. Several Trust members did obtain some on
breeding loan but only one was successful in raising young recently. During
1978 and 1979 the Trust sold all their Cabot's to five or six private breeders
and several have raised young. It is now hoped that a greater success may be
attained with this wider dispersion resulting in an ever increasing number of
the species in captivity.
Our Cabot's, which were obtained from the Pheasant Trust, average
three-four clutches, 12--14 eggs. However fertility during 1978 was nil from
two pairs. The males were seen to display and the neck feathers on one hen
were ruffled. In 1979 the Cabot's were all kept apart with male and female
being in adjoining aviaries. Further a Cabot's cock which was supposed to
have been fertile at the Trust was also imported in late '78 as well as a '78 hen.

aviary, cock No. 1 in second, then proven cock No. 3, hen No. 2 and cock
No. 2, and a young '78 hen. All the birds were closely observed and in late
March when cock No. 1 seemed to have attracted hen No. 1, the hatchway
was opened and the birds allowed to mix. Although the first clutch of 4 were
infertile, the next 7 were good and all were hatched. The last egg, (No. 12)
was infertile. The same tactic was tried with hen No. 2 and cock No. 2. When
the first six eggs were infertile, hen No. 2 was allowed to join prior fertile
cock No. 3. All the subsequent 10 eggs were infertile. The first year hen
never laid and did not display any mating activity. Six young Cabot's have
been raised this season and although they are all from one pair, it is hoped
that better results will be obtained next year, with the hope of establishing a
fi and f 2 generation from this breeding stock by 1982.
The Satyr Tragopan is that most widely distributed and most common
today in the aviaries of private propogators throughout the world. It is the
largest and most colourful of the tragopan species and seems to have
adapted to the widest temperature range. Whereas this very characteristic
has been the cause of a rather widespread hybridization of this species with
the Temminck's in the U.S., the stock in Europe has been relatively pure
due to the rarity of the Temminck's and new importations have decreased
inbreeding. Both of these tragopans will readily interbreed and the
differentiation between the females requires an experienced eye. Delacour
reports, "During the twenties we reared a few Temminck's each season.
They were much inbred and we barely kept the species going. We also reared
hybrids with Satyrs and recrossed them. The % hybrids were indistinguishable
fr om pure Temminck's. " The pureness of the Satyr is suspect in America and
it behoves the various authorities on the subject to be considerably more
specific in their descriptions and the standards that they have established. In
1972, I imported with others several pairs of wild caught Satyrs. Four of
these pairs are still alive in excellent condition. All have bred in captivity since
their arrival and unrelated fi and f 2 breeding pairs have also been established.
Captive bred Satyr hens rarely lay their first year and I have not had
fertility from a first year cock either with a first or second year hen. F i, F 2 and
F 3 generation hens never laid their first year nor did the cocks prove fertile
although developing full plumage at this time. Wild caught hens laid clutches
of one egg which was 25% larger in size than eggs laid by hens from a long
captive lineage. They usually averaged 4 eggs during the breeding season.
First generation hens lay an average of seven eggs -- some four to five, others
eight to nine. A second generation hen laid ten eggs in 1978 and nine in 1979.
Fertility averaged 70% from this stock with an above average 85% hatchability.
The chicks are large and strong and shatter the egg shell easily when
hatching. Although inbred captive stock laid many more eggs, fertility and
hatchability was less than 50%. Wild caught hens obtained have been laying
annually since. Perhaps it was luck but the original pairing of the wild caught
birds were more or less propitious. They all got along well producing many
fine offspring.

Wild caught Satyr Tragopans - Slim and Upright
Many pairs have been distributed from this pure stock throughout America
and Europe and it is hoped that this lineage can be kept free of the impure
stock that still exists. All the wild caught Satyr cocks that were examined
were covered with coal black feathers on the head and wattles while most of
the Satyr cocks that I had at the time as well as many seen in private
collections throughout the country had a very sparse black feathering in
these areas. So sparse in fact that the blue coloration of the skin was exposed
in a manner similar to that of the Temminck's.
The wild caught birds are slim and stand upright. They are always looking
upward, perhaps to escape the confines of their aviary. The Satyr hatched
and raised in captivity from captive stock is invariably a heavier bird,
especially the hen and they very rarely look upward, keeping their heads
down in the direction of the aviary floor. The colorations of the wild-caught
cocks are very vivid and bright with the ocelli being sharply defined.
Obviously the females of the two species which are similar in appearance,
when crossed with opposite males result in offspring which is off-colour in
the body with a sparse black feathering on the head of the Satyr cock. The
blue skin appears exposed and the ocelli blurred rather than sharply defined.
The Satyr hen is larger and stands higher than the Temminck's. It is slightly
lighter in colour, more on an even brownish colour. The Temminck's hen has
dark markings on head, neck and back. The Satyr is somewhat more nervous
and less trusting than the other species.

Wild caught male Captive-raised female
Although Iwas extremely lucky with the matings of the imported Satyrs,
such has not been the case with the Temminck's and Cabot's. In the former
case I have frequently exchanged mates, kept extra hens and cocks in
adjoining cages with hope of creating fertile pairs. I have usually succeeded
in obtaining a fertile pair. Several breeders have been using artificial insemination
to solve this problem especially where the male may be unable because of
physical problems to copulate naturally. AI would also be useful in cases
where the male may come into breeding condition before the females and
semen from another male could then be used. I have had all the species I now
have at one time or other breed naturally and find that sufficient acclimation
to the captive existence of the species has already been made without the
"ultimate". AI should only be the last resort or a tool for the physically
handicapped bird.
The Temminck's prior to 1975, although available in many U.S. collections
was extremely rare in Europe. The late Samuel Holmgren was by far the
most prolific breeder of this species for almost thirty years in the U.S.
Unfortunately his stock had never been revitalized with new blood from the
wild and as a result only limited success was attained in the captive breeding
of his progeny. Present stock in the U.S. including mine and those in Europe
are inbred and tainted by crossing with the Satyr. However several pairs of
wild caught birds have now been obtained and it is hoped that a pure line can
be established.
Temminck's hens lay an average of ten eggs and occasionally a hen will lay
as many as .sixteen. The stock is inbred and fertility with mated pairs has
been a poor 35% and only careful incubator control of temperature and
humidity permits a 75% hatch. A first generation wild caught Temminck's
hen mated with a good two year cock laid two eggs her first year in 1978, both
were fertile, hatched and raised to maturity. In 1979 the hen was paired with
a wild caught male and laid six fertile eggs, all of which hatched. I have never
successfully kept trios of either of these species over a period of time.

Although several propagators in the U.S. have succeeded over a longer
period of time with fertility being obtained with both hens. One hen always
appeared to become subservient to the other and the problem was mainly the
relationship between the two hens rather than the cock. Often one hen would
keep the other away from the feed and in another trio one hen fought
constantly with the other. I have had a single cock fertilize two hens each in
an adjoining aviary. I kept the cock four days with one hen and four days
with the other using a hatchway to connect the aviaries.
The age of production may vary in breeding pairs of the same species, but
I have a pair of Temminck's that have laid from eight to ten eggs annually
since 1964 with a minimum of four chicks being hatched each year. Although
my longest such production with a Satyr has been nine years, I have heard of
pairs laying fertile eggs for thirteen years.

It is said that the larger the aviary size the better the breeding results and
physical condition of the birds. Tragopans have a tendency to become heavy
and should be given as much room as possible to exercise in. Our aviaries for
tragopans have evolved through the years from minimal enclosures of 120
square feet with scant protection to our present set up which now appears to
yield superior results as well as protection against our winters which are
gradually becoming more severe. During the past years the prolonged
periods of freezing temperatures, heavy snowfalls, and ice storms have
created the necessity for a protected inside enclosure. Although the tragopans

are known as high altitude cold weather birds, they do fluff up their feathers
when exposed to our damp cold to provide more efficient insulation against
this exposure. Trees and plantings within the aviary provide shade and
provisions are made for good circulation of air during the hot periods of
summer. Our present aviaries have an inside enclosure sixteen feet high at
one end with a translucent fibreglass roof arching down from the 16&apos; height
to 8&apos;. The arch prevents snow accumulation. Perches extending from 15&apos; to
5&apos; in height are provided as well as tree stumps of different lengths and slopes
within the inside enclosure which has a width of twelve feet. A hatchway 16&amp;quot;
high X 14&amp;quot; wide leads to an outside aviary 36&apos; long, 12&apos; wide and 9&apos; high.
Weeping grafted mulberry trees which provide shade and berries are in each
outside aviary with Andorra creeping juniper, dwarf Mugho pine, morning
glory vine, rhododendron thickets and dwarf cotoneaster. Perennial rye grass
is sown in the outdoor aviary and replenished every spring. Hardware cloth
0/4&amp;quot; galvanized steel mesh) 30&amp;quot; wide extending 18&amp;quot; under ground level
culminating in a 6&amp;quot; right angle bend facing away from the aviary wall is
fastened to redwood boards (1&amp;quot; X 12&amp;quot;) which start 6&amp;quot; in the ground. This
serves as a deterrent to most rodent type predators when they attempt to dig
underneath the aviary. The boards are bolted on to a 2&amp;quot; galvanized pipe
which is used for uprights and cross members. The arched roof is also
supported by 2&amp;quot; galvanized pipe that is bent in a jig to create an arched slope
for the roof. An additional two feet of redwood siding is used creating a wall
30&amp;quot; above the ground level and also between adjoining aviaries. Half inch
galvanized aviary wire is used to form the outer walls and a protective roof of
translucent fibreglass extends from the curvature of the roof of the inside
aviary, eight feet out over the roof of the outside aviary. One inch galvanized
aviary wire is used for the roof to allow for snow fall. An outside perch under
the middle of the outside roof 5 feet high is also used besides the various
plants, rocks and tree stumps. The floor of the inside aviary has a 6&amp;quot; layer of
bank gravel on top of the soil. This is easy to keep clean, supplies grit and is
dust free. In early spring after raking, this floor is treated with live steam
from a portable steam generator as are the side boards, perches, and nest
boxes. All wood parts in the aviary (perches, nest boxes, side walls, ceiling)
are painted with a thin slurry of a decontaminating agent (Carbola). This
process is repeated after the breeding season and again before winter sets in.
All our tragopans are arboreal in nature and perch at night on branches at
the peaks of the indoor aviary (13&amp;quot; --15&amp;quot; high), although I use an automatic
watering system in the inside aviaryies most of the year, during the winter
five gallon galvanized water units are used with a temperature controlled
water heater threaded into the bottom of the can. The units will heat the
water at 35*F and kick out at 40*F. The water is kept clean and fresh. The
feeders are made of galvanized metal with an inclined cover and a device to
prevent food materials from being strewn on the aviary floor.

Are of two types both of which are placed in every aviary in the inside
enclosure. One box is 3 feet long, 14&amp;quot; high and two feet wide placed 6 feet
above the ground alongside a perch. It is treated with a poultry dust before
the breeding season and lined with pine needles and alfalfa hay. The second
is on legs 6&apos; high 30&amp;quot; wide and 8&amp;quot; deep. It is four-sided with plywood and
also contains a shelf two feet above the ground with two openings in which a
bird may hide and be free from outside disturbance. Aviaries also contain a
shelf 6&apos; long 10&amp;quot; above the aviary floor and 12&amp;quot; wide which is connected to
the aviary wall and serves as a protective area under which a hen may retreat
in case her mate becomes belligerent. I have never had a tragopan hen attack
a cock except when a trio was attempted. Tragopans will lay all their eggs
consistently in their nest box once it has been accepted. They are almost
always clean and rarely have any excrement on them. One out of ten hens
might occasionally lay an egg from a perch or not in the nest box, however
their next clutch invariably will be in the box.
Incubation
Eggs are collected in the morning and at dusk and are placed in the
incubator within four hours after collection. My incubator room is kept at
70*F and the humidity is fairly constant. The incubator temperature is kept
at 99.5*F +/- l / 4 *. The relative humidity is maintained at 84% wet bulb
reading. Eggs are hand turned in two planes three times daily -- pipped eggs
are removed to a hatcher. The hatcher is kept at 88% to 90% relative
humidity (wet bulb reading). *4&amp;quot; hardware cloth is used for footing therein
and the chicks are kept in the hatcher twenty-four hours after hatching at
which time they are thoroughly dry and very alert. The additional moisture
is necessary especially to assist the inbred Temminck's chicks in their final
hours of hatching. Although I have used foster mothers for incubation over a
period of time, I find the use of incubators more efficient and the ultimate
results superior to the more costly use of the broody hen. At present we raise
from three to four hundred rare pheasants annually and it would take a
prohibitive bank of broodies to service this quantity which are hatched
within a 60 day period.
Brooding
Upon removal from the incubator the chicks are then placed in individual
brooder boxes made of wood -- 12&amp;quot; wide, 18&amp;quot; high and 24&amp;quot; long. Paper
towels are placed on the bottom and a blue grow bulb is used for heat. The
heat intensity is controlled by a rheostat. The paper towel and individual
bird in the box allows me to observe the droppings of the chick. The chick is
started with a mixture of chick grains (fine cracked corn, millets and barley)
and water medicated with a vitamin added streptomycin penicillin mixture
for the first few days. As soon as the tract has been cleared, fine ground
crumbles are added as well as fine chopped pieces of alfalfa. The chicks,

like their parents, are very fond of greens and fresh cut alfafa is added three
times daily on top of the feed which is a commercial turkey starter feed with
grains added. Protein level is kept below 20%. Perches are supplied at once
and temperature in the brooder box starts at 95*C and is reduced five
degrees a week. After three weeks the chick is transferred with another chick
to a small cage 3 feet high, 2 feet wide and 20&amp;quot; deep. The temperature is
maintained at 80*C. A small pine branch is used both for hiding and
perching. The older chicks are continued on the same diet of fresh cut alfalfa
and starter pellets. After 4 weeks the chicks are moved with two others into
an inside aviary 6 feet high, 8 feet wide and 10 feet long. A heat lamp is
provided and again pine branches are used for perching and hiding. Mealworms
and peanuts are now used to get the chicks moving and accustomed to their
new aviary. After two weeks a hatch leading to an outside aviary is opened.
Fresh lettuce, apple, squash, cucumber and melon (when available from
garden) and peanuts are fed consecutively on different days. The floor of the
inside aviary is a bank run gravel which drains well and can be readily
cleaned. The outside aviary is landscaped with evergreen and has a stand of
alfalfa and grasses.
Nutrition of Breeders
In conjunction with propitiously mated breeding stock, draughtfree
landscaped large aviaries, breeder feed is most important in sustaining good
fertility, hatchability and the potential of both adults and offspring. Tragopans
are by nature of their original habitat primarily vegetarians and we feed fresh
cut alfalfa daily after they have grazed down the spring sowings of alfalfa and
grasses. Squash, cucumbers and apples are fed as they become available in
our own gardens. Raspberries and mulberries are made available from
plantings within the aviary. During the Long Island winter, raisins, cut
grapes and small shelled green peanuts are substituted. Although mealworms
are fed to the chicks especially when they are moved from a smaller enclosure
to a large one we do not find it necessary to give them to the adults. We use
this tidbit as a means of decreasing the emotional stress which at times
results in a curling of the toes. Most of the above are offered once a week
except for apples which are supplied daily.
Commercial game bird grower (19% protein) (July to Dec.) and breeder
(Jan. to June) (21% protein) are kept in hoppers throughout the year. The
feed is checked twice weekly and only a fixed quantity is added to the
hoppers at that time. Peanuts are given to the breeders daily (a dozen to a
pair) at the same time each morning. They are usually awaiting my arrival or
as soon as they hear the sounds emitted by those fed before, hasten to the
front of the aviary for this tidbit.
Health Care
Using the peanut technique we can examine every bird's condition daily
and if a bird does not make an appearance at this time, I immediately search
them out. At times I do discover a problem, but with this technique we can

almost always remedy an ailment having caught it in time. Needless to say,
birds are occasionally lost and at these times they are immediately posted.
We do have our own small hospital with a quarantine area, where weekly
fecal analyses are made, an aviary section at a time. Several aviaries are used
for quarantine purposes of new arrivals in this building and contain special
heating arrangements for use in the treatment of sick birds. In the Long
Island area, heavy rains followed by a sharp drop in temperature frequently
upset a bird and an anti-biotic given orally or injected in conjunction with a
heated aviary usually leads to a quick recovery.

Marking and Record Keeping
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.995025909090909" page_id="56283672"  page_num="208" year="" vol="">
All eggs are marked with the date and aviary number and recorded in a
note book when picked up. Upon hatching or if infertile -- recording is so
made. The chick is banded to indicate the parents and young birds from
different parents are shipped to other propagators with the hope of creating
productive matings.
In conclusion, the most important factors for the propagation of tragopans,
as for most pheasants, require a good breeding stock, a propitiously mated
pair, large landscaped avaiaries with greens and fruits being added to the diet
regularly.
The following are recommended for information as to the history, habitat,
nutrition and behaviour of tragopans in the wild.

THE CRACIDAE
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.997229357142857" page_id="56283674"  page_num="210" year="" vol="">
By Dr. Jesus Estudillo Lopez (Mexico)
As the Phasianidae family is native both to the Old World and the New
World, so the members of the Cracidae are exclusive to the tropical Americas;
from Mexico to the tropics in Central and South America.
Both families are of the order Galliformes, although they are totally
different; the Cracidae phylogenetically are completely separate from the
rest of the Galliformes, hybrids between pheasants and domestic chickens,
guinea fowl, have frequently been described while a hybrid has never been
reported between a cracid and any other galliform bird.
The Cracidae comprise various genera: Crax, Mitu, Pauxi , which
includes the large representatives of the family, and which in English are
known as curassows, which name is totally inadequate, since in the island of
Curacao off South America, there has never existed any species of these
birds, but apparently the first birds which were sent to Europe from Curacao
Island came originally from the continent.
The so-called guans are of numerous genera and well defined; some
comprise several species as in the case of the genus Penelope , with the species
purpurascens , argyrotis , montagm, barbata, jacuacu , marail , ortom\ albipenms,
obscura, jacucaca, superciliaris, dabbenei , ochrogaster, pileata.
The members of the genus Penelope are birds of a bronze colour with
different shades from almost black to an ochre colour sprinkled with white;
according to the species they vary from a medium sized turkey (P. purpur-
ascens) to birds somewhat larger than a pigeon {argyrotis, superciliaris).
The genus Pipile comprises six species: pipile, cumanensis, nattereri, cujubi,
granyiand jacutinga. These birds are of a black coloration with the tips of the
wings white and with different colouring on the head and face, according to
the species. Chamaepetes, a genus with two species: unicolor and goudoti, the
first of a dark black colour and blue face, native to Central America, the
second, in different tones of brown and native of South America, both
species inhabiting cloud forests.
Other genera such as Oreophasis, Penelopina and Aburria are each of a
single species comprising individuals totally different in all their characteristics,
size, form, voice, etc.
Finally, the genus Ortalis, which covers the smallest members of the
Cracidae, the chachalacas, all of them possessing a loud voice.
All the members of the Cracidae inhabit the tropical jungles of America,
rain or cloud forests, with the exception of chachalacas which live in the edges
of jungles or in semi-arid tropics.
In no other family of game birds is there so little information available; in
many cases knowledge concerning a species was based exclusively on information
acquired by one or two individuals, often ignoring the geographic distribution
in nature.

This lack of knowledge takes in such basic aspects as the taxonomy, since
to some authors Crax, Mitu and Pauxi are all of the same genus although
personally my opinion is that there are three different genera. As much can
be said of the genera Aburria and Pipile , which are indistinctly known as one
genus or also, two different genera. In the near future, through kario-types
studies and electrophoretic studies on plasma and haemoglobin, we hope to
be able to give more solid arguments for the full understanding of these
genera.
As a general rule, cracids are extremely territorial; never are two species of
the same genus found sharing the same habitat without a good reason which
may force them, such as a long drought, etc.
On occasions the altitude may be the reason for the limited distribution of
species of the same genus; for example, in the case of guans of the genus
Penelope in the Andes of South America, Penelope montagni is found at
2500 -- 3000 metres above sea level, Penelope argyrotis substitutes at 1500 -- 2000
metres in the same zone and in the jungles at the foot of the Andes and in
lower zones at 800 metres or less. Other species substitutes the former, such
as Penelope ortoni, jacuacu , etc. Other times, geographic factors such as high
ridges, the great rivers of South America, open lands, tend to limit the
distribution of species, but in a good number of cases, the limiting factor for
the distribution of one species is not known. Some species may have enormous
territories of hundreds of thousands of square kilometres, such as Crax
globulosa and Crax fasciolata, the first occupying part of the Amazon jungle,
to the south of Colombia, Ecuador, Peru, north and central Brazil, the
second, occupying the regions of Mato Grosso in Brazil, Bolivia and Paraguay,
while other species are autolimited to very small territories, as in the case of
Crax blumenbachi in the north-east of Brazil and although there is scientific
evidence that sometimes these jungles communicated with the Amazon
region, this species only proliferates near the coast. There are other numerous
examples in the territoriality of the Cracidae in which species have autolimited
themselves to very restricted and specialized territories. As in the case of
Oreophasis which only lives in volcanic regions of the extreme south of
Mexico and in the north of Guatemala between 1200 -- 3000 metres high
without a satisfactory explanation as to why they did not spread toward the
north of the Sierra Madre in Mexico, or toward the south of Guatelama
where there are similar habitats.
It is very probable that the voice may be one of the mechanisms which
serve to mark territory, not only between the different species but also
among individuals of a same species. During reproduction pairs are formed
and stay together during all the reproduction and raising of the chicks in
which the male also takes part. In the case of Crax, Mitu and Pauxi during
the period of reproduction, the voice of the male is heard emitting sounds
which go from a very low pitch to a very high one, something like a howling
ending in a very shrill sound, almost imperceptible to the human ear. On
more than one occasion when a pair of birds has been dispersed by the

presence of man or some predator, the male emits a very shrill sound in order
to establish contact with his companion. In the same manner, if the female
with her young is frightened, she gathers the chicks who remain in hiding
among dry leaves if they are still unable to fly and when the danger is over the
mother calls them through very shrill sounds.
Cracids are essentially arboreal, above all, guans and species of cloud
forests. They feed on fruits, tender foliage, insects and most probably on
small reptiles and mammals; during the breeding period they are frequently
found along the edges of rivers and lakes searching for water snails and other
animal protein food.
The adaption to the environment of a species is very specialized, as for
example, the species which live in high places have their face and neck
densely covered with feathers as well as their legs down to the tarsus, as in the
case of Chamaepetes, Aburria and other guans which inhabit high mountains,
while species of the same genera which inhabit torrid zones, have the same
parts devoid of feathers.
Within a same species the influence of the environment is manifested in
several forms. As a general rule, the species situated in the extreme northern
part of the distribution for the Cracidae, are the largest for example, Crax
rubra of Mexico and Central America, which is the largest of all Crax;

Penelope purpurascens of Mexico and Central America is not only the largest
of the Penelope species, but also, the same species in the extreme southern
distribution in Venezuala and Colombia: Penelope purpurascens equatorialis
is 30% smaller than the Mexican race as also in the Ortalis; Ortalispoliocephala
is the largest of the chachalacas. In several species there are considerable
changes in colour depending on the territory; this adaptation is especially
noticeable in the femals for example, in the colour of the female of Crax rubra
in Mexico which is dark mahogany in the States of Tamaulipas and Veracruz,
in the State of Yucatan it is slightly clearer; the same species in the south of
Central America, in Costa Rica and Panama, shows clear bands in the tail
and in Colombia, the same species is of a reddish colour. Besides the
adaptation to the environment, there are sudden and inexplicable variations
in colour (phases) and which differ completely from the characteristic colour
of the species.
All this has caused confusion and reflects on the scientific nomenclature;
such phases in colour have led to belief that they are different species.
Territoriality, its low reproduction rate, the lowest of the galliformes: two
or three eggs maximum per year, added to the constant hunting to which all
the members of the Cracidae are subject, since they are the preferred game
birds of the American jungle because of their size and flavour, added to the
massive destruction of their habitat for agricultural purposes has unfortunately
placed in danger of extinction several members of the family.
Since remote times it has been possible to keep curassows and guans as
they have been kept as semi-domestic birds by natives and some attempt had
been made at domestication as was done with the turkey, native of Mexico
and North America. Because of the difficulty to reproduce them in captivity
and lack of precocity, the attempt at domestication was rapidly abandoned.
In order to carry out their reproduction in captivity, it is necessary to keep
in mind several factors: the adaptation to captivity, climatic needs, specialized
nutrition, etc. Besides the previous factors, in several members of the
Cracidae, the determination of sex is difficult, for genera such as Penelope,
Chamaepetes, Mitu, Pauxi and Oreophasis do not have sexual dimorphism at
all, for which reason it is much more difficult to propagate them since birds
of the same sex may be kept for some time without the owner knowing it.
In some cases there exist tracheal loops in the male which permit the
differentiation of sexes such as Urumutum, Ortalis, but in other cases, there is
no such indication and only through constant observation is it possible to
determine sex. When one has more than two birds in an aviary there is
danger when establishing the pairs that the dominant male and the female
will rapidly kill the extra male or the surplus female, which may occur one
day without previous notice.
At present it is possible to use laparotomy and chromosome determinations
for the sexing.

lower temperatures.
My avaries measure 15 metres long, 5 metres wide and 3 high; they are
densely planted with trees and bushes, and the guans pass most of the time
atop the trees. The nests are, in accordance with the size of the species,
always located in high places since all cracids build their nests in trees. The
breeding season is normally during the months of March, April up to July,
when the rainy season starts in Mexico. Birds from the jungle in their first
year of breeding in captivity rarely produce more than a clutch of two eggs,
while birds born in captivity can produce up to three clutches of eggs and
through a light control combined with an increase in proteins, it is possible to
obtain clutches in other seasons of the year in the months of November and
December.
The basic nourishment is a balanced feed with 28% protein, fruits such as
banana, papaya, tomatoes, and during the reproduction period soya paste is
added with egg and minced meat.
Most of the curassows and guans are maintained in pairs and occasionally,
I have kept them in trios. During the breeding season the male displays in a
tree by arching his back, emitting a unique low mating call which varies
greatly from one species to another; he flutters his wings, arches his tail up
and prances around the hen in this manner. He also runs back and forth in

the aviary around the hen. Normally, they are fertile in their third year of
age; eggs are quite large in relation to the bird's size, of a white colour with
very thick shell.
These eggs I incubate in automatic turning incubators which turn every
hour. They are kept at a temperature of 99.8*F the first 25 to 28 days with a
relative humidity of 86* the last 2 or 3 days, temperature is lowered to 99.5*
and humidity is increased from 88 to 90*. The chick at birth is very strong,
and readily breaks out of the egg shell.
Chicks are fed the first few days with starter turkey mash with added
vitamins and chopped fruit. It is also effective to use domestic broody turkey
hens who can do a good job in the incubation of curassow and guan eggs.
The brooder box I use when the chicks are hand-raised is 18&amp;quot; high by 18&amp;quot;
long and 14&amp;quot; wide and contains an electric bulb for heat. Perches are
supplied in the brooder box, where curassows as well as guans perch from
the very first day and this avoids toe problems. The floor is wire for
cleanliness; temperature is approximately 70* F. The chicks are not pugnacious
and as many as four can be kept together; they usually do not feather pick and
after one month are transferred to a larger brooder box. Two months later
they are taken to their permanent quarters. Young may be mixed but must
be marked for indentification, as the males of the different species of
currasow look very much the same when they are young. This is even more
important with guans as they can be confused very easily.
Birds are paired when they are two years of age and up: imprinting must
be avoided.
At present, I have all the species of Crax , Mitu, Pauxi , 16 forms of
Penelope , Penelopina , Chamaepetes, Oreophasis, Aburria, Pipile, Ortalis , of
which I have fortunately been able to recognize approximately 25 species.
In the future it will be necessary to protect the species which are in danger
of extinction and establish plans for the perpetuation of these splendid birds
before it is too late.
I was recently in Peru and Brazil where I was lucky to observe Penelope
albipennis and Mitu mitu mitu , both species which were considered extinct
for more than a century and I established contact with the avian authorities
of these countries for the establishment of plans for the propagation and
conservation of both species.

QUAIL IN CAPTIVITY
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.998717628571429" page_id="56283680"  page_num="216" year="" vol="">
By G. E. S. ROBBINS (Mendlesham Suffolk)
During 1978 the World Pheasant Association carried out a census of
grouse, quail, partridge and francolin, and from the results it became clear
that out of 44 listed species only 22 were recorded in captivity; furthermore
only a small number are well enough established in sufficient quantities to
represent a reasonable breeding nucleus. It is therefore essential to develop
breeding groups in each country to eliminate the possibility of a species
dying out, and to allow an interchange of breeding stock to maintain good
blood lines, and prevent inbreeding to the extent of genetic deformities
together with low fertility in the future. Unlike certain other members of the
Phasianidae family, quail are prolific egg layers when kept in captivity, thus
giving the aviculturist the opportunity of achieving success in breeding and
rearing exotic species.
Quite often quail are relegated to the floor of the aviary and people wonder
why they are unsuccessful in hatching and rearing young. This can be
explained as follows, quail do not like being subjected to draughts and damp;
a wet aviary in an exposed position is not the environment to bring birds into
breeding condition at the beginning of a season.
Over the last few years a number of breeders have been experimenting
with various types of housing. To date the best accommodation would
appear to be an enclosed house, except for the front which contains the
access door, feeding compartment with the remaining area covered in wire
mesh. The floor area measuring 1.3mX1.3m with walls lm high; for ease of
feeding the house is raised approximately 0.5m off the ground, the roof being
covered in stiff corrugated polythene sheeting on a wooden frame under
which a piece of thin polythene is stretched to act as a cushion should the
birds fly upwards. The most suitable floor covering is a mixture of sharp
sand and peat, which eliminates the possibility of worm infection. The house
described is adequate to house one breeding pair and for the aviculturist who
has a small garden, a number of houses built together in module form can
take up very little space, yet achieve the same satisfaction as the large
pheasant breeder with plenty of land at his disposal.
The majority of species available to the aviculturist in the U.K. and
europe originate from the New World; listed are the species which are
known to be breeding in captivity. (Extract from 1978 census).

To maintain breeding birds during the winter a diet of chick crumbs
mixed with white millet at proportions of three to one is adequate; in the case
of the smaller quail mixed millet and maw seeds is added to the crumbs
together with a little live food. Birds are fed ad lib all the year round from a
hopper, grit being available at all times.
Given reasonable cover of grasses and shrubs most species will make a

breeding pair have laid within a confined space the chicks will usually stay
with the parent birds to maturity.
For those who wish to incubate artificially there are a number of good
incubators on the market which will hatch quail eggs most successfully: we
use a still air type incubator which is housed in a barn with high humidity,
but a stone outbuilding or stable where the temperature remains constant is
equally suitable.
Eggs should be collected daily and stored in a cool place until sufficient
numbers are available to set: during storage they should be turned daily
through 180 degrees, it is unwise to keep eggs for more than 10 days and
expect a high hatch rate.
When using a still air incubator the eggs have to be turned twice a day and
sprayed with water on each occasion; this is unnecessary with a fully automatic
egg turning incubator. It is well to date the eggs at the time of setting so stale
eggs can be recognized and removed.
When the quail hatch, they are left in the incubator for at least twelve
hours before being placed in a brooder box. This is made of 13mm chipboard
and measures 18&amp;quot; (45.5cm) by 16&amp;quot; (41cm) wide by 9&amp;quot; (23cm high, with a
wire top covered with a sheet of glass to retain the heat given by two 60 watt
red lamps situated at the rear of the box. A floor temperature of 95 degrees is
obtained under the lamps by adjusting the amount of air space on the top by
sliding back the sheet of glass the required amount. For ventilation
(lcm) holes are drilled around the top of the box. The chicks if too hot will
spread out from under the lamp, if too cold they will huddle together.
Newly hatched chicks are fed on chick starter crumbs (25% protein)
ground in a household grinder to reduce the grain size. Additional food is not
normally required excepting those species which have an insectivorous diet.
The chicks remain in the brooder box for approx: 3 weeks during which time
the heat is gradually reduced; they are then transferred to an outside shed,
the floor of which is covered in peat, the heat is continued until the quail are

approx: 6 weeks old and are well feathered.
At 8 weeks of age in a number of species the cock birds can be identified;
however with those such as Scaled Quail, one has to wait until they moult
into adult plumage at between 12 -- 16 weeks before they can be feathered
sexed.
The protein level required at 8 weeks can be reduced to 20% by using a
chick crumb rather than a starter crumb; young quail always prefer the
smallest crumb size possible.
As the cock birds are identified it is advisable to separate them from the
hens to prevent feather pecking and fighting.
With the difficulties now being experienced in transferring birds from one
country to another, due to restrictions, together with the high cost of
quarantining, it makes it most important that the breeding stock held in each
country is maintained at a high standard, with exchanges being made to
prevent inbreeding.
It is with this objective in mind that W.P.A. Quail group was formed in
April 1979.

</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.958426085714286" page_id="56283688"  page_num="224" year="" vol="">
By PHILIP Wayre, Hon. Director (Great Witchingham, Norfolk)
Twenty years ago, this year, on 25 May, 1959, the Pheasant Trust came
into being as a registered public charity. Jean Delacour was the first President
and was to remain in that office for many years, while Lord Walsingham was
the Trust's first Vice President. Other famous names to hold office in the
new Trust include Professor Alessandro Chigi, Lord Chaplin, David Seth-
Smith, John Yealland, Phyllis Barclay-Smith and Edward Hindle. In those
days the Pheasant Trust, then called the Ornamental Pheasant Trust, was
closely affiliated to the Avicultural Society and the Trust's first four Annual
Reports were published in the Avicultural Magazine for it was not until 1964
that the Pheasant Trust produced its own Annual Report in conjunction
with that of the Norfolk Wildlife Park. At that time Arthur Prestwich,
Honorary Secretary and Treasurer of the Avicultural Society, was also a
prominent member of the Trust's Council.
In those early days Europe was still struggling to pull itself together after
the devastation of World War II and there were few pheasant collections in
private hands of any size either on the Continent or in Britain. The Leckford
pheasantry of Spedan Lewis, soon to close down, was at that time still by far
the most important in Britain.
One of the Pheasant Trust's main aims has always been to breed endangered
species of pheasant in captivity so that where possible young birds can be
reintroduced to the wild in their native lands wherever suitable habitat still
survives. Other aims have been to encourage people to keep and study
pheasants in captivity and to use whatever means are available to promote
the conservation of these beautiful birds in the wild. Bearing in mind the
paucity both of species and of numbers in captivity at the time of its
foundation, the Trust soon set about importing fresh blood from abroad and
its first Annual Report gives details of 52 individuals of 14 species of game
birds imported by the Trust during the first year of its operation. This
important contribution to aviculture was to continue on an increasing scale
and in the years to come wild-caught specimens of the following 34 forms of
pheasant were imported, most of which have been propagated at Great
Witchingham and they or their progeny distributed to members throughout
the world: --

It is probably true to say that without the Trust's importation and subsequent
propagation of nearly all of these species many of them would not exist to-
day in private collections in this country, Europe or America. Certainly no
other organisation or individual has ever carried out importations and
subsequent propagation of rare pheasants on anything like this scale.
It is interesting to note that as far back as its first Annual Report in 1960,
the Trust, through the generosity and enthusiasm of one of its founder
members, Dr. K. C. Searle, already possessed two pairs of the very rare and
endangered Cabot's Tragopan. For many years to come the Trust's nucleus
of this species was the only breeding group in captivity in the world and
between 1960 and 1978 76 specimens of this species were bred at Great
Witchingham. Only recently did Council decide to disperse these birds to
breeders in Britain, America and Europe in an attempt to ensure its future in
captivity since the possibility of re-introduction to the wild in its native land
of China seemed remote.
Also as far back as 1960 the importation of Common Koklass to Great
Witchingham is recorded. These birds were bred successfully for the first
time in Britain the following year when 7 young birds were reared. For a
number of years the Trust was the only place in the world breeding this
species in captivity and since 1961 a total of 363 specimens of this species has
been reared at Great Witchingham and since it is not considered to be in
danger of extinction in the wild all of these birds have now been distributed
to other breeders throughout the world.
More recently the Pheasant Trust has broken new ground by being the
first organisation in Britain to carry out an exchange of zoological specimens
with the People's Republic of China, as a result of which 2 pairs of wild-
caught specimens of the rare and endangered Szechuan White Eared Pheasant
and also of Brown Eared Pheasant were imported and young birds subsequently
bred from them. The Szechuan White Eared Pheasants are probably the
only pure-bred specimens of this particular race in captivity outside China,

while no wild-caught specimens of the Brown Eared Pheasant appear to have
been imported into either America or Europe since the original importation
during the latter part of the last century. The fresh genes now available to
breeders will make an important contribution to the future of this species in
captivity.
In the past the Trust maintained what was probably the largest collection
of rare pheasants in the world, but in recent years Council has decided that
with the future of many species assured in captivity, the Trust's resources
should be devoted to the conservation of pheasants and other game birds in
the wild rather than continuing to breed species in captivity for which
political and other problems preclude the possibility of re-introductions to
the wild in the foreseeable future. At the same time a small but representative
collection of endangered species will continue to be maintained at the Trust's
headquarters at Great Witchingham.
During the past two decades a number of pheasants which were rare or
non-existent in private collections have been bred to the point where there
are now satisfactory numbers in captivity in Europe and America. That this
satisfactory state of affairs has been reached is almost entirely due to the past
policy of the Pheasant Trust.
Endangered Species Bred at Great Witchingham
Emphasis has always been placed on breeding endangered species particularly
where there seemed to be a possibility of a successful re-introduction to the
wild. Of the 18 pheasants listed in the I.U.C.N. Red Data Book of Endangered
Species, 1,162 individuals of 9 forms have been bred at Great Witchingham,
some of which as detailed below have been returned to the wild in their
native lands.
Fortunately the Trust has the space, facilities and experience to breed
large numbers of pheasants at comparatively short notice. This means that
whenever a viable re-introduction programme exists within its native land
for any endangered species the Trust is in a position to breed young birds
specifically for such a project.
It is not surprising that during the past two decades new methods of
pheasant management have been evolved at Great Witchingham and in
particular in the incubation and rearing of the young birds. In 1974 a new
brooder house was built and equipped with brooders of a novel but simple
kind developed at the Trust. This unit proved remarkably successful in
subsequent years. At the same time the policy of starting eggs off under
broody bantams and subsequently hatching them in Marsh Rolex incubators
was instituted. This too has proved extremely successful and has eliminated
the use of broody bantams as foster parents with all the disease risk which
that involves.
Conservation
Re-introductions to the wild have always been high on the Trust's list of
conservation priorities. The first successful operation to help save a pheasant
which had become extremely rare in the wild was carried out by the Trust in

1967 when a number of young Swinhoe's Pheasants, bred at the Trust, were
released in a reserved forest in their native island of Taiwan. The colourful
Swinhoe's Pheasant is unique to the island and is found only on the forested
slopes of the central mountain range. The area chosen for the release is under
the control of the National Taiwan University. Swinhoe's Pheasants used to
be found there and now, as a result of the Trust's efforts, it is once again
present. A further consignment of young birds was sent for release in the
same area in 1968.
In the autumn of 1971, 24 young Cheer Pheasants were sent as a gift to the
Government of Himachal Pradesh for release in a reserved forest near Simla.
The Cheer Pheasant although not as colourful as some, is nevertheless an
interesting bird which is found only on the high slopes of the western
Himalayas where it lives among the stunted trees in the boulder-strewn
ravines. Because of its relative tameness, the Cheer Pheasant is easy to shoot
and to trap and for this reason its very existence is threatened. Not many
years ago it was found in the forests round Simla. In 1973 a further consignment
of 24 young birds was sent for release in the same area and the operation
appears to have been successful in that the species now occurs not far from
the locality and the birds may well be descended from the released specimens.
The success of this re-introduction project has been confirmed by two
independent workers. Mr. K. L. Mehta, one time Wildlife Warden for
Himachal Pradesh has confirmed that on a recent survey of the area he found
35 Cheer Pheasants including 4 hens accompanied by 7 to 9 chicks. In
addition, Dr. Anthony Gaston who made an independent visit has confirmed
that these birds still occur in the general locality and may well have descended
from the introduced specimens, although on a one day visit to the actual
release area he was unable to locate any birds owing to the height of the
vegetation at that time of the year.
The Trust has always given support and encouragement to foreign Govern-
ments and organisations attempting to breed pheasants for re-introduction
purposes. Towards the end of 1976 three pairs of Himalayan Monal, three
pairs of White-crested Kalij and three pairs of Cheer Pheasants were presented
to the Pakistan National Appeal of the World Wildlife Fund to enable the
Government of the Punjab to set up a captive breeding project for these three
species, all of which are indigenous to Pakistan but have become in danger of
extinction there. One of the aims of the project is to breed large numbers of
young birds which can be released in suitable wildlife reserves in Pakistan.
In 1971 five pairs of Hume's Bar-tailed Pheasants and other endangered
species were presented to Rangoon Zoo to enable its Director to start a
captive breeding project.
In addition to its re-introduction projects, the Pheasant Trust has produced
a full Advisory Report on the conservation of wildlife in Taiwan, including
Pheasants, for the Government of that country. An Advisory Report on
pheasant conservation in Pakistan with a special reference to the Kaghan
Valley was produced for the World Wildlife Fund and the Government of

Pakistan. In addition, field work and surveys of pheasant populations have
been supported by the Trust in Taiwan, India, Pakistan, the Philippines and
Malaysia.
No account of the Pheasant Trust's conservation work would be complete
without mention of the International Council for Bird Preservation of whose
Specialist Pheasant Group the Trust's Hon. Director was Chairman for ten
years. During that time the Trust provided the Headquarters of the Group
at Great Witchingham.
Education
Many thousands of school children visit the Norfolk Wildlife Park annually
in organised parties and have the opportunity to see the Trust's birds and at
the same time to learn about the kind of work the Trust is doing in the way of
practical conservation. In addition, the Trust has trained field workers and
students from Nepal, India, Pakistan and Hong Kong in pheasant breeding
and rearing and in conservation generally.
As to the future, the Pheasant Trust will continue to give financial support
to projects connected with pheasant conservation throughout Asia and to
this end it has recently established an Endowment Fund, the income from
which will be used for this purpose. The breeding of large numbers of a
particular species of pheasant will only be undertaken when a viable re-
introduction project in the species' native land becomes practicable.

This is the first of a new series of special issues which will occupy the last
number of Avicultural Magazine in each year, the intention being to discuss
in detail the aviculture of particular groups of birds. We hope that these
issues will be a source of much interest and useful information to our readers.
We would like to thank all the contributors who have spared time from
busy lives to write for this issue and our particular thanks are due to John
Yealland who has been, as always, a patient and kindly source of advice and
knowledge, and whose help in proof-reading has been invaluable, not only
for this issue but for every number of the Magazine published this year.
Since the breeding of rare and endangered species of pheasants is a vital
part of their conservation, both in captivity and ultimately in the wild, it
follows that the pooling of experience on this subject is essential. In this
special Pheasant Issue we have tried to gather together a collection of
articles which are representative of present knowledge. Inevitably, the great
enthusiasm which pheasant breeders are currently showing for their projects
also produces conflict of opinion and this, too, is reflected in some of the
articles in this issue. The Editor cannot accept responsibility for the opinions
expressed but hopes that no feathers will be ruffled by any of them, since the
common aim of all the writers is to preserve this very beautiful and interesting
group of birds. It is also hoped that this issue will stimulate further articles,
notes and correspondence on pheasant-keeping for future publication in the
Avicultural Magazine.
The next special issue will appear in No. 4 of Vol 86 (October--December
1980) and will be devoted to birds of prey. We would like as many contributions
as possible, long or short, so please try to send in something. The final copy
date is 1st September 1980.
Finally we would like to wish all our readers a very happy and successful
year in 1980.

Published by the World Pheasant Association 1979. Pp. 122:6 col. pis.,
photos and drawings. Price #4.50.
The general pattern of this fourth annual publication follows that of its
predecessors, commencing with a review of the year's work and progress, the
seven pages devoted to it being largely about the members and their activities
-- very necessary information no doubt, though unquestionably the birds
make more interesting reading than do the bird people.
A paper on the natural life of two flocks of the Ocellated Turkey at the
Mayan ruin of Tikal (Tikal National Park) Guatemala, studied for two
months -- February 24th until April 13th 1977 goes into great detail.
Whether this species is sufficiently different from the other member
of the Meleagridae to warrant a separate genus is a matter of opinion and
here the former generic name Agriocharis gives way to that of the more
northerly (and, of course, domesticated) Meleagris gallopavo. The American
spelling, "molt, behavior" etc. should have been brought into line with that
in the other papers, particularly as this is an English publication, exceptions
being, of course, quotations which must be given exactly as in the original.
There must surely be a more appropriate name for the adult male turkeys
than the farmyard term "gobbler". The two coloured photographs of male
and female are excellent, the iridescent and metallic sheen on the plumage
being accurately depicted and this is so in the case of a coloured plate of the
male Monal in this Journal, though this photograph looks sharp enough to
have been much enlarged and the bird could have been twice the size with,
naturally, the back and foreground correspondingly reduced in area.
There are comments on the paper in the 1977 -- 1978 Journal on the
subject of inbreeding; an article on the 14 races of Silver Pheasant and one
on the parasitic worms which includes a photograph, much enlarged, of the
well known gapeworm, though the magnification is not given, nor is it clear
whether the drug Tetramisole is effective with Syngamus as with other
nematodes. The treatment was, however, given in an excellent article published
in the Magazine (vol. 84. no. 4, p.211) together with advice on other endo-
parasites.
An account of the Koklass in the wild in the northern Pakistan area (WPA
Project 86) appears to suggest that, provided sufficient forest is left (and, of
course, the birds not molested) this species might adapt to living fairly close
to human habitation. A good deal of space is devoted to the calls of the
Koklass, but a reader of the phonetic renderings of these or most other bird
calls is not likely to be any the wiser; while the sonagrams indicate the pattern
and volume, only a recording can give an accurate rendering of any call.
A census of captive pheasants, junglefowl and peafowl throughout the
world; a further study of the Crested Argus in Malaysia; an account of the
breeding of Crossoptilon crossoptilon in the Jersey Wildlife Park; a paper on
the aviculturally little known wood quail (12 or 14 species) of the genus
Odontophorus; more news of the re-introduction of Cheer Pheasants into

BREEDING THE SCARLET COCK-OF-THE-ROCK
AT HOUSTON ZOO
By ROSEMARY LOW (New Barnet, Hertfordshire, England)
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.997684625" page_id="56283717"  page_num="" year="" vol="">
Prior to the 1970s it is doubtful whether any attempts were made to
breed Cocks-of-the-Rock in captivity. These birds were well-known to avi-
culturists, however, for several zoos exhibited single males, and they were
occasionally seen on the show bench.
There are two species, the Orange (Rupicola rupicola ), and the Scarlet
or Peruvian (R. peruviana). Males are vividly coloured, especially the male
Scarlet, with its plumage of shiny black, scarlet and grey and its striking
full crest. Females are a uniform rich reddish-brown. Length is about
36 cm (14 in).
The Scarlet Cock-of-the-Rock is found in Peru, Colombia, Ecuador,
Venezuela and Bolivia. It is renowned for its communal courtship displays.
Groups of males dance in a forest clearing, spreading their wings and
fanning their tails, before the watching females. Their nests are apparent-
ly constructed from mud and saliva and are usually positioned against a
ravine or cliff, usually near water.
All the captive breeding attempts which occurred during the 1970s
ended in failure. In Britain, in 1970, the pair belonging to Mr and Mrs K.
Scamell hatched a chick which survived for 23 days. In the USA, three
zoos, the Bronx (New York), Fort Worth and Washington, produced
chicks, none of which lived beyond three weeks.
Success was finally achieved in the first weeks of the new decade - at
Houston Zoo, in Texas. So many breeding successes are achieved only
after previous failure and much heartache - known only to those who are
closely involved in the project - and so it was at Houston.

R. LOW - BREEDING THE COCK OF THE ROCK
This story started in the summer of 1978 when a female was acquired
for the Zoo's single male. Had it not been for the Friends of Houston Zoo
who provided the necessary funds for the purchase, he would have
remained a bachelor, for the female's price was 1,000 dollars. After the
necessary period of quarantine the female was introduced into the rain-
forest exhibit where the male resided. Only three days later, on 26th
September, she started to construct a nest, using mud and palm fibre, in
a dark corner. A single, speckled, buff-coloured egg was laid on 23rd
November. After 30 days it was removed and found to be infertile.
In January the female laid again - another single egg. It hatched on 14th
February. The male was then removed from the enclosure. The female
proved to be a conscientious parent. She was seen feeding fruit and palm
tree berries to the chick and, on one occasion, a mouse. This was removed
by a keeper in case it contained poison.
As a substitute the female was offered an anole, a small lizard. This was
eagerly accepted and fed to the chick. As she had previously refused
crickets and mealworms, this was a pleasing development as some protein
was essential for the growing chick. However, it was far from easy to find
sufficient anoles during the cold weather of March, although everyone in
the Zoo was alerted to catch these lizards; the reptile department was also
able to supply some. Although the female accepted dog chow, fruit and
commercially prepared food, she obviously preferred the anoles.
By the time the chick was 26 days old the supply of these lizards had
declined, coinciding with weight loss in the chick. To monitor its growth,
it had been weighed daily. The decision was, therefore, made to remove
the chick from the nest on the 28th day. To the intense disappointment of
everyone concerned, the chick died during the night. Autopsy revealed
that bacterial enteritis, or inflammation of the intestine, was the cause
of death.
At the end of November 1979 the female laid two eggs. They hatched
on 25th and 26th December. She again proved to be a conscientious par-
ent, seldom leaving the nest. The chicks progressed well until the apparent-
ly critical age of three weeks, when their weight began to show fluctua-
tion. Intervention was then essential, but what was the best course of
action? Should the chicks be given supplementary feeding, should one be
removed from the nest or should both be taken?
The first alternative was rejected for fear of sating the chicks' appetites,
resulting in the female ceasing to feed them. The second was discarded as

it was felt that two chicks might stimulate each other to feed and the
third alternative was decided upon.
The chicks were removed from the nest on 15 th January and taken to
the home of the Curator of Birds, Robert J. Berry. Under his surveillance
night and day, they were fed hourly during the day, on a commercial
food, Zupreem , manufactured for birds of prey. This was mixed with cat
chow and offered in marble-sized balls. Alternative feeds consisted of
pieces of avocado and peeled, halved grapes. As the grape skin was not
being digested, this was not fed.
The eldest chick was then 21 days old and weighed 150 g; the maxi-
mum weight of the previous year&apos;s chick which had died at 28 days was
159 g. The eldest chick soon began to give great cause for concern. Tests
for salmonella proved positive. In spite of injections it was impossible to
control the infection and the chick died on 20th January aged 25 days.
More problems were ahead. Next day the second chick developed a
high temperature and rapid respiration. Despite treatment, it lost 40 g
in five days. Due to the intensive 24-hour care of Bob Berry and the
attention of the Zoo&apos;s veterinary surgeon, Dr. Harwell, it survived this
crisis.
Its diet had been changed gradually to consist mainly of cat chow,
chopped pink mice and blueberries, as grapes did not agree with it.
Feeding was still carried out at hourly intervals during the day.
No more problems were experienced and on 9th February, aged 46
days, the young Cock-of-the-Rock picked up two pieces of cat chow and
ate them. Three days later it left the bowl in which it was kept on its own
volition and made a 3 ft horizontal flight. By then it had acquired the
gutteral tones of the adult.
A few days later the mission to rear the first Cock-of-the-Rock in
captivity was accomplished and the young bird was returned to the Zoo.
In achieving this valuable success, the Curator of Birds acknowledges
the assistance of Trey Todd, supervisor of the tropical bird house, and
keepers Chelle Plasse and Scott McKnight.
Multiple successes have occurred with a number of softbills at Houston.

Results with Touracos, for example, have been exceptional and unprece-
dented in any other collection. Breeding pairs of eight species, including
Grey, Schalow's, White-cheeked, Red-crested and White-crested, are kept
and all eight species have reared young. This was finally achieved last
Christmas with the fledging of a Ross's Touraco, Musophaga rossae. In
addition, some Touracos have been reared to several generations.
Another world first breeding at Houston Zoo was the rearing in 1978
of a Red Bird of Paradise, Paradisea rubra. Other notable successes
include Toucans, Hyacinthine Macaws, King Vultures, rare cracids such
as the Nocturnal Curassow, and Brown Pelicans.
Here the emphasis is very much on consistent results, for multiple
generation breedings of a few species, rather than isolated successes with
a number, are the only way to achieve significant results.

Greater Hill Mynahs have been popular cage birds since the 1940s
(Bates and Busenbark, 1966) though importation has been the primary
means of acquisition because of their general reluctance to breed in cap-
tivity. Considering the greater restrictions on importation, these obser-
vations of their nesting behaviour may be useful to others who wish to
propagate this species.
The Van Saun Park Zoo is a small facility (3 acres) located in north-
eastern New Jersey. Many of the exhibits are seasonal with delicate ani-
mals held in off-display areas during the cooler weather (October-May).
The birds in this study bred during the off-exhibit season when they were
not exposed to the public.
Over a period of several years the Van Saun Park Zoo had acquired
five Greater Hill Mynahs. The origins, ages and sexes were unknown as
most of them had been donated to the Zoo as unwanted pets. The group
of birds was housed in an indoor enclosure measuring 4 feet by 4 feet by
4 feet, made of a wooden frame and 14-inch hardware cloth. Several nat-
ural branch perches and a nest box measuring 12" by 8" by 13" deep with
a 414" hole 7" from the bottom were provided. The area received natural
daylight augmented by fluorescent lighting that was turned on during the
working hours (8.00 a.m. to 5.00 p.m.). Although there was a great deal
of exposure to keepers moving about the vicinity of the cage to take care
of other animals, perhaps the experience of human contact as pets pre-
vented the birds from being extremely disturbed by it.
The birds were maintained in good health on a daily diet of moistened
Gaines dog meal, Zu Preem Instant Feline diet, ground hard-boiled egg,
fresh fruits and vegetables and a multi-vitamin and mineral supplement
(Vitamycin). Live foods such as mealworms, crickets and newborn mice
were offered frequently and accepted with relish.
On March 17,1979, one bird, designated VS 125, its acquisition number,
was observed visiting the nest box, peering in and then crouching with
quivering wings and low vocalisations on a perch near the box. It would
then hop to a position immediately next to another bird, VS298, which

would preen it lightly around the head and neck. Birds in this group fre-
quently displaced one another on a perch, but were not observed to come
to rest in such close proximity. VS125 usually assumed a very erect pos-
ture when perched near VS298 who crouched slightly except when preen-
ing. At one time another bird flew up to investigate the box and was dri-
ven away immediately by VS 125. The nest investigating and preening by
the two birds occurred frequently throughout the day, and the following
day all the birds except for the assumed pair were moved to other quar-
ters.
A variety of nest material was offered including small twigs, straw and
pieces of string. Immediately after placing the material on the cage floor,
VS 125 began to carry twigs into the nest box. It would interrupt the nest
building occasionally to be preened by VS 298. On several occasions VS
298 visited the box and peered in, but did not enter. The nest building
activity by VS 125 continued for six days. During this time the other bird
sometimes manipulated some of the nest material, but did not place it in
the nest. A few days later though, both birds were seen carrying twigs to
the box with VS 298 entering the nest to arrange material brought up by
its mate. During this nest building period both birds were observed to
crouch and quiver before entering the box.
On 2nd April, 1979, the attending keeper checked the nest but found
that no eggs had been laid. Through the following week, VS 298 spent in-
creasing amounts of time in the nest box though VS 125 was also seen in
the nest. On 9th April, 1979, the nest was checked again and three pale
blue eggs, mottled with brown, were discovered. Although mating was not
seen, VS 125 was assumed to be the male and VS 298 the female, based
on the postures described by Bates and Busenbark, 1966. The eye and leg
colour differences described by Boosey (1957) were not obvious in our
birds.
During the incubation period we wished to ascertain quantitatively which
bird spent more time incubating the eggs and began a system of spot
observations recording the time of day, which bird was in, which out of
the nest and comments on the circumstances of the observation. Eighty-
nine observations were made: in 46 (52%) VS 298 was alone in the nest;
in 17 (19%) VS 125 was in the nest; in 26 (29%) both birds were out,
usually when disturbed or when food was presented. In no instance were
both birds seen in the nest together, nor was food carried to the incuba-
ting bird by its partner.

The first hatching occurred on 20th April 1979, 18 days after the first
egg was probably laid. A cleanly-broken shell was found on the cage floor.
The second egg shell was thrown out of the nest on 23rd April. The
third egg did not hatch, and was presumed to have been eaten by the
birds. Greater quantities of live food, mealworms, crickets and newborn
mice were offered several times daily as soon as the hatching was discov-
ered, and both parent birds took turns carrying food to the chicks.
Usually a food item was mashed against the perch before being brought
into the nest for the young birds.
Fledging occurred at approximately 30 days, though the young birds
continued to receive food from the parents and gradually began to find
food for themselves. When the youngsters were obviously self-reliant, they
were removed from the parents' enclosure. They had almost reached adult
size, and differed mainly in the colour and size of the wattles which app-
eared pale and small compared to those of the adults. At one year of age,
they still were not as fully developed as those of the adults.
Shortly after the young birds were removed, the parents made another
attempt to nest. No new material was added to the nestbox, but three eggs
were laid. This time the parents seemed less attentive to the incubation,
and after 20 days the eggs were found broken on the cage floor. Presence
of a large amount of yolk indicated that they had not developed and were
probably not fertile. Within a few days after this failed attempt, both par-
ents moulted and lost interest in the nest.
On 11th October 1979, VS 298 died suddenly of liver and intestinal
ailments. Sex was determined conclusively as a female at the post mortem.
This confirmed assumptions that most of the nest building was performed
by the male and that most of the incubation was done by the female.
A new, sturdier nest box measuring 8" by 8" by 12" deep with a 3"
hole, 5" from the bottom, was placed in the cage with VS 125 and three
other adult birds, including one new to the collection, were introduced
with the hope of another pair forming with this now certain male. Instead,
within a few days, frequent conflict was observed between that bird and
another, VS 399. Also, VS 399 was seen in close proximity to VS 294,
carrying out the postures and preening similar to those seen in the first
pair.
The same procedure was followed with this new pair. After two unsuc-
cessful attempts, a clutch of three eggs was laid and two young hatched.

The third egg was thrown out of the nest about a week later. When the
attending keeper checked the nest again, 13 days later, only one chick
remained. The other apparently had been consumed by the parent birds.
This remaining chick was raised to fledging in 30 days as before.

Many zoos and private aviculturists keep cranes which are rendered
flightless through pinioning, tenectomy, or wing clipping. The high inci-
dence of infertile eggs in many captive cranes suggest that these proced-
ures may have a detrimental effect on fertility. Other reasons for infertile
eggs may be the absence of copulation due to incompatible pairs, inter-
ruption of precopulatory behaviour by people or other animals, and im-
proper sexing of the "pair".
In an effort to increase fertility some crane breeding centres, notably
the Patuxent Wildlife Research Center and the International Crane Foun-
dation, have implemented artificial insemination (AI) as a propagation
tool. Many of the problems which produce infertile eggs can be overcome
by using AI. Artificial insemination is practiced at I.C.F. for a variety of
reasons, prominent among these are the following situations:
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.9962944" page_id="56283726"  page_num="10" year="" vol="">
(1) Individuals of a pair are incompatible because of behavioural
problems and must be kept separated;
(2) There is a shortage of unrelated sexually mature males;
(3) Breeding-age males are unable to copulate due to pinioning
or other anatomical disabilities;
(4) Birds are sexually imprinted on humans and will not form
pair bonds with other cranes ;
(5) A pair is physically capable of breeding but does not copulate
due to one or more of a variety of inhibiting factors;
(6) New bloodlines are desired to improve the genetic variability

The technique of AI through the massage method has been described in
other publications (Gee, 1969, Archibald, 1974, and Gee and Temple, 1978)

attempt AI when applicable. AI is as much an art as a science but it is not
difficult to learn. The methods used vary somewhat between individual
people and individual birds.
Handling
The capturing and handling of the bird requires a concentrated effort
to prevent injuries to both the bird and the aviculturist. In several years of
AI at the Foundation there has never been a fatality or serious injury dur-
ing this process. Normally the bird is herded by two or three people into a
corner which has been lined with conifers to act as padding. The bird is
then grabbed gently by the neck just below the head and by one wing. It
is important to protect both yourself and the bird's neck from being
struck by their flailing feet and sharp nails. The bird is immediately placed
head first between the holder's legs. The bird's head can be released and
the bird held firmly pressed against the holder's thighs. Normally the bird
will relax a little at this point but if it continues to struggle, a hood may be
placed over the bird's head.

Semen Collection
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999870333333334" page_id="56283727"  page_num="11" year="" vol="">
Three people are usually involved in semen collection although two
people can do the job satisfactorily. The person holding the bird is the
"stroker" whose job it is to restrain the bird while stroking the bird's
thighs. The wings are allowed to remain free and should not be held be-
tween the stroker's legs. The arms are placed behind the wings with the
forearms pressing the bird forward against the stroker's legs. The massage
usually begins as an up-and-down motion on the birds' sides, moving down
to the inside of the thighs where the up-and-down strokes are continued.
Normally the bird responds by raising its tail, contracting the cloaca
repeatedly, and often purring or clucking.
The second person involved is the "teaser" who squeezes the cloaca in a
milking action which results in the ejaculation of a small quantity of sem-
en. This usually occurs within a few second but some birds may take long-
er. Various methods can be employed but our preferred method is for the
teaser to stand on the right side facing the opposite direction of the bird.
Placing the right hand around and above the cloaca, the thumb is at the
right side of the cloaca and the fingers are at the left side. The heel of the
right hand helps to hold up the bird's tail pushing it over the bird's back.
The left hand is placed under the cloaca, first stroking the abdomen a few
times. The thumb of the left hand is then placed above the cloaca while
the fingers are below the cloaca and pressure is applied in unison with the

thumb and fingers of the right hand. This method results in a milking ac
tion from all four directions around the cloaca. In some techniques the
left hand would be used to manipulate the cloaca while the right hand
would hold the shot glass or eye cup for collecting. We use a third person
to hold the small shot glass at the base of the cloaca to catch the ejaculate.
Very small samples may have to be scraped off the cloaca onto the rim of
the glass.

It is important to avoid contamination of the semen with urates during
the collection. It helps to walk the bird and hestitate before capture to
encourage the bird to defecate before handling. If the glass becomes con-
taminated during the collection a second shot glass may often be substitu-
ted quickly enough to catch a clean semen sample. Uncontaminated semen
is translucent with a slight frosty appearance. Normally only a few drops
will be ejaculated measuring from about .01 ml to 0.3 ml. If the ejaculate
is milky and of large volume it is probably contaminated with urates.
Because urates will kill sperm in a very short time a contaminated sample
will greatly reduce the fertilising capability of the insemination.
Once collected in the glass, the semen is drawn into a 1 cc tuberculin
syringe for measuring and subsequent insemination. If the semen is to be
extended, a known amount of extender is deposited into the glass and
drawn into the same syringe containing the semen. The sample is generally
diluted enough to give an insemination volume of about .2 ml. Samples
larger than 1.5 ml are not diluted unless they are to be split.
Extender
Several semen extenders are available that can be used with cranes
successfully. Patuxent uses Beltsville Poultry Semen Extender while IGF
uses Minnesota Turkey Semen Extender sold by the Minnesota Turkey
Growers Association. The use of a semen extender is advantageous when
very small samples of semen are collected and when a sample is to be split
for inseminating more than one bird or to be frozen for future use. In the
absence of a commercial extender a physiological saline solution can be
used for fresh inseminations.
Insemination of the Female
The actual insemination of semen can be the most difficult part of AI
in cranes. While cloaca! inseminations can give satisfactory results, placing
the semen directly into the oviduct is preferred. At IGF an effort is made
to accomplish mtrawaginai inseminations at all times. A female in breeding
condition that has laid eggs in the past or is currently laying is the easiest
to inseminate. A female not in breeding condition which has not laid
before is very difficult to inseminate properly.
A reddening and enlargement of the opening into the oviduct is
normally a reliable indication of breeding condition in the female crane. A
relaxation of the cloaca and widening of the pubic bones often
accompanies the onset of breeding condition.

C. LARUE - INCREASING FERTILITY OF CRANE EGGS
The insemination of cranes at IGF follows the same pattern as semen
collection with only a few differences. The bird is caught and held in the
same manner as that described for the male. The female is usually stroked
on the back and sides just posterior to the wings instead of the thighs.
The same responses of tail raising, cloaca! contractions, and purring or
clucking are normally elicited during the massage. In many birds, the
oviduct is everted briefly and appears as a small bright pink opening,
surrounded by spongy tissue, located at the upper left quadrant of the
cloaca. In most birds it is necessary to gently pull the cloacal lips apart
wider in an effort to expose the oviduct. This manipulation is usually done
by the teaser while the third person inserts the syringe once the oviduct
is located.
After locating the oviduct the syringe is gently pushed in 1-5 cms
and the semen is deposited slowly. This allows the oviduct time to accept
and draw in deeper the contents of the syringe. Injecting the semen too
quickly will result in some loss of semen. When the insemination is com-
pleted the syringe is withdrawn slowly to prevent pulling the semen out
with the syringe. The bird is released quickly and gently to reduce the
possibility of expelling semen.
With the 1 cc tuberculin syringe there is generally about .04 ml semen
left in the nose of the syringe after insemination, this is another reason for
using extender with small samples. The remaining semen is sufficient for
microscopic examination for sperm cell concentration and motility. These
samples can be taken to the laboratory and examined an hour or two after
collection if the samples are stored at about 5*C and are not heavily con-
taminated by urates. Best results are obtained by examining samples im-
mediately after collection with a microscope in the field at 43OX.
Frequency of Inseminations
Generally it is accepted that the higher the frequency of inseminations
the higher the fertility rate. However, it is also true that the timing of each
insemination is extremely important. Inseminations done three times a
week and on days an egg is laid, a few hours after laying, should give good
fertility. Currently at ICF we do AI every other day early in the morning
and on days eggs are laid.
Summary
Artificial insemination can help improve fertility in many situations.
The procedures are not overly complicated and can be learned in a short
time through practice. A basic knowledge of AI techniques can be acqui-

SOME NOTES ON KEEPING CORDON-BLEUS
By DEREK GOODWIN (Heme Hill, London)
Introduction
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.98965" page_id="56283732"  page_num="16" year="" vol="">
I find I have now been keeping blue waxbills or cordon-bleus, of
one or more species, for over 21 years. It is an awesome reminder of how
time seems to go faster as one gets older, for it seems to me hardly cred-
ible that I have kept these birds for more years than, in my younger days,
I kept pigeons or jays but so it is. I started off with Uraeginthus angolensis,
the Cordon-bleu of most bird books, the Blue Waxbill of South African
bird books and the Blue-breasted Waxbill of English aviculturists. Of these
I purchased three pairs in October 1958. I had not intended to, having
meant oply to buy a pair of Diamond Doves and perhaps a few hardy small
passerines to go in the small spare room that I intended to turn into a bird
room. However, blue always enchants me, whether in a flower, a bird or
anything else, and when I saw a big cage full of Blue-breasted Waxbills I
could not resist them and have never regretted succumbing to the tempta-
tion of their beauty. I subsequently, indeed before I had kept them very
long, wrote an article about these birds for our Magazine (Goodwin, 1959,
Vol. 65, p J49).
In 1961 I added Blue-headed Cordon-bleus or Blue-headed Waxbills,
U. cyanocephala, to my stock. This is the bird for which, in comparatively
recent times, ornithologists have coined the misleading name 'Blue-capped
Cordon-bleu'. I had been chary of getting Red-cheeked Cordon-bleus, U.
bengalus, the Cordon-bleu of the avicultural world, having heard and
read much about their delicacy, but the desire to study all three species of
the group induced me, in 1962, to do so. I did indeed have some trouble
before I managed to buy any that were not already ill (and all that were
soon died despite my efforts) but at length got some that lived and found
them henceforth little or no more trouble than the others.
Shortage of space and perhaps also the even greater beauty of the other
two species, led to my letting the numbers of angolensis sink to the point
of no return and so for many years now I have had only the Red-cheeked
and Blue-headed species. Now (December 1979) my stock has dwindled
to only two Red-cheeked and six Blue-headed.
Probably most readers will know what these birds look like but as I
myself find it intensely irritating if I pick up an article on a bird that I do
not know and in which it is not described, I will just give a quick descrip-
tion of their major features here. The (bird book) Cordon-bleu or Blue

breasted Waxbill is a trim little bird about one third smaller than the fami-
liar Zebra Finch, with a proportionately longer tail, which is triangle-
shaped when spread. The face, breast and flanks are light blue, the centre
of the lower breast and belly pinkish buff. The upper parts, except for the
blue rump and duller blue tail are light greyish brown. The bill is a steely
mauvish grey but turns reddish purple very quickly after death, hence I
suspect, the reason that some collectors have recorded bill colour of their
specimens as red or purple. My birds were all of the nominate race, in
which the sexes can be distinguished by the female having little or no blue
on her flanks. In some races of angolensis the female has almost as much
blue as the male.
The Red-cheeked Cordon-bleu is very similar but is slightly slimmer and
longer tailed and the brown of its upper parts is (in most races) a little
more reddish in hue. The male has a conspicuous dark red patch on the
side of his face. The female lacks the red and her blue areas are less bright
and less extensive. Many different races or subspecies are found in differ-
ent parts of tropical Africa. The differences shown by the males of differ-
ent races are mostly trifling ones of size and the precise shade of brown on
the upperparts but the females of some races are more distinct, varying (in
some cases) markedly in the amount, distribution and shade of the blue on
their faces, breasts and flanks. The bill of this species is mainly pink or
mauvish pink,

These two Cordon-bleus, angolensis and bengalus , are sometimes trea-
ted as forms of a single species but this, I believe, is incorrect. They are
closely related but some of their calls differ and, even in captivity, the
males distinguish between the very similarly coloured females, usually
showing sexual responses (if hense of both species are available) only to
hens of their own kind, while females of bengalus show an innate response
to the red facial marks of their own males (Goodwin 1965,1972).
The Blue-headed Cordon-Bleu is a slightly larger bird than the other
two, has a rather rounder head and shorter-looking bill and tends to hold
itself more upright. The cock has the entire head blue as well as the upper
breast and flanks and is a redder brown above. His bill is pinkish red to
crimson red. The female is a much paler bird both in her blues and her
browns and she has less blue on her underparts than the females of the
other species usually have. She often has a little blue on her forehead and
just above her eyes but usually none elsewhere on her head. Her bill is
usually paler than the male's, often pink rather than red.

The young of all three species much resemble the adult females but are
paler and at first have shorter and black bills. Most of them can be sexed
at fledging as the young males usually have about as much blue as adult
females but most, though not all, young females have considerably less.
In a wild state all tend to be birds of more or less dry country but the
Blue-headed is more restricted to arid scrub and semi-desert than are the
other two. All are known to feed largely on grass seeds and termites but
they take seeds of some other plants and other small insects too. Probably
they also take some greenstuff in the form of the growing tips of grass
shoots. The Blue-breasted Waxbill or Cordon-bleu, U. angolensis , has re-
cently been studied in some detail (at least as regards its feeding and breed-
ing) in the wild by Dr. Skead. It was found to feed largely on the seeds of
a prostrate weed as well as on grass seeds and to feed its nestlings largely
on green seeds as well as on termites. All three Cordon-bleus seek food
mostly on the ground. They catch some insects in flight but they do not
cling and clamber among grass stems when feeding as to waxbills of the
genus Estrilda.
Beauty is in the eye of the beholder and, just as many birdwatchers
who enthuse wildly over the beauty of rarities like Hoopoes or Ospreys are
seemingly blind to and certainly unappreciative of the equal or greater
beauty of such common species as Black-headed Gulls, Bullfinches and
Woodpigeons, so all too many aviculturists seem unappreciative of birds
that are always to be had in plentiful supply at fairly low prices. Certainly
no profit will be made out of breeding Cordon-bleus of any species. Nor,
if my experience is anything to go by (and I have given away scores of
home-bred Cordon-bleus of all three species), are many aviculturists inter-
ested in perpetuating captive stocks of these lovely birds. Dr Butler, in his
famous book "Foreign Finches in Captivity" clearly thought it foolish of
anyone to bother to breed Red-cheeked Cordon-bleus when they might
use their time and aviary space to breed the more expensive Australian
estrildid finches. Another olden writer, Gedney, however, shared my en-
thusiasm for Cordon-bleus and wrote: "...I can confidently recommend
the Cordon Bleu ( U. bengalus) and my advice is do not be discouraged for
what has been done may be done again, and if other people have bred
these birds why should you not do the same? The experiment will not
prove a costly one . a pair may be bought for one-third of what has
to be paid for the Australian finches.(whose) bulky forms, gay colours
and rude self-assertion bear the stamp of vulgarity when compared with
the graceful outlines, delicate tintings and undemonstrative nature of
the lovely Cordon-bleu".

I can second all Gedney says, except his ideas as to the "undemonstra-
tive", "gentle" and "quiet" nature of the Cordon-bleus. Although they
are certainly less aggressive than many other species and several pairs can
be kept in a room or aviary without serious fighting, very often the impres-
sion sometimes given by these and other waxbills of gentleness and quiet-
ness is either because they are not fit or else because they are cowed by
the close enforced presence of larger and stronger birds, too often both
these causes are simultaneously involved.
Housing
My birds are housed in a small but very well lighted room, it is about
8 feet by 8 feet (though not perfectly square) and I should think about
8 Vi feet high. It is warmed by an electric heater which is kept going con-
stantly from about mid-October to late April but is put on during periods
of colder weather at other times. I must confess to being very unscientific
in that for many years I did not get around to using a thermometer but
"played it by ear" or rather by eye and skin. If the birds looked chilly,
I turned the heater up a bit. Now I have a thermometer and do not let
the temperature go below 65* Fahrenheit but I still go more by the look
of the birds. In winter the light goes on at between 4 and 5 a.m., so that
the birds get at least a 12-hour day or a bit over, a Venerette time switch
has now served me well for a great many years but before I had it I used
to wake to put the light on and, if I did not some of the birds would start
to call in the darkness. When I am at home I usually put the light on in the
bird room much of the time on dull or very overcast days but if I am not
at home I fix it so that it remains on from dawn until about 11 a.m., ex-
cept in settled spells of fine weather.
Whilst there may be a danger (but not much I think) in giving the birds
too long a day, I am sure there is a much greater one of giving them too
short a day. I find Cordon-bleus, and other waxbills I have kept, when
awakened by the light going on, always greet their mates, often fight a bit
with enemies, fly about, and preen for at least five or ten minutes before
showing any inclination to fly down and feed. If birds, the moment they
are awake, start feeding eagerly that, in my opinion, is a clear sign that the
(necessarily) foodless night has been too long and their light should be put
on at least an hour earlier, and "the same again" until they are no longer
flying straight down to feed on awakening. Of course, as all avid readers of
old copies of our Magazine will know, earlier generations of aviculturists,
prior to electric light (which surely ranks, with field glasses and hot water
bottles, as one of the few boons of civilisation with no built-in drawbacks),
coped by fixing small lights to illuminate the food at night but this me-

thod, useful in its day, is not to be recommended if the illumination of
the entire room or aviary by electricity is possible.
The top quarter of the south-facing window is covered with wire mesh
and several perches placed so that the birds can perch in the sun. From
about early October to mid-May, however, the wire mesh is covered with
two thicknesses of towelling.
The room is fitted up with twiggy branches round the walls, and also
two or three thicker horizontal branches, so as to give a variety of perches.
All three species of Cordon-bleus have bred successfully and repeatedly,
although, of course, in such relatively restricted quarters by no means
every nest has been successful. Undoubtedly the ideal would be one pair of
Cordon-bleus in a room or aviary by themselves but, like many other bird
keepers, I have had to make do with the best feasible rather than being
able to achieve the ideal. Outdoor aviaries are good in theory and Cordon-
bleus and other waxbills will often do very well in them - if not put off by
larger and stronger birds sharing the space - during hot summers. However,
apart from the evil effects of sudden cold or wet spells (both of which may
come any day in Britain), the owner of an outdoor aviary is likely to be
plagued by visits from rats, cats, Tawny Owls, Sparrowhawks and other
predators which, even if they cannot reach the birds, may cause havoc by
disturbing them.
Indeed, so far as waxbills are concerned I think an outdoor aviary is
only really desirable if it has a roomy and well lighted shelter attached,
through the large door(s) of which the birds can easily be driven to be
shut in for the night and during inclement weather. I must admit, however,
that this is based on past experience with other kinds of birds in outdoor
aviaries and on the fact that few of the people I know who have kept wax-
bills in outside aviaries seem to have been very successful in breeding them
- except in the unprecedentedly long hot summer of 1976. At my present
home I have never ventured on an outdoor aviary of any sort because the
local abundance of cats is such that it would be foredoomed to failure.
Nesting and Parent/Young Behaviour
When I wish to let my Ghrdon-bleus breed (usually from mid-May to
late September, when at least some wild foods are available), I fix nesting
baskets around the walls of the room and supply nesting materials. The
baskets I use are ones with a large side entrance, rather like imitation nests
of weavers of the genus Euplectes. I use the largest size available for "for-

eign finches" as this gives the birds scope to build a normal nest within it.
All three species will readily build nests in the branches, as they do when
wild, but under captive conditions (unless one has the ideal situation of
only one pair in a bird room or aviary) such nests are almost certain to be
destroyed during incubation by other birds pulling material from them to
build or display with. If any of my birds begin to build a nest among the
twigs, I destroy its first beginnings and fasten a basket in the site with the
entrance facing the point at which the birds approached their nest-to-be.
It is always accepted and the nest built inside it.
Cordon-bleus are not very fussy about nesting material and will accept
grass stems and blades, asparagus fronds, coconut or other fibres, fibrous
roots and, for the lining, white or pale-coloured feathers of gulls, water-
waterfowl, pigeons or other largish birds and soft grass panicles. The one
essential is that every piece of material must have a rigid or near rigid end
for the bird to carry it by. Like most other African waxbills, the Cordon-
Cordon-bleus never "bundle" nesting material but always carry a piece at a
time, held by its rigid end (or by some firm kink or projection elsewhere).
Thus a grass blade without a piece of fairly rigid stalk attached, the webb-
webbing of the most (otherwise) desirable large white body feather re-
removed from its shaft, and anything in the nature of down, wool, etc., is
of nc use to them.
When built in the branches the nests of all the Cordon-bleus are more
or less oval or rounded with a side entrance hole. This latter may have a bit
of a "porch" of projecting stems but never has a long entrance tube like
those of most of the typical waxbills of the genus Estrilda. No "cock nest"
is built on top or alongside it and although nest-lining material is carried in
after incubation has started, no more work is then done on the main struc-
ture of the nest and no attempt is made to repair any damage done to it.
Most of the building of the main part of the nest is done by the cock, who
also finds and carried to the site virtually all of the material. Both sexes,
however, bring feathers or (less often if feathers are available) soft grass
panicles or asparagus fronds to line the nest. I found that nests of the
Cordon-bleu or Blue-breasted Waxbill that I examined later, always con-
tained considerably more feathers than did those of Red-cheeked or Blue-
headed Cordon-bleus but I am doubtful how far this would hold good for
wild birds' nests throughout the range of the three species. It has been sta-
ted that in parts of its range the Red-cheeked Cordon-bleu does not use
feathers to line its nest. This may be due either to different night tempera-
tures in different parts of the species enormous range or simply to feathers
not being available in some places. On the other hand it may be a false
impression due to the different stages at which nests have been examined .

I have found that my birds (of all three species) are most eager to take
feathers to the nest from a few days before hatching until the young are
a few days old. As has been suggested by some German ornithologists, it
is likely that one function of the feathers is to make the begging mouth of
the young bird more easily visible by reflected light. I have, however,
noticed that, at and shortly after the hatching of the young, one or more
large feathers are usually placed so as partly to screen the nest entrance.
Possibly this deters or misleads some potential predators. The same may be
true of the filmy-looking down on the heads of the young. Sir Colling-
wood Ingram many years ago suggested that the function of such nestling
down might be to camouflage the nest contents. I think he is right as, even
knowing that a Cordon-bleu's nest contained young, I have sometimes
been momentarily misled by the filmy blur into thinking I was looking at
some mildew-like growth in a deserted nest, when I have peered into a nest
with young nearly ready to fledge.
The clutch consists of four to six, most commonly five eggs. They
are laid in the early morning at daily intervals. Both sexes incubate (and
later brood the nestlings) in turn by day, usually sitting for about an hour
at a time, but only the hen spends the night inside the nest. The young
fledge at 17 or 18 days old and if healthy can fly when they first leave the
nest. In a bird room or aviary they are at first clumsy and crash into walls,
wire or windows but this is mainly due to their having to learn the limi-
tations of their un-natural environment. Both parents feed the flying
young but if, as often happens, the pair goes to nest again immediately,
then the hen stops feeding her fledgelings when or shortly before she be-
gins to lay. The cock then takes the double task (but, of course, for the
bird it is rather a double pleasure) of taking his turn to incubate the new
clutch and feeding the young of the former brood.
As with many other birds, the parents appear to learn to recognise
their young individually at fledging time. Probably this is both a result and
a function of the intense emotional involvement with the young at this
time. When the young bird first flies from the nest, the parents, who have
been answering its frequent contact calls during the period when it was
looking out of the nest entrance, working itself up to "take the plunge"
(if such a simile for its usually wpward first flight is permissible), at once
fly to it and, if it has landed on or (as a result of flying into the wall) falls
to the floor of the room, attempt to entice it up into the branches. They
do this by repeatedly flying down to the young one, uttering alarm or con-
tact calls (according to how worked-up they are), and flying back up into

the branches. Until the young can fly really well and are "quite at home"
in the room, their parents are never at ease unless they are either perched
high up well above my head when I enter the room or are out of sight in
cover.
Birds with fledged young do not normally (never in my experience)
feed other young even of the same age as their own. If, as often happens
within the confines of my bird room, these beg from them they are re-
pulsed. Some writers on bird behaviour (who can have had little first hand
experience of it) often write as if all parent birds respond blindly to the
stimulus of a begging young one and thus attempt to explain the rare cases
where wild fledgelings are observed being fed by parents not their own,
sometimes indeed of other species. So far as cordon-bleus (and other birds
that I have kept) are concerned, it is true that when dealing with young
still inside the nest, the parent does appear to react simply to the stimuli
of appropriate calls and begging postures (sometimes even to rather nzap-
propriate ones, as some birds will accept nestlings of other species and
different appearance if these are placed among their own) the case is very
different once the young have left the nest. Adult cordon-bleus (and at
least some other birds) will, in captivity, frequently "adopt" one or more
fledgelings belonging to another pair, under certain conditions. Such adop-
tion is almost sure to occur when an unpaired individual, either cock or
hen is "in love" with one of the parents of the young in question. It also
happens quite often if a pair or one member of a pair have/has been frus-
trated in their/its attempts to breed. I have no doubt that the latter type
of situation, especially when its own young have been killed by a predator,
is the usual reason for such "adoptions" as occur in the wild.
Young Cordon-bleus beg in the typical crouched, neck twisted estrildid
manner which will be familiar to anyone who has watched young Zebra
Finches and which I have described previously in our Magazine. They very
quickly learn to beg only to their own parents, through being at best ig-
nored and at worst sharply pecked when they do not do so. They are,
however, quick to recognise the friendly approach of any would-be adop-
adopter, even if it is of a species, such as the Avadavat, Amandava aman-
dava, very different in appearance from their own parents. Some-
times, but not very often, well grown but not yet fully independent
young will feed younger fledgelings, but only in a very "half-hearted" and
rather ineffective manner. Incidentally, although the mouth patterns of
the young of all three species are similar, fledgelings of the Blue-headed
Cordon-bleu lack the blue or violet gape tubercles of the other two species
and their begging calls are different in sound. All three species will, how-

however, readily rear mixed broods, containing both cyanocephala and
angolensis , or bengalus , and show no discrimination either before or after
they leave the nest.
Feeding
Some Victorian aviculturists, as those who, like myself, delight in
browsing through early issues of our Magazine will know, thought that
neither their children nor their tropical birds should be "pampered". What
is even more surprising than that they should have believed that freezing
temperatures, long dark winter nights and a plain diet of dry seeds were
good for tiny tropical birds is that some of the latter actually appear to
have thriven under such regimes. I suspect, however, that more was written
about a few survivors than about multitudes that perished of cold and
malnutrition. Some of the advice one gets even today in English writings
on the care of waxbills suggest that such ideas are not entirely eradicated.
German works or at least most that I have read, go to the other and better
extreme and are apt to recommend diets and standards of care that are
likely to be beyond the means of any person who is not possessed of both
great wealth and a great deal of spare time.
I give panicum millet in a large tray on the floor, Haith's foreign finch
tonic food (a mixture of many seeds and some powdery matter, not a
great deal of it is eaten but some is and the birds invariably pick a lot
among it) and white millet. These are placed separately on clean parts of
the floor. Until about ten years ago I always gave some canary seed and
Japanese millet also but the latter seed is among those in the foreign finch
tonic mixture and very little canary seed is eaten. I still give it most of the
time (in small quantities) but do not bother if I temporarily run out of it.
In terms of amount consumed the panicum and white millet is taken in
much greater quantity than the other seeds. I have the impression that my
Blue-headed Cordon-bleus eat more white millet than do the Red-cheeked,
although the latter certainly take an appreciable amount of it. Seed treated
with cod liver oil or halibut liver oil is given once or twice a week at those
times of year when the birds do not have access to direct sunlight.
Eggfood, made by forcing a hard-boiled or rather "hard-simmered" egg
through a coffee strainer and then loosening up the result with a fork is
prepared every other day, half given to the waxbills and half put in the
fridge for next day. Not a lot of it is eaten but most of the birds, probably
all, eat some each day and the wild birds, especially Starlings and Black-
birds, eagerly take every morsel when the "unexpired portion" of the pre-
vious day's ration is put out for them. Milk sop is also given on most days.
Only a very little is eaten but the remainder feeds my whiteworm culture.

A handful or two of whiteworm culture (peat plus whiteworms) is
spread out on the floor every two or three days. Once the substrate begins
to dry out, the whiteworms ball together to maintain their moisture. The
birds are reluctant to pull individual worms from such clumps although
they will sometimes do so. If drying-up clumped whiteworms are "rescued'
' in time they can be resuscitated by putting them on top of the dish of
milk sop. If not too far gone they will soon separate out and can then be
returned to their culture, together with the milk sop.
Greenfood I give daily when possible but in winter they sometimes
only get it four or five times a week. Chickweed ( Stellaria media), Com-
mon Knotgrass ( Polygonum aviculare) and Annual Meadow Grass, ( Poa
annua) are prime favourites with Cordon-bleus, as with most other estrild-
ids that I have kept. The green or ripe seeds are principally eaten but pie-
ces of leaf of Chickweed and Knotgrass and the tips of Poa annua blades
are also often freely taken. Other grasses that are seeding or budding, other
species of chickweed and of knotgrass are also given when I can find them
and cannot find the three species cited above, but most of them seem to
be less relished than their relatives cited above. Turves of grass (with or
without other vegetatation) are given whenever available. Especially where
young grass has grown up in autumn and winter under trees after leaf-
shedding it is easy with a knife to dig up, or even at a pinch to kick up,
nice turves which waxbills delight in picking over. They eagerly take the
tips of growing shoots of young grass and other vegetation and also often
find some edible invertebrates. In winter and early spring, when greenstuff
may be hard to come by, I sow lawn grass seed in small shallow dishes and
give it to the birds when the shoots are about half an inch to an inch high.
After having been mangled about by the Cordon-bleus and other wax-
bills, much of the young grass will recover after a week or two and can be
used again. Young leaves and whole dug-up young plants of dandelions ,
nipplewort, clover, etc., are also given. As with other leaf greenstuff, they
are sometimes ignored but often one or more birds will eat some of the leaf
eagerly.
like many other birds, Cordon-bleus usually take pieces of leaf or
shoot by seizing a bit in the bill and tearing it off with a backward jerk. This
they cannot do if it is lying loose. Greenfood, other than fairly heavy
turves, should therefore always be pinned under a brick, clamped between
two bricks or otherwise firmly fastened so that the birds can pull against
resistance. Otherwise it is quite impossible for them to feed efficiently on
it. Greenfood for ground feeding birds should never be tied in bunches and

and these I also collect for my birds. Ant pupae are, perforce, collected
along with much of the nest substrate and some of the worker ants.
These latter are not eaten but are used by Avadavats and Goldbreasts
(Amandava amandava and A. subflava) for anting.
Other live food taken by captive cordon-bleus include small or smallish
smooth- skinned green caterpillars, small centipedes, tiny earthworms,
small smooth- bodied spiders and grasshoppers. The latter can sometimes
be obtained in quantity by "sweeping" grassland although I manage to get
around to doing this relatively seldom as it means taking a net and suitable
receptacles with me on weekend excursions into the country, when it is
usually better to concentrate on trying to fmd ants' nests. The other
items listed are (sometimes) obtainable from my tiny town garden. I put
infested birch branches, cabbage leaves, etc., into the bird room and also
the "top spit" of soil, plus seedlings, etc., from parts of the garden least
likely to have been much defecated by wild birds. As with green food, I
try to give a varied selection although in practice circumstances often
preclude this for longish periods.
As my Cordon-bleus are not tame enough to be fed individually, I
always scatter live food fairly widely on the floor and window ledges.
Especially in the case of ant pupae or larvae. These cause great excite-
ment, if the birds have not been glutted with them for some time. As
soon as they see what I have in my hands they begin to utter excited,
threatening calls ("getting ready to be angry with each other" as a
friend once said of similar reactions from gulls). As soon as the ant
pupae are put down, quarrelling and attempts to drive others away
from the food break out. If the ant pupae were put in a dish or in one
small area only the strongest and boldest individuals would get any.
Most seed-eating birds seem to need a considerable amount of mineral
matter in addition to their food. Besides the (now appallingly expen-
sive) commercial bird sand which I put on newspapers on the floor of
the room and on the window ledges (but only thickly on the latter), I
give ordinary salt (a few pinches scattered on the sand on the window
ledges), Haith's mineralised grit (a good handful each week or more
often on a clean part of the floor), a lump of cuttle bone, and crushed
eggshell. This last is prepared by heating eggshells (to sterilise them) and
then putting them, roughly crushed, between clean sheets of paper and
banging them with a hammer. When most has been pulverised but there
are still some larger bits among it, several finger pinches of it are placed
on the window ledges and floor. This seems to contain some elements

hung up. Only species that under natural conditions clamber and cling am-
ong growing grass or other vegetation can feed from a hanging clump of
greenfood and even they find difficulty. In this situation the waxbills of
the genus Estrilda are not switching their tails from side to side in pleas-
urable excitement as they hang on the swinging clump, as some bird-kee-
pers fondly imagine, they are doing it to try to keep their balance!
Soaked seed I only give occasionally to non-breeding birds. In theory I
am inclined to agree with German experts on estrildids who are mostly
adamant that soaked seed (in addition to very much else) must be supplied
ad lib to all species. In practice I must admit that, not having been able to
see any difference in the condition of my birds whether they were or were
not getting soaked seed, I tend not to bother with it except when the birds
have young. I have found that, contrary to the experience of some others
and to what is often recommended, the species of estrildids I have kept, in-
cluding those now discussed, prefer seed that has soaked only about 12 to
24 hours to seed which has soaked longer and whose "sprouts" (actually I
think the root tips) are clearly showing. Again contrary to what is often
stated, I find that Cordon-bleus (and other seed eating estrildids that I have
kept) do not take dry seeds only when forced to do so for lack of soaked
seed and/or of wild seeds in a green or semi-ripe state but, except some-
times when feeding young, always eat a quantity of dry seed when soaked
seed, wild seeds, and even such favoured live foods as greenfly and fresh
ant pupae, are available.
The only live food that I regularly give to my Cordon-bleus are home-
bred whiteworms ( Enchytreae ) as previously described. I do, however,
make every effort to give them other live food as often as possible. I coll-
ect pupae and larvae of the small ants, Lasius fuscus and L. niger , whenever
the opportunity occurs (usually only on some weekends between May and
September), and also (in plastic bags) any nettles, or other plants that I
come across that are heavily infested with greenfly. Birds are, incidentally,
sensitive to nettle stings which is no doubt why (until the ladybirds and
hover flies breed up to peak numbers) stinging nettles smothered in
greenfly may still be found in formidable amounts.When giving greenfly
from nettles I shake them off and beat them off by striking the nettles
together or brushing with a soft brush and take great care to pick up even
the smallest bit of nettle leaf from the bird room floor. A cordon-bleu or
other small bird that treads on nettle leaf shows every sign of acute pain
and is unwell for a little time. Probably if it were to sting its eyes or orbi-
tal region the result would be serious if not fatal. Poa annua and many
other grasses are also often infested with greenfly when in bud or flower

lacking in the other minerals supplied as if the birds, especially when
breeding, have had no eggshell for four or five days, they at once fly
down and eat it eagerly, even although they have had grit, cuttle bone
and sand ad lib.
When any of the birds have young, the above regime is augmented as
follows: Soaked seed (panicum millet, white millet and commercial grass
seed) is given daily; in small quantities several times daily if I am at home.
I make every effort to give as much wild live food, especially ant grubs and
pupae and/or greenfly as possible; if I am at home, live food (if available)
is given several times daily. Whiteworms are given six or seven times daily
if I am at home; if not, several heaps of whiteworm culture are put in
daily. I find that my Cordon-bleus will only relish soaked seed while it is
still moist, once it is dry it is usually ignored. When the birds have young
I also make great efforts to supply seeding greenfood (as previously cited)
and also turves, top spit garden earth and so on. However, rather to my
surprise, I have often had good broods of young reared, especially by Blue-
headed Cordon-bleus, at times when relatively few wild insects and not a
great deal of seeding grass, etc., could be obtained.
Endpiece
I had intended, when I started, to include information on displays
and also some discussion of other matters, but this article is already
overlong so it seems best to finish it here. In any case, I have discussed
voice and displays of the Cordon-bleus in previous papers.
I hope this will inspire other keepers and breeders of these beautiful
estrildids to write of their experiences and methods. There may yet be
time to establish stocks of Cordon-bleus, creatures which to my mind,
cheap, plentiful and therefore despised though they may now be, are
lovelier than many of the "valuable" Australian estrildids. And, if not
so easy to keep and breed as Zebra Finches, they are at least much
less costly and demanding to maintain than Gouldians would appear to
be (Ziegler).

ROTHSCHILD'S MYNAH Leucopsar rothschildi
AT JERSEY ZOOLOGICAL PARK
</sectionHeader>

By D.F. JEGGO (Deputy Curator of Birds)
This striking, almost completely white, member of the Sturnidae was
formerly more widespread over the Indonesian island of Bali; but today
the Rothschild's Mynah Leucopsar rothschildi is, by and large, confined to
the Barat reserve, where a current population of some 500 individuals sur-
vives.
In 1971 the Jersey Zoological Park obtained eight birds with a view to
establishing a self-sustaining population. Since then, in excess of one hun-
dred specimens have been successfully reared. They are housed in planted
outdoor aviaries, with unheated shelters, proving perfectly cold-hardy.
Only one breeding pair is accommodated per aviary, which they may share
with pheasants, usually Palawan Peacock Pheasants Polyplectron empha-
num. Although in a range situation, they never occupy adjacent aviaries as
fighting will occur through the wire, but are in sight and sound of others,
as this may help stimulate reproduction. Aviaries are not large, our most
successful measuring 7.5 x 2 x 1.15 m high. Receiving a diet of brown
bread crumbs, moistened with milk, a proprietary insectile mixture Sluis ,
minced heart and hard-boiled egg, a small amount of soaked dried fruit
and diced fresh fruit (grapes, banana and pear with halved apples and oran-
ges spiked on to nails), the feeds are sprinkled with a mineral and vitamin
powder, Vionate or Vitetrin. Mealworms and crickets are fed throughout
the year, the amount being increased during the breeding season (April -
October), especially when broods are in the nest.
There is little sexual dimorphism and both males and females perform
the characteristic bobbing display. However, males do tend to be slightly
bigger and bolder in appearance, and most diagnostic, their crests are long-
ger. Nest boxes are provided at the end of March. These are constructed
from 20 mm 04") plywood, measuring 24 x 24 cm square by 40 cm high.
A small entrance hole approximately 6 cm in diameter, is near the top of
the front, with a perch just below. An inspection hatch is incorporated in-
to the design. Invariably, nest building starts almost at once and an untidy
nest of hay, fine twigs, leaves and feathers is constructed. Clutch size varies
from 2 to 4 pale blue eggs, usually 3. Incubation takes 12-14 days from
the laying of the second egg. Steady and reliable pairs are remarkably tol-
erant to having their nests inspected, but new and uncertain pairs are left
entirely alone. The behaviour of the parents usually gives away the pres-

ence of young, as does egg shell on the aviary floor. When young are ex-
pected, we start to provide live food, which is taken up to the nest if there
are chicks to feed. Mainly mealworms, but some crickets are given seven
times a day between 08.00 and 19.00 hours, i.e. every two hours, a small
handful each time.
In general, fecundity has been excellent, but rarely have complete
broods been raised; exceptionally three or four have survived, but normal-
ly one or two succumb, leaving only one or two to fledge. Up to four
broods can be reared in a season by one pair. Chicks found to be lagging
behind have been taken out and it has proved relatively simple to handrear
these. The young fledge normally between twenty-five and twenty-eight
days, resembling adults, apart from their pale beak coloration, a paler hue
to the skin around the eye and the legs, a wash of grey on the crown and
mantle and only a rudimentary crest, assuming adult plumage in their
first year. Young are removed from the breeding aviaries usually five days
post-fledging, as pairs nest again remarkably quickly.
No special problems have been encountered in maintaining and breed-
ing this species. However, they do seem susceptible to parasitic infection,
notably to gape (Syngamus sp .) and tape ( Cestodea ) worms and coccidio-
sis. With their habit of foraging among the substrate of the aviaries, they
are prone to reinfection from invertebrate secondary hosts. Faeces are
screened twice a year, in October before the onset of harsher, stressful
climatic conditions, and in February, before the breeding season, followed
each time by routine treatment for coccidiosis and worms. Fatality in es-
tablished birds has been low, but quite large numbers, up to 50% in some
years, of chicks have been lost, the greater percentage while still in the
nest. Post mortem findings often reveal parasites as causative. We are now
experimenting with treatment of chicks while in the nest, but it is too
early to comment on results. While not wanting to interfere with any nat-
ural wastage, we feel the number raised could be increased. Indeed, in
1977, 79% of young hatched were reared.
A reserve of twenty specimens is maintained in the collection to ensure
as much as possible of the genetic variability contained in the foundation
stock is preserved, and the death of a single specimen does not constitute
a loss to our gene pool. Birds surplus to requirements are sent to other
potential breeders. Over 70 have been exported to 21 different collections
endeavouring to dispose of small groups of unrelated individuals in the
belief that new captive populations can best be established by this policy.

The birds are sold on remarkably reasonable terms so that dealers cannot
compete, making the illegal trade in wild-caught specimens economically
unviable.
Detailed records are kept on the birds' parentage, medical history,
behaviour and breeding performance. It is our aim to manage our popula-
tion so as to preserve its vigour and natural fitness to survive. To this end
we cannot consider our individual programme in isolation, it is vital that
all breeders of Rothschild's Mynahs co-operate. So often, though once
widespread in aviculture, a species has been grossly neglected and gone
into a sudden and rapid decline so that, in a short time, it has been allowed
to all but die out.
Today, there are almost certainly more Rothschild's Mynahs in capti-
vity than in the wild state. Perhaps no other endangered species presents
such potential for captive breeding to contribute significantly to aid its
conservation. The bird trade has been a major factor in the demise of this
species and still remains so; we hope this may soon ease. However, with
continued pressure on the remaining habitat, its future in the wild cannot
be assured. Aviculture must act responsibly to perpetuate this graceful
species in our aviaries so that, should the ^ild population become extinct,
there is at least a flourishing captive reservoir.

SOME SOURCES OF LIVE FOOD

By L. GIBSON (Burnaby, British Columbia, Canada)
The major problem in rearing softbills (and some other birds),
once they have nested, is the provision of sufficient suitable live foods for
the nestlings.
These notes apply mainly to cool temperate climates. People who are
fortunate enough to live in warm areas have access to a greater variety and
numbers of insects and, most important, they are available the year round.
In cooler climates, getting hold of any insects, especially early in the sea-
son, is in itself a problem, in addition to the sheer quantity required.
For a long time many people and institutions have relied rather heavily
on mealworms ( Tenehrio ). This is because they are relatively easy to rear,
and are among the least objectionable of creatures to culture, as they
neither smell nor readily escape. Not all birds use them, and many birds
acquire the taste. Chicks fed exclusively on mealworms invariably develop
rickets (Rachitis). However, I have had a number of healthy chicks raised
almost solely on mealworms, provided that at least a third of them are
smeared daily with soft margarine (the mealworms, that is, not the chicks).
Even so, a good variety of livefood is desirable, and supplying the huge
quantity required is often the hardest task of the critical period up until
the fledgelings are self-supporting on a prepared diet.
Beating bushes over a plastic sheet is a useful and well-known collection
method. It is rarely of help to me, except perhaps in September, when it is
usually too late to be of any use. This is because the natural flora of this
area is coniferous rain forest, with a consequent paucity of insects, both in
species and numbers, at least at ground level. The forest has only recently
been cut down in the city surrounds, and still covers most of the country-
side, so few alien insects have moved into the cleared areas.
In September large quantities of spiders appear. They have been there
all along, but only become big enough to be seen and collected in the au-
tumn. On a few occasions I have had softbills nesting late enough tqhnake
use of these spiders. Spiders stay alive for at least four weeks in a paper
bag in the fridge. All the birds love them.

L! GIBSON - SOME SOURCES OF LIVE FOOD
Grasshoppers are a useful food but are not found everywhere. When
located, they are best collected on a dull day, or just before dusk, if the
area is warm and dry. Under these conditions the creatures will be slow
enough to be captured easily, either by net or, with practice, by hand.
In cool areas of limited sunshine, as found locally, grasshoppers tend to
collect in dry sheltered areas, such as the bottom of south-facing slopes.
They will keep for up to three weeks in a well-ventilated cage, kept out-
side in a shaded area. Fresh herbage should be supplied every few days
and must not be allowed to become damp or rotten, as this quickly
causes the death of the insects. They will also keep alive for at least a
week and up to two weeks in the fridge. Use a dark container with some
ventilation.
Because grasshoppers become progressively larger as the summer
advances, this limits the number of bird species that can use them. Remov-
ing the large rear jumping legs of the insects makes them more acceptable
to some smaller birds. Fully grown grasshoppers are at least 1" (25 mm)
long.
Aphids have been ignored by most of my birds, except for waxbills.
Even then, the aphids are so small as to be of almost negligible value in
the raising of a brood. Gold-breastedWaxbills used aphids as additional
rearing food, but these were really incidental, and so I do not collect
them specifically.
Moths can often be collected in large numbers (along with other fly-
ing insects) by using a white sheet and a night light. Again this method is
not useful to me because of the paucity of lepidopterae in the area due to
the high rainfall.
Smooth caterpillars are among the most useful creatures, being accep-
ted as rearing food by most birds. You just have to be lucky to locate a
source, and people with oak woods nearby are luckier than most. Here I
am referring to European oaks which support a large variety of useful
caterpillars. I have no idea if the same applies to North American oaks.
There are scarcely any caterpillars locally except for occasional outbreaks
of 'tent-caterpillars' (Tussock moths), which are unacceptable to the
birds because of the irritating hairs covering the creatures. I can also get
reasonable numbers of alder sawfly larvae, but few birds will touch them.
Sawfly larvae are very distasteful to birds and even although a few of the
tougher birds eat them, I would not like to risk chicks being fed with

them in case they got sick. The older sawfly larvae are covered in a white
powder and they seem to be slightly more palatable when this is rubbed
off. The sawfly larvae that are such pests of gooseberry and currant bushes
are most distasteful, and I do not remember a bird trying more than one. I
have even seen Sticklebacks spit them out. The larvae appear to get more
distasteful as they get older, and may be eaten when very small. Ribes
bushes in an aviary are always kept clear of the pests. Possibly the birds get
the flies (which are also distasteful) before they propagate.
Water creatures are sometimes available in large numbers, even early in
the season. Dragonfly larvae, water beetles and freshwater shrimps are all
acceptable. Copsychus , for example, will eat all of these, and they are fond
of aquatic snails, which they gobble down, including the shell. These latter
are less stickly and objectionable than land snails, in which few birds show
any interest. Large pond snails should be cracked for the birds.
All these creatures can be collected by dredging a large mass of water-
weed and suspending it at the top of a bucket, half filled with water. The
animals will soon work their way down into the water, where they will
keep alive indefinitely (with some water weed), providing they are kept
cool. Pond water is best. Do not use chlorinated water straight from the
tap, or it may prove fatal to the collection. To avoid certain avian para-
sites, it is best to collect from ditches or small ponds, which do not have a
resident bird population. Actually I can get enough aquatic snails from
aquariums and a garden pond to keep my Copsychus in titbits the year
round. Parasites are a risk from any wild source of live food, but it is not
a great problem.
Pond creatures can be fed to the birds in a shallow dish, barely cover-
ing them with water. Some non-aquatic birds will even pick out fish fry
from a little dish. Use only fresh water fish. A large flat dish of water is a
good way in which to offer spiders, etc., which would otherwise quickly
escape from the aviary. Insects will float for a while until the birds pick
them off. Another way is to put food animals in a plastic pah with some
herbage on the bottom. This retains the creatures, and the birds quickly
learn to fly in and out. Escapees from the pah tend to run around the rim,
unth snapped up. A glass aquarium is also useful, as certain phototropic
creatures, like spiders, then have less of a tendency to try to escape out
towards the light source.
I have tried culturing an assortment of insects and ran into many prob-

lems. Maggot cultures are objectionable for obvious reasons, and there is a
risk of birds getting enteritis from bacteria that abound in the rotting
flesh. I never use them for chicks, and rarely offer them to adult birds.
Wax moth larvae are not too difficult to rear and they are a nice size
and consistency for chicks. They have proved to be persistent escapers
when kept in the dark. The only warm place in my house is dark, and is
ideal for rearing mealworms. The Wax moth larvae are very active when
newly hatched and can get through the finest mesh. The cultures must be
well ventilated, as must all cultures, or the substrate becomes moul-
dy . So there is no way of keeping the larvae contained in dark conditions.
I do not think they come out in the light, preferring to burrow in the bran,
but they may wander at night. I have not experimented with this, and gave
up on them, as more of them were outside than inside the containers when
kept in my dark furnace room. So many escaped once that a 40 gallon
water tank was completely covered in silk, spun by the larvae. For those
interested, the growth medium is made by boiling 100 ml of water, 100 ml
of glycerol and 100 ml of sugar. When cool, the mixture is well stirred into
1000-1200 ml of bran, a little at a time. Quantities need not be exact. The
original recipe called for vitamin drops, but I found that the larvae did just
as well without them.
Among the easiest creatures to rear are earthworms. These are not used
enough in aviculture. Chicks can be successfully reared almost solely on
worms. A remarkable number can be maintained in a small compost heap.
Simply add all organic kitchen waste to the heap, adding a layer of soil
now and then. Keep it moist and cool in hot weather, and cover it with
some jute sacking. The worms can be gathered from under the sacks, with
a minimum of disturbance, which is best for maximum production. It is
preferable that the heap is contained in a wooden frame, etc., as this
retains moisture and provides breeding areas (the worms like to burrow
alongside some solid cover) and it can be covered to keep out garden
birds. It also helps to retain some heat and prevents excessive freezing in
winter. The spot used should not be subject to flooding. Do not add man-
ure to the heap.
In some areas, Crane fly larvae (Tipula spp ) can be gathered. These
'leatheijackets' are an ideal food for birds that will take them. They tend
to collect in turf alongside a solid path, etc. Probably this is because of the
moisture retention of the stonework in summer, and also, in a small
garden this area is usually not walked on. Just peel the turf back from the
path edge and pick them out. They will keep for months in a bucket of

damp turf. Many worms can also be found along such edges.
It would be nice to have a source of live food that supported itself until
ready to be collected. With this in mind, I installed a beehive in the garden
particularly for an attempt at raising Chloropsis.
The bee larvae proved rather impractical to collect, and the hive was so
interesting that I had not the heart to use the inmates as bird food. I was
rewarded by a huge increase in the garden fruit crop, and 40 lb (18 kg) of
honey which was in part fed to the nectivorous birds. However, the bees
gave me an idea.
An insect that can be found just about everywhere is the common
wasp (Vespula spp). The larvae will keep for up to two weeks in the fridge,
and the pupae will last for six weeks or more. They are conveniently pack-
aged naturally in the paper combs, and these can be refrigerated in paper
bags until required. Paper bags provide suitable ventilation and keep the
combs dry. Plastic bags retain too much moisture, which allows the growth
of moulds.
Collection becomes easier after some practice and a few stings. Free
hanging nests are the easiest to deal with. Nests that are attached to a
beam, etc., by more than the top stem are best left until you are more
practised. Collection equipment consists of a large plastic bag, a bread
knife, gloves and some acetone and tissues. Nail polish remover can be
used, as this is acetone. Amateurs are advised to have a hat and a veil, espe-
cially if the nest is not easily accessible.
The best places to seek nests are in old barns and the like. Nests are best
collected in the dark when the insects have stopped flying. Approach
quickly and silently. A ladder, if used, should be placed very gently. Once
the approach is made it is safer to proceed than to retreat, as the angry
insects will even fly at night when disturbed. A piece of tissue is soaked in
acetone and put in the plastic bag, which should be large enough to drop
the nest into. A small piece of acetone-soaked tissue is then pushed into
the nest entrance. At night there are usually four guards sitting just inside,
so the plug must be pushed in without any hesitation. The acetone imm-
ediately affects the wasps, and their main intention is to get away from it.
lift the plastic bag up around the nest and quickly slice the holding stem
and drop the nest into the bag. Close it for at least half an hour. The wasps

depths of the nest. The larvae and pupae are unaffected by the acetone
which soon evaporates off when the combs are removed from the bag.
Later, with conservation in mind (and a little sympathy) I took nests in
the daylight and immediately after bagging them, left the bag open in the
field. Acetone was only used for the entrance plug. A smart retreat was
followed by a five-minute wait, during which most of the wasps escaped. It
is not only the escape of the queens that counts, for I have seen several
nests rebuilt on the remains by escapees and latecomers who were out at
the time of collection.
Remove the outer paper cover of the nest and separate the combs.
Store until needed. The innermost circles of cells are the first to be built,
of course, so they usually contain more pupae. The adult larvae occupy
the next few concentric rings and the smaller outer cells contain progres-
sively smaller larvae, down to eggs. Work from the outside in, using the
smaller larvae first, then the larger larvae, then the pupae. This is because
the pupae keep for much longer than the larvae, and the larger larvae keep
better than the smaller ones. The larvae can be pulled from the cells with a
jerk, using blunt tweezers. Sharp tweezers can puncture a larva and spill its
contents into the cell, thus wasting much of it. The pupae are in a silk en-
velope and their cells are capped over. This silk is tough. With practice, the
cap can be lifted with tweezers and the pupa lifted out in one movement.
It must then be carefully slid out of its envelope without breaking the
body, or again much of the contents will be lost. The inside of both larva
and pupa is a pulp that is of ideal consistency for young chicks, but it
must be kept within the skin or the birds cannot pick it up.
The larvae go black after about two weeks in the fridge but the pupae
do not. I think this is mostly due to the liberation of the intestinal con-
tents of the larva into the body tissues. These larvae are unable to defae-
cate until they pupate, so the gut contents are retained as a dark brown
solid mass in the body. This is released just as the pupa is formed and so is
absent from the latter. There may be no connection with this, but at any
rate the pupae do not discolour. I have fed a few of the black larvae to ad-
ult birds, but have not risked them with chicks. The pupae also keep better
because they are sealed in, and, of course, are dormant relative to the lar-
vae.
Nests do not get very large here because of the cool wet climate, but
last summer was quite good, and I collected a nest of six combs or stories.

These paper discs are largest in the middle of the nest and the cell openings
are on the bottom side. The nest and contents weighed 1 lb 9 oz (710 g)
and contained at least 4,690 cells, of which 2,860 were occupied with 430
eggs, 1,716 larvae and 725 pupae. Out of the total of 2,441 pupae and lar-
vae, 2,000 were usable, the remaining 441 larvae were too tiny.
There were 457 wasps with three queens, in the nest at 4 p.m. on a
warm July evening, and I estimate that this was at least half of the colony
strength. Other nests have shown the total number of working adults to be
small, always under a thousand, and usually about three to five hundred,
with a ratio of one worker to two larvae. The weather, of course, governs
the size of the colony.
Wasp grubs are something of an acquired taste and not all birds will eat
them at first, but usually they will take to them later. The pupae seem to
be more acceptable, and these are better to start with if the birds are fussy.
The largest grubs and pupae are 3 A" (20 mm) long, but they are of a con-
sistency such that even newly-hatched Zosterops chicks can gulp down the
pulp after the parent has broken the grub's skin with a few bangs. I am ex-
perimenting with freezing wasp larvae and pupae and seeing if they can be
used after a year. The birds eat them as long as they are still recognisable,
and they do not have to be moving to be used as rearing food. The pupae
do not move anyway, and the larvae only wriggle a little when put out.
They become dormant in the fridge.*
Notwithstanding the collection difficulties, I have found these to be
among the most storable of wild live foods, and about the most trouble-
free food for newly hatched chicks.
This season (1980) I have no intention of going through all the hazards
of previous years. I have now discovered relatively inexpensive commer-
cial sources of live foods and if the breeding season is not more success-
ful than before, it will at least be easier, thanks to Olympic mealworms,
and also Barrett's crickets - both of California. There is no way that I
can collect or'raise these creatures cheaper than I can import them from
the sunny south!
*Many birds shake their heads and drop wasp larvae. On the other hand,
wasp pupae are immediately eaten. Since writing the above, I tasted a larva
to see what was so objectionable - and found it to be completely tasteless!
Perhaps the pupae are flavoured, but I have not got around to trying one.

BIRDS OF A CANBERRA GARDEN

By ALASTAIR MORRISON (Ainslie, ACT, Australia)
Coming to live in Canberra in 1967 has provided a rich experience in
bird life , some of it familiar to me from avicultural days in England
fifty years ago. I have never, however, established an aviary in Australia.
My wife and I are often away from home and quite apart from this, the
amount of pet bird theft in Australia is quite astonishing. What might be
called avicultural larceny seems almost a national sport. Furthermore, avi-
culture is very strictly controlled in the interests of wildlife protection and
the importation of birds is absolutely forbidden. The ban is designed to
prevent the introduction of Newcastle disease among poultry. The penal-
ties for illegal bird importation are draconian. Anyone foolish enough to
buy an imported bird is liable not only for heavy financial penalties, but
also for the destruction of the bird imported and all other birds in his
possession and as many of the birds that appear on his property as special
shooters can destroy over a period of days. The Australian aviculturist
undeniably has problems.
However, in practice the lack of an aviary, which I always thought I
would have in my declining years, has proved to be no great hardship. Our
quarter of an acre garden backs onto an area of bushland and we have a
constant flow of bird visitors.
The very first morning after our arrival we saw a flock of Gang-gangs in a
large gum tree in the garden, the first of many visits by this species. In the
wild they are the most charming birds with a marvellously buoyant,
swerving flight. It is a pity that their voices should be like rusty railway
brakes. They are abundant in the forested hills of S.E. Australia and come
into Canberra in the winter where they have learned to enjoy the seeds of
many exotic trees. They are remarkably tame.
The most abundant parrot is Pennant's Parrakeet. They are constantly
to be seen and if food is put out for them, numbers can be attracted. At
the bird table they are surprisingly quarrelsome. Eastern Rosellas are less
common but very elegant and possessed of charming and melodious warb-
ling calls. Only occasionally have we seen King Parrakeets in the garden
though they are common in other parts of Canberra. A friend has a de-
lightfully tame specimen, rescued with a broken wing as a juvenile. As a
pet its behaviour reminds one strongly of a lorikeet. We have never seen

any lorikeets in Canberra though some do, in fact, occur; nor do we see
Redrumps in the garden though they are common in neighbouring grass-
lands.
Roseate Cockatoos (Galahs) are common, especially in winter. It is
one of the birds which has benefitted from human settlement. Although
delightful, gregarious, playful birds, they are almost too common for their
beauty to be fully appreciated. Sulphur-crested Cockatoos, with their
beautiful flight and terrible voices, are an occa sional winter visitor. They
are abundant around Canberra.
The only Australian finches to visit the garden are Bicheno's and Syd-
ney Waxbills. They visit in winter if we put out millet but most of the
seed is taken by hordes of House Sparrows, one of the many unfortunate
introductions made by the early settlers. We sometimes also have much
more welcome Goldfinches. The only other Australian finch that occurs
regularly in Canberra, the handsome Diamond Sparrow (a pair was one of
my most treasured possessions as a schoolboy), has never appeared to date.
There is no lack of insectivorous birds. The most conspicuous are the
Magpies or Piping Crows - delightful and comical birds with a most melod-
ious song.They become very tame but are also aggressive during the nesting
season when they dive-bomb human beings near their nests. They do not,
unfortunately, distinguish between bird lovers and others.
Related to the Piping Crows are the Currawongs. The common Pied
Currawong is a crow-like bird with white markings and fierce yellow eyes.
They occur in great flocks in winter, constantly calling to each other with
loud and rollicking cries. The slightly larger Grey Currawong is compara-
tively rare but both species occur in our garden.
Infinitely daintier are the Blue Wrens, enchanting little birds with long
tails cocked up over their backs, the males in colour largely a brilliant blue.
They go about in little parties and would be more common if it were not
for the innumerable cats which infest Canberra. Typically Australian are
the honey-eaters. They are adapted to take nectar from various Australian
flowers but they are also largely insectivorous. Eight species have occurred
in our garden. They vary in size from the Wattled Honey-eater and Friar
Birds, which are as big as Blackbirds, to the Spine-billed Honey-eater about
the same size as a large sunbird. The Wattled Honey-eaters are long-tailed,
grey and white with pendulous red wattles and loud, harsh cries and the
Friar Birds have bare heads and knobby protuberances above their bills.

Both species are summer visitors but the Spine-billed are with us all the
year round. The first Spine-billed I ever saw belonged to Mr Alfred Ezra
who kept one in his bedroom together with several Nightingales. In spring
Mr Ezra had to move out of his bedroom because the Nightingales sang so
loudly. I recollect that he let the Spine-billed out of its cage to bathe
under the tap of the wash basin.
Australian Robins - exceptionally dainty little birds - are occasional
visitors. Flame, Scarlet and Red-capped Robins have all appeared and I
hope for others. Although totally unrelated, they do resemble the Euro-
pean Robin to some extent in their ways but only the males have full red
breasts. The hens are dowdy little brown birds. Two families of small and
specialist insectivorous birds are frequent visitors. There are two kinds of
Pardalote - small short-tailed, thick-billed birds with yellow or scarlet mar-
kings. They live largely on the scale insects to be found on some eucalypts.
The other family consists of the Thornhills and Weebills. They are small,
insignificant, brownish, quick moving birds. I have seen five species in the
garden but they are sometimes difficult to identify clearly. They are con-
stantly on the move and my hearing is no longer good enough to pick out
the differences in their calls.
Two kinds of Whistler are regular visitors; like rather stoutly built fly-
catchers, the males are handsome fellows with dominant yellow or chest-
nut markings mixed with white and black. With Thornhills and Robins and
a species of tree-creeper and the little grey Fantail - the tamest of birds -
they make up feeding groups in winter. Another visitor is the Willie Wag-
tail, a large pied Fantail which reminded the early settlers of the Pied Wag-
tail in England. There is a certain superficial similarity but the Australian
Wagtail wags sideways and not up and down.
We see them all. In summer we also have the handsome Masked Cuc-
koo-shrike, large pale grey birds, the male with a black mask. In their
habits they do indeed share some of the characteristics of both shrikes and
cuckoos. European Starlings are always about as are Blackbirds. The
elegant Australian Grey Shrike-thrush is also a regular visitor. It has a short
but sweet song. Another bird we sometimes see is the Speckled Warbler
which behaves very much like a Hedge Sparrow.
Two unusual Australian passerines also come into the garden at times -
the handsome Magpie Lark and the larger White-winged Chough, the latter
an untidy, gregarious species with ruby-red eyes and a rather sad whistling
call. Both species build peculiar, bowl-shaped mud nests.

Apart from parrots, we have comparatively few non-passerine visi-
tors. The most conspicuous is the Giant Kingfisher or Kookaburra which
is with us all the year round. Its maniacal laughing calls are a feature of the
Australian scene. They become quite tame and periodically come to be
fed on scraps of meat. We may not see any for long periods but then a
little group appears on the garage roof and watch us gravely through the
kitchen window until we give them something to eat. Blue and white
Sacred Kingfishers occur in summer. Both species are dry land species
which are not dependent on the availability of streams.
A species of cuckoo is an occasional summer visitor and at that time we
often see Broad-billed Rollers with their aerobatic flight and harsh calls.
They nest in the bushland behind the house. Sometimes a Goshawk sweeps
through and we once had a male Sparrow-Hawk take a Zosterops in the
garden.
We never lack the company of birds.

REPORT ON SOCIAL MEETING HELD ON 16th JANUARY, 1980
By ROSEMARY LOW

A fascinating discourse on waterfowl in Australia was heard by mem-
bers who attended the cheese and wine party held on 16th January 1980,
at Burlington House, London.The speaker was Michael Lubbock, Assistant
Director of the Wildfowl Trust.
During the twenty years he has spent at the Wildfowl Trust, he has
been on waterfowl collecting expeditions to Alaska, the Canadian Arctic,
South America and, last October, to Australia. The latter was especially
exciting as, due to the fact that export of native fauna is prohibited, the
indigenous waterfowl are almost unknown outside Australia.
Mr. Lubbock obtained special permission to collect eggs of four species
of ducks in Western Australia - Musk, Pink-eared, Blue-billed and Freckled.
An area within a 300-mile radius of Perth was covered, using a canoe with
an outboard motor.
Of especial interest is the Musk Duck Biziura lobata, a bizarre species
which has a lobe below the lower mandible . The male is extremely
aggressive and, extraordinary as it may seem, it is twice the size of the
female, a fact which was used to advantage in the Slimbridge collection as
the female could escape the male's attentions by disappearing through
specially designed "port holes".
Mr. Lubbock discovered that Musk Ducks nest in clumps of reeds and
the female will cover the nest with reeds and down on leaving. The average
clutch consists of only two eggs which are green.
As the result of collecting eggs which were hatched at Slimbridge, some
very interesting facts, hitherto unrecorded, were discovered about the
ducklings. They are so aggresssive that one at Slimbridge which was only
24 hours old killed a younger duckling. Uniquely among waterfowl, the
ducklings gape for food (showing orange gapes) and are fed by the female
for two to three weeks.
Mr. Lubbock had to wade about in several feet of water to find the
nests of this species. If there are no rushes in the vicinity, Musk Ducks

use old Coots' nests. One egg was found in a Black Swan's nest.
The Pink-eared Duck Malacorhynchus memhranaceus is also of unusual
appearance, having a large beak with a fleshy flap on each side. Previously
there had only ever been one pair at the Wildfowl Trust. Mr. Lubbock
discovered that one lake might yield 150 Grey Teal nests but only seven
Pink-eared Ducks' nests. The latter nest in hollows in trees, or occasion-
ally in the crutch of two branches. For reasons unknown, the ducks use
a lot of down to cover the eggs. Due to the fact that the trees are dying
off in the saline lakes in which they nest, the provision of nest-boxes
would greatly assist them. Additionally, gulls also nest in the trees. Pink-
eared Ducks lay nine or ten eggs.
They were found nesting on only two lakes of the many searched and
one of these was in a metropolitan area. From the eggs collected, a number
of ducklings was reared at Slimbridge. However, initially there were prob-
lems with their diet. Wet and dry foods were offered but only wet diets
were eaten. When chick starter crumbs were offered, no more problems
were encountered.
During the few weeks he was in the area, Mr. Lubbock saw 150 Freck-
led Ducks Stictonetta naevosa - more than were thought to be in the
area. He believed that others had not known where to look for this species
which is rare and very secretive and spends a lot of its time in the rushes.
The Freckled Duck, which is similar in appearance to the extinct Pink-
headed Duck, has never previously been kept in captivity. The display of
this species is unique, the birds swimming in circles with their bills under
water.
The Blue-billed Duck Oxyura australis is not unlike the Argentine
Ruddy Duck O. jamaicensis. Only four eggs of the Blue-billed Duck were
collected as no nests were found until the last day. However, all the
resulting ducklings proved to be males. It is hoped to be able to obtain
some more eggs in the near future.

It never occurred to me that I would have, one day, to write the obit-
uary of Phyllis Barclay-Smith.
Not only was she considerably younger than I am, but I had found her
in a good state of health during a long visit she paid to Cleres in August
1979. When she left to return to England, I did not suspect that it was
the last time I would see her. She suddenly collapsed at a Christmas dinner
party, and she never came out of a coma. She died on 2nd January 1980.
We had been close friends and associates for a long time. When I first
met her, she was a young assistant to her uncle and aunt, Mr and Mrs F.
Lemon, who in those days managed the affairs of the Royal Society for
the Protection of Birds as Secretary. She held that position between 1929
and 1935.
Soon after the organisation of the International Council for Bird
Preservation (1922), of which I am the only founder still alive, I started as
its Vice-President for Europe, working with the R.S.P.B., and I came into
contact with Miss Barclay-Smith. Here, unusual efficiency was already
obvious. Her association with all the ornithologists interested in preserving
birds all over the world developed gradually, and in 1935 she became an
Assistant Secretary of the I.C.B.P. She soon took over a number of the
various responsibilities of the Council, and between 1938 and 1958, while
I was its President, she actually managed our activities all over the world,
carrying on under my successor, Professor Dillon Ripley, until 1978 when
she relinquished her position of Secretary to become a Vice-President.
All that pertains to birds was Miss Barclay-Smith's greatest interest,
not only their conservation in a hostile and ever more threatening world,
but their study in nature and their observation and propagation in cap-
tivity. She dedicated herself to those various pursuits with an energy and
a relentlessness that were a guarantee of success. She became the Honorary
Secretary of the British Ornithologists' Union (1945-1951) and later on a
Vice-President.
She certainly was an aviculturist in a special, restricted way. Living
in London, she could only keep a few caged pets, which she did with
unusual skill and devotion. Her old friends will remember, in particu-
lar, a pair of Yellow-winged Sugar Birds which she possessed for a very

long time. No birds have ever been kept with more sentimental and
elaborate care.
The Avicultural Society, just before the Second World War, was in
a difficult situation. We had to find a new editor for the Magazine.
The late David Seth-Smith, who had been, on an off, its editor for over
thirty years, finally had to retire. There was no suitable replacement in
sight and our President, the late Alfred Ezra, and I endeavoured to per-
suade Miss Barclay-Smith to accept the position. She was reluctant to
assume such a responsibility, but we promised her all the possible help
and she finally agreed to try. She edited the Avicultural Magazine for the
next thirty-five years (1938-1973).
Although she worked full time for the government throughout the
war, she succeeded in keeping our publication going during those anxious
years, remaining in touch with our members in the free world who had
something to contribute. Her activity seemed to have no limits as, at the
same time, she also carried on with the work of the I.C.B.P.
After the war, Miss Barclay-Smith greatly improved our Magazine. At
the same time she developed considerably her other activities. She organi-
sed a number of congresses and symposia. She also published several
books, pamphlets and bulletins and translated others from the French and
German. Now that hard work appears to have become an oddity, it is diffi-
cult to imagine that anyone achieved so much, for so many years. In the
course of her incessant activities, she had met all the prominent ornitholo-
gists of the world, and many became close friends. She was able to interest
them in her pursuits and to gain their support for international bird pres-
servation. She travelled extensively and promoted with a special winning
eagerness the causes she had at heart. She practically always met with
success.
For practically twenty years, after the end of the war, her house in
Warwick Avenue, in the north of London, became the gathering centre of
ornithologists from many countries. A number of them stayed there dur-
ing their visits, and there were innumerable dinner parties of which she
took the entire care.
Miss Barclay-SmitlTs singular achievements were widely recognised.
She was made a Member of the British Empire in 1958, and a Commander
in 1971. She was awarded the gold medal of the R.S.P.B. and the Delacour
Medal of the I.C.B.P., as well as a number of foreign orders and awards.

All those who, like myself, have long worked with her, realise that she
was extraordinarily capable and completely devoted to the different res-
ponsibilities she had assumed. Her sometimes-fiery efforts almost invariab-
ly reached their goal. Today, when not only birds, but nature itself, are
threatened with destruction by man's senseless over-exploitation and con-
secutive pollution, she will be missed to an extent still difficult to evaluate.

NOTES ON THE DENVER ZOO BIRD COLLECTION IN 1979
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.9662074" page_id="56283767"  page_num="49" year="" vol="">
By EDWARD C. SCHMITT (Curator)
The bird collection during 1979 experienced one of the most productive
years since the opening of "Bird World" and the new Pheasantry.
The waterfowl area continued producing a variety of species, the most
prolific being the Hooded Mergansers, who contributed 19 chicks success-
fully reared. An important species hatched for the first time was the
Bufflehead, a total of four being reared to adulthood.
The most notable pheasants produced were a pair of Satyr Tragopans,
9 Cheer Pheasants and 11 White Eared Pheasants. Unfortunately all of the
White Eared Pheasants were placed in a newly-constructed rearing facility
when they were 6-8 weeks old and a freak violent thunderstorm killed 9 of
the 11, resulting in only two being successfully reared. As in the past our
Black-footed Penguins hatched and reared one young. We also continued
to produce Stanley Cranes, with one being reared successfully.
The most interesting of the large birds hatched was the Double-wattled
Cassowary. In an exceptional year, we had 13 eggs laid by a single female.
All were artificially incubated. Eleven of the 13 were fertile and 8 were
hatched. Two chicks died within 24 hours of hatching and 6 were success-
fully reared. Unfortunately all 6 turned out to be males.
In Bird World, a number of species continued to produce. These inclu-
ded the Lilac-breasted Roller, Red and Yellow Barbet, Speckled Mousebird
(40 in two years), Red and White Crakes, Green Imperial Fruit Pigeon,
Red-Legged Honeycreeper, Blacksmith Plover and the Blue-crowned
Motmot.
In the entire collection, 55 species were hatched and 220 individuals
were reared. A number of species hatched young for the first time in the
Zoo but failed to rear them for various reasons. These included African
Green White-eyes, White-quilled Black Bustard and Superb Starlings. Two
notable species laid eggs but did not hatch; these were the Hooded Vulture
and the Cinereous Vulture.

RED-BILLED GROUND CUCKOOS ( Carpococcyx renauldi)
A NEW SPECIES AT THE BERLIN ZOO

In late autumn 1979, the Berlin Zoo obtained four newly-hatched
Red-billed Ground Cuckoos - a most interesting species from South-
east Asia - from the Vogelpark Walsrode, West Germany.
These birds were housed in our spacious tropical free-flight aviary (360
m square). They are the most admired birds there, attracting the visitors
because of their unusual size and tameness. Their total length measures
about 70 cms, half of which is the dark metallic-blue tail.
Due to their extremely strong legs these Cuckoos are well accustomed
to living on the ground of the jungle, only retiring to the tree tops at
night.
A firm sex determination proves to be problematical, though the

females seem to be somewhat smaller in size, but then again this may
only be determined with certainty should they happen to start breed-
ing, which we are hoping for. They are given every encouragement to
build their large nests on the ground: they lay 4 to 5 eggs, each of which
weighs about 230 gs.
Our Red-billed Ground Cuckoos are fed live insects as well as newly-
born rodents.
We are hopeful of being able to start a series of scientific studies of
this species enabling us to record facts still unknown since their natural
history in the wild is virtually unexplored.

Readers of early avicultural literature will know of the fantastic coll-
ection amassed by Lord Lilford at his estate near Oundle during the early
part of this century. After many years of disuse a number of the aviaries
and paddocks have now been refurbished and contain a very interesting
collection composed mainly of the larger birds.
The enclosures are large and naturally planted and great care
is exercised to guard against overcrowding. As a result, breeding successes are
numerous. During the last season, amongst others, American Kestrels
Falco sparverius , Buzzard Buteo buteo , Kestrel Falco tinnunculus, Snowy
Owl Nyctea scandiaca , Great Eagle Owl Bubo bubo bubo , Little Owl
Athene noctua , Tawny Owl Strix aluco sylvaticus and White-breasted Barn
Owl Tyto alba alba together with Common Rhea Rhea americana and
many species of waterfowl and pheasants were reared.
Anthony Turk, the Curator, would particularly welcome advice about
the identity of rather an enigmatic pair of Ravens which reared four
chicks. These birds, which are of uncertain origin, appear to be noticeably
smaller than the birds found wild in Britain, have a different call and nest
late in April or May. They have no distinctive coloration or marking so
would appear to be a subspecies of Corvus corax .

Five of the six full species of peacock pheasant are represented in the
collection of the Hong Kong Zoological Gardens and all breed regularly,
including the Palawan Peacock Pheasant Polyplectron emphanum .
Writing on the success with this species, Dr. K.C. Searle,
Curator, says: "The original nucleus was 2/3 wild-caught birds acquired
in 1964. In 1967 I obtained another wild-caught male from the Philippines
and two years later, a zoo-bred (Frankfurt) male. A juvenile male, said to
have been bred in Japan but from its condition on arrival and behaviour,
it seemed to be a wild-caught bird, was added in 1972. Young were first
reared in 1965 and have been so each year since. A total of 258 chicks
have been hatched of which 204 have reached maturity. We have never
had more than five breeding pairs "in action" in any one year, and usually
less because of my policy of not going on indefinitely with old birds but
keeping up replacements in young pairs. The progeny have been distribu-
ted to 28 collections in 16 countries including seven pairs donated to
Jersey. This year (1979) we reared our first third generation captive-bred

While European aviculturists marvel at some of the avian gems origina-
ting from New Guinea, two familiar European birds recently caused some
excitement amongst the ornithologists resident in Papua New Guinea.
Both the Black-headed Gull and Sand Martin were observed in January
1979 and constitute the first confirmed sightings of these species for that
country.

Following his NOTES FROM A KENYAN COLLECTION (AM 1979,
p.95), Malcolm Ellis heard from Mr. Downey that his Red-headed Blue-
bills nested again in March 1979, and were doing so again at the time the
letter was written in November. In December, he had the pleasure of visit-
ing Mr. Downey at Langata, Kenya, and was shown three recently fledged
Blue-bills, still with their parents. The nest was constructed in a large
cardboard carton filled with dry grass. No attempt had been made to
screen the carton which had been placed on a shelf, about waist-high
above the ground, in the sheltered part of the aviary. The aviary, he
estimates, measures about 15 x 8 x 6 ft high, or a little larger. It has a
bare earth floor with practically no vegetation, but the wire is covered
by thick foliage; therefore the inside is nicely secluded.

The Falconry Centre at Newent, under the directorship of Philip
Glasier, continues to report important breeding successes. During 1979
three Egyptian Vultures Neophron percnopterus were reared success-
fully, together with a Blyth's Hawk Eagle Spizaetus alboniger and many
other raptors, both nocturnal and diurnal. Although the Blyth's Hawk
Eagle is a small species, it seems to have a very protracted breeding
cycle, both incubation and fledging taking unusually long periods.

Few visitors to our member Keith Bromley's collection at King's
Sombome could fail to be impressed both by the size of his collec-
tion of waterfowl and by the manner in which they are displayed.
The enclosures are landscaped and planted to give the impression of
a vast rock-garden and a well-bore at the highest point sends crystal
clear water down cascades and waterfalls to feed the terraces of pools.
Rarities abound and many have bred successfully. These include
White-headed Duck Oxyura leucocephala , Argentine Ruddy Duck
Oxyura vittata , Smew Mergus alhellus and Bronze-winged Duck Anas
specularis. A pair of the latter species had proved particularly proli-
fic and many of the examples of this large, attractive duck now in this
country are the progeny of this pair. Three further Orinoco Geese
Neochen jubata have now been obtained to go with the lone gander

Philip G. Schofield writes from Suffolk: "On a visit to the Cotswold
Wildlife Park in September (1979) I noticed a Grey-necked Wood Rail
Aramides cafanea vigorously attacking something on the floor of its aviary.
The object of its attention proved to be a bath plug, complete with chain,
which the bird had presumably removed from the pool in the aviary. I
watched the bird for about half an hour, during which it energetically
hammered the plug from all angles. Probably these Rails eat a certain
number of aquatic snails and similar creatures in the wild state, and this
individual seemed to be under the impression that its bath plug was such
a food item. On several occasions it was seen to seize the chain attached
to the plug and carry it to another part of the aviary before renewing its
onslaught on the unproductive piece of rubber."

Members of the Avicultural Society with a special interest in soft-
billed birds will be sorry to hear that, after several years of uncertainty,
Winged World has finally closed its doors to the public. Over the last
decade, this Lancashire establishment achieved a justifiable reputa-
tion for maintaining and breeding the less frequently kept and more
exacting species of insectivorous and frugivorous birds. Amongst those
reared were Little and White-fronted Bee-eaters, Hoopoe, Green Wood
Hoopoe, Red-billed Hornbill, Blue-crowned Motmot, Woodland King-
fisher, Bristle-crowned Starling, Rothschild's and Andaman Grackles,
Southern Tree Pie, Kiskadee Flycatcher, Black Bulbul, Fairy Bluebird
and four species of barbet - Toucan, Black-spotted, Brown-throated and
D'Arnaud's. Many represented the first breeding of the species.
Breeding had been much reduced over the past three or four years but
nevertheless, some noteworthy results were achieved; the highlight being
the successful rearing of a Sun Bittern in 1978, a success which was al-
most duplicated on several occasions in 1979.

Professor J.R. Hodges writes: "My first success with Blue-winged
Grass Parrakeets Neophema chrysostoma occurred in 1960 when my only
pair produced two young (A.M. I960, p. 156). I have bred some almost
every year since. In the period 1966 to 1973, four or five pairs produced
consistently twenty to thirty youngsters a year. Since reducing the number
of breeding pairs in 1974 they have been less prolific but six to ten have
been reared in most seasons. This year (1979) was the worst year with
only four young reared from three proven breeding pairs of which two of
the hens died. The total reared in a twenty-year period is two hundred and
eight, some of which are now of the twelfth generation."

A consignment of twenty Yellow-faced Parrotlets Forpus xanthops
was imported into England during the latter part of last year and is prob-
ably the first occasion that the species has been available to aviculture.
As most are believed to have gone to one collection, it is hoped that
breeding is not far away. The importer, Mr. Woods of Cheltenham,
experienced no difficulty whatsoever in establishing and quarantining
the birds.

BATHS. By Don McNeil
Published by Pacific Research Press, Seattle, USA, 1979. Price 8.95
dollars, pp. 109.
Although designed for the American reader, this excellent publication
is to be highly recommended to anyone wishing to provide roosting and
nesting facilities for wild birds visiting their property and who have a
basic knowledge of carpentry. Despite what the jacket publicity pro-
claims, I doubt if the novice woodworker would make much impress-
ion on the six compartment martin house before turning his attentions
to something a little less demanding for the neighbourhood wrens.
The nine chapters dealing with the accommodation requirements of
various species span from four to nine pages with each divided into four
sections. The first part gives an interesting and informative insight into
the lifestyle of the birds whose attentions one is hoping to attract,
while the others tell of how to go about it. The materials and tools
required for the job in hand are listed down to the last screw. Instruc-
tions for assembly take up about two-thirds of the chapters and, besides
being extremely comprehensive, are illustrated with detailed explanatory
diagrams making the task that much easier. Among the species catered
for are swallows, martins, wrens, chickadees, nuthatches, wood duck,
owls, robins, bluebirds and woodpeckers.
An extremely ingenious chapter of fourteen pages is devoted to the
exclusion of predators and competitors from nest boxes, while others
encompass feeders (bird tables, peanut holders, drinkers, etc.) and con-
structing bathing facilities. On this latter subject, I do not recommend
the use of a light bulb and exposed lead beneath a pan of water which is
given as an alternative method of keeping it from freezing. Electrical
equipment not properly sealed against water can be dangerous should a
starling decide to take a mid-winter bath as they are apt to do on fine
days.
My only real qualm about this book is its apparent weak spine. It is
meant to be a working book and, although the review copy has not seen
much action, I doubt if it could stand up to much use in the workshop

is only a minor failing in an otherwise excellent book which is expected

Published by Biotropic Verlag, Kohlbrandstrasse 20, 6000 Frankfurt
am Main 60. Germany. 1979. Price 45 DM. (ISBN 3-922465-00-5)
Whilst the text of this attractive book is in German and therefore
of limited value to many readers of the AVICULTURAL MAGAZINE,
it is well worth having for the beautiful illustrations. Forty-two species
of hummingbird are described by the author, a member of the Avicul-
tural Society, with colour photographs of many of them. The quality of
the colour is excellent and these plates will be a very valuable aid to
identification. There are also colour and black and white photographs of
nests and habitats as well as some very attractive line drawings.
This book can be obtained direct from the publishers if unobtainable
in local bookshops.

WOODLAND GROUSE 1978, edited by T.W.I. Lovel.
Published by the World Pheasant Association, Daws Hall, Lamarsh,
Bures, Suffolk C08 5EX (Price #8.00 including postage &amp; packing)
This excellently produced little book (I do not know whether a
"paperback" or not as its cover seems to be of some sturdy material
intermediate between cloth and paper) reproduces the talks and discuss-
ions given during a "Woodland Grouse Symposium", held at Culloden
House, Inverness, in December 1978 and sponsored by t he World Pheas-
ant Association, the International Council for Bird Preservation, the

The species dealt with are the Capercaillie, Black-billed Capercaillie,
Black Grouse, Hazel Grouse, Spruce Grouse, Blue Grouse and Ruffed
Grouse. The Caucasian Black Grouse is not discussed, whether because
it is less, or even less of a woodland bird than its relative the Black
Grouse, or just because no one taking part had any information on it,
is not stated.
The many people contributing to the symposium provide between
them a great amount of information on the ecology, feeding habits, dis-
tribution and some aspects of behaviour of the species they have studied.
Some of it (though not much) I found hard to believe. Do female Black
Grouse eat 'the saliva spat by the cocks' (p.86) at the lek? Is the Jay
really the primary predator on the eggs and young of the Capercaillie
(p. 175)?
There are some useful distribution maps and a wealth, well anyway,
a great number of graphs, tables and mathematical formulae of varying
complexity. There is, alas, a corresponding dearth of illustrations of the
birds themselves. A welcome exception is Dr. A.V. Andreev's interesting
contribution on the Black-billed Capercaillie, which is embellished with
two photographs (one on the book's cover) and twenty delightfully
'live' black and white drawings, showing the bird in various agonistic and
sexual postures (pp. 134-9). A great pity that Dr. Scherzinger's descrip-
tion of the displays of the Hazel Grouse is not likewise illustrated.
Most of the species discussed seem to have been decreasing in most
places in recent decades. These declines seem primarily due to habitat
changes brought about by man, although earlier alterations wrought by

man in the past may have been favourable for species like the Black
Grouse. Other adverse factors include birdwatchers and ramblers (p.25,
p.159 and elsewhere). They are implicitly or explicitly condemned but
not "Sportsmen.who come to shoot the woodland grouse and have
a great affection for them" (p.156), "commercial shooting of Capercaillie
(which) has expanded rapidly since the early 1970s in both private and
Forestry Commission woods" (p.140; italics mine) or even the sportsmen
in Czechoslovakia who sometimes shoot every male Black Grouse on the
lek so that the hens lay sterile eggs (p.74). The cynical and unsporting
may be tempted to suspect that this attitude is not entirely unconnected
with the well-known fact (stated on p.63 of this work) that research on
gamebirds is mainly financed by sportsmen, and reflect on the old Eng-
lish saying about paying the piper and calling the tune.
Nowhere, of course, is there any recognition of the fact that, were it
not for the activities of the shooters, the 'disturbance' caused by bird-
watchers, ramblers and others who can enjoy a day in the country with-
out deliberately killing or wounding some fellow creature, would be
much less disturbing in its effects. Alas!...'the law of trespass is weak in
Scotland' (pl59) and (same page), 'We need a legal poison' (for crows,
cats and foxes). This book is one more illustration (not that more are
needed for the fact to be obvious) of the very different attitudes taken
by many, and among them the most influential bird protectionists to-
wards, on the one hand, protein-hungry Mediterranean and African peas-
ants who kill relatively abundant warblers, larks and terns for food,
aviculturists who wish to handrear and keep a few individuals of common
species, and small boys who take the eggs of 'common or garden' birds;
and, on the other, towards sportsmen who shoot relatively (as compared
with warblers, larks, etc.) scarce 'woodland grouse', Woodcock and wild-
fowl and, quite legally, destroy as Vermin' the Goosander, one of our
handsomest and far from common ducks, because it is thought to en-
danger the fly fisherman's sport.
Still, this is a book that anyone particularly interested in the species
involved should try to obtain. Indeed, it is worth its price for Dr. Andre-
ev's lively drawings of the Black-billed Capercaillie alone.

Breeding Laterallus leucopyrrhus
I was very interested to read the article "Breeding Laterallus leuco-
pyrrhus in the AVICULTURAL MAGAZINE (Vol. 85, 2: 63-67) by
L. Gibson of Canada.
Last year I also bred this species in confinement in a very small and
open indoor aviary. Gibson refers to a closely related species which
is not identified in his article. I have also kept a bird of that species
and a French friend of mine, M. Liano (Clermon) kept it for quite a
long time. I identify these birds as Laterallus melanophaius , the Rufous-
sided Crake. This species seems to be uncommon in its native country and
only occasionally reaches our country, at a rate of one melanophaius
to 200 leucopyrrhrus. These shipments generally come from Argentina.
A reasonably good picture of this species can be found in E.R. Blake's
MANUAL OF NEOTROPICAL BIRDS, Volume 1, plate 11, no.13.
Unfortunately the plate of this bird in Ripley's monumental RAILS OF
THE WORLD is not so good as it does not show the white on the breast
and belly. Even the illustration of the much better known Laterallus
leucopyrrhus is incorrect as the bird lacks the reddish-pink feet. Perhaps
the artist, J.F.Lansdowne, based his colours on museum specimens that
often change colour on the feet and bill. The black and white photograph
on page 336 is clearly not that of a melanophaius , as stated, but of leuco-
pyrrhus.

By A. GARDENER (British Isles)
As far as I know the Griffon Vulture has only been bred once before in
the British Isles and that was at Chester Zoo in 1940 {AviculturalMagazine
Fifth Series, Vol. VI, No. 5, Sept.-Oct. 1941). Mr. Mottershead's ac-
count of this was fairly brief and so I thought that a more detailed account
of my own experience might be of interest to members, particularly since
I keep my Griffon Vultures in almost wild conditions.
I obtained the parents from Tarifa in southern Spain about eighteen
years ago and they are approximately 19 years old. They share an aviary
with two Turkey Vultures and a pair of Batteleur Eagles. The aviary is
approximately one acre square and 40 feet high. It contains a pool with
running water, a sand pit and a concrete path leading to two large feeding
troughs - one for the summer and one for the winter - each equipped with
running water for cleanliness. These feeding troughs are penned in to stop
the birds from dragging out the meat and the concrete floors are laid at an
incline to facilitate cleaning. The reason for the two troughs is that their
alternate use enables the surrounding ground to regenerate and become
free of germs for the next season.
The aviary contains many large shelters on various levels, each one
designed for a different species, and there are several platforms, divided
into two sections. On the more secluded side are the breeding platforms
with their large lorry tyres and built-in shelters; each one is a separate unit
and can only be reached on the wing to provide maximum privacy. On the
outer sides the platforms are arranged to assimilate a cliff-face. The re-
maining side is flanked by five mature poplar trees which make excellent
perches. The middle of the aviary is free of any obstruction so that if a
bird takes off, it may fly along its length and land on the far side. More

often the birds fly around, particularly in the prevailing windy conditions
as the aviary has been built on a plateau. The Bateleur Eagles are forever
on the wing, noisily yet lazily climbing, diving and gliding. The Griffon
Vultures are not so energetic taking off only some six times a day, flapping
their wings to gain speed and then simply gliding halfway through the
aviary, often performing a semicircle. The three species in the aviary
appear to be compatible, and generally ignore each other, remaining exclu-
sively in their own territories.
The ground covering of the aviary consisting of heather, moss and
grass, which not only looks natural but has the advantage of absorbing
immediately all the birds' droppings. The rest of the aviary's interior is
made up of an orchard with hedges and evergreen trees, which provide an
abundance of nest material, as well as occupation for the seven birds. I
clean the aviary and feed the birds myself and by now they are so used to
this that it causes no disturbance or stress at all. When they see me coming,
they fly away one by one and watch my every movement; if I approach
say, five steps further into the interior of the aviary they are off. None of
them is tame.
The mature birds are fed on a variety of whole carcasses; one day, say,
white rats, the next day rabbits, then chickens and young pigs, etc. There
is no cleaning up to be done after that as the birds eat bones, skin and all.
Sometimes I feed them on much bigger carcasses, such as calves, sheep and
pigs. One carcass is fed at a time, the rest stored in deep freezers and
fridges near the aviary. These larger carcasses are offered to the birds
unopened and in no time the Bateleurs and Turkey Vultures are on the
scene, but make little or no headway. The adult Griffons always arrive
last and open up the carcass. Only after that will the other birds actually
get to the food. By letting the birds do their own work they entertain
themselves for hours on end and also keep their beaks and talons well
polished. The following day, I add to the opened carcass some multivit-
amins and oystershell grit, on other days minerals with fine sand to help
digestion. Some days later, when the skeleton has been picked clean,
I hack into many pieces and the birds then eat the bones especially the
marrow now made accessible. The next day, no food is given at all which
enables me to clean the feeding trough thoroughly, using a brush-hose-
pipe and Dettol.
During mid-December 1979 the Griffon Vultures started to bring twigs
and branches from the poplar trees in the aviary up to their lofty platform
and put this nesting material in and around the lorry tyre. During this time
the pair mated some ten times a day, accompanied by loud hissing. As

time went on their mating activities increased and the birds defended their
nesting platform from intruders more vigorously. Immediately prior to
laying the female was mostly seen on the nest.
On the morning of 25th February 1980 the male was sitting tight on
the nest and screamed to warn me not to come too close; the female beat
her wings furiously. I realised, with much joy, that the expected egg had
been laid during the previous night. For some time after I watched the
nest only from a discreet distance. The birds settled down beautifully,
tending the egg at all times, the male usually sitting during the day and the
female at night. The male was generally more "houseproud" than the fe-
male, rolling the egg carefully and slowly until he was completely sub-
merged inside the tyre , completely sheltered from the prevailing winds.
Wien the pair changed over during the morning, they greeted each other
ceremoniously, on more than one occasion the male gave her a gentle
push to raise her from the nest. She always stepped out of the nest back-
wards, whilst the male entered from the front, often bringing fresh nest
material at the same time. This routine lasted 56 days, and on the 57th
day (21st April, 1980) a tiny, but very healthy chick hatched.
The parents' behaviour changed immediately and they literally com-
peted with each other to brood the newcomer; sometimes the female
crouched jealously over the chick and did not even allow the male to see
it. On the very first day, I did not observe any feeding but on the second
day I was able to witness two attempts at feeding when the female ob-
viously fed the chick with regurgitated liquids from her stomach. After
two days the male was finally allowed to brood the young one for a
short time, when the female went down to feed and drink. They moved
the chick eventually by slowly rocking sideways over it until it was in a
comfortable position, and only then did the birds slowly lower them-
selves into the nest. If the chick moved they got up immediately, in-
vestigated and then the whole procedure was repeated. All this took
quite some time and was executed in a very gentle manner.
On 13th May, after 22 days, I managed to see the chick's head for
the very first time, nibbling the female's beak. The head appeared grey,
but most striking were its huge dark eyes, which had long eyelashes.
May was a very warm month, with plenty of sunshine, and therefore
the parents stopped brooding the chick intensively after some 23 days.
They did not, however, leave the nest itself but stood on the rim of the

tyre and shielded the young bird from the intense sun with their enormous
wings. The little one at that stage kept popping its tiny head and neck up
and down and I could observe the beginning of a tiny ruff on its neck
which appeared like a little light knitted shawl.
On 29th May, after 5 Vi weeks, the chick stood up just for a moment
but soon afterwards sank into the nest again, obviously exhausted. Also
at that stage, it started to call to its parents when it could not see them,
when they appeared immediately and reassured the chick which contin-
ued to whimper. It was soon covered by the parent bird, and after a
satisfying feed all was well and it went happily to sleep. Again the male
brooded during the day, whilst the female took her turn at night, but not
before she regurgitated food for the young vulture. On 11thJune, after
seven weeks and 2 days, the chick was well on its feet and started to beat
its little wings, which had by that time some primaries peeping through
the quills, but not a single secondary or tail feather. The parents were no
longer brooding the chick during the daytime and only when it rained or
the chick was distressed and called, did the male do his "day duty".
But by a week later, even if it rained heavily, the young vulture, which
by now had grown considerably, was not brooded during the daytime and
all its whimpering was to no avail though the parents were never more than
a couple of feet away from the nest. On 19thJune, after 8 weeks and 3
days, the chick was still brooded at night, but only managed to put its
head, neck and shoulders under the female, and on more than one occas-
ion pulled the parent-bird off balance; it was most amusing to watch. The
chick was now fed twice a day only, generally in the morning, and then
again in the evening. On 4th J uly, after 10 Vi weeks, the chick was very
lively and suddenly managed to hop on the rim of the tyre but, obviously
bewildered, it hopped back inside its home soon afterwards and hid itself
from prying eyes.
On 17thJuly 1980, after 12 weeks and 3 days, the chick stood up in
the nest for at least two hours, and beat its wings frantically. That power-
ful exercise lifted the bird some 10 inches in the air, but it made sure
throughout that its feet stayed fairly central above the nest. It was by now
very well-feathered, and looked most handsome. It often struck out at its
parents' beaks in order to show its hunger. Now the parents started to
renew the nest interior, by constantly bringing new leafy branches and
beakfuls of fresh straw. The male obviously enjoyed preening his child and
these procedures took place often and lasted at least an hour. The chick
often protested by first whimpering and if that had no effect, by striking

a blow at his feet. Yet a gentle knock on the chick's head would persuade
it to keep still until the tail feathers had also been preened. I have never
observed the female doing similar duties, in fact the male showed much
more interest throughout the breeding cycle, often feeding the chick alone
or defending the site, whilst the mother was bathing or preening herself.
On the 2nd August, after 14 weeks and 5 days, the chick at last carefully
left the rim of the nest and balanced with outstretched wings on the nest
platform but not for long. It rushed back into the nest, stumbling all
over the place and losing its balance.
The chick had not been brooded at night for some time now and on
6th August, it did not roost in the nest, but some 10 feet away. Feeding
took place now only once a day, chiefly in the evenings. During feeding
time the young vulture watched its parents and all the other birds com-
peting for food, often running up and down the square platforms to get
a better view, head and neck extended to the full and its beak dribbling
with digestive juices. I often thought that it was about to take the plunge
and fly down to join its parents, but it held back at the very last second.
Wien the parents returned with full crops it would race towards, the nest,
often taking short cuts by flying or rather flapping across comers to
plunge into the nest, soliciting for food with loud cries and wing beating,
until it eventually got its fill. Afterwards it generally performed a long
toilet, and shortly afterwards fell asleep. The slightest distraction was
enough to send it hopping along the platform to investigate but having
lost interest, it resumed its sleep, often with one eye open. We often
played a little game with me watching the young vulture from the top
floor of the house, and the bird hiding completely in the nest. I would
then hide myself, and the small head of the bird would slowly appear but
only just far enough to see me. If it did, it would vanish again, if it did not,
its head and neck would pop up completely until it was literally craning
its neck to see my whereabouts.
The parents often took their young one for a walk with the female
leading the way, followed by the male and, much further back, the chick.
Their excursion took them from platform to platform via trees, etc., until
they reached their home again. The chick made attempts to enter the nest
but the female simply squatted in it with outstretched wings and would
not budge an inch which kept the baby out. They literally starved the
chick and on 16th August, after 16 weeks and 5 days, it finally plucked
up enough courage to fly down the 40 feet to join its parents at a fresh
carcass. Unfortunately it changed its mind halfway down and flew straight
through to the other end of the aviary and inevitably crashed into the wire

but it bounced back and landed on a platform halfway down. No harm
was done and after some 10 minutes making up its mind, it flew down to
feed with the rest of the birds. This, however, was no easy affair as it had
to compete for food now. Yet it managed to obtain some meat which was
tossed away by others. Afterwards it tried desperately to return back to
the nest but only just managed it after some two days. During that time
both parents watched the chick's movements intensively. It made many
attempts but landed in all the wrong places, either in the pool or in a
strange nest which it had to vacate instantly. Panting heavily, it found
shelter in an apple tree where it stayed for the rest of the night. All these
mistakes helped to strengthen the chick's muscles. When it finally managed
to fly up to the aviary's top platform on the opposite end to where the
nest was located, both parents flew at once to their chick to be re-united;
they were proud of their offspring's achievements. The female flew back
to the nest, followed by the male and some minutes later by the Griffon
chick. I have never observed any more feeding by the parents, in spite of
the chick's constant and persistent soliciting. During forthcoming feeding
times, all the vultures would assemble at their feeding area, except the
young vultures which still hoped to be fed as usual. When the parents
finally returned, it was already waiting eagerly in the nest, but in vain,
for it received nothing. In fact it was totally ignored. Some hours later
the parents flew down again to the feed trough and called the chick which
then followed and fed. As soon as the parents thought it time to return
home they took off and the chick went with them. Unfortunately, it
could not have had much to eat and had to wait until the next day, when
it was led down again. Yet it survived and grew up to be an immaculate
specimen nut brown in colour, the sure sign of its immaturity. It dis-
played a long brown ruff on top of its neck which was heavily covered
with woolly short feathers.
The young vulture is now 24 weeks old and takes its place in the
"pecking" order. It feeds, flys and lands as well as all my other birds.
The Griffons still live contentedly as a trio but the time must come when
the young one has to carve out a little territory of its own. The parents
have started mating already, and therefore a new breeding cycle will be
introduced.

Bombycilla cedrorurn
By D. LEWIS (Upminster, Essex)
Like the other two species in this genus, the Cedar Waxwing is a sleek,
crested bird with velvety plumage, mostly of a fawn colour with a yellow
tip to the tail. The name refers, of course, to the red sealing-wax-like tips
of the adults' secondaries. The adult Cedar Waxwings are l l A ins. long:
their call is a rather high trill. The Cedar Waxwing nests throughout the
woodlands of much of temperate North America and winters irregularly
southwards to northern South America.
Over a period of time I have obtained two Cedar Waxwings; I could not
tell if they were a pair due to the fact that both sexes are almost identical.
They are housed in a flight 9' x 9' x 6' adjoining a birdroom where they
have access to an inside flight measuring 6' x 3'. The outside flight is heavi-
ly planted with shrubs including Lonicera nitida, Privet, Spirea
Hedera, etc.
The other occupants of the flight are a pair of Lavender Finches, a pair
of Pintailed Nonpareils, and a pair of Chinese Painted Quail.
It was on 12th June, 1979, that the presumed cock (owing to the
broader yellow tip on the tail) was first seen feeding the hen; later in the
day they seemed to be looking for a suitable site for nesting, as the cock
was seen flying around with a strand of hay in his beak.
In the flight were open-fronted nest boxes and a disused Blackbird's
nest: these were ignored and instead the birds built their own nest contain-
ing hay, dried crocus leaves, fine roots, twigs and sheep's wool. The nest
was built in a large bush of Lonicera nitida', it was about one foot from the
front of the aviary and about four feet from the ground. It was in sight
which made it easy to keep a regular check on the proceedings.
Both of the birds started to take mealworms which were normally
ignored and also crushed cuttlefish "bone". On 19th June the hen was
seen sitting on the nest and the cock brought her food. On 22nd June,
when both birds entered the birdroom to feed, the nest was examined
and three blue-grey eggs with red markings were found. On 7th July,
fifteen days later, there were no signs of young, so on 12th July the

eggs were removed from the nest and they proved to be clear.
Two days later the hen started to lay again in the same nest and on
17th July the nest was examined and three more eggs were found. She
sat for a further thirteen days when the eggs were turned out of the nest;
these were also clear. On 31st July, the hen started to lay again, three
eggs were laid: this time she sat tightly on the nest, with the cock feeding
her. On 18th August, sixteen days later, two chicks were seen: they were
about the size of a newly-hatched sparrow. The father would only take
mealworms for the chicks; I tried him with crickets and maggots but they
were ignored. Luckily I keep mealworm cultures and was able to sort out
the soft and very small ones. Regular trips to some fields which are close
were made to collect insects; this was done by shaking small trees and
shrubs, the insects falling into an upturned umbrella. The easiest way of
feeding them to the birds was to empty them into a glass tank. The cock
took mainly the spiders and caterpillars. While the hen was sitting on the
nest, he did all of the feeding by regurgitating the food. By 26th August
the chicks were only eight days old and had already started to feather, and
at twelve days old they had their eyes open. The hen started to leave the
nest, collecting insects with the cock and helped him with the feeding.
When the chicks were sixteen days old, both of them were standing on
the rim of the nest. They were now fully feathered and fawn in colour
with two black stripes going from the base of the beak to the nape of the
neck; also there was a yellow band in line with the eye and the yellow tip
on the tail had started to take form. On 3rd September, when they were
seventeen days old, both chicks left the nest. The cock became more dom-
inant, feeding the young himself, and seemed to be keeping the hen away
from them.
The next day he was not taking as many mealworms as he had previous-
ly done and when some chopped grapes were put into the aviary, he start-
ed to feed these to the chicks instead. When they were nineteen days old,
they were close rung and at the age of twenty-two days they started to
feed themselves, but the father was still partly feeding them.
When they were four weeks old, they started to change colour; they
became darker like the adult birds but had speckled chests. The chicks
also became aware of the food being put into the aviary and fed from it
straight away, the diet being chopped grape, pear, pyracantha berries and
a mixture of boiled dates, sultanas and apple (a great favourite with my
softbills) as well as a softbill food. At the time of writing (30th October,

BREEDING ZOSTEROPS
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.9953299375" page_id="56283794"  page_num="70" year="" vol="">
By L. GIBSON, (Burnaby, British Columbia)
Zosterops, or White Eyes, are widely distributed. They range all over
(sub) tropical Asia, and some are found in Africa, Australia (where they
are called Silvereyes), New Zealand (where they are called Waxeyes) and
Hawaii, where they are called a few other things by fruitgrowers.
Zosterops with an "s" is, of course, the scientific name, and is used as
the singular or plural. I have heard of a single bird being quaintly referred
to as a "Zosterop" (in Britain!).
As they are small, peaceful and easy to cater for, they are popular with
aviculturists. Their popularity has led to a stream of sporadic breedings
over the years, but with the usual limited success of softbills. As they have
been written about frequently, I will confine these notes to brief reviews
of the nestings.
A pair of birds, almost certainly Zosterops palpebrosa, nested here for
the past three years, until the hen died. The cock is alive and well in some-
one else's aviary.

Sexing
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.974016357142857" page_id="56283794"  page_num="70" year="" vol="">
These yellowish Zosterops can be sexed by appearance during the
breeding season. The cock is noticeably brighter than the hen, especially
about the head and breast but they have to be seen together for this. Prob-
ably most of the numerous species could be sexed this way too.
The birds keep in constant touch by uttering a long, penetrating whist-
le, the hen being noticeably higher pitched than the cock. This is a good
way to pick a pair, if they are not in breeding colour, or where some of the
greyer species may look alike.The birds should be separated, when they
will immediately call to one another.
Nests
The secret of getting these birds to nest is to supply soft, fluffy mater-
ials and cobwebs. Horsehair is also highly utilised.
The nest is a very deep cup, the depth (4 cm - H4") almost equalling
the diameter (4.2 cm - 1.5/8").

<bodyText confidence="0.976563771428571" page_id="56283795"  page_num="71" year="" vol="">
All the nests were made of dog fur, polypropylene aquarium filter
wool, or horsehair. Horsehair was usually used as a basic and the other
materials were then incorporated, especially to pad the base. Cotton wool
and human hair were also used, but these are undesirable. Some lichen was
used, but only a very few grass strands were ever incorporated in the struc-
tures. Cobweb is highly desired and very useful, and unfortunately this was
only supplied in the last nesting season (1978).
The earliest building commenced on 7th April and the latest on 22nd
July. One-third of the nests were built in a canary basket, and the rest
were slung on vegetation with no bottom support. Most of the latter tilted
to some degreee and were shored up with twigs.
The heights at which the nests were placed ranged from 3 ft (1 m) to 8^
ft (2.59 m). The maximum height available was 10 ft. Second clutches
could be in the same nest, or in a new nest.
Eggs
The nest only holds three eggs comfortably. A fourth egg lies on top.
Two to four eggs are laid, but the average of all the clutches was three.
Five clutches were laid one year, with a total of 15 eggs. The tiny eggs are
very pale blue and measure 15 x 12 mm. Of all my birds, the Zosterops'
eggs were by far the most erratic in incubation time and in hatchability.
They were the only species that regularly produced clear eggs along with
good ones. The average hatch was 70%; normally I get 100% hatch with
softbills.
Incubation averaged 11 days, with a few strange aberrations. A clutch
of two eggs took 14 and 15 days, and another clutch of two hatched three
days apart. A normal clutch will hatch on two successive days at the
and small clutches hatch on the same day. Only the hen was seen to incu-
bate.
Chicks
A newly-hatched chick weighs about 1 g and is pink and downless. A
two-week old chick weighed 6.25 g, and an adult of this species is about
8.25 g in breeding condition.
The chicks are fed principally on live food, but fruit is used regularly
from 5-7 days on. On at least one occasion I saw a one-day old chick
getting a tiny piece of orange.

L. GIBSON - BREEDING ZOSTEROPS
Healthy, well-fed chicks leave the nest in only nine or ten days, just
like Pekin Robin chicks. Occasionally they will take up to 12 days, but
longer than this means serious nutritional defects.
Zosterops chicks can only be induced to beg by the parents. Their
diminutive size makes force feeding difficult. The result of this was that
I never got more than two or three supplementary feeds into any chick,
and then only by luck, whereas I normally handfeed all softbill chicks
every day from day two at least until their eyes open, and usually longer.
I got a higher proportion of poor feathering among Zosterops chicks than
with others, and I attribute this to the lack of supplementary feeding.
These chicks invariably feathered perfectly within four months, feeding
by themselves on the normal diet.
When they fledge, the chicks are plain grey with little cream coloured
bibs. They cannot fly, but can climb and cling well. They are difficult
to see, and remain still to avoid detection. They also keep very quiet and
only cheep softly when a parent lands nearby with food. At first they
hide very low down but work up higher as their flying ability improves.
They remain well hidden for at least three weeks, but change hiding
places frequently. By 25 days they can fly very well and are usually found
very high up, and can be seen moving around more.
Both parents feed equally when the chicks are in the nest, and the cock
takes his turn to brood them. The cock takes over the feeding until the
chicks are a month old, when the hen is nesting again.
The earliest I saw a chick feed itself was at 26 days. The chicks moult
gradually into the adult colour by three to four months.
The mortality amongst very young chicks was extremely high, and was
from undetermined causes. A chick that died at eight days had a ball of
human hair in its stomach (from the nest lining). Human hair was not
supplied after that. Cotton wool is also bad for getting into beaks.
Feeding
Although Zosterops are generally lumped in with fruit and nectar
feeders, they are mainly insectivorous. They are fond of soft fruit and nec-
tar, but the consumption of these drops sharply when the birds are nest-
ing, and they become almost wholly insectivorous if given the chance. I
have watched flocks of wild birds work their way up the trunk of small
trees, checking for insects under all the leaves on the way up. They flew

from the top of the tree down to the trunk of the next one, and so on.
Most soft sweet fruits are eaten, but the tiny beak limits the scope of this.
They can damage fruit crops by piercing fruits such as papaya or pear,
making them unmarketable, rather than inedible. The birds are seldom
present in sufficient numbers to do any great damage. They take nectar
from flowers, but are not dependent on this.
The adults were maintained on rice pudding, banana, orange and milk
nectar. Pear was popular, as were, of course, any small insects. Mealworms
were eaten, but they are on the tough side for these little birds.
By far the most successful nestings came after I started giving wasp
grubs. These are ideal in consistency for the chicks, and the adults scarcely
ate anything else when they were available. Smooth caterpillars and spiders
were also favoured, and the chicks also got a few fruitflies.
One report (Avicultural Magazine, Vol 84, No. I, pp. 2-4) stated that
Zosterops fed small earthworms to their chicks. This was not only unusual
but very lucky, as earthworms are an excellent food, to say nothing of the
ease with which they can be obtained. I tried feeding worms to a number
of Zosterops after reading this, but there was no response whatsoever, as
might be expected from an arboreal bird. It would be interesting to hear if
others have tried this.
General
When nesting is over, the parents will happily live with the chicks. All
the birds sleep in a tight bunch side by side. However, chicks should be
removed at a month old, if the parents are re-nesting. Nesting adults will
not tolerate other Zosterops in the aviary but will flock outside of the
breeding season. They do not bother other nesting birds, except to pilfer
nest material. The Zosterops nested along with the following species,
which were also nesting: Gouldians, Pekin Robins, Honeycreepers ( Cyan-
erpes) and Blackcaps Sylvia atricapilla . None of these interfered with the
other.
The song is a long and pretty, though quiet warble. The male sang
throughout the incubation period, and he did this as far away from the
nest as possible. He was quiet (and busy) when the chicks hatched.
Zosterops are not good homers. Two fairly tame males got out one
day and they did not even hang around. They were never seen again.
In general, they are easily kept birds with many virtues and no vices.

Agapomis earn
By F.C. BARNICOAT (Johannesburg, South Africa)
It now seems wise to call this delightful lovebird by the above name
rather than 'Madagascar' Lovebird. The latter name is the usual one with
fanciers in South Africa and probably elsewhere, yet one gets an uncom-
fortable feeling that the name should be up-dated to 'Malagasy' Lovebird!
'Grey-headed' is the current term with ornithologists and is entirely appro-
priate, being the direct translation of the Latin scientific name cam, which
was given to this species of the genus Agapomis by Gmelin in 1788.
My pair was bought in Natal at the end of 1977 shortly after they had
left the nest. The young of this species show the marked sexual dimor-
phism, which characterises it, while in the nest at the early stage when the
feathers on their heads first start to open out. This is a great advantage
not shared by the more commonly kept and bred species of lovebird, i.e.,
the Peach-faced and the four "eye-ring species", in which there is no
reliable external difference between the sexes even in the fully adult bird;
or to the two species that are readily sexable after they have assumed adult
plumage, i.e. Red-faced (Angolan) and Black-winged (Abyssinian). The
number of species in the bird world that have the advantage of being easily
sexed before they leave the nest is minimal.
The Grey-headed Lovebird has figured in aviculture for over 100 years.
One of the earliest English writers on aviculture, C.W. Gedney, in his
"Foreign Cage Birds" (around 1875) has a chapter on Lovebirds, obviously
referring to the Red-faced, but says in passing: "Recently English dealers
have received a lavender-headed lovebird from New Guinea (sic) and these
have realised good prices and shown themselves able to bear the severity of
our climate." It is virtually certain that the Grey-headed was the second of
the lovebirds to be kept in captivity. It was one of the famous Dr. W.T.
Greene's "Birds I have kept in years gone by " (1885). He found it "Much
nicer, more interesting and hardier than the Red-faced" and mentions no
other lovebird. Cassell's " Illustrated Book of Canaries and Cagebirds,
British and Foreign" has its foreign section contributed by that very
widely experienced and accurate observer, A.F. Wiener, who kept birds on
an extensive scale in Germany before moving to England and who was a
Vice President of the Avicultural Society from 1899 to 1906. Writing in

this book in the edition of the late 1880s, Wiener says of Agapomis earn :
"Until about five years ago, they were rare, but notwithstanding their con-
siderable price found willing purchasers, and as a consequence they are
now imported in large numbers. Although I have not been fortunate
enough to breed this parrakeet successfully, I obtained from various pairs
numerous eggs, and other amateurs have bred them freely." In the same
book a mere four lines are devoted to the Rosy-faced Lovebird to the
effect that they had been bred on the Continent with remarkable ease by
Dr. Russ and others, but none were as yet to be seen in England. This
third lovebird species was about to burst on the avicultural scene and to
oust the Grey-headed mainly because of the ease with which it repro-
duced.
The Grey-headed Lovebird is by no means rare in its natural habitat
and they were certainly "imported in large numbers". A dealer's advertise-
ment in the journal Bird Notes , of 1909, states: "Madagascar Lovebirds -
3/6d. per pair", a far cry from the occasional advertisement for this species
by a present day dealer in Cage and Aviary Birds of 1980 which puts the
price at #100! It is obvious that despite substantial importations in the
past this lovebird species has not prospered in Europe as most of the other
species have done, which made sensational first appearances on the avicul-
tural scene many years afterwards, all well described and depicted with
consummate skill in the pages of the Avicultural Magazine : the Black-
cheeked (April 1908), the Abyssinian (March 1909), the Nyasa (11 Feb.
1926), the Masked (June 1927) and lastly the Fischer's (October 1927).
With the exception of the Abyssinian they all soon proved to be among
the easiest of all wild birds to propagate in captivity. This continues to be
so, and today several species are being bred in an ever increasing number
of colour mutations. Exceptions to this pattern are the Grey-headed, the
Black-winged and that extraordinarily problematical breeder, the Red-
faced. These latter are more challenging avicultural subjects, and it seems
that the Grey-headed has never done well in Europe, where it is said to
dislike the indoor conditions that must be employed for much of the
year and it has never caught on like the more easily bred species, or
become properly established.
Agapornis cana has figures in South African aviculture for many years,
but it has only been available sporadically and is comparatively expensive.
They are much prized on the show bench, though steady examples are
few and far between, most of them having the habit of scuttling into a
corner of the show cage especially when exhibited in pairs. In his book

F. C. BARNICOAT - BREEDING THE GREY-HEADED LOVEBIRD
"Aviculture in South Africa " (1959) Herbert Hambly Parker reported that
the two pairs he had kept were prolific breeders, the secret being that they
did not fancy a box but readily hollowed out a sisal stump. The proximity
of Malagasy to South Africa has enabled quite a number of South African
fanciers to obtain pairs of these lovebirds in the past and breeding suc-
cesses have occurred in many collections, especially in Natal and the East-
ern Cape coastal districts where climatic conditions most approximate to
those of their natural habitat in Malagasy. There is a particular need for
some enterprising South African aviculturists to specialise in this species
and build up sound stocks because it is becoming increasingly unlikely
that any more wild-caught birds will be forthcoming from present day
Malagasy.
Subspecies
There is the nominate race Agapomis earn cana and one subspecies,
Agapomis cam ablectanea , which comes from the drier south-western
corner of Malagasy. Ablectanea shows a rather darker and more bluish
green in both sexes, but especially on the back and wings of the male,
which then gives a stronger contrast with the lighter green of the body.
The green on the body is also less yellowish than in the nominate race,
and the grey head of the male is paler and more lavender in tone. My own
pair definitely belongs to the nominate race, but I reckon that I have seen
both forms in recent times and prefer ablectanea. The only meaning I am
able to find for ablectanea is "selected or gathered away from". It is
desirable that breeders should follow this advice, anyway, and develop
separate strains of the two subspecies if possible, rather than mingle them
indiscriminately.

Mine live mainly on the various millets and plain canary seed, showing
preference for the smaller types and in particular for spray millet. Sun-
flower seed appeared to be too large for them, and their beaks are con-
siderably smaller than those of other lovebirds commonly kept. After
much perseverance I have got them to enjoy soaked canary seed and
eventually they have begun to take germinating sunflower seed. They
might be fond of hemp, but that is not available in South Africa.
I have not succeeded in getting mine to take apple or other fruit or
softfood of any sort, but they are passionately fond of greenfood pegged
at perch level. Chickweed is their favourite. Seeding grasses just at the
ripening stage surpasses all other foods in popularity. The grass that

bears the scientific name Panicum kevifolium grows here in the late
summer and is usually permitted a place in my garden. It is when a
bunch of this grass is fastened up that the Grey-headed Lovebirds really
come to life and excitedly nibble the tiny seeds with exquisite daintiness
of movement.
Oyster shell grit and grated cuttlefish supply their calcium require-
ment and my pair adores to be sprayed with a hose set very fine. They
ruffle their feathers and swing round on the perch, often pausing upside
down and opening out their wings to let the water reach their bodies.
Breeding
I housed my pair in an aviary 2.3 m long and 2 m wide, and 1.3 m of
the length was taken up by the shelter, which has a fibre glass front to
ensure it is relatively light. By using the large door of the shelter to close
the birds in at night these lovebirds were soon trained to sleep under
cover, and unlike many other birds they do not revert to sleeping in the
flight if given the chance. They like the flight in the late afternoon but
never fail to retire into the shelter as the last of the light fades. Their
aviary flight contains a weeping mulberry tree to which they do sur-
prisingly little damage. They make some of their nesting material from
its leaves by nibbling around the outline of each leaf several times to
form pieces of greenery shaped like a large letter C. Most of these pieces
are taken into the nest boxes, but some are dropped on the ground.
The skill they show in cutting out these regular shapes is amazing.
Before I got around to building them some larger nest boxes they went
down in the L-shaped boxes I normally use for Gouldians, and they have
continued to find these attractive. In these boxes I have tried a few centi-
metres of peat and wood shavings, which so far they have for the most
part removed. When mulberry leaves were not available they carried lawn
clippings into their box, though not in sufficient quantity to prevent
their eggs from lying on the bare wood. My most successful nest was pro-
duced when the pair took over a box that I had filled with grass for a
pair of Gouldians. They enlarged the hollow I had shaped, and gradually
the grass was reduced to very tiny pieces and the remains were eventually
scratched into a tiny pile in the corner by the chicks.
The pair nested twice in 1978, in May and August. The hen disappears
into the box and must surely be fed by the cock. She will remain in the
box when it is taken down for inspection and will have to be lifted out or

moved aside if the eggs are to be seen. The hens I have had also appear to
pluck some of their feathers when they nest, so that they appear a sorry
sight. Despite the closeness with which the hen incubated in her first year,
none of the eggs hatched. They all contained embryos which had perished
at various stages. At the time I was tempted to deduce theories as to why
the eggs had failed to hatch, but subsequent events seem to indicate that
it was merely a case of the hen being inexperienced and addling her eggs
one by one.
Success came under the same conditions in 1979. The first egg was
laid on 5th April, followed by another three on alternate days. On
28th April I heard a soft chattering sound coming from the nest box
and at noon the hen left the nest briefly, enabling me to look. There was
one baby covered in short white down lying quietly between three eggs.
This would give an incubation period of 22 or 23 days. Of the extras
provided, soaked spray millet was the only one accepted. The other eggs
hatched and through the ensuing month the babies developed in four
distinct sizes, indicating that incubation commences from the laying
of the first egg. As they reached the stage of acquiring head feathers
they could be sexed as a hen, then a cock, then a second hen and finally
a second cock. Within six weeks all four had left the nest and could fly
well, although some of them were somewhat lacking in body feathers,
having possibly been plucked. These feathers quickly grew once the
youngsters were flying.
With the coming of spring, the hen took over the nest box filled with
grass for the Gouldians (described above) and laid six eggs, the first of
which hatched on 9th September, followed by all the others at about
two-day intervals. This large family was notable for the different stages
of development its members showed - "steps and stairs", as the saying
runs. All went well for a month, when the hen suddenly lost the use of
her legs and deteriorated rapidly to the stage where she had to be placed
in a small cage. All treatment failed and she died five days later. I faced
up to the prospect of handfeeding the six babies. However it was soon
obvious that the father was continuing to feed. I was able to stop giving
any assistance at all, and this time there was no plucking, so that the
babies left the nest in perfect feather, the last one on 29th October.
Their father was wonderfully devoted and would always carefully shep-
herd all six - four daughters and two sons - into the shelter each evening.

This year I have been attempting to establish another breeding pair,
but the young hens have so far addled their clutches of four eggs. Perhaps,
like their mother, they will do better in their second year.
Most of the ten offspring were spread around amongst friends and more
than half of these have already died, which seems to support the words of
G.A. Smith: "Once the Madagascar Lovebirds stopped coming in from the
wild, despite their supposed prolificacy, they became extremely scarce,
unequivocally proving that Madagascar Lovebirds die with a much greater
enthusiasm than ever they breed." It is now unlikely any more will be
coming in from the wild and, therefore, all the more to be hoped that this
delightful species will find aviculturists willing to concentrate on it and
build up viable stocks before the door of opportunity finally closes. From
what I can gather many Grey-headed Lovebirds succumb somewhat
suddenly and unexpectedly when in good health, and they seem to me to
be particularly nervous and sensitive birds which panic at the slightest
disturbance. This causes a high proportion to be lost as a result of night
frights. No doubt there are other reasons, too, why they are hard to es-
tablish.
Compatibility with other birds
As aviary space for my collection is, alas, at a premium, I have been
tempted to try to find suitable aviary companions for my pair so that
more than one species might live and prosper in the same aviary. In this
matter I knew that I was being optimistic, because the whole lovebird
family is notorious for biting off the toes of other birds. E.N.T. Vane in
Guide to Lovebirds and Parrotlets (1958) says of the Madagascar: "they
are spiteful and dangerous companions for any bird approaching anything
near their own size." My experiments have caused me not a little grief.
A pair of Gouldians did well with them for a time, but when their babies
left the nest the lovebirds bit their feet, so that all lost at least one toe and
two died as a result of their injuries, including the adult cock. Yet Bengal-
ese have lived and bred with them for two years, and apart from some of
their babies having once been plucked of the tail feathers during the first
few days after leaving the nest, no other damage was done to them. The
same may be said of Violet-eared Waxbills, Cuban Finches and Cape Can-
aries which have been housed with them from time to time. Yet every
young Gouldian I bred in the aviaries on either side of the lovebirds had
at least one missing toenail, which must have been nipped off when they
were clinging to the wire. This necessitated double-wiring the partitions
on both sides. It seems probable that certain species are quick enough to

escape injury from the lovebirds, whereas the Gouldian is not; or the
lovebirds could be aggressive to the colour green in which they see a rival.
I certainly doubt that they could be kept with similar small parrot-like
birds.
This year, being short of space, I risked leaving the father and two of
his daughters in their aviary. I was warned and feared that, once the pros-
pect of breeding arose, violent quarrels might result. However they seemed
to prosper as a trio. The cock fed both hens, and each selected a nest box
on opposite sides of the shelter wall, laid and incubated four fertile eggs,
within a fortnight of each other. As recorded above, these eggs seem to
have been addled one by one. Interesting though the experiment was, I
remained nervous of this trio living together, though all evidence recom-
mended a continuance of such an arrangement. I might have removed one
of the hens as spring approached, but the decision was not left in my
hands. In June one of the hens, which I had watched fly in to roost in
perfect health the previous night, was found dead early next morning and
probably died of concussion caused by a night fright. Several fanciers to
whom I have spoken maintain that this lovebird breeds best when several
pairs are kept separately but in nearby aviaries where they can hear each
other, and that a single pair seldom breeds. My experience does not
support this view, of course, but the whole genus is gregarious and I can
well believe that breeding pairs might be stimulated by the presence of
others in the vicinity.

By M. LUBBOCK (Assistant Director - Aviculture -
The Wildfowl Trust, Gloucestershire.
Expeditions to collect waterfowl from foreign countries are becoming
more difficult as years go by, not only in getting permission to collect, but
also in the amount of money needed. An expedition to catch adult birds is
almost prohibited by the expense, the bird losses that occur and the time
required to establish the adult birds in their new environment to breed
(two or three years). In recent years, expeditions involving the Wildfowl
Trust have favoured collecting hatching eggs and transporting them in
portable incubators. The advantage of egg collection is that the young are
hatched and reared in the environment in which they will be living and
breeding. In nearly all cases, the young which have been reared in this
manner are bred from much quicker than any wild-caught bird. The only
disadvantage from eggs is that the sexes of the young which hatch are
unpredictable and it is possible to end up with all the same sex. Taking
eggs from the wild is not necessarily depleting the adult population for
the sake of the expedition. Only one or two eggs are taken from each
clutch to keep the blood lines different. Due to the mortality that occurs
in the wild, the parent bird would probably raise the same number of
young whether one took two eggs or left them to hatch. Some of the
unique waterfowl of Australia have always been of great interest to the
Wildfowl Trust and when permission was granted for us to collect in
Western Australia, we were delighted. Egg collection seemed the best
method for the expedition.
The trip proved successful, with the planning and delicate timing
working well. Although it was a very dry year and not considered a very
good breeding season, most of the required eggs were found. The trip
was made much easier by the invaluable help from the personnel of the
Fisheries and Wildlife Department of Western Australia and the Director
of the Perth Zoo. The eggs had to be individually wrapped in the incubator
as there was great size difference between the Pink-eared and Musk Ducks.
The eight Blue-billed Duck eggs collected were fresh, so did not need to
be packed in the incubator. I accompanied the eggs by Boeing 747 from
Perth to London with one stop at Bombay. Before my trip, the airline
found that there was only one seat on the 747 with enough room by my
side.

M. LUBBOCK - REARING RARE DUCKS
On arrival at Slimbridge, the eggs were transferred from the portable
incubator to forced air incubators. All 40 of the Pink-eared Duck eggs
hatched and 10 out of the 12 Musk Duck eggs hatched. The fresh Blue-
billed Duck eggs did not do as well and only four out of the eight hatched.
Owing to strict regulations, the eggs had to be hatched and the young
reared in the new quarantine facilities which had recently been built at
Slimbridge. The most up-to-date methods of rearing difficult species of
waterfowl were incorporated in building the quarantine station.
The Pink-eared Duck
The Pink-eared Ducks proved the most difficult birds to rear. They
were very small and delicate, looking like miniature adults, especially
their bills with skin flaps on each side. Tom Spence, Director of the Perth
Zoo, had experience in rearing Pink-eared and had told us how difficult
it was. His only successful diet was a wet mixture of trout pellets. The
young ducklings wanted to sift everything through the water and dried
food seemed totally unpalatable.
Not all the ducklings hatched at the same time. Some were over three
weeks apart. The diet was obviously insufficient for the first ducklings
being reared and their growth rates were slow. The wet mixture was given
to them in a small chick drinker, with the jar in the middle of the pan,
only allowing a small area around the jar for food. This stopped the duck-
lings from becoming completely caked with food, as there was only room
for their bills to reach the food. The trout pellets contained enough oil to
hinder their waterproofing, which alone caused considerable stress and
discomfort. The diet caused constipation, so various other foods were
added to the trout pellets, even blood worms and daphnia.
After many frustrating trials and experiments with diets, some
losses occurred. A basic diet of chick crumbs proved the best balanced diet
with the correct proteins, but even the chick crumbs varied between manu-
facturers. Many marketed crumbs contained too much husk and roughage,
causing impaction of the gizzard. Only after grinding each brand of chick
crumb and sieving did we find one free from husks. The starter cmmb was
fed in a shallow pan very close to their drinker and the ducklings' method
was not to take the crumbs to the water, but the water to the crumbs, so
that they would puddle the food.
The post mortem showed the experimental diets of trout pellets, etc.,
were unbalanced in proteins and lacking in calcium and vitamin B. The
bone of some of the 3-4 week old ducklings was very soft and flexible.

From the 40 eggs collected, 20 birds have been reared to maturity.
The Musk Duck
The Musk Duck proved very hardy and the most unusual of the water-
fowl family to rear. The duckling is fairly large, very robust and aggressive.
The down is black apart from a white chest and stomach and acquires a
texture more like fur than feather. The enormous bill seems nearly out of
proportion to the head. The bill is dark grey to black, but underneath it is
a light orange with an orange mandible. A similar colour inside the beak
proved to be significant in rearing the young.
The aggressiveness of the young soon proved a great difficulty in rear-
ing. A newly-hatched Musk Duck was set upon and killed by a three day
old bird. This meant that all the young Musk Ducks had to be reared in
separate compartments . They also had to be hand-fed for several weeks
before they would feed themselves out of a dish. However, if food was
dropped in the water, especially mealworms or crickets, they would soon
devour them. Chick crumbs were difficult to hand-feed and soaked trout
and dog pellets were preferred. The young Musk Ducks were raised in
much the same way as we raise Stiff-tailed Ducks at Slimbridge, on water
with access to a small sloping area under an overhead heater.
The young Musk Ducks were very vocal and they have a very large
range of peculiar sounds compared to other waterfowl. Many waterfowl
authorities who heard the recorded tapes of the young Musk Duck mis-
identified them and thought they were of an animal, usually a cat.
From watching Musk Duck feeding in the wild, I learnt that the young
are reared separately and not in a brood. Clutch size seems to be only
two, occasionally three, and one is not uncommon. A fourth duckling
would rarely survive.
After the young hatch, they are kept in the nest territory in clumps
of rash and sedge, but apart from one another. The female takes food to
the young which beg, their orange mandibles very plainly directing the
female's delivery of food. Their tremendous vocal range helps to lead
the female to the position of the young.
From the 12 Musk Duck eggs brought back, 10 hatched successfully,
and six have been reared to maturity. The four which died as they were
becoming adolescent were lacking in vitamins, like the Pink-eared Ducks,
so the dog biscuits and trout pellet diet was soon altered to a rearers' or

growers' pellet on which they thrived. They still get moist dog biscuit,
but trout pellet has been removed from their diet.
The Blue-billed Duck
Fresh eggs never seem to travel as well as incubated eggs so it was no
surprise that only four out of the eight Blue-billed Duck eggs hatched.
These young were raised very easily on a diet of millet, canary seed and a
few of the same brand of chick crumbs that we had found good for the
Pink-eared Ducks. Duckweed normally makes up a good proportion of the
diet for rearing stiff-tailed ducks, but it was very difficult to obtain in
midwinter in England. However, small amounts were found and given as
well. Unfortunately all the Blue-billed Ducks were males.
One of the important factors to emerge from the rearing of these
three species is that various forms of food such as trout pellets are inade-
quate in vitamins for waterfowl. During manufacture of the pellets, many
of the vitamins said to be in the end-product are destroyed by heating to
200*F, although they were added at the beginning of the process. The
only adequate foods are those that have been developed for the poultry
industry, a big universal concern, which has spent much time and money
in developing the best food to grow a healthy chick. Even these have to be
scrutinised as certain drugs added to some foods can be harmful to ducks.
The labels on the food bags give this warning.
No matter how difficult the ducklings seem to be in the initial rearing
stages, if they can be weaned onto chick crumbs at the earliest opportun-
ity, a healthy duck with all the required vitamins will result. The subse-
quent switch from crumbs to rearer pellets will be easier, and on to
breeder pellets when the bird is adult. More of the Pink-eared Ducks would
have been reared if we had fed chick crumbs only, without husks, from the
beginning.

By L. GIBSON (Burnaby, British Columbia)
Blue-naped Mousebirds were again bred in 1979 and some additional
information was noted, as well as some interesting differences in breeding
behaviour from that seen in the 1978 season. It is fairly certain that a
reliable sex difference has been found.
Three of the original four adult birds were brought back from the local
zoo on the 16th June. As they had nested late in 1978 (September) it was
thought that they might produce some chicks during the quiet end of the
season. As it turned out there was no quiet period, and at one point there
were three species on eggs at once. The Mousebirds nested from July to
September and Chloropsis continued to nest later than colius. In spite of
long though intermittent observation, there remain unresolved questions
about the Mousebirds.
General
Observations were made in the same aviary as last year (Avicultural
Magazine Vol. 85, No. 3) and the birds were seen to have a water bath for
the first and only time. The aviary was hosed frequently during a pro-
longed dry spell. Some large phlox plants were thoroughly wetted. All the
birds jumped on to the wide flower heads, and with wings outstretched,
they wriggled in the wet flowers. They only succeeded in getting their
underparts slightly wet, and the whole thing was rather brief. They con-
tinued to bathe regularly in dry earth. A bird would wriggle itself into a
depression, then it shuffled forward for an inch or two. It then backed up
and repeated this several times. Like most other activities, this was carried
out in a group. Birds denied access to dry earth or sand get quite tacky,
especially on their long tails. The birds were still not seen to drink water,
but they took copious draughts of milk nectar, which they sucked up in
pigeon fashion.
When the first eggs were laid, the two non-brooding birds roosted to-
gether on the aviary wire. However, after the first chicks had fledged, one
of the adults slept beside the next nest, just like last year. At night, one
fledged chick was seen sleeping cushioned between the wire and the
adult's breast. It was sitting crosswise on top of the adult. At other times
all the non-nesters were hanging in a tight bunch at night. They always
slept at the highest point, and beneath a narrow beam. Plastic sheeting

was put above the spot. They never used the shelter or vegetation.
Sexing
The careful comparisons of tail lengths made last year were all in vain.
All the adults produced new tails of identical length and 4 cm. longer than
the old ones, being now 24 cm When the birds were being caught
up at the zoo, one was picked as a possible hen because of a slightly smal-
ler beak and feet. However, this "smaller" bird proved to be the heaviest
at 52.8 g, the other being 49.1-50.2 g. Also at this time one bird was seen
to have a very prominent cloaca, and we thought "this is it". By the time
all the birds were caged, that one could not be found. It was noticed later
that when a Colius defaecates, the cloacal area protrudes considerably,
then it goes back to normal usually immediately, but may protrude for a
little while before or after. This left the higher pitched whistle as a means
of picking a hen. While this comparison still applies, it is difficult to do
and is further complicated by the fact that juveniles also have a higher
pitched call. When the birds were caught to be returned to the zoo in
October, the adults were banded to enable them to be distinguished from
the chicks. They were examined closely, then suddenly a difference be-
came apparent. The same one as before was thought to be a hen because
its beak had slightly less depth than the other two, which had identical
beaks. The colour was the same in all. Then it was seen that the hen had
different eyes! It was the only bird to have a narrow greyish band around
the outside of the brown iris. The two other adults and all the chicks had
identical dark reddish-brown irides. This was only obvious when the birds
were hand held. The birds were caged indoors prior to being taken to the
zoo the next day. That night their roosting arrangements further con-
firmed the above idea. The hen and one cock slept in one comer of the
flight cage, while the other cock and all the chicks bunched in another
comer. Surely more than a coincidence, for when not breeding all the
birds slept in one big group. However, after being disturbed for examina-
tion, they did just that. The fourth adult and the 1978 chick at the zoo
were also examined. As was now suspected, the remaining adult was in-
deed a hen. The year-old chick's eyes were at a halfway stage, so the
light band must take more than a year to develop fully. Because of the
band, a hen's eye looks both smaller and lighter than the eye of a male.
The birds will later be examined outside of the breeding season to see if
the eye difference is permanent.
Nesting
The aviary was initially shared by a pair of Babblers Turdoides jardinei
who had a nest and a chick in the bushy shelter. They kept the Colius to

the sparsely planted outer half. As there were no suitable nesting sites for
the Colius , a wicker canary basket, 4" (10 cm) in diameter, by 2" (5 cm)
deep, was wired to three vertical rambling rose canes. The nest was at a
height of only 40" (1 m), and hard against a stone wall. It was half filled
with dry turf, and a slight depression was made in the centre. The next
morning, a bird had obligingly deposited an egg in the nest, which was
left exactly as I made it. The Babblers were taken out that day. By the
following day the basket had been filled to well above the brim with more
turf, and the egg mysteriously remained on top. At least 1W' (3 cm) of
turf had been added and only one egg was laid. The other two nests were
built on top of an old birch trunk in the shelter, at the maximum height
available (T, 2m). Last year the trunk had been hollowed out slightly,
specifically for the Mousebirds, and it was gratifying that they finally
used it. The nest was just under the clear acrylic roof. A basket on the
original nesting site in the weigela bush was ignored. The birds ate scar-
cely any of the weigela leaves this year.
The Mousebirds remained secretive about nesting. When they decide
to build, it is done quickly and discreetly. The construction of the
second nest was not seen, and it disappeared after the chicks left. By
this time, the aviary was being shared by a pair of Silver-beaked Tanagers
R. carbo , a sham a chick and three Chloropsis aurifrons. The nest was
probably dismantled by the latter, as they had been observed to do this
before in their constant search for insects. The third nest was built on
the same spot, in just one afternoon, and an egg was laid the following
morning. The nests were made of dry turf, but the third nest had a
number of dry grass stems incorporated in the shallow walls.

Eggs and Incubation

<bodyText confidence="0.999867846153846" page_id="56283813"  page_num="87" year="" vol="">
The eggs averaged 20 x 16 mm, which is small for a 50 g bird. By
comparison, Shama eggs are 22.5 x 17 mm. The markings were dark
chocolate brown and rather heavier than the red-brown marks on last
year's eggs, so perhaps a different hen was involved. The three clutches
of one, two and three eggs were laid in July, August and September, and
all hatched. The exact incubation time of Colius eggs has been missed
by just about everyone because of the secretive and speedy nesting, and
I fared no better last year. This year, however, it was finally established
at WA days. This is the shortest incubation I have come across. It
would seem that nests are traditionally examined in the morning only,
if they are examined at all. Thus eggs are invariably reported as hatch-
ing early in the morning, and incubation times are based on this. One has
to define incubation time, of course, and I measure it as being the time

taken for the last egg to hatch, providing a normal healthy chick emerges.
This last part is important, as occasionally the last egg in a clutch will
hatch prematurely, but the chick usually dies quickly. Actually the second
last egg gives consistent timing, but the eggs then have to be marked in
case some are infertile. Of course, if some do not hatch, this also precludes
timing the last egg, if they were not marked. It is pointless to base incuba-
tion periods on anything other than the last two eggs, if more than two
are laid. Hatching times for softbills are often given as 12-14 days, but
there is never this much variation in one species. Delayed incubation on
the first two eggs is the reason for the apparent spread. This season (1979)
all nests were examined at least twice a day, either at 8 a.m. or noon
(usually both), and again between 5 and 7 p.m. Incubation times were thus
narrowed down to 12-hour rather than 24-hour periods. Surprisingly all
species (5) had additional hatchings after the morning ones. The times
varied from 11 a.m. to 6 p.m. It now remains for nests to be checked at
night for additional eggs, but this has the problems of disturbing the birds.
Mousebirds go about nesting so quickly that they may indeed be capable
of laying two eggs in a day. This would explain the sudden appearance of
hitherto unsuspected clutches that have made incubation times so hard to
check. Of course, one would have to rule out the use of the nest by more
than one hen.
There was one major departure from last year's incubation procedure.
Whereas the sitting bird was previously relieved regularly by another, it
was not seen to be relieved at all this year. The nest was observed every
day and on three consecutive days was watched for spells of two, two and
five hours. The sitting bird never came off to feed, and was seen voluntari-
ly off only once, on the eighth day after the chick hatched. The weather
was hot and dry from laying to fledging.
Chicks
The brooding adult was far more reluctant to be flushed from the
chicks than from the eggs. The single chick in the first nest was observed
daily until it left the nest. A hole was cut in the bush to give a clear view
of the nest. The thorns had been removed from the adjacent stems, but
this was hardly necessary, as all the birds spent a good deal of time in the
rose bush with apparent familiarity - thorn bushes are widespread in the
natural habitat of this species. The nest was watched with 12X15 binocu-
lars from a distance of 36' (11 m). Fortunately, the weather was fine for
the two weeks that I spent almost entirely out in the garden. A Chloropsis
nest was being watched conveniently from the same spot, and a local robin
Turdus migratorius was nesting in full view just behind me, so I was kept

busy the whole day. The Colius chick was fed on crop milk, and only by
the brooding bird. The parent must have fed heavily early in the morning
as it never did so all day or in the evening, and no other bird brought food
to the nest. The mother (a reasonable presumption) fed the chick while
remaining seated. As the chick constantly changed position, she searched
around for its head, raising herself very slightly to check underneath.
Sometimes the chick stuck its head out from under the parent. The hen
regurgitated fluid up into her beak then let the chick lap it out as from a
spoon, the chick was fed about eight times an hour and the minimum feed
lasted 20 seconds. Sometimes the chick got prolonged feeds lasting 1 Vi
minutes. This was the only way the chick was fed. None of the 1979
chicks came out of the nest to sit nearby, as did the previous chicks. The
1979 nests were all very broad and roomy and perhaps the cramped 1978
nests induced the chicks to sit out before fledging. The chicks all left
the nest at 13 or 14 days, and the 15-16 day fledging of the 1978 chicks
was indeed due to the colder weather and shorter days. When the chicks
left the nest they were fed by a combination of regurgitation and by hav-
ing lumps of food handed to them. At least two adults were seen to feed
one chick. Once an adult took a very long draught of milk nectar, then
immediately pumped some down the throat of a begging 24 day-old
chick. One three week-old chick from the last nest was rather weak and
sickly looking. It could not keep up with the others and was always being
left on its own. This made it really miserable. It dropped from the aviary
roof on to my ear, then ran down my arm. It was taken indoors. Nothing
obvious could be seen wrong, other than it being hungry and rather scruf-
fy. It would not feed by itself, but took mash readily from a spoon, or
lumps of food from a toothpick. It was put out daily with the adults who
fed it, but as it still could not keep up with the clock, it was probably not
being fed enough. It decided to become tame all by itself, and would
come down and beg if anyone entered the aviary. It was brought in each
night and it proved most interesting and entertaining.
Colius are very sociable birds and the chick much prefers human com-
pany to being on its own. Its unusual clinging propensities prove ideal for
befriending people, as it can stick on wherever it lands. This can be sore on
the face. It has less trouble than most birds in finding perching spots in-
doors. Often it will fly on to a towel or curtain for a nap. When sleeping
it does not tuck its head in, but withdraws it to the shoulders or stretches
its neck out and lets its head flop. This was rather disconcerting at first,
as the chick looked as if it had just died. It is surprisingly vocal and con-
stantly makes quiet chortling noises, when it is in company. These noises
have not been heard from the others, but no doubt they are made to each

have not been heard from the others, but do doubt they are made to each
other in private. They could not be heard outside the aviary anyway. The
chick loves to get its head scratched, and if in a warm spot on clothing,
will drop off to sleep, chirping long after its eyes have closed. Five days
after the chick was brought in, all the others went to the zoo. The chick
remains as one of the few pet birds ever kept here, and if all goes well, it
may be useful in revealing some of the more intimate habits of the wary
Mousebird.
Being able to sex all of the birds, albeit in retrospect, provides an ex-
planation for some of the differences noted in the two breeding seasons,
and makes strong probabilities of the following points. More than one hen
may lay in the one nest; only the hens incubate the eggs, and brood and
feed the nestlings; other hens (not necessarily layers) may share these
activities at the same nest. Although cocks do not participate in the above,
they do feed the chicks once they have left the nest. If circumstances
permit, I hope to be able to check on these things next year.

Introduction
The genus Popelairia , of which ther are four species, are small, robust
hummingbirds. The males have elongated tails and one member has a crest.
When flying they carry themselves in an upright position. The male Wire-
crested Thorntail is reminiscent of a small Sea-horse Hippocampus. The
females are small, round-bodied birds with short tails, and both sexes have
large, strong feet compared to hummingbirds of a similar size. When ob-
served from several yards away, their fight and behavious are very insect-
like.
Since the mid-sixties to the present day, small numbers of the Green
Thorntail P. conversii and the Wire-crested Thorntail have been imported
into the United Kingdom; three males and one female of the Black-bellied
Thorntail P. langsdorffi melanosternon have been imported by Mr. M.
Clifford.
THE WIRE-CRESTED THORNTAIL P. popelairii
Distribution and Status
Tropical to subtropical zones as high as 8,500 feet in the Eastern Andes
from eastern Colombia, eastern Ecuador to north-east Peru. It is found
in wooded regions where it frequents the edges at natural breaks such as
clearings, tracks, edges of streams, etc. where it visits flowering vegetation,
either hovering for nectar of perching on fine twigs, and sometimes cling-
ing to the blossom with its strong legs. The vertical distribution is usually
from ground level to a height of six feet, but it is most frequently observed
feeding below three feet. The nest is very small, cup-shaped and usually
placed on an exposed twig above a stream or dense vegetation.
Description
The adult male is a small bodied (4.5 ins) hummingbird with a long
V-shaped tail and wire-like crest reminiscent of the Lapwing. The crown
and throat are glittering emerald green, the sides of the head, back and
upper tad-coverts are bronze-green. There is a white band on the upper
mmp, the rump being blue-black; the underparts are black turning to dark

brown with white tufts on the flanks and rufous tufts on the thighs. The
tail has long steel-blue feathers with white shafts, the outer ones being the
longest (see Figures 1 and 4). Immature males resemble the female. In the
first moult they attain postadult plumage which is identical to the adult
male in all but the tail. The postadult tail is much shorter and more black
in colour, the outer feathers are tipped white, lacking elongated shafts of
the adult. The central feathers are tipped white and the lower webbing is
edged white (Figure 2). On some occasions captive birds may attain the
adult tail with their first moult.
The female is only 3 inches long. The upper plumage is bronze-green
with a white band across the rump. The underpaits, throat, breast and
centre of the belly are black. The moustachial streaks, flanks and thighs
are white, the tail is steel blue crossed by a grey band and tipped white
(Figure 3).

Display of Male
</subsubsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.998147444444444" page_id="56283819"  page_num="93" year="" vol="">
The airborne display of the male usually takes place in the morning
or in good light; usually he tries to face the sun, probably to show the
iridescent green to the best advantage. The display can be divided into
two phases. In the first phase (Figure 5) the male will take flight and
position himself approximately four inches from the female, slightly above
her to show his iridescent plumage to its best advantage, with body jerking
up and down and head nodding to show the iridescent green feathers of
the crown, chin and throat. Immediately on completion of
the first phase, which lasts only seconds, he will go into the second phase
(Figure 6). With head positioned to show the crest and crown, there is a
rapid movement of the tail while making a mechanical type sound. (Note
the position of the feet in the drawings of both phases.) After the second
phase he will either copulate or retreat to a nearby perch for several sec-
onds, then return to the female and reverse the display cycle by repeating
the second phase and then the first phase. The display cycle can take place
two or three times, the male getting closer to the female each time. Then
either copulation takes place or the female takes flight or the male loses
interest.

P.l melanostemon is found in tropical zones of eastern Ecuador, east-
ern Peru and Western Brazil, southern Venezuela and the Amazonian
region of Colombia,
Description
The male is 5.7 inches, the female 3 inches long. The male is similar to
the Wire-crested Thorntail without the crest; the throat and breast are
glittering emerald green, bordered below by a band of red in P b kings-
dorffi and of golden-copper in R L melanostemon. The underparts are
mainly black with tail much longer than the Wire-crested. The outer fea-
thers are greyish, narrowing to shafts near the tip. The rest of the tail is
dark blue with white shafts on the underside. The female is similar to the
female Wire-crest but the throat and breast are white with green discs
bordered below with golden-copper, the tail is forked and tipped with
white.

upper tail-coverts are coppery-green, as are the underparts with a steel blue
spot in the centre of the breast. The tail is extremely long with three outer
pairs of feathers, greatly elongated and narrow, curving inwards and cross-
ing. The female is green above with a white rump band; the throat,
breast and underparts are black. The lower cheeks are white.There is a
white patch on the sides of the belly. The tail is grey with a broad black
subterminal band and tipped white.
Ideally members of the genus Popelairia , like all small hummingbirds,
should be housed in a box cage - minimum dimensions 45" x 16" x 16" -
singly or in true pairs. If a pair is housed together, their condition should
be monitored daily in case of stress. Several years ago, I housed a male in
an indoor flight which was 8' long x 5' high x T wide and had a number
of houseplants on the back wall. The other occupants were two male
and one female Frilled Coquettes Lophomis magnifica, one male Racket-
tailed Coquette Discosura longicauda and one male Amethyst Woodstar
Calliphlox amethystina.
The nectar solution should contain no more than 10% cane sugar, as a
higher concentration of sugar causes fungus ( Candida ) to grow on the
tongue, bill and digestive tract. At present the nectar diet I use is 1,000
mis sugar water to which I add 10 grams of brewer's yeast, 10 grams of
pollen and 10 mis of Min amino Compound (an amino acid vitamin and
mineral food supplement). The only addition to the nectar is an abundant
supply of fruit fly ( Drosophila). Popelairia prefer to glean insects either
from the walls of the cage or wire fronts, taking the fly in the tip of the
beak, tossing it into the air and flying at it with beak open so as to enable
the fruit fly to be taken into the rear of the gape.
It is essential for all hummingbirds to have adequate bathing facilities,
a small saucer of clean water is sufficient. I have found thorntails to be
avid bathers.

BIRDS IN LERWICK HARBOUR

My friend, Eric Knowles, and I spent a week in Shetland in June 1973.
Knowing our interest in birds, friends and acquaintances whom we told
where we had been almost invariably said, "Did you go to Fetlar and see
the Snowy Owls?", or, in Army charge sheet wording, "words to that
effect." When we replied that we did not, our interrogator was usually at
a loss for words but we could hear our stock fall with an audible bump. It
is abundantly clear that even people who never look at a bird in their
backyards have made pilgrimage to Fetlar to see the Snowy Owls and that
if "good" bird watchers stay in Lerwick they use it only as a base whence
to invade the far-famed sanctuary of Noss, before setting out for the wilds
of Fetlar (Snowy Owls, Whimbrels, and Red-necked Phalaropes) and
Hermaness. We, however, were bad, idle, middle-aged bird watchers who
got no further from Lerwick than Bressay on one side and the moors a few
miles beyond the refuse tip on the other.
Six months before, watching Black Vultures on a refuse tip in northern
Brazil, I had thought how lucky we in Britain are to have the beautiful
gulls and pigeons in our towns as scavengers instead of vultures or kites,
which are no more interesting and far less lovely. I thought so again when
watching the multitudinous gulls, the many Fulmars and the rather few
feral pigeons in Lerwick Harbour. All these and also the impressive and
darkly handsome Great Skua were there because man supplied food for
them, sometimes at "second hand" and often unwillingly. Observing the
different strategies of the various species, their interactions with each
other and with the sometimes dangerous but on the whole remarkably
tolerant fishermen, provided some of the most interesting birdwatching of
my life. All within a few moment's walk of our hotel too!
By far the commonest gull about the harbour was the Herring Gull. At
a rough estimate it outnumbered all others by at least 15 to 1. Lesser
Black-backed Gulls were much less numerous, although common enough.
In the harbour the feeding behaviour of these two species was identical.
They were by far the boldest birds present. Quick to snatch any bit of fish
or other edible offal dropped on land or water, they did not restrict them-
selves to food dropped or thrown away. They sidled into outbuildings
where fish were stored, alighted on loaded lorries (even those in motion
when not going very fast) and pressed close among men at work, watching

for a box of fish to be left uncovered and unguarded. Surprisingly often
this happened. When the boxes were covered they pulled fish out of the
handgrip holes. Some, at least two Herring Gulls and one Lesser Black-
backed Gull being involved, cleverly "flutter-slid", apparently grappling
with their feet just sufficiently to stay put for the moment needed to
pull a fish from the one exposed handgrip hole in an otherwise tarpaulin-
covered back of a lorry.
One morning a Danish herring-salting boat was in. The factory con-
veyor belt-like process of salting the fresh herrings ended, or at any rate
reached a temporary hiatus, with the headless, salt-covered fish being
packed into large barrels stacked on deck and covered with wooden lids
which were not, at that point, fastened down. The gulls, swarming round
in a clamouring, jostling throng never got the idea, as I think a crow or a
dog would quickly have done, to try to remove the lids themselves. They
could, however, see fish exposed between the edge of a lid and the edge of
a barrel and any such fish was soon seized and pulled out. Sometimes the
gull would succeed in turning the fish headless head-end first (they mostly
seemed to be pulled out tail first) as it lifted it and gulp it down before
others could prevent it, sometimes the fish was too heavy and the press
too hindering and the fish fell to the deck where half a dozen gulls tugged
and wrenched at it. All this was punctuated by frequent panic flights
when one or other of the men rushed angrily at the gulls. One Herring
Gull, engaged in a melee over a fish, was too slow. It was caught before
it could get clear, roughly handled and thrown into the air. It fluttered
weakly down to the water and floated there, apparently with serious
internal injuries, ignored by and ignoring the bustle around it.
This was, however, the only instance I saw of an attempt to do any
serious harm to a gull. Indeed here, as elsewhere, the fishermen's con-
siderable tolerance of the gulls in spite of much provocation struck me as
a very pleasing contrast with the attitude of shooters and fly-fishers to
the birds and beasts that they consider may possibly interfere with their
avicidal and piscicidal pleasures.
Although when we fed the gulls on the harbour immature individuals
were among the hungriest and tamest, all the rather clever-seeming "steal-
ing" of fish was done by fully adult birds.
Greater Black-backed Gulls were abundant and, although less afraid of
man than I have seen them elsewhere, would not come so close as the
Herring and Lesser Black-backed Gulls. They appeared decidedly unwilling

to take any risks, or perhaps they were more aware of what was risky.
When food was in the offing they hung about as near as they dared waiting
for some lump of offal, chunk of bread or a fish too large for a Herring
Gull to swallow quickly to fall on land or water at a safe distance from.
When that happened the Greater Black-backed at once lunged into the
melee. Usually it succeeded in getting a grip on the food and if it did the
result was a foregone conclusion. The contesting gulls exerted all their
strength, bracing their webbed feet and jerking back with all their force.
At this tug of war superior weight told, unless the booty tore, giving each
a mouthful, it would sooner or later be tugged free of the weaker birds and
gulped down by the Greater Black-backed.
On two occasions we saw a Greater Black-backed chase a gorged Herr-
ing Gull, harrying it until it cast up its just-swallowed meal in fear. Prob-
ably the same individual was involved each time and this direct form of
"robbery" was clearly not usual. What very many Greater Black-backed
Gulls habitually did, however, was to let the Great Skua perform its
"highway robbery" technique and then intercept its hoped-for booty. As
soon as a Great Skua started to chase a Herring or Lesser Black-backed
GuU, one or more Greater Black-backed Gulls would usually see and at
once follow fairly close behind the Skua. After its fruitless and pitiful
attempts to escape, the hunted gull would, more often than not, disgorge
in flight. At once the Skua would check, turn and plunge down after the
food but the second or so this took would usually be enough to enable the
following Greater Black-backed Gull, swooping smoothly down without a
check, to get there first. Much the same usually happened if the poor gull
was seized in flight and, together with its persecutor, crashed into the sea.
When this happened it regurgitated as it hit the water, or a second or so
before, and usually before the Skua could let go of the gull and grab, the
closest following Greater Black-backed Gull had snatched the food literally
from "under its nose". Even under such provocation the Great Skua,
belying its ill-deserved reputation for courage, never ventured to attack
the Greater Black-backed Gull.
The Common Gull, one of the loveliest gulls in breeding dress when its
dark eye, set in a snow white head, gives it a gentle look lacking from its
congeners, we never saw in the harbour. It bred abundantly only two miles
away and a few were seen hovering around a sewage outfall at the other
end of the town but it did not attempt to compete around the fishing
boats.

The Black-headed Gull, the Common Gull's companion and rival else-
where, did, however, try its luck in the harbour. In numbers not much if
any less than the Greater and Lesser Black-backed Gulls, although not near-
ly so abundant as the Herring Gulls and, because of its small size, it gave an
impression of being less numerous than it actually was. Its role in the har-
bour was that of picker-up of unconsidered trifles, dipping down to pick
up some small morsel unnoticed by the larger gulls or suddenly wafted up
to the surface. When we fed the gulls with large lumps of food thrown
down onto the ground the Black-headed did not try to compete. If, how-
ever, we threw smallish scraps of bread into the water one or more Black-
headed Gulls would often be among the first on the scene and, by their
much greater agility, manage to get some of the food. Once a large mob of
Herring Gulls had gathered, as usually happened very quickly when food
was distributed, they were no longer able to get a share. Among their
larger congeners they gave the impression of being nervous and shy, very
different from their species' bombastic aggressiveness when competing
with ducks and feral pigeons in London parks.
The Great Skua, with its thickset head and body, bird-of-prey type
colour pattern, powerful flight and spectacular wing-raised displays, looks
courageous but is in fact no more so than the despised gulls. It appears
bold enough, chasing a Herring or Lesser Black-backed Gull with a larger
wingspan than itself, but these have no more chance of self-defence than
has a worm seized by a Blackbird or a pigeon seized by a Peregrine. As I
have described, it consistently feared to tackle the Greater Black-backed
Gulls in spite of much provocation.
When there was much food in prospect, several Great Skuas would
usually soon be in evidence. If a large lump of food, such as the remains
of a large joint of meat, bone and all, was flung overboard, a Skua would
often alight and hurl itself into the throng.
All but the Greater Black-backed Gulls would give way before it; in
this situation the Great Skua and the Greater Black-backed Gull appeared
equally matched or equally lacking sufficient foolhardiness to provoke a
showdown with the other, whichever laid hold of the prize first retained
it. On three occasions we saw a Great Skua tugging at a large chunk of
meat and bone, with a ring of envious but respectful Herring Gulls and,
nearer to the Skua, one or more Greater Black-backed Gulls letting "I
dare not wait upon I would" and on two others the reverse situation,
with an adult Greater Black-backed Gull tearing and tugging at the prize
and a Great Skua sitting very near to it on the water, watching hungrily

but not daring to do more. Admittedly too few incidents to be "statis-
tically significant" 5 but suggestive for all that; in bird watching as in other
things one is far more likely to see the usual than the exceptional.
The Fulmar is known to be amazingly bold when feeding around fish-
ing boats far out at sea and there are many eyewitness accounts of it get-
ting the upper hand of Herring Gulls in disputes over food. The Fulmars
about Lerwick Harbour did not, however, display these attributes of their
species. Their role seemed to parallel that of the Dunnock on the lawn,
diligently searching for and consuming morsels so small that they had been
overlooked or ignored by other species.
Much of their feeding was done in quieter periods rather than when fish
was being moved about or garbage actually thrown overboard. Then, par-
ticularly in the evening, but also at other times, Fulmars would alight, one
after the other, until there were often several dozen on the water. Their
plump bodies floating high, they would paddle rapidly about with their
pale lilac feet, looking down into the water and every now and then pick-
ing up a morsel. Usually these were taken on or (more often) an inch or
two below the surface, rather rarely a Fulmar would plunge head and
shoulders under.
Often the birds were near enough to see quite clearly the objects
taken. These were most usually, in about 60% of cases perhaps, small
flattish, off-white objects about the size (except for being flat) of a lentil.
They were numerous, usually suspended in the water near the surface,
sometimes at it. We came to the conclusion that they must be the scales of
fish, probably Herring, because there did not seem to be anything else
they could be. Besides these the Fulmars took small whitish or greyish
white shreds of what we presumed to be fish tissue. The only time that we
saw anything larger taken was when a Fulmar pulled off an inch-long shred
of bloodstained fish that was sticking to the underside of a floating herring
barrel top. Occasionally what appeared to be small pieces of bread were
picked up, apparently in mistake for animal food, as the Fulmar invariably
dropped them again at once. Some recognisable pieces of biscuit were simi-
larly treated and almost immediately afterwards were seen and eaten by
a Lesser Black-backed Gull.
When a Great Skua, well out from the hurly-burly around the ships,
began plucking an adult Herring Gull which it had brought down and
killed, several Fulmars alighted near, swam to the lengthening trail of
floating feathers and appeared to pick up small morsels among them, al-

D. GOODWIN - BIRDS IN LERWICK HARBOUR
though what these consisted of it was impossible to see.
Two land birds regularly fed on and about the harbour. These were
those widespread and successful species, the Feral Pigeon and the House
Sparrow. Unlike their London contemporaries, on Shetland harbour
neither could benefit from any large or even moderately sized bits of bread
or other food (although they did elsewhere in the town by coming down
into narrow streets where the gulls either did not venture or only did so
if there was some very obvious and tempting prize to be had thereby).
On the harbour they only obtained such very small fragments of bread,
cooked fish or other food as had been overlooked by the gulls or had been
dropped or rolled beneath or behind boxes, crates or other objects so
that the gulls either had not seen or could not reach it.
On one occasion (at least) while we were there grain was handled
on the harbour. A considerable amount of it was spilled. This was ignored
by the gulls (although I have seen Herring Gulls flocking to feed on newly
sown oats in Shetland) but many of the House Sparrows and Feral Pigeons
found it and fed to repletion. Collared Doves appeared to be less numerous
in Lerwick than when we had been there previously in 1970. Then they
had been seen occasionally feeding in the streets and on the harbour, appa-
rently on very minute fragments of food, but this time the only Collared
Dove we saw feeding was with House Sparrows at a window sill where
crumbs had been placed.
In addition to all this avian interest and beauty, Lerwick Harbour also
produced one rarity for us, a Glaucous Gull. Not in the Snowy Owl class
admittedly but equally no everyday bird to us southerners.

A broad expanse of lawn sweeps away from the terrace of the Georgian
house, leading the eye into the distance - a pastoral scene of trees and roll-
ing fields. No other house is in sight. The lawn leads, surprisingly, to an
avenue of limes which have stood for 200 years. But first one encounters a
small lake occupied by diving ducks and flamingoes and set amid a profus-
ion of azaleas and rhododendrons of delicate and starling tints - pink, flam-
ing red, white and pale orange - and pink and white camelias laden with
blooms.
Is this a stately mansion, set amid a huge parkland estate many miles
from any city? No, it is the home of Council Member Mr. Jack D'Eath,
only thirteen miles from the centre of London.
Many times I had passed the mellow, yellow brick, green-shuttered
exterior of his home, behind high brick walls and wrought-iron gates,
without guessing what lay behind them.
Mr. D'Eath, a member of the Society since 1953, over the years, often
asked me to visit his collection but it was not until a sunny Saturday in
May this year that I walked through those wrought-iron gates. I could
scarcely have been more surprised for here, literally a few hundred yards
from the serried rows of homes which testified that the locality was a
built-up London suburb, I found a 25-acre haven for waterfowl and wild
birds.
This is the oldest private waterfowl collection in Britain, established
nearly fifty years ago by Jack D'Eath as a young man. During the inter-
vening years he has kept 90 species of waterfowl and has achieved out-
standing breeding results with many of them.
If the ducks, geese and cranes are a joy to behold, their natural setting
is equally delightful. Some of the ponds are man-made but the two largest
are natural and, even in times of drought, filled with the clearest water, the
source of which is entirely unknown. The largest lake is encircled by

shrubs and ancient trees, some of which have, for more than 200 years,
shed their leaves on the lake's surface. Beautiful flowering trees such as
Malm floribunda and Prunus sargentii , a mass of white blossoms, enhance
the scene. Ne-Nes enquiringly followed our progress along the path;
over the years many have been reared here and some were returned to
Hawaii for release.
Black-necked Swans swim among the Eiders - another species
which has proved prolific here - in company with numerous species of teal,
pintail, golden-eyes and scaup. The numbers are reduced now but never-
theless the total is in the region of 300.
Ross's Geese, their snow-white plumage contrasting with the
deep pink azaleas, keep company with the most attractive and sought-after
Pacific Brent Geese, which reared young last year. An errant New Zealand
Scaup or Black Teal, was persuaded back into the main paddock, protec-
ted by fox-proof fencing which is scarcely noticeable among the shrubs.
Maned and Red-breasted Geese, the latter another successful breeder here,
share the enclosure.
All the birds are delightfully tame, none more so than a magnificent
female Stanley Crane, reared here five years ago. When Mr. D'Eath
is alone, she will approach him with the regal walk of her species,
and allow him to scratch her neck. I believe that this was only the
second collection to breed this elegant grey crane in Britain. Demoiselle
and West African Crowned Cranes can also be seen.
Mandarin Ducks were occasionally sighted winging their way
into the distance. These full-winged birds have colonised the dis-
trict and Mr. D'Eath occasionally receives reports of a pair on
local goldfish ponds! Prior to the breeding season, 15 or so drakes
can be seen about his grounds. Females are in short supply but a
few return each year with their broods of ducklings.
Of course, all the other birds breed in the grounds but their nests
are sometimes difficult to locate. I saw two pairs of Barnacle Geese
nesting under holly trees; they will be allowed to rear their goslings,
while the ducks' eggs are removed and placed under broody bantams.
One duck nest-box on a tiny island contained a brood of Pied
Wagtails. The property provides a sanctuary for native birds. I
watched a Tree-creeper working its way up the trunk of a tall tree,
and Nuthatches, Bullfinches and Woodpeckers find a safe haven
within the walls of the ancient grounds.

As I admired an attractive White-faced Whistling Duck, Mr. D'Eath
told me that all the whistling ducks ( Dendrocygna ), except the
Spotted, are represented here. A pair of out-of-colour Hooded
Mergansers shared this pond with some Hawaiian Ducks, also known
as Koloas.
What a pleasure it was to visit this collection! All the birds looked
tame and contented. I feel that the secret of Mr. D'Eath's success can
be attributed in no small measure to his ability to resist the temptation
to overstock his areas of water. This is a point some waterfowl enthu-
siasts would do well to consider.
His interest in horticulture goes hand in hand with that in waterfowl
breeding and the birds live in a setting whch includes some of the love-
liest flowering trees and shrubs I have seen in an English garden.

A NOTE ON JAVANESE AVICULTURE
By A. MORRISON (Ainslie, ACT, Australia)
As visitors to Java will quickly notice, the people of that island are
very fond of the company of cage birds. They are certainly the most in-
veterate aviculturists of my acquaintance. Cages are to be seen everywhere.
They hang outside shops and houses and many are suspended from poles
standing high above the roof tops. The Javanese believe that birds like a
view and a breeze. Such suspended cages, usually containing doves - are
complete with cloth shades over the top to provide some shelter from the
tropical sun. They are hoisted into position in much the same way as one
hoists a flag.
Much the most common cage birds are doves. The Javanese enjoy
their cooing. Zebra Doves are especially numerous but numbers of the
two local Turtle Doves - the Javanese and Necklaced Doves - are also
kept.
Unfortunately the Javanese cages are small, often round and always
much higher than they are long. Despite this, household cage birds are
usually in quite good condition though regrettably the mortality in the
bird markets is appalling.
While doves are the most numerous cage birds, a visit to one of the bird
markets, which are to be found in every city, shows that there is a demand
for many other species and families of birds - almost every kind of bird, in
fact, that can be kept in a cage. Those particularly favoured are Magpie
Robins (including all-black forms which I do not ever recollect having seen
in Britain) and Shamas, Orange-headed Thrushes, bulbuls, starlings (Black-
winged and Pied Grackles and Jungle Mynahs) and orioles. A particularly
attractive little bulbul which is seen quite often is the Orange-spotted Bul-
bul. The big Gold-crowned Bulbul, which has a fine loud bubbling song, is
also often kept.
But all sorts of other birds are to be seen in the markets - the odd phea-
sant or jungle fowl; woodpeckers and barbets; lories, lorikeets and cocka-
toos from Eastern Indonesia; the pretty blue-eyed Bronze Tree Pie; an
occasional Friar Bird; munias, Zosterops and Tailor Birds; the odd owl
and an occasional unhappy pitta and many others. These are all Indonesian
birds but in addition Mongolian Larks and Spectacled Laughing Thrushes

are imported from China. In a visit to the Semarang Market on the north
coast of Java I counted 36 species in half an hour. While the squalor and
brutality and mortality in the bird markets is terrible, the birds which
survive to become household pets are generally well cared for and the
insectivorous species in surprisingly good condition. I think that this is
largely attributable to the quantities of fresh ants' eggs which they are
given. These are obtained from the nests of a common species of red tree
ant which builds parchment-like nests in low trees and bushes. There is a
regular traffic in such ants' eggs. The contents of the nests are kept on
bamboo trays covered with a few leaves. The ants still
with the eggs seem too shocked and bewildered to do anything about
moving the eggs. You are liable to come away from a bird market with
ants crawling all over you.
Java itself is a singularly birdless island. It is densely populated and
nearly all its original forest cover has long been destroyed. Some of the
commoner birds - starlings, manias and doves - are no doubt caught in
Java and find their way to the bird markets but most of the birds to be
seen must be caught in the other islands. I am afraid that aviculture is
a major source of bird destruction in Indonesia. There is an enormous
demand and a very high mortality rate while at the same time bird habi-
tats are continually being destroyed for forestry and agriculture.
The worst example of avicultural damage to a species in Indonesia
concerns the unique and beautiful Rothschild's Starling or Grackle. It
has, and always has had, an extraordinarily limited distribution being
confined to a small area in north-western Bali. Habitat reduction has
played a part in reducing its numbers but its survival is now most acutely
threatened by illegal trapping. It is a fully protected species and not
readily available to Indonesian bird keepers though it is to be seen in
zoos there. But many are smuggled out of Indonesia to satisfy the demand
from European and American aviculturists. I saw a whole aviary full
containing about 30 birds in the Singapore Bird Park in 1972 and in May
last year (1979) I saw 19 for sale in one Singapore bird shop.
When the species does finally become extinct in its native habitat
European and American aviculturists will bear a heavy load of guilt for
its disappearance. Aviculturists will then no doubt claim that by encour-
aging the illegal traffic in the bird they were really protecting it - an argu-
ment akin to that of the man who murdered his parents and then pleaded
for mercy on the grounds that he was an orphan. The fact is that the
importation of this species should long ago have been totally banned by
every civilised country.

A. MORRISON - JAVANESE AVICULTURE
In the last issue of the Avicultural Magazine (VoL 86, No. 1: 30-31), David Jeggo,
Deputy Curator of Birds at Jersey Wildlife Preservation Trust, described the Trust's
programme to establish and maintain a captive population of Rothschild's Mynahs
which has resulted in over a hundred specimens having been successfully reared there
since 1971.
Mr. Jeggo was asked to comment on the last two paragraphs of Alistair Morrison's
article and he replied as follows:
The situation for the Rothschild&apos;s Mynah is worsening and there may
now be only 200 or less in the wild. There is a great obligation upon the
avicultural world to redress the balance. That avicultural demand has con-
tributed to the demise of the Rothschild's Mynah cannot be denied. In the
early seventies, hundreds found their way into the American and European
markets alone. The number of birds that end up in the hands of bona fide
aviculturists and zoos is only the tip of the iceberg of the consumer mar-
ket. It is clear that something had to be done and vast improvements are
still required.
Today the situation is changing, and, since the establishment of the
Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species (CITES), trade
is severely restricted. CITES has, to date, been ratified by over sixty coun-
tries, including Britain and the United States, and it is illegal to trade in
all species listed under Schedule 1, which includes the Rothschild's Mynah.
It is, of course, going to take time for the controls to filter through to the
trappers themselves. Aviculturists must not put undue demands on threat-
ened species and should establish self-sustaining populations of those en-
dangered species in their aviaries.
On the positive side, Rothschild's Mynahs are now being bred in in-
creasing numbers in captivity. Indeed, a number of years ago, the Jersey
Zoo, which has reared over 100, received a complaint from a dealer that
they were making it economically unviable for him to trade in wild-
caught Rothschild's Mynahs.
We must ensure that the captive population of the species continues
to prosper and that no wild-caught birds enter into trade. It is also im-
portant to help and encourage the Indonesian government to fully protect
Bali's only endemic bird in its last remaining habitat, the Barat Reserve.

THE USE OF DUNG AND LEAVES
BY NESTING AFRICAN STARLINGS

By MALCOLM ELLIS (Wadebridge, Cornwall)
Last winter I made a return visit to Kenya and spent a good deal of
time with the Bamleys, whose home is roughly midway between Kitale
and Kapenguria, on the Cherengani Hills in western Kenya. While I was
there, Tim Barnley told me some interesting facts concerning the nesting
of the Violet-backed Starling, sometimes also known as the Amethyst or
Hum-coloured Starling Gnnyricindus leucogaster.
One of Tim Barnley's staff, Mr. Keke Chebus, a good naturalist and
highly skilled observer, who is regularly employed on work with birds, has
examined many nesting holes used by this species of starling. He has found
that, usually at the bottom of the hole, there is a bed of dry dung. The
dung is that of larger game animals, among them buffalo and eland, or
domestic stock, depending upon which is locally available to the birds. On
top of the dung are fresh green leaves. Little or no other nesting material
is used.
He has noticed that whether the nest site is in the highlands or low,
semi-arid bush country, the Violet-backed Starling seems to use leaves of
Euclea keniensis or allied species of this small tree, which grow also in
southern Africa. Tim Barnley kindly collected for me some of the leaves,
which when fresh are shiny green. I was surprised by their large size - they
measure (not counting the stems) 100 mm long and 38 mm at the broad-
est part. They closely resemble bay leaves.
When I returned home and began to write this note, I checked the
reference sources available to me, and found that most state that the
Violet-backed Starling's nest is lined with wool, hair or leaves. The excep-
tion, I found, is Roberts' Birds of South Africa (Third Edition, First
Impression, 1970), where it is stated: "The cavity is lined with dung
and perhaps a little dry grass, but always some fresh green leaves." Roberts
also records that the Cape Glossy Starling Lamprotornis (Lamprocolius)
nitens uses dung when lining its nesting hole. In what seems a possible
explanation for the use of dung, Tim Barnley likened it to the local
people who will plaster dung on the floors of their homes to keep away
fleas, lice and termites (white ants).

M. ELLIS - NESTING MATERIAL OF AFRICAN STARLINGS
Re-reading "Breeding the Amethyst Starling at the Keston Foreign Bird
Farm, 1958" (Avicultural Magazine , Vol. 65, No. 2, pp. 44-45), the
account of the first breeding of this species in Britain, I found that W.D.
Cummings wrote: "I provided the normal nesting materials, hay, feathers,
moss, etc., but they were completely ignored. She calmly stripped three
small privet bushes of all their green leaves, and started on a box bush and
phlox plants growing in the aviary. She Filled up the nestbox to a depth of
one and a half inches with these fresh green leaves."
When Tim Bamley told me about this species using leaves, I was re-
minded how Emerald Starlings Coccycolius iris brought from Sierra
Leone to London Zoo in 1954, often carried green privet leaves, which
sometimes they took into the nestboxes. Unfortunately, this did not lead
to any serious nesting activity and so far as I know at the time of writing,
this species has not bred in captivity. Indeed it seems that the nest and
eggs remain undescribed. However, with the numbers of Emerald Starlings
lately imported and now in aviaries, it is hoped that this will not be for
much longer and that an account of the first breeding success will soon
be published in the Avicultural Magazine .
To encourage nesting, the above would appear to suggest that it may
be helpful to provide suitable leaves for both species, together with
dryish cow dung or similar dung in the case of the Violet-backed Star-
ling, and perhaps, even the Emerald Starling.

Christopher Marler reports that his very rare Blakiston's Fish-Owl
Ketupa blakistoni has now died. This bird was found as an adult in Japan
apparently suffering from some form of poisoning. It had lived in Flam-
ingo Gardens, Weston Underwood, for ten years.
Some interesting birds were reared in Flamingo Gardens during the
1979 season. Black-crowned Night Heron Nycticorax nycticorax, Rosy
Flamingo Phoenicopterus ruber , Scarlet Ibis Eudocimus ruber, Whistling
Swan Cygnus columbianus columbianus, Bewick's Swan Cygnus colum-
bianus bewickii and Whooper Swan Cygnus cygnus cygnus continue to
breed well and great interest centres on a young Black Swan Cygnus
atratus. One of the parent birds is an unusual grey mutation and it was
noticed that some of the clutch of eggs were cream instead of the custom-
ary greenish. One of these cream eggs hatched and the cygnet was found to
have an unusually pale-coloured down. It is hoped that this bird will prove
to be a grey mutant.
Other rarely bred species laid eggs in this extensive collection but failed
to produce chicks. These include: Maguari Stork Euxenura maguari , Paint-
ed Stork Ibis leucocephalus, Black Vulture Coragyps atratus, King Vulture
Sarcorhamphus papa and Andean Condor Vultur gryphus.
The breeding results might have been even better had not fate played a
hand. The stream feeding the chain of lakes in the breeding valley became
polluted and, as a result, Mr. Marler lost a number of birds and others suf-
fered severe illness. Indeed, the Trumpeter Swans Cygnus cygnus buccina-
tor, which bred regularly had to be carefully nursed back to health and
probably, as a result, failed to breed.

Malcolm Moy, at Wroxham in Norfolk, is best known as a breeder of
waterfowl specialising in the larger geese and swans. Last year he took part
in a rescue operation which involved him in handrearing two Marsh Har-
riers Circus aeruginosus. Two nests in the reed beds close to Mr. Moy's
home were deserted. One contained a clutch of eggs and the other a brood
of small chicks. The nests were left alone in the desperate hope that the
parents would return and, after this delay, only one egg proved viable and
all except one of the chicks had died. The egg was successfully hatched
and the resulting chick handreared. The second chick was also reared. The
diet employed was composed mainly of laboratory reared rats and mice,
together with a small amount of poultry chicks. No supplements or addi-
tives were used and the chicks grew well and matured as strong birds.

In the same part of the world, Trevor Lay, at Bungay in Suffolk, is at
present engaged in constructing a vast complex dedicated to the rearing of
large numbers of ducks, geese and swans. Breeding on a more restricted
scale has been in practice for several years, but the new facilities should
permit much greater numbers of birds to be reared. Many labour saving
and ingenious ideas have been incorporated in this layout and, already,
some 800 stock birds are housed in the enclosures.

In the National Museums of Kenya, Section of Ornithology, News-
letter No. 42, the question is posed - are Von der Decken's and Jackson's
Hornbill separate species, or is it that Von der Decken's is polymorphic in
plumage? Jackson's has extensive white spotting on the wing-coverts and
the possibility is that Von der Decken's is merely a phase which is without
spots on the coverts. The National Collection has typical Von der Decken's
and Jackson's, but also all sorts of intermediate spotted forms. Observa-
tions of behaviour and cads, etc., which would be helpful in making com-
parisons between the two, also any information about intermediate forms,
would be welcomed.

Newsletter No. 45, included a report from a correspondant living close
to Nairobi, who from mid-December regularly saw a small flock of Fisch-
er's Lovebirds, which were paired and inspecting holes for nesting. The
Editor stated that the dispersal and distribution should be monitored, for
it is clear that flocks are now increasing and dispersing far and wide.
At present, living mainly in the suburbs of Nairobi, around Lake Naivasha
and along the Kenyan coast, they have in some instances hybridised with
Masked Lovebirds. The general opinion is that these lovebirds all origina-
ted from captives which escaped or were released. There is, however, some
doubt about whether this is entirely so.

The White-naped Crane Grus vipio is the subject of a concentrated
breeding programme at the Bronx Zoo, New York, where a total of 23
young have been reared since 1971.
Don Bruning writes:- "Prior to 1978 only one pair had produced regu-
larly since 1971. In 1978 an adult female successfully paired with a male
reared at the Zoo in 1971. Last year a young home-bred pair produced
their first chick and another young pair laid several infertile eggs. So at the
moment the Bronx Zoo have three breeding pairs and a potential fourth
pair. In September last we received a young bird reared at the Hong Kong
Zoo and are currently awaiting the arrival of three birds confiscated by
Hong Kong officials. The addition of these four birds will greatly broaden
our genetic base and improve our long term breeding prospect.
We remove any eggs laid in April or May but allow them to incubate
their last clutch which is usually laid in early June. Eggs from the early
clutches are artificially incubated and we handrear all chicks except the
last one hatched by the parents. These are reared by them and removed
the following winter and placed with the other young cranes.
Two males are now on loan to the Denver Zoo and seven young birds
were recently sent to the National Zoo's Breeding and Research Centre at

The rearing of hybrid Violet-ear Hummingbirds seems to be an almost
annual occurrence in England these days. The latest report comes from the
Wildlife Park at Cricket St. Thomas in Somerset, with parentage on this
occasion being Sparkling Colibri coruscans x Green Colibri thalassinus. Of
the breeding, curator Peter Lowe writes: "A nest constructed of camel
hair, feathers, moss and lichen was found on March 16th containing two
eggs. The fust hatched on the morning of the 23rd followed thirty-six
hours later by the second. Both chicks did well for a week when the
younger disappeared. The hen fed large numbers of fruit flies together
with nectar. She was also seen to visit a nectar pot intended for Zosterops
and carry away small lumps of sponge cake but was not observed to take
any up to the nest. The remaining chick grew rapidly and left the nest on
the twenty-second day. The male showed little interest in the youngster
but it was well cared for by the hen who, at times, was seen driving away
birds as large as glossy starlings."

Two books published recently are of interest. The first, released by
Heinemann (New Zealand) is one of the most spectacularly beautiful bird
books to appear for many years. Geoffrey Moon, the author, is a veterin-
arian by profession and spends much of his leisure time photographing
New Zealand's unique avifauna. His book entitled The Birds Around Us
does not pretend to be a detailed text book but is, more particularly, a
vehicle for displaying 357 superb colour plates. These plates are brilliant
technically and artistically are of great beauty. However, probably the
most impressive feature is that almost all of the subjects are captured
during moments of activity. The plates depict birds pouncing on prey,
displaying, copulating, incubating, feeding chicks, etc. Including, as
it does, many plates of very rare species this book will be greatly admired
by everyone with an interest in birds.
A second, less specialised publication is a "best-of" compilation put out
by Air Niugini and features selected articles from the airline's in-flight
magazine. Simply titled Best of Paradise, it provides a brief but fascinating
insight into the history, culture and wildlife of Papua New Guinea and
devotes three articles to birds. These cover migrants, kingfishers and birds
of paradise, and while fairly general in content are illustrated with many
excellent photographs depicting species such as Crested and Emperor Birds

Two collections in 1979 report the breeding of Count Raggi's Bird of
Paradise Paradisaea raggiana. One was reared at Baiyer River Sanctuary
where a small collection of native fauna is maintained by the Papua
New Guinea National Parks Board. The other was reared at the Hong Kong
Zoo after previous attempts yielded only eggs. Dr. K.C. Searle, writing
of the success, informs me that the youngster fledged the afternoon of
June 10th, and despite having to endure 111.5 mm of torrential rain in
its first twenty-four hours, has developed into a fine bird. Once the female
commenced building, the male was removed to a separate flight and she
undertook the 14/15 days of incubation alone. Mealworms and grass-
hoppers were offered ad lib to the chick which vacated the nest in about
three weeks.

An apparent decline in the population of the Orange-bellied Grass
Parrakeet Neophem chrysogaster is causing some concern amongst con-
servationists in Australia, for it seems the latest estimate puts the total
population at less than a hundred. Monitoring of winter populations in
Victoria has been in progress for several years but the plight of the birds
only became more generally known when I.C.I. disclosed its intention of
building a multi-million dollar petrochemical plant at Point Wilson, the
main wintering locality on mainland Australia for what is probably the
country's third rarest parrot. Detailed observations in known wintering
haunts yielded important if somewhat depressing statistics. A project,
started last October, to locate breeding grounds in the button grass plains
of south-west Tasmania has met with some success for"evidence has been
found" of some breeding activity amongst the forty or so birds under
constant surveillance.
Could captive breeding prove an aid in conserving this species? Other
Neophema lend themselves to captive conditions and most are now well
established (see note above about Professor J.R. Hodge's record), but only
three aviculturists have reported breeding this species.From several pairs
"materialising" in Europe during the 1970s, von Brummelen bred three in
1971 and J. Postern reported rearing one the following year. Sustained
breeding was achieved in Australia by the late Fred Lewitzka at his collec-
tion in Adelaide. Nine were reared during a seven-year period. The pair
proved no more difficult to coax into nesting than others of the genus
but results were found to be below expectations due to infertility. This,

he put down to their tendency of becoming obese. Chicks, once hatched,
proved no trouble to rear.
I well remember discussing the possibility of this species becoming
established in captivity with Fred. He was optimistic that it could be
achieved in Australia provided attitudes towards aviculture changed in
the various Wildlife Departments within the country, attitudes which
later caused him to release his young birds in the Coorong region of
South Australia. The ageing adults later died, and in all probability this
distinctive green parrakeet no longer exists in Australian aviculture.

Dr. Carl Naether, writing from Encino in California, says: "Members
of the Avicultural Society may be interested to learn that, after many
years' absence from captivity, so to speak, the Golden-heart Pigeon Galli-
columba rufigula , the beautiful Bleeding Heart Pigeon with the yellowish-
golden breast patch, has once again found its way into American and
British Columbian aviaries by way of imports from Holland, where it is
now successfully being raised.
Another item of some interest: Gary Landry, a foreign dove enthus-
iast living in Baton Rouge, Louisiana, discovered an unusual mutation
among the offspring of his Indian Green-winged Doves Chalcophaps
indica - in place of the usual green wings, this dove has bluish wings.
Meanwhile, Mr. Landry has succeeded in raising six "Blue-winged" Doves -
one male and five females. He hoped to establish a strain of Blue-wings!"

A Wild Mallard Problem
Most articles in the Avicultural Magazine are stories of successful
breeding of some birds. Mine is a problem story which is very difficult
to solve. I have most of the year about sixty Mallards coming to the
pond where I have my collection of wildfowl. They come, of course,
to feed with my birds and when wheat is #100 per ton and pellets also
very expensive, it is not a very amusing state of affairs.
Most people recommend shooting them but I know this would spell
disaster to the fullwinged birds of my collection. I lost seven fullwinged
geese one year entirely due to a helicopter flying nearby; I had had these
geese flying for about twelve years but they went for good. I was not at
home at the time but the next time the helicopter was due, I was fore-
warned and I got to the pond just as the machine was starting up and my
remaining fullwinged geese were strutting about in their usual upright
attitude when alarmed, but I called to them and they settled down and
began to feed, but I am sure that I would have lost these birds had I not
been there to reassure them that all was well.
The only way to see that the Mallard do not eat all the food is to stand
by the dishes in which one puts the pellets and the Mallard will seldom -
brave coming near; any that do approach, I can pick up. We eat them, of
course.
Another good point about staying with the duck whilst they feed is
that one gets to know them as individuals and they are so different in their
eating habits. Old "Greedy-guts" is always bulldozing his way through the
others, he cannot shovel his food down quickly enough whereas the Ring-
ed Teal would not get any food, they are far too polite. The diving duck
present a problem as they seldom come to land: "Charlie", the Barrow's
Golden-Eye, is greedy beyond belief and though he dives for some of his
food, he prefers to get it the easy way and shovels pellets out of a dish but
perhaps one of my readers, if I now have one, would have an answer to my
problem, and it is a real problem in the winter for during a severe spell
there can be 200 Mallard coming to the pond.

BREEDING BEECHEY'S JAYS Cissilopha beecheii AT THE
HOUSTON ZOOLOGICAL GARDENS

By WILLIAM TODD (Senior Keeper, Bird Department)
Two Beechey's Jays have been maintained at the Houston Zoo since
1972, but despite their frequently engaging in courtship feeding, we were
uncertain of their gender until the spring of 1979 when they nested and
produced young. Some months before this they had been moved into one
of a newly completed group of off-exhibit aviaries. Their construction was
of wood frame and poultry wire seven feet by nine feet by six feet high
with a partially enclosed, roofed shelter four feet deep at one end of the
flight. Two shallow wooden produce flats 13 inches by 17 inches by five
inches deep were affixed just under the shelter roof to serve as nesting
platforms. Sticks and hay were accepted as nesting material and the birds
arranged these loosely in the box immediately above the shelter entrance.
The birds' diet consisted of a tray of diced, mixed fruit (papaya, apple,
melon, grapes), soaked raisins, soaked Purina Dog Chow, Zu/Preem Bird
of Prey Diet, and finely chopped endive and spinach offered once a day.
In addition live crickets and mealworms were tossed into the cage several
times a day and mice, ranging from new-born to adult were provided at
least once a day during the nesting season, the numbers given increasing
with the chicks' hatching.
Two eggs were reported in the nest on 22nd May 1979. One chick hat-
ched on 12th June. The parents became quite defensive and did not
hesitate to attack with beak and claws anyone entering their flight. On
30th June, at 17days old, the chick was found on the aviary floor. The
feather sheaths had just begun to break open and it was of course incap-
able of even fluttering. The presence of fire-ants (,Solenopsis sp. - a highly
carnivorous form) near the aviary and the threat of predaceous rodents
left no alternative to handrearing. The bird weighed 125.0 g (see table of
weights). Soaked Purina Cat Chow was readily accepted and the food was

offered once an hour. Following each feed, the chick would initiate a tail-
shivering motion and elevate the anus before producing a fecal sac. The
newly emerging feathers where sooty black on the head and breast, and
dark blue-grey on the back. The hides were dark brown and the legs and
beak a pinkish-horn colour.
Within several days the chick had become quite active and could easily
jump from the box in which it was taken home each evening. During the
day it was housed in a large brooder to provide exercise space. Although
it seemed to seek a low perch, it did not have the ability to balance well.
It exhibited no interest in moving objects, live food, or water. The weight
of the growing primaries caused the rnetacarpals to droop. Zu/Preem Bird
of Prey Diet had been mixed with the Cat Chow and this, formed into pel-
lets, was the staple diet, supplemented with a few mealworms. Its response
to feeding was a soft, musical piping.
On 3rd July, its feeding response seemed somewhat diminished and its
behaviour depressed. On the following day a slight weight loss was noted.
Having had no previous experience with jay chicks, we became concerned
and administered stimulants to enhance its appetite. Its weight continued to
fluctuate from day to day, its feeding response remained low, and at one
point force-feeding was resorted to, probably unnecessarily. We than
determined to leave the bird in the brooder over-night in the event that the
stress of transport was affecting its behaviour. A tray of food was provided
to encourage its independence. Whether as a direct result of this action
or not, the bird's condition did begin to improve and it was soon eating
on its own. At the time of writing (September 1980), this bird's beak has
developed dark patches and the eyes have acquired a greenish-tint transi-
tory to the black beak and greenish-yellow eyes of the adults. Lacking
conspecific companionship, it has unfortunately remained imprinted on
humans.
In the spring of 1980, a clutch of five eggs was laid between 1st June
and 5th June in the same nest-box. Four of these hatched between 20th
and 22nd June; the fifth egg was clear. Summer temperatures were ex-
ceptionally hot; in excess of 100*F every afternoon, and we were appre-
hensive about the chicks' ability to withstand the even higher temperatures
in the nest just below the sizzling tin shelter roof. On 29th June, one of
the chicks had disappeared, and we decided to remove the remaining three
the following day. As evident from the table, there was an appreciable
difference in size, and the smallest chick appeared slightly dehydrated.
Their eyes were not yet open, and only the wing quills were at all de-
veloped.

After failing to elicit a feeding response by various local stimuli, I was
suddenly and dramatically successful with a loud quacking sound rather
like that of a Mallard hen. Until the chick's eyes were open it was neces-
sary to give this call at each feeding session to induce gaping. During
the first days in my care they were fed soaked Purina Cat Chow or an
equal mixture of soaked Cat Chow and Zu/Preem rolled into pellets and
proffered with forceps. Occasionally a drop of water might be given to aid
swallowing. Feeding took place approximately once an hour from 6.00 am
to 9.00 pm and the chicks usually produced a fecal sac at each feeding.
They were housed in a ceramic bowl lined with paper towels and sticks
and placed on a heating-pad. Temperature on the pad was maintained at
90* - 95*F but, after three days, artificial heat no longer appeared neces-
sary, the birds showing no discomfort at 85*F.
By 4th July, the birds were very vocal while feeding, producing a soft
whistling. The eyes of the largest chicks were beginning to open and the
wing-quills had grown quite long. The smallest chick was sloughing skin,
probably as a result of dehydration in the nest, and a light coating of
mineral oil was applied to the bird's body. This bird was inclined to be less
responsive than its siblings.
Although stereotyped preening motions were noted the following day,
the alar feather-sheaths had not yet begun to rupture, so I carefully began
to expose the ends of the feathers.
Feeding vocalization had now become a soft whimpering, and this was
complemented on 6th July with a single-syllable metallic note. On the
same day rudimentary beak-cleaning motions were observed, and wing-
fluttering at times accompanied feeding. Wing-flapping, as if for excercise,
was also noted. All feather tracts had begun to erupt from the skin and the
birds could apparently see, though their eyes were only partly open.
The chicks seemed thin, and Purina Dog Chow was substituted for Cat
Chow, the former offering lower protein, higher fat content. This was
powdered then mixed with the Zu/Preem and formed into pellets which
were dipped into water before being fed with the fingers. Like the first
chick, the weight of the growing feathers caused the wings to droop, but
no twisting was noted, and no correctional measures were taken.
The birds became increasingly active during the days that followed and
were soon capable of hopping out of the nest. By 11th July, the eyes of
the largest chick were fully open. The capital feathering was still encased
in sheaths. In cases of weak feeding response, a quick but gentle tug on the
bill was often found to enhance gaping. Shortly before mid-July, the
feeding responses of all the chicks seemed to decrease, particularly that of

the smallest, and a slight weight loss was detected. A drop of standard
infant vitamins was added to the smallest chick's food, and by 15th July
the bird had begun to gain weight once more. As evident from the table,
all the chicks' weights began to fluctuate about this time, but began to
increase again within a few days. Possibly this corresponds to the fledgling
stage of parent-raised birds. The first bathing attempt by one of the chicks
was observed on 16th July.
By 22nd July, the birds had begun to pick at food items on a tray in
their brooder and they were no longer taken home at night. On the fol-
lowing day, the smallest chick was discovered to have a severely twisted
neck. Vitamin B-complex injections failed to bring about any improve-
ment and radiographs were inconclusive as to the cause of the deformity.
The bird was separated from the others with which competition would
have been impossible. It did not begin eating independently until 30th
July, and the nature of its injury made flight impossible. Finally it was
moved to a more spacious cage with a variety of perches and has, at this
time of writing, made some improvement. Its nestmates, now fully inde-
pendent and adult size, have also been moved to a larger outside flight.
Unlike the single chick raised the previous year, they do not appear to be
imprinted on humans and may perhaps contribute to a second generation
breeding of this attractive species.
ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS:
Special mention should be made of keepers Peter Bauml and David Grubbs who
cared for the parent birds during their successful breeding. Scott McKnight provided
invaluable assistance in rearing the chicks and compiling data. The zoo clinic staff,
particularly Dr. Gary Harwell, provided excellent medical care for the growing
chicks.

The Red and Yellow Barbet Trachyphonus erthyrocephalus is a med-
ium sized (22.0 cm) bird. It inhabits semi-arid bush country, favouring areas
containing termite mounds, which when abandoned, are utilized as nesting
sites. It is brightly coloured with yellow and red predominating. The
tail, wings and upperparts are black and heavily spotted white. The under
parts are mostly pale yellow with a small spotted black band across the
chest. Males are distinguished by a fairly large black streak down the
throat, and a solid black cap on the head. The Red and Yellow Barbet is
widely distributed in central east Africa.
History
In August 1976 four birds were purchased from a dealer. These were
tentatively sexed as three males and a female, based upon colour differen-
tiation. A fifth bird was purchased to try to obtain an even sex ratio, one
of the extra males being shipped to another zoo. The additional bird
turned out to also be a male.
The four birds were initially placed in a small 1.67 m x 1.8 m x 2.3 m
high enclosure in the Bird World. The cage had a sand and tanbark mixture
on the floor and was decorated with various plastic shrubs and vines. A
wooden nest box 25.4 cm x 25.4 cm x 35.6 cm high with a 5.0 cm open-
ing was placed in an upper back corner of the exhibit. In April of 1977
courtship and attempted breeding was observed but nothing resulted.
In July of that year a keeper accidentally disturbed the nest box while
cleaning the cage and four eggs were discovered. The nest was abandoned
and the eggs disappeared within a week of the clutch being laid. It was
decided at this time to create a new exhibit for the birds and provide them
with a more suitable habitat.
A fairly large exhibit 2.7 m x 1.5 m x 3.1 m high was decorated with a
sandy bottom, a large hollow log and appropriate rocks and shrubs.
Included in the decorations was a large fibreglass termite mound con-
structed by the keepers. The termite mound is hollow, being 0.9 m in
circumference and 1.8 m high with a typical 15.2 cm x 15.2 cm x 25.4 cm
high wooden nest box installed directly behind the only bird entrance to

the mound. Bird access to the nest box is through a 25 cm long, 6.25 cm
wide tunnel. The nest box top is hinged to facilitate observations. The
box was filled with approximately 7.6 cm of wood shavings. Keeper access
to the nest box is accomplished through a small door located at the back
of the termite mound. An additional nest box was provided and located on
top of a hollow log out of the public viewing area. The hollow log has a
window cut in it, the window being covered with a red transparent plastic,
hopefully to provide public viewing of the nest activities.
In early June 1978 one of the males died leaving 2.1. On 18th October
1978, two eggs were observed in the nest box located in the termite
mound, and by the 21st, four eggs were present and incubation began. All
four eggs hatched on the 2nd of November and the young fledged on the
30th of November.
The three parent birds have nested successfully three times since the
initial success and have produced a total of 13 chicks. All of the nestings
have taken place in the termite mound except once when the nest box
was used. All chicks have been produced from the termite mound nest
site and the birds have never been observed using the hollow log for
nesting purposes.
Barbets are mainly fruit eaters in the wild, feeding occasionally on
small insects. Our diet consists of a variety of chopped fruit spread over a
softbill mix to which a ground meat mixture is added. The softbill mix
consists of the following: dry dog food, Spanish peanuts, high protein
baby cereal, monkey chow, all ground to a fme consistency, to which
we added ground carrots, whole hard boiled eggs, vitamins, minerals and
grit. Crickets and mealworms are offered on a regular basis and are relished
by the adults.
Courtship
Both males court the female simultaneously. They will pursue the
female around the enclosure, hopping from branch to branch but never
alighting next to her. After a period of five to ten minutes a male will
settle next to the female and begin a head bobbing and slight neck pecking
courtship. The male will then again settle next to the female and hover
over her, and start rubbing his throat over the entire top surface of the
female's head. This behaviour continues as the male hops over the female
and repeats the procedure on the other side. If the female is unreceptive
the other male will replace the original male and continue courting until
the female is receptive and mating takes place with only one of the males.
Male dominance has not been observed.

The female prior to and during the courtship will be busy cleaning out
the nest box. She very diligently removes all the larger pieces of wood
shavings, with the help of the males, until a 2.5 cm layer of fme sawdust
remains on the nest box floor. At this time mating and egg-laying com-
mence. The eggs are laid and incubated on this fine sawdust layer. We have
discovered that we can artificially induce the courtship - laying process
simply by placing a new layer of wood chips on the bottom of the nest
box. Eggs will be laid within a 14 day period after the introduction of the
wood chips.
Incubation and hatching
Generally four white eggs measuring 29.5 mm x 24 mm are laid in a
clutch. Clutches have varied between three and four eggs. The average of
ten clutches has been 3.6 eggs per clutch with a typical pattern of a clutch
of four followed by a clutch of three. Generally three to four clutches are
laid per year with forced resting necessary to stop production. This is
accomplished by not furnishing wood chips in the bottom of the nest
box. Infertility has been a problem resulting in 55% (20) of the eggs laid
being infertile. 37% (13) of all eggs laid have been hatched and reared
resulting in 13 chicks, and 8% (3) of all eggs laid were fertile and failed
to hatch.
Incubation lasts 13 days from the date the last egg is laid, and is accom-
plished by both sexes. Once the chicks have hatched all adults share in
the feeding. As the chicks develop, the parents begin removing the remain-
ing sawdust in the process of cleaning the nest. When the chicks are ready
to fledge the bottom of the nest box is completely bare. Of the 13 chicks
hatched and reared the sex ratio has been approximately 3:1 in favour of
males, resulting in ten males and only three females being produced. This
however, corresponds with our observed courtship patterns of more than
one male courting a single female. The chicks fledged in 28 days and are
fully feathered, capable of flight, and the colour pattern established well
enough for sexing. All chicks are sexed, using the black cap on the head
as a determinant, and banded before leaving the nest.

PROBLEMS AND PROGRESS IN THE CAPTIVE BREEDING OF
GREAT BUSTARDS Otis tarda IN QUASI-NATURAL CONDITIONS
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.996426470588235" page_id="56283869"  page_num="131" year="" vol="">
By N. J. COLLAR and P. D. GORIUP
The Great Bustard Trust's experiment on Porton Down, Wiltshire,
England, is one of several current projects to breed the Great Bustard
Otis tarda in captivity in Europe, but in two respects it is unique: it is the
only scheme to aim at reintroduction long after the birds have become
extinct as a native breeding species, and it is the only one to keep its stock
in a manner that approximates to conditions in the wild. In this paper we
present the history of the experiment, discuss some of the attendant
problems and their solutions, and report on the progress achieved in the
first ten years.
1970- 1978
The Great Bustard Trust was founded in 1970 as a private scheme by
the Hon. A. D. Tryon, a Wiltshire naturalist who runs the Tryon Wildlife
Gallery in London. Stock, consisting of wild-caught, unfledged chicks,
was acquired from Portugal, and a four hectare fox-proof pen erected on a
wide expanse of remote and ancient grassland at Porton Down, where
public access is restricted. The chicks were quarantined, acclimatised
and allowed to grow to full size at a private bird collection before being
pinioned and released into the pen. A hide was constructed from which to
observe the birds and, although for periods (especially in the summer)
they can be self-sufficient in their foraging, food is put out for them in
feeding trays every afternoon by the local farmer. Apart from this, disturb-
ance at the site is minimal, as it is several kilometres from any human
habitation. Under these conditions, the birds - apart from one precocious
male (A) - soon lost any trust for man that they had acquired as chicks,
and reverted to the wariness typical of wild birds. This is considered
essential, since it is intended that a proportion of the chicks should be
reared by their parents in circumstances which as closely as possible
resemble those in nature, so that the new generation will behave (and
can be considered) as genuinely wild birds. The pen is situated near the
top of a shallow slope, overlooking a broad valley of similar grassland,
which is bordered by cereal farmland. It is in this valley that a wild drove
is hoped to become established when offspring are ultimately allowed to
fly free of the pen.

Several disadvantages arise as a result of employing this method of
keeping, the most crucial of which concerns the birds' welfare. The pen is
big enough for any bird - but particularly the females - to 'disappear' for
several days, and this may cause anxiety for its safety. Should a bird die,
the fact need not be immediately apparent, and we may thus miss the
opportunity to perform a post-mortem examination of the fresh and intact
body. In cases of injury or disease, it is often impossible to give proper
treatment to the suffering individuals, since they cannot be caught without
causing considerable stress not only to themselves, but to the whole stock
as well. The same factor largely blocks the full implementation of plans to
improve sexual condition. The very fact that such improvement is needed
may indeed be the result of the birds' semi-captive state: pinioning is
generally recognised to decrease fertility (mere wing-clipping was dis-
counted because it would have entailed annual catching and handling),
diet itself cannot be fully regulated and checked, the birds cannot be
driven into shelter at critical periods, and so on. Finally, of course, the
quasi-natural conditions at Porton create exceptional difficulties for us
when we are attempting to guard and monitor nests.
The pen encloses an area of chalk-based, herb-rich Festuca ovina
grassland, grazed locally by rabbits Oryctolagus cuniculus. This grassland
has not been ploughed for at least a century (Wells et al. 1976), so the
turf is very close and highly developed, but we have no indication that this
kind of habitat (which was always scarce) was ever used by the extinct
British stock of Great Bustards. Our experience at Porton is certainly that
the dense sward of Festuca tends to be ignored as a feeding area (and
would be entirely unsuitable for nesting), the birds preferring the patches
of ranker Helich to trichon grass. The Trust has experimented with vari-
ous crops over the years to diversify this habitat. A central area of the
pen has been sown with rape Brassica napus, barley Hordeum vulgare,
wheat Triticum aestivum, oats Avena sativa, and a leguminous mixture.
These all failed, largely because of the poor quality of the flinty soil, and
through grazing by pigeons, corvids, rabbits and the bustards themselves.
Nevertheless, the tilling of the soil has produced a succession of taller
weeds and grasses which is clearly attractive to the birds as a source of
food and cover, since a great proportion of their time is now spent fre-
quenting this area.
From the autumn of 1977, following research by NJC (Trust Officer
1975 - 1978), now being continued by PDG, measures were taken to
improve management of the birds and the pen (see Figure 1). First, a part
of the tilled central area (the 'central plot'), measuring 0.22 ha, was fenced

off against rabbits and the bustards, and successfully sown for the 1978
season with a mixture of legumes and mustard Sinapis alba. Small 'pop-
holes', big enough for only female bustards to get through, were posi-
tioned along the fencing, so that if any breeding activity took place, the
holes could be opened and the females would be able to move into the
central plot to be free of males and have a good cover of nutritious vege-
tation in which to make their nests. The second step taken was to con-
struct a dividing fence across the centre of the pen and to separate the
sexes. This was done in response to the exceptionally disappointing
results of the very rainy 1978 spring, when all four males signally failed,
despite their ages (V eight years, A, H and R six years), to give any true
display, and when the females appeared to be at risk from a debilitating
stiffness of the leg-joints (which was affecting one bird and had already
preceded the deaths in the 1977 - 78 winter of two others) and were not
being allowed near the feeders by the males. Separation of the sexes pro-
vided the opportunity (1) to ensure that the females obtained sufficient
food (quality and quantity increased in late autumn, winter and early
spring and consisting of grain, a commercial zoo-feed for omnivores,
cabbage and young rats), not only to recover normal fitness but to come
into full breeding condition in due course; (2) to supply doses of methyl-
testosterone to the males (see below) without the risk that any might
be taken by the females; and (3) to simulate conditions found in wild
populations, where males and females tend to form single-sex flocks
throughout the year. This last consideration was reinforced by the know-
ledge that birds of certain species if reared and kept together never develop
sexual behaviour towards each other.

At the start of the 1979 season, the Trust held four males (nine, seven,
seven and seven years old) and four females (three of seven and one of
unknown age since she was obtained as a wild vagrant - see Dennis 1970).
For eight years, our stock had lived amicably together with no real indi-
cation of any form of breeding activity: no courtship, no display, and
apparently (from searches made after each spring) no scrapes. The situ-
ation was clearly unsatisfactory, and it was decided to attempt to boost
sexual activity in the males by the use of artificial treatment.
We considered three types of treatment. First, chorionic gonadotrophin
could be used to stimulate the natural production of testosterone, and is
effective in improving libido in birds without depressing fertility. It must,
however, be administered by injection, and for best results requires repe-

tition twice a week for several weeks. Second, male sex hormone (manu-
factured as methyltestosterone) could be administered orally. Third, a
small 25 mg pellet of testosterone could be implanted under the skin of
the neck for slow, steady release into the body over a period of some sixty
days. Both these two last ought certainly to increase sex drive, but there
is no guarantee that sperm-production will be initiated or even increased,
and in some instances use of testosterone may actually depress fertility.
However, chorionic gonadotrophin had to be ruled out because of prob-
lems of administration. Use of methyltestosterone was adopted for the
three 'wild' males (V, H and R), while an implant was given to the tame
male (A), who could be caught easily and without excessive stress. Hor-
monal treatment of the females was not contemplated, since the male's
display is probably at least partly responsible for triggering the develop-
ment of female reproductive condition.
On 10th February 1979, A was captured and implanted; we thus anti-
cipated the implant effect to build up alongside his own natural hormone
increase, leaving him in strong condition by mid-April. In the course of
February H jumped the dividing fence, so could not be subject to the
treatment planned for V and R. Careful observation of the feeding habits
of these two birds established their regular pattern of feeding, and hol-
lowed-out zoo-feed pellets, each holding a 5 mg methyltestosterone pill,
were positioned accordingly. Four dosed pellets were left out every even-
ing between 1st and 27th March, the object being to give two to each
male. Male A was fed by hand prior to positioning the pellets, to prevent
him wanting to eat them, but in any case his feeding station was well
away from the other two birds'. The rate of hormonal intake by V and R
was highly variable, despite these measures: sometimes one of them would
take all four pellets, but more usually neither took any. Up to the end of
March, there were no obvious signs of the hormone having any effect in
terms of aggression between males or preliminary display activity. The
relationship of the birds was much as it had always been: A was dominant,
and was deferred to by V (even though V is the older bird), and V was
dominant over R, refusing him room at the feeder; interestingly, A was
tolerant of R, and even let him feed alongside.
The position by April 1979 stood as follows:

PDG was abroad from April to June, and NJC had little time to visit
Porton during this period; we rely here on the Trust's log for April, and on
the notes made by Ms. K. Fitzherbert, who carried out detailed watches at
dawn and dusk at the pen for five weeks from May to early June.
The birds were allowed to rejoin each other on 8th April, and the first
displays by males were recorded a week later. Apart from male A, the
only other male to show any display was V; although his performances
were complete, they were seen on only eight occasions in five weeks.
A's displays were intensive and frequent, delivered in periods of 5 - 45
minutes, within which he displayed many times at different sites. In the
course of May, he gradually increased the mean length of individual dis-
plays from 117 to 447 seconds, and developed a pattern of movement
between six regular and four other sites. On his own his displays were
generally short, stationary and non-directional, but in the close presence
of a female they grew longer, and he would direct them at her by follow-
ing her around; however, no copulation was ever observed. In the last week
of recording (5th to 12th June) very little display was seen, partly perhaps
owing to poor weather conditions. However, as we later ascertained, at
least two females had by this time begun to nest and sit, and it is probable
that the decline in display activity was a direct consequence of the change
in the behaviour of these females, who would more or less have "disap-
peared".
Initially, the females showed no particular attachment to any one spot,
bui would spend time sitting at various places in the grass. For three days,
from 23rd May, however, KF observed a female that repeatedly sat for
long periods in the same place near the pen's outer fence: unfortunately
she was disturbed by people disregarding the Trust's warning notices, and
abandoned the site. In the following week, two females were seen to be
frequenting the central plot, and in the first week of June clearly began
sitting at particular spots. It is not known if one of these birds was the
female that had previously been disturbed from her site near the fence.
As it was Trust policy to restrict all disturbance to the birds, not to
enter the pen except to feed them, and to hope that the full breeding
cycle would take place there without any intervention, we could not
expect to know whether eggs had been laid until such time as we might
see a young bird following its mother around. However, on 10th June,
ADT spent the afternoon with a local aviculturist, Mr. F. K. Bromley,
watching the two sitting hens. After a time, one of the birds stood up and
left her presumed nest to feed, whereupon a Rook Corvus frugilegus
flew down to the spot and began hacking at something on the ground.
ADT and FKE instantly intervened, causing severe panic to all the bustards,

and particularly to the two females who were trapped inside the central plot.
Where the rook had landed they found a nest with two eggs, one with
a large hole in it, and at the other site a scrape filled only with egg-shell
fragments. It seemed probable that the female would desert her nest after
such a disturbance, and inevitable that even if she did not, she would soon
lose her one intact egg. Gewalt (1959) considered that "since the hen
bustard remains only a short distance from the nest during her break from
incubation . . . crows . . . can rarely have much success" (NJC's trans-
lation); unfortunately, the Porton birds have to live with large numbers of
Rooks coming to the pen to take food from the hoppers and are therefore
perhaps too familiar with them to regard them as enemies. However, even
wild cranes Grus grus have been known to stand and watch while crows C
corone attacked their eggs (England 1963). It was decided to remove both
eggs for artificial incubation in FKB's facilities some 20 miles away.
The punctured egg was fertile, as blood vessels could be seen through
the hole; but after one night in the incubator it was removed as the yolk
had begun bubbling out from under the seal. The embryo it contained was
in a very early stage of development, and indeed the degree of putre-
faction in the egg raised the suspicion that it might have died in the shell
some time before the Rook attacked. The egg was certainly small, measur-
ing 71.8 x 51.1 mm; the empty shell weighed 11.55 g. These dimensions
agree exactly with captive-laid non-fertile eggs from Spain in the Oxford
Museum (mean 70.2 x 51.9 mm, 11.2 g; n = 4), but very poorly with the
dimensions of wild-laid eggs in the British and Oxford Museums (mean
79.0 x 55.9 mm, 14.7 g; n = 122). It is possible, therefore, that the egg's
volume was insufficient for the embryo to survive.
The intact was not measured, to reduce handling. It was kept in the
self-turning incubator until a domestic hen turned reliably broody on 13th
June, and was then placed under her, together with a similar sized dummy
egg to discourage sitting too tightly. FKB considered the use of broody
hens preferable to mechanical incubation, since in his experience the latter
method produces a considerably lower hatching success. However, the
hen immediately and emphatically rejected the egg, rolling it from the nest
and cracking it. After being cleaned and sealed, it was replaced in the
incubator, where it eventually began pipping at 05.30 on 28th June (so it
was almost certainly laid, as suspected, during the first week of June). By
10.30 it was chipped half-way round, but the chick seemed to be in diffi-
culties and was finally helped from the shell at 11.30 and placed in a drier.
The next morning, the chick was moved to a small rearing-box with a heat
lamp, and fed on house crickets Acheta domesticus with some liquid (milk
and water) and grit, largely in accordance with Gewalt and Gewalt (1966).

After a promising start, on the morning of 1st July it began showing signs
of weakness in the legs, and, despite a temporary recovery, died during the
night of 2nd July. Post-mortem examination revealed the presence of
enteritis caused by Escherichia coli bacteria; and it seems likely that this
disease developed as a consequence of physical stress, partly caused by
our inability at that vital stage to obtain a keeper exclusively to look
after the bird and answer its distress ('lost') calls, which all bustard chicks
immediately and repeatedly give when they lose sight and sound of their
keepers. The stress may also have been the result of a difficult hatching,
and we must now establish the body temperature of an adult bustard in
order to adjust the incubator accordingly, since too high a temperature
may cause hardening of the shell membranes. As a further precaution,
we would give small doses of antibiotic to any future chicks from the day
of hatching to ensure that E. coli bacteria are controlled.
The death of our first-ever chick was an unfortunate event within what
must still be regarded as a very satisfactory development. As far as we are
aware, the Trust has become only the fifth establishment experimenting
with the captive breeding of Great Bustards to achieve fertile eggs, the
others being the Scampston Aviaries in 1901 (St. Quintin 1904), West
Berlin Zoo in 1962-64 (Gewalt 1964), East Berlin Zoo in 1972 (Grummt
1977) and Oberweiden, Austria in 1975 (R. Lutkens in litt). We must
now consider the measures to be taken in future to maximise the breeding
chances of our now reproductive stock.
1980 and beyond
Apart from the points made above concerning the care of eggs and
chicks, we should increase our chances of future successful breeding by
attending to the following key issues:
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.882386333333333" page_id="56283877"  page_num="137" year="" vol="">
(a) libido of the males;

<bodyText confidence="0.9877972" page_id="56283877"  page_num="137" year="" vol="">
It seems certain that the hormonal implant administered to A dramati-
cally improved his display performance; V, who received testosterone
orally, may also have been influenced. R's long-standing subordination to
the other males probably explains his lack of display, and it is perhaps
significant that H, who received no hormone, gave no display either. A

will therefore receive another implant in the coming season, and the oral
treatment via the diet of the other males may also be repeated, although
we shall probably seek a more effective medium than solid tablets (e.g. a
liquid in gelatin capsules, to improve absorption of the hormone into the
bloodstream).
(b) Condition of the females
Hens will only be responsive to the males if they are in good health and
have high reserves of energy. The best way to achieve this is to keep them
separate from the males so that they can have free access to high-quality
foodstuffs. In addition it is intended this autumn (1979) to sow the
central plot with winter rape to which the females alone will have access
and where they can forage under more natural conditions.
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.70983" page_id="56283878"  page_num="138" year="" vol="">
(c) Availability of nest sites
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.986826333333333" page_id="56283878"  page_num="138" year="" vol="">
Studies in Portugal and elsewhere indicate that great bustards favour
broken-soil conditions with high cover for nesting, and that nesting density
is relatively low. To simulate these requirements at Porton, the rape in the
central plot will be allowed to run to seed, and two additional patches
will be rotovated close to the hide and a mixed rough herbage of winter
barley and weeds encouraged to grow on them. Thus there will be a set of
choices open to the females: mature rape, rough cereal crop, and the
present close, rank turf surrounding both. By spacing these areas out,
females will have the opportunity to avoid each other.
(d) Procedure with eggs and chicks
The danger constituted by the present high density of Rooks frequent-
ing the pen must be reduced. The attraction of food has now been mini-
mised by the introduction of specially designed hoppers that prevent
access to Rooks and other species such as pheasants Phasianus colchicus
and Grey Squirrels Sciurus carolinensis. The central plot has been covered
over (roof and sides) with 10 cm mesh polythene netting, to prevent
access by large flying birds (the bustards can continue to enter by the
'pop-holes'. To maximise breeding success, we have moreover to consider
the following points: (i) conditions at Porton probably do not favour the
successful rearing of more than one chick per year by any one female;
(ii) where we can guarantee nest security against predation, nests should
as a general rule be left alone, but (iii) we might make it standard practice,
where no disturbance will be caused, to take away a proportion of eggs
from each known clutch, first to secure them against predation, desertion,

We might therefore remove both eggs of two-egg clutches and two eggs of
three-egg clutches laid outside the guaranteed area (i.e. the central plot),
substituting dummy eggs that will permit the female to continue to
incubate; when the artificially incubated eggs show signs of pipping in
the two-egg clutches, one could be replaced and both substituted eggs
removed, so that the female has the chance to rear this young. There are
further permutations which might prove helpful, but all that we say on
this topic is hypothetical and strictly dependent on minimising risks of
disturbance; this is why alternative strips of cereal will be made near the
hide, so that we can observe when females have left the nest to feed and
then intervene quickly and safely.
We should like to conclude by inviting comments, ideas and advice
from anyone interested in the Trust's project, and by asking any British
aviculturalist who keeps any species of bustard to write to us with details.

By L, GIBSON (Burnaby, British Columbia, Canada.)
This handsome bird is scarcely known outside its natural range, which
is mainly the whole Pacific coast of North America. It is found from
Alaska to as far south as Nicaragua. The further south it goes, the higher
up it stays, so that it is still a bird of cool coniferous forests, even in the
tropics.
These notes are on the nominate race, and there are at least two other
types described. One is a darker, slightly larger race on British Columbian
coastal islands and another is a lighter coloured, slightly smaller, Rocky
Mountain race, distinguished by a white eyebrow. There is a fourth dis-
puted race.
One of the larger jays, it weighs around 145 g. In the book Ravens,
Crows , Magpies and Jays by Tony Ange&apos;ll, Steller's Jay is listed at 84.75 g.
The weights in grams are quaintly given up to four decimal places and are
obviously calculated from the original ounces. So the Steller's weight of
three ounces is probably a misprint for five. Because of this, I checked the
weights of some corvids in my records. These were as follows, with the
book's figures in brackets.
Pica pica - Magpie 185 (170) tame adult.
Nucifraga columbiana - Clark's Nutcracker 127 (113. 4). This bird was
only five to six months old, so could be expected to put on some weight.
Cyanocorax yncas - Green Jay 79.5 (99.225). This was an adult male in
breeding condition. The hen was lighter.
Although of course there will be some variation with circumstances,
it would appear that the weights in the book were roughly measured with
insensitive scales, to the nearest half ounce or so.
The wings,, tail and back of the Steller's is a beautiful, darkish metallic
blue. The rest of the body is dark grey, being almost black on the head
and neck and lighter grey on the underside. In the forest, it appears all
black. It has a permanent crest which adds to its exotic appearance and
I have always thought that it looks out of place in temperate climates.
In the breeding season the birds can be sexed from close quarters. The

cock becomes very dark about the head and shoulders, while the hen is
greyer, although both look black from any distance. I think the cock is
larger, but have not checked on this much as there is not a great incentive
to breed them. The birds have turquoise stripes on the forehead, and
there might be a sex difference in these, as was noted on the forehead of
C. yncas. This will be checked.
Steller's is a typical jay in every way. At one point 1 had two other
species as well. These were the common Eurasian G. glandarius and the
Green Mexican C yncas. All three had the same mannerisms and behaviour
and they all communicated freely with one another in the same language.
I think this shows a closer relationship than the various generic classi-
fications would suggest.
A decade ago, these birds were not too common in the greater Van-
couver area. They were found in the adjacent forests above the city, and
only showed up during heavy snow. For five years 1 distributed orphans
and injured birds in the immediate vicinity of my home, and now these
jays are quite common locally.
At about the same time there was a slow spread into the suburbs
and farmlands from the forested heights. However, I like to think that the
local population is mostly due to the released birds. Some of these came
from the S.P.C.A. and some later from the Parks Department "Nature
House", which operates a temporary bird and small animal rescue pro-
gramme in the summer. Lately, baby jays came to be prominent in the
collection. Perhaps they are just more obvious than most other chicks.
Robins are overwhelmingly the commonest foundlings, as there is a
robin's nest in every garden. Steller's chicks are rather prone to leaving
(or falling from) the nest at an early age. Then their greatest danger is
from the hordes of cats that are kept by the hordes of unimaginative
suburbanites. If cats were licenced, they would disappear overnight.
Even although jays will come to a feeding station, especially in hard
weather, they are always wary. Usually they are in pairs, and one will stay
on watch in a tree, while the other eats. Sometimes the food gatherer will
take food to the watcher, or they will change places. The throat is packed
first and then the bill is crammed to capacity. Food is brought to the nest
this way, and in winter it is carried off in this manner, and stored in
nooks and crannies.
If food is not scarce, as in the summer, they content themselves by
carrying a large piece from the feeding table to a nearby branch, where
the food is held under a foot and consumed at leisure.
Their reserve about humans is both their salvation and downfall.

They usually persist in nesting high up, away from people, and I have
never seen a nest anywhere other than in a conifer. This situation makes
them vulnerable to their constant enemy and only major predator - the
Common Crow. The crows, which themselves are too wary to come down
much below roof height in suburban areas, have no trouble in picking
off nestlings or eggs from the treetops. The jays are frustratingly helpless
before the crows, and simply hop around and make a lot of noise. By con-
trast, the robin T. migratorius will not hesitate to strike a crow, and
yet the robin is just over half the weight of a Steller's. Robins will viol-
ently drive crows away. Even a humming bird chased a crow from the
garden by buzzing furiously round its head. The crow had been staking
out the hummer's nest, and they watch with endless patience to locate
one nest.
Across the road are three tall old conifers, which have now been top-
ped at about 50-60 feet. The original name of the small stream beneath
them is Eagle Creek, so called by the Indians because Bald Eagles were
said to have nested regularly in these trees. For five years in a row, a pair
of Steller's Jays nested just below the top of one of the trees. In that time
they only succeeded in raising two chicks, one in each of two seasons.
Crows disposed of all the other chicks and eggs. Often the marauder was
just a single crow, foraging for its own chicks. Sometimes a pair came, and
on at least one occasion a pair of crows brought a juvenile and proceeded
to stuff it with Steller's chicks, while the jays did nothing but scream.
These jays were probably the same two birds all the time as they mate for
life, and they were then the only pair of Steller's within miles of here.
In the sixth year, one bird (the cock) went missing in the late winter.
Early in the spring, I released three young adults, which were found as
injured chicks the previous summer. One bird was easily recognisable by
the way it stood with one leg slanting sideways, as it had not been set too
straight when it was a chick. This scarcely inconvenienced the bird at all.
This cock bird was the tamest of the three which all remained in the
vicinity. They showed up at ever lengthening intervals, then two never
came back. Crooked leg (C.L.) came back regularly and, especially when it
was wet, he would shelter in his old aviary which was left open and sup-
plied daily with food. In March I began to build a large new aviary, and
the jay often sat on the structure and I fed him snacks. A thick row of
evergreen Chamaecyparis formed one side of the aviary. Progress was
slow because it rained a lot, and also because I am a slow builder.
One day, C.L. showed up with a companion trailing at a discreet
distance. The old wild hen was still around and I think it was this bird, as

L. GIBSON - STELLER'S JAY
there were no others in the area except the released birds, all of which I
could recognise. The new bird would not come down for food until I
left, but it became used to my presence on the aviary beams and would
come as close as the far end of the aviary. One day I noticed both birds
going in and out of a particular tree, just about the height of the aviary
roof. Sure enough, there was a nest base made in it. I continued to slowly
build the aviary around them in the evenings and weekends, and at the
same time managed to watch the birds. The nest itself could just be seen
from a side window in the house. A platform of large twigs was laced to-
gether with some dry grass. Then a slightly elliptical earthen bowl was
built on this. It contained about 1000 g. of earth and was unlined. It
measured 5 Vi in. (14 cm) across one way and 5 3 A in. (14.5 cm) across
another, as it was not quite round. The depth was 2Vi in. (6.5 cm).
These are the inner sizes of the bowl. The weight of earth is only very
approximate, as no account was taken of the moisture content. Perhaps
the volume should have been measured.
I could only positively identify C.L. if I saw him at a convenient angle,
but he was definitely a cock. From limited viewing, I think the hen did
most of the building while the cock brought most of the material. I
almost finished the aviary then left it when the birds were on four eggs.
The laying date was not noted, but I checked the hatching and fledging
time. The eggs were greenish with brown spots. For three weeks, from
the time the chicks hatched, it poured almost every day. The hen incu-
bated steadily and the cock brought food. When the chicks hatched, this
system continued for about a week, then both parents went off for food.
When the chicks were a week old I enclosed the aviary, but a bit was left
off the roof for the birds. By the time the chicks were eight days old,
it was so wet that the parents were getting waterlogged going in and out
of the sodden trees. They were reluctant to fly out in the downpour
and were getting desperate, as the chicks were clamouring for food. I
had been feeding C.L. sporadically until now and he had been taking
the food to his mate, and later to the chicks. I decided to close the birds
in at this point, as the nest was in the aviary shelter area. The hen was
not too nervous about this at all. She only became disturbed if I appro-
ached the nest, but I seldom did this as it could be seen from the window.
The birds were given a large bowl of soaked dog chow as a staple, with
leftover egg and bread from the other aviaries. This was fed to the chicks
who thrived on it. The chicks were also fed budgie grit by the parents.
They may also have used eggshell. Grit is used by all my omniverous
birds and I would not be surprised it it is used universally by birds of
similar habits.

At 15 days, the nest was completely filled by three chicks, and the
fourth had to sit on the rim until they fledged at 21-22 days
(not necessarily the same chick of course). This is probably why so many
chicks are found prematurely out of the nest. When they left the nest on
16th May, they were all let out of the aviary. The chicks could only flap
a few feet and were surprisingly unafraid. I could almost pick them up.
Obviously they learn their wariness. Within 3-4 days they could fly quite
well and were just as shy as wild birds. They then left with the parents
and stayed in the customary family group. The pair never returned to
the nesting site. I do not think that they are normally double-brooded,
as family groups can be seen all summer. They will, of course, attempt
several nests if they do not succeed in raising chicks. These groups are
a good way of judging nesting success. Usually there are one or two (or
no) chicks, rarely three. I have never seen four, although this is the usual
clutch number. The family usually splits up with the onset of cold wea-
ther, and I suspect the young then pair off for the coming nesting season,
and indeed for life. One rarely sees a single bird, and pairs are the rule
at winter feeding stations.
Steller's Jay flies weakly, with a few wing-beats followed by a long
glide. They usually travel from tree to tree and are reluctant to cross
wide open spaces. If they are forced to cross a space, they never fly
above the height of the cover they are heading for. Twelve successive
wing-beats were the most I noted, but 3-5 is more usual, even in a long
flight.
Steller's in the aviary or garden made exactly the same calls as the
other two species mentioned, with an obvious "accent" difference. All
three species responded in the same way to a call made by any one. The
common call is the harsh repetitive caw which cannot be transliterated.
North American bird watchers tend to anthropomorphise and have a pen-
chant for trying to transliterate all bird calls, and come up with some
really useless efforts. The call of the jay is commonly rendered as "shook-
shook-shook" which is as bad an example as any. The mating "song" is
a double call like the teeth of a comb being run together. The first one is
level and the second one lower and slightly descending. This is usually
followed by a metallic "plink". This "burring" call is usually recognisable
in all corvids. The cock "burrs" incessantly in spring, and the hen calls
too, but with less persistence. The Steller's Jay has a beautiful subsong,
and tame birds have sung for many minutes on end. This cannot be heard
unless you are standing beside the bird. The variety and tones, however
quiet, compare with the best avian songsters.

L. GIBSON - STELLER'S JAY
The Steller's (and possibly others) have a wild loud babble which few
people have heard, and is commonest in spring. I thought it was a mating
call, until 1 heard some young birds make it, although it still may be. It
is very reminiscent of a laughing thrush. These jays are excellent mimics.
One day when I came home 1 got a bad scare when I heard a Garrulax
leucolophus call from a tree. Both thrushes were still in the aviary, and
the perfect call was being made by a tame three-month old Steller's. This
bird came and went freely, but one day it jumped into a shallow fish
tank, and although rescued, it died from exhaustion or chilling. It was
not known how long it was in the water, but was found swimming along
with its wings, and its feet could almost touch the bottom.
At first it was thought that it jumped in after goldfish fry, but at least
two other drownings of Steller's chicks were noted, and in one case the
bird went to great lengths to squeeze under some safety netting, and
drowned in a fish pond. They seem to have a fatal attraction to water.
Although fledglings make excellent tame pets, every bird that was
released gradually reverted to the wild. This was probably helped by
wild birds with which they inevitably teamed up. If over four weeks
old, they won't tame.
The Steller's is very unaggressive for a jay and I have kept a variety of
smaller birds with them. Although reported as nest robbers, they are not
troublesome around this area. In fact it is the only large bird kept here
that has not caused any trouble for smaller cage mates. On the other hand,
it will fight if pushed, and I once had to rescue a young one from five
White-crested Garrulax. Two were under the jay and three on top. Like
other jays it eats anything, and, as noted, will feed the chicks on non-live
food. Vegetable material forms a large part of the natural diet, and even
fledglings are fed a good deal on this. One 25-day old chick was seen to
feed a 17-day old chick. These babies were in wjth the Mexican jays,
from which there was no response, other than curiosity, to the begging
chick.
They are rather hard on aviary plants, and are prone to peeling off
green bark,, otherwise they are very easy to cater for. They bathe freq-
uently, like all my other softbills. They will occasionally stab the perch
hard as do other jays. The Yncas did this much more frequently than the
Steller's. I think this is more an expression of nervousness than aggression.
There are now at least six resident pairs of Steller's Jays in this area,
which is well wooded with stands of tall conifers. Probably six of these
are released birds. A further seven chicks were saved in 1979 and five
were successfully rehabilitated. Two others with badly set wings are in

When I checked in at the rescue centre in the summer, it was with
mixed feelings that I heard the bird lady, Miss Chandler, say "Nothing
unusual today; only three robins and a Steller's".

The Blue-tailed Emerald is a small humming bird being under 3 inches
in total length and an average weight of only three grammes. With this
wide ranging species there are noticeable variations in plumage and bill
colour of both male and female. The pair I have observed originated from
Ecuador.
Description:
Male: All underparts glittering emerald green, forehead, crown and lores
glittering golden green. All other upper plumage including lesser middle
and greater wing-coverts shining bronze green, tail steel blue and slightly
forked. Femoral, feathers dark grey, bill, feet and claws black.
Female: All underparts pale grey; all upper plumage shining green, bronze
green on forehead and crown, black band across ear-coverts bordered
above by pale grey streak behind eye. Femoral feathers white. Tail is blue-
black tipped pale grey, bill, feet and claws black.

R. J. ELGAR - BLUE-TAILED EMERALD
The Blue-tailed Emerald ranges from Costa Rica, south to Colombia,
west Ecuador, Peru and Bolivia, through the Amazon Valley to Aruba
and Trinidad where it inhabits the tropical to sub-tropical zones, from sea
level to an altitude of 8,500 feet, preferring open areas and the edges of
deciduous woodlands, hedgerows, open savanas and cultivated areas. It
regularly visits town gardens feeding from flowers and ornamental hedges.
The pair observed were housed indoors in a small flight 84 inches
long, 36 inches high and 18 inches wide. They spent most of the day at
opposite ends using separate nectar tubes, but roosted together at night.
Once both Emeralds completed their moult the male began displaying
regularly to the female. Although at times he was very persistent he was
never aggressive, so the female could cope with his attention without
getting stressed.
I have divided the display into four phases.
1. The male, usually singing on his resting perch will cease singing, become
tight feathered and make several agitated movements from side to side
while still perched. He will then take flight making several passes over the
female. He will then take up position in front of her (see pos. A) approxi-
mately ten inches and slightly below her. Continually uttering a buzzing
song he will slowly advance till almost touching her then quickly revert
to his starting position in front of her. He makes rapid arc shaped move-
ments from side to side taking position in front of her once more. If the
female remains perched the male will go into phase two.
2. This consists of the male hovering in front of her as in phase one but
instead of making the arc shaped flight he will fly completely over her
before presenting himself in front of her once more. The male will do this
circular flight between one and three times during the display, taking it
into phase three.
3. The male takes up the frontal position then flies over the female
in the circular movement but instead of arriving in front of her he will take
hold of her vent feathers (see Pos. B) - singing continually. This usually
makes the female take flight, though if she still remains passive the male will
release his hold on her, taking up position A. once more.
4. In the last phase instead of a circular flight or vent pecking he reverts
back to phase one, but then flies over the female and copulates. If the
female is willing this is usually indicated by the female vibrating her wings.
The whole of the display only takes a matter of seconds. If the female is
not receptive to the male's attention she will usually take flight during
any part of the display.

Summary:
It is not until after the completion of their moult that captive
humming birds start displaying regularly. The male humming bird is
usually the instigator of the display - though it is not unusual for a
female in breeding condition to fly over to the male and persuade him to
start displaying.
I found the Emerald to be tolerant of each other and the male only
used his display to that purpose and not for aggression.

PERSONAL OBSERVATIONS ON STOCK DOVES
By DEREK GOODWIN (Herne Hill, London)
Introduction
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.996518088235294" page_id="56283891"  page_num="151" year="" vol="">
Of the five species of pigeons that now occur in Britain, the Stock Dove
Columba oenas is the one least known to the general public. I think this is
mostly due to the fact that, although smaller than either, the Stock Dove
is in some respects oddly intermediate between the Wood Pigeon and the
Rock Pigeon (and its feral descendents). Though smaller in size, its color-
ation is very much what one would expect to get in a hybrid between
Rock Pigeon and Wood Pigeon, while in its habits it is in some respects
intermediate also.
Those of my readers who are familiar with the bird can skip this bit,
but for those who are not, I will briefly describe it. A little smaller than
a Rock Pigeon, or feral pigeon of dovecote pigeon ancestry, and appre-
ciably smaller than a racing pigeon or Wood Pigeon. It resembles a Rock
or feral pigeon in shape but is a little more compact, its wings are pro-
portionately a shade shorter and its tail longer than a Rock Pigeons but
nearer to that bird in proportions than to a Wood Pigeon. Its general
coloration is a slightly darker and bluer grey than a Wood Pigeon's.
There is a paler grey central area to the wing which is not noticeable when
the wings are folded and not very noticeable if one spreads a Stock Dove's
wing in one's hand yet, when the bird is in flight at a little distance, this
pale central area is very conspicuous and, contrasting strongly with the
black ends of the primaries and secondaries, forms a good field character.
Two short black bars (see sketches) cross the upper parts of the folded
wings. There is a shining green and mauve patch either side of the neck.
The breast is mauve-pink but not so extensively so as in the wood Pigeon.
The tail is similar (but not identical) in pattern to that of a Rock Pigeon
or blue feral pigeon. The bill is yellowish or dull white with a pink base
and powdery white cere but looks entirely pinkish at a little distance. The
irides are very dark brown so that the eye appears black and lustrous and
gives the bird a gentle expression which rather belies it.
As I have dealt in previous works (Goodwin 1955 and 1970)with its
ecology and habits, I shall here just briefly recapitulate except for certain
aspects not or not so fully dealt with before. The Stock Dove feeds almost
entirely on the ground, taking mainly seeds of various wild plants. Among
the seeds it takes in quantity are many that are considered weeds of culti-

vation such as Sinapsis, Brassica, Polygonum, Stellaria, Chenopodium and
especially those of vetches Vicia when available. It also takes cultivated
grains and pulses but as it does not alight on growing plants nor dig deeply,
it probably does little if any harm to man's interest. This has not pre-
vented it from being clased as "vermin" in Britain and placed on the
"black list", along with, among others, all its congeners and the rather
uncommon and beautiful Goosander Mergus merganser.
The Stock Dove nests in holes in trees, sea or inland cliffs and old
buildings. I shall discuss further some aspects of its nesting habits and
of possible competition with other hole nesters. Like other hole nesting
birds it has suffered from the continually increasing destruction of old
trees and plastering up of the holes in live ones. This is done not only
by forestry interests but also, less justifiably, by tidy-minded councils
and other busybodies whose idea of natural beauty does not apparently
extend further than a close-mown official lawn (no playing on it, no
treading on it, no lying on it) with an exotic tree planted at one end of
it and a geometrical bed of flowers (new monthly at the taxpayer's ex-
pense) at the other. It is, I believe, because of this ever increasing de-
struction of so many of its nesting sites that the Stock Dove, although
it to some extent recovered from its population "crash" of 20 years ago,
is nothing like as numerous as it was when I was a boy and has now gone
from some areas where it was found even about six years or so ago.
When it cannot find a hole to nest in, the Stock Dove will make do
with the old nests of Wood Pigeons or other birds, masses of debris in
trees or (so it is said but I have never seen a nest in such a place) with the
ground under thick bushes. It is likely that such sites are less successful
thn hole nests. Other and often overlooked side effects of the present
day shortage of nesting holes for many birds are increased competition
for such holes as there are and (because there are fewer for them to search
in vain) the greater likelihood of predators robbing the nest. Of these
latter the Tawny Owl Strix aluco and on the Continent of Europe also
the Beech Marten Martes foina sometimes catch and kill the hen Stock
Dove at night in her nest hole.

From the age of 12 to the age of 16, the Stock Dove was to me some-
thing of a mystery bird. It was common enough; indeed in the 1930's it
was much commoner in many parts of Surrey and Middlesex (and pro-
bably elsewhere) that it is now. Flocks of up to 100 or more could often
be seen in the fields near our house. Yet neither I, nor any of my bird-

nesting contemporaries, had ever found a Stock Dove's nest. I knew from
my bird books what sort of nesting sites the Stock Dove chose but they
seemed never to have chosen those that I climbed to! Once, indeed,
climbing with difficulty up a gnarled old oak, I heard a pigeon fly out
from a hollow just above me. Never having been close to a Stock Dove I
did not then know its distinctive light and whistling wing sound, could
not look up because all my efforts had to be momentarily devoted to
keeping my footing and handage, but my heart leapt with excitement
as I felt sure that my long held ambition to find a Stock Dove's nest had
at last been fulfilled. Alas! to my bitter disappointment, the two squabs
in the large and rather "open" hollow were not the never-yet-seen and
long-hoped-for young of Columba oenas but the familiar young of the
Wood Pigeon C palumbus. None of my books had told me that the Wood
Pigeon sometimes nests in hollows in trees nor had I ever found it doing
so before but I was not at the time at all pleased with my"new" discovery.
Then, in June 1936, some four months after my 16th birthday, things
changed. A lad of my age, whom I knew, had found the nest of a Tawny
Owl earlier in the year in a large hole in an ancient and enormous conifer.
He was a practical lad who classed such wildlife as came into his hands in
one of three categories: creatures that could be eaten by himself or his
family; creatures that, although not regarded as edible to humans, could be
fed to his ferrets; and (best of all in his view) creatures that could be sold,
if only at very low prices, to his schoolmates. The three young Tawny
Owls had come into this latter category so taken and sold they had been.
I was at that time looked upon as something of a local bird expert
by those who knew me, an honour due more to their ignorance than to my
knowledge. Hence, about two weeks after the young owls had been sold,
their seller called on me one day with an excited query. He had re-visited
the Tawny Owl's late nesting hole and to his surprise, a pigeon such as
he had never seen before, had flown off two eggs therein. It had perched
on a bough quite near and he had had a good view of it (it did the same
when I visited the nest, the only wild Stock Dove I have ever known to
behave in such a manner), it was not a "woody" C. palumbus nor an
"ordinary" C livia ... By this time my heart was fairly thumping with a
heady mixture of excitement and envy. I knew what he had found even
before he went on to describe his mystery pigeon as "like a little blue-bar
but with short bars and a pale beak".
A few days later we visited the nest together and, when the bird again
perched near on being flushed, I had my first close view of a Stock Dove.
How I lusted after the as yet unhatched squabs! In our youthful sub-

culture, the contents of any bird's nest was held to belong absolutely and
irrevocably to the boy who first found it, so I had to bargain with my
companion. He drove a hard bargain but never profited from it for, on our
next visit, we found the Stock Dove's eggs gone and a great deal of
plumage from one of the parents in their place. Presumably one of the
pairs of bereaved Tawny Owls had come at night, caught the female
Stock Dove on the nest and probably, something else, attracted by the
feathers, had investigated and taken the eggs.
However, disappointing as this was, the curse of the unfindability of
Stock Doves' nests had evidently been lifted. A week or so later, when
I was walking at the edge of a wood, a Stock Dove flew from a hole
low in a beech tree at the side of the path. It was a hole well known to
me, one that for many years had "never been any good". Now, when I
investigated it, I found a young Stock Dove just beginning to "feather";
the ideal age to take for hand-rearing. My first feeling was of sheer ecstasy,
my second tinged it with regret that there was only one squab instead of
the more usual two. Home with my prize, I took a blue chequer domestic
pigeon a little (but not much) older than the Stock Dove, to keep it warm
enough and because two young birds are usually easier to rear and thrive
better than one, and put them together. I have described before (Goodwin
1955) the methods I used to handrear young wild (and domestic) pigeons
so will not repeat them here.
Nor was this Stock Dove long the only one of its kind in my possession.
By the time it was fully feathered, I had two more. Obtaining them was a
piquant adventure or criminal effrontery according to how you look at it.
About two miles from my home was the country seat of a nobleman
(actually one interested in ornithology, now unfortunately dead, who was
amused when I "confessed" this "robbery" to him, very many years
after it occured). At the back of the house, in front of a sort of enormous
conservatory-cum-lounge or something, lawns ran down to an ornamental
pond on the other side of which was an old walnut tree. Now whatever
may be the case with women and dogs, walnut trees are never better (at
least for the would-be Stock Dove keeper) than when they have been long
left alone to suffer the manifold ills which trees of their kind are heir to
and which result in the development of a profusion of holes, hollows and
crannies unsurpassed by any other trees except the Australian eucalyptus.
This walnut tree had long been left to its own devices and diseases;
though I had never seen it from nearer than the public road that ran past
about 200 yards or more away., it "looked good" even from that distance.
Anyway, to get to the meat of the matter, one day, soon after getting my

one young squab, I was cycling along this road when I saw a Stock Dove
fly out of the walnut tree. Somehow I knew that it had been there to feed
nestlings in one of the hollows. It was one of the very few times in my life
when I have felt a sort of sixth sense. There could have been many other
reasons for a Stock Dove flying out of the tree at that particular moment
and I was quite aware of this. The rational part of my brain told me I
was being a fool, wishful thinking etc. etc., but to no avail; I knew there
were young Stock Doves somewhere in the walnut tree.
How to get them? Trespass by daylight was just not on, the tree's
position made discovery almost certain. Especially as I did not know
how many holes there were in it or where they were and should have to
find and explore them all. But by night? Was that possible? I decided,
with help, it might be. The next day I was going to the theatre with a
friend a few years older than me. In these days, when even "well-to-do"
people have to think twice about a once-yearly theatre visit, that may
sound as if I was a very wealthy young man. Far from it, at that time I
earned #1 a week but it bought considerably more than #50 a week would
today. I suggested to my friend that, with his help, I could go and try
to get the young Stock Doves that night after we had returned from the
theatre. He, very reasonably, doubted the likelihood of there being any
Stock Doves in the tree or of my being able to find them in the dark if
there were, nor did he much like the whole unlawful project. However,
a joint appeal to his better nature ( couldn't do it without his help) and
his pride (was he scared?) suceeded and he promised to accompany me,
only stipulating that I must climb the tree.
I was myself (though I did not admit it) nervous about the whole
enterprise. This increased after we had managed to get our bicycles over
the fence bordering the road (lest a passing policeman should see them
and, succumbing to the vice of curiosity, investigate further) and had
tramped through the wet grass to the edge of the pond. The tree was,
fortunately, ideal for my purpose. In full light it would have been easy
to climb and even in the near darkness, I managed it somehow. As I
was being pushed helpfully up towards the first branches, a loud splash
in the pond made both our hearts "leap into our mouths" but the sound
was not repeated and our worst fears, that it was some human being, were
soon allayed.
Once fairly in the tree, I almost began to doubt my "sixth sense",
especially after the first hollow that I found, more by touch than by
sight, merely rewarded my groping hand with some unpleasantly damp
substrate at the bottom. But second time was lucky. After some vain

and rather frightening clambering about, I was almost, but not quite, in
a mood to accede to my comrade's repeated sot to voce urgings to give
up the whole risky escapade and go home, when I found another hole,
groped blindly into its depths and - joy of joys - felt the warm feathered
bodies of two young Stock Doves!
When I got back home I found the young birds were fully feathered
although not yet able to fly. They behaved as is usual with young wild
pigeons taken at that age; that is they were at first shy and resisted hand
feeding, within a day or so appeared to have accepted me as substitute
parent, and eagerly cooperated in hand feeding, but, as soon as they were
well able to pick up food for themselves became shy again. This in spite
of the good example of the other Stock Dove and the young domestic
pigeon. These latter, which were kept with them, having been taken
at the right age were, of course, absolutely tame and remained so in adult-
hood. When I tried to "settle" all four birds, the Stock Doves that had
been taken from the Walnut tree soon disappeared. No doubt they joined
their wild kindred. The first one, a hen, stayed with me, flying free by
day and coming in to the shelter of her aviary, together with the domestic
pigeon, with which she had been reared, to roost every evening. He proved
to be imprinted on Stock Doves, at least he showed no sexual interest
in the many domestic pigeons I then kept (his parents among them),
except for feeding and resting by day with them, as did the little hen
Stock Dove, with whom he paired the following year.
I was puzzled ( and still am) that I never saw them bill or copulate
and they may not have actually mated at all as their first clutch of eggs,
on which they both shared incubation spells in the usual and typical
manner, were apparently sterile. Unfortunately the cock pigeon was acci-
dentally killed and the Stock Dove never bred again. I think she might
have accepted another domestic pigeon but none courted her and she
made no attempt to "set her cap" at any of them. On the contrary it now
became clear that she also regarded humans as social companions and she
"set her cap" at me. She clearly regarded me as her mate, greeting me
with the bowing display whenever I entered the aviary shelter (her nesting
territory). I have not seen other Stock Doves that I knew or thought to
be hens give the bowing display (although hen Rock and Speckled Pigeons
give defensive and hostile versions of their species' bowing displays) so
this may have been a piece of masculine behaviour that was shown only
because she had no adequate mate to suppress it. She would swoop down
off the roof or out of the air onto my hand when I raised it and called to
her and this gave me a great deal of pleasure and, it must be confessed,

opportunity for a certain amount of vain exhibitionism among my con-
temporaries.
Human memory is an odd thing. Although I can remember this Stock
Dove vividly, I cannot recall how long I had her or what became of her. I
conclude that she must have "come to a bad end" and memory of this
sad event has been (unconsciously) expunged from my mind. I can see
her now, as I write, as clearly as if she were sitting on my hand now as
she did so many years ago. She was a small and very neat looking Stock
Dove and had beautifully clear bright pinkish red legs and feet, unlike
some females which have the legs and feet tinged with a dusky grey,
hers were as bright as those of any male Stock Dove I have since seen.
Several more young Stock Doves were handreared in the next few
years and most lost when trying to settle them. A pair which I kept
captive bred in 1939 though their young, having been reared by their
own parents, were wild, soon disappeared when liberated and were not
really regretted. This pair of Stock Doves were among the birds which
I left to the care of others when I was called up into the army early in
1940, they were not, alas, among the few left when I returned in 1946 but
I thought it pointless to make enquiries about the absentees.
Clearly as I remember the nest sites that I took my first Stock Doves
from, all I can recall of where I got the young Stock Doves that I hand-
reared in 1947 was that they came from the land of a farmer friend of
mine. There were three of them (so two nests at least must have been
involved) and a pair was kept and bred the following year. Then, partly
because I felt it would be more interesting and more aesthetically pleasing
to have them at liberty, they were let out. The hen disappeared, whether
of her own volition or due to some mischance, I don't know. The cock
stayed around but after some months began to absent himself for longer
and longer periods. Not having been "trained" when young to roost inside
four walls and under a roof, he had never come home to roost at night.
Soon, from coming twice every day when my domestic pigeons were fed,
he began to come at irregular intervals. Time and again I thought some-
thing had happened to him when several days, and towards the end, weeks,
passed without sight of him. When I last saw him I had not done so for
over a month and was astonished when he suddenly dropped down among
the pigeons I was feeding. He looked in good condition and though ready
enough for the corn he was clearly not very hungry. I never saw him again.
Stock Doves in a London Garden
When In 1958 I bought a small terrace house in south-eastern London
with a very small back garden, I was pleasantly surprised to find that

besides the expected House Sparrows, Starlings and Blackbirds, it was
visited occasionally or regularly, by Great and Blue Tits, Song Thrushes,
Dunnocks, Robins, Wrens, Greenfinches, and, best of all, Wood Pigeons.
(The past five or six years have seen a sad decline in the numbers of most
of these species and the complete disappearance of others but that is
another story). However, though I knew Stock Doves were present (and
probably breeding in some old trees) around larger buildings with more
spacious gardens not far away, I assumed that they fed in nearby parks
or wasteland and never in my wildest dreams expected to see one in my
garden.
One morning, I think it was in 1968,1 was breakfasting with my friend,
Eric Knowles, having just put out food in the garden for the Wood Pigeons,
when he said "There's a Stock Dove in the garden!" "You mean a feral
pigeon". I replied. "No, look yourself!" I did and, to my astonishment, it
was a Stock Dove. I feared this might be a "one-off' phenomenon but
happily it was not. For the next six years Stock Doves were regular visi-
tors. Usually their visits dropped off in the summer when the garden got
a bit cluttered with more vegetation than they liked and, in all probability
there were plentiful supplies elsewhere but from autumn till spring they
came daily. At least I think they did although, of course, during the
short days of winter I saw them only at weekends. Feeding them was a
bit of a problem as there were also Wood Pigeons, one or two of which
were tame and about much of the time. Any food edible to House Spar-
rows was, of course, soon cleared up by those birds if the pigeons did not
come down quickly for it. So, although when I was home, I put out
soaked bread, corn and sometimes peanuts, shortly before I knew the
Stock Doves were likely to arrive, when I was going to be away all day
I scattered the cheapest sorts of dried peas (even then more expensive
than corn or bread, though a lot less expensive than they are now) widely
about the garden, hoping that the Wood Pigeons would not find them
all before the Stock Doves came and secure in the knowledge that the
House Sparrows would not touch them.
The Stock Doves used to come flying from one of two directions, in
both of which there were large parks (Dulwich Park and Brockwell Park)
as well as some open waste ground. The first year usually two or four came
together, the second year eight came all together on one memorable occa-
sion, but except for that occasion I never saw more than six at any one
time. They would come flying over, circle once or twice and then drop
neatly into the garden, very rarely alighting on the fence or on the apple
trees as Wood Pigeons often did. Commonly but not always they would

come when one or more Wood Pigeons were laready feeding. The great
danger was of their being frightened early on. I had found with Wood
pigeons, a bird badly frightened, as it might be if one suddenly burst out
of the back door on top of it, was a bird gone for weeks and perhaps
for good. Feral Pigeons, at least those that scavenge in towns, have of
necessity become inured to disturbance and will return time and again
even if deliberately scared away but wild species, generally speaking, will
not. Once they have become used to getting fed in a particular garden or
other place, however they gain more confidence and will then often
return within an hour or less, if frightened away. As a rough estimate,
with Wood pigeons, one can say that if the accidentally scared bird alights
on a roof or tree within 50 or 60 yards of where it was put up, it is not
too badly upset and will, if it had obtained food before it fled, soon be
back, but if it flies away till it is out of sight, you have probably seen
the last of it.
Anyhow , so far as I know, none of the Stock Doves was frightened off
permanently, in spite of one or two accidental scarings by myself and their
quite often being unable to drop down because of people in nearby
gardens. After some time indeed, a few of the Stock Doves used to perch,
like Wood Pigeons,on nearby houses to wait "till the coast was clear".
But, unlike some (though not all) of "my" Wood Pigeons, none of "my"
Stock Doves became tame. At that time there were two very tame Wood
Pigeons who would come down and feed within a few feet of me but
neither the Stock Doves, nor the several more timid Wood Pigeons that
also came daily, followed their example. Though it is certainly true that
timid birds, both wild and captive, sometimes become tame as a result of
seeing and associating with conspecifics that are already tame, they do not
by any means always do so. Indeed in 50 years of keeping and observing
birds of various species, I have been more impressed by how very often
timid birds become not the least degree tamer through association with
tame conspecifics nor the latter lose any of their tameness through con-
stantly associating with timid individuals.
However, by poking a telephoto lens through my kitchen window, I
did manage to get a few nice (well, nice by my photography standards,
Eric Hosking would probably have wept over them) colour slides of the
Stock Doves in my garden. It was as well I did so, for after two or three
years their numbers declined, till in the winter of 1973 and 1974, only
one male Stock Dove (who once ate 62 peanuts for his breakfast) was
visiting. Since then none have come to my garden and I have seen none in
the neighbourhood.

Nest Sites: some aspects and problems.
Although in some parts of its range the Stock Dove is said to nest only
in holes in trees, in Britain it very commonly nests also in maritime and
inland cliffs and quite often in buildings. So also do the Starling, Jackdaw
and Kestrel, and some of what is said here will or may apply also to them
but my remarks and speculations will have reference only to the Stock
Dove, except in so far as mention is made of other species that may
impinge upon it.
If one visualises two of the most typical types of nesting habitat that
are likely to harbour several or many pairs of Stock Doves, an old (but not
extensive) wood with many hole-bearing trees, and a sea cliff such as one
finds on say the Welsh coast or in some part of southern England, one is
struck with how different they are. Obviously once a nest site-seeking
Stock Dove explores a cliff face or an old beech tree, it will soon notice
the holes (and also dark shadowed patches that, to both bird and man,
look like holes but prove not to be on investigation). But, if the species
originally nested in trees how did it occur to the first Stock Dove to do so,
to fly over the open tree-less land to the cliff edge and then go down and
investigate it? Or conversely, if the species was originally a cliff nester
(which I do not think it was) what prompted the first individual to fly into
the shadowed wood and look for holes in the trees? I have seen no evi-
dence that the Stock Dove feeds on the sea shore, so there would seem to
have been little likelihood of this leading it to discover nesting sites in the
cliffs.
It would be interesting to know to what extent modern Stock Doves
are or are not influenced by the type of site in which they were reared.
Certainly there is now apparently complete social integration between
cliff nesting and tree nesting Stock Doves. In some places, such as the
Isle of Wight, Stock Doves nest in dense (though not extensive) stands of
(partly old) trees in deep sheltered valleys within a mile or less of others
nesting in wind-swept sea cliffs, and all feed on arable land between.
In some places many pairs of both Stock Doves and feral pigeons
breed in the same cliffs. Where I have seen this, in Portland, South Wales
and North Wales, there seems to be some ecological segregation, the
Stock Doves nesting in holes or narrow (often horizontal) fissures in the
cliff face and the feral pigeons on ledges in caves or geos and in nooks and
hollows in or immediately in the vicinity of such caves or other large
openings. The equivalents of both types of sites in buildings are used by
both species, but, so far as I know, one does not find both species nesting
in the same building. It seems likely that one must exclude the other

<bodyText confidence="0.99865035" page_id="56283901"  page_num="161" year="" vol="">
from the type of site it most favours.
Wild Rock Pigeons will (as I have seen on South Uist) sometimes use
both types of cliff sites, and both species use the equivalents of both types
of cliff sites when nesting in buildings. I have once, on the Isle of Wight,
seen both Stock Doves and feral pigeons on a cliff about a third of a mile
back from the sea, were there were only "Stock Dove type" nest sites.
Here, however, the feral pigeons were very few in number, the whole cliff
was swarming with breeding Jackdaws and I did not manage, in the hour
or two I was there, to locate any definite nesting site of a pigeon of either
species. When I have seen Stock Doves nesting on or inside buildings they
have always been the only pigeons present. Hudson, in 1903, noticed to
his surprise that about thirty pairs of Stock Doves (and no feral pigeons)
were breeding on Salisbury Cathedral.
From the above it looks as if, where both species are present, they
may compete for nest sites and since the sites then used by feral pigeons
are those (in caves) which they prefer, it seems likely that they exclude
Stock Doves. I have, however, no evidence as to whether this is so. Most
bird watchers, especially those who go to coastal areas, are little interested
in any pigeons and often ignorant about them. One I met in Wales, whom
I tried to interest in the problem, informed me that I was mistaken as
the two species interbred freely! I hope that any of my readers who live
near a cliff inhabited by both feral (or Rock) Pigeons and Stock Doves
will try to observe how they interact and which species (if either regularly)
wins when they both want the same site. Although the Stock Dove is not
a colonial breeder, many pairs often nest very close to each other if plenty
of suitable holes are "clumped" in a small area. Very many years ago,
Dr. Bruce Campbell showed me "his" famous old barn
(alas, long since demolished) which had a veritable "flock" of Stock
Doves nesting in it, each pair, of course, in a separate hole or niche.
That the Jackdaw competes with the Stock Dove for holes both in
cliffs and in trees seems certain but I have read no published account of
its evicting or failing to evict the latter from any particular site. Dr. A. S.
Richards, who has studied Jackdaws breeding on Skomer Island, off the
Welsh coast, tells me (letter dated 2nd October 1980) that he has often
seen Stock Doves driven away by Jackdaws and sometimes actually driven
out of nesting sites. On Skomer both species nest in rabbit holes in the
cliffs and Dr. Richards believes that the Stock Doves are forced to make
do with holes unwanted by the Jackdaws. I have the same impression,
but without having observed actual disputes, in two woodland areas
where numbers of both species breed. In these all the Stock Dove nests

I have found, when the Jackdaws have been in residence, have been in
holes that were low down and /or in sites well below and shaded by the
canopy. W. H. Hudson, who found numbers of Stock Doves nesting on
Salisbury Cathedral in 1903, was told that there the Jackdaws evicted the
nesting Stock Doves but he observed a Stock Dove repeatedly and success-
fully attacking Jackdaws that approached its nest, on which its mate
was sitting.
If the Stock Dove sometimes attacks Jackdaws with the same berserk
fury that it often shows towards nest competitors of its own species,
then it may sometimes succeed in intimidating them. I am inclined to
think, however, that the Jackdaw wins such contests more often than not.
Any reader interested in the matter who has the luck to live near a
cliff inhabited by Stock Doves and feral pigeons and/or Jackdaws, and
who has a fair amount of spare time, would be able to make interesting
observations and, hopefully, publish them in some future issue of our
magazine.

NOTES ON Lonchura bicolor
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.99816525" page_id="56283904"  page_num="164" year="" vol="">
By F. C. BARNICOAT (Johannesburg, South Africa)
Lonchura bicolor is a delightful, small mannikin that I think is best
regarded as having three geographical races in Africa. The nominate race,
Lonchura bicolor bicolor , hails from West Africa proper in a broad belt
along the southern coast of the bulge of Africa (Guinea to Cameroon).
This is the race which I have bred successfully and with which these notes
are concerned. The upper parts of these birds - head, chest, back and tail -
are entirely black with a marvellous iridescent sheen giving violet or
green tints in the sunlight. The flanks show attractive black and white
scalloping, and three or four tiny, but distinct, white dots occur on each
wing. The underparts are pure white. I always think of them as little
gentlemen wearing black velvet coats. Their rather heavy beaks are a shiny
bluish-grey and are very striking, a fact that has doubtless provided the
name by which they are always known in this country and in most avi-
cultural literature - the Blue-billed Mannikin. However, they are also called
Black-and-white Mannikins or Two-coloured Mannikins, the latter being
the direct translation of their Latin name.
One might say that Lonchura bicolor poensis is the race that comes
from Central Africa, in a belt roughly 5* North and South of the Equator
stretching from the Gulf of Guinea as far to the east as western Uganda,
Kenya and Tanzania. This race differs from the above in having the outer
webs of the flight feathers and the rump barred with white. This race also
occurs on the island of Fernando Po in the Gulf of Guinea, where it was
first discovered. The names Fernando Po Mannikin and Black-breasted
Mannikin are applied to it and Mackworth-Praed and Grant call it Lon-
chura poensis poensis and regarded it as the nominate race. The Latin
name poensis means 'of or belonging to grass' and is very appropriate, as
anyone who has kept this species will readily appreciate, for the passion
of these birds for the seeding heads of wild grasses and ripening millet
sprays is obvious, and a supply of these is the greatest inducement to start
them breeding, perhaps even a prerequisite.
Lonchura bicolor nigriceps or the Red- or Rufous-backed Mannikin
is often given the status of a separate species, unfortunately so, I feel,
because when one keeps this bird beside the Blue-billed Mannikin it is
perfectly clear that the former is the same bird as the latter, merely having
the mantle, wing-coverts and tertiary wing feathers a rich chestnut colour

instead of black. The white and black barred pattern on the flanks, rump
and wings is, however, as well developed as in poensis. This race hails
mainly from East Africa, and its range extends from Kenya southwards
through Tanzania, Malawi, Zimbabwe, and Mozambique to South Africa
where the belt has narrowed to the east coast of Natal. This race is one of
the most popular birds in the aviaries of Natal fanciers, and breeding
successes occur quite frequently, especially in the larger garden-type of
aviary containing some natural vegetation where the birds can feel at home
and perhaps scrounge a few insects. Fanciers from other parts of South
Africa, where the species does not occur locally, seldom manage to get
hold of it.
Map showing distribution of the three species
I am quite sure that the Red-backed Mannikin would interbreed freely
with either race of the Blue-billed Mannikin. I kept them in separate
aviaries, preferring pure-bred birds, but it would be a very interesting
experiment to interbreed with them to see whether the brown back
would prove dominant or recessive.
The Blue-billed Mannikin has been known to aviculture since Dr. Russ's
days in the last century. Dr. A. G. Butler recounts some German successes
in his famous book 'Foreign Finches in Captivity', written in the 1890's.
He himself possessed only one specimen, from the skin of which Frohawk

painted the magnificent plate that appears in the book. It is clear that the
breeding successes with this species were always few and far between and
that the stock died out fairly rapidly. It does not appear to be a long
lived or very hardy species and was obviously far rarer and more diffi-
cult to maintain and breed than any of the other African mannikins - the
Bronze Mannikin, the Magpie Mannikin and even the Dwarf Mannikin or
Bib Finch from Malagasy. It would seem to have disappeared from the
avicultural scene for long periods, but it does appear on the market spora-
dically, and is currently being offered in England. I remember that in the
late 1950s several specimens met with great success on the show bench
in South Africa, so there must have been a small importation at that time.
Then they disappeared.
There was a small importation here in August 1973 and a friend of
mine acquired four birds. These were liberated into a large, naturally
planted aviary. Unfortunately, an unseasonable cold snap struck before
they had really settled in and all of them were lost.
Another importation in 1975, again in mid-winter, gave me the chance
to buy two pairs. I profited by my friend's experience and did not release
them into outdoor aviaries until the summer. I kept them for nearly
four months in a large cage as is used for breeding canaries. I placed a
nest box approximately 20cm square with a half-open front in the cage.
With amazing rapidity all four Blue-billed Mannikins disappeared inside
this box and made themselves cosy in the rough grass nest I had shaped.
They probably roost in nests in the wild state, and the provision of suit-
able boxes to act as sleeping quarters is an important aspect to keeping
these birds in captivity. I find that in aviaries, too, they sleep in a box and
this enables them to keep warm at night and to cope adequately in out-
door aviaries with even the coldest winter weather, although they come
from some of the warmest regions of Africa.
They are simplicity inself to feed and seem to thrive with little more
than small millet seed and water. They are not great greenfood eaters,
but do appreciate spray millet, and, of course, the ripening sprays of
wild grasses or millet grown in the garden are a luxury.
My birds were so happy as a foursome, that I kept them together
when I liberated them in an outdoor aviary when the summer came. This
species is particularly difficult to sex, and so I put a different coloured
plastic ring on each bird in order to be able to identify any two that
started behaving like a pair. Almost immediately I noticed there were two
couples, the partners of which stuck together, although all four roosted
together in a nest box.

I had possessed these birds exactly a year, when in June 1976 I missed
one of the four. On entering the aviary I startled the hen out of the box
in which they roosted and discovered four of the tiniest white eggs I had
ever seen. Thinking that there was absolutely no chance that these would
be properly incubated, 1 transferred them to a Bengalese nest. Three of
these eggs proved fertile and duly hatched. Although the babies got
through the initial stages quite well, it was as though the food they were
being given was not agreeing with them and they died off one by one,
the last having already reached the feathering stage. This experience
prompted me to separate the two pairs and resolve to let them attempt
to rear their own offspring should they nest again.
The splitting up of the two pairs seemed to throw them off breeding,
and although they remained extremely healthy, neither pair showed the
slightest inclination to breed until the following March, when one pair
constructed a beautifully woven globular nest in a Budgerigar breeding
box, using the inflorescences of the wild grass Panicum laevifolium, which
I grow every year in the late summer in my garden for feeding to the birds.
My plan to let the parents rear the babies themselves progressed well.
All four eggs were duly hatched out and the parents were feeding very
well indeed when tragedy struck. The mother died in the box. As the
father did not continue to feed, there was no option but to put these
babies under Bengalese. They progressed favourably at first, but their
growth rate seemed to slow down and all of them were lost shortly after
they left the nest. Despite my double failure with Bengalese housed in
aviaries, I think that better results could be obtained from Bengalese in
small cages, where their whole effort would be concentrated on looking
after their strange babies.
My second pair of Blue-billed Mannikins made no attempt to breed,
although one was slightly smaller and had a rather narrower beak when
viewed from the top " one of the best guides to the sexing of any mannikin
species. Breeding this species now seemed a remote possibility but when a
friend was left with an odd specimen, which he offered to me, I felt
that I might as well put it with my odd male. From its smaller size and
somewhat less showy white area I judged it to be a hen. In due course
this pair produced seven offspring.
They were housed in an aviary only two metres square, half of which is
taken up by a fibre glass shelter. Only half the roof is covered with as-
bestos, which means that the shelter is light and two varieties of cypress
trees grow successfully in it. This style of aviary has proved quite success-
ful for breeding. The Blue-billed Mannikins shared this accomodation with

pairs of Violet-eared Waxbills, Gouldian Finches and European Siskins, all
getting on with each other fairly well. In September 1977 they built a
nest of dry grass in a bunch of bracken fixed up in the shelter. The nest
was over two metres above the ground and near the roof of the aviary. It
was not very well woven and had a wide entrance, so that it was easy to
see the contents. The two birds always slept in this nest as they had for-
merly done in a nest box. In this nest they attempted to raise a family on
three occasions in rapid succession, only fully succeeding the third time.
I did not feed live food of any kind to them, and had I done so they might
have reared their first two broods as well. Each clutch consisted of four
tiny white eggs. The first two babies made good progress until they began
to feather. Then I found them draped over the perch in the flight, an indi-
cation that the parents were not fully satisfied with the food provided.
The second brood of three reached the stage of being quite well feathered
when the parents seemed to loose interest gradually and allowed the babies
to die off one by one. In January 1978, however, they raised three babies
to maturity, and in April repeated the success with another four babies.
It could be that in the later months of summer more small insects were to
be found in the natural vegetation growing in this small aviary, or the extra
grasses I was able to supply made the difference, or the pair could just
have adapted slowly to the aviary conditions.
When the babies leave the nest they are a dull black on the head and
back and grey on the underparts. It was difficult to keep an accurate check
on incubation, but it is under two weeks, probably 12 or 13 days. The
babies developed fast and tended to be easily flushed from their nest
before they could fly properly. One baby jumped from the nest at about
14 days old. However, I found the parents adept at getting their babies
back into the nest even when this feat seemed a remote possibility. Having
left the nest the babies are quick to learn to eat seed and I found that
the first brood could be removed from their parents after two weeks. The
babies bred in January had assumed adult plumage by the end of April
however as with most other birds this may take longer in the case of those
bred just before winter sets in.
After rearing their first brood, my pair took a short break, then con-
structed an entirely new nest in another bunch of bracken, but it was
similar in style and position. The four babies reared here left the nest a
little later and were better developed, probably because the entrance of
the nest faced the fibre glass wall and it was not possible to disturb them.
I would say that this attractive bird is ideal for aviary life. They are not
normally aggressive, although once the non-breeding pair plucked some

young Gouldians that had just left the nest and were unable to defend
themselves. The bigger one's aviary the less likelihood is there of this sort
of trouble. They are adaptable to aviary life and reproduce quite readily.
In addition they are particularly successful on the show bench, being
steady and exceptionally smooth in plumage as well as of striking appear-
ance. They often figure among the major awards in show reports. The
same can be said of the Red-backed Mannikin, though the pair I had were
always very wild in a cage and never tamed down. However I do not know
whether the two races differ in their propensity to tame down in capti-
vity, as the specimens of each which I kept might have been caught at
different ages, which often makes a great difference.
Subsequently both pairs nested during the winter and the hens peri-
shed; also one of the cocks. I have now had the survivor over five years,
indicating that these birds can endure well in captivity but might best be
brought indoors in cages for the winter, where they would be unlikely to
attempt breeding.
The old male was re-mated and produced a further brood in February
1979. Then one morning I noticed him chasing his hen. Assuming he was
driving her to nest again, I took no action, and was taken aback an hour
later to find the little hen dead with her eyes picked out. Violence of this
kind, especially towards an established mate, is very unusual among
estrildine birds, though common enough with softbills.
I conclude that it is wise to house this species in as large an aviary
as possible with plenty of natural cover, where they would probably
do well in a flock, which seems to be the best arrangement for most
Lonchura species, which seem to need the stimulation of other pairs
of the same kind for optimum breeding results. It is mainly under such
conditions that other South Africans have recently been quite successful
in establishing a stock of'Blue-billed Mannikins', especially in Natal where
there is not a cold winter to contend with. This species undoubtedly has
potential for establishing viable aviary-bred stocks.

A FEW DAYS IN ADELAIDE
By G.A. SMITH (Peterborough)
I had the considerable honour to be invited, by the Avicultural Society
of South Australia, to address the first National Avicultural Convention
held at Flinders' University, Adelaide. I arrived early in the morning of
16th May, the opening day of the convention, and flew out of Adelaide,
for my journey home, mid-morning on 21st May. My impressions of
Australia and of Australian aviculture must, inevitably, be slight: yet,
with the tolerance of the editor, I would like to record something of my
first visit to the Antipodes.
The theme of the convention was "Aviculture: a tool of conservation"
and the damage done to the earth's surface by mankind was foremost
in my mind as I looked down, from the 'plane, at a height of six miles
or so. Europe appeared congested with houses and highways with seldom
a patch of natural vegetation. The mountainous deserts of Iran will remain
untouched unless the improbability occurs of a change in climate. As we
flew south along the western coast of Pakistan and India the land, except
for salt-marsh, steep sides to hills and, obvious arid desert, was scraped
clear of trees and divided, as was Europe, into the interlocking, angular
squares and shapes of fields: which were, before the monsoon, devoid of
any green. So that this edge of the subcontinent looked like the hide of an
itchy, sunblistered, parched, mangy water-buffalo. The land seemed so
sore and raw that it must have been completely inhospitable for many
species of plant and animal that previously lived here. Therefore it was
pleasant to see, as we crossed the southern end of Sri-Lanka (Ceylon),
green wooded hills and valleys with clearings largely confined to the
edges of watercourses.
One of the nicest surprises about the parts of Australia I saw from the
air was that European man had not had such a large effect upon the
vegetation as I had feared. For though large amounts of woodland
are clear-felled or killed by ring barking around Perth, Melbourne and
Adelaide - the cities I flew over - the impression was that much virgin
land remained and that unnecessary damage might be halted. And I think
it will, for I never met a people so conservation-conscious as the Austra-
lians. The other pleasant finding was how run-off water is collected:
reservoirs, lakes and man-made ponds appeared abundant compared with

Western Pakistan and India.
The first bird that I saw, on the dawn of my arrival at Melbourne air-
port was a hen Sparrow Passer domesticus that chirped from a huge, red-
flowered camellia. I heard the next, a Goldfinch Carduelis carduelis , sing-
ing in a twitter of loud sexual excitement from an ornamental, flowering,
smooth-barked Eucalyptus. Having left the Goldfinch at home, in England,
beginning to breed it must be that the nesting season is more prolonged.
My next species was a flock of twenty-two Roseate Cockatoos (Galahs)
Cacatua roseicapillus almost languidly mobbing an unrecognisable falcon.
Parrots, I soon found, were extremely common. Whilst in Adelaide pairs of
Psephotus haematonotus were seen daily; likewise Musk Glossopsitta
concinna and little lorikeets, G. pusilla. As with the Roseates and the
Redrumps attention was drawn to all the parrots as they flew because of
their calls. With the lorikeets the flight was so fast and direct that unless
one glanced up immediately on hearing them they were lost to sight. At
the University campus there were large numbers of Adelaide Rosellas
Platycercus elegans adelaidae. I was particularly interested to see if they
showed much variation in colour. Forshaw (1978) gave his opinion that
the Adelaide (which has an orangey hue) is a hybrid population between
the Pennant P.e. elegans (which is red) and the Yellow Rosella P. e. flav-
eolus. If the Adelaide Rosella were a hybrid then, logically, the popu-
lation would be mostly composed of 'typical' Adelaides, some Pennant-
like. some Yellow Rosella-like and various intermediaries between all
three: depending upon the number, the dominance, of the alleles respons-
ible for producing the yellow and red coloration and the selective press-
ures maintaining the 'Adelaide' colour. At its simplest level, for example,
if the Adelaide was produced because it had a 'red allele', from the Pen
nant, and a 'yellow one', from the Yellow Rosella then, on average, for
every two Adelaides produced by a breeding pair of Adelaides there would
also be one Pennant and one Yellow Rosella. In fact the plumage, of the
birds that I saw, may well have differed slightly between individuals. But
this difference was not noticeable to me in the field - except that young-
sters were green. However as I know (both from my conversation with
field workers on wild Rosellas, and from aviculturists who have selected
for brighter-coloured birds) all rosella populations ( Platycercus species)
display quite considerable variation in colouring. Consequently, I think
that Forshaw was mistaken in thinking of the Adelaide as being of hybrid
origin.
Quite the most evocative of Australian birds, because of its musical
piping at dawn and evening, was the White-backed Magpie Gymnorhina

hypoleuca. They teased because they were never close enough for me to
'snap' them when I had my camera; but when I left it behind they came as
close as a metre. Mudlarks Grallina cyanoleuca often joined the magpies
in perching on road-side lamps. Another black and white bird, the Willie
Wagtail Rhipidura leucophrys, was also very common and tame. They were
aggressive and appeared singly. Black on the top and white underneath
they had none of the appearance of shape or 'jiz' of the wagtails Motacilla
of Europe. For example the long and heavy black tail was swung laterally
in a fanned manner, which reminded me of the flared skirt of a flamenco
dancer, and not with the vertical elasticated-bounce of the Motacilla.
After the three day conference I was taken to see several avicultural
collections. The first lay to the south of Adelaide. The straight, and not
very busy, highway had its surface just as sploshed and spattered as it
would have been if it ran under a heronry. However, it was not faeces that
fouled the macadam but the flattened corpses of mice; for we were in a
mouse-plague-year. And, with only a few, scarce, breaks this heavy dotting
of the road with mummified mice and, infrequently, a cat, continued
unbroken to our destination thirty miles south-east. Several thin flocks of
Little Raven Corvus mellori and single Nankeen Kestrel Falco cenchroides
were seen. The effect these predators would have had on the mouse
problem, which not to exaggerate must have been of millions, must have
been as negligible as would that of a child filling a bucket with brine from
the contents of the ocean. A single flock of the very common Silver Gull
Lams novaehollandiae seemed to prefer scraps thrown from parked cars
to mice: for they were outside the same petrol-selling restaurant when we
came back hours later. My curiosity as to the species of mouse (the House
Mouse Mus musculus) was easily satisfied for, on arriving at our desti-
nation, in an empty barn with no door, whole populations of mice unable
to find their way out again, lay dead. While the living scurried close to the
walls and formed pyramids a foot high in each corner. A smell of decaying
meat that hung about the farm reminded me of an old-fashioned tanner's
yard. At the farm I was shown native waterfowl, most native species of
parrot, and several pigeons, and, amongst the exotics, Nanday and Jenday
Conures Aratinga nenday and A. jandaya, Quaker Conures Myiopsitta
monachus, Indian Ringnecks, Alexandrines and Plumheads Psittacula
krameri P. eupatria and P. cyanocephala. The pride of the collection
was the mutation colours of the Peach faced Lovebird Agapomis rosei-
collis. I saw lutinos, a black-eyed yellow - this was a particularly attractive
mutation. In no way comparable to the mucky-yellow parYellows or
'Golden-Cherry' lovebirds of Europe and North America. I also saw a

mutation of Cockatiel a pink-eyed bird with the faintest of faint grey
plumage. This latter may or may not be a fresh mutation for it might have
been created by cross-linkage: cinnamon and lutino being on the same
sex-chromosome.
Altogether I was shown around three of the largest collections in South
Australia. The establishments were all private and appeared larger than
those of Europe. One was a commercial enterprise dealing exclusively
in parrots. Perhaps, therefore, there are more bird-breeders in Australia
than in Europe. If so this is consequent upon the better climate and the
lower density housing which, until recently in Adelaide, was four houses
to an acre. Indeed someone complained that now it occasionally gets
as high as eight houses to an acre! The standard aviary design was frames
of welded steel pipe covered by galvanised wire and sheltered, at one end,
against the sun and, minimally, against cold and wind, by galvanised flat or
corrugated sheet steel. Aviaries tended to be large which meant that for
Princess of Wales', Rock Pebblers and Barrabands Polytelis alexandrae,
P. anthopeplus and P. swainsonii, several pairs could be kept together
with consequent, for they are apparently colonial birds when nesting,
excellent breeding results. Feeding was on the side of generosity. Seed is
about a third to a quarter of the price in the U.K.
My particular interest was in the cockatoos and I saw all the Australian
species except for the Palm Probosciger aterrimus and the Glossy Black
Calyptorhynchus lathami There is a trend in Australian ornithology to
subdivide species of birds into fresh species. This is particularly so for the
cockatoos. There are said to be two species of White-tailed Black Cocka-
toos C. funereus in Western Australia (Saunders 1977). They live in com-
pletely adjacent woodland of different species of Eucalyptus and differ in
voice and the width of the bill. Except by very close examination no one
could tell them apart. It was my fortune to see two pairs of White tails, in
the same collection, made up of a male from the wide-mandible 'race' and
a hen from the narrow-mandible one. As yet no-one has bred the White-
tailed Black. When they do it will be most instructive to see whether, when
the races are crossed, the chicks turn out to be intermediate in bill width
or, as I believe, will take after one parent or the other. The Yellow-tailed
has been bred, for I saw chicks in two collections. Likewise with the
Red-tailed Black C magnificus : both unrecorded in print. The difference
between the nominate race of Red-tailed and the south-western isolate C.
m. naso was striking. For naso was smaller and duller and kept up a
continual din - which I am told is a characteristic of its behaviour, while
the bigger bird was silent. For those who blindly accept that hand-reared

cockatoos do not breed, every one of the several chicks that I saw from
black cockatoos came from hand-reared parents.
Only one person, from the very many parrot-breeders that I conversed
with, bothered to keep Roseate Cockatoos. And he had three mutations
to work with; red-eyed white (inos) in which the grey was entirely su-
pressed leaving the pink. Black-eyed white - which, except for the eye,
looked much the 'ino' other than for slight evidence of greying on the
wings: and cinnamon in which the grey is transmuted to pale brown.
Talking of mutations, I saw a lutino Adelaide, picked up as a sun-blinded
youngster straight from the nest, which was to be used for breeding. This
lutino was a particularly beautiful bird and the mutation, being sex-
linked (?) should readily become established in aviaries. Gang-gang Cock-
atoos Callocephalon fimbriatum were plentiful in these collections. Un-
fortunately a high percentage were subject to a self-mutilation of their
feathers. A veterinarian, Dr. David Schultz, expressed his opinion that
this often proved to start after a stress, for example separating the pairs;
or removing the chicks; or capture and dispatch to another collector.
As Gang-gangs are said to be highly arboreal, perhaps one stress is that
aviaries are (from the birds point of view) too near the ground. Whatever
a Gang-gang in perfect feather is a remarkably beautiful cockatoo and the
cork-being-eased-from-the-neck-of-a-bottle contact call is, even to a tee-
totaller, such as myself, a particularly lovely sound to hear.
Leadbeater's (Major Mitchell's) Cockatoos Cacatua leadbeateri were in
all collections. The westernmost form has a much deeper shade of pink
to the body and an absence, or a token, of a stripe of yellow to the crest.
I do not think they are represented in European aviaries. As Leadbeater's
are a current passion of mine - we now have nine (seven 'own-bred'). I
was intrigued to hear that some Australian pairs will raise four youngsters
to a nest. General opinion was that they were not 'adult', i.e. sexually
mature, until they were four years old: yet I was told of birds that had laid
at a year and pairs that had successfully raised chicks when two. If my
own birds are typical they attempt to tread, and have certainly begun to
establish sexual pairs, by a year and investigate nest boxes and copulate,
seemingly quite successfully, when two. One of the highlights of my trip
was seeing a Leadbeater's X Roseate Cockatoo. There are those who (e.g.
Forshaw 1978), after evidence supplied by Holyoak (1970), put these
cockatoos into separate genera: the Roseate then becoming Eolophus .
However this lovely hybrid consolidates my own belief that this is hair-
splitting: for the chick, from the two, resembled a 'white' cockatoo in
all respects. It was smaller than a Leadbeater's and had a white, pinched

The breast was pinky. Unfortunately the aviary in which it was housed

ance. The oddity was that he insisted that all the chicks were female.
This, if true, has a huge interest, for male hybrids are more viable than
female. But I believe he was mistaken. The iris of male Roseates Is often of
a brown colour and I think that either the chicks had the same iris colour
(the one we saw was brown) or the difference between the pinkish-brown
of the hens and the brown of the males was not discernible.
Except for the Orange-bellied Neophema chrysogaster, I saw all the
grass parakeets. I was told a sad tale about the Orange-bellied which was
that someone was breeding it most successfully and the Wildlife services
took the birds from him and released them, as they were perfectly entitled
to do, back into the wild. If the release was not successful, and we have no
information that it was, then this act must come under the heading of mis-
conservation. Likewise I saw all the Psephotus parakeets, except for the
Paradise P. pulcherrimus (which, incidentally I am informed is being kept
and bred). The Golden-shouldered P. c. chrysopterygius and the Hooded
P. c. dissimilis were plentiful enough to appear, even if my impression was
mistaken, quite commonplace. The blue-bonnets are usually included in
the same genus; but here I am the 'splitter' and would have them in
Northiella. The Naretha Blue-bonnet K narethae again appeared to be in
every collection. Selective breeding had 'improved' the Brown's or North-
ern Rosella Platycercus venustus so that they had completely black caps to
the head and the contrast between the black and yellow of the back was
maximised. Invariably the condition of the birds was excellent and if this
visit did one thing, it was to emphasize over and over again to me that
what parrots in Europe lack is dry warmth.

IMPORTANT NEWS CONCERNING ROCK PIGEONS
By PROFESSOR CARL NAETHER (Encino, California)

It is generally assumed by scientists and other researchers on the
strength of intensive as well as extensive study and observation, both in
nature and In captivity that the Rock Pigeon Columba livia is the fore-
runner to our modern, domestic pigeon. This very popular hobby bird is
currently being bred in most parts of the world in well over 450 kinds.
They differ slightly or markedly in the matter of shape or form, plumage
colour, or mode of flight from the Rock Pigeon. If one visits a so-called
national pigeon show, one is surprised, if indeed not agreeably "shocked"
by the seemingly endless varieties of birds on parade. In fact there is no
practical limit to the number of future breeds, which are likely to be
produced by the simple means of crossing existing breeds. The inventive
faculty of the fancier seems ever to bring forth something "new", even if
the breed's newness be little more than a different shade of plumage
colour or a different body shape or form. As we all know, but at times
do not fully realise, so called new breeds are simply more or less attractive
and improved mixture of several old ones, and they are labelled "new" to
gain followers. This is not necessarily meant to downgrade modern vari-
eties which in many instances testify beautifully and appealingly to the
ingenuity, initiative and perseverance applied to their "creation".
One should not forget, however, how flimsy and how transient the
visible physical characteristics of new breeds in most cases are, how easily
they can be erased and completely removed by effective crossbreeding.
Good examples of such backward "development" can be found in large
numbers among the so called street and park pigeons, for usually their
flocks sport fascinating types of degenerated, "former" fancy pigeons
in astounding varieties. Now called "culls", these pigeons have gone,
not to the dogs, as the old saying has it, but to the streets! Incidentally,
a favourite pastime of not a few pigeon fanciers, both young and old,
is to crossbreed not necessarily with forethought and careful planning
for the future, but "just to see what colour or shape the crosses will be
like"! In the course of his long-time hobby keeping both domesticated
wild pigeons and doves, this writer has received innumerable requests
for information regarding the crossing of all kinds of pigeons and doves.
Which would suggest that certain pigeon keepers enjoy expressing their
feelings of curiosity in this fashion, hoping that by pure chance they
will produce something worthwhile.

But now let us get back to the Rock Pigeon. A recent series of infor-
mative articles on this subject appearing in the "Gerflugel-Borse", a well-
known West-German hobby magazine, calls specific and authentic atten-
tion to the geographical distribution of the Rock Pigeon over the world,
with special emphasis on the numerous subspecies and their distinguishing
characteristics. So far as is known today, 14 subspecies of Columha livia
have been found and certified by various authorities. There may, of
course, be further subspecies extant in countries where they are simply
inaccessible to observers for good reasons. The fourteen subspecies differ
mainly in size and plumage colour, these differences being often very small
and not readily recognisable. Their sizes are determined not only by inheri-
tance, but by available food supplies. Thus Rock Pigeons living in desert
and waste regions, where thay have to subsist on an often very limited diet
of grass and other desert plant seeds, berries, and occasional insects, tend
to be smaller in size than species inhabiting grain-producing regions. The
ready availability of suitable grains during the breeding season also affects
the number of broods raised, which may vary from two to three, or even
four under especially favourable conditions. Plumage colour likewise
varies within the fourteen subspecies. Usually, it tends to be somewhat
lighter, showing more white on the back or more grey, on species living in
desert or tropical regions, where frequent sunshine prevails during the
greater part of the season. In coastal and other regions, less favoured by
sunlight, sub-species tend toward a darker plumage, the white or grey
backs being replaced by dark-grey or almost grey-black, blue or even blue-
black colours. In considering differences in plumage colour, one must not
forget that in given habitats Rock Pigeons have crossed with certain native
species more or less freely, thus definitely affecting plumage coloration.
Another quite notable difference between the fourteen subspecies
concerns wing-length, which may differ from 184 mm to as much as
247 mm. Thus the smallest Rock Pigeon Columba livia schimperi , named
after the German naturalist Schimper, which is at home in the Nile Region
and East Egypt, has a winglength of only 184 - 211 mm. Columbia livia
livia which Eves in the British Isles, Scotland and Ireland, on the other
hand, boasts a wing-length of 220 - 240 mm. This largely blue-barred bird
with a white back has a glossy neck and breast.
The Rock Pigeon with the lightest coloured plumage is Columba
livia daklae. Its upper parts and wings are light grey contrasting strongly
with a white back. The well-known British scientist Meinertzhagen was the
first to describe this pigeon in 1928, having located it in Egypt. As the
"originator" of all subspecies functions Columba livia intermedia, so

regarded by the British ornithologist Strickland as early as 1844. It is one
of the darkest-coloured rock pigeons; even its back is a dark blue.
In countries where more or less primitive agriculture prevails Rock
Pigeons seem to thrive as before, while in others where modern methods,
such as immunizing seeds against disease, crop-dusting etc., are used,
their numbers seem to shrink.

It has been reported that on the west coast of South Africa, where the
Jackass Penguin Spheniscus demersus is endemic, the population has
halved in size during the last 20 years. It has been estimated that since
the beginning of this century, there has been something like a ninety-
percent decline. The main reason for this was egg harvesting, which was
outlawed in 1969. Now, oil pollution and harbour developments near the
breeding colonies are causing further falls in numbers. However, the main
threat appears to be from competition for food with the fishing industry,
which has seriously depleted stocks of fish, such as pilchard, on which the
penguins feed.

The White-winged Guan Penelope albipennis, long thought to be
extinct, has been found living in pockets of evergreen trees growing near
streams in the Andean foothills of Peru. John O'Neill, an American zoolo-
gist, estimates that several hundred of these birds survive. The only threat
to them at present is the clearance of trees to create agricultural land. The
Peruvian government is said to have given full protection to the White-
winged Guan.

By the time this note is read, the 1980 results of Cornell University's
captive breeding project with the Peregrine Falcon will have been pub-
lished in the Peregrine Fund Newsletter. However, as little has been
recorded in this column in the past on this important project, perhaps it
will be of interest to look back on the results achieved last year and pub-
lished in the Fall (autumn) 1979 Newsletter: "This year, for the first
time, we broke the 100 mark in the number of young peregrines raised
in our combined programs at Fort Collins and Cornell - 110 young came
from eggs laid in captivity and 19 from wild eggs hatched in incubators . . .
Thus, at Cornell 21 females laid a total of 117 eggs, 107 were actually
fertile, 71 of them hatched (66%), and 57 hatchlings survived to achieve
full development. The comparable figures for Fort Collins are: 24 egg-
laying females, a total of 139 eggs laid, 75 fertile, 58 hatched (77%) and
53 raised".
Artificial insemination was used on 14 of the Cornell females and 16
of those at Fort Collins. This method of fertilisation is believed to have
a success rate of 87% at Cornell and 88% at Fort Collins.

The Cornell University Laboratory of Ornithology Newsletter no. 95
contains brief summaries on four research projects, two of which involve
the study of crane migration using radio transmitters attached to the birds'
leg or back to enable close monitoring of the birds' movements. In one
study, transmitters were attached to twelve nestling Sandhill Cranes on
their breeding grounds north of Winnipeg, Manitoba and details recorded
of their migration southwards to Dakota. One bird was tracked as far as
Texas.
The same procedure was adopted on five juvenile Whooping Cranes for
their winter migration from Gray's Lake Refuge, Idaho to Bosque de
Apache National Wildlife Refuge in Southern New Mexico. Tracking was
undertaken by light aircraft and recorded the group soaring at altitudes of
over twenty thousand feet when crossing the Rockies. The report also
gives some encouragement on the status of this majestic crane which num-
bered only 21 in 1941. Estimates, at the start of the 1979 winter migra-
tion put the number at about 90 with another 25 held in a captive flock at
Patuxtent.
Other subjects in the Newsletter cover research on Great Blue Heron
populations in New York State and predation on Goldenrod Fly larvae by
Downy Woodpeckers.

Fairy wrens of the genus Malurus are not frequently seen in collec-
tions outside their native Australia but aviculturists within Australia
have, over the years, succeeded in breeding at least nine of the thirteen
species occurring in their country; one other inhabits New Guinea but has
never been kept to the best of my knowledge. References in the Avi-
cultural Magazine, usually quoting from Australian literature give the
following species as being reared: Purple-backed Wren M. assimilis, Tur-
qoise Wren M. callainus , Superb Blue Wren M cyaneus, Red-winged Wren
M. elegans , Variegated Wren M. lamberti, White-winged Wren M. leucop-
terus , Red-backed Wren M. melanocephalus , Black-backed Wren M. mel-
anotus and Splendid Wren M. splendens.
Outside Australia the Superb Blue is the only species to have reared,
and then only infrequently. In Britain, the first breeding took place as
early as 1902 in the aviaries of Reginald Phillips; a most remarkable
achievement considering the only way of transporting such gems in those
days was by a long and hazardous sea journey. It wasn't until 1978 that
they reared again, this time here at Padstow Bird Gardens where three
young were reared by two pairs of captive bred birds. These were the
progeny of a prolific pair which produced a total of twenty young in one
year at Frankfurt Zoo. The Marshal Boehm Aviaries in America also had
some success in the early sixties.

In a pleasing sequel to his article on hand-rearing the Greater Spotted
Woodpecker (Avicultural Magazine, 1979, 121-124), Bill Herring relates
that two of them have nested in the release area. The nest was discovered
when the young were fairly well advanced but both parents responded to
calls made to them at the time by answering and approaching quite clos-
ely. The number of young remained unknown as no sign was seen of them
once fledged.

common bird in the district and occasionally a pair, along with young
are to be seen feeding on our centre lawn. However, this year the numbers
seem to have doubled and for the first time we have had one brought into
the gardens, but like most birds received, was injured. Unfortunately, the
wound was an old one and the bird has to be destroyed because of its
gangrenous condition.
I had not previously seen either the Lesser or Greater Spotted in the
area but early in the new year, a pair of the latter put in an appearance,
spending most of their time divided between a row of large pines near the
gardens and tall woodland bordering the town. As the year progressed
they favoured the pines less and were frequently observed in the wood-
land. No conclusive evidence of nesting, such as nest site or young were
found but both birds were seen to carry away pieces of fruit from the
bird table of a house just across the road from the gardens. The fruit
concerned, was the waste of our previous days feeding which is always
"taken across the road" for the wild birds and while the Roberts have
had a variety of birds visit their bird table, I think it was a very pleased
smile which accompanied the questioning "Guess what we had visit the
bird table". They continued to visit for another two weeks, taking away
pieces of fruit as they departed.
The Lesser Spotted also put in an appearance, being observed on
several occasions and a dead male, an obvious road casualty was found in
June.

The second generation White-cheeked Turacos reported in the July
newsletter as about to fledge at the gardens have done so, and have been
followed by a third. Our original pair, after three abortive attempts earlier
in the year, hatched and subsequently reared two of their own. The White-
cheeks are one of the first species to begin nesting, and one of the last to
finish. Since their first productive nesting in 1975, the original pair, prior
to 1980, had reared seven young. The first two bred are the pair which
have just reared their first. This is after three years of trying in which
eggs had only produced one young: alas, this only survived for a week or
so. This year when young hatched, both pairs were offered bread in a
Complan and Farlene mixture to which had been added Ribena (a con-
centrated fruit cordial), powdered cuttle-fish and Vionate vitamin powder.

The colony of Night Heron Nycticorax nycticorax at liberty in
Edingburgh Zoo for nearly thirty years was the subject of some study by
several members of the Scottish Ornithologists Club in 1979, particularly
by local recorder for the Club, Bob Smith. He writes "Stan da Prato
counted the colony on 4th January and got 13 birds. On 31st December
he counted 13 adults and 4 immatures.
My wife and I visited the zoo on 21st April, 26th May and a brief
visit mid-June. We found it very difficult to know what was happening in
relation to nesting. There were four sites with platforms (including two
substantial structures on 26th May; on one of which a bird was sitting
tight while the second appeared empty, although an adult arrived later.)
The other two platforms were fairly flimsy. I feel sure one of the nests
had eggs/young on 26th May - it was 40 feet up a deciduous tree but no
signs of adults were present in June. No indication of eggshells or young
were found in June anywhere and most of the visible platforms (low down
in small pines) seemed untenanted.
From our two visits it is impossible to be sure whether the small
platforms we saw with attendant pairs, were being used for egg-laying

although it is quite possible they were. However, it appears that in 1979
there were about four pairs with platforms of which at least one, pro-
bably two pairs tried to breed. As four young were observed in winter,
obviously one or two pairs were successful. The zoo has a high population
of Carrion Crows and Magpies (and Grey Squirrels) so egg predation may
be a problem. I understood the zoo caught three adults in early 1979
for transportation to another zoo.
As local recorder I should get reports on Night Herons outside the
zoo but very few are received. It may be that some people see them and
think they aren't worth reporting - as feral birds. But I really think that
few are actually seen, possibly because they are a dusk flying and night
feeding species. I have bird-watched at Gladhouse Reservoir since the war
and have one autumn record of a juvenile many years ago (15 miles
S.S.E.). I have heard of the occasional juvenile in Fife many years ago so
possibly there is some movement occasionally. However the birds are fed
at the zoo and probably spend most of their time there. Occasionally one
is reported at one feeding area for a short spell - one frequented the water
of Leith several years ago and could be seen from the main road. About
three years ago an adult was reported near Lasswade (8 miles from the
zoo), which flew in at dusk for several evenings. On 27th October 1979
an immature flew over Seafield (6 miles East of the zoo) in the early
morning looking for the zoo".
In summing up his letter, Mr. Smith adds "I now feel that the colony
is probably static, maintains the occasional loss of numbers, and that
they tend to wander little, if at all, from the immediate area of the zoo".

In a recent report, the Royal Society for the Protection of Birds said
that the Red Kite, one of the rarest and most spectacular birds of Britain,
has had its most successful breeding season this century.
A record total of 27 young were reared by 21 pairs of kites in their
central Wales haunt. This was undoubtedly aided by the warm Spring
weather. Seven other pairs built nests and laid eggs, but these either failed
to hatch or were taken by predators.
This brings the total population of Red Kites in Britain to about 125,
the highest recorded. Until the 18th Century, Red Kites were common in
Britain, but numbers dropped to about a dozen at the beginning of the
century.

In keeping with the trend towards specialisation common among many
of the progressive wild-life parks, Reg Smith, director of Weyhill, is grad-
ually swinging the emphasis to birds of prey. Quite a representative stock
of raptors was already included in the collection of European fauna and
several of the species have been bred successfully. Now, under the new
name of the Hawk Conservancy, a number of interesting new species
have been added, including: White-backed Vulture Gyps bengalensis,
Cinerous Vulture Aegypius monachus, White-tailed Sea Eagle Haliaeetus
albiciila , Ferruginous Buzzard Buteo regalis , Woodford's Owl Ciccaba
woodfordii and Boobook Owl Ninox novaeseelandiae.

By Dr. HENRY QUINQUE (Mesnil Aubry, Paris)
Ever since our eminent President, Dr. Jean Delacour, was kind enough
to devote an article in the Avicultural Magazine of July--August 1973
to my bird collection, I have promised myself that I would publish some
of my breeding results, but time goes by and my professional duties have
always intervened.
However today, the reproduction of Eunymphicus c. cornu tus seems
to me to be of such importance that I should report it to our Society and
would pay respectful homage to Dr. Jean Delacour, in token of the sincere
friendship which unites us and of the deep admiration which I have for
him.

The Horned Parrot is so rarely seen in captivity that a description is
necessary and none is better than that given by Dr. Jean Delacour in his
excellent Guide des oiseaux de Nouvelle Caledonie et de ses Dependances
(1966):
"The Horned Parrot - size 35 cms. Beak strong; tail long and broad,
green, lighter and more yellow on the underside; flight and lateral tail-
feathers blue and black, the middle feathers tinted with blue at the tips;
the front and middle of the crown red; crest formed of two long and
straight black feathers which are red at the tip; cheeks and throat black;

Dr. H. QUINQUE - BREEDING THE HORNED PARROT
This superb and unusual species is strictly protected."
History
This bird, whose beauty and charm is unequalled, has always been
difficult to keep alive in collections and yet there was a miracle in Europe
in 1885, as we shall see later.
Skilled aviculturists such as the Marquis of Tavistock, who reared
many rare parrots, never succeeded in keeping it alive in spite of a heating
system which was the best of the day.
The Hon. Canon Dutton, another great parrot specialist, wrote in
the Avicultural Magazine (vol. 6, 1900, page 244): "The species that
beats me is Nymphicus. To look at their bills, you would say they were
seedeaters, but I bought a lot of eight once which looked healthy enough.
They all died, one after the other, of digestive troubles, and I have had
other specimens which I have kept for twelve months or so, but then they
have died. They have never been kept very long in the Zoological Gardens.
I cannot but think they would live longer, if we knew how to feed them
correctly". (Note: at that time Nymphicus was the generic name of the
Horned Uvean Parakeets. It is now the generic name of the Cockatiel
N. hollandicus. Ed.)
These lines written by a man of such great experience, who in addi-
tion was not restricted by any shortage of money, are hardly encouraging.
Moreover, since the beginning of this century, this wonderful bird
has become rarer and even more difficult to obtain. Since Dr. Delacour's
publication the number of Eunymphicus has been greatly reduced by the
increasing destruction of the forests due to the working of the nickel
mines.
I made the acquaintance of the Horned Parrot many years ago in
the book by Dr. A. Reichenow Vogelbilder aus Fernen Zonen. Plate 23
depicts it in very true colours; perhaps it is better drawn than the others.
Anyway, I fell in love with it - a love without hope for more than 20 years.
Then I discovered that this bird which the great aviculturist of the
twentieth century had not succeeded in keeping alive for more than a
few months, had been well kept and bred during the last quarter of the
nineteenth century.
This is a resume of the story, told by the Marquis of Brisay in his rare
and charming work entitled In our Aviaries (Vichy, France, 1899).
"Very rare and little known, the Horned Parrot has been imported
alive in London for the first time by Mr. Abraham, it adorns the collection
of M. Comely at Beaujardin.

Four examples of these parrots were installed in an aviary which was
completely open and measured 5 metres long by 3 metres wide, the only
shelter being a shed, which was furnished with perches, feeding dishes,
large nesting boxes and hollow logs. At the start of the cold season, they
were put into cages to be released in the aviary in the Spring of 1883.
In 1884, M. Comely announced to the Societe d'Acclimatation that
one of the females had paired. She died in producing her first egg and the
next attempt was happier. The second pair imitated the first, after the male
was separated and there were subsequent matings followed by a laying of
eggs which hatched young".
It is also amusing to note the admiring comment, perhaps tinged with
envy, made by the Marquis of Tavistock, later Duke of Bedford, in his
book Parrots and Parrot-like Birds in Aviculture " (London): "A few
exceptional specimens, however, have lived to a great age with no special
care and the Baron von Comely, who must have possessed either uncom-
mon luck or unusual skill, bred both the Uvean and hybrids with Nymph-
icus cornutus".
It is interesting that the Marquis of Tavistock spoke of the Uvean sub-
species and of hybrids with the New Caledonian parrot. In fact, I am
very uncertain about the rearing and we have found nothing conclusive
about the actual rearing of the Horned Parrot.
Hybrids between the Uvean Parakeet and the Kakariki
Before breeding the New Caledonian parrot, I had attempted an ex-
periment which seems worth recording. For many years I had two male
Uvean Parrots E. c. uvaeensis, the form of the genus Eunymphicus char-
acterised by a crest of some six feathers whereas the nominate race has
two, and a notch on the upper mandible. The population of this parrot is
near extinction because its habitat is limited to some four or five kilo-
metres which are still uncultivated in the north-west of the islet of Uvea or
Ouvea, in the Loyalty Islands, which measures in total only fifteen kilo-
metres from north to south; it is situated to the north-east of New Cale-
donia.
This bird is a little smaller than its near relative in New Caledonia; its
coloration is less brilliant, for it does not have the yellow on the cheeks
or down the back; its crest is a uniform green, the six plumes longer at
the front than at the back, forming an arc and recurved.
In other respects, the habits of this bird are very similar even though
their habitats are completely separate, the former being a native of New

Dr. H. QUINQUE - BREEDING THE HORNED PARROT
Caledonia, an island some 400 kilometres long and the second lives in the
very small northern portion of the islet of Uvea situated many hundreds of
kilometres to the north east.
My two males were completely tame, the one very gentle, the other
fearless and sometimes aggressive towards humans.
The one whose history concerns us is more gentle; it escaped one day
from its aviary and spent the night in the belfry of a village church, some
40 metres high. I had alerted the children of the neighbourhood and the
village policeman, teaching them how to imitate the call of the Uvean
Parrot. It has a very characteristic sound, unusual in a bird, similar to
that of the New Caledonian Parrot of which we will speak later, but of a
slightly different tone.
The day following the escape, when the village policeman walked
past the church, imitating the fugitive's call, a voice answered him and our
parrot was seen on a main beam of the roof of the belfry, next to the
largest bell. The village policeman climbed up the framework of the
steeple, drew from his pocket a handful of seeds which he put in his hat;
a last song particularly well imitated (and possibly hunger) brought our
friend to the edge of the hat where he was captured, put in a pocket
and returned to his home.
Never having been able to find a companion for this bird, I thought
that it might be possible to cross it with a female Kakariki of the red-
fronted form from New Zealand Cyanoramphus novaezelandiae. The
genus Cyanoramphus and the genus Eunymphicus are dissimilar in some
respects but have many similarities. The crossing was attempted and
succeeded beyond all hopes. The first hybrids were born in 1972 and since
that date I have obtained some twenty birds. Seeing that these hybrids
are fertile, because they have produced progeny between each other, I
stopped this project.
These hybrid birds have a mixture of the characteristics of the two
parents but the size of the males is at least as large as that of their father,
this being considerably larger than their mother. The colours are those of
the Uvean Parrot, with a beautiful reddish-purple cap, not coming down
towards the eye as in the female Kakariki. This cap is thick and silky but
none of the feathers are long enough to form a crest.
The voice is an exact copy sometimes of the male, sometimes of the
female, but I have not been able to determine if this is related to the sexes
of the hybrids.
Although the parents were very gentle, the hybrids are fierce and
several have been killed in fights between each other. Quite recently, one
of them killed its mother, which I have never seen in another parrot.

Reproduction of the Horned Parrot
For lack of space during construction, I was obliged to put together
several Horned Parrots in the same aviary. Their gentleness being quite
exceptional, this was easy; apart from several courtship pursuits, there
never was a fierce peck, much less a wound. I saw, quite often, a male
feeding his female by the side of another male on the same perch without
any signs of jealousy.
It is quite evident that this promiscuity is not a good thing if one
wants to breed, and indeed, I obtained from two females several clutches
of three or four clear eggs each time.
One day, however, I decided to isolate a magnificent pair which appear-
ed to be more keen than the others, into a separate aviary. This aviary
has a shelter with a little heating, is 2.5 metres long and 1.2 metres wide,
and 3 metres high. This dwelling opens through a window into a flight
12 metres long, 2.2 metres high and 1.2 metres wide. Inside the shelter
are two nesting boxes 25 cm. in diameter, and 50 cm high. The entrance
hole, high up, is 10 cm wide. The boxes are partly filled with peat.
Normally these birds breed in New Caledonia from October to Dec-
ember during their summer. The eggs are laid in holes in tree trunks, but
sometimes, doubtless in the absence of hollow trees, I had definite inform-
ation that the nests could be made in a bank or amongst the roots of a
tree. They then occur in the form of a simple excavation or a small hole
enlarging to a chamber; but this is not the normal manner of nesting.
Clutches in the wild consist of three to four eggs; it is rare that more than
two young are reared.
The male's courtship, such as I have been able to observe it, consists
of a series of pendulum movements of the head in a vertical direction with
outspread head feathers and raising of the short feathers of the crown. The
two large spatular feathers of the crest are not erectile and remain laying
flat on the head or flutter about with the bird's movements. It is quite
useful to note, while on this subject, that the plate by W. T. Cooper in
the work by J. M. Forshaw, Parrots of the World (1973) represents with-
out doubt an immature bird, not an adult. In fact, not only are the colours
more vivid in the adult, particularly the beautiful yellow marking on the
lower part of the back which is also much wider, but the crest is much
longer and is never recurved in front as with Eunymphicus c uvaeensis.
The crest of a young adult or of a female measures about 40 millimetres
long - it is rectilinear, sloping backwards at about 45* to the head. In old
males, the crest is splendid, velvet black at the base, enlarged at the end
by two spatules of a brilliant vermilion colour. It measures 50 to 60 mm

long and often hangs down as if under the weight of the spatules, resting
on the upper part of the back, either down the middle or on the side of
the neck giving to this bird a unique appearance. There is sometimes a
third feather entirely red and slender, rectilinear and about 15 mm in
length, situated behind the two spatulate feathers.
The female begs the male to feed her with very faint calls: the male
then sings loudly with a very particular call, similar but deeper than that of
the Uvean Parrot. This song rather resembles the somewhat nasal sound
made by a child's wooden trumpet. The human voice can imitate it by
making the sound "ko...ko...ko...", partly through the nose and repeated
with decreasing volume, from five to twenty times holding each syllable
for three to four seconds. Then the song becomes "confidential", only
heard within three or four metres, in the form of a single note short and
muffled. Then the male regurgitates after much bending and stretching
of the neck, and feeds the female which bends its head back.
The part which is perhaps the most characteristic is the rapid con-
traction and dilation of the pupil of the male, in rhythm with his song.
The movement of the reddish-orange iris is easily observed with the aid
of binoculars. These movements of the iris can also be seen when the
male is excited by an unusual event or when he displays to a human
observer. I have never seen the mating.
The female laid a first clutch of three eggs which were clear at the end
of March 1979. At the end of May, after having visited the two nests and
nibbled splinters of wood inside, she chose the one which was placed
under the north wall of the shelter. Very fine white wood shavings were
detached to carpet the peat.
Another clutch of three clear eggs was produced in the middle of May.
From the last week in May, the male recommenced feeding the female.
The first egg was laid on 7th June 1979. From that date, and in other
incubations, the female did not leave the nest except in the mornings
about 8 a.m. for a few minutes, feeding herself only rarely, she was assidi-
ously fed by the male.
Very often the male stayed in the nest for several hours with his mate,
only leaving to look for food. I have only seen this behaviour in Gang
Gang Cockatoos and certain lories.
On 25th June I found that the female left the nest. A rapid inspection
revealed the presence of three eggs, one fertile and the two others clear.
The eggs are pure white, smooth and almost round. The dimensions are
as follows: 29 mm x 25 mm - 29 mm x 25 mm and 28 mm x 26 mm. I
have measured many others with identical results. These figures taken

from some ten eggs are higher than those given by J. M. Forshaw. The
30th June was for me a day of great joy because it saw the birth of a
beautiful chick covered in grey down. I had hoped for this for a long time,
because I had, in fact, reared every psittacine species in my collection
except for this one. More than the joy of a breeder, I felt a very strong
emotion because this rare event was without doubt the beginning of the
rescue, by captive breeding, of a species in serious danger of extinction.
Incubation is thus 21 to 23 days as the first egg was laid on 7th June
and the chick hatched on 30th June. One egg being laid each day, it is
impossible to know when the fertile egg was laid.
On 5th July, the chick was ringed with some apprehension, but with
no harm done. The parents were not put out in any way and continued to
feed it with great solicitude. I was surprised by the attitude of the mother:
she stayed permanently in the nest, either on or beside her young, for
more than 20 days, even during the three or four inspections which I
made. This was perhaps due to the cool weather which we were experi-
encing in France at the time with temperatures around 15 - 18*C.
While the parents always refused any insectile food, the young one
was fed almost exclusively on mealworms for the first ten days of its
life.
Thanks to this diet, the growth of the chick was very fast, much more
so than, for example, that of a broadtail of the same age. Later the parents
gradually reduced the animal food in order to give the usual dry seeds with
a passing preference for hemp seed, sunflower seeds, fruits, green stuff and
a little biscuit. Examination of the chick during the first few days revealed
an extraordinary characteristic: whereas it was entirely covered in a dark
grey down, I noticed a cap of white down on the head. This cap which
covers the crown of the head in the early days narrowed on the back of
the head to form a circle well determined of 10 mm in diameter around
the fifteenth day when the outline of the primaries and the tail feathers
began to appear.
At the end of the third week, the first blue and green of the wings and
tail appears while the cap on the back of the head gradually disappears. I
noted the presence of the same white occipital spot on all the hybrids
E. c. uvaeensis x C novaezelandiae.
On the morning of 3rd August, that is 34 days after hatching, a perfect-
ly formed bird left the nest. Some hours later it was capable of flying
very well and of perching outside the shelter.
After leaving the nest, the colours were scarcely less brilliant than
those of the parents; only the yellow of the cheeks and of the lower part

of the back was not such a bright gold as on the parents. The feet were
light, the iris brown, the beak light yellow; the dark red crown as extended
as that of the parents; there was no crest. It was the same size as the
mother: that is about a sixth less than the male. The primaries and the
tail feathers were fully grown.
The character of this young one is much more confident than that of
most psittacines, some of which are sometimes timid in spite of having
tame parents.
The young bird was fed by the parents for about forty days, and then
began very quickly to feed itself on fruits and particularly green stuff.
On 13th August, the first red feather of the crest appeared; on 20th
August one could see two very fine, entirely red feathers, one a centimetre
long, the other slightly more. These feathers were straight except for
sloping forward at the tips.
From 15th August the female began visiting her nest again. Normally,
I clean out the nest boxes after each clutch; taking account of the habits
of the Horned Parrot I left everything strictly alone, the nest being very
tidy and hardly damp. I believe that this is important because these
birds are said to return every year to their nesting tree. In the Isle of
Uvea, for example, the families which live there share the nesting amongst
each other and consequently the nests and their young: each family may
own two or three nests occupied each year by the same couples.
This species is fortunately strictly protected, Dr. Delacour's book
having made the New Caledonians aware of the inestimable living treasures
of which they are the custodians. In addition, in New Caledonia, the
government and enlightened bird lovers have created a park at Noumea
to save many species including the Kagu and possibly Eunymphicus .
These people, in advance of some others, have understood that captivity,
can contribute to the saving of species in danger. They have come up
against fierce defenders of the wild who are opposed to any capturing
vfor captivity. These people certainly had some grounds as long as the
environment remained viable for wildlife, but the human population grows
more quickly than that of other animals and we must not wait until it
is too late to save a species as has so often been the case since the begin-
ning of this century.

Coffin's Cockatoo, Cacatua goffini, is a small species which appears all
white at a quick glance, and crestless. In actual fact it has quite large
areas of the plumage yellow (underside of wings and tail) and pale orange
(bases of the feathers of the head and crest - most conspicuous on lores),
and an erectile crest which usually lays flat on the crown. The bill is grey-
ish white. Length is about 32 cm (12 in). The female is usually slightly
smaller.

It is a simple matter to sex adult birds seen in good light. The iris of the
eye is black in males and reddish-brown in females. The area of raised
skin surrounding the eye is generally more prominent in males.

This cockatoo is found only in the Tenimber Islands in Indonesia.
Extensive deforestation has occurred there in recent years. Before this
devastation, the species was very common. Bill Timmis, curator of Hare-
wood Bird Garden, told me that when visiting the Tenimber Islands in
1962, he went to Jamdena, which was then heavily forested. He saw large
numbers of Goffm's, on the coast and inland, mostly in pairs. At dusk
they returned to their roosting trees, some of these being along water
courses, where they would settle on the outermost branches of tall trees.
He noted that their flight was direct, with deliberate wing-beats.

Prior to 1972, Goffm's Cockatoo was rare in aviculture. I knew this
species only from a pair in Wassenar Zoo in Holland. In that year large-
scale export commenced: hundreds of Goffin's were received by dealers
in Europe and the USA. Mass export resulted in this most attractive
little cockatoo becoming the least expensive member of the genus. The
inevitable result was that it did not receive the attention or appreciation
it deserved. Although now exported much less often, it remains the least
expensive of the cockatoos.

Breeding Successes

In Britain the first completely successful breedings occurred in 1977.
The Society's medal was awarded to Neil O'Connor of Surrey whose
pair reared a single youngster. In the same year Mr. and Mrs R. H. Day of
Bournemouth hand-reared one Goffin's. The male of the breeding pair
unfortunately died in January 1978. Another male was obtained a few
weeks later and the female laid a single egg in the early part of 1979. It
was infertile. Two more eggs were laid in June. Both hatched in July
and the chicks were hand-reared to independence from the age of about
ten days. Additionally, Mr. and Mrs R. Mann of Stilton, Peterborough,
reared a single youngster in 1978. There is an interesting story behind this
success. The male had plucked itself severely, thus a second male was
obtained and placed in the aviary containing the pair. Although the
plucked bird was unable to fly, it kept the second male away from the
female and never again plucked itself. The new male was removed, and,
when the male was fully feathered, the original pair bred successfully.
Also in 1978, this species was reared at liberty in the Lake District
by J. H. Strutt. Two young were reared in a Scots pine tree. In 1979 a
single youngster was reared and left the nest in early July.
Outside the UK, Goffin's Cockatoo has been bred in Holland by E.G.B.
Schultz in 1974 (see AviculturalMagazine 1975, 155-6).
Surprisingly, it seems that no successes have been reported in the
USA, where more cockatoos are reared annually than in any other coun-
try.
My own pair was obtained in 1972, through the generosity of a member
of the Society, Mrs S. Belford. They were placed in an aviary measuring
approximately lift (3.3 m) long, 4 ft (1.2 m) wide and 6 ft (1.8 m) high.
It is situated a few feet from the kitchen window; thus the birds are
readily observed. Imported when young, my pair have always been com-
patible and completely devoted to each other.
Over the years they were provided with a varied assortment of nesting
sites, until their aviary began to look like a depository for unwanted
nest-boxes. Screaming noisily, with crest erect, they would cautiously
place their heads inside a nesting receptacle but never enter. It seemed
that they were afraid to do so. Eventually they were offered an oblong
box with the entrance near floor level, which was entered. During the
summer of 1978 they were provided with a log, placed horizontally on
the ground which obviously met with their approval. Had this been pro-
vided several years before it might have stimulated them to nest, as cocka-
toos do not take seven years to reach sexual maturity. Failure to provide a

nesting site which suited them was almost certainly the reason for the
seven-year wait.
During April the following year, 1979, the female spent increasing
periods inside and, judging by her behaviour, the first egg was laid on
30th April. As incubation is shared in the white cockatoos, the male gener-
ally brooding during the day and the female at night, when the male is
absent during the day one knows that incubation has commenced - in
this case on 2nd May.
On the morning of 30th May an egg-shell, with one end removed, was
seen in front of the log. A chick had hatched. Later, I heard the sound of a
chick being fed. Two days later I could hear two chicks but not until
seven more days had passed was the second egg-shell ejected from the
nest.
Most white cockatoos are extremely conservative feeders when first
imported; it usually takes them several years to acquire a liking for most
foods other than seed. This was true of the Goffin's which, fortunately,
as it is an excellent rearing food, preferred corn on the cob to all other
items. As fresh corn was not available, it was necessary to use frozen cobs
which had been thawed. A section about 2 in (5 cm) long was given
every two hours or so, as well as spinach. The only other food taken
with enthusiasm was spray millet. Sunflower and canary seed, normally
the staple items of their diet, were also available.
After the first chick hatched, the male proved to be a devoted parent,
spending all day inside the log brooding the young. The female spent a
large part of the day in the flight feeding. I did not see the male do so until
17 days after the first chick was heard. When they were being fed they
made a chip-chip-chip sound which was clearly audible. Often the sound
could be heard when the female was in the flight; thus it was evident that
the male did most or much of the feeding.
The change in the female's behaviour after the chicks hatched was
interesting. She suddenly became tame, clinging to the wire and "asking"
for food (although extras were supplied very frequently) while the male,
who was rarely seen, remained more wary.
The pair did not normally leave the nest together except when there
was a cat in the vicinity, when they would scream in unison until it had
departed. The mewing sounds made by the chicks could then be heard
more loudly than when they were being brooded.
On 16th June I became concerned at apparently hearing the voice of
only one chick. Previously, using a torch and a mirror to attempt to see
inside the log proved unsuccessful. On the following day the piece of wood

nailed to the end of the log was taken off. This revealed a large well-
nourished chick which had its eyes wide open and its crop partly full.
It then weighed nearly 6 oz. The contrast between it and its sibling was
astounding. The second chick was less than half its size, weighed 3 oz
and had no food in its crop. It was at once removed for hand-rearing.
It proved very easy to feed, holding its head high and opening its
mouth wide. It took the food from a spoon with the sides bent inwards
(especially adapted for feeding parrot chicks) with the same strong pump-
ing action as it would have taken it from its parent's beak. It them made
the chip-chip-chip sound associated with food swallowing as well as
impatient noises between each spoonful.
Two days later there was a change in the behaviour of the adult birds.
Both left the log at 8.30 p.m. They would go to the log and look inside
yet seemed afraid to enter. As neither bird had returned by 10.30 p.m.
the chick was removed. There was still food in its crop.
Much larger and nearly double the weight of its sibling, it was very
much quieter and more placid and its feeding action was weak in compar-
ison. This was not due to any weakness but probably because it was less
avid for food, having been well cared for. I fed it several times before
returning it to the nest at 7 a.m. on the following morning. The male
entered the nest at once and brooded and tended the chick throughout
the day. However, the evening brought a recurrence of the happenings of
the previous day. The chick was thus removed again; this time its crop
was empty and it was not returned to the log.
It had then only emerging pin feathers and might not have survived
the night without being brooded. The pink and white appearance of
cockatoo chicks is in complete contrast to the young of other parrots:
nails and beak are white and the pink skin is not darkened by the feather
tracts, as the feathers are white.
As the young feather up, their appearance is different from that of
most other parrots in which pin feathers appear in a definite order over
different parts of the body. In cockatoo chicks, pin feathers appear
simultaneously over most of the body, so that at one stage a cockatoo
chick has the appearance of a white porcupine, being covered in unopened
quills. The first to open are those of the underparts.
When the chicks were removed the pair recommenced to mate and the
female started throwing out the wood chips gnawed from inside the log.
However, another nesting attempt was not made; after a few days they
began to moult.
The chicks grew rapidly, weighing 11 oz and 6 oz at 37 and 35 days.

One week later, the elder was fully feathered, apart from the quills in tail
and flights which were still in their sheaths. In comparison, the younger
looked two weeks younger, being fairly well covered with feathers but
only two-thirds the size. The tail sheaths were just appearing, while those
of the elder chick were 1 in (2.5 cm) long.
It was noticeable that the skin surrounding the eye was bluer than in
the adults. And the coral-red bases to the feathers of the head, including
the crest, were extremely prominent. When fully feathered, the younger
had a coral tinge to the feathers of the mantle.
They were slow to learn to walk in comparison with most parrot
chicks at a similar stage of development. Until they were about six weeks
old they sat on their haunches with their four toes pointing forward. The
younger usually had its feet outstretched in a manner which might have
led some observers to believe that it was deformed. At six weeks the
elder chick started to walk. At First he had difficulty in controlling the
direction of his large feet.
At this stage, when weighing about 12 oz, he ceased to gain weight
and became more difficult to feed. Indeed, he behaved exactly as one
would expect of a chick of about one month older which was on the point
of being weaned. When offered sunflower kernels he would attempt to
chew them and, when given whole seeds, he discovered in a matter of
minutes how to remove the husk. Small pieces of apple or biscuit did
not interest him at all.
At six weeks the younger chick suddenly ceased its tiresome crying
and allowed itself to be handled, previously tolerating this only to be
fed. At the same time it occasionally became more difficult to feed; never
before had it refused a spoonful of food, crying for more even when its
crop was bulging.
The food consisted of various items which were liquidised in a blender.
It contained chopped spinach, corn off the cob, carrot (grated), Casilan
(milk powder, 92% protein, made by Farley Health Products, Plymouth),
skimmed milk powder and wheat germ cereal. To ensure the food con-
tained adequate calcium, a small amount of bone meal and scraped cuttle-
fish bone were added. The resulting soupy mixture was heated in a sauce-
pan before each feed. Fresh food was made once daily.
By the time he was seven and a half weeks old the elder chick differed
from an adult only in his shorter tail and more colourful plumage.
A week previously the young cockatoos had been moved from the
heated cage to a metal one. Soon after, the elder chick started to perch
but the younger made no attempt to do so until three weeks later.

By this time, both were quite vocal, "warbling" softly to themselves
with contentment after being fed. Both could make a harsher creaking
sound, usually heard when they were playing. When he was eight weeks
old the elder youngster could fly downwards when encouraged to do so.
At nine weeks he flew upwards for the first time. His flight was strong,
so much so that two days later he circled the room four times and could
land with confidence on the picture rail or door top. There was nothing
experimental about his first flights - but then he had spent several days
vigorously flapping his wings without taking off. This created such a
strong draught that his small sister would cower out of the way!
Demolition expert is a description which has been applied by many
owners of Goffin's Cockatoos to their birds. Nevertheless, I had not
expected this trait to make itself evident in a bird of the tender age of
ten weeks. By this time, Kettle, as the elder chick was known, enjoyed
his excursions around the room so much that he protested strongly when
he returned to his cage. It was made of metal with a punch bar front;
Kettle demonstrated his objection by champing on the wires so that they
acquired strange shapes or were pulled completely out of position.
It might be wondered how I could be certain of the sex of these cocka-
toos at such an early age, before adult eye colour was assumed. This is
relatively easy as the shape of the head differs in male and female: it is
larger and bolder with more height above the eye in the male. The dif-
ference was particularly pronounced in these two birds, as is their temp-
erament. The male is an extrovert, knowing from an early age how to
charm his human friends.
Cockatoos are among the most intelligent of birds and the Bare-eyed,
to which the Goffin's is closely related, has long been recognised as one of
the cleverest and most amusing of the cockatoos. Nevertheless, I was
constantly amazed at the intellect demonstrated by Kettle from an early
age. He was full of confidence and extremely quick to learn. In most
respects his progress was two or three weeks more advanced than his
sister's - rather remarkable when one considers that this species would
normally spend about ten weeks in the nest.
At nine and a half weeks he was feeding mainly on his own; it proved
impossible to feed him on most occasions as he refused to open his beak.
About twice daily he would be hungry enough to run to the offered spoon
and feed avidly. At this time his sister was being fed about four times
daily.
Both birds spent much time feeding, and, by then, their droppings had
the solid consistency of those of an adult. They were offered whole

sunflower seed which had been soaked for 24 hours then washed well in
running water; sunflower kernels (dry) and apple and carrot which were
chopped into minute pieces. Millet sprays were eaten, although probably
the greater part was wasted. They were actually spoon-fed once daily until
November; this, of course was not necessary but up until that time we
were hand-feeding a Red Lory Eos bornea and the young cockatoos de-
manded a share on seeing the spoon. Even at the time of writing (February
1980) the sight of a spoon triggers infantile behaviour: they drop the
wings submissively and emit the throaty food-begging sound. If offered the
tip of the spoon they will grasp it firmly and pump the head.
However, I firmly believe that a gradual weaning process is benefi-
cial and that too rapid weaning can be harmful and could cause excessive
weight loss.
The cockatoos started their first moult in December 1979, with the
feathers of the head, crest and nape. At the time of writing the moult is far
from complete.

By F. BOHNER (Happy Valley, South Australia)
The race of Red-tailed Cockatoo to which these notes refer inhabits
the south-west regions of Western Australia and differs from the nominate
form by its smaller size, more rounded crest and less drawn out call.
Males are black with back, nape and lower breast slightly washed with
brown; central tail feathers black whilst others are black but with a sub-
terminal band of bright red; bill blackish. Females are brownish black with
numerous yellow spots on head, neck and wings. Feathers on underparts
are margined with pale yellow or orange. Tail band yellow becoming
progressively more orange towards the tip and crossed by black bars. Bill
horn coloured.
The breeding pair occupied an outside flight in a block of three
aviaries and had a pair of Yellow-tailed Cockatoos as neighbours in the ad-
joining aviary. The flight measures 26 ft long by 8 ft high by 5 ft wide.
Two-thirds of the roof is covered to keep the shelter area as dry and as
private as possible, also to minimise the introduction of worms from wild
bird droppings.

inches was provided as a nesting log. This was put near the roof just inside
the shelter, facing east, and angled at thirty degrees to facilitate access.
Moist rotted wood dirt (peat) was placed to a depth of six inches to
provide a suitable base. The first signs of nesting were noticed in March
1975 when the hen was seen inside the log. Two weeks of general inspec-
tion followed before she started to chew chips of wood from the inside
and top of the log to add to the base. The first egg was laid on 22nd April
but was not incubated. It was removed for artificial incubation but proved
infertile, as did a second egg laid four weeks later.
The 1976 season proved successful with a fertile egg being laid on
13 th February. The hen alone incubated and was seldom seen except if a
disturbance occured. It hatched on the 28th day and the male was seen to
feed the female on several occasions. She was absent from the log often
and for long periods during the day which caused some concern, but
always returned at night and carried out normal parental duties.
The youngster was first observed when three days old and was covered
in yellow down. It was well fed and appeared quite healthy. Another

check was made a week later when signs of feather growth were detected
beneath the skin. Eyes were only half open at this stage. At the age of
nine weeks the youngster ventured to the top of the log daily, from
where the female fed and preened it. If a sudden noise was heard during
these periods, the female would prod the youngsters head with her beak,
sending it back to the bottom of the log out of sight. Vacation of the
log took place at fourteen weeks with the male then showing much pride
in his offspring. Protection of both female and young was evident and
particularly noticeable when the Yellow-tailed Cockatoos adjoining
ventured onto the aviary partition wire. The reaction was always immed-
iate aggression by the male Red-tail.
For the first four nights the parents coaxed the youngster back to
the top of the log where they all camped. Thereafter, the roost was chang-
ed to a perch at the front of the aviary with the youngster eventually
settling down between its parents for the night.
It was a fine specimen being slightly smaller than the hen with much
the same body colour. Its face was marked heavily with yellowish spots
while the rest of the body was only slightly so. The mandibles were almost
fully white indicating it to be a hen. She was strong on the wing and able
to cover the full length of the aviary in level flight but her landings left a
lot to be desired for some time. The hen continued to feed it until about
a year old.
The main seed diet offered comprised of sunflower. Millet, canary
seed and hulled oats were offered but not eaten. Once a week some
almonds or raw peanuts were fed and occasionally, a little boiled maize.
Other items of fairly regular supply were ripe pine cones, the native
Casuarina and Banksia seed pods, and eucalypt branches holding seed
capsules. These latter items are not only beneficial to the diet but provide
many hours of natural entertainment by chewing which prevents boredom
and unnatural behavioural antics. Shell and course grit, as well as cuttle-
fish bone are available at all times. During rearing, soft foods in the form
of sprouted sunflower seeds, apple, plain cake or biscuit and green pana-
cum grass stems are offered, with at least one of these being offered daily.
Panacum stems were particularly relished.
The third season commenced with the laying of an egg on 21st Jan-
uary. This left the young hen with the male who weaned it as the female
no longer fed it due to incubating. It was left in the flight until the second
young left the nest as it provided company for the male but was then re-
moved to another aviary as slight rejection became evident. At this stage
she had just began to utter the adult call more often instead of the normal
soft squeak.

F. BOHNER - BREEDING THE RED TAILED COCKATOO
The second youngster vacated the nest early spending only ten weeks
in the log. It was totally different in appearance to the first with the
plumage much blacker. Yellow spotting on the head was absent but pre-
sent at a lesser extent on the wings and body. Upper and lower mandibles
black with whitish tips. This suggested the bird was a probable cock which
was borne out later by its behaviour. At the age of two years and nine
months it possessed two red tail feathers.
Next season started late with the hen not laying until 9th March.
Incubation started next day and was again 28 days with the chick vacating
the log after twelve weeks. Plumage was similar to the last youngster but
bill colouration differed; upper mandible was black while the lower was
white with dark tip.
On 4th March 1979 the hen again started incubating. Her absence
from the previous years youngster made it squawk incessantly which
aggravated her causing her to give it the occasional tap on the head in
scorn. It was then removed to another aviary to give its parents peace and
quiet during breeding. Incubation was again 28 days and fledging took
thirteen weeks. It was a male.
Juveniles are reported as being similar in appearance to females but
from the four reared in my collection, young are clearly sexable on leaving
the nest. Males tend to have a more blackish plumage with some yellow
spots on body and wings but often more in the facial regions. They tend to
call more and elicit their parents' attention more frequently than hens do.
Bill colour is generally black with varying amounts of white but stabilises
to a uniform colour when about 2 Vi years old. Females usually have
whitish beaks with many yellow spots on the head and more over the body
than males.
Activities for the 1980 season have started early with the female
inspecting the log on 11th December so I remained hopeful of repeating
the previous successes.

BREEDING THE WESTERN RACE OF THE CAPE PARROT
</sectionHeader>

Poicephalus robustus fusdcollis (Kuhl)
By G, ISERT and H. ISERT (West Berlin.)
Of the Cape Parrot, a species widely distributed over the tropical and
subtropical parts of Africa, three subspecies have been described which are
separated from each other by wide gaps. Although it may be difficult to
distinguish the western subspecies P. r. fusdcollis from the Central African
P. r. suahelicus if the country of origin is unknown, the difference between
these two subspecies and the nominate race from South Africa is clear
enough: while in the two former birds the head and neck are silvery grey,
these parts are yellowish brown in P. r robustus. On the other hand,
differences between P. r. suahelicus and P. r. fusdcollis are only slight
and consist of a more bluish tinge of the green part of the plumage in
the latter.
According to Snow there is a remarkable difference in ecology between
the two northern races, which are birds of seasonal woodland and wood-
savannah mainly at tropical levels over most of their range, and the South
African race which is primarily a bird of the montane Podocarpus forests
above 1000 m, where it roosts and breeds at subtropical and temperate
levels moving down to feed in adjacent low-lying coastal forest and wood-
ed valleys.
Cape Parrots have rarely been kept in captivity and we know only of
one breeding success which took place in Basle Zoo in 1964 and has
been described by Lang in volume 75 of this Magazine. In the spring of
1974 I managed to buy a Cape Parrot from a dealer in Berlin who had
imported the bird from Gambia. As in all races of P robustus females
show a brick red front reaching back to the eyes, it was easy to sex my
bird as a female. I had to wait until August 1976 to obtain a suitable
cock from a dealer in Maintal, who had imported several birds from
West Africa. At the beginning very nervous and timid, the two parrots had
to be kept in separate cages, and it was necessary to avoid hasty move-
ments when near them. They were always nervous with people they did
not know. Compared with many other species of parrots, Cape Parrots are
no great criers. They only called in flight when we had them flying in the
room and then only for about ten minutes in the morning and evening.
They are very swift and nimble flyers and even in a small room never
knock into a wall or window.

Their cages were put side by side for some weeks, so that the birds
could become accustomed to each other, and in the middle of September
1976 they were put together in an flight 100 cm x 210 cm x 80 cm,
supplied with a nesting box 30 cm x 30 cm x 55 cm, the floor of which
was covered with a thin layer of sawdust. The entrance hole of the nesting
box was enlarged by the birds to a suitable width for them. The pair got
on well together and the first mating was observed on 6th November, 1976
and was repeated four or five times daily until the first egg was laid on
26th November 1976 and was numbered. Three days later the second egg
followed and the clutch was completed. In our birds we have never obser-
ved clutches of three eggs as described for the nominate race in Basle Zoo.
The female sat on the eggs from the time she laid the first and only left the
nest to relieve herself. She was then fed by the cock.
After an incubation period of 28 days the first young bird hatched
from the first egg. Two days later the second young bird followed. When
the birds were 17 and 19 days old the female left the nesting box for the
first time for about 20 minutes to feed on her own. On 7th March, 1977
the first young bird, at the age of 71 days, looked out of the nesting box
for the first time. On the following days he sat several times in the en-
trance hole. The second young bird sat in the entrance hole for the first
time when he was 74 days old.
Immature birds of both sexes of Poicephalus robustus resemble the
adult female in plumage, but head and neck have a stronger tinge of red,
while the thighs and carpal edges show no red. Also the red forehead is
weaker in the young and interspersed with silver grey feathers in the
immature male. After six months the red of the head of both has disap-
peared and the colour of the head resembles that of the male. In the young
female, two or three feathers appear on the forehead at the age of nine
months; at the age of ten months she loses the first primaries and has a
brick red head-band of 5 mm wide and a few red feathers on the thighs
and wing-edges. At the age of ten months the young male acquired the
first red feathers on the thighs and the edges of the wings. In the young
of both sexes the red does not extend as far as it does on the parents
until the bird is three years old.
At the age of 82 days the first young bird flew out and was back in
the nesting box an hour and a half later. The second young bird flew
out for the first time at 85 days and was back in the nesting box after
an hour. The next day both young left the nesting box in the morn-
ing and were fed shortly by the cock. They spent almost the whole day in
the aviary and returned in the evening to the nesting box where they
spent the night with the hen. On 3rd April 1977 a young bird was ob-

served for the first time feeding independently. From 4th April onwards,
these young birds were no longer fed by the cock; they had to feed inde-
pendently at the age of 98 and 100 days. After the first young bird had
looked out of the nesting box, the cock was no longer observed feeding
the female, or the female feeding the young birds. These were separated
from their parents on 3rd July, 1977.
At the end of 1977 the pair hatched another two young; the incubation
period was the same. The first young bird flew out at the age of 81 days;
the second at the age of 83 days. They were independent at the age of 100
and 102 days. In the autumn of 1978 a clutch was not fertilized, probably
because of a change of place. At the beginning of 1979 two eggs were
again laid. The young birds flew out at the same time as the first hatch and
were independent at the same age. At the beginning of December 1979 the
pair had its fifth clutch. One day, two days before the eggs were expected
to hatch, one egg was found broken on the ground; from this time on the
hen no longer sat on the other egg. Now, in February 1980 the pair again
has young birds in the nesting box.
Their diet consisted of walnuts, hazlenut&apos;s, pine nuts, peanuts, white
and black sunflower seeds, dry and germinated, as well as apples, bananas
and grapes. They also received carrots, hard cooked egg-yolk and milky
corn, finger sized branches of fruit trees, and regularly calcium and cuttle-
bone. Compared with Grey Parrots, P. robustus are weak feeders, except
if there are young birds in the nest. It is a peculiarity of our Cape Parrots
to hold a twig in one foot while feeding on small seed. We believe this to
be a sort of "Ersatzhandlung", for in the wild they may take small seed
or fruit by holding the twig it is growing on within reach of the bill.
We hope our breeding pair will continue to breed so reliably in the
future.

FIRST CAPTIVE BREEDING OF THE JAMAICAN
BLACK-BILLED AMAZON Amazona agilis
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.993428869565217" page_id="56283963"  page_num="209" year="" vol="">
By RAMON NOEGEL (Seffner, Florida, USA)
Our four Jamaican Black-billed Amazons arrived early in 1977 and at
the time we believed them to be youngsters due to their very dark eyes.
However, as the year wore on and the eyes remained dark we began to
realize that here was an Amazon Parrot that did not develop a distinct iris
colour as in most other Amazons. With this realisation in mind we placed a
nest box on their aviary in the spring of 1978 which triggered a battle
between the two pairs and resulted in our removing the two specimens
which were being dominated by the true pair. Though the dominant pair
frequented their box that breeding season no eggs were deposited and we
had to wait patiently until this season. Not expecting any actual nesting
before late April or early May we were rather surprised to find two eggs
already being incubated on 10th April. Upon candling, one egg proved
fertile and both were replaced in the nest box. By the end of April it was
obvious that there was a chick because of the heavy consumption of
additional food by the cock. As the hen sat tight and never left the nest
box while anyone was around the area, we thought it best to wait and not
risk disturbing her. Finally on 2nd May we succeeded in seeing the chick
which was then five to seven days old, or so we judged. The infertile egg
was removed and it was decided to allow the parents to raise the chick.
Our policy here at Life Fellowship has always been to remove and hand-
rear most of our psittacines when they reach seven to twelve days of age.
In this case we felt that our lack of knowledge regarding this particular

species of Amazon merited leaving the chick remaining under the expert
care of its very judicious parents. On 21st June the young Jamaican
Black-billed Amazon fledged. Two days later we discovered the parents for
some reason had chewed all its tail feathers. We removed it to a 3 ft. x 3 ft.
x 3 ft. cage adjoining the parents aviary and continued to hand feed it
twice a day until the time of this writing (12th July 1979). It has already
begun to eat soft foods and to crack a few seeds.
Little is known about the Jamaican Black-billed Amazon's habits. Its
beautiful dark green makes this parrot hard to distinguish in its dense
native forests on the island. On the two visits I have made to Jamaica I
have only once caught sight of this parrot, though the more commonly
seen Jamaican Yellow-billed Amazon A. collaria is often sighted while
driving along coastal roads adjacent to heavily populated areas. While
reports indicate that the Black-billed Amazon is still plentiful in its inland
habitat, hunters still find it difficult to obtain and concentrate on the
Yellow-billed Amazon as there seems to be more of a demand for it due
to its soft pastel colouring and its reputed ability as a better talker than
agilis. What this parrot may lack in colour or talking ability it certainly
makes up for in personality and antics. During the courtship ritual the
cock makes charges at the hen in such a comical manner as to remind one
of an automatic toy, swaying from side to side with stiff legged jerky
motions. Upon reaching the hen he jumps over her as if playing leap frog
only to resume the jerky walking until about two feet away where he
turns and begins a similar charge and another hop over the hen. We have
seen this ritual repeated for as long as thirty minutes or more. In other
Amazons such ritual is of less duration and none so comical. During this
performance the hen sits perfectly still while uttering soft chortlings to
encourage her suitor in his jester-like pursuit. No crouching by the hen was
observed as witnessed in other Amazon species when preparing for copu-
lation, nor did we see actual copulation take place. In our other Amazons,
copulation usually takes place early in the morning between sunrise to
8.00 a.m. and in the late afternoon from about 5.00 p.m. until dark.
There is little dimorphism in these Amazons: both are uniform green.
Both have a single or at the most five red or orange feathers just above
the cere and both have the black ear-coverts. The only sexual difference
seems to be the hen's smaller more rounded head. Both have the same
body shape which is slightly on the dumpy side in fully adult birds.
This first captive breeding of the Jamaican Black-billed Amazon makes
three species and three sub-species of the Caribbean Amazons being bred
here at Life Fellowship. Many thanks are in order to all my wonderful
staff and especially to Greg Moss whose devotion to our collection

demands more than the time required of him. Such a large responsibility
could not be carried out without each worker's cooperation and any
success is to a great extent due to their loyalty to this project. None
are paid for their work, it is entirely a labour of love for the birds.
While we are working with other rare types of Amazon parrots and
other equally rare psittacines, the Caribbean Amazons have always been
my favourites and command most of my attention. The realization of
their dwindling habitat, coupled with their uniqueness and beauty have
long held my attention and that of our other workers also. This breeding
will make three first world breedings for us, all being Caribbean Amazons.
While we are proud of these first breedings we do not loose sight of the
real purpose which is the saving by captive breeding of rare and endan-
gered species. The knowledge that we are doing something really worth
while for the preservation of these rarities is compensation enough.

Amazona ochrocephala
By JOHN and JOSIE ARMAN (Peterborough)
We purchased our pair of Yellow-crowned Amazons on 10th September
1978, after being told that they were, as far as could be ascertained,
approximately eight years old, and had only once in their lives been in an
aviary, the rest of their time having been spent in various cages indoors. We
decided to keep the birds, which we believed to be a pair, indoors for two
weeks, during which time their aviary and indoor quarters were prepared.
On 22nd September the birds were placed in their indoor quarters
with the hole to the outdoor flight blocked off, to allow them to get
used to the quarters and to where their food and water could be found.
The inside quarters were 54 in. high by 34 in. wide by 18 in. deep. One
perch only was installed, of natural wood. The Amazons were then left
for three days to settle in.
On 24th September we installed a nest box in the outside flight, atta-
ched to the shed wall, under overhead cover of wood and roofing felt of

two and a half feet. This was to keep the nest box dry. Later in the day we
opened the bob-hole and waited. During the course of the afternoon, both
birds ventured into the flight, the cock first followed tentatively by the
hen. Both birds also found their way back to the inside quarters in the
early evening.
On 25th September we observed the hen inspecting the inside of the
nest box nervously. Both birds stayed in the outside flight all night, the
only time they have done so. Their routine is to return to the inside
quarters at dusk and remain there until the following morning. The foll-
owing day, the cock bird (what we presumed to be the cock) was observed
showing interest in the nest box and later entered it. On inspection of the
nest box when the birds had gone indoors, we discovered that the cock
had made alterations to the wood laths provided to make the nest.
Their regular diet consisted of sunflower seed mixed with Vitapet and
PYM (ratio two lbs. seed, two tablespoons Vitapet, two tablespoons PYM)
shaken well. This is always left for 24 hours before feeding, to allow the
Vitapet to soak into the seed. In addition, we fed peanuts, canary and hemp.
Fruit was offered. During January, as the weather was colder, we intro-
duced a nectar mixture (as recommended by Rosemary Low in "Parrots
of South America") adding three drops of Abidec to her recipe and feeding
the birds once a week in small drinkers. Throughout the early winter
months, and through to December, the Amazons continued their ritual
of eating, preening, exercising and sleeping.
On 14th April 1979, we were thrilled to see our Yellow-crowned
Amazons mating and feeding. The cock bird had his right foot on the
hen's back and was emitting a type of rhythmic moan, a noise very diffi-
cult to describe which increased in volume and rapidity as mating pro-
gressed. (Thus, whenever we heard the noise, we knew the pair were
mating, as this was the only time the cock made the noise). During the
following weeks, the birds were mating almost every day, the cock bird
treading the left side then the right side of the hen. The birds always
mated on the same perch. The cock would feed the female, then begin to
flick his wings very slightly - not full span - but kept close to the body,
with just a slow deliberate shimmering of wings. When the hen was ready
to mate, she would also begin to flick her wings two or three times in the
same fashion. The procedure would last anything from three to ten min-
utes.
On 14th July, the hen entered the nest box and seemed more relaxed
than previously. She stayed in the nest box all night on 28th July, coming
out for 15 minutes early in the morning, returning, then coming out again

at 4,45 p m. for 15 minutes. The following day brought thunderstorms
and torrential rain, and the hen came off the nest all day, but the follow-
ing morning the cock bird was in the flight on his own; the hen had
returned to the nest box and remained there all day.
On 5th August, we checked the nest and to our delight, there were
two eggs. The hen had come off the nest when the cock gave his alarm call
as I entered the flight, but she returned to the nest after five minutes
(which seemed like an eternity to us) and we heaved a great sigh of relief.
At this stage, one of the eggs looked fertile, viz. grey in colour and the
other appeared a clear pinky-white which we took to be infertile. We did
not handle the eggs.
We estimated that the eggs would hatch around the 28th August and
on this day we decided to check the nest. At 7.00 p.m., I entered the
flight, the cock immediately giving his alarm call, but he did not show
any signs of aggression. We had chosen this time as the hen was out being
fed by the cock and she flapped a little, but nothing serious. On opening
the inspection flap of the nest chamber, there were still two eggs. One was
obviously clear, and the other was just chipping! We retired from the
flight, thrilled, but still not counting our chickens . . .
On 1st September we checked the nest, opening the inspection flap
carefully as the hen was inside. She sat tight for some moments and then
began to move up the tunnel. There before our eyes was a beautiful
baby Amazon, naked except for the odd wisps of down here and there.
The flesh was pink all over, including the beak and the down was white.
The eyes and ears were sealed. We removed the broken shell, but left
the infertile egg as a 44 hot water bottle" for the chick. On 5th September
we checked the nest again. The chick had a little more down - the eyes
and ears were still sealed. By 8th September the nest was beginning to get
very messy with the baby's droppings, everything was much the same.
We did not check again until 16th September. The hen was very pro-
tective and would not leave the chick. Eventually after some coaxing,
she moved halfway up the tunnel of the nest box and kept a watchful
eye. The baby's eyes and ears were now open and the tip of the beak
was beginning to go black. Dark brown quills had begun to appear. We
removed the infertile egg.
By the following weekend, the chick was much larger. The crop was
not completely full, but we presumed, as it was making such good progress
that the mother knew what she was doing. The chick now had dark grey
down all over, apart from the wings which were now showing pin feathers
of green. We took the first photographs of the baby in the nest box, and
even at this early age he would lunge forward with his beak open, and

would shrink back into the darkest corner of the box. At this stage the
outer ring of the eye was grey and the pupil was blue black. The beak
was flesh coloured with just a little black at the tip. The lower mandible
was large, feet and legs beginning to go grey. The following weekend, the
feathers on the wings were more advanced, pin feathers everywhere else.
At no time during the rearing did we hear the chick call his mother,
or indeed make any noise at all, apart from the hissing type sound which
accompanied his lunging movements when the box was opened and day-
light engulfed him.
On 7th October, we removed the chick from the nest and took him
out of the flight in order to take better photographs of his progress. The
cock bird gave his usual alarm call, and the hen sat close beside him
looking very concerned. We quickly took the photographs and returned
the chick to his mother. It was possible at this stage to distinguish the
coloured areas, the yellow on the forehead and red and yellow on the wing
butts. Feet were by now very large and completely grey, the claws being
black.
On 14th October, when the chick was exactly six weeks and one day
old, we took him away from the parents for hand-rearing. The cock and
hen sat outside in the flight for the whole day, looking most forlorn and
obviously missing their baby. Rupert, as we had named him, was well-
feathered all over, with pin feathers and down covering his body. There
were no pink patches left showing. His crop was full, so we decided to
leave him until his crop had emptied somewhat before giving him his
first feed.
Hand-rearing from six weeks
We gave Rupert his first feed on 14th October at 5.00 p.m. We used a
large syringe and mixed the following to a soft runny consistency with
warm milk: six tsp. Farex, one drop Vitapet, two tsp. Glucose, two slices
mashed over-ripe banana, and one drop of Adexolin. Rupert took his first
feed perfectly and greedily with a strong pumping action, and surprisingly
little noise, just a tiny squeak occasionally.
We had prepared a special plywood box for him with a window of green
perspex. We had also purchased a baby's size hot water bottle, which fitted
into half the floor space, leaving the other half free for him to get away
from the heat if he wanted to. The bottle was always kept just hand hot
and wrapped in a towel.
We fed Rupert again at 10.00 p.m. - the same mixture, and settled him
down for the night. His crop was almost full. At no time did we ever
over-fill his crop, tending to slightly under-fill if anything. On checking

at 5.00 a.m. the following morning, the baby still had a little food in his
crop, thus we decided he would be able to last through the nights without
being fed.
As we both work, my wife made arrangements to take Rupert to work
with her and leave him in his box in a heated conservatory, to enable
his feeds to be made regularly, at first at three-hourly intervals. The baby
was fed the same mixture at 8.00 a.m., 11.00 a.m., 1.00 p.m., 4.00 p.m.,
7.00 p.m., and 10.00 p.m., approximately seven or eight teaspoons of the
mixture at each feed, then leaving him from 10.00 p.m. until 8.00 a.m. the
following morning. He appeared to be feeding adequately, except that he
did not seem to be getting a big enough mouthful at each pump at the
syringe. We therefore decided to use a bent spoon and this proved extre-
mely successful, and indeed seemed to remind the baby of his mother's
beak, as he liked the spoon pushed right down almost into his throat.
On 21st October, we added home mix rearing food to the baby's diet,
and mixed to a slightly thicker consistency, omitting the banana as he did
not find this palatable. On occasion, when the food seemed to take longer
to pass through, we gave him a couple of teaspoons of hot water mixed
with black strap molasses, to aid his digestion after the feed, which seemed
to make the food pass through the baby's system. We now mixed a day's
supply at a time and reheated it by putting it in a cup and placing the cup
in boiling water, instead of mixing each feed freshly. The baby was being
offered food every five hours at this stage.
On 22nd and 23rd October, we had to coax him to take his food,
as after a couple of spoons he would turn his head and waddle away. On
the evening of the 23rd we gave a little hot milk to substitute for the
mix which he would not take, hoping this would replace some of the
goodness. Rupert refused his food and seemed very listless.
We had been inspecting the droppings as a matter of course, and until
this time they had been about half an inch long, dark green in colour
and very profuse. On 24th October, we noticed there was very little faeces,
and at lunchtime my wife noticed little white streaks in the droppings,
which appeared to be live worms, and consequently that evening we
sought advice from our vet. We took Rupert to the surgery and he was
wormed with Nemicide administered directly into the crop with a syringe
and tube. The vet informed us that the hot milk given the night before had
probably caused the live worms to be passed. Rupert refused any more
food that night.
This was the time that I regretted taking the chick away from his
parents, thinking that he would probably die because of my inexperience,

but the following day (at 55 days old) Rupert passed some small knots
of worms, the longest being about half an inch long, and later in the day
he passed a very large pencil-like knot of completely white faeces, about
IV 2 in. long and 3/8 in. diameter, which was solid worms, and this was the
turning point. Rupert showed immediate signs of recovery, relishing his
food once more, and returning to his old self. No more worms were passed
during the rearing.
As the parents had both been tested for worms just prior to incubation
of the eggs, we could only suppose that they had fed the baby droppings
from wild birds which had dropped through the wire roof of the flight.
This could have proved a costly exercise had we not sought immediate
treatment. Luckily, some friends of ours had warned us that two of their
Amazon babies (Lilac-crowned) had also experienced worms during the
hand-rearing period. We had therefore looked out for them.
At 69 days old Rupert was in beautiful feather, an Amazon in all but
length of tail. His beak was now three-quarters black from the tip, the cere
was grey with pink round the nostrils. During the course of the next two
weeks to 83 days, the tail feathers developed and the wing flights reached
almost full length. We had transferred him from his travelling box to a
parrot cage where he perched quite naturally at his first attempt. At night
he was returned to his box for warmth and safety.
At this time he was still on four feeds a day, but we began putting
sunflower seed and water in drinkers, although he paid little attention to
them. We cut out his lunch-time feed, hoping this would encourage him to
try the hard seed. Although he would pick up the seed and crack it, he
did not eat the kernel. On 26th November, we gave Rupert his early
morning feed, intending not to feed him again until late evening. We noti-
ced that evening, several cracked seeds and the kernels missing. We tried
him on various fruits but he would not touch any kind. He seemed to find
the wetness on his beak distasteful, and rarely drank water.
On 27th November, Rupert decided to fly. He leapt from the worktop
in the kitchen to the floor. After this he continued to try his wings at
every opportunity. We thus decided, for his own protection, to clip
his wings slightly, as he had no control over his destination or landing
platform. He tended to flap off with no idea of where he was going, and
inevitably crash landed - usually into something breakable. To clip his
wings, we cut away the trailing edges of the primary and secondary flight
feathers, but he continued to fly, usually downwards, being unable to gain
much height however much he flapped his wings.
By 5th December, Rupert was almost as large as his father. His beak

had grown much longer and was by now half black from the tip. He was
still being given a feed at 7.00 a.m. and 10.30 p.m., but was taking sun-
flower seed during the day.
He was at that stage when he loved to nuzzle into our necks, and was
fascinated by my wife's earrings, tending to tug at them. Windsor, our long-
suffering and very patient St. Bernard, was also troubled by Rupert. He
would be sleeping peacefully, and would suddenly be bombarded by an
Amazon in full-flight, and receive a gentle peck on the nose. We found
that Windsor had his own way of dealing with this. He would simply
shake his big head vigorously and Rupert would depart.
On 8th December, we noticed that Rupert's eyes had started to change
colour. On the outer ring they were very pale brown with flecks of orange.
The pupil was black. This was also the day Rupert gave his first speech,
not a long oratory but just a simple "Hello" which was as pleasant to hear
as a thousand words. Later we noticed that he had two versions of this
greeting - one being a very proper refined "Hello", the other, copying my
voice - a type of cockney "alio", omitting the 'h'.
He loved to ride in the car, showing great interest in his surroundings
and the views flashing past the window. Inevitably he would fall from his
perch - letting out an "Ouch" as he did so.
On 15th December, we took our last photographs of Rupert. He looked
every inch an Amazon, a beautiful bird with a sparkling bright eye, and
gleaming immaculate feathers.

Enicognathus leptorhynchus
By T. SILVA (North Riverside, Illinois, U.S.A.)
These interesting birds are susceptible to cold in captivity which is
surprising as they come from Chile, where it gets extremely cold. My
first male died in this way, although the second survived after being
transferred to a hospital cage. These birds appear to be decreasing in
numbers, apparently through Newcastle disease and because of deforest-
ation.
Description
These basically dull green birds have crimson foreheads and some
individuals have red in the belly and thighs. The feathers on the forehead
and back are edged in black. The bill is brown, legs also brown. The imma-
ture birds are smaller with a shorter bill tipped in horn colour. Their
plumage is darker green and the skin around the eye is white instead of the
dirty grey of the adults.
Breeding
These conures appear to be fairly good breeders in captivity. Sexes can
be fairly well distinguished by the difference in the size of the pelvic
bones. The female can be identified by its smaller head, and by the red
on its belly, which the male lacks. They are fairly noisy but become tame
very quickly and can be bred in small cages instead of flights. When my
pair was first set up for breeding in a flight they failed to produce fertile
eggs, but when moved to a cage 2 ft by 2 ft. by 3 ft., nested quickly and
produced fertile eggs. The male displays as follows: the wings are spread
slightly, the head bobs up and down and the pupils dilate, the bird screech-
ing throughout. The female sometimes displays in the same manner. The
cock mounts the hen with one foot while keeping the other on the perch.
She will crouch down and mating begins. To attract the male's attention,
the hen will feed him. Mating occurred early morning and late afternoon.
Those in my collection breed twice a year, in early spring and late autumn.
The average clutch consists of four large eggs which are broadly ovate.
Incubation lasts 26 days, although one clutch hatched in 24 days. Eggs are
laid every other day, but the hen may miss a day. She will incubate from

the first egg and, although the male may go in and sit next to her for
short periods, he does not incubate the eggs. He feeds her and at times
may feed the chicks. She comes out once a day to relieve herself and,
after about 18 days, may also bathe. Those in my collection will only rear
two chicks, and if others hatch they are killed or left to starve. The last
time that they bred, their chicks had to be removed for hand-rearing after
the oldest was killed.
Young
The chicks have white down on wings, head and body; the body colour
is pink. The are slow to grow, and at about 12 days their size is equal to
that of a Budgerigar. At ten days the voice changes from a "chirp" to a
"screech". The eyes begin to open at eight days but do not fully open
for some time. At about ten days the small dots which will become
feathers are just beginning to appear. The exact weaning period has
varied considerably from bird to bird.
Hand-feeding
The chicks do well on a formula of equal parts of finely ground mon-
key chow, high protein baby cereal and hulled, ground sunflower seed.
In addition to this the chicks were also provided with some fruit or egg,
mynah pellets with fruit, and a pinch of vitamins once daily. For the
first few days they are fed every two hours until the crop expands, then
every three hours during the day and every four hours at night. The food
is at first given in a liquid form, and thickened as the chicks grow older
and are more able to digest solids. As they grow older they are fed less
frequently; when they begin picking seeds, they are fed morning and
evening and as more seeds and fruit are taken, they are fed only at night.
Nest box
The nest box used is 12 in. by 12 in. by 12 in, filled to the top with
shavings most of which the hen tosses out when she begins to nest. The
shavings are replenished after each nesting.
The information supplied is from my experience and observations of
my own birds, which lead me to believe that that the Slender-billed
Conure could become well established in captivity.

BREEDING RESULTS FOR 1978-1979
By ROSEMARY LOW (Barnet)
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.998039085714286" page_id="56283976"  page_num="220" year="" vol="">
In past years I have called my annual reports the 197- breeding season;
however, seasons, as such, do not exist when one keeps such birds as lories
and Eclectus, for they lay in every month of the year. Thus on 1st January
1978 a Fairy Lorikeet Charmosyna pulchella rothschildii (housed indoors)
laid and on 3rd January a Meyer's Lorikeet Trichoglossus flavoviridis
meyeri also laid. Neither clutches, each of two eggs as is usual, hatched.
The Fairy laid her second egg three days later, an interval which is not
unusual.
The eggs of her second clutch were laid on 21st and 23rd April. They
were infertile and she left them on 12th May. The pair had previously
hatched chicks. This species has not been reared in Britain since E. J.
Brook's success in 1914. At the time of writing perhaps only Walsrode
Birdpark is breeding it in Europe.
This may also be true of Meyer's Lorikeet. In 1978 my husband and I
reared three, each from a separate clutch. As these birds have proved
incapable of rearing their young in our collection, they are removed
for hand-rearing at an early age.The first chick was removed from the
nest on 8th April: the nest also contained a dead chick which was perhaps
four days old at the time of its death. The live chick was probably six days
old. By 18th April, i.e. at about 16 days, its eyes were starting to open;
by 20th April, they were almost fully open. By then the underparts were
covered in light grey down. On 3rd June, i.e. at nine weeks, this chick was
moved to a cage from the heated brooder and it immediately started to
feed on its own. It commenced to moult early in August, when four
months old.
A chick from a second pair of Meyer's Lorikeets was heard on 7th April
but had died by the 13th; chicks are normally removed at six days. A
second egg contained a chick which had died in the shell.
On 11th June, eight days after the Meyer's became independent, a
six day old chick hatched by the same pair was removed from the nest
for hand-feeding. The second egg was infertile. The chick was independent
by 29th July when it was housed with its older siblings. However, unlike
the other Meyer's we have hand-reared, it has remained exceptionally
tame.
This time we had a rest of 13 days before its parents again had a single

chick which was removed from the nest on 11th August. The chick in the
second egg had died in the shell. This third chick was reared without
incident and was moved from the brooder to a cage on 10th October.
Thus we had spent from April to October rearing three Meyer's.
The procedure adopted for rearing these chicks, which has always
proved very easy, was described fully in the Avicultural Magazine , 1977,
pp.12-17. Our attempts to establish this species in captivity have, all
along, been made more difficult by the preponderance of males. In 1979
only two females were breeding; a third was too young. One, an imported
bird, is probably becoming too old to breed for, for the first time, she
failed to hatch any eggs. The second female, which had proved the most
reliable breeder, with two different males, unfortunately escaped while
we were on holiday. I blame myself for the loss of the only chick she
hatched in 1979. At six days it looked and sounded so strong I decided to
leave it in the nest for a couple more days - a serious error of judgement
for it was dead on the seventh day.
Considering that we have three laying pairs of Iris Lorikeets Tricho-
glossus iris, results with this species were not good in 1978 and 1979. Our
original pair imported in 1971 are no longer fertile and the female's
clutches now consist of a single egg only - presumably a sign of increasing
age in this tiny lorikeet, which, like the Meyer's, is smaller than a Budger-
igar. In 1978 she laid two clutches, on 4th July and 17th August. In 1979
she laid on 6th June and 7th September. In April 1979 I separated the
pair, pairing the male with a female who has never laid a fertile egg for
which I believe the male is to blame. For three weeks they steadfastly
ignored each other, keeping to opposite sides of the aviary. I then relented
and reunited the pairs with their first mates. The pair bond between the
original pair, the first to reach Britain for many years, hand-reared by
natives and therefore almost certainly a brother/sister pair, is very strong.
However, they fight ferociously whenever we are near, as hand-reared
birds will in competition for human attention. It would probably have
required several months of perseverance for them to accept new partners.
The infertile pair mentioned consist of the female reared by the late
Ray Kyme in 1974 and an imported male. The latter is a bird of rather
feminine appearance and I suspect that it is useless as a breeder. The
female will, in the future, be paired with the unrelated male reared in
1979. The third pair consists of two imported birds, the female of which
is a continuous layer. I lost count of the number of clutches she laid since
producing chicks in 1976 and had, in fact, given up inspecting her nest. It
was thus with some surprise that I heard a chick being fed on 29th April

1979. On inspecting the nest-box I found that it was at least eight days
old. As the danger period had passed and it looked well fed and healthy,
it was not removed - the first time they had been allowed to rear a chick
since they first hatched chicks in 1975 which died at an early age (but
during cold weather).
During the rearing period, consumption of nectar (much less than in
other lorikeets) dropped, and carrot was eaten avidly, as well as apple,
sunflower seed and spray millet, plus occasional pieces of dried fig of
which they are passionately fond. A fme male, the young bird left the
nest on 27th June. The parents seemed particularly attached to it, thus
it was not removed from their aviary until 2nd September.
The female laid again about one week later. A chick was heard on
6th October when it was about three days old. Lulled into a false sense
of security by their recent success, I decided to leave the chick with them.
After a couple of weeks they started to pluck it - a warning sign I should
not have ignored. Work was being carried out in the vicinity of their
aviary which was possibly the reason that it was found dead and mutilated
on 22nd October. The female again has eggs at the time of writing (26th
December).
The Iris is my favourite small lorikeet. From Timor, it is only very
rarely exported and I can only regret that aviculturists let the opportunity
to establish it slip through their fingers. At least 50 birds reached Britain
during 1972, and, to the best of my knowledge, only mine still survive.
My own breeding results have been far below those hoped for and can
only be described as poor.
The most reliable pair of lories in the collection are the Dusky Pseudeos
fuscata. This species has proved to be a consistent breeder since
it became available in 1972. Our pair have reared young each year since
1975 but young were reared in 1978 only after a lot of hard work on our
part. The 1977 youngster was left with its parents until 26th March and
a week later the adults were mating. The female's two eggs were laid
during the end of April and a chick was heard on 25th May. While the
peat in the nest was being changed on 29th July I noticed to my dismay
that one of the well-grown youngsters had the fungus Candida albicans
growing in its mouth. It was immediately removed from the nest for
treatment and hand-rearing. At this age it was, of course, very nervous
of our close presence, but it would have been extremely difficult to treat it
if left in the nest, because of the ferocity of the parents. We discovered
that the Candida was growing as the result of an injury which must have
been caused by the parents and that it had also lost part of one toe, pre-

sumably due to the same reason. The fungus infection was complet-
ely cured after a few days' treatment with Nystatin (Nystan - made by
Squibbs) ointment.
After two or three days "Brownie", as I called this lory, had lost its
fear of us. It weaned itself in a matter of minutes on 5th August and grew
up into a delightfully tame and affectionate bird. "Brownie" was so called
because its immature plumage was mainly brown with only small and dull
areas of orange, unlike the other young reared by this pair in which the
immature plumage had been much brighter.
The chick left with its parents appeared to be doing well so we were
shocked to find it dead on 6th August - at about the time it should have
left the nest. It had been heard calling strongly the day before and the
reason for its death could not be ascertained.
Probably because this chick did not live to leave the nest, the parents
nested again. A chick was heard on 20th September. Once again both eggs
hatched.Because of the lateness of the season and the fact that the female
Dusky ceases to brood her young during the day when they are about
two weeks old, we decided to remove the young for hand-rearing on 3rd
October. In very young lories the legs tend to splay out beneath them but
this is rectified as they grow. It soon became evident that something was
wrong with the left leg of the elder chick which was held at right angles
to the body. I spoke to a veterinary surgeon who is known for his interest
in unusual cases and he agreed to x-ray the chick.
It was then six weeks old and only partly feathered, thus it says much
for its constitution that it took the car journey to Huntingdon, several
sessions on the radiography table and even a light anaesthetic in its stride.
As anyone who has hand-reared lories will know, they keep up an almost
incessant plaintive cry. We were all amused by the fact that the last part
of it which ceased to function as it was gradually overcome by the anaes-
thetic was its voice!
Several x-rays were necessary before it was seen that the abnormal
angle of the leg was caused by a "greenstick" fracture , i.e. the break had
occurred at an extremely early age before the bones were brittle. It had
then set incorrectly. Our veterinary surgeon was not confident of its
chances of ever being able to perch normally. However, we were reluctant
to make an irrevocable decision until we knew for certain that nothing
could be done for it. To help the young lory to grip, welded mesh was
placed on the floor of the heated brooder cage; this appeared to have a
therapeutic effect, for by the time it was old enough to be removed to a
cage it could perch perfectly well. It is difficult to detect that anything

is wrong with the Dusky's leg except when it attempts to run on a flat
surface. Thus there is hope for a chick which suffers a leg fracture at a
very early age.
In 1979 the pair nested slightly earlier, despite the prolonged bitterly
cold weather. The first chicks were reared without incident, and left
the nest about 26th July. Because they were drenched in a heavy storm,
they were removed from the aviary (to be dried by infra-red lamp) on 8th
August and were not returned. Thus the female laid again two weeks later.
When she deserted the nest on 19th September, a dead newly hatched
chick was found and an egg in which the chick had pipped the shell and
died. This was the first time since the first chick was reared that they had
failed to rear their young. Rearing food consists of nectar, with wheat
germ cereal added, spray millet and occasionally, soft ripe pear.
Because the young spent a few weeks indoors they soon became tame.
Indeed, I am a firm believer in caging all young parrots for a few weeks
after removal from their parents. At this stage they usually become tame
quite quickly; thus their captive lives are free from the stress which can
be so damaging - and all too often fatal - to those birds which are afraid of
people.
After rearing two chicks in 1977, the Black Lories, Chalcopsitta atra
have not since been successful, much to my regret. Incidentally, the two
year old offspring, kept indoors, still has the white orbital skin of an
immature bird, proving that exposure to sunlight causes the skin to
darken.
In 1978 her mother laid on about 6th May without result. A second
clutch was laid about 28th June and a chick was heard on 30th and 31st
but had died by the following day. She laid again about three weeks later,
also without result. In 1979 an egg with pitted shell was found on the
aviary floor on 13th May, thus only one egg was incubated - unsuccess-
fully. The pair are so ferocious that nest-box inspection is very difficult.
Ideally the box should be mounted on the outside of the aviary.
A Red Lory Eos bomea purchased in December 1978 as a mate for a
lonely male, was the first female to lay in 1979. Her first egg was laid
about 2nd March. The nest was deserted on 1st April. She laid again one
month later and when the nest was inspected on 28th May two chicks,
covered in longish white down, were seen. They were estimated to be three
or four days old. However, although brooded conscientiously, they were
inadequately fed and died on 4th June.
The female laid again at the beginning of July. On July 27th chicks
were heard; nest inspection revealed two recently hatched chicks which

did not look strong. They were removed at once for hand-rearing. The
younger died in the early hours of the following morning. The survivor
was spoon-fed for 14 weeks and was by far the most difficult chick we
have ever hand-reared. Until it was four weeks old it habitually laid on its
back, thus continually took air into its crop which made it difficult to
feed. It was abnormally slow to learn to feed itself. As is typical of the
majority of immature Eos bornea it differed from the adults in having
well-defined blue ear-coverts.
Two Swainson's Lorikeets Trichoglossus haematodus moluccanus
obtained from separate sources, were put together in August 1979. They
were observed copulating in mid-November and the female laid shortly
after. She deserted clear eggs on 21st December.
It is notable that both the Swainson's and the Red Lory females laid
when the pairs had been together less than three months - and previously
all four birds had been deprived of mates. So often it seems that parrots
are eager to nest under such circumstances.
Finally, among the lories, a pair of Tahiti Blue Lories Vini peruviana in
our custody for US Customs/San Diego Zoo also attempted to breed. On
12th May 1979 the female laid from the perch - for a reason I failed to
understand since the pair spend so much time in their nest-box in an
indoor flight. She laid again during August; the single egg proved infertile.
It was slightly smaller in size than that of a Fairy Lorikeet. At the begin-
ning of November, two more eggs were laid. The incubation was note-
worthy for the fact that, as far as I could determine, it was carried out
entirely by the male. In the Charmosyna and perhaps in the other Vini
lories, incubation is shared by male and female - uniquely among lories in
which incubation only by the female is usual. In 1979 San Diego Zoo was
successful in rearing Tahiti Blue Lories, thus I hope that information will
shortly be available concerning the incubation habits of their pairs.
On 26th November I heard the sound of a chick being fed in the Blue
Lories' nest-box. Inspection revealed a dead chick, probably newly-
hatched, and a two day-old chick which was very much alive. Fearing that
it might not be fed adequately, I removed it from the nest early the
following morning and placed it in an incubator, set at 92*F (33*C).
Despite its extreme diminutiveness and minute bill, it fed readily from a
spoon (the teaspoon adapted for this purpose with sides turned inwards)
immediately. Because of the small capacity of its crop, it required feeding
at hourly intervals during the day, a task usually carried out by my hus-
band. Nightly, between 11 p.m. and 6 a.m. I fed it twice.
Initially, there were problems with its diet. Milk powder (high protein -

Casilan) caused small lumps to form in the crop (easily seen as the crop is
transparent in a very young chick) thus had to be discontinued. For this
reason, I did not give cereal, (for very young chicks wheat germ cereal is
usually reduced to a powder, using a grinder). The food offered consisted
of malt extract, apple and glucose, mixed with water in an electric blender.
On this the chick thrived for a week. It was strong, active and vocal. At
eight days the feather tracts were visible beneath the skin. The white down
was fluffy and its pink skin looked healthy. However, at ten days the chick
became difficult to feed. It took air into its crop and what appeared to be
air (but proved to be gas) could be seen through the transparent skin of
the abdomen. It grew increasingly difficult to feed and died at 12 days. Its
death was the major disappointment of the season.
Autopsy revealed no sign of disease and that it was apparently well
developed for its age. The fact that the yolk sac was not fully absorbed
indicated that nutritionally the diet was inadequate. However, there was
gas in the bowels, which probably caused its death. George Smith, who
performed the autopsy, suggested that this was due to lack of fibre in the
diet and I feel that he was correct in this conclusion.
Another instance of birds which have been deprived of partners nesting
soon after being introduced was demonstrated by my favourite small
parrots, the Salvadori's Fig Parrots Psittaculirostris salvadorii. After the
unfortunate death of the female, a replacement was not obtained until
29th September 1979, and then due to the generosity of George Smith.
Compatibility between the male and female was instant; the male was
overjoyed at again having a wife. He seemed to lose all interest in life while
on his own. The female laid a single egg four weeks later which was in-
fertile, although copulation had occurred, probably frequently. She laid
again during mid-December. The birds are housed in an indoor flight as we
are not prepared to allow them to face the vagaries of a British winter.
They are fed mainly on fruit, especially soaked dried figs, thus their
droppings have the loose consistency of a softbill. They also eat sunflower
seed. To breed this species is one of my dearest hopes.
Another pair of which I am particularly fond is the Slender-billed
Parrakeets, Enicognathus leptorhynchus. The female is the bird obtained
by the late Mrs Howard of Wolverhampton in or before 1965 and the male
is on loan from London Zoo. Unfortunately, the male copulates with the
perch and not with the female, thus the single clutches laid in 1978 and
1979 were infertile. To literally add injury to insult, the male enters the
nest and plays football with the eggs. The prospects of breeding from this
pair seem hopeless!
It was of interest that the Bronze-winged Parrot Pionus chalcopterus

hatched in the collection in 1976 laid in June and September, paired to an
imported male. The eggs were infertile.
The Amazon parrots were a major source of disappointment, especially
in 1979 when 20 eggs were laid and no chicks hatched! However, I do not
lack patience and know that it can be some years before certain pairs
prove fertile. The six Cayman Parrots Amazona leucocephala caymanensis ,
which my husband and I brought back from the Island of Grand Cayman
in 1975, consist of two true pairs and two others which are probably
males. In 1978 one female laid at the end of May and deserted four in-
fertile eggs on 30th June. The female of the second pair laid about 40 days
later and deserted infertile eggs on 8th July.
In 1979 laying was slightly earlier. One female deserted five infertile
eggs on 21st June and the other left two clear eggs two days later.
Considering how cold were the months of May and the preceding
months in both years, and that the Caymans' tolerance to low temper-
atures is less than that of all the other large parrots in the collection, it
is perhaps not surprising that the eggs are infertile; it seems unlikely
that the birds would be in full breeding condition by May. Climatically,
May of 1979 was more peculiar than usual. On 4th May there was snow,
sleet and hail. Only nine days later I recorded in my diary that the temp-
erature was 77*F (25*C) - a heatwave of the briefest possible duration.
The Yellow-shouldered Amazon known as "Icky", Amazona barba -
densis laid for the second year during the third week of May 1978, and
at about the same time during 1979. Neither clutches hatched - or if
they did, the chicks died early. Inspecting the nest is impossible with this
exceptionally ferocious pair.
In 1979 eggs were obtained from a second female barbadensis , "Susie".
The pair had been together for less than a year. Her three eggs were laid
at peculiar intervals over a ten-day period - on 11th, 17th and 21st of May.
On the morning of the 21 st she was seen sitting unhappily in the entrance
of the nest barrel. She was carefully wrapped in a towel and taken indoors
and placed in the heat of an infra-red lamp. After a few hours she seemed
completely recovered and surprised me at 10 p.m. by laying a third egg.
Not at all the classic symptoms of egg-binding! She was kept indoors
for a few days. The eggs were placed in an incubator and proved infertile.
A second clutch was not laid although the male fed her and nest inspection
occurred.
As Amazons usually lay in May and fall into a moult not long after
ceasing incubation of infertile clutches, in future eggs will be checked for
fertility after a few days and removed if infertile. Hopefully, replacement
clutches will result which have a better chance of being fertile.

R. LOW - BREEDING RESULTS 1978-1979
For the first time we had eggs from Double Yellow-headed Amazons
Amazona ochrocephala oratrix. The pair was reunited in the autumn after
being separated for nearly two years. I regret to say that we had caged the
female on her own for this length of time and placed what was almost
certainly a second male with her mate! I fmd this species very difficult
to sex. Their joy at being reunited in the autumn of 1978 was wonderful
to see and something that I captured on cinefilm. There was much dis-
playing and chortling and the male invited the female to inspect the nest
barrel.
It may have been the separation that stimulated the female to lay in
April. The two eggs did not hatch. She laid again in June and deserted
the addled eggs on 23 rd July.
Throughout both periods both birds were in the nest simultaneously
so that I began to wonder if again I was wrong and they were two hens,
not two males as I had originally thought.
An unexpected success was the rearing of a Grey Parrot Psittacus
erithacus. The pair had been together since 1973 when the female "chose"
the male as soon as he was placed in a colony aviary of five birds. In the
following year she laid fertile eggs. She laid annually until 1976 but
made no attempt to breed in 1977 and 1978.
It seemed that drastic action was needed, thus in the spring of 1979 the
pair was moved. From a large, secluded aviary they were placed in a smal-
ler one measuring about 9ft. (2.7m) long, 3ft (90cm) wide and 6ft (1.8m)
high. The situation seemed quite unsuitable - alongside a busy path and
overlooked by the climbing frame of the children next door. However,
this was apparently very much to the birds' liking for they went to nest
almost at once.
The female laid at the end of May but she sat so tightly I never dis-
covered how many eggs formed the clutch. On 30th June the behaviour
of the male led me to suspect that a chick had hatched. Nest inspection
was not very revealing as the hen would not move. When the chick was
large enough to be left unattended for a short while she would return to
the nest at quite incredible speed the moment I touched the aviary door.
On 25th July I had my first good look at the young bird - covered in
woolly grey down and standing upright.
The rearing of the chick progressed completely without incident.
On 6th September it was seen looking out of the nest and after a week
would sit in the nest entrance. The male would spend long periods sitting
on the nest-box perch, usually with an item of food in his foot, such as
a piece of apple of millet spray. Evidently he was teaching the young

bird how to feed, for I observed it feeding for itself on its first day out of
the nest - 26th September.
During the three weeks it had spent looking out of the nest-box it lost
its shyness and ceased to growl when subjected to a steady scrutiny.
Two weeks after leaving the nest it was quite unafraid and moved about
the aviary in a confident manner. Its plumage then differed from the
adults' in the more silvery shade and in the brownish-red tip to the tail.
The latter feature, together with the dark grey instead of yellow iris, is
characteristic of all immature Grey Parrots.
Every night it returned to the nest to roost with its parents until
removed from the aviary on 21st October. An interesting aspect of this
breeding was the rearing food, which was not what I would consider
ideal. The male was a conservative feeder, taking only seed, fruit and other
sweet items. Sunflower seed offered was therefore soaked in water for
24 hours (then well washed) to increase its digestibility. To ensure that
the chick did not suffer a calcium deficiency resulting in rickets, the
banana which the male ate with enthusiasm was lightly dipped in bone
meal. For the first two or three weeks after hatching I provided sponge
cake and wheat germ soaked in nectar with vitamin drops added. This
had to be discontinued when the wasps put in their usual appearance in
August as it resulted in the Grey's food diSh swarming with them.
Finally, our faithful pair of Eclectus Parrots Eclectus roratus (the
female of the sub-species vosmaeri ) reared some excellent youngsters. In
1978 two chicks were hatched during the last week of June, the first
being seen on the 26th. By 20th July the green tips to the mantle feathers
proclaimed that, as usual, it was a male, as was the second chick. They
left the nest on 12th and 22nd September. The female laid again during
the last week in October. The first chick hatched on 22nd November
and the second on the 26th. By then the weather was freezing and
snow fell during the following week. Before the young birds were four
weeks old I was elated to discover that both were females - the first raised
by this pair after what seemd to be an endless succession of males (ten in
fact).
The male is mainly responsible for feeding the young and, hitherto, had
always made an excellent job of this. However, on 30th December the
young were heard crying continuously for food and the female left the
nest more frequently than usual and seemed restless. Next day the male
appeared to have lost all interest in feeding them. It was as though his
instinct warned him of the long weeks of severe weather ahead which
commenced that day.

When the female left the nest at midday the young were inspected; the
smaller had an empty crop, the larger but little food. Under normal
circumstances their crops would resemble little bulging sacks. We decided
to remove them at once - and the female dive-bombed me as I carried
them out of the aviary - but thereafter neither bird gave any outward
sign of missing their young.
The younger chick was so hungry that she opened her bill and allowed
me to literally pour down the food. This was a relief as well developed
chicks could have proved difficult to feed. I was interested to note the
weak pumping action of this species when being fed. It is quite unlike that
of the lories and cockatoos, for example, in which even a small chick can
almost knock the spoon out of one's hand with its strong pumping action.
The food used for the Eclectus chicks was made fresh daily using a
small electric blender. Eclectus have a great need for vegetable matter,
thus this accounted for about one third of the food. Apple, carrot, and
corn on the cob (frozen, then thawed) were placed in the blender with
approximately equal parts of Casilan milk powder (92% protein), skimmed
milk powder, wheat germ cereal and sunflower seed kernels. A small
amount of bone meal was added to ensure that the calcium content was
adequate. Water was then added and the mixture blended to a porridge-
like consistency.
When the chicks had been removed from the nest there was such a
large discrepancy in their size it was obvious that the younger had not
been receiving her fair share of food. They weighed 11 oz. and 8 l A oz.
The plumage of the younger showed signs of malnutrition; hunger traces
(horizontal lines) across some feathers, and abnormal coloration. Her
head was orange, not red, and the feathers of her back were bronze and
green, not red and green as in her sister. The last feathers to appear, those
on the throat, were of the correct colour, an indication that the nutritional
problem had been rectified by hand-feeding. They rapidly gained weight
and, ten days after being removed from the nest, they weighed 13 oz. and
10 oz. After three weeks they started to eat sunflower kernels. The next
step was to offer cracked sunflower seed, apple and pomegranate, all of
which they consumed readily.
As they took more of these foods they became increasingly difficult
to feed. The elder youngster would take a couple of spoonfuls of pre-
pared food and run back to the cage (standing on the table on which they
were fed). Or she would shake her head and attack the spoon. The younger
was far less dependent and strong-willed. By the time they were three
months old they were very independent, but they lacked the affectionate

nature which makes many hand-reared parrots exceptionally appealing.
As I had expected, the head colour of the younger chick moulted
out to the normal shade of red. At the time of writing she is 13 months
pld and has retained some of the bronze wing feathers.
In 1979 the Eclectus did not lay until 27th June. This was due to the
fact that several months earlier the male had to be anaesthetised to have
Ms abnomially thick, overgrown beak trimmed. He reacted badly to the
anaesthetic and did not regain breeding condition for several months.
The female hatched a chick on 27th July. Possibly because the male's
beak had again become overgrown, the female took almost sole care of
this chick until it was old enough to climb to the nest entrance, where it
was fed by the male. It was a female and left the nest on 9th October -
the shortest fledging period recorded in our Eclectus.
The male's beak had to be attended to again. As another anaesthetic
was out of the question and the bird is so tame that handling causes
him no stress, we did this ourselves. I held him while my husband removed
the overgrown part of the beak using a small hacksaw. This took about
five seconds! The female laid the first egg of her next clutch of two on
24th November. However, they failed to hatch.
Undoubtedly the event that gave us most pleasure in 1979 was the
hand-rearing of two Coffin's Cockatoos. This I have described in a separate
article.
It was pleasing to note that in 1979 we had eggs from almost every
female housed outdoors with a male. The only exceptions were a Roseate
Cockatoo paired to a male with an inoperable lipoma, and the Goldie's
Lorikeets.

This article is not intended to convey the idea that we are trying to
put forth the ultimate in avicultural husbandry. That would be too great
a claim for even the best aviculturist to make because each genus of
psittacines would require a life-time of study and experience even to
begin to understand the parrots' particular wants and needs. Because of
our success in breeding Amazon parrots, and due to the many requests
we annually receive for information on this subject, we of the New Age
Ranch (Life Fellowship) want to share some facts and theories that may
prove beneficial to the beginner.
Selecting the Amazon parrot that you wish to breed
Today's aspiring aviculturist is fortunate in having a large stock of
imports to choose from for potential breeders. A few years ago we would
pick up a lone long term cage pet and hope to find another of the opposite
sex and then spend two or three years getting them into breeding condi-
tion. When introduced we were faced with the problem of whether they
would be compatible or not. Just putting two Amazons together that
are of the opposite sex does not always result in a breeding. There was no
surgical sexing or the other more sophisticated means of sexing available.
The would-be breeder had to trust in his or her ability to sex by sight.
When one considers such difficulties still existed even fifteen years ago,
we can well be amazed by the breeding successes accomplished.
Many people today have beginner's luck right from the start and breed
a species that yesterday was considered difficult or impossible. Because of
these initial achievements some individuals become overnight authorities.
After some bitter disappointments, however, they will usually go on to
become seasoned aviculturists and appreciate just how difficult it really is.
Years ago it was argued that a tame Amazon did not make a good
breeder. This is not always true. I have known only of one such pet
that had been so humanised that it refused to pair off. Most of our breed-
ers were long-term cage pets being for the most part past twenty years
of age when we received them. They were often feather pickers which is
usually a good indication that they are sexually frustrated and ready to
breed. Sometimes they required two to four seasons to get the hang of
parenthood. Having been used to people they didn't exhibit the skittish-

ness so common among wild adult imports. It must be remembered
that Amazons, unlike other psittacines, generally lay only one clutch
each season, so if the eggs prove infertile the aviculturist is faced with
waiting until the next year to try again. This may discourage some who are
used to psittacines that produce three or more clutches a year. Parakeets,
conures, cockatiels, cockatoos, African Grey Parrots, macaws, Eclectus
and Hawkheads breed the year round if conditions are right. Our pair of
Hawkheads gave us nine chicks in one year. When you consider their
average clutch to be only two eggs and at the most three you can well
appreciate their effort. Our pair of Eclectus breed every two months and
give us two eggs each time; both are always fertile. Our breeding Jendayas
average five to six clutches a year. Such birds more than earn their keep
and help to pay for the time and effort we must spend on the more
unpredictable Amazons.
In the wild juvenile Amazons go through the mating ritual each season
just as the adults do. In this way "pair bonds" are accomplished. We have
had year-old Amazons copulate and go through all the stages adult breed-
ers display. Some hens will even lay when as young as two years of age.
The eggs are always small, reminding one of the small eggs produced
by pullets in chickens. We have never had or known of successful ferti-
lization of eggs until the hen was four years of age and this has always
been with an older cock. I think it would be safe to say that in Amazons
both hen and cock should be at least five years of age before actual
breeding is accomplished. I am perfectly aware there are always exceptions
to any rule but we are speaking of parrots whose history was known, i.e.,
they were hatched in captivity or were imports still being hand fed and
their exact ages could not be questioned. Often those who hint at an
earlier age of breeding in reality do not know the true ages of the Amazons
involved and have merely taken someone's word for it. Because of this
initial five year requirement it is always best to start out with adult birds if
possible.
Like people, certain Amazons are quite fussy about their partners.
On the other hand we must debunk some of the false ideas that have been
fostered regarding pair bonds. Where one is faced with the problem of
having one hen and three males of a particularly rare species it is advisable
to mate her with a different cock each year to ensure a better blood stock.
We have accomplished this with certain leucocephala and we never had a
problem. One season after removing a fresh-laid clutch from one hen, we
removed the cock and introduced another which the breeding hen immedi-
ately paired with and went back to nest producing fertile eggs. This was

accomplished partly because the hen in question nested early in April. Her
first eggs were taken as soon as the full clutch was laid. She settled down
with the new cock which was already proven from last year with another
hen. Her second clutch m^as deposited in the middle of June. By such
procedure new blood lines can be built up even when a shortage of a
certain sex is prevalent in a collection. We have over twelve Cayman Island
Amazons A. L caymanensis which have the same mother but three unre-
lated fathers. By keeping track of the birds each year we can offer relati-
vely unrelated birds to other offspring from other breeding pairs we have.
We are all too often amused when reading many of the advertisements
that appear in various avicultural journals which give a list of "Breeding
pairs 5 ', "Mated pairs" or "Proven pairs". Such advertisements are calcu-
lated to sell birds which are often not even true pairs. In reality very few
proven breeders are ever advertised. They are, generally, too well known
and when offered for sale will be quickly snapped up by those knowing
their value. Any aviculturist with even a little knowledge is aware of the
fact that many birds appear to pair off but will never breed. Nest mates
often prove to be of the same sex and some adults that pair off are later
found to be of the same sex. These facts are especially true of Amazons.
Even copulation or attempts at copulation may be observed among such
birds, giving the novice the impression he has a true pair. Therefore,
ascertaining the exact sex of the specimens being introduced will be help-
ful. It is suggested that at least two pairs (sexed) be placed together in
a large aviary and thereby allowing the parrots themselves to pick out
their own mates. The introduction of a nest box early in spring will
usually trigger the choosing and one must be ever alert to the danger
such pairing often brings. The true, or more correctly, the mated pair
will turn on the others and serious injury or even death will occur if the
unwanted birds are not removed. These are placed in another aviary with
a nest box and though rejected by the others will often prove themselves.
If not, then seek two more individuals (also sexed) and begin again. In
this way you may be fortunate enough in gaining three mated pairs that
will eventually breed for you, making all your efforts well worthwhile.

Remember Amazons are not colony breeders and will fearlessly defend to
the death their nesting area. How quickly have we seen docile pets become
vicious, biting demons when pairing off takes place.
How to encourage breeding
Contrary to past information we have found that it helps to have sev-
eral breeding pairs of Amazons in the same general area or within hearing
distance of each other. Such an arrangement often stimulates nesting pro-
cedures. Some Amazons like many other birds and animals have to be
taught or incited to breed. When robbed as babies from the nest, such
Amazons miss the privelege of growing up in a family group where much
necessary training is accomplished. In the wild we have observed juvenile
Amazons still with their parents when the next breeding season com-
menced. The adult cock would go through his courtship display and feed
the hen while last year's brood looked on apparently quite fascinated by
their parent's actions. Such observation no doubt gives the young a last-
ing impression. In captivity this can be easily simulated by placing young
Amazons in aviaries within sight of proven breeders. When the adults
begin to be excited and make their peculiar mating chortlings the nearby
young are visibly stirred by this ritual and seek to imitate the display and
cries of the elders. Nature has so instilled this into them that even hand-
reared young readily respond. The best way then to get results is from
association in a controlled environment with proven pairs when available.
At Life Fellowship (New Age Ranch) we accomplish this by what we
call the "hotel" method. The "hotel" is a long aviary type cage which is
divided into four or five compartments each of which is 3' x 3' x 3' in
size. The dividing wire is W&apos; x 1" to prevent any parrot from doing any
serious damage to his next door neighbour. The "hotel" is then situated
so that an Amazon in any compartment may easily see what is going on
in the proven breeding pair's aviary. Young birds from a year on up to
breeding age are placed individually in each compartment. When the
adult proven pair begins the ritual the young birds become noticeably
excited and they will often attempt to feed their adjoining partners if
one proves to be a hen. If two cocks are side by side they will begin to
spar with each other through the fine mesh wire that separates them.
This procedure is merely to condition the youngsters for the two years
ahead. We seldom allow two birds that have formed a pair bond to be
caged together until four years of age as, while in some cases this is not
dangerous, in others it may result in serious injury or even death to the
hen. In the wild such vicious advances by an adolescent cock can be es-

caped by the hen simply flying away. In confinement this is not possible
and often a young hen will be badly beaten or killed. Injuries thus sus-
tained may cause a timidity in the hen which later can interfere with
actual copulation taking place. Be patient and wait; you may well save
yourself and the parrots a bitter experience. Breeding season for Amazons
in North America and Great Britain is the spring and early summer, and
is more or less determined by warmth and length of days or light. Proper
conditions have been artificially simulated indoors. Your locality and
climate will therefore determine the proper breeding season for your
Amazons. Here in central Florida the earliest we have had an Amazon
breed was in April. In most instances nesting is in May or June and even
as late as July but the latter is the exception. Since most of our psitta-
cine area is in our Florida rain forest the shade factor plays an important
part. Aviaries in the more open sun induce the Amazons to breed earlier
than those in the more shaded locations. Strange to relate Yellow-naped
Amazons in Central America commence breeding in December and Jan-
uary in places like Honduras, February in Nicaragua and March in Costa
Rica. In the northern Caribbean islands the breeding season corresponds
with ours in central Florida. The early nesting season in Central America
allows the parrot hunters to harvest young Amazons and usually results
in the parents nesting again. This early nesting period is probably trigg-
ered by low pressure areas that are the result of cold fronts moving down
the land mass from North America but which would not have the same
influence on islands in the Caribbean. I am sure the "experts" will come
up with a more feasible explanation regardless of its validity.
The aviary and nest-box
Each set up is different and many aviculturists go to great lengths to
justify their approach in this matter and often force their method upon
others, but what works for one will not necessarily work for another.
Years ago English and European aviculturists emphasised large aviaries as
essential for captive breeding. Many newcomers, upon reading these works
of yesterday, immediately set out to do the same not realizing that many
advances in knowledge have been made in the past thirty years where
this subject is concerned. The results have been that many potentially
capable aviculturists have been discouraged from attempting to breed
larger psittacines because of the cost and space such large aviaries require.
Today more realistic and practical aviaries are being constructed, with
more predictable successes being scored in breeding. It was my happy
privelege to know the late Mrs E. L. Moon of Miami for the last 12 years

of her life. This grand old lady of aviculture bred many different exotic
birds and produced or developed the white Cockatiel which she lovingly
referred to as her "moonbeams". She was in love with her birds and
consequently they bred for her under the most questionable conditions
imaginable. When I first met Mrs Moon she must have been in her late
sixties. I was astounded to see that her aviaries consisted of stacked cages
three and four high from the floor to the ceiling of the small room adjoin-
ing her house. Tin was placed between each layer to keep the droppings
off the fellows below. Each cage was roughly 3' x 3' x 6'. The room for
the most part was rather dark, being lighted only by some small dirty
windows and a sixty watt bulb or two overhead. In such a set up Mrs
Moon bred African Greys, cockatoos, macaws, Amazons, Cockatiels,
parakeets and, I believe, some lorikeets as well. In addition to sunflower
seeds and greens she fed all her psittacines some unsavoury looking mess
that reminded me of slop being fed to pigs. I have always regretted having
not ascertained its composition. At the time I was still too brain-washed
by what I had read to be open-minded enough to learn. Consequently I
was rather critical of this grand old lady's achievements. As the years of
experience have since taught me better I have grown to greatly admire Mrs
Moon.
This all leaves us with the question: what is really necessary for breed-
ing and sustaining healthy parrots. Obviously the attitude of the avicult-
urist plays an immense role in the happiness and well-being of the birds.
We have seen parrots bred in very limited quarters while still others with
thirty foot long aviaries and vast avian medical knowledge have miserably
failed to breed even the most simple and commonly bred psittacines. The
rare exception to this rule is a veterinarian in Miami who owns and
operates one of the largest pet supplies in the U.S. This rare accredited
importer has achieved several first breedings but has steadfastly refused to
apply for the first breeding award. His attitude is that the accomplishment
was reward enough. Such a humble and dedicated attitude is so uncom-
mon among today's aviculturists that I think it should be noted here even
though he prefers his name not to be mentioned. However, such a person
is an exception and certainly not the norm. We all tend to put recognition
ahead of the better goals of accomplishment.
The obvious conclusion is that a parrot in breeding condition, i.e. not
too fat, sexually mature, nutritionally balanced, well exercised and happy
will breed in a small aviary and will do so year after year producing perf-
ectly healthy young. Too many people fail to take into consideration the
law of evolution which grants adaptation to all creatures. It is not incon-

ceivable to envisage parrots or for that matter any bird or animal adjusting
to captive conditions just as the Budgerigar, Cockatiel and domestic fowl
have so readily done. We have dared some far outlandish programmes here
at Life Fellowship and have, by our success, proved they can be practical
and that Nature is willing to work with us so long as none of her laws are
violated. Others in less favourable climates than ours have achieved similar
success when they have sought to work with Nature. By this it becomes
more and more evident that the solution to successful captive breeding lies
within the realm of the aviculturisf s sensitivity toward his charges rather
than in prejudiced and preconceived ideas which limit his vision and
thwart the satisfaction aviculture could be gratifying him with.
Today when asked by closed-minded sceptical visitors how we succeed
I simply reply "we listen to the parrots and give them what they want
rather than what others think they should have".
Most captive Amazons are relatively content in their aviaries and if
they escape they will usually return for food, protection and for roost-
ing. This is a good indication that the parrot is happy with its surroun-
ings. When we can get past the impractical dream of rare and endangered
species remaining safe in their natural habitat and accept the more realistic
and positive attitude that the only lasting means of survival will eventually
be through captive breeding, we can get on with the project. The limited
land area of many endangered Amazons - such as the Caribbean islands -
makes it imperative that we breed these parrots in captivity. It is doubtful
whether, with the present development of these islands and other Central
and South American countries, many species will last another 20 years.
There is a concerted effort on Grand Cayman Island to exterminate its
native Amazon A. I caymanensis. On Cayman Brae A. I hesterna has
never been overly plentiful and current development will finish off the
native parrot. These are just a couple of cases and others just as similar
are known such as the native Amazon parrots of the Isle of Pines, St.
Vincent, St. Lucia, Dominica, etc.
Today, many Amazon and conure escapees are readily breeding and
even producing hybrids in the Miami area. It is not uncommon to see 10
to 20 Double Yellow-heads, Mexican Red-heads, Finsch's and Yellow-
napes even in the more inhabited areas such as Miami Beach. These parrots
prove the parrot can easily adapt to city living. If this continues we may
well see Amazons and other psittacines established in Florida, California
and Texas, not to mention the Quaker Parrakeets already well established
in New York.
But this is digressing from the topics of aviary and nest box. Ten

years ago in 1969 we decided to change our style of aviaries from the
traditional walk in type to aviaries suspended about four feet off the
ground. This new approach ended parasites in the collection, afforded
better protection from predators and ants, cut down on the needless
disturbance of the birds which walk-in aviaries produce. This arrangement
allows both disregarded food and droppings to pass through the wire and
out of the reach of the parrots. The nest box is attached to the outside
of the aviary which facilitates easy inspection with a minimum of bother
to the parents.
This type of aviary is less expensive, easier to keep clean and produces
a more pyschologically secure effect on the parrots. They soon learn that
a person cannot get to them and even the most nervous specimens will
soon calm down. We construct our aviaries with welded wire and "C"
clips. The average size is usually three feet wide by three to four feet high
and twelve to sixteen feet long. This is ample size for most Amazons and
similar-sized parrots i.e., African Grey, Eclectus, Hawkhead, etc. The
sides and top are 1" x 2" or 1" x 1" and the bottom is x 1" wire. This
smaller wire for the bottom affords a better footing for the parrots. These
aviaries can be suspended on iron pipe frames or on wooden cross beams.
This makes the aviary portable and easy to rake under. Wood perches
are placed at each end. Here we purchase 1" x 1" farming stakes four
feet long and made of cypress. They can usually be purchased from a
farm supply and are used for staking tomatoes. These are relatively in-
expensive when purchased in large bundles. The parrots love to chew
them to pieces. The large pieces left over remain on the bottom of the
aviary and the parrots continue to whittle them away to nothing. This
not only keeps their beaks trim but gives them something to play with
and thereby not become bored with confinement. Green branches of
various trees are also excellent for the purpose but if the aviculturist
has a large collection, a continual supply of branches is not always easy
to come by.
Square perches make copulation easier and give the parrots a chance
to relax while on the perch rather than constantly having to grip a round
perch to keep from falling. I abhore the use of iron or plastic pipe for
perches. The unfortunate birds have to continually be on guard to keep
from slipping off the perch. While such pipe lasts indefinitely, its use
certainly shows little consideration on the part of the aviculturist for his
birds. For many years we cut branches from the hardwoods that comprise
our rain forest here on the Ranch. The bark would soon be peeled off
but the hickory, magnolia and oak wood would take some time to be

whittled away. In the meantime such perches became quite soiled by the
parrot's feet after they had held a piece of fruit or some other form of
soft food stuff. This residue would then tend to build up to a grime which
the parrots were constantly coming in contact with each time they took
hold of the perch with their beaks. Therefore the easily demolished
square perch made of clean freshly milled wood not only provides a
better resting place for the parrot's feet but a cleaner, less bacteria-ridden
perch. Dont wory about the sharp edges on the square perch as they are
usually smoothed off by the parrots on the first day.
The nest box for most Amazons of medium size should be 12" x 16"
x 24". The depth should be more for the larger Amazons and an increase
in width of two to four inches is advisable. Here we use %" plyboard. For
the smaller, less destructive Amazons we place only a piece of 1" x 2"
welded wire down from the entrance to give the birds something to climb
on to the nest area. For the larger, more destructive Amazons we line the
entire inner part of the box with 1" x 1" wire. The entrance consists of
a square hole cut out at the very top of the box and measures about four
to five inches square. In this way the top piece of plyboard is the lintel
of the entrance and there is not the waste of several inches of space above
the entrance that the conventional round holed nest box gives. Square
holes are more easily wired to keep the entrance way from being chewed
to pieces. About eight inches from the bottom and on the back side of
the box we cut a doorway about six to eight inches square. On the inside
we place welded wire and make another smaller wire door that opens
outward as does the wooden door. This gives double protection when in-
specting the nest box. It is best to first lure the hen from the box which
is seldom difficult with Amazons. A piece of flat tin is then inserted bet-
ween the wire of the aviary and the nest box's entrance so neither bird
can gain entrance to the box. In this way you can candle the eggs after
they are seven days old to see which ones are fertile. We usually mark
the eggs as they are laid so we know the exact date when they should
hatch. 28 days are required for all Amazon eggs. If the clutch proves in-
fertile, we remove them which will generally result in the pair nesting
again. Sometimes the second clutch will prove fertile. Always remove
any infertile egg from a clutch as they only take up space and may break
and spoil the rest. Oddly enough however, Amazon eggs after being
incubated for 28 days though infertile are almost always as fresh in app-
earance when broken open as newly laid ones.
The nest box is wired to the aviary and often rests on a post embedded
in the ground. This gives the heavy nest box more support and keeps down

movement which would occur if attached only to the suspended aviary.
The nest box is filled to a depth of about six to eight inches with clean
wood shavings such as cedar. Large bags of this type wood shavings can
usually be bought through pet supplies. We prefer cedar because it helps
repel various ants and insects. Sometimes "Seven Dust" is sprinkled
over the bottom of the box before the shavings are placed in it. Tobacco
dust in the form of snuff will also serve the same purpose and is quite
safe and highly effective against mites, cockroaches and ants. If the nesting
material is not too soiled at the end of the breeding season we allow it
to remain in the box and as the next season approaches a 3" layer of
fresh shavings is placed over the old. Here in Florida we have such high
humidity that we never need to moisten the nest material, unless it is
extremely dry just before the eggs are to hatch. We then spray water
directly into the nest box daily in the form of a light fine spray from the
hose. This simulates rain which is quite often blown into nest cavities
in the Amazons' wild habitat. If carefully done this seldom disturbs the
hen and she simply remains tight on the nest. Such a daily spray keeps a
high humidity in the nest box but does not make the material wet. Since
we often spray our Amazons when there is a dry spell we also take this
opportunity to spray them when they are off the nest in the heat of the
day. The hen will usually bathe herself enough in this way to carry con-
siderable moisture back into the box and thus to the eggs. We have found
that in most cases it is not uncommon for the cock to enter the nest
box regularly with the hen. This is another good reason for having a large
enough nest box to accomodate the presence of the cock also. When
the chicks hatch the cock will in most cases assist in the chore of teeding.
This is especially true in the leucocephala group (Cubans, Caymans, His-
paniolans) and in the Spectacle. We have noticed a marked tendency in
the father-feeding aspect with our captive-bred Amazons, more so than
with the long term caged ones which undoubtedly shows that the longer
a parrot is away from some of its natural instincts the less the possibility
of reverting back to what is no doubt a normal practice in the wild or
with four or five year-old cocks.
Feeding practices
Although we try to get the parrots to eat the most nutritious and
widest range of foods possible, some birds just refuse to cooperate but
still annually breed and produce strong young on a very limited sunflower
seed type diet. As already stated most of our breeders were long-term
caged pets and, with the exception of some fruit and vegetables, refuse

other types of food. In the past we used to place vitamin drops in the
birds' water but we soon realized the intake was negligible and therefore
developed a mixture which is readily accepted by most parrots. In a
blender we add hot water about one third full; to this is added a cup of
raw shelled peanuts, a teaspoon of powdered dolomite or calcium lactate
or cuttle bone - we vary it daily to ensure variety; then three spoonfuls of
powdered milk, a teaspoon of wheat germ oil or cod liver oil or two 400
I.U. vitamin E capsules, a teaspoon of brewer's yeast or potent yeast
which contains many added vitamins and minerals not found in plain
brewer's yeast. Raw wheat germ may be added to thicken the mixture
after it is well blended. We also add about two cc.s of orange-flavoured
liquid vitamins. Care should be taken not to overload the mixture so that
the peanut taste is lost or the birds may refuse it. This mixture is then
heated in a pot until almost hot. Constant stirring is necessary to prevent
sticking. The mixture is then poured out into a preheated thick baking or
mixing bowl to sustain the heat of the mixture. A spoonful is given to each
aviary of a pair of birds, a half-spoonful to one bird. In this way you will
be giving more nutrition to your bird than it would gain in a week's
average feed. This mixture is greedily eaten by most Amazons.
Sometimes we use raw carrot and beet juice in place of the water used
in the blender. This necessitates a juicer as well as a blender. When raw
juice is used care should be taken not to overheat the mixture.
To give variety in the above mentioned mixture we beat four to five
eggs and scramble fry until well done. They are added to the blender with
two or three slices of whole grain bread, powdered milk and hot water.
Once well-blended, the mixture is removed and we add vitamins, minerals,
calcium and wheat germ oil, all of which is well mixed in the bowl. In
order to thicken the mixture simply add raw wheat germ or another slice
or two of whole grain bread. This makes a delicious and desirable mixture
for your parrots which gives them much needed protein, lecithin and lime
in addition to all the other nutritious ingredients. It makes an excellent
supplement for parents feeding chicks and can safely be used in hand-
feeding chicks so long as it is brought to a more liquid state by adding
water. It can be refrigerated and portions warmed up at hand-feeding time.
In Central America the natives use "masa" to successfully raise thou-
sands of baby Amazons destined each year for the U.S., England and
Europe. Masa is composed mostly of corn meal and bananas with some
vitamins added. This mixture is well cooked and fed to the chicks in a very
soupy form. It is allowed to cool until warm and then literally poured
down the babies from a can that had been bent to form a spout. Generally

children and old ladies are used to feeding up to four hundred of these
babies at a time. Upon seeing such a performance one comes away feeling
rather foolish for all the painstaking efforts we go through here in the
States to rear a dozen Amazon chicks. We think of handrearing as a rela-
tively new practice and forget that Central and South American Indians
as well as those on the Caribbean islands practiced handfeeding baby
psittacines centuries before the arrival of the first European. They are
naturals at the art and clearly understand things about parrots we are
just now finding out; such as what to feed the chicks on to produce more
colour, etc. We hope to spend about three months among these Indians
learning some of their ancient techniques for rearing parrots.
Fostering
If you have rare and endangered species that may well depend on
captive breeding for survival, it will be to your advantage to learn some-
thing of fostering. This is accomplished by simply removing the eggs as
they are laid and placing them under a dependable foster parent bird. Here
we use Jendayas and other Amazons that are nesting at the time. Some-
times we substitute artificial eggs for those we remove to cause the hen to
continue to lay out her clutch in the nest rather than face the chance of
her quitting the nest as her eggs begin to disappear. When the hen has
finished her clutch the artificial eggs are removed and in about three weeks
she will usually go back to nest. This clutch we allow her to keep and
hatch. In this way you may be fortunate in obtaining twice the number of
chicks you would have ordinarily hatched. It can be a tricky business,
however, and one must really know the birds to use as foster parents. We
never place more than one egg from small-sized Amazons with the Jen-
daya's own clutch. This has to be done when the Jendaya pair lays its first
egg as the Amazon egg will hatch four or five days after the Jendaya's
begin to hatch. Sun Conure eggs are almost identical in size to the smaller
type Amazons such as Spectacle, Cuban, Cayman, Hispaniolan, Finsch's,
Mexican Red-heads, etc. Most aviculturists would not want to risk the loss
of a Sun Conure clutch for the sake of fostering. We also use old Amazon
hens which refuse copulation and therefore their eggs are infertile. These
are replaced with the desired fertile eggs and as a rule both foster mother
and father are just as judicious in caring for the chicks as if they had been
their own. This gives the chicks a chance to be cared for in a real nest
environment rather than an incubator. It also gets the chick past the first
five days which is the most crucial period of its life and we are convinced
it gives them a better start in life than by artificially rearing them.

We have had six eggs fostered at one time by an old Cuban hen which
we affectionately call "the old Maid Cuban". She has had many partners
over the years but steadfastly rejects copulation. The last three seasons
we have placed four year-old cocks with her which she subjects and
permits them to feed her and to help in the rearing of chicks. At any rate
the above mentioned six eggs consisted of two from A. ventralis , one from
A. I caymanensis and three from A. I palmarum. All were successfully
hatched and removed from the nest when about six days old. Overjoyed
with her accomplishment this old lady went back to her nest and laid
three more infertile eggs to which we added one A. I caymanensis egg.
This she hatched and was allowed to rear the chick until it had pen fea-
thers. If you ever visited Key West in the fifties and early sixties you no
doubt saw this Cuban Amazon in her cage in front of the old Anchor
Bar on Duval Street. It is best to practice fostering initially with less
rare species and thereby learn your prospective foster parent's attitude.

Finally, parrots, like people, enjoy variety. We regularly move proven
breeders from one location to another during the winter. This gives them a
chance to adjust to their new surroundings prior to the spring breeding
season. Many of our visitors are horrified at this procedure and argue
that it disturbs the parrots and will interfere with their breeding next
season, but we have found it to be just the opposite. Since our aviaries
are portable, a change of scenery is an easy matter. Due to the heavy
growth of tropical shrubs that form a ground cover under our Florida rain
forest we often need only move the aviary a few yards to give the parrots
an entirely new environment. Since they remain in the aviary and their
nest box is immediately reattached upon locating the aviary the Amazons
feel secure and seem to fully enjoy the excitement of the change. We
leave the nest boxes with all our psittacines the year round and both birds
are often seen entering the nest box at almost any time of the year. Some
do so especially during the inclement weather. I learned this in the Cay-
man Islands years ago when a hurricane passed by the islands and they
were battered for several days by high winds and rain. Curious to know
how the parrots were taking the weather I spent much time in the field
and saw parrots peering out of nest holes in venerable old trees that had
stood tropical gales for centuries. It would seem that under these circum-
stances the parrots go for several days without eating until the winds are
abated. Young birds, lacking the experience of their elders are often found
water logged after heavy rain and cannot fly and are then easily caught.

This same thing often occurs in Cuba I am told and then the rural people
catch such birds and make a soup from them. Soup making of parrots is
an ancient practice of most of the Caribbean island peoples. It is supposed
to give strength and potency to the males of the family. The practice of
moving the aviary refers to Amazons only. Other psittacines that breed
the year round should not be disturbed. In the wild breeding Amazons will
usually make use of the same nest hole year after year. For some reason
in confinement they prefer a change of scenery. We must remember
that in the wild they are daily moving to new places in a circular move-
ment but maintain a perfect homing ability which brings them back to
their roosts and old nest sites each season. Moving them about thus gives
them a good memory pattern of the whole area on our ranch. This often
proves useful if a bird escapes. Amazons have excellent memories and a
very high degree of intelligence. For instance, one old Cuban male knows
that a certain pair of catching gloves that I use on Amazons has a small
hole in the right thumb. When attempting to catch him he always makes
for the hole and usually suceeds in nipping my thumb. This never fails
though he or any of our Amazons are seldom handled more than three
times a year. Merely showing the Amazons the gloves which may be
tucked under my arm causes great excitement. They know what the gloves
are used for and immediately fly to the furthest part of their aviary as
quickly as possible. Other types of strange clothing or hats only draw
marked curiosity but seldom trigger this fear behaviour.
Privacy
If you wish to breed Amazons, keep people away from your aviaries, as
breeding Amazons are highly nervous and unpredictable parrots. Stran-
gers may incite fights among breeding pairs, cause hens to leave the nest
and even worse, during the adults' frenzy they may even resort to biting
and killing their offspring. Many have been the injured looks I've had to
face when refusing visitors to our bird area here on the ranch. The true
aviculturist understands this caution but most beginners do not. Accus-
ations of unsociability are more than offset by the satisfaction gained from
breeding successes which will greatly aid in saving many species from
extinction and ease the heavy drain on wild populations which world
demand encourages. When one considers all that is involved, the rewards
are well worth the effort, heartache and time required of us.

Some of these birds are immature and therefore not expected to
breed for a year or two; the others have laid infertile eggs.
Breeding pairs are housed in aviaries measuring 18 ft. long, 4 ft. wide,
6 ft. 6 ins. high. We find Amazons are not very destructive; therefore the
wire need not be of the heaviest gauge. The roofs of the aviaries are half
board and felt, protected by wire mesh, the remainder of wire covered
by plastic sheeting or glass. The fronts are wire netting with sliding glass
panels to allow for ventilaion, all floors are concrete covered with peat
and gravel. Artificial lighting and a water misting system are used as
described in my article on breeding Pionus (AviculturalMagazine, VoL 84,
No. 2).
The birds are fed on soya beans, maize and a little sunflower seed
soaked overnight. To this mixture is added a good complete dog meal.

Carrot and greens are fed daily and berries and fruit as available. An abun-
dance of lucerne, celery, landcress, spinach, dandelion also succulent
young branches cut from willow, cultivated especially for the birds.
The small Amazons appreciate a handful of wheat thrown on to the
gravel floor; many will take bread and milk.
Our nests are natural logs; mostly dead elm about four feet high which
I hollow out with a chain saw. A hollow concrete cylinder approximately
nine inches deep encircles the base of each log; it is of sufficient diameter
to allow wet peat to be packed between it and the log. Inside the hollowed
log we put about 15 inches of peat, which is packed as firm as possible.
The birds spend a lot of time chewing the inside of the log, and in
some cases a cupped nest is formed. Since hens take some time in nest
preparation, it is difficult to tell when the first egg is laid. We try to keep
account and as soon as possible the clutch is candled. If the full clutch
is infertile, the eggs are taken away and there is every possibility that
the hen will lay again. Eggs that appear infertile are placed in the incubator
and candled again later before disposal.
The period of incubation is 26 to 28 days. The hen is fed in the log
by the male. As a point of interest our male Panama has for three seasons
spent the full incubation period in the log sitting side by side with the hen.
The male birds enter the nest to feed the hens or chicks. The hens are not
generally seen in the flight until the chicks are quite large and showing pin
feathers.
The period from hatching to full independence varies from 80 to 90
days. Careful observation is needed during the rearing period and chicks
that are not being well fed by the parents are removed and hand reared.
Youngsters reared in 1979 include: Double Yellow-headed, Panama
Yellow-fronted, Blue-fronted, Green-cheeked and Salle's.

THE ST. LUCIAN AMAZON PARROT
By T. SILVA (North Riverside, Illinois, USA)
The St. Lucian Amazon Amzona versicolor is one of the most endan-
gered Lesser Antillian Amazon parrots. Its numbers have steadily dropped
and at the moment its population is said to be between 30-250 depending
on the person asked, but is probably closer to 100. It is widely known on
its native island of St. Lucia and legally protected. Although it is being
watched closely by conservationists, its numbers are still dangerously low
and captive breeding will be the only way of saving this bird.
Its habitat is heavily forested and a natural preserve has been set aside
in the middle of the island for the Jaquot, as the islanders call it. Several
persons and I walked through this rain forest recently, a walk of approxi-
mately seven miles which takes three and a half to four hours to complete.
Though we viewed the splendour of this magnificent forest, we did not
see any of the birds but on several occasions heard a bell-like sound which
is the same sound made by captive birds and is not a typical Amazon
parrot voice. There are numerous fruit trees, and nesting trees available for
the birds and there are several rangers whose purpose is to watch and offer
the birds protection. It was difficult to see why this bird is so threatened
as it is being protected, is well-known to the islanders and its habitat is
almost untouched.
There is much variation in colour and size in these beautiful birds.
We viewed four of the six birds in captivity on the Island and no two had
the same coloration or size. The most impressive of the birds that we saw
was kept loose on the patio of a restaurant owner. It was very tame and
even when excited did not make any attempt to bite its owner. Though
this bird was very gentle it does not follow that it is typical of this species.
Another bird was also owned by a restaurateur who kept it with an Orange-
winged Amazon and a Greater Sulphur-crested Cockatoo. It appeared to
have mated with the Orange-winged Amazon and attempted to mate and
feed it whilst we were watching. Two other birds are kept by a man in his
home who has built a special aviary to house them. Their diet consisted of
mostly fruits, particularly bananas which are grown throughout this island,
coconuts, papaya, some sunflower seeds and peanuts. All the birds had
been shot, as this method is used throughout these islands, the hope being
that the bird is only winged and not killed, and they have dropped wings.
The only legally-held St. Lucian Amazons outside this Island are the

nine birds at the Jersey Wildlife Preservation Trust in the Channel Islands,
which are on loan from the Government of St. Lucia. Six of these birds
were collected in 1976, one in 1975, and hand-reared. Another bird had
been kept as a pet in England and the ninth is on loan from Hamilton,
Bermuda.
Lesser Antillean Amazon parrots are the largest and most impressive of
the Amazon parrots but they are all in danger and though many methods
of preserving them in the wild have been tried, I am convinced that captive
breeding will be the only way to save them from extinction. I believe that
the St. Lucian, along with the St. Vincent, Imperial and Red-necked
Amazons, should be distributed and placed with qualified individuals who
already have a successful record of breeding this genus.

By D.H.S. RISDON (Rode, Somerset)
One of the major attractions at the Tropical Bird Gardens have become
our liberty macaws, and since we are breeding them in fair numbers every
year I thought a few notes about them might be of interest.
First of all I don't think it would be possible to have as many breeding
pairs as we have flying free unless they were under control. The dominant
pairs would soon drive the others away. Each pair has its own aviary with
a small shelter in which it nests. The birds are let out in the morning
and called back in the evening when they are fed. The trap in the aviary is
then closed and they are confined for the night.
This serves several purposes. Sick birds can be easily caught up. Access
to nest boxes is comparatively easy as the parents can be shut in the
flight whilst inspection is being carried out. Dominant or aggressive pairs
can be prevented from taking over the nest sites of others.
The birds do not always behave as they should. On cold or wet evenings
they usually come in without trouble but on fine warm ones they some-
times "play up" and stay out late, to the exasperation of the keepers who
have to go back again and again to get them in. Sometimes, in spite of all

our efforts, they will have a night out in the trees. We then refuse to feed
them until they do come in. The great thing is to get them "hooked" on
some tit-bit, like biscuit, which does not form a regular part of their
diet. This can be invaluable should they stray away from home and have to
be fetched back. In this case the rattle of the biscuit tin will get them to
answer and show their whereabouts.
They do stray occasionally for no apparent reason. Their homing
instinct is not strong and if they wander more than a mile from home they
seem to lose all sense of direction and end up ten or twenty miles away.
Young unmated birds make the best show as they fly in groups, but
they are not always the easiest to get in at night. Adult pairs stick more or
less to a given territory and are more "home bound".
There is little doubt that when free they pick up extras in the way of
buds and fresh green bark, not to mention beech nuts and the wild berries
of autumn. Whether this contributes to our breeding success is hard to
say because quite a few macaws are bred nowadays permanently confined
in aviaries.
In practically every case our breeding pairs have found their own
mates. Macaws are the most intelligent of an intelligent group of birds.
They form strong attachments and if two decide to pair up there is little
you can do to stop them. Conversely you can put two together but it
does not follow that you will have a compatible pair, especially if they are
within sight or sound of others.
After 18 years of close contact with them, I find them almost impos-
sible to sex by appearance - at least the Blue and Yellows and the Scarlets.
Green-winged are a bit more obvious - the cocks have heavier and broader
beaks. Like all intelligent creatures macaws vary considerably one from
another and one can be easily misled by appearances. We had what I would
have sworn was a true pair of Blue and Yellow. One was substantially
larger and bolder than the other and they behaved like a pair, but both
laid eggs!
Our macaws usually start breeding in April or May. We give them stout
wooden boxes or barrels, partly open at the top. In the bottom of these
is a layer of broken up rotten wood about six inches deep. The boxes
are about 20 inches square and the same in height. It is unnecessary to
make these too big. The birds seem to like crowding themselves into a
small space. The boxes are placed in the shelter part of the aviary, well
off the ground - in fact as high as possible.
When they are due to lay, their appetites increase. Three eggs make the
usual clutch. The hen does the incubating, although the cock will often

<bodyText confidence="0.999768545454546" page_id="56284009"  page_num="251" year="" vol="">
enter the box with her if danger threatens. Incubation lasts from 23 days
to 35 days. It is difficult to be certain of the exact time because, although
the hen frequents the box from the laying of the first egg, she does not
really start sitting until the second or third has been laid.
Again the birds' appetites increase when hatching time is getting near,
presumably to build up crop milk. At this time their liking for cooked
meat and bread liberally smeared with margarine increases. They love chop
bones with the remains of fat adhering and will strip off every scrap.
When they have young our oldest breeding pair of Blue and Yellow
will fly down and feed with my pigeons, greedily taking peas and maize,
and yet if these grains are offered in their food tin they will not touch
them.
The young fledge at 13 weeks old, and then we have a problem. They
can fly quite well at this stage and if allowed out with their parents they
get up in the trees and refuse to come down, relying on the old birds to
feed them. We therefore find it better to clip their flight feathers before
they fly, thus restricting them to a given area, so that we can get them on a
stick and return them to the aviary each evening until they have learned
to do this themselves.
The colour of the iris in young birds is dark at first. It begins to lighten
to grey at about six months. By the time they are a year old it is almost
as pale as that of the adult bird.

By MISS M. GOURLAY (Camberley, Surrey)
I was very much intrigued when earlier this year I noticed that my one
pair of Vernal Hanging Parrots were actively engaged in courtship, with
constant feeding of the hen by the cock bird. The pair lived in an out-door
planted aviary with a shed where the heat was permanently controlled at
a minimum of 60*F. Their companions were chlorophonias, zosterops,
yuhinas and a solitary hen Silver-throated Tanager, with whom they lived
in perfect amity. The tubular heaters in the shed have a board across the

top of them, and on this I placed a large hollow birch log, given to me by
another bird enthusiast.
The log had a naturally made pop-hole approximately twelve inches
from the bottom inside level. It soon became evident that the hen was
sitting, but having read G. D. Gradwell's article in the Society's Magazine
(Vol. 81, No. 3 1975) I was not very hopeful of success.
In due course I noted that food was being taken into the nesting site,
but as the log had a screwed-on lid I was not going to risk desertion by
satisfying my curiosity.
I had not long to wait for this, as soon both parents appeared constant-
ly in the flight, and I knew that my worst fears were realised. I opened the
lid and was horrified to find four dead babies half buried in the soft peat
at the bottom of the log. This was the first time I had actually seen inside
it, and then realised that the hen must have had great difficulty in scaling
the smooth interior to get to the hole, and in doing so must have trodden
the babies into the peat with fatal results.
I replaced the peat with dried grass, and also fixed a little plastic ladder
to the inside of the log leading to the hole.
On the 3rd of March I thought I heard sounds coming from the log,
and again on the 6th and 13th, and at intervals after that. I continued
giving an extra ration of hard-boiled yolks of eggs, plus mealworms,
maggots, sponge cake mixed with honey and Farex mixed with peanut
butter. At last on the 29th March I was met in the flight by a youngster,
fully fledged, and almost larger than its parents. I opened the lid, and to
my surprise found two more little parrots fully fledged, looking a day or
two younger than the one outside, but they both emerged on the two
successive days, looking as strong and robust as the first one.
They continued to prosper, and are now quite independent of their
parents - I reckon they were in the nest for approximately five weeks
before emerging.
To me the most amazing feature was that when I removed the log to
clean it out expecting to find very dirty sticky mess in the nest, it was
perfectly clean and dry - how the parents managed that I simply do not
know.
The hen is sitting again on seven eggs (May 1980) but owing to various
disturbances, I think it unlikely that any of these will hatch out, but it is
virtually impossible to tell when incubation started.

When this hanging parrot, with a size of about 14 cm, has moulted
out completely, it is beautiful light green with a bright orange bill and
orange legs, its rump is bright red. The cock then has a small red "cap" and
a large orange patch on its throat. The head is slightly more yellowish
green than the rest of the body. Under the wings and the tail the feathers
are light blue that becomes darker to the top of the wings. The hen is a
shade darker green, the "cap" is smaller, whereas the cheeks are bright
deep light blue. The eyes are brown but when the cock is agitated it shows
a light eye-ring by which it looks aggressive and fierce. The young birds
come totally pale green out of the nest, apart from the red patch on the
back, while the bill and the legs are light yellow. The eyes are like dark
black beads.
In the autumn of 1976 I bought Philippine Hanging Parrots from
several bird-dealers. One dealer kept the birds cold, at about 15*C, in a
very spacious aviary; the other kept them in a heated room with an extra
heating-unit at a temperature of about 30*C. Notwithstanding this con-
siderable difference in temperature, I put the hanging parrots that I
bought from both of these dealers together in one aviary. The first day I
kept the hanging parrots at a temperature of about 20*C but after that
every day I lowered the temperature a little. After one week the tempe-
rature of the aviary was about 5*C in the day-time and at night warmed up
to 10*C. These temperatures seemed to suit all the birds.
After two weeks I opened the hatch to the outside aviary to let the
fresh air in and all went well.
When the weather became more agreeable in the spring, I saw that the
hanging parrots spent more and longer periods in the outside aviary. In
the summer of 1977 from the fourteen hanging parrots I bought, in
total four of them had died, presumably as a result of the transport -
and quarantine-time. The ten remaining parrots proved to be four cocks
and six hens.
The autumn of 1977 was very wet, the winter was particularly mild,
whereas the spring of 1978 was too cold. Nevertheless the hanging par-
rots preferred to stay outside in the open aviary even at night. In this
outside aviary grow bamboo, buxus and privet bushes, and it has wild
clematis and other climbing plants growing over it.

Philippine Hanging Parrot chicks, 6 weeks old
As spring proceeded and summer began I saw that the cocks showed
more interest in the hens and looked more and more into the nest logs.
Then I saw a hen in a privet bush, biting off the leaves of the privet
and putting these leaves between the feathers of its abdomen, while its
partner was chasing away another hen and its mate from this bush. It
always proved to be the same hen with its male, which collected the
leaves from a specific privet bush. All the other hanging parrots were
chased away by the cock. When the hen returned "empty" from its
breeding log, the cock immediately fed her and then started whistling
softly but meanwhile it kept watch in its privet bush. After several days
I decided to check the breeding logs.
As a breeding place I used a log with a length of about 50 cm, with an
inside diameter of 16 cm and an entrance hole of 4 cm. The breeding
logs were made from the trunk of a poplar. In total three pairs started to
breed. Unfortunately one of the hens died when it flew away in panic out
of its breeding log, in which it was brooding four oval formed eggs. The
eggs were about 18.6 x 16.5 mm. From the other pairs, one pair had five

and the other one four eggs.
After three weeks of incubation I heard a soft squeaking. The cock
went into the breeding log but as the hen was very nervous I did not
dare to have a look at the results. When the first young one was about
fifteen days old I inspected one of the nests. There lay four young ones of
several ages. I could just ring the eldest one but not yet the youngest.
One proved to be dead, when I took a look after three days. The other
three young ones grew up and flourished, and after six weeks they flew
out, one after the other.
Two weeks after the youngest one flew out I saw that the hen started
anew biting off leaves from its privet bush. Immediately I removed the old
nest and cleaned the inside thoroughly. After one week there lay the first
egg of the second clutch.
The young ones were mainly fed by the cock. If the hen had time for
it, it did so too but not so assidously as the cock. I gave the hanging
parrots various seeds in separate feeding bottles, hung up in the inner
cage in winter time and outside in the summer. Every day during the
breeding period the hanging parrots also had sprouted white sunflower
seeds and another kind of sprouted seed. Although they had dry seeds
at their disposal, they also had a lory-nectar in the morning and egg-food
in the afternoon. The egg-food contained brown bread, Gistocal (a cal-
careous animal preparation), milk powder, grated carrots, apples and other
fruits. This was always freshly made every day.
From the first clutches I got respectively three and two young ones and
from the second clutches two and two. The accompanying pictures show
the first three young ones taken on the hand. The young ones are born naked
and after about ten days they have a little grey-white down. On the fif-
teenth day the eyes are open and the first feathers appear.
Although the parent birds started to colour after being six months
in my aviary, the young ones already moulted at three months old and
when hardly nine months old they went into the breeding logs almost
completely coloured. Now in spring 1979 they are as anxious as their
parents to start breeding and dance and sing cheerfully in the sunshine.
I have had eggs in the nest logs from young birds only ten months old.

FEATHER PLUCKING IN PARROTS -
OBSERVATIONS OF AN AMATEUR
</sectionHeader>

By HAZEL HATHORN (Frome, Somerset)
Opinions on feather plucking in parrots, its causes and cures, vary so
widely, even among experts, that possibly the experience of a mere ama-
teur like myself might be of interest, having been lucky enough to achieve
one spectacular 100 per cent cure.
I firmly believe that the basic causes of feather plucking are psycholo-
gical - boredom, frustration, even grief for an absent owner, and seldom, if
ever, the result of a physical disorder or dietary deficiency. Unfortunately,
as everyone knows, the habit, once acquired, is very hard to break and
curing the cause of the trouble will often not stop the bird from plucking.
One can restore the absent owner (if alive of course!), provide a frus-
trated bird with a mate and give a bored bird occupation or greater free-
dom, but so often one is merely left with a happy plucked parrot instead
of a disturbed one. This is one stage to the good, admittedly, from the
parrots viewpoint, but one is then left with a depressed owner, who, hav-
ing corrected the parrot's mental condition expects its physical appearance
to be restored in due course. So often this doesn't happen, either because
the parrot has been plucking so long and so thoroughly that it has destro-
yed all its feather follicles so that the feathers cannot regrow, or because
the habit of plucking is so ingrained that it is a way of life.
Over the years I have acquired several partly plucked African Greys,
mostly at the "white woolly waistcoat" stage, and, of these, one is now in
excellent feather, one appears to be regrowing well after two years with us,
and the other two are about the same as they were when we first had
them. I have also one failure - a bird who was in good feather when we had
her and who is a marvellous talker in all the different voices of the family.
She appeared on television a couple of years ago to introduce a "Wildlife
on One" programme, and from this time on she began to pluck. I can
only assume that she is a frustrated television star, thwarted of the fame
she feels is her due, after one brief appearance. She remains a tremendous
talker and in every way seems a happy contented bird, thus confounding
all my theories.
The total success which I mentioned earlier is with a bird which was
offered to me about six years ago by a man who had married and left
his parrot in his family home with his elderly mother. Mother no longer
felt equal to lifting and cleaning the cage and coping with the feathers

and husk on the floor each day. He warned me during conversation that
the parrot "had lost a few feathers", but this proved to be an understate-
ment for when I saw Polly she was absolutely naked, apart from her head
and neck feathers. Just like an oven ready chicken. I had never seen any-
thing so pathetic. She was a gentle and friendly bird, however, instantly
ducking her head to be scratched and offering gentle beak-pinches in
return.
Within about three weeks of acquiring Polly she was covered in white
fluffy down and about a week later flight quills began to appear; also a
row of red-tipped quills on her tail. Each morning and evening when I
returned from work I was afraid to look in case she had pulled them all
out but, incredibly, she let the feathers grow unmolested until within
about four months she was fully feathered. The odd thing was that each
feather was twisted and curved so that she presented a completely curly
appearance. I thought that possibly the constant feather plucking had
damaged the feather follicles but a friend suggested that the curliness
was the result of hunger trace - a condition produced by a diet deficiency
when she had needed extra nutrients to cope with the vast feather re-
growth programme. This must have been the answer because gradually
the twisted feathers moulted out to be replaced by normal ones and within
a year Polly was a perfectly feathered bird. She has exceptionally thick
and profuse feathers - I can bury my fingers in the thick mantle at the
back of her neck. Also she has a strange dusty pink tinge to her wing and
back feathers. This is not like the coral coloured groups often seen on the
breasts of African Greys but an all-over dusting of pink, more the tone of
a Roseate Cockatoo.
I can only think that the complete change of environment and possibly
the company of other birds cured Polly.

Two subspecies of the Austral Conure are Enicognothus ferrugineus
ferrugineus and the smaller Enicognathus ferrugineus minor. The Austral
Conure is mainly green; the back is a dull green while the front is more of
a yellowish green. The feathers on the head and on the rump are black
margined, which gives the bird the effect of "being scaled". The band on
the forehead and the patch on the abdomen have the typical maroon-red
colour of many South American parrots. This colour is also apparent in
the tail, although in sunlight the feathers shine with a flaming copper-
red. Like many other kinds of South American parrots they have dark
blue flight feathers. The beak, naked eye-ring and legs are dark grey,
almost black.
The Austral Conure lives in the most southern parts of Chile and
Argentina, up to 55* south latitude, except on the higher mountains and
the tableland region of the east coast. The country here is rather dry,
and the habitat consists of beech woods, Acacia and, on the higher parts,
the Araucaria . They are fond of the seeds of these trees, and in captivity
we give them pine nuts and beech nuts, although the latter will not keep
very well.
While visiting a bird-dealer I saw several of these interesting and un-
common birds, and many of them were in very poor condition and so
badly injured due to the catching and transport conditions that they
would never fly again. Although the merchant was asking high prices, I
resolved to buy some of these birds because I was completely fascinated
by their uncommon behaviour and attitude. I selected the most healthy
looking out of the mistreated specimens.
The winter of 1978 - 1979 was very cold. In my garden we had temp-
eratures of minus 24*C for three successive nights, and of minus 20*C
in the daytime for a period of ten days. The birds remained in surprisingly
good condition in spite of this, seeking shelter in the nest logs at night.
Spring started with beautiful sunny weather and warm temperatures.
This, however, did not last and it became cold again. In spite of the bad
weather, I noticed one of the birds was missing. I found that one of the
hens was preparing its nest in one of the nest logs. The bird stayed for
longer and longer periods in the nest, and on investigating the log I found
two eggs. After laying a third egg the hen remained inside the nest. After

six days the hen, which was very tame, allowed further investigation and
six eggs were found.
Although mating was not observed in this pair, other pairs showed
that mating takes place very early in the morning.
The eggs were laid on the 29th of May, 31st of May, 2nd June, 4th
June, 6th June and the last on the 8th of June.
On the 25th June I heard a soft squeaking and when I took a look at
the nest I saw that there were two young of one day old. The chick in the
third egg was chirping and half out of its shell. This proved that the hen
had started brooding after laying its second egg and, like the Pyrrhura
conures, the fourth and fifth egg hatched after 21 days of incubation.
Unfortunately the sixth egg failed to hatch, having been slightly damaged
by the hen. The five young birds thrived: I ringed them all at fifteen
days. The young birds were very calm and almost tame, and remained
so, even after leaving the nest; even now they will come to me when
tempted by food.
The Austral Conure, like the Pyrrhuras, the Aratingas and the Amazons,
will cover the faeces of the chicks in the nest with small pieces of wood

which they bite off the inside of the nest logs.
On the 22nd of August the first bird flew out, and after five days
I had five beautiful full-grown birds on the perch.
Three days after the last of the young birds had flown out, the parent
birds stopped feeding them, and on the fourth day even chased them away
from the nest. This was the first time that I had seen such behaviour
towards their young in South American parrots.
The young birds thrived and after two months they even started to
imitate other calls and sounds. When one of the young males had been
out of the nest for four months I saw him feeding an adult female, who
accepted this gesture.
To encourage the parents to breed for a second time I put an extra
nest log into the aviary but no interest was shown in this.
The Austral Conures were housed in a completely outdoor aviary with
dimensions of 8 m. long, 1 m. wide and 1.75 m. high. The breeding de-
scribed above started as a colony breeding with three pairs together
in one aviary. When the first pair had started breeding, the other pairs
showed interest in the remaining nest logs, but unfortunately I had no
further results.
The logs hung on one side of the aviary, about one metre apart. There
were two feeding-places; one in a small covered part at the back of the
aviary contained dry seed mixture, with less popular white sunflower
seeds provided nearby, while at the front of the aviary they got fruit,
sprouted seeds, soft food and other dainties such as fruit tree blossoms,
fresh sprouted greens, endive etc.
The Austral Conures are very calm birds not given to noisy screeches
at all. I found them very intelligent and easy to tame.

THE DISCOVERY OF THE HOME OF LEAR'S MACAW
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.98764425" page_id="56284019"  page_num="261" year="" vol="">
By ARTHUR FREUD (Smithtown, New York)
In December 1978, the home of Lear's Macaw was discovered by Dr.
Helmut Sick, a German ornithologist, who has worked in Brazil for almost
forty years. Lear's Macaw (named for the artist and poet, Edward Lear)
was first identified in 1856. Edward Lear had painted a portrait of what he
believed to be a Hyacinthine Macaw for his famous folio of parrot port-
raits in 1831. Lear generally used live models for his work and thus it
appears that the ornithologist, Bonaparte, honoured Lear by naming the
newly identified species after him in 1856. Bonaparte made his differ-
entiation between A. lean and A. hyacinthinus after viewing skins in the
Paris Museum and comparing these with Lear's painting. The illustration
which accompanies this article is from a photo of one of Lear's original
lithographs and the typical half moon facial markings of the Lear's Macaw
can be easily noted. The Lear's is also referred to as the Indigo Macaw
but little has been known about the origin of this attractive bird. Since it
is quite similar in appearance to the Hyacinthine Macaw it was frequently
shipped together with that parrot without any differentiation being made
between the two birds. Importers who lacked knowledge or were not
perceptive would then simply sell the Lear's as a smaller and less vividly
coloured member of A. hyacinthinus .
Dr. Sick is a highly respected member of the Academy of Sciences
as well as a professor at the University of Rio and a member of the staff
of the Museum of Natural History. His name is well known in ornitho-
logical circles for his published papers.
Dr. Sick's article on the of Anodorhynchus lean originally appeared in
the August 1979 issue of the German magazine Die Gefiederte Welt. It was
brought to my attention by my friend Henning H. Jacobsen of Denmark
who knew of my interest in this parrot from an article which I had written
about the Lear's for the British magazine of the Parrot Society. A letter to
the editor of Die Gefiederte Welt provided Dr. Sick's address and the
suggestion that I contact him for permission to translate the article and
quote from it. An interesting correspondence ensued following which Dr.
Sick graciously granted his permission.
Most current authors indicate that Lear's Macaw is a rather mysteri-
ous bird in that little is known about its distribution. Forshaw speculates
that the bird probably originates in north-eastern Brazil and that it is

extremely rare. He quotes Voous' 1969 speculation that the Lear's may by
a hybrid between the Hyacinthine and Glaucous Macaws, but has his
doubts about this.
The records show that shipments of Lear's Macaws (arriving with
Hyacinthines) would come from such locations as Para, probably from the
harbour of Belem but the exact origin of the Lear's could not be pin point-
ed. Forshaw reports also that in 1950 Pinto visited the town of Santo
Antao in Pernambuco and was shown there a recently captured Lear's
which presumably came from Joazeiro, a city on the left bank of the
Sao Francisco River. This was a hint of the possible location of origin of
the Lear's.
Dr. Sick himself, writing in 1969 noted that the species was rare al-
though the possibility existed that additional populations remained to
be discovered. Thus, in 1978 Dr. Sick made a third effort to locate the
home of Lear's Macaw which until this time had been known only by
observations of captive specimens. His explorations took him to Raso de
Catarina which was the last place that Dr. Sick believed a wild popu-
lation of Lear's could exist. During his journey to Raso de Catarina (which
is in northern Bahia) Dr. Sick saw as many as 21 specimens of Lear's
Macaw flying together. He located their sleeping and nesting places which
were in inaccessible rock caves in the sides of the canyon-like dried river
valleys. The Lear's were the only macaws which appeared in the area.
It was a difficult trip as the tropical heat was most pronounced at this
time of the year and this added to the hardship of the journey. Travelling
conditions were primitive with lengthy rides being made on beasts of
burden which were provided with platforms to carry supplies and riders
rather than the more comfortable saddles. In spite of these hardships
Dr. Sick considered the trip a fabulous adventure.
His moment of triumph arrived after a lengthy night march which took
them through areas of deep and loose sand in the trackless Dornbusch-
Caatinga region. Dr. Sick reports that the Raso de Catarina is one of the
most inaccessible regions of Brazil. It was the scene of the revolt of a small
group of individuals against the government of the Republic of Brazil in
1897. This was referred to as the Canudos War. The area is so rough that
more than 1,000 elite troops from Rio and Sao Paulo died in the area
during this war. It is believed that most of them died of thirst. Dr. Sick's
party had 60 litres of water with them which required great economy in
use.
The programme of discovery lasted for approximately one and a half
months. It is interesting to note that Dr. Sick celebrated his 69th birthday

on the 10th January 1978 by sitting in the Ara-Canyons and observing
the parrots which were arriving to roost as the sun went down. He viewed
at least 15 specimens of Lear's through his new, large telescope on this
occasion. Thus, surrounded by a thick swarm of insects and watching a
pair of Lear's Macaws preening each other, he celebrated the most memo-
rable birthday of his life secure in the knowledge that he had at last found
the home of Anodorhynchus leari.

ALL ABOUT PARROTS By ARTHUR FREUD

Arthur Freud is well-known to American parrot enthusiasts for his
regular column in American Cage Bird Magazine. In his articles the em-
phasis is invariably on pet birds and this interest is reflected in his book.
Its title is misleading: more accurately it should have been entitled "All
about Pet Parrots". The species covered are discussed primarily from their
aspect of their talking ability and accomplishments as pets. The book con-
tains very little on the subject of breeding.
The first seven chapters cover general aspects: A History of Parrot
Keeping, Purchasing a Parrot, Cages and Toys, Feeding, "Polly Wanna
Talk?", Training Techniques and a chapter on health. This section contains
much excellent advice for the pet keeper. In the chapter on cages and
toys, for example, there are many useful ideas which will increase the
health and happiness of any pet parrot.
The remaining chapters are devoted to the African Grey, Amazons,
Macaws, Cockatoos, Conures, Budgies and Cockatiels, and "A sample
of other interesting Parrots and Mynah Birds". The species selected again
indicate that Mr. Freud's interest is primarily the pet bird. These chapters
could be described as a review of the existing literature, and those who
have a fairly comprehensive library of parrot books will not find a great
deal of original material. The author quotes very extensively from the
Duke of Bedford, Rutgers and Norris and Rosemary Low, as well as
nineteenth century writers such as Karl Russ and W. T. Greene.
The danger in this type of compilation is that not only is much of
the material vastly out of date (even that quoted from the more recent
sources, for developments in parrot aviculture have been rapid) but in-
accuracies and legends are passed on to the reader. We learn, for example,
that the now extinct Carolina Conures wintered in hollow
trunks of dead cypress trees "in a state resembling hibernation"! And
that the Roseate or Galah is the most commonly kept species of cockatoo.
This was true a century ago - but not today.
It is regrettable that a large number of misspelt names of places, people
and birds occur throughout the text; for example, the Blue-eyed Cock-

page 204.
The standard of the colour photographs is quite high; unfortunately,
each colour photograph is also reproduced in black and white at a differ-
ent point in the text. This is something of an insult to the reader's powers
of observation. In addition there are many good black and white photo-
graphs and numerous line drawings by Lydon. Many will feel that these
century-old illustrations look out of place in a modern work with colour
photographs. Several species are wrongly captioned; the Alexadrine (in
colour and monochrome) is described as a Ringneck Parrakeet and a
Lydon drawing of a Ground Parrakeet bears the caption "An early render-
ing of a Budgie".

LOVEBIRDS AND THEIR COLOUR MUTATIONS

It is about 20 years since Vane's book on lovebirds and parrotlets
was first published. It was an incredibly informative little book which,
unfortunately, is now out of print. Paradoxically, its publication was
followed by a dearth of interest in lovebirds probably because parrot
breeders were more inclined to devote their aviary accommodation to ex-
pensive and profitable Australian parrakeets than to lovebirds, most species
of which could be brought for a few pounds a pair.

since the 1930's it is only the last decade which has seen the establishment
of other new colour varieties of various species. An almost incredible
number of colour varieties of the Peach-faced species has been produced,
many of which have been given ridiculous names like "Golden Cherry".
Some are dull washed-out, almost dirty looking varieties which seem
hardly worth perpetuating and make one wonder whether lovebird enthu-
siasts would not be doing aviculture a better service if they devoted
their tune and effort to the re-establishment of aviary strains of normal
Nyasas and Black-cheeks now scarce in captivity. However, this is a per-
sonal bias and, to be fair, there can be few parrots more lovely than lutino
or so-called "pastel-blue" Peach-faced Lovebirds.
The precipitous drop in value, particularly on the Continent, of Aus-
tralian parakeets and the establishment of many new lovebird mutations
appear to have stimulated a revival of interest in the lovebird genus and
Jim Hayward's "Lovebirds and their Colour Mutations" has been pub-
lished at just the right time. A considerable amount of valuable infor-
mation on the various colour varieties of the Peach-faced and other species
has been collected together, probably for the first time, and the book
abounds with the theoretical expectations from various matings. Few
people know more about lovebirds in captivity than the author who has
drawn on his considerable experience to describe the basic accommo-
dation he uses for lovebirds, as well as their general management and the
hazards associated with their breeding. The book contains very useful,
admirably concise, sections on diseases and on the performance of simple
post mortem examinations but the chapter on genetics is probably too
brief for the principles of Mendel to be made comprehensive to the un-
initiated. The book is profusely illustrated. The colour photographs
depict almost every species of lovebird and its known colour varieties,
but the colours in some have not been reproduced accurately (e.g. the
green of the Fischer's Lovebird). The black and white illustrations, except
the anatomical diagrams, are hardly necessary. For beginners with love-
birds the book gives a brief account of their requirements in captivity
and for more experienced breeders it brings together information about
mutations which has not previously been generally available. It is very
good value for its price.

HOW TO KEEP PARROTS, COCKATIELS
AND MACAWS IN CAGE OR AVIARY
By ROSEMARY LOW.
</sectionHeader>

Published by John Bartholomew &amp; Sons Ltd., Edingburgh, Scotland. 1980
Rosemary Low is widely known in the avicultural world as a most
successful keeper and breeder of various parrots. I use the word "parrot"
in the ornithological sense to cover all birds of the family Psittacidae. It
would have been better so used in the title of this book which deals not
only with parrots, cockatiels and macaws in the restricted senses suggested
by such a title, but also with parakeets, lovebirds, conures, hanging par-
rots, lories, lorikeets and cockatoos.
It is an attractive little book, published by the same firm and in the
same general format as her previous book on mynas. It is a very convenient
size that will slip readily into the pocket for train journeys, and is sort of
halfway between hardback and paper back in consistency. I can fmd no
indication of price on my review copy but an enclosed note from the firm
has a lot of (to me) mysterious (and unexplained) letters and numbers
listed among which is "limp 96pp". If this indicates a price of less than
#1 the book is indeed a bargain by present day standards.
The author deals first with such general subjects as "Starting with
parrots", "Feeding", "Breeding", etc.; subsequent chapters deal with
different main groups of parrots such as the cockatoos, the Australian
parakeets and others. The deservedly popular Cockatiel has a chapter to
itself. All the species likely to be available to the aviculturist, and some
that are not, are discussed in these chapters. My own personal experience
with birds of this family has been restricted (apart from boyhood Budger-
igars) to observations of various species wild in Australia and Brazil and of
feral Rose-ringed Parakeets "somewhere in Kent". I believe, however,
that the author's advice is sound as well as humane. I was glad to see
that she stresses the cruelty of leaving a pet parrot alone for long periods,
the unsuitability of standard parrot cages and the fact that many parrots
are not primarily seed eaters in a wild state. Perhaps it is one welcome
side effect of the "permissiveness 44 so deplored by far Right and far Left
alike that we no longer consider our captive birds dangerously "pam-
pered" if they are protected from cold or given a reasonably varied diet.
If so, it is to be hoped that the "reactionary backlash" now widely fore-
told will not see our lorikeets put back on "plain healthy diet" of canary
seed and groundsel!

But back to the book. It is good to know that some species are being
bred in numbers, but are there really now more Bourke's Parakeets in
captivity than wild in Australia as is claimed (p. 55)? Is Leadbeater's
Cockatoo (surely one of the most beautiful birds in the world) in the
perilous state that seems implied? When I was in Australia in 1965 I saw
numbers of both these species, including a flock of about 200 Leadbeater's
Cockatoos where they "ought" not to have been (elsewhere I saw this
species only in pairs or in small flocks of up to about ten individuals).
I should hate to think that either of these species have since seriously
declined. But have they?
The book is illustrated with (unless I have miscounted) 19 colour
pictures, mostly full page, depicting 21 species. Except in the case of the
Hyacinthine Macaw (which seems to miss the whole "jizz" of its subject)
I found them both attractive and accurate; in a few the colour is not
quite right, but that is no doubt due to reproduction and not the fault
of the unnamed artist. Why is he or she unnamed? His/her pictures, even if
not in the top rank, seem to me much better than those of some much
lauded modern bird artists whose names my kindly nature and libel laws
alike deter me from dropping.
A book of this size obviously cannot be fully comprehensive, but it is
surprising what a lot of information it contains. Moreover references to
other works are given. It can be heartily recommended.

PARROTS - THEIR CARE AND BREEDING
By ROSEMARY LOW
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.995284028571429" page_id="56284027"  page_num="269" year="" vol="">
Published by the Blandford Press. 670 pp. Price #22.00
The past decade has seen the publication of a plethora of avicultural
books so many of which have been devoted to parrots that one might be
tempted to ask if another is really necessary. However, it is quickly ap-
parent to the reader that "Parrots - their care and breeding" by Rosemary
Low is quite different from books by other authors on the same subject.
Few aviculturists are more experienced in keeping successfully many
species of parrot and none can indulge their interest with more care.
This outstanding experience and enormous care are evident in the first
part of the book in which the author deals with accommodation, feeding,
management, etc. These chapters contain advice invaluable not only to
beginners but also to experienced breeders as also does the chapter on
sickness in which G. A. Smith, whose knowledge of diseases in parrots
is remarkable, summarises in his inimitable way, an incredible amount
of useful information.
The second part of the book is concerned with the various species
which are, or have been, available to aviculturists. The author's practical
experience, combined with her considerable knowledge gained meticulo-
usly from the literature and from personal contacts, makes this section of
the book unique in that it contains a vast amount of original inform-
ation. Much of the emphasis is placed on breeding but more attention
could have been given to the part which aviculturists can play in conserv-
ation. The Australian species, which undoubtedly are ideal subjects for
aviculture, are not given quite the same attention as, for example, the
lories and the South American parrots, and, although the author refers
to the remarkably numerous breeding successes with rare species like
Hooded, Golden-shouldered and Brown's Parakeets in Dutch, German etc
aviaries, the subject is never developed.
Many species are illustrated with colour photographs of excellent
quality although a few of the illustrations, which were probably included
because they are almost unique, show specimens (e.g. Painted Conures,
Spix's Macaw) which could have been in better feather condition.The
book is well written in an interesting and scholarly manner. Reading it
has given me more pleasure than any other book on aviculture ever has.
