ELLIOT'S PHEASANT
(Syrmaticus ellioti)
By Philip Wayre (Norwich, England)
Elliot's Pheasant is one of the most striking of the long-tailed
</figure>
<bodyText confidence="0.993728413793104" page_id="56316988"  page_num="1" year="" vol="">
pheasants. The male is a particularly attractive bird with a clearly
defined plumage pattern. The feathers of the upper breast and
mantle have bright copper tips, giving the effect of a rufous sheen.
Young birds are dull, rather like the adult female but young males
soon show barred tail feathers.
These birds breed fairly easily in captivity, although the males are
sometimes bad tempered, and likely to kill the hens. As with many
of the rarer pheasants the stock in this country at the present time is
rather inbred and consequently there is a certain amount of infertility.
Elliot's will breed quite well in small pens and the Trust has bred a
number of young from a pair kept in a pen measuring only 20 by
10 feet. A larger pen is to be recommended. Two or three hens may
be run with each cock, and it is an advantage if there is plenty of
natural cover in the pen.
The hen Elliot's is one of the earliest layers, usually beginning in
March, and each hen may produce ten to twenty eggs. They are
small for the size of the bird. As might be expected the chicks are also
small and care should be taken to ensure that they are eating during
the first few days. Live maggots are a great help, and apart from these
the chicks will rear well on one of the proprietary brands of pheasant
or turkey starter crumbs. It is inadvisable to mix other breeds of
pheasant chicks with Elliot's, although an odd Golden Pheasant chick
or two will help to encourage the Elliot's chicks to start feeding.
According to Delacour, Elliot's and Mikado Pheasants cross readily
in captivity, and the hybrid cocks are fertile, while the hybrid hens
are generally sterile. These hybrid cocks might be useful to cross with
Mikado hens in the event of the latter species facing extinction, which
seems possible in the near future. This mating should obviously be
regarded as the last resort to infuse fresh blood into the Mikados.

The result of such a mating is almost indistinguishable from a pure
Mikado.
Elliot's Pheasants are found in South-east China in the same area
as Cabot's Tragopans. De-afforestation and the increasing human j
population in this area have led to a great reduction in the wild stock
of Elliot's Pheasants.
I am informed by Dr. K. C. Searle of Hong Kong that some years
ago consignments of Cabot's Tragopans reaching the island from
China nearly always included a few Elliot's, but this is no longer the
case, presumably due to their scarcity.
Therefore it is most important to maintain a large stock of this
beautiful species in captivity.

The Trust has been in operation for two years and its collection of
game birds has grown to be one of the most comprehensive in Europe.
Membership continues to increase, though slowly. At the present
moment it stands at nine life members, thirteen sustaining members,
and 149 ordinary members, making a total of 171. Over 400 people
visited the Trust this year, including Natural History Societies,
Young Farmers' Clubs, schools, and other organized parties. On
5th September over forty members of the British Association visited
the collection and were shown round by the Director and his staff.
The President, M. Jean Delacour visited Great Witchingham on
Friday, 4th August, and once again showed his great interest in the
Trust, and put forward many useful suggestions. Other well known
visitors included Field Marshal Viscount Alanbrooke, Dr. Kruijt from
Holland, Dr. Edward Hindle, and Mr. Aubrey Buxton.
On Saturday, 15th April, the Director gave the premiere of his film
Wind in the Reeds , which is about the wildlife of the Norfolk Broads, at
the Royal Festival Hall in aid of the Imperial Cancer Research Fund.
An audience of nearly 3,000 resulted in several hundred pounds being
raised for the Cancer Fund. A copy of the Ornamental Pheasant
Trust's pamphlet was enclosed with every programme, and at the end
of the show the Director explained the aims of the Trust and invited
membership.
The Director has made a number of references to the Trust's
activities in his television programmes and lectures. On 24th and
29th November there were full houses at both the Colston Hall,
Bristol, and Theatre Royal, Norwich, for the showings of Wind in the
Reeds , where a total of over 3,500 people were told of the Trust's work,
and pamphlets were distributed. He has made a new film of the latest
additions to the collection and of rearing methods, pens, etc.
Your Council is pleased to report that Mr. A. A. Prestwich accepted
its invitation to become a Vice-President of the Trust. Mr. Terry
Jones was elected to the Council in his place.
As most members are aware, the Trust has deposited a number of
pairs of rarer species of pheasants with members who have the necessary
facilities for breeding them. This is done in order to safeguard captive
stocks in the event of disease such as fowl pest. Under this scheme
Mr. F. E. B. Johnson has bred two Edwards's Pheasants (Lophura
edwardsi) for the Trust and Mr. Newton Steel two fine pairs of Elliot's
Pheasants (Syrmaticus ellioti).
Mr. Arthur Jennings of the School of Veterinary Medicine, Cam-
bridge, has continued his valuable work in conducting post-mortem
examinations, and Mr. W. Barrow has kindly prepared several skins
for the Trust's collection. Your Council is extremely grateful to these
two gentlemen for their co-operation.

During the past year, samples of egg-white from infertile eggs have
been sent to Cornell University, U.S.A., where our Council member
Professor Charles Sibley, is continuing his research into the taxonomic
relationship of birds by means of electrophoresis of egg-white protein.
The work of preparing these samples has been carried out by the
Director's wife.
Over a dozen young Swinhoe's (.Lophura swinhoei) were reared from
cock birds bred from wild caught imported stock mated to home-bred
hens. Twenty-four Swinhoe's were reared in all, and it is anticipated
that this number will be considerably increased next year. Your
Council has therefore approached the Government of Formosa with
a view to sending a number of pairs of these birds back to their native
land to strengthen the wild population. This will only be done if the
Formosan authorities are able to give a satisfactory assurance as to
the safety of the birds. It is hoped that it will be possible to place them
in a National Park or other reserve.
A registration scheme is being formed to provide a record of the
breeding of rare species of game birds in British collections.
Mr. F. E. B. Johnson has agreed to be responsible for keeping the
records and he is at present devising a suitable leg ring for marking
birds. Registration forms will shortly be available and members will
be sent a supply upon request.
The Director has decided to develop some 26 acres of land at Great
Witchingham to provide an extension of the existing waterfowl gardens
and to incorporate new enclosures for a wildlife centre. The public
will be admitted upon payment and members of the Trust will always
be welcome free of charge. Twelve new planted breeding pens, each
measuring 60 by 20 feet, are being erected this winter within the new
park, together with some of the more portable of the Trust's pens.
It is felt that this will enable the public to see and enjoy a representative
collection of the Trust's birds ; while at the same time leaving fifteen
large breeding pens on the undisturbed, private portion of the property.
Of these, ten pens each measuring 60 by 20 feet were constructed early
last spring. Each contains a wooden hut, purchased by the Director
from Leckford Pheasantries, and presented to the Trust. Members of
the Trust will still have access to these as well as to the rearing pens
which will also remain outside the boundaries of the public area.
The new construction will bring the total number of large breeding
pens to twenty-seven. In addition there are a further twenty pens
each measuring 40 by 20 feet made of portable wooden and wire-
netting sections on loan to the Trust from the Director. These pens
are at present roofed with 2-inch mesh wire-netting, but it is hoped
to replace this with nylon netting in the near future. This has the
advantages of being easier to put up and to support, of having a very
long life, of being comparatively cheap, and of causing less harm to

The Painted Spurfowl ( Galloperdix lunulata ) and a number of Indian
Quail were sent by Mr. R. D. Sane, one of our members in Bombay.
The pair of Grey Francolin ( Francolinus afer swynnertoni) were presented
by Mr. Guthrie Hall of Southern Rhodesia. Youi Council is extremely
grateful to these members for their enthusiasm and kindness.
In addition some Rock Partridge ( Alectoris graeca) eggs were received
from the Chief Forest Officer in Cyprus. One chick was hatched from
these and safely reared.

Two of the three young Cabot's Tragopan ( Tragopan caboti) which
were reared from birds imported via Dr. K. C. Searle last winter are
still thriving. Both survivors appear to be hens. Unfortunately the
third succumbed to Pasteurella pseudotuberculosis . It is many years since
this species has been successfully reared in this country.
Seven young Common Koklass ( Purcrasia m. macrolopha) were reared,
five of these, three males and two females, are still thriving. This
species has not been bred before in this country, as far as it is known.
One of the imported Roulrouls laid five eggs scattered in the pen ;
these were set under a bantam, but proved infertile.
Infertility continues to be the chief problem in breeding rare
pheasants, particularly where species have long been in captivity.
We were fortunate in being able to purchase five pairs of Mikado
Pheasants from Leckford when their collection was disbanded.
Fifteen eggs were laid by these birds but only one was fertile, this
hatched and the young bird, which appears to be a hen, has been
successfully reared.
It is interesting to compare the fertility of freshly imported birds
with that of stock long in captivity, and therefore highly inbred. For
example the fertility of both imported Cabot's Tragopan and Common
Koklass (in both cases wild caught birds) was ioo per cent compared
with 7 per cent in Mikado and 43 per cent in Temminck's Tragopan
from many generations of captive birds. At the same time it should be
borne in mind that the birds purchased from Leckford were unable to
be moved, due to fowl pest restrictions, until late in February, when
they joined the collection and were at once put out in large breeding
pens ; even so, they may have had insufficient time in which to settle
down before the breeding season.
One of the disappointments of the summer was the death of our
only female Chinese Bamboo Partridge ( Bambusicola t. thoracica). In
the middle of July a man mowing the grass found her lying dead
beside her nest which contained five eggs, these were too stale to hatch.
A large number of Californian Crested Quail ( Lophortyx c. californica)
and Bobwhite Quail ( Colinus virginianus ) has been reared and in
addition three Chinese Painted Quail ( Excalfactoria chinensis).
The Bornean Great Argus ( Argusianus argus grayi) believed to be the
only pair in captivity in Britain, spent the summer in a large planted
pen, but on 20th July the male went into a deep moult, so there was
no chance of successful breeding this season. Strangely enough the male,
though in fine condition, has never yet been seen to display to his hen.
The female White Crossoptilon ( Crossoptilon c. drouyni) --the only
one of its kind in Western Europe--is doing well. But so far it has not
been possible to procure a mate for her. However M. Jean Delacour
has offered to send a hybrid Blue X White male from Cleres, and it is
thought that this is the best solution for the time being.

Deaths in the collection have not been numerous although unfortu-

species. The following diseases have been responsible for the majority
of these :

The latter, despite the fact that all birds are fed pellets or crumbs
containing Entramin at the preventative level all the time. Unfortu-
nately a female Scintillating Copper Pheasant (Syrmaticus soemmerringi
scintillans) was the last to succumb to this disease, thus leaving the
collection with three males and no females of this species. Since five
young birds were reared in i960, the foregoing shows how quickly a
small captive stock can be wiped out by accident or disease. It is
hoped to import more of this species from Japan.
A pair of Grouse was presented by Mr. Dudley Pinnock of Aberdeen
University, and they make both a welcome and interesting exhibit.
This season a small surplus of the more common species has been
sold to members. As birds become available orders are dealt with in
strict rotation.

THE CARE OF ORNAMENTAL PHEASANTS

<bodyText confidence="0.996908875" page_id="56316997"  page_num="10" year="" vol="">
It is easier to care for pheasants in captivity in these days than it
has been at any time in the past. So far as feeding is concerned science
has come to the aid of the pheasant breeder more, perhaps, than to
any other avicultural specialist. This is entirely due to the immense
amount of research that has been devoted to the poultry and turkey
industry.
Turning first to the question of housing, it has been found that the
following are the essential requirements to be borne in mind :--
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.984710142857143" page_id="56316997"  page_num="10" year="" vol="">
(1) With the exception of certain subspecies of Phasianus colchicus ,
pheasants are woodland birds, and therefore require trees or shrubs
in their aviaries.
(2) Most species are completely hardy and can, in fact, withstand
exposure to lower temperatures than domestic poultry.
(3) Lack of shade is more harmful to most species than exposure
to adverse weather.
(4) Protection from severe winds is necessary.
(5) The birds must be provided with suitable nesting sites.
(6) A few species need heat in winter, or at least protection from
frost, but it should be remembered that fresh air is vital ; no bird
should ever be subjected to a stuffy atmosphere.
(7) The enclosures must be made vermin-proof.
(8) Precautions must be taken to prevent the introduction of
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.989916368421052" page_id="56316997"  page_num="10" year="" vol="">
infection from outside sources.
Ideally, a pheasant aviary should be a large enclosure, as large as
possible, with a roomy and dry but airy shed with facilities for dust
bathing. The aviary should be well planted with shrubs, including
evergreens, but should be free from decaying vegetation which might
cause fungal infection, and yet it should have sufficient vegetable
growth to provide insects and green food.
The sides of the aviaries should be of wire netting ; J or J in. mesh
is best where cost is no object but I have found 1 inch mesh to be
perfectly satisfactory. It is advisable to board up the walls to a height
of about 1 foot all round. It is also a good plan to make sure that the
wire netting extends outwards along the ground to the extent of 1 foot
all round the outside of the block. This is a much quicker procedure
than sinking the netting in the ground, and appears to be equally
effective in keeping out vermin.
Made-up sections as used by game farmers can be bought and
joined together with stakes and bolts, and this will be found to save
a great deal of time and trouble and add very little to the cost. An
aviary 40 feet long by 20 feet wide is of sufficient size to accommodate

F. E. B. JOHNSON-THE CARE OF ORNAMENTAL PHEASANTS I I
a breeding pair of most species, while 20 by 10 feet is ample space
for pairs of Edwards's, Swinhoe's, Amherst's, and Goldens.
Nearly all my aviaries are now roofed with 1 inch mesh nylon
netting which has many advantages, but I have not used it long
enough to say that there are no pitfalls. Netting of larger mesh will
keep the pheasants in, of course, but in order to minimize the risk of
infectious diseases it is advisable to keep out wild birds, and 1 inch
mesh netting will only allow an occasional sparrow to enter.
Shrubs should be planted in the pens, and evergreens are best but
most are slow growing. Lonicera nitida provides dense cover and is easy
to grow and cheap to buy. Attractive flowering shrubs will enhance
the appearance of the aviaries but take time to establish. Until the
shrubs are large enough to provide effective cover, branches of fir or
other evergreens can be placed in the aviary as a temporary measure.
Shelters should be provided but these need not be elaborate. The
birds will nearly always roost on top of them but after a night of
continuous rain it does give the pheasants a chance to get dry during
the day. A small bantam house is very satisfactory.
As I have said, feeding these days is comparatively simple. All old
books on pheasants state that the basic food is grain. Probably very
few, if any, pheasants in their natural homes ever see any grain at all,
and as most occur either in dense jungle or at high to moderate
altitudes where the slopes are thickly wooded their food consists of
seeds, leaves, fruit, and insects.
In captivity this diet is probably best represented by a proprietory
brand of turkey " breeders " pellets given liberally at a morning feed
and a small quantity of grain in the afternoon. One cannot overfeed
with these properly balanced pellets except to the extent of wasting
the food, although it should be remembered that stale food left on
the ground will quickly decay and may cause fungal infections. Too
much corn, however, although not likely to decay will soon render
the birds fat and incapable of breeding. The correct amount of food
to give can only be discovered by trial and error. A successful breeder
of any livestock will find this out for himself by watching his stock
when he is feeding.
Basically I feed all my adult pheasants as above, but Tragopans
have fruit of various sorts in addition and Peacock Pheasants require
a higher protein diet, supplied by the addition of mealworms and
meatmeal. They also require fruit but eat very little greenfood.
Young chicks and growing poults should be fed a different ration.
I find turkey or pheasant starter crumbs containing a coccidiostat and
antibiotic very satisfactory for chicks up to about eight weeks of age,
and then the birds should be changed gradually to turkey rearing
pellets. I always use a brand containing the anti-blackhead drug
Entramin.

12 F. E. B. JOHNSON-THE CARE OF ORNAMENTAL PHEASANTS
The chicks of certain species of pheasants require live food during
the first ten days or so of their lives and I have found mealworms the
easiest way of providing this. They are clean, easy to obtain, and
inexpensive. The young of Monals, Tragopans, Peacock Pheasants,
and Elliot's Pheasants should always be provided with live food.
It should not be forgotten that flint grit is essential to all pheasants,
and in addition limestone or oystershell must be provided just before
and during laying.
Leaving the question of the general care of pheasants in captivity,
I am tempted to think ahead and to suggest that there is a great deal
more scope for the specialist pheasant breeder in the field of con-
servation than is at first visualized. To take the Blood Pheasants
( Ithaginis ) as an example ; how many of us have seen these alive ?
I have not ; it is quite evident from the skins that they are birds of
exceptional beauty. So far as I am aware no recent attempt has been
made to establish these birds in aviculture. All earlier attempts failed
as they were found to be very susceptible to infection at low altitudes,
but who knows what might not be done now with rapid air transport
and the use of antibiotics and modern drugs. I have made several
attempts to import these birds but have not yet found anyone able to
get them for me.
The situation with Tragopans is a little better, but not much when
it comes down to hard facts. I believe there are a number of Satyr
Tragopans in America, but in England we have less than twenty, and
up to this year this number only included one pair of breeding age.
Temminck's were once firmly established, but the present stock is very
inbred and badly needs fresh blood from China, Assam, or Burma.
The Pheasant Trust has bred the gorgeous Cabot's, but there must be
less than a dozen of these in captivity anywhere in the world. I do not
think there are any breeding pairs of Blyth's at present. I am hoping
to get some soon, but they are not even caught yet !
The Western Tragopan may even be extinct, and many other
species of pheasants, including those mentioned above, must be ever
decreasing in numbers owing to the continual encroachment of
civilization on their mountain and jungle habitats. It will be seen,
therefore, that tremendous opportunities exist for pheasant enthusiasts
in the field of conservation.
In conclusion, two questions may provide further food for thought.
It is believed that there are two pure strains of Amherst's Pheasants in
the country, but are there any truly pure Goldens ? Secondly, are
there any pure " True " pheasants of the genus Phasianus ? We know
that " Mongolians ", " Chinese," etc. can be obtained readily enough,
but I suspect that all of them have had introductions at one time or
another of the English feral blood, and are now merely breeds, bred
by selection to more or less the right colour.

(.Rollulus roulroul)
By Dr. K. C. Searle (Hong Kong)
This, one of the most beautiful partridges in the world, is well
known to aviculture although it has never been common in collections
and has a reputation for being somewhat delicate.
The species is found throughout the Malaysian Sub-region extending
into Thailand, some islands of the Mergui Archipelago, and the
extreme south of Tenasserim. Abundant throughout most of its
range it is a bird of old forests and bamboo groves, being commonly
found where there have been clearings in primary jungle. It is found
from sea-level to 4,000 feet. From the nature of its habitat the bird is
more often heard than seen ; anyone who has spent sufficient time in
the jungles of Borneo or other parts of its range will have surprised
family parties which scatter rapidly when alarmed. Although rarely
seen and difficult of approach they are easily taken in snare lines.
Smythies describes this species as " the partridge throughout the
lowland forests " in Borneo. However, this was not my experience
when collecting along the Kalabakan River in 1959. The Chestnut-
breasted Tree Partridge (Arborophila charltoni) was heard calling
everywhere and as against one Roulroul snared we took a dozen of
the former. Despite the wide range from the mainland of Asia through
the islands of Malaysia no sub-species are described. I have personally
handled birds from Thailand, Sumatra, and Borneo and my impression
was that those from Sumatra were a little larger, but without com-
paring a large series this cannot be considered significant.
The male is a handsome bird. Ten inches long with a small decurved
black and red bill, the legs, feet, and a patch of bare skin around the
eyes are bright scarlet. The long, decomposed occipital crest is dark
red reminding one very much of the horse hair plumes on a Roman
helmet. There are also long hair-like bristles on the forehead and
these are separated from the crest proper by a white patch on the crown.
The rest of the head, neck, tail, and the underparts are black. Upper-
parts are dark blue with a high, glossy sheen passing to green on the
lower back and rump. The wings are brownish black. In the female
the occipital crest is absent but the frontal bristles are present, the
head is grey and the mantle, back, tail, and underparts green. The
wings are bright cinnamon. Legs and feet scarlet as in the male, a
smaller area of scarlet skin around the eye but the bill is entirely black.
Newly trapped birds are impossibly wild and, unless great care is
taken to protect them from self-mutilation, broken scalps, foreheads,
and ceres soon result. Freshly caught birds can soon be persuaded to

K. C. SEARLE--THE ROULROUL
and dealers are usually pitifully thin having been offered nothing but
padi rice and, if lucky, millet seed. Attempts to keep this species on
grain alone for any length of time are doomed to failure. Here in
Hong Kong my birds are given mixed grain (wheat, peas, crushed
maize, padi rice, and millet) chopped papaya, apple, and green
vegetables, a high protein soft food as used for small insectivorous
birds, dried flies and live grasshoppers. When housed in a mixed
collection they will also take minced or chopped raw lean beef and
hard-boiled egg. Highly insectivorous, I have seen birds chasing
butterflies and moths in a planted flight, leaping into the air to catch
the flying insects. My experience has been that properly fed, Roulrouls
are not delicate and specimens that have been received in very poor
condition, weak and emaciated, become unrecognizable in a few days
if allowed to gorge themselves on live insects and fruit.
Despite initial wildness a little care soon renders them absurdly
tame. If turned into large planted flights with plenty of low cover, the
birds will, in the space of a few weeks walk around ones feet to receive
live food. I clip one wing before turning out newly received birds in
this manner to prevent broken heads if they become alarmed and fly
against the wire. Just how tame they can become will be easily
realized by those who saw the pair shown at the " National Cage
Birds Exhibition" in 1956 and 1957 by Raymond Sawyer. These
birds successfully reared young in a small indoor flight.
Males are savage fighters pecking their opponents around the head
and eyes. If housed with a number of females a mate is selected and
the rest ignored. At the time of writing I have an old male housed
with seven females ; he consorts entirely with one hen and the other
six move around in a compact party. As a temporary expedient four
or five males can be run together provided no hens are present.
Great scratchers, paired cocks are very solicitous, calling the hens with
a low whistle to feed where they have turned over the ground, the
whole being accompanied with much rapid tail-wagging by both
birds. At night the highest possible perch is selected for roosting when
a characteristic attitude is assumed--bill well tucked into the chest
and tail curved forward under the branch. When frightened Roulrouls
run very fast in a straight line with a high stepping gait ; at other
times progress is slow, interrupted frequently by pauses to scratch and
dig. They are quite inoffensive, completely ignoring quail, pittas,
thrushes, doves, rails, or other small ground-frequenting species.
Breeding under controlled conditions has been successful on several
occasions. Those of which I have knowledge were by the late Herbert
Whitley at Primley, Rotterdam Zoo in 1953, and most years since
(including three reared in 1961), Wassenaar, 1955 and 1956, and two
successful breedings by Raymond Sawyer in 1956 and 1957. The
latter seems to me a particularly commendable effort, the birds being

housed in relatively small indoor flights. An intricate domed nest was
constructed by the female of this pair and after an initial failure eggs
were hatched under a bantam. Newly hatched chicks are very
insectivorous and Sawyer found live ant cocoons of great use during
the first few days.
Anyone in possession of a well-established, tame pair of Roulrouls
stands a good chance of breeding this species. A well planted flight
with low thick cover, liberal supplies of live food to bring the pair into
high breeding condition seem to be the important points to achieve
pairing and egg production. My own choice thereafter would be a
suitably small bantam and a heated coop for rearing.

III. Bob white Quails ( Colinus)
The quails of this genus are excellent game birds, and the North
American species, which extends to Mexico, is particularly popular
with sportsmen. They are rather smaller and have a shorter crest
than the Western quails. They comprise one genus and four species,
with a large number of subspecies, particularly in the southern parts of
North America, and they extend to northern South America in
Colombia, Venezuela, the Guianas, and the adjacent border of Brazil ;
but they are not found in the west of the United States.
Bobwhites are birds of open and cultivated countries wherever high
weeds and brush exist. They occupy also open woodlands and
pastures, but are more abundant around fields where they find better
food. Out of the breeding season they live in coveys. They roost at
night on the ground, in grass or weeds. They eat seeds, with green
food, berries, a few insects, and require water to drink.

1 6 J. DELACOUR--THE AMERICAN QUAILS
Northern Bob whites (Colinus virginianus)
These quails are famous in the Eastern, Mid Western, and Southern
States, as well as in Cuba and Mexico, and they are probably the
best game bird of this vast area. They have been introduced success-
fully into several western States and West Indian islands ; also in
Europe, where, so far, they have failed to be satisfactorily established.
They vary tremendously in colour from north to south, and there are
nearly twenty recognizable subspecies.
In the typical northern race, which occupies practically the whole
of the United States, the male has a black crest, broad white eyebrows
and throat, surrounded by dark brown and black bands, mottled
chestnut crown and upper parts, a chestnut breast-band and sides,
white underparts marked with black and brown ; the female has
buffy yellow eyebrows and throat and pale grey underparts. There is
a reddish (erythrystic) variety which has been fixed by selection, in
which a rich chestnut extends to all the underparts. Florida birds
[floridanus] are darker and more barred underneath. The Cuban race
(cubanensis ) has the underparts chestnut, marked with black and white,
but it varies a great deal, probably because of the introduction of
northern birds. Those from Texas and New Mexico ( texanus) are
intermediate. There are several races in Mexico with more or less
plain red underparts and a black breast, and in the western parts of
the country, others with black throat and pure chestnut underparts,
the best known of which, ridgwayi, inhabiting southern Arizona and
northern Sonora and almcst extinct, still is reared in captivity in the
United States.
All these Bobwhites live well in aviaries and can be reared easily.
The Black-throated Bob white (C. nigrogularis ) is found in
Yucatan and the lowlands of Guatemala (Peten) and Honduras. It has
similar habits and it resembles the above species, but the male has a
black throat and the underparts are white laced with black. They live
in the same sort of country and possess similar habits.
The Central American Bobwhites (C. leucopogon ) are greyer, with
white eyebrows and throat, and they have the underparts boldly
spotted with creamy white. The race hypoleucus , from Salvador, is
white underneath, while other races have darker brown underparts, in
Nicaragua and Costa Rica ( leylandi , dickeyi). They have seldom been
kept in captivity, but are not difficult to rear.
The Crested Bobwhites (C. cristatus) range from Panama to
northern South America. They have a longer, creamy or brownish-
white crest and a whitish crown ; resembling the other species
they are more heavily spotted underneath. The northernmost races
show a reddish brown throat and the ground colour underneath is
chestnut ; the females are lighter. Other races have a white throat

and are paler. The Guiana race ( sonninii ) is pale and greyish, but it
has a light chestnut throat. Various races have been kept and reared
in captivity, particularly sonninii , decoratus , leucotis , and littoralis
(Colombia) ; cristatus (Venezuela).
IV. Forest Quails ( Odontophorus)
The large quails of this genus inhabit the tropical rain forests and
their range extends from southern Mexico to southern Brazil, northern
Argentine, Paraguay, Bolivia, and Peru. They live on the ground in
small parties or in pairs, in the shade. They, however, fly rapidly
when disturbed. They have a loud call of six notes (in the species
guttatus) often repeated. They scratch loose ground littered with dead
leaves for small bulbs, seeds, roots, and insects. They are not easy
to detect.
Forest Quails are rather large, the size of partridges, and have
a very strong, thick bill and large, powerful feet. The head is
adorned with a broad, short nuchal crest, often invisible. The body
is heavy and the tail short. They live well in captivity but seldom, if
ever, breed. In aviaries, they are apt to pick out the bark of trees and
shrubs, but do no harm to other birds. They are seldom available, as
they seem difficult to capture and do not prove very popular because
of their heavy shape and dark colours. They are, however, quite
handsome in their elegant tones and markings. Both sexes are alike in
most cases. This genus is a large one, with some fifteen species, some
of them having a number of geographical races.
Guiana Forest Quail (0. gujanensis)
This species ranges from Costa Rica to the Amazon River, Peru,
and Bolivia, with no less than nine geographical subspecies. It has a
dark chestnut crest ; mottled brown upperparts with a reddish rump ;
wings brown spotted and barred buff; chin, cheeks more or less barred
and spotted ; throat chestnut ; underparts pale reddish brown,
bare skin round the eyes bright red. It is imported from time to time.
Capueira Forest Quail [ 0 . capueira )
Inhabits eastern Brazil, differing from gujanensis only by its grey
underparts. Has been imported occasionally.
Red-headed Forest Quail (0. erythrops)
From Central America and W. Ecuador, they have a reddish
chestnut crown, dark brown underparts, and black throat and chestnut
underparts.
0. hyperhythrus from Colombia ; 0. speciosus from E. Ecuador and
E. Peru, are very similar and probably conspecific ; the former has
blackish crown and underparts, the throat and upper breast alone
being chestnut ; the back is lighter throughout. 0 . melanonotus , from

O. loricatus (Bolivia) ; 0 . parambae (Ecuador), and 0 . strophium
(Colombia) are closely related ; all have black throats and upper
breast, with a large white patch in the middle ; their crown and
underparts vary from chestnut to black or blackish brown.
0 . atrifrons (Colombia) ; 0 . leucolaemus (Costa Rica and Panama) ;
0 . columbianus (N. Venezuela), have a white throat and white markings
underneath ; leucolaemus is almost black, the others lighter.

Central America, are medium sized, with a weak bill, very large feet,
and a short tail. They are brown, mottled and streaked darker and
lighter ; crown and cheeks brown ; eyebrows and throat tawny
cinnamon. They live in high and dense forests or humid canyons,
being found at low level in Yucatan only, where a paler race ( sharpei )
occurs. They seldom fly, running and hiding when disturbed, so that
they are difficult to procure. They have quite a song, more melodious
and complicated than in any other game bird. They dig their food
with their powerful feet in the forest litters.
VI. Large-billed Quails ( Rhynchortyx )
The small Rhynchortyx cinctus, from Central America, Panama, W.
Colombia, and N.W. Ecuador, have a very large and heavy bill.
They resemble Odontophorus in the colour of their upperparts. The
males have cinnamon eyebrows and cheeks, and grey breasts and a
cinnamon abdomen, turning white on the vent ; the female has
spotted black and white eyebrows and cheeks, a brown breast, and
mottled black and white underparts. It is a forest bird.

round in shape, with a thick, short bill and a very short tail. The
males have a remarkable pattern of black and white lines and patches
on the head and throat, the sides of the breast and abdomen boldly
spotted with white, the middle being a rich chestnut; a short, thick,
recumbent, light brown crest; the upperparts barred light and dark
brown, with large dark spots and white or cinnamon streaks. The
females are like the males above but are streaked brown and buff
below, the face and throat buff, and the underparts greyish cinnamon,
spotted or streaked with black.
The northern races ( mearnsi , from S. Arizona, New Mexico, Texas,
and northern Mexico ; montezumae , from central Mexico) have the
background colour of the sides black ; the northern race is a little
darker. The form sallei , from W. Mexico (Guerrero) differs in having
the sides of the breast grey spotted white, and those of the abdomen
grey spotted with golden cinnamon ; the abdomen is a lighter
chestnut.
The Ocellated Quail (C. ocellatus) from S. Mexico, Guatemala,
Honduras, and N. Nicaragua, is similar, but differs in having much
less white marking on the head, more distinctly spotted upperparts
with large chestnut streaks, and grey breast sides ocellated with buff,
the dots changing to chestnut along the abdomen ; the upper breast
is pale cinnamon, turning to chestnut lower below. The female is
much as in montezumae , rather more clearly spotted underneath.
Massena's Quails are mountain birds, not found below 5,000 feet.
They occur in small coveys of five to ten birds in the temperate
pine-oak upland, but never in great numbers. They are entirely
ground dwellers and only take short, swift flights when almost trod on.
They lay white eggs, contrary to most other American Quails. The
cock is an excellent father and helps rear the brood with great care.
They feed mostly on small bulbs. Grazing cattle have done a lot of
harm to these beautiful quails, which are becoming scarce in many
areas ; they live and breed well in captivity, but they require a good
deal of care because of their very quiet and shy disposition.

By R. R. P. van der Mark (Woerden, Holland)
Tragopans, or Horned Pheasants, form a compact genus of five
distinct species, living along the Himalayan Range, from Kashmir in
the west, through Burma to Central China, where they are found on
the higher mountains in the area bounded by Shensi on the north,
Fokien on the east, Kwangsi and Yunnan, extending south through the
latter provinces into Northern Tonkin.
Tragopans are mountain birds, living at altitudes from 3,000 to
12,000 feet, according to localities and seasons, in chilly and often
damp forests ; they feed mostly on buds and leaves, but they also eat
berries, seeds, and insects.
Jamrach reports that he landed about 1,200 Tragopans in England
between 1864 and 1882 and between 1920 and 1940 several dozens were
sent each year from Calcutta, where Afghans and other hill natives
bring them every winter. Unfortunately losses were very high because
of improper crating and feeding, and of contamination through
domestic fowls.
The first world war wiped out most of the European stock, as did the
second world war and even now all species still are very rare and high
in price, as new importations are scarce, forbidden, or impossible to
deliver. Happily, in Holland, some years ago a few pairs of
Temminck's and Satyr Tragopans were obtainable. Having learned
how to house and maintain them in good health from Mr. Terry
Jones of Leckford (who was a very successful breeder of Temminck's
Tragopans through the years, sending birds of this species all over
the world) I started this side line of my waterfowl collection by
breeding with a pair of both species.
Active and robust birds, Tragopans need lots of room, inside and
especially outside, where a generous pen, well planted with shrubs,
trees, flowers, and grass, is at their disposition.
Thickly feathered, seeking the shade during hot parts of the day,
they come to life in the early morning and afternoon, walking the
branches, flying from limb to limb, or along the ground in long, noisy
observation hops, to see into the adjoining enclosures. Very gentle,
never nervous, and of infinite variety and mood, the cocks soon become
tame with proffered titbit, flying to the shoulder, where they perch,
breasts awash with crimson fire, each feather tipped with a shining drop
of melted pearl. . . . their black eyes sparkle with satanic fun, while the
quiet hens, in modest brown, slip from the sheltering grasses and feed
out of my hand! After their downy phase, young cocks of four months
can be distinguished from the young hens, by the black bar on the
tail-feathers and the orange-red feathers on the throat, coming out

slowly here and there. Young cocks stand higher, look more forward
than the gentle young hens with their smaller faces. The cocks assume
their full adult plumage in the second year.
As my colleague breeder Dayton O. Hyde in the U.S.A. wrote the
other day, much has been written of the Tragopan display, wherein the
male, in a jerking, spasmodic dance, pumps a rush of blood into its
distending wattle, which aprons over its breast like some strange,
gaudy coat of arms, a heraldic blue and red, while blue horns rise
like a miracle from its crown, as the photo taken in my aviary shows.
The whole display is over as suddenly as it started and the vision is as
hard to recapture as a passing dream ; it is seen even in autumn,
especially in the early morning or evening;, when the sun is sinking.
Sometimes Tragopans nest on the ground, but they prefer to nest in
trees or shrubs. A basket, high on the wall, gave me the best results
the three years I bred Tragopans, though sometimes an egg was laid
in the open aviary ; so you must look after them well in April, when
each hen, at intervals of four to ten days, lays a total of ca. eight
eggs, buff-coloured, irregularly dotted and blotched with reddish brown.
Sometimes a year-old hen will lay, but in general hens of two years
and more produce good, fertile eggs which are exceptionally brooded
by the hen, but mostly by a foster-mother, such as Sussex and other
Bantams. The rufous brown, pale buff, and dark rufous chicks hatch
after ca. twenty-eight days.
In contradiction to the statement printed on page 61 of The Pheasants
of the World , by J. Delacour, all my Tragopan chicks ate the first day of
their life, getting a small quantity of chopped stinging nettle, dandelion,
milfoil, and some spoonfuls of pheasant rearing feed, including
Enheptin against blackhead. Clear, not too cold water stands at their
disposal.
Tragopan chicks need a lot of heat during the months of their slow
growth and I think bad breeding results of several possessors of these
beautiful birds are due to this. So give the chicks as much extra heat as
you can, especially during the rainy cold days in our country, by an
extra heater or central heating in the aviary, as I can do, warming up
the temperature to 2 h ]*-2 &amp;gt; o* C. during the day. In this temperature the
chicks will leave the Bantam, looking for food and water, playing in
the sand and having a good appetite !
No seeds, no starchy food, as the liver and the pancreas are not ready
for them and no hard coagulated proteins such as boiled eggs are neces-
sary, they are even forbidden, as Madame Malisoux, one of the older
successful breeders of Tragopans writes. Wheat, finely broken maize,
crushed hemp, shelled oats, and later on all other seeds, if not too big,
can be given to the chicks, and fresh fruit and berries may be added,
and given to the parents the whole year round. Tragopans can and must
eat a fair quantity of green food daily; salad, endive, a clump of stinging

nettle, as long as this weed is obtainable, grass, together with some
Universal feed and a handful of wheat in the evening, making them
not too fat.
Personally I like the deep crimson-red of the male Satyr Tragopan
most, but he lacks the blue " face " of the Temminck's. Both species
have a charming gentleness, become confident and tame and for that
reason, and also because of their extreme beauty, Tragopans will remain
favourites with aviculturists all over the world, as I learn from my
export orders. The more yellow-orange coloured Blyth's Tragopan is
extremely rare now and having a female I am urgently looking for a
male. A few months have to pass, then the wah-ooh-wah love call of
the cocks will be heard again, the miraculous sound of a beautiful
creation of Nature.

By Terry Jones (Stockbridge, Hants., England)
The Director of the Pheasant Trust suggested I should write an
article on the Peacock Pheasants, but to what has been written about
them in the Magazine, the O.P.S. Journal, and Delacour's Monograph,
I could add perhaps another sentence. Instead, I thought I would
like to pay tribute to two people who have done a great deal for
present-day pheasant stocks both in Europe and America, and to say
something of their methods.
Mr. Milligan came to Leckford to take charge of the aviary collection
in 1936 or 1937. Before coming here he had worked at Cleres for
M. Delacour and before that for Mme Lecallier who had a great
breeding collection of aviary birds of many species. During the war
Mrs. Milligan joined him, and between them they kept a nucleus of
the collection going, he working all the war years without a holiday
and I believe without even a complete day off. It was owing to their
tireless energy and great skill that over 400 Temminck's Tragopans
and over 200 Mikado were sent out from Leckford, as well as good
numbers of several other species such as Edwards's, Elliot's, and
Swinhoe's, and Chinquis Peacock Pheasants. He also reared before
the war about a dozen Palawan Peacocks and the first Ocellated

was carefully tested, not as to how much labour it saved, but as to
whether jobs done with its aid had the same meticulous results. They
destroyed the pleasure I might have got from seeing many other
collections because the standards of hygiene I took for granted are in
fact far from universal ! And successful bird keeping is not so much
a matter of secret knowledge as of the ability to observe. Now for
some of their methods.
Pheasants spend a great deal of their time running up and down
their fences. If a little trench is taken out right round the edge of the
aviary or pen and is then refilled with coarse gravel, this will stop the
birds making muddy tracks, and it can easily be taken out now and
again and renewed as the bulk of the daytime droppings are shed on it.
Perches should be regularly renewed and/or washed with disin-
fectant. Pheasants take up a lot of dirt on their feet and they also like
wiping their beaks and eyes on the perches. Never feed pheasants on
the ground, even with grain, most pheasant diseases are soil borne,
always feed them in tins or dishes placed in their shelters where the
food is out of the weather. I am very sensitive to dirty or badly placed
water pots ! The Milligans scrubbed or had scrubbed every food and
water pot first thing every morning. A churn brush fits perfectly
between the spout stays of an old fashioned watering can and woe
betide any lad who went off with the can and without the churn brush.
The water dish was kept outside in the shade of a bush, and twenty
odd years after they were bought from Woolworths, they are as bright
and clean inside and outside as the day they were bought.
If the pheasants regularly roost on the same perch, put a piece of
slate or asbestos underneath so the droppings can be cleared away
each day. Keep the grass in the pens short with a rotoscythe and rake
up and clear away the cuttings. Do not overfeed, pick up any uneaten
food in the evening. Cock pheasants of many species often scalp their
hens. Have one or two cages like rabbit hutches ready to house
casualties or sick birds ; a piece of light cloth can be hung over the
front to give the bird a sense of privacy without shutting out the light.
If a cock has attacked his hen, one can generally get her before the
blood has dried. Roll the hen, with her legs behind her under her tail,
quite tightly in a cloth or sack, she then cannot move. Very gently
bathe her scalp with a piece of cotton wool and with warm water to
remove any dirt, blood, etc. Then very gently with a needle and fine
thread pull together the various bits of skin, knotting each stitch
separately. Dab the finished job freely with a piece of cotton wool
soaked in iodine, release the hen gently into her cage. Provided one
has found her before the wound has hardened, it almost always heals
and leaves no trace. Sultanas are a good titbit for her. But as a
precautionary move, place fans of brushwood in all corners of the
aviary and shelter so the hen has plenty of spots to dive into. If the

cock is known to be spiteful, clip his wing and leave the hen her
powers of flight and, if you can, give him several hens so he can use
up his energies chasing first one and then another till he tires first.
If you hatch or rear with bantams, keep them clean ; chicken fleas &amp;gt;
thrive on pheasants. Every nest is cleaned out every week and the
clean hay freely sprinkled with louse powder. We also have one of i
those bellows you fill with louse powder. When you take a broody
from the hen house, blast her gently with it under her feathers from
head to tail. Be stricter about the chicks' hygiene. If you rear out of
doors, use fresh ground to which neither adult pheasants, poultry, nor
any gallinaceous birds have had access. Move daily and keep handy
one of the turkey preparations for dealing with blackhead as the
disease strikes suddenly, Swinhoe's being particularly subject.
There is nothing new in any of this advice, but the uniqueness of
the Leckford aviaries under the Milligans' care was that all sixty odd
of them always looked as though they were ready for a royal inspection,
and that is why I think the Milligans' regime must have been very
nearly unique.

nine races make up the species Excalfactoria chinensis and the range
extends over a large part of south-eastern Asia and as far southward
as eastern Australia.
The races and their distribution are :--

It appears to be monogamous and the nest, a depression in the
ground under a tuft of grass, is thinly lined with grass stems. The
clutch is said to number four to six, though more have been recorded
among captive birds, and the eggs olive-brown speckled with reddish-
brown or, according to Swinhoe, uniform olive-brown.
The food consists of the seeds of grasses and other small plants
together with insect life.
The bird is generally known in England as the Chinese Painted
Quail and it would, of course, have been the nominate race that was
so often imported and still is to some extent. In Australia, King Quail,
Chestnut-bellied, Least, Dwarf, and Swamp Quail are the names given.
The first recorded breeding in this country took place in 1898 when
Meade-Waldo succeeded and was awarded the Avicultural Society's
medal. His account appeared in the Magazine for that year and parts
of it are quoted. " The cock bird is a very old one, and has wintered
out for several years (including the bitter winter of 1895), in the
East Riding of Yorkshire. The hen was kindly presented to me this
spring .... When placed together, the little birds paired at once :
the cock holding any little tit-bit in his beak, with his head held on
one side, uttering a low crooning sound until the hen ran up and took
it from him.
A nest was scratched in the turf, and the first egg laid on 12th June ;
twenty-one eggs were laid by 3rd July, on which day the hen com-
menced to sit. As the number of eggs seemed so disproportionate to
the size of the bird, I removed ten, leaving eleven in the nest. The
hen made up the nest by drawing in grass stems and the like, but no
feathers were added .... The hen sat exceedingly well, the cock
occasionally sitting by her side, but never on the eggs.
On 23rd July the hen came off with seven young ones, leaving one
dead in the nest. These little birds were most marvellously active and
independent, being able to run quite as fast as the parents on the day
of hatching. They were, of course, very small indeed .... They were
dark chocolate in colour, with two broad dull yellow lines down the
back, and three yellow stripes on the head. They fed principally on
ants' eggs--part of an ants' nest being supplied twice a day ; they
also ate the ants themselves. From the first, however, they would eat
mawseed, also the seeds of various weeds. Their growth was most
wonderfully rapid, as will be seen by the following dates :--
Hatched on 23rd July ; 5th August, full fledged, able to fly well ;
13th August, the two young cocks easily distinguishable from the hens ;
20th August, full grown and almost in full plumage ; 27th August,
young cocks in full plumage, indistinguishable from the parent, and
crowing and calling the hens to feed. ... at five weeks old they were
apparently adult.
A prettier sight than this little family are now, can hardly be

imagined. To escape the burning sun of the last few weeks they have
made little runs through the grass of their lawn, like those made by
colonies of field voles. They have little seats under tufts of grass, and
in looking at the grass nothing whatever is visible. Suddenly a little
head pokes up through the grass and crows ; then another and
another peer out in different places, and answer ; then they all settle
down again ....
Occasionally two sit in the same little form, but usually only one.
I forgot to describe the eggs, which were yellowish stone colour, !
covered with small spots and dots of very dark brown."
The Painted Quail has been bred on a number of occasions since
then, of course. The chicks in their early days are easily able to walk
through \ in. mesh wire netting ; also they are readily eaten by the
larger insectivorous birds.
The soil of the aviary containing Painted Quail needs to be well
drained, and a well lighted and ventilated, yet draught-proof shelter
is necessary with suitable cover (clumps of long grass) in two of the
corners where the birds may roost in comfort and perhaps nest during
the summer. Some grass in the outer part of the aviary would provide
a suitable habitat.
A variety of small seeds such as millet mixed with the finely broken
grains (wheat, groats, maize, etc.) that may still sometimes be used
for the feeding of domestic chicks would be a suitable food, with some
insectile mixture and some green food such as chickweed, clumps of
seeding annual meadow grass, shepherd's purse, etc. added. The
" crumbs " used for the feeding of domestic chicks would be a balanced
diet, but it might be necessary to condition the birds to eating it by
mixing in some of the food to which they have been accustomed.
Needless to say, fresh ant cocoons are a favourite food, and especially
valuable in the rearing of young. Fine grit is essential and, of course,
a shallow dish of clean water.

(Lagonosticta rara)
By Sir Richard Cotterell, Bt. (Hereford, England)
Description (Adult male). Upper-parts, breast, and sides of the body
pinkish crimson, brighter on the upper tail-coverts. The wings brown--
lesser coverts tipped with crimson. Tail full and black with outer
edges crimson. Middle of belly and under tail-coverts black. Flanks
black tipped with crimson ; thighs black. Eye black. Bill, upper
mandible black, lower horn coloured. Legs dark brown.
The adult female has the head grey-brown, the mantle, back, and
scapulars washed vinous, tail-coverts brighter. Wings brown and tail
black. In front of the eye a conspicuous spot of crimson. Chin and
throat greyish-brown merging into bullish underparts, the breast and
sides of the body washed vinous. Bill similar to male.
Range and distribution. Northern Nigeria to Northern Uganda.
A high-grass-country bird. Not much is known of its nesting habits.
I obtained a pair of these birds (the first I had ever seen), at the end
of July, i960. They were turned out almost immediately into a garden
aviary by themselves. Though very wild, they went to nest almost
at once. This nest was built in some larch branches inside the shelter.
It was made of grass, spherical in shape, with a hole in the side and
lined with feathers. Nothing came of this nest, the young being found
dead when about four days old.
They made a second effort on the ground outside in a patch of rough
grass. This also came to nothing, as I did not know it was there--
and shut them up in the shelter at night, as it was late on in the season.
So ended i960.
They were caught up in the late autumn and spent the winter
months with a mixed collection of other Waxbills in an adjoining
bigger aviary, of which the shelter temperature was thermostatically
controlled at not below 55 0 F. They were so wild that I very nearly
got rid of them in the spring, but decided that I would give them
another chance.
On 20th May they were again transferred into an aviary by them-
selves, they were in heavy moult at the time. This time I arranged
that the ground in the outside flight should consist of some short grass,
some clumps of long grass, and some bare ground.
On 27th July, I returned home after a few days away, and only one
bird was visible at a time. Therefore it was obvious that they were
sitting on a nest in one of the patches of rough grass. Both birds
incubated alternately. But, in spite of watching very carefully, I never
saw them change over. Nor for a long time could I discover in which
patch of grass the nest was.

On 21 st August four young fledged ; they appeared very immature
and helpless, and wild as hawks. They were much smaller than the
parents, greyish-brown round the head and bib, the remainder mouse
brown, with a very short black tail, upper tail-coverts rusty red.

3rd September (thirteen days after the first brood had fledged), the

on the part of the old birds, as meadow-ant cocoons were no longer

available. So apart from what insects they found for themselves, they
had only mealworms on which to rear the brood.
I removed the first brood from the aviary a week before the second
brood fledged. They have now completed their moult, and I cannot
see any difference between them and an adult female--even to the
crimson spot in front of the eye, so either they are four young females
or else that is the immature plumage--I do not know.
The second brood now (14th October), do not appear as vigorous
as the first--this may be due to lack of insect food on which to rear
them. But we shall see.
Points of interest as regards this bird from a very limited experience :
(1) They appear to be by nature very timid, also very terrestrial
in their habits, in that they often hide on the ground away from any 1
intruder.
(2) I have never heard the male sing--though their call note--
Chew-chew Chew, Chew-chew is continuous especially when
alarmed.
(3) Although excellent parents they are very secretive about their
nesting activities. Despite the fact that I watched very carefully
I saw the cock approach the nest only once, and that was with a
feather for nest lining, and I had to hide myself a long distance away
to get that view. Incubation and feeding of the young is by both
birds. They appear to have no set times for incubation. Incubation
period fourteen days, and about eighteen days as nestlings.
(4) As regards food, they lived on Pannicum Millet and Spray
Millet. A little White Millet was also taken. They would not touch
Canary seed. They did not appear to take any particular interest in
live insects except when they were rearing young, when their
appetite was insatiable. Fresh meadow-ant cocoons were their
favourite, though they would not touch the ants themselves ;

I except the few flying ones. They were wasteful mealworm eaters in
that they ate only the head and a very small portion of the body--
not even like the Dufresne's Waxbills who industriously squeeze them
out like a tube of toothpaste ! They had an allowance of about
: a dozen three times a day when rearing young.
&apos; I think perhaps the secret of breeding these and similar birds is to
1 give them an aviary of their own, so that all the natural insect life is
&apos; available for one pair only, to rear their young.
The thing that amazes me from my limited experience of all the
I Estreldinae that I have bred, is the speed with which they go to nest
\ again for a second or third time, which appears to be about a week to
nine days after the previous brood have fledged, and still need feeding.
Do they do this under natural conditions ? Or is it an attempt to
" go while the going is good " in our very uncertain climate ?

Addendum, 29 TH December, 1961
I can now say that the first brood of young ones were, in fact, all
hens. The second brood began to moult into their adult plumage
three weeks after fledging, and have turned out to be two cocks and
one hen. Their moult has taken very much longer than that of the
first brood, in fact they have not completely finished moulting yet.
This is probably due to the cold weather.
They are all looking well at the moment, although there is 14 degrees
of frost. The shelter which they are in is electrically heated to about

A SILVERBILL x BENGALESE FINCH HYBRID
By C. J. O. Harrison (Tooting, London, England)
</construct>
<bodyText confidence="0.999765975609756" page_id="56317019"  page_num="30" year="" vol="">
In an earlier volume of the Avicultural Magazine (Vol. 64,
p. 51-3), Dr. Erica Eisner has described hybrids of the Bengalese
Finch (Lonchura striata) and the African Silverbill (Euodice cantans).
She suggests that in such hybrids the small components of appearance
and behaviour act as genetic units. Since additional information is
needed on this aspect of hybridism I have brought together my notes
on a similar hybrid which I had.
This bird was a hybrid between a cock African Silverbill and a hen
fawn-and-white Bengalese. I had it for some months and, after its
death, skinned it and retained it as a study specimen. I have compared
it with museum skins of both parent species, in the case of the Bengalese
comparing it with both the domesticated birds and the wild Sharp-
tailed Finch, from which it is thought to be derived.
The bill of the hybrid has the shape of a Sharptail bill and also the
dark upper, and paler lower mandible. The feathers of the forehead
and crown have dark centres and paler edges like those of the Silverbill.
There is a brown patch just under the bill on a paler throat. The
mantle and wing-coverts are the same tint of brown as a Sharptail's
but there are no pale streaks and the feathers show the fine transverse
barring typical of the Silverbill. The flight feathers are blackish brown.
The tail is black with elongated central tail-feathers. The breast and
flank feathers are not typical of either parent. They are very pale buff
with fine brown transverse bars that tend to slant towards the central
rachis. Many Silverbills show faint barring on these feathers, but this
tends to follow the curve of the feather tip. The belly and under
tail-coverts are pale buff like those of the Silverbill. The rump, which
it was not possible to preserve had a mixture of black and white
feathers in haphazard distribution. These present a problem, suggesting
either an inheritance of some of the white of the Bengalese hen, or else
a hidden potential for a white rump such as is found in the Indian
Silverbill (Euodice malabarica). The legs and feet are pale horn.
The bird was a cock and was paired to another fawn-and-white
Bengalese hen. The contact note of the hybrid differed from that of
either parent. I noted the contact call of the Bengalese as a dry
" tritt ", and that of the African Silverbill as a thin-shrill " psit The
call of the hybrid was a low-pitched, nasal " kent The excitement
note I recorded as a single sharp note lower in pitch than that of the
Bengalese. High-intensity excitement was shown by a crouching
posture accompanied by a vigorous flicking of the tail. At either end of
the movement the tail was cocked up to one side at a sharp angle but
during the movement it swung down to the horizontal and up again,

the tip following a U-shaped track. In general the excitement posture
resembled that of the Bengalese rather than the Silverbill. In a low-
intensity excitement posture the tail was swung to one side only and
spread a little, a movement found in the Silverbill.
Song was performed in a slope posture like that of the Silverbill, and
also resembled that species in that the feathers of the throat were
slightly raised and the remainder of the plumage was not fluffed at all.
It did, however, have one component of the Bengalese song-posture in
that the tail was spread, although it was not raised, as is usual in the
latter species (Fig. i).
Fig. 2
Dr. Eisner considers that the song is learnt. If so then this bird had
learnt the song of its father. Listening carefully I came to the con-
clusion that it was singing a Silverbill's song. But the song was far
louder than that of either parent species and could be heard throughout
a large house when the bird sang in an upper room at one end of it.
The song was quite extraordinary in that it appeared to be a slow
version of the Silverbill's song, the notes being quite distinct and not the
usual hurried jumble. I greatly regret not having made more careful
note of it and not being able to record it. It was frequently repeated and
seemed to show no variation.
The hen Bengalese began to build a nest. The hybrid was seen
mandibulating grass-blades, running them through his bill. On one
occasion he finally held a piece by its tip and displayed to the hen.
His body was drawn up almost vertically on the perch, with the head
level, and the belly feathers very slightly fluffed, making him look a
little pot-bellied. The tail was closed and hung straight down. In this
posture he bobbed up and down and was heard to utter two notes
which sounded like the commencement of song (Fig. 2). This type of
display is pure Silverbill.

Copulation was seen once, the hen soliciting by crouching with
quivering tail. The cock sang a loud, rapid version of the song before
mounting. Immediately afterwards the hen reacted aggressively
towards him. He was seen to loop material under the foot and to
carry it into the nest-box, but seemed at a loss as to what to do with it,
and was seen to pull material out of the box, mandibulate it, and then
drop it. Most of the building was done by the Bengalese hen. Eggs
were laid but the death of the hybrid soon after prevented any attempt
to hatch them.
The two birds had been kept in a large cage 6 by 3^ by 2 feet.
During the latter period I partitioned off half of this and put in a pair
of African Silverbills, separated by a single piece of wire-netting. The
hybrid showed a frantic interest in these birds and completely neglected
the Bengalese hen for much of the time.
The only primary difference between my hybrid and those of
Dr. Eisner would appear to be in the sex of the parent species. But
there would appear to be differences of plumage and behaviour in the
birds themselves. Dr. Eisner suggests that the separate components of
behaviour act as genetic units and show dominance and recessiveness.
In that case one would expect hybrids of particular species to show
consistency in there behaviour since presumably the same characters
would always be dominant.
In this respect it is interesting to compare the song-postures. The
Sharp tail sings with flank feathers fluffed and tail raised and spread.
The Silverbill sings with plumage unfluffed and tail closed and lowered.
Dr. Eisner's hybrids sang in a Silverbill posture, but with flank feathers
fluffed ; while mine sang in a Silverbill posture but with tail spread.
It would appear that the raising and the spreading of the tail in the
case of the Sharptail are controlled by separate genes.
It is obvious that we need much more information before we can be
at all dogmatic on this subject. This is one of those occasions where
only aviculture can supply an answer, and any aviculturist who
succeeds in breeding such hybrids, and who can spare the time
carefully to record the differences between them and the parent
species can make a useful contribution to scientific knowledge.

I consider that there is no need for a detailed description of this
handsome little Indian bird for the coloured plate, from a painting by
D. M. Reid-Henry in the July/August, 1958, issue of this Magazine
is so true to life that it could not be bettered in mere words. It is no
wonder that Indian villagers often refer to it as the Painted Thrush.
Towards the later part of 1959, Mr. Boehm received three of this
species and, customary to the usual practice with any of the Pitta
family, housed them in separate pens. Every effort was made to
detect some differences between them in the hope that there might
be a pair. No definite conclusion being reached, it was decided to
try them out in the spring of i960, two at a time, in an aviary. For
ease of identification, each bird was banded with a different colour
and the trials began. First, " Red " and " Yellow 55 were introduced
to each other but soon had to be parted. " Red " was replaced by
" Green 55 and all was quiet, very quiet in fact for about two months.
Finally, in June, a nest, rather a clumsy affair, was constructed in a
Canadian Hemlock. They were fourteen days on the job and then it
was deserted, still incomplete.
Although this was a disappointment, it did at least indicate that
a pair may have been sorted out but, they could, of course, be two
females. A photograph of one of them, later proved to be the male, in
the aviary in which the eventual breeding took place, appears opposite
page 227 of the November/December, i960, issue of this Magazine.
Having had no information or experience on two Pittas living amicably
together the entire year through, with the coming of winter they were
separated once more. It was not until April, 1961, that they were
returned to the same aviary in which they had made the attempt at
nest building.
Early in May, Green " was observed busy on a nest in a White
Pine. It was located about 6 feet up at the junction of a branch with
the main trunk of the tree. Although the other bird brought various
materials, the main construction was carried out by the one bird.
The outer covering was comprised of grasses and dried leaves, all held
together with twigs and roots, the entire assembly being bound with
dried reeds. It was a large, almost globular, affair except that the
length exceeded the breadth. The entrance hole was low down and
led into a tunnel-like aperture which went in for about 6 inches at
one level and then dropped into a cup-like depression at the end.
The total depth from entrance to rear was about 10 inches. The
interior was lined with dried grasses and green leaves.
The first egg was laid on 3rd June, when it was revealed that

C. EVERITT-THE BREEDING OF THE BENGAL PITTA
" Green " was the female. The final clutch of five was completed by
the 7th, but the birds had been sitting steadily from the arrival of the
second egg. It appeared that the male did the daytime shift, the female
taking over in the late afternoon. It was confirmed that incubation
had begun with the laying of the second egg for, on 21st June, two
chicks hatched with a further one on each of the next two days. The
remaining egg was removed later and found to be clear. It measured
22 by 23 mm., almost spherical, and was china-white in main colour
with speckles and hair lines of brownish purple.
Owing to the depth of the nest, further aggravated by overhanging
branches, little could be seen of the chicks although it was possible to
discern that they were dark skinned, practically devoid of any nestling
fluff, flat headed, and with bright red-orange gapes. As with the
incubation both parents shared in the rearing which was carried out
entirely with live food. Owing to the size of the aviary, 65 by 28 feet,
and the fact that it was well planted with shrubs and trees, they were
able to forage a tremendous amount of grubs and insects. These were
supplemented by regular issues of mealworms and maggots plus a
daily replenishment of freshly gathered leaf-mould which was placed
in a portable tray at the foot of the pine.
The young birds progressed rapidly and, by 28th June, all had their
eyes open and began to gather at the entrance to the nest ever ready
to take whatever the adults brought to them. Nine days later two left
the nest and the following day it was empty. As each came out it was
caught up and banded. Within five days of this they were all feeding
themselves and fully independent.
Their plumage was dark grey on the underparts with dull bottle-
green upper feathering. The head markings were fainter than those of
the adults but closely followed the same general colour pattern. Their
bills, however, were bright orange throughout and lacked the black
tip of the mature birds. The first visible change in colouring did occur
in the bill and the end had darkened considerably by the time they
were independent, i.e. five days after leaving the nest. At the end of
a further six days the centre of the abdomen began to change to
fulvous, which gradually spread throughout the lower parts until, by
the time they were* seven weeks old, they had taken on the same
colouring of the lower plumage as their parents, even to the red
under-tail feathers. The head markings and upper plumage was a little
slower in developing and it was not until they were ten weeks old that
the coloured bands on their legs became the only sure means for
distinguishing them from the older birds.
By the time the first round was independent the nesting pair had
completely demolished their nest and had built another, similar in
pattern, in a different White Pine but about a foot higher up and
facing north this time whereas the previous one had faced south.

P. H. MAXWELL-THE BREEDING OF THE SEVERE MACAW 35
A second round of five eggs was duly produced and again but four
hatched, the incubation and rearing following on the exact same lines
as with the prior round.
Needless to say, all the young birds were removed immediately
they were fending for themselves and placed in separate aviaries, one
to each. Unfortunately one of them flew into a door and broke its
neck and another was taken by a rat. However, it does leave six
young Bengal Pittas which have yet to be sexed.
The sexes are almost identical in appearance but close scrutiny of
the true pair owned by Mr. Boehm has revealed the following
differences although they are not considered to be of sufficient intensity
to enable definite sexing of a singleton bird to be undertaken. The varia-
tions are that the red feathering of the vent appears to be more intense
in the males ; the body size is slightly greater in the male but the bill
of the female is a shade longer. Not being aware of the location of
another true pair in the vicinity, it has not been possible to compare
these observations with any other birds.
To date, I have been unable to trace any record of the prior breeding
of this species in captivity and it seems that this may be a world's

I bought my hen Severe Macaw from Mr. Ford of Woolwich in
1956. The cock bird I obtained from Miss Knobel a few years later.
Unfortunately it had a crooked beak and eventually bit off all its toes.
They lived together in the Parrot House till it was closed when
they were placed in an aviary. The hen used to go to nest each year
and lay eggs.
At about the end of August, 1961, the cock was found badly
damaged and died from its wounds after a few days. About the middle
of September a young one fully feathered was seen looking out of the
nest. In a few days it left the nest and now is flying around with its
mother and feeding itself.
They nested in a slanting wooden tree-trunk nest-box. They did
not have any special food, only sunflower and apple and the scraps
they got from the visitors.

TRANSPORT OF BIRDS BY AIR

<bodyText confidence="0.998769184210526" page_id="56317025"  page_num="36" year="" vol="">
By J. J. Yealland (London, England)
Early in 1959 a committee was set up by the British Standards
Institution in order to advise on the packaging of live animals for
transportation by air. The work was divided among three sub-
committees, the one with which we are here concerned advising on
birds (including day-old chicks and turkey poults) and reptiles.
The Avicultural Society was represented by Miss Phyllis Barclay-
Smith and Mr. G. S. Mottershead ; the National Council for Avicul-
ture by the late Mr. E. N. T. Vane, and the Zoological Society of
London by the Veterinary Officer and myself.
The recommendations (which include line drawings) are published
by the British Standards Institution and here I will only mention some
of the important features of them :--
Newly caught birds should not be sent and those being sent must be
in good health and well accustomed to the kinds of food that they
would receive on the journey. So as to provide for possible delays,
food sufficient for twice the anticipated duration of the journey should
accompany the birds and instructions concerning their feeding and
general care should be clearly indicated on paper pasted to the cage.
The birds must not be left in the sun or in a cold or draughty place,
nor must they be stowed in close proximity to cats, etc. They should
be sent with the expectation of arrival on a normal working day, the
consignee being informed in good time of their despatch. They should
be collected as soon as possible after arrival at the destination airport,
for the cages are not designed for long occupation.
The birds must be given food and fresh clean water at least once
per day on the journey and the lights in the hold should be left on.
A muslin curtain should be fixed at the front of cages containing small
birds, and a curtain of some stronger material for the larger birds,
these curtains to be lowered over the front of the cage during trans-
portation to and from the aircraft and raised after stowage.
There are, of course, many additional recommendations and perhaps
the most important of all is the provision of more room for the birds,
for there is no doubt that overcrowding is the greatest single cause of
suffering and mortality, particularly among the commonly exported
small birds.
Valuable help was derived from the Zoological Society's publications
on this subject (originally produced in 1928 and revised in 1950) and

Four species new to the collection have been received during the
past two months. They are a Yellow-necked or Black Bittern (. Dupetor
Jlavicollisflavicollis) , a Chinese Ruddy Crake ( Porzana fusca erythrothorax ),
both presented by Dr. K. C. Searle who also sent a pair of Red-crested
Wood Quail or Roulroul Partridge, a Chinese Pond Heron ( Ardeola
bacchus ), an immature and as yet unidentified cuckoo, and a Chinese
Blue Pie.
Four Erckel's Francolins ( Francolinus erckeli ), bred in the Amsterdam
Zoo, also represent a species not previously at Regent's Park, the
fourth species being a pair of Crimson Finches ( Rhodospingus cruentus)
presented by Messrs. G. H. and J. R. Newmark.
The Yellow-necked or Black Bittern ranges widely over eastern and
south-eastern Asia and as far southward as Australia. Of the nominate
race La Touche says that it is a common summer visitor to parts of
eastern China and is mainly crepuscular in habit, though often to be
seen flying during the day. It frequents the paddy fields and reed beds,
breeding sometimes among reeds, sometimes in trees or in bamboos,
occasionally at a distance from water. At times it nests in gardens or
in roadside trees. It comes northward at about the end of April or
early in May and leaves during September. There are six races of
this species.
The Chinese Ruddy Crake (five races) is also widely distributed
over eastern and south-eastern Asia as far as the Celebes. It is a shy
skulking bird of marshy places and river banks, the race with which
we are concerned being a summer visitor in eastern parts of China and
the more northerly parts of Japan. These migrants winter as far
southward as Siam and Indo-China where, as in southern parts of
Japan, there is a resident population.
Erckel's Francolin inhabits north-eastern Africa, the nominate
race living on the high plateaux of Abyssinia and F. e. pentoni , a paler
and greyer form, in the Red Sea province of the Sudan. It is said to
be common.

The Crimson Finch is inappropriately named, for the male is as
much black as crimson and the female of a pale buff colour. It inhabits
western Ecuador and north-western Peru. It is the only member of the
genus and little appears to be known of it.
Among a number of new ducks for the transformed Three Island
Pond (all the fences have been removed, the one on the perimeter
being replaced by a moat, some bushes and inferior trees have been
cleared and the islands turfed) the most noteworthy is a pair of New
Zealand Scaup ( Aythya novaeseelandiae ) that were bred by Mr. J. O.
D'eath and presented by him. These are descended from specimens
received from New Zealand by the Wildfowl Trust several years ago ;
the species has, however, previously been kept at Regent's Park, for
a single specimen was given by the late Sydney Porter in 1946. There
appears to be no record of when or how many were imported by him,
but it or they were, presumably, the first to reach Europe alive.

A pair of Painted Spur Fowl [Galloperdix lunulata), a Baltimore
Oriole, and a Pine Siskin are other notable arrivals.
A Blue-breasted Sapphire Humming Bird was caught in Sussex
during October. It had been about the garden, where it was found,
and in the neighbourhood for some time. It seems almost certainly to be
the bird that escaped during the summer from Mr. Murray's aviaries
in Essex.
The Mantell's Kiwi has died after only three years in the Gardens.
The cause of death was peritonitis due to the decomposition of a
partly formed egg.
A Woodford's Owl that was received in April, 1945, has died. It is
likely to have been one that was in Mr. Spedan Lewis's collection at
Leckford since before the war. It laid infertile eggs last year and the
year before. It and its mate (a specimen of the West African race,
Ciccaba woodfordi nuchalis ), hatched and reared a Snowy Owl during
i960.

a tree on the outskirts of the Bwamba Forest. This is an attractive
bird with green upper parts, yellowish-green below, black wings and
black collar, rump bright blue, base of tail red."

Dr. Dieter Overlander, Bad Honnef-Rhein, West Germany, reports
concerning his Pennant's Parrakeets : " Last year I had quite a good
breeding season. My five pairs all had eggs and young ones. Four
pairs reared fifteen young between them. Two males (brothers), one
year old and still in immature plumage, paired with two sisters, one
year older, and reared three and four young ones respectively. The
females are hand-reared birds, take food from one's hand and come
on to my shoulder. When breeding they were a little aggressive but
now are as tame as before. I tried these birds in view of the common
opinion that hand-reared Pennant's either do not breed or at least
not so freely. My experience is that the contrary is more correct--if
the young ones are kept in aviaries as soon as they are independent
of being fed by hand."

A. W. E. Fletcher writes on the last day of September : " Last
year I bought a pair of Luzon Bleeding Heart Doves which have been
kept in the large mixed aviary. They were in immaculate condition
when they arrived and have remained so. They are not very satisfac-
tory birds to keep, as they are extremely wild and nervous, and spend
nearly all their time in the shelter.
" Early in August I noticed that a nest was being built on the
rafters in the shelter, and a few days later I saw one of the doves
on it. It was a typical pigeon nest, very rough and constructed of
old millet sprays. Except for an occasional peep through the window,
I left them severely alone. Two squabs were hatched about three
weeks ago, and left the nest at an early age, which I believe is
customary with ground doves. So far they are being successfully
reared, but with such nervous parents I shall not be certain of
success until they are feeding themselves.
" I am giving soft food, meal worms, earth worms, and soaked
brown bread, as I believe these doves require a high protein diet
when rearing."
One young one was in fact successfully reared.

Bird migration remains a constant source of wonder to all students
of natural history and this interesting book will be welcomed not only
by professional ornithologists, but also by amateur naturalists and the
armchair enthusiast. The author has collected recent information on
the subject from a variety of sources, including the observations of the
growing army of bird-watchers, and presents it in simple and enter-
taining language. The book is well illustrated and can be thoroughly
recommended to any reader interested in the subject or looking for
a suitable present for a young naturalist.

CLIFFS OF FREEDOM. By Roscoe Howells. Gomerian Press,
Llandyssul, 1961. Price iffi. 6 d. net.
This story of Skomer Island, which is situated off the west coast of
Wales, is closely interwoven with an account of the last man who
farmed it--Reuben Codd--and his unequal struggle against the over-
whelming difficulties of competing with modern agricultural methods.
In the opening chapters the author gives an account of his first
visit to the island so graphically described that the reader cannot fail
to have a vivid impression of it, the rough seas through which it is
approached, the wild weather which besets it, and the birds and seals
which inhabit it. Tracing the history of the island since the time of the
ancient Britons the author puts forward many theories including the
possible role played by both rabbits and birds in the habitation of the
island. The book, however, is chiefly concerned with events since the
island was bought by Mr. Walter Sturt in 1922 and the great work he
and Reuben Codd, who became his son-in-law, put into the island.
It is an intimate account of the fascination, difficulties, and hardships
of island life and the character of the people of this part of Wales, their
inborn courage, their great knowledge of nature and philosophic
outlook, and is full of local anecdotes.
The author's statements regarding the activities of over-avid seekers
after ornithological knowledge, and, as can best be described, the
" greedy " bird-watcher and bird photographer are disquieting. He
undoubtedly feels there is too much interference with birds under the
guise of scientific investigation and one feels a sense of bitterness in the
concluding chapters. This is a fascinating book which once begun
cannot be put down till it is read from cover to cover.

A SCHEME FOR THE RINGING AND REGISTRATION
OF PHEASANTS
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.991368130434783" page_id="56317033"  page_num="44" year="" vol="">
At a meeting of the Council of the Ornamental Pheasant Trust it was agreed
that in order to foster and encourage the breeding of rare pheasants by private
collectors on sound lines some scheme for the recording and registration of these birds
was desirable. I was asked to be ring secretary and to keep the necessary records, and
this I am delighted to do.
It is obviously impractical, and indeed quite unnecessary, to ring and record every
pheasant bred each year in captivity, but certain species are suffering severely from
inbreeding. Although these species have been kept in captivity for many years, great
difficulties stand in the way of obtaining new blood, and, in certain cases, numbers of
fertile breeding pairs become fewer each year. Other species have always been rare
and never successfully established in captivity.
Briefly, I envisage the scheme to work like this. I would keep a register of all birds
in Great Britain of the rare species of pheasants and allied birds. To enable me to
keep this up to date each owner should let me know how many birds he has of these
species, and their relationship to one another. Any information such as origin of the
parent stock would, of course, be a great help.
Breeders will be given a stud number, and a number for each bird, and in the summer
of each year rings would be issued for ringing the birds bred that year. It would of
course be additionally helpful if I could be notified of all deaths and other losses, and
movements from one collection to another, in addition to new hatchings and rearings.
One of the functions of the scheme would be to enable birds to be exchanged with
a view to providing breeders with unrelated blood.
It would seem unnecessary to keep any record of the following species which are

</table>
<bodyText confidence="0.947090833333333" page_id="56317033"  page_num="44" year="" vol="">
The scheme would, of course, include all rare species of Phasianidae, and any one
having rare quail or partridges would, it is to be hoped, let me have details.
The extent of success of the scheme will depend entirely on the amount of co-opera-
tion obtained, and I would be most grateful if breeders would let me have their
comments, and state if they would be willing to participate, as soon as possible.

A NOTE ON "NIDIFICATION "
In an article in the final number of the Magazine for 1961, Mr. W. G. Conway, of
the New York Zoological Society, stated of the Tacazze Sunbird that the " incubation
period was fifteen-and-a-half days and nidification required twenty days ". It may
be that this use of the word nidification is common in the United States, but this is the
first time I have seen it used with this meaning in this country.
Nidification, as its Latin origin nidus + jicare shows, means the building of the nest.
I am quite sure Mr. Conway does not intend to suggest that the Sunbirds took twenty
days to build the nest but that the young spent twenty days in the nest. Our technical
jargon in the avicultural world is fast growing unmanageable anyway, and it seems
unnecessary to confuse the issue by using words in their wrong senses. The fashion for
classical vocabulary being what it is, especially in America, I suppose a word must be
found for this part of a bird's life--a frightful suggestion might be nidimansion--but
why not simplify and call it the nestling period ?

THE NEW ZEALAND HONEYEATERS
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.99780334375" page_id="56317046"  page_num="" year="" vol="">
By Alan R. Longhurst (Freetown, Sierra Leone, West Africa)
Of the great diversity of honeyeaters (Meliphagidae) that occur in
the Australasian region only three are found in New Zealand ; in
Australia, where the family is among the most characteristic of birds,
about seventy species occur--a striking illustration of the relative
poverty of the New Zealand bird fauna, which is typical of oceanic
islands.
The New Zealand honeyeaters are placed in three genera : Notio-
mystis, the Stitchbird ; Anthornis, the Bellbird ; and Prosthemadera, the
Tui. Of these, the first two are rather typical of the family and would
be scarcely noticeable in the Australian fauna, while the third, the Tui,
is an unusually large and handsome species with a number of peculiar
features in its plumage. Most obvious are the white bobbles which
hang below the throat in both sexes ; these are composed of a number
of curled filamentous feathers that cluster naturally to form the two
pendant cup-shaped structures that are so prominent in the living bird.
In addition, the shafts of the feathers on the sides of the neck have
filamentous extensions of the feather proper so that a mass of white
threads adorns the side of the neck and the nape.
These three species of honeyeaters reacted very differently to the
invasion of New Zealand by man, his introduction of predatory animals
and European birds and--perhaps most important of all--the avian
parasites and diseases introduced along with them. All three species
apparently maintained their numbers despite the predation of the
Maori invaders who culled the bird-stocks for food in an intelligent
manner, but reacted more violently to the European invasion. Within
a hundred years the Stitchbird was virtually extinct upon the mainland,
to hang on only on Little Barrier Island in the north of the country ;
the Bellbird was greatly reduced so that a similar extinction was feared,
but then staged an impressive come-back so that it is now again
abundant in forested country ; the large and ebullient Tui took the
invasion in its stride and, maintaining its numbers in the forests,

successfully established itself in farmlands and suburbia, demanding
only a minimum of large trees to be left standing.
The Tui's loud and amusing song, full of mimicry and delivered
from the topmost twig of a prominent tree, is a well-known sound in
the suburbs of Wellington as well as deep in the forest, and considerable
numbers will flock to a flowering eucalypt, or to a good stand of the
New Zealand flax, and feed acrobatically on the flowers. In thrusting
their bills deep into the blossoms, feeding on the nectar, pollen becomes
dusted on crowns and foreheads to produce some startling colour
effects--the newcomer will comb his books in vain for a species or
plumage of Tui having an orange crown. Many of the favourite trees
flower in spring and New Zealanders react in the same way to the
sight of a Tui feeding in a fine Kowhai--as in the illustration--as do
the English to the first Swallow or daffodils.
In the spring a good deal of aggressive posturing and chasing occurs
between the males which occupy their favourite song-sites for long
periods, leaving them to harry neighbouring territory holders. During
this display, and during the song-activities, a great deal of use is made
of the feather masses, which are erected and give the bird an altogether
grotesque appearance. The Tui is a fascinating bird, and all the more
so since it can never be seen in captivity under the existing New

SOME BREEDING RESULTS IN THE
HALLSTROM COLLECTION
By Sir Edward Hallstrom (Sydney, N.S.W., Australia)
Parrots.
I have bred quite a number of Red-vented Parrots and a number of
</table>
<bodyText confidence="0.992778466666667" page_id="56317047"  page_num="46" year="" vol="">
other small South American parrots, and a few macaws. At the present
moment I have one baby Red and Blue Macaw, three baby Red and
Yellow, and three baby Blue and Gold. Some macaws come along
each year, and I have now completed seven new macaw breeding
aviaries. These have quite long flights and are the type of aviary
with which I have had quite a lot of success.
The most interesting Australian parrots are the Golden-shoulders.
I now have forty of these birds. I have found very great difficulty in
rearing the youngsters. In their natural habitat they build in termite
mounds, which are quite big affairs with quite an amount of insulation
round the breeding chamber. The temperature during May is
between 70 and 80 degrees, and occasionally a little more. The parents
do a very fine job of rearing their young in a state of nature, but there
is really no necessity for them to sit among their babies to allow them
to snuggle into their feathers for warmth, and it is usual to see, even

in Sydney in the summertime, the mother sitting alongside the babies.
In a state of nature they lay one clutch of eggs about May and, some
months later, probably another clutch which they almost invariably
rear. The temperature is perfect for them, but in our district they
still go to nest in May, and it is cold. Should there be a cold night,
and there almost invariably is, they will lose all their babies. They
go back to nest again in a few months, the weather is still cold, and
the babies can be lost again. On a number of occasions I have taken
the babies from the nest within twenty-four hours of hatching, and
have successfully reared all the youngsters to maturity. This year
unfortunately I have been very busy on other matters and was not
able to hand-rear the youngsters. I was obliged to cover the aviaries
with plastic. I was then able to install radiators, and by using this
method I was able to raise nearly all the young. This was not quite
ioo per cent, and a few losses occurred. I am quite sure that only by
artificially heating their aviaries or even their nesting accommodation
during the breeding season, will they be successfully bred in the hands
of the aviculturist.
There are a lot of aviculturists in southern parts of Australia who
are very successful and are breeding quite a lot of our nice parrots
and parrot-like birds.
In my aviaries I have two pairs of albino Galahs. These have been
given an opportunity to go to nest ; the eggs usually have been dropped
on the ground, but I am hoping that I will be successful by making-
minor adjustments to their accommodation.
I think I have mentioned that I had been breeding some lutino
Indian Ring-necks. I now have well over 200. Unlike most breeders,
I hate parting with birds--I am like a miser, I save them up to look at.
Birds of Paradise.
I have had some successes with several pairs of Ribbon-tailed Birds
of Paradise youngsters at my aviaries in Sydney. At Taronga Park,
with the assistance of several members of the staff, we reared two
Empress of Germany ; these birds have not yet reached maturity
but are now about two years old. In my aviaries in New Guinea there
have been quite a number of Birds of Paradise go to nest, hatch
youngsters, and rear them. The successes so far encouraged me to
build forty steel aviaries, large enough to accommodate most species
of Birds of Paradise. A number of Blue Birds of Paradise have been
hatched there and several are building at this moment. There have
been at least two Ribbon-tailed Birds of Paradise, and I am waiting
for news of a third one having been hatched, as it was expected in
about a week.
The Lesser Bird of Paradise has been successfully raised. Recently
a female Ribbon-tailed Bird of Paradise (that had already reared two

youngsters) had accidentally introduced to her a male Lesser Sickle-
bill Bird of Paradise. It was noticed that they were mating, we left
them alone, and a youngster was hatched and partly reared, but
unfortunately we had a record dry spell and these birds require very
wet conditions.
The youngster was lost after about ten days. The specimen has been
preserved. They have gone to nest again and I am hoping that the
performance will be repeated as they have an egg, and I should hear
any day the result of this second attempt.
The Princess Stephanies had been kept together with quite a number
of other Birds of Paradise in very large aviaries. They built their
nests, hatched their youngsters, and I am quite sure that the other
Birds of Paradise ate the babies during the mother's absence from the
nest, as the mother only feeds the youngster, leaving it exposed to
attack.
As soon as the new aviaries have been completed, as many as possible
of our Birds of Paradise will be placed in separate aviaries.
It is not as easy as it sounds. Some of the males play no part at all
in the rearing or feeding of the youngsters, leaving it all to the females,
and I am quite suspicious that the father in some cases is quite capable
of making a meal from his newly hatched youngster. It is all very
interesting. The experiments and research with these birds would
make very pleasant reading to the aviculturist.

By A. H. Isenberg (Portola Valley, California, U.S.A.)
1961 came closer to a success with these wonderful birds. A late
storm and heavy rain ruined the first nest with two eggs. The female
soon built another nest toward the end of April and laid again two eggs.
Both eggs hatched in approximately fourteen to sixteen days, but one
young disappeared after four days. The other young lasted to the
tenth day with quills well developed but not yet popping, when the
female killed it and actually tore it limb from limb.
The male had been separated into an adjoining aviary after the hen
had been sitting about a week. Next year, I shall take the male far
enough away so they cannot see each other. This might do the trick
so that, if both birds are here for next year's season, I hope I can then
report a full success.
The Lesser Birds of Paradise did nothing although the male displayed
constantly. The female carried a few sticks but no nest was built.
Again, we can only hope for next season.

The Black-headed Sugarbird, one of the Central American species
is well known on the show bench, the male always making a grand
exhibit with his jet black head and shining blue-green body plumage.
The female is equally attractive in her lighter shades of green, the black
of the head being replaced by a finely discernible grey-green mask.
There were four pairs of these birds in Mr. Boehm's collection of
exotic birds and, due to the males' natural belligerency towards those
of their own kind and gender, they were housed one pair to an aviary.
All four aviaries were well stocked with birds of many other species,
but the Sugarbirds did not interfere with these in any way. Of the
four, three pairs had been in situ since early i960, the last pair being
fairly new arrivals. It was the established birds that went to nest and,
although all three pairs successfully reared young, it was not a case of
either easy nesting or rearing. Practically every snag that aviculturists
come up against at some time during the breeding season was met with.
The actual manner of construction of the nests was identical in each
instance, a small open cup nest being built by the females, the males
assisting in no way whatever. All they did was to perch close by,
singing their heads off. The nest measured about 90 mm. across the top
and was about 60 mm. deep, the central depression being quite deep,
sufficient for the female to be completely concealed except for her
head. The clutch consisted of two eggs of varying shades of pinkish
brown, heavily spotted with umber, the thicker end being almost
obscured. The variations in colour of the eggs occurred at times in the
same nest and, therefore, was not, as at first thought, a peculiarity of
any one pair.
As with the building of the nest, the incubation was entirely a
feminine affair, the period being but twelve days. The nestlings were
dark skinned and completely bare of all body covering, their gapes
being a bright pink. There were two red spots at the base of the
mouth, under the lower mandible, this feature being consistent
throughout the nestings. At five days old their eyes were open and
quill feathers had begun to form. For the first ten days in the nest the
males were not seen to help with the rearing, everything being left to
the females. During this time, the sac containing the excreta of the
young birds was swallowed by the female, this continuing even after
the males did join in with the rearing.
Live-food and nectar appeared to be the sole rearing diet and regular
hourly issues of gentles and mealworm pupae was made throughout
the day. It had been observed that they were reluctant in taking fully-
developed mealworms, even very small ones, to their young, but that

the pupae were accepted with avidity. Fortunately Mr. Boehm has his
own mealworm breeding establishment comprised of some ioo separate
compartments and it was thus possible to meet their requirements.
Once they had passed the tenth day, the males joined in with the
rearing and, two days later, the young left the nest.
Their heads were completely bare of all feathering, whilst the
underparts were dark grey, the upper plumage being bottle green.
Despite their naked appearance they were very active and were soon
flying from branch to branch following their parents around for food.
It was a further ten days before their heads did feather up and, at
five weeks old, they were fully independent. By now their upper
plumage had taken on a lighter green shade, the underparts also
changing to green of a duller hue. It appeared at this time that there
were slight differences in the colouring of the chicks, some being lighter
than others and possessing a distinct light-green throat-patch. It was
felt that this might well be a sex indicator and, by means of the
different coloured leg bands placed on the birds when they vacated
their nest, a careful record was kept of the various shades and changes.
Things turned out as had been thought, the birds with the light
throats eventually proving to be females. With regard to the males,
the black head and the yellow lower mandible were fully visible by the
time the birds were four months old. The male parents had themselves
sorted out the sexes at the end of three months for they had begun to
chivvy them around. To avoid any tragedy, all the young males were
caught up and transfered to other quarters.
Although the above may appear to portray a straight-forward
breeding, such was not in fact the case. In every instance each pair
met with various frustrations, such as nests and eggs destroyed ;
chicks dying at two and three days old ; series of clear eggs, etc. If
I were to attempt to detail all the troubles experienced with these
breedings it would take up far more space than so far consumed.
The breeding period actually extended from early May to late
September and, if all the fertile eggs had been hatched and reared to
maturity, there would have been eighteen young Black-headed
Sugarbirds instead of the nine that were produced. Again, if all the
eggs laid had resulted in a fully grown bird, the number would have
been well up in the thirties. It has now to be learned at what age this
species does go to nest and, for this purpose, three pairs of unrelated
young birds have been installed in separate aviaries.
I have not been able to trace any record of a previous successful
breeding of this variety in captivity, and it may well be that these by
Mr. Edward Marshall Boehm are the first of their kind in such
conditions.

WHITE-EYE

/josterops palpebrosa
By R. A. Richardson (Cley, Norfolk, England)
It is difficult to imagine a more delightful little bird than the
White-Eye, one of the smallest and certainly the most inexpensive of
all the many attractive insectivorous species imported from India
at the present time. They are so familiar that a description would
be superfluous ; ideal aviary birds but prone to plucking and to losing
the yellow pigment from their plumage in close confinement.
As White-Eyes are impossible to sex without prolonged observation
of behaviour I purchased three specimens from Mr. Trevor Grewes of
Sydenham in the spring of 1958 and, after colour-ringing, I released
them into my small, planted garden aviary which has an electrically-
heated shelter attached. They soon sorted themselves out into a true
pair and an odd male and thrived out of doors continuously for the
next three years, living on ripe fruit, a few small mealworms, what
insects they could catch themselves and a constant supply of artificial
nectar of the most elementary formula--honey and Nestle's milk
diluted with water and with a dab of Bovril added every other day.
Both in 1959 and i960 the pair went to nest in the aviary with mixed
success, the spare male being segregated each time. The first year a
clutch of two infertile eggs was laid in a forsaken Chaffinch's nest
fixed up for them in an elder bush and the replacement clutch, though
fertile, was ejected from the same nest by one of the other occupants of
this community aviary.
In i960 one nestling hatched from a clutch of two eggs, again in an
old Chaffinch's nest, but it was so microscopical and looked so appetiz-
ing that it survived only an hour or so before disappearing, eaten, I
suspect, by my cock Shama.
During May of 1961, the pair once again began to fiddle with
cobwebs and yet another Chaffinch's nest was provided for them but
the odd male, which had not been isolated, became dominant and
spent most of his time chasing the mated male about the aviary with
much bill-snapping, while the female occupied herself by tugging
material from the nest until it finally disintegrated and fell to the
ground.
At noon on 17 th June, after much forethought, I decided to risk
liberating this long-established and determined pair in the hope that
they would remain anchored about the garden by the captive bird's
calls and the tubes of nectar to which they had become addicted.
A small hole which I made in the wire-netting beside one of the
feeders was soon discovered and with commendable composure the

pair flitted out and up into the apple tree which shaded the flight. I had
hardly finished re-closing the aperture before they returned to drink
at the feeder already turned outwards for their convenience.
Thenceforward their visits occurred at about half-hourly intervals
and they roosted out at night. So close is the pair-bond in this species
that they cannot bear to be out of sight of each other for more than a
few moments at a time.
Two days later (19th June) the hen was seen gathering spiders' webs
from the eaves of the bird house and, to my delight, I followed her
back to a half-built cocoon-like nest 15 feet up in a neighbour's
pear tree.
Through binoculars I could see the bird at work through the gauzy,
semi-transparent sides of the structure which was a deep cup of billiard
ball size slung oriole-wise in the angle of a laterally forked twig.
Round and round she shuffled, twining and threading, pressing with
chin and breast and scrabbling with her claws all the time shaping and
consolidating the fairy-like cradle of cobwebs and grey synthetic
fibres filched from some female garment on a nearby washing-line.
The cock took an equal share in building and when the inside walls
of the " cocoon " were reinforced with short pieces of horizontally
woven dry grass it was further lined with downy feathers from the
chicken run.
They were never seen to copulate and the only spectacular display
observed was on the afternoon of 22nd June, when I believe the first
egg was laid. The hen had been sitting in the nest for some time in a
curiously strained attitude, often half closing her eyes. Suddenly she
left and her mate, which had been singing his breezy little song in a
nearby tree, dashed at her and chased her helter-skelter in and out of
the garden for a few seconds before leaving her preening and sun-
bathing in the hedge.
The second egg doubtless followed the next day, for it was then that
incubation appeared to begin, both sexes again taking an equal share,
and relieving each other at frequent intervals. The routine was identical
on every occasion, the off-duty bird returning to the nest which was
vacated by the incubating bird as soon as its mate arrived. So rapid
was the change-over that the eggs were never left uncovered for longer
than about two seconds at a time, the out-going bird flying straight to
the nectar for refreshment and often to the earthenware bathing
saucer kept permanently filled on the aviary roof. They were never
seen to feed each other.
I am of the strong opinion that hatching took place sometime on
2nd July, on which day the sitting bird constantly raised up to look
beneath its breast. It was at this time that I suddenly realized that the
male was missing and I began to fear for his safety. Indeed he was
never seen again.

Next day dawned with a raging gale from the nor'west, sheets of
rain and a sudden drop in temperature of 12 degrees. With foliage
being stripped wholesale from the lashing branches there began for me
a most harrowing few hours. Again through binoculars I could see the
little hen deeply snuggled in the nest which was already fraying
dangerously where a large leaf was chafing the underside. Every
fifteen minutes or so she hurried to the aviary looking very unhappy
and harassed, gulped a few mouthfuls of nectar before dashing back
to brood the tiny young. She was plainly distressed and returned
again and again to the captive male, calling frenziedly from the aviary,
as if appealing for his assistance in her plight. Obviously disaster was
close at hand for if something was not done quickly the young would
perish either from starvation or exposure. Without a second thought
I decided to release the second male in the faint hope that he might at
least give the female some comfort by his near presence. Imagine my
delight when, despite three years of frustration and being deprived of
all the preliminary rituals, this devoted little bird not only accom-
panied the female back to the nest but unhesitatingly started to
alternately brood and feed his rival's offspring. My relief could hardly
have been less than the White-Eye's.
Rearing continued apace and nest sanitation was meticulous.
Hurried examinations of the nest on the 5th and 8th July, revealed one
nestling and an addled egg and then just the nestling in pin-quill
stage. The unhatched egg, pale blue and unmarked, had disappeared.
On 10th July, the nestling's head was visible over the rim of the nest
while feeding was in progress and on the 13th, the chick left the nest
during another gale and was discovered sitting in a bundle of pea-
sticks beneath the tree. The juvenile plumage was as brilliant as that
of a wild-caught bird but lacking the white " spectacle ", the orbital
area being naked greyish skin.
The bill was orange-horn, gape-flange yellow, mouth orange and
legs flesh-pink.
Its hunger call was the faintest echo of the adult's familiar cheer. Both
incubation and fledging periods were thus approximately ten days
each.
The old birds were very concerned when I rescued the youngster
and perched it safely in an overhanging Syringa , fussing around with
shrill tittering alarm notes and bringing it small spiders, one at a time,
which continued to form the bulk of its diet. That night it climbed
still higher in the bush and slept sandwiched cosily between its
" parents ". Next day they kept trying to entice the chick to fly across
the lane and into the tall beech trees beyond, but returned each time
the mite protested at being left alone. On the 15th, however, only
forty-eight hours after leaving the nest, it had attained a perch 50 feet
up in the big trees, which must have entailed an upward flight of at

least 20 yards to the lowest branches, an almost incredible feat for
such a minute and inexperienced creature. There it stayed until
22nd July, when it accompanied the adults back to the garden, its
tail three-quarters grown, the orbital ring pale yellow, its bill darkening
and legs already tinged with grey.
Even when it had been out of the nest for ten days the old birds
would lean over and peer expectantly beneath the chick's tail after
each feed, delicately removing the faecal sac or gently prodding its
vent when nothing was forthcoming.
At this time the female disappeared and never returned, the youngster
and its step-father remaining together till the 16th August, when they
too vanished.
It is a sad end to the story. I am convinced that none of them went
away but they may have drowned in a nearby water-butt or been
caught by some lurking cat. Be that as it may, I now have two new,
true pairs of White-Eyes and, all being well, I hope to repeat the
experiment in 1962.

Further news of the Pink-footed family. Towards the end of 1959
the brood of four became very much more spread. The goose would
seem to be much more on watch than the gander, but the gander moves
other Pink-footed and Barnacles on when the brood wishes to go where
they are.
21st December, iggg. --Gander on watch to-day. It would seem that
goose and gander take turn about on watch, changing over every
few days.
2gth December. --The 1957 gander goes with old goose No. 1 (born
previous to 1939) and always calls loudly when he loses her : she is
very fond of sitting quietly in the sun or out of the wind, he seems at
times to forget where she is.
gth January, ig6o.-- Pink-footed goslings as well as their parents chase
the other Pink-footed if too close to them, the goslings have light
coloured tips to their primaries. All the geese show preference for
soaked lucerne nuts over potatoes, the Wigeon are the same, also the
Pintail. They were all reared with a lot of lettuce and still show a
preference for it.

doubtful strains ; this does not happen in nature.

igth June. --Old lady off nest, has been pecked on head, she never
went back to nest, but was all right in herself. I am suspicious she
was disturbed by Barnacle gander, as she never had a gander near her.
There were four eggs in the nest. I think all these eggs were clear.
Again hatching under hens as against nature. If you do have a gander
and goose and they are not a true pair, the eggs, if any, will not be
fertile ; further the gander may be a bad husband and not protect
the goose,doubtful results unless you have only one pair. With regard to
the old lady and 1957 gander, I now feel she was only a mother to him.

the goose when she was sitting, always some distance away. However,
if anything went near her he was at once on the spot and chased the

if he gets the chance.

times, but it always walked back in the direction of its home, though
I could not hear the others calling. Eventually it jumped and flew
right over some high trees and flew towards home. It was raining hard
as I went home. I could not see it and had lunch. After lunch it
was outside pen, I went to it, it jumped up and flew in. I have found
that generally speaking when you have full-winged young birds,
first time out they don't fly in but walk to netting on pond-side and are
fairly easily picked up. Second time out, they jump nine times out
of ten.

continue with the Pink-footed and have too many geese for the area.
Before I took out the Barnacle, the Pink-footed were the master birds
and I had to feed the Barnacle to themselves. Pink-footed now much
like a wild flock, take very little notice of wild Pink-footed flying

Early efforts to maintain hummingbirds in captivity were only
partially successful, since the birds invariably succumbed after short
periods. The problem was mainly a nutritional one, resulting from
the use of diets composed entirely of sugar or honey solutions. Addition
of a protein component made it possible to maintain hummingbirds for
longer periods, and records of individuals of several species living over
five years in captivity are relatively common today (Ruschi, 1949 ;
Cordier, 1952 ; Reventlow, 1953).
Hummingbirds are among the smallest warm blooded animals
in the world and deserve more physiological investigation than they
have received. The few studies available on these animals (Odum,
1941 ; Pearson, 1950 ; Howell and Dawson, 1954 ; Bartholomew,
Howell, and Cade, 1957) reveal interesting properties such as nocturnal
torpidity and high metabolic and heart rates, but the data are based
on a limited number of birds of but three species. Several of the birds
included were obtained under purely fortuitous circumstances. No
effort has been made to utilize large numbers of hummingbirds over
extended periods of time in physiological experimentation.
During the past two years, I have been studying the physiology of
hummingbirds which have been maintained under laboratory condi-
tions. Most of the seventy-odd birds studied in the laboratory were
captured in southern California and transported about 2,500 miles
by airplane to Ann Arbor, Michigan. Among these birds are represen-
tatives of the following species : Calypte anna , C. costae, Selasphorus rufus,
S. sasin, Archilochus alexandri, A. colubris, and Stellula calliope . Our
understanding of the biology of these smallest of birds will benefit
from more intensive study. In the interest of encouraging others to
utilize hummingbirds in experimental studies, this report is presented
on the methods employed in capturing these birds and maintaining
them in the laboratory.
The hummingbirds were captured with nylon mist nets of i-inch
mesh (Bleitz Wildlife Foundation), at regularly established feeding
stations or in natural plant associations frequented by these birds.
Hummingbirds are creatures of habit ; a given bird often using the
same perches and the same flight paths in an area. By careful observa-
tions, one can discern the major flight paths used by most birds. Paths
that lead between bushes provide the most suitable sites for the place-
ment of nets, since the birds often fly along these at considerable speeds

Stellula calliope, a = o.\&amp;quot;, b = 4&amp;quot;, for Calypte anna, a = 3&amp;quot;, b = 5&amp;quot;. Hole
must fit tightly over head of bird.
Usually the mist nets are set before dawn, when the shadows of early
morning make them less visible to flying birds. In full daylight, the
birds will rarely fly into a net unless frightened into it or distracted by
another bird. With properly placed nets, it is not unusual to capture
considerable numbers of birds within one half hour after sunrise.
Often one is even able to capture a desired individual by observing the
birds in a given area and placing the nets accordingly.
Individual flannel jackets (Fig. 1) are prepared in advance of pro-
curing the birds. The sizes of the jackets are determined by the size
of the hummingbirds which are sought. The size of the head hole is of
particular importance, since a jacket that does not fit snugly over the
head may allow the bird to work its way out of confinement. The birds
are secured in jackets by straight pins (Figs. 2 and 3). Both Ruschi
(Greenewalt, i960), and Bleitz (personal communcation) utilize
jackets for transporting hummingbirds, but theirs are of different
design.
Hummingbirds struggle little when their wings are restrained and
they can be transported long distances in their flannel jackets without
disrupting their feathers. They appear to adjust quickly to their
situation and will accept food readily. Restraint by this method is
certainly preferable to allowing them to fly in a small space during
transportation where they often dash themselves against the walls and
arrive at their destination in poor condition.

In order to facilitate the handling of a large number of birds, I con-
structed a balsa wood carrying case (Fig. 4). The case is equipped
with a sliding door and screened openings for ventilation. The indi-
vidual compartments are 1 by 1 by 4 inches for the species of humming-
birds from California. The birds can be " filed " away as they are
caught, and with appropriate notes one can easily keep track of each
bird until it is banded. The case is constructed so that the compart-
ments slope upwards toward the front, when it is on a level surface.
This prevents the birds from falling out of the case, if they struggle.
The handle is mounted off-center on the top of the case so that a similar
slope is maintained while the birds are being carried.
During transportation, newly captured birds are given sugar solution
through a syringe fitted with a piece of glass tubing (inside diameter,
5 mm.). If the birds have been in captivity and are accustomed to a
protein solution, I offer this to them instead. They usually eat greedily,
often reaching down or over with their bills to steal a snack, while a
neighboring bird is being fed.
Although fourteen hours is the longest period I have confined the
birds in jackets (Riverside, California, to Ann Arbor, Michigan, i960),

I see no reason why they could not successfully be confined for longer
periods. With the changing of soiled jackets and regular feedings,
one could probably maintain them in good condition for several days.
In the laboratory, the birds are housed in Drosophila -tight cages
(Fig. 5). Birds of seven species that I have maintained do quite nicely
in cages 20 by 20 by 40 inches. Larger cages might be preferable for
larger species. I keep from three to eight birds in a cage, and the cages
can be partitioned into two smaller units. Tight-fitting doors and
paneling of fine-mesh nylon curtain material suffice to keep the
Drosophila from escaping the cages. The nylon curtain material is also
soft enough to prevent injury of the birds and damage to their feathers,
should they fly into it. The small (6 by 6 inch) doors are mounted
bottom center at the front of the cage. The birds normally fly near the
top of the cage and this door placement minimizes the possibility of
birds escaping during the daily servicing of the cages. Each cage is
provided with several perches of J-inch wood doweling. Shallow dishes
containing water are regularly available for bathing.
Two, and occasionally three, feeders are used in each cage. Since
a hummingbird will sometimes claim one feeding area, the feeders
should be widely spaced. An aggressive individual may completely
prevent other birds from feeding, making it necessary to isolate the bird,
or place it in with other bullies. Hummingbird feeders can be inex-
pensively constructed from test tubes, rubber stoppers, and glass tubing
with an inside diameter of 6 or 7 mm.
Hummingbirds should have food available to them constantly
during their waking hours, because of their high metabolic rates. I
have successfully maintained them using either of two diets.
Diet 1. Sugar solution (1 part sugar : 3 parts water) available at all
times and a minimum of 20 Drosophila for each bird per day. The
hummingbirds I have maintained weigh 1 -9-5*7 gms. Larger birds
would require a larger daily supply of insects.
Diet 2. Protein solution during day (1 \ tsp. Mellin's Food, 1 \ tsp.
Ledinac, 3 tsp. Evaporated Milk, 8 drops Vipenta, \ pint granulated
sugar, red food coloring, the mixture diluted to one pint). Sugar
solution (as used in Diet 1) during night. Hummingbirds do not feed
at night but it is impractical to change feeders at dawn and dusk.
Since protein solution may spoil, the use of sugar water assures
a supply of unspoiled food at dawn. The red food coloring (Quaker
brand) acts as an indicator, losing its color if the protein solution spoils.
Both the day and night solutions are made in large batches and kept
in the refrigerator. Evaporated milk should be from a newly opened
can, since older milk hastens the spoilage of the solution.
I often supplement the protein sugar diet (2) by releasing available
Drosophila in the cages. The fruit flies are hunted by the birds, thus
providing a useful form of exercise in addition to nutritional value.

However, the birds do perfectly well over long periods without any
Drosophila. G. Davall, of the New York Zoological Society, considers
fruit flies useful but not essential in maintaining hummingbirds
(personal communication).
Illumination is provided by daylight and ioo watt incandescent
lights. The lights are controlled by a poultry timer, to maintain a
daily photoperiod of twelve hours. Since these lights go off immediately,
flying birds could be stranded on the walls or floor of the cages. I
normally supplement the lights controlled by the poultry timer with a
small room light or natural daylight, to allow the birds to settle.
After the birds have settled, the cages are darkened. An automatic
dimmer switch, as described by Reventlow (1953) would be useful
here. Room temperatures are maintained at 68* to 76* F.
While the cages are large enough to allow adequate room for flight,
I am able to reach into all portions of them through the doors with my
hands. A selected bird is captured by hand, generally by trapping it
against the wall of the cage. The bird is then confined in a flannel
jacket or a small paper bag for weighing, depending on the nature of
the experiment to be undertaken. Individual records are kept on body
weights, moulting, etc.
Hummingbirds are surprisingly hardy creatures, and survive for
long periods if their basic maintenance requirements are fulfilled.
The forty birds I now have on hand require daily attention amounting
to an hour a day. Unfortunately, one half of this hour falls in the early
morning, the other in the late afternoon. However, hummingbirds
are such charming and interesting creatures that the effort is amply
repaid.

BREEDING THE DERBY FLYCATCHER
(Pitangus sulphuratus)

This handsome yellow and chestnut-brown bird with a distinctive
black and white head is more frequently referred to by British
aviculturists as the Sulphury Tyrant or the Kiskadee. One of the
larger members of the Tyrant Flycatcher family--Tyrannidae--their
range is from Southern Texas down to as far as the Argentine.
Some 10 inches in total length, they are readily identifiable, in
addition to their colouring, by their stout, strong bill, resembling more
that of a Kingfisher than a Flycatcher, and their powerful legs. The
sexes are dissimilar, the female having much paler underparts and the
wings and tail are a dull brown as compared to the rich chestnut of
the male. Further, they are slightly smaller in build.
Although to be found over a vast area in North, Central, and
South America, it was not realised how hardy they really are until the
pair owned by Mr. Boehm spent the entire winter of 1960-61, one of
the severest in New Jersey for many years, in an open aviary with just
a room to come into if they so desired. It is known that they did retire
to this shelter normally in the evening in company with the Black-
headed Sibias, Red-vented Bulbuls, Blue-winged Sivas, and several
other birds, all occupying the same enclosure. However, during the
day, snow or rain, frozen lake, snow covered shrubs and ground, there
they would be found on some of the highest branches looking very
arrogant with their upright stance and defying the world with their
strong strident call.
This pair had nested in i960, but the female must have been
disturbed somehow or other for, after sitting for some eighteen days,

she finally deserted her eggs, three of which were found to contain
chicks almost fully formed, the fourth being clear. They measured
23 by 17 mm. and were pale buff in main colouring with light fleckings
in brown.
The nest, constructed entirely by the female with her mate bringing-
some of the materials, was made of coarse grasses, reeds, and twigs,
the lining being of fine grasses and feathers. It was a dome-shaped
structure measuring some 8 inches high and wide and about 10 inches
in depth, with the entrance hole low down on one side. It had been
built in the fork of the branches of a pine tree overhanging the waterfall,
but faced away from the fall and the lake.
Although the nest had stood up well during the winter months, in
May, 1961, the female rebuilt it at the same site. Again four eggs were
laid and incubation appeared to commence with the laying of the
second. Both birds tended the eggs, but it was not discerned if they
took definite periods of the day or just sat indiscriminately. It is known
that the female usually was to be found on the nest first thing in
the morning for it became quite a hazardous affair taking around the
morning feed. As soon as anyone approached the nesting area the
male would dive on them and, after one or two scratched heads, it
was deemed advisable to wear a hat when necessity called for a visit
to that particular end of the aviary. His belligerency was not confined
to humans for he was relentless in chasing away any bird that
approached his tree. However, he did not pursue them once they had
sheared away and no steps were taken to remove any of the other
inmates as it was considered, and subsequently proved, unnecessary.
On 28th May, nineteen days after the laying of the second egg, the
female was seen to be gathering up the mealworms fed to her and taking
them to the nest. Due to the number of birds in the aviary, some
sixty or so, and the fact that some of them were also raising families, it
was decided to set up a separate live-food tray for the Kiskadees. This
was a venture that called for stout headgear and rapid action.
However, whilst it was being placed in position the opportunity was
taken for a quick peep into the nest. True enough there was one chick.
Two more were hatched during the next two days, the final egg being
discovered later to be clear.
Now the male was more aggressive than ever although he never
actually attacked when the live-food was being placed in their tray.
It was during the approach to, and the retirement from, the region
that the attacks took place. No attempt was made to re-examine the
nest for a further five days and then a swift look at the young birds
showed that they were covered with a white down. At this visit both
birds were so disturbed that it was decided to leave them strictly alone
in future.
On 19th June, one chick left the nest and was flying strongly almost

immediately. It was a counterpart of its female parent except that the
underparts were much paler, almost white, and the crown of the head
was brownish, as compared to the black of the adults. Since neither
parent paid any further attention to the nest but assidiously attached
themselves to the fledgling, a final look revealed that the other two
chicks had died in the nest. It was assessed that they had been about
five to six days old. The fourth egg was clear.
The young bird became independent twelve days after leaving the
nest, that is at about five weeks old, but still consorted with its parents.
By this time the crown of its head had turned black and the underparts
had taken on more yellow in their colouring. At three months old it
had moulted out and shown that it was a male. This fact was made
apparent not only by its colour, but also by the fact that the adult male
had now begun to chase it. To avoid any catastrophe, it was caught up
and placed in an adjoining aviary where it spends most of the day
calling to, and being answered by, its parents.
Although the pair constructed another nest in one of the nest-boxes
positioned principally for the starlings, no further eggs were laid that
season. Nevertheless, whenever anyone goes near to this nest, even
during the winter, as it is at the time of this report being written, he
dives on them and even strikes now and again. It is to be hoped that
they will use this site next year for, from the observation aspect, it is
far better positioned than the original one was.
So far as I can ascertain from the breeding records I have been able
to examine, this breeding of the Derby Flycatcher by Edward Marshall
Boehm is the first of its kind in captivity in a private collection.

For the past several years my Japanese Turdus cordis had been rearing
one to five young per year out of several nests (usually three per season).
This year, unfortunately, the female Lesser Bird of Paradise killed the
sitting female Turdus cordis. Last year one male and three female
Turdus cordis were reared and it was one of these young females that
was released into one of our largest aviaries, that mated with a
Mexican Turdus grayi. Three young were reared from the first nest
but none from the next two broods. Mites killed the second lot and
the third lot (all in the same nest) left the nest but disappeared.
I had sprayed the nest with mite killer after brood number two
succumbed.
The first three young were taken and hand-reared after they had
left the nest.

Two females and one male was the result of this breeding. The
young male is rather pretty, having very dark, almost black wings, an
almost white belly with speckled breast and some russet about the face,
back dark grey.
A male Turdus cordis is a very pretty bird with white belly, black
wings and upper parts, and a song that ranks with the world's best.
I remember my much missed good friend the Marquis Hachisuka
telling me he made special trips to the slopes of Mt. Fujiyama just to
hear Turdus cordis sing in the spring. It will be interesting to learn
what kind of song this hybrid will have. The male grayi has a rather
plaintive song, not nearly as rich as his all brown cousin, often caged
in Mexico and called by the Mexicans " Prima Vera ", a fitting name.
Although these three young hybrids were hand-reared they have
become quite wild. The male is separated from the two females as he
is quite the bully.
The nest was rather typical of the race, leaves, grass, feathers, and
mud--quite a compacted structure.
This large aviary, approximately 50 feet by 50 feet and 18 feet high
at the highest point with shelter of 14 feet by 12 feet by 9 feet, contains
Anis, Rollers, Bulbuls, Kildeer, Mexican Thrushes, Golden Oriole,
Kiskadees, Mynahs, Glossy Starlings, Brazilian Cardinal male, Indian
Shrike, Meadowlarks, Mesias, a Shearwater, etc.
One interesting thing was that the male Brazilian Cardinal helped
feed the young hybrids. The male Mexican Turdus grayi did most of
the feeding and would take some fourteen to fifteen mealworms at a
time in his beak. He also fed meat and fruits.
Other birds reared in 1961 :--
Three Red-eared Bulbuls, a Black-headed Green Bulbul helped in
feeding these young.
Five Common Babblers were reared.
Five Shamas were reared.
Struthideas had their usual many young in several nests, but none
reared.
One " Loochoo " Robin reared.
One Jilguero (Mexican Brown-winged Solitaire).

I present the following article, in which I record various observations,
which I have remarked in my waterfowl collection, with some diffidence,
since I feel they are probably well-known to the experienced breeder.
But I cannot remember reading about these various points in the
literature available, so I hope they may be of help and interest to other
beginners.
i. Indiscriminate Nesting
The books tell one about the intense secrecy maintained by ducks
when going to nest and describe the way each one will steal away to
its chosen site, which it keeps strictly to itself. My birds, however,
in spite of having ample nesting cover and plenty of nesting boxes,
fly in the face of convention and the expert, by ganging-up together and
by using a different, and, mark this, communal nest each day.
Thus, a fat Red-crested Pochard will squeeze herself into a low-
placed barrel designed for a Carolina, whilst I watch trembling from
afar, fearing incipient prolapse. When she has laid perhaps a Carolina
will take possession, guarded by her mate, while, outside, other anxious
females, such as Chiloe Wigeon and Mandarin, stamp impatiently
up and down awaiting their turn. Finally, probably in the afternoon,
both male and female Fulvous Tree Duck enter and have a fine
time rolling all the various eggs around until the female has added her
share to the nest-full.
Next day, this behaviour will be repeated at another site, even
though I have left the nest and eggs undisturbed. Needless to say,
this behaviour makes the consequent sorting-out of eggs into clutches
of the same species or similar length of incubation period somewhat
difficult. I only wish my birds would read the authorities.

2. Moulting Patterns
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.998003727272727" page_id="56317071"  page_num="68" year="" vol="">
When certain species of diving ducks are emerging from eclipse the
new feathers first appear on the belly and gradually spread up the
flanks. This is particularly noticeable in Tufted and Scaup, with
whom one can see the slow spread of the gleaming new white feathers
forming a definite " Plimsoll Line ", which rises up the bird's flanks
until only those plumes covering the wings are left in the muddy
eclipse colour. This pattern is not followed so strictly by juveniles
moulting-out from first feather. With them, the line of demarcation
is much more broken and patchy.
Surface-feeding species, too, put on their motley much more at

3. Adolescent Surface-feeders Asleep

I noticed that all my young Chiloes and Shovelers, at the age when
they were assuming their first feather, habitually slept on the water
in " rafts ", after the manner of adult diving ducks. This habit
ceased as the birds grew older and they then slept on the shore like
their elders.
Might this not be a form of self-preservation since they had not
grown their flights and were thus less able to make a quick escape
from a predator ?

This is a section strictly for the beginner ! Do not let your hopes
be buoyed too high when you see the females of your rarer breeds
inviting and receiving coition from their mates. Even though they
may get as far as peering excitedly into nest-boxes or making
" scrapes ", it is probably nothing but a snare and a delusion nine
times out of ten and will result in nothing but a sad disappointment
for their owner, The acceptance of the drake's attentions does not

5. The Incubation Period of Fulvous Tree Duck

<bodyText confidence="0.9526215" page_id="56317072"  page_num="69" year="" vol="">
Though I tremble to dispute the undoubted authority of
M. Delacour, who states in his authoritative work on Waterfowl that
the incubation period of the above is thirty to thirty-two days, I have
found with three clutches of eggs sat from two females that the time
of incubation was invariably twenty-three to twenty-five days. I keep
a most careful record and know there was no error since I was caught
unawares by the arrival of the first brood and did not wish to be
found without a good supply of pond-weed for the ducklings again.
Might this be a peculiarity of my strain of Fulvous ? I would like
to know other breeders' experiences.

This is a delightful little species, the " bantam " of the Tree Ducks.
They become very tame, though presumably wild-caught, and are
well able to take care of themselves in a mixed collection because
of their voracious appetites. Mine are insatiable for their food,
gorging until their crops are pendulous and furiously pecking and
" nattering " at any bird, even if it is as large as a Philippine Duck or
Wigeon which may stand where they wish to feed. These last always
give ground to the much smaller Tree Duck. Even the bossy Fulvous
are forced to move, though they are twice the size.
Indian Tree Duck often swim unusually low in the water, reminding
one of the " neck-awash " habit of the Red-throated Diver. They are
not nervous when they do this, nor does their plumage lack oil, to
judge by the plum-like " bloom " on their backs.

70 A. LENDON-NOTES ON THE GOLDEN-SHOULDERED PARRAKEET
6. Conclusion
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.989018318181818" page_id="56317073"  page_num="70" year="" vol="">
My final proposition may, I fear, cause cries of horror from more
purist keepers of waterfowl than I. It is that I do wish that there was
some way by which the wearisome period of dull eclipse plumage could
be shortened without detriment to the bird. Where a collection of
ducks is kept for public exhibition or for the sale of young stock, as
well as for their owner's unceasing delight and worry, it is so unsatis-
factory, for all parties, that he has, throughout the summer, to perform
a continual " Ruth Draper " act, when describing the potentially
fascinating colours of some drab drake, by exclaiming, " Oh, but you
should see how magnificently decorative this Mandarin (or Common
Pintail or Falcated Teal) will look in the winter and spring ! 55
Unfortunately, in Britain, the summer is the season when it is most
pleasant for people to view the collection and admire the antics of the
birds. In the late spring strangers must be forbidden the enclosure
because of nesting activities, and in the cold winds earlier in the season
only your real enthusiast is happy to stand and stare--and he needs no
elucidation anyway !
All Curators of collections in urban parks must have had experience
of this problem ; so will those breeders who have had to recourse to
an unsatisfactorily coloured illustration when displaying their birds
to a potential customer.
Might not an injection of some sex-hormone do the trick ?

Further to my article on the Golden-shouldered Parrakeet published
in Avicultural Magazine, Vol. 66, p. 90, some breeding results may
be of interest. A clutch of four eggs was laid in mid-September, i960,
three were fertile and hatched on 12 th October, but all the young birds
died within the first week. This year (1961) the first egg of a clutch of
five was laid on 29th August : three young had hatched on
23rd September and all five by the following day. The first young bird
left the nest on 28th October, two more the following day, and the last
two the next day. All are now independent and in fine shape. They
closely resemble the adult hen on leaving the nest but those I believe
to be cocks have a considerable amount of turquoise on the cheeks

and, surprisingly, a greenish frontal band, whilst the hens have very
little blue on the cheeks and a distinct yellowish frontal band. All have
a well marked dark brownish cap which becomes black in the adult
male and remains distinct in the adult female. Apart from Sir Edward
Hallstrom's many successes with the species, this is the only recorded
breeding in captivity ; the possessor of another pair in this state has
had the misfortune to lose a clutch both last year and this. From the
time the young hatched, the hen seemed to brood them very seldom,
quite unlike the habit of their close relative the Hooded Parrakeet.
The breeding took place in a nest-box supplied by Sir Edward, this
being the only occasion that I have bred parrakeets in other than a
hollow log; the dimensions are shown in the accompanying sketch.

A NEW AVIARY AT WASSENAAR
Members who have visited the Wassenaar Zoo will have seen the
Louise Hall in which a fine collection of birds is housed, most of them
in large aviaries, and where the Red-billed Hornbill, South African
Stone Curlew, and other species have been bred.
At the end of this hall the pathway leads through high rockwork and
one comes into a very large, new outdoor aviary, the accompanying
photograph giving some idea of the size and general design. Visitors
to this " walk-through " aviary pass under cover through its whole
length, retracing their steps to go back into the Louise Hall, the
darkened entrance formed by the high rockwork preventing the escape
of the birds.
The aviary is so shaped that the higher trees and shrubs can be
grown at the back and the purpose of the strong framework is to
withstand the weight of snow, which, over so large an area of roof,
might be considerable. A low retaining wall keeps visitors to the
</bodyText>

pathway. Pheasant-tailed Jacanas, Argentine Lapwings, Egyptian
Plovers, Turacos, Red-headed Marsh Birds, and Tanagers were among
the birds that I especially remember seeing in this splendid aviary.

72 FOREIGN BIRDS AT THE NATIONAL CAGE BIRD SHOW, OLYMPIA

<bodyText confidence="0.943693595238095" page_id="56317077"  page_num="72" year="" vol="">
1961 again showed an increase in foreign birds at the National, and,
what is perhaps even more encouraging, a considerable increase in the
number of foreign exhibitors--by which I really mean the number of
exhibitors showing foreign birds. On the whole I thought the seed-
eaters rather dull ; plenty of good specimens but few rarities. What
struck me particularly was the absence of any Gouldian Finches except
for a single one in the class for abnormal coloured birds ; now that
Gouldians are practically domesticated, one would expect to see plenty
of good ones at the National and I missed their brilliant colours.
What really did attract me were the three cages of fine parrot-
finches on show ; the President of the Danish Budgerigar Society,
W. Langberg, showed two pairs bred by himself--a really lovely and
perfectly matched pair of Peale's taking first place and the award for
best small seedeater and a pair of Blue-faced second. The third pair,
Red-faced, belonged to Messrs. Hunt and Davis.
I was also very taken with a bright little pair of Blue-billed Waxbills
shown by I. Whitehouse ; these came second in their class to M. Coles'
charming pair of Fernando Po Mannikins.
Mrs. Draper's handsome Yellow-bellied Grosbeak won its class and
the award for best large seedeater. The class for " All other small
seedeaters " was most attractive ; this was led by J. Howard's
Rhodospingas and also contained Schlegel's, Verreaux's, and Green
Twinspots, Rosy-rumped Waxbills, a Many-coloured Ground Finch,
Blue-capped Waxbills, Yellow-faced Grass Quits, and several Pytilias.
The " All other large seedeaters " class consisted of only one entry,
J. Howard's Yellow-billed Sparrow.
I liked G. Whitmore's smart little pair of Firefinches, C. Varney's
St. Helena Waxbills, K. J. Lawrence's Black-tailed Lavender Finches
and Mrs. Scamell's Yellow-breasted Bunting. J. Howard was showing
a pair of Red-crested Whydahs which I thought interesting, but they
were not quite ready and I wondered if they were a true pair.
The " softbill " section was quite delightful with many new species
on show. Outstanding was Mrs. Scamell's Paradise Flycatcher which
well deserved to win best foreign ; I think this is the first time that one
has been shown in perfect feather. The hummingbird class had
thirteen entries, most of which were present. This was won by E. C.
Lewis' Violet-eared, in immaculate condition, followed closely by
J. Forrest's Blue-chinned Brilliant, a White-breasted Emerald, a
Fleine's, and a Tufted Coquette.
Mrs. Scamell won the sunbird class with her very lovely pair of
Yellow-backed ; second was R. E. Oxley's Orange-breasted. Others
were a nice Bronze, Amethyst, Regal, Taccazze, and Malachite.

<bodyText confidence="0.916807888888889" page_id="56317078"  page_num="73" year="" vol="">
Sugarbirds were led by G. Anderdon's Red-thighed, a very steady bird
in perfect condition, followed by Mrs. Scamelfs Blue ; there were also
several good Yellow-winged, Isthmians, G. Anderdon's Gurney's Natal
and Ecuador Blue.
The class for small tanagers was won by E. Beale's attractive
Euphonia, described in the catalogue as a " Bandalero ", but more
usually known as a Blue-backed Euphonia. In the same class were some
nice Turquoise-naped Chlorophonias, a pair of Emerald-spotted,
Schrank's, a Flame-headed, Scarlet-backed, and Silver-throats.
Mrs. Scamell's pair of Formosan Black Bulbuls won the next class,
followed by J. Forrest's Silver-blue Tanager, also several other species
of large tanager, the Crimson-crowned, Yellow-rumped, Scarlet, and
Blue Mountain, a Shama, and a Red-eared Bulbul.
The flycatcher class was a triumph for Mrs. Scamell who won the
first six cards, all with outstanding birds. First came the lovely Paradise,
then a rare Blue-fronted Redstart, a delightful Black-naped Flycatcher,
a Snowy-headed Robin-Chat and a Daurian and White-capped
Redstart. Seventh was R. E. Ridge's Natal Robin.
Mrs. Scamell then went on to win the thrush class with a very fine
Blue-headed Rock Thrush, followed by J. R. Hayes' Hardwicke's
Fruit-sucker and G. Anderdon's good old White-eared Jay-Thrush.
G. Whitmore's Amethysts won the starling class followed by some
good Spreos, and the Mynah class went to Miss Leishman's Mandarins,
followed by G. Anderdon's Common Mynah, wrongly described in
the catalogue as an Indian Hill. The Toucan class was very fine,
here again Mrs. Scamell won with her magnificent Toco, with
J. W. Ranson's Buffon's Touracos second and G. Whitmore's Ross's
Violet Plantain-eater third. I was also very taken with Hunt and
Davis' Blue-bellied Hill Toucan and Hammond and Harris'
Culminated Toucan, which I had not seen before.
G. Whitmore's Thick-billed Fruit Pigeons won their class over
Mrs. Cook's Californian Quail, G. Anderdon's Mourning Doves, and
two pairs of Chinese Painted Quail. With so many interesting pigeons
and doves now on the market, I was sorry not to see more species
staged.
The class for " A.O.V. small insectivorous " went to Mrs. Scamell's
charming Red-headed Tits ; second came a much discussed entry of
Mrs. Scamell's, catalogued as a Flowerpecker. One school of thought
classified this as a Fiery-breasted Flowerpecker while others were
convinced it was a sunbird. I am now told that it has definitely been
identified as a Red-cheeked Sunbird. Third in this class was
Mrs. Draper's well-known White-bearded Honey-eater and there
were also some Banana Quits, a Coppersmith Barbet, Ixulus, Yuhinas,
and Minivets. " A.O.V. medium-sized insectivorous " was also a good
class, led by Mrs. Scamell's Fairy Bluebirds, followed by Mrs. Draper's

<bodyText confidence="0.969758533333333" page_id="56317079"  page_num="74" year="" vol="">
Red-headed Marshbird, A. T. Worrall's Brown-hooded Kingfisher,
several pittas and barbets, Ruby-throats, a Baltimore Oriole, and a
Mousebird. I particularly liked the Toucan-billed Barbet which,
when the Show closed, accompanied " God save the Queen " in perfect
time and quite good harmony. " A.O.V. large insectivorous " went to &apos;
G. Whitmore's Rufous-bellied Mot-Mot, a bird of which I am very
fond, with Mr. and Mrs. Humphrey's Red-billed Blue Magpies second
and A. Clare's Bell Bird third. I also liked J. Howard's Lilac-breasted
Roller.
In the " Parrot-like " section I felt that the parrakeet classes could
have been much better filled ; in fact I wondered if the prohibitive
cost of rail tranport had prevented many parrot-like from attending.
There were some fine specimens on view but few " collector's pieces ".
L. Stevenson's Crimson-winged Parrakeets well deserved the Best
Parrot-like award, as they were a fine pair and in sparkling condition.
The Lovebird classes were quite well filled, best Lovebird going to
R. Wyatt's nice pair of Abyssinian. The Lory, Lorikeet, and Hanging
Parrot class was also good, this being won by G. Whitmore's delightful
pair of Blue-crowned Hanging Parrots. I would like to have seen
more hanging parrots, the only other exhibit being another Blue-
crowned ; in fact, I would like to see these charming little birds have a
class to themselves, but unfortunately very few seem to be imported at
present. There were some handsome lories in the same class, several
Yellow-backs, a pair of Mitchell's and a Chattering Lory, also a pair of
Swainson's Lorikeets. A. W. Bolton won the Cockatoo and Macaw
class with his very nice Noble Macaws, with G. Anderdon's well-known
Roseate Cockatoos second ; another pair of Roseates, G. Anderdon's
very tame Citron-crested and an Illiger's Macaw made up the class.
The first parrakeet class I thought most disappointing with only
two entries, but both L. Stevenson's winning Crimson-wings and
A. W. Bolton's Rock Peplar were well worth seeing. Again there were
only two exhibits in the class for Grass Parrakeets, L. Stevenson's
lovely Elegants and Hunt and Davis' Turquoisines could have led a
much larger class. The Broadtail class was better filled, but only just,
with four out of the seven entries staged. Here H. Willis' pair of
Pennant's beat G. Anderdon's single cock Pennant's followed by a
Golden-mantle and another pair of Pennant's. W. E. J. Tasker's pair
of Cockatiels led a class of six. The class for all other long-tailed
parrakeets was won by D. M. Coward's Malabar with Mr. and
Mrs. Hooley's Tuis second, the rest of the class consisting of Ringnecks.
Mrs. Draper's fine pair of Ruppell's won the parrot class from C. W.
Desmond's Mealy Amazon, followed by J. P. George's Mealy Amazon,
G. Anderdon's White-bellied Caique (which also won a card in the
talking class), an Eclectus and a couple of African Greys.
The " Abnormal-coloured and hybrid " class was again won by

<bodyText confidence="0.9854994375" page_id="56317080"  page_num="75" year="" vol="">
Mrs. Lewis' Swainson x Red-collared Lorikeet, followed by J. P.
Boyt's Nyassa x Masked Lovebird. Here also was the only Gouldian
on show, a black-breasted. I have seen this mutation before and
personally I think it is not an improvement on the shining brilliance of
a normal Gouldian. I liked very much the Bicheno's x Zebra and the
Bengalese x Diamond Sparrow.
Last, but by no means least, I must make special mention of the
delightful display staged by the Parks Department of the London
County Council. The most devoted supporter of the National must
admit that tramping round Olympia can be a weary and dusty
business. The unexpected sight of a cool lawn and water garden,
surrounded by tropical plants and shrubs, complete with an aviary
of exotic birds and a pair of Flamingos standing in the pond, was a
real refreshment and a memory to take away with one.
Obviously the visitors were fascinated with the display and a big
crowd was to be seen there throughout each day. Some of the
comments on the stately and impassive Flamingos were most amusing,
such as, " Look, they're alive, I thought they were made of plastic ! "
or "What are they? Penguins?", "No, eagles!". The aviary
contained a fine show of rare birds, all in magnificent condition, and
including Raymond Sawyer's fine old Rothschild's Grackle, a Blue-
shouldered Mountain Tanager, a pair of Macaws, Bulbuls, Starlings,
and many others. This innovation was a touch of genius, and I hope
it may become a permanency.
If these notes appear disjointed or incoherent, I can only plead that
while writing them, my Caique has insisted on sitting either on my
hand or on my shoulder, rubbing his head against my cheek or
reaching for my cigarette. Once he nipped the lighted end and bounced
off with an indignant squawk on to an adjacent chair where he sat
looking reproachfully at me and saying " Bad boy, bad boy ! ". But
this did not stop him coming back to interfere again.

A Maned Owl {Jubula letti ) collected in Sierra Leone and, it would
appear, the first record for that country, has been presented and is the
first of this species to be in the collection.
It was first described in 1889 by Buttikofer from a specimen collected
in Liberia and some years later Bates collected several in southern
Cameroon. It has been recorded by Chapin from the Congo Forest
near Luebo. It is the only member of the genus Jubula and is a bird of
the forest. Those examined by Bates had only beetle and insect
remains in the stomach.
A pair of Korean Ring-necked Pheasants (Phasianus colchicus karpowi ),
presented by the governmental authorities of Korea through the
zoological gardens at Seoul, are of a race not previously in the collec-
tion. This race rather resembles the well-known Chinese Ring-necked
Pheasant (P. c. torquatus).

Dr. R. E. B. Brown, Newcastle, N.S.W., writes : " I am very busy
trying to save the first nest of Red Tanagers--of this season, as it is a
terribly wet spring, severe floods. I have had luck with the Bleeding
Heart Pigeons ( luzonica ). I started with three and now have over
forty. Concerning inbreeding in birds--there are thousands of

vigour or fertility, in fact they breed like mice if given plenty of white
ants (termites)."

Walther Langberg, Copenhagen, writes : " Last year I had luck
with the Crimson-wings and bred eight young ones. Splendids and
Turquoisines also reared young but not so many as in i960. I had no
suitable accommodation for the Grey Parrots, but I am at present
building new aviaries and I hope to put up the old breeding pair and
a pair of young from 1956. In indoor flights I was fortunate with
Blue-faced and Peale's Parrot Finches, also with Painted and Cherry,
etc. I have recently obtained some Violet-eared Waxbills, Verreaux's
Twin-spots, and Pearl-necked Silverbills."

Curt af Enehjelm, Helsingfors, reports : " Copenhagen Zoo again
reared young Snowy Owls, five I believe. The single Lapland Owl
I gave them laid four (?) eggs. My own pair (?) also laid eggs and sat,
but unfortunately the hen suddenly died, so I am now lending my
single cock (?) to Copenhagen for the next season. All the Snowy
Owls I got from Copenhagen turned out to be cocks and the only
wild-caught one from Finland, an obvious hen, unfortunately died.
Now I have got a new young bird from Copenhagen, a very large one,
so I hope it really is a hen. I have not had any success with owls or
birds of prey this year. The African Eagle-Owls had two young which
died in the nest. A Falco tinnunculus laid eggs, but they were clear."

Charles Lucas, Ivanhoe, Victoria, writing mid-December, says :
" Despite my preoccupation with my professional work I have kept
my birds going and at the present time, towards the end of the current
breeding season, I am simply crowded out and will have to do some-
thing about reducing the stock on hand before very long. I had six
pairs of Princess up this year, four of which produced young, con-
sisting of a one, a two, a three, and a four, making a total of ten and
there is quite a possibility that one or more pairs will go down for a
second time. These young are all on the wing and look to be in very
nice condition. In addition I have got about fifteen Bourke's, about
eighteen Turquoisines, ten Scarlet-chested, and five Elegants. For the
first time I have bred two nests of two each of Spinifex Pigeons. I do
not know whether you know these birds, but the young are the most
delightful pinky, chocolate-coloured fluffy balls. They grow very
rapidly and when they mature they are altogether delightful little
fellows who run about the ground at a great rate, and with their dainty
little crests are altogether lovely little birds. I have also for the first
time bred a young Green-winged Pigeon which is very gratifying.

In addition I have got some finches of different kinds, particularly
Cutthroats who have almost eaten me out of house and home. Seed is
a terrific price here at the present time, due as we are told to drought
conditions in Queensland, but the prices fluctuate so much and vary
between different dealers that we feel that there is something of a
racket on foot in the bird seeds."

That great dove and pigeon enthusiast Professor Carl Naether, of
Encino, California, reports : " After corresponding with Indian
exporters for a period of several years concerning Snow Pigeons, I was
given a pair by a generous zoo director in Europe. Moreover, I
finally obtained some Maiden Doves (Calopelia puella ), which I have
been wanting for a long time, and which, so I understand, have not as
yet been bred in captivity. [This dove, also known as the Gold Coast
Odu or SchlegePs Dove, was bred at the London Zoo in 1951 and
1 953 *] I believe that Jean Delacour also purchased some from the
same importer. Since we had frosty nights at the time the doves came
from the Quarantine Station in New York, and since, supposedly, they
are very sensitive to cold temperatures, I kept them ' under the lamp '
for some weeks. Now they are in an outdoor aviary, where I hope to
breed them this spring, provided, of course, I have a true pair in my
small lot. Approximately six months ago, I purchased a pair of
Bartlett's Bleeding Heart Pigeons, a species which used to breed very
successfully in my aviaries some years ago. Foolishly, I disposed of all
the offspring, only to lose the old hen. Left with only a male, I finally
obtained a mature pair, I believe the only one in California, if not in
the country. The hen was in very poor feather at the time I purchased
the pair. With generous feedings of diced Longhorn cheese, shelled
sunflower seed, and a few mealworms daily, besides the usual seed
mixture, she seemed to improve sufficiently to enable her to lay early
this year ; however, the egg was infertile. The second egg proved to
be fertile, but did not hatch. Still she persisted in laying, and the third
time, a youngster hatched, which is now ten days old, and which both
parents brood persistently and very closely. So, I hope, once again, to
raise these very handsome doves. I might add that a lovely pair of
the Key West Quail Doves, now in perfect feather, show signs of
wanting to nest."

A MEETING OF PARROTS

A letter from me seeking information in regard to a picture called " A Meeting of

brought in no result whatever.
By a strange coincidence I have now discovered the source of the reproduction.

It occurs in The Nation's Pictures, Vol. n, page 44, published by Cassell and Co., Ltd.,
in 1902, and is entitled " A Select Committee " from the picture by H. Stacy Marks,
R.A., in the Walker Art Gallery, Liverpool. Size 46 X 35 inches. Bought in 1891.
The legend continues " This student of bird-life early showed his talent in this
direction. His ' Princess and the Pelicans ' was one of the best of this kind. He sought
subjects of this particular character the more agreeably to present his carefully finished
studies of birds. A frequent visitor to the Zoological Gardens, he there found all the
varieties he desired of parrot life and those shown in the picture were doubtless all
taken from the collection there, and probably are all portraits of particular birds."
Possibly a member resident in the Liverpool area may be able to ascertain whether
the picture is still displayed there.

THE PURPLE GALLINULE IN GREAT BRITAIN
</table>
<bodyText confidence="0.9730186" page_id="56317085"  page_num="80" year="" vol="">
I am interested in the Purple Gallinule ( Porphyrio porphyrio ) which is not accepted
as a British Bird. The Handbook of British Birds says that examples have been captured
from time to time " but these had probably escaped from captivity or semi-captivity ".
Peterson, etc., in a Field Guide to the Birds of Britain and Europe say that it is a vagrant
to Northern France, Norway, etc., which would seem to indicate that there is no
reason why it should not occur wild in this country.
I know of three Dorset records. The first was killed " on the River Frome " some-
time in 1908 and is in the Dorchester Museum. The second was discovered in a field
of marigolds near Bridport in September, 1914. In an exhausted state, it was killed
with a stick and is in the Bridport Museum. The third was seen on Portland on

I should be very glad to know whether it is possible to find out to what extent this
bird has been kept in captivity in this country during the present century, and also
whether any have, in fact, escaped.
Perhaps I should add that, although 2nd January would seem to be an extraordinary
date, there was a very large movement of Redwings, Fieldfares, and Skylarks at the
time, many appearing to come in from the sea.
I shall be most grateful for any help the readers of the Avicultural Magazine can
give me or suggestions they may be able to make.

CAPTIVE ANTARCTIC SKUA SWALLOWING A PINK WOOLLEN GLOVE
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.9861845" page_id="56317085"  page_num="80" year="" vol="">
While visiting the Regent's Park Zoo, London, in November, 1959, I was attracted
by loud calling and squabbling in one of the large aviaries where a number of Antarctic
Skuas ( Catharacta skua antarctica ) were housed. At first they appeared to be fighting for
possession of a piece of raw meat, but on closer investigation I was surprised to discover
that the cause of the disturbance was a pink woollen glove. In fact a number of the
birds were tugging on individual fingers of the glove and an "all in tug of war "
continued for about three minutes. Eventually one of the Skuas broke away and
although closely pursued managed, with some difficulty, to swallow the undamaged
glove.
I later corresponded with Mr. H. N. Southern, Bureau of Animal Population,
Oxford, in reference to the above episode, and his comments were " It is most
interesting and raises lots of possibilities for experiment ".

Loriculus berylliums (Forster)
By G. M. Henry (Constantine, Falmouth, Cornwall)
The genus Loriculus (Coryllis of some authors) comprises a number of
species of short-tailed, sparrow-sized parrots which are distributed
throughout the Indo-Malayan region. In spite of their appellation
of " Lorikeet " they are members of the brush-tongued section of the
Psittaci to which the true Lorikeets belong, and some ornithologists
prefer to call them " Hanging Parrots " or " Bat Parrots " in reference
to their habit of sleeping head downwards, suspended by the feet from
small twigs ; inasmuch, however, as other, unrelated types of parrot
adopt the same sleeping attitude (Prestwich, Avicult. Mag. 1954, 2),
these names do not seem very satisfactory and until a really distinctive
name can be invented for them I prefer to continue calling them

" Lorikeets ".

<bodyText confidence="0.998559388888889" page_id="56317096"  page_num="" year="" vol="">
The Ceylon Lorikeet is confined to the Island, but it is very closely
related to the only Indian species of the genus, L. vernalis, from which it
differs merely in having the crown vividly scarlet in the adult instead
of green ; young birds are probably indistinguishable, and the two
species are best regarded as belonging to a single superspecies.
A very common bird in the Island, it enjoys a wide range but is
patchily distributed in the dry zone (north and east of the south-
central mountains) and is quite absent from all areas of very low rainfall.
Its main centre of population is the foot-hills up to about 3,000 feet,
but it is not uncommon up to 4,000 feet, and in the north-east monsoon
(cool season) it ascends much higher. It moves about the country a
good deal and, though hardly gregarious, it is sociable with its own
kind, associating loosely in numbers wherever a favoured food supply is
abundant. Being strictly arboreal, it never voluntarily descends to the
ground. The flight is swift but undulating, being performed by an
alternation of rapid fluttering followed by a dip with nearly closed
wings ; during the fluttering, a shrill flight-tone is always uttered--
twitwitwit... twitwitwit --which serves to keep its companions acquainted

G. M. HENRY-THE CEYLON LORIKEET
with its movements. Very active, its waking moments are spent either
in clambering about its food tree, or in making long and often circuitous
flights, usually singly. Besides the flight-note, it indulges freely in a
little squeaky warble suggestive of twisting a wet cork in the neck of a
vial ; this is often uttered from a bare twig at the top of a tree. The
food of the Lorikeet consists of sweet and juicy fruits, wild or cultivated,
and the nectar of certain flowering trees, among which those of Dadap
(. Erythrina ) and Silk Cotton [Bombax) are specially favoured. In addi-
tion, it evidently eats certain seeds as I have watched it extracting those
of Casuarina from the small cones of this tree. When toddy is being
collected into pots fixed in the crowns of palms by toddy-drawers the
Lorikeet is given to imbibing the intoxicating liquor so intemperately
that it is easily caught ; numbers of poor little captives, rendered
" tame 55 by having all their primaries pulled out by the roots, used to
be hawked about Colombo on " passenger days 53 (when mail steamers
called at the port) for selling to the gullible. Needless to say, few of
them survived this vile treatment--not to mention the unsuitable diet
provided, of boiled rice and sugar-cane--for more than a few weeks
or months.
The breeding season may extend from January to August, but March
to July are the principal months. In courtship, the male indulges in
amusing attitudinisings, puffing out his blue throat-patch and erecting
his scarlet rump feathers, while he advances along a twig towards his
lady with stilted little runs and hops, squeaking and twit-ing. For a
nesting-site, the pair choose a deep, natural cavity in a tree-trunk or
branch ; for preference, one with a narrow entrance at the top,
vertical or nearly so in direction, and from 2 to 6 feet deep. Dead
Areca palms, whose interior quickly rots away leaving a hollow
cylinder 3 to 4 inches in diameter and open at the top, are much
favoured. The question of site being settled, the female proceeds to
build her nest, which consists of strips, 1 to 2 inches long and about a
quarter inch wide, which she nibbles from the margins of green
leaves. Having cut a strip, she raises her rump feathers and inserts one
end at their base. In doing this, she uses considerable force, seeming
almost to press the end into the skin, but in spite of this many of the
strips fall out. The operation is repeated until a ball of strips is inserted
under the rump feathers, whereupon she flies off to her nest and
deposits them. When a large mass has thus been accumulated, two or
three eggs are laid on the top.
Baby Lorikeets appear to require very damp and rheumaticky
conditions in their nursery, as I once took a fully fledged and healthy
youngster out of a very wet and insanitary cavity in an Areca stump ;
no doubt the mass of slowly decaying green leaves supplies this (from
the human viewpoint, highly unhygienic) environment. Chacun

The male, though he evinces great interest in all these labours, does
not so far as my observation goes, take any active part beyond cheering
his wife with warblings and twits. The female sits very close and, if
disturbed, seeks to repel an invader by angry screeches ; one, wdiose
nest I investigated, interspersed these with what my note describes as
" an extraordinary, heavy, thumping, hollow sound, as if the wood were
being thumped with a hammer. " The method of producing this is a
mystery, but it must have been made by the Lorikeet as it was in series
with the screeches, and ceased when the bird at last departed.
The Lorikeet is easily tamed and does well in an aviary, but only one
pair must be kept together or fighting will ensue. The food should be
of a soft and moist nature but not glutinous like the boiled rice above-
mentioned, as the birds soon soil themselves grievously with such. A
variety of sweet and juicy fruits should be supplied, and diluted honey
or liquid mixtures as recommended for humming-birds would probably
suit them well. They also eat a proportion of small grains, such as
canary seed or millet, but I would recommend caution in supplying
such, as the bulk of their natural food is liquid or semi-liquid. If
breeding is desired, a nest-box approximating in form to the natural
type as indicated above would be most likely to succeed, and a fresh-cut
branch of green leaves should be suspended in the aviary every few
days, for the female to furnish her nest from. In Britain I would suggest
leaves of the oak or elm type as probably being suitable, but experi-
mentation would be advisable. Although, in Ceylon, birds under my
care have carried out the breeding operations to the point of laying full
clutches of eggs, some unlucky accident has always intervened to
prevent full success in breeding this delightful little parrot.

THE BREEDING OF THE FAIRY BLUE WREN
</sectionHeader>
<subsectionHeader confidence="0.383507">
Malurus cyaneus

</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.996548" page_id="56317099"  page_num="84" year="" vol="">
It had long been the ambition of Mr. Edward Marshall Boehm to
breed the Fairy Blue Wren, but ill-luck seemed to dog all his efforts
from 1959 until 1961. A native of South Eastern Australia and
Tasmania, it is known by a variety of names ranging from Superb
Blue Wren, Blue Bonnet, Mormon Wren, Cocktail, etc., but is more
familiarly referred to as the Fairy Blue Wren --Malurus cyaneus.
Not one of the smallest Wrens, its 5 inches includes a tail of some
2 inches in length. It is sexable at an early age, the male possessing
a dark blue tail and dark brown bill, the remainder of the plumage
being similar to that of the adult female which is grey-brown with
lighter underparts. The bill of the female is reddish-brown and the
tail dark brown. In addition, the female has a reddish-brown V-shaped
marking running from the back of the head to above and below each
eye. During the breeding season the male acquires an enamel-blue
crown, ear-coverts, and upper back. The throat, chest, nape of neck,
and lower back are black and the tail and bill are as described above.
The lower abdomen and under tail-coverts are whitish and the flight
feathers are dark brown. For the first three or four moults the male
loses this colouring and assumes the brown phase. From then on,
however, the moult effects no change and he retains the blue through-
out the year. They have a pretty, tremulous song which, though of
a limited range of notes, is very musical as they repeat it over and
over again and it is no wonder that they are sometimes incorrectly
referred to as the Superb Warbler. The females also have a pleasing
call, even more limited, and only appear to resort to it when trying
to attract their mate's or youngsters' attention. The male, however,
appears to sing just for the joy of being alive.
They are not particularly easy to keep in captivity owing to their
main diet being insects, but Mr. Boehm managed to save three out
of a consignment of six he received early in 1959. They consisted of
two males and one female. Unfortunately, like many of the Wren
species, they are territorially minded when it comes to the breeding
season and one of the males eliminated the other. The pair then began
nest-building in December. They were housed in an indoor, heated,
and planted bird-room so this did not present any great problem.
However, success was not to be as the female was killed when the door
was blown open during a gale and, as it slammed shut, it caught her
in the jamb.
It was not until July, 1961, that Mr. Boehm was able to obtain any
replacements but at that time he managed to secure five more pairs.

One pair was placed in another indoor aviary ; one in an outdoor
one, also heated ; one pair was retained in the cage-room, and the
last pair was split, the female being placed with the original male and
the male placed in the cage-room together with the other pair.
With such new arrivals it was expected that some time would be
required for them to familiarize themselves with the feeding and to
become acclimatized. However, although this certainly appears to
apply to those in the indoor aviaries, no such thoughts were entertained
by the pair given the freedom of the outdoor enclosure. They were
actually placed in the aviary on 31st July and on 9th August the
female was observed to be building a nest in a low shrub. This was
destroyed two days later and restarted in another bush at about one foot
above ground level. Again the site was not approved for, on the 13th,
this was demolished and her attentions given to building yet a third
nest in a different position, farther from the entrance door and about
three feet up.
The completed nest was dome-shaped with the entrance hole near
to the top but protected by a form of porch. It had been made of
rootlets, fine grasses, and collie clippings, being lined with fine dog's
hair and feather down. It was very deep, the female being completely
concealed when she was sitting. The first egg was laid on 19th August,
the final clutch of three being completed by the 21st. No attempt
was made to measure the eggs but they are estimated to have been
about 10 by 7 mm. They were a pinkish-white, lightly spotted with
reddish-brown.
Over two weeks elapsed, the female sitting steadily but, finally, on
6th September, she left the nest unattended for a complete morning.
Examination revealed that all the eggs had been damaged in some
way but that they had been fertile. Another nest was made, in the
same bush but of much better construction, and the first egg of this
second round was laid on 14th September. Again there were three,
incubation appearing to begin from the laying of the first, and once
more the entire task of tending the eggs was undertaken by the
female.
On 27th September the first chick hatched and, by the evening of
the 28th, three little light pink gapes could be seen. Great care was
taken not to go too near to the nest and observation of the nestlings
was confined to a quick glance to see if there were still three little
mouths ever ready for food. The rearing, which was shared, was
effected entirely with live food and regular issues of small mealworms
and gentles were made every hour throughout the day. In addition
to this, insects were collected in nets from the surrounding grass and
tree lands and each night a blue-light insect catcher was set in
operation. This secured a wide variety of insects ranging from large
moths down to small gnats and mosquitos. First thing each morning

some of these were released into their aviary and it was amazing the
way even quite sizeable moths were taken and fed to the chicks. The
female would take them to the entrance hole, remove the wings, and
then cram the body into the nearest open mouth. The male confined
his efforts to the smaller flies and insects where no preparatory pseudo-
filleting was necessary.
On 8th October all three young left the nest and it was a picture
to see the three little bodies perched in a row between their parents,
the entire family of five not occupying more than about inches on
the branch. Needless to say, the supply of live food was stepped up,
visits being made every half an hour or so and they all progressed
well, finally attaining independence on the 23rd.
The colouring of the fledglings closely resembled that of the adult
female but was of a little lighter shade and the V-shaped markings
by the eyes was lacking. By the time they were three months old it
could be seen that there was one male and two females. It is planned
to pair them up with those at present in the cage-room but, owing
to their diminutive size but aggressive nature, it is likely to present
a small problem in the selection of aviaries since two pairs cannot be
housed in the same enclosure.
Although this species was bred as long ago as 1902 by Mr. R.
Phillipps, London, see Avicult. Mag. 1902, 246 ; 1903, 15 ; 1906, 228,
no subsequent success is known to the writer and, so far as records show,
it is a " first " in the United States.

THE BREEDING OF ALLEN'S HUMMINGBIRD
Selaphorus alleni

In the summer of 1959 we were given two young Allen's Hummers
which had fallen from a nest. They were quite easily reared on our two
formulas and fruit flies. Both proved to be males. The following year,
one killed the other after peaceful co-existence for all those months.
The remaining one became very tame and is a good show for visitors
as he will come right up to the feeding vial, even when held an inch
from my face and while surrounded with visitors.
In the fall of i960 I caught a female and, after several weeks in a
holding cage in the same aviary, I released her to live with the male.
The male had been displaying constantly but, of course, could not
make any of those fantastic U-shaped high dives, as the aviary is only
about 9 feet high, so he satisfied himself with repeated 8-foot U's.
In April, 1961, the female began building a nest. I had tied bunches
of cotton string to the limbs of the trees in this aviary and this material

she took to at once. As many cobwebs as I could find were also placed
among the branches and some logs covered with lichens were stood up.
This nest was rather flimsy and needed support after the two tiny
eggs were laid. The female sat faithfully for about a week when we
had a nasty rainstorm with high winds, which tipped the nest so the
eggs fell out.
Within four days the female started another nest which was very
much stronger and, here again, two eggs were laid and this time both
eggs hatched on 19th June, after incubation of more than twenty days.
The two young, like two small snapping beetles, did very well for about
ten days when one disappeared and, up to this time neither young
seemed to grow much and were still quite naked. After the tenth day,
the remaining young grew quickly and on 15th July was seen sitting
on the edge of the nest.
The female, during incubation, left the nest each time anyone
entered the aviary. The male did not assist in any way and had to be
moved to an adjoining aviary, as the female drove him off repeatedly
and might have killed him. On 17th July, the young one took its first
flight (which reminded me of a sick bee in flight) but quickly grew
stronger.
The female fed the young for nearly two weeks with our formulas
and small flies which she pumped into the young. Very interesting to
me was that she would very often feed the young in the same way
hummers hover over flowers, i.e. without sitting on the perch.
Soon after the young was feeding itself the female began to chase it
and keep it from feeding, so that the young was caged and is doing
very well.
I believe, given enough room and proper environment, hummers are
not difficult to raise. I have reported, some years ago, the nesting of my
Garnet-throated Hummers with two eggs, but the female was injured
before incubation term was up.
Allen's Hummer is the most common one here with us and also a
very pretty one, with the male's brilliant throat feathers.
In this aviary I have my breeding pair of Mexican Clarines, a pair
of Pygmy Nuthatches, and a Japanese White-eye. The aviary is 40 feet
by 8 feet, and 9 feet high.
Finally a word about our formulas for hummers, sunbirds, etc., may
be of interest. The morning formula consists of one part honey to
eight to ten parts water (we make about two quarts of this each
a.m.). To this we add a generous, overflowing teaspoonful of
Thompson's Multi-Vitamin Syrup and then we add four heaping
teaspoons of Soyagen Milk Powder (which is a milk substitute) and
blend for not more than 30 seconds in an electric blender. At 3 p.m.
all feeders are washed and filled with one part honey to eight to ten
parts water, plus twelve to fourteen drops of ABDEG vitamins for

two quarts. We use a little hot water with the honey at the start.
Never use beef extract, white sugar, or synthetic vitamins.
For our Fiji Lories, Paradise Birds, Chloropsis, etc., we add to
one quart of the Soyagen Formula, one raw egg and generous amounts
of Pablum and Toasted Wheat Germ and blend with the electric
blender for about 30 seconds. If left in running blender too long the
mixture tends to separate. Even our Egyptian Plover drink this
formula and all our other birds love it, except the sunbirds, which
prefer the mix without the egg.

friends. The large garden is full of trees and I look from my verandah
into their leafy shade. The floor of the great verandah in which I write
is of marble, grey and white, patterned with coloured squares and
circles of chrome and black. The extension to this verandah is open
to the sky and the floor is tessellated with gaily coloured stones in
intricate design. This is where the birds first came to meet me. The
verandah's low and enclosing panelled walls are fashioned from a lovely
red sandstone, quarried in Rajasthan. The panels are pierced and
fretted with designs of the greatest delicacy, chiselled, as I have seen,
from the solid stone. The finials of the uprights between the panels are
finished as unopened lotus buds, most delicately wrought. It is on the
top rails of these exquisitely panelled walls and on these unopened
lotus buds that the birds most love to perch. The birds which first
came to greet me were the Grey Babblers or " Sat Bhai " or Seven
Brothers, as they are called, and they do, indeed, go about in family
parties of this number.
Last year only one family came to see me but the good news must
have spread abroad that here was a life of ease and plenty compared
with the life of scarcity and toil which is their usual lot. When I was
awakened in the silence and half light of the early dawn by the loud
harsh calls, now softly muted, I found perched on the verandah rails
and lotus buds no less than one and twenty of these birds, garbed so
modestly in quaker grey. Three family parties had come to meet me.
Little did I know at the time that these humble scavengers among the
leaves would take complete possession of my abode, that this would
become their hunting ground, and that I would become their slave.
The " Sat Bhai " or Grey Babblers were common birds in the
spacious garden compounds which surrounded and secured the privacy
of the large, old-fashioned rambling bungalows. As you moved quietly

along the overgrown paths, you would hear movement and a rustling
among leaves and you would see a little company of grey birds looking
worried, fretful, and overworked, with harsh complaining voices and
untidy plumage, moving ever close to the earth, probing and searching
the dead leaves for the insects on which they live.
A little less in size than the English Song Thrush, they are of slimmer
build, with crouching stance. The plumage is a soft quaker grey,
prettily striated on back and breast, when seen closely, as I so often do.
The wings and tail are tinted with darker grey, the eyes are small with
pupil of deepest black and iris of palest yellow. The sharp bill and feet
are horn coloured, the toil worn feet are often earth stained, though now
less frequently, as their feeding ground is become a marble floor. Their
flight is weak, which often makes them a prey of hawks ; yet as events
proved, this weak flight is admirably adapted for moving from chair to
chair or from chair to table. They have no melody in their voices ;
their calls are harsh squawks and squeaks, like the creaking of many
ungreased wheels on wooden carts, but rising, when they get together
with quivering wings, with tails outspread, with breast feathers all
fluffed out, to fall on an intruder, into a loud harsh clamour. At other
times when contented, their calls are muted and softened--sometimes
with a questing, sometimes with an impatient note--but all are
variations of the same harsh sound. They seem among the meek that
have not inherited the earth, which all goes to show how on a superficial
acquaintance you can be mistaken. For now they have established
their tyranny over me, they seem to have changed entirely in tempera-
ment, in carriage and in disposition. No longer are they meek but
proud ; no longer are they self-effacing but demanding and assertive.
Their stance is bold and upright and their plumage trim and taut.
They will perch on the table and look me steadily in the eye ; they
will perch on the arm of my chair and watch me most intently ; they
will almost interrupt a conversation with a friend. Two on one chair,
three on another chair, four on a table, the room seems full of birds.
They will crowd about my feet so that I must move with care. The
verandah no longer provides sufficient scope for their activities. They
rout me out in my very bedroom. The poles of the mosquito net are
now their favourite perch.
The routine of their tyranny is now well established. I must get up
at half light of dawn, in obedience to their soft and muted calls.
Chapattis, the unlevened bread--the staple diet in India of so many--
have not yet arrived and so upon their clamorous insistence I break up
some of the precious biscuits brought for friends, now shortage of
foreign exchange makes these little delicacies so hard to get ; so firmly
is their tyranny established. And in the half light of dawn one and
twenty shadowy forms descend upon the tessellated pavement and have
the first meal of the day. At nine o'clock come chapattis and my little

tyrants know it. Broken up into small pieces they are an eagerly
accepted food and any bit too big, will be held by a bird parrotlike,
in its claws, and broken up. At one o'clock it is more chapattis and at
five o'clock it is more biscuits. Now there is no escape. Should I at five
o'clock or thereabouts be on a lower verandah, talking to my friend,
there will be an ominous squawk and first one little grey head with
little beady eyes and then another and yet another, will appear through
the interstices of the panelled walls. My summons has come and I must
go : and as I go from one staircase to another I can see the clan gathering
from all corners of the garden. All are present to meet me when
I arrive. But now I have got cunning. I have trained a servant to take
my place. My little tyrants are fed and I am relatively free but they
have their tender moments. One morning when it was very cold and
I was late, I looked out of my mosquito net to see a little flock of birds
all huddled together against the cold, forming a dark pattern on the rug
beside my bed. They had let me sleep on ; they had not awakened me.
My friends' servants do not think my conduct at all strange. They
are Hindus and deep in Hindu tradition is a reverence for all life. It is
a pious act to feed the mendicant and indeed all living things. My
mendicants are merely feathered. They say, with the phantasy of the
East, I can speak the language of the birds and can call them from the
tops of trees. This is only partly true.

HAND-REARING AND THE ABILITY TO
FIND FOOD
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.996323882352941" page_id="56317105"  page_num="90" year="" vol="">
By C. J. O. Harrison (Tooting, London, England)
I have set down these notes on what would appear to be a straight-
forward and self-evident subject because I feel that at least one aspect
of the hand-rearing of birds that will subsequently be released has been
often overlooked, and that it is a vitally important one.
My own experience of hand-rearing fledglings was confined to a
single summer, when I was teaching, and had brought to me a Mistle-
Thrush, two Blackbirds, and a House-Martin, as well as a number of
Starlings and House-Sparrows too far gone to react to human aid.
Since I was teaching Biology I incorporated the fledglings in the
curriculum, which justified their daily presence in the laboratory. The
most important of them with regard to the present topic was the
Mistle-Thrush.
This was the first bird brought to me and it was reared in isolation
from other birds. It took food from my hand and was tame enough to
be allowed its freedom in the laboratory. I was able to observe its
development towards independence. At one stage it began to take an

interest in the objects around it, and would examine them and test
them with its bill. It would pull at a red thread in a duster, and seize
a cloth and drag it round the room. It showed enormous curiosity
and investigated everything. I suspected that it might be testing their
edibility, but it found nothing edible apart from what it received from
me. At this stage in its existence it began to peck at, and eat, food that
was placed in front of it, instead of waiting for it to be put in its mouth.
Finally, when it was at a stage where it could be left in a garden aviary
during the day, I gave it to a friend who hoped to study it before
releasing it. When he had to go away for a short while he arranged
for a regular supply of food for it, but it finally died of malnutrition in
the midst of plenty.
The only obvious solution was to suppose that it could only recognise
food when it was associated with the presence of a human being,
although it did not necessarily take the food from the person himself
who merely represented " the place where food was to be found ".
I was fortunate enough to hear Maxwell Knight discussing the topic of
hand-rearing birds and some of the instances which he quoted appeared
to bear this out. Subsequently I gave the matter some thought and the
following hypothesis occurred to me.
It seems possible that there may be a definite and limited period during a
young bird's life when it learns to recognize the appearance and location
of the food which is to be its staple diet. If at this time it does not find
anything edible except from the hands of a human being, then it will
be unable to recognize and find its natural food if suddenly released.
It is obvious that some learning of new foods occurs in the adult stage
in birds, but it is possible that this is a slow process and that if food-
finding has not been learned at the proper period then this later process
will not be rapid enough to permit the bird to survive in a wild state.
It seems possible that the food-finding period in the fledglings
development might be comparable to the stage we find in most animals,
including ourselves, where the sounds necessary for communication are
suddenly learned with incredible ease. This period seems to occur in
small children somewhere about the age of four, and the ease with
which a child so young can effortlessly acquire the language spoken
by the adults around it, and equally effortlessly forget the language it
may have known a week or so previously, is quite fantastic. Later in
life new languages are only acquired by a slow and painful learning
process. It seems possible that birds may have a similar period in the
development of the young during which they very rapidly learn to
recognize and find their natural food, and that they subsequently rely
on this knowledge in order to survive.
I have discussed this idea with friends who have hand-reared young
birds and there appears to be further evidence to back it up. Food is
not lacking, but the human being, with whom the idea of food has

become associated, is absent, and so the bird starves. I have not been
able to conduct a proper search through scientific literature to look for
support for this hypothesis. There may well be additional data for or
against it, and it is even possible that the idea has already been put
forward, but, if so, it appears to have been overlooked and I think
it is worth repeating.
This suggestion would not necessarily be true for all species. It will
obviously differ between birds which are fed by their parents and those,
such as game-birds, which feed themselves from the start. The problem
may never arise with the latter. The learning of food-finding will differ
according to the manner in which food is obtained. It is only recently,
after a long tale of mortality, that it has been pointed out that young
owls are dependent on their parents for food for a long period, far
longer than anyone familiar only with passerines would expect.
Tinbergen describes how young Hobbies are partially dependent on
their parents for food right up to the time when they migrate. Any
person who proposes to rear and release such birds must be prepared to
allow the young bird months of practice in food-finding before leaving
it to find its own food.
The natural setting may be as important as the food itself. The
inability to recognize where to look for food probably brings about the
death of many foreign birds which escape in this country. I have had
a dead Shama brought to me which appeared to have died of hunger
in an area which supported a number of Blackbirds and Thrushes
which did not attack it, and where, had it been accustomed to searching
for food as did these species, it should have had at least as good a
chance of survival.
To sum up--if a bird is reared by hand and then released it is necess-
ary to ensure that, during the period when the young bird is exploring
its environment, it is able to discover for itself its natural food in a natural
setting , and if this is not done then there is every reason to suppose that
the bird is merely being released to die of hunger elsewhere.
People may protest that this is not possible in every case, to which
I would reply that in such cases the bird should never be released.
I am aware that most people obtain a deep emotional satisfaction
when releasing a bird from captive conditions, but I feel that they
should realize that this act of self-gratification does not necessarily do
any good to the bird. To begin with one has, for a time, removed the
bird from the natural population. The ecological balance of nature
does not normally permit the leaving of a space to be filled at a later
date. The natural increase of a species each year will tend to fill all
the available spaces and the surplus will die in order to assist the survival
of other predatory species. We now have on our hands a bird which is sur-
plus to the natural requirement and which will either die or oust another
individual to die instead, and the odds are on the former occurrence.

If we hand-rear a fledgling we do so for the sake of what we can
learn from it, or for emotional gratification, or because we believe that
it is incumbent upon us to save a life where we can rather than to kill
or allow to die. These are all good and satisfactory reasons, but we
must remember that our efforts have no bearing whatever on the
survival of the species. To this depressing fact I would now add the
possibility that by hand-rearing a bird we have deprived it of the means
of acquiring the necessary ability to find food in order to survive.
In the light of the above I consider that the present legal situation,
whereby it is necessary to release hand-reared birds when they become
adult, is indefensible. The Nature Conservancy, in issuing permits for
the hand-rearing of fledglings for scientific study, also stipulates that
such birds must be released. I would suggest that in both cases the
birds are probably being released to die out of sight, as a sop to public
sentiment. (I would define sentiment as an emotional attitude which
is not accompanied by either knowledge or intelligent reasoning.
Logical readers may suggest that, by concerning myself with the well-
being of a minute portion of the total bird population, I am displaying
sentiment myself, to which I can only reply that we are all, to some
extent, tarred with the same brush, but are not all conscious of our
emotional attitudes.)
If we cannot be sure that a bird has been reared in such a way that it
can not only recognize its food, but also the type of place in which that
food may be found, and that it is also able to find for itself a typical
roost site and such necessities as water, then, if we cannot keep it, it is
as kind to end its life as to release it.

I used to think that wild pigeons and doves, never before kept in
confinement, and wholly accustomed to feeding on natural, " native "
seeds, would be quite slow in adapting their tastes to so-called artificial
foods given them in captivity. Such, however, has not been my
experience, which now extends over twenty-odd years. Thus, some
Green-spotted Wood Doves, which came to me direct from Ghana,
where they had but recently been caught in the jungle, took readily
to diced Longhorn cheese and also to hard-boiled egg-yolk, as well
as to shelled sunflower seeds. And while it may be true that in the
wild state these doves had perhaps opportunity to taste egg-yolk,

<bodyText confidence="0.988666733333333" page_id="56317109"  page_num="94" year="" vol="">
though it seems unlikely, they most assuredly could not obtain there
either cheese or shelled sunflower seed. And they fed on these to them
new items, not because they were especially hungry, for they had a
mixture of other seeds available, but presumably because they preferred
them to the usual seeds. When it comes to egg-yolk, I am almost
tempted to say that all doves, softbills, and finches which I have kept
seem " instinctively " to relish it : they feed on it even though they
may never before have been given hard-boiled egg-yolk. Certainly,
the promptitude with which my wild doves and pigeons " take to "
egg-yolk, cheese, and other foods they have not had before, suggests
ready adaptation of the sense of taste to such to them new items.
Which is quite interesting, particularly when one keeps in mind that
members of the pigeon and dove family are not, according to reliable
authority, blessed with so-called intelligence to any marked degree.
But apparently they have a well-developed sense of taste and capacity
to adapt it to new situations, both of which may in times of stress be
instrumental in saving the species from starvation, if not extinction.
Another, and perhaps even more intriguing, observation concerns
the polygamous tendencies , not necessarily established habits, in some
species of wild doves and pigeons which I have been so fortunate as
to keep for some time. These tendencies appeared plainly in the case
of Pheasant-tailed Cuckoo Doves and, more recently, in the case of
the Splendid Pigeons, both species of fairly recent importation ; hence
suggesting that such tendencies prevail also in the wild state. One male
and two females of each species kept in a separate pen would readily
mate and, using the same nest, would lay their eggs in it--some fertile
and others infertile--but with only one bird brooding at any one time.
Always only two squabs hatched, which then were reared to maturity
without difficulty, but whether by all three birds, or only by two,
I am unable to say. And while among domesticated pigeons, this
polygamous state of affairs would have induced vicious fighting among
the hens, in the above-mentioned instances all was peace and quiet !
And again, while among domestic pigeons, youngsters, once they have
reached maturity and self-dependence, are not tolerated in or near the
old nest, the territory being steadfastly guarded especially by the old
male, among certain species of wild doves and pigeons, the parent
birds show no animosity towards their offspring, even when the latter
are full-grown, though not as yet exhibiting signs of sexual tendencies.
Only when actually beginning to coo and to display are the young
being aggressively treated by their parents. If the young of Pheasant-
tailed Cuckoo Doves and of Splendid Pigeons are accorded similar
protective treatment by their parents in the wild state, it would seem
that such rather long association of young with old would be of definite
aid to the former in better " learning " and imitating the habits of
their elders, habits tending to self-protection and survival.

A third observation concerns the distance in the aviary at which
my wild doves and pigeons, as well as my other birds, tolerate my
presence without taking the least offence, that is, without becoming
at all frightened. This distance is the same in the ten pens in which
I keep my birds. It simply extends to the feeding and watering dishes
in the immediate front of each pen, and not a step beyond. In fact,
the moment I step beyond this quite definite " line " the birds take
alarm, especially when I approach the more distant nesting locations
in the interior of each pen. So, of course, I respect my birds' rights,
and refrain, as much as possible, from disturbing them, having learned
years ago that the more they are left to their own devices, and to their
own territory , the more at ease and at peace they will be.
If I enter my doves' abode, not wearing the customary old grey
sweater, they take alarm immediately, sounding their short, pene-
trating notes of warning, which occupants in adjoining pens under-
stand readily. Moreover, they assume at once flight postures, readying
themselves for immediate escape from danger. And those doves which
happen to be incubating or brooding, duck their heads deep into the
nests as if to hide from the " enemy ". I doubt that wild doves are
conscious of the exact colour of their keeper's clothing, but they do
notice any colour different from that which he usually wears when
entering their aviaries. They take notice of anything new or strange
in their immediate surroundings, but they are very slow and reluctant
to examine such differences in their environment, and to that extent
they certainly lack the sense of curiosity, which some of my other
birds, softbills, exhibit in large measure.

Rifle-birds, of which there are seven main species, are classified
in the sub-family Parotiinae of the Paradiseidae--Birds of Paradise
group. There are some seventy different species in the main family
which all originate from Australasia but only four of these have their
habitat on the Australian mainland itself, the remainder being spread
through the islands to the north, principally New Guinea. Of the four
to be found in Australia, three are known as Rifle-birds, the fourth
being the Manucode, also called the Australian Bird of Paradise or
the Trumpeter, this species being in the sub-family Manucodiinae.
There seems to be some doubt as to how the name Rifle-bird was
originally arrived at and the most favoured theory appears to be the
similarity between the colouring of the adult males to that of the

uniforms of the old English Rifle Regiments. One thing is certain
and that is that it was not from any aboriginal word as so often occurs
with the Australian fauna.
The species being dealt with here is the Paradise Rifle-bird--
Ptiloris paradiseus --of which there are three specimens in the collection
at the Edward Marshall Boehm Aviaries. These were originally received
by myself in England, direct from Australia, in September, 1959.
There were two pairs sent but, unfortunately, one female was dead on
arrival. Due to their being in immature plumage, sexing them was a
matter of conjecture and was based on the behaviour of each individual
bird together with the fact that the base of the bill of one of them was
paler than that of the other two survivors. The three birds were
transferred out to here just prior to my wife's and my departure for
the States.
It has been stated in authoritative writings that the males do not
assume their full adult plumage under four years of age. Not knowing
exactly how old they were when received, this statement is accepted
and I can add that, after having had two complete moults, there is
still no difference in their colouring from their original receipt. Not
having had the privilege of seeing an adult male in full attire, to
describe this bird I can only precis from descriptive literature I have
read. The main colouration is a velvety black, with a slight brown
tinge except for the back of the head and the wing feathers which
have a purplish tinge. The crown, throat, and central pair of tail
feathers are a metallic blue-green as are the feathers which extend
from the lower abdomen which give almost a trouser-like effect when
the bird is in repose. The eye is dark brown and the bill and legs are
black, the latter being very powerful, reminiscent of the Jay family.
At the base of the upper mandible there is a tuft of black feathers,
entirely lacking in the immature bird, which tends to make the bill
seem shorter than that of the female. They are about 11J inches in
total length, the bill being nearly 2 inches long and the tail some
4 inches. The general body build is cobby, thrush-like, which makes
the overall bird appear to be larger than it actually is. The female
I am able to describe from the one we have here is slightly smaller,
the difference being hardly noticeable but no doubt this will be more
obvious once the males are in colour. The bill is blackish-brown and,
as stated earlier, is paler at the base of the upper portion. The general
colour is made up of various shades of brown which may be divided
up in the following manner. The crown and cheeks are dark brown
with whitish fleckings and there is a pale fawn stripe running from
the base of the bill, over the eye, to the back of the head. The mantle
is a lighter brown with a greyish tinge but the white fleckings cease
at the base of the neck. The upper tail-coverts also are brown with
the main tail feathers being a reddish brown, similar to the flight

feathers. The chin is a pale fawn which colour extends through the
entire underparts except that, from the upper chest downwards, it is
lined with V-shaped brown markings, light and small at first and
gradually darkening and thickening as they spread down the body.
The under wing and tail-coverts are a reddish brown, the legs and
eyes being the same as with the male. In the immature birds the
V-shaped markings on the underparts appear to be more clearly
defined on the female bird and the fawn background is paler and the
flight feathers a little shorter than that of the immature male.
As previously mentioned, the three birds here are in their young
plumage but the original sexing seems to have been borne out by the
fact that two of the birds had a phase of persistent displaying. This
was always done when they were standing on the very top of a post
or tree stump and varied in duration from a few minutes at a time
to periods up to as long as 30 minutes. It is a most fantastic sight
and, since mere words could not do it justice, a series of photographs
was made and I have attempted to place twelve of these in the usual
sequence of movement. Starting from the introductory bow as in
Plate 1, they work up to a strident call of " Ya-a-as, ya-a-as " which
is emitted in the manner shown in Plates 9 and 10. All the gyrations
are distinct, jerky movements, yet in their completion have a rhythmic
tone. After the call, which may be repeated eight or nine times, there
comes the final deferential bow to the female as she approaches and
is embraced within the outstretched wings as illustrated in Plate 12.
At the present time all three birds are housed in one enclosure
but, since in the wild the males are normally to be found each in its
own territory, careful watch is being maintained so as to divide them
up at the first signs of belligerence. Although their normal breeding
time is from October to January, the birds here ceased displaying
early in August and it is hoped that this is an indication that they
are becoming fully acclimatized and that a breeding may be
accomplished sometime in the future. Time alone will show whether
they go to nest whilst still in immature plumage or waitXintil in full
colour. If the latter is the case it may be a further two seasons before
any steps are taken in, from our point of view, the right direction.
They are very insectivorous and, in addition to a liberal supply of
mealworms, their diet consists of minced beef heart, egg-mix, blue-
berries, and small grapes which they supplement with the numerous
grubs and insects they probe out from every nook and cranny in the
framework of their aviary and the trees and shrubs that are in there.
They do not confine their attentions to creeping insects for they are
equally adept at catching flies in mid-air and short shift is accorded
to any flying creature that ventures to transverse the interior of their
enclosure.

By Joseph M. Forshaw (Canberra, Australia)
The flashing brilliance of a flock of small Red-browed Lorilets
(Opopsitta leadbeateri) as they wing their way through the jungle of
Northern Queensland, or the magnificent lordly colours of the giant
Red-tailed Black Cockatoos ( Calyptorhynchus banksii) as they perch on a
dead gum tree on the bank of a dry creek in the arid desert-lands of
Central Australia, are just a couple of the rewarding sights that greet
a bird lover as he sets out to view the Australian members of the order
Psittacidae. Of all the wonderful bird-life of " Down Under Land "
the parrots are the most interesting, the most fascinating, and the most
colourful. Many of them are well known to people in England through
the highly successful efforts of the aviculturists in that country. As I am
not familiar with the situation in other countries, I would be most
happy to hear from people in other parts of the world who are keeping
Australian parrots.
When you observe an Eastern Rosella ( Platycercus eximius) in your
aviary or in a neighbour's birdroom does it ever pass through your
mind ; "I wonder what a flock of these birds would look like in their
natural wild state " ? On the other hand do you ever think what those
parrots such as the Ground Parrot ( Pezoporus wallicus) or the Palm
Cockatoo ( Probosciger aterrimus) that may be little more than names to
you really look like in their natural homes ? In a humble way, and
with many shortcomings I admit, I hope to give you an answer to
these and other questions about the Australian parrots in their natural
habitats.
In past years aviculturists and field ornithologists have not always
been on the best of friendly terms. The ornithologists have been
charged with " getting lost in unnecessary long latin names " and the
aviculturists have been charged " with reporting behaviour that could
not have possibly happened because the species does not behave like
that ", and also with breeding a new strain or hybrid and giving it a
new and different name. In recent times this petty bickering and
squabbling has largely disappeared and each has come to realize that
he can learn a great deal from the other. The aviculturist has become
interested in birds as a collective subject and wants to learn more about
his favourite species and the other groups, while the ornithologist wants
to learn more about the captivity adaptations of his favourite species.
With this now existing arrangement in mind--I would like to put
forward a trade of knowledge between Commonwealth countries.
I will try to give you some insight into the natural lives of our parrots
by presenting to you my observations and field notes on the various
species if you will in return pass on to me your observations on your
birds in their adopted country. I would be most happy to hear from

not agree with or does not comprehend anything at all in any of my
articles, I would like him to write to me and I will return the compli-

species of parrots in aviaries I have specialized of late in field work
and I do not profess to have much knowledge of the former, so if any
person at any time thinks I am " talking through my hat " please do
not hesitate to tell me.
Unfortunately, owing to the widespread distribution, with generic
boundaries, of the parrots, I cannot present these articles in a truly

with it in the field. I do believe, however, that you will find the
articles interesting and pleasing to read.

<bodyText confidence="0.994209206896552" page_id="56317120"  page_num="99" year="" vol="">
First described by Dr. John Latham in 1781 from a perfect specimen,
which was in the possession of Sir Joseph Banks, the Crimson Rosella
was for many years called Psittacus pennanti, a name which is incor-
porated in the present popular synonym of Pennant's Parrakeet.
Probably one of Australia's most beautiful birds, the Mountain Lory, as
it is commonly called, proudly boasts a rich crimson plumage rivalled
only by that of the female Eclectus Parrot (Lorius pectoralis ), relieved
by a perfect blending of blue on the shoulders, wing primaries, tail
and ear-coverts. A memorable sight is provided by the bold contrast
obtained when the bird is sighted midst prevailing green foliage.
A perfect example of Nature's protection by camouflage is found in the
plumage of immature birds. Young birds on emerging from the nest
are green in general plumage with blue ear-coverts and shoulders while
some have varying amounts of red on the underparts. Apparently
realizing their advantage over their conspicuous elders, young birds
tend to be less wary than the adults. Two immature male birds
collected by the author in the Snowy Mountains district of New South
Wales in 1961 were most striking in colour, being entirely green except
for blue ear-coverts and shoulders and a perfectly round crimson patch
on the crown of their heads. The young bird generally obtains patchy
red underparts after six months followed by the gradual appearance of
the black markings on the back. Finally, with an almost complete
moult in its second year the bird takes on the adult plumage. In parts
of the extensive range of this species this general rule suffers some slight
modifications. In parts of New South Wales and Queensland it has
been reported that some young birds leave the nest with a dull version
of the adult plumage, while in some parts of Victoria and New South
Wales the adult plumage is obtained after a complete moult late in the
first year.

Distribution of the Crimson Rosella ( P. elegans.)
Found along the east coast of Australia from Cape York through New
South Wales to Victoria and eastern South Australia, and on Kangaroo
Island, this beautiful bird enjoys a wide range. It has also been
introduced to Norfolk Island. The author found scattered pairs in the
vicinity of Mount Gambier, South Australia, in i960, but failed to
locate any birds in the Adelaide region and the reports of typical
Platycercus elegans elegans in this area are probably brought about by
escapees from aviaries. The Adelaide Rosella (. Platycercus elegans
adelaidae ) is the representative of the species in this area. Geographical
variations are found in different sections of the bird's range and although
five subspecies have been listed only three subspecies and one variation
to one of these are recognized, the others being dismissed as invalid.
The birds from the extreme limits of the range, namely P.e. melanoptera

from Kangaroo Island and P.e. nigrescens from northern Queensland,
show brighter colouring with darkest markings and are generally
considered to be the best developed of the subspecies.
Ramsay, in his Tabular List of Australian Birds , published in 1888,
describes Platycercus elegans nigrescens from a specimen taken at Bellenden
Ker Range, in North Queensland. Giving its range as North
Queensland, he reported it as being smaller in size and darker in
colour. In 1961 the author obtained eighteen birds belonging to this
variety and compared them with the typical elegans. Unfortunately
many were of green immature plumage, but the smaller size was
definitely evident. The colour of the few mature birds in the group
was noted to be more reddish than crimson, while the black back
markings were somewhat more pronounced. Another interesting
difference noted was that the sheen and fine silky texture of the typical
elegans was lacking in nigrescens.
On the 7th August, 1906, a meeting of the South Australian
Ornithological Association was held at the Adelaide Museum. The
purpose of this meeting was to establish the affinity, or otherwise, of
certain Kangaroo Island birds with their mainland relatives. Mr. A. J.
North, of the Sydney Museum, presented various papers at the
meeting, one of which dealt with the form of P. elegans found on the
Island. The Kangaroo Island form was found to be of a brick-red
colour rather than crimson, and its back was more strongly marked
with black. Mr. North submitted Platycercus elegans melanoptera as the
name for this new form, and, although it was considered favourably
by the members present, more study of specimens was thought to be
necessary before a final decision could be reached. Much discussion
has since centred around the authenticity of Mr. North's claim but
subsequent observations and research were sufficient to induce Mathews
to give the subspecies recognition in his Systerna Avium Australasiarum
published in 1927. Although the colour difference noted at the meeting
is generally doubted the subspecies is widely accepted. Unfortunately
the author could not obtain any specimens from Kangaroo Island and
has had to content himself with Museum skins as a means of ascer-
taining the truth of Mr. North's claims. These skins are inadequate as a
basis for putting forward a definite rule but acceptance of the subspecies
is advocated.
Platycercus elegans victoriae was tabulated by Mathews in 1912 from a
specimen collected at Woori Yallock in Victoria. It was reported to
differ from P.e. elegans in having a deeper but duller red, especially
noticeable on the rump and underparts, while the black markings on
the back were more extensive. The range was reported as the south-
eastern portion of Victoria. This subspecies has been dismissed as
invalid as it differs in no way whatever from P.e. elegans.

Fleurieu Peninsula in South Australia, tabulated a darker form of
P. elegans adelaidae and called it P. elegans fleurieuensis. These brighter
birds occur amongst paler coloured birds and this subspecies has been
dismissed as invalid.
The classification of the Adelaide Rosella is a complex and difficult
procedure with two schools of opinion being predominant. Some
ornithologists maintain this bird as a separate species (P. adelaidae)
while others regard it as a form of P. elegans. Arguments favouring
both opinions are readily producible and although the majority seem
to favour the acceptance of the new species, the author cannot fully
justify this action. Dissection of typical Adelaide and Crimson Rosellas
gives no difference in measurements to separate the species while some
birds show close similarities in plumage. It has been noted that there
is a gap of about ioo miles between the habitats of P. elegans elegans
and P.e. adelaidae (in South Australia). However, many such breaks
occur in the distribution of other species and the Superb Parrot
(Polytelis swainsoni) which will be discussed in a later article, is one
example of this. While the author will not put forward any definite
conclusion on this matter any observations made by aviculturists who
have kept these birds and in particular any records of their inter-
breeding would be most welcome. P.e. adelaidae , which was tabulated
by Gould in 1841, has a darkish green back with the characteristic
black markings and yellow underparts heavily marked with red which
extends above the blue ear-coverts to the head. The young birds pass
through the green colouration stages in much the same way as a
typical P.e. elegans. Named after the city of Adelaide this Rosella is
found in the Mount Lofty and Flinders Ranges where the author
observed it in i960.
Platycercus elegans subadelaidae was first examined by Mathews using
a specimen collected from Mt. Remarkable District in the Flinders
Range in 1912. This bird differs from P.e. adelaidae in its paler general
plumage while the males lack red colour on the rump. When P.e.
adelaidae is regarded as a separate species this form is regarded as a
subspecies of it.
With its beauty recognized by the earliest naturalists the Mountain
Lowry (a name which should be discouraged) has always enjoyed
praiseworthy names before the acceptance of P. elegans. Latham,
nine years after he had first described it, in 1790, submitted the name of
Psittacus pennanti which was followed the next year by Psittacus gloriosus
submitted by Shaw and Nodder. Shaw, the following year, submitted
yet another title in Psittacus splendidus. However, the law of precedence
prevailed and with the alteration of Psittacus the name given by Gmelin
in 1788 came to be accepted and elegans became the specific title.
Most types of country in the bird's range are frequented by this
foremost member of the Rosellas. It is usually found in pairs or small

flocks in open forest, timbered country bordering creeks and water-
courses, heavily timbered mountain gorges and fern gulleys, and
cultivated farmlands. The young birds from the last brood often
remain with their parents throughout the winter months and they
constitute the family parties frequently observed. The general rule is,
however, for the immature birds to flock together while the coloured
birds remain in pairs or very small groups. Although frequently
found feeding in the company of its close relative the Eastern Rosella
(P. eximius) the two birds do not often interbreed. When they do
hybridize the offspring are called Red-mantled Parrakeets (. Platycercus
erythropterus ) by aviculturists but the English name should be restricted
to them as the scientific title is, to say the least, misleading and incorrect.
The author has observed that when a mixed flock is disturbed both
species immediately congregate separately in flight and take cover
independently, often in opposite directions.
Usually flushed from the ground or found among the outermost
branches of a flowering gum tree, this parrot spends most of its time in
search of food. Seeds of grasses and herbaceous plants, berries, blossoms,
young gum tips and fruit are the main constituents of its diet. While
climbing through the blossom or berry laden outermost branches of a
tree or bush it keeps up a constant chatter which seems to be an
expression of contentment. In the " between meal hours " of the day it
will often sit and practise in the warbling of its limited range of notes
which, judging from the pride shown, is considered by the owner to be
every bit as good as the Nightingale, but in the opinion of the onlooker
a lot of improvement is necessary. Favourite foods in the southern
districts are the berries of Pyracantha, a type related to the Hawthorn,
and the nuts of the Cypress Pine ( Callitris endlicheriana) , a considerable
noise being created in the cracking of the latter. Besides the chattering
call already mentioned the bird has a shrill screech and a pleasant
whistle not unlike that of P. eximius but readily recognized by its deeper
pitch and more resonant quality.
An interesting feature, concerning the distribution of P. elgans, is the
fact that in parts of its range it is found at very high altitudes. In i960
when the author was a member of a skiing party at Mount Kosciusko
at 6,000 feet, an expression of admiration was given by several of his
companions at the sight of a beautifully coloured cock bird, which had
just alighted on a snow-covered tree stump. The sight, admittedly,
was one of Nature's gems, a splash of the brightest crimson in a white
world. A girl from England on meeting a flock of " Crimsons ", while
being shown over an Australian sheep station by the author in 1961,
remarked that she had never realized such beautiful birds existed.
These examples are given so as to impress the esteem in which this bird
is held, and the reason for its being so.
The sexes are alike in plumage but may be readily differentiated

when compared in the presence of each other. The cock bird is larger
and more heavily built than his mate. A hen bird collected in
September, 1961, in Southern New South Wales gave the following
measurements :--
in.
Overall length . . . . . .13
Tail . . . . . . . . 7-3
Wing from shoulder to tip (Extended) . . 9-7
A cock bird collected in the same area a few months previously gave
the following comparative measurements :--
Overall length . . . . . . 13-4
Tail . . . . . . . . 7-4
Wing from shoulder to tip (Extended) . . 9 -85
The head provides the most reliable means of identification with
that of the cock bird being larger and with a squarish appearance, while
the upper mandible is broad and short, as compared with the small
sleek head and narrow bill of the hen.
Some ornithologists and aviculturists prefer to be guided by the
white lines under the wings of the hen birds. Whereas, it is true, the
general tendency is for the hen bird to show one or two white lines
under her wing as compared with two white spots in that position with
her mate, the author has on several occasions come into contact with
definite hens that did not possess the white lines. A hen bird, that
successfully reared two batches of young in his aviaries, was one of
these exceptions. This tendency, which seems to be characteristic of
the members of the Platycercus, Barnardius, and Purpureicephalus genera,
although a very useful method of sexing in the last two mentioned,
should be superseded by the previously mentioned means in the case of
the Rosellas. Similarly the means of identification using the green spot
on the nape of a hen bird is not to be taken as gospel truth as many hen
birds will not show this. Very little faith should be placed in the
common belief that only the cock bird possesses a voice as this is quite
often found to be far from true.
The mating display of P. elegans is typical of the members of the
genus but seems to vary with individual birds with some slight emphasis
placed on different steps in the procedure. In detailing the following
mating display the author by no means puts it forward as standard
and would appreciate any observations or discussions on the matter.
The male bird lowers his wings in the folded position, chatters inces-
santly, and moves his fanned tail from side to side in a quick, agitated
manner. The head he tilts back and holds high, or holds slightly bowed,
with breast feathers puffed out. The female after an early indifference
usually succumbs to this display of vanity and accepts his proposal. On
selecting a suitable nesting site, he feeds his mate regurgitated food and
a few days later she goes to nest.

The nesting site chosen by the birds is generally a hole in the trunk of
a tree or a hollow limb, the bottom of which is lined with decayed
wood. A living tree is usually preferred and, depending on the
locality, the Eucalyptus piperita is a firm favourite. The hollow may be
only a few feet from the ground or it may be at an almost inaccessible
height. The eggs are deposited on the decayed wood just inside the
entrance or, if the entrance is at a considerable height, the passage to
them is often a long one. The entrance itself may be enlarged by the
birds tearing away the sides with their bills. A nest will be used by a
pair of birds for several seasons depending on the success of its safety
from predators, both natural and human. Five to eight, usually five,
eggs with a close-grained, smooth, lustrous surface and an oval shape,
are laid. The breeding season is from October to January or February
in the eastern states, with slight variations as you move west. Crimson
Rosellas tend to be double brooded in captivity and in the natural
state, if the conditions are ideal.
In captivity, although a beautiful asset to one's aviaries, it cannot be
trusted with other members of the genus or in a mixed collection
containing birds smaller than itself. It will breed freely in captivity and
the author has bred it on numerous occasions, and, contrary to some
beliefs, they are capable of breeding before attaining adult plumage.
A hollow log or nest-box is used in captivity, while there are many
instances of nesting operations being carried out in tins, kettles, and in
tunnels made in the floor of aviaries. The hen bird seems to have a
quieter disposition and takes more kindly to aviary life than does her
proud mate. Three nestlings rescued, when the tree containing their
home was felled, and given to the author were such wonderful pets and
their exploits, which were so mischievous, became notorious. The two
hen birds became very tame and affectionate while the cock bird always
remained aloof and wary.
When nesting in captivity they become very pugnacious and the cock
bird even exercises his domination over his mate rather savagely at
times. The hen bird leaves the nest for a short period in the warmest
part of the day and is promptly sent back by her mate when she has
completed eating and drinking. The cock bird of a nesting pair in wild
life sits in a suitable position of observation and screeches a warning to
his sitting mate at the approach of danger.
The most suitable diet for aviary birds appears to be a mixture of
sunflower seeds, oats, plain canary seed, and millet in the proportions
of 2 : 1 : 2 : 1. A plentiful supply of green food in the form of chick-
weed, milk thistle, lettuce, and a little silver beet is absolutely essential.
A little fruit, especially apple, is relished by these birds ; a factor by no
means in their favour in the eyes of orchardists. A bath is always
enjoyed but, unless a draught-free, sunlight-filled, enclosure is available
to facilitate drying, this should be discouraged in cold weather.

THE SEASONAL DEVELOPMENT AND CHANGES
IN PLUMAGE OF THE WHYDAHS VIDUA AND
THE WEAVERS EUPLECTES
By Ian Woodward (Hemel Hempstead, Hertfordshire)
Introduction
That many birds assume two very distinct liveries in the course of

the year, while others, as the spring approaches, become perceptibly
brighter in hue, is a matter of common knowledge. But the means by
which their changes are affected are by no means so well known,
least of all the two groups under discussion.
A few words about the normal procedure of moult will be of use
for comparative analysis purposes. The House Sparrow, Passer
domesticus , displays seasonal changes of plumage to which special
attention should be directed. In the spring the male develops a
conspicuous black throat and is generally much more vividly coloured
than during the autumn and winter months. This change is due to
an interesting cause. If a bird be examined directly after the autumn
moult the feathers of the throat will be found to be black throughout
their length, save at the tips, which are greyish-white ; while, similarly,
the feathers of the head, and upper-parts generally, have a tawny
fringe. As the winter progresses these fringes wear away, so that by
the spring the more strongly coloured portions of the feathers are
fully exposed. The red breast of the Linnet, Carduelis cannabina , is
gained in an exactly similar manner.

The common Starling, Sturnus vulgaris , again affords another
valuable illustration. Both sexes of this bird are coloured alike, and
possess distinct summer and winter plumages. These, as in the case
of the House Sparrow, are gained, not by a change of raiment, but
by the wearing away of the tips of the feathers. After the autumn
moult, those of the upper-surface are tipped with golden-brown and
those of the under-parts with white, giving the birds the familiar
speckled appearance. During the winter months, however, these tips
are gradually worn off, so that in the spring and summer months a
spotless, glossy, black plumage, with steel-reflections, replaces the
earlier spotted dress.
By way of contrast it should be pointed out that in many other birds,
which similarly display a more brightly coloured livery in the spring
than that worn during the winter months, this brighter garb is
assumed, not by the wearing away of the tips of the feathers, but by a
complete moult.

Discussion

<bodyText confidence="0.994708730769231" page_id="56317128"  page_num="107" year="" vol="">
In most cases, the mere mention of moult in connection with the
Whydahs and Weavers brings to mind a phenomenon of mystery, and
it is hoped, in some small way, to clarify certain aspects of the subject
in this review. Most aviculturists will have no doubt noticed that
these two quite different groups, on account of their superficial
resemblance to one another, are usually grouped together in avicul-
tural and systematic works. But if examples of each group were to be
examined in the hand, it would be seen that these apparent similarities
are only common in the change and in the partially black plumage,
and in the characteristics and length of the tails. All other outer
features, such as the design and length of the tail when in eclipse
plumage, and the rather short mandibles, together with other
particular habits, vary and differ remarkably.
Contributions from J. Chapin ( Classification of the Weaver Birds) and
Prof. P. Sushkin ( Anatomy and Classification of the Weaver Birds , 1927)
have suggested fairly conclusively that both sexes of these Weavers
and Whydahs undergo a post-nuptial moult, and that the adult males
also go through a pre-nuptial moult when they come into breeding
dress. In addition, I have observed with captive examples of both
groups that very often first-year males which, for some reason have
not gone through into colour, will not moult at this pre-nuptial stage.
As to how the plumage-change is undertaken is another question,
and one which has stirred the minds of ornithologists for years.
What is more, there does not appear to be any general agreement as
to the biological factors governing the change. A few years back
J. Delacour and F. Edmond-Blanc carried out fairly extensive

<bodyText confidence="0.999624244444445" page_id="56317129"  page_num="108" year="" vol="">
researches into this phenomenon and presented some interesting
theories. One opinion is that directly the feather growth has ceased,
it no longer remains connected with the bird's circulatory system, thus
closing the arteries of communication. The assumption now taken is
that because the individual feather is at this stage " mature ", there
can no longer exist a colour-influence from the bird's body. Also,
because of this state of affairs, any subsequent plumage-changes can
only be attributed to general wear and tear (or " feather-wear "), in
addition to the influence of environment agents or chemical reactions.
To the inquiring aviculturist this theory is open to wide speculation.
For example, it has been long established that certain colours of the
plumage have a pigmentation make-up that persists only during the
period of the bird's life. In order to clarify this last remark, I should
state that what is meant by this is that the colours only remain during
ideal conditions ; should the environment become abnormal, such as
excessive drought or over-crowding of captive enclosures, both factors
of which would effect a diet different from normal conditions, then
the state of affairs would be quite different. Therefore, it would
appear that an influence on these pigments via the bird's body may
be as a result of the intermediary agency of the highly coloured fat
properties which impregnate the zones of insertion of the feathers ;
this may even continue for a period after the bird's death.
Research has shown that Weavers with red and orange in the
plumage have all their internal organs impregnated with identical
pigments, the liver in this case having a superabundance.
Another theory which has been put forward suggests that the
pigmentation-compound of red, yellow, and black is such that it is
reabsorbed into the common out-of-season fawn colour--without
moulting. But although this seems doubtful, most aviculturists will
have to agree that during the change of plumage very few of the
summer-dress feathers are found in their enclosures. It is agreed that
all captive and wild birds need a certain amount of roughage, and
that birds such as birds of prey obtain this by swallowing their
victims' fur and ejecting it in the form of pellets. It is ridiculous
to suggest that Vidua and Euplectes do this.
Observations made by research biologists in recent years of birds
in both captivity and in their own element, seem generally to conclude
that the change from the eclipse to the nuptial dress is coincident,
either with a partial moult or else with none at all. From the light of
recent research it would also appear that the operation of this change
is dependent on the conditions to which the bird is subjected, and that
by changing these conditions it is possible to retard, stop, or even
reverse the change.
Certainly, examination of recently acquired dead birds confirms
that, although in some cases the feathers of the neck and the back

change normally, other examples in the process of changing appear to
do so from the sombre fawn and brown colours to the black, red, and
yellow without moulting.
In spite of all our present knowledge, we cannot say with certainty
how the phenomenon works in practice. Furthermore, we cannot
entirely reject the possibility that the plumage change of colour occurs
after their mature development, no matter how strange the idea may
at first appear. This subject is certainly wide open for further research.

By A. W. E. Fletcher
Since the Society is paying its annual visit to Chester Zoo in June,
it was decided in this first of a series of articles to describe some of the
birds in the collection which may be of special interest to members.
The main Bird House is tenanted by a mixed collection of the
parrot family, pigeons and various softbills, and tropical birds. There
are pairs of Eclectus Parrots, King and Yellow-naped Parrakeets,
though the latter are thought to be two cocks. Two aviaries are
devoted to Lorikeets of which we have Swainson's, Ornate and Scaly-
breasted and, at the time of writing, early in April, several pairs are
showing interest in nest-boxes.
Of the pigeons there are a pair each of Nutmeg and Imperial Fruit
Pigeons. The last named nested last year but did not hatch. Touracos
are represented by Buffon's, Hartlaub's, and the Grey Touraco or
Go-Away-Bird, and there are also a pair of Violet Plantain-eaters
(Musophaga violacea).
Both species of Cock-of-the-Rock are housed here, our old Orange
male which has come through the winter wonderfully well with only
the aid of an infra-red lamp, and also a specimen of the Scarlet, which
is either a female or an immature male. The betting is in favour of
the latter, and the question will probably be settled by the date of the
Society's visit.
Other specimens on view in the Bird House are a Variegated Bittern
from South America and a Kookaburra, both of which have aviaries
to themselves due to uncertain tempers ; a group of small softbills
including Silver-Blue Tanagers, Black-headed Sibias, and a Scimitar
Babbler ; a nice pair of Swainson's Toucans and a number of the very
attractive Guatemalan Green Jays, whose plumage has turned blue
in captivity. There is also a Venezuelan Wood Rail which tends to

keep itself out of sight, like all members of this skulking family, and a
small group of Crested Guineafowl from the Congo can be seen in
one of the flights.
In the long flight immediately behind the Bird House are specimens
of the Crested Curassow, Vulturine Guineafowl, and a single Congo
Black Guineafowl thought to be the only one in this country. Sharing
the flights are a number of S teller's and other members of the jay
family, and to round off a somewhat mixed bag, there is a Red-billed
Hornbill, a Grey Hornbill, and a Coucal.
Across the way in the Parrot House are five species of Macaw,
Severe, Military, Blue and Yellow, Red and Yellow, and Red and
Blue ; six species of Cockatoo, Funereal, Greater Sulphur-crested,
Moluccan, Leadbeater's, Bare-eyed, and Roseate, and six species of
parrot, African Grey, Amazon (six kinds), Senegal, Dusky, and
Maximilian's. Also housed here are Pileated Parrakeets, Black-headed
and White-bellied Caiques, and Queen of Bavaria and Blue-crowned
Conures. The large flight at the end of the Parrot House is filled with
a particularly colourful group of birds consisting of five of the large
Macaws, a pair of Black-winged Peafowl, and a pair of Black-necked
Cranes. Other members of the parrot family housed in aviaries else-
where are Princess of Wales, Barraband's, and Pennant's Parrakeets,
as well as the more common ones, and a number of lovebirds, mostly
Fischer's.
In the pheasant pens which are situated alongside the Parrot House
the outstanding exhibit is a magnificent pair of Impeyans, as well as
pairs of Elliot's and Swinhoe's, and pairs and trios of Golden, Lady
Amherst's, and Silver.
New to the collection and housed in the long aviaries by the house
is a pair of Sclater's Crowned Pigeons, the largest of the Columbi-
formes. These superb birds are the size of a hen turkey, coloured in
different shades of blue and with a large lace-like crest on their heads.
Mainly ground-living, they perch only when alarmed and at night.
To describe in further detail the species of crane, waterfowl, birds
of prey, and many other families which make up the collection would
take up too much space. We have in the Gardens almost 700 birds of
forty-two families, above 150 species in all.
I am warned against predicting breeding results, it being a dangerous
thing to count your Emus before they are hatched ! The weather now
in the first week of April is still bitterly cold and it would be foolish to
be too optimistic. It is hoped that on the occasion of the Society's
visit there will be some interesting new arrivals, but no doubt there
will also be disappointments to record.

Two species new to the collection have recently been received. They
are a Curl-crested Aracari ( Pteroglossus beauharnaesi) and an Equatorial
Dacnis ( Dacnis lineata aequatorialis).
The Curl-crested Aracari, a native of the forests of upper Amazonia,
has been kept by the Zoological Society of New York at Bronx Park
since early in i960, but not, so far as I know, elsewhere. Nothing
appears to be known of its natural life and habits.
A remarkable feature of this species is the form of the head feathers,
the distal half of each feather being a thin, curled, and glossy black
lamella, bearing, as Gould said, some resemblance to fine ebony
shavings. Some feathers that have been moulted are split at the centre
of this scale-like tip and each half curls round in a ram's horn fashion,
but it is difficult to tell whether all are like this. Feathers on the nape
and at the sides of the head are similarly lamellate at the tip, but are
not curled and are more lanceolate in shape.
The specimen of Equatorial Dacnis is a female or immature male,
being of a dull yellowish-green with yellow on the belly, at the sides of
the breast and, apparently, under the wings. The adult male is black,
emerald green, and yellow. There are three races of Dacnis lineata ,
the White-vented (D. 1 . lineata) of much of tropical South America ;
the Yellow-vented (D. L egregia ) of Colombia, and the rather similar
D. /. aequatorialis of Ecuador.
Other arrivals of especial interest are two Common Rheas that were
bred at Frankfurt Zoo during 1961, an immature owl of the genus
Scotopelia collected in Sierra Leone, four White-bellied Doves ( Leptotila
jamaicensis jamaicensis) , and a pair of Red Ground or Mountain Doves
(Oreopeleia montana ), some Humming Birds, notably Heliactin cornuta,
the Sun Gem ; Calliphlox amethystina, the Amethyst ; Heliothryx
aurita , the Fairy ; and Heliomaster squamosus , the Stripe-breasted
Star-throat.
A specimen of Jerdon's Chloropsis, Leaf bird or Fruitsucker, pre-
sented by Miss Knobel, appears to be the first since many years ago.
Kenya Eagle-Owls and Spectacled Owls are nesting. An Australian
Pelican received in June, 1924, has died.

In 1951 G. Ruddle, Fullarton, South Australia, bred a blue mutation
of the Princess of Wales's Parrakeet. It was eventually added to
David West's collection in California. It proved to be a male and in
1 953 was mated to a hen which immediately laid five eggs. From
these two normally-coloured young were successfully reared : one
egg was clear and the other two failed to hatch (see Avicult. Mag.,
1953, 164). I cannot recollect hearing further of these birds.
Now, according to an account in Bird Keeping in Australia, 1962, 23,
Bill McMillan, of Croydon, Australia, has bred another blue. The
clutch consisted of five eggs, only one of which was fertile--that
which produced the blue. In the Ruddle event the blue was bred in
an aviary containing a number of Princess and its parentage was in
some considerable doubt. In the present case, however, the parentage
is definite, so we may reasonably hope for the production of further
blues.

breeding results for last year. He writes : "I had a tolerably good
year with my birds. Less common results were ten Yellow-rumped
and one Chestnut-breasted Mannikin, two Lavender Waxbills, one
Yellow-bellied Waxbill (C. melanotis quartinia or kilimensis ?), two
Lophospingus pusillus, and two Galapagos Doves. Parson Finches,
Long-tailed and Masked Grassfinches, Blue-headed Parrot Finches,
Common Fire Finches, small Avadavats, and Bicheno's Finches were
bred in large numbers. Also about twenty Green-backed Parrotlets,
fifty to sixty Diamond Doves, including silver, five Emerald-spotted
and three Tambourine Doves : and, of course, Zebra Finches,

Doves from the Copenhagen Zoo on 15th November. They started
nest-building immediately and on the 25th there were two eggs.
Both eggs hatched on 6th December and the young left the nest on
18th to 19th. To-day (20th December) there is the first egg of the
second nest. Quick work ! "

An event which will undoubtedly prove of great interest to mem-
bers, and indeed to all interested in birds, is the opening of The
Tropical Bird Gardens, Rode, Nr. Bath, Somerset, which took place
on 23rd May, 1962.
Mr. and Mrs. D. H. S. Risdon, together with Mr. Michael King,
are developing the 17 \ acres garden of the former Rode Manor. Their
aim is to give the public the opportunity of seeing birds of widely
different species in natural surroundings. Many will be at liberty,
others will be housed in very large aviaries designed to blend with the
wooded gardens ; and in certain cases visitors will be able to walk
among the birds without intervening netting.
A descriptive report of the gardens will be published in a future
number of the Magazine.

This being the time of year when news items are scarce it may not
be out of place to give a few details of quail breeding in Japan.
Probably few members are aware of the extent to which the Japanese
Quail, Coturnix coturnix japonicus, has been domesticated. Its breeding
for the sake of its meat and eggs has proved such a success that it has
become quite a large industry. In recent years the annual production
of quail has fluctuated between 1,000,000 and 2,000,000. The great
majority are incubated by electric incubators in three hatcheries in
Toyohashi City. The largest hatchery is the Suzuki Hatchery, where
35,000 breeding quail are always kept. The incubation period is
sixteen or seventeen days. The sexing of the day-old chicks is done by
examination of the rudimentary copulatory organs, popularly known
as the Japanese method of sexing chicks. Only female chicks are sent
to customers. Some male chicks are raised for meat, but the majority
are disposed of.
By the time they are thirty days old the young quail are almost as
large as adults and are then transferred to the laying rooms. They lay
the first egg when thirty-five to sixty days old, usually when fifty days
old. During eight to twelve months from that time they continue to
lay. The laying efficiency for the first year is 80 per cent, so that the
number of eggs laid in the first year runs to between 250 and 300.

The laying quail, hatched in the spring, keep laying until the
following spring. During the whole period they are kept, day and
night, under artificial light. In the summer season the demand for
eggs is greatly reduced and the majority of the quail older than one
year are then disposed of for the purpose of meat.
Members interested in this subject are recommended to read the
paper " Quail Breeding in Japan 35 by Yoshimaro Yamashina,
published in the April, 1961, number of the Journal of the Bombay

COUNTRY BOOK. A Personal Anthology. By Macdonald
</figure>
<bodyText confidence="0.98653656" page_id="56317136"  page_num="115" year="" vol="">
Hastings. George Newnes, Ltd. London, 1961. Price 30s. net.
This delightful book is frankly autobiographical and traces the
author's gradual development from being born in a city to his life in
the country and, as a countryman, the aim of this anthology is to share
the happiness of a country life both with people of his own generation
and also new entries to the field.
Macdonald Hastings is well known to a very wide public as a
popular broadcaster who appears regularly on BBC television in the
Tonight programme ; being also a novelist and editor, very varied gifts
have been brought together in the creation of an anthology woven
into the pattern of his own life. The extracts are chosen from Britain's
incomparable literature on the subject, and are divided into four
sections--sowing, growing, harvesting, and ploughing. The passages
are chosen mainly to illustrate a love for country things and unfortu-
nately the few birds mentioned are mostly game-birds. These include
Perdix the Partridge , by Llewelyn Powys, a graphic description of the
ways of partridges, and a tribute to the song of the Blackbird in
A fine thing for England , by a somewhat unexpected author--Theodore
Roosevelt.
The photographs illustrating the book date from the time when the
author was editor of Country Fair and about two-thirds of them are by
John Gay. Those dealing with birds include a nest of young Shrikes,
a Rook in her nest of sticks, and the heads of a gobbler turkey and his
hen posed like a family group in a Victorian portrait album.

THE ANNUAL SUBSCRIPTION
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.998789583333333" page_id="56317137"  page_num="116" year="" vol="">
In 1894 a small group of British and foreign bird enthusiasts met
in Brighton with a view to forming a society devoted to their interests.
The north of England already had the United Kingdom Foreign
Gage Bird Society (founded in 1890) and London had the Cage Bird
Club (founded in 1893), publishing Reports and Transactions respec-
tively. Now it was to be the turn of the south.
Our Society was duly founded with an initial membership of
fifty-two ; the annual subscription being 55-. with 2s. 6d. entrance fee.
The first number of the Avicultural Magazine was published in
November, 1894. The first volume, consisting of 132 pages, was
printed at a cost of #39 2s. 6 d., and, as by the end of the first year
the membership had increased to 175, the accounts showed a small
surplus.
With an increase in the size of the Magazine and the inclusion of
coloured plates an increase in the subscription was found to be
necessary and so, in 1898, it was raised to Js. 6d., with a further rise
to 10s. in 1900. In 1918, with changed values occasioned by the war,
the subscription was raised to #1, and there it has remained ever
since--for forty-four years !
Since the last war the sponsors of every journal of similar standing
to the Avicultural Magazine have found it necessary substantially
to increase the annual subscription. The Avicultural Society alone
has maintained the old rate. But during the past few years the
Magazine has been published at a considerable loss--costs of produc-
tion have risen by no less than 40 per cent in the last two years :
and there is no reason to suppose they will not rise further. Council
has decided that the time has now come to be realistic and so, with
very great reluctance, the annual subscription due on 1st January,
1963, will be increased to #2 ; Life Membership #25.
It is hoped that members will realize that Council has been forced
to this decision by reasons beyond its control. Some members, it
is hoped that the number will be very small, may feel that the
increase is more than they can reasonably afford. It will be greatly
appreciated if those members who do not intend renewing their
subscription for next year would kindly inform the Hon. Secretary of
their wish to resign their membership.

(Uraeginthus cyanocephalus)
By Derek Goodwin (London, England)
A glance at Miss Talbot-Kelly's plate will show that this species is
one of the loveliest of waxbills. Not even the Violet-ear is more
beautiful. The lovely delicate blue of the male's head, breast, and
flanks is almost, but not quite, the same shade as that on the Blue-
breasted Waxbill ( Uraeginthus angolensis), it being, to my eye, just a
very little paler if the two species are seen side by side, or nearly so.
However, the blue of both appears paler or darker according to the
light. The young have the base of the upper mandible and a con-
siderable amount of the under mandible grey, the rest black. Their
eyes are dark greyish. The young males have pale greyish blue on
forehead, face, and upper breast; the young female has an even paler
blue on face and forehead only.
The Blue-headed Waxbill ( Uraeginthus cyanocephalus ) has a limited
range in eastern Africa. Since I started keeping Blue-breasted Wax-
bills (see Goodwin, 1959) I had often looked at museum skins of the
Blue-headed Waxbill or Blue-capped Cordon-bleu, as it is sometimes
called, and thought how much I should like to have some live ones
to keep and study. I had, however, done this in the spirit in which
one wishes one could win a million pounds, discover the secret of
eternal youth, or live in a world where the good fared better than the
wicked. I did not think that such a seemingly vain fantasy would
ever be gratified. True, a few of this species reached Europe in those
far-off golden days of aviculture between the two World Wars and
one of our members actually succeeded in breeding them (Decoux,
1 93 1 ), but it never occurred to me in my wildest dreams that any
more were likely to be imported or that I should be able to afford
to buy them if they were. But so it was.
On 28th September, 1961, scanning the advertisements in Cage Birds ,
I saw a specially displayed piece in the Toddington Bird Farm's
advertisement that ran roughly (I quote from memory), " Two pairs
only Blue-capped Cordon Bleus, very rare, #4 io.y. per pair." The

price seemed so reasonable that I feared for the condition of the birds
and in any case I was in some conflict about buying them owing to
lack of space in my little bird room. I consulted my friend Colin
Harrison, being reasonably sure that he would encourage me to buy
them. The decision made, I was filled with fears lest someone else
should get there first. Whilst I hastily made arrangements to take an
afternoon's leave, Colin phoned the proprietor of the Toddington
Bird Farm, who agreed to reserve the birds for me until I called for
them that afternoon.
Individuals and Their History to Date
I arrived at the Toddington Bird Farm about three in the afternoon.
The four Blue-headed Waxbills were, if not in " show condition ", at
least in very much better shape than I had feared they might be.
I was indeed favourably impressed with the establishment and the
condition of most of the stock, in very strong contrast to my feelings
about most other bird dealers I have visited, with the honourable
exception of the Keston Foreign Bird Farm. I did not feel sure
(wrongly as it turned out) that the Blue-heads, which were moulting
from juvenile to adult plumage, were two cocks and two hens as the
latter had one or two blue feathers ominously far back on their crowns.
Possibly some hormonal imbalance induced by their capture and
subsequent treatment had caused blue feathers to grow " in the wrong
place At all events the one that survived now has blue only on
the forehead as have all the few museum skins of wild hen Blue-heads
that I have examined.
Arrived home, I placed the Blue-heads in a cage in a well-lighted
room and left the light on all night so they could see to feed. Next
morning I placed one pair (Unringed Male and Unringed Female) in
my bird room. This is a rather small, but very well lighted, room
that I have fitted up as an indoor aviary. It has a small electric
bar-heater, covered with a wire netting screen on which many of the
waxbills like to sit and toast themselves, and a letter-box sized
" Judas-hole " is cut in the door so that I can sit outside in the
darkened corridor and observe the inmates. This room they had to
share with several Blue-breasted and Golden-breasted Waxbills
(.Amandava subjlava ), two Rosy-rumped Waxbills (Estrilda rhodopyga ),
four Black-capped Waxbills (E. nonnula), and four Avadavats (. Aman-
dava amandava). The other pair of Blue-heads I ringed (Blue Male
and Blue Female) and placed in a large cage in my bedroom.
From the first Blue Female never looked very well. I removed her
into a smaller cage in front of an electric heater in another room.
This may have been an unwise move, since the morning after she flew
hard against the wire when I went near the cage and fell down in an
apparent fit. She only partially recovered from this and died on

skull, also the fact that she was, despite the blue feathers on her
crown, a female.
Previous to this disaster this pair had been allowed to fly freely in
the bedroom by day. Being unmarried I am able to put " first things
first " when it is a question of weighing adequate interest and exercise
for captive birds against the odd dropping on the carpet. The first
night I found them roosting on the curtain rail but, after they had
been frightened off into the darkness and then caught and put back
into the cage (the light being then put on), they went back to roost
in the cage by themselves each evening without any trouble. I have
found Blue-breasted Waxbills and Java Sparrows equally easy to
manage in this manner also.
After he was alone Blue Male seemed ill at ease and was constantly
either singing, or attempting to do so (having not yet developed the
full song), or giving the contact call. At risk therefore of having a
" triangle situation " develop I put him into the bird room with the
others. This was about the middle of October and although they
had not yet come fully into adult plumage Unringed Male and
Female were already firmly paired, showing signs of nesting and the
male frequently displaying.
By 26th October the pair had placed a good deal of material in a
nest basket. This, and indeed most of their activities, greatly interested
the odd male Blue. He frequently went to their nest basket, examined
it, and pulled out the pieces of dry grass, often displaying (by himself)
with a piece when he had done so. If either of the pair noticed these
activities, as they usually did, he or she would fly at once to the scene
and Blue would retire hastily. The Unringed Male would also fly to
Blue if he saw the latter displaying * and alight near him, evidently
in a disapproving manner, for Blue would at once cease displaying
and move off.
On 27th October, however, an amusing incident (at least to the
watcher) occurred. Blue was displaying half-heartedly by himself
when Unringed Male, seeing him, at once flew and alighted on a
perch close to his, obviously expecting Blue to cease displaying and
retreat as usual. Instead, Blue hopped on to the same perch, sidled
along to within an inch or so of Unringed Male, and displayed very
intensely at him. Unringed Male appeared completely nonplussed by
this unprecedented behaviour, and remained motionless with erected
head feathers and a puzzled expression. Thereafter Blue often refused
to be intimidated by Unringed Male even although on the few
occasions that they actually fought Unringed Male won.
Although the female often attacked Blue when he displayed to her
Unringed Male seemed to be inhibited from attacking his rival when

120 D. GOODWIN-SOME NOTES ON MY BLUE-HEADED WAXBILLS
the latter was actually displaying. On such occasions he merely stood
" frozen " in the same nonplussed-looking attitude which he had
adopted when Blue displayed to him. Very different was his behaviour
when, as sometimes happened, Blue flew and perched beside his mate
(on her other side) while he was displaying to her. When this happened
he reacted by immediately ceasing to display, attacking his mate, and
chasing her furiously away. This behaviour, which I have also seen
in Blue-breasted Waxbills, would seem to be homologous to the
" driving " of doves and pigeons which I have discussed (Goodwin,
1956 and 1960a) in previous articles.
Unringed Male's mate remained faithful to him in spite of tempta-
tions but they unwisely deserted the nest they had commenced in a
basket and built another in some twigs against the wall of the bird
room. This contained at least three eggs on 27th November. Once
incubation had begun and building ceased, the inevitable fate of
exposed nests in aviaries full of estrildines began to overtake it. Bit
by bit it was undermined and de-roofed through other birds, especially
Blue, pulling bits of material out of it. Some eggs fell to the ground
and were broken. By 10th December there was only one addled egg
in the remnants of a nest, which I then removed.
The pair wasted no time in starting to nest again. By 12 th December
they had started nests in two nest-baskets and eagerly inspected a new
one that I put in on that day. On the 18th a minor disaster occurred
that may have cost me three young Blue-heads. When cleaning out
the room I accidently knocked against the support of the branches in
which the nest-basket they had finally chosen was fixed, causing it to
half fall from its supports. I was made aware of what had happened
by a sudden outcry of alarm notes from Unringed Male. To effect
repairs I had to take the basket down and found there were three eggs
inside it. I feared, probably rightly as events turned out, that they
might well have been cracked fatally, but I refixed the basket and
hoped for the best.
The birds returned to the nest and the hen subsequently layed
three more eggs. They continued incubation in spite of the very cold
spell that set in about 24th December, which considerably lowered the
temperature in the room in spite of the heating arrangements. I tried,
however, to compensate in some degree for this by rising early and
putting on the light in the room at between 2 and 3 a.m. during this
period. When I looked into the nest (with the aid of a torch) on
2nd January no eggs had hatched, but two appeared to be chipping.
When I looked at 6 a.m. on the morning of 3rd January two young
had hatched. They were already quite dry and gaped for food as
I shone the torch on them. Next morning there were still only two
young, but a third hatched some time later, as there were three when
I looked on the morning of the 5th.

D. GOODWIN-SOME NOTES ON MY BLUE-HEADED WAXBILLS 121
Much to my surprise all went well in spite of the lack of any wild
insects owing to the time of year and a temporary lack even of gentles
or mealworms on one day, when the young were ten days old, owing
to the Post Office " go-slow ". On 14th January the young were well
covered in quills but the feathers had not yet broken from the sheaths.
On the 18th they were well covered in feathers and for the first time,
instead of begging for food, they reacted to the torchlight by shrinking
back in fear.
On 20th January, after I had put the light on at 4 a.m., I went
back to bed but could not get back to sleep. Something was different
and at length it penetrated my muzzy early-morning mind that I was
hearing the contact call of a Blue-headed Waxbill constantly repeated,
a sound I had heard little since all three adults had been put together
in the room. Finally I got up at 5.30 a.m. and, wrapping a dressing-
gown around me, stumbled to my observation chair and looked
through into the room. A young Blue-head was looking out of the
entrance of the nest while its parents and several Blue-breasts fussed
excitedly about in the immediate vicinity.
The young bird kept looking out of the nest entrance, then dodging
back in, very obviously torn between conflicting, or rapidly alternating,
desire to come out into the world and fear of leaving the known
security of the nest. It uttered the contact call frequently. It also
often seized loose ends of grass at the nest entrance and pulled them
back into the nest. Once when it did so it pushed the piece of grass
up into the side of the nest with the same movement as a building
adult ; the other times I could not see what, if anything, it did with it.
Nothing happened whilst I was watching, perhaps because the
father, Unringed Male, evidently realized either that I or something
else was present on the other side of the door, and gave frequent alarm
calls. As with my Avadavats and Gold-breasts (Goodwin, 19606), the
Blue-headed Waxbills had never given any sign that they were
perturbed by, or even aware of, my presence when I sat " in the
outer darkness " watching through the Judas hole, but as soon as
they had fledged young the cock did so.
At 7.10 a.m., hearing excited calls from most of the waxbills, I
looked again and saw a fledgling Blue-head on the ground. All the
birds were very concerned, looking down anxiously, the parents and,
rather to my surprise, the Black-capped Waxbills, giving alarm calls.
A few minutes later another fledgling flew from the nest entrance
into the branches on the opposite wall. It was at once surrounded
by an excited crowd, one of the endearing traits of waxbills being the
unhostile interest which a newly-appeared fledgling excites in indi-
viduals other than its parents, when first they see it. After a few
moments it ceased to be the centre of attraction for the one on the
ground came out from its temporary hiding place. Not only its parents

but also the Black-caps and Blue-breasts were obviously " worried "
at its situation, looking down and giving alarm calls. The father
repeatedly flew down, landed near it for a second, and then flew up
into the branches. When at last the fledgling followed him and was
safely perched the parents became more at ease and the other species
soon lost interest.
One youngster went back into the nest after about half an hour.
I then went to work. Next morning three young were out of the nest
and I never saw them in it thereafter.
At this period, and for some days after to a lessening extent,
Unringed Male showed the usual hypersensitivity to possible or
imagined danger that is so characteristic of birds with near-fledging
or recently fledged young. However quietly I crept on to my observa-
tion chair his loud, scolding " tchek-tchek " would show that I had
not deceived him and my entrances into the room to feed and water
the birds elicited a frenzy of mobbing. From the way he flew towards
me scolding loudly I am sure he would have attacked me had he
dared to do so. This had, of course, a distressing effect upon the
young, frightening them so that they, as yet unfamiliar with the limits
of their world, fluttered against walls or windows, often ending up by
falling to the floor. When such disasters happened they naturally
confirmed all their father's worst fears as to my essential malignity
and roused him to a fresh outburst even if he had begun to cool
down a little.
Fortunately, within a day or two, things got very much better.
Just as those human children whose parents vainly endeavour to
control their behaviour by the constant reiteration of idle threats and
empty promises soon cease to consider either seriously so, even though
to a lesser extent, did the young Blue-heads soon cease to be quite
so upset by their father's " warnings ". Their mother, to my surprise,
never showed any reaction to my presence behind the door so far as
I could see. At first, whenever she fed the fledglings while I was
watching, the cock would fly and land by them giving the alarm call,
as he would also if one of the fledglings called. At first this would
put the hen off and she would stop feeding the young and look about
anxiously, but soon she began to take no notice, or at most to pause
for a moment, and then continue feeding the young. But the cock
bird also wanted to feed the young and soon (starting on the morning
of the 22nd) he also fed the young whilst I was watching. He did
not feel quite easy about so doing and gave alarm notes as he flew
to his young to feed them, even at times halting proceedings to give
an angry " tchek " between regurgitations. This no doubt relieved
his feelings, but naturally did not enhance his " authority " in the
matter of alarm calls.
The young birds started to fly about actively after their parents on

28th January. Before that they had mostly sat about preening and
pecking idly at twigs or cuddled up together waiting for their parents
to feed them. On the 29th they all ate some grit and one took and
swallowed a morsel of food left at the corner of its brother's mouth
after they had been fed. I first saw them feeding themselves on
30th January.
Both cock and hen fed all the fledglings and each parent fed each
young one every time it fed them. This was not simply a matter of
feeding whoever was begging most fervently. If one young one
begged more intensely than the other two it was usually fed first, but
the parent would lean across in front of, hop around, or even scramble
over the backs of two eagerly begging young that it had just fed in
order to feed the third one that it had not yet given anything to.

<bodyText confidence="0.998125766666667" page_id="56317154"  page_num="123" year="" vol="">
Panicum millet, maw seed, and canary seed was given ad lib. in
a tray on the floor. This dry seed was treated with halibut oil (about
seven or eight drops to a cupful of seed) about once every five days.
Soaked or germinating sprays of millet were also given on most days.
Mineralized grit, bird sand, and crushed dried eggshell was given
ad lib. daily. Natural food could only be collected at week-ends and,
owing to the time of year, was limited to turves of freshly growing
young grass and an occasional bit of flowering or seeding annual
meadow grass (Poa annua). Gentles were given ad lib. each day.
Whiteworms (given by spreading a handful or more of the earth and
bulb fibre in which they are cultured, together with the worms, over
the newspapers on the floor) and mealworms every two or three days.
When the birds had young whiteworms and chopped-up mealworms
were given ad lib. daily. Crumbled, home-made sponge cake (made
with two eggs, a little milk, and a packet of commercial sponge-mix)
was given daily mixed with the seed but so far as I have seen only
the Black-capped Waxbills ever eat any of it.
The soaked millet sprays I prepare by washing several millet sprays
under the tap. They are then placed in a shallow dish of warm
water in the heated airing cupboard. After twenty-four hours they are
washed again, one or two then fed to the birds (first mopping off the
surplus water with a towel), the others returned to the airing cupboard
and kept damp (but not immersed in water) and used over the next
few days till they are finished.
The Blue-heads fed largely on panicum millet, though also taking
the soaked spray millet and a little maw and canary seed. Gentles
and mealworms were taken only in very small quantities, prior to the
hatching of the young. Indeed, I only saw them eat these insects on
a very few occasions until just before the female started to lay, when
she began to eat at least a few gentles each day. These were mumbled

through the bill and beaten on the ground in a vain effort to break
them up, but finally swallowed with the skin still unbroken. Providing
cut-up gentles did not solve this problem since, as I had previously
found with other waxbills, the intact gentle is always taken in
preference to the mangled corpse owing to its (to the avian eye)
more appetizing appearance. Young grass shoots and the green seeds
of Poa annua were eaten eagerly whenever given and, like all my
other waxbills, the Blue-heads took quantities of grit and eggshell,
particularly.
On the day before the young hatched, or rather on the morning
when the eggs had appeared to be chipping, the hen started (for the
first time) to take whiteworms eagerly. The cock did not do so then
but the following morning he also was taking them. He also took the
insides, or at least parts of the insides, of cut-up mealworms, discarding
the skins after mumbling and sucking at them. It was evident
that neither whiteworms nor mealworms quite answered his innate
promptings in the matter of baby-food for on that first morning he
took these foods in a rather reluctant and half-hearted manner and
spent much time in frenzied, but vain, search all over the room,
obviously for insects he would have found in his native haunts.
From the time the young were about four days old the male was
keenest on cut-up mealworms, but the female took mostly gentles which,
although they were swallowed with the skins intact after much mal-
treatment, she apparently managed to feed to the young. After the
young were about ten days old whiteworms were practically ignored
and the female ate quantities of soaked spray millet which I think she
must have fed to the young. While the young were in the nest the
parents would often (but not for every feed) take grit or crushed egg-
shell after eating, but before going to feed the young.
Once the young had fledged it was easier to be certain what was
given to the young and from this time at least the parents differed in
their food choice. The male would always take first the soft parts of
cut-up mealworms, so long as these were available in a fresh state,
although later, in default of them, freely giving the young seed and
occasionally gentles. The female now fed them entirely on soaked
millet spray, ignoring insect food completely so far as I could observe.
Behaviour and Voice
In view of the short time that I have had these birds it will be
understood that the observations under this heading are, necessarily,
of a provisional nature. They are certainly far from being a complete
inventory of the Blue-head's calls and actions. In general this species
is very similar to the Blue-breasted Waxbill, and in those aspects of
behaviour (such as feeding behaviour, mandibulation, and mutual
preening) which are not specifically mentioned here it can be taken

that, so far as I have yet been able to observe, the two species do not
differ and readers are, therefore, referred to my paper on the Blue-
breast (Goodwin, 1959).

The Stem Display
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.995169210526316" page_id="56317157"  page_num="126" year="" vol="">
This is very similar to the homologous displays of most other wax-
bills and that of the Blue-breast in particular. The male seizes a piece
of potential nesting material, preferably a long grass stem, and holds
it by its more rigid end (exceptionally by the middle or by its laxer
end) in the tip of his bill. Then with his head feathers (or most of
them) sleeked and so disposed as to make the " triangular head "
common to most displaying estrildines, his flank feathers somewhat
fluffed out and his blue tail twisted towards the female, he bounces
up and down with an alternate straightening and bending of the legs.
His head movements differ slightly from those of the Blue-breast,
whose stem display is otherwise identical in form. Whereas the Blue-
breast appears to jerk his head upwards, with the Blue-headed Waxbill
the watcher has the impression of the head being nodded or bowed
forward. This seems to be due to the Blue-head moving his head
further downward and not so far upward during this display. This,
and the fact that he usually turns his head rather more towards the
female than the displaying male Blue-breast does, being doubtless due
to his having a bright blue crown and red culmen as well as blue
cheeks, breast, and flanks to exhibit.
During the stem display the male Blue-head usually sings but he
may display silently. The position of the tail is a direct consequence
of its presentation towards the female. If, as rather rarely occurs,
the male displays to a female directly in front of him, he holds his tail
quite straight while so doing. The stem display may be given
without song and it may be given by the female. The same is true,
contrary to what I once thought, for the Blue-breasted Waxbill.
Call Notes
Most of the calls of the Blue-headed Waxbill give one the impression
of the " same language as the Blue-breast's spoken with a different
accent ". The difference is about comparable with the same English
sentences spoken by a B.B.C. announcer and a northern or midland
workman.
The contact call is much deeper, throatier, and lower-pitched than
the " Tswee-tswee-tswee " or " Weet-weet " of the Blue-breast and
might therefore better be written " Tseuu-tseuu-tseuu It appears
to be given in identical situations to that of the Blue-breast (Goodwin,
1959). It is also given by the young after leaving the nest, especially
when they start to fly about and follow the parents.

D. GOODWIN-SOME NOTES ON MY BLUE-HEADED WAXBILLS 1 27
A rather soft, throaty " Tchet-tchet'" appears to be the equivalent
of the Blue-breast's high sibilant " Tsit-tsit " flight-intention note.
The alarm call is a harsh " Tchek-tchek-tchek The number of
" tcheks " varies with, apparently, the intensity of the bird's feelings,
as does the emphasis with which they are given. A number may be
uttered " strung-together 35 in very quick succession but never so as
to give a rattling or churring sound as in the homologous call of the
Blue-breast. I suspect, however, that if one could take a tape-
recording of the Blue-breast's alarm call and play it at a slow speed
it would sound much like that of the Blue-head, and vice versa.
I never heard any begging from the young while they were in the
nest and for the first day or two after leaving it their begging was
very quiet, a faint, sibilant " Tsee-tsee-tsee ". Later, however, par-
ticularly after they had begun to fly about after parents, they uttered
it more loudly. This rapidly repeated, high-pitched yet sibilant
begging call was only given in the immediate presence of a parent.
When further off the juvenile gives the contact call which changes
into the excited begging when the parent comes to it or when it has
flown to the parent. The hungrier the young the louder and more
rapid are the begging notes.
Song
The song of the Blue-headed Waxbill, at any rate as given by my
two males, is quite unlike the song of the Blue-breast. The latter
varies to some extent individually, but always sounds cheerful rather
than otherwise, and given in a rather hurried tempo except for the
final notes which are usually rather more drawn out and have a rising
inflection. Two of my attempts to paraphrase Blue-breasts' songs
were " Ghre-chreu, chre, chre chitty-weeoo ! " and " Chreu, chreu,
chittyoo, weeoo, wee ! ".
The Blue-head's song is delivered in a much slower tempo. It is
an odd mixture of alternate sweet, plaintive, piping notes and huskily
harsh and unpleasing ones. The fluting tone of the sweeter notes and
the deep huskiness which pervades the harsh notes of the song suggests
very strongly the song of the Bullfinch (Pyrrhula pyrrhula). I para-
phrased the full song of one male as " Teu, skurr ! Tsee-ee-wee-see-
see, skurr, teh-teh " ; the opening " teu " very plaintive and sweet,
the following " skurr " extremely harsh and throaty, then a jumble of
soft notes, then another harsh note and then two long, sweet, notes
at the end. There is some individual variation and shortened versions
of the usual song are often given. Always it sounds plaintive and
disconsolate, the harsh notes merely detracting from its aesthetic appeal
without thereby relieving its melancholy.
I have not heard my female sing, but it is probable that the female

has a shorter song which she seldom uses except when widowed.
This is the case with the Blue-breasted Waxbill.
The male's song is given (usually) when performing the stem
display. Also when he is perched usually at some little distance from
his mate. Under many circumstances (and the same is true of the
Blue-breasted Waxbill and the Java Sparrow) the song seems given
in much the same sort of situation as could elicit the contact call.
Indeed, if a bird is separated from its mate or companions it often
alternately sings and utters contact calls. In the Blue-breasted, females
at once recognize the songs of their own mates and no doubt this is
true of the present species also.

Conclusion ; An Appeal
</subsubsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999048157894737" page_id="56317159"  page_num="128" year="" vol="">
Since I obtained my Blue-headed Waxbills quite a number of this
species have come into this country. In view of their relatively small
range and the unsettled state of Africa it is hardly likely that they
will ever be imported in large numbers (or desirable that they should
be), or even that the supply will continue.
I therefore appeal to aviculturists to do all they can to breed this
lovely species and establish it in our aviaries. My own experience
shows this can be done without much difficulty or any expensive
resources. From my experience I should say this most lovely of all
the blue waxbills is quite as easily kept and bred as the Blue-breast,
if not indeed more so. No one need be put off trying it for fear it
might be as difficult to keep alive as the (Red-cheeked) Cordon Bleu
is reputed to be. I cannot, however, speak from experience of the
latter since, owing to its notorious reputation for delicacy, I have
never attempted to keep it.
Returning to the Blue-headed Waxbill, may I express the hope that
any of my readers who have also kept and studied it will make known
their own experiences and/or their comments and criticisms of my
article through the pages of our Magazine ?

Platycercus eximius
The Eastern Rosella provides a very good example of loss of apprecia-
tion of beauty through familiarity. The beautiful colours in the plumage
of this bird are not fully recognized by people in Australia because it
is such a common bird in the eastern states. The trade mark of a large
Australian canning company, " the Rosella ", as Platycercus eximius is
known to almost everybody, is a frequent visitor to many housewives'
kitchens on labels of conserves, sauces and canned fruits. However, to
aviculturists in overseas countries and to many foreign tourists to
this country, the beauty of this parrot is undoubtedly significant.
Regarded merely as " pretty " by most people, the commonest of the
Platycercus is officially ranked amongst the most beautiful birds in the
world--and rightly so. The late Neville Cayley, an Australian
ornithologist, justly described it as " one of the most beautiful parrots
in existence ".
A bright yellow-green is the colour of the rump, under the wings
and on the back, which has the characteristic black markings. The
abdomen is bright yellow merging into yellow-green towards the vent,
which is red. The shoulders, wing primaries and secondary tail
feathers exhibit a brilliant blue, while the central tail feathers are a
darkish green. Red is the general colour of the head and breast, while
the cheek patches or ear-coverts are white. The red on the head
gradually replaces the yellow-green of the nape as the bird matures
with age. With immature birds the red colouration is patchy and less
extensive than in the adults.
In 1792 Shaw and Nodder tabulated Psittacus eximius as the " Rose-
hill Parrot " of the early settlement at Sydney. It was called the
" Rosehill Parrot " after the settlement of Rosehill which later became
Parramatta. It is difficult to believe that P.e. eximius was not noticed
by interested parties until four years after the official tabulation of its
near relative P. elegans. This may mean that the Eastern Rosella was
not discovered until the colony expanded westward from the coast thus
excluding it from the immediate coastal areas, a fact still evident today.
In the early settlement days Rosella pie was considered a delicacy and
there are many who still regard it as such. George Caley in his field
observations on the Rosehill Parrot passes the remark, " They are
very good eating."

Distribution of the Eastern Rosella (P. eximius ).
Found from the Darling Downs areas of Southern Queensland
through coastal New South Wales, Victoria and into the eastern
portion of South Australia as far as the Kingston, Robe, and Tintinara
areas, and in Tasmania, P. eximius enjoys a range nearly as wide as
P. elegans. The reported sightings of P. eximius eximius in the Mt. Lofty
Ranges near Adelaide are probably the result of an established group
descended from aviary escapees, as the western limit of the range,
namely Robe or Kingston, is 90 miles from the Mt. Lofty Ranges.
Platycercus erythropeplus put forward by Salvadori as inhabiting the
Mt. Lofty Ranges is, as stated in the previous article, a hybrid. Two
major differences occur between P. eximius and P. elegans as regards
their distribution. The former is very rarely found along the immediate
seaboard, a common habitat of the latter, and is found much further
inland. Within this distribution range the Eastern Rosella frequents
open forest country, timber bordering creeks, rivers and watercourses,
farmlands and cultivated fields, and parks and gardens, while rain

forests, wooded glens and timbered mountainous country, which are
habitats of the Crimson Rosella, are not frequented by this smaller
member of the Platycercus. As far as the author can ascertain by observa-
tions, 3,500 feet seems to be the altitude limiting P. eximius while
P. elegans, as mentioned in the previous article, is found at altitudes up
to 6,000 feet. Within the range three subspecies, including P. eximius
eximius , have been tabulated and accepted, while one has been dismissed
as invalid.
Platycercus eximius eximius , the typical race, inhabits southern New
South Wales, Victoria and south-eastern South Australia. It enjoys
the widest range of the subspecies.
In 1911 G. M. Mathews tabulated a new subspecies from the northern
limits of the bird's range and named it after one of his relatives.
Platycercus eximius ceciliae of southern Queensland and northern New
South Wales is the Golden-mantled Rosella of aviculturists. This
subspecies seems to be extending its range both north of the Darling
Downs to the Gympie area in Queensland and south along the coastal
regions to the Maitland area in the Hunter River Valley of New South
Wales. This subspecies is readily separated from the typical P.e.
eximius by its golden coloured back, blue-green rump, and much richer
red breast and head. Many individual birds are slightly larger than the
typical race, but this may be an individual variation. The author met
this subspecies in 1959 in the Hastings River district of northern New
South Wales where it was plentiful at the time. The larger size was
definitely evident in the birds observed in this area.
While discussing P.e. ceciliae , mention must be made of the hybrid
zone existing between P. eximius and P. adscitus and the significance of
this race in relation to the expected consequences arising from the
existence of this zone. A significant overlap occurs in southern Queens-
land where the Pale-headed or Mealy Rosella ( Platycercus adscitus) meets
P. eximius ceciliae and in this overlap area hybridization occurs with
relative frequency. P. eximius ceciliae has the golden back, which in
many ways is not unlike that of P. adscitus , while the blue-green rump
could also be somehow a derivative of descent from a common ancestral
form possessing a dominant blue plumage. In i960 the author success-
fully bred three P. eximius eximius X P. adscitus palliceps hybrids and
two factors were most significant. All three young (two hens and a
cock) had the golden back and blue-green rump. The general colour
of the young birds was a light green and the red was reduced to a few
small patches on the head, whereas in P. eximius ceciliae the red is very
rich and extensive. An experiment that could be undertaken by
interested aviculturists would be to hybridize P. adscitus palliceps and
P. eximius eximius and proceed to develop from the young along the
following lines. Take one of the offspring and mate it back to a typical
P.e. eximius and mate the offspring again to a typical P. eximius and

so on. Take another of the offspring from the original breeding and
mate it in the same way with P. adscitus palliceps. Extremely thorough
notes could be taken of the plumage colouring of all young bred. The
experiment, admittedly, could only be carried out with the successful
breeding of fertile young from the original mating. The results of
such an experiment would be invaluable to studies on these species.
The author hopes to undertake this experiment in the future.
In 1911 also A. J. North tabulated the race inhabiting Tasmania
as Platycercus eximius diemenensis. This race is the best developed of the
species and is sought after by aviculturists wishing to exhibit on a show
bench. The red which is more brilliant than in P.e. eximius covers the
whole of the head and extends further down the abdomen while the
white ear-coverts are larger. This race is isolated from the mainland
and with further generations of development these differences may
become greatly accentuated.
Mathews in 1917 separated the birds of Victoria and south-eastern
South Australia from the typical race and tabulated them under the
new subspecies Platycercus eximius colei. Subsequent investigations of
his claims have failed to justify this and the subspecies has been
dismissed as invalid.
Usually found on the ground, where it spends much of its time in
search of food, the Eastern Rosella has similar feeding habits to other
members of the genus. While searching on the ground for seeds of
grasses and shrubs, which is the main constituent of its diet, the green-
coloured back of this bird blends in with the grass coverage extremely
well and, unless deliberately searching for them, the observer is
unaware of their presence until they take to the air. When flushed
the birds fly in their characteristic undulating manner to a nearby
tree, returning to the ground as the danger passes. When feeding on
gum-tips and berries on the outermost branches of trees and shrubs
their white cheek patches on a red breast and head are most con-
spicuous. Unfortunately this bird has developed a liking for cultivated
fruits and many are shot by orchardists. The extent to which this
orchard raiding has developed can be judged by the fact that in many
parts of its range the " Rosehill Parrot 33 has been officially listed as a
pest. The destruction in cultivated crops, such as wheat and oats,
caused by this bird is in many areas quite considerable and quite
often stern measures, such as poisoning by treated grain, have to be
undertaken.
While feeding on the ground the bird is extremely quiet, but when
feeding midst the top branches of a gum tree it often keeps up a constant
chatter, which undoubtedly signifies contentment. Other call notes are
a tuneful whistle, a single piping note uttered twice in quick succession
and a shrill screech given in alarm or when engaged in battle, a not
uncommon pastime. The single piping note call is often given when in

<bodyText confidence="0.999054266666667" page_id="56317164"  page_num="133" year="" vol="">
flight. All call notes are not unlike those of P. elegans but, as stated
previously, are of a higher pitch and less resonant quality.
The characteristic undulating flight seems to be brought about by an
almost complete folding of the wings during flight. The wings seem
to be almost withdrawn into the body causing the bird to fall, then
quickly extended again causing it to rise. When undertaking the usual
short flights from tree to tree or from the ground the bird usually
keeps close to the ground and rises up into the tree with the tail spread
for landing. However, when a comparatively long flight is undertaken,
a considerable height may be used. The tail is always spread in a fan-
like manner when alighting and this has a most pleasant effect.
Once again the most reliable method of sexing the birds is by the
difference in the head and bill structure. The cock bird is a slightly
larger bird with a stocky build and possesses a squarish head with a
broad bill. The hen bird is of a slighter build and smaller size with a
smaller, round head and a narrow bill tapering to a finer point on the
upper mandible. Juvenile birds possess under the wings two, or more
rarely one, white stripes, which are lost by the male bird in his first
moult and are usually retained by the hen. The sexes are alike in
plumage and a brilliantly coloured hen is not uncommon. Of seventeen
nesting pairs examined by the author in central, western and southern
New South Wales during the 1960-61 breeding season five hens were
adorned in brighter plumage than that of their mates. The common
belief that only the cock bird is able to whistle is not true in itself, but
is correct in so far as the cock bird uses the tuneful call note much more
than does the female.
The mating display is similar to that described in the previous
article but with individual pairs, as observed by the author, this dis-
play is often carried out on the ground in a manner not unlike that of
the ground-dwelling pigeons and doves. Quite often two rival males
will begin to display before the one hen but this does not last long, as a
fierce battle soon follows to decide which is worthy to continue the
attempt to win the " fair maiden's heart ". This bitter fighting between
males is quite common prior to the nesting season and seems to indicate
that the flocking of these birds in the winter months breaks many
breeding pairs. If this is true, and to what extent, is the reason for a
banding scheme, spread over three years, to be undertaken by the
author and other interested parties in southern New South Wales
beginning next year.
After mating has been successfully accomplished the hen bird goes
to nest. The nest is a hollow limb or hole in the trunk of a tree. The
bottom of the hollow is lined with decayed wood on which the eggs are
laid. Four to nine eggs, with five the usual number, are laid. The
oval-shaped eggs are white and lustrous but usually become nest-
stained very quickly. The young, after losing their white down,

JOSEPH M. FORSHAW-THE PARROTS OF AUSTRALIA
assume the same colour plumage as their parents with one small im-
portant difference ; there are blue feathers in the white cheek patches.
Ornithologists are of the opinion that the early parent form, from
which the two superspecies of the Rosellas have descended, was a green
and red bird with blue cheeks. The blue feathers found in the cheek
patches of young P. eximius is attributed to blue on this part of the
plumage in the ancestral form.
The feeding of the young is the duty of the hen only for the first few
days after hatching, but when the young are progressing favourably
the male is allowed to do his share. The young are fed regurgitated
food while in the nest and for a while after leaving their nursery, while
being taught to fend for themselves. Each time a parent bird visits
the nest the young respond with their characteristic grating call.
Frequently flushed from the ground along country roads and lanes,
the Rosella is a familiar part of the bushland scene in the eastern states.
It is often observed perched on the fences and posts along our main
roads and, unfortunately, many meet their untimely death on our
highways.
As the rising sun casts a soft golden haze over the farm homestead
and the farmer makes his way down to the milking sheds, he is greeted
by feverish activity as the Rosellas greet the new day with their happy
tuneful whistles. The farmer pauses for just a moment as he watches
a pair of these birds alight on the roof of his shed and make their way
along the guttering to drink the water brought by the previous day's
rain. Soon this pair are joined by other birds and the onlooker is
captivated for a few moments by their quaint mannerisms. After a
little petty squabbling they wing their way through the trees out of
sight. A Magpie (Gymnorhina tibicen ) greets the new spring day with its
beautiful warbling song and the farmer continues on his way, with the
brilliance of the red, green and blue colours on the plumage of the
Rosella, a bird he had always taken for granted as part of the country
scene, in his thoughts.
Besides being common around homesteads the Eastern Rosella is a
frequent visitor to parks and gardens in towns and cities. In Canberra
the many berry-laden shrubs and hedges attract flocks of the birds in
the summer months.
Platycercis eximius seems to be reasonably sedentary and present work
being undertaken by members of the Australian Bird-banding Scheme,
under the auspices of the C.S.I.R.O. Wildlife Survey Section, should
throw some light on this subject in the near future. The author has
observed that even in the coldest climatic regions within this bird's
range, namely the Northern Tablelands and the Southern Alps, they
remain during the bitter winters. During the winter months the
shortage of food forces the birds to raid fodder storage sheds and
haystacks in search of grain.

Although a flock species, Platycercus eximius does not have a very
friendly nature. It is a very pugnacious bird and spends quite a pro-
portion of its time fighting and squabbling with its own or with other
species. Two birds may often come toppling from a tree locked in
battle and so engrossed in their private war are they that one is able to
approach to within a few feet before they are aware of one's presence.
One interesting fact concerning the Eastern and Crimson Rosellas
has arisen from the author's observations. The author has found that
the young of these sympatric species show a difference in the easiness
with which an observer is allowed to approach. Young P. elegans
allow a much closer approach than do young P. eximius. In the previous
article the author attributed this difference to the camouflaging
plumage of young P. elegans but this is open to discussion.
Although great numbers of these birds are shot by orchardists and
farmers the species seems to be holding its own. It seems to be one of the
few species of parrots able to adapt itself to encroaching human
habitation. Before the authorities halted the export of Australian
fauna, many of these birds were sent to Europe and Great Britain
where P. eximius has become a familiar aviary bird.
Extremely popular in this country and overseas as an aviary and
cage bird, the Eastern Rosella takes kindly to aviary life. It is an expert
showman not hesitating at all to show his colourful plumage in a
displaying manner. Always on the move, with a constant whistling
and chattering, it brings life to an aviary. Unfortunately it cannot be
trusted with other birds as it has a most pugnacious nature and indivi-
duals will quickly develop into killers. It breeds freely in captivity and
while breeding the male bird becomes very hostile towards other birds
and one must remember to remove the young as soon as practicable if
the hen shows signs of breeding again. A hollow log or nest-box will
serve as a suitable nesting site, but two nests should be made available
to each pair so that they can choose to their individual requirements.
P. eximius is quite a hardy inmate of an aviary and, providing reasonable
care is exercised in its management, the birds should survive for a long
time. The diet is the same as given in the previous article for the
Crimson Rosella, with the plentiful supply of green food most essential,
especially if successful breeding is to be carried out. Many hybrids
have been successfully reared using this species and other members of
the genus. The Pale Headed Rosella X Eastern Rosella and Crimson
Rosella X Eastern Rosella have been the most common of these
hybrids.
A beautiful bird, largely unappreciated through familiarity,
Platycercus eximius has become widely known both in its native country
and overseas. An intrinsic part of the Australian country scene, the
Eastern Rosella thoroughly deserves its specific title " eximius " which
means " excellent ".

SIDELIGHTS ON THE NESTING BEHAVIOUR

<bodyText confidence="0.9870526" page_id="56317167"  page_num="136" year="" vol="">
By Professor Carl Naether (Encino, California, U.S.A.)
A little over a year ago, I came into possession of a mated pair of
the Key West Quail Dove (Oreopeleia chrysia), whose range includes
Cuba, the Isle of Pines, the Bahamas as well as many other islands.
These beautiful doves are quite rare in captivity, at least in the United
States, where they are much sought after by foreign-dove enthusiasts.
In their size as well as in their general behaviour they resemble the
Common Australian Bronzewing. As to the colour of their plumage,
their wings are a light chestnut-brown, the head and the neck are
iridescent with green and lavender and the mantle reveals a metallic
purple. Below each eye appears a rather prominent whitish band ;
chin and throat are likewise whitish. The breast is a light, soft vinaceous.
When the sun strikes these lovely birds' plumage, its metallic hues turn
truly brilliant. The hen of this species is somewhat smaller than the
cock, and in general her plumage is duller and paler.
For a full year these gentle, fully-mature doves, which occupy a
spacious, thoroughly well-protected aviary, gave no signs whatever of
wanting to nest. It was not until March of this year (1962) that I saw
the cock " driving " his mate by suddenly dashing at her vehemently
whenever she came anywhere near him. He did not, however, in any

way follow her or actually drive her to the nest, as is the habit of some
other species of foreign doves and of all domestic pigeons.
For their breeding site the Key West Quail Doves chose a large
open-top box, about 4 feet off the ground, in which the flimsy, loose
nest, made of sticks and dried leaves, occupied only half the available
space. Both male and female were on and off the nest beginning with
1 ith March and until 23rd March, at which time I discovered that it
contained two eggs. Being tame, these doves showed no fear at my
approach to the nest, which I examined quickly while both birds were
away from it. Not having kept Key West Quail Doves before, I was
keenly curious about their breeding behaviour ; hence I kept notes on
those days on which I was at home, their aviary being clearly visible
from my study.
Shortly after 9 o'clock on the morning of 26th March, I saw the
male flying into the nest-box, obviously to take over incubation duties
from the hen. There he would very gradually sidle up to her, sit very
close by her side for at least ten minutes, then very slowly push her
sufficiently off the nest to enable him to " get hold " of one egg, which
he somehow managed to roll under his belly. Now seemingly satisfied
with his " conquest ", he sat still. Thus both, male and female, sitting
side by side, each on one egg, remained on the nest for fully half an
hour, the while cooing softly, Finally, the hen left the nest and " her "
egg.
Two days later, on 28th March, the hen seemed to stand in the nest :
certainly she was not sitting on the eggs. Sensing that something was
wrong, I glanced into the nest-box where I found one egg lying
beside the nest, no doubt rolled out by the male during " the changing
of the guards ". As I tried to place this egg gently under the male,
who was then sitting, he flew off the nest and onto the floor of the pen.
The moment his mate espied him, she flew into the nest to brood
the eggs.
On a cloudy 29th March, I found male and female sitting side by
side in the nest at eight in the morning. Again the male had managed
to take one egg away from the hen, so that each bird was brooding one.
Again I put the misplaced egg into the nest proper.
On 30th March, both doves were on the nest at 8.20 in the morning,
the male just beginning to shift one egg to one side and under his
belly. This time the hen left the nest and " her " egg fairly promptly,
dropped to the floor of the pen where she began to pick up twigs and
leaves which she carried to the nest. There she dropped them on the
uncovered egg which, soon wholly submerged, began to cool off.
Meanwhile, her mate kept on brooding " his " egg.
At this point I should like to interject some comments on a phase of
behaviour which seems to be peculiar to this species : both male and
female, when sighting each other on or off the nest, are constantly

twitching or vibrating the tips of their flights. They have " indulged 55
in this behaviour ever since they showed signs of wanting to nest,
i.e., since early March of this year. Apparently this twitching of the
flight-tips is a means of communication, the pair resorting to it only
when in sight of each other, either on the ground or in the nest. A
similar habit I have observed in domestic pigeons : at mating time
and prior to egg-laying, the male, sitting in the nest-box and calling
for his mate, will flutter or twitch his wing-tips rapidly. But he will
not do so when off the nest. Moreover, the female domestic pigeon
seems not to engage in this habit at any time.
On 31st March, I found both eggs covered with nesting materials,
which the hen had assiduously carried to the nest daily. There being
no visible eggs to incubate, the doves deserted their nest.
On the morning of 1st April, male and female were back in the nest,
side by side. In the late forenoon, the hen began again to gather sticks
for the nest.
On 2nd April, both doves were off the nest, which contained
no eggs.
On 4th April, they again occupied the old nest, which contained
one egg.
On 5th April, a hot day, the hen was standing over two eggs.
From this time on the behaviour, detailed above, was repeated in
that the male again pushed his mate out of her position in the nest
sufficiently to enable him to roll one egg under his belly ; then both
birds began to incubate side by side for an hour or more before the
hen decided to leave the nest. Now she began to get busy immediately
carrying more and more sticks and leaves to the nest, dropping some
by the side of her brooding mate, some on top of him, and some on the
uncovered egg. Within a few days the nest was so filled with sticks
and the like as once more to cover both eggs, which, incidentally,
proved to be fertile. Not " finding 55 their eggs among the mass of
sticks and twigs, the doves again deserted the nest. During all this
nesting, they were in almost constant communication with each other :
sometimes by means of cooing, but at all times by means of twitching
the wing-tips. This second nesting lasted until 21st April.
During the latter part of May, these doves occupied a different nest-
box. It was just large enough to accommodate one sitting bird. In
other words, the male cannot sit by the side of his mate when he tries
to relieve her of brooding duties--cannot take an egg away from her.
And this time there has thus far been no standing over the eggs, but
rather a close sitting on them. Moreover, no new material is being
added to the nest by the hen, as was the case in prior nestings. Inci-
dentally, I doubt whether in the wild state a female Key West Quail
Dove would yield to the habit of carrying new material to her nest
daily, and long after she has laid eggs : for, ordinarily she would need

the time off the nest to gather food, which activity--the food not being
as plentiful and as easily obtainable as in captivity--would tend to
keep her well occupied during her absence from the nest. On some
occasions, I have observed domestic hen-pigeons continuing to build
nest after they had laid, some of their nests reaching a height of from
6 to 10 inches, at which point or points they would usually topple over
and of course bury the eggs.
In due course, I hope to report further on the behaviour of this pair
of Key West Quail Doves, whose actions intrigue me no end. Even
though my long-time hobby of keeping some of the rarer species of
foreign doves and pigeons may not yield many breeding successes, it
cannot help but afford me plentiful opportunity for gathering provoca-
tive and even exciting data relating to their behaviour--an opportunity
which I value highly and enjoy greatly.

PETER'S TWINSPOT AND THE
BROWN TWINSPOT

By C. J. O. Harrison (Perivale, Middlesex, England) and
B. P. Dormer (Luanshya, N. Rhodesia)
(This account has been prepared from correspondence which I had
with Mr. Dormer regarding the display of Peter's Twinspot, which he
had witnessed in his aviary. In the following notes the descriptions are
his and the comparative comments are mine. C.J.O.H.)
Both these species of African Waxbills are birds of the bush and forest
edge and little has been recorded of their habits. Peter's Twinspot,
Hypargos niveoguttatus, is the more brightly coloured of the two. The
cock is grey on the crown and nape, and brown on the wings and back,
with a red rump and red-and-black tail. The sides of the head, throat,
and upper breast, are deep red and the rest of the underside is black,
with numerous bold white spots on the flank. The hen is more dull
in colour, the sides of the head being grey, the throat buff, the breast
paler red, and the under side grey where the cock is black. The Brown
Twinspot, Clytospiza monteiri, is more soberly coloured, being grey on
the head and dark brown on the back. The rump is red and the tail
blackish-brown ; the breast, flanks and belly are chestnut coloured
and heavily marked with white spots which change to white barring
on the belly and under tail-coverts. There is a red stripe on the throat
of the cock. The hen is rather similar in colour but possesses a buffish-
white throat stripe.

40 G. J. O. HARRISON AND B. P. DORMER-DISPLAY OF TWINSPOTS
Behaviour of Peter's Twinspot
The normal contact call of the species is a rather high-pitched
" twee " uttered usually at about five second intervals. The alarm note
is a single sharp " chip ", usually heard as the bird dives into the thick
undergrowth of its normal habitat. The song does not consist of a
continuous phrase, but of random notes resembling various call-notes.
The straw display is performed on the ground, the cock bird dancing
round the hen with a feather in his bill, his tail fanned out and bent
slightly to one side, and uttering a faint and not very musical song
sequence. He performs a bobbing movement, the head being alter-
nately pointed upwards at an angle of about 70* and bowed to about
30* every second during the display. He starts with his head in the
elevated position, body crouched close to the ground. He next lowers
the head ; then throws his head up and at the same time hops about
half-an-inch off the ground. His head is then slowly lowered until it
is slightly bowed and the motion is repeated. One gains the impression
that he has to wait before his next hop in the air for his slowly descending
head to catch up. He does not hop until his head is in the lowest
position, so that he can throw it up again simultaneously with the next
hop. One is always struck by the grace and delicacy of the display.
Meanwhile the hen remains motionless and slightly crouched, until
she invites mating by rapidly quivering her tail in the typical
estrildine manner.
In the wilds this species appears to indulge in a form of communal
display in which, towards evening, a number of pairs congregate in a
patch of thick undergrowth. Here the cocks hop around from twig to
twig, maintaining distance of about five or ten yards apart, and display
as though to one another, meanwhile uttering a sharp " chip "
followed by a long descending musical trill starting high but ending at
a low pitch. The hens appear to play no part but simply sit and watch.
The display may last for up to half-an-hour.
In the aviary the nest is built on the ground, under a pile of brush.
First of all a shallow saucer-shaped depression about 2 inches in
diameter is scraped out on the site of the proposed nest. A normal
domed nest is then built in this depression. Small rootlets are the
favourite material, and no grass longer than 3 inches has been used.
The nest is lined with feathers. Although the clutch is usually described
as three eggs, all the clutches laid in the aviary have numbered from
four to six eggs, four being the most common number. Incubation
takes sixteen days. When either bird relieves the other for incubation
duties it always seems to bring an additional bit of grass or rootlet,
or perhaps a feather, to add to the nest. The chicks are black,
with a few tufts of greyish down, and have bright chrome-yellow
gapes.

Behaviour of the Brown Twinspot
The display is in all respects identical to that of Peter's Twinspot,
except that the movements of the cock bird are far more jerky and
less graceful. The voice has little to commend it and is very reminiscent
of the crackling of the Bishop Birds ( Euplectes spp.). A pair nested in an
aviary in a box 3 feet off the ground. Four eggs were laid and both
sexes shared in the incubation, but the nest was usurped by a spinster
Peter's Twinspot and nothing came of it.

It is interesting to compare these displays with the similar straw
displays of the better-known waxbill species. The typical waxbills of
the genus Estrilda, the Red-eared Waxbill and its relatives, have a
bobbing display on a perch with a piece of grass or a feather held in the
bill, which is pointed upwards. This is accompanied by the short song
of the species. The Fire-finches of the genus Lagonosticta have a similar
display. Except in the possible case of L. rufopicta , the Bar-breasted
Fire-finch, this is not accompanied by song but by a special display
note which appears to be synchronised, in some species at least, with
a slight lifting of the bill. The Senegal Fire-finch, L. senegala, terminates
each series of bobbing movements by a bow forwards and across in
front of the hen.
The Blue Waxbills of the genus Uraeginthus (including Granatina )
have the typical upward-bobbing display movement with grass or a
feather held in the bill, accompanied by the song-phrase. Derek
Goodwin (pers. comm.) noticed that when the Blue-breasted Waxbill,
U. angolensis displayed there was a slight throwing-up of the head at
each upward jerk of the body. In the case of the Blue-headed Waxbill,
U. cyanocephalus this upward movement of the head was of wider
amplitude, the head descending lower between the jerks in an apparent
nodding movement, and then being noticeably raised coincident with
the upward jerk of the body. He considered that the presence of the
blue colouration of the whole head in this species was linked with this
lowering of the head during display.
We have here evidence of an increasing upward movement of the
head coincident with the upward bob of the body. This bobbing is
caused by a sudden straightening of the flexed legs resulting in an
abrupt upward movement ; so abrupt that the bird's feet momentarily
leave the perch. In the case of the Twinspots we would appear to
have a further exaggeration of this movement, the head being thrown
up coincident with each upward bob, and deeply lowered between each
movement. The jerky bobbing becomes a series of spaced upward
jerks of sufficient force to appear as small hops, this being more apparent
since the display occurs on the ground whereas, in the other species

mentioned, display occurs on a perch. As in the case of the Blue-
headed Waxbill areas of bright colour on the plumage emphasize the
movement. Both species are cryptically coloured on the upper surface
and brightly coloured beneath ; and the sudden upward movement of
the head would repeatedly give a sudden revelation of bright colouring
to the watching hen. Both cocks have bright red on the throat.
It would be of interest to know just how the display of the Green
Twinspot, Mandingoa nitidula, compares with these. This species is
green in colour with the lower breast, fore-belly and flanks black,
boldly spotted with white. The cock has bright red on the sides of the
head extending from the base of the bill to around the eyes, and in
some races, Schlegel's Twinspot for example, the throat and chest are
orange-red. Here again there is the bright colouration about the
head and throat of the cock.
Two aviculturists have written of the behaviour of this species. Both
accounts are in German and give rather scanty detail. Burkard (i960)
refers to a straw display with a long stem held in the bill, which the
bird " whips vigorously up and down, during which the upthrusting
movement of the head is directed straight up, as though it wished to
throw the stem over its shoulder ; so that at the uppermost point of the
movement the body has a more upright stand than at the lowest point
of the movement." Burkard records that a hen Peter's Twinspot
showed interest in this display. Karl (1961) records that the hen
Green Twinspot would fly to a displaying cock and then fly down to the
nest, the cock dropping the stem and following her. Both would
disappear into the nest where the cock would sing again and hop up
and down, the movement of the nest being visible from outside. He
suggests that copulation would probably occur in the nest. He also
records a hen, in such circumstances, flying not into the nest but to a
corner of the aviary where she solicited copulation. Subsequently
the cock built a nest at this spot. According to Karl the cock builds the
nest, the hen only adding a little of the lining. Burkard states that the
hen incubates most of the time but that the cock takes over when she
leaves the nest to feed. When not incubating a cock, at this period, was
observed to sit with another pair of Green Twinspots that shared the
same aviary.
The display described suggests a performance similar to that of the
other Twinspots, with an upward thrust of the body accompanied by an
upward movement of the head, but seems to imply that it takes place
in a more upright posture, the final position suggesting that of the
more upright type of waxbill straw display. It would be useful if one
of the the aviculturists possessing birds of this species could let us have
a more detailed description of this display.
Burkard records that with two pairs of Green Twinspots in one
aviary there was no evidence of animosity during the period when

display and nest-building were taking place. This raises the interesting
question of the degree of sociability which these species show. The
apparent communal display of Peter's Twinspot seems to have no
parallel in the behaviour described for other estrildines, and its precise
function in relation to the breeding season is uncertain. In reasonably
sociable or tolerant species of waxbill, display by a cock is more likely
to elicit interference by another, and there appears to be no evidence
of display by one individual stimulating similar behaviour in another.
These three Twinspot species have been regarded as representatives
of separate genera by most authorities, although Delacour (1943)
regarded Peter's and the Brown Twinspots as closely related. All three
show some similarity of plumage and structure, and the main difference
appears to lie in the wing-formula. From the evidence here they would
appear to show similarities of display which might suggest that they
are more closely related to one another than to the other waxbill
genera mentioned. This display of the Green Twinspot seems to be
closest to that of the Blue-headed Waxbill.

I think it would be fairly safe to say that no other gallinule has
been so extensively chronicled as the diminutive Chinese Painted Quail
Excalfactoria chinensis norm, although, no doubt, the beautiful Golden
Pheasant Chrysolophus pictus would not be far behind. I therefore do
not propose to go over old ground again but only to offer one or two
observations which might prove of interest to other aviculturists. The
following notes are only concerned with a small part of the breeding
biology of the species, namely that prior to the appearance of the
young.

Personal records seem to suggest that this becomes most apparent
about one week prior to the laying of the first egg. It would also
seem that the hen actually lets her mate know when she is ready to
breed ; or, at least, that is my interpretation of the following behaviour
of the hen bird towards the cock. Although this behaviour has been
witnessed on a number of occasions, for the purpose of this description
I will quote one particular incident from my notebook.

144 l - D - WOODWARD-BREEDING BEHAVIOUR OF PAINTED QUAIL
This behaviour involved the hen continually chasing and pursuing the
cock bird around the flight. " Continually " is stressed because for
one whole day's observation on this pair of birds I found that the hen
never once gave up the chase ; I did not notice either bird even feed,
except early in the morning. Whenever the hen caught up with the
cock, she would aim persistent jabs of her mandibles at his flight
feathers, sometimes gripping his wing to such an extent that he would
be halted and buffeted back towards the hen with astonishing force
and speed.
For the next few days the time-period of this behaviour decreases
to only sporadic jabs at the male, but at the same time the hen seems
to assume a different posture and attack. Whereas previously she
would make ceaseless and sometimes inaccurate moves towards the
cock, her motion now begins to take on a more " smooth " approach.
By this I mean that she extends her neck and bill parallel to and
about half an inch from, the ground, and in this mode chases the
cock in an apparent " weightless " gait ; the action is so smooth that
it appears she is floating through the air, and is quite unlike the
behaviour of the cock which is described below. Many times, when
she is in this " mood ", she will occasionally remain motionless in
the neck-extended position when the cock approaches too near, and
only if the cock gets too " brave " will she make the attack.
A day or two after the assumption of the hen's new postures, the
cock starts to come into its own gallant self, and he starts to pursue
the hen. His behaviour, however, is somewhat more elaborate than
his frustrated mate's. Almost simultaneously he will puff out the
feathers on the body and lower his axis so that the head almost
touches the ground and his rear part is raised--very similar to the
behaviour assumed when a hornet Vespa crabro was placed before a
particular cock (see Woodward, 1961), or when a strange hen has
been introduced into the same enclosure as the male. In this posture
he pursues his mate, but immediately he starts to run he droops the
wings away from the body and drags them along the ground. I only
once ever saw the hen do the latter. Coition always follows.
During this behaviour the hen can mostly be heard emitting a
chicken-like " chip-chip, chip-chip ", whilst the cock bird's call can
generally be likened to a repeated " chuck-chuck-chuck, chuck-chuck-
chuck ". My observations have shown that the above-mentioned
displays by both birds hardly ever occurs after the appearance of the
first or second egg.
Laying of Egg
On one occasion I had the good fortune actually to witness the
process of the hen preparing to, and laying, an egg. The hen walked
over to the nest and settled on the eggs, accompanied by the cock

who stood close by. A minute or two later she adopted a hunched
posture, with neck pulled close to the body. A few seconds later she
lifted herself from the eggs and positioned her body to the side of the
nest, tail facing inwards, and straddled her legs something like
11 inches apart ; in this position her body was about parallel to the
ground. She now took on a hunched appearance again and at the
same time fluffed out the feathers, and I particularly noticed that
the portion at the throat-belly was considerably puffed out or inflated.
In this position she appeared to experience strain : in fact, to the
extent that she closed both eyes completely. At this time the cock
bird, close by, was continually " clucking " in the well-known manner,
as though he was aware of his partner's difficulties.
When the egg eventually appeared, the drop between the vent and
the ground was about i inch. The very height of this drop and the
fairly fast speed at which the egg was ejected, may be the explanation
of the bird laying the egg at the side of the nest. The hen remained
in the pre-laying posture for about 5 seconds after the egg appeared,
after which she assumed her natural appearance (bringing the feathers
back to the body) and then gave a quick inspection of the egg before
leaving the nest and joining the male bird, now at the other end of
the flight.
Immediate examination of the very warm, clammy egg revealed
that it was fairly smooth in texture, coloured a polished grey-
green ; quite unlike the other seven eggs, which were a very dark
khaki shade. However, within a few hours this, too, turned into the
identical colour of the other eggs. This colour-changing tendency
would seem to be rather contrary to the development that occurs
with some eggs when subjected to light. For example, when the pale,
glossy blue eggs of the Starling Sturnus vulgaris or Pied Flycatcher
Muscicapa hypoleuca are subjected to direct light they very soon take
on a creamy colour.

The Owl aviaries at Chester house six species of owl--Snowy,
Tawny, Barn, Long-eared, Great Eagle-Owl (Bubo bubo) and Spotted
Eagle-Owl {Bubo africanus). There are four aviaries consisting of
flights 20 feet long by 10 feet wide, with open-fronted shelters at the
back 6 feet deep.
Both pairs of Eagle-Owls have an aviary to themselves, and when
early in March this year it became clear from the courtship displays
and from seeing both hen birds making nesting scrapes on the ground
in the corner of the shelter, that breeding attempts were being made,
slight alterations were made in the aviaries to try to provide some cover.
In the case of the Great Eagle-Owls, a low dry stone wall 2 feet high
was constructed across half the width of the shelter immediately
opposite the corner where the nest scrape had been made. Within
twenty-four hours a second scrape was made in the unprotected corner
and the first egg laid.
In the case of the Spotted Eagle-Owl, the screen was made of fir
branches, and in this case the hen appeared grateful for the cover,
and was out of sight of anyone outside the aviary during incubation and
early rearing. Her neighbour was in full view of the public during the
whole process, and appeared quite unconcerned.
Both birds laid clutches of four eggs each and I see from my diary that
the first Great Eagle-Owl egg was laid on 18th March, and the first
Spotted on 28th March. Both birds started incubating as soon as the
first egg was laid, and were each seen off their nest once only during
incubation when the number of eggs in each clutch was noted.
Incubation period in each case was about thirty days, though it is
impossible to be certain since both hens sat very closely. We ascertained
a day or two after the thirty day period that Bubo bubo had at least one
chick and a fortnight later that the africanus had also hatched. It is
thought that in both cases the youngest owlet hatched about a week
after the oldest, but it was not for nearly a fortnight that we discovered
that it was four out of four in both cases.
At today's date, 4th June, the oldest Eagle-Owl is nearly as big as its
parents and feathering well. It is amusing to see the difference in
sizes in the family. The youngest chick is half the size of the oldest,
and still in the down.
The four little Spotted made their first public debut from behind
their screen of fir two days ago. Though ten days younger than the
Great Eagle-Owls they are about as far advanced though much smaller,
proving what has been already reported in the Magazine that the
tropical africanus matures very much more quickly.

or chicks on alternate days, the latter to provide fur and feather
roughage without which their digestion goes wrong. One day a week
they are starved, again as an aid to digestion, but in the case of the
two breeding pairs this rule was amended, and some food given every
day. It was felt that a day without food might cause the sitting birds
to desert.
Both pairs were quiet and unaggressive during incubation, but both
cock and hen Bubo bubo became extremely dangerous as soon as the
first owlet was hatched, so that it has been impossible to enter their
aviary. The Spotted have been fairly unaggressive, though the female
sometimes attacks the keeper's gumboots !
Providing sufficient pigeons, rats and poultry to feed eight owlets
has been quite a headache and we are most grateful to members of
our Council and staff who have helped. It has been most rewarding
to achieve that rare avicultural success, a " hundredpercenter ", and the
keepers most concerned, Messrs. Bennel and Ford, are to be warmly
congratulated.

the collection, were recently received. They were in a collection
brought by Mr. J. J. C. Mallinson to the Jersey Zoological Park.
This Francolin inhabits parts of south-western Africa and the area
from Lake Ngami to western Transvaal, the more easterly birds being
described by de Schauensee (1931) as a sub-species (F. a. kalahari), a
claim that appears not to be generally accepted.
Other arrivals of especial interest are a Lammergeyer, a pair of
Green Pheasants ( Phasianus versicolor ), a pair of Scintillating Copper
Pheasants and two Rufous-breasted Accentors ( Prunella strophiata).
Birds bred in the Gardens include three Ashy-headed Geese, one
Princess of Wales' Parrakeet, one Great Eagle-Owl, one Kenya Eagle-
Owl and a Spotted Eagle-Owl. The Kenya Eagle-Owl is, of course,
Bubo capensis mackinderi : the southern race, B. c. capensis, was bred here
in 1905, four young being reared.
The Great Eagle-Owls nested again when the chick of the first nest
was about half-grown and this time their eggs and those of Snowy
Owls were transposed for the reason that the latter have only ever
reared a single young one, but the manoeuvre was a failure. Little
Owls, Spectacled Owls and Abyssinian Eagle-Owls nested, but the
eggs were infertile as were those of Greenland White-fronted Geese.
A Great Bustard laid several eggs and a King Penguin's egg is at
present being incubated. The Sarus Cranes, that have bred during

the past two summers are incubating two eggs, nesting some six weeks
earlier than last year, possibly because the previous season's young one
was removed earlier.
A Large Pied Wagtail ( Motacilla maderaspatensis ) received in Decem-
ber, 1950 has died. This bird built and laid a clutch of eggs each
summer for several years and we once tried a male Pied Wagtail with
her, but she would have nothing to do with him. This Wagtail is
sometimes considered to be conspecific with M. alba , but Vaurie
(The Birds of the Palearctic Fauna) gives it as a separate species, for, as
he says, it differs " structurally as well as through its plumage sequence,
and is furthermore sympatric with the races ( alboides and personata) of
M. alba in the North West Frontier Province and the northwestern
Himalayas, showing no signs of interbreeding ".

taken place at the Chester Zoo. A blue Masked Lovebird male
mated to a Fischer's hen has fathered a single young one which has

Last October a pair nested and the female was not observed to leave
the burrow for six weeks. By Christmas she had obviously deserted and
examination of the nest revealed no trace of egg-shells or young ; only
feathers, dried grass and shelled seeds were in the chamber.
W. E. Stevens, Chatham, has had rather more success in his small
colony. There have been several infertile eggs and one young one
which was thrown out of the nest when about two weeks old.

Proof of what can be done in the way of breeding, if one has sufficient
enthusiasm and perseverance, under what might be described as
unfavourable conditions, is forthcoming from Herbert R. Anderson who
writes : " I may tell you that I dwell in an apartment in the heart oi
Chicago, with bird keeping divided between a living room flight-cage
and breeding-cages in the bedroom. Under these conditions I managed
this past winter, with the fine help of some Bengalese, to raise twelve

An event of great importance at the Edinburgh Zoo last year was
the arrival of a Kiwi Apteryx australis mantelli , a gift from the Zoological
Gardens of Wellington City Council, New Zealand.
This bird is a female hatched and reared in the Wellington Zoo and
is thus known to be three years old. Shortly before leaving New Zealand
it was mated with a male bird. There is therefore a possibility of
" Wiki 5 5 laying not only an egg but a fertile one (it did this in Welling-
ton last year), If any such egg could be successfully incubated the
chick would assuredly be the first hatched outside New Zealand !

About 125 members and guests accepted the Sixth Annual Invitation
of the Chairman and Council of the North of England Zoological
Society to lunch at the Zoological Gardens, Chester, on 20thJune, 1962.
The Chairman of the Society Mr. G. B. Groundsell welcomed the
visitors and presided at the lunch. Mr. K. A. Norris thanked the
Chairman and Council on behalf of our members.
The warmest thanks of our members are due to Mr. and Mrs. G. S.
Mottershead and their staff for making this event so very enjoyable.
The sun came out in the afternoon and there were four or five hours
of lovely weather. Disappointingly the roses were not in flower, due
to the late season they were at least a week behind. Much admired
were the new Elephant House, the inside of which is really marvellous,
and the herd of four Eland.

Galahs were double-brooded, rearing six in two broods of three.
Obviously they had to get off to an early start and, in fact, I heard
young on 22nd April. The first three were removed from the parents
on 14th and 16th July ; two eggs of the second clutch were then in
the nest. Three young of the second brood were taken from the nest
on 20th September and an attempt was made to hand-rear them,
but they were too advanced and had to be returned. They were still
being fed by the parents on 11 th October. This year I have young
Galahs at the " quilly " stage and a single (I think) young Citron-crest.
The hen (mother of this bird) was seen by me a few days ago with a
sparrow which she had presumably caught and killed in the aviary
and, if not actually eating it, was taking it to pieces. I dare not go too
near to watch as she threatened to take it into the nesting-barrel which
didn't seem to me to be a good idea. I have for several years fed
cockatoos in rather unorthodox fashion--plenty of soft food, including
table scraps and bits of meat occasionally. Perhaps this is the correct

Events amongst the Penguins at the Edinburgh Zoo are always of
interest. This Zoo has, of course, specialized in the keeping and
breeding of Penguins for many years and, very important, it
invariably publishes the season's results and observations in the Annual
Report . Last year promised to be almost a record, but the final results
proved disappointing. Only three King chicks were hatched from
thirteen eggs, the most likely cause of the poor fertility being lack of
vitamins due to the unavoidable feeding of gutted instead of ungutted
fish during the months the birds were building up for the mating season.
A secondary cause may have been the introduction of new birds.
Thirteen Gentoo Penguin chicks were hatched from twenty-two eggs,
but only five were reared. " The main reduction in numbers was due
to the natural breeding habit of this species which rears only one
chick from the two eggs hatched ; the first chick, two days older than
the second, confiscating all the food regurgitated by the parents, the
second chick surviving only if an accident carries off the first. This
summer it is hoped to decrease the death rate among the younger
chicks by removing the first egg from a nest immediately it is laid and
replacing it with an infertile egg ; then when the second egg has been
laid the infertile one will be taken away and the first egg replaced in
the nest. In this way the incubation of both eggs will begin at the
same time instead of one being two days in advance of the other,
and, as a result, the chicks should hatch together, equally strong and
equally able to take food from the parents."
In the colony of Maccaroni Penguins one chick was hatched but
died as the result of an accident.

ANIMAL DISPERSION IN RELATION TO SOCIAL BE-

HAVIOUR. By V. C. Wynne-Edwards. Oliver and Boyd,
Edinburgh and London, 1962. Price 55^.
This important treatise deals with the methods by which the
numbers and population-densities of animals are controlled and
develops a new theory of animal dispersion. Whilst factual evidence
has been drawn from all groups of the animal kingdom, birds with
their highly developed social behaviour provide much of the material
and a sketch of the theory was published in the Ibis , 1959, v. 101.
The placement of individuals and groups of individuals within the
habitats they occupy and the processes involved are generally taken
for granted and it has remained a largely unappreciated problem.
There is obviously a close adjustment between animals and their
essential resources but the dispersion involved is dependent on very
complex responses, especially in comparatively young and lowly
animals with varying larval stages. A more simple example of quantita-
tive dispersion is illustrated by the population density of pelagic birds
in the North Atlantic which is shown to be correlated with the abun-
dance of plankton. In all animals there seems to be an optimum
density in relation to resources and evidence is presented to support
the view that this favourable balance is maintained by the self-
limitation of animal numbers.
The necessary regulation of the population increase is accomplished
in many different ways such as varying the quota of breeders, the
number of eggs, the resorption of embryos, survival rate of the young,
and so on ; accelerating or retarding growth-rate and maturity ;
limiting the density of colonization or settlement of the habitat ;
ejecting surplus members, and even encompassing deaths to retrieve
the correct balance between population-density and resources. At all
costs population-density must be prevented from rising to the level
where food shortage begins to take a toll on the numbers.
The author provides a wealth of examples of the way this optimum
density is brought about. Most birds have visual recognition signals,
many of which only appear when the bird moves or flies, or deliberately
exposes them. Sound signals are also widely used by birds for intra-
specific communication, involving the establishment of territory, and
in courtship. The chapters on communal nuptial displays and on
display characters and natural selection contain a wealth of examples
provided by birds, including leks in which there is a display of males
primarily directed towards one another, to decide and maintain the
social status of each. Juvenile mortality and the deferment of maturity
are two methods of limiting the numbers of species and in birds,
especially, breeding success on the whole is generally lower in young

adults than in older ones, and the admission of recruits to the breeding
caste is dependent both on social standing and economic conditions.
The book concludes with an interesting discussion on longevity and
it is noted that long life tends to be associated with permanent, ex-
tensive, and stable environments. In the space available it has only
been possible to refer to a few of the many problems discussed by the
author. The origin and behaviour of social behaviour for instance are
seen in a completely new light and the close similarity between man's
social conduct and that of his fellow animals, results in new light being
thrown on the background of human conventional behaviour.

IS GROUNDSEL AN UNDESIRABLE ITEM OF BIRDS' DIET?

We have heard so much recently about the various effects to be derived from
feeding groundsel to our birds as a source of greenfood. Some quarters hold the plant
highly sacred and look upon it as a valuable part of their birds' diet. But there are
others (and I think that they may be in the majority) who would not give the plant
to their birds if it was the last sort of greenfood left on this planet, stating that it has
chemical properties highly detrimental to the creatures' health.
For various reasons I am interested in this subject, and I would like to hear of
readers' views and experiences of feeding this plant to their birds and particularly
details of any casualties in which it is thought that the plant may have been responsible.
Of course, I would still like to hear from bird-keepers who have fed the plant to their
birds for years without noticing any apparent ill-effects.
Such collated information should prove of tremendous interest to fanciers and
may help to clear up any mysticism connected with giving the plant to cage birds.
The information will be incorporated in a work that I am preparing on feeding
birds in captivity.

By Kenton C. Lint (Curator of Birds, San Diego Zoological Garden,
California, U.S.A.)
A pair of Rothschild's Grackles, Leucopsar rothschildi, or White Bali
Mynahs, successfully nested and reared a youngster in the Zoological
Garden of San Diego in 1962.
This beautiful crested Grackle is snow-white in color, with the tail
and wings tipped with black and the face a lovely soft blue. It is
found only on Bali, an Indonesian island of 2,000 square miles located
a little more than one mile from the east coast of Java. Bali is composed
of green rolling grain fields and forests of coco palms, nutmeg, tamarind,
banyan, and other tropical trees.
This bird is loved and widely protected by the Balinese. The White
Bali Mynah seldom is exported from the " Island of the Gods
A special trip to the famous Bogor Botanical Gardens and Institute for
the Conservation of Nature in Indonesia was necessary before special
permits could be issued by T. Maden Taman, Director, Kepala
Lembaga Pengawetan Alam, to allow the exportation of four White
Bali Mynahs from the Surabaja Zoo.
The four Rothschild's Grackles arrived in San Diego on the
13th September, 1961, in splendid condition. After the necessary
quarantine and observation period at the Zoo Hospital the four birds
were released in the Rain Forest aviary. Rocky ledges and nesting
crevices have been designed for nesting in the upper area of this aviary.
Webster Tyrrell, Bird Keeper in the Rain Forest, was encouraged to
work with the new acquisitions, particularly to stimulate nesting
activities. Building materials, grasses, small sticks, feathers, leaves, and
pieces of colored yarn were brought into the aviary for building nests.
Keeper Tyrrell soon observed that a pair had found a nesting hole in
the upper part of the flight cage and were busy carrying nesting
material. Both male and female Grackles worked in building and
lining the nest as a team effort. The depth of the nesting site and the
small opening at the entrance prevented the keeper from seeing the
clutch of eggs inside the nest.
We were able to determine the approximate dates of egg laying, as

the hen would disappear into the nesting hole when laying and the
male bird would guard the nesting area or territory. From February
to June the hen laid five times. As the normal clutch of eggs is said to
number three, this would be fifteen eggs produced in a five-month
period.
Persistence is important in breeding birds. Disappointments are
expected when raising insectivorous birds. In February eggs were laid
but soon disappeared. In March the second nest was made, eggs were
laid and again disappeared. In April the third nest was made and
nestlings hatched, but they were deserted when a few days old.
In May the fourth nest was completed, but again the nestlings were
deserted at an early age.
The pair's fifth attempt this year proved to be successful. Because
of close observations of the pair we believe the first egg was laid on
the 6th June, the second on the 7th, and the third on the 8th.
On the 22 nd June both of our Bali Mynahs met the keeper at the
entrance door of the aviary, and Webster Tyrrell knew their young
had hatched. An incubation period of fourteen days had been verified
for this species. Mealworms were fed immediately to the parents, and
both male and female birds would pick up five to six mealworms at a
time before carrying this food to the nestlings.
The birds were placed on a definite hourly feeding schedule of
insectivorous food during each eight-hour day. We could hear the
nestlings at feeding time, as they are quite noisy in begging for food ;
and we continued to provide a liberal supply of insects.
Fresh ground meat, earthworms, cockroaches, berries, fruit, and
bread were offered to the parent birds during the nesting cycle by
Keeper Tyrrell. All were rejected and untouched by them as
unsuitable for the nestlings.
Only mealworms were carried to the nest and fed to the young birds.
One hundred and fifty to two hundred mealworms were consumed by
the nestlings each day. As the youngsters grew in size the quantity of
insectivorous food also was increased day by day.
The first young Bali Mynah came out of the nest on nth July at
the age of twenty days. Almost fully fledged and two-thirds the size
of the parent bird, the young bird is almost an exact miniature of the
adult, except for being slightly paler in color. The silky crest is not
developed at this early age. The soft blue face patch around the eye,
the black tipped tail, the black wing tips and the rest of the plumage,
however, are identical with the adult birds.
It is believed this may be the first breeding record of the Rothschild's
Grackle in captivity in the United States. A search of the literature
discloses one record in Great Britain--Rothschild's Grackle, Leucopsar
rothschildi, bred by Alfred Ezra in 1931, one young bird reared :
a first (. AM ., 1931, 305).

(Calliope calliope (Pallas) )
By Mrs. K. M. Scamell, (Newdigate, Surrey, England)
The Rubythroat, sometimes referred to as the Common Rubythroat
to differentiate it from the Himalayan Rubythroat ( Calliope pec tor alls
(Gould) ), is also called the Chinese Rubythroat and perhaps more
correctly Siberian Rubythroat and it is so called in Gould's Birds of
Asia and other reference books such as South China Birds by Caldwell
and Caldwell. It is a winter visitor to Formosa, the Philippines and
north-east India and it is from the latter country that the bird is
usually imported into the U.K. It breeds in north-west China, in
Siberia and other areas of northern Asia. The upper plumage of the
male Rubythroat is olive-brown, the wings and tail brown, with the
wings edged a lighter brown than the back. There is a superciliary
stripe from the base of the bill to behind the eye and a broad
white molar stripe. On the chin and throat is a brilliant patch of
ruby-scarlet, bordered with black. The breast is a lightish grey and
the abdomen and under tail-coverts whitish. The hen is similar to the
male except the white stripes are indistinct and the throat normally
whitish. Young cocks are similar to the normal hen but on moulting
show the adult male plumage even though the throat patch has less
red. In Birds of Eastern China (La Touche) it is said that old females
do show faded red throat patches and some have it as well developed
as young males. Provided these birds have proper feeding and can
be housed in a planted aviary in summer, it is my experience there
should be no fading of the throat patch with age.
My first cock Rubythroat was obtained from Mr. Raymond Sawyer
immediately after the January 1957 National Show where it was first
in its class. It had then been in captivity about a year. It was a lovely
bird, very tame and knowing and on the many occasions I exhibited it
subsequently it invariably stood close to the cage front and " invited "
the judge (so I have been told) to give it a red ticket ! Over the years
I purchased " three hens " in the hope that it would breed. The first
two moulted out cocks and thus another summer would be wasted and
I would have to dispose of the unwanted extras.
The third hen was purchased from Mr. Dineen of Colliers Wood in
the winter of 1960 and was turned out with the old cock in the spring
of 1961 in its usual aviary which has a planted flight 15 feet long x 6 feet
high X 3 ft. 6 in. wide, with a shelter heated to ensure the night
temperature did not fall below about 40* F. Ruby throats are hardy,
however, but all the same I believe all foreign birds require some heat
during the long cold winter nights in this country. The old cock Ruby-
throat, however, had been showing signs of age and to my deep regret
did not survive a late summer moult although it retained its scarlet

throat patch to the end. No breeding had occurred although at times
the hen disappeared for long periods beneath some old tree stumps in
the heavily grassed aviary and I would feel certain it was nesting some-
where. The hen moulted out a hen, the first I had seen, so this winter
(1961-62) we bought another cock Rubythroat. It was selected from
an importation Mr. Dineen had just received and although rough in
feather and as wild as our first cock was tame, it was a fine specimen.
The hen spent the winter in the usual aviary and shelter which she
shared with a pair of Golden-fronted Fruit-suckers, a seven-year-old
cock Scarlet-breasted Sunbird, a pair of Ixulas and a pair of Zosterops.
She had become very tame and it was a battle of wits between her and
the Fruit-suckers for the daily ration of mealworms.
The new cock Rubythroat, now in better plumage and with a scarlet
throat patch which almost equalled that of his predecessor, was released
from his cage into the aviary in late April and quickly settled down.
He was, and is, a shy bird and both appeared to ignore one another.
No sparring, even at mealworm time, has ever been seen between them.
We replaced the old tree stumps half-way up the planted aviary with
one large one and to this we nailed a nest-box with a half-open front
facing north-west and only about 6 inches above the ground. I made
a point of always placing the mealworm ration for the Rubythroats
under the stump--it ensured that they had their share otherwise the
Fruit-suckers and Ixulas would wolf the lot. Consequently the Ruby-
throats looked upon the stump as their territory.
On the morning of 16th June I observed the hen pulling at grass.
She would heave until on occasions she fell over backwards ! All this
occurred within a few feet of us. The hen was quite unconcerned at
our presence and the grass was taken by her to the nest-box. I then
decided to remove the pair of Fruit-suckers to another aviary and threw
in several handfuls of new grass in the hope of easing the Rubythroat's
nest-building task which seemed to be completed by the next day.
For the next three days I kept clear of the nest-box but on the 21st
placed my hand inside to feel three or four eggs in a deep grass cup--
too far down to risk lifting one egg out. I did not examine the nest
again until the 27th June when I felt either four or five eggs. All this
time I placed a food pot under the tree stump.
Late in the afternoon of the 3rd July I felt in the nest again--still
the eggs--but at 8 a.m. the following morning there was one youngster
and by 5 p.m. that day there were two more plus one egg, so the total
eggs must have been four.
Throughout the day I fed a few clear mealworms at intervals. All
during the incubation period the cock bird was hardly to be seen and
when it was it perched in a small cherry tree over the stump. It sang
frequently during incubation by the hen but I cannot recall it doing
so after the young hatched.

I searched for ants' eggs but without success so on the evening
of 4th July Mr. M. D. England of Oxted kindly gave us a supply of
locusts and " little " mealworms and some of these were supplied to
the hen Ruby throat over the next two days. The locusts quickly dis-
appeared from sight and I can only assume she caught them but the
" little " mealworms were much appreciated and fed to the young. At
no time did I see the cock feed the young birds. The hen was com-
pletely tame. I continued to pick over my diminishing supply of
normal mealworms for the clear ones and placed what I could of these
in the dish under the stump and when it rained, in a dish in the shelter.
Mealworms were getting short, due to the German supplies almost
drying up and although Mr. Coombs of Walderslade let me have what
he could and I obtained an odd \ lb. from dealers and friends here and
there, it began to look as if I should run out.
I had three other species of soft-bills with young birds at the time,
including a clutch of three Blue-headed Rock Thrushes which alone
consumed about J lb. of mealworms a day.
It rained heavily for the second successive day on Saturday, 14th
July, and the next afternoon I noticed the parent flying about in an
excited fashion from end to end of the flight. I made a search and
found two young Ruby throats lying outside the nest. They were soaked
and had been dead some hours. I felt inside the nest. There was still
one youngster alive--it was warm and seemed larger than either of the
two dead fledglings. I cannot think what caused this to happen. There
was no actual shortage of normal mealworms which with gentles had
been fed ad lib. even although clear mealworms were not always
available.
The next day, Monday, 16th July, the one remaining youngster left
the nest. It seemed to me premature and I returned it three times but
it did not remain inside very long, which is usual once a soft-bill decides
to leave home, even although it was barely thirteen days old. The
young bird had long, light-coloured legs out of all proportion to its
roundish short-tailed speckled and barred grey and brown body. Both
the parents now played up each time I entered the flight, indulging in
considerable " tchek tcheks ", repeated again and again.
The young bird slept out in the grass that night and the following
night was seen at the base of a small privet at dark when it was raining
heavily. It was only seen to be fed by the hen. On Friday, 20th July,
it was raining heavily again and the young bird was placed inside the
shelter for the night. The next day it was seen to make short, scrambling
flights, then climbing up the netting, it flew into the flight.
From that time although it is seen mostly on the ground, as are most
Rubythroats, it could fly quite well but was not seen high up. The
hen Rubythroat was now in a heavy moult and as this started when
the two dead fledglings were found, I wondered if this had any bearing

on their death. During the last week in July the cock started to moult
also and on 5th August had no tail and looked generally bedraggled.
During the last week the young Rubythroat has been flying well and
feeding from the food dish containing my usual soft-food, gentles and
mealworms morning and night. On 7th August I watched for over an
hour during which time both parents and the young bird helped
themselves to the live food in the dish ; on two occasions the young
bird " gaped " to the hen who made no attempt to feed it. The young
bird did not seem too concerned at the refusal and fed from the
contents of the food pot. It has grown substantially during the last
week and its tail is now full length. Its spots and bars seem to be
slowly disappearing or merging but as yet there is no indication of its
sex.
As described above, Mrs. K. M. Scamell has bred the Rubythroat,
Calliope calliope . It is believed that this may be a first success.
Any member or reader knowing of a previous breeding of this species
in Great Britain or Northern Ireland is requested to communicate at

THE BREEDING OF THE HIMALAYAN
RUBYTHROAT
[Calliope pectoralis (Gould))
By Mrs. K. M. Scamell (Newdigate, Surrey, England)
The Himalayan Rubythroat is similar in size to the Common or
Siberian Rubythroat ( Calliope calliope (Pallas)) but is is of more slender
</table>
<bodyText confidence="0.997032714285714" page_id="56317201"  page_num="158" year="" vol="">
build and very different in appearance. The chin and throat are
bright crimson, deeply bordered with black, but here the resemblance
to C. calliope ceases. The head and upper parts are ashy-slate and the
forehead is white. There is no white superciliary streak. The abdomen
is white and the base and top of the tail feathers are also white. The
female is olive-brown above and the chin and throat are whitish.
As its name implies C. pectoralis breeds throughout the Himalayas.
In Breeding Birds of Kashmir (Bates and Lowther) the lowest altitude
nesting which had been observed by the authors was 10,000 feet
although other writers had recorded breedings down to 9,000 feet.
Salim Ali in Indian Hill Birds says : " It is an inhabitant of steep rocky
and grassy slopes at high elevations, in the zone above the level of tree
growth and just below the snow. It also frequents rocky hillside with
juniper. ..." In winter the bird descends into the foothills to about

3,000 feet although a few may reach the nearby plains. In movement
and behaviour the Bluethroat, the Rubythroat and the Himalayan
Rubythroat have much in common, but from my experience in keeping
all these species, I would say the Himalayan bird is more prone to fly
upwards when approached whereas the two former birds will scuttle
along the ground.
Our pair of Himalayan Rubythroats were purchased from
Mr. P. H. Hastings of Portsmouth in the late summer of i960. They
were stated to have been caged together for some months. After they
moulted we showed them at the i960 National Show when the cock set
about the hen and we had to separate them. He was placed seventh
in the class. It sometimes happens that a change of surroundings brings
out the worst in man and bird !
After separately caging all the winter we turned them out into a
planted aviary in the spring of 1961, first the hen for three or four days,
then the cock. This is the reverse of what normally occurs in many
migrating birds when the cocks arrive before the hens. I find that in
captivity it is the hen who requires time to get her bearings and find
the food pot before the cock arrives and I have yet to lose a hen when
introducing a pair this way.
The aviary measured 16 feet in length x 4 ft. 3 in. in width X 7 ft. 6 in.
in height. At one end is a raised shelter and near to it is an old
and substantial cut down hazel-nut bush. The flight was grassed and
planted with a prunus at the far end from the shelter where there is a
side entrance, also a rhododendron and a Russian ivy--in fact it is a
difficult aviary to see into, particularly as it has four other similar
aviaries on one side of it and two on the other. I feed through a little
hatch into the shelter and there is a water pot at the other end. I do
not need, therefore, to enter the flight to either feed or water. We
fixed an open-fronted nest box measuring about 8x9x8 inches deep
right in the middle of the hazel-nut bush about 18 inches off the ground,
and facing west--a position which gave the greatest privacy. Hazel
comes into leaf rather slowly and it seemed that our pair would never
attempt breeding.
About the middle of June the cock Himalayan Rubythroat commenced
to sing very beautifully from a branch of the prunus, remote from the
shelter and the hazel bush. On the 18th June I placed my hand in the
nest box and there was evidence of nest building. On the 22nd June
there were two eggs in a deep cup--on the 24th still two eggs and these
were cold. I had a look at them--they were deep blue, almost a Wedge-
wood blue. On the 25th June my diary recorded " Himalayan Ruby-
throat hen sitting again ". On the 30th June there were three eggs and
I diarized that the first egg was due to hatch about the 6th July. The
forecast could not have been much further out and as I made a daily
inspection in the jungle of this overplanted aviary, I wondered if the

eggs were addled. On the 14th July there was still no sign of hatching
but at g a.m. next day (i.e. the sixteenth day after the third egg had
been seen) there was a young Ruby throat in the nest. I fed ants' eggs
and mealworms at intervals. On the morning of the 16th July the baby
Rubythroat was found lying dead near the water pot 10 feet from the
nest. There was only one egg still in the nest and I removed this ; it
was clear. What a disappointment. Shortly afterwards the hen started
to moult, followed by the cock and that was the end of the breeding
of this species in 1961.
We showed the pair once or twice, including the 1961 National and
they were fourth in their class. On this occasion they agreed perfectly.
This spring we decided to place them in another aviary, one measuring
6x6x3 feet--much smaller than the previous one. Even so, it was
heavily planted and contained a tree stump to which we nailed the
usual open-fronted nest box. It was a hopeless situation--every time
one neared the flight the birds were disturbed and I began to think
about returning them to last year's aviary which was empty and more
overgrown than ever.
About this time (16th June) the Common or Siberian Rubythroats
had started to nest in their aviary which contained a mixed collection
of birds, including a pair of aggressive Fruit-suckers. Our mind was
made up for us--out went the Himalayan Rubythroats to their old 16-ft.
aviary and in went the Fruit-suckers into the smaller aviary where,
incidentally, they seem quite happy although we have long ago given
up any idea of them breeding.
Both Himalayan Rubythroats promptly disappeared from our sight
but in a few days the cock was again singing from his old perch in the
prunus tree. The hen was never seen unless I entered the flight, yet
there was no sign of any nest building in the nest-box. At this stage
I decided that other than a weekly visit to the nest-box, I would leave
the birds severely alone. The cock continued its singing and the hen
was always missing. On the 27th June I recorded " no sign of nesting
in last year's nest-box ", I did not see the hen Himalayan Rubythroat
at all on the 4th and 5th July. On the 8th July the nest-box was
examined but no nesting had been attempted. I did, however, flush
the hen from the base of the hazel tree which I could not reach because
of the heavy growth and the risk of disturbing a possible nest. The
grass was very thick and tall in the flight so I decided to leave well
alone.
On the 15th July, after two days without seeing the hen, I felt fairly
certain the bird was incubating and to ensure that there was ample
live food I fed normal mealworms several times a day from then
onwards--gentles were always available and also fed a mass of cooked
ant-eggs mixed with pine needles which a visitor had kindly left.
Consumption of mealworms was not unduly high but steady. These

birds have never been very greedy but I was now very sure that some
young were hatched even although the precise nesting place was
uncertain. Remembering last year's failure I did not intend to disturb
them and when on the 20th July I saw the Himalayan hen she had
the rough appearance of a parent busy feeding. Mealworm con-
sumption increased.
On the 29th July we both got a fleeting glimpse of a young bird
before it disappeared under the hazel bush. We could not stay too long
because in an adjacent aviary was a hen, Red-flanked Bush Robin,
sitting on three very coffee coloured eggs. The only other birds in
that aviary were a pair of Cockatiels, also on eggs, a hen Tickell's
Flycatcher and a cock Loo-choo Robin.
We decided not to linger in case a hybrid breeding was in the offing.
Two days afterwards (31st July) I saw a young Himalayan Rubythroat
flying strongly. It was fully feathered, its tail much longer than was the
case with a young Common Rubythroat. Like its parents, it preferred
the upper branches of the hazel bush to running along the ground. The
hen was in quite a moult but the cock had not dropped a feather.
One evening later we found the Red-flanked Bush Robin's nest
deserted in the adjacent aviary and the three brown eggs gone, so we
made a thorough search of the Himalayan Rubythroat flight and
found a neat grass cup on the ground under a tuft of grass. It was damp
and contained one blue egg which was addled and slightly chipped.
It was located under the rhododendron bush which had been in full
flower probably during the time of its construction and during the
incubation period. It was nearly 6 feet from the hazel bush where we
mistakenly thought the hen had her nest. How I had missed treading
on this tuft of grass during my frequent visits to this narrow aviary,
I shall never know. Never once did I disturb the bird from its nest,
not even when I sprayed water on a newly planted Russian ivy only
a few feet from the tuft of grass. It may be, of course, it had always
left before I arrived and was hidden in the hazel bush.
At the time of writing, 15th August, the young bird is feeding itself
and is independent of its parents. All three birds are often together on
one perch and the youngster is as large as the hen. In colouring it is
brown with the head, chest and back speckled. In front the speckles
merge into lightish under parts. The wings and tail are a deeper brown
with a few lighter spots and the base of the tail has a small rufous patch.
The legs are flesh colour.
As described, Mrs. K. M. Scamell has bred the Himalayan Ruby-
throat Calliope pectoralis. It is believed that this may be a first success.

The male chat which is about 5 inches in length is jet black all over,
including bill and legs, except for three white areas, one at the base
of the tail, the lower abdomen and a broad wing patch.
The female is brown, deeper on the wings, tail and breast. The
rump is a pale rufous colour. According to the reference books, at least
three races are found throughout the Himalayas up to 8,000 feet and
on the plains and lower hills in open country. Differences between
them depend on the size of the bill or wing, or the extent of the white
on the under parts of the cock bird. The Pied Bush Ghat is said to
occur also in Afghanistan, Persia, Burma, the Philippines and Java.
Our pair came from India and were purchased from Mr. Dineen of
Colliers Wood in the winter of 1960-61. I seem to recall quite a number
came over at the same time and our pair was at first caged separately
and then turned out into an aviary with a shelter in the late spring of
1961. The cock was reasonably steady but the hen very wild and is so
to this day. They were separately caged again last winter and this
spring were turned out into an aviary measuring 11 feet long x 6 feet
wide X 5 ft. 9 in. high, including a shelter at one end. This shelter
has a concrete floor and the aviary is in a small wood. Besides the chats
it houses a pair of Golden-winged Sunbirds, a pair of Diamond Doves
and two Webb's Crow Tits, both believed to be cocks. One of them
was originally paired to a hen which nested and produced eggs two
years ago but we unfortunately lost her egg bound.
In the planted flight we laid a large tree stump on its side and nailed
a half open-fronted nest-box to it a few inches off the ground as these
chats are reputed to nest in hollows, on the ground or almost so, or in
crevices or holes in stone walls etc., or in the face of banks. The bird
is, however, stated to be a ground builder which conceals its nest very
well. In addition to this nest-box, there were several others, both open
fronted and one with an entrance hole in the flight, at roof height or
below, and two cardboard boxes (i.e. of the type used for dispatching
birds) in the shelter--one 4 ft. 6 in. high, facing south, and the other
5 ft. 6 in. high, facing north. All boxes had a handful of grass inserted.
The shelter was very gloomy even although it was fitted with a large
opening window on the north side. Because of the trees the sun did
not penetrate too well. The flight contained a newly planted Russian
ivy, a thornless rose and a couple of mock currant bushes. As the spring
advanced it was carpeted with bluebells, followed by bracken.
From time to time I had a quick look at the various nest-boxes but
there was no sign of nesting. Moreover I always saw the birds although

K. M. SCAMELL BREEDING OF THE PIED BUSH CHAT 1 63
this is not always a sign that birds are not nesting, particularly as this
aviary was next to the end of a range of about twenty of various shapes
and sizes--hence the birds could always hear one approaching.
On Saturday, gth June, in an adjacent aviary I picked up a hen
Shama which had just laid an egg which was broken. Although she
was placed in a hospital cage and given brandy, she was badly shocked
and did not recover. In the Shamas nest was an egg which my husband
took and decided to place in some other softbill's nest. First, he ex-
amined the nest-boxes in the adjacent Bush Chat's aviary and to his
surprise found a single warm egg in a deep grass cup in one of the two
cardboard boxes in the semi-dark shelter, the box facing south.
Wondering whether the egg belonged to the Crow Tits (which also use
a cup-shaped nest) or the Pied Bush Chats which should not nest in
such a site according to the text books, he carefully removed the single
egg and broke it ! This was bad enough if the egg was the first of a
clutch. The broken egg, however, contained a young bird almost
ready for hatching and that was that ! The Shama's egg (which,
incidentally, is really quite small for the size of the bird) was inserted
and we came away hoping we should be forgiven !
A week later I examined the nest again and the Shama's egg had
disappeared, the nest was empty and the hen Pied Bush Chat was
flying about as wild as ever. Our breeding hopes had now reached
zero.
On the 23rd June, however, there was a single egg in the nest and
on the 27th June there was a second egg so we were indeed forgiven.
On the 7th July at 9 a.m. there was only one egg in the nest but at
11 a.m. I decided to go and have another look because it should have
hatched and sure enough there was a young chick. I immediately fed
clear skinned and normal mealworms, a dish inside and outside the
shelter. With the competition from the Crow Tits it was essential they
should not be kept short. It had not been possible to catch the Crow
Tits and remove them elsewhere. They were far too lively and I did
not want to upset the Bush Chat.
In the wild state the Bush Chat is stated to lay three or four eggs and
somehow I cannot believe it laid just one in the first clutch. It is
likely one, or more, hatched earlier and died because of the lack of
suitable live food due to the Crow Tits. The second egg in the second
clutch may also have hatched a day or two earlier and the youngster
may have met the same fate.
For the next fortnight I fed ample mealworms, soft skinned or other-
wise, and a few live ants' eggs when I could find them. On the 15th
July I decided to have a look at the youngster--it was quite small and
partly fledged. During the week I poured a mass of pine needles and
cooked ants' eggs, which a visitor had kindly given me, onto the concrete
floor of the shelter as I feared the bird might leave the nest and injure

itself on the floor. In spite of every encouragement from me
(I examined the nest twice a day !) the bird did not leave the nest until
about 3 p.m. on the 22nd July, the sixteenth day after hatching--quite
a while for a singleton.
It was perfectly feathered with a full tail, the long chat-like legs of
its parents and a white rim around the mouth. The behaviour of the
parents had changed and from timid birds they became most noisy
and aggressive. The male bird spread his wings and with pointed beak
adopted a threatening attitude when I refilled the food pot. When
I entered the shelter it came in through the pop-hole--the first time
we had ever been in the shelter together ! The young bird quickly
found its way outside and, as the days went by, hid in all sorts of places.
The noise and behaviour of the parents, however, generally led me to
it. I caught it by hand on the netting on 5th August.
In colour it is a smokey brown, barred and spotted, and darker on
the wings and with a tail almost black--grey-black would be a better
description--and with a lighter almost fawn bar across each wing.
The abdomen was also lighter. I am pretty sure it is a cock. On
release it perched steadily and fearlessly, as it always did, and waited
for both its parents to feed it. Although we both watched it for an hour
from a concealed point, it made no attempt to feed itself. The parents
do not fuss so much now so I think it will be independent before long.
Throughout the incubation period and before it, the cock sang con-
tinuously. It has a very pretty song. I saw no interference with or
by the Webb's Crow Tits who must have indulged in an excessive meal-
worm diet throughout the rearing period. I do not believe in too many
mealworms except when breeding so I hope they do not come to any
harm. The Sunbirds ignored everybody. The Diamond Doves were
removed to another aviary the day the first egg was broken.
On 12th August, just three weeks after it left the nest, continuous
observation showed it could feed itself and its parents had ceased to
feed it. The marking around the mouth is disappearing and the scale-
like appearance which was so noticeable at first is lessening.
As described, Mrs. K. M. Seamell has bred the Pied Bush Chat
Saxicola caprata. It is believed that this may be a first success.

By J. Delacour (Cleres, France)
The spring and early summer of this year have been unusually cold
and dry. Vegetation was a good month late compared to a normal
season, and this was extremely detrimental to the breeding of birds.
Many simply did not come into breeding condition, and others laid
only when the summer was well on, which means that their young will
hardly have the time to develop before the autumn arrives. This has
been particularly true of the Rheas ; the first broods hatched in July
and the second in September. We have quite a few chicks however,
including white ones.
The Emus we now have are most annoying : the female will not
accept any of three males ; whenever one is introduced into her pen,
she gives him such a beating that he has to be promptly rescued. So
there is no hope of broods. We have found that Emus are impossible
at liberty in the park as, sooner or later, they will attack and kill, or
wound, young deer, antelopes and wallabies, cranes, geese and ducks.
Curiously enough they completely ignore pheasants, peafowls and other
game birds which enter their enclosures. Rheas, on the contrary, are
completely harmless to all animals and birds. The breeding pair of
Stanley Cranes lost their first two young as usual although they now
live in the deer park, on the slopes. The second nest was mysteriously
robbed ; then the female broke her leg, which is now on the mend.
Among the swans, geese and ducks, relatively few bred successfully
this year. Crows, Magpies and Jackdaws have been a real nuisance
in the spring. We however have six young Orinoco geese, four Australian
Radjahs (from the last pair in Europe at present), some Hawaian
ducks and Versicolor Teal, and half-a-dozen hybrid Brazilian Teal X
Carolina. As I consider the two species to be closely related, it will
be interesting to see if their offspring is fertile, and therefore con-
firm my opinion. Although the males are not yet in breeding plumage,
I hope they may turn out to be beautiful. The juveniles resemble their
Brazilian father more than their mother.
Pheasants were very disappointing : we had no Mikados, Tragopans,
Ceylon Junglefowl nor White Eared Pheasants. But a pair of Grey
Peacock Pheasants produced four lots of chicks and a pair of Brazilian
Curassows, two pairs. The doves were especially disturbed by the cold
weather and started breeding very late. There are young Galapagos,
Greenwings, Common and Brush Bronze-wings, Wongas, Bleeding-
hearts, Red Mountain and Caniceps, and a few other common species
were reared, but not as many as could be expected. A pair of Indian
Cuckoo Doves have been added to the collection (Macropygia unchall).
In the park, the Brush Turkeys built a puny pile of leaves and never
laid, another probable result of the cold spring and early summer.

The various indoor and outdoor aviaries are well stocked, and we
had very few losses of the birds which were there last year. The most
attractive additions have been five European Bee-eaters, hand reared
from the nest. They are tame, they eat strips of lightly cooked meat,
insect mixture and grated carrots, with only a few mealworms a day ;
they are in perfect condition, inhabiting a large indoor flight. There
is also an interesting pair of Yellow-crowned Mynahs (.Ampeliceps
coronatus ) and some Rothschild's Starlings.
I am now making a new duck enclosure across the road, where there
are already a number of waterfowl pens along the river. Next to it will
be a water garden. This area is not visited by the public, and the
new garden will be enjoyed by creatures who appreciate quiet, peace,
seclusion, and privacy. These include the owner of Cleres and his
personal guests.

HOODED MERGANSERS

By Robert A. Copley, (Hemingford Grey, Hunts., England)
In 1959 two pairs were obtained from Charles Pilling of Seattle,
U.S.A. The following year one female died mysteriously. No cause
of death could be found. The disease affected the vent, which had
obviously been inflated and then deflated.
In 1961 a further female was provided from Seattle. Up to this
time the Mergansers had been confined to water which was part of a lake,
but thought to be rather stagnant. Late in i960 they were released into
the complete lake of about 5J acres, with plenty of fish in it and plenty
of fresh water. Some fifty other birds were in the same lake.
In March 1962, two round eggs were found in a Mandarin's nest.
In April these eggs hatched out under a bantam, having been sat on
for a fortnight by the Mandarin. It was quite a surprise to find
among them the little sharp face of a Merganser. This bird was
promptly isolated with two Mandarins and given to one reliable
bantam, and feeding commenced with bread-and-milk through an eye
dropper. Very quickly the little Merganser started taking bread-and-
milk and crumbs. When called it would come away from its
mother for the purpose of being fed. It was feeding well on the third
day. After it had been feeding for ten days it suddenly appeared very
listless, and died in a few hours.
Look-out was kept for other Merganser eggs, and it was discovered
that one of the female Mergansers was laying in one particular nest,
a box in a tree, and that she had started to sit on eight eggs. They were
not interfered with for a fortnight, until she was discovered off the nest.
The eggs were then hastily removed and tested, when they all appeared

to be clear. They were then put back in the nest, and the Merganser
continued sitting on them.
A second Merganser was also seen going into another tree-box, and
began to lay round eggs which were nearly twice the size of the
previous bird's eggs, and it was anticipated that they might be fertile.
About ten days or a fortnight later the first Merganser was found
to be off her nest, and some of the eggs were tested in warm water,
and a few of them proved obviously alive. A good bantam was selected
and the eggs placed under her. In about five or six days' time four
Mergansers were hatching, but one died in the shell. One of the three
died soon after birth, leaving two.
The countryside had been scoured for maggots, and it was only just
before the Mergansers were hatched that the maggots arrived. The
two Mergansers were put with two Mandarins and two bantam chicks
with one good bantam hen. The maggots were fed to the little birds, on
a clean paint brush and they made successful attempts in taking the
maggot off the brush, provided the brush was held over their heads.
It was noticed that they were going to the bantam's head and trying
to get something from her beak. It occurred to the writer that possibly
these little Mergansers are fed by the mother for quite a period of time
at birth.
Clean pieces of brown paper were placed on the floor, and maggots
were scattered over them. The bantam chick soon started to show
what should be done, the Mandarins then followed. In five days' time
the Mergansers did not require feeding any longer with a brush, they
were picking up the maggots from the brown paper.
A further effort was made, and maggots were raised from dead fish.
The Mergansers did not seem to make any demur in eating them, and
in the early stages of their life they had quite a number of maggots
produced from fish and also maggots from meat. Further precaution
was taken in that the maggots which came from the meat were put
into fish meal and sand so that when eating them the birds also got
fish meal and sand. Quite a lot of sand was eaten by the Mergansers
in this way. The birds proved to be very tame and would come
when called.
At the same time that this was happening some green eggs were
found in the boxes, and carefully set on one side. These proved to be
Goldeneye, and four Goldeneye were hatched. Two were found dead
in the shell and one died later. The three Goldeneye were soon put with
the Mergansers, and they must have eaten many pounds of maggots
between them. A pint of maggots seemed to disappear in a few days.
They also very much enjoyed bread-and-milk and fish meal, and are
now eating ordinary pellets and corn as well. The two Mergansers
are now six months old and are in the main lake with their
parents.

To revert to the second lot of large eggs which were laid, these
proved to be mainly infertile, though some fertile eggs did not i
mature.
It has been suggested to the writer that this is the first time that
Hooded Mergansers. have been hatched in Europe. I do not know ,
whether this is so or not.
If anybody wishes to see them it is quite easy to inspect the birds,
because they will come up when called, and they appear to be in
splendid health.

<bodyText confidence="0.998914766666667" page_id="56317211"  page_num="168" year="" vol="">
By J. O. D'eath, (Hadley, Herts., England)
For upwards of ten years now, a small colony of Eiders (Somateria
mollissima ) has been one of the outstanding features of the large water-
fowl collection here ( Avicult . Mag ., vol. 64, no. 6, pp. 169-173). There
are now five breeding pairs which normally lay two clutches of eggs.
Last year sixteen young Eiders were reared from our own eggs. In
accordance with my usual practice a young pair was retained for the
purpose of illustrating to visitors the plumage transition between first,
second and third year drakes ; the male bird of course only reaching
full adult plumage in its third year.
It has been customary to operate several traps for Sparrows (Passer
domesticus) at the main feeding point in the collection as these pests
consume a large quantity of grain throughout the year. Normally
these Sparrows are dispatched and are left at the foot of a tree pending
final disposal.
During the hard weather after Christmas 1962 the waterfowl keeper
noticed the dead sparrows were disappearing from time to time. This
was reported to me and an attempt was made to solve the mystery. It
was naturally assumed that some form of predator was at work. Careful
observation was then kept and to my astonishment a young Eider drake
was seen to leave the water, cross the island, seize a dead sparrow and
return to the water with it.
On reaching the water, the Eider proceeded to immerse the sparrow
several times and then deftly swallow it head first. It's appetite
apparently not sated it then repeated the performance again. Subse-
quently, no attempts were made to encourage this bird's carnivorous
tendencies but at fairly regular intervals it helped itself to dead sparrows.
On 6th August, I was inspecting the collection and drew the attention
of the waterfowl keeper to a pair of Moorhens (Gallinula chloropus) and
instructed him to eliminate them as soon as possible. It is, of course,

generally known that these birds must be treated as vermin in well-
managed waterfowl collections owing to their predeliction for duck
eggs. At that moment three newly hatched Moorhen chicks were seen
making for an overhanging oak tree. The Eider drake already referred
to was with the main group of Eiders in the centre of the pond about
twenty-five yards distant. It immediately detached itself and swam
vigorously towards the Moorhen chicks. On reaching them it seized
one and swam away again, all the time vigorously shaking the unfortu-
nate victim. Having done this for about two minutes it promptly
swallowed the chick. Without further ado the Eider repeated its tactics
but this time it was subject to frenzied attacks by the two parent Moor-
hens. These were of no avail and in spite of the second chick submerging,
the Eider doing likewise, it eventually suffered the same fate as its
predecessor.
The occurrences recorded above may give food for thought to
students of bird behaviour.
In my long experience with waterfowl I have never encountered
carnivorous tendencies in the family Anatidae .
However, the drake Eider, the subject of this note, will serve a useful
purpose in the control of one form of vermin, but at the same time a
watch will have to be kept to see that its tastes do not extend to the
young ducklings of rare species.

NEW EFFORTS IN BREEDING THE GREAT
BUSTARD

It seems that up to now there has never been a success in breeding
the Great Bustard in captivity. Only Quintin (see also Moody) once
reported in this Magazine about a fertile egg laid in his enclosure. But
the chick which was hatched soon died. Althammer's report about the
alleged breeding of the Great Bustard deserves no attention because of
apparently false statements.
I have studied these birds very thoroughly for more than twelve
years. I have reared a considerable number of Great Bustards from
eggs found in the wild and some of these birds are still alive after more
than ten years in captivity. The hens mature at four and the cocks at
five to six years of age.
When I took up my post at the Berlin Zoo (West) I removed my
small flock of Great Bustards there too, but unfortunately in doing so
I lost my nearly mature Bustard cock. Luckily Director Dr. Klos

succeeded in importing a new three-year-old cock as well as a further
hen. In 1961 all twenty-five eggs laid were infertile, but during the
1962 breeding season at least four eggs proved fertile. In one egg the
embryo unfortunately perished shortly before hatching, but after a
period of incubation of between twenty-two and twenty-five days the
three others resulted in three apparently vigorous chicks. Their
weight was a little less than that of chicks hatched in the wild, and in
spite of most attentive care it was impossible to keep them alive more
than five days.
So though success was not quite achieved a good beginning apparently
seems to have been made and we hope that the results in the next
breeding season will be still better.

A NESTING OF THE KEY-WEST QUAIL DOVE :
THIRD REPORT
By Professor Carl Naether (Encino, California)
</figure>
<bodyText confidence="0.978258125" page_id="56317213"  page_num="170" year="" vol="">
Since the time of my last, the second, report on the nesting of a pair
of Key-West Quail or Golden Doves ( Geotrygon chrysia ) which species
I have not had the satisfaction of keeping and studying before, these
sleek, handsome birds have been very busy indeed. Their repeated
laying of cream-coloured eggs and their subsequent practice of covering
them over with fresh nesting materials, which brought no tangible
results of any kind, annoyed me. I therefore resorted to the stratagem,
at times quite effective with captive wild doves and pigeons, of changing
their environment : I simply transferred them to another pen, where
again they had the company of small softbills, but no other doves.
It was but three days following this transfer that I found the male
sitting in an open-top box far back in the shelter, flitting his wing-tips
and calling to his mate almost the whole day long. Since the nest-site
was large enough to permit both, male and female, to " indulge 55 in
their old habit of sitting at times side by side during incubation, each
one on one egg, which habit I wanted very much to discourage, I placed

an enamel bowl in the box which was just big enough to accommodate
one bird at a sitting, and which was readily accepted. However, when
during incubation the time came for the male to take over, about 9.30
in the morning, his mate refused to leave the nest, with the result that
both birds sat for over an hour--the hen on the eggs and the cock on
the hen !
At any rate, this clutch of eggs was not in any way spoiled by
sporadic incubation or by being wholly covered with nesting material,
as were numerous previous settings. The eggs hatched promptly,
approximately within thirteen days from the time they were laid. The
black-billed youngsters, almost of equal size, were fed so well by both
parents that they grew rapidly. At times, the male parent would feed
both squabs simultaneously, his throat being hardly wide enough to
accommodate both youngsters' beaks. When the squabs were ten days
old and quite well feathered, their parents stopped brooding them.
This gave me an opportunity to look them over daily and to make
sure that they were getting sufficient food. They were approaching the
critical time in their lives when some species of foreign doves will stop
feeding their young and start another nest. Only once did I find the
youngsters' crops to be empty. Moreover, one squab had dropped to
the floor of the pen, probably because it was hungry. This caused me
some concern, since I wanted very much to raise " my first " Key-
West Quail Doves. After I had put the youngster back into the nest,
I examined the various seed dishes, only one of which was empty--the
one usually filled with shelled sunflower seed, which seed these doves
like best of all. Quickly I refilled the container, and it was but a short
while before the old birds ate their fill of it. When, several hours later,
I had another look at the squabs, both of which were still in the nest,
their protruding crops were well filled and they sat contentedly side
by side, not minding my close approach at all.
At the age of fifteen days, both youngsters flew off the nest, to which
they did not return at any time thereafter. In contrast to their parents,
they were quite shy, almost wild, often flying vigorously against the
wire-netting of the pen at my approach. This behaviour prompted
their parents to sound " whirring " notes at short intervals until I left
their pen. In fact, since having produced young, the old pair is much
more " circumspect " than ever before : whereas formerly they
tolerated my close approach to their nest without protest, now they
are always on the alert when I enter their pen, eyeing me suspiciously
and steadily until I leave.
The young grew to independence in a month's time and were re-
moved to a separate pen at six weeks of age. They are still (instinctively)
wild, and fearful of my person, though peaceful with other ground
doves. They are a sturdy pair, both coloured alike, the one slightly
smaller than his nest-mate. They look at first glance much like young

common Bronze-wings, and they also act very much like them. Perhaps
their most distinctive mark is the white stripe running from the beak
to the ear-coverts. On leaving the nest, these doves were a light brown
all over, an excellent protective colouring in dry, grassy regions.
Gradually, their backs and wings are assuming a deep-reddish colour,
which in mature specimens no doubt accounts for the species being
called also the " Golden Dove Their heads are light brown and
their lower parts greyish-white. Their plumage shows as yet only
traces of the metallic green and purple, which colours lend this species
its unique beauty. Very much on the alert, the young Key-West Quail
Doves are strong, swift flyers. Now fully raised, they give every appear-
ance of maturing into a handsome pair.
Coming back to the behaviour of the old pair, it should be noted that
since its transfer to new quarters, the birds stopped the practice of
more or less continuous nest-building after laying eggs. Once the eggs
were laid, they were incubated in regular and natural fashion. But
these birds still indulge in the habit of not leaving the nest promptly
at change-over time, that is, the hen will remain on it long after this
time is past, with her mate trying to push his way in to the nest deter-
minedly. I have known Mountain Witches to behave similarly, but
only at hatching time and shortly thereafter. I have never known domestic
pigeons to act in this manner at any time. What factors prompt this
very strong attachment by this pair of Key-West Quail Doves to their
nest, regardless of whether it contains eggs or young, I am unable
to say.
At this writing (16th August), the pair is nesting again, having chosen
a covered hanging box with open front for its site. It fronts toward the
east and gets the benefit of almost daily morning sunshine, but the
sitting dove faces the solid wall of the box, toward the west. In due
time, I hope to report further behaviour of this particular pair.

Sixteen Golden and Silver Pheasants have been reared and are now
three to four months old. One Monal or Impeyan Pheasant has also
been reared but as the cocks do not start coming into colour until they
are a year old, we do not yet know whether it is a male or a female.
Our adult female laid three eggs, one of which was broken and the
other two were set under a bantam. One egg disappeared during
incubation, and the young one is the sole survivor.
These birds live in the Himalayan range in North India and are
rarely found below 5,000 feet. They are entirely hardy as far as cold is
concerned, but cannot stand prolonged conditions of damp. As can
be imagined from the shape of the beak, a great deal of their food is
obtained by digging, and although they will take wheat and seed, it
should be supplemented with live food and chopped roots such as
carrot.
Of the Parrot family we have reared in addition to Fischer's Love-
birds, Gockatiels, and a Ring-necked Parrakeet, two nice young
Pennant's Parrakeets and a young Scaly-breasted Lorikeet.
Some interesting hybrid breeding has also taken place, a blue
Masked/Fischer's Lovebird and a Barraband's / Crimson-winged
Parrakeet. There is the possibility of one or two more arrivals in the
parrot family, but as they are still only noises in nest-boxes at the time
when these notes are written, we will not record their arrival just yet.
Another interesting success has been the Zosterops in the Tropical
House. A number of these neat little birds share the large planted area
of the Tropical House with Hummingbirds and a small mixed
collection of Waxbills, to say nothing of a Pigmy Hippo and several
Giant Tortoises. Six or seven nests have been built by the Zosterops,
and at least two fledglings have been observed out of the nest. There
may well be several more, as the problem of stock-taking such active
creatures in a mass of tropical vegetation is well nigh impossible.
A pair of Imperial Fruit Pigeons are sitting on their fourth egg.
The first was clear, the second produced a squab which died within
twenty-four hours, due we think, to the hen being frightened off the
nest at night by a cat or owl ; the third egg was deserted, and now we
are hoping fourth time lucky.
Picazuro Pigeons have lost several clutches but are now on another
one and numbers of Barbary and Ring-necked Doves have been bred.
For the British bird enthusiast, three young Blackbirds were hatched
and reared, and a pair of Choughs on deposit had eggs, but lost them.
The culprit is thought to have been a Steller's Jay.
Waterfowl have been disappointing. Large numbers of our resident

free-flying Mallard have been hatched, and twenty or thirty reared.
Six hybrid diving ducklings are growing well, but although our Baikal
Teal were seen to pair, no nest or eggs were found, and the Black
Swans, though a true pair, made no attempt to build. They did,
however, go through courtship displays, and as they are a young pair,
we have great hopes for next year.
Near misses include the King Parrakeets, which sat well for three
weeks and then deserted in a thunderstorm, the Humboldt Penguins,
which were robbed, and the Sarus Cranes which mated and became
very aggressive but went no further. The Flamingos are nest building,
but it is too late to hope for results.
Interesting new arrivals since my last notes are an Occipital Blue
Pie, presented by T. L. S. Dooly, an additional Sarus Crane
which made a forced landing on an R.A.F. aerodrome and held up
air traffic for two hours before capture, and a Giant Whydah.

Six species (marked with asterisks) new to the collection are among
the birds received in recent weeks. Another two are not as yet identified
with certainty.
One of these is a juvenile Bubo found in the Amani Forest of north-
eastern Tanganyika and sent by the Director of the Malaria Institute
at Amani. The bird had evidently just left the nest when found early
in May and it is believed to be Bubo vosseleri , the Nduk Eagle Owl,
first described by Reichenow in 1908 from a specimen collected in the
Amani Forest. The juvenile plumage has not been described. This
specimen is of approximately the size of Bubo poensis , Fraser's Eagle-
Owl, and the two were formerly considered to be conspecific, but
poensis is not, of course, in this area.
Another and more difficult puzzle arrived in the form of three white
herons with dull greenish legs and pale yellowish feet and these are
believed to be Demigretta sacra, the Reef Heron, which, of course has
a white and grey phase. These came from Dr. Searle in Hong Kong
who also sent two Edwards' Lorikeets ( Trichoglossus haematod capistratus ).
Two Spur-winged Plovers* ( Hoplopterus spinosus) arrived from Kenya
together with two Lily Trotters ( Actophilornis afncanus), two Crowned
Lapwings ( Stephanibyx coronatus), a D'Arnaud's Barbet* ( Trachyphonus
darnaudi darnaudi) and two juvenile Red-billed Oxpeckers* ( Buphagus
erythrorhynchus ).

As described in the last number of the Magazine, Derek Goodwin
has bred the Blue-headed Waxbill Uraeginthus cyanocephalus. It is believed
that this may be a first success.
Any member or reader knowing of a previous breeding of this species
in Great Britain or Northern Ireland is requested to communicate at
once with the Hon. Secretary.

The past breeding season must generally have been one of the worst
for many years. For Mrs. K. M. Scamell, however, 1962 will surely
be memorable as a year of great success. Not only is she able to report
three possible " firsts "--Pied Bush Chat Saxicola caprata , Ruby throat
Calliope calliope , and Himalayan Rubythroat Calliope pectoralis , but the
pair of Blue-headed Rock Thrushes Monticola cinchoryncha which
achieved a first breeding in i960, has successfully reared broods of
three and four.

Walther Langberg, Copenhagen, reports that he has successfully bred
three young Pearl-throated Mannikins Odontospiza caniceps. This is
possibly a world " first ".
Some of the parrakeets have bred very well this year. Six pairs of
Crimson-winged have reared twenty-three young between them ; and
up to the end of August there were twenty-nine young Splendids
flying. A pair of Grey Parrots has two young ones ; and Peak's, Red-
headed and Blue-faced Parrot Finches have all done well.

first young Barraband's--Crimson-winged hybrid left the nest yester-

one was bred in the Duke of Bedford's aviaries in 1939. Its upbringing
was curious. A clutch of eggs was " put under a broody bantam which
damaged most of them, including one fertile one, but succeeded in
hatching another An attempt was made to hand-rear this young
one but, after a day or so, as it did not appear to be doing as well as it
should, it was given to an unmated hen Amboina King Parrakeet that
had a nest of eggs. She proved an excellent foster-mother and success-
fully reared her charge. ( Avicult . Mag ., 1939, p. 398.)

The cock of one pair of Many-coloured with young feigned injury
whenever anyone went near the nest. He would fall to the ground,
take two or three steps with wings out-stretched and fall onto his beak.
If that did not succeed he would keep repeating the act until one went
away, when he c recovered ' rapidly. I have never seen a parrakeet
do this before and wondered whether any of our members has seen or
heard of anything similar."

Dr. R. E. B. Brown, Newcastle, N.S.W., who has been so very
successful in breeding Bleeding-heart Pigeons--fifty-three young
reared from his original male and two females--says he finds them
nearly as easy to breed as domestic pigeons, provided a few necessary
precautions are taken. (1) They must never be frightened on the nest--
if they are they never return, (ii) A diet rich in protein is essential.
They are highly insectivorous and will greedily eat white ants, meal-
worms, crickets, grasshoppers (if not too large), and any smooth-
skinned grubs, such as silkworms. The diet supplied by Dr. Brown
consists of wheat, milo (a sorghum-like seed), millet, soft food and
hard-boiled egg. Every day they are given a ration of fresh, raw
minced steak of which they are very fond. White ants and mealworms
are given daily, also any other available insects. They are very fond of
paw-paw seeds, also apple and pear seeds. Bleeding-hearts do very
much better in a planted aviary--they are not at ease in sheds and tend
to desert their eggs there. The best nest receptacle is a wire fern basket
placed in a tree--they readily occupy these.

Dr. Brown says : " They breed all the year round in this climate
which is very like that of southern California--except that we do not
have the fog they have there. They do not stop at all, even when
moulting. I would like to separate them for three months in the year
but if I do it takes at least six months to pair them up again." Inciden-
tally, Dr. Brown hopes to be in England next summer and looks for-
ward to seeing some aviaries.

BREEDING THE RED-LEGGED WATER-RAIL
By Charles Everitt (Trenton, N.J., U.S.A.)
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.99765905882353" page_id="56317232"  page_num="" year="" vol="">
In October 1961, a consignment of birds received by Mr. Edward
Marshall Boehm from South America included five Red-legged
Water-Rails --(Ortygops notata )--which were released into one of the
new planted aviaries that had been erected on rising ground to the
rear of the ornamental waterfowl lake. There being no visual way of
sexing the birds, coloured leg bands were placed on each, first to
facilitate the making of the daily check carried out on all birds and,
secondly, in the event of their going to nest, to be able to determine
the sexes.
They are a small species of rail being only some 6 inches in height
and are often referred to as Waterhens. The head and neck are a rich
chestnut-brown, the back, wings, and tail being chocolate coloured.
The throat, abdomen, and under tail-coverts are white and there is
black and white barring on the flanks. The eye has a red iris with a
deep brown pupil and legs are red. The upper mandible is black except
at the lower portion of the base which is yellow, the colour of the lower
mandible. Above the upper mandible, towards the base, there is a
dark, scar-like incrustation, the remains of the " egg tooth ".
It was observed that, although they kept to the ground for the better
part of the time, they were also very adept at climbing about in the
various hemlock trees in the aviary. For the benefit of some Kurricane
Thrushes occupying the same aviary, nest-baskets had been fixed at
varying levels in these trees. However, the thrushes spurned them, as
is recorded in the separate report on their breeding, but the rails took
possession of one located about 3 feet above ground level. Nest-
building commenced on 10th April, but they played around at it for
some six weeks leading us to surmise that they might all be of the same
sex. Finally, on 24th May, there was one plain white egg in the nest
followed the next day by a second. They were rather large for the size
of the bird being 27 by 20 mm.
During the day, only one bird was seen to be sitting and it is presumed
that it was the female although still no difference could be detected
amongst the three of them. As evening approached, however, another
rail joined the bird in the nest, the third member of the species taking

up a roosting position on a nearby branch. As it was the same two :
birds that tended the eggs throughout, they have been designated )
as the parents, the one sitting during the day being recorded as the
female. The periods of incubation was twenty-four days and apparently 1
began with the laying of the first egg for one hatched on 18th June,
and the other on the 19th. The female had appeared to have deserted
the second egg on the hatching of the first but, since it did hatch, this
could not have been the case.
Being of the nidifugous class of birds, the nestlings were covered with
fluffy feathering, black in colour and they vacated the nest within two
hours of hatching, following wherever their parents led them. It was
feared that the first one had been lost, either by escaping through the
J-inch mesh wiring or by some other foul means. It could not be seen
anywhere but, as the parents were fussing around, it was assumed it
was safe and was hiding in the ground-ivy covering the greater part of I
the aviary. Nevertheless, as a safeguard, the outside wiring was covered j
with Visqueen to a height of about 12 inches up from the ground.
With the arrival of the second chick it was decided to confine the
family to a specific area in the aviary. First a -J-inch wire compound
was constructed and placed at the selected site. As it had been seen
that number one chick returned to the nest the first night, this same nest
was transferred to a low bush that had been fenced in by the wire
enclosure. Now came the tricky part of the operation, the catching of
the chicks. At one moment they could be seen but, at the slightest
movement by one of us, they froze where they were and virtually
disappeared. Fortunately there was a bird-house situated at the far
end of the aviary, close to their original nesting site, so it was thought
that if the door was opened it might be possible to manoeuvre the entire
family into the corridor running the length of the house. After about
an hour of encircling movement the parents were finally induced to
go in, clucking all the time, and were soon followed by their offspring.
It was now but a matter of seconds to net them and transfer them to
their new quarters. The opportunity was taken at this time to have a
good look at the young birds and it was observed that they were
completely black, even their legs, with the exception of the white
" egg tooth " on the top of their upper mandible This subsequently
subsided until it was only visible as the black " scar " previously
mentioned during the description of the adult birds.
From the time they left the nest, the chicks picked up for themselves
the parents selecting the appropriate tit-bits and showing the young
birds what to do with them. They were kept in confinement for about
fourteen days by which time it was felt that they had grown to a size
when they could not be mistaken for a dainty morsel by one of the
larger birds occupying the same aviary. Actually there were some
twenty-six other birds with them including Ross's Touracos, Meve's

and Amethyst Starlings, Kurricane Thrushes, Black-headed Orioles,
Fairy Bluebirds, Bell Birds and some Tanagers and Sunbirds.
Immediately the family was given its freedom, the third adult rail
joined forces with the parents and helped in shepherding the young
birds around. In the evenings it was noticed that all three
adults and the young birds returned to the same nest but, after about
four days of this, they must have felt a little crowded for one of the
young birds deserted its parents and joined number three adult in
another nest in an adjacent tree.
It was not until they were about twenty-four days old that feathers
began to show but, from then on, it was only a a matter of a further
two weeks before they were fully feathered. Their upper plumage was
dark brown, the lower parts being grey and the legs remaining black.
The chestnut colouring first began to show on their heads when they
were about seven weeks old, the underparts having taken on a lighter
shade by that time. Now they are over three months old and, although
slightly smaller than their parents, it is by their leg bands that they are
most easily recognized. Time alone will show what their sexes are and
it is intended to leave all five birds together in the hope that one of the
young birds will eventually be suited as a mate for the original number
three adult.
The normal feed of the adult birds consists of the soft-food mixture
we prepare for all birds in general, together with ground raw beef-
heart. Apart from the insects and grubs they forage for themselves and
the regular issues of live-food made throughout the day, they have not
been seen to partake of anything else although there is seed, grain, and
mixed fruits available at all times. Whilst in their compound the young
birds did have their soft-food mixture supplemented by an additional
quantity of hard-boiled egg but this, plus small mealworms and
gentles, was all that was given them. Once they were released into the
open aviary they carried on with exactly the same feed given to the
adult birds.
So far as I have been able to ascertain, it appears that this breeding
of the Red-legged Water-Rail by Mr. Boehm is the first time this species
has been bred in captivity in a private collection. Any further informa-
tion on this point would be appreciated.

By K. E. L. Simmons (Ascension Island)
(Illustrations by Robert Gillmor)
In the autumn of i960, I bought a pair of Rufous-chinned Jay-
Thrushes (Garrulax rufogularis) and installed them in an outdoor flight,
17 feet long. I was told by their previous owner that these babblers
would hammer open peanut-husks and bury the nuts. I prepared the
flight by covering most of the ground surface with leaf-mould and litter
in which I scattered peanuts and sunflower seeds. The birds were very
tame and settled down immediately, soon exploring their new home and
uncovering the buried items. They split open the sunflower seed-cases
and broke up the already shelled peanuts with a few hearty blows of
the bill. No burying behaviour was noted, however. During the next
weeks, I provided as great a variety of autumn fruits and berries as I
could find to see what the birds liked, but it was not until early in
October that I fortuitously gave them some acorns, never suspecting
that these birds were specialist acorn-eaters.
On 3rd October, I threw six large acorns on to the leaf-mould. The
birds were immediately interested and dropped to the ground almost
colliding in their eagerness. Both pecked at an acorn, moving it around
on the ground until it was at a suitable angle to pick up endways.
They then hopped about the floor of the aviary, each bird dropping
its acorn every now and then and briefly banging at it vigorously with
the bill before moving on. They appeared to be searching for firmer
ground on which to attack their acorns and finally each bird, having
tested several spots, settled down to deal with its acorn, placing it on
the ground just in front and dealing it hard blows, swinging up the
head and bringing down the bill like a pickaxe. If the acorn became
spiked on the end of the bill, the babbler would remove it if firmly
wedged by deliberately raising one foot and pushing the acorn off.
I had seen signs of this movement before when the birds were opening
sunflower seeds, but had not grasped its significance. Not only had
these birds special movements for fracturing hard seeds, but they were
also equipped with special movements for freeing the bill if necessary--
a wonderful and unique adaptation.
One bird (" A ") soon ceased banging though the other (" B ")
persisted a little longer, but then also stopped to watch " A " which
was now burying its acorn. It hid it in the leaf-mould, driving it into
the ground with blows of the bill and covering over the spot with dead
leaves. " B " retrieved the acorn immediately and started banging at
it, soon fracturing the outer shell and swallowing fragments of the nut.
After this, the birds caused my wife and I much amusement by burying
and recovering the acorn each in turn a number of times.

The Jay-Thrushes were given more acorns the following day but
they were more intent on burying them than eating them this time.
" A ", however, dug up an acorn buried by " B " and worked well
on it. On the day after, there were several hollowed-out shells on the
litter and, on many occasions subsequently, I noted that when I supplied
sunflower seeds, peanuts or acorns in number the birds usually hid all
that were in view and uncovered and ate them later at their leisure.
No systematic observations on hiding and recovering were made,
however, as my main work with these birds had to do with their
anting-behaviour. I gave them stale acorns throughout the following
winter and spring, getting the impression that their storing behaviour
declined, though whether this was seasonal or due to the inadequacy
of the acorns or of the surroundings I do not know. When I periodically
cleared the leaf-mould of rubbish or renewed it, I found that all buried
items had been recovered.
Only acorns and similar hard foods were hidden--not insects, fruits
or the food-mixture so far as I know. The birds were less keen on most
fruits than on nuts and the like. Large sweet-chestnuts proved too
tough for them to open so these were given cut in two, the half-shells
soon being hollowed out. Peanut-husks were dealt with like acorns,
the birds extracting the nuts through a large central hole or through
one knocked into both or one end. Each peanut was then buried or
broken up in the usual way and large pieces swallowed. I never saw
peanuts hidden in the husk. On the other hand, sunflower seeds were
buried only in the case. They were opened with a few blows and the
seed usually swallowed whole. Of fruit, apples were the favourite,
given partly peeled and spiked on a branch, the birds poking their
bills into them and eating the pieces. Plums, also partly skinned, were

eaten on the floor ; but here the Jay-Thrushes used an adaptation of
the acorn-freeing movement, driving their bills into the flesh then
quickly stepping on the fruit and withdrawing the bill. Blackberries
were also taken to the ground and each separate seed nodule pecked
off, the birds sometimes grasping the whole fruit in the foot while doing
so, though they used the foot while feeding far less frequently than the
smaller babblers, for example the Pekin Robin (Leiothrix luted) and,
especially, the Blue-winged Siva (Siva cyanuroptera ). Similarly insects, ,
of which the birds were very fond, were usually eaten without being
held down in the foot or any other preparation. Mealworms were
given daily throughout the year. When available, as much live food
as possible was provided, including ants (for tests on anting) and pupae.
The birds even liked earwigs and the tamer of the two, " B ", would
wait for the aviary doors to be opened and pounce on any earwigs that
had been hiding between door and frame. This bird would accompany
me when I cleared up the floor of the flight, seizing any insect uncovered
or forced to move. It would wait expectantly for me to turn over some
large stones placed especially to provide shelter for insects and centi-
pedes. Ground-beetles, including foul-smelling species, were eagerly
sought out, as were the centipedes. The same bird would also accept
incapacitated worker bees and wasps from me, but these would be
" worried " on the ground for some time before being swallowed,
pecked and dabbled there until a small crater was formed in the soft
earth. Similar treatment was given to the occasional hibernating newt
that I found. Worms and slugs were seldom touched.
The following autumn I again gave the birds fresh acorns to check
up on the details of the behaviour patterns involved in breaking,
eating and burying. On 5th October they had their first quantity of
the season and, although they did some banging, their chief concern
was to bury the acorns. " A ", however, successfully split one and both
birds ate some of this, " B " also uncovering, banging and reburying
an acorn first hidden by its companion. The following details emerge
from the total observations :--
Carrying .--The acorn was held in the tips of the mandibles, usually
by the broad, blunt end, occasionally by the more pointed end. When
taking acorns to the burying area, the Jay-Thrushes would sometimes
fly, though they preferred to proceed along the ground, bounding with
great hops, body hunched, giving low conversational calls.
Burying .--The bird, holding the acorn in its beak, would ram it
more or less vertically into the soft ground, usually point first, and then
hammer it further in until it was firmly fixed below the surface of the
ground. These hammering actions were somewhat similar to the
splitting ones, but were performed in a quicker succession and without
the exaggerated head-swing, the purpose being to knock the acorn in

<bodyText confidence="0.995343066666667" page_id="56317238"  page_num="185" year="" vol="">
and not to break it. The bird aimed repeatedly at the same spot,
usually the scar on the broader end. If the acorn entered the ground
on a slant, the bird usually slanted its blows also ; occasionally it then
struck the side of the acorn and drove it in horizontally not vertically.
Sometimes acorns were merely pushed into very soft earth and covered
immediately, without any hammering. Fragments of acorn were
sometimes buried after splitting.
Covering .--As soon as the acorn was buried to the bird's satisfaction,
it would often pick up a leaf straight away and place it in the hole,
sometimes hopping some distance from the spot to secure one. With
partly opened bill it would also pick up bits of earth, a leaf, a small
twig, a pine-needle or whatever suitable items were available and
place these separately and deliberately on top of the acorn, sometimes
hammering again a few times during the collecting session. In addition,
the bird would poke at the sides of the hole and cause a small collapse
of the earthen walls on top of the acorn. Finally, earth and debris were
often raked in over the burying spot with side to side hoeing move-
ments of the bill, and perhaps a final leaf added.
Uncovering .--This was the least studied activity. The bird would go
to the burying spot and, with side to side flicking movements of the
bill, uncover the acorn, seize it and carry it away. Each Jay-Thrush
probably remembered its own burying spots and those of its companion
within the confines of the small aviary.
Splitting and eating .--For splitting, the acorn would be placed on its
side on a firm or fairly firm surface, preferably ground with a thin
covering of friable earth or the like on top so that the acorn did not
shoot about when struck. Completely bare, hard ground was not
favoured and the birds did not use small slabs of concrete or rocks that
were available. " B " regularly took its acorn to the flat, wooden
base-struts of the aviary where these were covered with earth or leaf-
mould. The bird would prepare for splitting by standing in front of
the acorn with its legs well apart. The fracturing blows of the bill
were delivered with the whole power of the body, the Jay-Thrush
swinging its head, neck and forepart of the body upwards and then
downwards, often with a flick of the closed wings, the bill remaining
in line with the acorn throughout, mandibles slightly open. This bill
action was not a continuous, woodpecker-like hammering but a series
of deliberate, individual blows aimed at the same spot in the centre of
one side of the acorn. If the acorn was knocked out of position, the bird
would re-align it with open mandibles in a special way, tucking its bill
down obliquely to grasp the far side of the acorn, mandibles inverted
with maxilla underneath the acorn, and turning it round with a
straightening of the head. The movement resembled that used by
certain birds in rolling an egg back into the nest except that the open
beak was used. If necessary, these turning actions were repeated.

1 86 K. E. L. SIMMONS-JAY-THRUSHES AND ACORNS
When a hole appeared in the shell, the bird continued its pickaxing,
but now each blow was terminated with a twisting movement of the
bill. Small cores of nut would be forced between the slightly open
mandibles at each blow, and fragments were also detached and
swallowed. Sometimes, the acorn would then be hollowed out bit by
bit ; at others, larger pieces would get detached and be separately
broken up and eaten.
Bill-freeing .--When the acorn became impaled on the Jay-Thrushes'
beak before it was fully holed, the bird sometimes left it there and
continued with the fracturing blows, the acorn often coming free on
the next impact. More often, however, the special foot-stepping, bill-
freeing movements were used to detach the acorn, especially during
the time of eating. The bird would raise one foot and push down on
the acorn, which was held close to the ground, at the same time grasping
the acorn firmly with the toes and withdrawing the bill with a twisting
movement of the head. All this happened very quickly and the Jay-
Thrush would soon be banging away again. Sometimes, when not
too firmly attached, an acorn was removed with a mere shake of the head.

That at least some of the movements described above are not con-
fined to this one species of Jay-Thrush was confirmed by John Yealland
and Derek Goodwin after the observations on Garrulax rufogularis. They
separately gave acorns to birds at the London Zoo and recorded the
acorn-splitting and bill-freeing techniques from a number of other
*species of Garrulax. Storer (i960) has drawn attention to the striking
adaptive radiation of the babblers (Timaliidae) on the continental
land-mass of southern Asia where the 44 many more or less isolated
mountain chains have provided 4 insular 3 conditions under which the
babblers, most of them weak fliers, have radiated into a remarkably
varied assemblage 55 . He points out and illustrates the striking diver-
gence in bill form. With reference to the Jay-Thrushes of the genus
Garrulax (as delimited by Delacour (1946) presumably), with their
rather stout, jay-like bills, Storer remarks that, like the true jays
(Corvidae), 44 they feed on a great variety of insects, fruits and seeds. 53
As the present account shows, this similarity between Jay and Jay-
Thrush is even greater, for both are specialist acorn eaters and hoarders
though differing in their methods.
The behaviour of the Common Jay ( Garrulus glandarius) in relation
to acorns has been described in detail by Goodwin (1951) and may be
taken as typical of most jays. It uses different techniques from the
Rufous-chinned Jay-Thrush in opening and eating acorns, but buries
them in a somewhat similar manner. Its method of harvesting is
probably more efficient for, whereas the Jay-Thrush, presumably,
takes fallen acorns only from below the tree, one at a time, and buries
them near by, the Jay takes green acorns directly from the tree itself,
a number at a time, and flies away with them to its own individual
burying areas. Such a difference in method of collecting would ensure
that Jay and Jay-Thrush compete little for the available acorn supply
in regions where both occur. Little, however, is known about the
behaviour of any of the Jay-Thrushes in the wild, though their social
habits make it likely that parties of these birds wander from place to
place burying surplus acorns and later work back over the same ground
to recover them. Like Jays, Jay-Thrushes must help to spread the oak
by failing to detect all the buried acorns. Turcek (cited by van Tyne

dence between the range of the Common Jay and the distribution of
oaks ; it would be most instructive to plot the range of the Jay-Thrushes
of the genus Garrulax in the same way.
Records of acorn-eating and related behaviour in as many species
of Garrulax and other large babblers are urgently needed and avicultu-
rists are in an especially good position to provide information of this
kind and on the birds 3 general food preferences. My own impression
is that the Jay-Thrushes may be specialist feeders in more than one

way. Not only do they eat acorns, which are too hard for most pas-
serines to tackle and distasteful to many, but they also take a variety
of insects and other invertebrates that are avoided by many other
species on account of their peculiar taste, weapons or warning
colouration.

OBSERVATIONS ON RUFOUS-CHINNED
JAY-THRUSHES
(\0x25A0Garrulax rufogularis)

By C. J. O. Harrison (Perivale, Middlesex, England)
When K. E. L. Simmons went to Ascension Island he very kindly
gave me the two Rufous-chinned Jay-Thrushes (Garrulax rufogularis )
which he had bought the year before. They are one of the smaller
Jay-Thrush species, about the size of a Song Thrush but with the rather
big-headed appearance that Jay-Thrushes have and the rather weak-
looking hind-quarters due to the very short wings. They are a warm
brown colour heavily marked with small black crescentic bars on the
feather tips, the tail is a more reddish brown and is graduated, with an
orange band across the feather tips separated from the brown by a
black subterminal bar. These two bars are more conspicuous on the
pale underside of the tail. The underside is grey, paling to white on
throat, mid-breast, and belly, with a carroty-orange patch on the
throat and a larger area of the same colour on the under tail-coverts.
There are black speckling, formed by dark feather tips, over much of
the underside. A black line formed by covert tips separates off the
dark flight feathers which are narrowly edged with silver, and the
brown, black-tipped secondaries have a tiny silver line along the tip.
The head is basically brown with a broad black stripe running from
the bill, over the crown. Between eye and bill is a white spot that fades
over the eyebrow into the brown of the head, giving the bird a perma-
nent air of slight surprise. The ear-coverts are orange. The two birds
are almost exactly alike save that one has less bold black tips on the
body feathers and the white loral spots are slightly tinged with brown.

This individual is much bolder and tamer of the two and from subse-
quent observation is suspected to be a cock, in spite of duller colouration,
while the brighter, shyer bird is a hen.
General Behaviour
Their characteristic posture on the ground is a rather hunched one
that suggests a thrush that is beginning to feel the cold. They hold
themselves much closer to the ground than any thrush and progress by
strong springy hops. This greater flexure and strength of the legs
seems to be a conspicuous character of the Jay-Thrushes, and to a
lesser extent of all the babblers. They spend a lot of time turning over
the ground or dead leaves with sideway movements of the bill, following
no particular rhythm of movement. If disturbed while feeding like
this they remain quite still and silent, and against bare branches, or a
background of dead leaves or earth they seem to disappear entirely.
Time and time again, when suddenly entering the aviary shelter, I have
had to stop and search for them, to reassure myself that they really
are squatting silently there. When feeding like this, undisturbed, they
keep up a series of low contact notes, a continual flow of soft faint
plangent, churring, or quietly interrogative notes, like a small fussy
conversation. It is not possible to isolate particular notes as having a
special function, but one can recognize the general difference in tone
that gives a wide variety of expression--from the more voluble excite-
ment when there is something new or unusual to be seen or investigated,
to the tiny soft twangy note uttered when they are disturbed when
clumped side by side on a roost perch at night, a noise so faint that one
can only trace the source by the very slight movement of the tail tip
at each utterance.

They fly little, and only if they must. The short wings, stopping
before the upper tail-coverts, with the primaries almost completely
hidden by the folded secondaries, play little part in their movement.
Instead they move from point to point with great bounding springs of
their strong legs. In such movement the body is horizontal and the head
extended forwards. The tail is in line with the body and swung to one
side or the other to maintain balance, and the wings are often twisted
to one side or the other. On several occasions people who have seen
the birds in such a posture have spoken of a " dropped wing " not
realizing that the shifting of wings and tail to one side or another were
all part of a movement that enables them to twist and side-slip through
a mass of twigs in a beautiful smooth movement more suggestive of a
rodent than a bird. Their strong grip aids them in this and I have
seen a bird lean so far forward on a perch, craning its head well below
it to peer at something, that it looked as
off long before.
though it should have fallen
They roost, and rest, clumped close together, side by side on a perch.
Sometimes they preen one another, the preened bird twisting its head
into all sorts of odd attitudes to facilitate the process. They bathe in
the babbler fashion. The bird perches on the edge of the water bowl,
then in a single movement it hops in, crouches fluttering its wings
furiously and abruptly and raising a momentary fountain of water ;
and then equally abruptly it leaps out onto a branch and shakes itself.
It may return to repeat the process a number of times before it is
satisfied, but it only stays in the water for a brief moment and never
squats for a prolonged bathe in the way that finches or thrushes do.

was even briefer in its immersion and raised an even higher spray with
the violence of its flutters. I could stand in the house and tell by the
height of the fountain of droplets that shot up from the bowl in the
aviary away down the garden which species was now enjoying a bathe.
I found that they spent most of the day in the shelter shed, and apart
from emerging to investigate anything that happened within the vicinity
of the aviary they were only out for any length of time at dawn and
dusk. Since the shed has windows round the upper half and is enclosed
and darker at roof and floor level, and furnished with twiggy branches,
it may have appeared to them as a substitute forest. Since the shrubby
apple tree in the aviary flight has recovered from the attention of a
pair of Greenfinches that stripped off every bud this spring, and has
produced a thick mass of twigs, they have taken to resting at times in
the thickest and leafiest parts of this cover. When in the shed they
often rest by day on a perch near the floor but usually chose a high
perch for roosting. During nesting, however, they rested on a low
perch, possibly because this was farthest from the nest which was in
an upper corner of the shed.

Excitement and Aggression
</subsubsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.995658791666667" page_id="56317244"  page_num="191" year="" vol="">
Excitement posturing was evident when the birds were first intro-
duced into the shed and later in their early exploratory excursions
into the flight, but since then it has become infrequent. It is assumed
apparently without cause, on some occasions when the birds first
emerge from roosting in the early morning. It is also elicited by the
sight of anything very unusual, or when the birds are recovering from
a scare. It is accompanied by very characteristic calling. This begins,
at low intensity, as a babbling noisy version of the usual contact con-
versation. It becomes a loud throaty bubbling with the introduction
of many harsh nasal notes, and sounds, from a little distance, like a
small flock of excited quarrelling Starlings. As excitement increases
" reek " notes are introduced. These are abrupt high-pitched screeching
notes reminiscent of those of a startled Blackbird. With greater excite-
ment these become more frequent and louder. When I first heard it
I hurried out hoping to discover the sex of the bird concerned, but
found that both of them were contributing an equal share to it.
In the posture that accompanies it the bird turns a little to one side
and perches with the body drawn up and head and neck stretched
upwards and forwards with the bill a little raised. The tail is held to
the opposite side. The bird performs a rapid combined pivoting and
ducking movement, bringing the head down low as it turns and then
throwing it up as it completes the swing of the body, at the same time
swinging the tail across with a vigorous jerky movement. This jerky
side to side swing may be accompanied, in moments of more intense

excitement, by wing-flicking. It brings into prominence the conspicu-
ously coloured region of the throat and the tail-tip. At low intensity
the calls may be uttered without obvious posturing of this type.
Actual aggression I saw only once. For a time the birds shared the
aviary with a Common Starling (Sturnus vulgaris). This latter bird
would not come down to feed while I was in the shed, but immediately
I left it would descend and drive the other birds off in order to take
what it wanted. One day it did so while I was present, driving the
Jay-Thrushes away from some mealworms that I had just put in. The
cock Jay-Thrush began to utter a continuous low nasal churring and
at the same time inflated its plumage, erecting the contour feathers j
of head and body so that both appeared nearly twice as big. The thick
soft feathering presented an unbroken outline and the dense rump
feathers gave it a hump-backed appearance. The tail was spread,
the black and orange banding at the tip becoming very conspicuous.
It was drawn up tall, appearing very long-legged, and in this posture
it hopped slowly towards the Starling with a slight lateral pivoting of
the body, and finally grappled with it.
I saw this posture again when I had occasion to catch the hen Pekin
Robin that was with them in the aviary. It had been with them most
of the time without incident, but they were nesting and had become
much more intolerant of its presence, especially near the nest. I caught
the Pekin Robin in a net and as I took it out it uttered a series of long-
drawn squeals. Immediately both Jay-Thrushes responded by adopting
the aggressive posture and uttering the call that accompanies it. The
hen showed a much less intense version than the cock. I could not be

sure if they were reacting towards the Pekin Robin or whether this
represented the general reaction of a social species when another bird
was caught by a predator. Certainly when I fed them two minutes
afterwards they did not react towards me in any abnormal manner
or show fear.
On one occasion I showed them a stuffed Long-eared Owl, putting
it just inside the door of their part of the shelter shed. At first they
kept well away from it, on the upper perches. They began uttering
conversational calls that changed quickly into excitement calling. At
the same time they began to move closer to the owl with rather jerky
movements, flicking the partly-spread tail from side to side. The
calling became louder and the " reek " notes were drawn out into
high-pitched rattling calls uttered with the bill open. Their reaction
appeared to be typical mobbing behaviour and one had the impression
that they would have swooped at the owl if there had been a perch
beyond it that they could have moved to.
Vocabulary
I have already described the calls associated with normal contact
behaviour, and with excitement or aggression. In view of the relatively
small size of the aviary, a 6 by 4 feet shelter and a 7 by 7 feet flight,
the birds were not able to move very far from one another and hence
it was difficult to detect special contact calls. Once, when one bird
was being fed in the flight and the other was out of sight in the shed,
the bird at the food uttered a single soft " chuk " call and the other
immediately appeared and joined it. This might have been pure
coincidence. On a number of occasions one bird, out in the flight,
would be heard to utter a long-drawn harsh nasal note with a com-
plaining tone. This note is rather subdued but can be heard for a
surprising distance. I suspect that I have only heard it uttered at low
intensity, and that if uttered loudly it would be heard a long way off.
Observations on other species of Jay-Thrush at the London Zoo have
shown that most of them possess a Distance Contact Call, usually a
single or double note, which enables them to keep in touch with other
individuals at some distance. I suspect that the call which I have
heard from the aviary may be a low-intensity version of the Distance
Contact Call of the Rufous-throated Jay-Thrush.
Food
Simmons has given detailed information on this subject and I have
only a few comments to add. When I put in millet and hemp seeds for
the Greenfinches I found that the Jay-Thrushes were taking small
quantities of both, particularly the latter. I found their indifference
to earthworms surprising, though I suspected them of occasionally

taking small ones, but they pounced avidly on any leather-jackets. It was
difficult to be sure what was a genuine recognition of food and what j
was mere curiosity. I put in nasturtium leaves, inverted to reveal a
mass of blackfly, and immediately the Jay-Thrushes began picking
them delicately off the leaves, but in a day or two they ignored them.
Similarly they would eat an occasional woodlouse, but when offered
a quantity of them they appeared to show little real interest. Moths
they took eagerly and would perform wild leaps and acrobatics in an
attempt to seize them in mid air.
Nesting
I had high hopes when a nest was built and an egg laid, but two
attempts came to nothing, apparently because of lack of co-operation
from the supposed cock. Although there is little evidence of display in
these species some of the Jay-Thrushes at the Zoo had been observed
courtship feeding, the cock feeding the hen while she quivered her
wings. This behaviour was also accompanied by a certain amount of
feather erection. The absence of any behaviour of this type suggested
to me that the birds that I had might not be ready for nesting. I still
cannot be absolutely sure of the sexes, although I am pretty certain
that only one bird laid the two eggs that were produced.
I watched for any signs of nesting intention but saw nothing apart
from a piece of fibre being momentarily picked up by one bird on one
occasion. Having seen some of the Zoo Jay-Thrushes squat in odd corners
and arrange any material that they could find in front of them I decided
to experiment. On 8th April I took a large bunch of leafy privet twigs
and wove in other twigs to form a firm base on which I put dead iris
leaves and short lengths of string, as this was the only nesting material
that I could find. I fixed this in a top corner of the shed, above win-
dow level. Immediately both birds were up to investigate it. They
approached cautiously with plumage sleeked, but hopped straight onto
it, squatted in turn, and arranged the dead leaves and string around
them. During the next day or two one or other of the birds would be
on it, arranging it and keeping up a soft low conversation as they do
when excited by anything. I rarely saw both together at the nest.
They seemed uninterested in dead leaves and plant material thrown
into the flight, but watching them I found that they spent some time
tugging at an old piece of unravelled string hanging on the apple tree
in the flight. Simmons had seen the nest of this species in the British
Museum collection and had told me that it was made almost entirely
of creeper stems. Published accounts also confirmed this habit.
Obviously string reminded them in some way of creeper. I there-
fore offered them string of varying thickness and coarseness, smooth
or unravelled, at various intervals over the next few days. I found

that it would only be examined if it was in the branches, hairy or
fluffy string being rejected with a characteristic jerk of the head, some-
times followed by bill-wiping. It would appear that, like the Senegal
Waxbills I had kept, (antea. vol. 62, p. 128) material was carefully
selected and anything that could not be freely held was distasteful.
String was jerked vigorously. Immediately it came away it was dropped
If it did not come it was ignored after repeated tugs. It would appear
that to fulfil the collecting and carrying stimulus the material had to
be suspended or entangled in branches, it had to be relatively thin,
and tough enough to require tugging, but finally to break. Under
natural conditions anything that came away immediately, or was on
the ground, was probably rotten and unsuitable for nesting material.
I tried to tie up bunches of string so that a length would come away
after a series of tugs, and achieved success in that a single piece was
carried to the nest, but that was all. I then tried adding small handfuls
to the side of the nest each time I visited the shed. It was material
that would not stimulate the birds to collect and carry it, but once it
was by the nest it became a part of the nest-material and the bird that
came to the nest would arrange it and incorporate it in the structure.
I was able to see how the nest was firmly fixed to the surrounding twigs
during the early stages of building. Any long loose end would be seized
in the bill by the bird sitting on the nest. The head and neck would
then be stretched out and the end of the material pushed outwards
and downwards over one of the twigs. The bird would then release it,
draw its head back, and reach under the twig, seizing the end, pulling
it in firmly, and pushing it into the side of the nest. In this way the
outer nest was bound firmly to the twigs surrounding it. By 13th April
there was a rudimentary string structure about as big as a Blackbird's
nest. Only one bird would be at the nest at one time, but both took
turns at building it. They roosted low, well away from it.
On 13th April I noticed a mass of dead convovulus stems on a wire
fence near my home and next day offered the birds a quantity of these,
which I tangled among the twigs of the aviary branches so that the
birds would have to tug them in order to obtain pieces. The birds
showed immediate interest and began to take it. Only the finer thinner
stems were used, but by midday on 15th April the nest had a well-
shaped inner cup of these thin stems about 1 inch thick, with a cavity
about 4 inches across and 2 to 2J inches deep. Some of the stems had
been woven round supports in the manner described. The birds ignored
any stems that fell to the ground, but showed renewed interest in them
when I re-entangled them in the branches. On 18th April I gave
more stems and the cup was consolidated, any loose ends that stuck
up being pulled down and tucked into the lining, giving the cup a
series of rounded edges that suggested basketwork. On 19th and 20th
April they began collecting very fine pieces of dried grass and plant

fibre from the ground, two or three at a time. I tried offering various
materials, not being sure what the nest-lining should be like. Various
wools were rejected and so were feathers. White hairs from a reindeer !
skin were also ignored. What they appeared to require was something
fine and tough, light in colour and a few inches long, which was to !
be found at ground level. Rootlets would appear to be the natural
material.
I offered a mixed collection of dead grasses. They rejected the
tougher stems and broad blades, but took any thin fine pieces. Both
cock and hen were at the grass together while I was present. The hen
picked up a little, but would not take it to the nest while I was there.
The cock collected a few pieces in his bill then carried them up to the
nest by a series of short hops, using various routes. He kept his head
well raised while doing so and had the head and body feathers slightly
fluffed. He hopped into the nest, placed what he was carrying down
in the cup in front of him and pushed it down while still standing.
Then he suddenly squatted low in the nest with bill and tail showing
horizontally at the edges of the cup, and made a series of vigorous
wriggling movements downwards and sideways, shaping the nest. He
did so quite openly, ignoring spectators. Mr. W. Murray gave me the
remains of a tanager's nest of the previous year from his aviary. It
was composed of rootlets, and when I shredded it and gave it to the
Jay-Thrushes they immediately collected the material and lined the
nest with it.
The nest was complete by 24th. I could go near it, but if I put
my hand toward or near it the hen would immediately look up, utter
a soft call, and go to the nest, but otherwise showed neither alarm nor
anger. By 26th April she was displaying more interest in the nest and
spending a lot of time standing, but not sitting, on it. The cock seemed
to show little interest now. On 28th April the hen spent much time in
the afternoon and evening sitting on the nest, and at 9.30 a.m. on
30th April there was a single egg in the nest. It was a typical egg,
glossy white, but rather more conical than the eggs of the species in
the British Museum collection. This was to be the complete clutch,
although it is stated to be usually two and occasionally three or four.
The next week was a worrying time. The hen sat and roosted on
the nest but was off for long periods of the day and the egg was fre-
quently cold. I suspected that the cock should be sitting also but was
not doing so. On 5th May I took the egg away. It was cold and
appeared sterile. I broke up the old nest and removed it, putting up
a new site in a different corner of the shed. The hen showed an immedi-
ate interest in this and the cock a moderate one, but they did not
immediately start to rebuild. By yth May a small cup composed
entirely of convovulus stems was being built on the old site. In the
absence of the base I had made it was pushed deeply down between some

twigs with nothing below the base of it, but bound, as the previous nest
had been, to surrounding twigs. This suggested a more natural site and
a reason for the binding of the nest to the twigs. Insufficient rootlets
were available, but, having some idea what the birds were looking for,
I cut coarse sisal string into 6 inch lengths and completely unravelled
it, strewing single fibres about the aviary floor. The birds eagerly
collected these crosswise in the bill and carried up great white mous-
tache loads of them. By the morning of 11 th May the nest had a shining
white lining, the hen sat for a while in the afternoon, the cock was on
the nest at midday next day, and on 13 th May, another single egg was
laid, similar to the first.
Again only the hen sat, but she was on the nest for most of the time
and I had hopes. On the third day she came off in the afternoon and
did not go back again. After a few days they destroyed the nest by
pulling at it, but made no attempt to build another, or nest again.

KEEPING AND BREEDING PEALE'S PARROT
FINCHES
(Erythura pealii)

In the early part of 1962 I came into possession of some of these
finches, and as very little appears to have been recorded about this species,
some notes may be of interest.
The habitat is the Fijian Islands and the predominant colours are
scarlet, green and blue, the female being less brilliant. A further
guide to sex is that the male utters a drawn-out trilling note and the
female just a short note. There is a splendid coloured plate in the
Avicultural Magazine, Volume III, Third Series.
At first the birds were very nervous but after experimenting and
finding they were very partial to a mealworm, maw seed, and whole
groats, these were given as titbits and helped to gain their confidence.
The first pair to nest were accommodated in an aviary by themselves.
When it was evident they were in breeding condition a nest-box,
oblong in shape, half open at the front, was introduced and some
shavings put in to give them a start. The male very soon inspected the
box and was shortly joined by the female. Both became very excited
and the male began displaying, which consists of up, down, and side
movements of the head, accompanied by a purring note.

It was quite evident from the reactions of the female that she was
interested and within three days a spherical nest, tunnel-shaped, was
built by the male and a clutch of four eggs, white in colour, was laid.
Although incubation was carried out by both birds the female took
the greater share. I cannot record exactly the incubation period,
which I estimate was fourteen days, but do know for certain that the
young (three) hatched on 14th June, three sturdy young leaving the
nest on 6th July. Within a few days they began feeding for themselves.
I was very much surprised to find they had a bluish mask resembling
the Three-coloured Parrot Finch (E. trichroa). The parents having a
scarlet face, one could have anticipated a little reddish colouring in
this region, as sometimes happens in young of the Red-headed
(E. psittacea). The plumage of the wings and back is green, shading
to a lighter tone on the breast, beak light horn colour, tipped with
black, the gape being ornamented with luminous beads.
During the rearing process the stock mixture of millet and canary
was supplemented with soft food, whole groats, spray millet, and soft
sweet apple. The birds have good appetites and will sample anything.
Like other members of the family they are very active and one of
their characteristics is that they use the claws quite a lot when feeding.
If given a dish of groats they will take one in the beak, fly to a perch,
transfer to the claw, and dismember. Possibly in the wild state they
pluck small fruits and adopt the same procedure. Apart from a power-
ful beak they have very strong legs and travel about the aviary floor
in a series of quick hops. If viewed full face on a perch they remind
one of a Red-headed Gouldian Finch. When mated they become very
devoted and after a period of intense activity will decide to have a
siesta sitting very close to each other. In this position, with their short
tails and chubby build, they resemble two miniature parrots.
As for their compatibility, a pair housed in an aviary with a pair
of Redheads proved satisfactory, and I quite think they would associate
amiably with other small species.

(.Psephotus haematonotus)
On 26th September, 1837, John Gould presented to the Zoological
Society of London two new species of Australian parrots. One of these
was the Red-backed Parrot, which he named Platycercus haematonotus
from the red marking on the rump. On presenting his specimen,
Gould stated that he thought it to be intermediate between Neonanodes
(since incorporated into Neophema) and Platycercus , but he was placing
it in the latter. This quandary was solved by Gould himself when, in
1845, he established the genus Psephotus , which has since been enlarged
to contain some of Australia&apos;s rarest and most beautiful members of
Psittaciformes. The Red-backed Parrot thus became established as
Psephotus haematonotus.
As this is our first meeting with this genus it would be well to establish
the connection between it and Platycercus , the genus discussed in the
preceeding papers. Both genera belong to the Platycercinae, the family
embracing all the broad-tailed parrots, and are connected thus :

The genus Lathamus has been omitted from the above diagram and
this will be discussed fully when dealing with the Swift Parrot.
The male Red-backed Parrot is a brilliantly coloured bird exhibiting
a general green plumage. An irridescent blue-green is the colour of
forehead and cheek patches, becoming duller on the back and wings.
Brilliant green is the colour of the crown, nape, and breast. Yellow is
found on the abdomen and on the shoulder patches. The wing
primaries and secondaries are adorned with ultramarine blue. The
lower abdominal and vent areas are white, with a few faint green tinges
in old birds. The rump is red, while green is the colour of the upper
tail-coverts. The tail feathers are blue-green on the upper surface and
white underneath. The female is very distinct and lacks the colours of
her mate. A light olive-green is the colour of the head, back, and wings.

The rump, upper tail-coverts, and tail feathers are green, while the
under surfaces are white, with a few birds possessing faint yellow
markings on the abdomen. Light blue is the colour of the wing
primaries, secondaries and shoulder patch. The bill is grey as against
black in the male.
Immature birds can be easily sexed on leaving the nest. Young hen
birds are similar to the adult hen, but differ in having a yellowish
bill. Young males have light blue-green on the face and shoulders,
pale yellow abdomens, and a little red on the rump. Gould, when des-
cribing the species in 1837 and 1865, makes the surprising statement
that immature males lack yellow on the abdomen and red on the
rump during their first year. This is not correct. An immature male,
taken by the author near Canberra in April, 1962, was exceptional in
lacking all colour of the males except the blue-green on the face. Five
other immature males, taken from the same flock, possessed both the
red rump and yellow abdomen.
Seventeen birds, taken by the author near Canberra and at Bungen-
dore, N.S.W. in April this year, gave the following average

The interior portion of eastern Australia is the area inhabited by
this common species. Two subspecies have been described from within
this range.
In 1915 G. Mathews described Ps. haematonotus virescens from a
specimen taken in South Australia. This race was reported to differ
from the typical race in having the head darker green, and the yellow
of the abdomen with a more orange tinge. Range was given as South
Australia and Victoria. The author took a pair of birds at Morgan,
S.A. in February, 1962, and the male was paler in colour than the
eastern birds--the exact opposite to what Mathews described. The
variations in shades of colouring exhibited by the birds would make it
possible to find a male bird fitting the above description from almost
anywhere within the range. This subspecies is not valid.
For many years there were reports of a small " blue " parrot in the
arid interior of South Australia. In 1941 H. T. Condon described a
new subspecies of Ps. haematonotus that appeared to answer all these
reports and queries. Psephotus haematonotus caeruleus is a subspecies
inhabiting the interior of South Australia from Lake Eyre basin in the
south extending both westwards and northwards. It is readily distin-
guishable from the typical race by its smaller size and unusual colour.

Distribution of Red-backed Parrot (Psephotus haematonotus ).
The boundaries of the area inhabited by Ps. h. caeruleus have not been
reported.
It is a beautiful bird with the green and blue-green areas replaced by
a blue colour which has only slight remnants of green through it. All
the plumage is much paler than the typical race and it could be said
that this race is a bird with a plumage of soft pastel colours. No
reference skins of the female of this race have yet been collected but,
through the assistance of Mr. H. T. Condon of the South Australian
Museum, the author was able to make a close examination of the two
existing male skins collected from Innamincka in South Australia. The
colour of this race fulfils expectations considering the arid and semi-
desert environmental factors acting upon the development of this
sub-species.
Most country people dwelling in the inner areas of the eastern states
of Australia are familiar with the flocks of the common Redrump, as
Ps. haematonotus is widely known. It is a frequent visitor to homesteads

and farm buildings, feeding on the fallen grain around barns, haystacks,
and even in fowl pens. The fact that this species spends most of its time
on the ground is borne out by the two common names given it by
most people--Grass Parrot and Ground Parrot. However, as these
names more usually apply to a different genus and a distinct unique
species respectively, they should be discouraged for the Red-backed
Parrot.
It is found mostly on the ground, over which the flock moves in a
manner not unlike a flock of sandpipers on a tidal flat. A flock of these j
birds feeding under the gum trees provides a scene of intense activity ,
as the individuals dart here and there and undertake short flights of !
a few feet to the shade of the neighbouring tree. Soon after sunrise
the flocks make their way to their usual watering places, such as dams, j
tanks, irrigation channels, house gutterings, rivers, streams, and even
parkland fountains, and then wing their way to their feeding grounds
on the plains, by the roadside, near the farmyard, by the haystack or
in the stubble of the cereal crop. After feeding has ceased they retire
to the upper leafless branches of a suitable gum tree, or to fence wires,
where they spend many hours sidling up to one another or, in the
latter case, chasing each other from the fence posts keeping up a
constant chatter all the time.
The Red-backed Parrot is a bird of the open forest, open plain, or
mallee country, but never penetrates into the deep woodland or
mountain areas. It is this liking for sparsely timbered grasslands that
keeps it west of the mountain ranges away from the coastal areas. It
does, however, reach the open forest country of the tablelands and in
times of severe drought makes its way to the coastal fringes, many j
records existing for the western suburbs of Sydney. In the Southern
Alps, as far as the author can judge by observations, it seems to be
limited to areas below 3,000 feet altitude, slightly lower than that j
limiting the Eastern Rosella ( Platycercus eximius). Within its range it
generally remains reasonably close to watercourses. In the drier areas
it gives way to the Blue-bonnet ( Psephotus haematogaster) and the Mulga
Parrot (Ps. varius ).
The food of the Redrump consists of seeds of grasses and other plants,
with grit and small pieces of charcoal being taken to aid digestion. It
rarely partakes of berries or gum tips, but green matter in the form of
thistles of various kinds and Crowsfoot ( Erodium botrys ) is always
eaten. It has been reported as eating the berries of the introduced
Pepper tree ( Schimus molle ), picking them up from the ground under
the tree, as opposed to the Eastern Rosella, which eats the growing
berries on the tree. The stomach of a male Ps. haematonotus taken by
E. Ashby at Red Hill, South Australia, in 1935, contained vegetable
matter smelling strongly of eucalyptus. This bird, in the opinion of the
author, was an exceptional case. The crop and stomach contents of

Small pieces of vegetable matter and grit were also found. It can be
seen from the above list that the Red-backed Parrot is entirely a ground
feeder confined to seeds found on the ground.
When perched in the green foliage of a tree or when feeding on the
ground, the colour of both sexes blends extremely well with the sur-
roundings making them difficult to detect. It is, however, easy to
approach when feeding on the ground and thus many fall easy prey
to cats and other predators. Hawks and falcons also find this bird easy
prey. An interesting scene was witnessed by the author at Kambah,
A.C.T. in February, 1962, when a Brown Hawk (Falco berigora ) came
within 200 feet of a flock of Ps. haematonotus perched on the leafless
upper branches of two neighbouring gum trees, waiting to go to drink
at a nearby dam. As soon as the hawk was sighted the whole flock
left the tree and surrounded the intruder screeching all the while. The
hawk, alarmed at this warlike attack, and finding himself surrounded
in flight by approximately 200 screeching parrots, made a hasty retreat
pursued for a few hundred yards by the band of " hostile warriors ".
Although the hawk, in this case, was a species not likely to attack the
birds, it was most interesting to note their behaviour.
Observations readily show that, although of a highly gregarious
nature, this species remains paired within the flocks. While perched
in their roosting trees during the day, the males will often be seen
sidling towards their mates. The pairs will often be seen chattering
to each other and indulging in mutual preening, this species being one
of the very few of the Australian parrots possessing this habit. However,
if one of a pair is killed the survivor quickly remates with another
unmated bird from the flock. About mid-August these affectionate
activities take on a new intensity as the males can be observed chasing
the females over the ground until the latter fly into a tree. The insis-
tent cock bird follows alighting on the same perch and sidling towards
the hen, to whom he directs his display.

JOSEPH M. FORSHAW-THE PARROTS OF AUSTRALIA
The mating display of Ps. haematonotus does not differ in many respects
from that described for Platycercus sp. in the previous articles. The
male stretches his neck and bobs his head up and down chattering all
the while. The wings are lowered in the folded position, while the
spread tail is vibrated quickly from side to side. A short while later
this same display is used when the male feeds his mate with regurgi-
tated food. It seems evident that this action serves a double function
of display and the facilitation of regurgitating the food. Both sexes
use this action when feeding the nestlings. There are many reports
of attempted copulation on the part of the male after feeding his mate
while she is brooding. Although the author has over the past years
observed many nesting pairs he has never seen this take place. There
is no doubt, however, that this does happen and its occurrence strongly
underlines the double function of the display, namely to ease regurgita-
tion and in courtship.
When selecting a nesting site the breeding pair have to face two
formidable opponents in the Starling (.Sturnus vulgaris) and the House
Sparrow (Passer domesticus). These introduced birds are a menace to
all the Australian parrots, and because of their absorbing numerous
suitable nesting hollows, must be regarded as a most serious threat to
the maintenance of numbers by many of the parrot-like birds. Indeed
one instance is given of a House Sparrow building its nest in a hollow
already containing three freshly-laid eggs of the Red-backed Parrot.
A full investigation into this situation at an early date is definitely
warranted.
The male bird examines the proposed nesting site and spends the
next few days forcing his mate to enter the selected hollow limb or
hole in a tree. Being a highly gregarious bird the nests are usually in
close proximity to each other. In spite of this the strong territorial
defences of nesting pairs are maintained. When a tree contains only
one nest that tree is defended, but when a tree contains two or more
nests only the limb or part of the trunk in the immediate area of the
nest is defended. The whole breeding season, which usually lasts from
late August to December with some variations in the western parts of
the distribution range where rainfall is a deciding factor, becomes a
period of constant noise and territorial squabbling.
The nesting site chosen is a hollow limb or hole in the tree at variable
height from the ground. The bottom of the hollow is lined with decayed
wood on which are laid four to seven, usually five, white eggs, which
may quickly become nest stained. An average egg would be -95 in. by
*73 in. The eggs are laid at approximately 48 hour intervals and
incubation, which lasts about three weeks, commences after the laying
of the second egg. The hen only incubates and is fed by her mate at ;
approximately hourly intervals. The female sits very tightly and the
author has found, when examining many nests, that she will not leave

until the very last minute and will sometimes even wait to be lifted
from the nest.
When the male feeds his sitting mate he does not do so at the hollow
entrance. He approaches the nest calling and chattering and alights
near the hollow. The female leaves the nest and flies with the cock to
a nearby branch where he feeds her regurgitated food, using the display
described previously. It is at this stage that the attempted copulation
has been reported to have taken place.
On 16th October, i960, the author found a nest of this species near
Murrumbateman, N.S.W. This nest contained three newly hatched
nestlings and one egg. The almost daily inspections and observations
on the nest gave the general picture that is outlined here. The author's
observations agree in most aspects with those published by other
authors. All young had been hatched on 17th October.
Newly-hatched nestlings are naked and helpless with large bills.
Grey down appears after a couple of days followed by the gradual
acquisition of feathers. For the first few days of their lives they are
brooded very closely by the hen bird and fed by her on food brought
by the male. When feeding her brood, the female uses the same method
of regurgitating food as described previously. Later the cock bird
shares the domestic duties and commences to feed the young. When
the cock birds of breeding pairs are thus engaged, the flock reaches its
lowest numerical strength because previously all the males had continued
to flock together, while their mates carried the burdens of brooding.
The nestling stage is of approximately four weeks duration. In the
nest under observation by the author one youngster, presumably the
first hatched, left the nest after twenty-nine days but had returned
the next day. The following day three had left the nest, but the remaining
nestling, presumably the last hatched, remained for another two days
thus giving the overall time between thirty- and thirty-two days from
the estimated hatching date.
The immature birds remain with the parents and can be readily
distinguished in flight by their " wing-stripe ". These white lines on
the underside of the wings are lost by all males on completing their
moult giving mature plumage, while all hens retain them.
The flight of Ps. haematonotus is reasonably straight and swift with
some undulation, but not as much as in the flight of the Platycercus sp.
It is interesting to note that this species, although a ground-feeding
bird, usually flies at considerable heights compared with the larger
members of Platycercinae. While in flight a pleasant call is always
employed.
The call is a pleasing trill-like whistle which is almost a tune.
A double shrill whistle note is also employed by this bird. When
squabbling or defending their territory a grating chatter is used.
Ps. haematonotus was the subj'ect of an interesting happening reported

by Mr. E. Ashby of Adelaide. Prior to 1887 the Red-backed Parrot
was one of the commonest parrots found in the Adelaide Hills. In that
year, however, a disease struck this species whereby no feathers were
renewed after moulting. As a result of this, naked birds were found
running in most paddocks and falling easy prey to all predators. Apart i
from the absence of feathers the birds appeared quite healthy. So
complete was the destruction of the species that none was found for
several years and in fact they were still quite rare twenty years later.
This disease, which is described as French moult in cage birds, was
never previously known in the wild state.
On account of its abundance in the eastern states, the Red-backed
Parrot is not a common aviary bird in Australia and few aviculturists :
attempt to breed it. However it is found in some aviaries and is an
interesting attraction, the fully matured male being a truly beautiful
bird. In spite of its size it may even outdo its larger relatives as regards
a pugnacious character. It cannot be trusted in a mixed collection
and becomes very vicious towards other species and towards its own
during breeding season.
Breeding in captivity is comparatively simple, and provided reason-
able care and attention is given, success is generally the end result. Breed-
ing pairs should be isolated and given two hollow logs or nesting-boxes.
There are records of birds rearing broods in tunnels in the earth,
under boxes intended as refuges for quail, and other odd places. As I
this species is often double brooded and the cock becomes hostile
towards the young when the hen commences the second sitting, all &apos;
young should be removed as soon as they can fend for themselves.
Many hybrids with this species have been bred in captivity. Two
very interesting records were the breeding of hybrids with the Mallee
Ringneck Parrot ( Barnardius harnardi) and the Western Rosella ( Platy -
cercus icterotis) . These birds were bred in the London Zoological
Gardens. There are scattered records of hybrids between this species
and the Eastern Rosella [Platycercus eximius) occurring in the wild state.
The most deliberate use of hybridization with this species occurred in
many countries at the turn of the century. At this time single specimens
of considerable rarity were reaching some aviculturists. These birds
were the rarer members of the genus and this species was often used
to complete a breeding pair. Many hybrids with such birds as the
Golden-shouldered Parrot [Ps. chrysopterygius) were thus bred.
Aviculturists have succeeded in breeding a yellow variety of this
bird. These results lead one to wonder whether, in years to come, the
stage will be reached where the variety of colours will be as wide as
that of another Australian parrot--the Budgerigar ( Melopsittacus
undulatus ).
The diet recommended for aviary birds is a mixture of plain Canary
seed, sunflower seed, millet and a little hemp when this is obtainable.

Oats does not appear to agree with this species. Sprays of seeding
grasses are always appreciated. A plentiful supply of green food is
essential especially if breeding is to be carried out. Fruit will rarely,
if ever, be eaten.
A popular and cheerful bird, Psephotus haematonotus is a happy inhabi-
tant of the Australian farmlands. It is to be hoped that the large flocks
will always be a familiar sight in the eastern states. The Red-backed
Parrot is yet another intriguing member of Australia's most fascinating
bird group.

After reading of the distribution of the Crimson Rosella in the
accompanying text the inaccuracy of this map will have been apparent
to all. The western and interior portions of Victoria, and the interior
of eastern South Australia are not inhabited by this bird. A coastal
distribution area applies to both states, as given in the paper.

FEEDING OF A JAVA FINCH (Padda oryzivora ) BY A
DOMESTICATED CANARY (Serinus canarius).

A female Java Finch which had been given no opportunity to breed
for at least five years, if ever, was housed alone in a standard commer-
cial Canary cage for several months. A male Canary (sex of both
birds determined by laparotomy) was placed in the cage with the Java
Finch at the end of May, 1961, after being removed from a breeding
programme in which he had participated (Dunham and Clapp, 1962).
The Canary was, and has been, almost continuously in song ; the
daily photoperiod, although irregular, was normally in excess of twelve
hours. The Java Finch was at first dominant over the Canary, judging
by encounters at food and water, and by perch occupancy. After the
first month together the Canary was generally dominant. About four
months later the first attempts on the part of the Canary to " feed "
the Java Finch were observed. The Canary would approach the finch
and attempt to touch the finch's bill with its own, giving a vocalization
characteristic of the situation. The reaction of the finch was either to
" ignore " the Canary, sometimes allowing him to touch bills, or to
turn toward him and make biting intention movements. About five
months after the attempts at feeding began, the finch attacked the
Canary and drew blood from one wing. I did not see any attempts on
the Canary's part at feeding for another month, but after he had
resumed the finch participated more actively, and frequently was seen to
take small bits (probably broken seeds) from the Canary and mandibu-
late them in movements of small amplitude, bill-wiping afterward.

It was once seen to accept a small piece of lettuce from the Canary.
About nine months after the first attempt at feeding was noticed, the
Canary mounted the finch and remained for twenty seconds on her
back, wing-flicking for balance. The finch showed no overt aggression but
rather sat quite still. After the Canary dismounted both birds preened
extensively and bill-wiped. Mounting has been seen several times since.
Although cardueline finches courtship feed, estrildine finches do not
(Andrew, 1961). It is perhaps not surprising that a male cardueline
in sexual condition, and isolated from more closely-related birds,
would attempt to feed an estrildine, but it does seem remarkable that
an estrildine would learn to respond positively to such a behaviour.
The movitation for this learning is not clear, but it is possible that by
answering the bill touching of the Canary with a small amplitude bite
some food may have been taken by the Java Finch, and that this
provided sufficient motivation to bring about actual participation by
the Java Finch in the feeding ceremony.

Members who read the account of the successful breeding of the
Indian White-eye (^osterops palpehrosa) at liberty in north Norfolk in
1961 (antea vol. 68, p. 51) may remember that at the beginning of 1962
I had two new true pairs with which I hoped to repeat the experiment.
Pair " A " (male, red ring left leg ; female, black ring left leg) was
released via the exit hole in the wire-netting of the aviary flight on
24th April, 1962, and at once disappeared. A complete fiasco !
Pair " B " (male, white ring right leg ; female, white ring left leg)
was kept in confinement until 8th June on which day the female was
released, much to her mate's consternation and remained in the
neighbourhood, being a constant visitor to the nectar tube provided
for her. The male was allowed to join her ten days later by which time
she had, I believe, built a nest " single-handed " and laid eggs, in a
small wood some 100 yards away though this was never actually located.
These eggs were naturally infertile but the birds wasted no time and
duly constructed another nest in the same wood which I discovered on
31st July when both birds of the pair visited the aviary together for
the first time, the male carrying in his bill a white faecal sac which he

wiped off on the washing line before flying to the nectar. Soon one
of the parents flew directly to the tiny spherical hammock slung to
the leaf-stems beneath the lowest bough of a lofty elm and at least
25 feet from the ground. By standing well back and watching through
binoculars I could see the heads of three nestlings pop up quivering with
open mouths at each visit by the parents. With the unbroken feather-
buds darkening their heads they were judged to be about six days old.
On 4th August two of the chicks were sitting preening themselves
on the rim of the nest and by the next day they had flown up into the
neighbouring trees leaving the third, and rather smaller chick in the
nest where it was deserted and subsequently died.
7th August was a foul day of driving rain and a force 6-7 north-west
wind and I was relieved to discover the two surviving fledglings
huddled together well down in the undergrowth and being fed
repeatedly by the adults.
At about this time I became aware of a cock White-eye singing in
the garden, and puzzled to think that the chicks' father had the time
to spend in idle singing, went to investigate. Imagine my surprise to
find male " A " back again after an absence of fifteen weeks. One can
only speculate on the fate of his mate and his journeyings during the
time he was away.
The young " twins " were seldom seen at this stage being well
hidden high up in the canopy of the tallest trees but the parents were in
and out of the garden all and every day and began to carry off frag-
ments of sweet apple and small pieces of raw minced beef, towering
high above the rooftops with boundless energy.
Male " B " did not approve of male " A " sharing his territory and
many were the minor scuffles and angry bill-snappings which ensued
when they met at the nectar.
On 21 st August the youngsters accompanied their parents back to
the garden for the first time and on the 26th all five birds were coming
to the feeder.
With the previous year's losses prominent in my memory I decided
to admit the birds to the aviary for the winter and within half an hour
all five had passed through the pop-hole to the safety of the flight and
there they are to-day, the two adult males still pulling faces at each
other but rapidly settling down.
From their behaviour the two juveniles would seem to be a true pair
and they are already inseparably attached to each other. I must
colour-ring them in due course, so they can take their place among the
local avifauna next spring and perhaps rear a brood of their own as
pair " C ".
Should any reader have a spare female as a mate for male " A "
I would be very glad of the opportunity of purchasing it. Please write
to me at Hill-Top, Cley, Holt, Norfolk.

In October, 1961 I was lucky to get a pair of these beautiful birds.
They were in excellent condition, and although the male was in
juvenile dress, he assumed the adult plumage, blue and black in the
winter. They were very peaceful in the aviary, and later in the winter
the male began feeding the female, especially when mealworms were
accessible. In April the female began carrying nesting material and
on 11 th May she had decided on a wicker nesting-basket 2 * 5 metres
from the ground in the indoor aviary. The male followed the female
when she was building, uttering his call note all the time, but did not
help in building the nest. On 15th May there was an egg, bluish white
with small brown spots. On the same date the female started brooding,
and the male was feeding her both in the nest and outside it. On 26th
May a newly hatched young, yellowish red with little down, lay in
the nest. During the first days I am sure only the female was feeding
the young, but later on the male was eagerly helping her. The food
was regurgitated. On 7th June the birds were chasing a Mousebird
and on the 8th the male began chasing the female and she was not
allowed to feed the young or get in the nest. But miraculously the
male succeeded in both feeding the young and keeping the female
away from the nest. On 13th June the youngster left the nest as a
small, greyish-green bird with a short tail but it was so strong that from
the first day it could find its way from the indoor to the outdoor
aviary and back again. The male continued to feed the young until
about 10th July and on the 13th the youngster tried to sing for the
first time. Now, in September, he is as large as the parents, and still
wearing the juvenile dress. As food for these birds I use eggs, fruits,
mealworms, small insects and honeywater.
The call-signal is a sharp tsit, the song is not very interesting, a few
sharp twittering notes with the beak pointed upwards and hanging
wings.
A. F. Skutch writes in his book : Life Histories of Central American
Birds (1943) that he has not heard the bird sing, and he believes that
there is no nuptial feeding.

In recent years the Cattle Egrets, Buff-backed Herons or Tick
Birds, as Buhulcus ibis ibis is variously known, have made a number of
unsuccessful attempts at nesting but at last a chick has been reared--
at least it is now walking unsteadily about the branches close by the
nest, though is not yet able to fly. There are five adult birds in the
Great Aviary and the rather scanty twig nests are always built at about
io feet from the ground in privet and other bushes. If this chick is fully
reared it would appear to be the first breeding in this country.
In the same aviary a Green-backed X Grey-headed Gallinule has
also been bred. The male parent, received in 1950, crossed with a
Grey-headed in 1957, the resulting chick's adult plumage being very
like that of the father, but the bird is distinguishable by its smaller
size. The present young one is becoming green on the back.
A Sarus Crane was hatched at the end of August, a second dying
soon after getting out from the egg. Black Swans have two cygnets i
and a second Princess of Wales 5 Parrakeet has been bred.
The Eagle-Owl from the Amani Forest already mentioned in
previous Notes is identified as Bubo vosseleri (or B. poensis vosseleri).
The common name used by Sclater (Syst. Av. Aethiop ., 1930) and by
Mackworth-Praed and Grant (Bds of E. and JV. E. Africa , 1952) would
appear inappropriate and came evidently from the name used by
Bates ( Handbook of Bds of W. Africa , 1930) for what is now known as
Fraser's Eagle-Owl, Bubo poensis. Bates says, " About the sound it
makes I have only native testimony ; that the fact that it has a separate
name, JVduk , while all other Owls are called Akung is due to its slightly
higher-pitched voice (nduk in Bulu has a higher tone than akung) J&apos;
The white egrets also mentioned previously are now identified as
Little Egrets ( Egretta garzetta garzetta).
A Brown-hooded Kingfisher ( Halcyon albiventris) , presented by
Lady Baillie, is a species new to the collection. Other arrivals of
particular interest are a Southern White-breasted Crake, two Black-
winged Stilts, two White-eared Fruit Doves ( Phapitreron leucotis ), a
Long-tailed Parrakeet ( Psittacula longicauda) , a Lilac-breasted Roller,
two Blue Whistling Thrushes and a pair of Rufous-chinned Laughing
Thrushes. The Fruit Doves were sent from Hong Kong by Dr. K. C.
Searle, but the species is, of course, from the Philippine Islands, five
races from different islands being recognized.
A Common Hangnest presented during 1935 has recently died : its
age at the time of arrival is not known.

writes : " The cock of my old breeding pair died during the winter.
Another cock which I was able to borrow from a friend savagely
attacked the hen in his attempts to drive her to nest and, although she
was rescued just in time, she has been unable to fly ever since. A very
young pair had three clutches of fertile eggs but were unsuccessful in
rearing any youngsters. A third pair, consisting of the cock and hen
which I hand-reared last year, produced three excellent young birds
in April but the hen died when her second brood were only a few days
old."

His own parrakeet results for the 1961-62 breeding season are :
Nyasa Lovebird, nests of one, two and four reared. Peach-faced
Lovebird, two nests of four reared, after a clutch of infertile eggs.
Bourke Parrakeet, a young pair reared two. Turquoisine, nine young
reared in two nests. Blue-winged, nests of seven and three reared.
Many-coloured, nest of four reared. Red-rumped, two pairs reared six.
Mealy Rosella, only one reared, three more were killed in the nest by
other parrakeets. Yellow Rosella, three reared. Crimson Rosella, the
female was disturbed by swarming bees and deserted her five eggs.
Red Rosella, the female was disturbed and stung by bees ; the four
eggs were transferred to a pair of Golden-mantled Rosellas which
hatched them and reared the young together with two of their own.
Rainbow Lorikeet, a single young one reared ; a second pair killed
their young one. Budgerigar, wild, green type, two reared. Yellow-

FOREIGN BIRD KEEPING. By Edward J. Boosey (Second
Edition) Iliffe Books, Ltd., London. Price 70 j-. net.
This new and enlarged edition of Mr. Boosey's book (see Auicult. Mag.
!959, 62 : 2 : 87-8 for review of previous edition) is quite the best
general work on its subject that I have read. It is not, however, as is
stated on the dust jacket " a complete guide to breeding and manage-
ment " (italics mine) of all the species it deals with. On the contrary
Mr. Boosey, unlike some other writers on foreign birds, is most
scrupulous in telling us exactly how much or how little experience he
has had with each species. This honesty adds greatly to the practical
value of the book since the reader is not allowed to think that the
advice given is based on long experience of keeping and breeding a
species except where this is actually the case.
There are a few ornithological errors ; such as the distribution of the
" all-American " dove Claravis pretiosa being given as New Guinea.
My only feelings of disquiet on reading the book were at the rather
spartan diets recommended for some of the doves and waxbills.
The author's interest in and love of birds shines through the book.
Not the least interesting part of which is the autobiographical section.
Reading it one feels admiration for and sympathy with the young
man who, together with his partner, had the vision and determination
necessary to make such a lasting and many-sided success of his avi-
cultural activities and grieves with him at the passing of the years
now that he is no longer young.

ALABAMA BIRDS. By Thomas A. Imhof. University of Alabama
Press, Alabama, 1962. Price $7.50.
This is a detailed description of the 352 species of birds known in
Alabama, with colour illustrations by Richard A. Parks and Daniel G.
Hulse. There are also photographs of habitats and nests, maps showing
distribution and banding records, accounts of nesting and food habits,
the range of each species, and records of their occurrence in Alabama.
This is the first large publication produced by the Game and Fish
Division of the Alabama Department of Conservation and has been
prepared in response to the many requests for a book on the identifica-
tion and life-histories of Alabama's birds. The result is a most attrac-
tive volume produced at a very reasonable price. The introductory
chapters include preparation for bird observation, the history of
ornithology in Alabama, the physiography of the State, and laws
concerning birds, migration, and banding. There are also common
names of Alabama birds, dates of breeding, and migration, ways to
attract and observe birds, the construction and siting of feeding and
nest-boxes, and reporting recoveries of banded birds.
Whilst this book is intended primarily for bird-watchers, aviculturists
will find much of interest, for many of the species have become well
known in aviaries.
