The Medal may be awarded at the discretion of the Committee to any
Member who shall succeed in breeding, in the United Kingdom, any species of
bird which shall not be known to have been previously bred in captivity in Great
Britain or Ireland. Any Member wishing to obtain the Medal must send a detailed
account for publication in the Magazine within about eight weeks from the date
of hatching of the young, and furnish such evidence of the facts as the Executive
Committee may require. The Medal will be awarded only in cases where the
young shall live to be old enough to feed themselves, and to be wholly independent
of their parents. No medal can be given for the breeding of hybrids, or of local
races or sub-species of species that have already been bred.
The account of the breeding must be reasonably full so as to afford
instruction to our Members, and must appear in the Avicultural Magazine
before it is published or notified elsewhere. It should describe the plumage of
the young, and be of value as a permanent record of the nesting and general habits of the
species. These points will have great weight when the question of awarding the
Medal is under consideration.
In every case the decision of the Committee shall be final.
The Medal will be forwarded to each Member as soon after it shall have
been awarded as possible.
The Medal is struck in bronze (but the Committee reserve the right to issue
it in silver in very special cases) and measures &lt;2.\ inches in diameter. It bears on
the obverse a representation of two birds with a nest containing eggs, and the
words " The Avicultural Society--founded 1894 ". On the reverse is the following
inscription : " Awarded to [ name of recipient ] for rearing the young of [name of
species ], a species not previously bred in captivity in the United Kingdom."
The Council may grant a special medal to any member who shall succeed
in breeding any species of bird that has not previously been bred in captivity in
Europe.

Three Cassowaries are at present on exhibition in the Zoo
here, all of which differ from any of the very fine coloured illustra-
tions published in igoi by the late Lord Rothschild (T.^A.,
pp. 109-148), so that some account of them may be of interest.
They belong to two different species, C. casuarius and C. unappendi-
culatus , but the subspecific identifications present some difficulties.
They are depicted in the accompanying plate.
The C. casuarius appears to be fairly easily identified as an
example of C. c. sclateri (d'Albertis's Cassowary) on account of its
huge size and characteristic form of its casque, the coloration of
its neck, and the extraordinarily long wattles. It is a large bird
and has proved its sex by laying a large number of beautiful
emerald green eggs. The eggs have a reticulated surface texture,
with the ground colour paler green than the raised reticulations.
The eggs average 138 mm. long by 89*14 mm. broad, but vary
between a maximum of 153 mm. in length and 92 mm. in breadth
and a minimum of 130 mm. long and 85 mm. broad, but the
shape varies, so that the egg with maximum length is not necessarily
of maximum breadth. The earlier laid eggs are more rounded
and better coloured, whilst the last few become progressively
paler, of more chalky surface texture, and more elongated in shape.
This bird was originally obtained from New Guinea by the
late John Hagenbeck, of Colombo. It is supposed to inhabit the

Fly River district of that island. When it first arrived it was in
poor condition and we expected to lose the bird from vitamin A
deficiency ; it had no colour but a dirty brown on its neck and was
quite blind from xerophthalmia. Forcible feeding with empty
banana skins filled with cod-liver oil effected complete recovery,
and the bird is now a very fine exhibit with glowing colours on
its neck.
The other two Cassowaries are both the same kind, though
differing slightly in certain details, which are partly the effect of
age and possibly partly individual. They were purchased four
years ago from Albert Meems, of Rotterdam, who was passing
through Colombo after a collecting trip in New Guinea. They
were then both young birds in brown plumage, though the larger
one soon showed signs of changing to black. This one is now
completely black, the younger one has still a few brown feathers
on the hinder part of its flanks, though both specimens have
completely developed their cervical coloration. The following is
a detailed description :--
Casque of the usual C. unappendiculatus type, compressed behind,
more so in the younger specimen, greenish horn colour, greener
behind than in front, more so in the younger than in the older
bird ; beak brownish horn colour with a yellow strip along the
mid dorsal line and yellow margins to the gape ; iris light ochre,
much paler than in C. c. sclateri, which has a dark brown iris. The
naked skin above the eye is dark blue, becoming paler to sky blue
posteriorly, which colour extends half-way down the back of the
neck, except for a semilunar occipital patch which is brownish
orange in hue. The throat, including the large bilobed dilatable
cheek pouches, is bright purple, almost violet, merging dorsally
into the sky blue of the back of the neck, but sharply defined just
below the hyoid region from the crimson skin of the lower neck.
This crimson patch is continued below into the lateral pear-shaped
expansion of coarsely carunculated skin which is flanked by feathers
on either side. This last area is mainly cerise in colour, but is bordered
anteriorly by bright orange. A bright orange patch completes the
picture at the root of the neck dorsally. The wattle is a median
continuation of the ventral crimson patch, but is margined with
slaty blue.
The above description is matched nearest by that of C. u.

<bodyText confidence="0.982507896551724" page_id="56350426"  page_num="3" year="" vol="">
to the base of the wattle.
It agrees with C. u, rufotinctus in the colour of the head, face, and
occiput and in that of the sides of the lower neck, with its anterior
yellow border.
We therefore surmise that we are dealing with examples of the
subspecies suffusus , the Deep Red-tinted One-wattled Cassowary,
described by Rothschild in another contribution (Bull. Br.O.C .,
xiv, p. 39, 1904)5 which is unfortunately not available here. It may,
on the other hand, be rothschildi described by Matschie (J. fur
Ornithologies 1901, p. 268), which is likewise not to be found in
any library in Ceylon.
Aviculturally, as Rothschild discovered, the birds are very
difficult to cope with, as they are terrible fighters. Meems told us
that individuals of the same species will always fight when kept
together, but that it would be safe for us to purchase individuals
of different species and they would then agree. If this state of
affairs occurs in nature, one wonders how Cassowaries ever manage
to perpetuate their kind at all. As a matter of fact we did manage
to keep, for a time, one of our unappendiculatus with the female
C. c. sclateri, but as all eggs proved infertile it was suspected that
both birds were of the same sex and accordingly instructions were
given for the other bird to be tried with the known female. This
led to a general brawl wherein one C. unappendiculatus kicked the
other into a pond and the female sclateri was chased out of the
paddock altogether. All three have now to be kept separately,
at any rate for the time being.
We are indebted to Mr. W. R. Hobday, Government Agent,
Western Province, for permission to publish these observations
on the Zoo's Cassowaries.

(Granatina granatina)
By H. S. Sewell
When in need of a little relaxation, to me a seat in the little
rustic arbor inside my garden aviary provides the correct tonic,
for from there I have a full view of all the " goings on ".
Nothing delights me more than a glimpse of a glorious little
bird of rich brown, whose upper tail coverts are royal blue, has
face patches of dazzling violet, and is graced with a beak of coral
red, but all this poorly describes the beauty of the little Violet-
eared Waxbill. The colouring of his spouse in turn is mainly a
lovely soft fawn but darker above, and together with her paler
violet cheeks makes a striking contrast to her lord and master.
When in a courting mood he slightly expands his violet ear patches,
which action undoubtably attracts the attention of both hen and
human who might be watching.
Although these beautiful Waxbills have been kept by avicultura-
lists for many years, I only know of one authentic published record
of them having been bred in captivity. From memory this was
achieved by an English breeder some three years back, but
unfortunately the young only survived long enough for her to
secure the Breeders' Medal. In any case I consider this an achieve-
ment of outstanding merit, as I believe that adverse climatic
conditions, as compared to ours here in Australia or other temperate
zones, would make the breeding task over there even more difficult. 1
I must confess that I have been trying to breed these Waxbills
for several years but without success, at first I had great difficulty
in acclimatizing them. Just prior to this war a good friend of mine
in South Africa was kind enough to let me have one of his best
pairs of Violet-ears, and when they settled down one could see at
a glance what beauties they really were. Accompanying these
were two pairs of Hartlaub's Twin Spotted Waxbills, rarities
second to none in my aviaries, but more of these later.

1 The Violet-eared Waxbill was bred in England by Mrs. K. Drake in
1936, the young birds living to be able to feed themselves, though they died when
8 to weeks old (Avicultural Magazine, 1936, p. 326).-- Ed.

The season before last this pair of Violets began nesting, an
event which caused me no end of excitement, but also a series of
disappointments. The first nest proved to be infertile, but by
changing the birds to another aviary the next nest was a little more
promising, as two eggs were fertile, but the chicks were dead in
the shell. In the third nest a young Violet-ear was actually hatched,
but thrown out when two days old as were most of the young in
subsequent nests, totalling eight for the season. By this time
I found that these birds required an unlimited supply of small
live food, as they appeared to consume far more than various other
Waxbills ; also they would brook no interference whilst nesting,
in fact displayed alarm when being viewed from a distance.
These observations undoubtedly cost me a few nests, but hatching
data had to be noted.
Last season this same pair of Violet-ears started off in fine style,
and with the previous experience my optimism as usual ran riot,
but ended in failure. Only once did I have them nearly " in the
bag ", this was when two plump little youngsters were just breaking
their quill feathers. A severe rainstorm in the night ended my hopes.
The next morning revealed my fears, for their nest was saturated
and the little inmates just alive, it looked as though their cold-
hearted parents had forgotten their existence, for not the slightest
attention did they give them full knowing, I guess, that they
were beyond repair. I might mention here that the hen Violet-
ear does not cover the young at night after the twelfth night from
hatching, and obviously this is a very critical stage in the case of
bad weather as foretold.
Another interesting mannerism of the Violet-ears and which is
sometimes observed with the other Waxbills when sitting, is what
I call " the changing of the guards ". Usually the hen picks up a
feather and flies near to her nest : this is a definite signal which
means " Ain't yer cornin' out ? " ; his lordship obliges, in fact it
never fails.
The greatest surprise I had in connection with my favourite
Waxbills was one day when in a different aviary from the old
birds I saw a strange young fully fledged bird. On inspection I found
without a doubt that it was actually a healthy young Violet-eared
Waxbill. My surprise will be appreciated, for at the moment
I had fully forgotten that I had distributed a setting of these

WaxbilPs eggs between some birds, probably Pytelias, some six
weeks before. The young Violet-ear resembled an adult hen,
although lacking the violet ear patches, but the royal blue tail
coverts were in evidence. It being a Sunday I anticipated a very
interesting day observing, but unfortunately there was very little
to be seen, other than the little Violet-ear begging for food from
a couple of different Waxbills, but nary a one would take the
slightest notice of it. Being an optimist I was hoping that at any
minute the rightful foster-parents would take compassion on it,
but as time proceeded I gathered, too late, that this little rarity
was an outcast. It is now obvious that the mysterious foster-parents
realized that the " changes had been rung " on them as soon as
the youngster left the nest, and promptly deserted it. Naturally,
had I known as much as I do now, early that morning I would
certainly have tried my luck at hand-feeding. Reared to this stage
it is actually the first Violet-eared young to have left the nest
over this way.
A little later in the autumn of this year I separated this
magnificent pair of Violet-ears, on account of the approaching
cold weather, for I feared that the hen might become egg bound.
Up to that time this pair had had nine nests for the season, pretty
near a record I should imagine. However, bad luck still dogged
me, for soon after this superb cock Violet contracted white diarrhoea,
a malady which I have never been able to cure in Finches at this
stage, although given heat, tincture of opium, and other reputed
cures.
At the time of writing, being on the verge of our 1941-2 breeding
season, my hen Violet-ear is again at the top of her form and singing
merrily as the hens of this species frequently do. Alas ! I am afraid
that she will have to remain a widow for the present as I do not
think a mate is procurable for her in Australia, and so ends my
sad but eventful experience with my favourite Waxbills.

GROWING BIRD SEED in GREAT BRITAIN
By D. Seth-Smith
When the usual supply of bird seed, especially canary and
millet, failed, various substitutes were tried with only very moderate
success. In the case of Finches and Budgerigars foods other than
the usual seeds were generally taken after a time though a good
many birds were lost by too sudden a change. With Grassfinches
and Waxbills there was more difficulty as they generally refused
all substitutes, and, I fear, many died.
In a broadcast talk early last spring I suggested that those
who kept seed-eating birds and, at the same time, had some spare
ground in their gardens, should try growing seed themselves.
I was sure that canary seed would do well if sown early, but was
not so certain about the various kinds of millet. However, from
letters received this past autumn, it appears that some people
have been successful, though millet is more difficult to ripen than
canary.
One lady, writing from Brockenhurst on 3rd October, says :
" I have grown about three dozen millet sprays which are full of
seed and firm, but are still green. Will they ripen out of doors
or shall I cut them and hang them up to finish ? The seed was
sown in boxes in a greenhouse and when quite large plants, trans-
planted out of doors. I have also grown other seed which has
been quite successful and I enclose a sample." The sample con-
sisted of very good and ripe canary seed.

Another letter, dated 8th October, comes from Richmond,
Surrey. The writer says : 44 I took your advice in early spring to
sow millet seed with happy results. I had got disheartened with
Budgerigars dying and others not satisfied. I was fortunate enough
to buy a 4 d. spray last February and planted a few seeds in my
allotment. This week I have garnered a sheaf of sprays, some
measuring a foot in length. The seed is well matured and my
Budgerigars are enjoying it immensely. Very many thanks for
your advice."
One correspondent sent me a spray of seed quite different in
appearance from the spray millet, the seeds being much more
separated. I do not know the appearance of white millet when
growing though the seeds looked like it, but they were not ripe.
Other samples came of a type of millet growing in small upright
heads or sprays 2 to 3 inches long. I sent a sample to Kew and
received a most kind letter from the Director, my friend the late
Sir Arthur Hill, whose tragic death a few weeks later was such a
shock to his numerous friends. Here is an extract : 44 The specimen
you sent me with your letter of 17th October is Setaria itolica ,
the Italian Millet. This is a common ingredient in bird seeds and
an important cereal in the Tropics and Subtropics. If the seed
is sown early in the spring the heads will ripen their seed satis-
factorily in our climate. We have plants in the Herbaceous ground
which have grown well and ripened their seed this year."
So it would seem that to grow both canary and millet seed in
this country is quite a feasible proposition, though to grow enough
for a large collection of birds would require a good deal of space.
For one or two birds, however, it would be best to sow millet seed
in boxes in a moderately warmed greenhouse or garden frame in
February or March and to plant out the seedlings in May, placing
the plants 6 inches apart in rows 12 inches apart.
Canary seed can be sown in the open in late March or April,
but must be protected from the wild birds, the best protection
being strands of black cotton stretched about 2 inches from the
ground.

By A. H. Scott
Last year I mentioned in some notes on my aviaries, the breeding
of three hybrids, a cock and two hens, the parents being a Blue-
breasted Chinese Bullfinch cock ( P . griseiventris) and a British hen.
Of these young birds the cock, which had a mauve breast, was
mated this year to one of his sisters (indistinguishable from a
British hen), the other sister being mated to her father. The first
pair had in their first nest four eggs, of which three were clear,
while the fourth contained a young one which died a day or two
before hatching. Their second nest again produced four eggs,
of which one was clear, and in the other three the embryos died
at about the eleventh day. As it seemed that the brother-sister
mating might be a cause of the failure, a wild cock, captured only
a month before, was put in his place. The hen showed no objection :
indeed she mated with him instantly. Four eggs were laid and all
hatched. The young birds were vigorous, but one was drowned
on leaving the nest, and the other two came to grief later. The
survivor is a cock showing no trace of his quarter of oriental blood
except a scarcely perceptible tinge of mauve in the breast.
The father-daughter pair had only one nest. As this hen sat
as close as an old fowl, merely getting on my hand when I slipped
it beneath her, no proper examination was made, but there were
either two or three young. At the end of five days only one remained,
very poorly fed, so afterwards I fed it, additionally, myself twice
a day until at ten days old it was a fine strong young bird, and
I thought it possible to leave the nest alone, as visiting the aviaries
was very difficult for me, owing to an injury to my knee which
was pierced by the sharp heel of a skate in a heavy fall on the ice
last winter. However, a few days later the young bird was dead,
evidently from starvation. Meanwhile a second mate, an ordinary
British hen, had been introduced, but although this menage a trois
lived quite peaceably together, the second hen produced only
clear eggs. These hybrid Bullfinches may, nevertheless, have a
normal fertility, for clear eggs in all my aviaries were the rule
rather than the exception this season, and the very cold spring

had probably something to do with it. Chinese (or Japanese)
Bullfinches are larger and stronger than the British variety. They
are also quite peculiarly tame if I may judge from this one pure-
bred bird and his two daughters. They will probably prove to be
longer lived in captivity than British Bullfinches, and they show
a greater readiness to eat a great variety of fruits and berries, etc.
I do not know whether any Chinese hens are obtainable, but if not
it should still be possible to build up a blue-breasted strain from
the birds which I now have. That is provided things go better
next season, for the past one has been altogether calamitous. It
may be that the ground was stale for the top soil has not been
renewed since the year before the war. The chief reason, I think,
was my inability, owing to lameness, to potter round regularly,
looking out for dangers, providing extra food, coaxing the crazy
ones, and doing the work of the lazy ones. Besides this, no satis-
factory successor was found for my bird-man when he was called up.
The worst catastrophe was the loss of my albino Goldfinch,
which I had guarded and watched over all winter with the most
particular care. She was in shining health and had built a nest
at the top of a macrocarpa. As she proved a non-feeder last year,
and starved all her fifteen young ones, the very best fosters had
been kept back for her special benefit, and allowed to build only
when she did. Had I been as constantly around as usual I should
have noticed that this macrocarpa, having grown through the
wire netting, had, as it blew about in the wind, broken a hole as
large as a crown immediately above the nest. As it was, the first
warning was the sight of this Goldfinch outside the aviary trying
desperately to get back. A few minutes later she disappeared and
I did not see her again, till I found her dead body two days later
right against the aviary. Doubtless I shall never be able to replace
this very lovely bird, nor to make a new variety which would
have excited the admiration of even the most conservative and
unimaginative of bird lovers.
As a postscript to my recent article on Sparrows the following
notes may be of interest. Sparrows at the present time have this
advantage, that they require no bird seed : mine do well on brown
breadcrumbs moistened with milk or water. They do not seem
to touch maggots except in the breeding season. Anyone may
find some amusement by releasing Sparrows that have been bred

from albinos or other abnormal birds as they usually remain round
the house, and will produce with the wild ones a percentage of
novelties. I released some birds a few years ago and others escaped.
Since then each year there have been one or more white or cream
birds flying around. This spring I found in a wild Sparrow's
nest a very odd one, which I took and hand reared. It turned out
a bluish fawn, very attractively marked. As all my Sparrows are
extremely wild I wished to see whether a hand-reared bird would
become and remain really tame. At the same time I reared one
with white wings taken from an aviary at a rather later stage of
growth. The second bird, like other Sparrows which I have reared
by hand, became fairly wild as soon as it could feed itself, and
would not perch on my hand even when hungry. The other,
reared from the naked stage, has remained very tame, but not at all
after the manner of a hand-reared Starling or other bird. Of myself
it has no fear at all : on the contrary it much likes to be on my
shoulder and to pull my hair. Often when I have made a cup of
my hands it has snuggled down and gone fast asleep with its head
under its wing, the greatest possible proof of confidence. Yet its
whole character remains otherwise that of a wild bird. If I enter
the aviary (where it lives along with the other Sparrows) in a
different coat nothing will induce it to come near me. Towards
any other person it shows no confidence whatever. This, of course,
makes it more interesting : no doubt St. Francis found the affection
of brother wolf much more gratifying than the indiscriminating
love of a dog. But what surprises me is the degree of suspicion
shown by these birds towards any new object whatever. The
aviary is about 16 ft. long by io ft. wide by io ft. high. At one
end is a small brick shelter with branches over it, the rest of the
aviary being bare except for a nesting tray at the opposite end
protected by a slanting board. In this covered tray they roosted.
From the top of the aviary there happened to hang a few old bits
of wire. The Sparrows seemed to like to swing on these bits of wire
and for that reason I had put no perches at the further end. A
week ago, however, as mice were getting at their food in the shelter,
I nailed up a small piece of board quite similar to the tray cover
alongside the tray, and placed the food saucer on this, in full view.
Next day I found the birds in an exhausted state with the food
untouched. Every day since then I have endeavoured by making

them very hungry to induce them to feed at the end where the
new branches are placed, but so far have entirely failed. If these
harmless branches were snakes they could hardly inspire them
with greater fear. I have tried putting their food on the ground
and moving their saucer towards the other end, but so far they
refuse to go beyond about half-way. If a bird is released it is
bewildered temporarily by the total change, but shows no fear
of the strange trees and bushes ; yet an alteration in their sur-
roundings, otherwise familiar, seems to have a terrifying effect on
these suspicious and intelligent birds.

By C. Buckingham Jones, LL.A.
Last year I wrote a short account of my birds in Assam. My
activities this year (1941), although on a small scale, have been
interesting.
I have managed to breed an Eclectus Parrot (Lorius pectoralis ).
Two eggs were laid, I think, although I am not quite certain of this.
The parents were in a small outside wire enclosure 20 feet by
10 feet by 8 feet with the usual grandfather type nest and lots of
j'ungle and I made a point of not disturbing them. The eggs must
have been laid early in the year, as on the 7th April last a young
male Eclectus was first seen and he appeared to be about two
months old. On the 18th April the youngster was flying about,
and on 20th May I transferred him to a much larger outside
aviary where he can fly to his heart's content. In May he was as
big as his father with exactly the same markings. This young
Eclectus shares an aviary with my Grey Jungle Fowl (Galius
sonneratii). My original pair in the last two years bred one cock
and two hens. Unfortunately last cold weather a mongoose or
something similar killed the parents. I was unable to get either
a male or female Grey Jungle Fowl anywhere to mate to the
remaining birds.
With my three youngsters, one pair two years old, the remaining
bird, a hen, one year old, all the offspring of the pair killed by
the mongoose, I expected no results.

However, they were in a fairly big jungle aviary when to my
surprise I noticed one of the hens sitting on four eggs. To cut a
long story short she hatched and raised one bird, a hen, which
is now (September, 1941) nearly full grown. The other eggs
were taken by rats, I think. Rats are a pest out here. I like to keep
my birds under jungle conditions as far as possible, and if I do
this the rats get in. If I attend to the rats then constant interruption
seems to spoil all chance of my Jungle Fowl and Pheasants breeding.
However, I now have this young Grey Jungle Fowl practically
fully grown and sturdy, notwithstanding the fact its parents were
brother and sister.
The other hen, too, laid four eggs and started to sit, but was
disturbed by rats and abandoned her eggs.
In so far as Indian Jungle Fowl are concerned the extremely
close relationship of brother and sister does not seem to be of much
effect. But I shall try and get some fresh blood for next year.
Blue Masked Love Birds. --A pair filled a nest box with rubbish,
grass, etc., and I hoped the hen was about to lay but found her
dead in the nest. No apparent reason. This has happened twice.
I have three birds left and am hoping that sooner or later they
will breed.
Ringneck Parrakeets (Psittacula tor quota).- --One pair hatched two
youngsters, one died after four or five weeks, but the other is as
big as its parents and flying about strongly.
Mrs. Hume&amp;apos;s Pheasants. --I have three pairs of these and an
odd cock. So far no eggs. Those who have met these birds in
the Naga Hills and Manipur at 4,000-5,000 feet said they would
never live on the plains of Assam. But I have two pairs which have
already gone right through two monsoons and am still hoping
that sooner or later they will lay. I have never heard of Hume's
being bred in captivity. Syrmaticus humm humia are not very well
known even in this country and are, I imagine, something of a
rarity in England.

By Edred J. L. Marshall
The following notes on this little known species may, I hope,
be of some interest. This grotesque rather than beautiful bird
inhabits the Owen Stanley range of mountains in South-eastern
New Guinea, and is found at an altitude of about 8,000 feet.
Examples have been on view at the London Zoo and at Primley
Zoo, Paignton, in Mr. Whitley&amp;apos;s collection, from whence the
specimen I am writing of came into my possession.
I can find very little reference to the species in literature at
my disposal, Wallace in the Malay Archipelago speaks very briefly
of it, stating that the female only was known at his time of writing.
Mr. W. Goodfellow also mentions it in his article in the Avigultural
Magazine, 4th Series, Vol. 4, No. 8, and speaks of its tameness when
fresh captured; also there is a note of the importation in 1909 of
three males and two females by Mr. W. Goodfellow for the late
Mr. E. J. Brook, to be found in the Avigultural Magazine,
New Series, Vol. 7, No. 11. There is also a description given in
Aviculture , vol. 1.
Here is a description of the male which I have. The sickle-
shaped bill is about 3 inches in length and black in colour and is
actually much stronger than it would appear to be. The head is
completely covered with short velvety feathers, metallic green on
the crown and lower side of the face, the throat area being intense
metallic purple and the remainder dull black. The feathers of the
top of the head are capable of erection in the manner seen in the
Yellow-winged Sugar Bird. The gape is a beautiful pale green
and the tongue is short and of a dark flesh colour. The eye is pale
bluish-grey which tends to make it rather prominent and a little
fierce. The back and rump are metallic blue-green and the two
long central tail feathers are glossy blue-black with greenish
reflections.
The breast is of a soft grey and the feathers are very soft and
hair-like in texture, especially those of the flanks which are long
and drooping and have a green tinge. The strong crow-like legs
and feet are black.

1 6 E. J. L. MARSHALL-MEYER'S SICKLE-BILLED BIRD OF PARADISE
From each side of the breast spring fan-shaped plumes, the
individual feathers of which are club shaped, the uppermost ones
being dull black but the lower top ones have terminal bands of
brilliant metallic blue and the lower and shorter ones are banded
with vivid metallic green shading to purple. The wing covert
and flight feathers are dull black. The side plumes or fans when
in repose are covered entirely by the wings, but when the bird
is excited by offer of live insects or spoken to quietly for a while,
he will stretch up his body, and lowering the head somewhat as
though bowing, will extend these fans making a beautiful show,
and sometimes dancing as well.
Just what a full display would be I unfortunately do not know,
but I should imagine it would also involve opening the bill widely
to show off the green gape as does the King Bird of Paradise. My
bird is very active and his great ambition is to have one long meal,
rather an unfortunate one in these days of rations, particularly
where fruit is concerned.
The long bill makes for difficulty in picking up any food of a
very soft nature, such as milk sop, of which he is fond, he is not
able to drink properly even, unless the bill is completely immersed,
but with fairly crumbly insectivorous food the particles are picked
up and thrown back into the throat in a manner similar to that
employed by Toucans. Cut slices of apple or pear are tackled by
holding with the foot in crow-like way and by using the mandibles as
scissors, cutting off suitable portions of the pulp first and tossing
them back and then tearing pieces of the skin off and treating
them likewise.
I should imagine that in a natural state the long bill would
be used to delve into bell-like blossoms in search of insects and
to extract beetles, etc., from crevices in bark. The only sounds
JL have heard are a harsh croak when annoyed and a gentle
" Howk 55 when hungry.

The Cairo Zoo is situated at Gizeh in spacious beautifully
planted and consequently shady grounds, with water running
through them. To start on the large birds. There are some fine
Ostriches, including a magnificent pair of the Somali species or
subspecies. There are quite a number of the quaint Adjutants
(. Leptoptilos dubius) and Marabou Storks and I was amused to see
them picking dead fish out of a vessel of water and losing fully
80 per cent of them to the ever watchful Kites ! There were a
few Jabirus ( Jabiru mycteria), and I thought they looked almost
identical with the Australian species. The Flamingoes, there were
about eighty of them, made a magnificent sight on an artificial
swamp; they were all of the common European species, and
I wished I could arrange for some to be sent to Adelaide where
our stock is sadly depleted. There were seven or eight examples
of the funny looking Shoebill ( Balaniceps rex) which is, I believe,
becoming rare, also a large number, nearly fifty, of the European
Stork. Other Storks were the White-bellied ( Sphenorynchus abdimii )
and the Woolly-necked ( Dissoura episcopus ), a few examples of
each and several of the attractive Senegal Saddle-billed Stork
(. Ephippiorhynchus senegalensis) with red and yellow wattles at the
base of the bill. There were quite a number of Cranes, and
I remember that Lilford's and the Japanese species were
represented. I saw the Rosy Spoonbill ( Ajaia ajaia ) in life for the
first time there, two of them in fine colour ; there were also examples
of Black-billed and Yellow-billed Spoonbills, very like the two
Australian species which they may even have been. There were
several species of Herons and Ibis including three examples of
the lovely Scarlet Ibis ( Eudocimus rubra) again in fine colour.
There were about a dozen Pelicans, I did not see the species, but
they were white with a slight pinkish tinge. There were three
Cassowaries, each of a different species, the Ceram, Bennett's,
and one unnamed, of which I think there is an example in Taronga
Park, but I have forgotten its name. There was also a single
Cariama or Seriema. There was a fairly good collection of birds
of prey, but I have never been particularly interested in them and
only made notes of a few of them. There were quite a number of

different species of Vulture, and I thought the Bateleur Eagle
(Terathopius ecaudatus ) rather an unusual looking species. Perhaps
the most attractive of all the birds of prey are the Secretary Birds
(&lt;Sagittarius serpentarius) , and there were seven or eight of them in
fine condition. There were also several species of Owls exhibited,
but I do not think there were any of especial interest. The collection
of game birds was most particularly impressive, there were most
of the commoner Pheasants and one cock Bel's Silver Pheasant
(Genmus beli) which I do not remember having seen before. There
were quite a number of Vulturine Guineafowl and a lot of Sennar
Tufted Guineafowl (. Numida meleagris), which was also new to me.
I noticed a pair of Grey-breasted Red-necked Francolins and two
species of Sandgrouse which always seem to me to be a mixture of
a Quail and a Dove--the Spotted and the Saharan Coronetted
they were labelled. There were also quite a number of small
Plovers with a short crest. I could not find their name, but two pairs
had young ones. There was a great variety of waterfowl on the
various ponds and many of them were full winged, I am not well
up in Ducks and consequently did not identify many, there were
quite a large number of Shovelers and the males appeared to be
just going out of colour. There was also a solitary Black-necked
Swan which I always think is a most attractive species. Doubtless
most of the Ducks were common species, but there may have been
rarities that a practised eye would have spotted.
The Parrot family was not very well represented. There were
a few common Macaws and Cockatoos, also one or two Citron-
crested and Lesser Sulphur-crested Cockatoos. I noticed one
Lesser Vasa Parrot and there was quite a large flock of Quaker
Parrots, which breed occasionally I was told. There were several
of the commoner species of Lovebirds, and I was interested to
see a single cock Abyssinian ( Agapornis tarantd) and about half
a dozen Madagascars, all cocks except one. There were quite a
number of nice Plum-headed Parrakeets, again all cocks but one.
There were several of the common Red-sided Eclectus and two or
three Black-headed Conures. There were three Lories labelled
Rajah, Yellow-backed, and Blue-cheeked, but I am fairly certain
the last was wrongly identified as it was nearly all scarlet and certainly
did not have blue cheeks. The Australian species were very poorly
represented as, apart from numerous Sulphur-crested Cockatoos,

Cockatiels, and Budgerigars, there were only single examples of
Barraband's, Pennant's, Port Lincoln, and Rosella Parrakeets,
and of the Scaly-breasted Lorrikeet. Still, it made me think what
a profitable avenue of exchange there would be in more normal
times.
Now for the remainder in no particular order. There was
a very fine Philippine Hornbill ( Penelopides affinis ), and I was
particularly interested in two Abyssinian Ground Hornbills
(Bucorvus abyssinicus) , I noticed one of these had a blue and the
other a red neck wattle; whether they were different species or
different sexes I do not know. There were several Egyptian Lark-
heeled Cuckoos and a single European Roller, a pair of White-
cheeked Touracous, a Red-billed Toucan, a single green Barbet
which was unidentified, and some Egyptian Bulbuls which are
plentiful in the gardens around Cairo. There were lots of smaller
birds, mostly the commoner Finches, but I noticed two lovely
cock Fischer's Whydahs and a big Weaver--the White-headed
Buffalo Weaver. There were also some Finch Larks ( Eremopterix )
which reminded me very much of Alario Finches, and I saw one
lovely Peter's Spotted Finch ( Hypargos niveoguttata) which I always
think looks like and must be very closely related to the Australian
Finches. Wild in the Zoo I noticed quite a number of the attractive
Hoopoes and I thought of Mr. Ward, of Sydney, who accompanied
Mr. Lee Crandall, of New York, to New Guinea ( vide Paradise
Quest), it has always been one of his ambitions to have a Hoopoe
in captivity ! There were also a number of Ring-necked Parrakeets
flying around the Zoo, but whether of the African species or
liberated Asiatic ones I cannot say, though I suspect the latter.

It is not often given to anyone to have the opportunity of
possessing a young Amazon Parrot from the beginning and to
know its life history.
This Blue-fronted Amazon was hatched last May in the Keston
Aviaries. The parents had had two previous broods. The first was
in 1939 when they had four babies--the first ever bred in the
British Isles. Mr. Boosey is greatly to be congratulated on such
an achievement, for which he has been given a certificate in lieu
of the Avicultural Society's Medal, which we hope to be able to
present to him after the war. In 1940 the parents again went to
nest and reared five sturdy youngsters which I paid a special visit
to see. I would have much liked to have had one of these, but
they had all been bespoken. This year, though the parents had
four eggs, only one bird was hatched and was given to me by our
kind President, Mr. Ezra.
Mr. Boosey writes that it was still in the nest on 21st July
but it emerged from the nest on 31st July. It was sent to me on
16th August and seemed very much of a baby with the dark big
eyes of babyhood. For the first two days he seemed a bit nervous,
and kept trying to hide his head in the corner of the cage much
like young Budgerigars have a way of doing. He never seemed
in the least bit spiteful and does not know the word 44 bite ".
In four days I got him to sit on my hand, and by 23rd August,
a week after he arrived, he stepped willingly on to my hand for
me to take him out. I have never tamed a bird so quickly, but
I put it down in a great measure to his never having been frightened
or roughly handled as many of the imported birds must be.
On 9th September, as I took him out of the cage, he said his
first word, 44 Pretty," of which he seemed very pleased, repeating
it several times.
On 11 th September his eyes turned orange ; this seemed to
happen almost in a day.
Now he chatters freely and is extremely playful and active
and loves biting up a piece of wood. He says 44 Pretty " and
44 Pretty Boy ", 44 Puss, puss, puss, miau ", 44 Hullo ! Oh there
you are ", he also laughs and sings.

Before he came to me I believe he had been fed a good deal
on potato and I did not think he seemed in very good shape when
he arrived, being a bit mopey and light in the hand. He now
has a varied diet, but sunflower seed is the staple food--otherwise
he gets anything that is going, not fish or meat, but vegetables
of all sorts, pudding, cake, biscuit, bread and butter, toast, and
occasionally a bone to pick. If he sees something on my plate he
particularly fancies there is no peace until he gets it.
Mr. Boosey told me he thought he would make a most delightful
pet. He certainly has proved right, and has greatly contributed
to my happiness and in cheering me in a rather long and tedious
convalescence after my serious illness.

LINEOLATED PARRAKEET (No. 369), Bolborhynchus lineola

Neunzig {p. 699) says that they have been once successfully
bred--by Zeh at Frankfort, and gives the reference Gef. Welt.
1902, 201 , 299. For the U.K. only an incomplete success is on
record ; Baker in 1913 {B.N. 1919 , 909 ), one young bird hatched
in May but accidentally drowned in August.
BLUE-WINGED PARROTLET (No. 370), For pus vividus
{Ridgw .) (passerinus , authors : not Linn).
This, the cc Blue-wing Lovebird 55 of earlier days, was imported
in large numbers some thirty or more years ago and was often
bred both abroad and in the U.K. Russ was the first breeder,
teste Russ {Bull. 1880, 680), and among British records we have
Watson, eight young reared {A.M. 1909 , 94 ), Mathias, 1909
{B.JV. viii, 249 ), Lovell-Keays, 1914--three reared {B.JV. 1914 , 142) ;
Tavistock, " at Liberty " {A.M. 1921 , 178 ), and Heal, 1933, who
reared two (perhaps more young), A.M. 1994 , no. Hybrids with
the female of the next species are also on record.
SPECTACLED PARROTLET, F. conspicillatus {.Lafr.).
Only a hybrid record. This with the female BLUE-WINGED
which were bred in California by Mrs. Tomlinson about 1930 teste
Plath in Aviculture {U.S.A.), 1992 , 82, where he says that the cross
was first given as " vividus X coelestis ", but Dr. Plath finally was
certain that the birds then imported as coelestis were really con-
spicillatus , and that the cross was obtained as above. See also
A.M. 1999 , 112.
BLUE-RUMPED PARROTLET, F. cyanopygius {Bp.).

bred at Brighton ( Parrots , p. 155). In A.M. 1926, 244.
Dr. Wildeboer gives an account of success at Hull, which appears
to have been with passerinus. Whitley in 1931 reared a full brood
(which I saw) of this Parrotlet. Plath told me in lit. Oct. 28 , 1932,
that he bred this bird in Chicago in August, 1924, rearing one
young bird which he kept two years and then gave away. In his
article on the Parrotlets in Aviculture ( U.S.A .), 1932, 83 , which is
accompanied by a coloured plate showing half a dozen species, he
unfortunately uses the name vivida for this species, but from the
context alone, one can see that he meant to write viridissima.
Hampe wrote to me from Berlin in February, 1936, that in
Die Gefiederte Welt of 27th July, 1882, Dr. Frenzel described the
successful breeding of " die griinburzelige Sperlingspapagei 33 in
Germany that year and wrote " they left the nest so quickly that
I never saw them till they flew ". If this refers to passerinus , as
I expect it does, it provides by far the earliest success.
ALL-GREEN PARRAKEET (No. 372), Brotogeris tirica (Gm.).
Neunzig (p. 639) writes : " have been occasionally bred both
in cage and bird-room. A pair with Parson Hintz had four young
in two broods in 1882, and two more young in the following year. 33
He was the first breeder teste Russ. In the U.K. Lovell-Keays
was the first to succeed in 1914, when four young were reared
(B.JV. 1914 , 547, and Jan. inset). I know of no other British success.
In the December number of the Avicultural Magazine , 1939,
is a wonderful article by Helmut Hampe of Berlin on the Brotogeris ;
it is followed, I regret to say, by the announcement of his death.
It contains full and critical accounts of all the records (and they
are not numerous) of the breeding of these Parrakeets. From
it the above can be supplemented. For the first success. Parson
Hintz's, Hampe gives the reference Gef. Welt. 1883 , 205, and the
date as 1882 with two young in the first nest, four in a second,
and then in 1883 two more young followed by a second nest from
which nothing came. Other successes with the references given
are
Gef. Welt. 1886. Two young reared by G. Graeff.

had started to breed on their own. He then gives an extract from
Vog. ferner Lander. 1931, 173, where N. Grasl reports that two blue
tirica were reared from a pair of normal green birds at the Schon-
brunn Zoo, and two more blues with two greens from a second
nest ; of the four blues, two were accidentally killed (drowning
and a rat), and the other two sold to a Budapest lady, who reared
seven blue young ones which came to grief in the Great War.
A coloured plate of one of them accompanies the article. 1
TOVI PARRAKEET (No. 373), B.jugularis {Muller).
Hampe says Frau Veronica Greiner in Vienna was the first
breeder in 1873 an d ^74, when three young birds were reared.
Hampe says this is the only real record, though Russ gives two
successes, Greiner and Schmalz, but the latter's single young bird
only lived eight days. In Neunzig the name Grimm is used instead
of Greiner, " hence the quoting of both names by Hopkinson,"
and Butler's "frequently bred in Germany" is incorrect.
ORANGE-FLANKED PARRAKEET, B. pyrrhopterus {Lath.).
Hampe {l.c. above) says that the first breeding was in Denmark
about 1902 reported in Gef. Welt. 1902, p. 82 , where it is stated
that the fledglings were growing well. (Did they live ? As Hampe
includes this as a success I feel sure we can take it they did.--E.H.)
In England W. Lewis was the first to succeed in 1925, when
three were reared out of five hatched : A.S. Medal {A.M. 1923, 292 ;
1926, 7/, 116). Has there been other success in the U.K. ? In
California the species was bred by R. R. Hood in 1933, five young
being reared--two by the parents, three by hand. Account by
the breeder and announcement of the award of the French Medal
appeared in L.Oiseau, 1936 , 926. See also Vogel Ferner Lander,
1926, 7/.
1 Hampe also gives the following notes on various blue Brotogeris, which
I give here as of interest, though with no breeding-record connection. " Another
blue tirica figured in Revista do Museu Bautista, 1920. A blue Tovi shot out of a
flock of normal ones teste Finsch. ( Papagei ), and Lord Tavistock in his Parrot book
says he was once offered a live white Tui Parrakeet."

The Handbook of British Birds, Vol. V (Terns, Gulls, Skuas,
Auks, Rails, Game Birds). By H. F. Witherby, F. C. R.
Jourdain, N. F. Txcehurst, B. W. Tucker. Price 25.5-.
Published by H. F. and G. Witherby, Ltd., 326 High Holborn,
London, W.G. 1.
With Volume V, the final volume of the Handbook of British
Birds , is completed the results of six and a half years of constant
work and Mr. Witherby and his co-editors are to be sincerely
congratulated on this invaluable contribution to ornithological
literature. In the fact that the last two volumes were published
after the outbreak of war the highest praise is due to the publishers.
In the preface to Volume V it is stated that, " We feel entitled
to hope, moreover, that our work will prove of value not only in
providing a summary of what is known, but also in directing
attention to the many gaps in our knowledge, and thereby stimu-
lating further research. Although no single branch of our subject
can be considered ' worked out 5 , it is perhaps in many aspects
of breeding biology and study of behaviour that the most obvious
gaps exist, notwithstanding the vast accumulation of facts in
recent years. It may be permissible to refer especially to the subject
of display because in this work for the first time (apart from the
notable pioneer effort in the British Bird Book) a serious attempt
has been made to summarize what is known of this very interesting
side of avian life. . . . Under the heading of breeding-habits in
the more restricted sense, in spite of the great advance since the
Practical Handbook was written, there is still a great need for precise
information on even such matters of comparatively straightforward
observation as fledging periods and the share of the sexes in building,
incubation and care of young in many species, not to mention
such subjects as nest-sanitation, disposal of egg-shells and others,
which were omitted from the breeding section on account of the
inadequacy of available data." It is this side of ornithology which
is of special interest to aviculturists and they have peculiar oppor-
tunities for acquiring the information.
Though sea birds have not enjoyed much popularity among
aviculturists in the past, apart from the notable successes of
Dr. Derscheid in Belguim and one or two other aviculturists, there

are many interested in Pheasants and other game birds and the
rails to whom this volume will make special appeal. Volume V also
contains additions and corrections to the four preceeding volumes,
the systematic list of British birds, and index of English names in
Volumes I to V.
To anyone who has a sincere interest in ornithology the complete
set of the Handbook will prove an unending source of help and
pleasure. His Majesty's Government was certainly wise in refraining
from placing a purchase tax on books !

A Tribute
It is with great regret that the death of Mr. H. W. Schofield, for 42 years
Manager of the Art Department of Messrs. John Bale and Staples, is announced.
Though Mr. Schofield was known only to few members of the Avicultural Society
his work was appreciated by hundreds, for it was entirely owing to his personal
efforts that the high standard of the coloured plates published in the Magazine
was attained. Mr. Schofield was a master in the art of lithography and no trouble
was considered by him tco great in order to reproduce a painting as near perfect
as possible. He shared the disappointment of the Editor, when, with the out-
break of war and the greatly increased cost of production, lithography had to be
abandoned for colour block printing ; but with this again Mr. Schofield attained
a very high standard of reproduction. Though 72 years of age and therefore
exempt from the duties of fire watching, Mr. Schofield refused to be excused from
his share of protecting his firm's buildings at night. On Friday, 21st November,
he fell while on duty and fractured his skull ; he died in hospital on Sunday,
30th November. The Editor feels sure she is expressing the feelings of all members

Samuel Stacey of the Bronx Zoo
Samuel Stacey, Head Keeper of birds at the Bronx Zoo since 1906 and one
of the best-known practical bird men in the United States, has retired from
active duties at the Zoo. For the first time in its history the New York Zoological
Society has created an honorary position on its keeper staff, and Mr. Stacey
retires with the title of Honorary Head Keeper of Birds.
He reached the retirement age of 65 in April, 1941, but because of his extra-
ordinary ability to handle birds an extension of service was granted him. Early in
July he suffered a heart attack which incapacitated him for active work, but he
returned to the Zoo in an advisory capacity, aiding in the training of new keepers.
Mr. Stacey was one of the first thoroughly trained, practical bird men in any zoo
in the United States, and many of the practices in feeding and handling birds
which he instituted at the Bronx Zoo have since been generally adopted. Soon
after he came to the Zoo in 1904 he organized a basic routine for taking care
of birds, and although it has been modified from time to time, it is still the back-
bone of bird-keeping in the Bronx Zoo collection, which is the largest and finest
in the world.
Mr. Stacey was born in Hampshire, in England, on the estate of the Duke of
Wellington, and was the third generation in his family in the service of the Duke.
His grandfather had been the " Iron Duke's " body sergeant at the Battle of
Waterloo, and after the campaign came back to England to become water bailiff
on the Duke's estate, in charge of the fishing rights. Mr. Stacey's father, also
born on the estate, became its gamekeeper.
When Mr. Stacey was a boy he was selected by the Duchess of Wellington
as her bird boy to care for small cage birds and as he grew older was sent to the
London Zoological Garden to serve an apprenticeship as a keeper in the bird
department. After several years of training there he came to the United States
in 1903, taking care of the bird collection in the Philadelphia Zoo for a year
and then entering the Bird Department at the Bronx Zoo in 1904.
The Bronx Zoo at that time was only five years old and its bird house keepers
were untrained men with no experience in handling the rare and delicate birds
that were beginning to pour into the new zoo from all parts of the world.
Mr. Stacey began to pound into the keepers the principles and methods he had
been taught under the Duchess of Wellington and in the London Zoo, advised
in the selection of men especially fitted to be bird keepers, and through the years
built up a staff of keepers whose competence could scarcely be matched anywhere
in the world.
Mr. Stacey's own favourites in the bird collection were the Toucans, Parrots,
Birds of Paradise, and Humming Birds. Until a few years ago he held a record
for longevity of Ricord's Emerald Humming Bird, having kept a specimen on
exhibition for three and a half years. The bird finally died because a fuse blew
out one night, allowing the temperature of its specially heated cage to fall below
its survival point.
Visitors to the bird house at the Bronx Zoo, who had known Mr. Stacey for
a long time, often asked him to put his favourite birds through a routine of tricks
he had taught them. An Ariel Toucan he had trained to lie on its back in his
hand, with its wings held tightly together, and allow itself to be tossed repeatedly
into the air.
Another bird which he often demonstrated was " Cocky ", a Sulphur-crested
Cockatoo, which would hop up and down and raise and lower its crest on
command and in time to Mr. Stacey's whistling.

BIRD BREEDING IN FRANCE
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.996645137931034" page_id="56350408"  page_num="28" year="" vol="">
I have heard recently from M. A. Decoux who, although deprived of proper
food himself, still manages to keep his bird collection at G#ry, near Limoges,
Unoccupied France. He has even had some breeding successes with many species,
particularly Scarlet Tanagers and Australian Parrakeets, including Queen
Alexandra's, Many-coloured, Swift, and Crimson-wings.
Supplies, however, are getting shorter every day, and he does not know
how much longer he will be able to feed his birds. The more delicate insectivorous
and frugivorous birds died long ago owing to want of proper food.
He writes that he has now quite a number of Blue Masked Lovebirds, as
have also several other amateurs in the south-west. These French Blue Masks
are quite a different strain to those existing in England and in California.
They actually originated from my own green birds, which I had secured from
Chapman's many years ago when they were first imported. After several seasons
of successful breeding, we had to cut down their number and about ten years
ago Mr. Fooks sent two pairs to a novice amateur, M. Morin, in South-west
France. The following year this gentleman wrote to say that, although the birds
we had sent him were perfect, he would like to point out that their offspring was
not satisfactory : their young, he said, instead of being the normal green and
yellow colour were blue and white, which he did not like so well ! We promptly
replied, explaining his great luck, and during the next years he bred many more
blue birds, which found their way to other aviaries and became well established.
Needless to say, never one Blue Lovebird was ever hatched at Cleres ! I hear also
that M. A. Blanchard has now at Toulouse a great many lutino Fischer's Lovebirds.
M. Decoux states that bird trade is very active in the whole of France
(naturally only aviary-bred specimens), people finding some consolation and
forgetfulness in their hobby, that no hardships can check. Their price has gone
up about ten times in francs. From America we can hardly figure out how our
European friends can carry on with animals under tremendous difficulties and
we admire them for it.

BULLFINCHES

<bodyText confidence="0.955279888888889" page_id="56350408"  page_num="28" year="" vol="">
I think our Editor is greatly to be congratulated on such an excellent number
of the Avigultural Magazine for the last of 1941. Personally I enjoyed all the
articles, but especially Dr. Amsler's, but I should like to put in a plea for the
Bullfinch when he compares the seed-eaters to the softbills. Is not the Bullfinch
one of the most lovely of birds of our countryside ? There is a pair round this
cottage, and when I see them sitting in the sun my heart rejoices at the lovely
sight, and one feels how beautiful Nature is in a world so full of dreadful things.
I have kept many Bullfinches, and when one comes to talk about tameness--
can you beat them ? They are one of the most delightful pets one can possess.

I am indebted to Captain Jean Delacour for information
concerning the greatest collection of Colombian birds ever exhibited
at one time in a zoological garden and many never before exhibited
anywhere.
Virtually no large-scale collecting of birds has ever been carried
out in the almost inaccessible western side of the Andes of Colombia,
though a somewhat similar collection was made in Western
Ecuador by Walter Goodfellow in 1915 (Avic. Mag ., 3rd Series,
Vol. VI., p. 373). During 1941 Captain Jean Delacour, technical
consultant of the Bronx Zoological Park, received a let t r from
Venezuela from Charles Cordier, the Swiss bird collectore who is
considered one of the three or four best in the world. Cor dier has

collected many birds for the collection at Cleres, but he was
stranded in South America by the war and Captain Delacour had
lost touch with him until the arrival of his letter from Venezuela.
Cordier was immediately commissioned to make a collecting
trip through the Cock-of-the-Rock country and at the end of
September he reached the village of Ricaurte in South-Western
Colombia. On his first day in the village he had the extraordinary
good luck to find two hand-reared Cocks-of-the-Rock in the
possession of a villager, and was able to buy them for a few cents.
Hummingbirds were plentiful all around Ricaurte and Cordier
caught many of them within half a mile of the village. They were
captured with a sticky gum on the tip of a 30-foot bamboo pole,
the gum being tipped on to their wings as they hovered over low-
growing flowers.

The Gocks-of-the-Rock were far more difficult to catch. They
live at an altitude of 3,200 to 8,000 feet, in an almost impenetrable
jungle growth that is perpetually bathed in rain or fog and hung
with green moss. There are few mountain trails in the neighbour-
hood, and to reach the area where the birds were known to be
feeding and nesting Cordier had to climb mountain sides almost
perpendicularly. After locating the birds the collector observed
their most frequent line of flight between trees and then set his
nets in their path. The nets were of various sizes, from 50 feet
square to 330 feet, and the jungle sometimes had to be partially
cleared to make room for them. Bats fluttered into the nets during
the night, usually tangling and tearing them, but in the daytime
Tanagers, Callistes, and Sugar-birds also blundered into them and
were caught.
Cordier returned to Bogota, the capital of Colombia, near the
end of November, and started for the sea coast to catch a steamer
for New York. Some of his birds refused to eat and for several
days he was in danger of losing them. Eventually all were placed
on an artificial diet and reached New York in excellent condition.
The Scarlet Cock-of-the-rock is about the size of a Pigeon, with
brilliant red plumage and a high, rounded-thin crest that virtually
hides its beak. It has black wings and a grey " shawl 55 over the
back. It is very like the commoner species R. crocea , except that
the orange colour is replaced by red. The females and immature
males are bright chocolate-brown.
The photograph of the Scarlet Cock-of-the-rock which
accompanies this article can only give opportunity for mental
visualization and it is hoped at a later date to publish a painting
of this bird in all its wonderful colouring.

NOTES ON THE NEOPHEMA PARRAKEETS
By Sydney Porter
The Neophema Parrakeets or, as they are known to aviculturists

in England, the Grass Parrakeets have always been great favourites
of mine. They are quiet unobtrusive little birds, beautiful in shape
and chaste in colouring. Only one can be called brilliantly coloured
and that is the " Splendid ", the others, with the exception of
the " Bourkes ", are clad in soft greens, blues, and yellows.
During a visit to Australia I hoped to see something of these
birds in the wild state ; unfortunately owing to shortness of time
at my disposal I was unable to see any of them in a state of nature,
but friends have promised to take me out and show me several
species when I visit Australia again. Fortunately I did see all the
species of this genus in captivity in South Australia, and was able
to have a long talk with both Mr. Harvey and Dr. Hamilton.
The former is the chief authority on these Parrakeets in captivity

and the latter the leading authority on birds at liberty, and it is
from the information I gleaned from these two gentlemen that
the following notes are made.
South Australia is the headquarters of the genus, only one
species, the Turquoisine, is not found in that State.
Dr. Hamilton in his conversation opened up a subject which
had long been in my mind, that is the question of erosion and its
effect on bird life. To put it as briefly as possible--over vast areas
in Australia the land is being grazed by sheep which in time eat up
all the natural vegetation, the low bushes and plants are con-
tinually eaten down so that they never have a chance to seed and
thus renew themselves, and no young trees are allowed to take
the place of the old ones. The surface of the earth, now unprotected
by the thick vegetation which preserved the moisture from evapora-
tion is exposed to the fierce rays of the sun which dries up all the
natural moisture. The remaining trees and inedible vegetation
are scorched up and die, and gradually the land is turned from
a pleasant sylvan paradise, once the home of countless millions
of birds, to a dry burnt-up desert where the wind whips the dried
soil into thick dust storms. This is by no means confined to Australia
but is going on all over the world to-day, especially in North
and South America, China, New Zealand, Africa, etc. What will be
the result of all this devastation only a few realize. While commercial
interests are at stake very little can be done. What does it matter
how much land is laid waste so long as the company which exploits
it pays a good dividend ? I am wandering from my subject, but
I suppose that this all leads up to the question as to why the
Neophema Parrakeets appear to be more plentiful now than they
were some few years ago. Those who have not studied the subject
would be inclined to say that the birds were now increasing and
becoming more plentiful. Fifteen to thirty years ago some of the
species, in fact most of them, were recorded as being nearly extinct,
especially the " Turquoisine ", the " Splendid ", and the " Orange-
bellied ". Now one can go into Adelaide and buy at least four
species for comparatively few shillings a pair. One sees literally
hundreds of Elegants and Bourkes for sale. This would obviously
suggest that the birds are much commoner now or that they were
being bred in great numbers in Australia, the latter cannot be
the case as the birds were nearly all wild caught. The question

S. PORTER-NOTES ON THE NEOPHEMA PARRAKEETS
is answered by Dr. Hamilton, who advances the theory for which
he has ample proof; that these birds are now being driven out
of their formerly remote habitats by the destruction of the native
vegetation and by erosion. The birds' food supply now being cut
off they are having to seek pastures new and are thus coming into
the more settled districts ; as soon as they are noted in a fresh area
the trappers hurry along and are often not satisfied until as many
birds as possible are caught.
It would be all right if the birds could find new areas for
repopulation and settle down unmolested by the trappers, but my
own theory is that, with the gradual redistribution of the birds
over the more settled parts of the country, we shall see a slow but
sure diminution of the species and they will in the course of a few
years be brought to virtual extinction in the wild state. I doubt
whether any sanctuary or National Park would save them as they
are like many other Australian Parrakeets either nomadic or
migratory and wander over vast areas, not haphazardly but with
definite areas and routes as Dr. Hamilton explained to me.
The Splendid Parrakeet (.Neophema splendidd)
The home of this lovely little bird is to the north-west of
Oodnaddatta in South Australia and a short description of this
region will perhaps help to visualize its remote habitat. This
description is taken from The Great Australian Loneliness, by E. Hill,
one of the most interesting books I have read on Australia. Speaking
of the district where the birds live the author says, " A hundred
and fifty miles farther lie the ranges, the Musgraves, the Everhards,
the Mann, and the Petermann, their gigantic peaks touching
5,500 feet, their water-polished slopes and balanced marbles weighing
thousands of tons, a throwback to the glacier age, with their virgin
mulga forests and millions of acres of Mitchell grass never yet
eaten down, and buck spinifex 20 feet high.
" These ranges have been crossed only by few intrepid explorers
and one or two prospectors seemingly mad. ... A scattering of
white men is out there, camped on the hidden soaks and springs,
but they rarely see one another. . . . One is an old prospector
washing gold in the bed of the mountain creeks living mainly on
black's tucker. The others, business partners over an illimitable

distance, separately followed the trail of the tribes in the puppy
season to barter for dingo scalps, and museum specimens and rare
birds, with as many as 300 agents of the Pitchentara tribe snaring
by water holes or tracking the wild dog to his lair. . . . Once a
year a camel string comes in with a thousand dog (dingo) scalps,
a crate or two of birds, and a few tobacco tins of rough gold.
" Amongst the world's best sellers are the birds of this region,
rare and colourful Finches (Painted), the dainty Bourke Parrakeet,
the Princess Alexandra, her wings an iridescence of opal tints,
and the unique Scarlet-chested Parrot that is practically extinct
elsewhere. Two pairs of this rarity sent by rail from Oodnadetta
attracted much attention on the way down and reckless offers
were made, but they were not for sale. One pair was a gift to the
King and the other brought #100 in Adelaide.
"To the camp of the white man in the night time the wild
blacks bring their catch--a fluttering captive held in the hands
or a dead dog thrown over the shoulder or a stone shot with gold.
Lithe bodies and white eyes shine in the firelight. They will haggle
for hours for another pitch of flour, a precious spoonful of tea, or
another lump of sugar."
The Splendid or Scarlet-chested Parrakeet inhabits in very
limited numbers the districts between the Musgrave Ranges to
the north-west of Oodnadatta down the mid and western parts
of South Australia to within thirty miles of the coast at Penong and
its range is probably the most sparsely populated region of Australia.
Mr. Harvey said that the depression in Australia was the reason
that this bird was brought to light again in 1930 after being missing
for so many years. People in the remote regions of the country,
badly hit by the financial crash, took to rearing and trapping birds
as a source of income.
As far as is known this is the rarest of the Neophemas , but its
habitat is very imperfectly known so it may be more numerous
than we are led to believe.
My eyes were simply dazzled by the galaxy of these beautiful
birds in Mr. Harvey's aviaries, I think he has about forty of them,
mainly his own breeding. In fact the " Splendid " is not an
uncommon aviary bird in Adelaide, quite a few aviculturists had
pairs in their aviaries where they bred quite freely. I believe
Mr. Harvey said he reared twenty-eight during the summer I was in

Australia. The only difficulty is, when the young ones are removed
from their parents before their first moult, they invariably die.
Mr. Harvey, after several disasters of this sort, left the young ones
in with their parents for a year after the first moult ; after this he
lost none. The birds are usually double and even treble brooded,
and I was shown two pairs in the aviaries with two nests of young
ones on the wing and a third lot in the nest box. The birds do not
seem to mind breeding with their other young ones in the aviary.
As well as being perhaps the most beautiful of Parrakeets it is
also the most gentle and inoffensive and is very little larger than
a Budgerigar, in fact it is not as large of some of the giant Budgerigars
I have seen at shows in England.
The few wild birds which find their way down to Adelaide
are ones taken by the Aborigines from the nests and sold to the
gangers on the railway line who hand rear them . . . but the mortality
of these delicate little Parrakeets during this stage must be very
great, especially as the birds are usually taken too young.
Very little water is found in the districts where the birds live,
and it is said that they extract moisture by chewing the succulent
leaves of a certain bush.
No coloured plate or stuffed skin can give a true picture of
the living bird, the feathers on the head and chest are wax-like
and the colours clear and intense. The whole head is a wax-like
pale turquoise blue gradually fading into brilliant cornflower blue
on the crown, front of the face, and throat ; the breast is vivid
geranium red, below this is yellow, the back and wings are a soft
grass-green with very pale blue wing coverts. The hen is very
much like a hen " Turquoisine It has none of the drawbacks
of many Parrakeets except its costliness, and it is a gentle creature
never harming other birds. It has a soft voice and never bites up
the vegetation in the aviary. Whether it will ever become a familiar
denizen of our aviaries I do not know, its price in Europe is rather
prohibitive.
Its chief drawback besides its price is the fact that being a
very timid bird it is liable, when frightened, to crack its fragile
skull on the top of the aviary. I only saw one pair which were
really tame, these were in Dr. Cinner's aviaries. A simple diet
suits it best, spray millet, of which it is very fond, plain canary
and shelled oats, with a leaf of silver or New Zealand spinach.

This bird is a very great rarity and the only person possessing
it is Dr. Hamilton, of Adelaide, who procured all his birds himself.
As he has already written a very comprehensive article for the
Magazine about this species I can add but little to his notes except
that it is, as far as is known, the rarest of the Neophemas . Though
at various times Dr. Hamilton has seen flocks of considerable size
containing up to as many as fifty individuals, sometimes an odd
bird has been discovered in with a flock of Elegants. Dr. Hamilton
thinks that in these cases the birds may have lost their sense of
direction and joined a passing flock of Elegants. They are birds of
very fixed habits keeping more or less to their old feeding grounds,
and as these are often now under cultivation this may have some-
thing to do with its diminution.
The headquarters of this bird is in the south-east of South
Australia and they are found about the town of Robe, even in
the town itself, which rather indicates that the town now stands
on the old feeding grounds of this bird and that the birds are
obeying some old migratory instinct. They get frightened and also
shot when they arrive around the town and soon disappear.
At certain times in the year the Orange-bellies disappear from
South Australia and Dr. Hamilton has good reason to suppose
that they migrate to Tasmania. They arrive in South Australia
about the middle of June, mate and breed, the young leaving the
nest in late August ; after this the birds disappear to reappear
the following June. The nesting time, by the way, is mid-winter,
which can be very cold in South Australia. Their breeding grounds
are 280 to 300 miles south-east of Adelaide. They live in the
dense scrub and have the most extraordinary nesting habits of any
Parrot I have heard of. There is a very common shrub in Australia
called " Tea-tree " which is no relation to the tea plant, the stem
being only a few inches in diameter ; the birds nest at the angle
where a stem is broken off about 3 or 4 feet from the ground, the
bird laying its eggs on the top of the dead stump. It is thus an
easy prey for any carnivorous mammal or bird of prey, though
in the dense scrub its colouring would be good camouflage.
Gould was supposed to have found the birds breeding in
Tasmania, but Dr. Hamilton thinks that they do not breed there
now.

These birds find most of their food on the ground, which
consists of small grass seeds. They are also fond of dandelion
seeds, and the young live mainly on tender grass.
I saw about half a dozen males in the aviaiies of Dr. Hamilton,
they were beautiful birds and of quite a different green to the other
Grass Parrakeets, the large bright orange patch on the centre
of the abdomen is also very distinctive. Dr. Hamilton had the
great misfortune to lose all his hens through partitioning the
aviary and putting them in one division and the cocks in the other.
One night the hens had a fright and flew instinctively to where
the partition was and were all found the next morning with cracked
skulls. However he hopes to make another expedition to the
region where the bird is found and procure some more hens.
In books we are given to understand that the Orange-belly is like
the Elegant but with an orange patch on the abdomen, in reality
it is quite different and when one has once seen it it can never
be confused with the other bird.
The Rock Grass Parrakeet (, Neophema petrophila)
This bird has a rather restricted habitat and is found most
plentifully around the south-west coast of South Australia and
also on the outlying islands. It is a bird of the sea coast and is not
found far inland, it feeds on the seeds of various plants found on
the shore and cliff faces, where it also breeds.
It is rather like an Elegant, larger and much duller in colouring.
Where the breeding range of the Elegant meets that of the " Rock "
the two birds interbreed with the result that Elegants found within
this range are duller coloured than usual.
I saw a few in the shops in Adelaide and also a few in the
various aviaries of aviculturists, but I don't think it is a very
popular bird like the " Turquoisine " or " Splendid ", and it was
only in 1937 that it was bred for the first time in South Australia.
A few years ago I had some of these birds in England, but
found them delicate and bad livers ; they came to me with slight
eye trouble and never seemed to get over it.

The Hawfinch in Freedom and Captivity
{Coccothraustes coccothraustes coccothraustes )
By V. A. V. Carr
Could one describe the Hawfinch as rare ? It is one of our
most handsome birds and in captivity is surely as interesting as
any other species, yet eminent ornithologists who I know have
not come in contact with it to any great extent. This is no doubt
due to the early and very retiring habits of these birds.
The Hawfinch is certainly one of the easiest birds to recognize,
with its huge beak, orange or tawny-brown plumage, blue-black
quills, and black throat and lores. The female is a lighter colour
everywhere, having grey feathers where the male bird possesses
orange and tawny-brown feathers.
In Southern Warwickshire, South-East Gloucestershire, and
East Worcestershire this bird has a good range, favouring orchards,
tall hawthorn hedgerows, beech-woods, and other wooded sites
which offer the favourite foods. This latter point governs the
movements and localities of most species of birds and the Hawfinch
most of all. Provided one has the above-mentioned conditions
I think I am right in saying Mr. and Mrs. Hawfinch are not far
away.
They have a very distinctive note, especially at that time of the
year when our feathered friends are silent, and a note from any
one species of bird immediately strikes the ear. In the spring of
the year and during the breeding season it is not so distinctive,
for the Spotted Flycatcher and Robin make very similar sounds.
Whilst travelling from point to point they always fly at a
greater height than any other Finch, sometimes in ones and twos
or as many as ten or eleven. Their flight is undulating and they
utter their high-pitched distinctive " Click-click " note at regular
intervals, very low. Many times I have stopped in my steps to
discern high in the heavens the originator of the low " click "
sound which has reached my ears.
Their breeding season is comparatively early, and incubation
generally begins at the end of April and beginning of May. Their

choice of breeding site varies considerably, sometimes the nest is
found only a few feet above the ground in an apple or pear tree
in an orchard or garden ; sometimes in a tall hedgerow or finally
in the top of a cedar or Wellingtonia fir or cedar on the flat boughs
which grow out at right angles from the trunk, parallel to the
ground. One well-known bird photographer once asked me to find
him a Hawfinch nest, as he had not yet added that species to his
already lengthy list of studies for the bird was rare in the district in
which he lived ; this I doubted in my own mind and said so. A
few weeks afterwards he found six nests, belonging to six different
pairs within a few yards of one another in a hedgerow and he was
able to fulfill his ambition.
The nest is large, a layer of twigs is used as a foundation,
the cup shape of the nest being fastened on, lined with roots,
hair, and other fibrous material.
Four or five eggs are generally laid, the eggs are blue to greyish
green with streaks of blackish brown and a few spots of the same
colour. The eggs are of course larger than other Finches and are
very beautiful.
The youngsters are fed almost entirely on insects and it is almost
an impossibility to think of rearing them in captivity in any other
way. When fully developed and grown they are very easily catered
for and make ideal aviary or cage pets, living to a great age ; feeding
from the finger and delighting all and sundry with a delightful
song, consisting of two short and two long drawn out whistles on
an ascending scale.
When the primaries start showing on the youngsters' wings it
is quite possible to sex them with every accuracy and it is not with
many species of birds that one can do this until they have com-
menced to moult into their mature plumage at the end of August.
The cock youngsters have blue black feathers whilst the hens
have a dirtier appearance altogether. In immaturity they are
similarly clothed elsewhere with yellowish throats with specks and
barred flanks.
In country districts the Hawfinch is hated by a few who cherish
green peas and know that this Finch is capable of stripping a row
in a very short while. Fortunately for the Hawfinch the Jackdaw
is also fond of this delicacy and generally (rightly so) is blamed,
but unfortunately for the very despised Jackdaw, Mr. Hawfinch

knows a thing or two and appreciates the saying " the early bird
catches the worm 55 .
In wintertime haws, hornbeams, beech masts, ash keys, maple
and yew berries are readily eaten, whilst bullace, cherries, and
even plum are sampled earlier in the season.
With such a wide range of foods that abound more than any
other and always within reach, not being covered by snow or
frozen in ice, this bird is indeed fortunate and is one of the last
to suffer from any continued stretch of bad weather which other
less fortunate species have to suffer.
In view of all these varieties of foods and their secretive habits
should one term the Hawfinch a " rare species " ?
In captivity they will live on sunflower, hemp, canary, and
linseed whilst mealworms, gentles, and ants' eggs can be given when
rearing youngsters. Provided sufficient accommodation is available
they will agree with any other species of birds and in no way
harm them in the normal way. Indeed their aggressive looking
appearance, due no doubt to the distinctive large beak, is entirely
" phoney " and I would far sooner trust them 100 per cent more
than the Budgerigar.
Attempts have been made, as yet unsuccessful, to hybridize
with the Hawfinch.
The most favoured " wishful thinking " cross--shall I say--is
the Greenfinch-Hawfinch, and provided one has a very large
Greenfinch with a small hen Hawfinch I cannot honestly say it is
impossible, looking at it broad-mindedly. If one could only conjure
up visions of the results of such a mating, but why not ?

CALIFORNIA AVIARIES

<bodyText confidence="0.996327428571429" page_id="56350474"  page_num="42" year="" vol="">
I spent most of the month of September, 1941, in California
and in Arizona. What a change in the world since the longer visit
I paid to this charming part of the world in 1936-7, when I had
spent three months there, mostly in the company of Marquis
Hachisuka ! . . . I had then gathered, thanks to my friends'
help, hundreds of native birds, most of which had never been seen
in Europe. I brought them over, via Panama, after a long and
uncomfortable journey, with hardly any losses, and many, including
Yellow-billed Magpies, Mountain and Western Bluebirds, not
only lived well, but bred in our aviaries, particularly those
I presented to Mr. Ezra, who still possesses some of them. This
time, alas, there could be no question of bringing Californian birds
to Europe, but the kindness of my friends had not diminished and
made my visit as pleasant as ever.
I first attended the annual meeting of the American
Ornithologists' Union at Denver, Colorado, early in the month.
In the near-by Rocky Mountains I renewed my acquaintance
with such delightful species as the Pigmy Nuthatch, Clarke's
Nutcracker, Canada Jays, Western and Mountain Bluebirds,
Sapsuckers, etc.
I arrived at San Francisco by air on 6th September, with
Mr. J. C. Greenway and Mr. J. Moffitt. We went straight to the
latter's camp, some eighty miles to the north, among the giant
redwoods, and we spent there four days among some of the most
striking of the marvels of nature. On our return to San Francisco
I saw, in practical aviaries erected on the roof of the Museum, in
Golden Gate Park, the different Galapagos Finches brought over
two years ago by Mr. David Lack. Thanks to Messrs. Moffitt
and Kinsey they have been very intelligently kept and have bred.
Mr. Kinsey will soon send a complete report on the subject for
publication in our magazine.
The following days were spent at the home of Mr. A. Isenberg,
in a delightful part of the country, Palo Alto, some thirty miles
south of San Francisco, between the bay and the ocean. The
climate there is very even and only slight frosts are occasionally

experienced, so that most species of exotic birds can be left out of
doors all the year round with open shelters only. Mr. Isenburg&amp;apos;s
installation consists of a large and high aviary, well planted, with
four smaller compartments attached. There are also some small
cages in various parts of the very pretty garden, a flight, and some
cages in the house and, in a different section of the grounds, across
a river, another group of aviaries : one large flight and three
smaller compartments. Mr. and Mrs. Isenberg take care of their
birds with great skill. Their collection is large and varied, mostly
composed of exotic insectivorous and fruit-eating species. They
had great success, in recent years, with Donaldson&amp;apos;s and White-
breasted Touracos, the latter unfortunately never completely
rearing their young. This last summer, a Tricolor Spreo Starling
was raised. All sorts of Tanagers, Bulbuls, Robins, including lovely
Loo-Choo, Thrushes, Jays, and Magpies inhabit the aviaries.
There is a Central American Toucan and a Chinese Blue Magpie
nearly twenty years old. Some Asiatic Bearded Tits and a Japanese
Blue Flycatcher live in the house, as well as a hand-reared and
very tame California Woodpecker.
On the opposite side of San Francisco, north of the Bay, Mr. and
Mrs. Eric Kinsey have excellent and numerous aviaries, which
I described four years ago, packed with the most interesting
and unusual native birds, to which they restrict their activities.
Nearly all species are represented. The American Warblers aviary
is remarkable and contains over fifty of these lovely but difficult
birds, of over twelve different species. They are in perfect condition.
Nearby live some beautiful Woodpeckers and Sapsuckers. Further
on, other flights contain all sorts of Tits, Nuthatches, Tyrant
Flycatchers, Buntings, Thrushes, Troupials, etc. But space, in
these days of restriction, does not allow me to mention their
innumerable treasures. Perhaps Mr. Kinsey will describe them
himself for us one day. I must mention, however, his Humming-
birds, of which he has seven or eight, of four species, each in a very
nice compartment of a series of cages installed in one of his rooms.
Mr. and Mrs. Kinsey take care of their birds in the most exact
and scientific way, and they carry on important food experiments,
which prove of great value to aviculture.
I am sorry to say that Mrs. Bonnestell has now dispersed her
collection ; temporarily, I hope. She intends living in Tahiti in

the near future. But for her, as for so many of us, plans are difficult
to make these days and still more difficult to carry out.
The San Francisco Zoo has only a small bird collection, the
most interesting specimen being a fine lutino of the Yellow-naped
Amazon Parrot, of the brightest golden yellow colour. As I have
reported before, we have, at the Bronz Zoo, a magnificent blue
sport of the same species.
Pheasant and Pigeon breeders are still numerous in Northern
California and the rare species are kept up in fair numbers. But
my old friend, Mr. E. W. Gilford, has given up his Doves, a decision
that we all regret. In his and Mrs. Gifford's company we motored
east to Fair Oaks, near Sacramento, where I was happy to see
again Mr. and Mrs. W. Leland Smith and their rare game birds.
They possess now over thirty White Eared Pheasants (Crossoptilon
crossoptilon ), a good number having bred the last three years, for
the first time in captivity. It seems that this wonderful species
is now well established. There are also some all-black Kalijs
(G. moffitti), a pair of Imperials, and a pair of Rheinart's Argus,
which I presented to Mr. Smith some years ago. The latter have
bred well at Fair Oaks, as well as many other species of rare
Pheasants.
We visited, on the next day, the fine pheasantry of Mr. Johnson,
in the beautiful Napa Valley, and attended a meeting of the
California Game Birds Association, on the fine estate of Messrs.
Hooke, up in the mountains, where they are now establishing a
big Pheasant Farm.
I wish I had had more time to spend in Northern California
to visit more bird collections, but my time was limited and I wanted
to reserve some time for the South. In the welcome company of
Mr. Kinsey, I flew down to Los Angeles, where we were the guests
of our old friend, Mr. W. Sheffler. Even early in September
the temperature was perfect, nicely warm in the day and cool
at night. The climate of Southern California is just perfect for
bird keeping.
I never had the time to visit again the numerous collections
in the neighbourhood, but I hear that Parrakeet and Finch breeding
is going on as strong as ever. Mr. Sheffler has, near his house,
a fine aviary of a dozen compartments, radiating all around a
central shelter. It is full of very interesting foreign birds as well as

some of the native species. Among the latter there is a nice flock
of Mountain Bluebirds, a Red-headed Sapsucker, several California
Woodpeckers, different species of Tits and Nuthatches, a Cactus
Wren, a beautiful pair of Vermilion Flycatchers (Pyrocephalus
rubinus ), all perfectly acclimatized for several years. Among the
exotic birds I recognized an old Mexican Yellow Grosbeak, many
Australian Parrakeets, including Barnard's and Hooded, an almost
complete collection of Australian Finches, several Tinamous,
Quails, etc. In a shelter, large cages contain such treasures as
Tahitian Blue Lories and Kuhl's Lories, and seven lovely Elf Owls,
the only ever kept in captivity. These tiny Owlets, the size of
a Sparrow, live and nest in the giant cactus of Arizona. Mr. Sheffler
has hand-reared them, two years ago, and they even laid eggs in
their cage. They are perfectly tame and most attractive.
Dr. Ralph Woods still has his fine collection of rare Parrakeets
and small birds. I particularly admired his Pileated and
Turquoisines. Mr. H. Sedley has a perfect series of small aviaries
for Finches, looking very pretty among rare plants. He is very
successful with the rarer species and I admired five broods of such
a rarity as the Painted Finches. He also keeps and rears Mandarin
and Carolina Ducks.
Besides these three excellent private collections, I visited again
those of the San Diego Zoo, which are extremely fine, particularly
the Parrots. Broad-tails, Lories, and Cockatoos, especially, breed
in numbers. Among other rare birds I was interested to see several
Beccari's Doves (Gallicolumha beccarii). The San Diego Zoo benefits
by two great advantages : a perfect climate and the clever manage-
ment of Mrs. B. Benchley. The mammal collection is wonderful,
particularly the Apes ; the two Mountain Gorillas, fifteen years
old and weighing nearly 700 lbs., are absolutely remarkable.
Mr. Sheffler does not keep all his birds in Los Angeles ; the
greatest part of his collection is housed in Arizona, at Salome.
The drive through hundreds of miles of California and Arizona
desert is marvellous. These American deserts are, in reality, covered
with the most interesting vegetation of Cacti, Yuccas, and Xerophitic
trees and shrubs, full of birds, reptiles, and insects. Sunrises and
sunsets are very beautiful and the colour of the mountains changes
constantly. On account of the altitude (2,000 feet) Salome is hot
in the day and cool at night, and very dry. The numerous and

large aviaries are built around the walls of a courtyard, with an
additional double row in the middle. There are great numbers
of Australian Parrakeets and Cockatoos, Macaws, some Conures
and Paleornis, and particularly a very fine series of Lories, which
the climate suits especially well. Many species are represented
and most of them are breeding. There were, last summer, young
White-backed ( fuscata ) and Red Lories and a very curious and
pretty hybrid White-backed X Swainson's. Besides the Parrots,
there are many Birds of Prey, Pheasants, Pigeons, and Ducks.
Curiously enough, Crowned, Nicobar, and all the Australian
Pigeons and Doves have done badly in Arizona and had to be
removed.
On the way back to New York I stopped at St. Louis and
Chicago, and I took great pleasure in visiting again their fine zoos.
They both have very good bird collections, including Quetzals,
Birds of Paradise, and many other rarities. The large and beautiful
planted patio at St. Louis contains about ten Birds of Paradise,
as well as many other interesting species which live happily together,
among the thick tropical trees, and a large planted aviary is
inhabited by seven Cocks-of-the-Rock--a beautiful sight and a
great avicultural achievement.
In spite of everything, visiting aviaries is just as much fun to
me to-day as it has always been. But I realize only with difficulty
that I may never return home, and in any case I shall not find my
own birds again. It seems hardly possible that Cleres can never
be for me now but a lost paradise.

How many birds there are which do not at all resemble their
common names !
Newton speaks of the " unhappily-called Bearded Titmouse ",
and it is surely one of the least appropriately named of all, for the
bird is by no means a Titmouse, being very unlike the true Parida
and reminding one rather of the Colies ; nor is it at all bearded,
the black feathers on either side of the males' faces being more
in the nature of long moustaches. The name Reedling, however,
seems to me an altogether happy one for a little bird which could
scarcely exist other than among reed-beds.
It was in the autumn of 1938 that we received at Sterrebeek
some fifty of these birds, and if I remember rightly they came
from Poland.
We put them all into an empty cottage bedroom, fixing up
for them large twiggy branches and, in the corners, out of the
reach of mice, we fixed branches supporting a good quantity of
straw, and in this the birds very soon made their little roosting
places.
We kept them thus for some six or seven months and did not
lose a single one of them.
In the spring of 1939 twelve pairs were sent to New Zealand
and several more pairs to England, and it was, I believe, one of
these pairs which bred in Mr. Wormald's aviaries in 1940.
Bearded Reedlings are, of course, quite easy to keep in captivity,
but they seem to have a strong tendency to become over-fat.
It is curious that this should be so in such active birds and
it seems reasonable to suppose that they are either frugal feeders
by nature or that they are obliged in winter at least to work hard
for their food.
I think we see an analogous case in the Rock Grass Parrakeet
(.Neophema petrophila ) which, unlike the remainder of the group,
will very readily become fat in captivity. These birds live in
comparatively sterile rocky country where food must often be
hard to find. We fed the Reedlings on a proprietary insectile
mixture, which was mixed with mashed boiled potato, finely

<bodyText confidence="0.997393512820513" page_id="56350480"  page_num="48" year="" vol="">
crumbled bread, and a little hard-boiled egg, the potato and
bread forming by far the greater proportion of the mixture.
Occasionally we gave a little maw seed and it seems likely that
some seed is beneficial to these birds, for in winter when the small
molluscs and other water life are scarce they do feed largely on the
seeds of the reeds in which they live.
Maw seed seems to have been a favourite food for them, but
it may be that some species of grass seed would be more suitable.
They were not at any time given mealworms for fear that so
stimulating a food should be bad for them. We found them very
fond of lettuce leaves which we put in the water.
Even on this diet the birds became rather fat, but while it is not
claimed that the ingredients of the food in any way prevented
them from becoming over-fat, it is suggested that the mixture
was so very uninteresting that they did not eat more of it than
they could possibly help.
In connection with this aspect of bird-feeding there may be
something to learn : it is very easy to give birds too much of
the food they like and I dare say that many Lory foods have failed
through being made too sweet, but the main virtue of a plain diet
lies in the fact that the birds do not feed unless they are genuinely
hungry, though there is, no doubt, some danger of a plain diet
being insufficiently nourishing and varied.
The Reedlings were exceedingly fond of bathing and it was
very difficult to keep the floor even reasonably dry.
In the spring we put two pairs into a small outdoor aviary which
was planted with rushes and clumps of Arundinaria nitida , the
" Queen of Bamboos ", the soft green leaves of which showed off
the birds to perfection. There was duckweed in the small stream
which ran through the aviary, but I am not sure if the birds ate
any of it or whatever forms of their natural food it harboured.
Two of the birds were drowned in the stream : it is curious
that these birds of the fens should have been so silly, especially as
.there were shallow places where they could drink and bathe.
The other pair were still thriving when I last saw them at
the end of 1939 : during the summer the hen laid at least two
eggs but unluckily did not attempt to build, either on her own
account or in the small receptacles fixed in the bamboos, and the
eggs were broken on the ground.

first time, but it was subsequently revealed that Mr. Richardson
Carr had bred the species before, but in such a large aviary contain-

that some controversy arose as to whether he had bred them in
captivity within the accepted meaning of the term.

Neunzig {p. 68 g) says : " breeding has sometimes been achieved,"
but gives no details as to when and where. The first real success,
at any rate the first properly reported one, was in the U.K. in
1939, at the Keston Bird Farm, where five young birds from one
nest were reared : four perfect, the fifth healthy but stunted
from over-laying in the nest ; it was the youngest one which so
suffered. The breeder (Mr. Boosey) gave a full account in the
A.M. iggg, p. ggg, with a photo showing the mother and her five
young, which were full-grown by the time the photo was taken.

Sydney Porter told me, July, 1937, that this cross was bred in
Derby in 1936 and again in 1937 ; they were bred in a fowl-run
and fully reared ; Mr. Porter had seen them and could vouch
for the occurrence.
A cross with the male WHITE-FRONTED AMAZON is

November--all still alive, three fine birds, though the fourth
was rather a weakling.

The earliest record of their breeding is to be found in Latham's
Gen. Hist, of Birds , vol. ii , p. 209 {1822 ), as follows : " . . . we are
told that at Marmande in France a male and female produced
young ones for five or six years together. The eggs were generally
four, of which never more than three were good. The nest was
made in a cask which had one end knocked out and was filled with
saw-dust. . . . Pere Labat also mentions a pair which hatched
young ones in Paris." Rowley in his Ornithological Miscellany
{i, p. 163) says that according to Buffon a pair in confinement bred
and hatched their young for a series of five or six years, but that

later observation did not confirm this remarkable circumstance.
This Buffon record may refer to the same events as those given
by Latham ; if so, note there is nothing beyond " hatched ".
More recent records are more satisfactory. For the U.K. the
first (and I think only record) is to be found in the Zoologist, vol. ii, 84,
one young bird reared by Riccall in 1843. This record is quoted
in A.M. igoy, 55. Neunzig {p. yo8) says they have been bred several
times abroad : Lotze in Germany in 1900 is one case teste Butler,
ii, ig2. Mrs. Reid bred them in Madeira at least twice about 1908 ;
in that year two out of the three hatched were reared {A.M. igog,
1*9)-
(In October, 1937, Tavistock had one young bird reared till
a month old, but it died at that age before Miss Knobel, who
was hoping to hand-rear it, could take charge of it.)
GRAND EGLECTUS (No. 378), Larius roratus {Muller).
Neunzig {p. yi8) says that the first real success was with Frenzel
of Freiburg, who after many previous failures succeeded in
October, 1881. Since then they were bred abroad by others, but
I only know two records for the U.K., Miss Drummond in 1912,
the first, and Hartley in 1913. Miss Drummond's birds bred again
in 1913. See B.jY. igi 2 , 303, 338; 1313, 322, 373, F.B.C. Medal
awarded. For Hartley's success see B.JV. igig, 327. In Miss
Drummond's original account the name " Red-sided " was used,
but this having been found to be a mistake, it was corrected in
the Addenda to the Medal List, but not till after the supposed
breeding of the " Red-sided " {pectoralis) had been published.

RED-SIDED ECLECTUS, L. pectoralis {Muller).
First breeder Dr. Osman Hill, in Ceylon, in 1937-8. See a
full account by the breeder in A.M. igg8, 223. They were three
families each of one young bird : in August, 1937, a female ; in
December, 1937, a male ; a female, April, 1938, and the pair
nesting again at time of report. Dr. Hill says that the sexes are
different from the first plumage, and that the young remain in
the nest till almost as big as their parents. They were also bred
at the Taronga Zoo, Sydney, in 1938, when four young were
reared teste Patten, the Curator, in lit ., 6th January, 1934. They
were originally reported as " Grand Eclectus ". I presume
officially recorded somewhere, but I have not the reference.
BLUE-CROWNED PARRAKEET, Tanygnathus lucionensis
{Linn.).
In the Foreigner , iggy, p. ///, Mrs. Bonestell records the successful
breeding (a first) of the Parrakeet in California in 1937 ; two young
were hatched and both reared. The two young went to the Chicago
Zoo, and the parents reared young in the two following years,
Mrs. Bonestell told me by letter, March, 1940.
In 1936 the same pair had had one young, which had to be
hand-reared and which (although weakly) survived for four
months. This was mentioned in a letter to the A.M. igg6, p. 172.

THE GREY STRUTHIDEA

The Grey Struthidea is an odd bird, which on seeing for the
first time one simply cannot place, and the longer one's acquaintance
with it the more puzzled one becomes.
Ornithologists, when the bird was first described and who
only had its dried skin to go by, placed it with the Corvid a or
Crow-like birds. Now, knowing more about it, they have placed
it in a family on its own. Apparently it has no affinities with any
other bird. It is certainly no more related to Crows than to
Canaries ! Its only affinity to the Crows is its incessant
activity and unbounded curiosity. From the Finch-like beak and
the ability with which it husks and eats small seeds, one might
think it was some kind of a giant Finch. . This is accentuated by
the fact that it takes quick short runs when on the ground, apparently
picking up the while minute seeds very much like a Chaffinch or
Linnet.
If you saw the bird rolling over on the ground playing with
a stone or piece of orange peel in its claws you would know it had
no relationship to the Finches. And then its strange nest, like
that of no other bird, its peculiar calls and dances, and its extremely
varied diet put it apart from all other birds. And I think we should
be content to leave it at that and not try and fit it in between
any other avian families.
It is not a bird that would ever be popular even if it were
common. It is one of those which the old-time bird dealers would
have called a cc scientific bird ", meaning that it would only be
bought by a person interested in it from a scientific point of view.
Certainly at first sight it has little to recommend it except its
strangeness. It is very drably coloured, being a slatey grey, the
feathers of the head and neck having paler tips, the wings are
brownish, and the large fan-shaped tail, which is usually spread
and held at all angles is black glossed with green. It is about the
size of a Jay with a flatter head and a cruel looking eye, at least
it has a white iris and that always gives a bird a wicked look.

In this case it is not far from the truth for the Struthidea is an inveterate
bully, though he is not a vindictive one. (After I had written the
foregoing I thought I would make sure and see if the eye really
was white and I was amazed to find it a bright reddish-brown.)
On looking up Mathew's Birds of Australia I found the following:
" I can never understand why all authors describing this bird state
that it has pearly-white eyes. I have lived amongst these birds for
over twenty years and never seen a single bird with white eyes,
and I have often gone out purposely with field glasses and searched
flock after flock." However, I went out to watch the birds again
and found that in moments of excitement such as when it is spoken
to or given a tit-bit, the iris turns white. I have noticed other
birds have this peculiarity of changing the colour of the iris,
particularly Parrots.
The Struthidea will never hunt a bird to death like many others
will, and if a bird stands up for itself as the Azure-winged Magpies
will he will just leave them alone or come to some amicable under-
standing. Ground birds such as Ducks it treats abominably, partly
because they cannot retaliate. They certainly take a page from
the Nazi's book of rules ; any new bird placed in their aviary they
instantly bluster and bully, buffeting and screaming at it until it is
thoroughly cowed and when it has learned to respect them it is
left alone, within limits ! If a bird dares to hit back they are
most surprised, in fact I have never seen a bird register astonish-
ment as the Struthidea does. The way it can express its emotions
is amazing.
I have had a pair of these birds for many years now; they were
kindly given to me by a fellow member of the Avicultural Society
who had received them with a small consignment of Australian
birds and who did not quite know what to make of them. From
the day they arrived they have never " looked back ", in spite of
sleeping out during the worst winter experienced for nearly a
century when there were nearly 30* F. of frost. The birds had
a heated shelter which they could have gone into had they so
wanted.
Towards each other they are extremely affectionate and seem
to do everything in unison. When resting they sit pressed tight
against each other, so that one would think it was one bird with
two heads ! They go through all manner of quaint antics and

dances, behaving at times like mechanical toys and emitting very
unbird-like sounds, rather like a toy train being wound up.
They are fond of playing, very much like a kitten, lying on
their backs, rolling over and over, throwing up small stones or
orange peel in their claws and catching them again. For inquisitive-
ness they certainly beat the Crows.
In regard to food, they are the most omnivorous birds I have
ever come across. They will eat and enjoy almost everything--
soft food, fowl corn, seeds, green food, all manner of fruit and berries,
raw meat, insects, bread, and after they have enjoyed anything
they lick their mouths very much like a dog or cat.
For several years they have built their strange nest, but no
eggs have ever been laid. They seem to play round the nest most
of the year, and if anyone looks at them one of the birds will almost
at once settle in the nest and make strange aggrieved noises, as
much as to say, " This is mine and do not you dare touch it ! "
At first the nest used to get dissolved with the first autumn rains,
but we now put a sheet of plate glass on the wire netting of the
aviary above it.
This nest is an extraordinary affair and visitors to my aviaries
take quite a lot of convincing that it has not been made by human
hands. A fairly slender branch is chosen and at a fork a small
blob of wet mud is deposited and into this is worked fine strands
of dried grass. Eventually a foundation is made and upon this
the nest gradually takes shape. It is a perfectly spherical structure,
exactly the size and shape of a pint basin, and is finished off with
a rim, in fact it looks just as though someone had balanced an
earthen pudding basin on a slender branch !
Great ingenuity is shown in the construction of the nest, the
bird using its beak as a bricklayer his trowel. A layer of wet mud
is laid all round and into this is wound long strands of fine dried
grass. This is allowed to dry before another layer is put on, the
birds all the while smoothing and shaping the structure. Naturally
the birds' faces get very dirty, but as soon as a layer is completely
finished they have a good wash before starting on the next one.
They seem to dislike being looked at when making the nest and
one or both go through a strange motion that may be best described
as drawing themselves up to their full height and lowering them-
selves up and down with the feathers puffed out making them look

twice as large as they really are, meanwhile putting on a fierce
expression such as only a Struthidea can, and most obviously using
the worst words in the Struthidea language !
The birds look very funny when sitting on the nest, something
like a Canary might look sitting in an egg cup, in a larger way,
of course !
Sometimes a kind of madness seizes them and they dash about
as though in the utmost terror; this stops as suddenly as it starts
and the birds drop on to the floor and sit side by side.
The Struthidea is seldom imported and more often finds its way
to zoos than to private collections. Even in its own country it is
little known outside the restricted districts which it inhabits.
The following regarding its wild life is taken from Mathew's
Birds of Australia : " I found it inhabiting the pine ridges, as they
are termed by the colonists, bordering the extensive plains of the
Lower and Upper Namoi. ... It is always seen in small companies
of three or four together, on the topmost branches of the trees . . .,
was extremely quick and restless, leaping from branch to branch
in quick succession, at the same time throwing up and expanding
the tail and wings. ... A common bird throughout this district
(Cobbora, N.S.W.), in fact this is part of the true home of the
species although they usually keep to one class of country, seldom
to be met with away from where native pines are growing. . . .
Usually it is seen feeding on the ground in small flocks of from
six to two dozen, when disturbed they fly to the lower branches
of a tree close by, uttering their harsh grating cries and gradually
proceed to the higher branches in a series of leaps, uttering a short
peculiar squeaky note the while ; when they reach the higher
branches, they often cluster together on the same branch, side by
side, in fact they appear to cuddle up together as close as they
possibly can. . . . Flocks which have taken up their abode about
camps and dwellings become extremely tame and familiar. At
the present time a flock of twenty-four live about my house, roosting
in some pepper trees in the fowl-yard, but they are becoming rather
a nuisance, as they eat most of the chicken's food, showing little
fear ; they come almost to one's feet to feed, and as they seem
to have discovered the strawberries in the garden which are not
nearly ripe, I am beginning to think that this flock will have to
be destroyed."

In regard to food we are told that they feed on insects, beetles,
minute seeds, grasshoppers, etc.
They are quite the most interesting birds I have ever kept.
They are tame without being familiar, very hardy, no trouble to
feed in war-time as they eat anything, and their strange demeanour
and antics put them apart from any other bird I have ever kept.
They are so inseparable that it would be difficult to imagine one
existing without the other.

<bodyText confidence="0.972731148148148" page_id="56350489"  page_num="57" year="" vol="">
It is with much regret that we have to record the death, which
took place on 23rd February, 1942, of a Vice-President and one of
the oldest Members of our Society, Horatio Rutter Fillmer, at the
age of 79.
Although he had not taken an active part in the affairs of the
Society for many years past, Fillmer did probably more for it
than any other member during its early years, and had it not
been for him, it is doubtful if it would ever have existed at all.
It was in 1894 that Fillmer and a few other aviculturists, now
mostly gone from us, got together and started the young Society
on its career. The word " Aviculturist " did not exist before
that time. In a note explaining the objects of the new society,
above the signatures of C. S. Simpson and H. R. Fillmer, we read,
" it seems desirable and even necessary to invent or even acclimatize
a word which will denote # a person interested in the keeping and
breeding of birds ', and Aviculturist (being analogous to Horti-
culturist) will do perhaps as well as another. If anyone will suggest
a better, we shall be glad to adopt it--till then we beg to subscribe
ourselves Aviculturists."
Fillmer and his friend Dr. G. S. Simpson, both resident in
Brighton, acted as Treasurer and Secretary respectively during the
first years of the Society and together edited the first two volumes
of the Magazine. They were ably assisted by such experienced
aviculturists as Reginald Phillipps and Arthur G. Butler, but my
recollection is that Fillmer was the real mainspring which kept the
young society going.

Australia reports among other improvements to the gardens the conversion of
old brick shelter sheds into a row of cages for Owls, the sinking of a further well
for the better draining of the Penguin Pond, and the purchase of a refrigerator
for storing the fish for these birds. Fifty different species of birds, comprising
211 individuals, were bred during the year. A pair of Black-footed Penguins
from Africa reared one young one and at the time of the publication of the report
another pair had an immature chicken in the nest. The Australian Curlews,
which are now somewhat rare, reared two young, and a Razor-billed Curassow's
egg was successfully hatched in an incubator. The Society is to be congratulated
on its achievements and it is to be hoped that it will be able to carry on without
great difficulties in spite of the spread of the war area.

LOWER TEMPERATURES IN BIRD-ROOMS

It is probable that, for obvious reasons, many members will have been obliged
this winter to keep their birds in lower temperatures than they would have dared
to do in normal times, and it is, I think, possible that this may have led to the
discovery of certain species being very much more hardy than was formerly
supposed, and what is more important, that they may have done better in the
lower temperatures than ever they did in the higher ones.
There are, of course, the birds that are known to be delicate, but there are
many about which nothing in this respect is known with certainty and whose
owners have naturally been unwilling to risk at lower temperatures. It will be
recalled that it was mainly the bravery of Messrs. Boosey and Brooksbank that
revealed that four species of Grass Parrakeets hitherto regarded as only half-
hardy were really quite hardy, at least in southern England, and were far less
subject to illness without artificial heat than with it.
I remember that when Derbyan Parrakeets were rare they were treated as
half-hardy, but I have since seen a pair of them looking quite cheerful in 34 0 F.
of frost. When I used to keep a few of the African Sun-birds I found them much

less delicate than they were supposed to be--provided, of course, that they were
well acclimatized and in good plumage, and I feel sure that there are certain
birds which become very " soft " through being kept too warm, in which state
they are naturally much predisposed to chills.
It seems unlikely that the birds which will roost in boxes would need much
heat at night ; for instance some, at least, of the Trichoglossi do not need heat if
they have a good roosting box with sawdust in it, though in their particular case
there is some risk that they will use the box for nesting in mid-winter and some
danger if their liquid food should freeze solid during daylight.
Even during the best of the summer it is surprising how chilly the atmosphere
can be in the very early hours of the morning and I expect there are many summer
nights during which the temperature falls to 50* F.--yet there are surely few
birds which, when acclimatized, are considered too delicate to spend the summer
out of doors, while on the other hand 6 o*- 6 ^* F. and even more used to be a
common winter temperature in bird-rooms.
It is not, of course, suggested that birds should be kept in temperatures which
are uncomfortably low, but I do suggest that if members have been obliged to
keep supposedly delicate birds in fairly low temperatures this winter and have
found that they thrive in them, they will not fail to turn necessity to good account
by recording the facts in the Magazine.

DIET OF AMAZON PARROTS
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.9862545" page_id="56350491"  page_num="59" year="" vol="">
I read with interest Miss Knobel's article in the January-February issue of
the Magazine, especially about the varied diet which she gave to her Parrot.
Very probably Miss Knobel knows very much more about Amazon Parrots
than I do as I know they have been her speciality, but I have found that a varied
diet has been disastrous to these birds. An account of my experiences with
" Amazons " may be of some little interest and may prevent some future amateurs
from making the same mistakes.
Some years ago during various trips to the West Indian Islands, Central
and South America, I managed to get together a collection of many rare specimens
including nearly all the " Island " species, amongst which were the nearly extinct
Imperial, Bouquet's, Black-billed, and Caymen Island.
I had always been sorry for Amazon Parrots cooped up in inadequate cages
and fed upon dusty packet Parrot seed. I thought I would show how " Amazons "
should be kept. Most of my birds were in aviaries, some of the very tame ones
loose in the garden, and they were fed as far as possible on what I imagined was
their natural diet ; all manner of fruit and berries in season, such as hawthorn,
elder, hips, etc. ; plenty of green food, fresh corn on the cob (of which they are
excessively fond in a wild state), and various nuts, etc. ; of course, they always
had access to hard seed. Somehow this luxurious diet did not suit the birds,
first one and then the other died off. The post-mortems were always the same,
enlarged livers. Gradually I lost them nearly all and after that I somehow lost
interest in the remainder and these were relegated to ordinary Parrot cages
and, though not actually neglected, they received little beyond just plain seed.
After that I lost none. I still have these few remaining birds except the hen of
a pair of Red-throated which had eggs in an outdoor aviary ; the hen was
sitting and one night in May there was a sharp frost which caused the hen to
contract pneumonia and die. I never had a pair of birds so savage as these when
they had eggs.
After my experience and seeing " Amazons " in kitchens and " pubs " often
where you could cut the atmosphere with a knife kind of thing ! and where the
birds had been for ten or twenty years, I came to the conclusion that cage life
and a very frugal diet of plain seed is the best for Amazon Parrots.

Referring to one or two other interesting articles in the same issue of the
Magazine, I notice mention was made of the beautiful Grey-breasted Bullfinch
from Japan. I have had a good many of these birds at one time or another.
Although they came from a country with a climate perhaps colder than ours in
the winter, I found them the most delicate of all the seed-eaters I have ever kept.
They invariably died in a few months' time from pneumonic trouble. I wonder
if other readers have had the same experience ?
Mention is made by M. Delacour of lutino Fischer's Lovebirds ; I think
I nearly (!) possessed the only lutino " Peach-face " on record. It was given to
me by Sir Frederick Freake who suggested that I fetched it from his residence
about sixty miles away. As I was very busy at the time I asked if it could be sent
by rail. The travelling cage duly arrived but contained only a lovely corpse.
It had evidently been handled with the railway companies' usual " care " and
possibly thrown from out of the luggage van on to the platform. It was certainly one
of the loveliest birds I have ever seen, a clear bright golden yellow, with white
rump and the normal pink face. &amp;apos;The railway company offered me 4.1. 6 d. in

The Wigeon is one of the most important of our sporting Ducks
forming a useful item in our food supply as large numbers
are killed for food every year. Its range is a very wide one including
the whole of Europe, the greater part of Asia, North Africa, and
North-Eastern America. It breeds principally in its northern
habitat, visiting the more southern localities as a winter migrant.
So far as Great Britain is concerned its breeding range is more or
less confined to Scotland, the most Northern English Counties, and
Northern Ireland, though cases have been recorded of its breeding
even in the south of England. In the north its breeding range has
extended considerably in recent years and the species has become
more or less a resident, though in other parts of Great Britain it is
a winter visitor arriving, often in very large numbers, from
September until the end of the year, the size of the flocks being an
indication of the severity of the weather in the north of Europe.
It keeps to the coast wherever sea-grass (Z os ^ era ) grows, for that is
a food that it loves, though failing that, it will feed contentedly
upon young and tender meadow grass as well as many kinds of
water plants. Waterfowl enthusiasts should remember that Wigeon
are like Geese in their fondness for young grass and it is hopeless
to try to keep them satisfactorily without a good supply.
The Wigeon has become nocturnal in its feeding habits as a
result of the constant persecution that it has had to endure for so
many generations and if the weather is fairly calm during those
winter days when it is with us, large flocks spend the daylight hours
resting upon the sea, coming in when darkness falls to feed upon

the J^osterci on the mudflats. In stormy weather they seek the
shelter of estuaries or inland waters such as Holkham Lake in
Norfolk where strict protection is afforded them, a privilege of
which thousands avail themselves, as we are told by Mr. Riviere.
In March the flocks of Wigeon that have spent the winter with
us commence their return passage to their northern breeding haunts
on the moorlands of Scandinavia, Iceland, or Russia.
The few recorded cases of the Wigeon breeding in the south
may be accounted for by birds that have wandered from private
collections as it is deservedly popular with waterfowl keepers.
A full-winged Wigeon duck bred for several years in succession
in the Zoological Gardens, her mate being, a pinioned bird. The
story of that bird is perhaps worth telling.
Mr. John Young, for many years head gardener at the Zoo,
was a dour Scotsman and a master of his profession. No one was
ever prouder of his flower-beds and lawns and woe betide any
person or animal who should injure a plant or bloom. " Visitors,"
he would say, " may come to the Zoo to see the animals, but it is
a sure fact that many come to see the flowers, and how would
the animals look if there were no flowers to set them off." And
who shall say that he was not right ? He certainly did give us a
wonderful show and I know for a fact that many gardeners came,
sometimes from considerable distances, to see how Johnnie Young
did it. A high official was very anxious to have Peacocks loose in
the gardens, but Young knew that these were bad gardeners and
opposed the idea so vigorously that it was dropped.
One day he saw, to his annoyance, a Duck walking on the
lawn beside a bed of choice flowers and promptly called to some
of his men to drive it into the enclosure of the Three-island Pond ;
but she--it was a Wigeon Duck--needed no driving. Opening her
wings she cleared the fence and alighted on the pond where she
was greeted by her mate with every show of affection. " Can't
you catch her and cut her wing," said Mr. Young to me when
I next met him, so I pointed out to him how very delightful it was
to have a wild bird of this kind with full powers of flight, so happy
and contented that she would not think of flying away although
quite capable of doing so. " But will she damage the flowers ? "
he asked. " No, not in the least," I said, " though she may help you
to keep the grass cut. What she may do is to make her nest some-

where amongst your flowers, and if she does so she will be very
careful not to disturb anything ; and I know you will see that she
is not frightened or disturbed in any way, for to have a Wigeon
nesting anywhere in the South of England is very unusual though
it would be an ordinary enough occurrence in Scotland." " So
they nest in Bonnie Scotland do they, well if she nests here we will
not disturb her." So the Wigeon was allowed to wander on the
lawns and eat the grass, and one day, when she was seen poking
about in a bed of wallflowers she was not interfered with.
A fortnight or so later Mr. Young met me with a twinkle in his
eye. " She is there all right, right in the middle of the wallflowers,
but so difficult to see that if I had not been looking for her and
happened to catch sight of her eye I should never have spotted her,"
he said. " Now will she be off by the time I want to take up those
wallflower plants and do my summer bedding ? " I told him that
she would be about twenty-eight days from the day she com-
menced to sit and, like the good fellow he was, he agreed to defer
the summer bedding as long as should be necessary.
One day, when I thought it was nearly time for her to be off,
I chanced to go round that way and found, to my horror, gardeners
digging the bed. Mr. Young was not far off, and as I approached
him to ask what this meant, he met me with a smile on his face.
" Ah," he said, " you should have been here early and you would
have seen your Duck with eight of the bonniest fluffy bairns you
ever saw, walking round the fence and trying to lead her family
to water. I went and opened the gate for her and in she walked
as proud as Punch." And sure enough there she was on the water
with all her family around her.
There are only three species of Wigeon, all with a marked
family likeness and very distinct from the other Ducks of the genus
Anas into which they have been placed by present-day systematists ;
they are the Common Wigeon, Anas ( Mareca) penelope , the American

REARING OF YOUNG ARCTIC DUCK
By Ronald Stevens
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999658694444445" page_id="56350502"  page_num="64" year="" vol="">
In the last waterfowl number of this magazine Mr. John
Yealland wrote a most interesting and helpful article on rearing
Icelandic ducklings. This has prompted me to write down my
experiences and the do's and don'ts that I have drawn from them.
There is a great fascination in rearing the young of Arctic Duck,
and it is noticeable that all those people who are really keen on
keeping waterfowl sooner or later make the attempt. It is difficult,
simply because there is so much to discover and learn, and it is
certainly troublesome, but that does not matter when one is
enthusiastic and has all the necessary time. Perfectly normal,
healthy specimens of Longtail, Scoter, Barrow's Goldeneye, and
Harlequin have been reared and kept successfully which all goes
to show that it can be done.
The species in question, which only represent the easily
procurable of the Arctic Duck through the medium of eggs from
Iceland, are among the most strikingly beautiful of those we know.
They are utterly fascinating, they become an obsession--to such
an extent that I know of an instance where a pond has been built
round these Ducks; so to speak. It was made of concrete and rock,
and dwarf trees and scrubby bushes that are characteristic of
Iceland gave the correct impression of the severity and aridity of
that country.
Trouble begins from the moment you have decided to try
rearing Icelanders, for it simply will not do merely to ask a fisherman
friend to bring a few eggs back with him. He must be told to take
eggs only from incomplete clutches, otherwise how is he to know
that germination has not started ? A special egg-travelling box
must be given him before he goes. He must be told that this box
with its precious load must not be subjected to a single heavy jolt
during the whole of its journey and that it must be carefully turned
over once a day. Furthermore when he returns to Hull or Leith
you must be there to meet him to receive the eggs and to watch
over them during their railway journey to your home. Beware
of hasty porters !
When you have got the eggs safely to your home let them rest
while you prepare sitting coops for the bantams which alone are

suitable to perform fostermother duties. After the eggs have been
down ten days test them and throw out the bad ones as they not
only reduce the temperature of the whole nest but are almost
certain to burst later on and spoil the good ones.
Longtail hatch in twenty-three days, Scoter take twenty-five,
Barrow's Goldeneye the same, and Harlequin about twenty-eight
under bantams. When the ducklings are twenty-four hours old put
them out in little pens, each having its own little pond, of a few
feet square, with clean water running constantly through it. Do
not put more than four Longtail and Harlequin ducklings to a
bantam, six Scoter and Goldeneye, otherwise the fostermothers
would remain permanently wet underneath and the ducklings
being unable to get dry would die of pneumonia. Longtails and
Harlequins are much the smallest--then why only four to a bantam ?
Because they need every scrap of care you can give them and must
be given the best possible chance from the beginning, being the
most difficult to rear.
The bantam is a necessary evil. When allowed liberty in the
pen she is an absolute nuisance, a constant menace to the ducklings,
and she pollutes the ground. She must be tethered at one end of
the pen which should be coopless and having a short sloping roof
to give protection from rain and shade, the latter being particularly
necessary to these ducklings. She must be tethered in the middle
of the end of the pen so that she cannot reach a corner. It will
be found that the ducklings often crowd into a corner on the
approach of anyone, and the bantam, if given a chance, would
join them there and stand all over them, using them as if they
were a doormat. In the bantam's own Lebensraum corn and water
will be available to her, and do not forget to put the water in a tall
receptacle so that it is inaccessible to the ducklings which would
otherwise soon make of it a sink of putridity. For them water must
be of the purest always.
Longtail, Scoter, and Goldeneye soon settle down happily in
their nurseries. Not so the Harlequins. They are miserable, peevish,
restless little wretches, always wanting something that you cannot
give. In the last summer before the war, realizing that they had
to be treated psychologically as well as biologically I put them in
the first of a line of pens, the little cement pond of which was fed
directly by the tap. I pushed a pebble into this tap which forced

the water out at all angles in fierce little jets which foamed the
little pond up and made the water dance magnificently. Well
they bobbed like corks on it and appeared to enjoy themselves
comparatively. It was at least a feeble effort to imitate the turbulent
waters of their native streams.
With regard to feeding--" Don&amp;apos;t , 55 as Mr. Punch would say.
At least not for the first forty-eight hours, however hungry they
may appear. Icelandic ducklings, for some reason or other, absorb
their egg-yolks very slowly and if you feed them too early they are
sure to die of congestion. On the day following their first forty-
eight hours you may give them just a pinch at a time, certainly
do not leave food with them.
When they are seventy-two hours old you may feed biscuit
meal, just the same as you do to other ducklings, to the Longtail,
Scoter, and Goldeneye, but do not give it to the Harlequins because
they will not eat it anyway. It will not do the others much good,
but it will do no harm and will, at any rate, accustom them to
plain fare for their adult life. For the same reason you may keep
it before Harlies when they are feathered, they will not eat it before.
What, then, is the ideal food for these ducklings ? I should
say mosquito larvae if you can farm them in sufficient quantities.
Personally I have no idea how to go about this but have enormous
respect for a friend who does. So, like others, I give maggots.
It is a repulsive business but you get used to it. I am so inured to
it now that I keep a huge maggatorium going, right on top of a
hill for sentimental reasons. When it is in full flower it yields a
bucketful or more of maggots daily. I feed it with whole carcases
of sheep and cattle. It is worth it all when you see your precious
Icelanders, sick and weary of other blandishments, fall on them
with the utmost greed. But do be careful. Remember that live
maggots sometimes kill ducklings up to a week old and that it is
easy to give too many. Drown them before feeding very young
ducklings. Their skins are somewhat tough and indigestible so
feed them sparingly. After the war I mean to carry my maggotorium
a stage further and produce the perfect insect.
In their early weeks the ducklings expect, and must have, their
first feed at dawn. You should, of course, be there to give it them
in dressing-gown and slippers. While thus attired you will be led
into giving them all sorts of extra attentions for their comfort and

well-being and this counts a lot--but--enthusiasm for such creatures
is at its lowest ebb at this hour and you may be forgiven if instead
you sneak up at night and throw a few maggots into their ponds
to be ready there for the first feed in the early hours.
It is most important to see that the ducklings have the utmost
amount of exercise in their restricted enclosures. Running round
and round their pens is no exercise, at least it is not of the right
kind. They simply must be kept on and under the water. Throw
the maggots into their ponds and make them dive for them. This
is their finest exercise. Incidentally the ponds should be about
14 or 15 inches deep for this very reason.
Now let us study the ills that these peculiar people are subject
to, the guarding from which makes their rearing so difficult. In
the first place the bantam is a fruitful source of disease. Tethered
at one end of the pen she is kept as harmless as it is possible to
make her, but remove the droppings every day. Whenever the
days are hot and sunny take her out and put her back before the
cool of the evening. If the weather be fine remove her altogether
on the tenth day. Scoters are awful babies. They will continue
to sit under her for weeks if you give them the chance. If they do
this they are ruined. They might live, but will grow into dreadful,
dried-up objects, afraid to go on the water because of the fearful
drenching they would get. They have not a suspicion of natural
oil in their feathers because they are suffering from Nephritis, the
bane of Icelandic ducklings, largely brought about through lack
of oxygen, through too much burrowing into the bantam's breast
feathers. Another cause of this disease is too much fat in their
biscuit meal and too little of that particular vitamin supplied by
watercress which is the only kind of green food I have ever got
Icelanders to eat.
Another complaint to be guarded against is congestion. Scoters
are bad sufferers in this respect while they are very young. I am
not now thinking of the prolonged absorption of the egg-yolk
already dealt with, but of their awful greed which also causes it.
I find it helps if you give them a baking-tinful of water with Epsom
Salts in once a day. You can give them one of their maggot feeds
in it. No doubt the leathery skins of the maggots is partly responsible.
Yet another trouble to which Scoters are particularly liable is
worms. They show signs of this generally when they are three-

quarters grown by their thighs coming out of place, so that when
they are on the water they are splayed out in the manner of frogs
lying on the water's surface, and they soon cease to walk. One
season my brother and I had a magnificent lot of Scoter. We had
brought them through practically without a single loss, but when
they were nearly full grown, and we were congratulating ourselves,
more than half of them started going out of shape ! I got in touch
with my ever-helpful friend Dr. Derscheid and was surprised to
learn that they could show signs of worms so early in life. He told
me to give minced garlic in their food as a preventative and curative.
I have done it since and it works.
Biologically, Scoters are most provoking things. They race ahead
of the other species in growth and put on meat like good sensible
farmyard ducklings. You can almost see them grow and then you
are tempted to relax a little your ceaseless vigilance and they crash
into some stupid complaint ! But you forgive them for the fat,
bouncing boys that they are. Would that Harlequins and Longtails
were as frank in their failings instead of passing on through apparent
discontent. Goldeneye are comparatively easy to rear.
After the foster-mothers have been removed we open up the
pens by removing the separating boards, thus giving the Icelanders
one long pen with an uninterrupted trough of water running
throughout. This is a great advantage. It gives them greater scope
for exercise while preparing them for the larger world they are
to encounter later. At the same time catch&amp;apos;ng them up is avoided,
which does them harm in their duckling days. Any sudden change
of scene at this age can only bring fresh anxieties. \0x2666 By the time
they are three-quarters grown, however, they may with advantage
be removed to a larger pond. This must contain pure water, must
be reasonably deep to give them scope for diving, and must not
contain masses of blanket weed, otherwise they will drown in it.
Continue to throw maggots, three times a day, into the deep
water, while weaning them on to more ordinary food. This can
be wheat left in the shallows so you can see how they are eating it.
Also throw them best quality broken wholemeal dog biscuits
containing meat, previously soaked. This becomes in time, with
wheat, their staple food.
The four species can be reared. We have kept many individual
specimens of them all for years. What is required is a method of

rearing them which will make their upbringing as great a
certainty as, say, Tufted or Pochard. I am convinced this can be
done if we all pool our experiences. This will be something to
look forward to after the war.
The adult male Harlequin is perhaps the most arresting in
appearance. In habits, too, he is extremely lively and interesting.
His conversational voice resembles two bits of china being grated
together. The Longtail's call is an inspiration. Personally, though,
I always feel that this bird suffers more than most other duck through
being pinioned from an aesthetic point of view. To me the Scoter
is a completely satisfactory Duck. I like his substance, the contrast
with other Ducks of his rook-black body and the brilliantly yellow
boss on his bill. I like his subdued but clear whistle when he courts
his Duck. And when you hold him in the hand how plump and
muscular he is, how paradoxically dazzling in his sombre hue !

or less intimacy with the wild Ducks and Geese of the North
American continent the waterfowl numbers of the Avicultural
Magazine are always of absorbing interest. The last such number
was no exception and in it I also found something which struck me
as decidedly surprising. This was Mr. Yealland's suggestion that
while the Diving Ducks are quite intelligent, the Surface-feeders
are rather stupid. Over here, in America, the consensus of informed
opinion, which naturally includes that of the sportsman as well
as of the aviculturist, is that the Surface-feeders are infinitely more
intelligent than the Divers.
Of course this difference of opinion may be because
Mr. Yealland's possibly is based upon observances of species with
which Americans are not very familiar and which may not have

included certain North American Ducks such as the Ruddy
[Erismatura jamaicensis) and the Bufflehead (Choritonetta albeola).
I mention these two small Divers in particular because they
appear almost unknown to European fanciers. While one or the
other may have been exported in rare instances I believe I am
correct in stating that neither has been bred outside the United
States and the Dominion of Canada. This seems strange for,
despite the singular lack of intelligence each displays in the pro-
tection of its life in the wild, they are exceptionally interesting and
desirable from an avicultural standpoint. Especially is this true of
the Ruddy, easily recognized because of its very unusual habit of
carrying the tail at right angles to the body so that, with the
feathers in the middle pointing straight up and all well separated
and widely fanned out, it forms almost a perfect semi-circle. They
are quite small, possibly the size of Common Teal, but being Divers
they are of cobbier shape. While the duck is of a plain brownish
colour that of the drake is mostly of an attractive reddish brown.
His cheeks are ornamented with large triangular white patches
and his retrousse bill is bright blue.
Moreover Ruddies are one of the few species of Duck in which
both parents share in the rearing of the young. A pair of these
small Ducks convoying with the most solicitous care their brood
of tiny young naturally is a charming sight. But should danger
threaten it immediately becomes one to arouse the admiration
of even the most calloused observer, for Ruddies are imbued with
a degree of courage out of all proportion to their small size. In
defence of the young either duck or drake will hurl itself against
any enemy, however formidable, and with an utter disregard for
its own safety.
Once, while watching a family of Ruddies on a small isolated
pond, I saw one of the ducklings suddenly dragged beneath the
surface. As there were no large fish in the pond I knew the attacker
must be a snapping-turtle, dread scourge of our waterfowl on fresh
waters. Instantly the drake dashed to the spot, indicated by
widening circles of ripples, and dived repeatedly in a futile effort
to rescue his offspring. And I have no doubt that if he succeeded
in locating the turtle under water that he attacked it to the best of
his ability. Next day, on returning to the pond with a number of
stout fishing lines, the hooks baited with pieces of meat, I noticed

<bodyText confidence="0.986356230769231" page_id="56350509"  page_num="71" year="" vol="">
that another duckling had vanished. I set my lines and on the
following day had the satisfaction of hauling out a pair of snappers
of about 8 lb. weight each. Had I not come to the rescue they no
doubt would have accounted for the entire Ruddy family.
Buffleheads, too, are both pretty and interesting as well as
small. The ducks average well under a pound in weight, though
the considerably larger drakes sometimes will weigh as much as
a pound and a half. In the natural state the ducks almost invariably
lay their eggs in old nesting holes bored in tree-trunks by Flickers.
These holes rarely measure as much as 3J inches in diameter, which
should give one a very fair idea of the size of the ducks. The name
Bufflehead is derived from the long fluffy feathers of the head which
make it appear much larger than it really is. In shape it is like
that of the Goldeneye. The drake Bufflehead is largely white,
with a black back and his white head is ornamented with two small
green patches and a still smaller one of red. The duck is greyish-
black and white. Both Ruddies and Buffleheads are regularly
bred by certain of our fanciers fortunate enough to be able to
supply their requirements. As is the case with most Divers these
are deep and clean water and an abundance of animal food, some
of which should be live.
In considering the intelligence of North American Ducks it is
pertinent to remark that Ruddies and Buffleheads, both Divers,
show so very little in protecting their skins that they have suffered
greater relative losses than any of our other species. In fact so
scarce have the Buffleheads in particular become that during the
open season the sportsman is permitted to shoot but three in a day.
To be sure but a single Wood Duck (Carolina) may be included
in a day's bag, but these always have been a comparatively rare
species, while Buffleheads formerly were present in countless
thousands.
Obviously the best and fairest way to judge the capabilities of
wild species is to observe them under identical natural conditions.
Each will then display to the best advantage such intelligence as
it may possess in those two pursuits ever of the greatest importance
to creatures of the wild : the obtaining of food and the preservation
of its life.
For the purpose of studying in great variety the waterfowl of
North America I doubt if there is a better or more accessible place

than Chesapeake Bay, on the Middle Atlantic seaboard. Fed by
two large rivers, the Susquehanna and the Potomac, and many
smaller streams, the waters of this great bay stretch inland a hundred
and fifty miles or more from where they join the sea. They are
dotted with many islands, streaked with sand and gravel bars, and
the frequent broad and very shallow reaches are bordered with wide
expanses of marsh, criss-crossed by a multitude of creeks and smaller
waterways and pock-marked by countless ponds and pot-holes.
It was along Chesapeake that much of my waterfowl education
was obtained.
Here are to be found waterfowl foods in abundance, and
because the salinity of the waters varies from quite fresh to as salty
as that of the sea, in great variety. In short, and to use a hackneyed
phrase, Chesapeake Bay and its adjoining marshes are a veritable
waterfowl paradise, for in sharp contrast to the abundant food
supply there are comparatively few enemies. Of these man is, of
course, the most dangerous, but his hostile activities are limited
to a couple of months each year.
During these two months he may legally take a daily bag of
no more than ten Ducks, of which but three may be Redheads
(.Nyroca americana) or Buffleheads and only one a Wood Duck
(Carolina), while Swans, Snow Geese, and Brant (Branta bernicla
hrota) are protected at all times. In the taking of waterfowl the
sportsman may do so only by means of a gun fired from the shoulder
and no larger than a ten bore. The use of live decoy Ducks and
the baiting of areas with grain for the purpose of attracting water-
fowl is prohibited. Shooting is lawful only between sunrise and
4 p.m.
Small wonder then that once their breeding activities for the
year are over there is each autumn a great gathering of the waterfowl
clans on and about Chesapeake. About the only important absentees
are the Eider Ducks, certain of the Snow Geese, Black-bellied and
Fulvous Tree Ducks, and Trumpeter Swans, none of which include
Chesapeake in their range.
Incidentally Trumpeter Swans of recent years have been showing
so steady if rather slow an increase that fears for their survival in
the wild are gradually subsiding. Twenty years ago, with certainly
no more than six or eight pairs in the entire United States, the
extinction of the species here was regarded as inevitable. These

few birds lived in Yellowstone National Park and in the adjoining
Red Rock Lake district, both wild life sanctuaries, where they
were and are under the more or less constant surveillance of forest
rangers. Because of their great size and restricted range, for they
do not migrate, it has been a comparatively simple matter to keep
a quite accurate check on the birds. By 1935 they had increased
to 75, and according to this year's census there are now a total of 211,
of which 142 are adults and 69 cygnets. In addition to these there
are quite a number of Trumpeters in British Columbia where they
are as strictly protected as here. In 1936 Major Allan Brooks,
who undoubtedly knows more about the Trumpeters of British
Columbia than anyone else, told me a flock of 250 had spent the
winter in the vicinity of Steward Lake and that there were known
to be many others in various remote places. To say that there are
to-day close to a thousand Trumpeters in existence probably would
be no exaggeration, and as their only natural enemies are the coyote
and the Raven it would seem that these magnificent and majestic
birds have better than a fair chance of continued existence in their
natural haunts.
Another of our species which had seemed doomed is the
incomparably graceful Brant. But this was entirely due to the
almost complete disappearance of eel-grass, practically their only
food, a phenomenon which was observed, I believe, in Europe as
well as here. The trouble at first was thought to have been due
to pollution of the water by refuse oil from ships. But I understand
it later was diagnosed as a disease which now appears to have run
its course, for the grass has been reappearing in its former abundance
and with it happily has come an increase of Brant.
One of the water-grasses which grows abundantly in Chesapeake
Bay is wild celery (Valisneria spiralis ), favourite food of all waterfowl
which can obtain it and one which imparts a delicious flavour to
the flesh of those which feed upon it. Its fondness for this grass is
responsible both for the Latin name, Eyroca valisineria , of the Canvas-
back Duck and for its being considered an epicurean delight. The
flesh of the Canvasback of the west, where the grass is not found,
is far inferior to that of the Chesapeake bird. In fact it not infre-
quently is rank and unpalatable.
But there are times when all the celery which grew in very
shallow water has been eaten and when it is available only at depths

beyond the diving powers of the Surface-feeders which then perforce
must go without--all save the Wigeon. Back beyond the memory
of man this canny fowl discovered a way by which it might eat its
fill of the delectable grass, quite regardless of the depth at which
it grew and without having to work very hard to secure it.
The Wigeon's method is the essence of simplicity. It merely
joins a flock of feeding Divers, Ganvasbacks let us say, and when
one of these comes to the surface, breathless from its dive and with
its beak full of celery, the Wigeon snatches the prize and makes off.
Time and again I have lain in concealment and watched this
performance through binoculars with mingled feelings. The
Wigeon's actions were amusing ; the stupidity of the Ganvasbacks
in allowing themselves to be persistently robbed by the relatively
puny Wigeon, exasperating. Yet never once did I see a Canvasback
show the slightest resentment. Perhaps it is that they are philosophers
who regard the Wigeon as an unavoidable nuisance and that the
quickest way to get their own dinners, therefore, is to see that he
is served first. However this may be surely there can be no question
as to which, the Surface-feeder or the Diver, shows the greater
acumen. And mind you the&amp;apos;Wigeon "plays no favourites",
he will as soon rob one species of Diver as another.
In procuring its food the methods of the Diving Duck are purely
instinctive, monotonously the same, and require no particular
intelligence. It selects a stretch of water and makes a few exploratory
dives to the bottom until it finds a place where food is abundant.
Thereafter that place becomes its regular dining-room to which it
returns at intervals as long as the food supply holds out.
The ways of the Surface-feeder in making its living, on the other
hand, are many and various, often requiring both intelligence and
initiative. It feeds both on and below the surface of the water and
sometimes even on dry land. On the surface it finds floating seeds
and the foliage of water plants. In shallow water it " tips up "
raising the stern and thrusting the beak to the bottom in search of
plant root-stocks, such as wapato, or " duck potato " and of sunken
seeds. At other times it reverses the process and, lowering the stern,
it scratches the bottom vigorously with its toe-nails in quest of
soft-shelled clams embedded in the mud. These are not really soft-
shelled at all ; but their shells are softer than those of the hard-
shelled clams. They are long and narrow and the larger Ducks will

<bodyText confidence="0.99731982051282" page_id="56350513"  page_num="75" year="" vol="">
swallow whole clams two inches or more in length. When rations
in the marsh run low the Surface-feeder repairs to the land, there
to feed on berries, grass, gleanings from the Stubblefields, and
acorns and beech-mast in the woods. And at all times, on land or
water, he " keeps his weather eye peeled " for whatever small
animal life may be about : snails and slugs, small frogs and
tadpoles, insects of all kinds, shrimps, and even mice.
If the Surface-feeder cannot get food one way he tries another,
and rarely indeed does he suffer from starvation as so often happens
to the Diver. At times when hard weather has frozen the water
over their feeding grounds in sound or harbour thousands of our
Diving Ducks have starved to death simply because they had not
sufficient wit to accept the tip, once the freezing process had set in,
and so to fly away southward. At such times I have chopped through
the ice and pulled out the floating fragments with a rake, thus
forming a little pond. Almost instantly, and before I would have
retired even so far as a hundred feet, such a pond would be packed
with frantically feeding Ducks, many so weak they were able to
dive only at widely separated intervals.
In captivity, too, the Surface-feeders show more intelligence
than the Divers in securing food, or so it always has seemed to me.
Rear Black Ducks (Anas rubripes ), Carolinas, or Teal close to a garden,
where a good deal of digging naturally is done, and you will be
astonished at how quickly they will learn the meaning of a spade.
Appear with one in your hand and every Surface-feeding duckling
in sight will rush to join in the prospective feast so enthusiastically
that you will have to " watch your step 55 lest you tread them
underfoot, and your spade lest you injure them as they plunge
headlong into the hole to seize any worms uncovered as the earth
is lifted out. By the time such Divers as may be about become
aware of what's afoot the last worm generally will have been
gobbled up.
One day I took a spade from a shed, tossed it into a barrow, and
started off along a garden path. My wife called out to look behind
me. Trotting along expectantly at my heels were eight- week-old
Carolinas. Four young Goldeneyes which had been with the
Carolinas remained behind on the lawn. But the Carolinas, having
caught a glimpse of the spade and knowing what it portended,
did not propose to be left out of a possible worm banquet. I have

often noticed, too, that young Surface-feeders being reared in
captivity are much quicker than Divers to recognize danger, as in
the sudden appearance of a cat, and to dispose themselves in places
of safety. Of course this may be. due to heredity, instinct, and the
greater ease and celerity which with the Surface-feeders move on
land. But the instant recognition of a spade on the part of the
Garolinas certainly was not. That, I take it, was. the result of
intelligent observation which the Goldeneyes appeared to lack.
In the natural state Surface-feeders are quick to notice and to
shy away from anything which appears in the least unusual and to
which Divers often will pay not the slightest attention. Of our
Divers without doubt the wariest is the Goldeneye. Yet it will pitch
in without ceremony among a flock of even the clumsiest and most
ill-painted decoys provided these have been set where it has been
accustomed to feeding and that the gunner remains motionless,
though he need not be well concealed. Certainly this is something
only an exceptionally unsophisticated Surface-feeder would ever do.
A favourite shooting device on Chesapeake and other waters
long has been the " battery This is a long coffin-shaped box in
which the gunner lies prone and which is then sunk to within a few
inches of the surface of the water by means of weights. To keep it
from being swamped by waves wide canvas floats are attached to it
and spread out over the water. A couple of hundred decoys are
anchored near by. Diving Ducks will come to such a "rig" without
hesitation, but rarely indeed will a Surface-feeder fall victim to
the battery shooter.
To entice these within range the gunner must be perfectly
concealed in a quite natural-looking blind and his decoys not
only must be exact replicas of living birds, but they must be so
made as to ride the water in a natural manner. If the blind has
been newly erected it usually will cause the knowing Surface-feeder
suddenly to remember an important engagement somewhere over
in the next county. For this reason shooting guides build their
blinds well in advance in the open season.
Do not these facts suggest that our Surface-feeders are more
clever in looking after themselves than the Divers ?
As Mr. Yealland remarked the most stupid as well as the ugliest
of Ducks are the Scoters, a statement with which no one over here
will disagree. Years ago, before the practice was prohibited by law,

Sunday and holiday saw crowds of men and boys sallying forth
from the harbours along our north and middle Atlantic coasts to
indulge in an alleged sport known as u line shooting 55 , in which
Scoters were the victims. A couple of tugs would be hired, each
of which would tow a dozen or more skiffs to the shooting grounds.
Here the skiffs would be anchored, about two gun-shots apart,
in a long line. A couple of dozen crude decoys, often no more than
blocks of wood painted black, would be set out close to each skiff.
The tugs, one on either side of the line and a mile or two away,
then would harry the hapless Scoters back and forth throughout
the day to the accompaniment of a thunderous bombardment
from the skiffs.
Scoters do not like to fly either high or far and when driven
towards the line by the tugs and lulled into a feeling of security
by the decoys, they usually would fly straight to the nearest skiff.
When fired on, instead of rising high in the air and leaving forth-
with for distant parts, the poor, stupid Scoters merely would turn
and fly along parallel to the line to be shot at by the occupants
of skiff after skiff. In this way enormous numbers of Scoters were
slaughtered. Most of them would be allowed to drift off with the
tide, the rank and fishy flavour of the flesh making them anything
but desirable on the table.
Although " line shooting 55 no longer is permitted Scoters as
well as the equally unpalatable but very beautiful Long-tailed&amp;apos;
Duck (always, because of its garrulity, the " Old-Squaw 55 to ah
American) are still classed as game birds under our laws. That
the shooting of either, or of Carolinas, is permitted would appear
to be a black mark against our otherwise excellent provisions for
the proper protection and perpetuation of wild life. Neither Scoter
nor Long-tailed is fit to eat, while the Carolina, in addition to
being one of the two most beautiful Ducks in existence, always
has been a comparatively rare species for the very good reason
that it will nest nowhere save in a hollow tree, with suitable nesting-
trees becoming constantly scarcer there is more reason to-day for
the complete protection of the species than ever.
Some twenty years ago when Carolinas appeared threatened
with extermination they were placed on the fully protected list.
Thanks to this immunity they increased in certain sections to such
an extent that shooters demanded an open season and the present

regulation was enacted. This would not be so bad if the provision
limiting the shooter to a single bird in a day's shoot could be
enforced. But manifestly this is impossible, however good the
intentions of the gunner may be. A shot-gun cartridge carries two
or three hundred pellets. When such a load is fired, even though
the shooter may have taken most careful aim at a particular bird
in a flock several of its fellows are apt to be brought down. Thus
it would seem that unless Carolinas are shortly restored to the
protected list it will not be long before what it took twenty years
to build up will have been destroyed. However, this is a matter
which concerns our own intelligence rather than that of the Ducks.
By all odds the most intelligent of North American waterfowl
of any species whatsoever is the Black Duck of the Eastern States.
A surface-feeding Duck of large size, sometimes weighing in excess
of 4 lb., it is not a decorative species because of the sombreness of
its plumage which, while not black, is a dark mottled brown.
However, because of the skill required to bag it as well as because
of the unsurpassed excellence of its flesh I should think it would
make a most valuable addition to the list of sporting birds of the
British Isles, many sections of which are ideally suited to its require-
ments and where it doubtless would stay, for it is not a true migrant.
In spite of the fact that it lives in the most populous part of
the country the Black Duck, thanks to its superlative intelligence,
has more nearly held its own than any other of our waterfowl
species. It long since discovered that the price of continued existence
was a complete change of its natural habits. As a result it is nowa-
days but rarely seen by daylight except far out on open waters.
Here it rests in security until with the coming of night it repairs
to the marshes where it feeds.
To secure a bag of Black Ducks the gunner must be an excellent
shot, have perfect equipment in the matter of blind and decoys,
and finally the weather must be his ally. His opportunity comes
when heavy winds render open waters uncomfortable and force
the Ducks to come inshore by day. Although not particularly fast
flying Black Ducks travel in straggling rather than in compact
array so that to bag more than a single bird a shot is rare. Further-
more, when alarmed, as when the gunner rises in his blind to shoot,
the Black Duck has the uncanny ability to rise almost straight up
with amazing rapidity, thus presenting a most difficult shot.

So skilful is the Black Duck at keeping its whereabouts a secret
that it frequently exists in places where its presence is not even
suspected. It is even to be found living and rearing its young
within the limits of great cities, as New York. This may not strike
an Englishman as so very extraordinary, but it should be remembered
that our shooting conditions are very different to those in England.
Here any citizen may shoot on payment of a small licence fee,
and an army of more than five million gunners annually takes the
field. The majority of these are equipped with guns which shoot
hard and straight, though lacking in the nicety of balance and
extremely light weight of fine hand-made English pieces.
Under the circumstances it is extraordinary that there is any-
thing left in the country to shoot. Nor would there be but for the
increasing general improvement of the game laws, and their
enforcement, and the really splendid work being carried on in the
propagation and liberation of game. Almost every state in the
Union maintains one or more large game farms where great
numbers of Quail, Pheasants, and Partridges, including many
Chukors, are annually bred and released. There are also thousands
of private game farms, some maintained by individuals for the
stocking of preserves, others by shooting clubs, and still others
which are on a commercial basis and which sell most of their
product to the states. In addition to the species mentioned these
private farms also breed Mallard and Black Ducks and Rabbits.
The establishment of frequent refuges, both publicly and privately
owned, where wild life may find sanctuary, has also proved of
great benefit.
But I am afraid I have strayed away from what I set out to
discuss. In a final analysis of the intelligence of North American
Ducks it may be said that the Surface-feeders in general possess
so much more of this very valuable commodity than the Divers
that many of them will still be with us in numbers long after most
of the Divers have become scarce. And should that dark day ever
come when we have left in the wild but a single species, the lone
survivor, without question, will be none other than my old and
highly respected friend, the surface-feeding Black Duck. Of this
you may rest as thoroughly assured as you are of the ultimate
defeat of Hitler, than which nothing could be more certain.

Of the four species of Snow Geese, three are pure white in
colour except for the primary wing feathers and their coverts,
which are black and bluish-grey respectively. When the wings
are closed, this dark colouring does not show ; the protruding black
wing tips sticking out from the white plumage being then the
only colour in evidence.
The three larger species are sturdily built and about equal in
size to any of the larger British Grey Geese. Their habits and
requirements in captivity are very similar to that group. On the
whole, however, they appear to be slightly coarser grazers, and
during deep snow will devour the tops of sedge, rushes, etc.
Structurally, they resemble the grey geese and differ chiefly by
their somewhat thicker bills which have a conspicuous black line,
visible from the outside extending along the cutting edges of the
mandibles. The group also differs from the Ansers in having the
tertiary wing coverts more lanceolate and drooping.
Greater Snow Goose (Chen hyperborea atlantica ).--I have but
once kept an example of this large Snow Goose, but from a personal
acquaintance of that and from an examination of others at fairly
close range, I can quite believe that it is but a large and heavily
billed edition of the next species. As a wild bird its numbers are
said to be confined to one huge flock of several thousand, and its
winter quarters to be restricted to the Atlantic coast. Isolated pairs
have been found breeding on the east coast of Greenland, otherwise
its breeding ground is unknown.
In confinement the only knowledge I have of its importation
within recent years has been the several examples procured by
Messrs. P. Scott and D. Haig-Thomas. *
Lesser Snow Goose (Chen hyperborea hyperborea ).--In a state of
nature the present species is the most abundant and widely dis-
tributed of the genus Chen. Its range I understand extends over
the greater part of North America, etc., and its breeding ground
includes Alaska. As a wild bird it has also on a few occasions
occurred within the British Isles, notably in Ireland. In confine-
ment it may frequently be seen in the best collections of waterfowl.

It is a handsome and conspicuous bird which in the distance might
easily be mistaken for a domestic goose. A closer examination,
however, reveals the pinkish red legs, pink bill, and black wing-
tips.
Like other Snow Geese, does very well in this country, and
breeds under suitable conditions.
Blue Snow Goose (Chen caerulescens ).--A particularly interesting
bird, which except for its slaty-brown plumage appears identical
with the Lesser Snow Goose.
As wild birds they winter in Texas, and the breeding ground of
the species, which has only comparatively recently been discovered,
is in Baffin Bay.
In confinement they nest fairly readily, provided they have
suitable ground. At Lilford they usually choose nesting sites
similar to the one shown in the accompanying photograph.
Should these not be available, they nest upon short bare turf..
During incubation, which lasts twenty-six days, the male very
jealously guards the female at the nest, so jealously indeed, that
having a very powerful bite, he is capable of injuring other birds.
The young on leaving the nest are olive-black in colour, with lighter
head and upper hind neck. They rear quite easily when running
with their parents.

to keep, and are undoubtedly one of the most attractive of the
smaller geese. In size they only slightly exceed the Common Brent,
and are considerably smaller and more daintily built than the other
Snow Geese. Their bills also are shorter and somewhat different.
They further differ by frequently having a few small warty pro-
tuberances at the base of the bill, a peculiarity I understand which
amongst American sportsmen has earned for them the name of
Warty-nosed Wavy Goose. In a wild state the present species
occurs in Alaska, etc., but has never been so abundant as its
relative the Lesser Snow Goose. Its breeding grounds, I under-
stand, have yet to be discovered, and on the whole it is by no means
a common species. In confinement there is just a sprinkling of
them. They do well, provided they have access to pure water and
good grazing. They also nest fairly readily in confinement, a
circumstance which taking into consideration the very few wild

Ross's which have been imported, and the fact that hundreds of
Brent must at one time and another have been kept without
producing an egg, speaks well for this Arctic species. My own
experience of the breeding of Ross's Snow Goose owing to the
accidental breaking of pairs and a difficulty in renewing the right
sexes, has been confined to recent years when a pair or odd females
have regularly nested at Lilford. The nests have usually been
made upon an island, and sometimes near the foot of a tree. Five
eggs appear to constitute a clutch, the first egg of which is usually
laid early in May. These are dull, almost putty white in colour,
rough in texture, and measure about 2Sin. by 2 in. As incubation,
which lasts twenty-four days, commences the eggs are abundantly
covered with white down. To the best of my recollection the chicks
on leaving the nest are beautiful little creatures, with pale grey
backs and primrose-coloured heads. They rear satisfactorily with
the parents when running upon a lawn. I have found them very
partial to coarse oatmeal (pin head), which they quickly learn to
take from a clean board. The young when in their first feather
show a considerable amount of grey on the upper parts.
The legs and feet of the adults is pinkish or purplish-red. The
bill pink. Grey at the sides of basal half.

The less common subspecies or races of the Canada Goose
do not seem to have been bred at all extensively in European
collections of waterfowl. In recent years J. C. Laidlay has success-
fully reared several of these birds, notably Hutchin's and the
Cackling Goose. It was, therefore, with much interest but no
great surprise that in July, 1941, I saw on his lawn a brood of
half-grown geese, apparently of the Canada group.
One respect in which these young geese seemed to me unusual
was that the black of the neck extended down on to the body,
instead of terminating abruptly at the base of the neck itself.
Subsequently, when examining the birds in the hand, I noted
that the fore-wing was a paler grey than I had seen in any race of
Canada Goose. In other characters the geese seemed to be typical
members of the Canada group, yet in fact they had no Canada
blood in their veins ; their father was a wild-caught Barnacle and
their mother a Scottish Greylag.
When, most regrettably, Laidlay decided to give up his fine
collection of waterfowl at Lindores, he kindly gave me the parents
and two of the young brood ; the others, being full-winged, evaded
capture. One of the two hybrids, from its robust build and
pugnacious disposition, would seem to be a male ; the other is
smaller with a more slender bill and lower-pitched voice, and may
be a female. When they came from Lindores on the 20th September,
1941, the measurements of the parents and of the two young, then
four months old, were as follows :--

It is probable that the appearance of the hybrids will have
altered considerably by the time they attain full maturity. Now,
however, at the age of almost a year, they bear quite as striking
a resemblance to Canada Geese as they did when first I saw them.

The white cheek patches meeting on the throat, the brown body-
plumage, black neck, tail, legs, and bill are all typical characters
of the Canada, and when the neck is held erect, one may fail to
notice that the black extends on to the body as in the Barnacle,
although to a less degree. At close quarters one can detect that the
bills, apart from the nails, are becoming grey rather than black,
and it is therefore probable that ultimately the bills may become
more or less coloured, as perhaps the legs and feet may also.
These are not the first Barnacle X Greylag hybrids which
I have seen. Nine years ago Colonel F. G. G. Bailey showed me
an example of this cross which he had at Lake. It was quite unlike
the Lindores hybrids and a photograph which I took at the time
suggests a dingy immature Barnacle. But inter-generic Goose
hybrids do not seem to be constant in appearance, since the precise
characters of the offspring are influenced by the genetic idio-
syncrasies of the individual parents. I had hoped that the Lindores
Barnacle and Greylag parents would have produced more broods
of hybrids, which I should have expected to resemble the original
family of " pseudo-Canadas ". Unfortunately, however, the
Greylag mother died during the winter, so that this opportunity
of gaining further data on the point has been lost.
I am reminded that my first encounter with an intergeneric
Anser hybrid occurred many years ago. So far as I can recollect,
the bird was characterized by orange legs and a massive orange-
yellow bill with a large black nail and a black patch on the culmen.
The plumage was of nondescript grey-goose type, and since the
district was frequented by a wild flock of Bean Geese I assumed
that this Goose was a rare and perhaps undescribed race of that
species. Further investigation revealed that it was in fact only an
accidental farmyard cross between a Greylag gander and a Chinese
Goose, Cygnopsis cygnoides.
Frequently Barnacle Geese have been observed consorting with
Pinkfooted, and in some parts of the Arctic both species breed in
the same districts. It is possible, therefore, that occasionally natural
hybrids may occur, some of which may bear an even closer
resemblance to Canada Geese than do the Lindores hybrids.
Even were this established it would not suggest that the Canada
Geese originated in hybridization between a Grey Goose and a
Black Goose of Barnacle type, although something of the sort is

not impossible. Obviously it would be of great interest if the two
Lindores hybrids could be induced to mate and produce offspring
resembling themselves. But even should it prove that such crosses
are inter-sterile, the mere fact that they can resemble Canada
Geese so closely may prove of interest in considering the evolution
and taxonomy of the Grey, Black, and Canada Geese.
Unfortunately, confusion still obtains concerning the systematics
and nomenclature of many forms of Wild Geese. In my opinion,
the reason for this is that the Wild Geese in general seem to con-
stitute one of those interesting biological groups in regard to which
the normal species-concept breaks down, as it does in regard to
Man himself. Writing in his excellent volume on The New Systematics ,
Huxley (1940), pointed out that Man " . . . exhibits a peculiar
form of reticulate descent consequent upon extreme migration ".
In several anserine forms, of which Geese of the type Anser fabatis
are perhaps the best example, there is indication that isolations of
breeding ranges, followed by expansions with consequent over-
lapping, have resulted in a variable degree of racial intercrossing.
I11 a few cases aviculturists have already succeeded in showing
experimentally that such hybridization can take place without
noticeable loss of viability ; but little seems to have been recorded
as to the fertility of the crosses, either inter se or with a parent race.
Where distinct forms or races overlap and intercross, a zone
of intergradation is produced. With Geese, these overlapping
breeding grounds may lie in remote and unexplored wilds. Possibly,
therefore, it is the variable intermediate birds from such areas which
so often puzzle the naturalist-wildfowler observing them in their
winter quarters, where he may have no clue as to their true identity.
In order to describe the character-gradients between distinct
forms, Huxley (loc. cit.) has proposed use of the term " cline ".
The number and extent of the dines to be found in a study of the
Wild Geese may make these birds somewhat irritating to a tidy-
minded taxonomist. But the same factor should make them of
particular interest to the aviculturist. The breeding of the scarcer
races even of such common types as the Bean Goose and the
Canada Goose is specially to be commended. Observations on the
rearing of such birds in captivity, when collated with the notes and
skins collected by arctic explorers, can be of great assistance to those
studying systematics and distribution. While this aspect of controlled

propagation is widely appreciated, many breeders of Wild Geese
still regard hybrids as undesirable accidents. Yet the description
and measurements of a new form of hybrid may prove of even
greater interest than the record of a distinct species having nested
in captivity for the first time.
The fact that hybrids between a Barnacle and a Greylag can
bear a striking resemblance to a Canada Goose may be of definite
taxonomic significance, or it may be a fortuitous coincidence of no
more than casual interest ; a decision on that point must be left
to the specialists in such matters. The main thing would seem to
be to ensure that the fact itself does not pass unnoticed.

The New Zealand Shoveler ( Spatula rhynchotis )
Buller, the great New Zealand ornithologist of the last century,
described the Shoveler from New Zealand as being distinct from
the one found in Australia, but ornithologists of to-day do not
distinguish between the two. I am not really in a position to dispute
this as I have not seen the Australian bird in the flesh. I had several
offered to me whilst in Australia but the authorities refused me
a permit to take them away alive.
I do think that the New Zealand bird is much brighter coloured
than the Australian one, judging by skins and coloured plates.
Some years ago now I managed to get hold of four of these
birds, their origin was rather obscure, but I was given to understand
that they were reared on a farm from eggs taken from a nest.
When I received them I must confess, being so busy and having
so many birds on my hands at the time, that I did not recognize
them for what they were. They were only half grown and in
immature plumage, and not very interesting to look at, and I did
not even realize that they were Shovelers at all until I got them
home.
I had a very long voyage of about eight weeks and I found the

Ducks rather a trial, for every day I had to give them a swim in
a large meat tin borrowed from the cook. This was perhaps a
mistake on my part, for the birds, as they lost their natural oil
whilst under the very unnatural conditions, found it hard to dry
themselves and one became so water logged that it died. However,
I landed three and the " Zoo 55 kindly had them for a time for me,
and though they were full-winged they never attempted to fly
away. After I had them back one of the birds assumed the plumage
of the drake and I found I had two females and one male. The
cock was a strikingly handsome little bird and very different from
the European bird, much darker, very little white about the body
and much more blue. I have seen it stated that no Ducks in the
Southern Hemisphere have an eclipse plumage, but this one
certainly did, and so has the New Zealand Brown Duck (. Elas -
monetta chlorotis ), but to a less extent.
They were quiet unobstrusive little birds and fed to a large
extent on " soft-food " thrown on the surface of the water. They
dabbled continuously on the surface, sifting the fine food through
the comb-like lamellae of their bills.
Such surface-feeding Ducks as the Shovelers must do an
immense amount of good in feeding on the minute larvae of such
obnoxious insects as mosquitos, etc. ; but alas, no Duck ever gets
any credit for any good that it may do ; to the average person its
edible qualities are of the foremost importance.
As my birds had not much chance to breed with me I let
M. Delacour have them. He bred them for several years, I believe,
but found the youngsters very delicate and difficult to rear. I suppose
they were still at Cleres when it had to be abandoned. It is a
horrible thought that my little birds may have made a meal for
some gluttonous Nazi !
This Shoveler is not very common in New Zealand and is
consequently not very well known.
The published notes concerning this and the Australian bird
are very meagre. One writer states that they have an extraordinary
sense of smell !. The same writer stating that they dive a lot for
their food ; a thing I never found them do. No doubt in their
habits they resemble other Shovelers, living in swampy districts
and finding their sustenance on the surface of the water, sifting
small aquatic life through their shovel-like bills.

S. PORTER-THE DUCKS OF NEW ZEALAND
The Paradise Sheld-duck (Cas arc a variegata )
Very few New Zealand birds flourish outside their own country,
why I don't know, but this one is the exception and it is quite well
known with most ornamental waterfowl keepers. One must have
a very large place if one wants to keep this Duck successfully with
others, for it is certainly the most pugnacious creature I have ever
come across and terribly noisy into the bargain ; I had to get rid
of my birds for that reason. The slightest sound of a footstep and
they set up the most awful row which lasted for about an hour.
The male was a real brute, he used to catch hold of my trousers in
his beak and thresh my legs with the hard knobs on his wings
until round about my knees was a mass of bruises. He treated
my aviary attendant in the same way, and I think he would have
left had I not got rid of the birds. There are few birds I have
parted with with less regret than these. I gave them to a public park
in the town which had a large lake, but they soon wandered away
and were shot.
Once found in vast numbers in New Zealand this bird has,
through constant slaughter, been greatly reduced, though it is still
far from uncommon. I saw a good many on the fast flowing and
ice-cold glacial rivers in the Mount Cook region and very lovely
they looked when flying in the sunshine, their varied plumage
showing up to great advantage against the sombre grey rocks of
the mountains. They well deserved their name then, but otherwise
I think they are the least attractive of the Sheld-ducks, our own
bird being far more beautiful. Sheld-ducks are not birds for the
aviculturists with a very limited amount of water like myself,
for they treat all other Ducks abominably. In temperament and
habits generally they come much nearer the Geese than the Ducks.
Only Geese have such wicked dispositions as the Sheld-ducks.
In fact I agree with M. Delacour that Sheld-ducks are more Geese
than Ducks. They are all great grazers like Geese and both sexes
incubate.
The sexes of the Paradise Sheld-duck are extraordinarily
different, the female, though smaller than her mate, is the brighter
in colour, she also has a partial " eclipse ".

S. PORTER-THE DUCKS OF NEW ZEALAND
The Blue or Mountain Duck (Hymenolaimus malacorhynchus)
This strange Duck is the very antithesis to the last mentioned,
very retiring, it is found only in far away secluded mountain
torrents and is seldom seen except by the diligent naturalist or
wandering woodsman. Though I went into the haunts where this
bird is found on the high wooded slopes of Mount Tongariro
I failed to see it, though I did find some of its feathers by the fast
flowing mountain torrents. It shares with the Dipper the ability
to forage at the bottoms of the swiftest flowing mountain streams,
where it searches amongst the pebbles for Crustacea and aquatic
larvae, especially caddis-fly grubs. The bird is helped in its search
for food by the remarkable bill, which described scientifically
" has the apical half of the upper mandible composed of a soft
flexible skin that hangs over the lower mandible In other words
there is a flap of skin hanging over the tip of the bill which no
doubt prevents the food being swept away by the fast flowing water.
Unfortunately this bird is now very rare and on the danger list.
Once it was found right down into the flat country, but being tame
and very unsuspecting it was soon eliminated by the settlers until
now it is only found in the most remote districts. The Maoris were
very fond of its flesh and they still trap it whenever they can. In
fact they are its chief enemy now.
Very few specimens have ever been kept in captivity. I was
fortunate in seeing a single bird in a friend's aviaries. It was
exceedingly tame and liked to be made a fuss of, but in handling it
I found it was very thin and in poor condition. It is a difficult
*bird to cater for and does not do well in close conditions. The
owner stated that it used to eat flying insects which settled on the
ground such as beetles, etc. It is purely insectivorous and wants
fast running pure water to thrive on, which I am afraid few
aviculturists could provide.
Besides the aforementioned Ducks certain Australian species
have been recorded in New Zealand, namely Eyton's Tree Duck
(Dendrocygna eytoni), the Grey Teal ( Anas gibberifrons) , and the
White-eyed Duck ( Nyroca australis), but these are only stragglers.

By Clarence L. Sibley
In America there has never been the widespread interest in
waterfowl that gave Europe such fine collections as the one at
Cleres, Dr. Derscheid's in Belgium, Mr. Blaauw's in Holland,
those of Mr. Alfred Ezra, the Messrs. Stevens, Major Pam, Mr. Alan
Ramp ton, the Duke of Bedford, Mr. Spedan Lewis, and many
others in England. Probably the best (chiefly Ducks, with only a
few of the smaller Geese, and a pair or two of the smaller Swans)
was that of the late J. L. de Laveaga, of San Mateo, California.
His collection of Ducks was really. quite complete and he was most
successful in breeding many of the rare sorts. Zoological parks
have been notably lacking in good waterfowl collections. Now that
Mr. Jean Delacour is technical advisor to the New York Zoological
Society we may confidently expect that the waterfowl collections
there will improve greatly. Already there is a noticeable improve-
ment during his short tenure of office.
One reason is that experienced keepers are not to be had, and
with the war conditions are much worse. My own curator, who
was intelligent and had become valuable after five years of training
is, like so many others, in our armed forces, as is also his helper,
a lad who was learning rapidly and might under ordinary circum-
stances have been able to take the curator's place. In America
about all that we can hope to do now is to carry along with the
stock we had, increase as much as possible the more valuable
species, and hope that we may not be too severely rationed on
necessary foodstuffs. One bad feature is that in America we have
not the numbers of birds in some of the rarer sorts to draw on for
new breeding stock when death or accident has occurred. Thus
some kinds (even comparatively common sorts such as Falcated
Ducks, Red-crested Pochards, etc.), will be represented only by
single birds or several birds of the same sex. As an example only
one pair of Falcated Ducks bred for us last season, and with
dependence on inadequate assistants only three young were reared,
and all were males. During the winter an invasion of Goshawks
took place because of the severity of winter in the Arctic, and of
the birds taken three were Falcated females, one the female which
nested in 1941, the other two young females which would presumably

have nested this present season. Now we have only males in this
species, and no one else in America has a surplus female to offer.
This is cited merely to show how easily one may have his breeding
stock of a species impaired to the point of no longer being able to
continue its breeding. Also it illustrates the fact that it need not
be an unusually rare species. The Falcated Duck has always been
considered moderately abundant in collections, yet here we are
needing a female without being able to obtain one.
Until the war it was quite an easy matter to obtain South
American waterfowl. And strangely enough most of the South
American species seem willing to breed in this country, as witness
the ease with which such Ducks as Rosybills, Versicolor, Brazilian,
Chilian, Sharp-winged, Ringed, and other Teal breed soon after
being imported. South American Geese such as the Upland,
Ashy-headed, Ruddy-headed, Andean, etc., have all been ready
to breed soon after coming into the country. Now with the menace
of enemy submarines the greatly increased costs of ocean freight
and maritime insurance, plus the fact that many bird collectors
are in the armed forces of one or another country, importations of
waterfowl from South America have practically ceased, and we in
America must do our best to hold our present stocks of South
American species, as well as those from other parts of the world.
Last season (1941), because of unskilled help and my own
necessary absence on defence business during the spring season,
we had little to enthuse about in rare waterfowl. Of course, as usual,
the commoner sorts nested beautifully and the young managed, in
spite of incompetent care, to reach maturity as rugged, strong
specimens. The rarer sorts, as if they were aware of their rarity,
either gave us infertile eggs, or else the young persisted in taking
their indifferent care during chickhood too much to heart, and
did not survive. One pair of Red-breasted Geese (which species
has not, to date, been bred in this country) laid four eggs, and hopes
were high, until we found that the eggs were not fertile. With
that optimism which every aviculturist must have if he is to remain
one, we look forward to the present season, with the hope that
Mr. and Mrs. Red-breast will this season give us fertile and
hatchable eggs. Lesser White-fronted Geese nested with seven
fertile eggs. However, due to inexperienced help, the eggs were
left to the Goose to incubate, and she promptly got into an argument

with a Sheld-duck, and in the ensuing scramble only two eggs were
saved. These both hatched, but only one, a male, was reared.
Ross Geese, with which we are usually successful, proved as hardy
as oaks, and the young were safely reared. A pair of Emperor
Geese hatched four fine babies and reared them to about ten days
of age when a sudden rainstorm flooded their field, washed out
a dividing fence, and gave the babies access to a field of unmown
hay, in which were some rose beetles which they promptly devoured.
Rose beetles are sure death to young waterfowl so they all four
promptly turned up their little toes to Heaven.
Black-necked Swans insisted on laying their eggs so early in
the season the eggs were chilled and failed to hatch. Black Swans,
as always, were prolific and the young were raised safely, as were
those of Mutes and Whoopers. A pair, consisting of a Whistling
Swan male and a Bewick's female of the " jankowski " sub-species,
nested and hatched four fine sturdy young. At the moment we
had no hens available to take them as we usually do with cygnets
so they were left with the mother. After five days of great care
and solicitude she suddenly went berserk and killed them all.
This season (if we are so fortunate as to again have cygnets from
this unusual pair) the young will be given to a motherly hen or put
into a brooder for rearing. One is naturally curious to see what
the mature hybrids will be like. Our pairs of Whistling Swans did
not nest, nor did the Goscorobas, of which we had only one very
well-mated pair. Later in the season, suddenly, and with no
apparent reason, the Goscorobas got what appeared to be
tuberculosis and withered away.
Of the Sheld-ducks the following nested : South African, Ruddy,
Common, Paradise, and Australian. We reared young of the
South African, Ruddy, Common, and Paradise. The Australians
nested in mid-winter and the eggs, except one, were not discovered
in time to prevent freezing and cracking. The one egg, the last
laid, proved infertile. Why is it that Sheld-ducks seem so much more
ready to nest than do some other sorts ? Also they seem very ready
to hybridize. We have during the last two seasons produced some
fairly attractive hybrids from an Abyssinian Blue-winged male and
an Egyptian female, and this season have a Blue-winged male
which has mated with one of the hybrid females. It will be interesting
to see if the hybrid female can producp fertile eggs. All manner

of mesalliances seem to be indulged in by the Sheld-duck family :
Ruddy X Egyptian Goose ; South African X Ruddy ; Ruddy X
Radjah, etc., etc. We even have a South African male which became
enamoured of the male of a pair of well-mated breeding Ruddies,
and before we knew it had effectively divorced the Ruddy female
and taken unto himself the Ruddy male. Both males seem to feel
that the arrangement is most satisfactory !
Subsequent to the nesting season we had a visit from Mr. Terry
Jones and a shipmate when their ship was in an American port
undergoing repairs. At that time about the only interesting nestings
were those of a couple of pairs of Stanley Cranes, and our one and
only pair of Grey-necked Crowned Cranes, from Major Pam,
which have nested during each of the three last seasons. Mr. Jones
was much interested in some young White-cheeked Geese whose
legs, when immature, are unlike most of the species of Branta,
light in colour, darkening later to the adult black. With most
goslings the feet are dark, and later assume the adult yellow or
red or other colour.
Ducks were nothing to rave about. Of the Tree Ducks only
the following nested : White-faced, Black-billed, Black-bellied,
and Arcuata. Of the somewhat rarer species we reared some
American Ruddy Ducks and two solitary Common Goldeneyes.
We have found that it is quite an easy matter to feed too much
meat to some of the Ducks : Goldeneyes, Ruddy Ducks, Buffle-
heads, Eiders, etc., and they suffer from digestive disturbances
and fail to nest. For such species best results have been gotten by
putting them into a large pond with plenty of natural food, prior to
the breeding season. They then produce fertile and hatchable eggs.
In concluding this extremely rambling and disjointed article
may I pay tribute to the tenacity and courage of those who are
responsible for issuing the Avicultural Magazine. It has reached
us without fail all during the war and is a reminder of the pleasant
friendships we have made " across the pond ". The writer hopes
that in spite of difficulties we aviculturists will be able to carry
on our hobbies with success until the end of the war, and again
meet at our International Ornithological Congress to renew friend-
ships and exchange ideas and opinions as in the halcyon days
before the exponents of Might attempted to impose their wills
upon those of us who believe in Right.

At 168 East 63rd Street, in a district of New York comparable
to the Mayfair of London, I sit at my desk to write on Tree Ducks
for the Avicultural Magazine. How many times before have
I sat down to write for the Avicultural Magazine ? I started
more than 25 years ago at Villers-Bretonneux, and I have done it
again and again, on innumerable occasions, mostly at Geres, and
sometimes also at some dear friend's house : Brinsop, Foxwarren,
or Wormley. . . . To-day is Easter Sunday, a mild sunny day, and
it is late in the afternoon. New York is just as nice a city to live
in as Paris or London. But I always disliked cities. I look through
my window and I see a row of small houses, not at all offensive,
but just indifferent and disparate. A town street has always looked
unlovely to me. When still a small boy I had loudly announced
that I wanted always to live in the country, in the middle of a
large park, where nothing ugly could offend one's view as far as
one could see. It then seemed to be reasonable enough a wish
and I have long pretty well succeeded in fulfilling it. But when
my world goes to ruin it all seems so remote and fantastic ! What
now calls back to my memory the regret of a lost paradise is the
sudden vision of Tree Ducks. Had I been sitting at my desk at
Geres, in King Henry IV's room, only a very few years ago on
the late afternoon of an Easter Sunday I should undoubtedly have
seen through the large mullioned windows dozens of Tree Ducks
on the wing, calling shrilly high in the sky on their evening flight.
Where are my flocks of full-winged Tree Ducks now, and all the
countless bird treasures accumulated at Geres, and further back
in the years, at Villers ? Gone with the wind ... I fear that in
this present dreary world, at least in our lifetime, there will be no
opportunities for the restoration and the continuation of such
activities as the keeping of large private collections. We shall have
to be content with the care of public ones, and I feel fortunate
in. having been given the charge of those of the New York Zoological
Park. From my new office at the Bronx I see only wild woods and
water, and this is some consolation. . . .

But to come back to the Tree Ducks. Among waterfowl Tree
Ducks are almost as distinct from all other groups as are the very
aberrant Flamingoes and Screamers. They differ widely from
other Ducks, Geese, and Swans in their short, rounded body and
wings. In flight they look much more like Ibises than anything
else, with their long neck and broad wings. Their legs are high
and their feet comparatively very large ; they walk with the
greatest ease and grace. They have also different structural
peculiarities, and furthermore their voice, which is often shrill
and whistling. Their habits and courtship differ strikingly from
those of the other Anatidte. The downy chicks, always so indicative
of real relationships, are very peculiar in Dendrocygna , being small,
extremely short of body, long of neck, high on the legs, and having
characteristic markings, in particular a transversal light band on
the nape, which is found in no other ducklings. Tree Ducks are
mostly tropical--some partly migrating north to breed ( javanica in
Eastern Asia, fulva in North America). Their distribution is quite
remarkable, and even unparalleled in birds, as one species, fulva,
is found altogether in North and South America, Africa, India,
and another one, viduata , in South America and in Africa. The
others are distributed as follows : javanica, India to Eastern Asia ;
arcuata , Malaysia to Australia ; arborea , West Indies ; guttulata,
New Guinea ; eytoni , Australia ; autumnalis, Central America, and
its subspecies discolor , South America.
All Tree Ducks look charming. They have varied but always
handsome plumages. They are elegant in shape, extremely attractive
in their behaviour, and often become absurdly tame. Pairs have
an amusing way of showing their affection in preening one another's
head with their bills. Their young are among the prettiest chicks
one may see ; although they differ widely in colour according
to the species, they all show a similar and characteristic pattern.
All Tree Ducks are abundant in the wild state. Even the more
local species such as the Spotted (guttulata), Eyton's (eytoni), and
the Black-billed (arborea) are common in their restricted areas.
I have had numerous opportunities to observe numbers of them
in their natural surroundings. I remember seeing immense flocks
of Red-billed Grey-breasted Tree Ducks around pools in the
llanos of Venezuela and in Brazil, where also White-faced were
common. The same White-faced abound in Madagascar, where

<bodyText confidence="0.997538333333334" page_id="56350536"  page_num="96" year="" vol="">
Fulvous are also numerous, and on the Niger, in the Sudan. In
India and Indo-China large parties of the Lesser Whistling " Teal "
(javanica) are common in many places, and the Calcutta, Singapore,
and Saigon markets used to be full of them.
Both sexes are similar and they are difficult to differentiate.
There is no difference noticeable in the habits and behaviour of
wild Tree Ducks and of those kept full-winged in a park, and this
is particularly striking with the charming White-faced, whose
natural tameness and chirping voice are always so delightful,
wherever they are found. The American Red-billed evidently
comes a very close second in attractiveness, followed by the beautiful
Australian Eyton's, the handsomest of all with its lovely elongated
flank-feathers. All the others, shorter-tailed Tree Ducks, although
beautiful, are less graceful in shape and ways.
With the exception of the rarer Eyton's and Spotted, Tree Ducks
used to be freely imported and easily obtainable. They also breed
readily in captivity if suitable grounds are given to them. They
have the great advantage of staying well if allowed to use their
wings. They are, however, sometimes quarrelsome among themselves
in the breeding season, but not dangerously so in most cases.
Their only drawback in cold climates is their comparative tenderness.
At Cleres they always remained out in the park, but it is better
to confine them in a shelter when the temperature drops below
15 degrees, for otherwise their feet may be frozen.
Tree Ducks nest among reeds and other water plants, which
they bind to make a rather elaborate nest, somewhat like a Moor-
hen's. It is not lined with down as those of other Ducks. At Cleres
we had every year broods of White-faced ( viduata ), Red-billed
{autumnalis ), Black-billed ( arborea ), and Fulvous ( fulva ). The
others never nested. When hatched at liberty the parents very
seldom managed to rear their broods, and we used, as much as
possible, to catch the whole family and to place them, father, mother,
and babies, into a rat-proof pen, with plenty of water and good food.
It usually worked very well on account of the tameness of the birds.
The male looks after his young just as carefully as the female.
Often a full-winged father would join his captive family of his
own accord. I kept at Cleres all the different Tree Ducks, usually
fifteen to twenty specimens of each species, mostly full-winged.
Only once, during a very cold winter, some Fulvous and Red-bills

went away, probably in search of more open water. The larger
species, White-faced, Fulvous, Red-billed, Black-billed, and Eyton's
did perfectly well on the lake. But the weaker javanica and arcuala
sometimes met with accidents, either attacked by vermin or
persecuted by the stronger birds. They did better on smaller ponds
in the company of different Teal. As to the Spotted Tree Duck
(guttulata) from New Guinea, so rare in captivity that my six
specimens were the first and only ones ever imported to my know-
ledge, they lived in the complete security of one of the larger duck
aviaries.
To the contrary of what one might be inclined to think, Tree
Ducks do not generally perch. They do sometimes stand on a large
branch, but not nearly so often as Mandarins or Muscovies, for
example, and they do not nest in tree holes.
The Tree Ducks of the genus Dendrocygna have only one close
relative : the large white bird usually called the Coscoroba Swan
(&amp;apos;Coscoroba coscoroba) of South America. In spite of its much larger
size, different colour, peculiar beak, and longer neck, this bird
retains the general shape and proportions of the Tree Ducks.
Their affinity had long been suggested by several authors, but
until recently I rather hesitated to adopt this view. Curiously
enough I never could find either a specimen or an accurate descrip-
tion of the downy chick which I knew would supply the key to
the mystery until after the death of the late F. E. Blaauw, the
well-known Dutch naturalist, I found, among his collections,
a Coscoroba chick, hatched at Gooilust many years before, which
had been preserved there. It was of a whitish grey, with very pale
but clearly visible markings, and the peculiar nape-band was
present. Since then I have had no more doubts, and I firmly
believe that Coscoroba is a well differentiated but true genus of the
subfamily Dendrocygnina , as none of the true Swan chicks shows
any markings.

98 J. YEALLAND-HAND-REARING FRESH-WATER DUCKLINGS
HAND-REARING FRESH-WATER DUCKLINGS
By John Yealland
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.998952111111111" page_id="56350538"  page_num="98" year="" vol="">
Despite the considerable amount of extra work, the knowledge
that one has almost full control over the welfare of the birds gives
to hand-rearing an added interest, while one is not dependent upon
parent birds whose stability is so often a matter of grim uncertainty.
Ducklings are excellent subjects to hand-rear, for they grow
quickly, are often fairly tame, and are at all stages pretty and full
of interest.
At Sterrebeek the system of rearing the Fresh-water ducklings
was rather similar to that employed for the Sea ducklings, few
bantams being used except for the actual incubation of the eggs.
Some eggs were incubated as for the eggs of domestic ducks,
entirely by incubator, and good results were obtained in this way.
All the actual hatching was done by incubator, the eggs being
taken from the bantams shortly before they were due to hatch :
in this way the hatching ducklings were saved from being crushed
or otherwise killed by the bantams, while the bantams, not having
been unsettled by having hatched something, were quite reliable
for incubating a second clutch.
The sitting bantams were accommodated in small cubicles of
brick, having an earthen floor covered with a piece of wire netting
as a precaution against rats, and a thick layer of peat moss on which
was made the actual nest.
By pouring a little tepid water on to the peat moss round the
nest from time to time the required degree of humidity was
maintained.
The Garolinas and Mandarins were, of course, among the first,
and, in the case of these, the rather long downy tails, said to act
as a kind of parachute when the ducklings are descending from the
nest, were clipped short because they were rather apt to drag in
the water and to collect duckweed.
Nearly all the ducklings were reared in brooders, having a lamp
underneath which provided the necessary and very steady tempera-
ture underneath the drum inside, while no fumes could enter.
The brooder floor was covered with a blanket which was, of course,
changed as often as necessary. For the first few days the ducklings
lived in a brooder having a wire-netting fronted run attached to it ;

<bodyText confidence="0.994648333333334" page_id="56350539"  page_num="99" year="" vol="">
the floor of the run was fitted with frames of wire gauze and at the
end was a large water dish.
Until the birds were well accustomed to the brooder and to
going underneath the drum, they were kept shut inside, but after
a few days they were allowed to go into the run and swimming
bath, and thereafter were fed entirely outside, having a small dish
of water inside only at night.
At first a little duckweed and fresh ants' eggs were put into a
small dish of water : the ducklings went into the water and by
their movements made the food move about and, being much
attracted by food which moves, were greatly encouraged to feed.
A few ants' eggs sprinkled on the backs of other ducklings were
also an attraction, and so by degrees a start was made. For the
more difficult ones mosquito larvae were also put into the water.
Then, by degrees, a proprietary food composed of biscuit-meal,
meat-meal, fish-meal, ants' eggs, dried flies, dried egg, and a little
crushed hemp, moistened and mixed with a few fresh ants' eggs
was given and the birds did well on this and duckweed. After
about ten days a little vermicelli was given twice daily ; at first
it was not easy to get the ducklings to eat this unaccustomed food,
but they soon learned to do so when ants' eggs were sprinkled on it.
Later the ducklings graduated from vermicelli to macaroni
given twice daily and eaten with great relish. The vermicelli, like
the macaroni, is boiled for a few minutes, and then plenty of cold
water is poured on it, for otherwise it becomes a glutinous mass.
No doubt this is a good food : the macaroni was a flat ribbon-like
product of yellowish colour and very cheap.
When duckweed, which is without doubt an extremely important
food, was scarce, the larger ducklings were given chopped chickweed
which floats long enough to be eaten, is well liked, and is perhaps
the best substitute. The ducklings were, of course, given grit, while
powdered cuttlefish bone, granulated charcoal, and occasionally a
few drops of cod-liver oil, were mixed with the food. The cuttle-
fish bone was put through a mincing machine, which, being a
fairly large one, ground it perfectly well, but a small machine
would probably not be strong enough.
The ducklings were fed every two hours, and were given no more
than they would finish within half an hour, so that they were
hungry by the time the next meal arrived. When they were

feathered they were given boiled wheat mixed with the other food,
and after a further week or so they received the normal adult diet
of soaked grain and duckweed.
The fresh ants' eggs were really fresh, and not those pathetic
dried specimens : I think they were collected from woods not far
distant from Brussels. I have not seen them collected, but I think
the unlucky ants are dug up, eggs and all, and laid on a cloth in
the sun, and folded pieces of cloth are laid round the outside. The
ants take the eggs into the shade between the folds of cloth and then
comes the incomprehensible part. It seems that having put all
the eggs in the shade, the ants tactfully withdraw--whatever
happens the " eggs " remain alive, and are very clean indeed,
having no dead ants or other rubbish mixed with them.
Naturally the Mallards and other ducklings very easily reared
did not require such delicacies beyond the first few days, but such
as the Carolinas, Mandarins, Shovelers, and some of the Teal
needed more nursing along. We did not use gentles even for Sea-
ducklings ; they are, no doubt, very good food, but it would have
been difficult and expensive to buy them in sufficient quantities,
while the breeding of enough for a large number of ducklings would
have been a formidable undertaking. Nor did the ducklings receive
any earthworms ; our sole venture with earthworms ended in
disaster, some Eiders and Goosanders becoming severely afflicted
by gape-worms through eating them. There were, however, no
cases of gapes among the Fresh-water ducklings. At about ten days
old the ducklings were moved to other brooders placed in large grass
pens, and having a large cement basin of water and some artificial
cover for shade against the hot sun. All, including the Sea-ducklings,
were pinioned within the first five days, but generally when they
were put into the brooder from the hatching incubator.
At this age the bird feels nothing, haemorrhage, if any, is the
merest speck, the risk of sepsis is very small indeed if the scissors
are sterilized and the cut painted with iodine, while the bird does
not suffer the least shock either from being handled or from the
operation. Embroidery scissors are perhaps the best ; it is very easy
to pinion the ducklings too long when they are so small, but with
thin small scissors and great care this way is no doubt a big improve-
ment on pinioning at a later age when a very poor time is had
by all.

When the special Waterfowl number, July-August, was published last year,
I had regretfully resigned myself to the fact that this must be the last Waterfowl
number till the end of the war ; with the curtailment and loss of so many collec-
tions and the spread of the war area, another Waterfowl number seemed a dream
too difficult to realize. But I received so many expressions of appreciation of
these special Waterfowl numbers that, being an incurable optimist, I determined
to endeavour to bring out another number. I wrote to the specialists in waterfowl,
and put the proposition before them, and in spite of their shortage of spare time
and the many difficulties which now beset them, they one and all responded.
To them is due the present number, and I would like to take this opportunity
of expressing to them my most grateful thanks and appreciation. Two authors
gave up their time during a few days rare leave to write their articles, another
wrote his during the intervals of heavy aerial bombardments, and all have spared
their small amount of leisure from some war activity.
Through the spread of the war our friends in America are now facing the
same difficulties and are as much immersed in war activities as we are on this
side of the Atlantic, but despite this each one I wrote to responded at once, and
no less than three articles from America appear in this number.

The Kelp Goose
There is a charming note on the Kelp Goose (Chloephaga antarctica ) on page 362
of Frank M. Chapman's The Autobiography of a Bird-lover.
Writing on a visit to Chile, he says : " Every two or three hundred yards
along rocky shores a snowy-white Kelp Goose, like a sentinel, stood conspicuously
in an exposed position. The brown female, if she were present, was practically
invisible. The behaviour of a pair of these birds that Walcott and I saw one
day convinced us of the functional value of their coloration.
With a family of six downy goslings, in single file, they were streaking along
shore, the female in the lead, the male closely bringing up the rear. When we
rowed toward them, the male left the young to the care of the female and boldly
came to the water's edge to dispute our landing. A gallant figure he made in his
spotless white, risking his life for the protection of his family. He waited until
we were within twenty feet of him, and then flew to the water behind us to decoy
us off shore. Meanwhile the female and young had disappeared."

In the March, 1913, number of the Avicultural Magazine, Mr. F. E. Blaauw,
in an extremely interesting article, records how he brought back a single specimen
from Chile (" My Antarctic Goose," p. 144).
" During a trip which I took in February, 1911, to Southern Chile, I had the
pleasure of seeing a good many Antarctic Geese on the rocks by the water's
edge in Smith's Channel, etc., and northwards as far as the southern coast of
the Island of Chiloe.
" The birds were generally seen in pairs, the white male being very con-
spicuous. whilst it was more difficult to see the female, which is blackish-brown
in colour. On the rocks round the coast of Ascension, the most northern island
of the Chonos Archipelago, these birds were particularly numerous, and I occasion-
ally saw as many as seven together."
It was on this island that " Walking cautiously along the sea shore I soon found
myself in close proximity to some Antarctic Geese, which were much tamer than
I expected. One pair of these birds in particular, which was standing on a rock
close to the village, allowed me to admire them from a very short distance. This
species of Goose is stouter and more robustly built than the other members of
the genus ; and the dazzling white male bird with its lemon-coloured legs and
feet, large black eyes and black bill, was a most beautiful object. The female is
chocolate brown, barred with white on the breast, the shoulders, back, and tail
are white, the bill is flesh coloured, the legs and feet pale yellow, while a
yellowish ring encircles the eyes." A captive bird was obtained from a native,
and, " On my asking how it had been fed, I was told ' It will feed on anything,
but you must not forget to give him Lutsche '. Now Lutsche is a kind of Kelp or
seaweed which grows on the rocks in a southern part of Chile and on which the
Geese feed. This is a thing which is easily procurable in the Chonos Archipelago,
but decidedly difficult to obtain anywhere else, except, perhaps, in Santiago where
it is sold in a dried state as human food."
Overcoming many difficulties, Mr. Blaauw brought the goose to Europe, " and
on the 29th May, I had the great satisfaction of landing my bird safely at Amster-
dam, and of settling him in his Dutch home at Gooilust on the same day."

" The most common and certainly the most facetious individual
of ornithology is the Tui (Parson-bird). Larger than a Blackbird
and more elegant in shape, his plumage is lustrous black irradiated
with green hues and pencilled with silver-grey, and he displays
a white throat tuft for his clerical bands. Parson bird though he
be, the Tui is no sullen anchorite mortifying the flesh. He is a bird
of the convivial rector order, fond of honey and taking of all the
fruits his rich living affords. Joyous Punchinello of the bush, he is
perpetual fun in motion. He can sing but seldom will, and preserves
his voice for mocking others. Darting from some low shrub to
the topmost twig of the tallest tree, he commences roaring forth such
a variety of strange noises with such changes of voice and volume
of tone as to claim the instant attention of the forest. Should
another Tui chance to be near he at once flits down for a sham
fight, throws a somersault or two and then darts into his bush only
to come forth the next minute with exhibition number two.
" Caught and caged, he is still the merry ventriloquist, mocks
cocks and cats, attempts the baby, and has been known to frighten
a nervous little dog off the premises. To add to his merits he
becomes such fine eating in the season of the poroporo berries
that an alderman might quit turtle and dare the seas to eat
Tui stew."
The foregoing which, in spite of its flavour of modern " daily-
press " journalism, was written nearly a hundred years ago, and

longer figures on New Zealand menus, this bird still continues to
be the most conspicuous of New Zealand's endemic avifauna.
Of all the native birds it is the best known. As soon as the visitor
to the Antipodes makes it known that he is interested in birds,
there is always the inevitable question, " Ah, have you heard
the Tui ? 53
As the foregoing indicates there is no skulking about the bush
with the Tui, wherever he lives he is always well in evidence,
blustering, aggressive, and extremely pugnacious, all for no
apparent reason except that perhaps he is working off some of his
superabundant energy. Fortunately he is not dangerous, and this
Nazi-like demeanour is only superficial and the only hurt suffered
by other birds is to their dignity.
In his native haunts the Tui is never still, dancing through the
bushes and trees, taking short dashing flights here and there ;
suddenly seeing another bird sitting on a branch, he will dash up
and knock it flying off its perch. No bird goes about its daily
business of life as noisily as the Tui, even his flight is noisy, it
resembles the loud rustle of silk, like that of most of the " dark 33
Birds of Paradise.
The assertion that the Tui sings but seldom is certainly wrong,
for few birds possessed of vocal powers give them so much exercise
as a Tui does ; he sings all the time, even captivity does not
diminish his ardour. His song is highly characteristic and peculiar ;
quite unlike the song of any other bird ; he pours it out with the
greatest of gusto. In the flow of sound are many remarkable bell-
like notes, but there are also many strange wheezing and coughing
sounds which certainly do not appeal to the human ear, but then
the Tui does not sing for human approbation--at least not usually,
but I have a cock bird, who, when I talk to him, will puff out his
glistening feathers until he is twice his normal size and obviously
sing for my benefit.
Fifty or so years ago the Tui was well known to aviculturists
in this country. Perhaps there are some of the older members of
the Society who can remember those far-off days in the nineties
when this bird was no uncommon exhibit on the show bench, but
it is a long time ago now since the last Tui was seen at a bird show,
with the exception of my cock bird which I sent to a local show
some few years ago.

Of the birds imported during the closing years of the last
century apparently few survived very long ; for one thing, nectar-
feeding birds were not understood in those days, and the foods
upon which they were fed tended to over-fatness, which is a sure
cause of death in a Tui. Starchy foods such as boiled potatoes,
crushed biscuits, honey, combined with lack of flying space accen-
tuated their early demise. Fed on solid and heavy food and con-
demned to sit in a cage, a Tui soon gets incredibly fat. To keep
these birds successfully they need a sparse diet and ample flying space.
The staple diet consists of a nectar mixture made as follows :
a heaped teaspoon of Mellin's Food, a dessert spoon of best quality
honey, and the same of Nestle's sweetened condensed milk in a
pint of hot water ; when thoroughly dissolved we pour half into
a cup and keep in the refrigerator for the next day, then make up
the remainder to a pint again with warm water so that the mixture
is very thin. The birds drink a lot of this but refuse to touch it if
the consistency is too thick. Besides this the birds are given various
soft fruits (at least before the war) such as sweet grapes, soft pears,
green figs and soft berries in season. No other kinds of fruits are
touched, which is understandable as the birds only eat what they
can lick up with their long forked tongues.
I never give orange, as I lost my best bird through feeding on
orange alone ; he refused to eat anything else and I was amazed to
find that he died through over-fatness ; he was incredibly fat and
his body must have weighed several pounds after death.
Tuis are very fond of flies, and in the warmer weather when the
birds are outside we fix up a small wire cage which hangs in the
middle of the aviary and contains a fish's head ; this attracts great
numbers of flies especially when the head is rather " ripe " ! The
Tuis are remarkably agile in catching these flies, in fact they catch
them with the agility of a Flycatcher. The exercise is very good for
the birds and tends to counterbalance any superfluous fat they
may have accumulated during the winter months.
No bird is more strictly protected in its native country than this
one, and no one, not even Zoological Societies, is allowed to keep
one, let alone export them. My own birds got on to a ship which was
leaving New Zealand and it was quite impossible to take them
back. They are probably the only ones in captivity anywhere at
the present time so it will be understood how I treasure them.

As mentioned before, I once sent the cock to a Foreign Bird
Show, but I should never do this again, for the lack of exercise,
through being closed up in a small show cage is dangerous. When
he got back into his aviary he nearly went mad with joy, and he
sang as I have never heard him sing before or since.
New Zealanders who have stayed with me in England have
said, before they knew I had some of these birds, " Do you know
I dreamed I was back in New Zealand this morning and heard
the Tuis singing," and I had to assure them that it was not a
dream after all !
Once exceedingly common in all the forested parts of New
Zealand, the Tui at the present time is only found in certain suit-
able localities. With the clearing of most of the native forest, the
birds' food supply has gone, and it can now only maintain itself
where the native flora has been left. Being a honey-sucker, the
birds' food is mainly the nectar of the flowering shrubs and trees,
especially the flowers of the Pohutuhawa (Metrosideros tomentosa) and
Rata (M. robusta ). It is a sight never to be forgotten seeing
these lovely birds flitting about in the brilliant sunshine on the
venerable Pohutuhawa trees, which in the summer are a mass of
crimson blossoms.
These beautiful trees live to a great age and horizontally reach
enormous proportions. They grow only by the waters of Pacific in
restricted parts of the North Island, being found in their greatest
abundance on the small islands off the north-east coast and it is
there the Tuis are most plentiful.
Strange to say the birds are common on Stewart Island where
the climate is far from congenial even in the summer time, and the
winters are bitterly cold. One would naturally think that the Tui
was a hardy creature but few birds are more susceptible to the
cold of the English climate than this one. Few New Zealand birds
flourish well in Europe, most of them, except the Ducks, are
exceedingly delicate. I think this is mainly due to the fact that
they have no immunity against diseases prevalent outside New
Zealand. My birds are never put outside before June and brought
in again in September. Outside they agree fairly well together but
in indoor aviaries it is impossible to keep hen and cock together.
The moult is in July and August and this enables the birds to
.moult when outside. This is a very good thing, for a moult inside is

weakening and the feathers are never as glossy or as strong if the
birds are moulted inside.
The birds are very keen on bathing and few are more fastidious.
They refuse to go into water that is not absolutely fresh, and only
bathe when immediately fresh water has been put in their bath.
They love to have a fine spray from a hose-pipe played on them, and
after it has rained they flutter about the bushes in their aviary
getting thoroughly wet.
The Tui is about the shape of a Blackbird but considerably
larger. His plumage for the most part is a dark shining bottle-
green. The feathers of the back are a kind of metallic bronze,
which glint with all colours of the rainbow when caught by a ray
of sunlight. The central wing-coverts are white and form a con-
spicuous bar on the wing, though this is seldom seen except when
the bird is in flight. Old males in perfect condition seem to puff
out the breast feathers when they sing, in the form of a heart-
shaped shield ; this is more or less formed by the long side and
flank feathers which increase in length with age. My cock bird does
this both when he sings and when I talk to him. The Tui has two
peculiar features not found in any other bird ; a " mane " of fine
grey filamentous and hackled feathers, which somewhat remind one
of old lace, on the back of the neck and which fall in little curls
towards the throat. The most striking feature, however, is a snow-
white tuft of filamentous plumes which curl into a little ball on the
throat, though sometimes there appears to be two of these balls.
The construction of these feathers is very strange, for they are not
separate but grow on the tips of the ordinary throat feathers in two
sections which cross each other. These tufts resemble, on a small
scale, the little white " poi 55 balls used by the Maoris in the " Poi-
dances ", hence one of its names, " Poi-bird." These little balls
wobble about all the time the bird sings. After death these tufts
lose their shape and become uncurled. So one gets no idea what
they are like from a " stuffed " bird. They then bear some fancied
resemblance to the white throat-bands which clerics used to wear
in the eighteenth century, and the early naturalists, seeing only the
skins, called it the " Parson-bird ", a name by which it was known
to the old time aviculturists.
The Tui feeds, besides nectar, on insects and berries, as there are
few flowers in New Zealand in the winter time. I have often

watched the birds behaving like giant Tits, assuming all manner of
positions ; searching the undersides of leaves, nicks and crannies in
the trunks of trees, balls of dead leaves, and even under the eaves of
houses for insects. My own birds when put outside in the late
spring make a systematic search of their aviary, putting their long
tongues in between chinks of the woodwork, feeling if there are
spiders there.
In the old days the Tui was a favourite article of diet with the
Maoris and large numbers were potted down for winter use, the
birds being caught during the season when the " porporo " berries
are ripe, after feeding on which they became very fat. The old
bushman and settlers also highly esteemed the Tui as an ingredient
of pies. Its shining feathers were also used in the manufacture of the
Maoris famous feathered cloaks.
It has been stated that the bird was commonly kept by the
Maoris as a pet, and it was " the only bird which the Maoris taught
to talk and for this purpose they trimmed the end of its tongue ".
This latter assertion is ridiculous, for being a honey-sucker the
bird would quickly die should its tongue be cut.
Both sexes sing, though I think the male is the more voluble.
They sing all the year round, usually all day long, except when
moulting ; even then the cock sometimes does a little tuning up.
Few birds make such an attractive pet as this one ; he is always
full of high spirits and no birds, not even Canaries, sing as much in
captivity as this one ; though his charm, I am afraid, will never
be appreciated again outside his own shores, for the exportation of
any of these birds out of New Zealand is very unlikely. The
following is taken from Bird and Forest , the organ of the New
Zealand Native Bird Protection Society, and gives a good idea of the
wild life of the Tui :--
" This is the gayest and most aggressive bird in the forest,
noted throughout the land for its extreme rapidity of movement,
the gloss and sheen of its plumage, the wild outbursts of joyful notes,
its general air of bustle, happiness, and gaiety. We know it as one
of our main honey-eaters. To enable it to collect the nectar from
rata and kowhai and other honey-producing flowers its tongue is
furnished at the tip with a brush of exquisite fineness. It is a
beautiful sight to see these charming songsters clinging and swinging
in grotesque postures on the brilliant crimson blooms of the rata,

sipping the nectar and flying every few minutes to some bough to
gladden the forest with an ecstasy of song. In the winter they may
leave the bush and visit civilization to feed on the nectar provided
by the tree lucerne and certain eucalyptus which flower at this
time. Then in early spring the kowhai groves are visited by flocks of
Tuis, the trees echoing with a continuous peal as the birds practise
their acrobatics in obtaining the nectar from the pendulous flowers.
Berries and insects, many of the latter caught on the wing, supple-
ment the diet.
" The Tui is at all times a lively and active bird, with flight
rapid, graceful, almost undulating, the rustle of wings plainly
audible. Delight is found in combined display. c Perhaps ten or
even more will turn, twist, throw somersaults, drop from a height
with expanded wings and tails or perform other antics, till, as if
guided by some preconcerted signal, they suddenly dive into the
forest and are lost to view.' The varied notes of this, our most
remarkable songster, continually break the stillness of the bush.
Although thoroughly joyous only in the full glow of sunlight, it
nevertheless sings earliest in the morning and latest at night of all
the bush birds. It is remarkable for the variety of notes as well as
the versatile manner of delivery. A medley of musical notes will
intermingle with chucklings, clicks, and clucks ; beautiful liquid
sounds will be followed by a noise not unlike the breaking of a pane
of glass or perhaps a series of gentle sobs ; dainty whisper songs
alternate with coughs and sneezes. After sunset the wild revelry
ceases. Until darkness sets in the song consists of a succession of
notes like the tolling of a distant bell.
" The nest is placed in the fork of a bushy shrub or perhaps
among the leafy tops of a forest tree. Fairly wide and shallow,
it often has an untidy appearance because of the interlaced twigs
and rootlets which project in all directions. These twigs are often
mixed with coarse green moss ; sometimes cobwebs are used to
hold them together. The cavity is lined with fibrous grasses or the
black hair-like substance from young tree-fern fronds, and
occasionally with feathers. Three or four eggs are laid, variable
in form and colour, but usually white with a faint rosy blush and
lightly freckled all over with pale reddish brown or marbled with
rust-red veins. The Tui is a courageous bird, and will allow no
others in the vicinity of the nest. If an intruder approaches a nest

with young, one bird always on the watch will give a piercing alarm
cry which attracts other Tuis to the spot. While the hen bird is
sitting the male will perch on a high tree, and throughout the day
pour out his soul in song. The hen will even sing on the eggs, a most
unusual occurrence among birds. During the first week the young
are fed entirely on insects, but later berries such as fuchsia are
added to the diet."

By Sir B. H. Bourdillon, G.C.M.G., K.B.E., F.Z.S.
An enforced sojourn of nearly three weeks at Bathurst last
February, with no work I could possibly do even if I had wanted
to (which I did not), gave me an excellent opportunity of adding
to my knowledge of West African birds, and I was lucky enough
during that time to see no less than 150 different species, 60 of
which I had not seen in Nigeria. Most of my time was spent around
the swamps and in the " bush " between Bathurst and Cape St.
Mary, but I was lucky enough to get a week-end's trip up the river,
and I also visited Brufut and other villages a short distance from
Bathurst. Government House, the residence of my kind hosts, Sir
Thomas and Lady Southorn, housed a good many species, includ-
ing a Peregrine and a Gold Oriole, in its beautiful garden. A
Gambian Blue-breasted Kingfisher gave me a magnificent view of
himself there one morning ; Bronze Mannakins and Red-billed
Fruit Finches were always busy in the shrubs and Speckled Pigeons
on the roof, while the long-tailed Glossy Starlings kept up a raucous
chorus, especially when the Peregrine was about. One morning
I saw two other long-tailed species, the Black Magpie and the
Senegal Wood Hoopee (a dull bird when compared with the
Guinea species), in company with the Starlings in one corner of
the garden.
The first stranger to catch my attention was a Woodchat,
which I afterwards found fairly commonly. The only other Shrikes
which I saw were the Gambian Puff-back, the Senegambian Long-
tailed Shrike, and the Barabary. The latter, looking almost like

a Blackbird as he flies away from you, has brilliant scarlet under-
parts and a bright yellow crest. His call consists of two beautifully
liquid notes, with an interval of exactly an octave. Sometimes
the high note comes first, sometimes the low, and occasionally
the low note (but never the high) is repeated twice without the
other. The lady answers with a harsh double click which either
follows immediately after or more rarely coincides with the second
note of her mate's call.
Birds of prey were very numerous. Vulturine Fish Eagles were
everywhere. I saw only one Sea Eagle, but no less than six Ospreys,
one near the coast and five during my up-river trip. Others,
besides the Peregrine, were the African Hobby, the Lizard Buzzard,
the Red-necked Kestrel, the Eritrean Shikra, the Gabar Goshawk,
Wahlberg's Eagle, the Grasshopper Buzzard Eagle, the Black-
crested Hawk Eagle, Montagu's Harrier, and the West African
Harrier Hawk. The Montagu was good enough to fly slowly round
me, displaying very clearly the distinguishing black bars across his
wings. The Harrier Hawk was fairly common and several times
I watched him probing, presumably for insects, among the bases of
the fronds of palm-trees.
Of Herons, the commonest was the Reef, which I saw every-
where, near the coast and up-river. The somewhat similar, but
handsomer, Black Heron, I only saw once. Squacco were more
common than in Nigeria, but the Green-backed Heron much less
common ; I only saw one. Up-river I saw Goliath and Black-
headed Herons, and Grey and Purple near the coast. Other birds
seen up-river were the Woolly-necked Stork, the Wood Ibis,
Sacred Ibis, Haddada, Great Egret, Lesser Egret, Cattle Egret,
African Darter, White-fronted Cormorant, Crested Crane, Spur-
winged Geese, and the not very common Bronze-winged Courser,
which I shot thinking that he was some kind of Plover that I did
not know.
Of Plover I saw the Spur-winged and Senegal Wattled Plover
frequently, the Grey once or twice, and the Ringed Plover fairly
often.
Whimbrel were seen up the river and in a swamp near
Bathurst, with an occasional Curlew in the latter place. This
swamp also produced Pelican (very common up the river), Wood
Ibis, and on one occasion African Spoonbill. I was not at first

certain that the latter were not Great Egrets, but as they rose against
the evening sky their bills were unmistakable.
One small swamp, less than half an acre in extent and absolutely
next to the main road to the aerodrome, usually managed to hold
something of interest. It was the only place where I saw Black-
winged Stilt and Black-tailed Godwit, and it also produced Red-
shanks, Greenshanks, and Green Curlew and Common Sand-
pipers. On the other side of it one day there were a lot of Least
Bee-eaters. The White-throated Bee-eater was fairly common, and
up-river I saw the European Bee-eater displaying himself to great
advantage in a tree, which also contained three native beehives !
The Yellow-bellied Parrot was common, the Long-tailed
Parrakeet less so. The Senegal and Blue-breasted Rollers were
common, the Broad-billed Roller I only saw once, out at Brufut,
where I also saw the Bearded Barbet, the only Barbet to show
himself.
One morning I visited the creek near the Municipal Incinerator.
The foreshore was thickly lined with Turnstone and Ringed
Plover, while behind them were a large number of White and
Blue-headed Wagtail ; a Yellow Wagtail also, I thought, but
could not be sure. Among the Wagtails, of all strange things, was
an unmistakable Tree Pipit. He seemed a bit ashamed of both
his company and his surroundings, as directly he saw me he flew
up into a stumpy bush which was the only tree near, and proceeded
to preen himself with his back to his garbage-hunting companions
of a minute before !
An unusual sight out at Brufut one morning was an ungainly
procession of no less than forty-nine Allied Hornbills. The Grey
and Red-beaked Hornbill I saw frequently. The Grey Plantain-
eater was fairly common. The Violet Plantain-eater I only saw
once. I thought I identified him a quarter of a mile away, and he
most obligingly flew straight over me and confirmed my first
impression.
Among the small fry, besides Mannakins and Fire-Finches,
the Orange-cheeked Waxbill and the Cordon Bleu were seen on

winged Grass Warblers.

Atlantic Islands Gull, but of Terns several, the Caspian, Royal,
Sandwich, Little African, and Bridled. A sandbank off the coast
held at least fifty Caspian Terns at one end one morning, and a
rather smaller number of Oyster Catchers at the other.
The Gambia has not many attractions to offer the visitor, but
I hope that this rather catalogue-like account of my short stay there
may attract others to follow my example in more peaceful times.
In spite of the excellent work done by Bates and Bannerman and
others (including Dr. Hopkinson, all too little of whose knowledge
is, alas, available in print) the field for further work in West Africa is
very wide.
Of all the pleasant memories of my short stay in Bathurst one,
I think, will always stand out. It was at Brufut one morning, and
I was looking at an unknown (to me) Weaver in the top of a mango
tree when my companion, a young Air Force Officer who had a
morning off, called my attention to a small thorn tree not twenty
yards off. The lower branches were absolutely crowded with small
birds which, on inspection, proved to be twenty or thirty Cordon
Bleu, and a smaller number of Lavender Waxbills, absolutely
jostling each other as if on a perch in a small cage. It was the first
time I had ever seen the Lavender Waxbill, and I had not the
faintest idea what it was. Out came our note-books and " Crimson
back, rump, tail and upper and under tail coverts, remainder
lavender grey, with black eyes and lores " was what I wrote. A
further examination of the bush, for it was nothing more, showed
Bulbuls, Weavers, and Brown Babblers, and when I walked up
to it after the birds had gone, I flushed a Long-tailed Nightjar.
I could see no insects, nor anything else to account for this extra-
ordinary collection of birds.

By V. A. V. Carr
It seems rather an extraordinary circumstance that those
birds which in their natural state are, in habits, both shy and
reclusive, when reared by hand away from their parents make
ideal pets with little inclination to stray from their owners and
new habitations. Particularly is this so of the Corvida , which
includes Ravens, Jays, Magpies, Choughs and so on. Can one
envisage a more retiring bird than a Raven ? Found in hilly
districts and rocky coasts where the human creature seldom
intrudes and then only when circumstances compel, it lives on
carrion , meat and fresh meat if occasion demands.
And yet, if taken from the nest as soon as it has a few feathers
and reared by the human hand, one has a bird almost as faithful
as a dog and as intelligent. If simple phrases are repeated regularly
the Raven can be taught to talk as plainly as it is possible to speak,
especially if one voice and the same phrases are used at regular
intervals.
The Magpie, a wily, cunning, and very shy bird by nature,
likewise makes a wonderful hand-reared pet. My sister reared one
eight years ago and it used to be housed near the garage. No
particular effort was used to teach this bird to talk, until one
day he used a phrase, " Where are you going ? 55 quite distinctly
and to the pleasant surprise of those around. Nobody had
deliberately used this phrase for his special benefit, but being
situated near the garage he had apparently heard it many times.
This bird, named " Sal ", could be released all day if necessary
as he would stay around, sometimes walking around the lawn,
flying in the house, and wandering on the tops of other aviaries.
This wandering about tended to upset other aviary inmates as he
used to have many impolite pecks at them, and for this reason was
confined to his own quarters. One weakness this bird possessed
was for ladies' legs--whether they were covered with silk stockings
or not and if one was not watchful he would fetch blood, in a very
impolite way mind you !
The Raven we possess, " Bill " by name, is over ten years old
to date and says very distinctly, " What do you want?" " Come

on then," " Wow, wow, wow." If some tit-bit is offered and the
phrases uttered Bill will repeat them until you come to the latter
one and then on the demand " Bark ! " he will reel off the " Wow,
wow, wow ". We get much amusement from watching the expres-
sions of those who have not heard this bird talk, as the voice is so
human and certainly more distinct than a lot of voices I have heard.
For birds of this size it is rather amazing how little they will
eat and will go a long time without food or water. This, no doubt,
is due to their rather precarious livelihood, gained in desolate
areas with the chance of sneaking some dead sheep from mountain
crags or scraps from Buzzard and Peregrine eeries usually found
in such quarters.
The Jackdaw, not quite so prone to such shy behaviour, but
very cautious and watchful, looses all this when reared by hand, and
if treated quietly and not frightened will grow very attached to his
owner. I have not heard one speak very distinctly but they will
say "Jack" in a more human way than they do when wild.
They get very fussy, putting their crests up and their heads down for
a scratching, delighting, no doubt, in the sensation that is caused.
The Jackdaw we possess will follow the car for miles flying
alongside and settling through the sliding roof and riding on the
driver's shoulder. If one stops he will fly off, returning immediately
his name is shouted, and even in a town he will find his owner and
settle amongst a crowd.
For beauty one cannot beat the Jay, especially if it is a cock and
colour fed when moulting.
One could recount many interesting tales and experiences
gained from their birds, but the star turn was a Jay which, when
liberated would go and sit on top of a high tree. Some unsus-
pecting person would stand and gaze at him marvelling at this
beauty until a cigarette was offered and accepted by the victim.
Upon being lit, Mr. Jay would immediately dart down from his
lofty perch snatch the cigarette from the victim's lips and disappear
again, leaving a trail of smoke and a very disgruntled admirer !
Carrion Crows make very delightful pets especially if one is
disposed to acts of playful annoyance. They will chase all the
dogs in the district, swooping down and pecking their tails, whilst
the dogs make valiant but vain attempts to snap. They usually
get shot at, coming home with broken legs or, more often than not,

not returning at all, making one wonder exactly who had done such
a rotten trick.
In this respect, one year we reared a nest of Jays, which had
their liberty for quite a long time until one day a neighbouring
farmer very sorrowfully brought three back dead. Being neigh-
bours one did not like to put into words exactly what one thought
of this horrible act, but his words of apology were : " I thought they
were taking my eggs so I shot one, not knowing they were yours.
The sound of the explosion sent over two more, which I downed in
the same way, and as I was picking them up one squawked which
attracted another which settled on the end of my gun. Then I
realized they were yours and had been reared by hand."
All these types of birds are easy to rear and quite easy to keep,
especially in these days of lack of oil seeds which are imported.
Odd scraps, meal, bread, fowls' innards, fish-heads, and any other
offals do admirably. If kept clean both in their nests and when they
emerge, and treated gently, they will remain faithful until the end.
The usual fate that a lot suffer is to fall in a tub full of water, and
one is well advised to cover all water butts with wire netting.
On no account release these birds just before, during, and after
the breeding season, as they usually want to find a mate and
sometimes they make off, not to return with their mate, but
to disappear with him or her as the case may be. The
Chough likewise is an ideal pet when hand-reared, and I have
never had the pleasure of doing this. Those that I have seen
are really beautiful and one cannot believe they are in the same
group as Magpies, etc. Their curved bright bill and bright red
feet with such a glossy feather effect and their charming dis-
position make them very desirable. They are more delicate feeders,
shouting the house down, as it were, if they view a tin of mealworms.
It is a great pity that one has not the time and hardly the right
inclination to delight in the charm of nature these days. But when
better days return and one's mind can more easily absorb and
delight in these wonders of nature what better joy could there be
than to look up to the sky and instead of Spitfires, Wellingtons, and
Hurricanes zooming about, Jays, Magpies, and Jackdaws hurtle
down to one's shoulder looking for tit-bits which now even we
ourselves are denied.

I have spent an early June week-end in the country, with my
friends Mr. and Mrs. Milton Erlanger, and for the first time in many
months I have had the time, and everlasting pleasure, to watch
aviary birds. This may sound strange, as my present position of
Technical Adviser to the New York Zoological Park gives me the
control of the mammals, birds, and reptiles, and our collection of
birds is the best now existing, numbering 1,800 specimens of 700
species, about half of which are perching birds. But my duties are
many and absorbing, with planning, committee meetings, and
office work, and I have little time to do more than quickly examine
the birds in our Zoo. Mr. Lee Crandall, the Curator, and Head
Keeper George Scott, themselves overworked, are both excellent
aviculturists, and I rely upon them to take care of our birds.
Although we almost entirely lack suitable outdoor accommodation,
so necessary to many species, the condition of our collection is
excellent, the longevity of our birds being quite remarkable, with
losses at a minimum. But, as I have just said, our outdoor flights
are almost non-existing, a deplorable state of affairs which would
already have been remedied if the war had not brought in additional
difficulties.
It is therefore quite a delight to be able to visit garden aviaries
such as those we were used to in England and in France. Mrs.
Erlanger, an enthusiastic bird lover and a fine aviculturist, has only
a few years ago gone in for bird-keeping on a large scale. Her first
interest has been dogs and her kennel of poodles is one of the best
in the world. However, she always kept cage birds.
Her present installation consists of several outdoor planted
aviaries and more are now being completed. They are located
along or close to her beautiful house at Elberon, on the coast of
New Jersey, in her pretty and shady gardens. Along the western
wall of the house, beyond a spacious veranda, one first finds a
small bird room, with several fixed cages, two of which constitute
the shelters of an outdoor aviary. This consists of two communi-
cating compartments, 12 feet wide and 10 feet high, each 15 feet
long. This length of 30 feet runs along the house, several windows

of which open in the aviary itself, and afford excellent observation
posts. The far end of the second compartment is made of vitrex
panels, and about 3 feet of the roof next to it is glassed over.
The aviary is shaded by two large maples, the big trunks of which
pass through the wire roof. The flights are both quite thickly
planted with various ornamental shrubs, and the outer partition is
overgrown with honeysuckle and other vines, so that the birds
are almost invisible from outside and can only be seen either from
the bird rooms or through the windows of the house, quite a
pleasant arrangement, which ensures a cosy and intimate habitat
for them.
The inhabitants of this aviary are numerous and their condition
is wonderful, as is also their tameness. I have spent several hours
feeding and watching them, and although I have certainly missed
a number of species, I have noticed the following ones : Shama,

some of the more common birds, or those which I have not detected.
All these birds are put out in the beginning of May and removed
to heated winter quarters at the end of October. American summers,
on the East Coast, are a good deal warmer and more humid than
those of England and Northern France, and therefore much more
favourable to tropical birds--a fact rarely acknowledged by avi-
culturists in this country, and which accounts to a great extent for
the scarcity of outdoor aviaries in this part of the world. Many
birds nest annually in the aviary just described. If a number do

not succeed in rearing their young to maturity, as always happens
in a large, mixed collection, quite a few do raise a family, particularly
hole-nesting species. Parson and Shaft-tail Finches both had
young at the time of my last visit.
A short distance away, behind a charming rose garden, stands
a double aviary, the back two-thirds of the roof of which is pro-
tected by vitrex. The two compartments, each 12 feet by 15 feet
and well planted, are used as breeding summer quarters. One
contains a pair of Bullfinches, the only ones in America, this rather
rare and beautiful bird being stupidly considered dangerous as a
possible breeder if liberated, and consequently now barred to
enter the United States. They nested last year, but did not rear
their brood, and they have not yet started this season. There are
also seven or eight pairs of Gouldian Finches that were very
successful last season, a pair of Rufous-tailed Finches, one pair
of Red Siskins, and a pair of Chinese Quail, also successful last
year. The other aviary is the home of two pairs of Red-headed
Parrot Finches, a pair of Diamond Doves, and a pair of Bleeding-
heart Pigeons, all nesting.
A little further away, three compartments of an old dog kennel,
whose inhabitants have now been removed to another farm, have
been transformed into very practical aviaries, each with a roomy
shelter and a long, outdoor flight. Many more will be completed
when conditions permit. One contains a pair of Nicobar Pigeons,
a Dyal Bird and two hand-reared and absurdly tame Orange-
rumped Tanagers. The following one is inhabited by the only pair
of Scarlet Cocks-of-the-Rock ever seen in a private collection.
They were brought over last December by Charles Cordier, are
extremely tame, and in perfect condition. They do not quarrel at
all and may attempt to breed. The last compartment contains a
pair of Grayson's Doves.
Although most of Mrs. Milton Erlanger's time is now taken
by strenuous war work, particularly the organization of " Dogs
for Defence ", she still has time to supervise her bird collection,
keep it going, and even increase it. Our English colleagues who
manage to maintain theirs in spite of tremendous difficulties will
be happy to hear the same spirit is prevailing here, and will prevail
whatever may come.

By Frances E. Matthews
Those who agree with Keats that " A thing of beauty is a joy for
ever " will apply that thought to their birds and their flowers.
The " spirit of beauty " is personified in such treasures. We
find special joy when the sunlight brings out the rainbow hues in
our birds' plumage, and at the same time rouses them to song or
some special evidence of their love and trust in us.
The flowers, too, seem to quiver into more joyous life when seen
in sunlight split by a gentle shower.
Midst all the sadness, and the sordid cares, can we capture
some thoughts upon Nature's lavish gifts and find a table in the
Wilderness.
A father once would teach his little son (during their walks)
to find the purpose for the existence of every gift bestowed on man
by the Creator's hand. He asked him " Why did God make the
flowers ? What use are they ? " The child thought long then said :
" I specs He made them to amoose Himself."
May we not say with reference to our birds that many of them
seem to have stood within the rainbow's circle to obtain their
glorious primary colours ! Were they not given us to speak of hope
and the promise attached to the bow in the cloud ! They should
cheer us now when life is run in the minor key. I have ventured to
dwell on beauty in birds, but there is also the comfort derived from
their company, and the pleasure of guarding them for others to
enjoy in future years.
Many bird lovers owning a varied collection could write a
valuable diary of their observations which others would appreciate
greatly. My knowledge is a limited one and some species have
been given up owing to present restrictions. Amongst the Finches,
the Gouldians painted in rainbow colours take pride of place.
Owing to the severe winter a small crowd of them lived in an alcove
wired off a sitting room with a large window. They have space
to fly.
" There's good luck in odd numbers " (and safety ?) said
Rory O'More in the Irish song. I thought the same and left my
cocks and hens together. But the birds seemed to think it was nesting

time, so I found my old pair had made a nest by the radiator, and
another pair dragged hefty tussocks of grass to some spot over the
blind and near the ceiling. All their arrangements were being inter-
fered with by a very lively last year's cock not yet in colour.
A room adjoining mine contained amongst others a Shama, a
Budgerigar and a Zebra Finch, ages between seven and five years--
the latter two in a partitioned cage. With early morning sounds
the Shama breaks into song. For some time I feared he would not
bear the change of food, but since through the kindness of a friend
I obtained mealworms and have bred them, this bird is quite fit now.
He often copies the Parrots' whistle downstairs or imitates the
Budgerigar.
Being companions for so many years the Finch and Budgerigar
come out together daily and fly about. Standing on one's head and
shoulder. The Finch is often put in my pocket, but he returns to
his former post and starts his song again, nothing daunted.
The Zebra has never got over the insulting way the Budgerigar
imitates his Castonet ( Castanotis ) song sung for my benefit. The
imitation is so good that it is hard to detect it from the original.
To make it complete the Budgerigar adds a bit of ventriloquism.
First he gives Finch's song, then the indignant remonstrance from
him both produced together . The small bird stands up to the big one
and drives him off frequently. But the Budgie tries to feed the
Zebra and talks to him in endearing terms all day long.
Our female Grey Parrot is very verbose, and has rather a good
repertoire. We had her very young and she came ten years ago.
Her seed diet has had to be supplemented a good deal. At meals,
she repeats the word " Well " several times. If that fails, "Is it
nice ? " Then as her hopes of attention wane, "Is it all gone ? "
War-time buns are a speciality. She walks about the room and
then I find her climbing up on my knee, where she behaves very
well. She finally has her drink of tea and morsel of bun.
This tale becomes commonplace and homely. I would it might
provoke someone in their spare moments to share with us their
birds' diary.

It is with much regret that we have to record the passing of
one of our oldest members, Mr. James B. Housden, on nth July,
at the ripe age of 92. He was a keen aviculturist all his life and
took a great interest in our Society since its foundation in which
he took an active part.
Well do I remember my first meeting with Mr. Housden nearly
half a century ago. I called at his house at Sydenham and he took
me to see his birds which were housed in very business-like aviaries
in his garden, I was impressed by the number, their fine condition
and the many rare species, most of which were new to me in those
my early days of aviculture.
Just before I left, he took from his pocket a proof of the first
number of a new magazir^e, to be named The Avicultural Magazine ,
the Journal of the Avicultural Society which had just been founded.
I was very pleased when he offered to put me up as a Member.
In those days his foreign birds were always to the fore at the
annual Crystal Palace show, and many were the prizes he received
for his rarities.
He never lost his great interest in birds and even spent part of the
last evening of his life in looking at his favourite bird books.
In his old age he took more than one trip to visit a nephew in
Texas, and in spite of a rough and somewhat dangerous journey
in the wilds of that country, for one in the late seventies, enjoyed
his experiences to the full as may be gathered from his articles
entitled " The Call of the Wild 55 in the volumes of our magazine
for 1928 and 1929.

The Ocellated Turkey
It is well known that the Ocellated Turkey (Meleagris ocellata) is a decidedly
difficult bird to rear.
It may, of course, be that in nature the young are specialized feeders, but in
captivity it seems that they do not so much go wrong from any particular cause,
but rather that they take full advantage of all the disastrous things that can
happen to them.
However tame they may be, they remain stupidly temperamental, and no
doubt this is a serious obstacle to their early progress. Writing of his visit to
Chichen, Yucatan, in 1896, Frank M. Chapman, in his book, The Autobiography
of a Bird-Lover, gives an account of an attempt to rear a large number of these
birds. It is true that the attempt was made nearly fifty years ago, but it will

be seen that it was carried out in the birds' native climate and under a variety
of conditions.
" The one bird of all others that I hoped to see about Chichen was the Ocellatcd
Turkey, which is found only in Yucatan, and the adjoining parts of Central
America. That a bird of such economic value has not been domesticated is
significant. The Spaniards found the Wild Turkey (Meleagris gallopavo) of the
Mexican tableland in the possession of the Aztecs and introduced it into Europe,
whence, as is well known, it was carried to North America. But although
Chachalacas and Curassows are common inhabitants of Mayan dooryards, the
Indians had not succeeded in the taming of the Ocellated Turkey (Agriocharis
ocellata ).
In spite of the inference to be drawn from this fact, Dr. Gaumer, stimulated
by an offer from Boucard, a bird dealer, of six hundred dollars for each bird
delivered alive in Paris, determined to attempt to rear them. In view of the
efforts that have been made from time to time to introduce the Ocellated Turkey
into the United States, the results of Dr. Gaumer's experiment, as he recounted it
to me, are worth recording. He purchased about 430 eggs of wild birds from
the Indians at prices ranging from twenty-five cents to one dollar a dozen. They
were set under hens and domesticated Mexican Turkeys in the city and in the
country, numbers of people being entrusted with sittings in order that the chicks
might be brought out under as widely varying conditjpns as possible.
About 400 eggs hatched. The town-born chicks succumbed first, and, at the
age of two days, would suddenly droop their wings and die. At the end of three
months 300 birds were living. During the succeeding three months the mortality
was high, and at the end of six months only 37 birds remained alive. Eight
months later there were but 14 survivors. With these Dr. Gaumer started for
Paris, but by the time he reached Progreso only four remained. He, however,
continued his journey, and reached New York with two birds apparently in a
dying condition. These he sold to Reiche, an animal dealer, for $100 each.
Reiche exhibited them on Coney Island and with the aid of flaring posters cleared
$1,700. The birds had now recovered their health, and Reiche sold them to an
European Zoo for $500 each. It is possible that if the causes of death were known
they might be combated and the birds successfully reared, but it is not probable
that they would thrive outside the faunal zone of which they are natives."

THE CONGO PEACOCK IN CAPTIVITY
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.976569857142857" page_id="56350569"  page_num="123" year="" vol="">
Captain Delacour thinks that you and the readers of the Avicultural
Magazine would be interested to hear of the success Mr. T. Herrling and his
wife have had in keeping captive examples of the Congo Peacock (Afropavo
congensis ). Nearly a year ago I learned that Mr. Herrling had sent two eggs of
this interesting bird to the representative of the Mus6e du Congo Beige at Leopold-
ville. Towards the end of January Mr. Herrling himself wrote me how they
were secured.
In 1938 he was sent as Agent Territorial to Jhela in the Upper Tshuapa
District of the Belgian Congo. After spending some time in that vicinity, he
persuaded natives to secure a few living Congo Peacocks for him. The first
was an adult male, which soon died. Next he obtained a pair, they were very
wild at first ; but when placed in a roomy, shaded cage they gradually settled
down, and for about six months they thrived under the devoted care of Madame
Herrling. By the time the male bird sickened and died, another pair had been

added to the aviary, so there remained one cock with two hens. The trio lived
peacefully for five months, and then one of the hens made her nest in a dark
corner, on the ground, and laid three eggs of a light rufous-brown colour. One
of these eggs hatched on the 26th day after incubation began. The hen performed
all the duties of incubation, but the newly-hatched chick was cared for especially
by the cock, under whose wing it spent the night. Unfortunately this buffy-
brown chick died on its fourth day, and its skin could not be preserved.
Mr. Herrling left Jhela in May of last year, but he believes that one pair of
his Congo Peacocks still survives there, and perhaps it will be possible to transport
them to the Zoo at Leopoldville. At any rate, his experience proves that it is
possible to breed Afropavo in captivity, and strengthens our confidence that the
birds will be seen in zoological gardens of Europe and America soon after the
present war has been won. It may be recalled that during the summer of 1939
Captain Delacour was considering sending Mr. Charles Cordier to the Congo
to secure some. Had it not been for the protective regulations and the outbreak
of war, the beloved Chateau de Cleres might have welcomed the first Peacock
emigrants from the Congo.

The Hon. Mary Hawke writes on 12th June :--
I have moved from Henfield to Partridge Green, and I could not get my
big aviary moved, so put my breeding pair of King Parrakeets (after 14 days
in a large cage) into an open roof aviary. There was a tremendous gale here on
26th and 27th May and the roof blew off and was smashed in the night. Next
afternoon the cock came and called in the oak trees near and fed on the buds ;
the next day he was seen with the hen, but after that he lost her for a few days
and I heard no more till ten days later I heard they were together at Bines Green,
about 2 miles away. Can any breeders help me in any way ? I should like their
advice. Is there any chance of getting them in the autumn ? I am afraid they
will be shot. I am willing to pay #5 for their return.

THE BREEDING OF GALAPAGOS FINCHES
IN CALIFORNIA
By Eric Campbell Kinsey
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.99697484" page_id="56350577"  page_num="" year="" vol="">
In the December, 1938, issue of the Avicultural Magazine,
a brief notice appeared to the effect that a scientific expedition
would shortly leave Great Britain for the Galapagos Islands.
This expedition, headed by Messrs. David Lambert Lack,
L. S. V. Venables, and W. Hugh Thompson, and sponsored by the
Royal Society and the Zoological Society of London had, among
its objects, the capture and study of certain of the ground Finches
of the genus Geospiza , which, it will be recalled, was of particular
interest to Charles Darwin who headed the first scientific exploration
of the Islands more than a century ago and who wrote of them in
The Voyage of the Beagle and The Origin of Species. These Finches,
because of their environmental isolation, have developed many
interesting characteristics, sociologically as well as structurally.
The expedition reached the Islands in mid December, 1938,
and proceeded to make extensive studies of these Finches in their
natural habitat. Subsequently, a number of the birds were trapped
and held in aviaries on the Islands in an attempt to hybridize them,
but the experiment was not successful. However, prior to leaving
the Islands in April, 1939, Mr. Lack and his associates were success-
ful in procuring thirty-one live birds which he installed in cages
made of wooden boxes to which had been attached the usual
travelling wire fronts, the latter having been brought with him
from England.

tions. The birds had been collected at the end of the breeding
season, with the result that they began to moult heavily almost
as soon as they left the Islands, consequently they were in quite
poor condition by the time they reached Panama. A rough voyage
to that point plus unsuitable food made a bad matter worse. The
threat of war was a further complication, and Mr. Lack, deeming
it inadvisable to continue with the original plan, secured by cable
the Zoological Society's permission to turn the birds over to the
California Academy of Sciences at San Francisco. The Academy,
having no facilities for the caring of live birds, asked the writer if
he would accommodate them until such time as proper provision
could be made for their care.
Accordingly, the Finches arrived in San Francisco on 29th April,
1939, an d were immediately transported to Manor, Marin County,
which is north of San Francisco Bay. It is there that the aviaries,
housing the California native bird collection belonging to the
writer, are situated.
Because of their condition the birds were not released in the
aviaries but were transferred to roomy holding cages and placed
under artificial light. Before being released they were calipered
by Mr. Lack and Dr. Robert T. Orr, of the Academy, after which
they were banded (ringed) with special aluminium bands for
proper identification purposes.
There were four species of Geospiza represented in the original
thirty-one specimens, three magnirostris, four fortis, twelve fuliginosa,
and twelve scandens. However, one of the latter had died en route
so that but eleven scandens reached Manor.
In measuring and banding the birds it was noted that the
tongue was slightly bifid (i.e. " brushed "), and Mr. Lack, in
answer to queries by the writer, stated that these Finches had
been observed to eat soft fruit and buds growing on the Islands.
He was not certain that they sipped nectar but thought they might
have done so. With these facts in mind, the writer placed these
Finches on a Mellin's food, honey, milk and water mixture used
for other brush-tongued birds. A mixture of native California wild
seeds was also given them, plus sow thistle and dandelion flower
heads and leaves. Meal worms and an insectivorous mixture were
later added to the regimen of few individuals who were more or
less emaciated.

These birds arrived on the eve of the writer's departure on
a collecting trip to the Arizona desert, and their care was necessarily
delegated to others for a temporary period. When the writer
returned home three weeks later it was discovered that two of the
magnirostris and one of the fortis had crushed the aluminium bands
in their legs, and that in the case of the single female fortis blood
poison had set in which made amputation necessary. The other
bands were loosened and removed ; however, the damage was
done so far as fortis was concerned for, of the four species received,
this was the only one not successfully bred in subsequent months.
It was hoped that an expedition sent to the Galapagos Islands
by the Field Museum of Natural History of Chicago, in the early
part of 1941, would be successful in bringing back other living
specimens of fortis so that the females of this species might be
obtained, by exchange or otherwise, to replace the crippled female,
but that expedition had only indifferent success in the collection
of live specimens of these Finches.
The birds were kept in the holding cages at Manor until the
moult was completed and a proper food regimen could be worked
out. In the meantime plans were being made for the construction
of breeding pens at the Academy which is situated in Golden Gate
Park in San Francisco.
A major consideration for the selection of this particular scientific
institution as the one to which the collection should be entrusted
was that it had previously dispatched expeditions to the Galapagos
Islands, which expeditions had done a great deal of work along
the systematic line on the so-called Darwin's Finches. Because of
such previous activities, all members of the Academy staff were
keenly interested in what, for them, was a new and novel departure,
viz. the study of living , rather than the ordinary case specimens.
Dr. R. G. Miller, the Director of the Academy, James Mofhtt,
Curator of Mammalogy and Ornithology, and Dr. Robert T. Orr,
Assistant Curator, all participated in the several conferences held
for considering the proposed accommodations planned for the
breeding of these birds. It was the writer's thought, based on many
years of experience in the keeping and breeding of our native
California avifauna that the aviaries should be located behind
one of the Academy buildings, where natural and rather heavy
growth could be wired in, not alone for the nesting seclusion such

an environment would afford, but also to provide a possible small
supply of living insects which, it was supposed at the time, the
young would require for successful rearing. Certain objections
were made by the Academy officials to this proposed site in the
garden, principally because park personnel and visitors could not
very well be excluded from the grounds of the Academy and the
birds would suffer from lack of privacy. Therefore, it was finally
determined to build the pens on the roof of the west wing of the
Academy and subsequent evidence demonstrated the wisdom of
this choice, notwithstanding the writer's original scepticism as to
the ultimate success of breeding operations there. The work was
completed in early November and the birds were released in the
aviaries on 16th November, 1939.
The aviaries were ten in number of a size 10 ft. long, 7 ft. high,
and 4 ft. wide. The accompanying illustrations show the details
of their construction. They face south-east and are protected from
the strong prevailing north-west winds which usually blow in from
the Pacific Ocean which is some 3 miles distant. A maximum of
sun is therefore provided. However, it should be emphasized that
the close proximity to the ocean creates a good deal of fog both
morning and evening, thus approximating the weather conditions
of the Galapagos. It is the writer's thought that this proximate
climatic paralleling of the original habitat exerted considerable
influence in the successful breeding experiments which followed.
It will be noted from the illustration that part of each aviary
was enclosed in the usual orthodox fashion, also that a covered
perch was installed in each of the pens just outside the shelters.
The cages, being built on a gravelled roof, suggested the advisability
of using the same type of gravel in the flights, and this was done.
Gut brush was placed in each of the shelters and small wooden
gabled-roofed feeding trays, open only in front and of an approxi-
mate size of 1 ft. by 1 ft. by 1 ft., were attached to the front walls.
Most of the food was placed in these receptacles ; however, some has
been fed on the gravel floor in good weather.
Prior to their release in the pens, the birds had been taken over
to the Academy from Manor and were there held for several weeks,
which afforded an opportunity for those at the Academy to learn
the routine of their care. As previously mentioned, one of the
fortis succumbed at Manor from the effect of the band crushing.

Subsequently, one fuliginosa and one scandens died from natural
causes prior to their release in the pens. Thus twenty-seven birds
were originally placed in the aviaries. There were five more
casualties during the first few weeks after their release and, in the
writer's opinion, these losses were clearly attributable to the abrupt
change from inside holding cages to outside aviaries, particularly
at the very start of our winter and the approaching proximity of
the birds' normal mating season. Of these casualties, two were
fortis , two fuliginosa, and one scandens. It is interesting to note that
there was only one death (a scandens) of the remaining twenty-two
adults during the succeeding year, viz. 1940. In the same year
another scandens escaped accidentally. Late in 1941, one other
scandens died from natural causes, and in 1942 two more died ;
one fuliginosa also succumbed. Thus of the thirty original birds
received at Manor, there are still living on this 24th day of June,
1942, three magnirostris (casualties none), one fortis (casualties
three), nine fuliginosa (casualties three), and seven scandens (casualties
four). Of the original adults still living nine (one magnirostris ,
six fuliginosa , one scandens) were sent to the Zoological Society of
New York in February, 1942, in order to afford additional room
at the Academy for further breeding experiments which con-
templates utilizing young reared in San Francisco since 1939.
At this point a description of these ground Finches is in order.
The colour of all four species is almost exactly the same, but varies
in the sexes.
Adult Male. --Uniform black except that the under tail coverts
are more or less broadly margined with white or pale buff.
Adult Female. --Dusky appearing, more or less mottled or streaked
below, under tail coverts and centre of abdomen being dingy white.
Feathers on breast and sides with blackish streaks, feathers on
upper parts generally black or dusky centred. Colour of bill :
black during breeding season, pinkish-yellow during balance of
year ; however, this characteristic is extremely variable in captive
specimens. Feet blackish, tails proportionately short. Magnirostris
is about the size of a Grosbeak and is the largest and largest billed
of the four species. Its bill greatly resembles that of the Grosbeak,
being large and " gross ". Fortis is the next largest and largest
billed, and is about the size of an English Sparrow ; a veritable
smaller edition of the larger magnirostris. Fuliginosa , the smallest

of the Geospizids, is about the size of a Junco and is a vest pocket
edition of its larger relative. Scandens is also about English Sparrow
size, but the bill is considerably longer and not so thick, pro-
portionately, as that of the other species.
It will, of course, be understood that the normal breeding season
of these equatorial Finches ranges from mid December to April,
and it would appear it is correlated with the rainy season for,
according to David Lack, it is sometimes extended into June or
even later when the precipitation is exceptionally prolonged.
The San Francisco birds, like other species brought up from south
of the equator, immediately adapted themselves to the seasons
here in California and bred roughly from March to November ;
indeed in some instances there was evidence of nesting activity
extending throughout the entire year. One of the fuliginosa laid
eggs during every one of eight consecutive months, at the end of
which time nesting material was removed from the aviary. Her
record was ten clutches with a total of thirty-one eggs.
But little aggressiveness was noticed as between individuals
of the same or different species when kept together in the same cage.
A pair of magnirostris kept in the same cage with an adult male
scandens built nests, laid and incubated eggs, and hatched young
with only inconsequential sparring between the two males. It was
quite apparent that aggressiveness varied more or less with different
individuals, both within a species and with the different species.
This lack of uniformity in the breeding behaviour pattern may
have been influenced, at least in part, by the comparative small
areas of the breeding pens ; that is to say, that breeding males
in adjoining pens were often necessarily in closer proximity to
each other than would have obtained in their natural state, thus
tending to break down, or at least constrict, possible normal
aggressive characteristics.
They were found, however, to be quite inquisitive, carefully
examining new birds or objects placed in the pen. They also
exhibited a degree of tameness not found in most other birds.
Mr. Lack, however, told the writer that he had not found them
as tame in their natural habitat as they were reputed to be and
not at all comparable, in this respect, with certain other Galapagian
species, viz. Mocking Birds and particularly Vermilion Flycatchers,
which apparently had almost no fear of humans ! However,
</bodyText>

E. C. KINSEY-BREEDING GALAPAGOS FINCHES IN CALIFORNIA 1 3 1
because of this comparative tameness every care must be taken in
entering or leaving the pens of these Finches if escapes are to be
avoided.
As the breeding season approaches, the males evidence the fact,
first by increased song, then in the usual sparring and driving so
well known to aviculturalists, and finally by the carrying of nesting
materials. Posturing and displaying on the part of the male tends
to increase while the nest is being built. In connection with the
song of the Geospizids, it was noted that individual differences
between the males of the same species were much greater than
between males of different species. No two males of the same
species appeared to have identical songs. All songs consisted,
mostly, of a series of rather unmusical notes made up of one, two,
or three syllables joined together and repeated either slowly or
rapidly, but always shrilly. Additionally there were single call-
notes given. It was further noted that rain acted as a stimulus to
song, a phenomena noted many times previously by aviculturalists
as being applicable to species coming from the tropics where
rainfall is of frequent occurrence.
The male frequently builds one or more nests prior to any
sign of similar activity on the part of the female. Nests are
occasionally torn down and are transferred to other locations ;
again, completely new nests are built. Females, in breeding con-
dition, may accept one of the nests the male has already completed,
adding to it a bit or may start construction of an entirely new nest.
Both sexes work on the nest that is to be used but usually the
majority of the work of such nest is done by the female, notwith-
standing the fact that the male almost continuously carries material
in his bill, at the same time posturing and singing. The material
supplied them for nesting was dry grass, rope fibre, sisal hemp,
and old nests of local birds. The nests were usually cup-shaped
and domed over, the entrance hole being on the side ; however,
numerous modifications with respect to shape and construction
occurred, as for instance nests which were completely uncovered,
or only half covered. Again two, instead of one, entrances were
noted.
Nests are normally built by these Finches on the ends of very
fine branches of bushes and trees 4 or 5 feet above the ground
and are composed of long grasses and lichens similar to those

that hang from oak trees. However, in the pens, nests were built
at any and every height and in almost all locations. Most of them
were lodged in crotches of the cut bushes placed in the shelters,
and were, of course, composed of the materials previously mentioned
as having been given to the birds.
During the breeding and nest building periods, numerous
experiments were made with the use of mirrors and mounts in
order to obtain as complete a behaviour pattern as possible of all
four species of these Finches. The results from these experiments,
while extremely interesting to scientific ornithologists, are deemed
by the writer to be without the scope of this paper. However, it
may be said in passing that no differences were apparent in the
manner of posturing and display as between any of the three species
subjected to these observations, viz. magnirostris , fuliginosa, and
scandens ; experiments of this nature with fortis were not possible,
the single crippled female of that species having died right after
its transfer to the aviary. An attempt made to breed the sur-
viving male forth to a female magnirostris failed, and although the
male forth regularly sang, no sexual display was observed.
Pair formation was usually rapid as soon as the female arrived
in breeding condition. In some instances individuals that were
strangers to each other copulated within a few seconds after being
placed together and almost immediately thereafter co-operated
in the construction of a nest, with eggs being laid in a few days.
Of course there were cases in which either the male or female of
a species was late in reaching an advanced sexual condition and
in those instances maladjustments were evident.
The number of eggs laid varied from one to five, with three or
four representing the usual clutch. Coloration is the same for all
species, being white speckled with brown. The size varies, being
proportionate and relative to the size of the individual species.
Eggs are laid on succeeding days with incubation starting upon
the deposit of the last egg. The period of incubation was determined
to run from eleven to thirteen days with twelve days the usual rule.
The foregoing variation is not a specific difference, as the extremes
applied to all species.
Courtship feeding, a regular occurrence in these Finches,
consists, as a general rule, of the male feeding the female by
regurgitation. A continuity of such feeding varies both within the

species and between the species. It usually begins a few days prior
to the first egg being deposited and may or may not continue until
after the young are out of the nest unless, of course, another set of
eggs is laid when it may continue on without interruption. The
usual procedure of the females fluttering their wings, as would
young birds, occurs during the process.
After the young are hatched they are fed by both the male and
female and this continues until the nestlings are ready to fly, when
the male, as a general rule, assumes the full burden. However,
there are exceptions, for it was noted that in some cases the female
continued to do a certain amount of feeding even while she was
incubating a new clutch of eggs. There were other instances where
the males attacked the young after they had left the nests, but before
they were capable of feeding themselves, and it was found necessary
to confine the males in order to prevent injury to the young.
In those cases the female continued feeding the young. It was
observed that the captive young failed to develop as fast as young
in the wild, nor did they leave the nest as early. Further, they were
dependent for a longer period on their parents. This retarded
development may have resulted from diet and also may account
for the attacks by the male on newly fledged young, as such attacks
occurred at the time the fledgelings would normally attain indepen-
dence in their natural habitat, and as a consequence, be driven
from the nesting territory.
As has been the experience of most aviculturists in breeding
birds of other species, occasions occurred when males would kill
the young or would remove them from the nest as soon as they
hatched. Diet, again, is at least in part responsible for these attacks,
as has been demonstrated many times in the past. However, the
writer has long since noticed that native California species as, for
instance, Mountain and Western Bluebirds, Sialia currucoides and
S. mexicana occidentalism which have nested and successfully reared
their young each year for almost a decade in the aviaries at Manor
have, upon occasions, killed and removed the young immediately
after hatching, notwithstanding the fact that they were provided
with an ample supply of live insect food (grasshoppers, locusts, etc.,
a food normally used by them for rearing young in the wild), if
too much disturbed by other birds in the same aviary or by too
much human observation or interference. Also young pairs nesting

<bodyText confidence="0.999737128205128" page_id="56350586"  page_num="134" year="" vol="">
for the first time invariably did so. With Darwin's Finches it was
definitely noted that the habit ceased after two or three broods of
young were so destroyed, which tends to confirm the writer's
long held idea that nervousness, fright, or outside interference,
regardless of source, is as much, if not more, to blame for such
attacks than diet.
The appearance and development of the young are very much
like that of other Finches. A scanty amount of down first appeared, |
then feathering started at the age of four days. The eyes opened
at five days. The time of leaving the nest varied both with
individuals and by species, running from twelve to seventeen days.
They were fed after leaving the nest for from twelve to sixteen days
and longer if their parents could be induced to continue the task.
The writer gained the impression from Mr. Lack that the
Geospizids reared their young in their natural state on regurgitated
insects, at least during the callow period. And as a result, he was
not over optimistic as to the success of the breeding operations
which were to be attempted in San Francisco, unless an adequate
supply of live insects could somehow be obtained. This was one
of the reasons for his objections to the breeding pens being built
on the roof rather than on the Academy grounds where, as
previously mentioned, it was thought a small supply of insects
might be naturally afforded. Of course, it was assumed that the
usual mealworms and gentles might permit the successful rearing
of a few young. Prior to the breeding season, an arrangement
was made with a fish bait manufacturing company for the processing
of grasshoppers with glycerin ; just enough of the latter being used
to keep the insects, which had been previously dried, soft and
pliable. This particular food was offered to the adult birds, which
at first appeared frightened by the insects, but gradually learned
to eat them.
Much to the surprise and gratification of all concerned, it
was determined upon the hatching of the first nest of these ground
Finches, that they did not exclusively require live insect food with
which to rear young in captivity, indeed, they performed that
function admirably and in almost all cases on regurgitated seed !
Thus several nests of the three species of which there were breeding
pairs, viz. magnirostris, fuliginosa, and scandens, were reared without
the necessity of procuring live insects, and what a necessity that
</bodyText>
<bodyText confidence="0.997657" page_id="56350587"  page_num="135" year="" vol="">
E. G. KINSEY-BREEDING GALAPAGOS FINCHES IN CALIFORNIA 1 35
can be in the case of so many species of the Fringillida ! The same
mixture of wild California seeds, with a small addition of some
domestic seeds like canary, millet, etc., was used, plus the Mellin's
food mixture and the various greens previously mentioned.
It is probably true that the young of these Finches receive a
substantial portion of insect food in their wild state, and probably
the retarded development heretofore mentioned would not have
occurred in the captive young had an equivalent part of their diet
contained a higher protein content. It may be that the dried
grasshoppers supplied to their parents helped to balance their diet
and substantially contributed to their successful rearing.
During the year 1940 twenty-nine nestlings of all species were
hatched from fourteen broods, of which fifteen nestlings were reared
to maturity. Of four broods of magnirostris eleven nestlings hatched
of which five nestlings were reared ; from five broods of fuliginosa
there were nine nestlings hatched of which six nestlings were reared ;
of the scandens nine nestlings were hatched from five broods, of which
four nestlings were reared.
During the year 1941 breeding operations were temporarily
discontinued with fuliginosa and scandens , because of the overcrowded
condition of the ten pens. One pair of magnirostris built a nest and
laid a clutch of three eggs which hatched on 14th July. One
of the young was found dead the next day and the two others the
following day. In the same aviary was a scandens male, and although
no serious fighting was observed or any other interference on the
part of the scandens with nest building, it is entirely possible that its
presence caused the male magnirostris to kill the young after hatching.
As previously stated, nine of the original adult Finches were
sent to New York early this year (1942) in order to relieve the
congested condition of the aviaries. However, for some reason,
there has been but one nest built to date, viz. 24th June. This
nest was one of th z fuliginosa, and but one nestling hatched and it
only lived for seventeen days. It was deficient in feathering which
may have accounted for its short life.
It was found impossible to procure an additional supply of
dried grasshoppers this spring, and this may have some bearing
on the lack of success of breeding efforts in 1942 to date, and this,
notwithstanding the writer's scepticism as to the value of this
particular food for the purpose indicated. It is possible that our

extraordinarily late spring may also be responsible ; our native
species in the aviaries at Manor and those nesting in the mountains
of California were almost a month late in starting to pair this year.
Present breeding pairs for 1942 are : one pair old magnirostris ,
one pair young magnirostris ; one pair old fuliginosa, one pair of one
old and one young fuliginosa ; two pair old scandens, one pair of
young scandens. Additionally, there are a number of young
fuliginosa , magnirostris , and scandens which have not been put up
for breeding and, of course, there is still the one remaining old
male forth.
A staggering amount of detailed observations embracing
behaviourism, moults, and moult sequences, bill coloration, song
patterns, oological particulars, etc., all in addition to the more
or less general data covered in this paper, have been made by
Dr. Robert T. Orr, the Assistant Curator, who has borne the full
burden of the physical care, maintenance, and research in con-
nection with these Finches. Dr. Orr, with unusual courtesy,
permitted the writer to study his complete series of notes and MSS.
on these Finches and without this information, the present paper
could not have been written. This consideration was extended,
notwithstanding the fact that Dr. Orr will shortly publish a some-
what similar, but more detailed, paper for an American zoological
publication, and later, a completely scientific manuscript for the
more exact ornithological field.
Additionally, the David Lack manuscript, a minute and
detailed report of the Lack-Venables expedition and the work
of its members (both in the field and in museums) on the Geospizinae,
will shortly be issued by the California Academy of Sciences.
Here again is credit due Dr. Orr for the " drudgery 55 connected
with the proper preparation of this manuscript for publication
and the carrying on of an extended long range correspondence with
Mr. Lack entailed by such preparation.
The Socities which sponsored the expedition, those participating
in it and its chief beneficiary, Science, are under substantial
obligation to Dr. Orr for the tremendous amount of work he has
performed, and too much credit cannot be accorded him for the
extraordinarily fine results attained in the breeding operations
which he alone carried on with the living specimens brought back
by Mr. Lack.

With no previous experience in the caring for, or working with,
live birds and with the scientific ornithologist's usual antipathy
and distrustfulness of behaviour observations made on captive
specimens, he undertook and carried through to a remarkably
successful conclusion (with the sympathetic co-operation of Director
Miller and Curator Moffitt) a task which called for all the skill,
knowledge, and versatility of an experienced aviculturalist.
Because of the scepticism so consistently exhibited by pro-
fessional ornithologists as to the value of working with live birds,
it is not alone pertinent but of considerable significance to conclude
this paper with a quotation from Dr. Orr's manuscript on his
work with these Darwin Finches :--
" I may say that while many of us have been considerably
less interested in the behaviour of birds in captivity than in
the wilds, nevertheless, there is much information that can be
derived from such studies. Undoubtedly the out-of-door
laboratory is the ideal one for a study of normal avian behaviour.
It is surprising, however, how little difference there is in the
reactions and responses of these Geospizids in captivity to those
in the native state where corresponding types of observations
have been made. Furthermore, one is able to experiment with
captive individuals in a manner which is impossible in the
wild, but which likewise may throw more light on the funda-
mental factors producing the normal behaviour pattern than
would ever result from repeated observation on the normal
behaviour in the wild state."

By Noel Phipps, F.Z.S.
Most of my time since I arrived in South Africa in September,
1940, has been spent in Johannesburg, but even here I have seen
quite a number of birds to interest me. The Cape Sparrow or
" Mossie ", Passer melanurus , the cock a very handsome fellow with
black head, white crescent from eye to throat and reddish brown
back, is ubiquitous and a persistent nester like his English cousin ;
they build mainly in the oak trees which line most of the streets
in the suburbs--a large untidy nest of leaves and sticks. The Cape
Wagtail, Motacilla capensis , looks like an immature Pied Wagtail,
with grey replacing nearly all the black parts of the latter's
plumage ; it is a familiar sight in suburban gardens, as is also
the Laughing Dove, Stygmatopelia senegalensis aquatorialis , which has
pinkish brown head and breast and slate grey wings.
In this garden there is a mulberry tree and the huge juicy
mulberries attract the " Toppies ", Layard's Bulbul, the common
Bulbul, seen wherever there are fruit trees and gardens ; they sing
a good deal and have some lovely " liquid " notes. The Cape
Robin, Cossypha cqffra , is larger than the English Robin, but with
the same mannerisms and inquisitiveness ; has a white band over
the eye, rufous breast, grey below and rufous back and tail. It has
a lovely song. Another bird quite often seen even in gardens on a
big main road with noisy trams and a ceaseless stream of passing
cars, is the curious Mousebird or Coly ; a resident of South Africa
described them to me as " Parrots ", which of course is quite
incorrect, though they are not at all unlike Cockatiels in general
appearance but without the bright colouring. They have a very
" mousey " way of moving about a tree and they cling to a branch
with their " elbows " below their feet--a very curious habit. There
are three kinds, all very similar, the Cape, Speckled, and Red-
faced. They go about in parties of five or six and advertise their
presence by their clear whistled call. Their only foods are fruit and
berries and on account of the former predilection they are much
disliked by gardeners. In Natal I was walking quietly along a
narrow side road and looking up saw five in a little bush bare of
leaves, not four yards from me--they had spied me first and had a
comical air of trying not to appear nervous ; after a while four of

them flew off a little way, but the fifth stayed stubbornly to stare
me out of countenance so I countered by taking three snaps of him,
which unfortunately when printed did nothing more than show that
he was in the bush.
Early last June (midwinter here) I watched Malachite Sun-
birds catching flies, and on one occasion a large moth, on the wing
from the tops of oak trees in the gardens of St. John's College,
Johannesburg.
At Swartkopskloof on a hillside above Pietermaritzburg,
Natal, where the climate is warmer and more moist than in
Johannesburg and where flowering shrubs and particularly azaleas
flourish exceedingly, two other Sunbirds are very plentiful at
certain seasons. In October, November, and December, the Black
or Amethyst Sunbird, Chalcomitra amethystina , a noisy braggart
fellow who looks quite black until the sunlight reflects on the
metallic patches of green on the head and purple on the throat, is
very much in evidence on the glorious crimson hibiscus blooms and
in the blue-flowered Jacaranda trees. These and the Lesser
Double-collared Sunbird, Cinnyris chalybeus , with brilliant green
head and neck and scarlet breast, a jewel-like little bird of a quieter
disposition, are both very fond of the flowering eucalyptus or gum
trees.
The rogue, and I am afraid the scourge, of these lovely gardens
is the handsome black and white Fiscal Shrike, Lanins collaris,
commonly known as Jacky Hangman or just Jacky. He is a real
tyrant, " sees off" anybody smaller than himself, drives the other
fellow away from the bird bath, and is in short a regular bully. One
of the commonest sights when motoring or travelling by train is
that of Master Jacky perched in his characteristically proprietary
attitude on a telegraph wire. Another lovely Shrike but of a very
different disposition is the Bokmakiere, Telephorus zeylonus , back
olive green, throat yellow with a deep black band, and yellow
under-parts, and black and yellow tail. I watched a pair of these
in Natal in December feeding a practically fully grown young one.
They are very Thrush-like in their habit of landing on the lawn,
taking a quick run and pulling up short to look around ; and the
young one was also like a young Thrush in his way of standing
about rather foolishly waiting for food, and having no tail feathers.
These Shrikes have various lovely whistling calls.

N. PHIPPS-BIRD WATCHING IN SOUTH AFRICA
Soon after dawn every morning and just before sunset one is
sure to hear the loud, discordant and foolish-sounding cries of
four or five Hadadas or Green Ibis, Hagedashia hagedash (the name
Hadada is taken from their call note). They are large heavy winged
birds with no tails and long curved beaks, which roost and nest in
tall trees, and are always very noisy over their affairs, rather
like Rooks.
I have paid several visits to Blue Lagoon beyond Port Shepstone,
one of the tiny seaside places on the Natal South Coast, and it is
a real birdwatcher's paradise. Here the Brown-hooded King-
fisher, Halcyon albiventris ; red beak and brilliant blue on wings,
rump and tail, is almost a common bird, and like the Jacky loves
to sit on a telegraph wire from which he swoops down on a grass-
hopper or other insect in the grass below. This Kingfisher subsists
practically entirely on insects instead of fish. They have no fear
of man and a pair in the garden were very tame and made a lovely
colour picture perching on sprays of bougainvillea, then flying
leisurely a little further on if approached too closely ; if really
disturbed they fly off with a loud cackling call. Another King-
fisher very often seen in twos and threes along the banks of the
lagoon and on the sea shore is the Pied, Ceryle rudis , black and white
as the name implies ; they utter quite loud chattering calls while
flying. These are fish eaters. I watched a Half-collared Kingfisher,
Alcedo semitorquata, smaller than either of the preceding ones, with
a wonderful blue on head and back and a black bill, on a branch
overhanging the lagoon ; and one day when I was paddling down
the bed of a little stream in a thickly wooded valley, one of these
brilliant aquamarine blue jewels flew so fast and so close past me,
first up and then down the stream, that the flash of blue was all that
I could see. Another Kingfisher quite often seen and also a fish-
eater, but nearly always solitary, is the Giant Kingfisher, Megaceryle
maxima , a much larger bird ; length according to Dr. Roberts
seventeen to eighteen inches, slaty black with white throat and
under-parts and chestnut breast. Fond of perching on a rock just
as the tide recedes from it. I walked slowly and in full view up to
within twelve yards of one once before it flew away. I saw another
sitting unperturbed on a telegraph wire on the main South Coast
road as we drove past.
The scenery all along the South Coast from Durban is charming,

countless little bays, most of them with lovely sandy beaches, and
inland small hills and grassy valleys dotted with thick clumps of
bushes ; (this is the coastal belt in Natal and the climate is
practically tropical), the wild banana and various small palms are
abundant and arums, red-hot pokers, and blue agapanthus grow
wild. In any of the clumps of bushes or along the numerous streams
one may see lovely, and to English eyes, rare birds. I had great
pleasure in having a splendid view of a party of Black-collared
Barbets, Lybius torquatus, as I had kept a pair at home. They have
a heavy black beak, red face and neck, black collar and nape, light
yellow under-parts, dark wings and tail. Mine were sold to me as
rare unknown Barbets but they are plentiful out here, though
like most Barbets more often heard than seen. They sing loud duets,
answering one another so quickly that it sounds like one bird calling.
I also had two clear views of the lovely Red-fronted Tinker Bird
or Barbet, Pogoniulus pusillus, a most charming little bird ; quietly
popping about in a bush, and with his green black and red colouring
prettier than any picture.
On the beach the tiny White-fronted Sandplover, Charadrius
marginatus , rather a bad-tempered looking bird, runs very fast
feeding on the edge of the lagoons. Other Plovers seen inland
(though not in the coastal belt) in great numbers are the Crowned
Plover, Stephanibyx marginatus , and the Blacksmith, Hoplopterus
armatus, a stolidly handsome black and white bird.
Two interesting game birds (though now protected) seen fre-
quently while driving through the Transvaal and Orange Free
State when the veld was bare and parched with prolonged drought,
were the Blue Korhaan (pronounced Koran), Eupodotis ccsrulescens ,
and the White-quilled, Afrotis afroides ; these small Bustards have
big heads on long necks and stand high on their legs, giving them a
rather unfinished appearance ; the White-quilled has a particularly
harsh cracking call.
Several species of Starlings are very plentiful, particularly the
Red-winged, Onychoganthus morio, a dark coloured bird of a Black-
bird-like appearance, with the primary feathers of the wings rust
red. Pairs of these were nesting in holes high up in the rocky walls
of the Uvongo Gorge which opens into a deep lagoon. The Black-
bellied Glossy Starling, Lamprocolius coruscus is more Spreo-like in
shape.

The bird I have been most pleased to see is the African Jacana
or Lilytrotter, Actophilornis africanus , plumage bright chestnut, throat
white, black head and nape with a bare blue patch above the bill
--its toes are extremely long to enable it to walk on the weeds on the
surface of the water. I watched a pair and four young ones on a
pool and then running about on a sandbank on the edge of the river
at Scottburgh on the Natal South Coast. I had first seen them from
the train when I was on my way to stay at a place further along the
coast, and at the first opportunity I went back to see if I could
find them and was terribly pleased to see them on a pool ; I climbed
down the railway embankment and got quite close before they
flew off, and with the glasses I still had an excellent view of them.
I have been able to identify unfamiliar birds from two excellent
South African bird books-- A First Guide to South African Birds , by
Dr. Leonard Gill, and The Birds of South Africa , by Dr. Austin
Roberts, a much larger book. The scientific names are taken from
Dr. Gill's book. I may add that I have only mentioned birds
which I have been able to identify for certain.

THE RED-TAILED BABBLING-THRUSH

This is one of the most beautiful importations of the years just
previous to the war. The few pairs in this country were, I believe,
brought from Indo-China by Monsieur Delacour who discovered
this sub-species there in 1927. To my mind it is certainly the most
beautiful of the Babblers or the Timaliidre which comprises a large
family of birds of varying aspect and size, from that of a Wren to a
Jay. This family forms a useful repository to the scientific ornitholo-
gist who places in it any bird whose affinities he is not sure of.
The headquarters of the family is in the tropical regions of South-
East Asia, mainly the Malayan countries. Monsieur Delacour
records over 123 members of this family from Indo-China
alone !

belongs, is formed of the most typical babblers and are variously
known as Jay-Thrushes, Laughing-Thrushes, and Babbling-
Thrushes. They are restless and noisy birds, going about in small
bands and frequenting forested regions usually on mountains and
often at great heights. Most of these birds are sombrely coloured,
their plumage being various shades of brown, white, grey, and
black. But three species are of great beauty and are found on the
high mountains of the South China region. These are the Red-
winged Babbling-Thrush {Garrulax phcenicens ), the Elegant Babbling-
Thrush (G. formosus ), and the subject of these notes.
The size of an ordinary Thrush, the Red-tailed Babbler has
exactly the shape and demeanour of that well-known bird the Pekin
Robin. In colour the head and nape are rich chestnut, the ear-
coverts greyish-white, the rest of the body is a deep shade of greyish
olive brown, each feather having a darker edge giving the bird
a scaled appearance, the wings and tail are a translucent glossy
crimson of unusual brilliance. When they first came to me the
birds' wings and tail had none of the brilliance which they later
assumed after living two summers in a large outdoor aviary and
feeding mainly on live food such as fresh ant eggs, gentles, meal-
worms, and cockroaches. They also eat a large amount of fruit
and berries, especially apple.
Like the rest of the Babblers the birds are excessively active,
moving about with the bounding leaps so characteristic of the
family. Owing to this they are very unsuitable for cage life and
require a fair-sized aviary. They look extremely beautiful when
hunting about clumps of bamboo or rooting about in the dead
leaves at the base of these plants.
Though the birds come from regions where it must certainly
be very cold in the winter (from near the summits of high
mountains) I have not risked leaving them out of doors altogether ;
they are fastened in a heated shelter every night during the cold
weather.
In moments between their restless activity the birds sit pressed
close together preening each other's feathers, when for no apparent
reason one will suddenly jump over the other's back and snuggle
down on the other side.
They are extremely wasteful in their feeding, scattering the food
all over the place a few minutes after it has been put in the aviary :

nothing seems to remedy this for if the food is put in too deep a pot
they refuse to eat it.
A great deal of their time is spent hopping about the ground
turning over dead leaves and rooting about looking for insects
in typical Babbler fashion. Last year the birds toyed with bits of
nesting material but no attempt was made at building. This year,
now that the birds are in better condition and in a larger aviary :
I hope they will do something, but I may not be as lucky with
live food as I was last year.
Not a great deal is written about the wild life of this Babbler.
The following is quoted from Monsieur Delacour's book on the
birds of French Indo-China : " Like the rest of its kind it is found
at high altitudes always above about 3,000 feet. Its voice is very
varied and often agreeable. We found this species in the mountains
of Tamdao in the centre of Tonkin, starting at about 3,000 feet. 55
A rather fuller account is found in Caldwell's South China Birds,
from which the following is an extract. " Recorded only at high
altitudes in mountains of Western Fukien. Restricted to the brushy
and wooded mountains of 5,000 or more feet. Our collectors
reported it rare below 6,000 feet in the high ranges of the mountains
along the province border. We have never located it at Cha-bang
or the high altitude region back of Yenping which is a rendezvous
for birds in the province. This beautiful Thrush is seemingly
restricted to a very limited area . . . the nest being composed of
sticks, weed stems, and leaves, and placed in a bush. Eggs, three
to four pale blue, some specimens inclined to have faint dusky hair
lines. Season, April and May. 55

After sending in my notes on Meyer's Sickle-bill Bird of Paradise
which appeared in the January-February, 1942, issue of the
Avicultural Magazine, I was most interested to read Mr. Lee
S. Crandall's account of the attempt made to breed by a pair of
this species kept at the Bronx Zoo, New York ; since then, due to
the great kindness of Mr. Crandall, I have been pleased to read
his notes of various forms of display made by these birds, which
are so well described in #o*l*gi ca (vol. xi, No. 7, 1932), also to
receive a plate and a description of the egg which was laid in
1941. Also owing to the kindness of another member who advised
me, I have obtained the fine volume of the Avicultural Magazine
for 1937, which contains several references to this species and a fine
coloured plate of a pair in the London Zoological Gardens. It is
therefore to be greatly regretted that, after having stimulated all
this interest in these remarkable birds, I have to report the demise
of my own, due to over fatness, brought about I presume by the
unnatural wartime diet which I have been forced to give all my
birds.
Strangely enough, other birds I have seem to do remarkably
well on makeshift diets, although I lost a very fine Hardwicke's
Fruitsucker and a Sacred Kingfisher. I think that the loss of these,
however, led me to experiment more widely in foods for the
remainder with the result that the ones which I have now are
keeping very fit. A Senegal Turacou I have, which I believe is an
entirely frugivorous and leaf-eating kind, has lived for months
without fresh fruit, but has had a small quantity of dried fruits,
in some cases soaked for some time before feeding, also bread and
milk, meal, with insectivorous food and boiled potato, carrot, and
rice. I do not think that the insectivorous food is touched except
that small particles of crissel may be picked out, also the meal is
left well alone ; but as he shares an aviary with a Mot-mot, one
takes what the other leaves, I suspect that the Turacou takes more
than his share of the Mot-mot's very meagre helping of raw beef
on such rare occasions as he gets any. The latter gets garden worms
and mealworms at rare intervals which help matters as the Turacou
will not touch these.

Others I have are an Amethyst Sunbird and a Yellow-winged
Sugar-bird, both males, which are really less trouble to keep than
any birds I have had over a period of over twenty years of foreigners.
They keep absolutely fit on a nectar diet, changed at times with
diluted Virol, together with as many small insects as possible ;
spiders, small flies, sprays of roses or honeysuckle covered in
aphids, or small fly being especially appreciated. With reference
to the Sunbird, I was very surprised recently to see this bird running
along the floor of its cage, seemingly as fast as a Wagtail runs,
which method of progression is entirely foreign to such species.
My observations have shown that the ground is shunned if possible,
but on such rare occasions as they do go down the usual procedure
is to hop, and very clumsily at that.
My oldest inhabitant, a Persian White-eared Bulbul, which
I have had for some ten years now, keeps in good form and sings
from dawn till dusk. He displays very frequently. I have often
wondered if other members of the Bulbul family do so ? The whole
of the body feathers are fluffed out into a round ball, from which
the wings are fully extended, the head and tail are held very low,
the latter spread fanwise, and the body is swayed slowly from side
to side, all the while a low song is warbled. This will sometimes
last for some three or four minutes.
In conclusion I would like to say how much I enjoyed reading
about the collection of rare Colombian birds brought to the Bronx
Zoo, recently described in the Avicultural Magazine. Hasten
the days when such may be possible in this country.

glancing up as we rode by, and making no effort to move.

" It was always noticeable how very much tamer birds and animals were
in the immediate neighbourhood of a monastery than elsewhere, for not even the
most hardened poacher would dream of taking life in such a place. These
Pheasants were the commonest of the larger birds in the Salween Valley, moving
about on the sides as many as sixty or seventy together and shouting loudly to each
other in the early morning from hill to hill. There were two distinct varieties,
the one almost pure white, like those we had seen above Zimda, the second a
pale grey with black tips to the wings and tail ; and between them were half-
breeds of every shade " (pp. 163-4).
" Then, just across the pass, we put up a covey of four rare and very large
Partridges, which had been resting in the snow ; and further down we saw thirty
more of the big Pheasants, mostly of the blue variety but with some half-breeds "

THE WATERFOWL NUMBER
</equation>
<bodyText confidence="0.937588588235294" page_id="56350599"  page_num="147" year="" vol="">
May I be allowed to congratulate you on the fine Waterfowl number of the
Avicultural Magazine just received over here. I have enjoyed reading it so
much and look forward to many more from the same source.
One of the articles that interested me particularly was that of Mr. Stevens
on rearing young Sea Duck. Having laboured over this tribe for several seasons
I found his discussion most helpful. My principal ambition at this point is to
get somehow, sometime, to Hooper Bay, Alaska, the only point on our continent
where Spectacled and Stiller's Eider breed. Think of the possibilities !
You will be* interested to know that at the moment I have a fine adult pair
of our Common Eider ( dresseri ) on my pond. They were picked up with a few
others and a pair of American Scoter last winter after a bad siege of oil along our
Cape Cod coast. Now they are completely free of oil and apparently perfectly
happy in their new surroundings.
I also enjoyed Dr. Berry's article on his hybrid Geese. It is certainly important,
as he points out, to emphasize that their resemblance to Canadas is purely
fortuitous, for hybridization among animals tends to result, not in the fixing of
characters but rather in an endless chance distribution of characters so that no
two of the resulting progeny ever exactly resemble each other. At present I have
an interesting pair of hybrid Mallard X Pintails on my pond. They are brother
and sister, are mated, and are the F 3 generation of the original cross. The female
has inherited the female Pintail character of dimorphism in size and is much
smaller than her brother although bigger than a normal Pintail. At the moment
she is brooding a potential F 4 of six eggs.
One other point anent Mr. Moody's article on Snow Geese. I am sure he
and others will be interested in knowing that the breeding ground of Ross' Goose,
as well as that of the Greater White-fronted or Gambel's Goose has been found.
Both species nest on the Perry River, which opens into Queen Maud Sound near
long. 102 0 W. on the northern coast of North America. An account of the finding
of the Ross' Goose nests is given by Mr. Taverner in the Canadian Field Naturalist ,
vol. liv, No. 9, for December, 1940.
With best wishes for continued success of the Magazine.

INTELLIGENCE OF A HAND-REARED CANARY
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.997656" page_id="56350600"  page_num="148" year="" vol="">
Being very interested in Mr. Carr's article on disadvantages and advantages
of hand-rearing birds, I thought it might interest Aviculturists to know of a
Canary I hand-reared last year. I took three young birds out of the nest as there
were five, and I brought them up. Two I gave to friends, one I kept. This bird is
one of the most intelligent birds I have ever known. We have in the house a lady
(Mrs. Lawson by name, she was bombed out of her house in London) who is
bedridden and quite unable to move, except her hands slightly. I thought she
might be amused to have this Canary, and gave it to her. She has it in her bed-
room in a cage, and lets it fly about the room every day for some hours. As soon
as it is let out, it immediately flies on to her hand, or shoulder, and remains there
for some time, quite fearless. It flies round the room, and then goes into the
maid's work basket, there it collects all sorts of things, such as cards with wool
or silk on them (used for mending) and flies across the room carrying them in its
beak, and deposits them in Mrs. Lawson's hand ; it does this time after time,
until it gets quite a collection. The other day I said to Mrs. Lawson I'll give
Jeannie (its name, but it should be Jim, as it is a cock and sings beautifully)
something to bring you now, and I put a Crane's feather, certainly twice as long
as Jeannie, in the basket. Next day I was sitting in the room and the little bird
struggled to get the feather out of the basket, succeeding, and carried it straight
to the bed, and put it in Mrs. Lawson's hand. It is very curious, it never takes
any of these treasures to anyone else but its mistress. The bird really doesn't care
for anyone else, and it is devoted to Mrs. Lawson. When she wants it to go back
to its cage she has the cage put on the bed, and tells it to go in, and it immediately
does. But if anyone else tries to put it in. No thank you. It will not go. I must
say I am very pleased to have given Mrs. Lawson so much pleasure in the little
creature, as it is an endless amusement to her. It always helps her with her meals,
when they are taken up. The curious thing is, that I, who brought it up, should
now never be taken any notice of, and all its affections bestowed on the invalid.

By G. D. Smith
It is now twenty years since I brought home my two Blue-
Fronted Amazon Parrots from Bahia Blanca, they had always
been in one cage, and it was quite a number of years later before
the hen started laying eggs, and not till then did we realize they
were a pair.
In 1939 I decided to set the hen on four eggs, she hatched two
chicks then, but after seven days the two chicks were destroyed by
one or both birds. I inquired the reason for this, and was told
to try separating the birds when the chicks were hatched.
The next year one chick was hatched, and I separated the birds ;
however, after fourteen days the chick died.
In 1941 I tried a new arrangement, using two cages, one for
the nest. I filled the cage bottom with sawdust instead of sand,
and set the hen on four eggs. The time of laying the eggs occurs at
beginning of June ; I set her on 18th June, and one chick was
hatched on 17th July ; this seems to be the period of incubation.
During the time of hatching the cock bird feeds the hen and, as
far as I have observed, she only comes off the eggs about once a
day. I left the other eggs in for a few days, and not being fertile
I took them out.
Both birds fed the young chick very attentively. The feeding
method seems very strange ; the parents take the youngster's
little head right inside the bill ; one would think they were going

to eat the little chick, but it is all very interesting. The hen sat
with her chick for four weeks ; during the first week the chick's
eyes were shut, it was on 25th July I noticed its eyes opening.
After the fourth week I went in one morning to find the chick
abandoned, and I could just see a twitch of its bill. I took it out,
and put it in front of the fire, gave it warm milk with a few drops
of whisky in it ; it recovered pretty well, and I hand-fed it that day.
The next morning I decided to try it back to its parents, which
I did, and they both went to it and fed it, and the hen sat with it.
As I thought all was to be well I left it.
However, unfortunately, the hen came off it during the night,
and I found it in the same state of weakness as the previous day.
I then resolved to do my best at hand feeding. I got a teapot nest,
lined it with flannel, and kept a hot water bottle under the nest
to keep it warm, and covered the chick with flannel. I used a glass
tube and a wooden plunger for the purpose of feeding it. I rolled
biscuits and mixed grated nuts, carrots, and chopped lettuce which
it seemed to enjoy, also heated milk and whisky, and to my great
encouragement it kept revived.
The fledging of the chick was a very slow progress, and it was
the end of September before it could fly. As it got older I fed it
with Spratts egg and biscuit food.
I can assure you it has been a great nature study watching and
feeding the young bird ; it was a hard task, but has been worth
all the care put on it.
The bird is now fourteen months old, and is a fine talker, and
when I am at home he is mostly out of his cage and on my shoulder.
We called him " Mickey " and he certainly knows his name. I must
say we get great amusement with him.
This year (1942) I had another chick hatched, but it died after
eighteen days. I might have been able to save it had I been at
home during the day, as the previous night it seemed quite bright
and squawking fairly loud ; however, better luck next year.

CARRYING ON

To begin with I wish to say at once that I should have hesitated
to try and scrape together any wartime bird news but for the
request of our highly efficient and most successful Editor.
Certainly, if anyone had asked me in September, 1939, if
I thought the Keston Foreign Bird Farm would still be in existence
in 1942 I should have replied very emphatically " No ! " Yet,
so far, we have somehow managed to carry on and, moreover,
many of the birds are still breeding, though heaven knows how
they rear any young ones on their wartime diet.
Also it is quite impossible to give them the attention they
had before the war, as every available spare shelter plus seed
huts, carpentering sheds, etc., have been converted to duck and
poultry keeping ; so that the foreign birds have to be attended to
in whatever spare time may be left over after one has finished coping
with 100 ducks--Runners and Campbells--and 600 chickens of all
ages. I find the ducks quaint, attractive, and most intelligent, but
the chickens . . . ! Foolish, they certainly are and what is more they
seem to become progressively sillier and sillier from the time they
leave babyhood behind until they finally achieve full adult lunacy !
Altogether they are a grim example of the horrible results, in
the way of depraved stupidity--which can follow too long and
intimate an association with Homo Sapiens.
However one must not be too hard on them as they certainly
do manage to produce eggs in spite of wartime feeding, which
consists mainly of boiled potatoes, scraps, and a noisome brew
known as " Town Waste "--the whole dried off with standard
dry mash, which resembles nothing so much as the sweepings from
a very dirty carpet.
At the beginning of the war when food difficulties were already
looming ahead we decided to part with many of our rarest Parra-
keets, among them Princess of Wales and Hooded which, incom-
parably lovely as they are, were--according to past experience---
unlikely to produce much in the way of young ones to compensate
for the precious food they would consume. I was heartbroken to
part with them and still miss the wild, excited, and rather foolish

cries of Princess of Wales, and the pert, aggressive " Ghissuk . . .
chillick " of Hooded.
Gradually, for one reason or another, we have parted with
Crimson Wings, Rock Peplars, Common Kings, Grey Parrots,
Leadbeater's Cockatoos, Black Cockatoos, Red-faced Lovebirds,
and Red-headed Parrot Finches. Actually the nucleus of all the
best breeders we have retained are in the nature of a sort of Noah's
Ark collection from which it would be possible for the farm once
more to be gradually built up if ever the waters subside and the
Dove appears with the Olive branch.
Of course food stocks are starting to run low, so whether the
Keston Foreign Bird Farm will end before the war or vice versa
is entirely in the lap of the Gods--of War.
The war has forced one to try some curious feeding experiments
in some of which readers may perhaps be interested.
Fortunately, when war broke out we had a good stock of all
seeds some of each kind of which we still possess, though we
naturally have to hoard them as a miser hoards his gold. Last
year we grew a fair amount of sunflower, though the wild birds--
chiefly Tits and Greenfinches--accounted for a good deal before it
ripened, and the remainder, when harvested, did not compare in
quality with the full heavy seeds one used to buy. Altogether
I don't consider trying to grow formerly imported birds' seeds
outdoors in this country on any large scale is a very worth-while
venture as they are only likely to ripen in summer of quite
exceptional heat, and these seem nowadays to be becoming more
and more few and far between.
Some time ago we managed to get hold of a quantity of
" blitzed " monkey nuts, and although I confess I rather turned
my nose up at them at the time, they have certainly proved to be
our chief standby.
I decided we could afford to go on giving seed to the Grass
Parrakeets--Splendids, Elegants, Bourke's, and Blue-wings, but
everything else had to be got on to blitzed monkey nuts, some of
which incidentally were survivors from the fire of London (toasted
pea nuts, in fact !) while others had clearly had a pretty good
soaking in sea water.
At first I could not get such birds as Stanley's Redr. ps,
etc., to treat them as food at all, but at last by dint of withholding

<bodyText confidence="0.99774776923077" page_id="56350613"  page_num="153" year="" vol="">
all other food they gradually started to eat them and now seem to
relish them. To begin with I gave them nuts and seed alternate
days, gradually increasing the intervals between the seed ration
until now they have four days of monkey nuts alternating with
one of seed and so on. Curiously enough this monotonous and,
I should have thought, very " unbalanced 55 diet seems to suit
most of the birds well enough with the sole exception of a Green-
winged King who certainly seems to miss a more varied menu,
particularly, no doubt, fruit of which he was formerly a large
consumer.
All the birds are able, of course, to have unlimited quantities
of spinach beet, and since many of them are successfully rearing
their young ones, I can only suppose this in some measure takes the
place of fruit. The monkey nuts are by no means finished with
when the Parrots and Parrakeets have had their fill. The residue
is removed every few days or so and then put through various
sieves. The largest portions are fed again to the Parrakeets, the
smaller ones to the Lovebirds and Budgerigars, and the fine powder
is mixed half-and-half with insectivorous food for the benefit of a
White-capped Redstart, the remainder of it being mixed into
the mash for the chicks and ducklings.
Incidentally this insectivorous mixture seems to suit my five-
year-old Redstart very well, and he has completely regained his
former vivacity and slimness of figure, partly, no doubt, because
he is forced to catch his own live food in the large planted aviary
in which he lives, and can no longer rely on mealworms, which
I can only afford to give him very sparingly in the hardest of
winter weather. In the same aviary are a pair of Rose-breasted
Grosbeaks and a cock Giant Whydah---just now very magnificent
with his long flowing tail. The two veterans of which I have written
before--Niltava and Many-coloured Parrakeet--succumbed, as
I had feared they would, in the winter of 1940.
Another Parrakeet food experiment was with mangold wurzels.
The day when I was cutting up some of these for the chickens it
suddenly struck me that being reddish coloured outside and white
within, the birds might mistake them for slices of ripe apple. In
this I was correct, for they all rushed eagerly, poor things, to what
they doubtless imagined was their first taste of a real apple for
years, only, in most cases, to turn away in disgust when they found

that the appearance belied the taste. However, I persevered, and
finally all the Parrakeets--and the Grosbeaks--came to relish
them, and it seemed to me that the limit of war-time incongruity
had been reached as I watched that exquisite gem, the Splendid
Grass Parrakeet, thoroughly enjoying about the coarsest of peace-
time cattle foods ! I have little doubt, though, that they were
good for them, and they were certainly invaluable during the
last winter when green food was practically unobtainable.
Amazons, Ringnecks, Kings, and many of the Broadtails grew
particularly fond of them, and I am only sorry that this being the
off-season I have none to give them now, though there is a nice
crop coming along in the garden.
So far this season a fine brood of four Mealy Rosellas and two
good broods of Stanleys and Bourkes are fledged, also Bengalese,
Common and Silver Zebra Finches, and the following have young
in the nest : Common Rosellas, more Stanleys, Common and
Yellow Redrumps, Budgerigars, Cockatiels, Splendid Grass
Parrakeets, Elegants, Roseate Cockatoos, Blue-fronted Amazon
Parrots, and Lutino Ringnecks.
We retain two or three pairs of most of the various Lovebirds,
including one of Blue Masked. Lovebirds have always been rather
late in going to nest with us, and this year--doubtless owing partly
to the very unstimulating nature of their food--they are being
slower than ever. Of our three pairs of Many-colours, one pair had
a clutch of eggs, all unfertile. Another pair had eight eggs which
were all on the point of hatching when the hen unaccountably
deserted them and unfortunately I had only an unmated hen
Redrump to put any of them under. Incidentally she has hatched
the four eggs I gave her, and seems to be going to rear the young
ones successfully. It is wonderful how hard a really efficient
breeding hen Parrakeet will often work to rear her brood single
handed. The hen Many-colour looks like laying again. The third
pair are young birds bred last year, and have not yet gone to nest.
A pair of young last year's Mealies hatched, but failed to rear
their brood. The parents of the young Lutino Ringneck are of
special interest, as they are both themselves Lutinos. The cock
was bred some years ago by the Duke of Bedford, while the hen was
bred here two years ago. When the cock became fully adult I was
rather surprised to find that he developed the characteristic pink

neck ring. Incidentally, this pair eat boiled potato, whereas a
pair of Lutino breds--model parents on pre-war feeding, refused
potato and let all their four young ones die. Nor can I persuade
Broadtails to eat it, though in their case they can apparently rear
their young ones without it.
I recently made a tour of inspection of all nest boxes, and found
that though the quantities of young ones is in most cases below
average, their quality remains--all things considered--remarkably
good. I did not, however, disturb the old pair of Amazons, but
they are eating more than usual, and I have heard the young in
the nest. A two-year-old pair are playing about, but I don't think
have any very serious nesting intentions.
I was most interested to read Miss Knobel's account in the
Avicultural Magazine of her young Amazon " Richard ",
which was bred here last year, and to hear from her since how
marvellously tame he has become and that he continues to add
to his already extensive vocabulary. The parent Amazons have
now altogether fully reared ten young ones at Keston, exclusive
of whatever number they may have in the nest at present.
It may be of interest to record that a Splendid Grass Parrakeet
was hatched and reared by Peach-faced Lovebirds last season.
The poor thing had a very chequered career, as the Lovebirds'
nest box being of course quite unsuitable, it kept on falling out,
and in the end, grew up on the floor of the run. Finally its foster
parents suddenly turned on it, but it was rescued in time, and has
become a very nice little hen, and is sitting on a clutch of eggs as
I write.
The hen King, who has always previous years played billiards
with her eggs on the floor of the shelter, has with true bird-like
perversity chosen this, of all seasons, to lay properly in a nest box
for the first time. She is mated to a cock Green-winged King.
That, I think, is all the birds we have left except a few Pheasants,
Golden and Amherst, and Ducks, Mandarin, Carolina, White-eyed
Pochard, and Versicolor Teal, which still inhabit the pond enclosure.
Of these, my favourite has always been the enchanting and friendly
little Teal.
Before concluding this Keston bulletin, I think it may be worth
recording one or two recent experiences with that most attractive of

in this part of Kent, but a pair have taken up residence at Bramble-
tye. In due course the parents were joined by a newly-fledged
family of four. As I stood watching these short-tailed youngsters
with their parents hopping excitedly about on the flagstones
surrounding a lily pool, I thought what a charming picture they
made, until it suddenly dawned on me that they had not flown
down merely for a drink, as I had supposed, but were systematically
picking out and eating all the water snails--in this case that
invaluable scavenger Phanorbis comeus, with which, only a few days
before, I had managed, after considerable difficulty to restock the
pond ! A few days later they turned their attention to some young
chicks, so now I fear the time has come when we shall have to turn
our attentions to them. Up to now I have done my best to try
and persuade myself that they were not wholly deserving of their
evil reputations, if only because they are so very beautiful--
particularly in flight--and because, too, they remind me so forcibly
every time they chatter and scold, of the magnificent pair of
Occipital Blue Pies which used to breed so successfully at Keston
just before the war.

MY CUBAN AMAZON
By John Yealland
I had not seen a Cuban Amazon (Amazona leucocephala) since

a good many years ago, and had begun to wonder if this bird,
once quite common in the wild state, had become rare on account
of human persecution, for otherwise it seems likely that so pretty
an Amazon would have been imported more often in the years
before the ban on the importation of Parrots.
Greene says : " These birds are also said by the same writer
(Dr. Grundlach) to be very destructive in gardens and orchards,
and particularly so in the case of the cocoa palm, of which they
nibble the central shoot, and thus destroy the tree."
One fears that these charges may be true and that this, one of
the most attractive of the smaller Amazons, may already have
become quite rare.
In 1934 a lady brought me a hen of this species asking if I could
find a home for it and thus I became the owner of what proved

to be a charming and affectionate bird. The bird had been brought
from Jamaica by its former owner who had, I think, partly hand-
reared it. Whether it had been taken from the nest in Jamaica
I could not discover : the species was formerly supposed to be
confined to the island of Cuba ; a rather similar bird, the White-
fronted Amazon (A. collarus ) being the Jamaican form.
After the curious manner of some Parrots my bird had an
intense dislike of women and, indeed, was not at all friendly with
men until she got to know them well : her former owner thought
the aversion due to the fact that a cook had thrown water at her
whenever she made a noise. Whatever the explanation, the Parrot
clearly regarded all women as cooks of the worst, or water-throwing
type, though she did not bear me the slightest ill-will for syringing
her with warm water which I did on numerous occasions.
The bird was a good talker, saying a number of words and
short sentences in a very good imitation of her former owner's
voice. She was evidently satisfied with her repertoire when she
came to me, for she did not learn another word afterwards, though,
as is usual with talking Parrots, a great many of the miscellaneous
noises she made were interpreted by people other than myself
as perfectly good and intelligible English.
When I received her she was suffering from frequent attacks
of a chronic form of catarrh which stubbornly resisted all the
attempts I made to cure it, but which finally yielded after a long
course of fresh air treatment, the attacks becoming less and less
severe and frequent, with none at all during the last two years of
the bird's life.
She had suffered from the catarrh for a long time before she
came into my possession, and judging from the fact that she did
not learn a single new expression during the eight years that I had
her, she must have received a vast number of fatuous inquiries
about the catarrh, for when so afflicted she would say in a voice
charged with gloom, " Got a cold, Polly ? "
Though the wings were perfect the bird was a poor flyer and
the longest flight she ever made was one of about fifty yards,
losing height all the time and ending in a somersault.
As part of the cure I used to put her in a tree on hot days
she did not much enjoy this, always hating to be left alone, but
she did not attempt to fly away. I found the bird very quiet in

the ordinary way, but when left alone she would utter a piercing
squawk, a sound she never made when in company.
She was extremely fond of raw carrot, fruit, and berries,
particularly blackberries, but would not touch bark or buds of
twigs or any green food.
Only this year she died from an affection of the liver--I think
a form of hepatitis in which there was a serous discharge into the
abdomen and an accumulation of a clear jelly-like discharge.
I have since seen the same thing in a Grey Parrot which,
however, showed totally different symptoms and was plump,
whereas the Amazon was very thin. No doubt the diet composed
almost entirely of sunflower seed on which I was latterly obliged
to feed her and the lack of fresh fruit in winter hastened the
disease.
I think she would have bred and it was a pity that I could
not get a mate for her, for it would have been interesting to try
to breed this very nice Amazon.

Although both the Peach-faced and Masked Lovebirds breed
with great readiness in captivity, and the latter at any rate
hybridizes freely with most other Lovebirds, I do not think these
two have hitherto been crossed, and Mr. W. J. C. Frost, who
saw my specimen a year ago or so, agreed with this opinion.
The specimen which furnishes the basis for the present account
was hatched in 1938. Although eggs had been laid on several
occasions before, no young had been hatched, and in the present
case only the one was produced. Nothing unusual occurred in
connection with nesting behaviour or incubation. Both parents
assisted in the arrangements, and the usual nest-box full of bark
chippings was collected ; the female carrying them in the feathers
of her rump. Other Masked Lovebirds lived in the same aviary
at the time, and there were also pairs of Blue-crowned and Ceylonese

I propose to give a full description of the hybrid bird, which
is a male, followed by a tabulated summary of its principal
characters compared with those of the two parental species.
On first leaving the nest the bird was fully feathered and in
good plumage. It was green for the most part, except on the face,
which was dusky, darker on the forehead and lores and fading-
through dove grey gradually into the green of the back of the head.
In size it was as large as its mother.
It assumed adult plumage in about six months. This plumage
is intermediate in most respects between that of the two parents,
but verging towards that of the Peach-faced rather than the
Masked.
The bill is yellowish at the base, but brick-red over the rest
of its extent, on both upper and lower mandibles. The cere is
dirty white. It is followed by a narrow zone of greyish feathers,
then by a boarder frontlet of bright salmon-coloured, almost
crimson feathers. The top and back of the head are green. Lores
and cheeks are a soft mole-grey, becoming pink towards the ear
coverts. The throat is bright pink, and this colour extends,
becoming somewhat paler, as far as the breast, but here the feathers
are yellow at the base and pink only at the tips, but as the tops
alone are exposed when the feathers are in situ , the pink appears
uniform. The abdomen and under tail coverts are bright grass
green. The green of the mantle, back and major part of the wings
is duller, more olive, as in the adult Peach-face, but it brightens
again towards the upper tail coverts. The latter with uropygium
is bright blue--cobalt feathers with ultramarine tips. The
rectrices are of great systematic importance. The central pair are
dull green with pale blue tips, the lateral ones have the usual
subterminal black band, which is a generic character, but it is here
broader and more complete than in A. roseicollis. Proximal to the
black band is a narrow zone of very dull green, whilst the basal
half of the feather is brick-red. The tips are pale blue, which
colour is more extensive on the ventral surface.
The wing has only a faint suspicion of a yellow edge. The
flight feathers have dull green outer webs and blackish inner webs.
Their edges are tinged with bluish underneath as in A. roseicollis.
This colour also affects the larger under primary coverts, as in
A. per sonata. The smaller under wing coverts are bright green.

It is manifest from the above table, that, although the hybrid
partakes of some of the characters of both its parents, it exhibits
in general a closer approach, both as regards size and coloration,
to its maternal parent (A. roseicollis) than to the Masked Lovebird.
It is to be hoped that further hybrids between these two species
will be produced and especially those wherein the parentage is
reversed. It will also be of interest to ascertain whether a second
filial generation will be a possibility.

The Blue Variety

from the old blue cock he had had for years and from this a
number of young (i.e. " blue-bred ") ; it was to one of these daughters
that the old bird was mated, and the result was two young, one
blue, one green, which I saw when about six months old : perfect
specimens. Two more young were hatched in the following year
( 1 935 ) ? but they died young. The breeder gave a full account in
A.M. 1934, 238, and in a previous year {1931, 331) he had described
success to that date--nine blue-bred young reared. In A.M.
1939, 397 5 Aline Ezra gave an account of the 1934 success ; the

handsomer than its parent, and there were also a number of blue-
breds in the aviaries.
RING-NECKED PARRAKEET (Nos. 383, 384), Psittacula
krameri (Scop).
Ps. k. krameri (late docilis V), the African race.
Ps. k. manillensis (.Fechst ). ( torquatus , authors ), the Indian
Ringneck.
The Indian bird has been frequently bred, the first success being
with Wigand in Germany according to Russ and Neunzig. In the
U.K. there have also been successes and here Porter, who reared
one young bird in 1900 and a second in 1901, appears to have been
the first (see A.M. viii, 46). Tavistock in B.N. igi8 , sog, reported
the rearing of two normally coloured young from a pair of which
the hen was a lutino, but it was not till 1931 that he actually bred
and reared two lutinos--good ones--from one of his pairs of
lutinos, and that the worst one. Ezra was also breeding lutinos by
this time, and I think his were the parents of Tavistock's ; in
A.M. iggi, 331, he reported that he had seven lutino-bred young
but all of them were apparently hens and most of them had laid--
the very opposite to what he found with his blue-bred birds, most
of which were apparently cocks. In A.M. ig3g, 401 , Aline Ezra
describes her father's lutino Ringnecks and tells us that the first
two were bred in 1934, and ten more were reared in the next two
years, as well as dozens of lutino-breds ; the lutinos may be con-
sidered fully established at Foxwarren.
The African Ringneck has only been occasionally bred, and the
few records are besides ancient and doubtful. Lauder and Brown
in the PARROT volume of the Naturalists&amp;apos; Miscellany , 1333, say
" Psittaculus torquatus of Senegal has been bred in Paris " and ex-
pressed the hope (not yet realized except in Budgerigars and Love-
birds) that soon it will be possible to supply plenty of cage-bred
Parrots. According to Tavistock Canon Dutton bred the African
bird " some years before the war " (? was this ever recorded.--E. H.).
The hybrid record given in Page's book, AFRICAN X INDIAN
RINGNECK, must also be mentioned here, though all I can find
in the way of a record is Page's note in B.N. 1911 ,123 , that " Cannon
Dutton had three young hatched, which look like being reared
There is nothing further as to whether they lived or not. This and
Tavistock's information very probably refer to the same event.

Butler {AGB 208), but they had been bred many years before in
France ; see De Brisay, Dans nos Volieres. In more recent times
they have been bred fairly often on both sides of the Atlantic.

crosses the reverse way are also on record, as well as that with the
male CRIMSON-WING.
CRIMSON-WING PARRAKEET (No. 391), Aprosmictus

Their breeding in France, by the Marquis de Brisay in 1880, and
by Delaurier a little later, is recorded in Bull. 1883, pp. 393, 689,
but according to Russ they have been bred still earlier by Seybold.
Neunzig {p. 738) says " breeding has often been successful both in
bird-rooms and large cages ". In Great Britain Morshead was the
first breeder in 1901 {see A.M. viii, 34, and AGB. ii, 210). Since then
there have been a good many other records of success.

CRIMSON-WING x BLACK-TAILED PARRAKEET.
Bred by Whitley in 1928, 19293 and 19303 and I think for years
after, but never recorded. Four young were the rule in all the
broods ; I saw the 1930 brood in the nest in May and one of them
was shown at the Crystal Palace in February, 1932 (A.N. 1932, 67).
CRIMSON-WING x SULA ISLAND KING PARRAKEET.
Bred by Tavistock in 1927, three young being reared--the first
and so far only record of this cross. See A.M. 192J, 239, and UOiseau,
1928, 38. One of the young hybrids was presented to the Zoo and
was still there in 1932 when I saw it, a strikingly handsome bird.
Another was exhibited at the January, 1930, Meeting of the B.O.C.
with the ALEXANDRA CRIMSON-WING hybrid also bred by
the same breeder ; both were males. In A.M. 1933, 228, Tavistock
reports the death of the old hen, the mother of these hybrids, which
he notes here were all unfertile ; he had had the old hen for more
than twenty years.
Hybrids are also on record with males of BARRABAND 5 S,
ALEXANDRA, and KING PARRAKEETS.
ALEXANDRA PARRAKEET (No. 390), Northipsitta alexandrae
(Gld).
First bred in the U.K. (or anywhere) by Astley in 1912 ; he was
awarded both the A.S. and the F.B.C. Medals, see A.M. (3), m, 243,
and B.JV. 1912, 243, 330. He continued to be successful in following
years (A.M. 1921, 139). A good many have been bred by others
since, mostly, I believe, from descendants of Astley's birds. For
instance, Tavistock bred them in 1918 (B.JV. 1918, soy), More
recently they were bred by Ezra in 1934, a brood of four from an
imported pair received the previous winter (A.M. 1932, 9) ; he
bred more in following years and had young home-bred birds to
dispose of. They have also been bred in Australia ; Cayley
(p. 138) gives several cases, 1921 onwards.

Tavistock in Cage-Birds , 15th August, 1925, reported the breeding
in his aviaries of this cross that season ; two young were hatched,
but one died soon after leaving the nest. The other was reared and
turned out a cock, though at first thought to be a hen. A first
(and so far the only) success ; the young bird was shown to the

the record (Rousse, 1880) given in Bull. 1880, 493, 730. Two British
records of success are Salter, 1905 ( A.M. 1906, 27) and Amsler,

THE STORY OF "SPINX"
By " Garrulax "
" Spinx's " early history, like that of many of our so-called
" best 55 families, had perhaps better be omitted from mention, but,

had she been alive to-day she would perhaps have remembered
hours of cramped existence in suitcases, in hat-boxes, in copious
pockets of mackintoshes, of journeys in aeroplanes, motor cars,
trains, ships, of days spent in stuffy ship's pantries, carpenters'
workshops, cabin wardrobes, etc. I'm sure they must have been
intolerable for her with the exception of frequent feeds of
" Granose " with milk and a little honey.
I might mention that " Spinx " was a female Yellow-tailed
Black Cockatoo (^anda funerea ), a great rarity in captivity even in
its own country of Australia. The bird must have been about two
months old when she came to me and was then about the size of a
Roseate Cockatoo, but rather bulkier. For the first two weeks she
throve apace, but at the beginning of the third week she seemed to
" go off", she only took a very little food and this was thrown up
again. For several days the bird made an almost continual retching
motion and I thought it might have swallowed something that had
stuck in its throat.
I had been feeding " Spinx " on a mixture of " Granose "
biscuits, crumbled into half a cup of liquid made with a desert-
spoon of sweetened condensed milk, a teaspoon of honey and hot
water, this was afterwards mixed with an equal quantity of boiled
ground maize. I rather think the honey affected the bird's bowels

or she may have got a slight chill, though I think this was hardly
possible as the weather was rather hot at the time.
Usually she would never eat her food cold, it had to be warmed
to a certain temperature before she would feed.
" Spinx " was fed three times a day, but this was only when
she thought fit and no amount of coaxing would induce her to
feed if she thought it was not the proper time.
When I went to feed her, she was usually asleep, lying full
length with her head in one corner of the box. Her awakening
was not at all in the usual bird manner, she would slowly open
her eyes, blink a little, yawn, stretch one wing and then the other
and after a time sit up. She would never feed as soon as she
awakened, it was only after about half an hour after she had looked
around, exercised her wings and got thoroughly awake that she
would take any food.
For a good many weeks " Spinx " rather restricted my activities,
having to make her food, feed her three times a day, and perform
quite a lengthy toilet on her, was a full time job and she took quite
as much looking after as a human baby.
As it was impossible to keep the bird at an hotel, a kind friend
who I had never met before I landed in Australia asked
me to stay with her for as long as I liked, such is colonial
hospitality !
" Spinx 55 was a very clean feeder, or perhaps I should say,
I was very careful how I fed her. I ahvays had a damp cloth to
wipe her beak and feathers as soon as the meal was over. Once
on a small coasting steamer, wishing to spend the day in the
" bush 55 with a friend, I asked the ship's carpenter if he would
feed her. When I got back I found there was more porridge on
the bird than in it ! This necessitated a very lengthy toilet, con-
sisting of both wet and dry cleaning, the feathers had to be washed
carefully with warm soapy water and cotton-wool and fine sand and
sawdust carefully shaken into them in order to enable the down to
dry quickly.
These Cockatoos are very heavily feathered about the beak,
the cheek feathers are lengthy and form into a semicircle and grow
forward completely hiding the beak. Unless one is very careful in
the feeding these feathers very quickly become messed up.
" Spinx " used to like her feathers cleaned and after a meal she

used to hold her head on one side so that she could receive my
attentions.
For the first few weeks the bird flourished apace and after a
fortnight had increased to about the size of a Lemon-crested
Cockatoo. She was a beautiful bird, glossy black in colour, a
large patch on the ear-coverts a pale lemon yellow ; the lower
breast feathers, the under tail coverts, the feathers on the shoulders
and under the wings edged with pale yellow ; the long tail feathers
for about three-quarters of their length were pale yellow spotted
with black, the rest black edged with yellow.
After a few weeks the friend who had given me the bird very
kindly went to a great deal of trouble and procured another bird
for me, this time a male. This was rare luck, having a true pair of
these magnificent birds.
Needless to say I was all agog when I received a telegram to say
that " Paul Robeson 55 was being sent by aeroplane and would
arrive next Monday. All arrangements for that date had to be
cancelled and I was at the Airways office in good time that day
waiting for my treasure.
I had a horrible sinking feeling when I saw that there was a
department of the Customs in the Airways office. I might mention
that all the Black Cockatoos are strictly protected in Australia,
and no one, other than Zoological Societies, is allowed to own them.
What if the Customs officials heard the bird and came over to
see what it was ?
The hours drifted by with no news of the aeroplane or the bird.
I waited with increasing impatience. What could have happened ?
The aeroplane had been delayed by bad weather in the mountains.
At last hours after the schedule it arrived.
What a noise from the parcels when they arrived in the office !
The whole staff and waiting clients looked up in amazement !
" Ah, young Galahs ? 59 said the manager. " Yes," I lied.
" Thought so, I'd know them anywhere," said he !
There was no Customs examination, Galahs are a pest anyway,
so say the Australians. " Paul " was protesting so loudly that he
wanted feeding, that a tram or a train ride back home was out of
the question, so I had to hail a taxi. " Ah, young Galahs ? " said
the taxi-man. " Are you taking them to sell ? " "Yes," I said
on the spur of the moment. " Well what about selling me one

now ? 55 ## Not just at the moment, they are too young now, 55
I said.
At last after an interminable journey, we arrived home and
on opening the box a very hungry and grubby bird loomed into
view. Talk about eating ! He must have been famished, for he
ate quite half a pint of the food.
## Paul 55 was most obviously a male, he had a much wider and
heavier beak than ## Spinx 55 . What luck this was. A true pair of
the rarest and finest of Australian Parrots. A bird so rarely seen
in captivity that only one Australian ## Zoo 5 5 possessed specimens,
and as far as I knew there was only one true pair in captivity in
Australia.
They were a delightful pair and were more like a couple of
children, and I grew as fond of them as if they had been. I am quite
sure they looked on me as their parent !
After a time I could see that the food was not suiting them and
I tried all kinds of alternatives but could find no real substitute
for the natural food of wood-boring grubs and the oily seeds of
certain Eucalyptus. At last I could see that they were gradually
dying. They threw up most of their food and became terribly thin,
and if one may express it in connection with a bird, hollow eyed.
They lingered on for many weeks in spite of everything I could
do for them. It was heartbreaking to see them thus. They lost
all interest in life and seemed to know that they were dying. I
could not bear to see them suffer any longer so I felt the best thing
to do was to put them out of their misery. A chemist friend let
me have some chloroform and this I soaked in cotton-wool and put
in their sleeping box one night.
I must confess that it was with a lump in my throat that I buried
the two very emaciated bodies in the morning for I have never
owned birds that I was more fond of than these two.
I think few if any of these birds have been reared to maturity.
Evidently they need some special food which cannot be substituted
by artifical means. Banksians are much easier to rear and the few
of those I saw in captivity were all hand-reared and most delightful
birds they were.

No other birds can make better pets than Parrots, or be more
intelligent. In the course of many years spent among birds, I have
had dozens of tame and amusing ones, but none has left me a more
vivid impression, nor more bitter regrets when it passed away,
than the very intelligent and most affectionate Red-headed Conure
(Aratinga rubrolarvato) which I had from 1922 to 1930.
The majority of tame mammals and birds which become
attached to their owners usually do so as a result of clever training,
petting, and offering of tempting food. But sometimes one meets
with a case of spontaneous attraction and no doubt this was the
case with my Conure.
In 1922 I received a consignment of birds from western South
America and this Parrakeet was in it--a biggish bird, bright grass
green, with scarlet head, bend of wings and thighs, a large white
beak and a white ring around the eye. The species is found from
Colombia to Peru. The bird, undoubtedly a male, was neither very
beautiful nor rare. It did not look wild. We had several more
interesting specimens to care for in the consignment, so we cut
the feathers on one of its wings so that he could not fly, and let
him out on some bushes along the balustrade of the terrace. He
stayed there, coming in to feed, and looking very happy.
I had noticed that the bird was tame and even rather aggressive,
but there were several other Parrakeets and small Parrots living
there under the same conditions and I paid little attention to him,
aside from giving him some tit-bits whenever I passed him on my
way. After a few months, his flight feathers had grown again and
he began to fly. No sooner could he move about with ease than
he unhesitatingly picked me out of all people at Cleres, following
me everywhere I went and settling on my shoulder as often as I
permitted.
There was no other reason but his own fancy for the Conure
to act in this way. I never gave him anything special to eat, except
a few breadcrumbs when I fed other birds in the park, and his
proper food was offered to him by keepers whom he never
particularly noticed. But, of his own choice, he had taken to my
person. Although devoted to me, he kept showing a hot and

<bodyText confidence="0.999357820512821" page_id="56350633"  page_num="173" year="" vol="">
impatient temper. When I tried to grab him or to chase him away,
he never hesitated to bite, but always lightly, never seriously enough
to hurt, at the same time expressing his anger by little cries and con-
tortions. With other people, it was a different story. He proved
quite ferocious, attacking savagely and fetching blood. He became
furious whenever anyone came close to me while he was sitting on
my shoulder.
One day, as I was walking in the park with friends, he appeared
flying high, stooped down and alighted on the shoulder of Prince
Paul Murat. At that time we were both much of the same build
and the Conure mistook him for me. My friend started calling
me and as soon as the bird heard his voice and discovered his
mistake, he bit the Prince on the neck as hard as he could, which
stopped all jokes about the shifting of his affection !
My Conure lived at Cleres for eight years at complete liberty,
summers and winters, flying all about the place. When I was at
home, no one else counted for him. Early in the morning, he was
watching for my appearance at a window of my bedroom and
followed me from room to room, from floor to floor, never coming
in, as he realized that he had not the right to enter the house.
As soon as I came out, he was on my shoulder and went everywhere
with me. When I was tired of carrying him, he would follow from
tree to tree. But if I went too far from the house--over a mile--
he would suddenly leave me and return quickly on the wing. He
hated being too far from his usual surroundings. He gave me every
proof of his affection, warbling at my ear, gently picking at my
neck, playing with my fingers and even offering me food, the
politest of all gestures in a Parrot. When I sat down, he would
first play on my knees, then cuddle himself in my arms and go to
sleep.
Every autumn and winter, during my long trips abroad, the
Conure would take again to an independent life ; he would some-
times come to Mr. Fooks or to some keeper and demonstrate to
them. But they were ignored as soon as I returned. Even after
a year's absence his feelings remained unaltered. As soon as I
landed from the car, he was there to welcome me home, showing
extreme pleasure and excitement.
Alas, during one of my long absences, in 1930, my Conure
died after a few days' illness, I was told. He might have been old,

By Frances E. Matthews
For some time I have carefully studied past numbers of the
Avicultural Magazine for information concerning the breeding of
these Parrakeets. They seemed to me very desirable birds, being
beautiful, graceful in flight, and not too easy to acquire.
Most of the Breeding Records seem to agree that these birds
though beautiful, are for many reasons very uncertain, and there-
fore disappointing. Yet I feel sure that there are some people
who could relate excellent results--but they do not trouble to
do so.
My experience of Turquoisines is insignificant, but for what it
is worth I give it. A very good looking pair came my way, and the
hen started to nest in June. She laid six eggs and brooded them
as though her life depended on it. But when no birds appeared
she sat on over the time considerably. Then I found two fully
hatched dead birds and another fertile egg. It did not seem to be
the fault of either parent. The birds had not lived.
Very soon another nest was started with fewer eggs. Two birds
were hatched. These grew splendidly and are now (September),
flying about everywhere and feeding themselves heartily. The hen
has insisted on starting another nest, though I have discouraged it.
This pair of Turquoisines seem to be very well matched--ideally
devoted to each other and to the young ones. No recommended
foods for the latter were necessary. The cock looked after them
too well, then they went straight and helped themselves at his table.
I think the young ones are cock and hen by size, etc. No red tab
has yet appeared on the larger bird. The birds have never lacked
seeding grass and multitudes of other wild seeding plants. Lettuce
has been ignored. They looked charming wandering about
amongst the " Poa Annua " with which the flight is planted.
The coloured illustration of a pair of Turquoisines in the
Avicultural Magazine is lacking in depth of colour, it also does

not showthe light or gold line which edges the primary wing feathers.
These birds are like their smallest relations, the Budgerigar, in their
steadiness and adaptable ways. They seem to know what you
want to do for them and to help you.
Many can record instances of the sagacity and resource shown
by Budgerigars.
At one time I reared a great many Budgerigars. They were
not brought indoors nor were especial efforts made to tame them.
One cock we called " Chappie " ; he had a family and a rather
feeble mate. Attending to inside cleaning of open shelter one day
one of the babies came on my arm. Chappie was at the end of the
flight. I called to him, " Oh, Chappie, come and feed the poor
baby ! " He flew straight to my arm and fed the baby. He
seemed so intelligent I thought I would try it again later on.
This time he was taking off to fly in another direction, but he turned
back and fed the baby on my shoulder where the little one had
now arrived.
My other interesting Budgerigar I sold to a lady ; some-time
afterwards I telephoned to know if he was satisfactory. She
exclaimed, " I would not part with Tommy for any money.
He is the father of the aviary, he settles all the quarrels ! 55 She then
mentioned " A nesting Budgie lost her mate. She had a family to

Cuckoo Problems. By E. C. Stuart Baker, C.I.E., O.B.E., F.L.S., M.B.O.U.,

In the volume of this Magazine for 1941 (page 28) we reviewed The Truth
about the Cuckoo , by Edgar Chance, a book containing many very valuable and
important observations and conclusions, but dealing only with the bird in these
islands, and a limited number of individuals. Now we have a book by one of
the leading ornithologists of the world who has not confined his studies to one
race of the Cuckoo or a limited number of specimens, but has studied the Cuckoos
of the world and so is able to present a picture from a very much wider angle
than has been done by any previous writer. No other has had such qualifications,
for his investigations cover a period of nearly seventy years, and his collection of
Cuckoos' eggs alone runs into some 6,000.
The Cuckoo is a bird that demonstrates evolution constantly proceeding.
In this country the variation in the colour of its eggs is less than it is farther to

the East. It would appear that the bird is a comparatively recent visitor to these
islands, having extended its range from the East, and here evolution, as it affects
the colour of the eggs, has not gone so far as it has there. It is necessary for the
survival of the species that its eggs should present sufficient similarity to those
of the birds in whose nests they are placed to prevent their detection and con-
sequent rejection or desertion, and the author brings much evidence to show
that rejection or desertion does take place here frequently, though the greater
the similarity between the eggs the lower is the percentage of desertions or rejec-
tions. In the East evolution has proceeded farther and the likeness of the Cuckoos'
eggs to those of the dupes is more marked. Darwin's Law of the Survival of the
Fittest as applied to the Cuckoo is in force, those that produce eggs that are
perfect in their likeness to the others in the nest being accepted while those that
are imperfect in this respect are likely to be detected and rejected to the detriment
of the species. Each hen Cuckoo victimizes one particular species or group of
species with similarly marked eggs and her eggs and those of her descendants tend
to become more and more like those of the victims. How far resemblance has
been achieved may be judged from the beautifully drawn coloured plates by
Miss Edna Bunyard.
The question as to how the egg is placed in the nest, which has for so long
puzzled naturalists, is dealt with very fully. There is plenty of evidence to prove
that it is actually laid direct into the nest when the position of this makes it possible,
though not in the same way as that adopted by most birds. The bird apparently
stands with her feet on either side of the nest while she lowers her body into a
suitable position to deposit the egg in the nest. But when this method is not
possible she can and does project the egg into the nest while holding on by her
feet to adjacent objects. There would seem to be still a third method used where
these two are not applicable, and that appears to be the one believed in for so
long by ornithologists, namely, by placing the egg in the nest by the bill.
These and other subjects connected with the life of this most interesting bird
are dealt with exhaustively by one who has probably studied the subject more
intensively than any other person.

Correction
May I be allowed before the incident is forgotten to correct my statement in
the May-June number of the Avicultural Magazine that Blue Snow Goose
chicks have lighter coloured heads and hind necks. This is incorrect, it being
overlooked at the time that these particulars were taken from a brood which
eventually proved to be hybrids.
Referring to the hybridization of Geese. We never encourage it, but have
found that certain species when kept in confined space and not strictly in pairs
have a tendency to hybridize. This season, owing to war conditions and the
reduction of certain males, we have no less than five distinct crosses at Lilford.
Four of which (male parent first) are Lesser Snow X Grey Lag, Lesser Snow X

Laura --A Hawkheaded Parrot

That Parrots delight in having their heads scratched is common knowledge,
but as far as I can learn, the Hawkhead is the only species which enjoys being
treated like a lap dog. My bird is never so happy as when she is allowed to lie
on my lap for a cuddle, and if permitted will spend a couple of hours in this
fashion with her head in my hand. She knows that her special time for this treat
is Sunday afternoon, and is not backward in voicing her displeasure if by Some
untoward chance I have to deprive her of it.
She has another peculiarity in that she insists on sleeping in a closed basket
like a kitten, only unfortunately she employs herself in biting her bedclothes and
the basket if she wakes before the usual time for getting up. Her cage stands in
the kitchen window, and she thoroughly enjoys sitting on the window sill and
" carrying on " with the tradesmen, but above all with the gardener for whom
she has a particular liking. Though she does not talk, she can perfectly make
herself understood and she rules the roost as far as the kitchen staff is concerned.
Unless the weather is really atrocious she expects to be carried into the garden to
her own special plum tree, where she amuses herself for an hour or more and then
she shouts to be brought indoors. If, however, the day is wet she demands her
special lilac tree for her bathroom, and climbs and rolls about among the wet
leaves until she is soaked. She cannot grasp why at this time of the year the lilac
should offer her nothing but bare twigs, and after exploring them she angrily
flounced down to the lawn where she could at least roll in the wet grass. One of
her self-imposed duties is to come with me to feed the poultry, particularly the
ducks. When the latter are happily feeding, Laura stalks them from behind and
runs at them with a loud shout. This never fails to scatter them in alarm, and
Laura chuckling delightedly follows up her advantage as fast as her short legs
will carry her.
She has real courage in danger. One day when she was on the lawn I was
upstairs, and happening to look out of the window was horrified to see her with
her crest up defiantly facing a large tom cat. Had she turned tail the cat would
have undoubtedly seized her, but he was perplexed by her fearlessness, and his
hesitation gave me time to rush to the rescue. Laura took the whole business
very calmly, but I think she was relieved to see me.

The Medal may be awarded at the discretion of the Committee to any
Member who shall succeed in breeding, in the United Kingdom, any species of
bird which shall not be known to have been previously bred in captivity in Great
Britain or Ireland. Any Member wishing to obtain the Medal must send a detailed
account for publication in the Magazine within about eight weeks from the date
of hatching of the young, and furnish such evidence of the facts as the Executive
Committee may require. The Medal will be awarded only in cases where the
young shall live to be old enough to feed themselves, and to be wholly independent
of their parents. No medal can be given for the breeding of hybrids, or of local
races or sub-species of species that have already been bred.
The account of the breeding must be reasonably full so as to afford
instruction to our Members, and must appear in the Avicultural Magazine
before it is published or notified elsewhere. It should describe the plumage of
the young, and be of value as a permanent record of the nesting and general habits of the
species. These points will have great weight when the question of awarding the
Medal is under consideration.
In every case the decision of the Committee shall be final.
The Medal will be forwarded to each Member as soon after it shall have
been awarded as possible.
The Medal is struck in bronze (but the Committee reserve the right to issue
it in silver in very special cases) and measures 2i inches in diameter. It bears on
the obverse a representation of two birds with a nest containing eggs, and the
words " The Avicultural Society--founded 1894 ". On the reverse is the following
inscription : " Awarded to [name of recipient ] for rearing the young of [name of
species ], a species not previously bred in captivity in the United Kingdom."
The Council may grant a special medal to any member who shall succeed
in breeding any species of bird that has not previously been bred in captivity in
Europe.

EDWARDS 5 PHEASANT
By J. Delacour
During an already long life devoted to a great extent to aviculture--
I started at 15--I have imported, either by myself or through private
collectors, a large number of species which had never before reached
Europe in the live state. Numerous birds, among them, have been
established and bred successfully in captivity since, particularly
j game birds and waterfowl, but perhaps none has been more satisfactory
than the lovely Pheasant figured here.
Up to 1924 Edwards' Pheasant was considered the rarest species
of the whole family. Four skins in the Paris Museum represented
the only specimens ever found so far. They had been collected in
Central Annam by Father Renauld, a French Missionary, and
described by Oustalet in 1890.
In 1923-4, on my first expedition to Indochina, I had made it
a special point to collect some of these birds alive and as a result
I brought home three pairs as well as several odd cocks, which I later
presented to the principal zoos of Europe and America. Incidentally,
one of them is still alive at the Philadelphia Zoo, while the specimen
I gave to the New York Zoological Park died only quite recently.
The three pairs kept at Cleres nested in 1925, eight young being
reared that year. Ever since they have bred regularly, and have been
distributed all over the world, only a few pairs, which I imported
later on, providing a change of blood. The species proved so prolific
and hardy that it is now quite widespread in American aviaries, as
it was in Europe at the beginning of this war. It is gratifying to note
this happy state of affairs, as Edwards' Pheasant is a very rare bird
in its restricted native area. It only occurs on the damp, heavily
forested eastern slopes of the mountains in Central Annam, and its
whole range does not extend over more than 200 miles in length and
40 miles in width.
As shown on the accompanying plate the Edwards' Pheasant is
a very pretty bird, of an unusually small size, hardly exceeding that
of the Golden. Contrary to all other Kalijs, to which it is closely
related, the males take their bright plumage in their first year, and

the period of incubation of the eggs is only twenty-one days, instead
of twenty-five as with other species.
Its nearest relative is the still rarer Imperial Pheasant, which
I discovered just north of the range of Edwards'. Recently the Marquess
Hachisuka has created for these two birds the genus Delacourigallus
(J^oologica, vol. 26, part 18, 8th September, 1941), stressing the points
of resemblance and difference between them and Swinhoe's Pheasant
(Hierophasis) on one side, and Bulwer's Pheasant ( Lobiophasis ) on the
other.
It is greatly to be hoped that the war will not too greatly reduce
the breeding stock of this attractive and uncommon bird, which has
proved such a welcome and attractive acquisition of the last twenty
years.

A LITTLE MORE ABOUT LopJlOSpingUS pusillus, AND OTHERS
By H. G. Martin
I have a great partiality for this quaintly elegant little Finch, of
which quite a number came into the hands of several dealers in the
Spring of 1938, and at different times in that year I acquired four,
a cock and three hens. One only still survives in my small outdoor,
but suitably sheltered, lean-to aviary, where she has lived in the best
of health and plumage through the past three severe winters (not to
mention the concussion of all too many bombings and much gunfire
in the near--very near--neighbourhood) and where I believe the others
still would have been but for some of those unhappy accidents which
will happen, but which ought not to happen, to the careful aviculturist.
Firstly, one sad day in May, 1940, a little falling door failed to close,
unnoticed, alas, until too late, whereby several of my cherished South
American favourites took a doubtfully happy liberty; first and foremost
a very lovely White-capped Tanager. I learned later to my chagrin
that he lived about the district for at least a month or two and was
seen and marvelled at by not far distant residents, for he was very
tame and might easily have been trapped had I not given him
up in despair and annoyance at my negligence : but something
distracted me and when I returned none of the fugitives was to be
seen. One of the hen Black-crests and a fine male Pileated Finch,
her congener and near relative, were lost at the same time.
Disaster No. 2 was the introduction of a " Rock-Sparrow ",
purchased in pitiful shape, and out of pity, in a small bird-shop and
carefully nursed back to health and beauty in a cage, but which in
the aviary proved to be a very Hun, an assassin, a scalper of all and
sundry not stronger than himself, repaying the care bestowed on him

by ruthlessly braining one morning the gentle and unoffending male
Lophospingus. Beware of Sparrows and all their kind, with few
exceptions, say I, unless it be in company with more masterful species :
and yet in some ways they are very attractive. A pretty bird he was,
the scoundrel, with his warm browns, greys, and white, and his saucily
uplifted cap, always lively and repeating throughout the day his
two- or three-note song, if one can so call it, clear and loud, but
somewhat mournful. Authority suggested to me, not wholly for his
sins, to turn him loose, it being springtime and because furthermore
I believe that stragglers of his species have been met with in Britain.
But would he go away ? Not he ! Two mornings later his wistful call
was still sounding from some big trees near by and when I with my
wife paid a morning visit to the aviary down he came, sidling along
the garden fence and saying as plainly as small birds can say, " Oh !
do let me in." The way that intelligent scamp ranged over the
wiring in search of an entrance was really surprising, and, when at
length I opened a hinged emergency panel, in he popped at once,
to be eventually interned in solitary durance. Would that the White-
cap had felt like that ! Fortunately a friend later took a fancy to him
and (duly warned) bore him away--in a box on his bicycle.
Thus I lost my male Black-crest, and my hopes of breeding the
species, though the little hens went to nest in a chip fruit punnet--
an article which, half closed in with a patch of wire meshing or with
wood strips and tacked on to a small piece of board, makes a cheap
and acceptable nesting-place for many small birds, in default of
a natural one : when a bird really wants to build, a truly natural site
is by no means essential. The recognized clutch of two eggs only
was assiduously, if hopelessly, incubated and I am confident that in
a peaceful aviary, even quite small were it devoted to them alone,
these docile little birds would breed without difficulty ; perhaps
even without a regular supply of insect food, for they keep in perfect
health on nothing but dry seed, though having access to my one
remaining White-capped Tanager's bowl of egg and cake or biscuit
mixture, besides green food of some kind, lettuce, garden weeds, or
flowering grass. But insectivorous of course they largely are and keen
enough on the now priceless mealworm, smooth caterpillars, spiders,
or small moths. By way of experiment I fastened up in the aviary
a small container of perforated zinc enclosing a piece of sponge soaked
in a mixture such as the zealous entomologist uses for " sugaring "
elusive Noctuce, in the hopes that this would attract minor moths and
other insects. But I do not think it was a great success, possibly
because flying night creatures did not freely pass through small wire
meshing.
Speaking of this bird's food I might mention that I lost my second
hen through, I fear, a temporary war-time impossibility of obtaining

H. G. MARTIN-THE BLACK-CRESTED FINCH
a supply of either millet or canary seed, for I found her dead one
morning, apparently through eating something unsuitable. Why
don't we grow some at least of our canary seed here in England ?
I have tried this year experimentally and obtained quite a fair yield,
some thirty seeds or more from each 68 ear ", and, unlike millet, it
seems to mature quite well.
But to revert to the natural history of Lophospingus : On the occasion
of the Ornithological Congress over in France in May, 1938, which
it was my good fortune to attend, I had the pleasure of making the
acquaintance of the delegate from Uruguay, my home for many years,
Professor A. Teisseire, with whom I have since corresponded
occasionally. At the time I had the idea that this bird was quite
a new discovery, hitherto unknown to the dealer fraternity over here
at least, and perhaps this latter impression was correct : much
interested in it, it thus occurred to me to inquire of this friend, in
view of his scientific relations out there, whether he could procure
me any local data as to its habitat and habits. Not specializing himself
in ornithology he kindly consulted a colleague, the Director of the
Natural History Museum at Montevideo, who was good enough to
write to me, sending me the information which I repeat below--and
which may be appreciated by those of our members who bought the
bird four years ago--about the " Gardenal de cabeza negra de la
Argentina y Paraguay ", as it is called by Argentine naturalists, the
" Cardenillo " of the Buenos Aires and Montevideo dealers. It will
be seen that it was named and described by BurmeiSter already in
i860.
From " El Hornero ", vol. /, B. Aires , igij-18 , quoting that naturalist's
Journal filr Ornithologie (dated in i860) which translated reads as
follows :--
Burmeister's Gubernatrix pusilla or Lophospingus pusillus
The bird is common in all the Northern Provinces and inhabits dry situations
amongst woods of sparse vegetation. Sometimes it seeks its food in the sandy soil
and this usually consists of small seeds. Also they are accustomed to flock together
in little bands, especially after the breeding season. They are sedentary and nest in
all the Provinces of the north-east of the country.
Mr. P. Girard says that the nest is hemispherical in form and that it is built upon
a cactus. Externally it is formed of lichens and spiders' webs interlaced with vegetable
fibres and finished internally with still finer tissues, hair and a few feathers. It measures
7 by 5 centimetres.
The eggs are of dark bluish white with a few specks of pale violet grey, larger
spots being met with at the obtuse end : they are produced in November and
December. (Early summer of course.)
The description of the egg does not tally greatly with either of
those given in the Avicultural Magazine in October, 1938, and
October, 1939, but egg coloration is a very variable thing, perhaps
partly affected by circumstances, and difficult to depict in words :
the eggs laid by my birds were rather like a Common Sparrow's,
with very small spots.

From Professor A. Wetmore&amp;apos;s " Observations on the Birds of Argentina ,

Lophospingus pusillus (Burmeister)

ber, 1920, I found a pair of these little Crested Finches feeding on the ground at the
border of a thicket of vinal (creeping vine) and secured a female. The birds flew
with quickly tilting flight, with a prominent display of the white tail markings. Near
Tapia, Tucuman, on nth April, 1921, I secured another near a large barranca
(ravine) in a tract of low brush grown with weeds, where it was on the ground with
a mixed flock of Brachyspiza and Saltatricula. The species has been recorded from
Cordoba, Tucuman, Salta, and Jujuy, so that its occurrence in Western Paraguay
is not astonishing. The female shows a black throat patch of irregular form and
smaller size than in the male. In the Ibis for 1880 a female taken in Tucuman by
Durnford is figured with the throat white.
The remark about an irregular throat patch in the female is not
perhaps well founded : could it have been an immature male ? I have
just looked once more at my remaining hen, which cannot be less than
four years old, and she is distinctly white beneath the mandible,
without any patch, but showing only a faint dark streak running
obliquely downwards from each corner of it and vaguely joining
below in a curve across the breast.
My male bird of unhappy memory, and which I tried in vain to
replace, had a clearly defined throat patch of smoke black, while
the other parts of his plumage which in the hen are of a blackish brown
were likewise of a full black. His slender wavy crest appeared longer
than in the female and of a decided black. The sexes seen together
can in fact not be confounded.
Last year I collected the tail feathers moulted by my last remaining
bird : it seems there are sixteen of them, six being broad, quite black
with bold graduating white markings at the end, and the rest narrow
and white down edge and sides. But curiously, and short of catching
the bird to examine it, I cannot put these together correctly, though
the effect when the tail is spread is striking. I wish I had kept the skin
of the one that died, in order to better study the plumage. Nature
made this little Finch dull and otherwise inconspicuous, like many
dwellers in arid places : what a pretty cage bird would it be did it
possess some of the vivid colouring of the larger Cardinals, to which
in my view it is closely akin, if not actually one of them.
Thus I now know with certainty where the Black-crests come from,
namely the hot, dry northern parts of Argentina and from Paraguay,
and likewise something of their way of life in the wild. Shall we ever
see them, and many others, over here again ? Not, I should think,
for some years to come, though I should always wish to possess a couple
so long as I may be able to keep a few selected pets of kinds, like
the White-caps, too, which seem particularly adapted to and happy
in captivity. But far be it from me to wish to see again too much
trading in beautiful foreign species, so many individuals of which
were formerly fated to die all too soon in our raw climate and in

fortune on the world, but one hopes that, when it is all over, lasting
good may come for mankind out of evil, and even also for the birds,
by continued restriction, as well as control, of importations, the
present cessation of which cannot but mean a kind of automatic
protection in their own country of many species which were being
too heavily exploited. As they say in South America, " No hay mal

Many members of the Society will be sorry to hear of the death
of a very old friend, my Garnet-throated Humming Bird (Eulampis
jugularis). I got this beautiful bird in October, 1934, when she was
an adult bird, and she died on the 1 ith November, 1942. Over eight
years is, I am sure, a record for a Humming Bird in captivity. Most
bird lovers have seen her at Foxwarren, and at shows where she
always won. She was kept in my bedroom, and was given her liberty
several times a day, when she flew about and only went back into her
cage when she had had enough. The food was always the same
mixture of Mellin's food, Nestle's milk, and honey, given fresh and
never allowed to remain in the cage to turn sour. She always loved
her bath, and jumped into it the moment it was put into her cage.
I never gave her any live food all the time she was with me, but some-
times she used to catch mosquitoes, when flying about the room, and
swallow them. She was never ill in her life, and every year moulted
out perfectly into her beautiful plumage. I shall miss her very much
as she was a great pet. Most Humming Birds are delightful to keep in
captivity, and I always found them most interesting and intelligent
and so easy to keep.
They must have a good deal of exercise, and should be kept very
clean, and the food should be given absolutely fresh, and never
allowed to become sour.
Another beautiful Humming Bird I was very fond of was a Water ton's
Wood Nymph (Thalurania watertoni ), which I kept in perfect health
for a long time, and only lost him by stupidly letting him out of a
window. This bird was the most fearless one I had ever kept, and used
to fly and skim over my bath when I was in it, and fly out again like
a Swallow. When let out of his cage he flew about at a terrific pace,
and rushed back into the cage without ever settling on anything in
the room. If I held his little bath in my hand he would at once fly
out of his cage, and wash himself in this without being the least bit
frightened. I could have cried when I let him out, and was very

My return from the Middle East to Australia, in 1942, was
interrupted by a sojourn of some three and a half months, from the
end of March to the middle of July, in Ceylon. During that time
I was stationed in Colombo, and apart from two brief trips to the
Galle district and two short spells up-country my observations on
bird life were practically all made in the Colombo area. Quite the
commonest bird in the vicinity of Colombo is the Ceylon House Crow
(Corvus splendens protegatus ) and one soon becomes accustomed to the
constant cawing which lasts through the hours of daylight, but which
at first is quite irritating by its persistency. About the time I left
Ceylon, fledgelings of this species were numerous. This bird seems
to be replaced away from the coastal areas by the Black Crow
(C. coronoides culminatus ), a larger bird without the grey markings of
the first-named species. Next to the Crow, probably the commonest
bird around Colombo and, indeed, in all parts of the Island that
I visited, is the Magpie Robin or Dyal Bird ( Copsychus saularis ceylonensis ),
a bird fairly well known in captivity in Europe, and possessing some
pretty notes. The females and young birds are grey and white, not
black and white like the males. Almost as frequently seen around
Colombo is the Black Robin ( Saxicoloides fulicata fulicata) , an attractive
and tame little bird. The cocks are a glistening black with rufous
undertail coverts and a patch of white on the wing which only shows
in flight, while the hens are brownish with the same rufous subcaudals.
The Common Babbler ( Turdoides griseus striatus ) is also a plentiful
bird around Colombo, is seen in small flocks, and is extremely noisy.
Ceylon possesses a number of species of Babblers, btit the only other
one I saw was the Scimitar Babbler ( Pomatorhinus horsjieldi melanurus),
of which I saw a small flock on a tea estate ; they reminded me very
much of our common Australian species to which they must be very
closely allied. The Indian Tailor Bird ( Orthotomus sutorius sutorius )
is common in the gardens around the town, and is easily identified
with its reddish cap and greenish back ; I was not lucky enough to
discover a nest. The Common Ceylon Myna (. Acridotheres tristis
melanosternus ) is plentiful, and is, I think, the same bird that has been
introduced into many parts of Australia. The only Bulbul that I

managed to identify was the Red-vented ( Molpastes haemorrhous t
haemorrhous) , they were fairly plentiful all around the town. I was
very struck by the Crow Pheasant or Jungle Crow ( Centropus sinensis
parroti), a large black bird with bright tan-coloured wings and a
brilliant red eye ; they are frequently seen in the gardens, and appear |
to be ground feeders. Far more often heard than seen is the Indian
Koel ( Eudynamys scolopaceus scolopaceus) , a Cuckoo which lays its eggs
in Crow's nests. The cocks are glossy black and the hens mottled
brown and white, and yet strangely enough the young resemble the
males. Common everywhere, particularly in the paddy fields, but
also in the vicinity of towns, is the lovely White-breasted Kingfisher
{Halcyon smyrnensis generosa) which has several loud notes. I saw this
bird emerging from nesting burrows on the roadsides on several
occasions. A closely allied, if not identical species, from Malaya has
been exhibited in the Adelaide Zoo. I only saw the Ceylon King-
fisher {Alcedo atthis taprobana) on two occasions. The Brahminy Kite
(.Haliastur indus indus) was the only bird of prey that I saw, a few were
always to be seen in the vicinity of Colombo harbour. On my last
morning in Ceylon I was lucky enough to see a fine specimen of the
Red-backed Woodpecker (. Brachypternus aurantius erythronotus) , I had
been told that they were not infrequently to be seen around Colombo.
I wonder if this species has ever been kept in captivity ? The Rose-
winged Parrakeet {Psittacula torquata) is frequently to be seen and
heard in the vicinity of the town, but I did not identify any of the
other members of this genus in the wild state, although I saw the Ceylon
Hanging Parrot ( Coryllis indicus) on several occasions. A few of them
were exhibited in the Zoo, but I was told that they were not very
long-lived in captivity. The only Swallow that I was able to identify
was the Ceylon Swallow {Hirundo daurica hyperythra ), very strikingly
marked with chestnut on the under parts. Sunbirds were not un-
common in the gardens around the town, but the only species I
identified with absolute certainty was the Purple-rumped {Cyrtostomus
zeylonicus) of which I got a very good look at a fine cock bird. I think
the above covers most of the birds seen in Colombo itself.
Commonly seen in the low-country is the White-vented Drongo
{Dicrurus caerulescens leucopygialis) a striking bird, easily identified by
its forked tail and almost always seen in pairs. I saw several examples
of the Ceylon Green Barbet ( Thereiceryx zeylonicus zeylonicus) in different
parts of the low country ; they have very loud, distinctive notes ;
I also saw a specimen of the little Crimson-breasted Barbet
{Xantholaema haemacephala indica ) in captivity. The commonest bird
of the paddy fields is the Indian Pond Heron {Ardeola grayii ), usually
called the " Paddy-bird I also saw some small white Egrets, but
I do not know the species. The White-breasted Waterhen {Amaurornis
phoenicura phoenicura ) is often to be seen in the neighbourhood of water,

and is an unusual-looking species. In the Galle district I saw quite a
number of Bee-eaters which I think were the Common Green Bee-
eater ( Merops orientalis orientolis). In the same area I also saw two
examples of the Indian Black-headed Oriole ( Oriolus luteolus luteolus),
a very striking black and yellow bird. Once again a Malayan bird
closely resembling this species has been exhibited in the Adelaide
Zoo. Other birds seen in this district and not elsewhere were the
Black-headed Cuckoo-Shrike ( Lalage skyesii) and the Spotted Dove
(Streptopelia chinensis ceylonensis ).
Now for birds seen only in the hill-country. On the golf links at
Nuwara Eliya I saw the Pied Bush Chat ( Saxicola caprata atrata ), an
attractive little bird which must be closely allied to the Stonechats,
which were plentiful in Palestine last January and February. In the
same locality I saw a number of examples of the Grey Tit ( Parus major
mahrattarum) , not very unlike the Great Tit of Europe. The Common
Pipit ( Anthus richardi rufulus) was also frequently to be seen there, and
I saw a single specimen of the Ceylon Blackbird ( Turdus merula
kinnisii). In the famous Peradeniya Botanical Gardens, near Kandy,
I caught a glimpse of the Paradise Flycatcher ( Tchitrea paradisi
paradisi) ; unfortunately it was almost dusk, and I was not lucky
enough to get a very good look at him. In the same place and also
elsewhere up-country I saw the Ceylon White-browed Fantail Fly-
catcher ( Rhipidura aureola compressirostris) , an attractive little bird
very like the Australian Willie Wagtail in habits and coloration.
The Large Ceylon White-eye ( #osterops ceylonensis) was fairly plentiful
on the tea estate near Talawakelle, where I spent a couple of days.
I have purposely left till the last the loveliest bird that I saw on the
Island. It is the Orange Minivet ( Pericrocotus speciosus jlammeus ) of
which I was lucky enough to see quite a number on the above-
mentioned estate. They were always in pairs or small family parties,
and the black and orange males and grey and yellow females and
young made a never-to-be-forgotten sight. I think they are one of
the most attractive birds I have ever seen. I wonder if they have often
been kept in captivity ?
Aviculture in Ceylon seems to be very limited. Dr. Osman Hill
has a fine collection of Parrots, Cockatoos, and Lorikeets, which I hope
he will some day describe for the Magazine in detail. Mr. Frank Loos,
of Colombo, has an interesting collection, and when I saw his birds
early in July, a young Madagascar Weaver had just left the nest.
I am wondering if this species has frequently been bred in captivity ?
I was told that a Mr. Wilson, who lives up-country, also has a nice
collection, but that appears to be about the lot. The Zoo, which is
about six miles out of Colombo, has some very interesting exhibits
which I have not space to describe, perhaps Dr. Hill or Miss Yvonne
Burn could be persuaded to describe the birds here for the Magazine ?

By D. H. S. Risden
My last article on Gold Coast birds dealt mainly with species with
which we are all familiar at home. The following notes concern the
less familiar kinds, in fact many of them have probably never been
imported except by the experts who bring home a few species at
a time for the aviculturist with a long purse.
I should add that I am now back in this country and these descrip-
tions are from my diary kept at the time and added to from memory.
The Fiscal Shrike was prominent everywhere. Its size and general
shape reminded me very strongly of a Scarlet Minevet. Its colouring
is mainly black above and white below with some white in the wings.
It has the large head, short wings, and long tail characteristic of
Minevets and its little short legs make it very awkward when on the
ground.
The sexes appeared to be identical, but the young in nest-feather
had the black areas replaced by grey. They always appeared in pairs
and seemed to spend their time sitting on prominent dead twigs or
telegraph wires whence they would pounce on grasshoppers which
were usually carried back to their perch before being eaten.
Although there are numerous species of Shrikes represented on the
Coast I never saw evidence of the English Butcher Bird's habit of
spiking their prey on thorns.
One of the finest singers was the Black-crowned Tchagra. This
again is a relative of the Shrikes and at first glance reminds one of
the English Butcher Bird with perhaps a shade longer beak. He has
a chestnut back and wings, pale grey underparts, and a black cap
with a black streak running through each eye. The song is a delight-
fully mellow whistle starting high up the scale and gradually descend-
ing. The bird is somewhat of a ventriloquist as I had often heard
this sweet song before and, although I knew the bird well by sight,
it was some time before I associated the two.
They were usually seen singly or in pairs about the gardens or in
the bush near by. Occasionally I saw presumably two cocks singing
at each other on the ground about one foot apart with bowed heads

and fanned out tails and slowly manoeuvring round each other.
It was then that the song sounded particularly fine.
West African Coucals were common, and either very tame or
simply too lazy to fly away until you were within a dozen yards of
them. Then all they did was to flap heavily into perhaps a low tree
or else land a little further off.
About 18 inches long including a rather long racket-shaped tail
they resemble a giant Shrike in general shape. Briefly their colouring
is chestnut back and wings, black head, pale grey underparts, and
black tail. Their local name of " Fool bird 55 seems to fit rather well
when you hear their call which is a sort of " Cuckoo " in about six
notes running down the scale.
Nearly all their time is spent on the ground, where they walk and
hop lazily about searching for grasshoppers and, no doubt, small
lizards, if they are ever quick enough to catch them. They were
always seen in pairs and were pretty evenly distributed about the
cultivated areas as well as the bush itself.
The so-called Rock Sparrow takes the place of the English House
Sparrow. I occasionally used to see an odd specimen among consign-
ments of imported Senegal Finches before the war, and often wondered
why anyone bothered to catch such an obviously sparrow-like bird
and send it to England.
Slightly slimmer and more elegant in build, it can best be described
as a House Sparrow with a plain grey head and no black bib. The
sexes are identical.
Some pairs lived up to their name as I did see them nesting in holes
and crannies in rocky cliffs here and there, but, with the advent of
the European bungalow I think they have changed their habits and
most of them prefer the asbestos or corrugated iron eaves of the white
man's house.
Their chirp is exactly like that of their English cousin and many
a morning was I woken up by their incessant squabbling outside my
window for corn scattered from the Parrots' cages. The young when
first fledged are coloured like their parents--perhaps a shade paler.
In this and the similarity between the sexes they differ from the
English bird.
One would naturally expect to see Vultures in the tropics, and I was
not disappointed. The species commonly seen was the Hooded--
a small kind as vultures go.
They haunted the vicinity of the cookhouses as well as the native
villages, ever on the lookout for something to eat. Being unmolested
even by the black people they allowed one to approach within a few
yards. I must confess, however, that I think they look their best at
a distance when soaring high over the town, swinging round and
round in huge circles with scarcely a wing beat against the blue sky.

12 D. H. S. RISDEN-FURTHER NOTES ON BIRDS SEEN ON GOLD COAST
For a few weeks I had under observation a pair of a larger species--
I think the Northern Lappet faced. These were flying to and from
a nest they had in a tall cottonwood tree ; but, after a time, they
ceased to appear although the nest remained. This was the only time
I saw a species other than the Hooded.
The Pied Crow really takes the place of the Carrion Crow in England.
Slightly larger than the Carrion he is much handsomer, being glossy
black with a pure white breast, the white spreading right round
his neck in a broad band. In every other respect he resembles the
Carrion Crow. He is nearly always seen in pairs and is always on the
look out for something edible, which may be anything from offal to
newly-hatched chickens.
Incidentally I never knew a Vulture attempt to catch a live chick.
Buff-backed Herons, locally known as " Tick Birds ", arrived on
the coast from the interior in November and stayed with us right j
through the dry season till April, when they all disappeared,
presumably for their breeding grounds.
They look just like the cattle Egrets, a flock of which used to be
at liberty at Whipsnade, being white with yellow beaks and black
legs. They derive their name from a faint pinkish buff shade which
can be seen on their backs when one is at close quarters.
They were quite tame and allowed one to approach within 20 feet
of them. They appeared to feed principally on grasshoppers which
they stalked through the rough grass, stopping dead still and " point-
ing " at their prey before seizing it. It was interesting to watch a
party of them stalking abreast, separated from each other by a yard
or so. It was obviously an organized " drive " and every time a
grasshopper was " put up 55 one member of the party was sure to
get it.
At night they liked to congregate at some pond or other where
they appeared to roost on the banks. I had always looked on these
birds as waders, but though I watched carefully I never saw them go
near water at any other time, nor did they ever wade or catch any
food from the water.
They are very graceful and elegant birds and should make delightful
aviary inmates.
Common West African Bee-eaters arrived in flocks in December and
stayed till April. They are about the size of the European species,
but their colouring struck me as not quite so brilliant. They were
chiefly seen on the roadway itself or the neighbouring telegraph wires
whence they hawked flies.
Why they should like to sit thus in the middle of the roadway was
a bit of a mystery as there did not appear to be any more insect life
there than in the surrounding bush, but I noticed exactly the same
habit at night with the Nightjars of which more anon. Possibly the

reflected heat from the road pleased them. When motoring they
could be seen for mile after mile flying up just ahead of one's front
wheels.
The Little Bee-eater, as its name implies, is a diminutive replica
of the one above, being about as big as a Spotted Flycatcher and
having the same habit of perching on some low twig whence it would
dart out, catch an insect, and return to the same perch.
Whereas the Common Bee-eater was seen in flocks all over the
roadways, the Little Bee-eater was usually in pairs and kept off the
beaten track.
I have never seen so many Nightjars as there are on the Coast.
There are several species, but I only saw the common one which is
identical with the British bird--perhaps a bit smaller. As previously
mentioned, they would sit all over the road at night, and when one
was driving their eyes would shine in the car lights like live coals.
They appeared to be dazzled by the head lamps (the black-out was
not so stringent there then as it is over here), and were in imminent
danger of being run down.
One night one got drawn in by the rush of air through the side
window and I was able to examine it at leisure before releasing it
and notice the beautiful large dark eyes and the enormous gape
surrounded with bristles.
The call note was exactly like the noise made by a stone when
bounced across the ice of a frozen pond.
The Garden Bulbul was well to the fore as a songster, but not a very
sweet one. A typical Bulbul in shape and size it is plain brown all over
with a slightly darker head. It has a habit of raising the head feathers
in the same way as a Chaffinch will, thus giving an impression of
a slight crest.
It has a cheery loud song, rather reminiscent of that of the Golden-
fronted Fruitsucker, and was the first bird one heard at dawn. These
birds were always seen singly or in pairs, usually searching the foliage
of shrubs for insects. They frequented the gardens and cultivated
districts. In fact I do not remember seeing one in the bush.
The Allied Hornbill was often seen in parties of three or four,
usually among the palm trees at the fringe of the bush. This is a
small species about the size of a Crow and is a typical Hornbill in
shape and colouring, being black and white with a large yellow beak.
They are shy birds and seldom allowed me to approach anywhere
near them. When flying across a clearing, one after another, as was
their habit, their flight appeared weak and slow like that of the
British Jay when it has to fly any distance.
These birds have a peculiar high pitched querulous call repeated
several times.
Yellow Wagtails appeared in December, but were not seen after

a month or so. I think they must have been on migration although
this part of West Africa is rather off the beaten track for migrants.
Pied Kingfishers were often seen wherever there was a sheet of
w r ater of any size. They preferred the lagoons near the sea and have
a novel way of fishing. Poised some 30 or 40 feet above the water one
would hover like a Kestrel and one could plainly see the long black
beak pointing downwards at right angles to the body.
When a fish was spotted the bird plunged straight into the water
after it. Occasionally one would check its headlong plunge and hover
again a few feet over the surface, presumably because the prey had
vanished.
This bird is about three times the size of its English cousin and, as
its name denotes, entirely black and white in colour.
The Pigmy Kingfisher is, I should think, the dwarf of the family.
In size about that of a Red-faced Lovebird it is coloured like the
English species but with a bright red beak. It w r as fairly evenly
distributed throughout the scrub country and was usually seen singly
or in pairs, sitting either on telegraph wires or a prominent bare
twig, often quite near the ground.
As I frequently saw it far from water I concluded it was a " land "
species which probably fed on grasshoppers and other insects.
When visiting a friend one day I was delighted to find among his
poultry a tame hand-reared pair of Hartlaub's Duck. They ran loose
with the Muscovy Ducks with whom they shared a small concrete
pond. Being full-winged I was surprised to hear that they never
strayed far.
As I believe these are rather rare in British collections here is a brief
description (from memory) : Size about that of a Wigeon ; general
colouring dark chestnut with black head, blue wing bars, and blue bill.
At one time I had hopes of bringing this pair back with me, but
repeated attacks of malaria resulted in my being " boarded 55 home
by the M.O. rather suddenly, which wrecked all plans of this nature.
West African Harriers were fine handsome birds often seen and
always in pairs. About the size of a Kite they had long thin yellow
legs, rather long tails, and rounded wings. The general colour was
French grey with darker markings on flights and tail and red skin
round the eyes. They were capable of raising the head feathers
which gave the appearance of a slight crest.
I usually saw them quartering the edges of the palm forests with
slowly beating wings, every now and then diving into the depths of
the palm fronds presumably in search of food. The natives assured
me they were after the red palm fruit which struck me as a bit far
fetched for birds of prey ! They certainly never attacked domestic
poultry any more than the Black Kites, which used to congregate
wherever the vultures did, on the look out for offal.

The name is a misnomer as these Kites are dark brown. They
appeared to be migratory as I only saw them during the dry season,
from about December to April.
On several occasions I had the good fortune to see a Barbary
Shrike. Near where we were living was a large area of dense scrub
which surrounded a salt water lagoon. Man-made ditches and native
footpaths criss-crossed in and out of this region and enabled one to
penetrate quite deeply.
It was here that I did a lot of my bird watching and occasionally
had a glimpse of this beautiful Shrike as it flitted across an opening
in the bushes. From coloured illustrations I know that the bird is
scarlet below and black above with a golden crown, but it was very
shy and I never saw more than a flash of deep red as it veered away
from me in flight. I never saw one perched. Its size is about that of
an English Blackbird.
In my rambles I occasionally disturbed odd Night Herons which
would fly a short distance with a peculiar zigzag course before dropping
back into the reeds.
On many occasions I saw what I am pretty certain to have been
Goliath Herons. I was unable to get nearer to them than one is usually
able to get near the English bird at home as they were wary and usually
spotted me first. They were larger than any Herons I have ever seen
and answered the description of Goliaths given in Bannerman's

Many other birds were seen at different times, particularly members
of the waders and birds of prey, but they were mostly very short
glimpses, and as I think mere lists of birds are uninteresting I will
refrain from writing them down here.
In the hope that it will be of general interest I will wind up this
article with an account of a Parrot-catching expedition which, although
it resulted in failure, afforded me sights of wild Grey Parrots which
I might not have otherwise had.
In my previous article I mentioned a native from whom one could
purchase Greys at ys. 6 d. each. This same gentleman on payment of
vast sums of " dash 55 money promised to allow myself and a friend
to accompany him on his next expedition.
Accordingly we met him at his village one afternoon. His equipment
consisted of a number of long " pea sticks ", a pot full of crude rubber,
which he kept covered with water and which when handled was
every bit as effective as bird lime, three tame Grey Parrots to be used
as decoys, and a pair of scissors hung round his neck on a piece of
string. He also brought two very small boys whose use became
apparent later on.
He led us miles into the bush until we came to a tall tree with
foliage only at the top. Up this he climbed as only a native can

and then I noticed a cunningly concealed platform among the thick
leaves. He took up one end of a long string with him. When he
reached the top the two small boys fastened the pot of bird lime
and the bunch of " pea sticks " with the Parrots perched on them,
to the other end, and the whole outfit was then hauled up the tree.
The pea sticks were then placed so that they stuck out at all angles
from the tree's foliage. A decoy Parrot was tethered to the end of
three of them and the others were smeared with " bird lime ".
We were then instructed to make ourselves as inconspicuous as
possible and we all sat down to wait through the heat of the
afternoon.
At about 5 o'clock the decoys became restless, started to flap their 1
wings and call in loud harsh squawks interspersed with shrill whistles.
Shortly afterwards a quiet voice from up the tree said, " Massah,
they come ! " and almost at once I heard answering whistles seemingly i
a great way off. Presently, high up against the blue sky I spotted j
them. I could see their red tails even at that distance--four of them,
and as they caught sight of the decoys they began to descend in steep
spiral turns. Eventually they were flying round level with the tree
tops, and as they passed over I could hear the swish of their wings
and see their white cheek patches.
Round and round they flew and eventually settled in a tree about
ioo yards away, but they must have been suspicious of something as
they would not pitch on the fatal branches and eventually passed on
their way to their roosting grounds.
Presently four more came and repeated the performance. At one
point they all but alighted with the decoys, but again thought better
of it and passed on.
I gathered that when a bird is caught on a limed branch it is hauled
in, its wings are clipped on the spot (hence the scissors), and it is
dropped to the boys waiting below with a wicker basket.
By this time the sun was setting and our guide informed us that
there would be no more Parrots that day, so we packed up.
Strangely enough the natives always referred to them as " Pollies ",
apparently finding the pronunciation easier than " parrot
All the captive Parrots I saw at different times were obviously wild
caught, and not a bit like the imported ones which used to come
to this country all more or less finger tame. Whether the natives of
that part of the coast are particularly lazy I cannot say, but they all
told me that young Parrots for hand-rearing were unobtainable, as
the birds nested in such inaccessible trees. Their only means of securing
them was by the method just described.

1942 has been a most disappointing year in every way ; heavy
losses among adult birds, including our entire flock of Blue Robins,
a fine two-year-old Ocellated Turkey cock, a would-be breeding
Secretary Bird owing to egg trouble, a finger-tame Lidths Jay in
lovely plumage, and an even tamer Chinese Magpie, to name only
a few. In addition a record number of clear eggs and chicks dead
in shell from Pheasants and Waterfowl. It will not surprise anyone
that we have not felt able to accept the invitation to " write 55 for
the Magazine.
The reasons for this debacle are : (i) inferior food ; (2) the long
cold winter and late spring ; (3) shortage of staff, making it impossible
to give the birds the care and supervision they were used to ; (4) the
terrible increase of rats, weasels, and other vermin. The Brush
Turkey built an enormous mound and certainly hatched one chick,
probably more. He has started to make a new mound, consequently
the old one was examined. It contained twenty-five clear eggs beside
several addled. The surprising thing to me is the size of the eggs.
A Brush Turkey is a comparatively small bird, but these eggs were
quite as big as a Chinese Goose's egg. Though they had been a full
year in the mound, they were beautifully white and clean, and looked
like new-laid.
The pair of Andean Geese turned very savage, and we had great
hopes of goslings. All the six eggs were fertile, but the embryos died.
These Geese are said to lay regularly once they begin, and we hope
for better luck next year. The gander is always ready for a scrap with
man or beast, he is a fine bird, and very handsome. The pair were
hatched at Cleres. The Radjah Shelduck, Red-breasted Geese, and
Puna Teal made no attempt at nesting, though all had bred the year
before. A few Ashy-headed and one Blue-winged Goose were reared,
a Cape Teal tried hard, and so did Ross' Snow Geese, but rats, Rooks,
or other foes sucked their eggs and left them and us lamenting. The
widowed Eider punctually laid, but very sensibly did not attempt to
incubate. The Black Swans laid and incubated as usual, but were
not allowed to hatch owing to shortage of food. A pair are loose on
the river, where they seem quite able to maintain themselves and look
very handsome.
A Flamingo escaped some months ago, and no more was seen of
him until this week, when we heard that he had been recaptured at
a village some way off. That Flamingo was hatched under a lucky
star ! He was knocked down at dusk by an R.A.F. lorry, and escaped
death by a miracle, even his legs were not broken. The driver stopped,
and finding he was only stunned, handed him over to a near-by cottage

where a kind woman bathed his hurts, fed him, and took charge.
There he remained until the police rang us up to know if we had

QUEEN ALEXANDRA'S PARRAKEET
JVorthipsitta alexandra (Gould)
(i) Its History

This is not only one of the rarest of the Australian Parrakeets, but
one of the most beautiful. It lacks the very brilliant hues of some of
the others, but the delicacy of its colours is not exceeded by any.
It is certainly an aristocrat amongst the Australian Parrots.
The following is a brief description : Top of the head, delicate blue
which shades off into olive green on the nape and back, while there
is a pale yellowish-green patch on the shoulders. The cheeks and
throat are rosy pink and the thighs red, while the breast and under
parts are olive grey. The upper tail-coverts and the very long tail
are olive green with a bluish tinge, the inner webs of the outer tail-
feathers being rosy pink and the small bill rosy red.
That fine old naturalist, John Gould, must have been delighted
to discover this lovely species in a collection received from Central
Australia in 1863. It was very soon after the marriage of Queen
Victoria's eldest son to the lovely Danish Princess and, being impressed
by the delicate beauty of the new species of Parrot, he very fittingly
named it after her. 1 These are his words in his Handbook to the Birds
of Australia.
" I feel assured that the discovery of an additional species of the
lovely genus Polytelis will be hailed with pleasure by all ornithologists,
and that they will assent to its bearing the specific name of alexandr (R),
in honour of that Princess who, we may reasonably hope, is destined
at some future time to be the Queen of these realms and their
dependencies, of which Australia is by no means the most
inconspicuous."
1 Gould gave this species the English name of " Princess of Wales' Parrakeet ",
but as this might refer to any Princess of Wales, it seems best to adopt the name of
</bodyText>
<reference confidence="0.6744165">
" Queen Alexandra's Parrakeet " as it was clearly named in honour of that par-
ticular Princess--Alexandra. The species has been the subject of two coloured
plates in our Magazine, the first, by P. J. Smit, in September, 1899, the second, by
Roland Green, in May, 1935.

This species is undoubtedly closely allied to the other members
of the genus Polytelis--melanurus and barrabandi --but certain systematists
are ever on the search for little differences which may provide an
excuse for creating new names for genera or species. Thus, in 1895,
Alfred J. North, of the Australian Museum, discovered that in the
adult male alexandrce the third primary wing feather is somewhat
elongated and spatulated at the tip, a very weak character, one would
have thought, upon which to found a new genus. Mr. North thought
otherwise and proposed the new genus Spathopterus which was allowed
by ornithologists until Gregory Mathews discovered that this name
was already used somewhere else. But instead of returning it to the
genus Polytelis to which it obviously belongs, he created yet another,
namely JVorthipsitta, for its reception, and here it remains until somebody
changes it again 4
The Alexandra Parrakeet is a bird of the Interior of Australia,
and it is only when excessive drought compels it to visit less arid
districts that we hear of any being seen ; so years may elapse without
there being any word of these birds, and then a season comes round
when they are not uncommon.
When in Western Australia in January, 1908, I was told that a year
or so previously these birds had been common in the Kalgoorlie
district and, an opportunity presenting itself, I travelled thither with
the late Mr. E. A. Le Souef. I heard of many of the birds being
captured or hand-reared from the nest though most of these had
died. There were no aviculturists there in those days and, in fact,
very few in Australia at all, and any such birds that might be acquired
were not thought much of because they did not talk. The only
specimens I could find were one or two kept in small Parrot cages.
The members of the Horne Expedition to Central Australia of
1894 came across numbers of Alexandra Parrakeets breeding in the
neighbourhood of the Hale River, and Mr. Charles Pritchard, a
member of the party, wrote : " This is the first time on record that
they have made this their breeding ground, but I do not think they
have come to stay, and perhaps in a year or so they may be as rare
as ever. These birds travel in lots of from one pair to nearly any
number, are very tame, feeding about in the grass near the camp,
and seem in no way afraid of people, cattle, or horses. They breed
in hollow trees, laying five eggs to a clutch and several pairs of birds
occupy holes in the same tree. ... I have a number in captivity,
amongst them being an old male bird with a tail 17 inches long."
Young birds, taken from the nests, were easily reared for, when placed
in open boxes " the old birds came and fed them for days and were
as tame as domestic pigeons ". Other writers as well testify to the
extreme tameness of these birds.
When I published an account of this species in Parrakeets in 1902

only four or five of these Parrakeets had been seen alive in this country,
but since then aviculture has advanced to a high level in Australia
and a good many specimens have been sent to this country from
fellow aviculturists over there ; and it has been bred both in Australia
and here. The first to breed it here was Hubert Astley in 1912, but
by far the greatest success has been achieved by Alfred Ezra who may
be said to have successfully established this species in this country.
His account, which follows, will be read with the greatest interest.

This lovely bird has always been my favourite Parrakeet, but only
in 1932 was I successful in having a pair which a kind friend of mine,
Mr. Harvey, of Adelaide, sent me. They had nested with him several
times, but had never reared any young. They arrived in show con-
dition, with every feather perfect, proving the amount of care and
trouble that had been taken over them on the voyage. After keeping
them in a cage in my bird room for a few days I turned them out
into one of my large Parrakeet aviaries. I gave them a vertical nest
box about 6 feet long with bark inside and outside, and this was filled
with peat moss that was damped, and over this I put in a few pieces,
of rotten wood. They settled down at once, and became so tame that
the moment I walked into the aviary they both flew on to my shoulder,
when I fed them with a few mealworms. After being in the aviary
for about a week they were keenly interested in the nest, and the cock
bird was often feeding the hen. Very soon after four eggs were laid,
and the hen bird sat well, the cock fed her all the time. All four
eggs were hatched early in July. As the birds were very tame I was
able to look into the nest box as often as I liked without disturbing
them. The cock bird worked very hard, and kept on supplying the
hen and the young with food all day long.
About the end of August one sturdy young bird left the nest, and
the other three followed in a few days. I have never seen more healthy
young birds, and so strong on the wing from the moment they left
the nest. The cock bird gave up feeding them, and always flew
away when any of the young ones came up to him for food, but the
hen bird fed them all day long.
While nesting and feeding young the Parrakeets were given the
ordinary seeds, with a few mealworms every day, also a lot of groundsel,
chickweed, lettuce, apple, and growing wheat and oats from the
fields, and sometimes a piece of sponge cake. By the end of September
the young were almost as large as the parents, but paler in colour,
and of course their tails were not so long. About the middle of October

the four young birds looked exactly like the adult birds, and were
then separated from the parents. In September, when they were
fully reared, the hen started to lay again, but as it was too late in
the season I removed the nest box from the aviary. As these birds
are so rare, and have not been bred in Europe for a long time, I was
more than delighted with my good luck. I have never had birds
settle down so quickly and rear young so soon after a long voyage
as this pair have done. The second year I expected at least two
broods from this excellent pair of birds, but was most disappointed.
In 1933, early in April, the same old pair laid four eggs. All were
hatched. One young was found dead in the nest and the other three
were thrown out of the nest. They nested again laying three eggs.
Two young ones were hatched. One was found dead in the nest, and
the other one was seen being carried about by the female in her beak
dead. After this extraordinary behaviour I thought a change would
do them good, so I removed them into another aviary, where they
settled down at once and laid three eggs. One young one was hatched,
but the other two eggs were infertile. This young one was also killed
when about a fortnight old. She again laid four eggs, and just as they
were due to hatch I removed the cock bird from the aviary. Two
young were hatched and successfully reared. I think the trouble was
caused by the cock bird being too kind and attentive to the hen, and
spoiling her by feeding her all day long, and she never took the trouble
to leave the nest. When the cock bird was removed she had to come
out to feed, and in this way she also fed and reared her young. I have
tried this plan every year since with great success, and the same pair
have reared dozens of young ones. When only a year old the young
birds went to nest and laid, but I lost the hen through being egg
bound. Another pair only a year old laid, but all the eggs were
infertile. It is interesting to note that these Parrakeets nest when they
are not quite a year old.
In the last ten years I have reared well over twenty of these beautiful
birds, and the old cock is still going strong, but I lost the hen two
years ago. No birds have given me greater pleasure, nor have any
birds done so well with me. This year I have again reared four lovely
young ones. What is so fascinating about this Parrakeet is that he is
so beautifully coloured and is always tame and most happy in an
aviary.

This is the strangest and most peculiar member of the Barbet family.
Several people have asked me, not knowing they were Barbets, if they
were small Toucans. Certainly their colouring and large beaks do
give them a certain resemblance to those birds, especially their glossy
black upper parts, brilliant red, white, black, and pink underparts,
and large yellow beak.
When I received them I was told that they needed a box to sleep
in, but though I gave them many none seemed to suit them. Later
we put in their aviary a thick solid tree trunk ; the birds took to this
with alacrity and immediately started to hollow it out with the agility
of a couple of Woodpeckers.
For years I suffered from a dearth of suitable hollow nesting logs
for Parrakeets, now these birds fully supply my needs. I don't think
we should do better if we kept a resident joiner ! A thick log about
two to three feet long and ten to twelve inches in diameter is fastened
in the aviary, and immediately the birds start to work on it. A perfectly
round hole, about two inches across, is made at the side near the top,
and then the log is beautifully hollowed out. The chippings are
carefully collected and neatly piled up in one corner of the aviary.
This is no doubt owing to the birds' natural instinct of taking all the
chippings away from the nesting hole in case of giving the location
away to its enemies.
It takes about a fortnight to complete one log, both birds doing their
fair share. They work very much like a Woodpecker, to which the
Barbets are no doubt closely related. The birds cannot work logs
of hardwood such as oak, etc., so we supply them with logs of fairly
soft wood which are tending to become decayed.
No birds I have ever kept seem more impatient of cold, they only
appear really happy when the thermometer stands at 8o* F. or more ;
then they are lively and their plumage tight, glossy, and bright ; if
the temperature falls to 6o* F. they are dull and listless, and their
feathers lose the gloss. I have never known them to bathe, but we
spray them each day with a fine horticultural spray. The importance
of humidity for tropical birds is often overlooked. It is surprising
the difference a week or two's spraying makes to such birds. A fine
" mist " spray should be used. " Enots " Pneumatic Sprayer No. 1807
is the best for this purpose, and when fully pumped up will fill the
air with a fine mist-like spray for over an hour.
In a wild state the Barbets live almost wholly on fruit, but in these

biscuit meal, also apples saved from our own orchard ; only one a day
is allowed, but they would eat six if we could spare them. Wild
berries such as privet, hawthorn, and elder in season, are greatly
relished.
As mentioned before, the bird may best be described as resembling
a miniature Toucan, glossy black above, the breast and under parts
are a striped arrangement of bright crimson, black, white, and pink.
At the side is a square patch of dense pink and white feathers which
is doubtless used in display ; these are usually hidden beneath the
wings. The lower back is white. The large yellow beak is considerably
notched and toothed, while under the lower mandible is a row of
parallel grooves which run at right angles to the beak, but these are
hidden by the long black bristles which almost cover the lower
mandible. Similar bristles spring from the nostrils, but these are
not as long as the lower ones which reach the tip of the beak. What
these bristles are used for is a matter of conjecture, possibly they are
something to do with the sticky fruits upon which the birds feed in a
wild state.
A very interesting description of this bird in West Africa is given by
Dr. Hopkinson in a volume of Bird Notes , but as most of my books are
packed away for the " duration ", I cannot quote it. However,
having a volume of Bannerman's Birds of Tropical West Africa handy,
I quote the following about the bird in a state of freedom : " The
Bearded Barbet in Northern Nigeria is to be met with almost every-
where, in the bush, on cultivated clearings . . . where there are large
trees. A very favourite haunt is the forest at the foot of a rocky hill
or outcrop. Wholly arboreal the Bearded Barbet is never seen on the
ground. It is an alert-looking bird peering about from its branch,
and when it is about to move off sometimes whisking its tail." It is
also stated that wherever a certain kind of wild fig tree is found there
one is almost sure to meet with these Barbets.
I don't think this Barbet was imported before 1939. Dr. Hopkinson
mentions ip the Magazine for September, 1940, that there was a pair
at the London " Zoo " which were from a dozen imported by Fockel-
mann. Mine must have originally come from this consignment, the
other I believe went to America.

PENNANT'S PARRAKEET (Nos. 397, 398), Platycercus e. elegans
(Gm.), P. e. adelaidae, Gld. Adelaide Parrakeet.
The first record of breeding I have is Rousse in France, Bull. 1880,
p. 221 ; for the U.K. a suceess is recorded in the Report of the U.K.
Foreign Cage Bird Soc., Jan., 1832, and another by Wilson in B.JV. iv, 231 ;
he reared 4 young in 1905. Since then they have been frequently
bred both here and abroad.
The Adelaide Parrakeet, a subspecies, was first bred by Fasey in
I 9 * 7 --four young reared ; A.S. Medal (A.M. igoy, 342, 344 ), and
Poltimore reared one young one in 1914 (B.JV. 1314 , 43). I feel sure
that they have also been bred by others, but have no actual records.
The Adelaide X Pennant cross is included in Page's book, and
Captain Waud reared four such nominal hybrids in 1925, one of
which went to the Zoo (A.M. 1326 , 328).

PENNANT x ROSELLA.
This cross is given in Page's book. The wild-bred hybrid of this
cross is the " Red-mantled Parrakeet, P. erythropeplus Salvadori ". In
B.JV. 1312 , some of these were advertised at 70s. each, whether wild-
caught or cage-bred, I cannot say, but in B.JV. ign, 31J, Mariner had
reported the rearing of three such hybrids in that year, and the birds
advertised the next year may well have been his. The " Adelaide X
Rosella cross " was bred by Arthur about 1892 teste Finn and Arthur
in the " Parrots " (Cage-Bird Handbook, 1327).

Russ says that the first breeder was Comely in the eighties, but
Neunzig has nothing to say about breeding. In England the bird
was bred for the first time by Lord Tavistock in 1934, four young which
left the nest on 12th August, and were all reared (A.M. 1334, 261 ;
Medal , 326).

Bred by Whitley at Paignton in 1928 and 1929. I saw the young
birds of both years in May, 1930, when the hen was again brooding
more young, which were also reared. He has also bred further crosses,
some of which triple and quadruple crosses I saw in 1932, of which
the parents had been these two Parrakeets (Yellow-bellied and Rosella)
and two other Platycerci,, but which these were I forget.
The cross with the male YELLOW-NAPED PARRAKEET is also
on record.

First breeder, Fasey (U.K.), in 1904, four young being reared and
the Avicultural Medal awarded (A.M. 1904 , 353). Neunzig writing
in 1921 (p. 744) says, " it has been bred in England, and at Copen-
hagen in 1892." This last would be the actual first therefore. Later
on Tavistock reared one young one in 1926 (A.M. 1926, 279) and bred
them again in 1936.

The young male bred in 1935 was mated with a hen PENNANT in
1938, and one young bird reared : a male, three-quarters Pennant,
which when a year old was not yet in full colour and looked like
an ADELAIDE PARRAKEET ; it was mated in 1939 with a hen
PENNANT, but I have heard nothing further. If young resulted
they would be seven-eighths Pennant. More of the original cross
were bred again in 1940. If Mr. Rudkin sees this I hope he will
let us have more details.

many records, of which I will mention regular annual breeding with
Dart {B.N. v, 201) and Shore Baily who one year reared five young
{B.N. 1915, 42). They are now being frequently (I think annually)
bred at Paignton and elsewhere. The earliest record I have is a French

Australia, continues to be received regularly, and is striking evidence of the " alive-
ness " and enterprise of that Society. The fine collection of Pheasants which is marred
by the fact that there are only single specimens of several species, has been improved
by the addition of a hen Cheer and a fine pair of Lady Amhersts, and arrangements
are in hand to procure hen Edwards and Impeyan. The Society also recently
acquired several Flock, or Harlequin, Pigeons, which once occurred in Northern
Australia in very large numbers, but now have become comparatively rare. These
new arrivals at the Zoo nested, and at the time of the issue of the July-August report,
one young had been reared. The African Penguins hatched a young one which was
successfully reared, and the Fairy Blue Penguins also produced eggs. Three Albino
Magpies came into the possession of the Society, having been blown out of a nest
at Lyndoch ; two of these birds are pure albinos the other being a pale buff colour.
The Society is faced with a problem which often confronts aviculturists--lack of
accommodation ; this necessitates the mixing of species in the same cage, sometimes
with dire results during the breeding season, owing to the unfortunate predilection
shown by some birds to devour the eggs or young of their companions.
The Royal Zoological Society of South Australia is an example of the spirit which
permeates the whole of the British Commonwealth of Nations in carrying on in
spite of all difficulties, and the good wishes and admiration of their colleagues in the
British Isles are warmly accorded them.

This note is very brief. I have only seen my birds from time to time when on
leave. I purchased my Pennant hen early last year -(1942), and she still had the
immature green colouring on the back, although otherwise fully adult in appearance.
Unfortunately I was unable to obtain details as to her age.
As she was introduced to new quarters, I hardly expected her to nest straight
away, and was surprised to hear that she had taken to the nest box. When I next
visited home, I was told she had been in and out of the nest for about a month, but
had never spent very long sitting. I therefore decided to investigate, and found
eighteen eggs, all cold.
The cock was continually driving her when she was out in the aviary, and I can
only think that this, combined with her nervousness of new surroundings which
prevented her from sitting, must have caused her unusual performance. She laid a
further six eggs, after which the cock gave up his efforts to make her sit, and she did
not approach the nest box again throughout the season.
Had I been at home, I should have set some of the eggs under other pairs, and I did
try three which appeared to be the most recently laid, under a pair of Gockatiels--
the only available nest at the time, but they failed to hatch. Again, as I was unable
to make personal observation, I cannot say if they were infertile or if the fosters
just deserted them.
When home recently, I opened the nest boxes in the various aviaries, and the
following day the cock was driving the hen again.
I am now concerned to find out if she will again lay, or if last season's effort has
exhausted her. I will endeavour to let you know what happens, later in the season.
This war has certainly upset our normal activities, and I can only hope it will not
be of long duration.

Breeding Blue-fronted Amazons in Switzerland
In looking through a book of newspaper cuttings I came across an extract from
The Feathered World of 26th July, 1895, which records the successful breeding of this
species in the open.
In 1894 a pair of Blue-fronted Amazons belonging to Dr. Wyss, of Hunenburg,
in the canton of Zug, Switzerland, which had been allowed to fly freely around the
meadows and forest for twenty years, successfully reared two healthy and strong
young ones. Again, in 1895, the old birds nested in the same spot with successful
results.
The position chosen for the nest was a deep hole in an old pear tree, about a third
of the height of the tree from the ground. The writer, Mr. H. R. Hayes, remarks
that " during the breeding time the birds are very loving and extremely annoyed
(make a tremendous swearing noise) if anyone out of curiosity goes near their nesting-
place. . . . Four eggs were laid this year (1895) and with extraordinary regularity,
namely, on the 13th, 16th, 19th and 22nd June respectively. . . . Last year all the
four birds left the nest on 30th August, when all were taken into a room where the
old birds used to pass the autumn and winter ".

I would like to voice my protest regarding the exorbitant prices which some

a quite inferior seed costs 12J. 6 d. per lb. ; in pre-war days better seed was sold
at 6 d. lb. I am sorry to say that out of a collection of over four hundred birds
I have only two left ; these are nectar feeders, otherwise they would have died,
as my others did, owing to the inferiority of the exorbitantly priced seed which
I had to feed them with.

A COLLECTION OF BIRDS FROM COSTA RICA
By J. Delacour
For more than ten years it has always been a thrilling experience
to see Mr. C. Cordier arrive with a collection of birds. It happens
once or twice a year. Until 1939 he used to bring his collections to
Cleres, and the surplus material found its way mostly to the London
Zoo, to Mr. A. Ezra and Mr. Spedan Lewis in England, and to Dr. E.
Beraint and M. Francois Edmond-Blanc in France. These happy days
are over, alas ! But Mr. Cordier still brings his collections, now to
the United States. He brought us, to the New York Zoological Park,
a marvellous Colombian collection in December, 1941, and early in
October, 1942, he was back again, this time from Costa Rica, with
perhaps the finest lot of birds he has ever secured.
There are ninety-six birds in the collection, including three Umbrella
Birds which have never before been exhibited alive. Fifty-four
Humming Birds of which the majority have never been imported
anywhere, and eighteen Quetzals, often called " the most beautiful
birds in the New World ".
Famed for its extraordinary, umbrella-like crest, the Umbrella Bird
was probably the last great rarity among tropical American birds,
that have ever been exhibited. Until 1937 it shared that distinction
with the legendary Quetzal, the sacred bird of the ancient Aztecs
but in that year the Bronx Zoo obtained nine of them. The eighteen
Quetzals now brought by Mr. Cordier are a Costa Rican form of the
bird, and only one specimen of this form has ever come to the United
States.
The Umbrella Bird is about the size of a Crow, and is jet black
except for a patch of bare, bright red skin on its throat and breast.
Growing from this is a small, fleshy lappet. The bird takes its name
from the extraordinary umbrella of black feathers on top of its head.
These grow forward towards the bird's beak and can be raised,
lowered, or spread sideways to cover the face and beak. Old natural
history books often show the crest raised straight over the head in
mushroom shape, but the drawings were prepared from the skins

of dead birds, and nobody actually knew what the living bird did with
its crest feathers.
From the observations of Mr. Cordier, the Umbrella Bird spreads
its " umbrella " several times a day, when it is feeling particularly
good. If it actually sheds rain like an umbrella, the bird is more
fortunate than others in central Costa Rica, for it rains eleven months
out of the year in the Umbrella Bird country.
The Umbrella Bird is known scientifically as Cephalopterus ornatus
glabricollis , and it is found only in Costa Rica and Western Panama.
There are two other kinds of the bird, found in other parts of Central
America. It lives in thick jungles, inhabiting the tops of tall trees--*
which is probably the reason why so many bird collectors have in the
past failed to catch it. Many expeditions have sought the Umbrella
Bird, but could obtain it only by shooting.
The Bronx Zoo's specimens were caught in special nets slung high
in the trees, and Lee S. Crandall, Curator of Birds, said that they
were obtained alive only because Mr. Cordier is " one of the best
two or three bird collectors in the world to-day
The Costa Rican Quetzals, known scientifically as Pharomacrus
mocinno costaricensis, are mostly adults, and several of them have begun
to grow the long upper tail coverts which are the birds' greatest glory
next to their amazingly iridescent green-gold-and-blue plumage.
Some of the tail plumes were broken off during shipment, but when
they grow out, and as the birds get older, they will eventually be
nearly a yard long.
The fifty-four Humming Birds in the collection comprise eleven
species, at least seven of which have never been exhibited in any bird
collection before.
Although larger shipments of Humming Birds, in point of numbers,
have been made by Mr. Cordier to Cleres, in its variety and beauty
the present lot is the best that has ever been made from the highlands
of the American tropics.
In the new home of the Humming Birds that is being rushed in the
Bronx Zoo's Bird House, they will be exhibited behind glass in small
brightly lighted cages, while the public will view them from a black
passageway.
Mr. Cordier left New York for Costa Rica on 4th March, 1942.
He established a collecting base on the Cataratas River, several days'
travel north of San Jose, the capital, and on the banks of this river at
an altitude of 3,000 feet, he caught his first Umbrella Bird. The area
is on the Atlantic slope of the continental divide where the rain falls
constantly eleven months of the year. Although Umbrella Birds are
supposed to range over all of Costa Rica, Mr. Cordier saw them
nowhere except around the Cataratas River and a journey of an hour
and a half in any direction carried him out of Umbrella Bird country.

J. DELAGOUR-A COLLECTION OF BIRDS FROM COSTA RICA 3 1
The Quetzals and Humming Birds were all caught on the sides of
the Irazu volcano north-east of San Jose. The Quetzals were captured
at night, Mr. Cordier sweeping them out of the air with a butterfly
net. The Humming Birds he caught with sticky gum on the tip of a
fishing pole. He waited until they hovered over a flower, and then
touched the pole to their buzzing wings.
Late in September he brought his birds out of the jungle to San
Jose. Space was made on a plane for Miami--but at the last minute
it transpired that there was no room for all the light but bulky Humming
Bird cages. Mr. Cordier thereupon raided show stores in San Jose,
got together a score of pasteboard shoeboxes, and divided them into
compartments. He filled each compartment with loose hay, packed
his Humming Birds in the hay, and they travelled with perfect comfort.
The hay kept them from fluttering too much and gave them something
to cling to.
Not a single bird was lost on the trip except by a serious accident at
Tegucigalpa, Honduras, where the plane was forced to remain in the
full sun for several hours. Some birds suffocated despite everything
Mr. Cordier could do. Fortunately, none of the rarer species was
lost.
All the birds, a list of which follows, arrived in extraordinarily good
condition, and more than a fortnight after their arrival none had died.
We had to dispose of some of the Quetzals, keeping ten for our
collection. For the first time, I saw perfect specimens of these
magnificent birds, tame and feeding well. Six inhabit a large planted
aviary, and although there are several adult males, they never quarrel ;
neither do they molest the small birds, mostly Sugarbirds and Tanagers,
which share their flight. The Umbrella Birds are also extremely
tame and harmless.
We are now completing the transformation of one of our halls,
where Pigeons and Parrots used to be kept in rather old-fashioned
and ugly cages. We are making five long planted flights of different
styles, more or less in the same way as the greenhouse aviaries at
Cleres were planned. One has a fast-running stream and is called the
" Tropical American mountain stream ". It contains some Blue-
headed and Ruddy Buntings, a small South American Barbet, a dozen
Manakins and Sugar Birds, a few small Tanagers, and a pair of
Fire-throated Humming Birds (Panterpe ). The next one is an " Indian-
Malayan jungle " ; there live some small Fruit Pigeons, Green wings,
and Bleeding Heart Doves, a Pitta, a Rothschild's Starling, a Shama,
a small Javan Barbet, some Bulbuls and Babuls, a few Timor Paddas
and Crested Buntings.
The other three, which will soon be completed, will be a " desert ",
an " American Garden " and a " Tropical American Rain forest
It is great fun designing and planting these aviaries. I find it the

By A. H. Scott
His name was certainly Moses, for he was found abandoned among
the bulrushes, and drawn out of the water, but to what family he
belonged is not so clear. He was rescued in strange enough fashion
late one evening in June. I had been casting for trout from a tiny
island in my pond, and was returning to the shore across a narrow
plank bridge when my eye was caught by a little black object in the
water, about the size of a mouse and nearly submerged. It was near
enough for me to reach by leaning out with a landing net, and being
very ignorant of such creatures I was delighted to capture what
was evidently a newly hatched water bird of some sort. From its
feet I guessed it was a Grebe, and as it was so small it seemed likely
to be a Dabchick ; but it was so near death that my first thought was
to dry and warm it, and my second to look round for any others
which must have met with disaster at the same time. I soon caught
sight, on the other side of the bridge and farther away, of another
little black blob plaintively appealing to the Universe against a
watery death. As it was just possible, making a long arm, to touch
it with the tip of my rod, I soon managed to get its head between the
rod end and the line, and then to drag it in by the neck. No others
were to be seen from the bridge or the shore, but returning to the
island I heard again the weak piping sound, and presently was able
to make out the third of the family a long way off at the edge of some
bulrushes. Between us lay a stretch of shallow weedy water covering
a great depth of mud, then a few yards of deep water, and again
shallow water over a treacherous bottom. To flounder and swim,
and flounder again through tangled weeds was a most uninviting
idea, and the only boat on the pond was lying completely waterlogged.
It seemed impossible to do anything at all, and very reluctantly
I recrossed the bridge and climbed the homeward hill ; but my
conscience troubled me. We have such a deep-seated instinct to save
life from drowning that even the curious busy blue-bottle swimming
unhygienically in our glass of milk becomes an object of compassion.
I turned back to the pond to think again, and looking intently at the
little victim I had an idea. The bird was beyond the range of ordinary
casting, but did not seem quite impossible to reach, and certainly it
was better to get a tiny hook in the skin than to drown. So I set to
work, and after many misses landed my fly several times across its
back, but again and again it trickled off the close-set down. At last
the line tightened, and Moses (for of course it was he) was very gently
wound ashore. His luck was in, as the hook proved to be not in his
body but caught in a piece of weeding which was twisted round his
feet. The slow mid-summer twilight was turning to dusk, and no

more of the family could be seen or heard, so I hurried home better
pleased than with the largest fish. I had never heard of Grebes being
reared by hand, but did not expect any great difficulty, for the near-by
forest provides me with ample supplies of ant eggs, the best of all foods
for a great variety of birds. The problem of warmth was solved in
advance since we possess an Aga cooker on which a great many
young birds have been reared, some almost from the egg. The Aga
cooker is built on the Thermos principle, and is about the only instance
of an article of humble homely use to which a distinguished man of
sicence has thought it worth while to devote his brains. Many and
various are the virtues proclaimed by its makers, yet they omit to
mention its most outstanding excellence, that it is the perfect instrument
for rearing young birds. The temperature of its surface, graduated
from the edge to the centre, remains stable, and my method is to put
flowerpots at the right place for the correct warmth, and in the
flowerpots some hay, above which a nest is arranged for the young
birds. They are lightly covered with any suitable material, and a
second flowerpot is inverted over the first. In this way the even
temperature of nature is maintained, and there is no lack of fresh
air and no smell of lamps. The birds, of course, are uncovered for
suitable periods varied to suit their age. At this point I seem to hear
feminine voices murmuring in unison : " All very well, but what
about the cook ? 55 Now I was just coming to that, so be patient.
It is largely a matter of money, of not having too much. Riches, we
know, make it difficult for people to enter the Kingdom of Heaven,
but they bar the way to many other places, and we may doubt whether
in all England there is a single millionaire who enjoys the grandes et
petites entrees to his own kitchen. A man may possibly overcome the
natural fear of butlers, but these, though men of uncongenial punctilio
and estranging decorum, have not the nervous irritability of the
creative artists who, within their sacred precinct, strive continually
after unattainable perfections ; and though riches may usually be
a good substitute for moral courage, Mr. Dives will hardly venture
so far as to place flowerpots upon his kitchen range. The ordinary
fellow of modest fortune has better prospects, but he requires a little
prudence and foresight. He, or rather his .wife, must select a cook
who is either very young, so young that she can be bullied and cajoled,
or else very old, so old that she has learned life's final lesson of resigna-
tion and renouncement. Our Mrs. Smith was over seventy, with a
game leg and memories of better days, so I was entitled to assume
that she had long recognized the truth of the Stoic doctrine that the
wise man will nobly agree with Necessity. For a long time indeed it
appeared that I was right, and all went smoothly without objections
or complaints. Already there were four sets of flowerpots upon the
range, containing respectively an orphaned Canary, two cream-

coloured Sparrows from different nests of wild birds which had mated
with others released from my aviaries ; and lastly a pure white
Chaffinch with a grey cap, too precious to be left to its own mother
or any bird whatsoever. A pair of extra large pots were added for
the Grebes, and after a first and, as I hoped, a last forcible feeding
they were tucked up for the night. In the morning I was able to examine
them more closely, and to observe their movements when placed on
the ground. Waterfowl experts will hardly be interested in a descrip-
tion of these birds, but such experts are no doubt few in number.
To me at least it was a fascinating study, for these very curious
creatures are so peculiar in appearance and behaviour that the
ignoramus would certainly imagine that they came from some distant
land. Their movements were very clumsy, for they seemed unable
to stand up for more than a moment and humped themselves along
with the aid of their rudimentary wings or flippers. Seen at a distance,
with their heads down they were very like toads, but if they stopped
and raised their long necks one was immediately reminded of little
water tortoises. A few days later, when they stood upright without
difficulty, every layman who saw them imagined that they were baby
Penguins ; and indeed the resemblance was remarkable, as they
stood with their white waistcoats and ludicrous air of good humoured
importance. The back and sides were at first covered by seven neatly
cut fawn stripes and as many black ones. The head and neck had
similar markings, fewer and narrower ; but within three or four
days the colours of their body stripes began to " run ", changing
visibly every day, until at about nine days old they were untidily
mottled with dirty fawn and black. To the changes in their colour
it will be necessary to return later. On the first morning I offered
them ant eggs, milksop, and assorted creepy-crawlies from the pond,
but they rejected everything hard, such as water shrimps, even if
crushed in advance. They fed in the same way as Moorhens, and,
I suppose all similar birds ; that is to say they were incapable of
picking up food, and never opened their beaks to feed, but stretched
up their heads expectantly, and snatched and swallowed morsels held
just above their beaks. One of the three was weak from the start,
and failed to swallow in this manner, though it made feeble attempts ;
it was necessary to open its beak, and push the food down. After three
days it died. I expected that they would want to spend a good deal
of time in the water, but this was by no means the case. Four or five
times a day I took them out to an aviary with a shallow little cement
pond about 4 feet wide. They dived and splashed with great delight,
but were out again very quickly ; thirty seconds I found was the
longest time they would remain, and their down became quickly
soaked. Wishing to see whether this was the only reason for their
hasty bathing, I put them in quite warm water. This appeared to

please them very much, and they remained in it as long as two
minutes. At the end of that time they were so waterlogged that only
their heads were above the surface, and evidently they cannot stay
longer in water at this early age without drowning. In ponds and
rivers they are no doubt often supported by weeds just beneath the
surface. They became perfectly tame within twenty-four hours, and
liked particularly to sit in my hand and be gently squeezed. Under
this pressure they dreamed, I suppose, that they were back beside
their misty island, in the reedy swamp, beneath their mother's wing.
They were very happy in the aviary where they could remain for
hours provided the sun was fully on them, but if clouds appeared, it
was necessary to remove them promptly to the kitchen range. Twice
I forgot them for an hour or so after the sun was hidden, and by that
time they were incapable of movement and almost unconscious, though
they made a quick recovery. It was evident that they missed their
mother, for they spent much time in trying to get under each other,
or under the white Sparrow which had previously lived alone in the
aviary. This Sparrow, which before their appearance had usually
perched on the high branches, scarcely ever left the little Grebes
during the hours they were there. Sparrows are not quite such adhesive
little birds as Budgerigars, but they are so highly sociable that any
friend is better than none. He joined the Grebes on the ground,
pressing up against them, while the Grebes squirmed round and
round trying to get under him. The floor of this aviary, which had
been recently dug, was of dry soft earth, and it was soon covered by
little saucer-like depressions where the three birds had performed their
continual circular squirmings.
The Sparrow didn't like being perpetually heaved up from the
ground, but for the sake of company he put up with it. Occasionally
they would separate, and the Grebes then lay about in the strangest
postures. Their legs, which are double-jointed, scarcely seemed to
belong to them. I would see one lying still with one leg stretched
parallel with the neck and pointing, we may say, due north ; while
the other leg, pointing due south, bisected the blunt end of the egg-
shaped little body, and formed almost a continuous straight line with
the first leg. Sometimes both legs would be sticking at right angles
from the body, or again they would be twisted in such haphazard
fashion that the birds resembled a child's broken toy cast away on
the ground. Several times, at first, on catching sight of them lying
still in this odd way, I thought they were dead. A large part of one
side of this aviary was formed by a very big single window pane of
our drawing room, so I could observe them comfortably whenever
they were there. This might be for several hours on hot days, or only
for a few minutes in bad weather. Moses, I felt sure from the beginning,
was a male bird, and the other a female, and this was perhaps proved

to be true by the difference, which began about the tenth day, to show
in their development. One morning I was surprised to see a little
" ear " sticking out at right angles from the side of Moses 5 head.
It had appeared during the night, and measured only an eighth of
an inch in width and length. Its colour was much the same as the
general body colour. By evening it had grown to a quarter of an inch
each way, and next morning it measured half an inch in length and
breadth, and lay at an angle of about forty-five degrees to its head.
After that this ear grew very little, but on looking out of the window
a day or two later I saw that Moses now had a bright pink patch on
his head. I could not understand why I had not noticed it when I took
him out of his flowerpot, but on going round to the aviary to look at
this patch more closely I found that I was mistaken, his head being
brown as usual. Next day when he was again lying quietly in the sun
I saw the pink patch once more quite clearly as I thought, but again
when I went round to him there was no sign of it. Convivial persons
are not greatly surprised, I believe, when they see objects which are
not actually there, especially objects of a pink colour, but to the
sober citizen it is a disturbing experience. I got out my books, but
could find no coloured illustrations of young Dabchicks. In British
Birds , however, there is a good picture of young Great-crested Grebes,
and these are shown with bright red patches on their heads. Returning
to Moses I picked him up to make a close examination ; ruffling up
the down on his head. The mystery was then solved, for underneath
was a brightly coloured patch of skin which only showed when he
relaxed like an old hen in the sun. From this patch of skin coloured
feathers must appear later, but this unfortunately I was never to
observe. Unknown to me trouble had been brewing, for my wife
informed me that Mrs. Smith objected strongly to poor Moses on
account of his incessant piping. It is a fact that young Grebes are no
more able to be silent than a musical box which has been wound up
and set going. They often fall on their backs and struggle, sometimes
vainly, to arise, like those crabs at the London Aquarium, which wear
a tin hat on their backs and spend most of their time trying to put
themselves right side up. So, too, the little Grebes, if kept on too level
a surface. But while they lie kicking on their backs they still pipe on.
Even when they go to sleep the sound continues, gradually fading as
their slumbers deepen. Science, I believe, has never discovered what
sleep is, or how it works. Someone had a theory that the body at
the right time produces a sort of harmless narcotic. If so, this sweet
poison of sleep must be like the hemlock that killed Socrates beginning
its numbing effect at the extremities and spreading upwards. Thus
the Grebes continue to pipe until sleep reaches their little throats
half an hour after their legs have lost consciousness. But Mrs. Smith,
it seemed, was demanding audience. Picking up Jourdain's British

Birds I entered the kitchen with a benevolent and conciliatory air.
" Now, Mrs. Smith," I said, " I hear you object to Moses, but you
are mistaken in thinking that he makes a horrid noise. I have here
a book written by a very learned man, and what he says is practically
gospel and cannot be contradicted. Listen to this, ' The young Grebes
keep up a continuous dulcet piping like the jingle of far away silver
bells.' Is it not a rare and particular privilege to do your cooking
to the dulcet sound of distant silver bells ? Or do you, I added severely,
do you perhaps expect me to provide a whole orchestra to play you
the nine Symphonies of Beethoven ? " At this the old dame exploded
in contemptuous cackles of witch-like merriment ; but she was not
disarmed. " The man who wrote that was dotty," she replied. " I say
it is a most horrible noise, and I can't stand it." Her eye was
indomitable, and with chagrin I saw before me the very embodiment
of that Necessity with which the wise man nobly, and sometimes
rapidly, agrees. It was setded that the large flowerpots should be
removed by day, and replaced in future only at night. This was
a disaster, for my amateurish incubator, made with a lamp, was no
great success : the little female soon became weak, and in a few days
she was dead, leaving me only Moses. He had always been extremely
vigorous, and louder of voice than the others : he now weighed, at
three weeks, a full ounce, while his sister never quite reached half
that weight. He had achieved a fair steadiness on his legs, and
developed quite a turn of speed as he hurried eagerly to meet me
when I approached the aviary. He now began to think that he was
too big a fellow to be cuddled by a Sparrow less than half his size
and preferred his own company most of the time, but they remained
very friendly. The Sparrow sitting at the side of the little pond seemed
to admire all the diving and splashing of which he himself gave as
fair an imitation as he could. But in popular esteem he had to take
a very inferior position. Everybody was charmed by Moses and
every visitor wished to see him, and was sure to laugh heartily when
he was exhibited. Certainly we have had no pet that so greatly
endeared itself in so short a time. Already I was wondering how to
procure a mate for him so that next summer he might raise a family
in one of the larger aviaries. But it was not to be. The other birds
in the kitchen were now fully reared, and gone to aviaries, and it
seemed that Moses now needed no more warmth than an ordinary
room would provide. I decided, however, to let him sleep on the
range one more night. Very early in the morning when I opened the
kitchen door next day, I was met by a blast of hot air, and knew at
once that a catastrophe had occurred. At the bottom of the cage
I saw, shining upwards through the darkness, a patch of white. For
once, once only in years, the perfect instrument had failed me, or
had it ? There was motive : there was opportunity ; a hanging

matter according to the writers of certain popular stories. But I can
never think that even the most witch-like old lady would commit so
pitiless and Grand Guignolesque a crime.
Alas ! poor Moses. Deeply mourned, he now stands, with greater
ease and aplomb than he ever achieved while living, in a glass case.
When more important matters are forgotten we shall remember still
that eager affection, that beautiful white waistcoat, and those double-
jointed legs. Assuredly next summer when the south wind blows
softly from the pond I shall listen for that " dulcet sound of distant
silver bells ", and, when I hear it, take down my landing-net and go

Comely in France was probably the first to breed this bird (the
red-vented form) in 1882, as is recorded in Bull. i8g2 , p. 323, and by
De Brisay in his Dans nos Volieres , p. 338. Neunzig (p. 746) says that
the yellow-vented race has also been probably bred and Decoux
(in lit) confirms this, writing : " There is no record, but I am sure
it was bred by M. 1 'Abbe Leray before the war. He told me he had
also bred # hybrids 5 : red-vented X yellow-vented." in the U.K.
Duncan Parker was the first breeder : A.S. Medal, 1909 (A.M. ign ,

Tavistock, 1920 (B.N. 1320, 140), Whitley, and others.

By Maurice Amsler, F.Z.S.
Although we have all tried to keep up our pre-war collections of
birds I doubt if there are half a dozen representative collections left
in the whole country. It is also very doubtful if those of us who have
collected and kept foreign birds will ever live to see the importations
of the good old times. There is bound to be a long post-war period
during which shipping space will be required for necessities and not
luxuries such as birds and plants ; moreover, many of the districts
from which we received our importations will be in such a state of
chaos and turmoil that aviculture will be a very secondary item.
My own birds have almost imperceptibly dwindled down to a few
Pheasants, and it is with the intention of a short note on these birds
that these notes are penned.
Of the small Passerines all have disappeared, not from starvation,
I am glad to say, but from a lack of variation in diet, or from too
coarse a diet.
My seed-eaters, for instance, had to be content with white millet
only ; of this I had about 2 cwt. in the autumn of 1939.
The last to survive on this diet were some Blue-headed Parrot
Finches, which I finally gave to a friend who had a more varied dietary
in hand.
The soft-bills succumbed to a soft-food which contained too much
starch ; for the other ingredients of their food, suet, honey, meat-meal,
dried flies, etc., were difficult to obtain three years ago--and now, of
course, quite impossible.
I cannot help wishing I had liberated all my birds in the late spring
of 1940. All would have had a good chance of several months of happy
freedom, and the hardier softbills, such as Ground Thrushes, Blue
Robins, etc., might have survived for a season or two, though it must
be admitted that the winters of 1940-1 and 1941-2 were extremely
severe.
In happier times we all had our own special seed mixtures, more
especially in the matter of Pheasant grain, and any deviation from our
favourite recipe by the corn merchant was frowned at or even perhaps
returned to the vendor. I have long since decided that these niceties
were purely fads, and that most Pheasants will live, thrive, and even
breed on practically anything which is edible.
It must be admitted that my collection at the moment can scarcely
be called a representative one. I have two male Satyr Tragopans,
one pair and two young Edwards, two male Mikados, and two pairs
of Peacock Pheasants.
Their diet consists of one feed a day of what might be called garbage :

M. AMSLER-WAR AND OUR AVIARIES
boiled potato skins, apple skins, a very few crusts of bread with the
addition of some whole potato ; they also get a certain amount of green
vegetable such as kale, cabbage, etc., which is given raw. All this
food is given in a wet and unappetizing state, for it is, of course, im-
possible to obtain any meal, or even bran for " drying-off". Tragopans
are notedly somewhat particular as to diet, but against this we have
the knowledge that they can subsist largely on almost any kind of
fruit and also greens, incidentally they have a passion for nettles,
a herb which most gardens can spare with advantage.
It is more surprising that the little Polyplectrons have survived, for
of all Pheasants they are the least easy to get on to any kind of mash
or soft food. Notwithstanding their war diet, both pairs reared young
in 1941, and hatched, but did not fully rear, in 1942.
The Tragopans reared one chick in 1941, but last year my adult
hen died on a nest of three eggs, and I should be deeply grateful to
anyone who would care to let me have an adult hen in exchange for
a cock. Mikados have lived on war-diet, but I have since lost my hen.
Edward's have done well and a short description of their efforts may
amuse other members, as it did me at the time.
Before the war it was my habit to set all Pheasants' eggs except those
of Tragopans under bantams or light hens--since then rationing of
poultry has made the use of fosters impossible. I have perforce allowed
my Pheasants to incubate their own eggs, and the results have been
quite encouraging ; of course the saving of time and labour is un-
questionable. It is, after all, chiefly our greed and the hope for more
eggs and chicks which prompts the use of foster parents. To return to
our Edwards ; as is well known the male Edwards is a temperamental
fellow and much addicted to kill any hen to whom he has been recently
introduced. Remembering this and having a hen sitting on eggs last
spring I drove the male into an adjacent aviary, my argument being
that a bad husband would probably be a dangerous father.
In due course the eggs hatched out, the hen was an admirable mother
always brooding her chicks if one approached her, and constantly
hunting for titbits for her offspring which only received the very
inadequate menu which I have already described. All went well for
some days when my man was dismayed to find the hen walking about
and no signs of any chicks.
A stoat or a rat must be the culprit, of that we were both certain,
but on looking into the next aviary to see whether the cock was safe
we noticed him squatting low to the ground, and approaching him
to see what ailed him we were ruthlessly attacked by the old bird
who at the same time exposed the whole of his young family which
he had been so carefully covering. The explanation was that he must
have called the young to him and that they had had no difficulty
in walking through the dividing wire-netting.

After that we opened the door between the two aviaries and allowed
the birds to share their parental duties, even so the male did more
than his part.
A good deal has been written about home-grown seed. Sunflower
seed and linseed for those birds which will eat it are easy enough, but
to those who would grow their own millet and canary seed my advice
is " Don't ".
If one makes an early start, and if one has a good season, both
canary seed and millet will mature in the warmer parts of this country,
but to obtain a reasonable crop, say 56 lb. of either, is a big job and
when it has been garnered your troubles are not at an end for the ears
require threshing and the husks have to be winnowed away. I have
seen keen aviarists doing this by rubbing the ears with their fingers
and blowing the husks away. This is a slow, tiring, and breath-
taking pastime. In a warm part of the country, with quite a reasonable
knowledge of gardening, I have tried my hand and with a good deal
of labour I obtained enough seed to feed, say, two or three Canaries
or Budgerigars for a year or so, but only a drop in the ocean to what
I really required.
As I have already pointed out sunflower seed is easily grown in
sufficient quantities to keep one or two Parrots, whose diet can be
supplemented by a few toast crusts, fruit, and greenstuff. An early
start with sunflowers is a great asset in order to get well-ripened seed.
The seeds may be sown outdoors, or they can be started in boxes and
carefully pricked out 2 feet apart and 4 feet in the rows. It is a good
plan to drive a few short posts along the lines to which a wire is
stretched 3 feet to 4 feet above the ground. To this wire the plants
can be tied to prevent them from being blown over. The harvesting
of the seed-heads requires a certain nicety in choosing your time.
If you can be bothered to protect each seed-head by a piece of muslin
gathering can be deferred till the seed separates easily, but if not
a sharp look-out must be kept for Tits and other robbers. As soon as
their depredations are noticed the heads must all be cut off at once,
they can then be hung up to mature in a dry and airy place, but
even so one must look out for mice.
It may be pertinent to state here that the best possible bait for a
mouse-trap is a sunflower seed, next a small piece of bread-crust,
and last of all the time-honoured toasted cheese !

{Strix indranee indranee Sykes)
By W. C. Osman Hill, M.D., Ch.B., F.Z.S., etc.
The Wood Owls of the genus Strix are the most typical members of
the Order Strigiformes as is indicated by the fact that they have given
their name to the whole group. There are about twenty species of
them. One of these, the Ural Owl (S. uralensis ) has recently been the
subject of an interesting article in the Avicultural Magazine by
the Marquess Hachisuka and it was this that prompted me to put
on record my observations on the Ceylonese member of the genus.
They are represented in Europe by the familiar Tawny Owl {S. aluco)
which, in one form or another, ranges eastwards into the Himalayas,
where it is represented by S. a. biddulphi. Here it meets the range of
another Wood Owl, which is similar in general form to the Tawny
Owl, in so far as its main upper plumage is brown and that it lacks
ear tufts, though it is larger in general bodily proportions. This is
Strix indranee , of which the typical race is confined to Ceylon, the
Deccan, and the hilly parts of South India. It is to this form that
I shall refer below.
In Ceylon the bird appears to be moderately common from the
coastal plain up to the altitude of Nuwara Eliya, the well-known hill
station (6,000 feet) ; but it is confined to heavy forest-country and,
like all Owls, is rarely seen in the daytime, and when it does appear
attention is drawn to it by virtue of its being mobbed by Crows,
Drongos, or other pugnacious birds. It is, therefore, seldom seen in
captivity, but when it is, it makes a very desirable aviary inmate and
never fails to attract attention and provoke remark from its beautiful
downy plumage, blinking eyelids, and rich orange circumocular discs.
The general colour of the upper parts, including the crown of the
head, is a uniform dark sepia or chocolate-brown, wherein it differs
from the speckled plumage of the European species. The scapulars,
wing coverts, rump, and upper tail coverts are paler and have narrow
whitish bars. The flight feathers are dark brown with whitish transverse
bars ; whilst the rectrices are similar with narrow white cross bars
and white tips. The underparts and legs are whitish to buffy or
yellowish with very close brownish bars. Most characteristic are the
ocular discs which are of a rich golden orange, but this is individually
rather variable, though it may be due to sexual differences. There is
some whitish colour above the eyes, and around the ocular discs
there is a dark, almost black circle.
As with other species of the genus the eyes are very large and the
ear openings are larger than the eyes and very asymmetrical, the
right being larger than the left as well as somewhat differently shaped.
These openings are provided with a marginal skin-flap or operculum.

W. C. O. HILL--EXPERIENCES WITH THE BROWN WOOD OWL 47
The only sexual differences so far recorded are in size ; females
being slightly larger than the males, as in the Tawny Owl ; but it is
possible that specimens with less brightly coloured facial discs may
be females, though I have as yet had no opportunity of confirming this
by dissection or otherwise. So far I have seen only three specimens
in captivity. Two of them have had bright reddish-golden discs and
the third much duller affair.
Of the three examples with which I have had experience, one of
the bright-faced ones has been to my knowledge at least four years in
captivity, and the other slightly less. The former has been kept in
Colombo, first in the Museum Zoo and later at the Zoological Gardens
at Dehiwela. The other specimen lived in a comparatively small
cage on a tea estate at an altitude of 3,000 feet in a very wet climate.
The third specimen has been more recently acquired and is the one
upon which I have been able to make more detailed observations.
A few days after receipt this bird refused to feed itself and gradually
assumed the characteristic posture seen in Pigeons and other birds
when suffering from peripheral neuritis resulting from deficiency of
vitamin A, i.e. with its head rolled over to one side, and twisted
spirally so as to face backwards and upwards. It seemed to lose all
sense of balance and could not find its way about or feed itself. It
accordingly was fed upon chopped-up meat and an occasional insect
or piece of frog by hand. At the same time vitamin A-containing
medicaments were administered over a period of two or three months
without success. One day I was perusing the chapter on diseases in
Tavistock's well-known book on Parrots, when I came across the
section on labyrinthine vertigo, and it struck me that this was perhaps
what our Wood Owl was troubled with. I accordingly looked down
his huge ear-orifices to ascertain if there was any local irritation, but
found nothing. The animal was perfectly easy to handle and did not
make much attempt to struggle, merely showing some fright by clacking
his bill a lot ; but, of course, one had to beware of his claws, for once
a hold is obtained by these, it is very difficult to get them off again,
and they readily penetrate one's finger to a depth of half an inch or
more, leaving a very distressing perforation that can be felt in the
depths of the muscles for months afterwards.
As no local trouble was discovered in the ears I concluded that the
vertigo must originate in the internal ear (labyrinth) or in the brain.
I excluded a cerebral origin by testing the two ear orifices with cold
water instillations. I therefore adopted Tavistock's suggestion of
administering potassium iodide internally and dropping a solution
of iodine in glycerine into the ear passages.
The treatment took effect within about a week ; whether it was
the internal or the external treatment that worked I know not, but
the head gradually assumed its normal posture and, one night, I left

some food behind and behold next morning it had been eaten--after
months of hand feeding ! Improvement continued till the bird fed
itself entirely, and it was then let out into a large aviary. It relapsed, ;
however, after two or three weeks, and treatment, with some hand
feeding, had to be resumed. It escaped one night in this condition
and was recovered by its being mobbed, two mornings later, by |
Crows. Its recovery continued, however, and for the last three months \0x25A0
it has been perfectly normal.
It now feeds itself regularly, sometimes fasting for a night, but it
has completed a moult and occasionally sings after the Owls 5 usual
style of vocalization.
Incidentally it is this species which has been usually credited in
Ceylon with the ear-rending shrieks of the " Devil-bird 55 --a cry which
is supposed to resemble the wails of a human female being done to
death and with which a curious piece of Sinhalese folklore is connected.
But some authorities, like Spittel (1926, 1933) do not give credence
to this, affirming that the Devil-bird is not an Owl at all but a
Ceylonese Hawk-Eagle (. Limnatops cirrhatus ceylanensis) . This view
receives support from the fact that no one has ever heard these unearthly
cries from a captive Wood Owl. My specimen uses its voice but little,
and then gives rise only to a low pleasant musical " hoo 55 .
I must conclude with a note on the feeding of Owls in captivity.
Many imagine that fine-chopped meat, or even chunks of raw meat
will suffice for captive Owls of the larger species. This is a great
mistake, and was brought home to me very forcibly some years ago
when I did a post-mortem on a Brown Fish-Owl ( Ketupa zeylonensis )--
not my bird I am thankful to say--which had lived for a couple of
years on this diet. His gizzard was atrophied until it resembled a
flabby brown paper bag ! Owls obviously need something coarse in
their diet as is attested by their natural habit of regurgitating pellets
containing indigestible material with regularity. Pellets of different
species vary in composition, but usually contain tangled masses of
hair, feathers, scales, elytra of beetles, etc. Accordingly I suggest that,
in addition to raw meat, captive Owls should receive an occasional
rat or squirrel, small birds, large beetles of the cockchafer type--but
not cockroaches, as they are heavily parasitized--and frogs or lizards
when procurable. In addition to the epidermal coverings found in
such diet they would appear to derive great benefit from the material
found in the alimentary canal and liver of their prey.

1942 has been a very sad year for me as I had to part with most
of my beautiful rare Cranes and Geese. The large stock of food I had
before the war lasted for three years, and I could not continue feeding
the birds any longer. I am thankful to say that I was able to give
them to friends who could keep and feed them, and that they were
not destroyed. It took me just over twenty years to make this unique
collection from all over the world, and it was sad to see them go.
1 bred a good many nice birds before they left, among them Ruddy-
headed, Ashy-headed, Bar-headed, Ross's and Emperor Geese, some
crosses such as Emperor X White-cheeked and Emperor and Ross's.
The full-winged Madarins and Carolinas bred as usual, and one still
sees over a hundred of them on the ponds. The Red-breasted Geese
laid with me for the first time, but they were disturbed when the birds
were being caught up, and the eggs came to nothing. The Ducks on
the small pond still do well, and I have never seen anything so hardy
as the Eyton's Tree Ducks. I have eight of these since 1938 and they
are all still going strong in spite of some very severe winters.
The Madagascar White-backed Ducks are doing well, and they
have been here a good many years. I have only one Hottentot Teal
left and four Versicolors. It is sad to see such a few birds, and the
enclosure looks deserted. These are some of the birds I gave away
which were in the enclosure : 7 Grown Cranes, 7 Stanley Cranes,

know I had so many birds till I caught them up. No wonder the place
looks deserted. I have kept the breeding pairs of Cranes. I also had
to part with my wonderful herd of Axis deer as the ground they
occupied had to be ploughed up. I was able to catch a few and send
them to Whipsnade. The rest had to be shot. The black buck had
to be reduced as their ground was also ploughed up, but I still have
about twenty-five of them. The Wallabies are still here, and they
want very little feeding. The Black-shouldered Peafowl flourish, and
I still have a few white ones. I still have most of my aviary birds,
and was successful in rearing a Blue Alexandrine Parrakeet in addition
to some Lutino Ringnecks. The Queen Alexandra's have again
reared five healthy young ones. The Chukors did better than ever,
and I counted over sixty of them in my garden. They are delightful

SUBSTITUTE DIETS FOR INSECTIVOROUS

After twenty years of collaboration in bird-keeping, the horrors of
war and invasion brutally obliged Mr. F. Fooks and myself to part,
abandoning to the enemy our beloved park of Cleres and the
innumerable bird treasures we had established and accumulated
there--a loss which, I fear, can never be made good anywhere in
the future. As soon as the war is over I hope very much to benefit
again by his services, wherever I may be living. At the present time
Mr. Fooks has taken charge of the estate and collection of Capt. the
Hon. Henry Broughton, at Englefield Green. Captain Broughton,
now in the army, possessed at the beginning of the war a large collection
of perching birds, ranging from Humming Birds and Sun-birds to
Birds of Paradise, Kingfishers, and Parrakeets, with many extremely
rare species among them. The feeding of such delicate birds under
the present food restrictions in England is a difficult problem, in fact
most of such birds at the London Zoo did not survive the privations
of 1940. But Mr. Fooks managed to keep those in his care in excellent
condition, even rearing broods of the rare Rothschild's Grackle in
1941 and 1942 and having Touracos and Woodpeckers nest. On the
diet of his birds he writes as follows
" It gives me much pleasure in giving you a few details of a war-time
method of feeding, etc. As you know, the maintenance of a mixed
collection of birds in war-time, certainly has its problems. However,
from my experience here, I should certainly revise my old method of
feeding, if normal times were with us again to-morrow. I have most
decidedly come to the conclusion that dried flies, dried ant eggs, and
bananas (all expensive items) are unnecessary. With the exception
of a few blackberries and elderberries, no fresh fruit or dried fruit has
been used here for eighteen months or so. However, as you know,
it is impossible to generalize in the feeding of frugivorous birds, as
many of them are to a more or less extent, partly insectivorous.

Of course occasionally individual birds differ. For instance, a female
Red-crested Touraco is particularly fond of gentils. She was the only

Parrakeet would, I believe, if the opportunity was given him, live on
nothing but mealworms.

No. 1 and No. 2. Birds of Paradise, Bowerbirds, Regent birds, Trogans,
etc., three-quarters of No. 1 and one-quarter of No. 2, with a little
finely minced raw horse flesh. A few mealworms or gentils, etc.,
when available. Cissas, Rollers, Magpies, Jays, Jay-thrushes, and the
larger Glossy Starlings, seven-eighths of No. 2 and one-eighth of
No. 1, with a little raw minced horse flesh added. As we breed a
number of mice, we give them when possible, one each to most of the
above, every other day. Rollers will take and appreciate small mice.
We have a Lilac-breasted in wonderful condition. Naturally we give
a few gentils and mealworms when available. Small insectivorous
birds, No. 2 with a little of No. 1, to which is added a little finely
minced meat (heart) and live food. Small Kingfishers (Halcyon),
minced horse flesh (heart), gentils, and mealworms. Laughing
Kingfishers and Frogmouth, mice and raw horseflesh. Note : All
meat for insectivorous birds, including Cissas, Rollers, etc., is well
mixed with biscuit meal and that given to small Kingfishers just
sprinkled with it.
" I don't know if you will experience any difficulties in regard to
seed, especially canary and white millet. If so I can assure you from
my experience this year it is very easily grown, especially the former.
Canary seed : Plant end of May or early June, in rows 5 inches apart,
1 inch deep. It is a good plan to plant five rows, and then leave a
space of 1 foot. This enables one to gather as the heads are in the
ripening stage without damaging the younger growths. Do not wait
to gather until the heads are yellow, but when they are just on the
turning stage. I then place them on the stands of a greenhouse
(thinly), turning them every other day until the seed is quite hard.
Millet : Sow under similar conditions during the first fifteen days of
April. Gather the heads when just turning yellow and dry as for

It is quite remarkable to hear of such an achievement. Of course,
much depends upon the way in which these substitute foods are
mixed and it is all important that the mixture be always dry enough

Bird Migration. By A. Landsborough Thomson, C.B., D.Sc.
Price Published by H. F. and G. Witherby, Ltd., 326 High
Holborn, London, W.C. 1.
In this second edition of Bird Migration , Dr. Landsborough Thomson
has revised and brought up to date his book published in 1936. The
author has that, unfortunately far from common, gift of a dead
accuracy of detail, no matter how small, coupled with an easy interest-
ing style which makes his writings most readable and impressive on
the mind. He deals with a large and fascinating branch of ornithology
from all its angles, and the book gives a comprehensive survey of the
whole subject. The author opens with a brief historical sketch,
mentioning the fantastic theories of where migrant birds passed the
winter, and tracing the gradual development of the study of bird
migration to the present time, when its importance is being ever
more widely recognized. He continues to describe the different types
of migration, directions, seasons, influences of weather, speed, causes
and use of migration, and the experiments and work that are being
carried on in various parts of the world to solve these problems. Par-
ticularly interesting is the chapter " What Guides Migration " in
which he discusses visual recognition, flight without landmarks,
" Homing powers," " Sense of direction," and the hereditary factor.
The book is illustrated by 7 photographic plates and 13 maps, and a
short list of general works on migration is also included. Though not
perhaps of primary interest to aviculturists Dr. Landsborough
Thomson's book should certainly appeal to all those who take a wider
interest in birds generally, and presents a complicated subject in a
concise and easily assimilated form.

Breeding Results in Chicago

Each year I tell you something of our breeding results, but there is very little to
relate for 1942. Our Parrots were a great disappointment. Our old reliable Queen
Alexandras failed us completely for the first time. They have raised for us thirteen
beautiful young in the past four years. We noticed the female dragging her leg
one day and on catching her up we saw that the foot was hanging by a piece of skin
so that terminated any success from her. There were several eggs scattered about in
the nest log. Abominably cold weather and much rain may have had something to
do with the lack of interest shown by most of our breeders. 28th September had
a temperature of 29 degrees while twenty-four hours later it was 72 degrees and the
next day 82 degrees. All of our Parrot-like birds and many others as well had to
be taken in three weeks earlier than usual. Our faithful old King Parrots raised three
nice young and the Red-rumped Parrakeets two. The Hawk-headed Parrots laid
three eggs but they were clear, the Crimson-wings hatched two but deserted them
after a few days--they were dead when discovered, and the same thing happened
to our Swainson's Lorikeets. This is the first year we have not had at least two from
them. Rosellas, Turquoisines, Bourke's, and Lories all were failures, and our female
Eclectus died egg-bound. Four good blue shells came through all right but we accept
them as a matter of course.
A pair of Silver Gulls raised a nice young one--they never have had more than
one at a time. Two fine young Barnacle Geese and a hybrid Barnacle (male) X
Canada (female), the mother being a very large bird. The young bird has the
brownish colour of the Canada, but the black of the neck does not terminate as it
does in the latter bird. Instead the black neck fades into slate colour on the chest
(still sharply defined against the dusky under parts). With the exception that the
cheek patches are like the Canada's the pattern is like that of the Barnacle Goose
There is also a narrow white line across the forehead. We also raised Black Swan,
several Finches, outstanding of which were Cordon-bleus, and some Pheasants.
A very generous gift to the Society came from Mr. Edward Krug, who is also a
member of your Society. His gift consisted of about eighty-five birds, many of which
were new to our collection. Such as fine Callistes, Tanagers, Thrushes, Bulbuls, and
Pittas as well as a number of the commoner aviary birds.
Karl Plath.
Aviculture in South Africa
Here in South Africa we are not nearly so hard pressed as you are in England, and
we often wonder how you are able to keep your birds alive with the scarcity of seeds
and other foods . . . Aviculturists in England have our deepest sympathy as do all
the other people. Here, although we are very fortunate in that we have not ex-
perienced even one " air blitz ", the war has, nevertheless, made itself felt. In Cape-
town, for instance, commodities have become very scarce and many impossible to
obtain, and all are three, four, and five times as expensive as pre-war. Bird seed is
four or five times the normal price and very difficult to procure, especially in sufficient
quantities for a large number of birds. Even seeds grown in this country, such as
canary, have become scarce through drought in the land. Some seeds such as niger,
Jap millet, and teastle, are quite unprocurable. In addition to these difficulties
there is the question of insufficient time and a scarcity of labour.
I have to leave home early in the morning, and never know when I shall return,
but it is never before dark, and I seldom see my home in daylight, and the birds
can get no attention from me. Our bird attendant, after nearly fourteen years of
faithful service, suddenly disappeared, and is now a prisoner of war in Italy, and
we have been unable to obtain another all-time man. If we get the services of a
man for one day in a month, we consider ourselves very lucky. So my wife has
battled along on her own, maintaining law and order as best she can, but, notwith-
standing her obstacles and difficulties, she has to her credit for the season nests of
young Gouldians, Painted Finches, Bengalese, White Zebras, Transvaal Pretji
Canaries (Serinus angolensis ), Red-headed Parrot Finches, Long-tailed Grass Finches,
and Star Finches. Others that bred and had young in the nest but did not rear them
to maturity were the South American Red-crested Finch and the Red Hooded Siskin,
a great disappointment, especially the latter. Two nests were made and young

hatched, but on each occasion, when a day or two old, they were carried from the
nest and dropped into the water. We were hoping for better results next time, and
had planned to separate the cock as soon as there were young in the nest, but,
unfortunately, the little hen did not survive our severe winter, so we are left with
the lone cock which ends our hopes of breeding Hooded Siskins for the duration.
Out latest acquisition is an Indian Shama ( Kattocincla malabarica) , a really fine
specimen and easily the most entertaining bird we have ever had. He is beautifully
tame and confiding, and a great mimic and acrobat. He imitates the song of the
Thrush, Blackbird, Nightingale, Skylark, Bacbakiri Shrike, Gape Robin, Fiscal
Shrike, Yorkshire Canary, and many others too numerous to mention. He even
imitates a puppy crying and a kitten mewing. He loves company, and is never
too proud to entertain his admirers with something or other.

The Passing of Two Old Friends
I have had the misfortune to lose my Rosenberg Lorikeet ( Trichoglossus rosenbergi)
through congestion and oedema of the lungs while on deposit at the London Zoo.
I think my bird was the one in the Duke of Bedford collection in 1931. While in
Mr. Partridge's possession he crossed the Rosenberg with a hen Swainson Lorikeet,
which produced fine healthy youngsters; so far as I have been able to ascertain this
bird has never been bred pure in captivity.
I have compared my specimen with the two specimens in the Bird Room of the
Natural History Museum; it only differs from them in having its tail partly yellow,
it being changed about a fortnight before its death. I hope when the war is won to
obtain a true pair of these birds, so I may breed them in captivity. There is a fine
plate of this bird in Mivart's Monograph of Lories, and another in a very scarce work,
Rosenberg (C. B. H. von), Reistochen naar de Geelrinkbaai op Nieuw-Guinea, 1867-yo.
That exquisite gem, the Ruby Lory ( Vinia kuhli ) from Washington and Fanning
Islands, another Zoo inhabitant, has also died; she was imported in 1935, and there
is a coloured plate of this bird and article by Monsieur Delacour in the Avicultural
Magazine for 1936. There are some living ones in Mr. W. Sheffer's collection in
California. In the Bird Room of the Natural History Museum, there are three
specimens of this bird.

Dr. Amsler wrote some time ago, " There is no known substitute for mealworms,'
probably most bird keepers agree with him.
Looking to the future. Why should we in this country depend on foreigners to
supply us with mealworms ? Is it not possible for the Avicultural Society to get the
societies working for the disabled members of the Forces interested in this trade ?
Probably the Dutch Embassy could find a Dutch refugee who was engaged in Holland
in this trade who would be willing to act as instructor or manager. Failing this
scheme could a small syndicate be formed to breed and supply us bird keepers direct;
if necessary the trade could be supplied at a slightly lower price.
It was the members of the trade who opposed any scheme for home production
in case of offending the Dutch breeders; in other words it would have put paid to
the trade's nice little 300 per cent profit.

ARTIFICIAL GOOSE NESTS
AN EXPERIMENT ON THE BREEDING PSYCHOLOGY OF
WILD GEESE
By John Berry
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.998303551724138" page_id="56350741"  page_num="" year="" vol="">
Although the True Geese do not display brilliant plumage or
spectacular diversity of form, they make up for these deficiencies by
their unique psychogony. One of the most interesting aspects of this
character is the way in which Geese--either individually or collectively
as a flock--may suddenly and unexpectedly change their hitherto
regular habits. A surprising example of this occurred in a flock of
tame Wild Geese at Tayfield, Fife, during the summer of 1942.
The Geese live in a park which is adequate for them throughout
most of the year, but it lacks any ground resembling the nesting
territories natural to most species. This was considered the chief
reason why very few of the Geese in the park had ever nested, for in
another collection of Geese kept in almost ideal natural surroundings
not many miles away, breeding had been fairly regular. Because of
wartime difficulties, some breeding pairs from that collection were
transferred to the park in 1941, but it was not expected that they
would continue to breed there. Moreover, in 1942, nesting seemed
likely to be still further discouraged as the Geese were much disturbed
by other purposes for which the park was being used. Also, the ground
was unusually bare ; following the severe winter, the grass was
grazed as close as a mown lawn, and although in some places withered
leaves had been blown by the gales into drifts feet deep, most of the
park was swept clean. This, however, was not thought to be a factor
of importance, since most of the Geese were tundra-breeding species
which do not normally make elaborate nests.
Among the Geese who had lived in the park for several years was
" Old Mother Goose "--a Caithness Greylag. She had proved
herself a regular breeding bird and, following the usual habit of her
species, had chosen to nest in thick cover. In 1939, her nest was
made in a dense patch of rhododendrons in a plantation of Norway

spruce at one end of the park. In 1940, she nested in precisely the
same spot, and although a different site was chosen in 1941, it was
in the same corner of the wood. In each case the nest consisted of a
large collection of withered leaves, spruce-needles, and moss, in which
the eggs were never left uncovered. Conditions in the spruce planta-
tion were unaltered in 1942, and there was therefore every reason to
expect that " Mother Goose " would nest there again as in former
seasons.
The first Goose egg of the 1942 season was found on 30th April.
This egg was in a bare earth scrape, devoid of any nesting material,
at the root of a large gean tree which stands in an exposed situation
far from any bushes or other cover. Although the egg looked like
that of a Greylag, it was difficult to believe that such a site could have
been chosen by any of the Greylags in the park flock. An uncovered
egg in so exposed a position seemed unlikely to escape for long the
attention of Gulls, Crows, and other enemies. I therefore collected an
armful of moss and pine-needles from under a Bhutan pine not far off,
and at the risk of making the unknown Goose desert, covered the egg
lightly and left the rest of the pine-needles near the nest in hopes that
the Goose would make use of them herself. On the following morning,
there on the nest was " Old Mother Goose 55 ! She had used the whole
of the material provided to make a large nest, and when she left it
some time later, after laying another egg, the eggs were well covered
in the usual manner.
This unexplained change of nesting habits on the part of an
individual Greylag was to be followed by a collective flock reaction
which was even more interesting. About an hour after " Old Mother
Goose " had left her now conspicuous nest, attention was again drawn
to it by the sounds of a fight. A Barnicle Goose, who had never
before attempted to breed, was sitting on the nest endeavouring to
resist the efforts of the rightful owner to drag her off, while the
respective ganders were fighting furiously. Our arrival scattered
the combatants and on going to the nest, I found that the Barnicle
Goose had already laid an egg in it. As the Greylag would not allow
the Barnicle to share her nest, I made another nest, as like it as I
could, under the near-by pine tree, and in this I left the Barnicle's
egg uncovered. I thought it just possible that when the Barnicle
found herself driven repeatedly from the Greylag's nest, she might
adopt the other similar nest in which she could see her first egg. But
we were given no opportunity for studying the reactions of the
Barnicles to the decoy nest, for they had not come back when a pair
of Lesser Snow Geese arrived on the scene. The female soon noticed
the egg in the artificial nest, and having called her mate, they began
to walk round the nest and inspect it suspiciously from every angle.
After the inspection had lasted for about ten minutes, the Goose

cautiously climbed on to the nest and sat down on the egg. She then
began to pull the nesting material about, and made a real nest of it,
Goose-fashion. It was at this point that the pair of Barnicles returned.
The Lesser Snow gander saw that they did not come near the new nest,
and after a battle with the Greylag gander, the Barnicles withdrew
discomfited, and during the rest of the season they made no further
attempt at nesting.
I had to leave home that night, but before going, I made five more
artificial nests in the general neighbourhood of the first. These nests
were mere hollows scraped out with a trowel at the roots of large
trees, and provided with an armful of withered leaves, moss, and
pine-needles, roughly in the form of a Goose's nest. On my return
home for a day a week later, I was delighted to find that one nest
had been adopted by a pair of Blue Snow Geese and another by a pair
of Barnicles. Both females were sitting on the nests with their ganders
on guard beside them. The material of the other three artificial nests
was scattered about and beside one disarranged nest was an egg,
cold and dirty, showing that the site had been adopted and then
deserted. The Geese sitting on nests were being frequently disturbed
by other pairs which seemed intent on seizing the nest by force, and
violent battles were fought round the nests. In one of these, five
pairs of Geese took part, and a Barnicle was all but killed by a Chinese
gander who, during fifteen years in the park, had earned a reputation
for extreme peacefulness even when guarding a family.
In an effort to stop this behaviour and to satisfy the apparent desire
for ready made nests, I filled a large wheelbarrow with nesting
material consisting of straw, hay, grass, withered leaves, moss, and
pine-needles, thoroughly intermingled. With this I set about making
imitation Goose nests in large numbers. The majority were at the
roots of trees, but others were in cover, beside small bushes, and right
out in the open, so that the Geese should have a wide choice of sites.
Among the Geese is an old and extremely tame Bean Goose.
Although she had made no attempt to nest, she had already dropped
three eggs at random. This suggested that probably none of her eggs
would be fertile, but even so it seemed desirable that she should be
encouraged to sit on them. I therefore made a large nest and left
the dropped eggs in it uncovered, but she evinced as little interest
in the nest as she had in the eggs lying in the open. More for the
amusement of onlookers than with any expectation of success, I caught
the Bean Goose, carried her to the nest, and dumped her on top of
the eggs. This Goose is quite accustomed to being picked up, so she
did not object to such treatment. But I was much surprised when,
instead of at once getting off the nest, she sat down on the eggs quite
complacently. She was, however, uncomfortable. She sat first one
way and then another, and finally pulled my nest all apart and remade

an entirely new nest to her own liking, while her mate stood on guard
beside her. In this nest she completed a clutch of five eggs on which
she sat for many weeks, although, as I had feared, all proved to be
" clears
The reactions of the other pairs of geese to the artificial nests were
watched with increasing interest. Some sites were overlooked, but
others in more prominent positions were inspected almost as soon
as I withdrew from working on them, and one Blue Snow had laid
an egg in a nest within two hours of its construction. Quarrelling
and fighting still continued to some extent, but since plenty of sites
well-supplied with suitable nesting material were now available, pairs
of Geese which were having the worse of an argument, seemed to
prefer to inspect another nest rather than to force a decision through
trial by combat.
I left home after my day of nest-making with hopes that many of
my sites would soon be occupied by nesting Geese. Although these
hopes were not altogether disappointed, the progress of the psycho-
logical experiment was seriously upset in an unforeseen manner. The
end of the park in which most of the nests were made was within
the range of wandering domestic poultry. The hay seed and some
grain with the straw in the nesting material may have been added
bait, but the hens soon decided that these nests were excellent spots
in which to scrape for food, and any nest not occupied by a sitting
Goose or guarded by her gander during the long hours of daylight
when the hens were foraging, was soon completely scattered. Some
Geese were seen more than once remaking their nests and collecting
their scattered eggs. But the hens made more than half of them desert
before completing incubation, and they were probably responsible
for the failure to hatch of at least nine fertile eggs incubated for the full
period. Yet the proportion of the Geese which had commenced
nesting was larger than ever before, and it included five species,
namely Greylag, Bean, Lesser Snow, Blue Snow, and Barnicle.
Apart from the Greylag " Old Mother Goose ", all the Geese which
nested did so in the artificial nests. The composition and quantity
of nesting material were approximately the same in each case, but the
nature of the sites varied considerably. Altogether fifteen sites were
adopted, if only for a few days, out of about forty provided with
artificial nests. It was, therefore, interesting to find that the only site
occupied in or near any kind of cover was the nest to which the very
tame Bean Goose was carried. This nest was in a clump of Escallonia,
beside an elm stump.
With one exception, all the other sites adopted were at the roots
of a large tree. The exception was a nest in a charred tree-stump right
out in the open. This hollow stump was occupied by a three-year-old
Barnicle Goose who sat on four unfertile eggs until they were removed

on 11 th July. Although latterly two Pink-footed ganders were usually
on guard near her nest, the Goose had no real mate, and she may
have chosen this isolated site because there appeared to be no other
competitors.
The trees at which nests were adopted were all more than a yard in
diameter, so perhaps the sitting Geese like to have something large
and solid behind them. But there was no noticeable discrimination
as to the kind of tree or type of stem ; nor did the immediate surround-
ings of the nest seem of concern. Apparently the Geese were as well
satisfied with a nest sunk in a deep recess between the sprawling roots
of a giant silver fir, as with another raised a foot above surrounding
ground-level on a mound of stones and turf beside the cylindrical bole
of an oak. But it seemed evident that all the Geese preferred a site
from which the gander at least could command an extensive view.
No site where this was impracticable appeared to be considered.
While the Geese were sitting, their ganders remained on guard
beside them and drove away all comers with reckless courage. The
area guarded by the gander was large when the nest was isolated,
but a pair of Blue Snows and two pairs of Barnicles which nested at
the roots of three adjoining trees only short distances apart, seemed
content to guard an area not more than fifteen feet in radius.
Perhaps the most interesting feature of this unusual nesting
behaviour, was the way in which " Mother Goose's " nesting in so
prominent a position seemed to have released the previously un-
demonstrated nesting urge of the other Geese. If their desire to nest
had been subconsciously inhibited by the lack of suitably natural
conditions in the park, this appeared to have been more than com-
pensated by the sight of the nesting Greylag, and by the provision
of the artificial nests. But possibly the construction of nests was less
important than the convenient disposition of supplies of nesting
material, for the previous scarcity of this may also have contributed
to discourage nesting. On the other hand, there were at least a few
suitable nesting sites at which material had been plentiful throughout.
Under the Bhutan Pine, for example, there was a carpet of pine-
needles, yet no attempt at nesting there was noticed until the con-
struction of the first artificial nest containing the Barnicle's egg, which
was almost immediately adopted by the Lesser Snows.
There is no knowing what nesting behaviour may obtain at Tayfield
in 1943. But, if possible, the artificial nest procedure will be repeated
and the reactions of the Geese watched with interest. Meanwhile,
the owners of Geese which seldom breed may care to try the fantastic
experiment of decoy nest-making, for themselves.

By J. Delacour
In the Proceedings of the VUIth International Ornithological
Congress (Oxford, 1934), I have proposed a new classification of the
Waterfowl ( Anatidae ). There I gave my reasons for separating under
the name of Perching Ducks ( Cairininae ) a group of birds which had
so far been scattered among the different subfamilies of Geese and
surface-feeding Ducks.
Waterfowl of this group resemble Geese in certain ways ; they have
a well developed thumb ; their claws are very sharp, and the tail is
long and broad. They are brightly coloured, with a great deal of
metallic sheen, and their legs are set more forward than in other
Ducks. They all have the habit of nesting in the hollows of trees,
often at a great height, just like the Golden-eyes and Mergansers,
of which they are certainly close relatives. Their behaviour, actions,
and display also are peculiar, very different from those of Geese and
Duck of other groups. They all perch readily, and I have seen trees
loaded with Spur-wings ( Plectropterus ) in West Africa. In Asia, the
White-winged Ducks ( Asarcornis ) are usually found in tall forest trees
during the day, as are also Hartlaub's Ducks in Africa and the wild
Muscovies in Tropical America. The last three birds, as well as the
Comb-ducks ( Sarkidiornis ) do not pair up as other waterfowl always
do. On my ponds, where they were practically at liberty, males and
females lived in flocks and the matings took place apparently without
any personal selection, usually after violent pursuits and struggles.
The voice of these birds differs in the two sexes ; they are usually
silent, the males being often almost mute. The chicks are easily
distinguished in shape from all other ducklings, except Golden-eyes
and Mergansers, in having a long tail, short legs set well forward, and
very sharp nails which enable them to climb with great ease. They
vary greatly in colour.
The Australian Magpie Goose ( Anseranas ) and the African Spur-
winged Goose ( Plectropterus) are the only long-legged members of the
sub-family. They both love to sit in large parties on the small limbs
of the tallest trees, usually choosing those bare of leaves.
I always kept some Magpie Geese, and I consider them quaint and
interesting in spite of many faults. I must confess that they look
rather ungainly ; they are rather susceptible to cold weather, and as
far as I know they have never nested in captivity. Furthermore, I
suspect them of eating eggs, as I found a pair one day foraging in the
nest of a Goscoroba Swan, whose eggs had been broken. Otherwise,
they are completely harmless to other birds.
I dislike Spur-wings intensely. I find them extremely ugly, with

their huge coarse feet and bill of a sickly purplish pink. All the males
I ever possessed proved the savagest bullies one could imagine. One
pair I received, of the pied race, which is also the most disagreeable
of the two, started immediately chasing all other waterfowl, doing
their best to kill them the very moment they were let out in the park.
They were promptly removed, and later on I just occasionally kept
an odd female for the sake of having the species represented in the
collection. The black race is less ill-tempered and better-looking,
but hardly worth keeping all the same.
Next to the Spur-wings, the Muscovies are the most dangerous
Ducks in this group to other birds. I do not mean domestic Muscovies,
that vilest of fowls, but the very handsome wild birds from Central
South America, light of build, with hardly any coruncles showing,
and clad in magnificent metallic green and purple. I possessed an
excellent strain of them and bred a good many each year, but I had to
keep them apart, three and four drakes and twelve to fifteen ducks
together, as they are polygamous. They need a good deal of room,
and mine shared a large field, crossed by a stream, with a pair of
Manchurian Cranes and a herd of deer.
The White-winged Wood-duck ( Asarcornis ) is found from Assam to
Indochina and Malaysia, never very commonly. It is strictly a forest
species. Almost as large as the Muscovy, and of much the same
shape, it is quaint if not really beautiful. It was very scarce in collec-
tions till 1934, when a good many pairs were imported into Holland
from Siam. I brought over some myself from Laos in 1932, and
Mr. A. Ezra received some from Assam at about the same time. We
found them hardy and harmless on a large lake, but they never
attempted to breed, although they mated freely. The only success
with them was that of Mr. D. G. Schuyl 1 who reared five young in
1936, near Rotterdam, from a pair imported in 1934, and housed in
a small pen. They did not breed again in the following year, and
this record remains unique.
I never could procure any Hartlaub's Duck (Pteronetta ), the smaller
African representative of the two above species. It is a beautiful
bird, rich chestnut with a black head and white forehead, and slate
blue shoulders. One female brought from the Ivory Coast lived three
or four years in the Paris Museum Zoo in the nineteen-twenties, and
there was recently another specimen at the Antwerp Zoo. I never
saw or heard of any more being kept in captivity.
Both Comb Ducks, the African-Asiatic (S. melanotos) and the South
American (S. sylvatica) are very similar, mere subspecies of the same
species ; the former is slightly larger and lighter in colour. They
are polygamous like the Muscovies. I found that if there were more
or less the same numbers of males and females on the lake, the latter

were persecuted and often killed during the breeding season, which
occurs in the middle of the summer. I usually kept five or six drakes
and twenty or twenty-five ducks. They proved hardy and fairly
harmless to other birds in spite of their peculiar and rather aggressive
attitudes ; but they did not really hurt anything, and it was all part
of their display. Comb Ducks are poor breeders as a rule, and it was
only in the summer of 1939, after almost twenty years, that my birds
started to lay. Seven eggs were deposited in the nest of a Maned
Goose located up on the hill in the corner of a small animal shelter ;
they all hatched, and the young were reared. Later on we found
that three belonged to the South American and four to the African-
Asiatic race. Probably two females had used the same nest ; if only
one had laid, she must then have mated with males of both forms, the
young taking entirely from one or the other parent, as they did not
show any intermediate characters.
Mandarins and Carolina (Aix) are too well known to be mentioned
here at any length. We kept and bred many, and there was always
a number of full-winged birds in the park. They belong most
distinctly to the present group, as well in their shape as in their habits.
The Brazilian Teal ( Amazonetta ) is also one of them, a fact which
has long escaped ornithologists. This charming bird did exceedingly
well at Cleres, proving hardy and prolific, and we reared a large
number annually, over thirty certain seasons. There is a good deal
of individual variation in the colour of both sexes, even in the same
brood. I doubt that the birds described by Dr. Derscheid as Schuyl's
Teal can really be recognized as a distinct species ; it may, however,
be a local race. Although I tried with several pairs, I never found
the Brazilian Teal to be a good stayer full-winged. It is a pity, as
their outspread wings constitute their greatest ornament, being
entirely glossy blue-green.
The last genus of the Perching Ducks ( Nettapus ) is that of the tiny
and short-legged Pigmy Geese or Cotton Teal, perhaps the most
attractive and prettiest of all waterfowl, and certainly the smallest.
The Indian species, whose territory extends as far east as China,
the Dutch East Indies, the Philippines, and north-east Australia, has
often been imported. The late Hubert Astley kept for many years
a pair presented by Mr. A. Ezra, who also has been the donor of most
of the specimens that I possessed. They are extremely difficult to
transport, and on account of their reduced size it is not easy to accom-
modate them, as they must be kept in vermin-proof pens. I tried
many pinioned birds on the lake at Cleres, but they sooner or later
disappeared, killed by rats and other pests. When deprived of their
power of flight, they fall an easy prey to them as they can hardly walk
at all, and do not swim very fast. I found that they were doing best
full-winged in good-sized aviaries enclosing ponds. Being naturally

shy birds, they must have a cosy, well planted run. Some large
flights I had built over a running stream proved excellent for this
species and other small Teal. They lived long there, and proved
reasonably hardy in ordinary winters with no other shelters than
open coops. Only in the terrible winter of 1939-1940 did they suffer.
They never attempted to nest at any time, although the drakes took
up regularly their breeding dress, called, and displayed.
I never could obtain the Green Cotton Teal, or Pigmy Goose, from
Northern Australia and New Guinea, and I think that only one
specimen was ever imported. It was brought over by Mr. W. Good-
fellow, and lived only a short time at Walcot Hall.
On the contrary, I have been fairly successful with the lovely
African Pigmy Goose, probably the most beautiful of all waterfowl,
which has always been very scarce in captivity. It certainly is very
hard to bring over and to accommodate. After unsuccessful attempts,
Mr. G. S. Webb and myself landed three from Madagascar in 1929.
In 1936 Mr. Webb brought a dozen more from the same place, and
in between he also imported two or three from East Africa ; most of
these birds came to Cleres. We first tried to acclimatize them in
indoor pens, but they very soon died. The last four pairs, however,
arrived in perfect condition in wire-bottomed cages, and were released
at once in one of the special Teal aviaries. There they did very well,
living over three years. Once established they are rather stronger
than Cotton Teal. Small seeds and duckweed are necessary to them.
They proved hardy in normal winters, and they displayed and looked
perfectly happy, but they never attempted to nest.
Now all these rare Ducks, well established at the cost of great
pains, have disappeared, and I cannot help looking to the past with
bitter regrets. I doubt that we shall ever see the like of it again.
Only a few days ago, I was shown a coloured film of Cleres, taken in
1937 by an American friend. All the wonderful animals and birds,
the trees, the plants, the lawns, the lake came to life again for a few
moments. It was sad to realize how little of it exists to-day, after fire,
bombs, and invasion have each in turn destroyed a part of what I had
taken so much care and trouble to build up. But, after all, it is the
fate of all human enterprises in our dreary world.
I should like, in the end, to emphasize the importance for British
aviculturists to keep up a sufficient breeding stock of the rarer water-
fowl. The continental European collections have probably ceased to
exist, and there are none in America quite comparable to those of the

Geese, like other birds, depend for their health on correct feeding,
and though more easily kept do require a considerable area of grazing,
and this is not so readily obtained as one might think, for they require
the right type of grazing. This should be short old pasture in which
wild white clover abounds ; buttercup and plantains are also
appreciated, and of course, this pasture should lie close to water.
In winter if the ground be snow-covered to any depth, some species
such as Barnicle, Brent, and Red-breasted, who probably depend more
on grazing than other kinds, should have some ground kept free of
snow ; we used to run a snow plough over the grass and then brush it.
Grit is, of course, as important as food, and it seems that Geese prefer
very small grit, even smaller than that taken by Duck. Obviously
water must be clean and fresh, and if these points are attended to, little
else is required. If one wishes one's birds to nest, the question of
nesting sites arises, a matter in which Geese are particular about ;
they look for and try to obtain the kind of nesting site they would
expect to find in Nature. Our Barnicle, for example, always nested
on the one length of fairly steep bank available to them ; Blue Snow
nested in the open, often on the barest of ground, but Grey Geese
would nest in fairly rough cover, generally near to some low bushes,
and so on.
Usually the nest of all Geese until the clutch is completed is the
barest scrape, and as the eggs are laid, more and more grass is laid
over and round the eggs. I remember once a visitor wished to get a
photograph of a Blue Snow's nest in which, if I remember rightly, only
two or three eggs had then as yet been laid. The site was at the edge
of a path worn in rather short grass ; I pointed it out, but so well was
it concealed that he could not realize where it was until he put his
foot into it, fortunately only breaking one egg. I myself remember
the first nest we had of Cackling that was so well hidden we did not
find it until the Goose started to incubate, though it was very much
in the open and at a place that several of us passed daily. On the
other hand, some nests, such as those of Canada and Gereopsis, are
often very conspicuous. If one allows the Geese to rear their own
young the question of feeding does not arise, for they will take the
goslings to the best grazing, from which one can learn much. Greylag
when young are probably the easiest to cater for, as they seem to eat
any grass if short and sweet enough, but some species are more par-
ticular, Barnicle look for and prefer wild white clover. Snows for
the first two or three days will look for and catch a certain amount

of insects, and one Goose, a Blue Snow, who was allowed to rear her
own brood once, I noticed kept her young more on the water than
one would have expected where the young feed on water weeds. As
the young grow and the season advances, goslings show a preference
for the seed heads of grass, but we give no grain to any kinds until
quite full grown ; like adults, though, they require and consume
quantities of grit. We found the best time to pinion young
birds was on the day they hatched, as there is then no bleeding
and, I think, little or no pain. The difficulty of allowing Geese to
rear their own young is that if one has a number of breeding pairs
with young, the parents will not allow broods to mix or even come
near each other, and are very likely, indeed almost sure, to kill them ;
after a week or two the young learn to keep close by their own parents,
but often they do not learn until too late.
If kept with Duck, the Geese will not as a rule disturb the Duck,
with the exception, of course, of Gereopsis and Upland, two quarrel-
some species who are best kept alone. I tried keeping Geese with
various kinds of Swans--Mute, Whooper, Bewick, Black, and Black-
necked--with varying results. Mute are hopeless, and to my mind
should be classed as vermin ; they will kill anything. Whooper did
no harm, but then I never had a breeding pair, so possibly it was no
test. Bewick in the spring started to kill the adult Geese, and did
much damage. Black were a dubious proposition, some pairs were
all right, others were not. Black-necked reared their young in a pen
with several kinds of Geese who also reared their young, and the only
losses were from Geese killing Geese. Geese during incubation vary
in their habits, and it is difficult to be exact and sure in one's state-
ments, but as far as I could observe the only two species that sat
their full incubation periods without coming off the nest to feed were
Bean and Barnicle, and possibly Cackling. Most of the other kinds
would come off, but at no regular interval, and as far as one could
observe, not even daily except in the case of Greylag, who did come
off daily to feed.
We are often faced with the problem of hybrids ; normally, if Geese
are kept, even in pairs, this should not occur, but there are some closely
allied to each other, such as Blue and Lesser Snow, White-fronted and
Greylag, that are prone to cross. It is noticeable that such crosses
or hybrids are seldom, if ever, an improvement in colour or shape on
either parent. Only once have we had hybrids that were more beautiful
than the parent birds, and they were not Geese but hybrids from an
Egyptian gander and a Ruddy Shelduck; they were very beautiful,
but such bad-tempered and determined killers they had to be destroyed.
There are always exceptions to every rule, and such a case occurred
when a Barnicle gander, one of eleven pairs in the enclosure, mated
with a Greylag Goose, who also had a mate of her own ; four young

were reared, intermediate in size of their parents, and in appearance I
rather closely resembling Canada. Illness in Geese is on the whole
not to be expected, though after a very severe and prolonged winter
one may have to expect some cases of avian consumption. The most
dread disease we were afflicted with was cases of " feather eating
mite 5 5 caught from the hens when birds were hand-reared or from
birds brought from other places so afflicted. I found no real cure,
unless at an early stage the eaten feathers and a safety margin round
were all carefully picked off, a slow and laborious business, and one
not pleasant for the bird. Last year a pair of Red-breasted had the
complaint rather badly, and not wishing to handle and frighten
them, I left them alone; after their moult in July-August the new
feathers came, and showed no signs of being eaten, but just as I write
I see a small bare patch again starting on the breast of one of them.
Another possible trouble and rather difficult to overcome is that
of the Goose who sits her full incubation period without feeding, and
is naturally very weak when the young are hatched, and unable to
stand up to possible fights, and lies open to avian consumption if
bad or cold weather should follow her hatching. I lost a Black-necked
Swan once who sat her full six weeks and never, that I could see,
fed ; she hatched and reared her young, but gradually got weaker
and weaker until she died.
It has been my experience that if conditions are suitable, Geese
reared by their parents and left full winged will stay where reared,
and it is a very beautiful sight to see such birds flying round. When
peace comes, so much has been planned and talked of to improve life
in Britain, how nice a thought it would be if we could do likewise for
some of our wild life ! Surely there must be many who would like
to see sanctuary formed where water and marsh could be stocked
with just a few pairs of such birds as Greylag, Bean, and Whooper,
which, if pinioned, would breed, and their young full-winged would
remain and populate such areas ! Gan we not even hope for a few pairs
of hand-reared Bustard again to start the lost race of what was one
of our most beautiful and stately birds. Britain alone lags behind in
such matters.

The other day I had lunch with a friend of mine just back from the
South Pacific war. He had spent a few weeks on Guadalcanal in the
centre of that small but incredibly vicious turmoil. As usual our talk
turned to birds.
" I was so surprised to notice some little brown Ducks in a marsh
down near the sea," he said. " Cockatoos and megapodes look all
right in that atmosphere, but somehow not Ducks."
The small island form of the Australian Duck, Anas superciliosa
pelewensis , is found from Celebes, in the Indies, all the way to Tahiti,
a range of several thousand miles. I remember spending a morning
in a big swamp at the north-east corner of the island of Moorea, a few
miles away from Tahiti. My young Tahitian guide and I crawled
through a veritable morass of quaking mud and sharp projecting
pandanus roots to come out finally on a shallow lake, long and narrow,
covered with floating plants and logs and rushes, an ideal duckpond.
My guide produced a small pirogue and with silent paddle strokes
we eased out gently into the water.
It was one of those lazy summer mornings. The sun was just
beginning to become hot. There was a slow buzzing in the air as of
many sleepy satisfied insects, and far off I could hear a little wild
rooster crowing in the underbush. Suddenly there was a swish and
a patter, and then a whicker of wings, and there were my first
Australian Ducks. They began to go up from all around us in the
reeds. They marshalled themselves into a flock and flew up towards
the clear sky, then turned suddenly and came down towards us with
a rush and a whistle, only to veer off again and turn out toward the
sea. Their green specula bordered with white glinted in the sun.
I counted about two hundred as they went off in formation.
These little Ducks are not uncommon in collections, although they
have never been very popular. For one thing the male and female are
coloured alike, dull chocolaty-brown with paler brown cheeks and a
black stripe running through the eye. The last gives them a curious
masked effect. I have always liked them though, because they are
graceful and pleasant little Ducks, and because they remind me so
strongly of a certain warm and lazy morning on Moorea.
The most mysterious of all the Pacific waterfowl is Coues' Gadwall,
Anas strepera couesi, only two specimens of which have ever been
found, on Washington Island, more than six hundred miles south of
Hawaii. The two specimens, the male type and a female, collected
in 1874, are now in the U.S. National Museum in Washington. In
appearance these birds are simply Gadwalls reduced to about two-
thirds normal size. The plumage too is rather dull and somewhat

unfinished-looking. Washington Island is a marshy place only a
few miles long, with a small brackish lake near the centre and a fringe
of palms. Since the original pair of birds were discovered, several
expeditions have stopped at the island, but no one has ever seen
Goues' Gadwall again. Speculation is perhaps unprofitable, but
sometimes it is irresistible. I often like to wonder how these birds
ever came to Washington Island. It is my guess, for what it is worth,
that these two specimens represent the last of a very small inbred
breeding population of true Gadwalls which by an accident of migra-
tion had become established on the island. I suspect that their size
and coloration are due to environment and inbreeding rather than to
any genetic change.
It sometimes happens that migrating Ducks plummet down on to
isolated islands in the Pacific. Mr. Gharles Nordhoff told me once
that a schooner captain inbound to Tahiti from Flint Island, an
isolated rock pinnacle three hundred miles or more north towards
Hawaii from the Society Islands, brought him a duckling which he
had picked up on the island. Mr. Nordhoff was able to raise the bird,
and found that it was a Pintail, presumably from wild parents. If
Pintails can fly so far south of Hawaii where they are in the habit
of wintering, there seems no reason why Gadwalls should not be able
to do the same thing.
The smallest of all the Ducks in the Pacific is the Laysan Teal,
Anas laysanensis. It is also one of the rarest Ducks and may now be
extinct. Laysan is in the western Hawaiian group, two hundred miles
or so from Midway. Of all the plain-coloured Mallard-like birds,
this I think would be one of the pleasantest in captivity because of
the irregular white head patterns of both sexes. The rest of the bird
is somewhat rusty with a deep green speculum. In size they are about
equal to the Formosa teal. But alas, I am afraid that these birds will
never be seen in an aviary. When Dr. Alexander Wetmore was on
Laysan in 1923, he found only twenty birds. They were so lacking in
power of flight that they were exhausted after flying one hundred or so
yards ; he easily ran them down and caught several by hand.
In contrast to the Laysan Teal the largest waterfowl in the Pacific
is the Hawaiian Goose or " nene ", Nesochen sandvicensis. This rare
bird is supposed to breed now only on the island of Hawaii proper.
In former times it was often kept in a semi-domestic state in flocks
around villages, but now it is supposed to breed only at rather high
altitudes, 3,500 feet or more. Mr. Lewis, who has a bird park in
Honolulu, told me in 1939, that he estimated there were about five
hundred of these birds left. He said that they lived mostly on the old
lava flows where the grasses and berry bushes that they like grow.
Their favourite food is the berry of a Vaccinium , called locally " ohelo ".
They have a very small clutch of eggs, sometimes only one.

Mr. Lewis had three birds about a year old which had been raised
at the Park Service Game Farm. They were tame and friendly
looking creatures, completely upland-goose-like in their behaviour.
In his Checklist of the Birds of the Hawaii National Park , published in
1941, Mr. Paul Baldwin says that birds may be seen commonly between
6,000 and 7,500 feet on Mount Mauna Loa, where in the winter and
spring a small flock frequents a grassy strip of lava rock surrounded
by rough barren. As this area is now protected there is some possi-
bility that the " nene 55 (pronounced " naynay ") will be preserved
for a time at least.
Information on the present status of the Hawaiian Duck, Anas
wyvilliana , is almost completely lacking. This is a small dull female-
coloured Mallard which is now apparently very rare in the Hawaiian
Islands. In the same publication, Baldwin says that small numbers
of this bird may still be found on the main island of Hawaii at a place
called Waiohinu. It is supposed to nest along mountain streams.
This is a bird which has never been kept in captivity, and which I must
say I think would be fascinating to experiment with. The male has
an indication of the curled sex feathers of a drake Mallard and in
general many of the characters of a Mallard in eclipse plumage. It
is apparently a dwarfed island race of Mallard which for some un-
explained reason, mutational or otherwise, has lost the adult breeding
plumage.
An equally little-known Duck from the Central Pacific is Oustalet's
Grey &amp;apos;Ducky Anas oustaleti. This is a similar bird to the Hawaiian Duck,
but somewhat darker in general coloration. Like the latter bird,
Oustalet's Duck shows no trace of a Mallard breeding plumage,
although Mr. James Greenway of the Museum of Comparative
Zoology at Cambridge, Mass., tells me he recalls seeing a curious
specimen in the Paris Museum which had a partial male Mallard
plumage. Here again is a bird which has never been kept in captivity,
and which would be most interesting to study. This bird is known
only from the islands of Guam, Saipan, and Tinian in the Mariannes
group, localities which are somewhat difficult to visit at the present
time. It is to be hoped, however, that at some time in the not too
far distant future, some of the ardent aviculturists to be found among
the personnel of the United Nations Navies will have a chance to visit
these interesting islands and have a look for this mysterious little Duck.
I cannot close without mentioning the Philippine Mallard, Anas
luzonica. This is a really beautiful bird, uniform grey above and
below, with the sides of the head, chin, throat, and under neck a rich
ruddy buff colour. The bill is lead blue. Male and female are alike
in colour. I have never seen this bird in nature, but I was greatly
taken by a pair in the Singapore Zoo run by Mr. Besapa. The price
he wanted seemed high, and I did not buy them, an action which

G. MAXWELL-A COLLECTION OF WILD GEESE
I have regretted very much since. The only ones ever imported
alive were those kept by Mr. de Laveaga in his aviary in California.
They are extremely striking birds in captivity, and would certainly
repay the trouble of importing them. The second time that I was in
Singapore just before the war broke out, I saw the same pair, and
was again tempted ; this time the price was higher, and I thought
I noticed that the female kept one eye a little more closed than the
other. And so I missed them again. The only thing to do now is to
remember to get some the next time I am in the Philippines !

A COLLECTION OF WILD GEESE
By Gavin Maxwell
I began my collection of wild Geese with a pair of Pinkfeet which
</figure>
<bodyText confidence="0.991443" page_id="56350756"  page_num="70" year="" vol="">
I had seen advertised in a weekly paper. At that time I had no idea
of trying to form a collection, merely thinking that it would be pleasant
to have a pair of tame wild Geese. Having had no experience of Geese
in captivity, I did not know that from this point of view Pinkfeet were
the least suitable of all species. The Pinkfoot in a collection with a
thousand other birds remains at heart the same Goose as in earlier
days of freedom, keeping to the very centre of the fifty-acre black
potato field on which he feeds, displaying the same wariness and
watchfulness to the end of his days ! Most other Geese, though
remaining essentially suspicious, acquire a veneer of confidence, but
in my experience the Pinkfoot eyes man with distrust and antagonism
from his first day in captivity until his last.
The two Geese were installed upon a small pond and, though they
refused to become very tame, they sometimes called, and their voices
were music that brought back a thousand lonely hours on salt-marsh
and on tide. The next addition to the collection was a wing-tipped
Greylag, which escaped during his first day in captivity. In answer
to the offered reward he was returned by a local shepherd, but escaped
for the second time the next day, and was never seen again. After
that the collection stood still for a time.
Some months later I imported a pair of hand-reared Bean Geese
from abroad, and realized just how tame a " wild 55 Goose could be.
(The Continental dealer wrote : " Very tame, often feed by hand "--
and they did.) During the next winter I added ten wing-tipped Grey-
lags, and I thought then how pleasant it would be to have a great many
Geese close to the house.
Most of the Greylags flew away sooner or later. I have always
had an unreasoning dislike of pinioning adult birds, so I allowed
their flight feathers to grow after the moult, and I suppose that I was

repaid by their morning and evening flights. They were tamer, if
anything, after their powers of flight returned, and at feeding time
would come sailing in to alight among the pinioned birds feeding at
my feet. But when the migrating Geese came back in autumn to the
salt-marsh, seven of the ten returned to their old life. Not all were
shot, for in May of the next year three Greylags came back into the
pen, not much wilder than they had been six months before. I made
up my mind to pinion them, for I did not imagine that the other
four had been alive to take the northward flight to their breeding
grounds.
During the next six months all the British species were added to the
embryo collection, and some of the commoner foreign ones. It was
at about this time that I determined to try to form a complete collec-
tion of the wild Geese.
Looking back over notes, I see that during the first four years, while
rarities were still absent from the collection, I had but one casualty
among the birds. Aviculturists must envy this record ; but, as I was
to find out, beginner's luck does not hold.
When the commoner species were complete, a list of desiderata began
to form. This was divided into two categories--one that there was
but little hope of obtaining, and the other that might be obtained
with perseverance and comparatively large expenditure.
In the first category were certain sub-specific races such as Sushkin's
Goose ( Melanonyx neglectus ), the several Eastern Bean Geese, the Tule
Goose {Anser gambelli), and a few species that are either literally
unobtainable, such as the Sandwich Island Goose, or cannot satis-
factorily be kept in captivity, such as the Kelp Goose.
Into the second category fell such rarities as the Emperor (. Philacte
canagica), Ross's Snow Goose ( Chen rossi), Greater Snow Goose ( Chen
nivalis ), Swan Goose ( Cygnopsis cygnoides), Redbreasted ( Branta bernicla
ruficollis), and a number of others. In the acquisition of these species
I was almost immediately handicapped by the outbreak of war. During
the "Bore" war period of 1939-1940, I would have liked nothing
better than to import all the Continental dealers' stocks wholesale,
and had someone been able to perform that miracle aviculture might
have been spared some terrible losses. There seems now to be but
little doubt that, as with mammals, certain species will rely only
upon captive specimens for their continued existence.
For the fact that the collection does now hold most of these rare
species, I have largely to thank the great kindness of friends, more
particularly Mr. Alfred Ezra, of whose generosity the little flock of
Emperors and Ross's Snow Geese are, among numerous other birds,
a constant reminder.
Lesser Whitefronts {Anser erythropus) , which appeared to be unobtain-
able from any dealer, necessitated a collecting journey to Finnmark,

their only extra-Russian breeding place ; and from this expedition
I returned two months before the outbreak of war. I brought back
with me one pair, leaving others to be reared under hens in Varanger,
but it is most improbable that they have survived the German occupa-
tion. The pair with which I did return were extraordinarily tame,
and have since become extremely and permanently aggressive towards
humans--much more so, even, than the breeding males of S. American
species or of Gereopsis. Unlike the latter, they attack with both bill
and wings--both are surprisingly capable of inflicting injury.
Shortly before the war, also, a lucky chance enabled me to obtain
a pair of Asiatic Greylags [Anser cinereus rubrirostris) which had come
into the hands of a British dealer under the name of common Grey-
lags. This subspecies is very rarely represented in collections, and
I think that at the time of their importation there were no others in
the British Isles. Six were imported, of which Peter Scott received
two pairs and my own collection one pair. I do not know the wartime
fate of his, but suspect the worst. My own pair has shown no inclina-
tion to breed.
It is interesting to note that, the existence of the familiar typical
Western form (A. cinereus ) was denied by Alpheraky in his painstaking
but somewhat unreliable monograph The Geese of Europe and Asia
(!9 0 5) - The only form familiar to him was rubrirostris , and he
considered the discrepancies in description of specimens emanating
from western Europe to be due to ignorant examination of skins in
which marked colour changes had taken place in the soft parts. The
most striking differences, however, do not lie in the orange bill of
the Western form as contrasted with the pink of the Asiatic, but in
the general plumage coloration.
All the subspecific races of Branta canadensis are now included in
the. collection, though B. c. occidentalis is represented by two males
only, the solitary female meeting with an untimely death soon after
she was acquired.
The acquisition of each new species has afforded me a pleasure
which must be unknown to the collector who acquires his birds in
bulk, as he would furnish an unfurnished house, but the losses have
caused a proportionate despair. Six months ago the collection was
as complete as I had hoped to be able to make it, the missing species
and sub-species being numbered on the fingers of one hand. Since
then a disastrous winter, during which almost every possible malignant
factor took its toll, has caused the extinction of two species--Andean
(Chloephaga melanoptera) , and Lesser Snow ( Chen hyperborea )--and sadly
reduced several others. There are widows and widowers for whom
it will be difficult to secure mates.
But it is not always the rarities that afford the greatest pleasure.
Although the damage to crops necessitated a considerable reduction

in the full-winged flocks last season, those that remain are a never-
ending source of enjoyment. They, together with a few pinioned
birds of the commoner species, live upon a large loch, some three-
quarters of a mile long by a quarter mile broad. As in the wild
state, they flight at dawn and at dusk, and to hear the music of their
calling and to see them black against a pale evening sky is a reward
great for the small labour they incur.
As late on a winter's evening I was piling luggage into the car to
return from my last leave, a small party of Greylags swept low over
the house, calling as they flew--a pleasant valediction. I am con-
cluding this article in a home-bound train, and at dusk to-night their
calling will greet me again.

THE SPINY-TAILED DUCKS

The Erismaturirue or Spiny-tailed Ducks, are a curious and very

interesting group of ten known species.
In appearance some of them are not unlike the Scaups ; they are
of wide distribution, and possess a number of peculiarities--the stiff
tail, large feet, and a rather heavy waterlogged and droll appearance.
The eggs of all species are large, and the shells are of a granular texture.
They are loth to fly, and do not go much on the land, but they are
expert divers. Each species, it need hardly be said, is well described
and portrayed in excellent plates in John C. Phillips's A Natural History
of the Ducks.
Six species form the Oxyurina :--
The White-headed Duck ( Oxyura leucocephala , Scopoli), " of the
Mediterranean basin, with distribution across S. Europe to India."
The North American Ruddy Duck ( 0 . jamaicensis, Gmelin), " widely
distributed over North America."
The Maccoa Duck ( 0 . maccoa, Eyton), " confined to East Africa
from the Gape to Abyssinia."
The Blue-billed Duck ( 0 . australis , Gould), also known as the
Australian Ruddy Duck and Little Musk Duck, " one of the rarest
of the Australian Anatida, appears to be confined to the southern
half of the continent."
The Peruvian Ruddy Duck (0 . ferruginea, Eyton), " whose real home
is the high plateau of Peru, where it is moderately common and breeds
in considerable numbers on the Andean lakes."
The Argentine Ruddy Duck ( 0 . vittata, Phillipi), similar to the
foregoing and " resident in the Argentine and Chile."
The White-backed Duck ( Thalassornis leuconotus , Eyton), "ranging
from the Gape to Abyssinia and Loango as well as to Madagascar."

The Madagascan White-backed Duck (T. leuconotus insularis, Rich-
mond) . The Madagascan form of T. leuconotus , which it much resembles.
The Masked Duck ( Nomonyx dominicus , Linne), " of Central America.
It is said to feed entirely on vegetable food."
The Musk Duck ( Biziura lobata, Shaw), from "the southern half of
Australia and Tasmania
Only two or three species are, I believe, at all well known to
aviculturists here : the Madagascan White-backed has been bred
several times at Foxwarren Park ( A.M. , July-August, 1941) and it is *
interesting to note that the young were not pinioned and did not fly
away--indeed it seems likely that, being so loth to fly, any of these
Ducks could safely be kept full-winged.
The North American Ruddy Duck has been bred by Mr. Sibley
and at Walcot Hall (A.M., April, 1938), and in this number of the
Magazine the summer plumage of the male and the very peculiar
display have been well described by Mr. Wintle.
The Musk Duck was kept many years ago at the London Zoo, and
in early 1939 a pair arrived at Walcot Hall where, one hopes, they
are thriving still.
Both sexes of this Duck have a wattle under the lower mandible,
and the males, which are much larger than the females, are said to
have a strong musky odour in the breeding season.
Three species, the North American Ruddy, the White-backed, and
the Peruvian Ruddy, were successfully kept at Sterrebeek, where they
thrived on a diet of soaked wheat (two parts), broken maize (one part),
duck bread, whatever live food they found, and duck-weed, though
I doubt if they ever ate any of this weed.
Three male North American Ruddy Ducks, a species said by
Phillips to be " very difficult to keep in captivity and very difficult
to rear ", were in the collection for several years, and a single female
was obtained in the autumn of 1938, but was, unhappily, lost during
the very severe weather of that winter. We found these birds quite
friendly even with small Teal, but they were inclined to quarrel
among themselves during the summer, when they had assumed the
red plumage and bright blue bills and were during all the hours of
daylight displaying to one another.
During the summer of 1939 two of these Ducks took a dislike to
the third, and chased and dived at him whenever he appeared above
the surface of the water. He was never caught by them, and was not
at all distressed, coming up for air in the most unexpected places and,
if time permitted, he would even do a little display on his own account
before being obliged to dive again.
We thought he might eventually become rather worn down, so we
moved him to another place where he lived happily, displaying to
almost anything, with a slight preference for Gadwall.

In writing of the display, Phillips describes " the large air-sac
opening off the windpipe and lying between it and the oesophagus.
This structure, which is present only in males, is used as a sort of
sounding board during display, and seems to take the place of a special
dilatation of the syrinx, the bulla ossea, such as is found in most male
Ducks Phillips says that " the clutch is irregular, ranging from
five to twenty. Nests are poorly constructed and old Coots' nests are
sometimes used ". He adds, " Clutches deposited in layers are
common," and that " another curious thing about the Ruddy is that
not all the eggs found are in the same stage of incubation, and it is
certain that the females lay more or less in each other's nests, for their
nests are often close together."
We found that these birds did not go much on to the land, and that
when they did they moved about with great clumsiness and difficulty.
Because they prefer to escape from danger by diving rather than by
flying, these birds have been considered by some to be stupid. This
may, however, be a faulty judgment for, as we see in the case of the
Grebes, an accomplished diver, not very strong on the wing, can escape
much more effectively by diving than by flying.
Two Peruvian Ruddy Ducks did well in a small pond by themselves.
I never saw them on the land, though they were obliged to go to the
edge of the bank for their food. We grew three species of the hardy
Cyprepedium orchids quite near the water, and neither they nor the
other plants were ever damaged by these Ducks.
Neither showed the least sign of coming into colour, and were
evidently females.
In sunny weather they and the White-backed had the curious habit
of resting on the water with tails upright and spread fanwise, and the
large feet thrust out from over the wing coverts, a quaint contortion
designed, no doubt, to give the feet a little sun and air.
Two White-backed also lived alone on another small pond. They
were never seen to display, and as they were so exactly alike and had
no eclipse plumage we could not be sure of their sexes.
Their curiously marked plumage rendered them scarcely visible
against the stems of the reeds in their pond, and even the colours of
the bill were so broken up that its shape could not easily be discerned
against such a background.
These birds seemed rather pugnacious, quickly driving off full-
winged Tree-ducks that came to the pond, and they would open
their beaks at us if we passed too near, but they were always ready
to dive with all the dexterity of Grebes, coming carefully to the surface
close by the reeds. They did not damage the water-lilies in their pond
or the plants on the banks.

By G. L. Sibley
We in America are fortunate that a great ocean separates both the
East and the West coasts of our country from the immediate scenes
of the world conflict in which we find ourselves embroiled. We have
not been bombed, to date, nor have alien armies ravaged our country-
side. For these and many other blessings, we praise God. Since
7th December, 1941, however, America has been actively at war, and
the task of aiding its allies with food, munitions, ships, and all the
complicated and expensive gear and tackle of war, plus the tremendous
needs for America itself to wage a successful struggle, has taxed even
the almost limitless resources of this great land.
Getting together, outfitting and training the enormous army of
eleven million men, which is the task of this country, means that every
able-bodied man, woman, and child over fourteen or fifteen years of
age has had to more or less discard his everyday life, and gear life to
the needs of war.
War plants have taken their millions of men and women from every
walk of civilian life : butcher, baker, and candlestick maker, as well
as doctor, lawyer, merchant, chief, and not excepted are those fine
men and women who have devoted their lives to breeding, keeping,
and rearing ornamental birds of all sorts.
At first when our men went into the Services or into war plants,
we were able to get women to carry on after a fashion. As war has
become more complex, women are not available, for young and old
are needed in war work. Consequently those of us with bird collec-
tions have gotten along as best we could under great handicaps.
During the last year protein foods have been vanishing from the
market, and while there is still an abundance of grains for even
ornamental birds, such things as cod liver oil, meat, and fish meals,
dried milk, etc., have become as extinct as the Dodo, and one has to
make shift with such ingredients as he can obtain.
Between insufficient and inadequate help, curtailed rations, the
demands of war work for the owner, and no continual expert super-
vision, the past season has not held any outstanding successes in water-
fowl rearing. This will be mostly a record of failures or near-successes.
The Winter of 1941-42 was unusually mild, and waterfowl came
into the Spring in excellent condition for breeding. At that time also
special food ingredients were still obtainable. The first birds to start
breeding were the Cereopsis Geese. Having reared a number each
year until we had accumulated quite a flock, we kept only one old
pair of breeders, with a number of younger birds which were not

paired. Early in the winter the old pair nested, the female laying
four eggs as usual. All were fertile, and all went well until one
morning we found the nest abandoned and the eggs broken open and
eaten. The culprit, a skunk, was trapped the next day at the opening
in the fence through which he had managed to dig, but the eggs were
done for, of course. This particular Goose has always laid two
clutches of eggs, and within a couple of weeks of the skunk debacle,
she started to lay again, and this time laid five. The snow got quite
deep, so a box was put over her. Had we had, at the time, a broody
hen, we should have taken the eggs and incubated them under the
hen, but no hen was ready, so Mrs. Cereopsis was left to do the
incubating. Sunnyfields is in the midst of wooded country where
quite a lot of wild life--foxes, deer, owls, mink, etc.--are still to be
found. After about two weeks of incubating we found Mrs. Cereopsis
dead, with a hole torn in her side, and the eggs frozen. The culprit,
a grey fox, which had climbed over a seven-foot wire fence to reach
the nest, was also gotten, but too late to save the Goose and eggs.
So 1942 saw no Cereopsis goslings, lovely tame fluffy little things.
At about the same time two pairs of Black Swans were nesting. The
eggs of one pair were infertile, those of the other pair hatched, and
before we were aware of it, the anxious mother had literally crushed
the babies to death in keeping them warm. A later brood from the
same pair was raised under a motherly hen. Black-necked Swans laid
at a very unseemly time, and the eggs were chilled so that they
failed to hatch. They did not nest again.
Mute Swans, as usual, nested and were easily reared. In other
years we haven't thought too highly of this, for the large importations
by the bird dealers from Holland and Germany made them available
at prices hardly worth the trouble of rearing. Now, however, they
are in great demand with the European supply cut off, so we didn't
begrudge them the time and effort to rear them, and they were taken
off our hands as soon as grown.
Whistling Swans nested, and I think laid, but not in their nest.
No young resulted, so we cannot be certain. A Whistling male mated
with a female Bewick's of the Jankowski sub-species, nested, and laid
four fertile eggs. Only one cygnet was hatched and raised, apparently
a female. It looks much like a young Whistling Swan, but with a
somewhat larger yellow patch on the beak. Trumpeter Swans did
not finally nest, although they carried great quantities of rubbish and
piled it in several places, and we had high hopes. Whoopers, as
usual, nested and reared their young without trouble. We have now
no Bewick's male, and probably won't be able to obtain one until the
war is won.
Geese were not too successful. We reared a large flock of Barnicles,
and for the first time two young Tule Geese, which are a pair. The

Tule is a large White-fronted, migrating in winter to California, and
given the specific name of gambeli. We had great hopes that our pair
of the tiny little Richardson's Geese would nest, as I think them the
only pair in captivity in this country. However, after making a
scrape in the ground, and fussing about for some time, they did not
finally nest, very probably because we had quite a number of breeding
pairs of various Geese in their large field, and there was more or less
fighting. I am more and more impressed with the fact that if one
wants to breed wild Geese successfully, he should have separate
enclosures of some size, for each breeding pair, with ample grazing
and sufficient water facilities for mating, washing, and drinking, at
least. In a mixed collection of breeding Geese, even though kept
in a very large natural enclosure as are ours, there is always more or
less bickering and the smaller and shyer species fail to nest. Other
Geese reared, none of them of great rarity were Ross, Blue, Snow,
White-cheeked, Pink-foot, Ruddy-headed, the usual Egyptians and
Canadas, which are almost in a state of wildness and look after them-
selves. Lesser White-fronted and Orinocos laid unfertile eggs. We
no longer have a true pair of Andean, Ashy-headed, or Chilian (as
we called the Barred Upland), and Blue-winged failed to nest, as did
Greylag, Bean, Semi-palmated, Spur-wing, and one or two other
species. Red-breasted and Maned failed to rear their young, but
the Maned redeemed themselves late in the season by nesting again
and rearing two young, both males. Cackling and Emperors nested
but before we could take the eggs to incubate, and rear them with
hens, fighting Geese had destroyed them. We find that if the first
clutch of eggs is taken just at the time the Goose starts to incubate,
a second clutch will often be laid, and we either let the Goose hatch
and rear these, or take the second clutch also in the case of a rare
species, and give the sitting Goose some common Duck or Goose eggs
to hatch, so that her maternal instinct will not be entirely thwarted.
Crows got some eggs, as did some Cranes which were running with
some of the Geese in the early part of the season, and with inadequate
help we were unable to prevent this unhappy conclusion to a fond
mother Goose's hopes (and I might add, our own as well). Magellan
goslings were hatched out and grew like the green bay tree until
they somehow contracted aspergillosis, with the result that all died.
Our Chinese Geese undoubtedly nested, somewhere in a five-acre field,
but try as we would, we could not find the nest, the birds were so
adroit about hiding it, and later the female appeared after about two
weeks, so something evidently went wrong. It may also have been
laid at the door of a pair of Manchurian Cranes which insisted on
getting out of their own enclosure with an eight-foot fence during high
winds, and winging into that occupied by the Chinese Geese (and a
few other sorts). By the way, this pair of Manchurian Cranes, received

from Japan in a group of eleven, as young, captive-bred birds in
juvenile plumage, nested this past season when three years of age and
reared two young, one to complete maturity, so we know that this
particular pair at least reached breeding maturity at three years of
age. We had no sort of idea at what age breeding began.
Ducks were almost a complete failure so far as rarities went. Quite
a lot of the common sorts : Mandarins, Woods, Pintails, etc., were
allowed to hatch their own eggs and rear their young, with quite a lot
of resulting losses, but a certain number managed to survive and reach
full-winged adulthood. As usual, the Shelducks of various sorts bred
easily and well, and the young are always, it seems to us, very easily
raised with even indifferent care. African Redbills laid three large
clutches (one clutch of fourteen), and we reared several young. An
Eyton's Tree Duck female laid over forty eggs, those first laid hatching
some very weak ducklings, the later ones seeming to be too weak to
hatch, and finally the germ just barely started to develop in the eggs
before dying. Shells became progressively poorer also, in spite of
the fact that the birds were in a natural pond with access to a limited
amount of natural feed, and with all the artificial helps we could
furnish in the way of diet. Late in the autumn the female died, but
a post mortem revealed no apparent internal trouble. Some years ago
we reared two young male Eyton's to maturity, and also lost that
breeding female. Gremlins apparently play hob with other things
than planes, and as we have no other Eyton's female, our breeding of
this lovely species will have to wait until the war is past.
Grows, rats, skunks, and fighting accounted for a large number of
ducks' eggs, for we had no trained man left to search for nests and
collect the eggs as formerly, and also not time enough to incubate
any but the rarer sorts under Bantams. Also, during the last two or
three years, since it has been impossible to import any birds, some of
our breeding pairs have been broken up by the death of one or the
other of the birds, and we have not been able to get replacements.
Then, too, waterfowl keeping is not common in America, and some
of the smaller collections have not been kept up because of wartime
conditions, and some have been dispersed because of lack of labour.
There is no outstanding public collection of wild waterfowl in America,
although since his connection with the New York Zoo, Mr. Jean
Delacour has been able to add quite a number of desirable species
to the Zoo collection, and given time, and an end of the war, it should
become excellent.
One interesting nesting was that of a pair of South American Comb
Ducks. The female is quite a tiny thing, yet she laid a rather round,
and polished egg almost as large as that of a Spur-winged Goose.
Unfortunately the eggs were laid rather late in the season after the
male had apparently gone out of breeding condition, so were unfertile.

80 C. L. SIBLEY-MISADVENTURES IN WATERFOWL REARING- 1 942
We had an interesting experience with the American Flamingo.
For some years I have wanted to have some but their exportation is
prohibited from the West Indian Islands where they are found, and
although they have nested well and raised numbers of young at the
Hialeah Park race track in Miami, during the last two or three years,
these birds have not been available to the public. These lovely scarlet
red birds are a dazzling sight when in full colour. In the spring of
1942, a dealer wrote me that he had two pairs available, but they were
not in colour. I got a pair, and when I saw them, my heart sank,
for they were almost white, even lighter in colour than our Chilian
Flamingoes, of which we have several specimens. However, they were
put into a muddy pond, with some natural food, and fed on dried
shrimp, boiled wheat, and soaked dog biscuit containing about 30 per
cent meat meal, also cod liver oil. Since the natural moulting season
for this species is February and March, I did not expect any improve-
ment in colour until the old feathers had been shed and the new ones
acquired. Our surprise may be imagined, therefore, when these white
birds gradually attained a coral pink colour, evidently by an im-
perceptible moult, and by autumn were only a shade less scarlet than
the finest of wild birds. Encouraged by this, we obtained the other
pair offered by the dealer, one a young bird in juvenile plumage, and
they have responded in the same way. At this writing (2nd&amp;apos;March,
1943), the four birds are undergoing the natural moult and apparently
coming into full scarlet colour with their new feathers. So striking
a bird is well worth the extra trouble of keeping it in colour, and we
look forward to enjoying their beauty this summer in our ponds.
While not classed as waterfowl, one near-success we had with
Cranes may be of interest. A pair of Hooded Cranes, acquired a few
years ago and quartered in an enclosure of about an acre of not very
suitable land, with a small artificial pool, surprised us by nesting.
They have always been wilder than most of our Cranes, but became
quite tame and aggressive very suddenly, evidently a prelude to
nesting. One cranelet hatched naturally and the other was taken
from the shell a couple of days later, and appeared to be normal.
However, they appeared very weak, and could not be induced to eat,
and forced feeding seemed to produce no results, so that both were
lost. Now we have changed the adult pair to an enclosure with
natural water and hope that nesting may be repeated this season
and possibly young reared to maturity. We have digressed from
waterfowl in this instance as the Hooded Crane has not before nested
in this country, so far as we can ascertain.
This recital of failures and our high hopes for better success " next
season ", exemplifies the fact that if one has an inherent love of
feathers, he or she will not be discouraged by persistent failure. Sooner
or later (at least we always hope) will come that fortunate " break "

Aid for Young Wild Birds
In view of the number of young wild birds which meet with mishaps each spring
a series of suggestions for the care and feeding of baby birds that fall out of the nest,
or otherwise get into difficulties, has been made by Mr. Lee Crandall, Curator of
Birds at the Bronx Zoo, for the guidance of bird lovers in New York. Mr. Crandall's
suggestions for temporary and emergency measures to keep very young birds from
starving to death or being killed by cats and dogs are :--
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.9938856" page_id="56350769"  page_num="81" year="" vol="">
1. If a nest containing young birds is blown out of a tree try to put it back in its
original site. If the birds are very young the mother will probably continue to feed
them ; if they are almost old enough to fly they will probably refuse to stay in the
nest. This is natural and nothing need be done about it.
2. If the nest is destroyed or helpless birds are found on the ground, they can be
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.7249106" page_id="56350769"  page_num="81" year="" vol="">
put in a substitute nest. This should be lined with something soft--cloth, cotton, or
dried grass roughly shaped into the form of a nest. The purpose of this is to give
the young birds' feet something to push against ; if placed on a hard, flat surface
their legs will spraddle and because of their rapid growth at this period will be likely
to " set " in a spraddled position.
</bodyText>
<footnote confidence="0.4107327">
3. Young birds placed in a temporary nest should, be covered with a cloth and
kept warm, as they are used to being hovered by the mother and kept warm.
4. Baby birds must be fed at intervals of at least half an hour during the daytime.
If they are very young they will open their mouths to be fed when their nest is jostled.
Slightly older birds, getting on toward the flying stage, will be too frightened to open
their mouths and their beaks will have to be opened by the fingers.
5. The proper method of feeding a very small bird is to push a bit of food into its
open mouth by means of a smooth spatula or a pair of blunt forceps, or even by two
small sticks held in " chop-stick " fashion.
6. Small birds should never be given water from a medicine dropper. When
</footnote>
<bodyText confidence="0.9639061" page_id="56350769"  page_num="81" year="" vol="">
they are old enough to sit on a perch water can be offered them in a shallow dish.
Small birds are quickly killed by water given them forcibly.
7. Young birds that are able to fly only weakly and are in danger from cats and
dogs while on the ground may be placed in a tree out of harm's way. The parents
will find them.
8. Birds assisted by their human friends should be turned loose at the very earliest
moment, not only because it is illegal to continue to keep them but because they will
become unable to find food for themselves if they are accustomed to being fed by hand.
Normally the parent birds teach the young to find food, and human assistance is
no substitute for the bird's own efforts.

A BUDGERIGAR X LOVEBIRD QUERY
A correspondent inquires whether there is any authentic record of the successful
rearing of Budgerigar-Lovebird hybrids.
I know of no record of complete success in Great Britain, and only one claim on
the Continent, and one unconfirmed in Australia.
There is no reason to suppose that this is an impossible cross, but bearing in mind
the very considerable differences in the breeding habits of M. undulatus and the
Agapornes any reports, and they are but few, should be treated with considerable
reserve.

The most likely species of Lovebird to nest successfully with a Budgerigar is
undoubtedly the Madagascar ; and this cross is the one that has produced the only
real " possible Dr. E. Hopkinson, in Records of Birds Bred in Captivity, quotes
Neunzig as recording this cross, and refers to Die Gefiederte Welt, 1890, p. 223. At that
time The Feathered World was edited by Dr. Karl Russ, and under the heading Breeding
Information, he writes--a somewhat free translation :--
" In the bird chamber of Baron von Grote is a very interesting hybrid breeding
success. A communication from the gentleman mentioned gives a brief account of
a hybrid between a Grey-headed Dwarf Parrot and an Undulated Grass Parrakeet
hen or Budgerigar. The bird has the shape and markings of the Budgerigar, only
the head, neck, and about half the upper surface exhibits the colouring of the young
of the Madagascar Lovebird. It is very energetic and in good condition."
The description of the young would suggest that it was fully reared, and Dr. Russ
seems to have accepted it as a fact.
The only British record of even partial success is that of the late Wesley T. Page;
writing on Madagascar Lovebirds in Bird Notes , 1918, p. 55, he says :--
" Later two more pairs (costing 35. 6 d. per pair) were put into the aviary, and
though both pairs chose nest-boxes, and carried into them a huge amount of rubbish,
I never found any eggs, then one of the hens died, and the cock mated up with an
odd Budgerigar, and one young hybrid was hatched out and lived to leave the nest ;
the next day it unfortunately got into the bath (a large shallow vessel only containing
an inch depth of water) and was drowned."
It is a great pity that this unique youngster should have met such an untimely
death.
In Bird Notes, 1911, p. 211, under the heading Editorial, appears the following
paragraph :--
" Black-cheek Lovebirds and Green Budgerigar hybrids.--Our esteemed member,
Mrs. Higginbotham, has four young of the above cross hatched out and doing well.
The male of a pair of Black-cheeks forsook his. own mate and paired up with the
Budgerigar. Seven eggs were duly laid, of which four duly hatched out, both parents
shared the duties of incubation. The Black-cheek feeds the Budgerigar on the nest
but has not been seen to enter the nest receptacle since the hatching of the young.
There are pairs of Rosella and Alexandrine Parrakeets in the aviary, but neither
dare go near the nest while the Black-cheek is in the vicinity."
This "success" is included in the October, 1911, list of those qualified for the
Foreign Bird Club medal.
Dr. E. Hopkinson mentions this cross in " Breeding Records to Date ", A.M., 1941,
p. 89, and writes :--
" Nothing further appeared about this, and on inquiry Mr. Page replied that
he had never heard any more about the matter. This record must therefore be
disregarded."
The only other report I have seen appears in The Foreigner, 1939, p. 34. Mr. D. B.
Bush, of New South Wales, mentions at the end of a letter, " Also a friend of mine
has a young bird from a Peach-faced Lovebird and a Green Budgerigar." I wrote
asking for particulars, but after some months my letter was returned marked

THE GREAT FLYING CAGE IN THE NEW YORK
ZOOLOGICAL PARK
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.998976125" page_id="56350777"  page_num="83" year="" vol="">
By Lee S. Crandall, Curator of Birds, New York Zoological Park
In 1900, when the great Flying Cage in the New York Zoological
Park was built, it really was one of the world's wonders ; 150 feet long,
75 feet wide, and 55 feet high, its lofty arch enclosed several forested
oaks, as well as innumerable lesser trees and shrubs, and a broad,
L-shaped pool. Strange though it may seem to us the construction
of the strong but delicate framework presented problems then not
well understood and it was only after overcoming apparently
insurmountable difficulties that it was finally accomplished. To-day
our Flying Cage is still a fine and useful structure, though it is no
longer the largest in the world. The original wire netting, of 2 in.
mesh, long since rusted out, has been replaced with copper ; otherwise
the exterior of the cage remains as it has been for more than forty years.
Not so, however, with the interior. In the course of years the
shrubbery had become disreputable and the rather sketchy rock-
work more or less broken down. In the spring of 1941 it became
evident that something must be done, and with the co-operation of
our old friend Jean Delacour, now a welcome associate, we set about
doing it.
The cage had always been used exclusively for aquatic birds, most
important of which were the Pelicans. Of these we had a really good
lot, including the European White, the Eastern White, the rare pale
grey Dalmation, the Florida, and the California Brown, the American
White, the handsome Australian, and the prettily coloured Red-backed
of tropical Africa. These Pelicans made a fine show at liberty in the
great cage, which gave them ample room for making full use of their
wide wingspread. However, it was evident that cover planting of
any consequence could not be undertaken as long as the Pelicans
were present, since their great feet would crush any but the most
robust shrub. Therefore we finally decided that, with clipped wings,
they should be removed to an otherwise unoccupied lake in the northern
section of the Park. Here they make a really good show and have

almost paid their way through the sale of fish to be tossed to them by
visitors.
With this accomplished we set about the rehabilitation of the cage.
A number of large and ugly concrete blocks, which act as anchors
for the heavy steel side braces, were masked with mounds of rock.
The edge of the pool was similarly disguised, and a small island
was provided. Since rather heavy shade and a considerable number
of birds made it unlikely that grass could be maintained, we decided
to create irregular islands &amp;apos;of shrubbery and to cover the intervening
open areas with round white pebbles. In these plantings various
shrubs were used, and of these the best were found to be rhododendrons,
mountain laurels, andromedas, and barberries. These furnish excellent
ground cover without obstructing the view, and at the same time make
a fine contrast to several tall oaks and sweet gums, and spreading
elms, maples, and catalpas.
We next took stock of the remaining birds. It was obvious that we
must remove any that might damage the new planting or that would
interfere with the nests of others. This meant no large Ibises, Herons,
or Gulls, and no Gallinules. With these eliminated we had only to
secure a few small Ducks and to add some other odds and ends to
provide a really good lot of attractive aquatic birds which would
live harmlessly together, abstain from serious damage to the planting,
and provide an exhibit of interest.
When finally assembled we found we had about 150 birds of nearly
sixty species, which would constitute our summer exhibit. Roughly
these included American, Snowy, and Buff-backed Egrets, a Boat-
billed Heron, four kinds of small Gulls, Scarlet, White, and Guiana
Ibises, Roseate and Yellow-legged Spoonbills, and a Buff-backed
Trumpeter. Thirteen kinds of Ducks and seven of Pigeons added some
attractive species. Gallinaceous birds were represented by Curassows,
Ghukar Partridges, and Golden, Amherst, Ring-necked, and Blue
Eared Pheasants, and in addition there were Javan Peafowl (the cock
a yearling !), and Vulturine and Crested Guineafowl. A dash of
rarity was obtained through a Renauld's Ground Cuckoo, a Sunda
Island Coucal, and a Frigate Bird, the latter a particularly engaging
bird. There were also two South African Black Oyster-catchers and
a Water Stone Plover or Dikkop, both of which were represented for
the first time in our collection.
Not a little experimenting was required to determine just which
should remain and which must be banished. However, the final
selection has proven satisfactory and there is no doubt that we all
learned a great deal. Not the least of the additions to the sum of
our experience was the fact that it is perfectly possible to operate the
aviary throughout the winter months. There is no shelter attached
and we had always removed the birds to a near-by heated building

early in October. We might have left a few hardy things outside,
but had always been assured by our engineering department that the
severe freezing of midwinter could cause cracking of the concrete
pool if it were kept filled with water. Last autumn, however, we
decided that since we had come so far we might as well finish it.
In October we removed only the species known to be sensitive to
cold and left a very considerable number of the hardier sorts. We
introduced a small portable shelter--which nothing, so far as I know,
ever used--and made certain of a strong flow of water. To the surprise
of everyone a large section of the pool near the inlet was kept open
by the combined action of the swimming birds and running water,
even though there were periods when 30 degrees of frost were endured
for several days at a time. Complete absence of damage to the concrete
confounded our engineers and there was only one catastrophe--
a lovely drake American Merganser (the American form of the
Goosander) dived under the ice and was unable to find his way out,
with the inevitable results !
So it develops that now instead of a mere summer exhibit we have
one that extends the year around and the great cage no longer stands
empty during the dreary months of winter.

How will this war affect bird-keepi . .--I mean aviculture ? The
war seems certain to hasten powerfully the tendency, that was already
strong and fairly quickly growing stronger, towards equalisation of
the good things of life, whereof among the chief are education, leisure,
and spending-power.
Of each generation of the people of Great Britain some have a real
bent towards keeping plants or animals merely for their beauty and
other interest. But that impulse with all its possibilities of pleasure,
not only for its possessor but for others also, may be thwarted by
ignorance, lack of leisure or poverty.
Spread of education, leisure and spending-power, since it must
diminish that thwarting, must increase the number of gardeners and
of bird-kee . . . --I mean aviculturists.
So the war must hasten any growth that aviculture was destined
to attain.
It must hasten also--and enormously--the development of transport
by air. Managers thereof, whether they be minions of private enterprise,
with humbly little " m ", " p ", " e ", or Public Servants splendid
with the capital letters and other dignities proper to that estate, will
want freight.

Moreover they will want freight of which the money-value is high in
proportion to its bulk and weight. Birds of a stature downwards from,
say, Parrots, should fill this bill well enough. The great difficulties of
feeding on a long voyage would be cut out. Already before the war
we had discovered how to provide for travelling apples a special
atmosphere that suspends the process of their ripening and so of their
decay. It seems reasonable to hope that, if now we give to birds a
somewhat disconcerting demonstration of what flight really can be,
we shall be able to give them also an atmosphere in which they can
be safe and comfortable at levels above the Condor's range.
Let us suppose that there is a growth of the inclination to cultivate
aves. Let us suppose that there is a growth in the extent to which aves
are available for cultivation. These things, if they happen, will
increase the need that there shall be available to those would-be
cultivators knowledge and materials.
Let us hope that somebody or something will issue counsels complete
and clear upon housing, feeding and so forth. Let us hope that the
Avicultural Society will keep on this an eye and ear of owl-like quality
and be instant to fill any aching void left by deficiency of other
initiative.
Let us have definite specifications of cages, aviaries and diets. Let
there be an Official List of Lunacies to be Avoided, including that
which led more than one expert of the VERY highest rank to cause
a simple soul (the writer, as it happens, of this paper) to invest sums,
whereof the memory is an abiding agony, upon digging two-foot
trenches around four large blocks of aviaries and a vast duckery
because, said the experts, thus and thus alone can Man exclude from
aviaries certain forms of life inimical thereto and, worst of all, the
Brown, Norway or Hanover Rat.
Let us suppose that the habitations provided for the aves are not too
far wrong. There will remain food. Upon one notable element in this
the fifty-fourth page of this latest year of our Magazine has under the
title " Meal Worms " a weighty letter from Mr. W. A. Jones.
These are not times when one can lay schemes even with such small
confidence as is normally possible to Man. But, subject to those vast
uncertainties, I have some hope that after the war the Leckford
Bird-Farm may be in this way of some use to British Aviculture.
I will not go here into details, but it is a fact that a lady, who in the
study of entomology attained high academic eminence, wrote to me
some time ago that she expected to be able to see her way to play
after this war in a certain plan such a part that, when in taking visitors
through the aviaries here I allow myself to make for the umpteenth
time what is, I am afraid, my favourite remark, namely, " I bred it,"
she will be able to add in a tone that will be, I gather, delicately but
definitely superior, " I fed it."

The plan may come to nothing, but at present we are seeing visions
and dreaming dreams of an elaborately scientific plant for the pro-
duction of a beautifully even output of meal worms and of some others
of those forms of life whereof the main function in the Scheme of
Things is to be eaten.
Here there may be, I conceive, scope for experiment. It seems very
unlikely that the larva of a particular beetle is so near to being the
whole bag of tricks. But we shall see what we shall see.
One notion remains before this writer will have done all, that on
this occasion he can, to assuage editorial esurience. It is this. Suppose
that among other innumerable consequences of a general spread of
education, leisure and spending-power there is a great growth of
aviculture. Will this lead to a great lengthening of the range of species
that are kept fairly generally ? Or shall we find that aviculturists
break into separate groups, on the one hand a smallish group of those
inclined by temperament either to keep a great variety of species or
else to choose one or more that are not kept commonly, while on the
other hand a separate, far larger, group will devote themselves to
keeping one or more of the species on a pretty short list ? The Canary,
the Budgerigar, the Guinea-pig, the Goldfish, and some few other
animals, and in the vast vegetable world a mere handful of species
have special attractions that others apparently have not.
If so, will that list slowly grow ? Will it come to include the Mandarin
Duck and the Chiloe Wigeon, and among game-birds perhaps, if we
can only get really strong domestic strains, that extremely attractive
genus, the Tragopan, with its no more than five species, so satisfactorily
distinct, so delightfully tame and all, it may be presumed, as ready
to breed in captivity as are, to judge from experience at Leckford,
the Crimson and Temminck's.
The Golden Pheasant and Lady Amherst's and Reeve's and
Swinhoe's have reached this list already. The Mikado Pheasant
seems likely to do the same. Will the Peacock-Pheasants--above all
that supremely charming little fowl, Napoleon's ? Pheasants, however,
need space and waterfowl need water. More really important, there-
fore, are any possibilities of lengthening the list of little birds that
thrive in cages or small aviaries and that in beauty and liveliness
or in voice can give keen pleasure not only to aviculturists but to all
and sundry who now and again will see or hear them. For it is surely
not the least of the pleasures of our hobby that, like gardening, it
adds to the general pleasantness of life for other people.
If anyone domesticates the Amethyst Starling as solidly as the
Budgerigar, should he not be knighted ? Would a viscounty be any
more than a just expression of public gratitude to him (or her) that
did the same for the Alexandra Parrakeet ? And, when we think of
some of the performances that have turned commoners into earls

{Continuedfrom Vol. VII , p. 116)
It cannot be denied that softbills make the most attractive and
intelligent caged birds--if they are kept in suitable surroundings.
Their very nature of feeding indicates a cautious way of keeping, and
when once one has grasped that fact the attractiveness and intelligence
of the softbill will be more readily appreciated.
In comparison with the larger type of softbills, i.e. Jays, Magpies,
Fieldfares, etc., the smaller type, i.e. Nightingales, Blackcaps, Warblers,
do not merit any hand-rearing as, comparatively speaking, the smaller
species settle better--but one needs the heart of a lion to reduce an
" aviary smashing 55 Magpie, down to a bird feeding on one's shoulder
uttering those peculiar little sounds that only come when complete
confidence and respect reigns between bird and master.
To me the word " softbill 55 denotes a lot more than the actual
confinement of such a species of bird to an aviary or cage. After the
long dark nights of the winter months one begins to hear the Song
Thrush singing his chant on an exposed bough competing lustily with
another some distance away ; the Blackbird fighting angrily with
another, crawling on the ground and facing one another like fighting
cocks of the good (?) old days, and then up, down, snap, snap, and
a handful of feathers remain to mark the spot where the combat took
place.
The " Throstle 55 or better still Storm-Cock (or would you prefer
Missel Thrush) can be heard with a melody more beautiful than any
other--which makes one pause to listen and think of better days with
green buds bursting in the warmer sunlight--with blossom blooms
humming with bees doing their vital work of pollination and helping
man to produce a crop of health-giving fruit. Such a melody rings
with enthusiasm and yet, like the " red sky in the morning ", one must
grimly remember in spite of the beauty of the song, this bird was
aptly named " Storm-Cock ".
And so the days grow longer, the sun gets stronger, and the very
earth smells of something more intoxicating than the most expensive
perfume--until one hears "chiff-chaff-chiff-chaff 55 . At last the
bird has arrived--all the way from a land far away, shouting his name
so distinctly that one does not need to ask for his identity card. This

bird usually arrives in March and whatever the weather or however
backward the season he comes and one wonders sometimes how he
has acclimatized himself so quickly and whether the insects on which
he relies for his very existence have hatched out in sufficient quantities
to satisfy his healthy appetite. He is usually accompanied by the
Willow Wren and Blackcap--both beautiful singers--and one begins
to realize summer is not far off.
The Chiff-Chaff and Willow Wren both build very similar nests
with eggs closely resembling one another. The nest is usually on the
ground with a dome over the top and very cleverly camouflaged.
The family reared in this nest is usually very large considering the
size of the nest and the little birds' mouths wobble up and down,
side to side, that it is extremely difficult to feed them artificially when
at such an age. When they are reared they make marvellous little
aviary inmates--so tame but, oh, so difficult to keep throughout this
English winter without the aid of plenty of live insects and a little
warmth.
The Blackcap is undoubtedly easy to rear and keep and becomes
very confiding--singing lustily all the year with all the richness of
the wild bird's notes.
Before one is fully aware the rest of the migrants are with us and it
depends in what part of the country one lives what species can be seen.
The Nightingale--common in the south, some parts of the east, west,
and midlands--can be heard eerily at night, and one wonders if
there really are such things as ghosts until one appreciates that
Mr. Nightingale has arrived in his old haunts, waiting for his wife,
to build their nest with oak leaves and brood the olive green eggs to
produce next year's songsters.
These birds I always consider exciting and interesting to watch in
their natural state, but in captivity a certain amount of care is expedient
as they are apt to be very pugnacious at certain times of the year
with dire consequences for any tolerant inmate. If hand-reared from
an early stage and given every attention until after they have moulted--
not allowing them to get excessively fat--they make ideal birds and
will sing quite nicely all through the winter months in artificial light.
With other birds as companions or even within hearing the pureness
of note so noticeable in the wild bird's song is lacking, which I always
put down to the fact that the song is a conglomeration of all the other
notes of other species. Sexing these birds is rather a difficult matter--
the cock bird being the more active and not quite so light a brown
on the breast and belly. Garden Warblers, Greater and Lesser
Whitethroats are easily reared, but are not all that beautiful as
aviary birds. I will make an exception of the Lesser Whitethroat,
as he really is beautiful and quite hardy to keep. The beautiful grey
colouring which constitutes his clothing stands out always, and this

bird's habits are very active and wiry. In natural surroundings
you will see this bird creeping through thick hedges singing all the
while and making his funny little " chur, chur " noise. The nest,
made entirely of horse hair or other similar material, is very slight and
usually to be found in the thickest of places.
The Garden Warbler is a very plain ordinary bird in appearance,
but as a songster he ranks very high--his shrill, bell-like notes rever-
berating throughout the little spinneys and copses, sheltered in the sun.
As a cage bird he is a disappointment, as he tends to put on too much
flesh with its attendant evils of sore feet, greasy plumage, and brittle
feathers. Mr. Greater Whitethroat is, in many respects, very similarly
constituted, but adopts his natural posture of crouching over the
perches, surveying one with a great deal of suspicion.
The Warblers are many and varied in colouring, disposition, and
song, and some of them need expert attention and the most expensive
of foods--alas not now readily procurable--in order to keep them in
anything like the condition in which they are to be found when living
naturally--and in these days of shortages and economies it is not fair
to these birds to keep them unless one can be sure of giving them the
varied menu which is indeed demanded.
I well remember finding several nests of Dartford Warblers over
a large area of ground and I came away from that locality convinced
they are not so rare as one is led to believe. Their songs are not
unlike that of the Common Hedge Accentor--uttered whilst they
take a short flight in the air. Like most moorland birds the notes of
the song are very shrill and one can hear them at greater distances
than in country containing woods, hedgerows, and running streams.
It was these shrill songs that made it possible to track the bird down
to a small radius and one had only to use a bit of camouflage and sense
to get very close to these delightful little Furze Wrens and watch their
antics.
The Grasshopper Warbler--with a song that rattles like a grass-
hopper, and a habit of creeping about the ground--is one of the most
difficult nests to find and one has to be very patient to beat this
ventriloquist's rival. The young birds are very beautifully marked,
and when reared are very difficult to keep in perfect feather condition.

By J. M. S. Lax
My avicultural experiences are, alas ! like many more, now only
happy memories, but how vivid they stand out during the dark days
through which we are now passing.
ist May, 1927, yes, that was the day when my avicultural activities
commenced, and for fifteen years I have enjoyed the relaxation and
utmost pleasure afforded by this most fascinating of all hobbies. God
willing, I hope to carry on again after this horrid war is over !
Like many others I commenced in a very humble way, a pair of
Roller Canaries and double breeding cage. These I kept in a small
summer house at the bottom of the garden.
As my interest increased so did my stock, and by the end of the first
season had some sixty birds, besides Canaries, Goldfinches, Bullfinches,
Siskins, Redpolls. Over thirty Canaries were bred that first year, so
for a beginner (perhaps beginner's luck) I did well.
The following season I ventured with a pair of African Silverbills
which Messrs. A. W. Gamage supplied for 5s. Although sombre
coloured these charming little featherweights were most interesting.
Due to my ignorance they made several attempts to breed in an
ordinary Canary nest pan without success, but reared two young
when the correct type nest box was put in.
At the end of the second season, owing to cramped quarters and the
mice nuisance, which to quote the late Rev. R. D. Farrar's own words,
" Like the poor they are always with us," I decided to build an outdoor
aviary.
This aviary produced excellent results, Budgerigars doing excep-
tionally well. Red Avadavats also reared three young. Later results
with the Smaller Waxbills proved them to be unreliable and uncertain
breeders. During the winter a pair of local-caught Lapland Buntings
came to hand ; unfortunately they didn't survive long. I haven't been
able to procure another pair.
As the years have gone by big improvements and additions to
accommodation have taken place.
One aviary I set specially aside for a collection of Weavers and
Whydahs, and a beautiful sight they were during the summer. Quite
a number of the famous nests were made and subsequently used by
other birds for nesting sites.
Up here in the North the Java Sparrow and the Cardinals have
wintered without heat out of doors quite comfortably. The White
Java, although less robust than the Grey, have bred well.
The perky Cuban and common Ribbon Finch have reared young
successfully.

On the whole the few Parrakeets kept have done well; actually only
two years before the war when I decided to go in for them.
Red Rosellas bred over seventeen, Stanleys and Bourkes also
successfully reared, with eggs from Meally Rosellas, Pennants, Rock
Peplar, and Bauer's. Gockatiels also did well; although not one of
my favourites, they are very hardy.
The Lorikeets I found very entertaining, with their quaint
mannerisms, good breeders and hardy. Lord Tavistock's recipe was
used here with excellent results. Both Swainson's and Red-collared
have produced many young.
Lovebirds, Peach-faced, Masked, and Fisher's have been very
prolific and hardy.
Thirty Red-hooded Siskins (S. cucullatus ) came to hand in 1937,
really beautiful birds. Results were most disappointing, none being
reared and quite a few were lost. This bird doesn't seem easy to breed
in captivity. A staple diet of niger with maw seed occasionally seems
to suit it best.
Bengalese in all varieties have done well, both for themselves and
as foster parents.
I have only kept a limited number of softbills, and usually only
males. The pairs kept have been Indian Shamas, Royal Starlings,
Dimenelli Weavers, Sacred Kingfishers, White-crested Laughing
Thrushes, and a beautiful pair of Rufous-bellied Niltaras. The hen of
the latter eventually went to Keston to pair with a male they had--
I never heard if anything came of the pairing. I hope it did !
One of my best pets was a Toco Toucan. The quantity of fruit it
could put out of sight was really amazing, approximately 75 lb. of
grapes in a year, besides bananas, oranges, etc., etc. He was wonder-
fully tame and followed me around the aviaries just like a dog. I tried
in vain to secure a mate for him.
The only Indian Hill Mynah I possessed talked very well; it was
the larger species.
My favourite Finches are undoubtedly the Australian Grassfinches
and Parrot Finches. These birds, with their beautiful colours, have
bred well up here and stood up to the northern winters well.
Gouldians (Black and Red varieties), Long-tail, Heck's, Parson,
Cherry, Bicheno, Ruficanda, and Diamond have all reared many
young ones ; also Zebra Finches (White, Silver, and normal).
Two big disappointments were the Painted Finches (. E . picta ) and
the Tasmanian Fire-tailed Finches.
Nearly every species of the Grassfinches have found a place in
my aviaries at one time or another, I never liked to be without any
for long.
The Red-headed Parrot Finches have done excellently, one pair
actually reared twenty-one out of twenty-one eggs, a rather rare

achievement ! Royals, rare and beautiful, never bred, and I found it
difficult to keep in good feather for long. They seemed to like fruit,
and very messy with it they were.
Goodfellows and New Hebridean made no attempts at household
duties.
Let us hope it won't be long before we are all keeping birds again,
although personally I cannot see, even after the war, the large
importations of the good old days. Shipping space I fear will be needed
for necessities of life rather than for luxuries, as aviculture no doubt
comes under. It makes me quite sad to see my aviaries all empty,
and hope it won't be long before some species of birds are housed
therein.

Russ in Bull. 1880 , p. 680, says that he was the first breeder, and
Neunzig says they have been bred both in cages and bird-rooms.
In Great Britain Fasey was the first to succeed, rearing five young in
1906, and gaining the A.S. Medal ( A.M. 1906, 276, 343) ; in B.N.

p. 363 , and this was almost certainly the first success ; Neunzig says
that they have also been bred abroad by a few others. For the U.K.
Fasey was the first to succeed in 1909 : A.S. Medal {A.M. igog , 337 ;
igio, ig8 ; ign, 337 ), and Tavistock bred them later, see B.N. 1317,
231. In America Patrick bred them in California in 1930, teste LOiseau ,
I 93 1 , 716 , and Harvey bred them in Australia about the same time
teste Cayley (p. 239).
Dr. Lendon told me in lit. that hybrids " Blue-winged X Elegants "
were also bred by Harvey about 1939 ; I know nothing further or
which was the male parent, but hope we may get this information
in happier days to come.

according to Russ the English record was at the Zoo. In recent years
(from about 1932) they have been bred freely at Keston and with
Whitley, and abroad in Australia and California.

ELEGANT x TURQUOISINE.
Neunzig {p. J51) says that one of this cross was bred in 1879, but
does not say where or which way. Whitley has recently (1938 I think)
bred the cross and I saw the young.
ROCK GRASS-PARRAKEET (No. 417), N. petrophila {Gld.).
Russ bred them (before 1880), teste Russ {Bull. 1880, 680), the first
and only success at that date. On this event Neunzig {p. 732) writes :
" A pair in Dr. Russ's bird-room shared a cage for months with some
young Burmese Blossomheads and ate greedily the extra food provided
for them--cooked rice, egg-bread, sweet fruit, etc. The hen took
possession of a starling-box hanging in the cage, and one day an
olive-green c Starling ' flew and two spoilt eggs were found in the box."
This Parrakeet has hardly ever been imported since about that time
and is rare and local in Australia. Dr. Lendon told me (1 September ,
1940) that the species had been bred in S. Australia " at least twice ",
and Cayley in his book on Australian Parrots says that a fancier there
had " a clutch of young just leaving the nest " (? Did they live.--E. H.).
A friend of mine out there got two of these birds about 1933, but
they made no attempt at nesting and did not, I think, live long.
TURQUOISINE GRASS-PARRAKEET (No. 418) (JV. pulchella
{Shaw &amp; N.)).
In earlier days when Turquoisines were quite commonly imported
they were often bred ; at the Zoo in numbers from about i860 to 1863,
Farrar about 1880, are two examples ; the last got four young hens
at his first attempt, and having obtained mates for these was for years
never without the species {see Butler (", 234), and the Avic. Mag.
and Bird Notes , of the early years of the century. Abroad Neunzig
says they were first bred at the Antwerp Zoo in 1861, and a little
later by Leuckfeld at Nordhasen, and two other early records (Holland
and France) are to be found in Bull. 1865 , p. 83. Recently a few
Turquoisines have been imported again, and a fresh lot of records
have been made--Tavistock, Keston, etc.--but the best results are
unrecorded ; these are Whitley's at Paignton since about 1932, where
they have been breeding almost like Budgerigars. Harvey in Adelaide,
South Australia, is also breeding them easily.

TURQUOISINE x ELEGANT GRASS-PARRAKEET.
Whitley has bred these hybrids both ways and numerously since
about 1932 ; they are beautiful birds, nearer the Turquoisine than
the Elegant.
TURQUOISINE x SPLENDID GRASS-PARRAKEET.
Two young were reared at the Zoo in 1936, teste the Report , 1336,
p. 37. The cross was also bred in Australia " a few years ago ", teste
Cayley, p. 276.
SPLENDID GRASS-PARRAKEET (No. 419), N. splendida (Gld .).
Seth-Smith in A.M. 1332, 73, showed that the record of breeding
at the Zoo about 1872 (given in Records (1326) and elsewhere) was an
error due to a mistake in the Zoo Official List, 1883, where " hatched 95
was printed instead of the correct " purchased 55 .
Harvey in Adelaide is actually the first breeder ; from 1932 onwards
and when I saw his aviaries in 1933 he had thirty or more of his
aviary-bred birds flying there, and six years later I saw them again
still breeding freely ; he had reared more than fifty and had also
bought six wild-caught birds in 1938, the first that had been obtained
for many years. Two of his aviary-bred birds were presented to His
Majesty the King in 1934. Adelaide Zoo also bred them (A.M. 1334,
108). In England the first success was at Keston in 1934, when two
young (bred from a pair of Harvey birds) were reared ; see Mr.
Boosey's full account in A.M. 1334, 283. Tavistock also bred them
in 1938 (Bird Fancy , gth July , 1338).
A full and most interesting report of these Adelaide breedings
appeared in Cage Birds , 24th September , 4937, headed " Now firmly
established in aviaries 55 there.
Hybrids with the male TURQUOISINE have also been obtained
at the London Zoo.
NEW ZEALAND PARRAKEET (No. 420) ; Red-fronted
Parrakeet, Cyanoramphus novazelandia (Sparrm.).
In the days when these Parrakeets were not uncommonly imported
they appear to have been easily bred. In Bull. 1877, p. 206, the rearing
of twenty-three young by Delaurier in France is recorded, and he
also (teste JVeunzig , 763) reared thirty-eight in 1878. Another French
record is Savage's in A.M. iv, 16 1. Farrar, in his Through a Bird-Room
Window (1323)3 gives an account of the rearing of two young birds
" about fifteen years ago ", but I can find no record of that date or
any other for the U.K. Nowadays they are fully protected as well
as being much less common in N.Z., and so are never imported.
Hybrids with the next are on record.

Abroad they were bred several times in early days, the first breeder
according to Russ being Fiedler in Germany ; Belaurier in France
also bred them {Bull. 1884, 217). In Great Britain Bouskill was the
first to succeed, rearing two young out of five hatched and gaining
the A.S. Medal (A.M. i8g8 , 77; igo2, 37). More recently (1934)
Boosey bred this now extremely rare importation at Keston in 1934,
the whole brood of six being reared {A.M. ig 34, 2g2). They were
also bred by Tavistock in 1937, see Bird Froncy , 7937, i6g , and I think
bred with again the next year.

however, only mentions the hybrids, and the earliest and only record
of success in true-breeding which I can find is Maillards in France

Tasmania in 1932 I was told that they had occasionally been bred in
aviaries there.
Tavistock's success was in 1936, a first for the U.K. ; I saw the
young birds at Peasmarsh in September ; fully reared and perfect ;
they bred again in 1937, see account in A.M. 1937, 283.
[ (NIGHT PARRAKEET (No. 426), Geopsittacus occidentalism Gld .)
De Brisay says that Dr. Russ bred this bird, but Neunzig has nothing
to say about breeding anywhere or by anyone, and the record can
only be considered at best doubtful.]
BUDGERIGAR (No. 427), Melopsittacus undulatus (8. &amp; N.).
Gould was the first, or one of the first, to bring these birds to Europe,
and writes in 1863 that by then they were being bred as easily as
Canaries. According to Russ the first breeder in Germany was Grafin
von Schwerin in 1855, and the first in Germany we may take as
first anywhere, I expect.
By the end of the century they were being bred everywhere com-
mercially, and for a time the tropic disease, " French moult," was
a handicap, but that gradually disappeared.
They are now being bred in all sorts of colours, which have among
the fancy all sorts of complicated names for the various shades, which
are more or less beyond a non-fancier's, as I must confess are those
used by the genetic experts as far as I am concerned. For years only
the yellow variety was known, the blue appearing much later, between
1880 and 1890, but they then appeared to have died out to be
resusciated in Belgium about 1910. For a full account see Cayley's
Budgerigars , 1933.
Hybrids with males of two species of LOVEBIRD are on record,
but are open to more than doubt, as also is that of red Budgerigars
being bred ; two such birds were once in the possession I believe of
a well-known dealer, but they turned out to have been dyed (red ink !).
The above complete the record of breeding results for the PARROTS
which began in January, 1941.
As I asked then : Is there any Member willing and able to complete
it for all birds, that is to produce a new edition of my Records of Birds
Bred in Captivity which was published in 1926? This, of course, to
be after the war and for this I would be delighted to hand over all
my typed records, of which the Parrot ones may be taken as a fair
sample.--E. H.

By David Fleay, Director, Sir Colin MacKenzie Sanctuary, Badger
Creek, Healesville
(Reprinted from The Australasian)
Low clouds and trails of vapour hang across the sombre hills ;
water drips from the lofty foliage and hanging bark of tall gully
eucalypts on drenched ferny underscrub ; snowfalls have come on
the range tops ; and creeks surge along in muddy torrents.
But loudly, clearly, amidst all this cheerlessness of sodden bushlands
rings the swelling challenging melody of the Lyrebird. Our king of
mocking birds revels in the damp, foggy gullies, at their coldest, and
the short days of June and July find him at the supreme height of his
powers as an artist and mimic, when there is no more joyous creature
on earth.
This famous feathered Australian is a very modest-looking, dull-
plumaged bird about the size of a fowl, clad in a plain suit of sooty
brown lightened only by reddish-brown wing feathers. In fact it is
quite a common thing to hear people voicing keen disappointment
about the appearance of Menura nova hollandia after a first meeting
has tumbled preconceived ideas of a Lyre-tailed minstrel with the
plumage of a Peacock.
Actually it is only during display that the cock bird's wonderful tail
adornment may be properly seen. At other times it is carried " at
the trail ", with the two big lyrate feathers on each side with their
colourful sides inward and the central filmy plumes showing only
their blackish brown upper surfaces. It is usually during the month
of May that the mature male birds prepare their several little clearings
among the bracken of gully slopes. In each a low mound is scratched
up--the concert platform from which the winter celebrity concerts
are given.
In fancy let me take you to-day up the Badger Valley between
Mounts Riddell and Toolebewong (Healesville) on a really lucky
visit to the haunt of the Lyrebird. Mind you, such trips have been
known to fail in their object completely !
The towering mountain ash tops are lost in white mist, and as we
walk along an old track over which tree-ferns almost meet on the
northern Riddell slope there is scarcely a foot of this narrow fernless
strip of rich ground that has not been freshly scratched over. But in
all the great sweep of fern-starred range there is no bird sound. The
never-ending rush of the cold Badger Greek waters marks the valley
floor.
Suddenly from higher up on the long Riddell slope among the
gutted stumps and fallen log relics of past fires rings a loud " quolp-
quolp ! " " quolp-quolp ! " the characteristic double call of the

Lyrebird, often prelude to a singing and dancing performance. This
is no exception. Soon a riot of melody breaks on the chill air. With
consummate skill the bird is mimicking the voices of his bush associates,
but adding volume and richness to the notes.
A cautious uphill stalk nearly ends in disaster when two fallow deer
crash off through the scrub. Fortunately they flee in an opposite
direction to that of the Lyrebird. The alert songster pauses, but soon
begins again. It is not the first time he has been visited. All about us
the dark soil and rotting logs have been tilled and scratched respectively
over and over again by the birds in search of crustacean hoppers,
worms, centipedes, millipedes, termites, grubs, and small lizards.
The calls are now very loud and near, and abruptly 15 yards ahead
amidst bracken there is a glimpse of shimmering tail feathers. We
must not step any closer. It is difficult to see clearly, but that lovely
silvery film almost hiding the bird represents the underside of the
twelve central filmy tail feathers which have been thrown up and
forward to spread fanwise over the Lyrebird's back and head. Out
from the rear of these again, and each extending out sideways from
the bird's body to form almost a straight line with one another, lie the
two great lyrate " toothed " feathers also inner side facing skywards.
Their black curled tips are prominent. From the centre of the reversed
butt of the tail stand up two curved whisker-like " lash " feathers, or,
as Mr. A. G. Campbell has called them, " feeler tapes." So we have
accounted now for all of the cock Lyrebird's sixteen tail feathers.
Under the wonderful cascade of feathery lace the performer is
" giving tongue " with a vengeance. One after another we are
enthralled by magnificent fortissimo renderings of the Grey Thrush's
liquid notes, the shrill " cree-cree " of Grey Gurrawongs (Jays), the
tiny chatterings of minute Thornhills, laughter of Kookaburras, the
wistful rolling calls of the great Wedge-tailed Eagle, the rich notes
of the Grey Butcher Bird, flight cries of Crimson Parrots, the drawn-
out whistle and final crack of the Whipbird, the plaintive wail of the
Black Cockatoo, and many others.
Interspersed with these, and most glorious of all, come the joyous
bubbling crescendos of the Lyrebird's own notes. Every now and
again the songster steps from side to side with corresponding sweeps
of his plumage accompanied by loud " quolp-quolps " which echo
afar through the bush. Regular clicking or rattling sounds are also
part of the accompaniment to the dance.
Abruptly the repertoire ends and, folding his tail down and back,
the lustrous-eyed songster walks away with dignified mien, immediately
setting to work with his big powerful feet, one at a time, in the endless
digging out of palatable insect food.
It is noticed that in this process no matter how vigorously he digs
or how big a stone or branch is jerked aside in the grip of his strong

toes and claws, his head, with its keen black eyes, remains as immovably
fixed as that of the Sphinx,
His next bushland performance will probably be staged on another
concert mound, but we have been exceedingly fortunate in both
hearing and seeing him at such close quarters. The memory of that
wet and slippery bush trip, with the exhilarating melody of that
joyous bird at the end of it, remains with us as a particularly vivid
and lasting impression, though it was but a mere glimpse of the
Lyrebird's infinite variety.
Thanks in the main to the years of work undertaken by Mr. Ray
Littlejohns both sound recording of the Lyrebird's voice and films
of its display and habits have been made, and so the star of our
Australian bushland has come to us and to the world in talkies.
One aspect of the Lyrebird's wonderful mimetic ability that has not
received much notice concerns nocturnal sounds. From concerts
I have heard from a male bird between its plumage-preening on a
tree bough, it is evident that, while perched high up one-legged in
a tall wattle or blackwood at night, the birds are not entirely oblivious
of sounds and stirrings in the bush about them. With inimitable
precision comes the throaty gurgling shriek peculiar to the big black
possum glider (flying squirrel). Added to this are remarkable renderings
of the sing-song mopoke call of Boobook Owls and the guttural laughing
of large possums.
The limelight in Lyrebird land must not be allowed to dwell only
on the cock bird. The soberly dressed and slightly smaller hen, with
her plain and comparatively short tail, is also an accomplished vocal
mimic. On many occasions I have listened to a female menura repro-
ducing most of the bush calls so popular with the cock bird, though
I have not heard the swelling notes of ecstasy typical of the male.
It is probable that, like the Satin Bowerbird, the hen visits the place
of display--in this case the dancing mound---and that much of the
cock bird's artistry is aimed at impressing and attracting the plainer
lady or ladies. Though it has been claimed that the birds mate for
life, this seems improbable particularly when it is understood that the
lordly male takes no part in house-building nor in foraging for his
offspring's early livelihood. Perhaps, as a great artist, he is tempera-
mentally unsuited for such mundane acts of drudgery.
During June the hen bird constructs her bulky nest, composed
outwardly of light sticks and dry fern fronds ; it is very comfortably
lined inside with a soft bedding of wiry rootlets and perhaps fibres of
bark. With a side entrance hole it is reminiscent on a grand scale
of the more familiar nest of a ringtailed possum. The stick nursery
may be at ground level among fallen fronds of treeferns, on the edge
of a bank, between the trunks of small trees, in the burnt-out shell
of a tree, or aloft 30 feet or more above the ground. Only a single

egg is laid. It is usually of a dark brown tint, displaying various
darker streaks, spots, and blotches. The youngster has a long infancy,
and presents rather a sad little sight, with large lugubrious eyes
peering out from a fluffy mass of down.
When handled previous to the nest-leaving stage the fledgeling grips
one savagely with its powerful feet, and shrills loudly for mother.
She is seldom far away, and on such occasions displays her alarm and
distress by the single piercing shrieks, the characteristic alarm notes
of Lyrebirds in general. The quick perception, sharp danger cry,
precipitous retreat of any Lyrebird sighting a dog, particularly one
of reddish colour coat, seeems to indicate beyond all doubt that in
the normal course of events it would be a super-fox that could success-
fully stalk these alert birds. Their vision is extraordinarily keen, even
in the deepest and darkest gullies.
Associated with the long childhood of Lyrebirds is the span of years
that elapses before the cock bird becomes mature and attains his
full tail. The cock Lyrebird of a pair living at present in a large bush
enclosure at the Healesville Sanctuary is estimated to be at least
four years of age. Both birds were brought in shortly after the disastrous
bush fires of 1939, yet even now, instead of a complete set of twelve
filmy feathers in the central part of his tail, this bird has only nine
perfect ones. The three missing plumes are represented by two plain
bladed hen feathers, and third that is betwixt and between--partly
bladed and partly filmy. Two years ago his tail contained four of
these hen feathers. His lyrate feathers, though long, are narrow and
ribbon-like compared with those of a fully developed bird.
From observations of several past winter seasons, it seems evident
that this cock bird is still immature. He sings and mimics cleverly,
but so far has not been seen to display in the manner of older birds.
In May this season he constructed his first small dancing mound, but
so far no one has seem him showing off upon it.
Evidently it is not until cock Lyrebirds are five or six years old that
they are fully developed, both physically and artistically. I recollect
having seen only one photograph of a male with incomplete tail in
the act of displaying, and in this particular instance the bird happened
to be only one plain feather short of the full set.
A second young male Lyrebird at the Healesville Sanctuary which,
remarkable to relate, was foster-fed by both Lyrebirds of the pair
already mentioned, is also a good example of the slow development
of its species. Though now nineteen months old the bird still retains
a plain hen tail of undifferentiated feathers, totalling the usual sixteen
in number. As tame as a farmyard fowl this youngster is a wonderful
specimen. He eats a good deal of " civilized " food in adddition to
worms and grubs. No concerts have yet been heard from him, though
he calls loudly in the characteristic " quolp-quolp He is distin-

guished from a hen bird by larger size, more powerful legs, and a
longer, more curved, and broader tail.
Items in the future mimicry of this young bird are awaited with
eagerness, for within easy and constant hearing are both Whistling
and Sea Eagles, Stone Plover, Brolgas, Emus, Dingoes, and a variety
of inland Cockatoos and Parrots, foreign to the usual environment of
Lyrebirds. After several years of association with the voices of these
same birds and animals it is truly remarkable that the older cock
Lyrebird has failed to reproduce any of them. His repertoire, which is
an extensive one, is quite often given, but it only consists of the mimicry
of voices strictly indigenous to the neighbouring ranges whence he
came.
The question arises whether the Lyrebird's early quiet years are
the receptive ones, and is it incapable at later stages of memorizing
new sounds ?
Though magnificent and unsurpassed in his faultless mocking of
bush associates menura is not nearly so quick on the uptake as the really
clever Satin Bowerbird. I recently heard a green hen of the latter
species reproduce quite loudly the repertoire of a Lyrebird that it
had recently heard. It included that bird's own native calls and second-
hand mimicry of at least a dozen bush birds' voices. In the case of
the Bowerbird, however, mimetic memory appears to be short, and
in the absence of the original of a particular imitated song or cry it
soon appears to be replaced by something more topical.

I have just lost an old Hangnest. I had him for fourteen years, and
he was an adult when given to me--pale yellow and black, which
denotes he had at least been in captivity over one moult before I had
him. The captured birds (unless colour fed) lose the deep orange
after they moult in captivity, just as our Linnet loses its scarlet breast.
This bird, however, was remarkably tame, and every summer was
allowed complete liberty. Nosey kept his deep orange colour until his
last moult, when, if from old age or not I don't know, he came
out half-pale yellow, half deep rich orange, and then, having brought
himself to full flower, so to speak, threw up the sponge and died !
For two seasons I colour fed him, then gave up as the natural wild
food, insects, etc., kept him in his perfect orange. When let out
of his cage into the garden for the first time, after, say, six
months, he would fly on to the veranda railings (please note that
his mode of progress was always the same, year after year), almost
sit down on his tail, and fluff himself out and whistle a few notes,
then draw himself up very " flat " and hop a few inches, crouch, dilate
his eyes, and then he was off like an arrow of gold, over the garden,
through the orchard, and straight up to the aviaries, where he would
sit on the wire and do his best to murder whatever bird he could get
his beak at. He was a killer, this bird, nothing smaller, or indeed
nothing as big as he was himself, was safe from him ; one had to die,
and he survived many battles. In old age he became extremely
vicious with strangers, darting on to their shoulders and pecking at
eyes, in fact he really was dangerous to eyes, and had to be shut up
if anyone came over to see the garden or birds, etc.
He remained faithful to me and followed me about everywhere,
making sort of little clucking noises of pleasure, at the same time
fluffing his feathers out and dilating his eyes ; he did this to no
one else. He would in late summer always " mate " on my hand,
and at this time (July to late August) regularly made a cup-shaped
nest suspended from twigs like a sort of well-made hammock. He
used the same yew tree for his nest for several seasons. I got him
hen birds once or twice, hoping to rear some young ones. Some-
times it would go well for a very short time, but eventually he
always killed them by pecking their brains out. Tame cock birds
of many species are useless to breed from ; they get too fond
of their human friends to pay any attention to their own
species. He did several tricks, but the one that took the longest
to perfect was to " sit " like a retriever, until told to move. He would
" sit " where I put him and stay there until told he could go. He

literally soaked himself in his bath three or four times a day ; he
was a great bather, he would then sit in front of the fire to get dry.
He was quite safe to take out in the car in a little cage for picnics
and be let out to fly wherever one was. His greatest delight was to
remove green fly from the roses, but as he would sometimes sit on
tender shoots his weight would break them down, so, as a gardener,
I took a poor view of him. A bird he particularly disliked is a very
handsome green Glossy Starling from Kenya, also a remarkably
tame bird--of which I may write later on perhaps, if the Editor is
hard enough up to want me to write anything else---which I doubt.
Nosey .(for this was his name) knew all the ways into the house, and
the difficulty was keeping him out ; every window had to be shut or
wired over. He was as destructive as a hound puppy, tearing books
up, opening cigarette boxes and throwing cigarettes all over the place,
tearing them to ribbons, and sending the servants mad. He was
a very fine whistler, and would sit on the top of a telegraph pole or
on the top of a very high old dead wych elm and whistle his beak off--
luckily well out of range from the small boys 5 catapults. I think
Hangnests are almost ideal cage birds, as I have never met one that
could not be tamed--but their " crab 55 is that they do get vicious
with strangers and children as they grow old. My bird was fed
on a good insectivorous mixture, various fruits, boiled rice, boiled
potato, and twice a week small scraps of raw meat (first soaked for a
few minutes in water), half an orange a day, lettuce or other green food
every day ; green food is, I think, most important, in fact just as important
as the insect food. Mealworms, of course, he had, about twenty a day,
sometimes more, sometimes less. One day he had removed the lid
from the mealworm tin and had a party all on his own--talk about
" hangover 55 , that bird knew all about feeling liverish ! In one
sense he was a good gardener, for there was no insect, barring woolly
caterpillars, he would not deal with. If he were sitting on one's hand
he would very carefully go over all rosebuds for green fly, never
breaking a single flower, but if on his own I must own he was not a
good gardener, for he grasped the shoot with his feet and wrenched
the end off--he had no relation to a " green finger ". A Raven and
a Peacock combined, in fact, could not do more damage than Nosey
if he were hungry, otherwise he was no trouble in the garden, except
that he would pull up labels and eat dianthus buds. I miss him
terribly, and always shall.

wide, 30 feet long, with a separate store room at one end of 4 by 10 feet.
The west end joins the enclosed porch of my cottage and is separated
from it by doors 6 feet wide made of vertical wires, and giving the
appearance of the side of a bird cage. Ten feet of the length at this
end is gabled, the peak being 12 feet high. The balance of the roof
is flat, 8 feet high, with \ in. wire mesh ceiling over which are 4 in.
bats of mineral wool. The roof is in four sections, which allows it
and the mineral wool being removed in summer. The south side has
six screened windows which with the door take up the whole of this
space to within 3 feet of the floor. All walls are filled with mineral
wool bats and finished on the inside with natural coloured British
Columbia fir plywood. Arborvitae to the full height of the room is
used for roosting sites. The floor is fine sand 3 feet deep. Along the
north wall is a solid row of built-in cages.
These are 3 fget high and attached to the ceiling so that birds cannot
get on top, and are used only for birds which begin to fight in the
spring before they are moved to the summer aviary. Fourteen parti-
tions made of \ in. wire mesh on frames, may be slid into position
to divide such birds when necessary. When unoccupied the birds
have the freedom of these cages, the doors being left open.
The aviary is heated from the house furnace in winter. It is quite
easy to keep the temperature sufficiently high for the birds to be
comfortable on account of the mineral wool linings and the double
glass cloth on the sash.
The summer aviary is octagonal ; 25 feet in diameter, 6 feet high
at the periphery, and 10 feet high at the centre. Unmated birds are
kept in the centre compartment which is 13 feet in diameter. Around
the periphery are eight nesting compartments each, of course, facing
a different direction. To protect the birds from Hawks and Owls,
2 in. wire mesh covers the roofs and sides, and is placed 4 inches
from the inner wire.
April of 1942 was exceptionally fine and warm, during the latter
part of the month the temperatures reaching as high as 85 degrees
in the shade at times. For this reason I moved all but the smaller
birds such as Indigo Buntings and native Sparrows to the summer
aviary. This proved to be a mistake as the weather in May became
very wet and comparatively cold, and two of the female Rose-breasted

Grosbeaks who had finished their nests before the middle of the month
became egg-bound, as did the female Cowbird. I lost the two Gros-
beaks but managed to save the latter.
It is my practice to allow all birds which build in the aviary to have
their liberty after the first egg is laid. In each nesting compartment
I have a small gate in the wire, about 3 feet from the ground and
use a 4 in. wide shingle for a platform in this opening. During
incubation I open the gate in the morning and allow the birds to
go in and out as they please during the day, and close the gate before
dusk after making sure that the birds are inside. At times I have to
call them from the woods, but usually I just watch for their return.
The reason I enclose them at night is to protect them as long as possible
from owls. After the young are hatched and until they are weaned
I do not close the entrance at night as it is necessary for the parents
to begin seeking food for the young at daylight.
Compartment No. 1 was occupied by a pair of Evening Grosbeaks ;
No. 2 Wood Thrushes ; No. 3 Cardinals ; No. 4 Rose-breasted
Grosbeaks ; No. 5 Bluebirds ; No. 6 Catbirds ; No. 7 Rose-breasted
Grosbeaks ; and No. 8 Evening Grosbeaks. As these compartments
were filled I had to let the Baltimore Orioles and Cedar Waxwings
build in the main part of the aviary, and the Horned Larks in the
winter bird-room.
When the Evening Grosbeaks had laid their first eggs I opened the
gates. Although these two pairs of birds had never had their liberty
since their capture they had no particular difficulty in finding the
openings. They had not enjoyed their liberty long before a Sharp-
shinned Hawk appeared--a bird which had not been known to nest
in this locality for some twenty years. During the day the Hawk killed
the male from compartment 8. I thereupon closed his mate in, also
the other pair, as never before having had success with these birds
I could not afford to take further chances of losing them in this way.
Four eggs were laid by the female in compartment No. 1. One
egg hatched on 26th July, the other being clear. Plain boiled custard,
nestling egg food, earthworms, ant larvae, and what insects I could
sweep from the grass with a net were supplied, and the nestlings were
fed by both parents. All the seed which was regularly fed to them
was withheld, for former experience had shown that they would feed
such unsuitable food to the youngster.
On 3rd July the female began lining the old nest while the baby
was in it. I placed a deserted American Robin's nest about a foot
from the Grosbeak's nest and put the youngster in this. Here it was
taken care of by both parents while the female continued to reline
and build up the old one. On 7th July the first egg was laid and the
fourth egg on the 10th. On 22nd July the fourth egg hatched, the
other three being clear. The female only fed this nestling, but after

three days neglected it to such an extent that I had to take it from
her as she would not cover it at night. She refused to feed it on the
25th, and gave all of her attention to the first one, and I was able to
keep it alive only until the 27th. The first was duly weaned and is
to-day the replica of his father with the exception that his beak is
larger, the father being the Montana sub-species with a smaller beak
than the Eastern variety. So far as I know this is the second time these
birds have been reared in captivity.
The female Evening Grosbeak in compartment No. 8 laid four eggs,
but all proved to be clear. I took these away from her and gave her
the only very young nestling I could find in a wild bird's nest--a
three-day-old Indigo Bunting. Although these birds are one of the
smallest of our Canadian song-birds she succeeded in rearing it to
maturity, and it is now, in February, 1943, in full plumage and
beginning to sing.
One pair of Wood Thrushes mated in the main compartment and
I placed them in No. 2. On 24th May the nest was completed. The
first egg was laid the next day, and the third on the 27th. I opened
the gate in their compartment but they, while able to find the opening,
were unable to locate it when they came back. Therefore to allow
them liberty I had to take down the whole upper front of their com-
partment, this upper part being 3 by 10 feet. I did not close them in
after the Hawks began attacking for the reason that they were ground
feeders and were in considerably less danger than any of the others
except the Catbirds. For several weeks, however, their great danger
was visitors. I had to warn these continually to watch every step as
the Thrushes were so often under foot, and were so unconcerned
about strangers that the danger of stepping on them was very great.
However, they reared the youngsters to maturity. Although nestling
food was always before them they fed the young almost entirely on
insects which they gathered from under the surrounding shrubbery.
In No. 3 I placed an old mated pair of Cardinals. The female built
a nest as she had done for years, but each of her eggs was soft-shelled
and dropped in the compartment. Thinking that natural food might
render her condition such that hard-shelled eggs could be laid--
calcium supplied to her did not have this effect--I opened the small
gate. The male, however, was killed by a Hawk the first day he went
out. Later I placed a one-year-old male with her and again opened the
gate. Both went out and, so far as I know, were killed, as neither
returned.
A mated pair of Rose-breasted Grosbeaks was placed in No. 4.
In a few days the nest was built and three eggs laid. When the first
had been deposited I opened the gate. Both birds soon found it and
had no difficulty in locating it when they came back from feeding on
natural food. In the case of these birds the male went out first and

when he returned usually took his place on the nest while the female
had her turn hunting insects.
At the same time the Catbirds were at liberty. Unfortunately the
male Catbird found this gate and entered it when it happened that
both birds were out at the same time, and threw two of the Grosbeak's
eggs out of the nest. The third egg hatched, however, and it was
soon apparent the youngster was a female. Although this little one
was not handled nor hand-reared she turned out to be one of those
very rare birds which showed no resentment whatever at being handled
when she became mature. Oddly enough, too, she turned out to be
one of the most quarrelsome of my Rose-breasts, none of which are
very gentle with others of their kind.
In No. 5 I placed a mated pair of Bluebirds. When the nest was
finished and the first egg laid I opened the gate. Neither of these birds
had any difficulty in locating the entrance after they had once found it.
Five eggs were laid and all hatched. When the oldest was five days
old the mother was killed by a Hawk. The killing of all these birds
happened during two days. The day the mother Bluebird was killed
I stayed around the aviary all day with a gun, but she happened to
go to the vegetable garden just beyond my sight and was killed before
I located her.
I at once closed the male in. During the previous year the female
that was killed and a different mate had reared two males. One of
these males was very dear to her still, and oddly enough her present
mate, too, was fond of him. During this nesting season, however, her
mate would have killed the other brother had he been able to get at
him. The favoured one, too, was exceedingly fond of the mated pair
and continually tried to get in to their compartment. I allowed
him in and he at once found the gateway and began helping the father
to take care of the five babies. I let them out only during the part
of the day when I had time to follow them with a gun, and it was an
exceedingly anxious time for I knew the hawks were around still.
Both little fellows worked very hard, but they seemed unable to
rear all five. Three of the nestlings died within a few days. Probably
the reason was that the father did not cover the young during the
night. Both remaining babies--the two oldest, a male and a female--
thrived however. The male turned out to be one of the most confiding
birds I have had, while his sister, although coming to my hand for
food does not trust me to more than this extent.
A mated pair of Catbirds were placed in No. 6. These birds, too,
had no difficulty with the entrance gate. Only three eggs were laid
and all hatched. For the reason that the parents hunted insect life
mostly on the ground I did not enclose them, for they were not in
great danger from the Hawks. I was unable, however, to allow them
liberty after the young were well able to fly for the reason that they

coaxed the little ones to the entrance and out. At times I had con-
siderable difficulty in locating and bringing back these babies. Another
difficulty with these birds, too, was the fact that the male was con-
tinually going into the compartments of the other birds with the
object apparently of destroying their eggs. It was not that he did not
know his own entrance, for odd as it may seem, each pair of birds
was quite well aware of where the entrance to their compartment
was placed, even though each gate was identical in appearance and
size. These gates, too, were only io feet apart, although each faced
in a different direction.
Before the young were weaned the female Catbird, without relining
her nest, laid three more eggs in the old one. This nest had been made
in a clump of cedar boughs and by this time the cedar had turned
brown and ugly so I decided that I would cut away carefully the dead
parts and replace with fresh green branches. This I did without even
disturbing the female. However, she showed her resentment by
immediately throwing her three eggs on the ground after I left the
compartment. I had no idea that she would resent what I was doing
for she had no objection to me being quite close to her during her
first brooding, nor did she object a great deal to me feeding her young.
In No. 7 I placed another pair of Rose-breasted Grosbeaks. The
male was my first Rose-breast, seven years old and a very lovable bird.
As usual I opened the gate and during the first day both birds took
their turns at going out. The second day the male was taken by one
of the Hawks. Two eggs only of the three hatched. When the young
were two and three days old both died. When examining them I found
that the nest was swarming with red mites. This was the first nest
I had ever had which had become infested with these parasites and
I had given no thought to such an infestation. No other nest in the
aviary was infested and it was a decided puzzle as to how they had
gotten into this one. Undoubtedly the nestlings perished here from
this cause.
One pair of Cedar Waxwings built a nest in the main compartment,
but both the one egg laid and the nest were destroyed by one of the
inmates. I had only one Baltimore Oriole, a female. She, too, built
in the main compartment and laid, but of course the eggs were infertile.
The Horned Lark built a nest in the winter bird-room and hatched
two chicks. Unfortunately a chipmunk found its way in and destroyed
both young and nest when the little ones were five days old.
Because of one pair of Hawks it proved to be an exacting and only
partially successful season.

THE WILD GAME PHEASANTS
By Jean Delacour

The Game Pheasants, or true Pheasants ( Phasianus ) are now so
widespread in Europe and in America as sporting birds, that it may
not be unnecessary to trace their origin.
In a wild state, Pheasants of the present genus are found from the
northern Caucasus through Central Asia to China and Japan. They
have a continuous range in eastern Asia, but elsewhere they inhabit
numerous separate areas : valleys and mountain slopes, plains and
oases, in other words, grounds offering them the sort of habitat they
require. It consists of open country with sufficient water, covered
with long grass and dotted about with bushes and trees. To the
contrary of practically all other Pheasants, these birds do not live
in forests ; they are attracted by cultivation and one often finds
them around corn, wheat, and paddy fields. They are accustomed
to cold and changeable climates and prove, therefore, very easy to
acclimatize in North America and in Europe.
All true Pheasants are closely related, sufficiently so that fertile
hybrids between any two forms can be produced. They almost
completely resemble one another in shape and habits, and this has
led many authors to consider them all as subspecies of one species.
It is the more tempting to admit that they replace one another
geographically and in reality form one large natural genus and super
species. But it is more advisable to divide them into three distinct
taxonomic species on account of their very different colour pattern.
In the western half of their range, one finds birds with a more or
less homogeneous general red colour, the lower back being always
reddish brown ; I consider them as belonging to the species Phasianus
colchicus. The best known form of this group is the Black-neck, four
very close races of which live north and south of the Caucasus and
around the west and south of the Caspian Sea. It even has been
asserted that the birds from eastern Bulgaria, Thrace, and European
Turkey, along the Black Sea, represent a genuine wild form (P. c.
europaeus. Hachisuka, L'oiseau, 1937, pp. 3-6.) It is difficult either to
admit or reject this opinion in the present state of our knowledge.
The form introduced by the Greeks and the Romans into many
parts of Europe is most probably the south Caucasian bird, P. colchicus
colchicus , very close to the present so-called Old English Black-neck.
The second most popular member of the group is the Mongolian
Pheasant (P. c. mongolicus), much larger and greener than the Black-
neck, with white in the wing and a white collar. The Prince of
Wales' Pheasant (P. c. principalis) from south-east Turkestan, a very red
bird, without a white ring neck, has also been introduced into Europe

in the early nineties, but has since disappeared. There are other
related subspecies, with or without collars (the white ring neck is
not an important character and varies easily with distribution).
They all have a discontinuous distribution, each of them being secluded
in larger or smaller ranges surrounded by desert or high mountains
where Pheasants cannot live.
The second or eastern group of Pheasants constitute the species
Phasianus torquatus and the Chinese Ring-neck is the most familiar of
them. They have a more varied plumage than the western birds, and
their rump and lower back is always greyish-green. Usually their
upper back and flanks are yellow spotted with black, their wings
chestnut red and grey, and their tail pale greenish or brownish barred
with black. Three forms, which link the two groups, are found
isolated in oases of western China and Turkestan, and another one
in Formosa. All the others have a more or less continuous distribution
in China, reaching Northern Burma, Tonkin, and Korea. The
Chinese Ring-neck (P. t. torquatus) has been acclimatized in consider-
able numbers in N. America and in Europe, where the Corean Ring-
neck {P. t. karpowi), Pallas' (P. c. pallasi ), and the Formosan (P. t.
formosanus) have also been introduced.
The Green Pheasant of Japan (P. versicolor) has a very different
colour pattern, and represents a separate species, having its under parts
entirely green. There is only a slightly differentiated race in the
southern island of Kiu-Siu. The Green Pheasant has been repeatedly
introduced into Europe as a game bird.
Pheasants were introduced first by the Greeks and later on by the
Romans, into many parts of Europe, and it was then the Black-neck
from the Caucasus. The bird must have remained in a pure state
for many centuries, as it seems that the Chinese Ring-neck, and other
races, were imported and released in any numbers only during the
nineteenth century. At present European birds vary in different
countries and districts, even coverts, according to the greater or
smaller addition of other blood to the old stock of Black-necks. The
Chinese and other Ring-necks (Pallas', Corean, Formosan), the Prince
of Wales', the Mongolian, and the Versicolor have been added to
different degrees on account of their different qualities, Mongolians
to increase size, and Versicolor to develop high flight and speed
principally.
In North America, most of these different birds have been introduced
at the same time and altogether so that the Black-neck is less dominant.
In certain regions, in the north-west in particular, the Chinese Ring-
neck is found pure of mixture.
Several accidental colour-phases of Pheasants have occurred and
have been selected artificially, such as the White and Isabelline
varieties. But during the last part of the nineteenth century (about

1888), a very interesting dark mutation suddenly appeared among the
hybridized feral birds of England. It long remained scarce, but in
1926 it was already much commoner and was named P. c. tenehrosus
by Hachisuka. This bird, now well known as the Melanistic Mutant,
possessed the attraction of novelty added to those of a high flying
capacity and a heavier weight, so that it soon became popular, being
reared and liberated all over the world. It easily becomes dominant
and has a tendency to grow darker and darker. To-day there is a
strain of birds in which both cocks and hens are of an almost uniform
dark purple and green and blue.

years ago. No. 1, a hen, arrived in 1922, No. 2, a cock, in 1928, so they have lived

now the hen is beginning to look a little passe.

An Appeal to Aviculturists with Surplus Birds.
The Editor of the Avicultural Magazine has received an appeal from a Home Office
approved school for young delinquents for assistance in stocking the school's aviaries.
The headmaster writes : " Among the factors leading to a boy's rehabilitation, I rate
the association with birds and animals very highly, and experiments over the past
sixteen years have proved that the care of living things has a lasting influence in the
lives of many of the people committed to our charge. I have been recommended
to get into touch with you in order to discover whether it is possible to obtain birds
that are perhaps imperfect from a breeding point of view. Unfortunately this is
one of the activities for which no official funds are available, and I am therefore
dependent very largely upon the generosity of those who are interested." The
school has a stock of bird seed, and there is good water in the grounds. The Editor
will be glad to send fuller details to any member of the Society interested, and earnestly
requests those who may have birds which have become surplus on account of feeding
difficulties to consider the above suggestion for disposing of them, and to communicate
with her.

ROOSEVELT'S PURPLE WAXBILL

Of the genus Granatina , the Grenadier Waxbills, the Violet-eared
Waxbill, G. granatina granatina , of South Africa, has been known to
aviculturists for many years as a most desirable though rare and
delicate species. On very few occasions specimens of the more richly
coloured Purple Waxbill, G. ianthinogaster have reached this country.
It is distributed throughout East Africa and several races have been
described, including the subject of the accompanying coloured plate,
G. ianthinogaster roosevelti , described by Mearns Smith in 1913, from the
Nyiro River, Kenya.
On 25th May, 1933, that excellent collector, C. S. Webb, returned
to London from an expedition to the Aberdare Mountains and
neighbourhood, with a considerable collection of rare birds, including
a specimen of this rare Waxbill from which the coloured drawing
was made.
The Grenadier Waxbills are certainly among the most beautiful
of the smaller ornamental Finches, though undoubtedly frail and
needing great care. Although the Violet-ear has been known for a
long time, it has always been rare and, so far as I know, has never
been successfully bred, perhaps on account of the fact that, when
feeding its young it requires a constant supply of small living insects,
and no substitute is adequate. No doubt Purple Waxbills are of
similar habits.
Let us hope that, when the world returns to peace and sanity,
more of these rare gems will reach this country and become available
to aviculturists with suitable means of dealing with such hot-house
treasures.

I 14 YVONNE BURN-BIRDS AT THE ZOO, CEYLON
BIRDS AT THE ZOOLOGICAL GARDENS,
DEHIWELA, CEYLON

I was very interested in Major Lendon's recent article on birds
observed by him in Ceylon during his recent visits, more especially
as he visited us frequently and often accompanied Dr. Hill and myself
on our official visits to the Zoo. We had expected from him an account
of his impressions thereon, similar to the one he so ably gave earlier
of his experiences in the Gizeh collection. That he was equally
interested in our exhibits was obvious, and I was pleased to see, from
the last paragraph of his article, that he considers a brief account
would interest the Magazine's readers. I am, therefore, adopting his
suggestion of putting a few notes together, although I must confess
that there is little of outstanding note for record.
The Colombo Zoo is situated some seven miles from the city centre
on a site covering approximately i i-J acres. The situation is ideal,
not only from the zoological point of view, but also as a natural
beauty spot, since Colombo itself is almost entirely built of flat
ground ; whereas the gardens repose on one of the few elevated spots
for many miles around. The collection was originally started by the
late Mr. John Hagenbeck, the well known collector and trapper, in
1932. At first it was used principally as a clearing station for animals
captured not only in Ceylon, but also elsewhere in the East. These
were destined for Western collections ; and were replaced periodically
by American and West African consignments travelling the other
way to zoos in Sumatra, Java, India, and so on. Consequently we
had the advantage of a shifting population, with always something
fresh to see, though there was the concomitant drawback that old
friends were frequently transferred elsewhere. Still, there was always
a basic collection that the management of the time kept for permanent
exhibition in Ceylon. One must admire the site chosen by Mr. Hagen-
beck which, at that time, was well outside the city, almost in the
jungle ; but, with the advance of ribbon-building--a pernicious
influence by no means confined to occidental cities--Dehiwela has
become a suburb, losing much of its charm thereby.
A private company was formed to operate the Zoo. This functioned
till 1936, when from financial and other reasons, it was impossible to
continue on this basis. Representations were made to the Ceylon
Government to take over ; at first without success, despite the recom-
mendations of a special advisory committee set up for the purpose.
Eventually things got so bad that public feeling was aroused and the
Government finally stepped in and took charge, though with modifica-
tions in the arrangements suggested by the aforementioned com-

mittee. This committee was then converted, after some changes in
personnel, into an advisory committee, which, in turn, appointed a
standing committee for the actual administration and day-to-day
operation of the concern. Generally this was a better arrangement,
but the temporary housing of many rare and beautiful species ceased
with Mr. Hagenbeck's retirement.
The gardens were not originally planned on any special lines, apart
from exigencies of the terrain, which were, very wisely, left undisturbed.
The cages have been built on terraces. There are two large ponds--
relics of former quarries--on which are kept, more or less at freedom,
all our waders and other waterfowl. Very few of these are pinioned,
the usual procedure with new stock being to clip one wing. When
the feathers have been replaced the birds have, by then, become
accustomed to their new home and do not tend to wander. Our only
serious losses from this cause have been the Mandarin Ducks (Aix
galericulata) , Australian Sheldrake ( Casarca tadornoides) , and Cormorants
(.Phalacrocorax niger and P. fuscicollis) . A couple of rafts on each pond
add to the appearance by attracting the Darters ( Anhinga melanogaster ),
who sit for hours drying their wings in their characteristic way after
their diving exploits. They are also used freely by the Whistling Teal
(Dendrocygna javanica) and the various Herons. Two of our Cormorants
had nested in a tree overhanging the upper pond, but somebody
disturbed them and they took a dislike to the spot and migrated.
The only waders not allowed their freedom are the pugnacious kinds,
such as the Greater Adjutants ( Leptoptilos dubius ), and the various
Cranes, of which we have Crowned {Balearica pavonina), Sarus ( Mega -
lornis antigone ), Demoiselle (. Anthropoides virgo), and Lilford {M. grus
lilfordi) . We have had a measure of success in the breeding of Black
Swans ( Chenopis atrata), whose lovely cygnets grace the lower pond
from time to time. Few of these, however, have been reared to
maturity, some broods being carried off wholesale with one cause or
another. Mongooses and civets are responsible for some of this, as
well as for fatalities among smaller waders such as Spoonbills (. Platalea
leucorodia major), Ibises ( Threskiornis melanocephalus) , and Gulls ( Lams
brunneicephalus ). Of the Storks mention should be made of the hybridiz-
ing of the Lesser Adjutant ( Leptoptilus javanicus) with the Painted
Stork {Ibis leucocephalus) , already recorded by Dr. Hill in the Magazine.
Other representatives have been the European White Stork ( Ciconia
ciconia ) and the Parson Stork ( Dissoura episcopa). The Bitterns, repre-
sented by the Little Green ( Butorides striatus ), the rare Black (. Dupetor
flavicollis) , and occasionally by the migratory Malay ( Gorsachius melano-
lophus) , have to be kept caged to guard other birds from their attempts
to transfix the latter's eyeballs.
Struthious birds have been very well represented till lately. Our
Ostriches ( Struthio australis) are constantly laying and incubating

their eggs, and one year we were successful in rearing a couple of
babies, only to lose them during our absence from Colombo, at the
age of over twelve months. Since then several clutches have been
laid, but nearly all have proved infertile. It is problematical whether
in this damp climate the young would ever reach maturity, even
with the greatest possible care. All our Emus ( Dromaeus ) have
succumbed to violent deaths, as have also at least two Cassowaries,
including our rare d'Albertis's (C. casuarius sclateri ) female, which
we described last year in the Magazine. We are left with only one
C. unappendiculatus suffusus. Two Cassowary casualties have been
from drowning in the adjacent pond.
We have nothing outstanding in the gallinaceous line, nor have
breeding results been particularly good here ; possibly from over-
crowding. This we shall be able to prove when our Pheasants are
housed in the proposed new pheasantry. Numerous eggs have been
laid, but the hens make no attempt to incubate them, with the excep-
tion of one Ring-necked ( Phasianus torquatus) who has been sitting in
a clump of guinea-grass for the last few weeks on a clutch of five eggs.
She is mated to a Reeves's ( Syrmaticus reevesii). Whether the eggs
prove fertile and, even if so, whether the hen manages to rear her
chicks are matters of conjecture. One feature which militates against
the breeding of Pheasants and similar ground birds in public collec-
tions is the constant battle between the interests of science and those
of the visiting public. The latter expect, and indeed have a right, to
see the birds, and the seclusion required by the birds hardly permits
this. These drawbacks do not, of course, apply to species which
employ nest boxes and the like. In several cases (Peafowl, Quail, and
Silver Pheasant) I have tried artificial incubation with success, but
both Golden and Amherst Pheasants have proved infertile so far.
The Ceylon Spur-fowl (Galloperdix bicalcarata) regularly produce
their two broods a year ; and I would much like to see similar results
with the Jungle-fowl ( Gallus lafayettei ), though strangely enough, this
very common and decorative species has never been represented in
the collection, in spite of the fact that, at the time of the amalgamation
with the Colombo Museum collection, there were twenty or more
birds in the latter ; but, owing to some misunderstanding, arising
out of the disastrous state of affairs at the Museum prior to the air-raid
on Colombo, these birds were never handed over. We have both the
Blue-breasted Quail ( Excalfactoria chinensis), an indigenous bird, and
the Australian Brown Quail ( Tpsilophorus ypsilophorus) . The latter
breeds very freely, but we get a lot of deaths from intestinal worm
infections. We always took this bird to be the Stubble Quail, and
we have to thank Major Lendon for the correct identification.
Pigeons are poorly represented, but by far the most valuable are
the Crowned Pigeons ( Goura coronata ), which Mr. Frost collected for

us in New Guinea. They are now old inhabitants ; and, although
they have been given every facility, so far they have shown no inclina-
tion to nest. I am not sure that they are a true pair, and would
welcome any reader's advice on the sexing of this species. Our
Bronze-wings ( Chalcophaps indica robinsoni) breed regularly and rear
their young in a small bush in the middle of their aviary.
So far as I am aware there is no record of the breeding of any of
the birds of prey, but as these are rare breeders in captivity this
is not surprising ; though the breeding of the Sociable Vulture in
London (see Morrison-Scott, P.#.S. y 1936) and the Griffon at Chester
(see Mottershead, 1941) raised our hopes in respect of our Griffons.
As, however, they share a cage with a pair of Hooded Vultures
(.Necrosyrtes m. monachus ) much cannot be expected. We are well
supplied with eagles. Our most imposing one is the Australian
Wedge-tailed Eagle ( Uroaetus audax ), followed, in order of size, by
the local White-bellied Sea-Eagle ( Haliaetus leucogaster) , Tank Eagle
{Ichthyophaga ichthyaetus plumbiceps ), and two specimens of Ceylon
Serpent-Eagle (. Haematornis cheela spilogaster) . Among the Owls, our
family of Collared Scops ( Otus bakkamoena ) are very charming and
have bred. The larger species represented are the Forest Eagle-Owl
(. Huhua nipalensis), Brown Wood-Owl {Strix indranee), and Brown Fish-
Owl (. Ketupa zeylonensis) . The second of these is supposed to be the
Devil-bird of Sinhalese folk-lore, though many ascribe the weird cries
of this fabulous creature to the Serpent-Eagle {Spizaetus cirrhatus ),
of which a specimen formerly lived in the same aviary. A neigh-
bouring cage is occupied by a colony of Brahminy Kites (. Haliastur
indus ).
For the size of the collection, we are well represented by the Parrot
tribe, having such colourful species as the Blue-and-yellow (Ara
ararauna) and Red-and-green Macaws ( A . chloroptera) , two species
of Eclectus, Leadbeater's Cockatoo ( Kakatoe leadbeateri) , and several
of the white types. Lories and Lorikeets are also well represented,
the Dusky Lory {Eos fuseata) being one of the most valuable. Swain-
son's ( Trichoglossus moluccanus) have bred.
Major Lendon may be the cause of our breeding the Pennant's
Parrakeets {Platycercus elegans). We had two birds which we always
thought were of the same sex, or, at any rate, we were too timid to
risk them together, knowing the pugnacity of this genus. On Major
Lendon's advice, we took the risk and find them to be very friendly
disposed to each other, and one of them is already taking interest in
the nest box ; we have now, therefore no doubts that they are a true
pair. A tragedy has recently been enacted in one of our Parrot
nest-boxes. A lovely female (and females are very scarce) of the
Great White-crested Cockatoo {Kakatoe alba ) was mated with a
Greater Sulphur-crest {K. galerita) and was sitting on a couple of eggs.

I 1 8 YVONNE BURN-BIRDS AT THE ZOO, CEYLON
Last week a cobra was discovered in the box, having swallowed the
two eggs and killed the sitting bird ! This gives some indication of
the kind of thing one has to put up with in running collections of
birds in the East. The story, however, has a sequel. The cobra
was caught and put into a vivarium with another of its own kind,
which promptly killed the newcomer !
I regret to say that from the point of view of both Picarian and
Passerine birds, we are extremely badly off, even of local types. Of
the former our prize are the lovely Buffon's Touracos ( Turacus persa
buffoni) --rather shy birds, and rather inconspicuous, except in flight ;
their sudden beauty, when taking to the wing, being all the more
pleasing. Our local Brown-headed Barbets ( Thereiceryx zeylanicus )
are at last showing signs of nesting, one of them being now engaged
in hollowing out, by hammer blows with his bill, an upright tree
stem which has been placed in his cage for that purpose.
Our Passerines include two species of Birds of Paradise, the Lesser
(.Paradisea minor ) and Wilson's ( Schlegelia respublica ). The former
is represented by two males, and I have noticed that with each
successive moult, the yellow in the upper tail coverts becomes in-
creasingly brilliant until a deep amber tinge is finally attained. There
has been an attempt by some of the more enlightened members of
the advisory committee to construct a battery of aviaries for the
housing of a representative series of the local species of smaller birds,
as it is felt that visitors to the island, of whom there are very great
number in peace time, expect to see, and usually display more interest
in, the birds of the country than in imported kinds. With the outbreak
of war, however, this matter has had to be shelved, along with many
other improvements.
I think, perhaps, in conclusion, a few words on the chief causes of
mortality in birds in captivity in the East would be useful, even if
only to enlighten others who have collections in this part of the
world and who have not facilities for obtaining post-mortem reports.
During monsoon weather, our chief morbidity arises from pneumonia
and similar complaints. This is especially the case with the smaller
Parrots, in spite of apparent adequate housing and shelter. Enteritis
is also frequent. Ceylonese Hanging-Parrots ( Coryllis veryllinus) are
especially delicate this way, and no success has attended our efforts
with these, although in our private collection as well as in the old
Museum collection, these birds got as far as laying eggs. Parasites,
both external and internal, especially intestinal worms, are a bugbear
in all tropical collections. Temperate climates are well off here,
because the frosts of winter kill off all the ova which gain the soil. Our
principle here is to shift our birds about as much as possible, meantime
digging over and liming the soil in the fallow aviaries. This, unfortu-
nately, is only partly successful, but cuts down infection to a minimum.

C. NORDHOFF-NOTES ON THE BIRDS OF TAHITI I 1 9
Snake-bites account for a few losses as already indicated ; whilst
swarms of bees will occasionally decide to annex one of the nesting
boxes, and before they are noticed, they will slaughter or maim, or
sometimes blind by their stings, a whole heap of inmates of the aviary
or even of several neighbouring aviaries.
On the whole, however, aviculturists have an easier time than their
fellows in Europe, for the climate is admirable for most aviary species ;
except during the rainy period of the monsoons ; for we are not
troubled with the necessity for artificial heat. Although our collection
is, therefore, only a small one, we are in hopes of enlarging by pre-
sentation, purchase, or, better still, breeding from existing stock ; still,
at present, we have a cosy and, we trust, happy family.

In his article in the Waterfowl number of the Avicultural
Magazine, Dillon Ripley mentions a duckling I received some
years ago from Flint Island, which when reared proved to be a
fine male Pintail. I believe that a good many stray Ducks from the
Northern Hemisphere land on the Pacific Islands, and occasionally,
as Ripley suggests in the case of Coues' Gadwall, give rise to a
sedentary and eventually inbred race. I have reliable information
that Shovelers in winter plumage have visited both the Marquesas
and the Tuamotu on several occasions, and that Pintail have been
seen on Atiu in the Cook Group, south-west of Tahiti.
Each year in Tahiti, some time in October or thereabouts, three
kinds of birds arrive from the extreme northern parts of America :
the Bristle-thighed Curlew, the Wandering Tattler, and a Plover
(Pacific Golden?). I often witness the arrival of the Plover in my
twenty-acre marshy cow-pasture ; the plumage is dull and dis-
arrayed, the flight-feathers look worn and frayed. And the birds
arrive thin and half-starved, though greedy feeding soon restores
them. A certain number of Tattlers--barren birds perhaps--seem
to remain in the islands the year round ; there is not a month in
which, at one time or another, I have not seen these birds.
I hear from Tahiti that the California Valley Quail Guild and I
liberated in 1936, have become well established, and that the common
sporting Pheasants (eight cocks and twenty hens) I liberated in the
same year have increased very satisfactorily. The native birds of
Tahiti are in a sad state ; the Porphyrio is extinct, as is the small grey,
Thrush-like Omaomao, famous for its beautiful song, and the magnificent

large Fruit Pigeon, of which a few existed as late as 1920. We still
have our Swift, our Kingfisher, and small green Fruit Pigeon in con-
siderable numbers. The Norway rat, which arrived on ships, and
the feral domestic cat are terrible enemies to birds. And add to these
a large Australian Hawk, foolishly introduced in hopes that it would
feed on rats, but which has turned out a curse to poultry-yards and
to the native jungle-fowl, or wild chicken.
The marshy ponds and numerous clear rivers of Tahiti are frequented
by enormous fresh-water eels, which attain a diameter of six inches
and are most voracious. Our little Anas superciliosa has solved the eel
problem very neatly. They nest on the bracken-covered ridges, a
thousand feet or more above the sea, and rear their young at sea-
level, in water too shallow for the submarine tactics of the eel. The
ducklings are fetched down on the mother's back, between her wings,
and clinging to her feathers with their beaks. This fact is incontro-
vertible ; on several occasions Ducks have been shot on the wing and
the young found still alive and on the mother's back. This has
always struck me as most remarkable, perhaps unique. A number of
French and American residents tried to do something about a closed
season for Ducks, but it is a real problem, as these tropical Ducks seem
to breed, and even to moult, very irregularly. In fact, I believe that
there are few months in the year when one could be certain that none
were breeding.
I have kept these handsome little Ducks both in captivity and
full-winged and at liberty about the garden. They are charming
birds,'active and playful, and fly through trees as neatly as a Carolina
or Mandarin. I believe that they would be easy to domesticate, and
certainly wish that I had a few here in Santa Barbara. Unlike the
Mallard (for which I would not give a dollar a dozen) they don't
become lazy and listless when fed about a garden, and do a lot of
flying, which they seem to enjoy. The flight is very rapid and Teal-
like ; I have often thought that if this Duck proved as easy to breed
as I believe it would, it might make the ideal sporting Duck on an
estate where the birds are bred like Pheasants. And they are unsur-
passed as stayers ; mine made long flights, especially on moon-
light nights, and always repaired to parts unknown for the moult which
rendered them flightless, but otherwise they behaved as if they
considered our garden their home. In fact, they used frequently to
bring in a few wild friends to share their grain--always at night.
It makes me smile to think of a vixenish female Carolina who was
the undisputed tyrant of the four acres about the house. The Rhode
Island Red fowls, even the roosters, were really afraid of her, and
when aroused she would attack them in the most headlong manner.
Her husband's knees knocked together when she gave him a dirty
look ; the superciliosa shunned her like a plague, and even my six

Up to 1914 France was the country for Pheasant keeping ; there,
for nearly three-quarters of a century, Pheasant amateurs were very
numerous. They belonged to all classes of people ; some of the most
successful were owners of large and luxurious estates while others were
humble folk who kept a few pairs in the backyard. But all were
equally skilful, enthusiastic, and successful. There were also a few
in Belgium, in Holland, in England, in Italy, and elsewhere, but never
in the same numbers. In America, ornamental bird breeding was
still in its infancy ; the New York Zoological Park, Colonel A. Kuser,
and a few others had fine collections, but mostly made up of birds
imported from Europe, and Pheasant keeping was very far from what
it has been for the last twenty years.
I started keeping Pheasants on a certain scale in 1908, and in 1914
all species then existing in capitivity were represented in my large
Pheasantry at Villers-Bretonneux. In addition to the commoner
species, we had in those days Impeyan, Monals, Satyr, Temminck's
and Cabot's Tragopans, Germain's and Grey Peacock Pheasants,
Horsfield, White-Crested and Bel's Kalijs, Malayan Argus, Malay,
Bornean and Siamese Firebacks, Mikado, Soemerring's, Cheer and
Brown Eared Pheasants, Sonnerats and Java Jungle-fowl. Several
rare species had been previously kept and reared in France, but since
lost. Such was the case of Harting's and Blyth's Tragopans, Yellow-
necked and Himalayan Koklass. During the war, most of these
rarer species disappeared altogether and it was some years later
that they were again imported and re-established. We managed,
however, to save a small number of the three Tragopans, plenty of
Impeyans, some Grey Peacock Pheasants, and a few others. Among
the commoner species, the Prince of Wales' Pheasant was a casualty
of the war, never seen since. To this day, also, no more Harting's
or Western Tragopans have been imported.
It took four or five years after the conclusion of the war before
Pheasant imports, at least imports of rare or aviculturally new species,
really started. The first to come were consignments of Impeyans,
Satyrs, Grey Polyplectrons, various Kalijs, etc., which began to
arrive from Calcutta regularly in 1923, and also Firebacks and Argus
from Singapore. The first new and valuable introductions were those
I made myself in 1924. I then brought over from Indochina my
newly discovered pair of Imperial Pheasants, several pairs and odd

cocks Edward's, Bel's and Rheinart's Ocellated Argus, which had so
far been great rarities even in skin collections. Edward's, Imperials,
and Bel's were reared the next year and have since been established
in captivity.
After a visit to Japan in 1926, I brought home a Mikado cock,
wild caught, Versicolor and Corean Ringnecks, Scintillated and
Ijinia's Copper Pheasants. The first Ocellated Argus did not thrive,
but in 1928 and 1929 I brought home several healthy pairs, and young
even bred in 1931 and in consecutive years. I discovered Lewis's
Kalij in Cambodia in 1927 and brought some home in 1928, where
they bred the following year. But this bird always remained very
scarce. I still had a pair and three chicks at Cleres in June, 1940.
Mr. W. Frost brought for me several pairs of Bronze-tailed
Peacock Pheasants in 1931. The same year Mr. W. Goodfellow
brought for Mr. Spedan Lewis and for myself two pairs of Bulwer's
Wattled Pheasants, one of the marvels of the bird world, while
Mr. Floyd Smith, shipped me from Tetchuan a number of Blue Eared
Pheasants, some Temminck's Tragopans and Darwin's Koklass.
Three breeding pairs of Mikados arrived also from Japan, and a few
Lewis's from Indo-China ; 1931 was a good year for new Pheasants
at Cleres.
Meanwhile, the lovely Palawan Peacock Pheasant had arrived
and been reared in California, whence I received two pairs. Cheer
Pheasants reappeared in 1932 and also Blyth's Tragopans, and we
reared many of both species in the following years. Ceylon, or
Lafayett's Junglefowl also came for the first time and were easily
established. The following years, Mr. Leland Smith received White
Eared Pheasants, one of which he was kind enough to send me,
Chinese Monals and Dusky Grouse Pheasants ( Tetraophasis ). I also
received the last two species and some Blood Pheasants ( Ithaginis ),
but they never could be established. I also obtained some Stone's
Pheasants ( Ph . elegans ).
Each year rare birds came and provided new blood. The last
exciting consignments were those of Mr. Frost who brought me a
cock and three hens of the very rare Salvadori's Crestless Pheasant
from Sumatra, and another one of Palawans, Bulwers, and Bornean
Argus gathered by Mr. Shaw Meyer in the spring of 1939.
Although I expect that my own and other collections in Continental
Europe have now ceased to exist to a large extent, there still are some
adequate breeding stock of rare Pheasants in England and in the
United States. It is to be hoped that every step will be taken to
preserve it, as new imports may not be possible before a number of
years, when not only the world is at peace, but also when transactions
and transport are sufficiently reorganized.

NESTING HABITS OF SATIN BOWERBIRD

Creek
(Reprinted from The Australasian )
Outstanding among Australian birds are the Bowerbuilders, which,
quite apart from the architectural abilities, are accomplished vocal
mimics and birds of very lovely plumage. A celebrated member of
the family is the Satin Bowerbird, found in heavily forested country
down the entire eastern coast of the continent and through the
southern ranges of Victoria.
For years the male bird wears the pretty green plumage so character-
istic of the female, but adopts at a certain age--no one knowing
exactly when--the uniform purple-blue colour so lustrous and
beautiful in sunlight.
Associated with his change in colour, the cock Satin Bowerbird
becomes exceptionally shy and retiring, and little indeed is seen of
him. While the many fascinating aspects of the Bower construction,
the bird's play acting and painting and decorating, have received
a good deal of attention and study, the actual nesting habits of the
Satin Bowerbird are not well known. Thus observations on the
hatching and rearing of a young bird this season in the large Lyrebird
enclosure at Badger Creek proved of more than usual interest.
Only one previous record of the successful breeding of these birds
in captivity is known, and that took place in 1937, in the collection
of Mr. Arnold Hirst, a Sydney aviculturist.
The value of observations made under these conditions lies in the
possibility of making notes, over the whole mating period, of secretive
operations almost impossible to follow in the bush. Among the ferns
in the aviary, which is really an enclosure of scrub 100 feet by 50 feet
by 13 feet in height, the blue cock Bowerbird had a well-built bower
of tall sticks throughout most of the year.
Sometimes it was dismantled, only to reappear on a new site with
the usual oddities--Parrot feathers, pieces of blue chocolate paper,
and blue glass lying about at the front door.
The green hen bird also took a keen interest in this play arbour,
and during September the throaty whirring continuous call of the
cock bird hopping about in his bower was heard a good deal. I think
a large part of the performance was meant to bring the hen bird down
to admire the proceedings.
However, about mid-October, when the hen bird began to build
her nest, the cock Bowerbird took no part in proceedings, and not
once thereafter did he evince the slightest sign of shouldering the
least bit of parental responsibility. He took no part in the duties of

D. FLEAY-NESTING HABIT OF SATIN BOWERBIRD
incubation, and was never seen to feed the young birds or to resent
intrusions of any kind.
The cock Satin Bird, with his bower, reminded me of the cock
Lyrebird and his dancing mound. Both appear to live in a world of
make-believe song and dance, leaving the drudgery of home duties
to their more soberly plumaged and more practical spouses. In fact,
it is highly probable that our decorative cock Bowerbird is not a
devoted partner to his mate, but in the wild state a Mormon with
several wives.
By 27th October the hen Bowerbird in the aviary had completed
her open nest, composed of thin twigs and sticks, about 6 feet above
the ground in a mass of upstanding dead teatree. The structure was
scantily though strongly made and lined with loose dead eucalypt
leaves.
By 29th October it contained two of the large and very pretty eggs
forming the clutch--dark cream colour, spotted and blotched with
olive brown, cinnamon brown, and slaty grey.
I was rather chary of vising this little home too often, for in the
previous year (1940) the bird had nested in the aviary and promptly
lost her one and only offspring soon after it had hatched. Each time
she was visited the hen slipped quietly off the nest and circled anxiously
in the vicinity, " bounding " along the boughs and " peering
anxiously with head and neck outstretched.
Twenty-three days of incubation saw two small fledgelings out of the
eggs. Thickly clothed in long greyish down, the baby Bowerbirds
appeared healthy and strong. The mother bird uttered prolonged
churring notes of anxiety, leaping about in great agitation, when I paid
a visit. In spite of the strong partiality for fruit for which Satin
Bowerbirds are noted, it was particularly instructive to note that from
the beginning the mother bird hunted grubs and insects and fed her
family almost purely on an insectivorous diet. Even so, one youngster
evidently died in the nest, and I found it thrown out on the ground.
Gradually the lone survivor grew larger and stronger.
On 10th December, aged approximately 23 days, but still remark-
ably fluffy, with green plumage showing on body and wings, and
unable to fly, it left the nest and used its strongly developed legs to
hop to a lofty position among the dry twigs of teatree.
This great day in the aviary meant nothing to the bower-playing
cock bird, but certainly added " grey hairs " to the hen bird.
When picked up the youngster squalled in the typical churring
style of protest peculiar to the species. Immediately this occurred
the mother bird flew at me and struck me. She then dropped to the
ground and shuffled along in piteous " broken-wing 5 5 fashion in an
attempt to distract attention from her offspring.
Next and most remarkable performance of all, she ran through a

repertoire of her powers of mimicry, among which, remarkable to
relate, was an oft-repeated version of the shrill alarm note of the
Lyrebird ! Several other bush voices also came to light, one of which
was a most clear rendering of a hearty kookaburra chorus and the
mournful wails of yellow-tailed black Cockatoos.
The worried mother Bowerbird was certainly most relieved when
I left. The youngster is doing well, and at the moment of writing,
some five days after its departure from the nest, it has learned to fly,
and now perches in the loftiest branches in the aviary.

I have a green Glossy Starling, the species of which I am not at
all sure of. In the book Birds of Kenya Colony and the Uganda Protectorate
it does not give his exact description--the nearest I can get to it is the
description of the East African Blue-eared Glossy Starling--with
the exception of practically all the breast of my bird being violet
blue, instead of in the description of the Blue-eared bird, which only
has the abdomen violet blue. My bird is also considerably larger.
Several people who have seen him, and who should know, have all
been at sea as to his correct species. He had a sister, but she speared
herself on a nail, and is no more. He was hand-reared in Kenya,
and came from " up " country (The Sotik) about eight or nine years
ago. Like most tame cock birds he is extremely vicious with other
birds, especially those of his own or nearly related species--as to
getting him a hen, he just kills them as fast as they are procured.
Now he is a bachelor for good. He is an extremely good mimic,
I give a list of a few of the sounds he makes, though they are not all
by any means : Hen laying an egg ; Chaffinch alarm note and part
of song ; Goldfinch ; Sparrow ; Jackdaw ; Partridge ; myself
blowing my nose ; a double whistle I use for calling my birds, when out
in the garden ; the peculiar call of hog-deer (I have a couple of pet
hog-deer in the paddock near the house) ; Redstart and all the usual
Starling noises, with a few good Shama notes thrown in--learned
from a Shama that once had an aviary near him.
It will be seen by the list I give that he is no mean mimic. He
is extremely tame with anyone he knows, though very shy of strangers.
With those he knows, if he wants to draw attention to himself he will
fly at their head and strike it, both by his feet and bill. This is
surely a very uncommon trick for a Starling. Had he been a Skua,
I could have understood it, but it seems rather unusual for one of
the Starling tribe ? He is a glorious sight on the wing, with the sun
on him, very quick, but with a curiously beating (I can only describe

it as this) motion of the wings, not unlike a Lapwing sometimes.
He will tolerate no bird as large as himself in the garden, and makes
the lives of the bigger wild birds, including Jackdaws, an absolute
hell ! He spends much of his time inspecting the roof of my cottage,
and various old hollow apple trees, carrying nesting material, running
along the tops of the aviaries, annoying any bird he can. He will,
nine cases out of ten, catch a mealworm or caterpillar thrown up in
the air, like a Gull after bread--it is very attractive to see him. He
is very obedient, and will go into his aviary if told to do so, at once,
far quicker than many dogs kennel up. When let out into the garden
for the first time (after being in the house all the winter) he goes
off like a shot out of a gun. If one did not know him, one would think
he had gone for good--he never reappears until dusk the first day.
After the first day he never does this again, and remains flying about
the garden and orchard. At first it was rather nerve-shattering to
see him disappear, a small speck in the distance. I thought he had
" gone ". Year after year he does it, and now of course I take no
notice. He is a curious bird in one respect, directly the electric light
is switched on he wakes up and whistles and chatters to himself all
evening, when most of the other birds (barring my Japanese Starling)
prefer to have their covers on their cages and go to sleep.
He is terribly jealous ; he has for the past week done his best to
get at, and kill, a new bird I have just got, a cream-coloured Sparrow,
hand-reared, a delightful little bird and very tame. His food consists
of a very little insectivorous mixture ; the bulk of his food is boiled rice,
apple, lettuce, and any fruit, mixed with boiled potato. He has stood
up to this disgusting mess manfully for eight or nine years, and looks
like doing it for as many more. I sincerely hope he does. He is a very
affectionate bird, like all the tame Starlings I have ever had, most
entertaining and with all one of the most lovely garden ornaments
one could wish for. To me, there are few more fascinating things than
really tame birds flying where they like about the garden and grounds,
and surely no better garden ornament ? I don't like birds kept in
aviaries, but I loathe them kept in cages. Nearly all my birds I have
had are, at some time or other, allowed to fly loose during the day,
but so many fight that it means if one has several they can only come
out singly for half an hour or so at a time. They are so jealous of each
other that they cannot be allowed out more than one at a time--
a bore.
One would think that the garden was big enough to hold more
than one bird at a time--but apparently it is not. I think, perhaps,
one of the most beautiful liberty birds I had was a Formosan Magpie.
To see this great ricketts-blue " Crow ", with a long Pheasant's tail,
flying up to the top of my cottage chimney and then sailing out across
the garden, was a sight not easily forgotten. Glossy Starlings, like

seldom in his cage, and only uses it as a sort of restaurant and bedroom.
As I write this he is chasing a Jackdaw across the garden assisting it
home as rapidly as it can go. " Home John and don't spare the
horses ! "
I may add that all my tame birds really do know their names and
answer to them when spoken to. I put the intelligence of the
average bird very high, especially the insectivorous birds.

THE FAIRY BLUE-BIRDS

There are seven species of the Fairy Blue-birds ; yet only one is
at all well known to aviculture.
Three species, Irena cyanogastra , of Luzon ; I. melanochlamys , of
Samar and Leyte, and I. tweeddalii, of Palawan, Balabac, and
Calamianes are representative of the Philippine Islands. I. cyanea
is found in the Malay Penninsula ; I. crinigera , in Borneo and Sumatra,
and the best known, I. turcosa, in Java.
I. puella, said to be fairly common and to which the common
name was originally given, has a large and scattered range including
S.W. India, Ceylon, the Andaman and Nicobar Islands, and from
the Sikhim and Assam regions of the Himalayas, through the Arakan
and Pegu districts of Western Burma to the Tenasserim area of
Thailand.
The April, 1913, number of Bird Notes contains an account of
the genus by Mr. Page and an excellent coloured plate of I. turcosa
by Mr. Goodchild.
Advertisers used to offer Fairy Blue-birds as if there was but one
species : I think that the one always offered was the Javan, I. turcosa.
The great beauty of the males of this species with their enamelled
turquoise upper plumage and velvet black under parts is well known.
The proportionately small feet and the long tail-coverts, which almost
completely hide the tail, are curious features of this bird.
I believe it is correct to say that no species of Fairy Blue-bird has
yet been bred in captivity, but I. turcosa has nested in this country
and has hatched young at the Duke of Bedford's aviaries and also,
if I remember rightly, in Lady Wavertree's collection, but in each
instance the young were lost at an early age.
The pair in the Duke of Bedford's collection thrived on a diet of
chopped sweet apple, pear, and grapes dried off with a little crumbled

sponge-cake and proprietary insectile food : various ripe berries,
a few mealworms and fresh wasp larvae were also given. They lived
throughout the year in a movable Parrakeet aviary which had its
shelter warmed in winter. They were allowed out of doors on all
but the worst days and, though they were not very active, they spent
a good deal of time outside. They seemed not to be delicate and
were, on the whole, rather easy to keep. They nested several times,
and a number of eggs, which, if I remember correctly, rather
resembled those of a Blackbird, but for being much smaller, were
laid. Their first nest failed because it was so poorly constructed, that
the eggs soon fell through it, so thereafter we fixed up old Blackbirds'
nests and other ready-made arrangements of which the hen readily
approved. I do not think that she ever laid clutches of more than
two eggs, and this may be the normal clutch, for it is said by Oates
[Fauna of British India) of I. puella that " the eggs are generally two in
number
The hen sat well and seemed up to a point a good and devoted
mother, and exactly why the young were lost was hard to judge,
for, of course we did not look into the nest until it was evident that
no life remained in it.
The parent birds were sent away before a third season came
round : I was sorry to see the going of such beautiful birds, and,
even if there was little chance of their ever rearing their young, it
might not have been too difficult to hand-rear some of them. In
general habit we found these birds rather sluggish, but none the less
quick in their movements, and I have seen them catch passing wasps
and swallow them with very little preliminary crushing.
Oates has observed that the young of I. puella are like the female,
and that the males change into adult plumage without a moult.
The young males of I. turcosa are exactly like the females, and in
the one or two cases I have known my impression is that they moulted
into adult plumage, and did not assume it by any attrition of the tips
of the feathers.
Almost all the habitats of the Fairy Blue-birds are, or have been
and will, no doubt, be again, the scenes of considerable fighting.
The harm done to wild life by the processes of modern warfare can
never be known, and the subject is too sad to dwell upon.

The reference, in the last number of the Magazine, by
Dr. Hopkinson, to the two Amethyst Starlings which he sent to
the Zoo fifteen and twenty-one years ago, both of which are still
hale and hearty, has suggested to me that a few notes on the other
birds there, mostly very old stagers, may not be without interest
though for length of life none can beat the Amethyst hen of 1922,
which was, I believe, the first of her species to arrive in this country.
In 1941 part of the roof of the Bird House was demolished and the
heating apparatus was put out of action for a fortnight during cold
weather, to which misfortunes must be added the complete absence of
fruit since the early days of the war. Taking this into consideration,
I think the greatest credit is due to Senior Keepers Tanner and
Raggett for the really fine collection that has been maintained. It
is true the Birds of Paradise have succumbed, no doubt owing to the
lack of fruit, for they were all old birds and could not take kindly to
the change in diet, but others that one regarded as fruit-eaters, such
as Toucans and Touracos, have not only survived but are in first rate
condition. Of the former there are four whose years in the Bird
House range from 14 to 7. There are seven Touracos, the oldest,
a Donaldson's, having been there 18 years. A Bell-bird which died
a few weeks ago had been in the house for 15 years.
There are seven Yellow-winged and two Purple Sugar-birds,
all old timers with 8 to 12 years to their credit, a Friar-bird 12 years
and two Sun-birds of 8 and 9 years.
Of Hornbills there are five specimens including " Baby ", the
Great Indian Hornbill which, though really a baby on arrival, has
now honoured the Bird House with its presence for over 20 years.
It was fond of feeding its keeper with grapes when there were any
to feed him with ; boiled carrot does not quite take their place !
There are two Grey-winged Trumpeters which follow one around
like dogs and look none the worse for their 12 years' residence in
Regent's Park, neither does a Superb Glossy Starling after 14 years,
a Nonpareil Bunting after 11, or a Rose-coloured Starling after 17.
The Bird House is really fairly well stocked, far better than one
might expect to find it after four years of war, during which no birds
have been imported to replace losses. One misses the vegetation in
the large central aviary which showed off to such perfection the gay
crowd that used to occupy it. Presumably lack of labour is responsible
for the dreary appearance. The roof of this aviary was smashed by
an incendiary bomb during the blitz of 1941, but it spluttered out

The Parrots form a very well-defined group of birds, set apart from
all others to a much greater degree, even to the uninitiated, than are
most bird orders from each other. They are placed between the
Owls on the one hand and the Cuckoos on the other, though dis-
playing certain affinities with other groups also. The nearest approach
is perhaps to the Owls, and is attained by the peculiar Owl-Parrot
(i Strigops ) of New Zealand, which in addition to looking like an Owl,
is nocturnal in habit.
The Parrot tribe ( Psittaci ) includes all the Parrot-like birds, i.e.
not only the typical Parrots like the familiar African Grey or the
Green Amazons, but also the forms known in common speech by such
varied names as Parrakeets (including Budgerigars and Lovebirds)
Cockatoos, Lories, and Lorikeets (or Loriquets). Some of these names
are of no scientific significance whatever so that some explanation is
necessary.

1. A Parrakeet is merely a small Parrot, the name generally being
applied to the small long-tailed species, those with short or square
tails being referred to as Parrots even though they are of minute size,
e.g. Lovebirds and the Hanging Parrots, of which more anon.
2. Cockatoos are large forms easily recognized by their erectile

crests, though also possessing important anatomical differences from
other members of the group. The anatomical features, however,
occur in a small group of minute species which are without a crest.
These are the so-called Pigmy Parrots ( Nasiterna ) of New Guinea,
and would be better referred to as dwarf Cockatoos. On the contrary,
some species having a crest are not Cockatoos in the anatomical
sense, e.g. the familiar aviary bird called the Cockatiel {Leptolophus
hollandicus) , which is only a modified Parrakeet, and the rarer Uvaean
Parrakeet ( Nymphicus cornutus) of New Caledonia.
3. Lories and Lorikeets , the latter being merely small (often long-
tailed) editions of the former, constitute a much more compact and
well-defined group which differs from all the ordinary Parrots

(including all those mentioned so far) by virtue of their feeding habits
and the associated structural modifications. The Lories are all honey-
feeders and their digestive apparatus is modified to assist in procuring
and absorbing a liquid or semi-liquid diet. The ordinary seed-
eating Parrots and Parrakeets have a dry mouth and a tongue
shaped rather like the end of a human finger, with the nail
placed obliquely at the tip. Their stomachs are of the
ordinary avian type, i.e. forming a strong crushing gizzard. On
the contrary the Lory family are provided with wet mouths and the
nail-like portion of the tongue is converted into a brush, so that
they are often spoken of as brush-tongued Parrots. Their stomachs
are of simple sac-like form, resembling thus a mammalian rather than
an avian stomach. There are also some differences in the shape of
the bill. Lories have relatively weak beaks, narrow from above down
and from side to side but elongated in the other dimension. The
upper mandible is not so strongly hooked as in seed-eating Parrots
and lacks the file-like markings on its biting surface.
The reason that I have gone so fully into the differences between
the seed-eating and the honey-eating groups of Parrots is on account
of the fact that Ceylon is the home of a species which is intermediate
between the two. This bird, related species of which are found all
over South-Eastern Asia, is called in Sinhalese malichchiya and in
Tamil kanni-kili. It is popularly referred to as the Ceylon Loriquet,
which is in some ways unfortunate, because structurally it is no
Lory, though in habits the bird certainly agrees with them, being
a honey feeder and possessing, as a result, a simple saccular stomach
instead of a gizzard. In other structural features, however, it is a
typical Parrot and for this reason, and to avoid confusion with the
true Lorikeets, I consider the alternative name of Hanging Parrot
much more suitable. The term is based on the peculiar habit these
birds possess of roosting upside down like a bat, hanging by means of
their feet to small twigs, a habit which has led the Germans to call
them Fleeter mans-papageien, i.e. " Bat-Parrots."
The Ceylonese species of Hanging Parrot ( Coryllis beryllinus) is
peculiar to the Island, though it differs only slightly from the Vernal
Hanging Parrot (C. vernalis) of the Malabar tract and also of the
north-east of India. It is the smallest of the Parrot tribe in Ceylon,
measuring 5J inches in total length. In general colour it is bright
leaf-green, brighter below than above. Like all Hanging Parrots,
it has the rump feathers elongated and crimson in colour. There
is a reddish-orange cap on top of the head, and in the adult male the
throat has a delicate sky-blue tinge. Young birds are duller in colour
and lack the crown patch. The Hanging Parrot is a very common
bird, though unobtrusive, since it keeps to the tree tops. It is
recognized by its high-pitched chatter rather than by sight. It will

be found feeding on the honey from the flowers of the coconut and
other palms, though it has no brush to its tongue. It breeds in the
hollow stems of trees, especially dead arecanut palms, which it prefers
to enter from a hole at the exposed dead stump. It lines its nest
with chippings from the dead tree and then with a high pile of nibbled-
off edges of leaves, which it carries to its nest, loaded up beneath the
erectile crimson rump feathers, in the same manner as the African
Lovebirds of the genus Agapornis. The females are very curious sights
when so loaded, but the male may also assist with the actual leaf-
cutting.
Hanging Parrots do well in captivity, but must be kept in pairs
only or fighting to the death will ensue. They must on no account
be fed on seed, but on a sop made of stale bread soaked in sweetened
condensed milk, to which vitamins must artificially be added, unless
the diet is supplemented in other ways. Soft ripe fruit should also be
given. I have had them attempt to reproduce their kind in captivity,
building a nest in an upturned drain pipe or metal rain-water pipe.
They have gone as far as laying eggs, but there has been no success in
hatching out live babies.
There are four other species of Parrots in Ceylon, all falling into
the category of " Parrakeet ", as they are small to medium in size
and provided with long tail feathers. They all belong to the genus
Psittacula, and are not far removed from the African Grey in general
structure.
These are in order of size, commencing with the largest, as
follows :--

Of these, Layard's Parrakeet is a species peculiar to the Island,
where, like many others of like nature, it is confined to the central
hill region.
The Alexandrine is a widely distributed species, but the typical
sub-species is confined to Ceylon and Malabar. The Ring-neck and
Blossom-head are also widely distributed and the sub-species found in
Ceylon are also found over the greater part of India, other races
occurring in Malaya, etc.

in captivity on various seed mixtures supplemented by fruit, nuts, and
chillies. They can all be trained to talk. An Alexandrine in my
possession has as large a repertoire as any talking Parrot I have ever
come across. All the species have been bred in captivity, but the
essentials for this are, (i) plenty of flight space, (ii) keeping no more
than a single pair in one aviary. As regards the amount of space
required, that depends on the size of the birds. Layard's need a
flight of at least 12 feet long; the width of the cage matters little, but
the higher the better. Alexandrines need at least 24 feet of flight and
more if possible.
All four Parrakeets are easily distinguishable from one another
in the adult state, but more difficult whilst still in juvenile plumage.
The Alexandrine and Ring-neck are green with a half-collar round
the front and sides of the neck, supplemented by a pink half-collar
at the back, the two half-collars overlapping at the sides. But the
Alexandrine is a larger bird with a more prominent pink collar, a
relatively much larger bill, and an additional purplish-crimson patch
on the front part of the wing. The females have little or no collar in
either species, but the size differences and the wing patch apply as
in the males. Young birds resemble adult females. Layard's Parrakeet
is easily recognized by its slaty coloured head, followed by a bright
green collar. The lower back is more of a lavender tinge. The
sexual and age differences are indicated by colour changes in the bill.
Young birds have a pinkish-orange bill which later turns to black.
It remains black in the adult female, but in the male it changes to a
bright rose-crimson.
The Blossom-head also starts life with an ashy head, but this
changes to a brilliant plum-colour in the adult male, who also
develops a crimson wing patch like the Alexandrine. Females are
easily distinguished from Layard's by the absence of grey on the back,
by their smaller heads and relatively less developed bills, which are
yellowish-orange in colour.

(Continued from p. go)
Some of the most difficult of the Softbills family to keep in captivity
in perfect natural condition are those usually associated in their
natural state with streams, ponds, swamps, and the like. Included
in this group I mention Sedge, Reed, Marsh, Aquatic Warblers,
Dipper, and the Kingfisher.
The smaller species named in this list build their nests from 18 inches
to 3 feet above the ground, usually in reeds, meadowsweet, and other
rank growth that one usually associates with damp places.
The Reed Warbler differs from his cousins in the architectural
structure of the nest, being completely suspended between three, four,
and sometimes five straight, moderately thick stems of rushes, and
on a rough day when these tall upstanding reeds are wafting from
side to side the nest also takes such a directed course in a sometimes
frightening manner. Frightening from the point of view of fear of
the worst befalling the clutch of eggs or the brood of youngsters.
The Marsh Warbler, a rare species and only found in certain
localities, is of the same drab colouring as the Sedge and Reed Warbler.
It is well known as a mimic of other birds' songs and notes, and is
usually found in close proximity to the Sedge and Reed Warbler in
such localities--but it does not follow that where the Sedge and
Reed Warbler frequent so also does the Marsh !
All these Warblers make charming aviary inmates, provided their
surroundings contain as far as possible a similarity to their natural
haunts, and if a large proportion of live food in the form of mealworms,
gentles, and fresh live ants' eggs are provided for their main diets, in
warm conditions as regards housing accommodation in the winter
they do very well.
Like most Softbills, one disadvantage due doubtless to the artificial
surroundings of their man-made habitations, their perches, their lack
of varying food, and their cool dry aviaries, their feathers get very
brittle, and if they do break off it is not until the spring of the year
that they are able to replace these stumps of feathers by the perfect
fully matured ones.
The Aquatic Warbler is very rare in this country, and only an
occasional visitor to these Islands, and it is doubtful if this bird has
ever been kept for any length of time in this country. It is closely
related to the Sedge Warbler in every respect.
Generally speaking the larger the species of bird the easier it is to

keep--but I wonder if this could apply to the Dipper as com-
pared to the, shall&amp;apos;we say, Sedge Warbler ? From what little experience
I have been able to gain in the years prior to this war when foodstuffs
were more easily procured and travel was not restricted in order to
procure them, the Dipper could be one of the finest aviary inmates,
both in setting and personality, if a lot of trouble was taken
with this species in studying its wants and being in a position to
supply them immediately. It is one of the most beautiful birds,
recognized by its white throat and chest, contrasting with dark
brown upper surface and head ; breast chestnut ; belly black, and
tail short. It has a cheerful little song, very shrill, and can be heard
all the year round, and clearly resembling the rippling music of the
brook. It is only found near rivers, and in the breeding season is
found in shallow, swift-running streams, favouring mills, waterfalls,
both natural and man-made. It feeds on the larvae of water beetles,
dragon flies, mayflies, and will also live on small water snails, water
fleas, and other aquatic life.
In captivity the Dipper will eat mealworms, gentles, and ants'
eggs, and certain ingredients of foods found in insectile proprietary
brands of these ingredients closely resembling anything they expect to
find in their natural haunts. This bird is certainly worthy of a lot
more study in confinement, as it is hardy from the point of view of
climatic conditions. Its nest, constructed like a huge Jenny Wren's,
is usually built on a ledge very close to water. I have found their
nests in banks of any particular river they inhabit, under waterfalls,
having to fly through the spray in order to gain access, under bridges,
on water wheels unused for some years, and in any part of the wheel-
house where a site, such as two bricks removed, gives a sufficiently
wide ledge to contain the rather unwieldy structure of the nest. The
eggs are white and the youngsters are mottled in plumage until
their first moult, when their adult plumage is attained.
It is said, although I have never actually observed such a practice,
that the Dipper will walk along the bottom of the shallow water,
completely submerged, using his long claws and toes to hold on to the
stones in order to guard against being swept away by the current,
in order to find his food in the food of larvae and maybe fishes' spawn.
Not many people have been able to rear our native Kingfisher,
due, no doubt, to his insatiable appetite for fish. It really is a most
handsome bird when fully matured, but its nest is one of the most
insanitary places that God's creatures have ever used. They always
use a hole (burrowed out by the bird) which goes horizontally into
the perpendicular bank of a stream.
The nest consists wholly of fish bones and when the young are born
their excreta is never removed to any large extent by the parent
birds, and the result is a shocking foul-smelling stench of rotting fish.

The Life of the Robin. By David Lack. Messrs. H. F. and G.
Witherby, Ltd., 326 High Holborn, London, W.C. 1. Price
ys. 6 d.
Mr. David Lack has produced a remarkable book, the result of
four years' close observation. Its two hundred pages are packed with
interesting information and a considerable number of new, and in
some cases, almost startling, facts are made known. The author tells
not only of what the Robin does throughout the year, but how and
why he does it. Every aspect is viewed--curiosity, significance of
song, display, fighting, boundary disputes, sexual selection, courtship,
nest, eggs, young, significance of territory, migration, food, enemies,
expectation of life, tameness, adventures with stuffed Robins, etc.
An item of especial interest to aviculturists is the author's success
in breeding Robins in aviaries. On pages 19-21 he writes :--
" Nevertheless, after three years of study, I realized that certain
aspects of behaviour would become much clearer if Robins could be
induced to nest in captivity. For this purpose two aviaries were
constructed, each 30 feet long, one 12, the other 20 feet wide, and each
over 6 feet high. They had good grass turf, extensively planted with
evergreen bushes, while branches were nailed to the walls higher up.
Shelters were provided by wooden sheds and packing cases, half filled
with brushwood. The birds were fed on Allen Silver's special insect
mixture, together with large numbers of live mealworms, of which
they are particularly fond. The food trays had wooden shelters over
them to keep off the rain. Drinking baths were readily provided by
upturned dustbin lids. The chief danger in an aviary is from rats,
and to guard against them the wire was sunk on every side to about
a foot below the surface and, when the earth was filled in, large
quantities of broken glass were added. The rats did not get in, though
extremely numerous round about.
" Two pairs of Robins were placed in each aviary, in which lay the
risk, for every experienced aviculturist who was consulted assured me
that if two pairs of Robins were placed in the same aviary one pair
were certain to kill the other. Indeed, a captive male would sometimes
kill his own hen. On the other hand, observations discussed later led

me to expect that, provided the birds were given sufficient room in
which to escape, one would not kill another, and that gradually their
animosity would decline. The latter was what, in fact, happened and,
while I was ready to remove one of the pairs at once if they showed
any sign of being hurt, this was never necessary. Presumably other
aviculturists have used much smaller aviaries.
" The birds remained in good condition and in each aviary one of
the pairs successfully reared five young, for which a prodigious number
of mealworms were required, as the parents would feed their young
only on living food. As soon as the young were able to fend for them-
selves, they and their parents were let out. A year and a half later at
least two of the adults were still alive in the wild state. Apparently
these were the first Robins ever to breed in captivity in Britain."
Mr. Lack began his study in January, 1935, so that his aviary
breeding experiments were presumably carried out in 1938.

News of Mr. Shaw Mayer and Mr. Frost
I think there must be many members of the Avicultural Society who will be glad
to hear that on 10th September I received a long letter from Mr. Shaw Mayer and
that he is, so far, safe and well. He is in the Army somewhere in Australia and, he
writes, a long way from his home of Sydney. He asks to be remembered to all friends,
and says he often thinks of the times here, which he says seem sacred now. He had
recently heard from Mrs. Frost, who is in Western Australia with her son Michael. Mr.
Frost is interned as a civilian at Changi Gamp, near Singapore Island. I had written
to Mr. Shaw Mayer last Christmas, and as I never had a reply I wrote to his Mother
last February, and this is the result, as she forwarded my letter to him.
He says he had just received the Jan.-Feb. Magazine and read with great pleasure
Monsieur Delacour's article on Edward's Pheasants and Miss Chawner's account
of the doings at Leckford during 1942.
He asks specially to be kindly remembered to Mr. Ezra, Mr. Seth-Smith, and
Mr. Whitley and all good friends.

Though naturally hampered in its activities, the fact that the International Com-
mittee for Bird Preservation continues to carry on and is preparing for its post-war work
was evidenced by the internationally representative and well attended meeting of
the British and Polish Sections held in the Hall of the Royal Geographical Society
on 25th September under the chairmanship of Mr. David Seth-Smith. Dr. Jul
Borucki spoke on the various aspects of bird preservation in Poland before the war
and the difficulties and problems of the future. He drew attention to the fact that
Poland and Czechoslovakia in establishing the international reserve in the High
Tatras had set an unique example of international collaboration.
Monsieur Jean Delacour, President of the Committee, sent a message from New
York to the meeting pointing out the widespread adverse effect war would have on
bird life throughout the world and stressing the necessity for the active work of the
Committee so soon as peace is restored. He concluded by stating " The love of nature

who is well known for the high quality of his colour photography, showed a film which
undoubtedly surpassed anything of the kind ever seen. In a series of scenes of un-
rivalled beauty and perfect photography he showed varying types of the British
countryside with the birds that are to be found there. The soft loveliness of a blue-
bell wood, the grandeur of the snow mountains in Scotland, the particular charm of
the fens, the rugged beauty of the Bass Rock, and the peace of parkland and country
lanes epitomized what every country-loving Briton carries in his heart to whatever
part of the world he may go. Over 32 species of birds were shown from the House
Sparrow (a bird neglected by bird photographers) to the Kingfisher, most brilliantly
plumaged of all British birds. In moving a vote of thanks to Mr. Higham, the Belgian
Ambassador stated that he had seen many nature films but none so good as this.
His Excellency pointed out the great value of international nature preservation,
making special mention of the International Conference for the preservation of the
Fauna of Africa, and also the proposed Conference on the Preservation of the Fauna
of the Pacific which had to be abandoned on the outbreak of war, " but," he con-

I have just lost a very old friend in the shape of a Purple-Winged Sugar-Bird.
He was adult when I purchased him some 1 o or 11 years ago, and appeared in perfect
health when covered up for the night. Alas ! only to be found dead on the floor of
his cage next morning ! He was a most intelligent little fellow and would squeal
in his funny little way whenever he espied a small fly in the window, until it was
caught and given to him, and until this happened there was no peace. He also
adored sponge cake, but only if quite new ! He had no fear of my dogs and was
absurdly tame. I lost a similar specimen in 1925 that I had kept for 14 years, he also
was adult when given to me, by my brother-in-law, the late H. D. Astley, so we never
knew his real age. It strikes me as being very interesting to think that one can keep
these lovely little birds for so many years in happy captivity ; for that both my
specimens were happy and contented I have no doubt whatsoever, and I often wonder
if in their wild state they would have survived so long ?

Acclimatizing American Robins
I do not remember seeing mention in the Avicultural Magazine of Lord
Northcliffe's experiments in acclimatizing the American Robin. The following
extract from The Countryman , Autumn, 1943, seems of sufficient interest to justify
reproduction :--
" About a generation ago, at his home at Sutton Place, in Surrey, Lord Northcliffe
</table>
<bodyText confidence="0.993518833333333" page_id="56350838"  page_num="138" year="" vol="">
made a prolonged experiment in the introduction of a new bird to England. A good
deal was written about it at the time, but the end, I think, was never reported.
Lord Northcliffe was a great lover of birds, and when he visited America became
especially interested in the American Robin, which is in reality a Thrush--the
Pilgrim Fathers dubbed it Robin because of its ruddy breast. Several pairs were
imported, and they bred freely in a large aviary set up by the spacious lawn in front
of Sutton Place. After the first year, eggs from the captive pairs were placed in the
nests of Blackbirds and Thrushes, and were duly hatched. The young flourished, and,
finally, quite a considerable flock would collect daily to a feeding ground on the
lawn. All went well till late October, when every single free bird would clean
vanish ; and all attempts to trace their whereabouts failed. A few vague rumours
of their appearance elsewhere could not be corroborated. Some of the young birds
which bred in the wild were transferred to cages suspended close to the nests and fed
through the bars by the foster-parents ; but most of these died about the same date
as the others disappeared. The instinct of migration is very strong in the American
Robin--as in its cousin, the Fieldfare--and the presumption is that, when the due
date came and the arc of the sun grew lower, these birds were irresistibly compelled
to fly to the south. There are bird-watchers in all countries, and as no news was

ever received of the appearance of the Robins in the southern countries, it was
supposed that they all perished over the sea. The experiment was carried on for a
number of years--quite how many I do not remember--but never did a free bird
stay or return or leave trace. A few caged birds were kept for a while, but the larger
experiment was surrendered. The melancholy end has at least proved that the
instinct of migration in a migratory species is irresistible, and more or less independent
of geographical conditions. One Sutton Place gardener, an excellent observer,
prophesied that the caged young would be poisoned by their foster-parents when
they were fully fledged, and when these birds died he alleged that hard bits of yew
leaf were found in the crop.--W. Beach Thomas.
" [Another newspaper proprietor made an experiment with birds. Arthur Pearson,
Northcliffe's rival, tried keeping hundreds of rare birds in an immense aviary. But,
says his biographer, ' he found it impossible to keep hundreds of varieties together
and, on most days, at least half a dozen were killed through fights.'-- Editor,

Stalingrad Hospital Laboratory Fund
A fund is being raised in Britain to equip a hospital in Stalingrad, to express in
a permanent form the British people's gratitude to the defenders of Stalingrad who
have made such a great contribution to the final victory of the United Nations. It
seems appropriate that British scientists should equip the laboratory of this hospital
and a special fund is therefore being raised, under the auspices of the Joint Com-
mittee for Soviet Aid, for this purpose. Leading British scientists have associated
themselves with this appeal and members of the Avicultural Society are asked to
support this particularly suitable form of expressing their appreciation of the efforts
of the Soviet people. Donations should be sent to : Stalingrad Hospital Laboratory

THE HIGH PRICE OF BIRD SEED
Friday the thirteenth ! To-day I have paid the exorbitant sum of 27 s. Qd. for a
pint of very inferior plain Canary--and not pure seed at that. The fact of my doing
this is not due to my being severely bitten by the Squander Bug, but of necessity
because two pairs of Red-faced Lovebirds steadfastly refuse to partake of any seed
other than Canary. For some months I have been paying prices ranging between
1 ys. and 22s. 6 d., but this latest is easily a " new high "--almost equivalent to the
price of 1 cwt. in days gone by !
Supplies of canary, white millet, white sunflower, etc., are, of course, exceedingly
short, but surely not sufficiently short to justify the profiteering that must be going on.
There are still small stocks available and only last week offers were invited for 5 cwt.
canary ; and judging by the rediculously high prices offered by traders this little
parcel will fetch as many hundred pounds.
The following are the current prices offered by " The Trade " :--

Presumably merely to enable them to add an infinitesimal quality to their various

It seems unlikely that the position will improve for some time to come. The
Ministry of Food can hardly be expected to bother about the import of bird seeds.
We hear that shipments of wine are being made from Algiers--the wine being used
as ballast. Surely, provided supplies of seed are readily available they would make
just as good, if not better, ballast ? When consignments do eventually arrive it is to
be hoped that prices will be controlled, and that they do not fall into the hands of
" Speculators ".
It is, as yet, very early days ; when, however, the situation improves still further

The above should be added to Dr. E. Hopkinson's invaluable Breeding Records.
Mr. Alder tells me that four eggs were laid of which three hatched--two young being
fully reared. Last year eggs were produced by this pair, but proved to be infertile.
In June this year one of the hybrids got through into the next aviary and immediately
paired with a Masked Lovebird hen. Five eggs were laid and five hatched, but the
last to hatch was over a week after the first, and died. In a recent letter Mr. Alder
writes that the remaining four are doing well and will soon be leaving the nest.

INTER-GENERIC HYBRID STORKS HATCHED
AT SEMI-LIBERTY

By W. C. Osman Hill, M.D., Ch.B., F.Z.S., etc.
Weinman (1940) recorded the breeding in 1937 and 1938 of some
Indian Painted Storks {Ibis leucocephalus ; formerly Pseudotantalus
leucocephalus ) in a state of semi-domestication in the small collection
of local animals at that time kept on exhibition at the Colombo
Museum. The birds were not caged, but after wing-clipping, or in
some cases, pinioning by myself, they were allowed to wander about
the Museum grounds at will. As far as I am aware, this was the
first record of the breeding of birds of this family under such con-
ditions.
In 1942 the Museum collection was unfortunately broken up and
much of its contents, including all the waterfowl that I was able to
capture, transferred to the Zoological Gardens at Dehiwela, where
the Herons, Storks, etc., were added to the others already on exhibition
there in a similar state of semi-liberty.
But I am anticipating somewhat. A year or more before the dis-
banding of the Museum collection, Mr. G. M. Henry, of that institution,
had drawn my attention to the periodic appearance among the
Museum Storks of a strange bird resembling an Adjutant, but not
conforming with the description of the Lesser Adjutant {Leptoptilos
javanicus) --the only known local species of the genus. He inquired
if we had any exotic species at Dehiwela other than the Greater
Adjutant {L. dubius) which, again, did not fit the description of the
newcomer. I informed him that we had not ; whereupon he remarked
that it was either a completely new species ; or, as he suspected,
a hybrid between the Lesser and Greater Adjutants. I was not certain
at that time whether the Dehiwela birds had been nesting or not,
and even if they had, I was doubtful whether either the original

Dehiwela birds or their offspring could or would take the trouble
to leave their ideal environment and travel across the city for a
distance of five miles to fraternize with the Museum birds in their
admittedly less admirable, though adequate, surroundings. The
subsequent story, however, proves that this is actually what had
taken place. Meantime, at Mr. Henry's suggestion I photographed
the doubtful bird for purposes of record and awaited events.
About the time of the transfer of the Museum Storks to Dehiwela,
the Greater Adjutants were confined in a paddock, as they were too
quarrelsome with the smaller kinds. Hence they have been ruled
out of any participation in the present story.
We now know that four broods of hybrid Storks have been produced
at Dehiwela ; and careful observations have shown that the eggs
were laid by a Lesser Adjutant whose mate proved, of all things, to be
a much smaller Indian Painted Stork or Rosy Wood-Ibis ( Ibis leuco-
cephalus). The nest has, in each instance, been built on top of an
aviary containing Vultures, and other raptorial birds, which stands
on a high bank overlooking one of the ponds. The nest was composed
of loose twigs carried to the spot by both parents not only preparatory
to, but also during the process of egg-deposition, as well as after the
hatching of the young. Two young were hatched on 4th April, 1940 ;
and three on each of the other three occasions, 31st October, 1940,
16th March, 1941, and 20th February, 1942. No activity has occurred
so far this year, probably because the Zoo is now full of hybrids.
One brood was completely wiped out when quite young by bad
monsoon weather, but all the others were reared by the parents,
who take turns both in incubating the eggs and in the after-care of
the hatchlings.
Little can be observed of the young in the earliest days after hatching,
but they appear to be naked or nearly so. They shortly, however,
become clothed with white down more or less all over, including the
parts which are naked in the adult Adjutant. At this stage they are
comical objects, sitting, when the parents leave the nest, with their
necks stretched out, making asthmatic sounds to attract attention.
They grow very rapidly and within a few weeks stand up on the nest,
which is exposed to the full glare of the sun in the daytime, without
any attempt to wander off. Even when they do leave the nest they
stay for weeks on top of the Vultures' aviary before taking to their
wings and joining the other Storks which have their freedom in the
gardens. Once they have found the use of their wings, however, they
spend quite a lot of time wheeling about overhead at a great height,
often without flapping their wings for long periods. This habit is also
indulged in by both parental species.
After losing the original white, downy plumage, the hybrids display
a more or less uniform dirty brown clothing which is, in turn, gradually

changed for a habit closely resembling that of the Adjutant, whereas
the previous crop of feathers is more in accord with the life-history of
the young Painted Stork, which disports a brown habit for a time.
The adult plumage is of a more sombre tint than that of the adult
Adjutant. It is a less pure black, or grey, having a brownish element.
The white underparts are, however, like that of the Adjutant, including
also a white rump, ordinarily concealed when the wings are at rest.
The chief differences from the Adjutant lie in the colour of the naked
parts of the face and neck, and in the quantity of hairy feathering
on these parts.
A brief outline is first necessary of these regions in the Adjutant,
since they are inadequately described by Wait (1931). The pure
Adjutant has a heavily-built, boat-shaped, dirty, horn-coloured bill,
succeeded by a naked face of dull, dirty, purplish-pink. The top of
the head has a brownish horn-coloured " pate " of keratinized skin--
quite naked ; but behind this, on the occiput, is a tuft of blackish,
hair-like feathers, tending to be continued as a median linear crest
down the back of the neck, whence the alternative name of Hair-
crested Stork which has been applied to the species. The skin of the
back of the head and of practically the whole neck, the rest of which
is almost naked, is a sallow, dirty yellow, except for a patch of purplish-
pink on either side near its root, just anterior to the shoulders. The
iris of the Adjutant, stated by Wait to be " whitish ", is actually a very
pale blue. The legs are slate coloured, without any brown tinge &amp;apos;
mentioned by Wait, whose observations were probably based on dry
skins.
In great contrast to this is the state of affairs in the Painted Stork.
Here the bill is slenderer, somewhat curved down at the tip, which
is rounded instead of pointed, and of a light orange colour. There
are some naked parts on the crown, face, and throat, all of a light
orange hue, but the extent of the naked area varies individually,
probably increasing with age. The neck is wholly feathered, the
feathered region commencing abruptly at the back of the head or on
the hinder part of the crown. In colour the neck plumage is white,
as is also the major part of the body plumage. The primaries, secon-
daries, and rectrices, however, are black, with a greenish reflection.
This is relieved and beautified by the delicate rosy pink of the
tertiaries, which are edged with white ; the tinging of the scapulars
and under tail coverts with similar colour ; the black-edging of the
lesser wing coverts ; and a broader blackening across the breast and
on the under surface of the wings.
The hybrid Storks, although, as mentioned already, agreeing
almost completely with the Adjutants in their general bodily plumage
as well as in their larger size, differ in the following points :--
(a) Tendency to more complete feathering of the neck.

( b ) Different colour of the naked parts.
(c) Facial appearance tending towards that of the Painted Stork,
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.985512368421053" page_id="56350852"  page_num="144" year="" vol="">
especially in the older individuals.
As regards the neck the feathers are dirty, brownish-black, and are
of the hair-like character found only in the C# crest 35 of the Adjutant ;
but here they are much more closely planted and clothe most of the
neck. The naked areas on the face are more brightly coloured, though
never as bright as in the Painted Stork, being a rusty-pink, darker on
the throat and paler round the eyes, where the skin has a greenish-
yellow tinge. The irides are greenish-brown.
It would seem, therefore, that in these Storks the black and white
plumage characteristic of the Adjutants is dominant to the more
completely white plumage of the Painted Stork. The following
characters would also seem to behave as dominant Mendelian factors :
(i) " feathered neck 33 (dominant to naked neck) ; (ii) black, hairy
neck feathers (dominant to white normal) ; (iii) orange neck-skin
(dominant to yellow) ; (iv) dark iris (dominant to blue).
In conclusion importance must be attached to the fact that two
individuals of different genera of Storks have chosen to combine in
the task of rearing families on several occasions despite the availability
of members of their own species in the vicinity.

When war broke out the first thing, I suppose, that occurred to
most of us was the question of whether or not we should be able to
continue to get supplies of food for our birds, when freightage would
presumably be needed exclusively for the transport of human foodstuffs.
Obviously one's rarest birds must therefore be maintained even at
the cost of commoner stock. Here at Keston, after giving the matter
careful consideration, we decided to liberate most of our common
African Waxbills and from my own naturally-planted " bachelor "
aviary I decided to let out the Pekin Robins, and Orange-headed
Ground Thrush, a Common Mynah, and a bird which by the dealers
had been optimistically called a Crimson-breasted Thrush. The latter,
I may say, had not the slightest vestige of crimson anywhere in its
plumage, and was an extremely dull, wild, mud-coloured bird with
buffish-brown areas on the breast, so that its instant departure on
being liberated was no great loss.
The large flock of Waxbills consisted of Fire Finches, Cordon
Bleus, Red-ears, Orange-cheeks, Lavender Finches, Orange-breasts,
Avadavats, and Green and Grey Singing Finches, plus a fair sprinkling
of Paradise and Pintailed Whydahs, Combassous, Atlas, and Orange
Weavers and Saffron Finches.
I am writing this article because I do not suppose ever again shall
I liberate such a large number of foreign birds all at the same time
and their subsequent behaviour is, therefore, I think, of considerable
interest.
The Waxbills, particularly the Red-ears, Orange-cheeks, Orange-
breasts, and Fire Finches, all kept together in a flock, and it was
interesting to see how much of their time was spent on or close to
the ground. Sometimes they would all be found sitting together in
a particular blackthorn in the sun, but most of their time was spent
in the tall grasses and weeds, such as teazel, etc. As one approached
them the whole flock would go off, looking rather like a swarm of
bees and flying not more than 6 feet from the ground, only to settle
again at the further side of our 8-acre meadow.
Curiously enough one patch of hawthorn, which was much over-
grown with old man's beard, at a particular corner of this field,
seemed to have a great attraction for the Waxbills and they could
usually be seen flying to and fro from this spot to the aviaries from
which they had been liberated. Incidentally we continued to feed
them in hoppers in these aviaries, leaving the windows of the shelters
open so that they could fly in and out at will, and I may add that by
November many of them had been caught up as, to our surprise, there
was still a considerable sale for them.

E. BOOSEY-BUT ONCE IN A LIFETIME
The Lavender Finches made a pretty sight and usually kept together,
and the Avadavats were particularly lovely and in addition have the
added advantage of possessing a very melodious and oft-repeated
little song.
Gordon Bleus I have often kept at liberty before, but was once
again struck with the beauty of their buff and sky-blue plumage
especially when seen against a background of living greenery.
Fire Finches, which are the best and most certain stayers of all the
small Waxbills, were particularly tame and fearless, and displayed
a partiality for domestic buildings which I believe they are said to
do in their native Africa, so much so indeed that a large flock of them
could usually be found in a seed shed, many of them sitting sedately
in rows on the large central perches of a stack of parrot cages which
were stored there ! This shed was left open all night as a retreat for
any of the birds which cared to use it, but it was the Fire Finches to
which it seemed to appeal as a roosting place.
One of the things which most surprised me was the fact that hardly
any of the Orange-breasted Waxbills seemed to stray, whereas I have
several times tried Waxbills at liberty before, and had always found
that the Orange-breasts went off at once. On these occasions, however,
I used to liberate not more than three or four pairs of each kind, and
it would seem that under such circumstances Orange-breasts stray
at once, but remain if liberated in a large flock.
It is difficult to say exactly how many of the Orange Weavers
remained, as most of them were out of colour, and therefore at a
distance very difficult to distinguish from Sparrows. A good many
nests, however, were constructed in the hedges, though these, judging
from their size, were mostly the work of the Atlas Weavers.
The majority of the Paradise Whydahs were also out of colour, but
some of the Pintailed in colour proved very spectacular with their long
black tail feathers streaming out behind them as they flew. These,
too, indulged in curious and interesting nuptial flights. Every now
and then several would mount lark-like high in the air, descending in
a rapid spiral which admirably displayed the decorative qualities of
their long tails.
The Gombassous at liberty were chiefly notable for the terrific speed
of their flight, which was usually accompanied by their harsh, chatter-
ing cry. More than all the other small birds they seemed to take a
joy in flying for flying's sake, and would often dash off at a tremendous
speed from one place to another, apparently with no definite object
in view.
The bright orange and yellow of Saffron Finches made a parti-
cularly good show, and if and when times ever become normal again
I would strongly recommend them as liberty birds, since in addition
to their showy qualities they are excellent stayers.

There were some sweet songsters among the Grey Singing Finches.
Of all small foreign seed-eating song birds this, I think, is my favourite,
and the volume of the bird's song compared with its size is truly
astonishing. I only wish they could be naturalized and added to the
number of our native birds.
Now as to the birds released from my planted aviary.
The " Crimson-breasted Thrush ", as I have said, made off at
once, and although I saw the Orange-headed Ground Thrush on the
lawn two or three days after it was let out, that was the one glimpse
I got of it, so, presumably, it too must have quickly strayed.
The Pekin Robins remained for some considerable time, but proved
to be extremely skulking in their habits, and I was only aware that
they were still about from hearing their song, which usually issued
from the depths of the thickest bushes.
By far the best stayer proved to be the Common Mynah, and this
was particularly surprising, as it had been desperately wild in an aviary
and gave the impression of a bird that would dash off the moment it
got the chance of doing so. Actually, however, it took up its abode in
a particular plum tree in the garden, being always much in evidence,
and regularly appearing when I fed the birds in my planted aviary,
in order to be given its daily quota of mealworms. When it was first
liberated it fed largely on plums, chiefly I think those rather over-ripe
ones which had been already started on by wasps. It was amusing
to watch it walking sedately up and down a path bordered by
Golchnis Gem Dahlias, methodically tapping each bloom with its
beak and eating any earwigs which happened to drop out ! Altogether
it was a nice bird at liberty, though it could not be called showy and
its flight, even under such conditions, was somewhat laboured and heavy.
In passing I might mention that I am, unfortunately for myself,
in the position to advise those who contemplate liberating a Hunting
Cissa not to do so. The hen of a pair in my possession unhappily
escaped when they were being moved into a new aviary, and though
she was seen the next day subsequently completely disappeared and
was never seen again.
In conclusion I might mention a young hen Rosella which escaped
while being removed from its parents at the beginning of August.
As she lost her heart to a cock Brown's X Rosella hybrid, of which
I had three, I decided to liberate him as a companion for her. The
hybrid made a particularly brilliant and fascinating spectacle as he
winged his way about the garden, skimming with incredible speed
and accuracy through gaps between the branches of trees and some-
times diving suddenly down into a hedge, as Broadtails will. One
moment I shall not forget was when we were having tea on the lawn
by a lily pool and both came and perched on the shallow basin of the
fountain, in which they proceeded to have a bath.

Unfortunately the hybrid disappeared after a week or two, and as
he was very devoted to his Rosella wife, who remained, I can only
suppose that he was either captured or shot, as he would have been
most unlikely to stray away without her.

Though I have looked up every reference in Dr. Hopkinson's invalu-
able index, and the indices of each separate volume not covered by it,
I have failed to find the coloured plate of Poeocephalus senegalus which
I was convinced had appeared in some volume of the Avicultural
Magazine.
The only such plate at my disposal is not mentioned in the Doctor's
" List of coloured plates of Parrots " in Vol. VIII (Third Series)
of the Magazine. This plate appears in Vol. II of Greene's Parrots in
Captivity , and, though fairly accurate as regards colour, it misses the
distinctive pose of this little Parrot which, in size, is perhaps slightly
larger than a Missel-Thrush.
In colour the species is a beautiful blending of slate and dark grey
(head, cheeks, and upper part of the throat), grass-green (all the upper
parts and upper breast except the tops of the tail and primaries, which
are dark brown), orange (lower breast), and bright yellow (tail
coverts). The beak is horn grey, the irides sulphur yellow, and the
cere dark brown.
Though he is not the only specimen of this delightful species I have
possessed, I am not thinking in terms of species but of one individual
of it who answers to the name of " Joey " and whose limited vocabu-
lary includes the answer to his own question, " Who are you ? " . . .
" Mr. Joey."
Senegals are no talkers, but Joey, at any rate, is so surprisingly apt
in the use of his limited phrases as to suggest an association of ideas
in the avian mind to an extent I have never observed in any other bird.
Two instances of this association of ideas seem worth recording.
Both are connected with the war-time necessity of economizing labour
in a large rectory with no outside domestic staff. This has meant
turning the kitchen, where Joey normally lives, into a breakfast room.
Silence (avian !) reigns while porridge (which he does not fancy)
is being consumed, but no sooner has the toast rack come into play
than " Mr. Joey " utters a shrill and piercing call, never uttered at
any other time, and persisted in until he has been provided with
a crust smeared with either marmalade, jam, or better still, the honey
from the apiary which, I am almost ashamed to say, now occupies

the site of my outside aviary in those halcyon days when not only
rare birds but the wherewithal to keep them in well-being were to
be had almost for the asking.
Even the most frugal breakfast has to be cooked by someone, be
that someone male or female, clerical or lay. To summon to the
repast the other member of the " staff " of two, I use a peculiar whistle,
but, as often as not, and particularly if my culinary activities have been
at all dilatory, I am forestalled by Joey with such an exact imitation
of the call that my wife often arrives prematurely from her activities
in the upper regions. The point of interest here is that, though the
kitchen is sometimes used for other meals neither I nor Joey use the
special summons at any other than breakfast-time. Since I first
obtained him, about six years ago, Joey has considerably altered his
habits. Then, as now, he had full liberty and was constantly on the
wing until the annoyance of trying to induce him to return to his
cage at nightfall from some high perch led me to clip the primaries
of one wing. They have grown long since, but, except when scared,
he now never attempts to fly, and contents himself with climbing
about on the shrubs outside the kitchen window. Incidentally, the
species, though strong fliers once on the wing, are most clumsy in
alighting on the ground, probably because being naturally arboreal
they seldom have occasion to do so.
In his early youth (I think he was immature when I got him) he
would let me do what I liked with him, and I often carried him about
in my pocket or on my shoulder. Now, and without any apparent
reason for the change of attitude, I can only touch him at the dire
risk of a gashed finger--though he will allow my wife to take what
liberties she will with him, comes to her call when he entirely ignores
mine, and with uplifted wings utters a sort of croon when she speaks
to him.
I believe this complete change of attitude in the adult from that
of the immature bird illustrates that sex-consciousness observable,
I am told, in other species of the Parrot family, some of which exhibit
it even in their attitude to quite young children.
In looking up the references to the species in early volumes of the
Magazine I came across some correspondence on the ideal pet bird,
and more than one correspondent gave the palm to Poeocephalus
senegalus.
However that may be, in general there is one direction in which
the species (at any rate as represented by this particular specimen)
can make out a good case for being the ideal war-time bird since he
presents none of those feeding problems which weigh so heavily on
the minds of most aviarists who have had to watch their birds gradually
dwindling away for lack of proper food. To all intents and purposes
Joey is omniverous, and except for a few days mopiness during his

winter moult, or if subjected for any length of time to a low temperature,
he is always in excellent health and spirits, in spite of a diet which
flouts the advice of all authorities on the feeding of Parrots. In his
wanderings about the kitchen sink he must, at one time or another,
have sampled almost every form of food used for human consumption--
and some which isn&amp;apos;t.
Meat is supposed to be " verboten ", but only permanent caging
could prevent such an incurably inquisitive creature, who likes to
have his beak in every pie and every dish, from occasionally sampling
even that.
His staple diet is a home-grown mixture of oats, rye, and sunflower
seed, with plenty of fruit, except for the six weeks or so in the year
when it is not easily obtainable.
When " this tyranny is overpast 55 and we can once again occupy
our spare time--more or less--as we choose, I am minded (if for no
more utilitarian reason than appreciation of their generous and welcome
contribution to the war-time larder) to leave the bees in possession
of the sometime aviary and concentrate on birds which, like Joey,
require neither cage nor aviary to retain their companionship.

WILD BIRDS AT THE NEW YORK
ZOOLOGICAL PARK

The New York Zoo, in the Bronx Park, has long been known for
its particularly large and fine series of exotic birds. Mr. Lee Crandall,
now the General Curator, who for nearly thirty years has had charge
of the bird collection, is a keen and experienced aviculturist. He has
succeeded in building and maintaining it up to a high standard from
the beginning. Even to-day, when since more than a year all importa-
tions have ceased, we still can show a large number of rare species.
Our collection of perching birds is undoubtedly the best in existence
at present. Our Head Keeper of birds, Mr. George Scott, who came
from England, is to be congratulated for the good condition of our
birds ; among them, old specimens are now numerous, but they do
not show any unfortunate signs of age.
Besides our captive birds, however, we are graced by innumerable
wild ones as well. The Zoo is large, extending over some 300 acres.
Adjoining it is the equally large Botanic Garden. The grounds, for
the greater part, are heavily wooded, with fine old trees, rocks, streams,
and lakes. There is also plenty of high grass and bushes ; this explains
the abundance of wild life.

J. DELAGOUR-WILD BIRDS AT THE NEW YORK ZOO 1 5 1
The picture varies according to seasons, and, naturally, spring and
autumn are particularly interesting. One of the great features of the
Park is the large number of native waterfowl found everywhere.
There are over a hundred full-winged Canada Geese and four times
as many Mallards, all the year round and breeding regularly. Their
numbers increase in the autumn through the arrival of winter visitors.
Some Black Ducks remain during the summer, but the huge flocks
which winter with us go north in the spring. There are a few wild
breeding pairs of Carolina, or Wood Ducks, but most of them migrate
south in the cold weather.
During the autumn, winter, and early spring several other species
of Ducks appear for shorter or longer periods, principally Wigeon, .
Pintails, Goosanders, and Hooded Mergansers, Golden-eyes, Lesser
Scaup, etc., the most numerous being the Greater Scaup, which stay
late in the spring. They usually become fairly tame.
Unfortunately Waterfowl breeding in the park have many enemies.
Horrible wild boys, unfortunately too numerous in this part of New
York City, destroy many nests, in spite of the keepers' vigilance.
Then we have, in North America, a terrible pest unknown to Europe,
the snapping turtle. Some of them, in our Bronx waters, reach 50 lb,
or even more in weight, being strong enough to kill any bird. In fact,
last winter we lost two Black Swans whose heads had been almost
cut off by those brutes, and this very summer a large and savage
Whooper was killed in the same way. We destroy as many turtles
as possible, but it is extremely difficult to exterminate them as they
hide in the mud. Another check on the numbers of waterfowl is the
occurrence almost every summer during the hot weather of epidemics
of botulism on our larger and shallower lakes. The birds become
paralysed and would die if not caught up and immediately treated
by cold, pure water. In spite of the above three scourges we really
have more wild Geese and Ducks than we want. The flights of the
Canada Geese, from one pond to another, constitute one of the great
natural attractions of the Park.
Three acclimatized European birds abound, as in all other eastern
American towns : English Sparrows, Starlings, and Rock Pigeons,
and they often prove a nuisance. The Pigeons, offspring of escapes
from domesticity generations ago, are all colours, like those of London ;
but to my amazement they habitually perch and roost on trees here.
They have changed to that extent their normal habits, which is a
curious and unusual fact indeed. Perhaps the absence of Wood
Pigeons in America is the cause of it--in London, in Paris, and else-
where, where they abound, they may keep the common Pigeons off
the trees if they begin to show an inclination to acquire this new habit.
To return to water birds, one of our most interesting inhabitants
is the Night Heron. There are always a dozen or two of these fine

birds, quite tame, around the pens of our captive Herons and Storks,
waiting to steal a part of their meals. They nest miles away from the
Zoo, but there are always some with us, even during the winter.
At migration time many small waders visit us, mostly Yellow-shanks
and various Sandpipers. They never stop more than a few days.
Herring Gulls are always seen, numerous in the winter and till
late in the spring, when they prove destructive to ducklings. A few
remain with us during the summer. Only one Hawk nests around
the Park, the pretty little American Kestrel. But Sharp-shinned and
Cooper's Hawks, a smaller and larger edition of the European Sparrow
Hawk, live in the vicinity and pay occasional visits, while many others
are winter passage migrants ; most of them belong to three species
of American Buzzards known as Red-tailed, Broad-winged, and Red-
shouldered Hawks. There are always a few pairs of Belted Kingfishers
about the lakes.
The only species of Pigeon native to N.E. America, since the
Passenger Pigeon has been exterminated, is the Mourning Dove.
It is not common in the Park, but a pair is seen now and then and
they nest occasionally.
The lovely Ruby-throat Humming-bird, abundant around New
York, is very seldom seen in the Park. But every year some are
captured in the city during their migration and brought to us. They
do well in our planted aviaries.
The Downy Woodpecker and the Flicker, which respectively take
the place of the European Lesser Pied and Green Woodpeckers, are
common residents. The Hairy, replacing the European Greater Pied
Woodpecker, is a winter visitor.
A great number of birds arrive in the spring, nest with us, and
migrate south in the autumn. Probably the most conspicuous are
the large Grackles, almost as brilliant as the African Glossy Starlings.
They are very common and fearless. We also have many Gowbirds,
smaller and finch-like, parasitic on almost every species of small
birds. In the late summer thousands visit us for a few weeks on their
trip to the south. Two Troupials, the Redwing, and the Baltimore
Oriole nest in small numbers.
The American Robin is a nice Thrush as familiar as its cousin
the Blackbird is in England. Unfortunately its song is not nearly
as good. They keep to lawns and gardens. The smaller and prettier
Wood Thrush lives more under cover ; its song is charming ; we have
many of them. The small and dainty Hermit, Olive-backed, Grey-
checked, and Veery Thrushes visit us in the spring, the latter nesting
in the neighbourhood. We never see the lovely Bluebirds, although
they are common enough in the more open parts of the district.
American Willow Tits, here called Chickadees, White-breasted
Nuthatches, and House-Wrens are fairly common residents, and a

few allied species join them in winter, when we also see some Brown
Tree-creepers.
Of the Mocking-bird family we have some pairs of Brown Thrashers,
excellent songsters, and lots of the delightful Catbirds, fearless and
amusing. They come to nest during the warm season, as do some
Tyrant-flycatchers, the large Crested, and the small Wood-Peewee
and Phoebe.
Barn-Swallows, very similar to the European, are the only common
ones in New York.
The numerous species of American Warblers, completely different
from the Old World Warblers, much more highly coloured, and in
fact not at all closely related to them, are probably the most typical
and attractive group of North American birds. In the spring they
simply swarm in our woods. Most species go north to nest, but a few
stay for the summer, namely, the charming little " Redstart ", the
Yellow and the Maryland Yellow-throat.
Another charming summer resident is the Red-eyed Vireo. For
a few days in the spring we see some gorgeous N. A. Scarlet Tanagers,
very similar to the well-known Brazilian, but with a smaller and black
beak ; it exchanges its red colour for a yellowish green during the
winter, when it goes south. A very conspicuous, familiar, and pretty
bird, very abundant all the year round in the Park, although there are
various migrating moves among the population, is the Blue Jay.
It is smaller, tamer, and less destructive than its distant European
cousin. It just misses being a really beautiful bird in having too much
grey mixed on the face and under parts ; were these pure white it
would be really one of the finest species of the group.
Finches and other thick-billed birds are numerous in N. America,
and some are very bright, such as the Rose-breasted Grosbeak, the
Purple Finch, the Towhee, and the Indigo Bunting, which visit the
Park at migration time. The handsome little American Goldfinch,
in its rich yellow plumage, also comes, and a few stay to breed.
Unfortunately the beautiful Red Cardinal, common in gardens across
the Hudson, just south of New York, hardly ever crosses the river,
which now is its northern boundary ; but the species is gradually
extending north so that it may settle in our Park soon. It would be
a wonderful addition to the bird population.
Of the innumerable species of Buntings known in America as
" Sparrow ", only the Song and Chipping Sparrows are resident.
Several other species of these inconspicuous little brown birds, which,
however, have great charm and often nice voices, pass on migration,
\vhile others spend the winter with us, such as the Slaty Junco.
British readers will recognize among the wild birds which I have
mentioned many handsome species--highly sought after as aviary
birds in Europe. The truth is that the North American avifauna is

By H. G. Martin
Since I was at school, besides being a lover of birds--though I have
actually kept comparatively few species and of these not many
individuals--there has always been in my make-up a fondness for
carpentry and kindred handicrafts, a combination which in fact will,
I believe, often be found in very many of us who find great pleasure
in the study, as well as the entertainment and society, of living
creatures. For does not the former quality in a great measure give
rise to the latter by the very desire and need that one feels to do the
best one can to house bird and animal friends as fittingly and worthily
as one can and to provide nicely for their wants, since willing captives
though they be, or become in most cases, captives they are and thus
must rely solely upon us for their happiness and well-being.
And another thing ! If one have the bump of construction one is
largely and beautifully independent in building matters of the paid
workman, who does not always carry out as one would have them, nor
does he greatly trouble his head about, precise details and finish which
furthermore may, and would in fact, call for far too much of that
costly item " man's time ", whereas the happy amateur can put in a
priceless, in more than one sense, hour or two, just when the fancy
takes him, and as his plans and ideas mature.
My present home when I acquired it had one blank wall facing
south, about 25 feet long, the ground beside it being rough and con-
cealing some old foundations which made it valueless for gardening,
even had I desired so to use it. Well ! I thought, here after many
vicissitudes and an unsettled life both in England and abroad, here
at last is my chance to realize a minor ambition and build myself a
small aviary after my own ideas, beginning with the conviction
that there is nothing like a lean-to, against a wall, owing to the warmth
and protection this affords, and to the fact that it provides one
supporting side already made, greatly helping frame and roof con-
struction. But also I must have a workshop--and I fancied a little
greenhouse as well : the former was an absolute sine qua non ,
but wiser should I have been to forego the latter entirely and use all
the space for aviary, since, owing to the southern aspect--Hobson's
choice--and my neighbour's high board fence intervening, both
proved to be far too hot on bright summer days, and the greenhouse

space would have provided a much wider flight as well as a much
roomier inner compartment.
To my mind really nice aviaries can be divided broadly, and con-
structed in, two distinct classes : ( a ) the spacious rustic, or " natural "
type, the flight of which can be furnished with tree trunks, growing
shrubs, and even grass, gravel and sometimes rock-work, and constant
water, and (b) the purely artificial or " formal ", with utility fittings,
in which, none the less, birds will do exceedingly well, be most happy
and often breed freely, notwithstanding " unnatural " environment.
There are also, of course, the " hen-run " type, lightly and inelegantly
put together, and the pre-fabricated " standard pattern " type,
designed, I fear, too often by makers who of aviculture have no deep
understanding ; for neither of these have I much sympathy.
Type [a) I have been privileged to see in some fine collections and
zoos, but for the great majority of us it is, as I idealize it, for reasons
of space and situation, upkeep, and attention, apart from first cost,
practically out of the question. Type ( b ) then is the one for me, and
I will try to show broadly how I brought it into being, firstly, of
course, putting the approximate design and dimensions upon paper,
an essential preliminary with any construction to the achievement of
good results.
Let me begin with the base or foundation : this was first cleared,
to some six inches or so, of loose soil which was replaced by the same
depth of builder's rubble broken fairly small and beaten down level,
so providing a soakaway for rain water as well as a defence against
burrowing vermin, this layer being topped eventually with smooth
cement for the shelter compartment and easily renewable sand for
the flight. It has always been painful, exasperating almost, to me
to read over and over again in many accounts of aviculturists of the
doings of their birds, about the heart-breaking destruction, by mice,
rats, or a weasel, of promising broods or clutches of eggs. But I do
not sympathize with them greatly, for have they not nearly always
themselves to blame, for not providing, first and foremost, non-
penetrable foundations, topped by a foot, or less, of neat brick walling
--one brick thick is enough--built into which at the required intervals
come the main supports of the framework rising above it. Use the
best small mesh wiring, keep it painted, black to assist vision, and to
prevent corrosion, let all doors and openings fit well, and no mouse
will ever trouble you.
Cement work, once simple first principles are learnt, is really very
interesting and quite easy, though a little rough and not to be under-
taken except one be duly clad in dungarees or one's very worst suit.
There is something fascinating--and satisfying--about creating, for
example, from just old broken bricks a neat little surround wall
which will be a solid and enduring, and even artistic, basis for the

structure above it, as well as a shield from vermin and in part from
the elements. Various little refinements can be introduced too, such
as a neat cement capping to that wall, a smooth inner finish, which
will always be clean, and even effects such as external " pointing "
coloured by the addition to the mortar of a little red ochre. A curved
corner too (if a curve can be a corner, though we do talk about " going
round the corner ") to match a curving path looks well, and may
be readily attained, as in my case, by the use of some simple pieces of
flexible ply-board " shuttering " as moulds to build against and
remove when all is duly set. One can even effect the combination of
that curve with the upward slope of the roof, where the two must meet,
using as a reinforcement any piece of bendable strip-iron and ply-
wood again for moulds.
In writing all this I speak, of course, of the happy days gone by--
pro tem. only, let us hope--when materials were readily obtainable
at moderate prices, nice clean-planed quartering in various sizes for
posts and framing, feather-edge board for the outer side of the shelter,
asbestos sheet or fibre board for inner lining of divisions and--a
material which I consider very nice indeed for partial aviary work--
" Georgian " wired glass, such as is used for lift casings, office partitions,
and so on, and which could be had in large sheets, constituting a
strong, ready-made, smooth and cleanly, non-conducting, translucent
and indestructible (except by great violence) walling, of very pleasing
appearance for ends and divisions, although ordinary thick, ribbed,
or faceted glass is almost as good, with the one great drawback that,
should it be broken, disastrous escapes might result. " Georgian 55
glass is, or rather was, a little costly, something under is. the square
foot, but its advantages justify this.
For my roof, over aviary and workshop, each of which has a skylight,
I used a brand of patent red, rough-surfaced, bituminous tiling, un-
breakable (even by shrapnel, so-called) and pleasing to the eye,
matching well with the usual red tiles of the house, and vastly nicer
than any corrugated or felted roof. This tiling is laid upon tongued
and grooved planking with an intervening layer of tar sheeting :
in it again we have a somewhat expensive material, but its use was
well worth while.
The aviary is about 7 feet high in front and 9 feet at the back : for
the " principals " I used 3 inch by 3 inch (nom.) quartering, and
3 inch by i\ inch for the intermediate posts and roof supports, which
subdivide the wiring into separate frames about 2 feet wide. Each of
these can be easily detached by removing a few equally spaced screws,
should this at any time be necessary for overhaul, repairs, or painting,
though perhaps my real reason for this method of construction is a
dislike in cases like this for the use of nails, and also for wiring per-
manently fastened to main framework by staples. Removable frames,

and screws used judiciously and preferably of brass, make a nicer
and more manageable job, though it will be argued that this means
elaboration in work and materials ; but it gives a neat finish and
nicely stretched wire-mesh. One of the frames, I may add, is hung
on hinges, so constituting an emergency door to the outer flight, which
sometimes proves quite handy.
I spoke above of painting, but of paint proper I used hardly any,
except for the framing of the inner shelter. I prefer to avoid employing
it except on surfaces which are better so covered, disguised, one might
perhaps say. It is messy stuff and on exposed parts it does not stand
the weather and needs renewal every two or three years, with con-
siderable labour. I much prefer for aviary work preservative liquids
which soak into, rather than cover, neat woodwork, and which in my
opinion give a very pleasing effect. My main posts and supports
were simply treated with ordinary thin creosote which gives a warm
dark brown, and the frames carrying the wiring were coloured a dark
blue with one of the several protective colourings on the market
(" Solignum," to be precise), giving quite a nice artistic contrast
and a departure from the green or buff oil paint so commonly used on
light outdoor structures. These fluids, too, are very easy to apply
and, by reason of their spreading and penetrative quality, economical
in use.
The roof of the flight was covered, at the back only, with about
2 ft. 9 in. of the patent tiling, but later it was found desirable to
add a further width of some i ft. 9 in. of common glass as additional
protection from the wet. The wall at the back, in both flight and
shelter, and the asbestos board of the inner partition were treated with
light stone colour water paint, likewise a pleasant and effective material
particularly on rough surfaces. The division is provided with a self-
closing panel which is useful for shutting the birds off on either side :
it acts by counterpoises, like an old-fashioned sash-window, but is
rather apt to go wrong, and another time I should simplify matters,
using one cord only, or a rod controlling it from outside.
With doubts as to the space available, I unfortunately made the
inner shelter too narrow, fearing my workshop would be too small
and, to partly remedy this, later on encroached upon the inner corner
of the latter, to facilitate the feeding arrangements. Although some
unavoidable seedhusk and feathers are a little troublesome amongst
tools and fitments, this expedient of annexing an inner corner has
not proved a bad one, as all is under shelter and, by means of an extra
wired door and a hinged flap giving access to the raised floor, I can
easily attend to the daily rationing, while keeping my food stocks handy
in glass jars on an adjoining shelf. The birds seem to like the scheme
too, and there are always keen-eyed customers waiting in the perch
" tree 55 above, on the lookout for such, now rare, luxuries as a pinch

I58 H. G. MARTIN-THE BUILDING OF AN AVIARY
of canary-seed or a mealworm, when I make my morning or evening
call.
All external doors are provided with efficient closing springs :
gravitation does not act promptly enough, in the case of falling doors
or a weight contrivance, as I know to my cost, through the loss on
one occasion of several valuable birds through a small drop-door--*
which belied its name.
I think it is better not to put in plants of any size too near to an
aviary of this type ; they are apt to get out of hand, take away light,
and cause litter. Not realizing its growing powers, I planted the
well-known " Mermaid " single yellow rose beside mine, at the
house corner, providing it with a trellis, but it proved much too much
of a good thing and has to be cut severely back. A small bed of
geraniums or some such plant is ornamental and all-sufficient.
It is curious how fond many birds are of a ledge, especially high
up, where they can tuck themselves away for a siesta or to pass the
night, and such cosy nooks are likely to result in ordinary construction
--unless one purposely fills them in--for example, where rafters meet
wall-plates ; but it is better to avoid them owing to the difficulty
of keeping such positions clean. Suitable perch arrangements will
provide the birds with a choice of roosting places ; the way I arrange
them is this : with a central piece of wood of square section, bored
through on both faces at selected intervals with a half-inch bit, I build
up with beech " dowel 55 rods--which used to be obtainable at any
hardware store--what one might call, for want of a better word,
a kind of " tree 55 with arms, branches rather, of varying length, and
parallel. This I suspend from a hook, or hooks, in the roof, and
fasten, unless it be heavy enough to hang with very little movement,
to a light detachable cross-bar below, so that it can be taken down
in a moment and scrubbed, the ideal instrument for which was a
copper-cloth saucepan-scraper, formerly obtainable at any chain
store, but now only a pre-war memory. The arms, I should add, are
of such a length as to leave a space of not less than six inches from the
walls, so that all dirt may fall into the sand or sawdust on the cement
floor. Similarly the outer flight is furnished with a kind of inclined
rack of parallel rods suspended from the roof by four wires, making
this, too, immediately removable for cleaning, while a few other
transverse perches are provided with a pin at one end and drop into a
slot at the other, so that they are firmly held but can be lifted out
immediately.
In the floor of the outer flight I let in a piece of narrow drain-pipe
to make a socket for any tree-branch or a couple of pea-sticks which
can be changed now and again, and seem to afford the birds much
amusement. The only other inside utility fittings are a couple of
little moveable shelves for food-pans and an assortment of nesting-

places contrived to different patterns from small boxes or from straw-
berry punnets partly wired over and fastened to a wooden backing,
so that they can be fixed up firmly, and creosoted by way of camou-
flage : the birds take to them readily, and they cost nothing but a little
adapting to a new purpose.
To digress a moment from aviary fitting here is a tip, perhaps
not new, which I have found useful for perches in cages, namely to
fit them between, and not on, the bars by the usual nick or slot. Make
your perches from slips of wood about three-quarter of an inch wide by
half an inch thick, allowing in the length about three-quarters of an inch
at each end, or at one end in the case of a cage with a back. A little
rebate is then cut off this protruding end, reducing it to just the width
between the wires, with the corners slightly rounded off so that it
will just turn stiffly. Then with a small plane the perch can
easily be thinned down to roundness at the middle, thus tapering to
a slight flat at each end. This makes a perch which, while holding
firm, will not jam on the wires and can be removed from outside with
a mere twist of the fingers. The protruding ends are not in the way,
and the birds can please themselves as to whether they perch on the
circular middle or towards the flatter ends, as to which was better
there used to be quite a controversy among canary breeders years ago.
Looking back at all the foregoing, I fear it does not convey a very
precise idea of the result of my building efforts and, had I a suitable
photograph, I would have liked to ask our Editor to reproduce it,
by way of fuller explanation : but there are difficulties nowadays
even in getting a snapshot taken, and I am a poor photographer,
besides which the site does not lend itself to a clear picture. At all
events, I believe I have succeeded in producing a practical, not
unsightly, and durable bird dwelling, on somewhat solid and unusual
lines--it is interesting in such things to aim at something different,
but of course not eccentric--by the employment of a rather large
proportion of glazing and the utilization of sundry odd materials.
In it has lived for the past four years or more, without casualty,
through some severe winters, and in spite of disturbing air raids and
the scarcity of suitable foods, a little band of old stagers, my favourite
White-capped Tanager, the Black-crested Finch, and a few more
old South American and other friends, whose perfect condition is
quite a testimonial to its adequacy.
Without a labour bill, of course, the cost was very moderate, while
the work provided quite a lot of amusement and good exercise. Per-
fection in such tasks one seldom attains and the aviary is not without
several faults, as to which I shall " know better next time "\0x25A0--if next
time ever comes. Meanwhile my hope is that here and there I may
have provided a useful hint to other aviculturists who, happy owners of
a bench and kit of tools, may contemplate the creation, partly at least

Visitors to the London Zoological Gardens cannot fail to be
impressed by the number and variety of the Psittaci still on view
in the Parrot House. The Gardens suffered several times from air-
raids during 1940 and 1941--bombs falling on no less than eight
occasions. Considerable damage was done, but the Parrot House
escaped beyond the loss of glass through blast. Some half-dozen
cages, containing Senegal Parrots, etc., were blown from their stands,
but fortunately their occupants sustained no injury.
The birds, almost without exception, are in excellent condition,
in spite of very restricted supplies of essential seeds, fruits, etc., a state
that reflects great credit on the head keeper, W. Alden, and his
two assistants, S. Groucher and T. Ellis.
The conditions under which birds are exhibited generally at the
Zoo preclude anything very startling in the way of breeding successes.
The policy of the authorities is, of course, to exhibit the largest possible
number of representative species in the most attractive manner, and
breeding on anything like an extensive scale cannot be attempted.
Therefore, it is all the more pleasing that there has been a really
outstanding breeding success in the Parrot House this year--no less
than the Queen Alexandra Parrakeet. A pair presented to the Society
by our President, Mr. A. Ezra, nested in the late spring and reared
two young. There are now five of this magnificent species in one of
the outside flights.
The oldest inhabitant--by residence--is a Banksian Cockatoo
female, in the Gardens since 1908 ; by longevity, a Slender-bill
Cockatoo, " Old Bill," a mere youngster of 93. The " daddy " of all
Cockatoos, " Cocky," a Sulphur-crested, died some months since at
the authentic age of 142 !
There are nearly two hundred birds, excluding Budgerigars, of
ninety species, at present on exhibition--truly a remarkable collection.
Space will not allow of more than passing mention of some of the
rarer and more interesting birds.

In the flights outside the Parrot House, beside the Queen Alexandras,
are a Kea, the recent widower of a pair that had been in the Gardens
since 1938, doing very nicely on a diet of carrot, lettuce, and peanuts :
the female has just died from enteritis, possibly caused by a gift from
a well-meaning visitor. Pairs of Bourke's, Pennant's, King, and single
Elegant, Crimson-winged, and Yellow-rumped Parrakeets ; no less
than five Timor Crimson-winged (A. jonquillaceus) and the beautiful
Crimson-winged X Sula Island King hybrid bred by the Duke of
Bedford, which must be at least fifteen years old now ; and lastly
a pair of Spix Macaws.
The most difficult birds to feed are, naturally, the Loriida. Very
considerable ingenuity is needed to supply them with liquid food
because, of course, it is prohibited to give them anything like honey,
condensed milk, etc., that is fit for human consumption, hence recourse
has to be made to salvaged foods. They all look very fit on their very
substitute diet. Several eat a small amount of canary and sunflower
seed ; the latter no doubt being the inspiration of a visitor who had
given some a plentiful supply of acorns !
The following species are on view and as some have been in the
Gardens for a considerable time the dates of presentation and donors
are given.
Swainson's Lorikeet, pairs, 1937 and 1942 ; Scaly-breasted Lorikeet,
pair, 1937 ; Musk Lorikeet, 1937, all presented by Mr. A. Ezra.
Forsten's Lorikeet, 1929; Ornate Lorikeet, 1936 ; Purple-capped
Lory, 1929 ; Blue-streaked Lory, 1929 ; Red Lory {Eos bornea ), 1929,
all presented by Mr. A. St. Alban Smith ; Red-collared Lorikeet,
female, 1941. Black Lory, 1933. White-rumped Lory, 1939.
Golden-backed Hanging Parrot, 1936.
There are fifteen species of Cockatoo, the most noteworthy being
a Great Black, five Banksian, a Gang Gang male, two very fine
Tritons, a perfect Dwarf Sulphur-crested {K. parvula) from Java,
a pair of Rose-crested, a Blue-eyed, and several Greater White-crested.
The best of the thirteen species of Amazon are a Guilding's, Bodin's,
Yellow-cheeked, Orange-winged, Salvin's, and a pair of Green-
cheeked. The Macaws number twenty-one of seven species, Hyacin-
thine (2), Blue and Yellow (7), Red and Blue (3), Red and Yellow (2),
Military (1), Illiger's (3), Spix (3).
Among the Asiatic Parrakeets are three Derbyan, a Malabar, and
an Indian Ring-necked (P. manillensis) lutino variety, both the last-
named presented by Mr. Ezra.
The African Parrots are a pair of Sudan Brown (Meyer's), Jardine's,
Masai Red-headed (P. gulielmi massaicus), and four Yellow-vented--
better known as Senegal.
Mention must be made of three Red-sided Eclectus, all males,
two Dusky Parrots, a Blue-crowned Parrakeet {Tanygnathus luconensis ),

By Lieut.-Col. Alan Lendon
While returning from leave in April, 1943, I had the opportunity
of inspecting two very fine collections of birds, and I feel that an
account of each will be of interest to the readers of the Avtcultural
Magazine. The first was that of the late O. Gilpin, Esq., of Balwyn,
a suburb of Melbourne. This collection was at that time for sale
by tender, and I inspected it on behalf of the Adelaide Zoo ; I under-
stand that it was subsequently purchased by the Melbourne Zoo.
The collection was, as will be seen, a very extensive one, and most
of the smaller birds were housed in a magnificent block of eighteen
aviaries arranged in quite a novel way. A large rectangular block of
land was enclosed on all sides by a brick wall about 10 or 12 feet in
height, the resulting enclosure was further subdivided into nine equal
rectangles, each of which was again divided diagonally, the result
being eighteen enclosures, the floor space of which was in the shape
of a right-angled triangle, with a pathway which zigzagged to and
fro between the cages. I would estimate the size of each of the nine
rectangles at about 40 by 30 feet; part of each enclosure was roofed in
and all were enclosed with f-in. netting. Now for the occupants of
each. Aviary No. 1 contained five Plumed Ground Doves ; one
common American Dove of a species whose name I forget ; a single
male Virginian Cardinal, and a Red-crested Cardinal ; half a dozen
Whydahs of various species, all common ; a pair of very attractive
yellow Grosbeaks of a species with which I was not familiar ; a single
Pekin Robin ; and an American Quail rather like the common
Californian. There was also some dozen or more Weavers, mostly
out of colour, and a few Rose Finches. The contents of No. 2 were
a fine male Princess Alexandra Parrakeet, a pair of Bourke Grass-
Parrakeets, and about a dozen Budgerigars. No. 3 contained three
nice Banksian Black Cockatoos, two males and a female ; two Red
and Yellow Macaws, one a male and the other of undetermined
sex ; a female Blue and Yellow Macaw and five hybrid Macaws,
the progeny of the above-mentioned male and female. There were
also four Galahs, seven Crested Bronze-wing Pigeons, and an attractive

blue and, black Jay, species unknown to me. In No. 4 were two
Amazons, one Levailliant's, and the other Red-fronted ; a fine male
Palm Cockatoo ; two Green Catbirds ; three Wonga Pigeons ; a pair
of Laughing Jay-Thrushes, and about a dozen common Cockatoos,
such as Sulphur-crested, Bare-eyed, and Galahs. No. 5 contained
a very lovely pair of Brown's Parrakeets and a score or more Budgeri-
gars. In No. 6 was a single Blood-breasted Pigeon and Star Gouldian
Finches and Black-headed Nuns, some twenty in all. The contents
of No. 7 were disappointing, a solitary Cockatiel and about fifty
Budgerigars. No. 8 was devoted entirely to a flock of forty odd Nyassa
Lovebirds. In No. 9 was a showy collection consisting mainly of
Parrots. There was yet another of the hybrid Macaws previously
referred to ; two male King Parrots, a pair of Pennant's Parrakeets ;
two female Red-sided Eclectus Parrots ; two pairs of Barraband's
Parrakeets ; one Eastern Rosella ; four Twenty-eight Parrakeets ;
three Stanley Rosellas ; three Indian Ring-neck Parrakeets, and
nine Californian Quails. There were also three birds which I took
to be Troupials, of a very nice golden colour, and a pair of Crested
Mynahs of a species that I was unable to identify. Aviary No. 10
contained Finches only, nearly all Gouldians, and a few Pictorellas,
about sixty altogether. No. 11 contained a flock of some thirty Black-
cheeked Lovebirds and in addition a single Cockatiel ; a male Hooded
Parrakeet ; a male Red-rump, and a Blue Bonnet of the yellow-vented
race. Aviary No. 12 was devoted entirely to Whydahs and Weavers,
about forty birds, mostly out of colour at the time, but I noticed one
very nice Pin-tailed. In No. 13 were about seventy Finches, mostly
Zebras, but also quite a few Yellow-rumps and a couple of Sporophilae.
No. 14 was given up to a nice flock of about fifty Fischer's Lovebirds.
The outstanding occupants of No. 15 were six Malay Rosellas in very
fine condition, there were also four White Java Sparrows, and about
a dozen Budgerigars. In No. 16 was a fine Senegal Parrot, a few more
Budgerigars, and about sixty Zebra Finches. No. 17 contained yet
another solitary Cockatiel, about a score of Java Sparrows of mixed
colouring, and another fifty or so Budgerigars. No. 18 had a dozen
Cockatiels and a further fifty Budgerigars. Passing out of the aviary
enclosure one next came to a series of small artificial lakes which
were the home of a number of Waterfowl. There was a single White
Swan, over a dozen Black Swans, including some cygnets ; one
Bar-headed Goose ; about thirty Silver Gulls ; a Mandarin Duck ;
a Fulvous Tree-duck ; a pair of Grey Teal ; about thirty Mallards
and Black Ducks apparently mixed indiscriminately ; three White
Mallards ; a pair of Maned Geese and two pairs of Mountain Ducks.
Passing on from the lakes one came to a double enclosure called the
swamp. Here there were three fine African Crowned Cranes ; eight
Bald Coots, some of the Australian and some of the Indian species;

a pair of Stone Plovers ; four Magpie Geese ; one Spur-winged
Plover ; three Straw-necked and one White Ibis ; six Peafowl,
including a white one ; two Nankeen Night Herons and an Australian
Crane. In some large paddocks were a pair of Emus as well as a small
number of Kangaroos and Wallabies. As will be appreciated from
the foregoing the collection was one which must have taken many
years to get together. I am given to understand that its sale realized
in the vicinity of #A650. The late Mr. Gilpin was, I am told, some-
thing of a recluse and very few were privileged to view the collection
during his lifetime. The second collection, which I saw on the following
day, was that of Mr. E. Hallstrom who resides at Northbridge, a
suburb of Sydney. Mr. Hallstrom has for some years been very
interested in the Cockatoos and the larger Parrots and as will be seen,
has got together a really remarkable collection. Unfortunately he
was away from Sydney on the occasion of my visit, but his wife was
kind enough to show me around his many and varied aviaries and
smaller cages. In describing the collection I think one must give pride
of place to the Macaws. There are six or seven pairs of the Red and
Yellow species, many of which are the progeny of one very prolific
breeding pair. There also are two pairs of the Blue and Yellow species,
one of which has several times nested and hatched young, but so far
has not succeeded in rearing them to maturity. The Red and Blue
and Illiger's Macaws are represented by single specimens only.
Turning next to the Cockatoo family, there is a very extensive repre-
sentation. Of the Blacks there are four pairs of Banksians, one of
which hatched, but unfortunately failed to rear a young one last
summer ; there is also a single Yellow-tailed and no less than six of
the rare White-tailed, all in fine plumage and condition. There are
also quite a small flock of the quaint and attractive little Gang-gangs.
All the well-known Australian species such as the Sulphur-crested,
Leadbeater's, Bare-eyed, and Galah are present in varying numbers,
and there are also pairs of both varieties of the Slender-billed Cockatoo.
Two of the Cockatoos from the islands to the north of Australia are
represented in a pair of the rather rare Ducorps' and a truly magnificent
pair of the very large Salmon-crested species. Lastly there is the
ubiquitous Cockatiel. Most of the larger Australian Parrakeets are
included in the collection as well as a few of the smaller ones. Thus,
there were one or more pairs of Barraband's, Rock Pepplers, Queen
Alexandras, Kings, and Crimson-wings in addition to two fine pairs
of Red-sided Eclectus. All the eight species of Rosellas were present
with the exception of the Tasmanian Green. A small flock of ten
Pileateds were as wild as is usual with this species, but in fine con-
dition. All the Australian Ring-necks (Barnardius) were there,
including five of the rare Cloncurry, four of these having been bred
in my own aviaries. The smaller Parrakeets were by no means com-

plete, but I remember noticing Blue Bonnets, Many-colours, and
Red-rumps, Bourke, Elegant, and Rock Grass-Parrakeets, and, of
course, Budgerigars. Of the true Parrots there are nearly twenty
Amazons of five different species, including two that I do not recall
having previously seen. A single African Grey and a very tame
Red-vented Parrot are also amongst those present. The Asiatic
Parrakeets include the Alexandrine, Indian Ring-neck, Javan, and,
I think, the Malabar. There was a single example of the Black-
headed Gonure and the only Lorikeets were several Red-collared.
I think that concludes my recapitulation of a very wonderful collection

QUETZALS
By J. Delacour

The magnificent Quetzals which Mr. G. Cordier brought to New
York last year have lived perfectly well. We kept three pairs at the
Zoo. One hen died six months ago of an old complaint undoubtedly
contracted in Costa Rica, but all the others are in excellent con-
dition ; they have moulted out already twice ; their colours, including
the wonderful scarlet under parts, are as bright as ever. In short,
they have given us no trouble at all. We feared the heat of the New
York summer would be too much for them, and we have had in 1943
the bad luck of an exceptionally hot season, but they never seemed
to mind it in the least.
Each pair is kept separate--two pairs would fight--each in one
of our new large indoor planted flights, in company with Humming-
birds, Sugar-birds, Tanagers, Manakins, Thrushes, Doves, etc., the
odd male shares another cage with similar birds. The Quetzals
have proved so far completely harmless to them, and they do not
damage the vegetation either. Mr. Cordier collected some very
interesting information in Costa Rica about these beautiful birds,
and I hope that the following pages, reproduced from Zoologkd,
xxviii, pp. 105 and 106, may interest our readers :--

In March, 1942, I had the good fortune to meet in San Jose, Costa
Rica, Sehora Amparo Zeledon, widow of the well known ornithologist
who died a few years ago.

<bodyText confidence="0.996375333333334" page_id="56350878"  page_num="166" year="" vol="">
At that time I was starting on a collecting trip having as its objective
the capture of the Bare-necked Umbrella Bird ( Cephalopterus ornatus
glabricollis) and other rare birds for the New York Zoological Society.
It was with considerable elation that I noticed at Sehora Zeledon's
home a large well-planted aviary, approximately 30 ft. by 15 ft.
by 10 ft., in which was a pair of Costa Rican Quetzals, Pharomachrus
mocinno costaricensis , in superb condition. The male trailed behind
in its flight a pair of upper tail coverts nearly a yard long. Subsequently
I was able to purchase this pair and the birds are now (February, 1943)
on exhibition in the New York Zoological Park, together with several
other Quetzals.
The most interesting part of my discovery was that Sehora Zeledon
told me that the Quetzals had reared young successfully on two
occasions and that she had made notes of these events at the time.
She was kind enough to lend me her notes, which I have translated
and reproduced herewith :--
" We noticed the young bird peeping through the entrance hole
on 8th August, 1940, and on the 12th it left the nest.
" Both male and female were feeding it as long as it was confined
to the nest, but once outside, only the mother cared for it, feeding it
earthworms (Of all things--Translator) in the morning, and fruit
(By which is meant cut-up little plaintains known locally as # guinea '*--
Translator). On the 16th of the same month it fed itself for the first
time. I suppose the birds started nesting at the end of June.
" The tree trunk in which they nested had been in the aviary for
more than two years, exposed to the weather, before they showed any
interest in it, the male preferring to enter a bigger, irregularly-
shaped hole in the wall forming one side of the aviary. The female,
however, would only reluctantly go near it, the entrance hole probably
being too wide. Fortunately they decided on nesting in the tree trunk
after two long years, the wood having become soft enough to be
worked on by them.
" The male moulted at the end of August and lost its long tail
coverts at the end of September.
" The plumage of the young bird at the moment it left the nest
was uniform coffee-colour, except the wing coverts which were green.
" Both parents had been kept for three years in the big aviary and
previously for two years in a much smaller aviary in which they would
get very wild as soon as approached. In the big enclosure they are
quite steady and take no notice of visitors. The pair was composed
of a young male and an adult female purchased from the natives.
" February, 1941 : The male, already in good plumage, started
to enter the nest in the middle of February and to clean it out, carrying
loads of dust in his breast feathers which he would shake out, once
outside. Both started uttering their calls and the female entered the

<bodyText confidence="0.995422733333333" page_id="56350879"  page_num="167" year="" vol="">
nest some days later, mornings and afternoons. Both adults started
chasing the young Quetzal from the vicinity of the nest and stayed
continuously near it, even in March.
" On 31st March, 1941, I noticed the female coming out of the
nest to let the male get in. Shortly afterward the male came out
and the female re-entered.
" 19th April : To-day I had the gardener trim the trees in the
aviary, and he noticed two young birds in the nest, maybe eight days
old.
" Five days later we found a dead young Quetzal on the ground.
One side showed signs of having been injured. Possibly the birds got
frightened when the gardener worked in the aviary and threw one
of the nestlings out.
" The young Quetzal, reared the previous nesting season, is still
being relentlessly persecuted by its parents. On Friday, 2nd May,
they bit it almost to death. I took it out, did my best to cure it, but
found it dead the following day. I had made the mistake of putting
it back in the aviary. Even when it was lying dead on the ground
the female would swoop furiously down on it.
" On 12 th May, 1941, this season's young Quetzal could be seen
at the nest hole. It left the nest on 18th May, early in the morning.
Male and female re-entered the empty nest several times that day."
On discussing the birds' performance Senora Zeledon said she
believed she knew why the Quetzals waited two years before nesting.
She thought the wood in the tree trunk was too hard and they could
not work it and shape it to their liking. In 1942 she had the old tree
trunk replaced but no attempt at breeding was made, the wood
probably again being too hard.
I measured the old trunk and found it to have a diameter of about
12 to 13 inches. The nesting hollow was approximately 9 inches in
diameter. At the bottom was a shallow cup hollowed out, leaving
a rim all around of a width of about 2 inches. The lower rim of the
entrance hole, almost 5 inches in diameter, was about 6 inches from
the rim of the cup.
Any future attempt at breeding should take into consideration the
condition of the log, which should be so well rotted throughout that
bits can be pried off with the fingernail, and should have an entrance
hole and nesting cavity smaller than the measurements given above.
The birds will accommodate it to their liking themselves. It would
also be a good plan to wet the log thoroughly from the outside, with
a hose, daily, to reproduce natural conditions.
Quetzals breed in cloud forests which are dripping wet almost the
year around. While in Costa Rica I found two nests at an altitude of
4,000 feet. One was located deep in the cloud forest in a tree stump
about 15 feet tall, so rotten that it swayed when a finger was pressed

against it. The diameter of the stump was at most 9 inches, which
goes to show that occasionally the Quetzal takes to cramped quarters.
The entrance hole was about 12 feet from the ground. I caught the
male, who was brooding inside, by walking noiselessly up to the nest
and covering the hole with a butterfly net on a short pole. This was
in the month of June.
The second nest was situated in an enormous tree trunk, charred
by fire and standing in a clearing. The entrance hole was a good
20 feet from the ground. The native who climbed up to it risked his
neck by doing so. The nest was deep. He brought up two eggs, the
size of pigeon's eggs, uniformly blue in colour. He replaced them but
the birds abandoned the site. The natives said that they invariably
do this when the eggs have been touched.
At first I thought the Quetzal lives in association with the Great
Woodpecker, whose abandoned nest he would take over and accom-
modate to his liking, but later I was not so sure of this. Quetzals
breed up to 10,000 feet and at the higher levels the big Woodpecker
is not found, being replaced by a medium-sized Woodpecker, so that
the Quetzal would have to accommodate a much smaller nest.
Despite the Quetzal's diminutive feet and short bill, he must be
a good carpenter. I once observed in Guatemala a Red-bellied
Trogon hollowing out, with feet and bill, an occupied termite nest,
and these are quite hard.

NOTES
A Long-lived Rufous-bellied Thrush
I thought it might be of interest to put on record a few particulars of a very old

friend, who has just died. My Rufous-bellied Thrush ( T. rufiventer or ? fumigatus)
was, I understand, one of the first if not the first of his species to be bred in captivity
in England. He was hatched in my friend's (the late H. V. Johnson) aviary at
Formby, Lancs, on 29th July, 1926, he died at the ripe old age of 17 years and 5 weeks,
on 8th September, 1943, and was in perfect health to within a few days of his death.
During the seventeen years I had him he has lived outdoors, among a varying collection
of both Foreign and British birds. He had no special diet and very little live insect
food, except what he was able to find for himself in the aviary. He was a fine singer
and very well behaved towards his aviary companions, which over his long sojourn
with me, consisted of a large variety of birds, from small Finches upwards. It is with
a real sense of loss that I report his u passing on ".
