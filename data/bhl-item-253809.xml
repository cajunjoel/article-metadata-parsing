CALIFORNIAN QUAIL
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.94610506060606" page_id="56317648"  page_num="1" year="" vol="">
(Callipepla californica)
By Philip Wayre (Great Witchingham, Norfolk, England)
This quail has done exceptionally well in captivity and is therefore
the best known of its group, which includes the Plumed or Mountain
Quail {Callipepla picta), Gambel's Quail [Callipepla gambeli), Douglas's
Quail ( Callipepla douglasi), Scaled Quail ( Callipepla squamata), and
Banded Quail [Callipepla fasciata). All these species are found in the
western United States and in Mexico.
While the range of the Californian Quail extends, as its name
suggests, over most of California, it is such a popular game bird that
it has been introduced into many other parts of the United States,
New Zealand, and Chile. It is a bird of arid country, living in the
valleys and on the lower slopes of mountains wherever there is sufficient
vegetation.
The most attractive feature of this bird is the male's headdress of
long black spatulate feathers hanging forward like the plumes on some
old-fashioned military helmets. Its voice is also quite attractive and
varies from a quiet clicking sound like two small pebbles being tapped
together to a loud whistle of three syllables, something like " let me in ",
repeated frequently.
These birds thrive in captivity provided they are kept dry and free
from draughts. They hate damp ground and need a warm shelter in
winter. Unlike most quail they are fond of perching quite high off the
ground, especially to roost at night, and several perches should there-
fore be provided in their quarters. It is unlikely that this quail would
survive our winters if turned down and even less likely that it would
successfully rear its chicks in our wet climate.
The hens lay large clutches of eggs which are relatively pointed and
attractively coloured, being a rich mottled brown. Quite often they
fail to rear their chicks in captivity and it has been found best in the
Trust's collection to collect all the eggs and hatch them in a still-air
incubator. They are not difficult to hatch and the tiny young are then
removed to a " Cotswold " type partridge brooder in which heat is

provided by an electrical rubber pad under which there is just
room for the chicks to creep so that the warm pad is actually
touching their backs. It must be raised as the chicks grow.
They thrive on a diet of very small pheasant starter crumbs with a
little grated yolk of hard-boiled egg and finely-chopped lettuce for the
first few days. If the crumbs seem too large to start with they can
easily be ground smaller by rubbing between two ordinary bricks.
Breeding birds do well on a similar diet of crumbs with a little millet
and canary seed fed several times per week.

REPORT OF THE COUNCIL, 1963
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.996861821428571" page_id="56317650"  page_num="3" year="" vol="">
Most members will already have heard with sorrow of the death of
David Seth-Smith last November at the age of eighty-nine. He was
one of our founder Trustees and until recently had always taken the
chair at meetings of Council. His guidance and advice during the
formation of the Trust was invaluable and when he was no longer able
to attend meetings he was missed by everyone.
Since its formation four years ago the Trust's work has been
hampered by the difficulty of obtaining quarantine quarters for birds
it wished to import. Various zoos have generously provided these
facilities from time to time but very often their quarters are full of their
own importations. It is thus very gratifying to be able to report that
as a result of strenuous efforts by Lord Bessborough, the Ministry of
Agriculture has agreed in principle to the Trust having its own
quarantine station subject to certain conditions.
It is hoped that a suitable site will be found within the city of
Norwich and that building will be started during 1964. Your Council
is extremely grateful to Lord Bessborough for all the trouble he took
to present the Trust's case so successfully.
The erection of quite a small wooden building, with the necessary
services in the form of light and water, will cost a considerable sum
and Council will be most grateful to any member who is willing to
contribute towards this expense. It is hoped that it will be possible
to quarantine birds for members so long as the number of requests for
this service does not become excessive.
In January a firm of local millers applied to the Norfolk County
Council for planning permission to build a large concrete mill, with
a tower 70 feet high, at the top of the hill overlooking the Trust and
the Norfolk Wildlife Park. This proposal was turned down by the

Rural District Council and planning permission was refused by the
County Council.

The applicants appealed to the Minister of Housing and Local
Government, who ordered a public inquiry to be held in East Dereham
on 18th September.
During the proceedings the Hon. Secretary wrote to the Minister
setting out the Trust's reasons for objecting to the scheme. Most helpful
letters supporting our objection were sent to the Minister by a number
of national bodies including the Avicultural Society, the World Wild-
life Fund, the Council for Nature, the International Council for Bird
Preservation, the Zoological Society of London, and a number of
private individuals. Council is most grateful to all who rallied in
support of the Trust, which was represented at the public inquiry by
the Hon. Director and by Mr. Nigel Bridge who is recognized as the
leading Counsel in planning matters.

The Minister has recently made known his decision to dismiss the
applicants' appeal and in his report the Inspector said his recom-
mendation was strongly reinforced by the presence of the Ornamental
Pheasant Trust and the Norfolk Wildlife Park close to the appeal site.
On 30th May, Professor Bennet-Clarke, Dean of the Biological
Faculty of the University of East Anglia, lunched at the Trust and
discussed the possibility of co-operation between University and Trust
in research. He felt the University would be pleased to make use of
the facilities which the Trust could provide and hoped that both
bodies would benefit from the association.
On 17th July some twenty members of the Avicultural Society
visited the collection as guests of the Hon. Director and Mrs. Wayre.
Having looked round the Norfolk Wildlife Park they were entertained
to tea and to sherry in the evening after being shown round the
Trust's breeding pens and rearing lawn by the Hon. Director.
Negotiations continue for the return of a number of Swinhoe's
Pheasants, bred in the collection, to Taiwan where they are to be
released to reinforce the depleted wild stock of this species. The
Taiwan authorities have now intimated that they are considering the
creation of a National Park or Reserve in which the birds will be
released and have asked that in the meantime they may remain in the
Trust's care.
The joint co-ordinating committee of the World Wildlife Fund/ ]
International Union for the Conservation of Nature/International
Council for Bird Preservation has written an " influence letter " of
encouragement and support to the Taiwan authorities in favour of the
Trust's project.
It is hoped that when the birds are finally shipped the World
Wildlife Fund will be able to contribute towards the cost of the air
freight.
On 24th September, a party was given in London by Mr. Norman
Collins, Chairman of Associated Television, in honour of H.R.H. The
Prince of the Netherlands. The Hon. Director and Mrs. Wayre met
Prince Bernhard, who is President of the World Wildlife Fund, and
were pleased to find that both he and his aide , Colonel Geertsema, were
very interested in the Trust's work and the Prince expressed a wish to
visit the collection one day.
The Trust has been informed by Messrs. J. Rank, producers of
Blue Cross Poultry Foods, that as from April, 1964, they will no longer
be able to continue their annual grant of ^300-worth of free feeding
stuffs in return for the display of their advertising boards. This will
be a substantial blow to the Trust's income, especially as the cost of
feeding the Trust's birds far exceeds this figure.
Once again, at the request of the Royal Norfolk Agricultural
Association, a Wildlife Exhibit was staged at the Royal Norfolk Show

on 26th and 27th June. Although this exhibit was primarily the
concern of the Norfolk Wildlife Park, a section was devoted to a display
from the Trust and included Himalayan Monal, Silver and Yellow
Golden Pheasants. In addition, the Trust's literature was available
and 2,000 leaflets were distributed.
The President, M. Jean Delacour, visited Great Witchingham on
10th June and once again showed his interest in the Trust's work and
put forward many helpful suggestions.
Mr. R. E. Moreau, President of the British Ornithologists' Union,
is continuing his research into the taxonomic relationship between
Common Quail (Coturnix c. coturnix) and Japanese Quail (Coturnix c.
japonica ). As part of this work the Trust has successfully bred thirty-five
j hybrids of these sub-species, some Common X Japanese and some
Japanese X Common Quail. In addition, a number of recordings of
Quail calls were made by the Hon. Director for Mr. Moreau.
During the past eighteen months the general public has taken a far
greater interest in Ornamental Pheasants than hitherto. This trend
has resulted in a large increase in the number of inquiries received by
the Trust. Most of them have been from people wishing to buy birds
for their private collections and it seems a pity that generally speaking
only half a dozen species are regularly offered by breeders, out of a
total of 150 forms known to science.
It is hoped that this enthusiasm will result in much larger numbers
of some of the rarer pheasants being bred in captivity, for only by this
means will the rare ones be saved from extinction in the long run.
It is not enough that they should be bred only in the Trust's collection
and for this reason it has always been the Council's aim to sell surplus
young stock to members as soon as a reasonably safe nucleus of
breeding birds has been built up. This year, for the first time, the
Trust has been in a position to dispose of a few pairs of such species
as Koklass and Blue Eared Pheasants and Tonkinese Red Jungle Fowl
to members.
It is understandable, though unfortunate, that most breeders desire
to acquire a collection composed of as many species as possible. This
is the natural inclination of the collector rather than the breeder and
in most instances little or no breeding success is achieved. Such
collections are expensive to maintain and derive little in return from
the sale of young stock. It is to be hoped that more pheasant collectors
will become pheasant breeders, specializing in two or three of the rarer
forms. When it is remembered that ten breeding pairs of one species
is generally assumed to be the minimum safe breeding nucleus, it will
be appreciated that even this number of species involves the keeping
of quite a large number of breeding birds. If only this could be
achieved breeders would be making a really valuable contribution
towards saving rare pheasants from extinction.

In this connection the Trust will continue to concentrate on building
up numbers of those species at present scarce in captivity. As each
becomes established a nucleus will be maintained and emphasis laid
on the next form to be increased.

At the time of writing this report the Trust has sixty breeding pens
containing pairs or trios of pheasants, and this number does not include
odd birds, nor pairs of partridge, francolin, quail, etc. Of the sixty
breeding pens, thirteen contain species common in captivity, Silver,
Reeves's, Golden (including yellow mutation), and Lady Amherst's
pheasants.
The Trust's collection now consists of 387 birds of forty-six forms
excluding mutations. The following is a list of birds in the collection
at 1 st December, 1963 :--

A total of 340 young birds of seventeen species was bred in the
collection this year. This is the best result so far achieved and much
of the credit must go to Roy Grout of the Norfolk Wildlife Park, who,
through his keenness and enthusiasm, successfully reared this number.
Infertility continues to be the greatest single problem in building up
numbers of many species, and it is always most prevalent in birds bred
from many generations of captive stock. Perhaps the greatest achieve-
ment this year was the breeding of two young Mikado Pheasants from
the wild-caught hen sent direct from Taiwan last year and generously
donated to the Trust by Mr. John Swain. Both young birds appear to
be females and with any luck should help to re-establish this rare
species which is so close to extinction in the wild.
As will be seen from the analysis which follows, both Common
Koklass and Blue Eared pheasants bred well. The former looks like
becoming established in Britain for the first time, and it will be
remembered that it was only two years ago that the Trust bred the
first Common Koklass in this country.
The wild-caught imported Tonkinese Red Junglefowl have settled
down and bred successfully, producing twelve young this year. Since
virtually all the other Red Junglefowl in captivity in this country are
impure, this success will help to establish a pure strain.
For the third year running three Cabot's Tragopan were reared
from the original pair sent by Dr. K. C. Searle and once again all
appear to be hens. Cyprus Rock Partridge bred in the collection for
the first time. These handsome birds are similar to French Partridges
only larger and more brightly coloured. It is essential to provide these
birds with rocks and stones in their pen to prevent excessive growth
of the upper mandible.
The hatching of the Trust's eggs has been greatly facilitated due to
the construction by the Norfolk Wildlife Park of a large range of broody
nest-boxes and feeding cages which are entirely under cover. This
arrangement has proved very successful and labour-saving. Apart from
anything else both the staff and the birds remain dry in wet weather.
Samples of egg white from infertile eggs have again been sent to
Cornell University, U.S.A., to help Professor Sibley in his research into
the taxonomic relationship of birds by means of electrophoresis of
egg-white protein.

ORNAMENTAL PHEASANT TRUST-ANNUAL REPORT
NOTES FROM THE NORFOLK WILDLIFE PARK
By Philip Wayre
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.996199536585366" page_id="56317657"  page_num="10" year="" vol="">
Despite rather a wet summer this year over 63,000 people visited
the Park during the first twelve months it was open. As members
of the Ornamental Pheasant Trust will know, a representative selection
of the Trust's breeding birds is on show within the Park in twenty-nine
large pens, many of which are planted with shrubs appropriate to the
part of the world from which the birds themselves originate.
The recently constructed pheasant lawn is beginning to appeal to
visitors, who are able to wander freely amongst a mixed collection
of nearly a hundred cock pheasants of nine species. When all are in
full plumage the riot of colour is sensational, more especially as the
whole enclosure has been attractively planted with flowering trees and
shrubs. An area has been separated by rustic rails at each end, thus
providing two refuges for the birds where they can get away from people
and where they are fed and watered.
Over 170 ducks and geese of twenty-nine forms were bred in the
Park during the year. A number of geese have been left full-winged,
including Grey Lag, Blue Snow, and Barnacle ; the sight of them
flying round is a source of constant pleasure to visitors. Unfortunately
the Grey Lag may have to be caught up and feather-clipped before next
breeding season as they are inclined to attack other breeding pairs.
A new innovation is the wader pool, which is currently being im-
proved in the light of experience. This is a smallish enclosure made to
represent a pool in the sand-dunes of the north Norfolk coast. Artificial
dunes have been planted with Sea Lyme Grass (Elymus arenarius) which
was brought from the coast. This looks rather like Marram-grass
(Psamma arenaria) but, unlike the latter, it will grow in stable soil.
Tree Lupin (Lupinus arboreus) and Sea-buckthorn (.Hippophae rhamnoides )
have been planted round the edges, while a shingle spit of beach
shingle and scattered oyster and mussel shells complete the effect. The
waders in the enclosure are all pinioned and include Common and
Stone Curlew, Oyster-catcher, Green Plover, and Redshank. Pairs of
Common Shelduck and Wigeon share the pool and artificial burrows
have been constructed in the dunes for the Shelduck. When completed
the public will be able to walk through the enclosure and will be
separated from the birds by a single rail. It is hoped that some of the
waders will breed freely under these conditions ; courtship display has
already been observed in Stone Curlew and Oyster-catchers.
It is part of our policy to display both birds and mammals whenever
possible in surroundings similar to their natural habitat. Not only
is the result far more pleasing from the aesthetic sense, but it has far
greater educational value.

Next to the wader enclosure is a small shallow lagoon planted with
shrubs and reeds (Phragmites sp.) The Pool has been clayed to provide
nesting material for the Flamingos which share the enclosure with
Spoonbills. For the latter a fallen bough at the edge of the water
provides natural perching space. The birds are, of course, pinioned.
Perhaps one of our most popular exhibits is the walk-through
aviary. A darkened porch at each end gives access to the wide gravel
path running down the centre of the enclosure. The whole area
inside has been landscaped, two rocky pools made, and banks of
rhododendrons and other shrubs planted. The effect is a most attrac-
tive wild garden in which many kinds of British birds fly freely.
During the summer over twenty species were exhibited in this way and
it was interesting to hear the comments of people who, unfamiliar with
our native birds, were able to see such species as Goldfinches, Bull-
finches, and Redstarts at really close quarters yet virtually unconfined.
It is unlikely that successful breeding will take place in such a mixed
collection but a number of planted aviaries have been built nearby for
individual pairs of British and European birds.
Both Eagle-Owls and Snowy Owls made attempts at breeding.
The Snowy Owls laid four eggs, the first on Whit Sunday in a shallow
scrape against the wire of the outside flight of their aviary. A screen
of wattle hurdles was hastily erected to shield the nest from the
public but the owl chose to lay the rest of her clutch in a dark corner
inside the shelter. Soon after hatching the owlets disappeared and were
apparently eaten by the female.
Little Owls laid eggs which were infertile, so perhaps they are not a
true pair.
Two nesting platforms were built for the White Storks, one only
4 feet high and the other 12 feet high, both reached by rough ladders.
Although the birds are pinioned one pair took possession of the
highest platform and were frequently seen displaying with much bill
clappering.
While our policy is to exhibit British and European birds and
mammals, a number of foreign species are also kept. Liberty Macaws
with headquarters in a fallen tree are always a draw, as are a mixed
colony of Laughing Thrushes in a large planted aviary and a pair of
Rheas bred at Frankfurt Zoo and now sharing a large enclosure with
Cereopsis Geese and wallabies.
The parrakeets have not had a successful breeding season ; all four
pairs of Pennant's laid and one pair reared their four young to within a
week or so of fledging, when they were suddenly found dead in the nest
for no apparent reason. The Stanley's managed to rear a solitary
youngster.
Our bird of prey collection has recently been increased by the
arrival of a fine pair of Booted Eagles and a Griffon Vulture from

Spain. The latter is exceptionally blonde for a Griffon and for some
reason was promptly christened Mandy by our staff !
The tame birds of prey are put out on their blocks on the hawk lawn
during the daytime ; all are trained to fly loose and the Bateleur Eagle
is often flown in the Park itself. She is the best performer of all the
eagles and in warm weather will soar to a height of several hundred
feet over the heads of visitors before stooping to land on the lure.
Unfortunately Bokhara, the male Golden Eagle, has to be flown out-
side the Park owing to his habit of attacking the pinioned waterfowl !
Over twenty-five nest-boxes for small birds and three for owls have
been put up in the Park. During the summer they were occupied by
Tawny Owls (one pair), Great Tits (one pair), Blue Tits (two pairs).
Tree Sparrow (one pair), House Sparrow (two pairs), and Pied Wag-
tail (one pair).

" TREATING 'EM ROUGH !"

By Norman McCange (Avonsleigh, Victoria, Australia)
Here on a mountain ridge 35 miles east of Melbourne, in a very
beautiful and secluded setting, I read in the Avicultural Magazine
of Jan.-Feb., 1962, about Mr. and Mrs. Milligan's " Methods of
Keeping Pheasants ". These aroused my indignation and general
displeasure, goading me to this protest.
Their " methods " are not only based on a vast amount of quite
unnecessary hard labour, but are calculated to deter, discourage, and
dissuade all who, as novices, contemplate keeping pheasants. That is
the burden of my complaint.
A good man and his wife worked seventy hours or more a week for
two months annually. Their standards of hygiene were ridiculous.
They scrubbed, or had scrubbed, every food and water-pot first thing
every morning. They cleared away droppings each day. They picked
up uneaten food each evening. They kept sixty-odd aviaries ready
for royal inspection. Was all this bother and fuss and scrubbing and
sweeping necessary ?
It was not ! It made what in Australia we would call " dam' hard
yakker " out of the pleasant routine of pheasant-keeping. So far from
the birds being all the better for this fussing and botheration, they
probably held indignation meetings about it. Especially about the
introduction of a rotoscythe into their homes !
Single-handed, for thirty years, I have maintained, for fun and
fancy, not for profit, quite successfully up to forty-five aviaries. I treat
the pheasants with the respect due to royal birds and interfere as little
as possible with their privacy. My best advertisement for " treating

'em rough " is their astonishing longevity and complete freedom from
disease.
The star attraction of the collection is my twenty-two year old Lady
Amherst's cock about to become a father once again, to judge by his
enthusiastic display. I went into his aviary the other day and said :
" Move over ! The Milligans in England say your pen should be
cleaned daily and it has not been swept or raked for nigh on twenty
years !"
I do not pick up food after it is distributed. I throw upon the ground
each morning a handful of warm mash at just that degree of moisture
which makes it crumble and spread as it hits the earth. Wheat in the
evening ; green-food whenever I think of it ; and shell-grit when I
remember.
They have very little shelter from rain, but ample protection from
strong winds which at this altitude of 1,000 feet reach ioo m.p.h. now
and again. But all the aviaries are thickly planted and covered with
creepers and shrubbery run wild. The birds seem to like this natural
sort of surrounding, and rain improves their plumage.
The time spent in feeding is about forty minutes in the morning and
half that time in the late afternoon. I admit that there is a risk in
leaving high-protein moist food lying about for more than twenty-four
hours, but this can be avoided by limiting the day's ration to the
consumers' capacity.
I will a secret formula impart that, as a factor in ensuring health,
long life, and iridescence, is worth far more than fussing about with
brooms and cleansing apparatus. By the way, did you ever know a
gallinaceous bird that did not prefer stale water to fresh ? Or food
off the ground rather than in little dishes ?
This formula has been used for my birds as a daily ration for the last
ten years and there is proof of its efficiency in hardening plumage ;
preventing perosis, which produces crooked toes ; and greatly lessening
the " dead-in-shell " chicks . It is recommended by our Department
of Agriculture.
Take of manganese (not magnesium) sulphate 4 oz. and mix with
10 lb. of table salt, very thoroughly. Dissolve this mixture in the hot
water of mash in proportion of one heaped dessertspoonful to 5 lb. of
dry grist. This is roughly 25 parts of manganese per million.
It is pure white magic, and the colours are enriched and polished
after a brief course of treatment. Try it.

This bird is found only in the mountainous parts of Borneo. Smythies
says that " its particular ecological niche is the leached out sandy
forest of the valley bottoms ". It also occurs in primary forest, but
is not so common there. It is said to have a habit of running along
tracks ahead of travellers, keeping to the path, and this renders it
easy to shoot. Harrisson says that it is easy to catch, but almost
impossible to keep alive. The food is said to be insects and berries.
The nest is built of dry leaves and situated on a tussock of grass or
lichen " in forest that is liable to flooding ". The eggs are buff-coloured
and smeared with darker brown, particularly at the larger end.
The sexes are much alike--crimson head, neck, and upper breast,
rather duller on the throat, rest of the plumage dark greyish-brown :
the longer under tail-coverts are broadly tipped with crimson and the
male has two spurs.

There are two races of M. nigra , the nominate one living in southern
parts of the Malay peninsula and in Sumatra and the other (M. n.
borneensis) in Borneo. The habitat of the Malayan bird is given as
dense jungle in the low country and up to 2,000 feet, usually where
there is much undergrowth ; the Bornean bird lives in primary
forest in the lowlands of southern and south-western parts. A coloured
plate may be seen in vol. 3 of The Birds of the Malay Peninsula , by
Robinson and Chasen. The male is glossy black, brownish on the
wings, and the female brown with black markings on the flanks and
back. The legs and feet are bluish-grey and a curious feature is the
nail-like claw of the hind toe. The Bornean race is described as " less
deep black with a slaty greenish tinge, the feathers of the upper side
having lighter and more slaty edges ". The female is of a deeper
chestnut-brown on the chest.
Three or four specimens of this species were brought by the late
W. J. C. Frost in about 1955, but what became of them is not known.

By Charles Everitt (Trenton, N. J., U.S.A.)
One of the smallest known Kingfishers, only about 5 inches in total
length of which more than an inch is made up of bill, the Pigmy King-
fisher --Ispidina picta picta --is to be found over a wide area in Africa.
North of the equator its habitat extends from the west coast, south of
the Sahara, through Nigeria and clear across to Ethiopia and Somali-
land. It also goes southward over the equator to Angola, through the
Congo and up into Kenya. A sub-species Ispidina p. natalensis, with
which we are now concerned, known as the Natal Kingfisher, carries
on down the east coast through Tanganyika, Mozambique, the
Rhodesias and the eastern parts of South Africa. Although so widely
distributed, they are not often seen in captivity out of their native
regions, owing to the difficulty of transporting them alive for they are
strictly live-food eaters, in the wild, and require regular feeding.
Mr. Boehm had seen the nominate race during his collector's trip
in Kenya in i960 but had not been fortunate enough to obtain any at
that time. Nevertheless, they were not to be forgotten and, eventually,
in June, 1961, a small consignment was received from Lourenco
Marques. I say small, for there were only three birds, two of which
were dead on arrival. The third had managed to survive on the
mealworms provided but, judging from the voracious way in which it
went for those offered to it in its cage, it would not have lasted much
longer. In March, 1962, a further batch of eight was received from the
same source, this time all alive. They were fairly young birds, some of
their bills not being completely out of the immature black phase. The
eight of them, plus the original bird, were put in one of the pens in the
main bird house. Four were later presented to the Bronx Zoo, the
remaining five living together quite amicably. The diet they now
thrived on was mealworms, strips of raw beef heart and live minnows.
The latter were placed in a shallow pan of water for the birds to dive
into and fish out for themselves.
The sexes are alike in coloration, the forehead and crown being
deep violet-blue with light blue barrings. The violet-blue colouring
extends through the mantle, wings, rump, and tail, the under-parts
being rich rufous. This rufous shade is evident also in a superciliary
stripe reaching to the nape of the neck. The ear-coverts and cheeks are
mauve except for a patch below the ear, the upper portion of which is
violet-blue, the lower part being white. They have a throat patch of
white and the bill, legs, and feet are bright orange. The difference in
the sexes lies in the shape of the lower mandible, that of the female
being more keel-shaped than that of the male.
Careful thought was given to the breeding of these little beauties for

I 6 CHARLES EVERITT-BREEDING THE NATAL KINGFISHER
Mr. Boehm realized that special provisions would have to be made for
them. With this sole object in view, the aviaries shown as numbers 14
to 18 on the plan in A.M. i960 (113) were stripped down and recon-
structed into one single flight of some 60 by 16 feet, the height being
increased to 20 feet. Across twelve feet of the lower end, against the
bird-house wall, an earth embankment, 3 feet wide and 2 high, was
erected. It was held in position by 2 by 1 inch wire, faced with cement.
In this facing, holes, 4 by 2 inches, were made through the cement and
inner wiring so as to expose the bare earth beyond. The top of the
bank was planted with azaleas and various shrubs to bind the earth
together. In addition, a shallow pool with continuous running water
was installed, and the entire aviary was replanted with trees and shrubs,
the task being completed in April 1963.
In May it was decided that the weather was sufficiently settled to
permit birds being transferred from their winter quarters, and the
following pairs were released into this aviary :--Lesser Niltavas,
Black-chinned Wren Babblers, Crimson Chats, Red-headed Tits,
Yellow-billed Chlorophonias and the five Natal Kingfishers, which
were then known to consist of three males and two females. Sub-
sequently a pair of Eastern Bearded Reedlings were added to this 1
collection. To assist in the identification of each bird for the daily
check, they all bore coloured leg bands, those allotted to the King-
fisher males being blue, orange, and green. The females were banded
red, and white, the latter colour being assigned to the bird originally
received in 1961.
As is the case with the majority of outdoor aviaries, we were blessed
with a goodly following of field mice so, when scrapings and small holes j
began to be made in the exposed earth patches in the face of the em-
bankment, little attention was paid to it at first. However, at one
early morning check, on 10th June, to be precise, a Kingfisher was
missing. A thorough search was made with the dreadful fear that one
might have reached an untimely end. With the aid of an electric
hand-torch, the holes in the face of the bank were examined. It was in
the sixth, the furthest from the entrance door to the aviary, that the j
little feathered jewel was located. What a relief, and what a thrill. All
that could be seen of it was its head at the end of a tunnel, about
20 inches long, that obviously dipped down at the end. The passage
was perfectly straight, a great asset from the viewpoint of making
regular observations of the nesting.
The next task was to ascertain which of the Kingfishers it was, and
a check of the band colours revealed that the bird in the nest was the
white banded female. Later in the same morning, this bird was seen on
a branch overhanging the pool and a quick look into the nest showed
that there was another bird in there. A further " band " check pin-
pointed the " blue " Kingfisher as being the new occupant. The days

following proved this conclusively for " blue " or " white " was always
perched in close proximity to the nest hole and it was observed that a
change over was made every 2 hours or so, at least during the day.
The incubation period lasted eighteen days for, on 28th June, one
of the parent birds was seen to fly into the nest with a small minnow in
its bill. It made this trip four times in fairly quick succession, not being
in the nest for more than about 15 seconds at any one time. A look into
the burrow showed nothing but the head and upper breast of an adult
bird and it was not until the sixth day that two little bald heads were
first seen endeavouring to get out of the beam of the torch. As with the
incubation, the feeding of the young was shared and it became apparent
that none of the food taken to the nest was for other than the nestlings,
for, as soon as the change-over by the parents was effected, the bird
vacating the nest promptly had a good meal itself. They did not appear
to discriminate in the food they fed for they were seen to take minnows,
mealworms, meat strips and crickets, plus an occasional moth they
might catch. In the early days, the fish they selected for the nestlings
were small but, as time progressed, they were observed taking fish of
2 to 2 J inches in length, and spending no more time with the feeding
than they did with the smaller ones. A careful study of their feeding
showed that they fed the young birds about 8 courses every hour.
It became easy to know when they were going to eat a fish themselves
or feed it to the young for, once they had snatched it out of the pool,
their method of killing it appeared to differ. If for their own con-
sumption, they held it across the bill by the head when knocking it on
branch to stun it and then, with a deft flick, transferred it lengthwise so
that the fish's head was in their bill, swallowing it thus, head first.
When it was caught for feed for the young, they held the fish towards
the tail crosswise in their bill, killing it in the same manner as described
above. This time, however, the flick transferred the fish tail first into
their bill, leaving the head protruding. When it came to the larger
sized fish, they looked rather grotesque as they flew off with about ij
inches of fish sticking out in front of them.
On the tenth day, 2 soiled eggs, clear, were found on the ground
below the entrance to the nest and it was from these that the following
data was obtained. Pure white, almost round, measuring 16 by 14 mm.
From the twelfth day on, both parents spent most of the day out of the
nest, making their hourly trips with feed, and it was normal for each
bird to make 4 or 5 sortees at a session. The nestlings were now
feathering up and the bright violet-blue of the head and the rufous
under-parts were clearly visible in the light of the torch. It was on
16th July, at eighteen days old, that they finally vacated the nest.
Except for the general colouring being softer, the bills shorter and
black in colour, the fledglings were replicas of their parents. As during
the nesting time, the adults continued to share in the feeding of the

young birds, one of which was seen to make an ineffective dive towards
the fish pool within hours of leaving the nest. They became inde-
pendent relatively quickly, for, by 21st July, they were selecting food
for themselves, although they still accepted tid-bits from either parent.
During this period the other three adults spent most of the time at the
far end of the aviary, making secretive raids on the minnow pool and
the cricket box whenever the coast was clear. On 23rd July, fresh
scrapings of earth were seen below the entrance to the old nest and a
quick look showed that there was a bird in there. A check revealed
that it was the same female and male involved and, from this second
round, one more chick was subsequently reared to independence. It
seemed that once again four eggs comprised the clutch for three, all
clear, were rolled out of the nest prior to the nestling leaving. Even this
family of three does not appear to satisfy them for, as I am writing
this, they are sitting once more.
The other three adults appear to have paired up for " green 55 and
" red " are always together, leaving the " orange " male as the odd
man out. However, they have shown no signs of going to nest yet.
Maybe the female is too young for she was the last one of the 1962
birds to obtain the clear orange bill of an adult. Now that Mr. Boehm
has bred them and has full records regarding their age, it should be
possible to ascertain at exactly what age they do acquire complete
adult colouring. Further information on this will be given in due
course. In the meantime, if anyone has had previous experience with
the breeding of this species, details of any data they garnered would be
appreciated.

The sight of a Fairy Blue Bird male flying in a sunlit aviary is one
of the most attractive in the realms of aviculture. The brilliant ultra-
marine-blue, with its pinkish sheen, of the crown, neck, back, lesser
wing-coverts and under tail-coverts contrast so sharply with the velvety
black of the remainder of its plumage. The bill, legs, and feet are black
but the iris is a brilliant red, another striking contrast to the black of
the face. The female is much more subdued, being basically peacock-
blue with brownish-black wings and tail. The two central tail feathers
have a tinge of ultramarine, as do the tips of the two pairs of feathers
each side thereof. The greenish-blue feathers of the back have dark
shafts, which gives an impression of the feathering being streaked. As
with the male, the bill, legs, and feet are black, but the iris is orange to
reddish-brown. They are about 11 inches in total length.

There is still a certain amount of doubt as to the correct family to
which these birds should be allocated for, although skeletal structure
leans towards that of the Orioles, the Oriolidae family, the similarity
is not borne out so far as breeding habits are concerned. Most of the
true Orioles build a deep cup-shaped nest, suspended high from a fork
at the slender end of a branch, and the incubation period is from six-
teen to eighteen days. The Fairy Blue Birds, however, build open cup-
shaped nests and have a much shorter period of incubation, some
thirteen days only. Further, young of the Orioles are covered initially
with light coloured down, white in many instances, whereas those of
the Fairy Blue Birds are dark. These characteristics tie them up closer
with the Ioras , genus Aegithina, and the Fruit-suckers, genus Chloropsis
and, therefore, the Fairy Blue Birds, genus Irena , generally are regarded
as one of the three groups making up the family Aegithinidae.
The nominate race, Irena puella puella y is to be found in the north-
eastern parts of India and Burma, but the range of the genus extends as
far south as Ceylon and eastwards through Thailand, Vietnam, and
Malaysia. Further, there are races to be found in the Phillipines,
Indonesia, Borneo, the Andamans, and the Nicobars. Variations in
size, colouring, feathering, etc., occur throughout their wide distribu-
tion and they have all been recognized as sub-species of the nominate
race.
Mr. Boehm always desired at least one pair of these beautiful birds
to grace his aviaries with but, until late 1961, had not been able to
obtain a true female, all the purported females eventually showing
themselves to be young males. At that time, however, it seemed fairly
certain that at last he had three males and six females. Early in 1962
the three pairs were transferred to planted aviaries, one pair to each,
but one male became the victim of a rat thus reducing the stock to two
pairs and four females. These latter birds were later disposed of, as
the accommodation they were occupying was required for some new
arrivals of other species.
It was not until 1963 that either pair showed signs of going to nest,
and then it was the pair in a 30 by 20 ft. aviary, which they shared with
a pair each of Natal Robins and Bronzy Sunbirds, that made a move in
this direction. The female began building an open, cup-shaped nest of
coarse grasses and fine twigs, lined with fine grasses and dog's hair, in a
hemlock tree close to one side of the aviary. At the same time the Sun-
bird female started to build in a crab-apple tree on the extreme
opposite side. Having no information on the behaviour of Fairy Blue
Birds during nesting time in captivity and, wishing to avoid any
interference by one family to the other, it was decided to split the
aviary in two with a Visqueen drop-sheet, thus giving each nesting
pair an area of 16 by 20 feet. The Natal Robins were left in the Sun-
birds' side of the aviary.

The Fairy Blue Birds nest was very thrush-like in its general structure
and appearance, although no mud, an intregal ingredient of most
thrushes nests, was used by the female, who completed the nest on her
own. About three days were occupied with this task, the male just
standing by challenging the world with his short, sharp, and loud
whistling. The first egg of three was laid on 28th June, the others
following on each of the next two days. They were fair-sized eggs, 28 by
21 mm., with a ground colour of greenish-white, heavily blotched,
spotted and mottled in reddish-brown and grey, in some parts almost
obscuring the basic colour. As with the nest building, the incubating
was carried out by the female only and, on nth July, the first chick
hatched. There was a second the following day but the third egg was
clear and it was removed, thus enabling the above data on size and
colouring to be obtained.
The nestlings were pink skinned, thickly covered with nigger-brown
fluff, and had pink gapes, margined in white. There was a single black
spot in the centre of the inside of both the upper and lower mandibles.
Their development on a pure live-food diet of crickets, mealworms,
moths, and any other insects the parents might forage, was rapid, their
eyes being open and quills showing in the wings at four days old. The
male certainly began to make up for all his idling now for, although he
whistled whenever he had the chance, he was most attentive to the
young birds, continously going to and fro with food. The female fed
also but, as she did all the brooding of them in the nest, a considerable
amount of her spare time was spent in feeding herself, bathing ,and
preening. At nine days old their backs were completely feathered,
the wings being blackish-brown, the remainder of the upper parts
being bluish.
Their heads, however, were the last to be feathered and, when they
left the nest at thirteen days old, their heads were but a mass of pen
feathers. Although it seemed a little premature for such fair-sized
birds to fledge, they were comparatively strong on the wing and soon
selected perching sites from which they kept up an incessant cry for
food. Now the male worked harder than ever, the female just lending a
" bill " now and again as the pace got too much for him. She appeared
to adopt an attitude of complacency as if she felt that she had done her
part with the nest-building, egg-laying, incubating, and brooding of the
nestlings. If their growth in the nest had seemed rather swift, their
development once they had fledged was even more so for, at four
weeks old, they were completely feathered, similar colouring to the
adult female, and were about 9 inches in length.
Independency, however, seemed to be another thing, for they
were nearly six weeks old before they were seen to collect live-food for
themselves. Their diet on leaving the nest had been enlarged by the
male, for he then began to feed them fruit and ground raw beef as well

as live-food. Whenever the female did feed them she kept to the live-
food.
On 20th August the female laid again, three eggs as before, so the
young birds were caught up and removed to the cage room to confirm
that they were in fact self-supporting. This became apparent very
soon, as they cleared up all their food, fruit, ground raw beef, egg-
mixture, and a liberal amount of mealworms. They were then released
into an aviary, away from their parent, so that they could attain full
maturity under the most ideal conditions. It had been noticed that
the blue in the back of one of them seemed to be a little brighter than
the other, and it is wondered if this may be an early sex indicator. As
they were both banded with different-coloured leg-bands, close
observation is being kept on their development so as to obtain con-
firmation or otherwise on this point.
The second round followed the same pattern of events as the first,
even to the fact that the third egg was clear, and the two chicks vacated
the nest on ist and 2nd September, respectively. Unfortunately one of
them selected a roosting perch below a concealed split in the plastic
roof covering and became drenched during a heavy rainstorm one
night, from which it caught a chill and died later in the day. The
survivor, however, progressed as well as the first-round birds had and
this also appeared to have a fairly bright blue back and gave vent to
short, sharp calls, as did the older bird of the same colouring. It may
be that two males and one female Fairy Blue Bird have been reared
at the Boehm aviaries, but confirmation of this will have to wait for
some time yet. However, as soon as definite sex indications are detected,
a further report on those changes will be made for the information of
all those interested.

Bubulcus ibis , also known as Ardeola ibis , has in recent years attracted
attention by reason of its remarkable extension of range. The nominate

22 J. J. YEALLAND-THE BREEDING OF THE AFRICAN CATTLE EGRET
record of the breeding of the African Cattle Egret (Buff-backed Heron
or Tick Bird) relates to the Giza Zoo, Cairo, in 1911.
In Regent's Park these Egrets spend the summer in the Great Aviary,
being brought into the Eastern Aviary for the winter. In the Great
Aviary there are high privet bushes and an even higher elder bush, this
being the favourite nesting place. In recent years nesting has taken
place and young sometimes hatched, but it was not until the summer of
1962 that success was achieved, one chick being fully reared. The nest,
a scanty platform of twigs, was built high up in the elder and there were
other nests near by, as is natural with these colonial breeders--indeed,
it may be that all the squabbling and general activity of the colony
provide the necessary stimulus for breeding.
The number of eggs laid in the nests is not known ; the incubation
period is said to be between twenty-one and twenty-four days. For
some time before the chick was able to fly it walked unsteadily about
the branches around the nest.
The food of the wild birds consists of grasshoppers, ticks, large
insects and their larvae, small frogs, and lizards. The birds derive their
name from the association with cattle, which disturb grasshoppers in
the course of grazing and no doubt also provide the ticks and attract
flies. In Africa wherever the grass is cut by machete, the Egrets have
learned to gather round people so engaged, but they evidently trust the
human being less than the cattle or wild animals, for they keep a
respectful distance in their watch for disturbed grasshoppers.
The Cattle Egrets here feed on pieces of fish (herring, sprats, or
whiting) and raw, lean meat. Other food is put into this aviary of a
variety of birds, but I feel sure that the Egrets do not take it, though
they do catch flies. When the first chick was hatched we tried fixing a
food tin on the outside of the aviary near the nest, the object being to
provide mealworms, maggots, and locusts which only the Egrets could
reach through the large mesh of the aviary wire-netting, but the birds
were so disturbed whenever the food was put there (for it meant some-
one going up on steps to do it) that we were afraid the chick might fall
from the nest, so the well-meant scheme proved impracticable.
Early this summer the birds built several nests in the bushes and
some eggs were laid, but then the colony was deserted and I suspect
some interference from Gallinules in the same aviary, who built a nest
of their own close by. Later the Egrets started again and now (October)
another chick is walking about the bushes.
In the 1930s some of the Indian Cattle Egrets were released (with
clipped wings) each summer at Whipsnade and in autumn, when the
birds had moulted, they flew away. There is no record that they ever
bred there.

By (Mrs.) W. Boorer (London, England)
These birds were sold to me in June, 1962, as Blue-winged Parrotlets.
j As I was a novice and these were the first pair of birds that I had
bought, I did not question the identification, and it is only recently
that I found out that what I really have is a pair of Celestial Parrotlets.
They were first housed in a wire cage and I spent a lot of time trying to
tame them, with no appreciable result. They were then transferred to a
4 ft. box cage in my small kitchen and, in this rather unlikely environ-
ment, with the radio balanced on top of the cage and three young
children milling round the front, they hatched a clutch of six in 1963.
The following observations are fairly detailed as the birds were more or
less constantly under my eye.

These birds are about inches long and mainly bright green in
colour. The cock bird has a light blue streak behind each eye and the
bright green of his head becomes dulled with a greyish tinge over his
back. His most noticeable and beautiful feature is the brilliant indigo
of the primaries, secondaries, under wing-coverts, and rump. The hen
has much fainter eye streaks, no blue on the wings, and a turquoise
rump. The legs and feet are pink and the beaks horn-coloured. Young
birds assume adult coloration straight away, though this first plumage
seems softer and looser in texture than that of the adults. Their beaks
are pink, gradually fading to horn, throughout their first year of life.

General Characteristics

The pair I possess are rather silent, shy birds. They are extremely
reluctant to come to the floor of the cage and like all their food hung up
high. They have never bathed and dislike being sprayed. They roost
very early ; even in midsummer they have disappeared into their box
by six o'clock. They are also very alert and suspicious and the slightest
unusual sound causes them to draw themselves up very erect on the
perch, and peer round in all directions until they have located its
origin. Perhaps the most noticeable feature is that the birds are
always together. If one flies the other immediately follows. They sit
pressed together on the perch and spend much time in mutual preening.

When I had to remove the hen, who became ill, they called to each
other for several hours. When they do disagree they make a high
pitched chattering, drawing themselves up very erect with feathers
tight. Their heads bob and weave and feint with their beaks open. The
leg nearest their opponent is raised and makes vague, grasping move-
ments in the air. I have never seen them touch each other during this
display which usually ends by one bird leaving the perch to fly round to
the other side of the one left. Their threat display is rather impressive.
With all feathers fluffed out and beaks open they rock very slowly
backwards. When it seems they are about to fall off the perch they
lunge forward extremely fast. This is done silently and the strike
forward is made long before the object they are threatening is within
range. I have never seen them do this to each other. It seems to be
directly solely to external dangers.
Feeding
My pair would only eat spray millet when they first arrived.
I managed to wean them on to a mixture of mixed canary, mixed
millets, groats, and hemp. However, they reared their brood entirely
on spray millet. During the moult they became extremely fond of hemp
and threw out all their other seed in an effort to find it. They also had
cuttlefish, grit, apple (which they eat sporadically), and seeding grass,
of which they were very fond. Dried spinach and powdered yeast and
C. L. O. were added to the seed mixture. They ignored sunflower seed,
never used their feet to pick anything up, and also chewed up a lot of
wood, though this whittling can scarcely be called an addition to their
diet.
Courtship
The cock fed the hen on a few occasions before nesting commenced.
Mating was seen several times. There seemed to be no special pre-
liminaries. The hen crouched on the perch with wings slightly spread
and the cock stood on one foot and straddled her with the other.
All the matings were very brief. Only once was the cock seen to
give anything that might be called a display and this consisted of
advancing along the perch towards the hen snaking his neck from side
to side as he did so.
Breeding
When a budgerigar nest-box was placed at one end of the cage,
the birds remained rooted to the perch at the other end for the next ten
days. The cock finally investigated the box and shortly after this the
two of them used it for roosting. The hen started incubating on 11 th
April. The nest-box was not examined but from later evidence,

chiefly from a disastrous second clutch, I know that the eggs were
white and were laid on every second day. I don't know whether
incubation started with the laying of the first egg but certainly the
nestlings were all different sizes and when they finally flew it was at
three-day intervals. During incubation, and for the first three weeks or
so after hatching, the hen only appeared once a day. This was about
noon, when she flew out for a drink, a brief preen, and to relieve her-
self of an extremely large, wet dropping. She was never out for more
than two minutes. The cock also spent much time in the nest-box but,
as he could always be seen sitting just inside the entrance hole, I am
certain he took no part in incubation. Seventeen days after the hen
began incubation she appeared at noon with her breast feathers damp
and glued together and a faint squeaking could be heard in the box, so
I presumed the first egg had hatched. Four weeks later a chick was
first seen at the nest-box entrance. It was completely bald with the
disproportionate head of all young parrotlike birds. Seven weeks after
the first hatching date two nestlings were thrown out of the nest-box.
The larger was a young cock with his blue quills just showing on his
wings ; the smaller was completely bald. I replaced these and an hour
later the young cock was again ejected this time with both legs bleeding.
I made an attempt to hand-rear him but after a month he died, owing
to my lack of experience in weaning. Shortly after this the mummified
remains of another young cock was found on the cage floor. On 23rd
June, eight weeks after hatching, the first young hen flew, to be followed
at three-day intervals by three others. The fourth hen had been
attacked in the box and had a crippled leg. As the adult hen was
chivvying them, the fledglings were removed to a separate cage on the
morning that the last one flew. Once they had left the nest the young-
sters were entirely self-supporting. The parents were never seen to
feed them, though they all returned to roost in the box at night. The
nest-box was examined and revealed an inch-thick layer of powdered
faeces, confirming my impression that there was no attempt at nest
sanitation. There was also a large amount of millet and millet husks
suggesting that the parents had been carrying whole millet into the
box for some time before the fledglings flew. One mystery was a
sustained drumming noise that was heard from inside the nest box at
infrequent intervals. How this noise was produced I have no idea.

<bodyText confidence="0.984105" page_id="56317673"  page_num="26" year="" vol="">
By S. B. Kendall (Chertsey, England)
Breeding results have been better than ever before, but I would
attribute this more to the gradual accumulation of suitable stock than
to any conditions of the environment or season. Eleven Cockatoos left
the nest, although one young Roseate died soon afterwards. Timors
laid but did not hatch (the hen is of my own breeding) ; Leadbeater's
did nothing. Of the young birds that survived three were Citron-
crests (two from my old pair and one from a pair comprising an im-
ported hen and a home-bred cock), five were Roseates (two nests from
one pair : they have fully reared seventeen during the last three years)
and two were hybrids--Leadbeater's X Citron-crest (hen). As these
probably represent a previously unrecorded breeding some more detail
may be of interest.
The parents are both aviary-bred--the Citron-crest here and the
Leadbeater's elsewhere--and had spent a season together previously
with no result. Owing to the position of the barrel I was able to observe
progress rather more closely than usual. The first egg was noticed on

5th May, and another on 8th May. One young one was seen on 2nd
June, after a period of incubation during which the parents seemed to
be out of the nest far more than was advisable ! The second hatched on
4th June. The crests of the young were seen to be growing by 30th

<bodyText confidence="0.97726" page_id="56317673"  page_num="26" year="" vol="">
June, and I noted that the plumage was mainly white. The young left
the nest about 30th July.
The hybrids are, in my opinion very lovely, although not really what
I expected. The plumage may, of course, change as they become adult.
Basically the plumage is white, slightly suffused with yellow on the
breast, orange on the cheeks, and with pink and yellow under the tail
and under the wings. The crest is orange to salmon with a little white
at the tips, midway in fact between those of the parents. The birds are
larger than Citron-crests of equivalent age, particularly the cock, which
also is noticeably brighter. They are quite obviously a true pair,
the eye of the cock being black and that of the hen grey-brown, and
there is a definite difference in the pitch of their voices.
Personally I am delighted with the result. There may be some who
feel that I am misusing valuable breeding stock, but in extenuation I
can answer that for a number of years now I have produced at least my
quota of pure-bred cockatoos and that such hybrid stock has some
scientific interest as well as giving somebody the opportunity of getting
pets of great beauty and, one can expect, of exceptional hardiness. It
seems very doubtful if they are fertile, although they certainly don't
look like hybrids, and I was at one stage tempted to exhibit them at the
" National " as Fulu Island Cockatoos, but I have not yet got round to

LIBERTY WHITE-EYES IN 1963
</equation>
<bodyText confidence="0.9817555" page_id="56317674"  page_num="27" year="" vol="">
By R. A. Richardson (Cley, Norfolk, England).
Readers may remember that in 1962 pair " C " of my Indian
White-eyes (#\0x25A0osterops palpebrosd) reared two youngsters at liberty and
that all four birds were admitted to the aviary where they successfully
survived the icy weather of early 1963.
Shortly after the thaw set in, however, the young female was picked
up dead from the aviary floor, having apparently struck some obstacle
in flight.
The adult female was once again duly released on 15th May, her
mate being allowed to join her six days later.
For the first half of June I was away in the Shetlands and due to a
misunderstanding these birds were deprived of nectar and all artificial
food for a whole fortnight, yet such is the tenacity of White-eyes that
they were still coming to the aviary when I returned home and resumed
their food supply.
The nest was never found but was probably 100 yards away in the
same tree as 1962, for it was there, on 27th June, that I found two tiny
newly-fledged chicks " welded " snugly together among the topmost
twigs of the identical elm tree and being tended by one of the parents.
Thenceforward the father was in and out of the garden daily and on
30th July I found him singing in a wood half a mile away.
On 12th August he was home again and bickering through the wire
netting with his 1962 son which had remained confined in the aviary.
A few days later I re-admitted him and surprisingly enough they
soon settled down together again.
The female and two youngsters were never seen again and must have
met with an accident.
It is known that a notorious liquid insecticide was being used against
a plague of greenfly at about the time they disappeared but I cannot
say whether or not this was responsible.
I still have male " G " and his 1962 son plus two newly-imported
birds of uncertain sex.

It can be said that David Seth-Smith was the doyen of International
Aviculture. No one has been concerned so long, so completely and so
successfully with the care and study of birds in captivity. Nor has
anyone been more closely identified with the Avicultural Society and
the London Zoo. He was the last of a remarkable generation of
aviculturists, which immediately preceeded mine, and included
Hubert Astley, Alfred Ezra, Gerard Gurney, the Duchess of Bedford,
the Duchess of Wellington, Meade-Waldo, St. Quintin, Amsler and a |
few others. They all were my friends ; they taught me a great deal
of what I know, and I miss them sadly.
In his capacity of curator of birds at the London Zoo, David
Seth-Smith occupied the centre of the avicultural stage. All came to
consult with him and to ask for his advice and services, as he was as kind
and unselfish as he was well informed, his help was always available and
he became extremely popular with all bird lovers. I met him for the
first time in 1918, when I came on leave to England just before the end
of the war. We have never since ceased to be in close touch, seeing a
lot of each other. He came to Cleres on several occasions, and it
became a habit for him, Ezra, S. Stokes, and myself to go on tours all
over England and France to meet aviculturists and to see their collec-
tions. These trips were altogether instructive and delightful, and I
keep a fond memory of them.
I went to see David Seth-Smith at Guildford for the last time on
12th June 1963, as I did every summer. He was evidently getting
weaker, but his mind was still as good as ever, and we had fun talking
of the good old days. His last years had been serene and he remained
as happy as one can be at advanced age, thanks to the devotion of his
wife, Heather. I feel personally grateful to her for having brought
comfort and peace of mind to my old friend.

By Robert Lotshaw (Loveland, Ohio, U.S.A.)
In the autumn of 1962 the Cincinnati Zoological Gardens came into
possession of a pair of adult Downy Woodpeckers, Dryobates pubescens
medianus. Realizing the chances were poor of keeping them alive,
Edward Maruska, general curator, suggested smearing diced fruit and
a soft food mixture on the uppermost tree bark in the woodpeckers'
cage. The idea was to bring the food directly to the Downys rather
than to take a chance they might never find it. Also, this was the first
step of a dish conditioning process.

If at first the Downy Woodpeckers continued to refuse the smeared
food, then a further inducing agent would be to sprinkle mealworms on
it. Once the Downys were observed to be eating, then each succeeding
day the food was smeared on the bark at lower levels until the base of
the tree was reached. The final step was simply transferring the diced
fruit and soft food to a dish.
Their present diet consists of the standard soft-food mixture com-
prised of Ken-L-Ration dog food, cottage cheese, peanut butter, and
dried flies, which have been soaked in warm water ; very finely
grated egg ; and diced fruit consisting of apple, grape, and banana.
Every morning a milk formula is given to the woodpeckers and consists
of two parts water, one part condensed milk, honey, Ledinac, and Vi-
Penta vitamin drops. It is removed from the cage a few hours later to
prevent the birds from drinking sour milk. Also, an adequate number
of mealworms are offered.
A third Downy Woodpecker has recently been started on the afore-
mentioned conditioning process. This one, a female, seems reluctant to
i accept the smeared food, but we are confident that she will eventually.

The famous waterfowl collection at the Berlin Zoo--with more than
a hundred different species one of the largest in Europe--has now
received its most valuable addition. As a generous gift of the Fish and
Wildlife Service in the U.S. Department of the Interior a young pair
of Trumpeter Swans arrived in late September. These huge birds are
the largest and one of the rarest representatives of waterfowl. Originally
distributed from the Arctic south to the United States, where they
nested on the prairies, west to the Rocky Mountains and wintered by
the thousands from coast to coast south to Mexico, by 1910 the Trum-
peters were thought to be extinct.
Having discovered some pairs again breeding on wilderness lakes
in the Yellowstone National Park, in 1929 a programme was started
in order to save this species from final extinction. In the Red Rock
Lakes National Wildlife Refuge in Montana the Trumpeter Swans
have increased now again to number between 500 and 700, and
perpetuation seems assured.
We are most obliged to the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service for
placing a pair at our disposal, and to the National Zoological Park in
Washington D.G. for kind assistance. The Berlin Zoo had already

exhibited Trumpeter Swans until 1916 without being so lucky to
breed them in captivity, although the famous Dutch aviculturist
F. E. Blaauw had proved that this is by all means possible.
In late October the Berlin Zoo had the good luck to acquire a pair
of Laysan Teal. These ducks, endemic only on the small island of
Laysan, north of Hawaii, belong to the rarest species among water-
fowl. Having vanished more and more during the last decades the
number of Teal living free on the only lake of the island had decreased
to some thirty, until a strict conservation programme was started.
Now they again number about one hundred and it has even been
possible to breed them in captivity.
After having endeavoured for years, we succeeded in acquiring a fine
pair of White-naped Cranes, bred in the United States. Furthermore
we got four Indian Painted Storks, seldom occurring in Zoological
Gardens.
From Australia two Tawny Frogmouths and two Little Penguins
arrived at the Berlin Zoo in September, in exchange for some animals
bred in our Gardens.
Tawny Frogmouths (Podargus strigoides) are seldom to be seen
in European Zoos, although distributed throughout the whole of
Australia, where forest-lands occur. Sitting with eyes closed in an
upright position on a branch in their cage, they simulate the bark of
the branch so closely that they are really difficult to locate. Fed with
meat, mice, and insects they are thriving well.
Little Penguins (Eudyptula minor), the smallest in the world, are
at home from Perth to Newcastle, south around Tasmania, in New
Zealand and east to the Chatham Islands, breeding in burrows and
coastal rookeries in spring and summer. In spite of being not uncommon
they belong to the rarities in European Zoos. From the date of their
arrival they have become favourites of the public. Always being
hand-fed with small pieces of fish they are doing well.
Other new arrivals worth mentioning include two Peruvian Boobies,

Mr. J. O. D'eath showed his new colour film " Return Safari to East
Africa, 1963 The photographer modestly describes this film as having
been taken mainly for the purpose of private showing to friends, but
actually it is of the very highest professional standard. Mr. G. S.

One of the most famous engravings in the world, Diirer's " Adam
and Eve " was recently sold at Sotherby's for #3,400. Engraved in
1504, it is of special interest to aviculturists and ornithologists alike
because included in the group, depicted on the edge of a forest, is a
fair likeness of a Ring-necked Parrakeet. This prompts one to wonder
whether this is the earliest representation of a parrot-like bird.

a pair of sex-linked lutinos' young ones will all be lutinos.

In the National Geographic Magazine , December, 1963, John G.
Williams, Curator of the Department of Ornithology at the Coryndon
Museum, Nairobi, gives an absorbingly interesting account of the
largest and most successful African bird rescue operation in history.
The legs of many thousands of baby flamingos at Lake Magadi, Kenya,
became encrusted with soda. Thousands died before help could be
given but the magnificent efforts of rescue teams resulted in more than
27,000 young flamingos being manually freed from their soda shackles,
and at least 200,000 other juvenile birds were prevented by the
presence of the rescue teams from entering the shallows where the soda
was most concentrated.
There is an excellent series of photographs by Alan Root of the
flamingos and the rescue operations. Alan Root and his wife Joan are
ardent conservationists and it was they who first discovered the
appalling plight of the young birds. A. A. P.

A Bateleur Eagle presented in June, 1919, by Sir Geoffrey Archer has
died. The bird was in immature plumage when it came and was then
about two years of age, having lived its first year in Somaliland and
some time in Sussex where it lived at liberty in the garden, returning of
its own accord to roost in a stable. On occasion it accompanied Sir
Geoffrey's man, Ibrahim Sayed, into Horsham by bus, travelling, not
in the approved falconry style, but tucked under the man's arm. For
some years it has shown signs of senility, usually sitting on a platform
near the ground, but just occasionally it would perform the ghost of a
display and give a faint cry whenever its companion, a much younger
bird, was greeting a known passer-by.
This is the bird referred to in volume 1 of " The Birds of British
Somaliland and the Gulf of Aden " by Sir Geoffrey and Miss Godman,
published in 1937.
Six species and one sub-species not previously in the collection have
been received : these are :--Black-throated Barbet ( Tricholaema m.
melanocephalum) , Elgon Yellow-billed Barbet ( Trachylaemus purpuratus

elgonensis ), Cretzschmar's Bunting (. Emberiza caesia ), Black-billed
Weaver ( Ploceus melanogaster stephanophorus) , Red-headed Blue-bill
(1 Spermophaga r. ruficapilla) , Magpie Starling ( Speculipastor bicolor ) and
Black-winged Oriole ( Oriolus nigripennis percivali ).
Most of these specimens were in a fine collection brought by Mr.
David Roberts of Lake Baringo. It is not at present known exactly

where the Black-throated Barbets were collected, but the race in that
area should be T. m. stigmatothorax which has a brown throat and often
some red on the belly. Those brought by Mr. Roberts resemble the
nominate race which is supposed to live farther north. There are four
races of this species, all inhabiting dry scrub country of eastern and
north-eastern Africa.
The Black-billed Weaver inhabits the undergrowth in forested areas,
not the tree canopy. It appears to be insectivorous and is a solitary
nester. There are two races and, so far as is known, they are widely
separated, one living in mountainous parts of the former British
Cameroon and the other in a fairly small area of East Africa. This is, of
course, not to be confused with the Black-billed Sparrow Weaver
(. Plocepasser ).
The Magpie Starling is of particular interest. Some of the other
species mentioned may be new to aviculture, but this starling almost
certainly is. It is said to be a great wanderer over parts of Somaliland,
Kenya, and north-eastern Uganda and is reported to have appeared in
large numbers on Mombasa Island to feed on the ripe fruit of the wild

skirts of Nairobi to feed on wild tomatoes growing on the municipal
dump--" and in two days there was not a ripe fruit in the whole ten-
acre plot 55 . Nesting is said generally to take place in holes in ant-hills
(presumably termite mounds).
Cretzschmar's Bunting breeds in parts of south-eastern Europe and
south-western Asia, wintering in north-eastern Africa. It lives on
rocky hill-sides and semi-desert areas, but in winter is said to frequent
cultivated land, generally near the desert.
Other arrivals include a young pair of Fish Eagles (H. vocifer), Lesser
Scaup, Pintail, Sharp-winged Teal, a Hyacinthine Macaw, a Crested
Lark, a Calandra Lark, and some Bristle-crowned Starlings ( Onycho -
gnathus salvadorii ).
A second Cattle Egret has been bred in the Gardens ; also two
Collared X Turtle Doves (Streptopelia decaocto X S. turtur). The mother
flew on to a ship near the Scilly Isles last Spring and appeared to have
injured its wing which is still held in a dropped position, though flight
is not affected. In the British birds' aviary it soon mated with a
Collared Turtle Dove (the species that has in recent times spread north-
westward and is now breeding in parts of Britain) and the single chick
of the first nest died. This hybrid has, of course, been previously bred
in captivity.

Price 95^. net.
This interesting and beautifully produced book deals with all the
Australian broadtail parrakeets except the Budgerigar, Ground
Parrakeet, and Night Parrakeet. It is written by an experienced
keeper and breeder of psittacines primarily for aviculturists or those
likely to take up aviculture.
The first part of the book deals with purchasing, keeping,
and breeding parrakeets. It is profusely illustrated with helpful
sketches and photographs. The author strongly advises his readers to
&amp;apos;procure European-bred specimens if possible and to purchase only
young birds. He gives as reasons for this advice that (presumably
before the export ban) Australian aviculturists usually only parted with
second-rate birds when selling them overseas and, similarly, few people
in Europe are likely to wish to sell adult parrakeets unless these have
some physical or psychological defect that makes them useless for
breeding. He gives some amusing, if alarming, examples. When

discussing the breeding of parrakeets the author shows how a con-
sideration of the birds' nesting habits and nest enemies in the wild can
be of the utmost practical use to the aviculturist. This section is
followed by a chapter on diseases and how to avoid or cure them,
where possible, by J. Doctors Van Leeuwen, and a chapter on the
photography of captive birds by S. Duursma.
The second part of the book consists of a clear, concise, but reasonably
detailed account of each species, with special emphasis on care and
feeding in captivity. Except for the Golden-shouldered Parrakeet, each
species is illustrated by a coloured photograph showing both sexes.
These plates add greatly to the value and beauty of the book. It must,
however, be said that the colour reproduction, though good, is not
perfect and in many cases does not do full justice to the brilliance of the
living birds.
When in doubt as to whether to treat a form as a full species or
not the author chooses the former course. This seems sensible in such a
book as this and he has been careful to state in such cases that others
hold a different opinion and to give references. The book can be
recommended to everyone, aviculturist or otherwise, who is interested
in the platycercine parrakeets.

The first edition of this interesting and entertaining book, published
in 1958, was so well received that the author has been induced to
produce a revised and enlarged second edition. In his preface,
Mr. Prestwich states that it is quite doubtful whether this second
edition would have materialized if he had not had reason to consult
Malaysian Plant Collectors and Collections , being volume 1 (1950) of Flora
Malesiana, from which he was able to extract all the additional and
confirmatory information. j
Each entry of Mr. Prestwich's book has been re-edited, many
revisions and additions have been made, and several fresh names have
been introduced. There are two further Appendixes, (B) personal
names published since 1st January, 1936, and (C) a complete list of
scientific names admitted by Peters, together with their derivations
and appropriate English names.
Mr. Prestwich is to be congratulated on his initiative and enormous !
amount of work in producing such a valuable, informative, and well
written publication.

This is a translation, from Russian, of a monographic study, ex-
tending over many years, of the ecology of sea colony birds from
Murmansk in the west to Novaya Zemlya in the east, and especially
those of the Barents Sea. The author, a well-known zoologist, has
studied in detail the nutrition of sea-birds, their methods of obtaining
food, their diet and changes in their diet, the nutrition of various age
groups, and the relationship between the various ingredients of their
diet. Also the reproduction of sea-birds, including the dynamics of
bird population, fecundity, etc.
A large section of the book is devoted to the intra- and inter-specific
relations between the bird colony of the Barents Sea, mutual rela-
tionship between birds and their food, and the effect of predatory
activity and relationship between the species as a factor in the estab-
lishment and development of sea-bird colonies.
The work, originally published in 1957, is of special interest in view
of the opening of the Great Northern Sea route and the development
of the natural resources of the Arctic. The text contains numerous
illustrations but their reproduction is of such poor quality that many
are difficult to decipher.

The book tells of the disappearing countryside in Britain and the
many hazards which now contribute to destroy wildlife, from the
encroachment of man himself, toxic chemicals, and detergents which
ruin streams, to mention only a few, and he aptly titles his first chapter
" Facing the Challenge ". Though the greater part of the book is
devoted to British mammals, there are five chapters on familiar birds
which contain many of the author's first-hand observations. The
book is illustrated with first-rate photographs, many by Eric Hosking,

News from the Chester Zoo Bird Collection
Some time ago we received a Guinea Wood-Hoopoe (Phoeniculus erythrorynchus \
guineensis ) which is housed in the Tropical House. It is extremely partial to maggots,
and one of the keepers told me about a most curious way with which it deals with
them. So curious, in fact, that I would hardly have believed it had I not seen it
myself some days later. The bird behaves exactly as if it were " anting." It flies down
to the live-food pot, and places six or seven maggots under the feathers of its back. It
then flies back to its usual perch and proceeds to eat the maggots at its leisure. I wonder i
if there is a connection with " anting " procedure ?
One of our seven Cocks-of-the-Rock, which also inhabits the Tropical House is a
keen mouse-hunter, and deals with its prey exactly like a Kingfisher, banging it
against its perch for some time before finally swallowing it. Unfortunately it has also
been seen to devour a Humming bird !

Toe Deformity in Pheasant Chicks
Some years ago I suggested to a pheasant breeder that it would be interesting to
provide bantam foster-mothers of pheasant chicks with perches in the coop so as
to encourage early perching by the chicks as occurs in the wild state when they go up to
roost on a branch with the mother. This, I believed, would help to prevent the foot
deformities in pheasant chicks that occur when they are reared under bantams in the
conventional way, and my only reason for thinking this was that I had never seen a
case of toe deformity in pheasants that had been reared with the parents in a place
where they could roost naturally.
It was, therefore, with particular interest that I learned from Monsieur Delacour
that a pheasant breeder in the United States had done this and apparently with
success.
Obviously there are other causes of these deformities, but I believe this to be the
main one.

By Aage V. Nielsen (Copenhagen)
On 20th September, 1958, I obtained a pair of Red-faced Lovebirds,
which I put in a roomy cage (40&amp;quot; X 20&amp;quot; X 24&amp;quot;) in our drawing room,
in order to make them confident. They were rather shy at first, but
with quiet treatment and by gently speaking to them I soon taught
them that my hand came in the cage only in order to give them food
and not to catch them, and that the hand always came in through the
cage door farthest from them, so that they did not need to panic.
In the beginning they received the same food as given by their
previous owner, about which I was, of course, informed when obtaining
the birds. By and by I extended the list of foods and gave them some
tit-bits on every occasion. Thus the birds gradually became more
confident and greeted me every morning with happy twitters.
On 29th October, 1958, when I came in the room to take the birds
to a show, I saw the hen suddenly drop down from the perch on the
cage floor, dead. This was a great sorrow for me as well as for the
pullaria cock. He cried loudly, and most probably would have cried
himself to death if I had not taken him to the show, where the altered
environments, the many other birds, and all the life around him made
him gradually forget the hen, and on the third day he fed and drank
normally. After the show I took him home and put him in another
cage in the vicinity of other birds.
About half a year later, on 26th April, 1959, after much searching,
I was lucky to obtain a new, and obviously young hen, whose mate had
died as suddenly as my hen. After a period of quarantine, the birds
were put together. They did not show much interest in each other, nor
any enmity.
After some days I let the pair fly in my birdroom. This is a light and
roomy cellar room, approximately 14&amp;apos; X 14&amp;apos; X *]&amp;apos; high. The room is
furnished with fruit-tree branches and lots of polygonum stems and all
kinds of nesting receptacles : basket-nests, nesting-boxes, harzer
wicker-cages, coconut husks, flower pots, etc., placed at all levels from
the floor right up to the roof. The floor is covered with a thick layer of

gravel and upon this sand, earth, oyster shells, peat moss, and wood
shavings. A small sprinkler fountain is placed on the floor and food
receptacles are hung all over the room. Apart from the seed which the
birds scatter from the pots, grass seed is sprinkled on the floor, mainly
around the fountain. The room is connected with an outside flight,
27&amp;apos; X 5&amp;apos; X 6&amp;apos; high. This flight is planted with stinging-nettles and
different kinds of weeds, and furnished with fresh fruit-tree branches
and a large bird-bath. The outside aviary is only used as flight for the
birds, all feeding taking place in the indoor flight.
In this environment are kept about thirty pairs of Waxbills and other
small seed-eaters, four Diamond Sparrows, one pair of Striped Mouse-
birds, some Painted Quails, one pair of Bourke's Parrakeets, and the
above named pair of Red-faced Lovebirds. The birds all agree
perfectly and I have never observed any serious fighting about food,
nests, bathing-, resting-, or sleeping-places. Grey Waxbills, Orange-
cheeked Waxbills, Lavender Finches, Firefinches, Bicheno's Finches,
Cuban Finches, Bengalese, hybrids of Grey and Orange-cheeked
Waxbills, Bourke's Parrakeets, and Painted and Harlequin Quails have
all bred and raised their young. Nests have been built free in the
wilderness as well as in the different artificial nesting receptacles, some
quite secluded, others in open places.
Among the nest-boxes there are three of the horizontal type with an
entrance hole with side aspect to the light. These boxes are approxi-
mately 17&amp;quot; x 7&amp;quot; X 7&amp;quot; high and the entrance hole 3 inches in diameter.
In one of these boxes the Bourke's had nested and when the last young
had left the nest, this was taken down and cleaned and the bottom
covered with 1 in. layer of peat-moss and upon this a layer of sawdust
and fine shavings of fir tree in order to be ready if the Bourke's should
start again.
It was, however, the pair of lovebirds, which for a long period had
been interested in each other, who took this box, and on 3rd August,
i960, there were two eggs in the box. From that date the hen went in
the box every evening, the cock roosting outside on a perch just over
the entrance hole. On 4th August there were still two eggs in the box,
on the 5th August three eggs, on the 6th still three eggs, but on the
morning of 7th August there were four eggs. From that date the hen sat
regularly and only went out from the box for a few minutes twice a day,
usually early in the morning and late in the afternoon. From the 8th of
August the cock also spent the night in the box and the day mainly
in the outside flight, but visiting the box several times in the day
for two to five minutes, obviously in order to feed the hen.
On 10th August at 5 p.m. there were still four eggs in the box, but in
the morning on the 1 ith there were five. The hen was now sitting so
tightly that I felt most excited, even if I--after all that I had heard and
read--was very doubtful if I should be lucky enough to see pullaria

youngsters. My doubts were confirmed. In the first days of September
I understood that something was wrong. The hen was anxious, and
frequently came out of the box, in which there were still five eggs.
On 6th September I believed that incubation had finished, but the hen
still went in the box, and incubation did not stop completely until
10th September. During the incubation period I had not touched the
eggs, only observed that they went darker. I now removed them: four
were fertile with dead embryos, the fifth was damaged. The size of the eggs
was: 20 mm. X 16 mm., 21 mm. X 16 -75 mm., 21 mm. X 16 -75 mm.,
21 *3 mm. x 16-85 mm., and 22 mm. X 17 mm. They were all pointed
at one end, white at the start, but in the course of the sitting went
creamy-grey, and at the end whitish with grey and yellow tints.
I tried to give the birds as many different kinds of food as possible,
in order to detect what they preferred. For this reason the foods had
not only to be given in separate pots, but I had also to detect which
birds fed at the different pots. At last I succeeded in placing some pots
in such a way that the lovebirds got the food first, and thus, to some
degree, could detect the kind and quantity of their needs. Mealworms
were one of the food items involved. I had hung up a pot for the
lovebirds, and in the beginning they took about 50 worms a day.
Later on the consumption increased regularly, and reached approxi-
mately 200 a day at the beginning of the incubation period. The birds
were also very interested in apple-tree branches, which were peeled
mainly by the cock, but also by the hen every time she came out of the
box. On the other hand I could not find evidence of an increase in the
consumption of seed and fruit during the incubation period. I still tried
to extend the list of food, in order to keep the birds in as strong condition
as possible for further breeding attempts. Of course, I did not expect
the birds to start again in i960, but events did not go as I thought.
It seemed that the pullaria pair could not settle down. Several times
I saw the cock chasing the hen and after a while being kind to her
again, picking at her feathers and preening her, all the time being
near her.
On 23rd September I saw the hen making several short visits in the
same box, which had been cleaned out and supplied with new peat
moss and wood shavings. In the evening, however, there was nothing
to see ; she had raked about a bit in the contents, but nothing was
either brought in or thrown out. On the following days nothing
happened, but on the 26th there was a new pullaria egg in the box.
The hope of a new clutch was not fulfilled, as no further eggs were laid
in September. On 1st October, in the morning, there was still only
that single egg in the box, and in the following two days I could not
examine the box, but on 4th October in the evening there were three
eggs in the box and my hopes started to grow. On 5th and 6th October
the hen spent all the time in the box, and of course I would not

disturb her, but on the 7th I could ascertain that there were four eggs.
From that date the hen sat regularly and the cock spent all the nights in
the box. On 10th October there were five eggs, and in the period
following I did not examine the box, but I have noted that the hen
sat, and spent all the time in the box.
It was not until 4th November I looked in the box and saw three
living young and two eggs. Everything indicates that the young were
hatched at intervals of some days, the incubation period being twenty-
two days. The biggest was most probably hatched on 29th October
and the smallest one, which was quite small, on 2nd or 3rd November.
The following days were rather exciting, but on 7th November one of
the three young, which until then had lain huddled together with the
thin necks across each other, now lay alone, separate from the other
ones. I put it back in the pile, but on the next morning it had entirely
disappeared. Later on it was found dried in the peat moss in the
box. This was the smallest one of the young, but on the next morning
both the remaining young lay separately. The smaller of these lay
on its back and was very weak, both had, however, been fed, and had
the crops filled with food. On 9th November, in the evening, I found
the body of the smaller young without head near the nest-hole. The
biggest and oldest youngster was apparently well, it begged for food as
soon as I touched it. Nevertheless it was weak the next morning. The
crop was filled with food, but the youngster died on the evening of the
same day, thirteen days old.
Now I went through all my notes, read all my literature on j bullaria,
and spoke with other breeders, whose birds had had young up to ten
days old. Everything seemed to point to the fact that the birds were
lacking something for feeding the young, which they could not do
without. It was now up to me to find this and hope that the birds
would make a new attempt in the following year.
The pullaria pair now settled down to enjoy life for a time, especially
the nice weather we had at the beginning of the summer, 1961. When
the long spell of moist weather started I increased the temperature
in the bird room somewhat, this constantly being about 76* F. (23 0 C.)
just below the nest-box. For some time I also directed the rays of an
infra-red flashlamp into the birdroom. I never saw the lovebirds take
advantage of this offer, whereas some young Waxbills and the Mouse-
birds often enjoyed the warm rays. The lovebirds' fondness for meal-
worms seemed to grow more and more. I now gradually increased the
ration and in May we reached a daily quantity of 200-250 worms.
The birds now had the following foods at their disposal: Insectivorous
(softbill) food, canary seed, white, yellow, Indian and Japanese millet,
niger seed, blue maw seed, hemp, sunflower, oats, millet sprays, apples,
pears, oranges, grapes, bananas, figs, lettuce, cabbage, dandelion,
plantain, stinging-nettles, grass seeds in all states of sprouting, fresh

A. V. NIELSEN-BREEDING THE RED-FACED LOVEBIRD IN DENMARK 43
grass turfs, fresh branches of fruit trees, sponge cake with glucose,
mealworms, oyster shells, and mortar which they gnawed from the bird
room. All was present in large quantities so that the birds would be
weaned to different foods, if they possibly decided to breed again. I had
also tried raisins, plums, and apricots, made in different ways, but none
of my birds were interested in these. The lovebirds and other birds got
a liking for mixed fruit marmalade, and this is now always at their
disposal. Sprouted seed, white, yellow, Indian, Japanese, and spray
millet had earlier been offered in different ways, sprouted seed alone,
mixed with carrot juice, mixed with the soft food, etc. From 1961
onwards I have not given sprouted seeds as the birds preferred the grass
seed down on the floor, which was always eagerly taken, before it went
green.
It may seem to be a very wide choice of foods, but it was not intended
for the lovebirds alone, all the birds in the room took the different
things, and by and by the lovebirds got a liking for most of the different
foods, so it has hardly been too much effort. I always tried to find
further new foods, and one day I thought that the pupae of mealworms
would possibly have some likeness to the pupae of the termites which
the birds perhaps take in the wild. It turned out that fresh white
pupae were preferred to worms and taken first. From June, 1961,
onwards the feeding-vessels of the lovebirds were filled with three-
quarters part of mealworms and one-quarter part of pupae.
About 1 st July, the hen again started to be interested in the same
nest-box. She sat on the perch by the entrance hole and peeped in the
box. But not until 4th July did she go into the box for a moment. She
behaved likewise on the following days ; on 8th July I looked in the box
and found two eggs. On nth July there were three eggs and on the
13th, four, and from that date she sat closely and the cock also spent
the nights in the box from the same date, and during all the sub-
sequent incubation period. On 15th July the fifth and last egg arrived.
The feeding habits of the cock now changed somewhat. For green
food he now preferred lettuce and branches of fruit-trees, and hardly
touched any other kinds . He preferred apple to pear, and orange to
banana. By and by his consumption of mealworms reached 300-400 a
day, one-half to three-quarters slice of sponge cake, almost a whole
apple, parts of the leaves and bark of apple tree branches, and seed.
All the time he fed the hen diligently in the box, and also for some
minutes outside when she came out twice a day.
By a regular inspection of the box, when the birds were outside,
I was able to observe that in the period from 16th to 31st July the
five eggs became darker. One of them had a longish dark spot, and this
showed me that the eggs were turned over regularly. On 31st July
I had bad luck. I had observed that both the birds were in the outdoor
aviary, went quickly down in the birdroom, took the box down,

opened the lid--and saw the hen sitting on the eggs. Very carefully
I closed the lid and placed the box back. Nothing happened, but when
I was on my way out from the room and believed that everything was
satisfactory, the hen suddenly went out from the box calling loudly.
Would she go back in the box ? Yes, after the longest half an hour in my
life, I saw her go back in the box and after a while the cock came and
fed her as usual.
From 4th to 7th August I did not open the box, but on the 8th
I observed two young and three eggs in the box. The young were very
ugly ; naked, the skin dull, pale yellowish-grey, bills very light and
weak-looking, and legs and feet very pale, dull, and transparent. They
lay with their necks across one another. Considering the time of
incubation they should have been hatched on 3rd and 5th August,
which agreed very well with their size and appearance.
It would take too much space to give my notes of this period in full,
but the following may be of interest :--
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.656834" page_id="56317707"  page_num="44" year="" vol="">
12th August : two young and three eggs in the box. The young now
have a thin, quite short, pale yellow cover of down, which seems to be
much lighter than the skin. The upper mandible starts to grow darker
at the base on the bigger of the young.
16th August : the down of the young now more greyish ; the base
of the upper mandible now definitely darker in both young. They have
grown somewhat and lay with the necks across one another.
18th August : two young with a quite dense layer of grey down and

quite small, dark dots on wings and rump. The bigger one tries to
stand erect, and climbs upon the smaller one, but drops down im-
mediately. Both are on the move all the time.
21 st August : both the young stand upright in the box. The bigger
one is very lively, tries to climb up in a corner, and spreads the wings,
which now have short, dark grey flights. Dark grey, almost black tail
feathers are growing ; upper mandibles are black at the base, and the
legs dark grey. The smaller youngster is also very lively, but is always
bottommost and cannot free himself from the bigger one, which climbs
upon him in the corner of the box. The parents feed them industriously,
the young are very well fed, but begging or feeding sounds are not
heard. The consumption of mealworms is about 490-500 a day.
22nd August : Walter Langberg has seen both the young to-day.
They now have grey feathers on the body, a very faint reddish
suffusion on the head, and some grey in the wing feathers.

28th August : Dr. Holger Poulsen (Curator of Birds in the
Copenhagen Zoo) and Albrecht-Moller (President of the Danish

definitely (bluish) green on body and wings and have a faint reddish
suffusion on the head and tail.

in the outside aviary. It is the very first time that the birds have taken a
bath in all the time we have had them. They were so wet that we
could hardly recognize them.
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.582858333333333" page_id="56317708"  page_num="45" year="" vol="">
2nd September : the young lively, but hide their heads when I open
the box. They nibble at my fingers when I take them in the hand.
They are now all green, foreheads and throats only having a reddish
suffusion ; the colour markings in the tails are clearly visible. Upper
mandible quite black at the base. I took a colour picture of them in
the box.
13th September : the bigger young one left the box to-day. He flew
very well, but quickly became tired, so I put him back in the box at
noon, where he stayed for the rest of the day.
14th September : the bigger young one in the outside aviary all the
day, but cannot find his way back to the birdroom.
15th September : the smaller young one left the nest at 6.44. His
</listItem>

flight is heavy, but he manoeuvres very well and lands excellently on
branches and the window. The father feeds the smaller young one
eagerly, but the bigger one has to beg for food.
20th September : the bigger young one very well developed ; flies
with the parents, takes a bath with the father in the outside aviary.
The smaller one flies more carefully and cannot find his way in from
the outside flight.
30th September : the smaller young one still cannot find his way in
from the outside flight. Its flight is heavy and it is obviously well fed.
It has some green lesser wing-coverts and is probably a hen. The
bigger young one takes food himself from all the different receptacles
and flies as well as the parents. Both the young resemble the parent
birds with the following exceptions : the young are orange-yellow
where the parents are orange-red. The beaks of the young are black at
the base, the upper mandible being black at the inner part of the back
of the bill and light horn yellow at the point.
7th October : the young have now been out from the nest twenty-
five and twenty-three days respectively. The smaller one has, for the
first time, found its way back in the birdroom.
On 15th October, 1961 : both the young have been on the perch for
more than a month. I would add that the three eggs not hatched in the
last clutch turned out to be clear.
The preceding notes are now about two years old and subsequently
one of the young--the oldest, a male--was shown at the Danish
Cage-bird Society Exhibition, 1962. I did not show more than one of
the young in order not to lose both of them if bad luck should happen,
but he got the greatest challenge cup and some other prizes in his class
and went home in good condition, though he was plainly displeased
at sitting alone in an aviary for a few days.
The pullaria female laid a new clutch of five eggs in February, 1963.

They were unfortunately all clear and I got an impression that the
male was, by then, too old. Unfortunately this was probably true, for
without any sign of disease he died in June, 1963. His previous owner got
him as a not quite young bird about 1952, and the little bird must
anyway have attained an age of about twelve to thirteen years, maybe
even more.
Now the son and his mother seem to take an interest in each other.
Every night they sit close on a fixed perch and the younger sister roosts
alone. During the day, however, the brother and sister keep together
much of the time, and the " older " brother will at any time be ready
to put up a brave defence if he considers that some danger might appear

Whilst in Ecuador in January, 1961, Mr. Boehm collected two pairs
of brown, thrush-like birds, merely identified to him at that time as
South American Brown Thrushes. This vague classification did not
deter him for their sweet, low, musical song had captivated his ear. On
arrival back at the Titusville aviaries they were accommodated in the
cage-room, where they soon made their sexes known, not only by their
song but by the antagonism of the males towards each other. Several
attempts were made to identify them generically but, beyond final-
izing as to their family, no definite decision as to their genus was made.
The sexes are so similar that one description will suffice. Above they
are dark russet-brown, slightly darker on the lores and ear-coverts.
The wings also are brown, with the wing-coverts and innermost
secondaries dark ochraceous-brown, the same colour as the tail.
The upper breast is pale ochraceous-brown, fading to ochraceous-
white on the centre of the belly. The chin and throat are of a similar
colouring to the upper breast, except that they bear faint brown
streaks. The under tail-coverts are whitish, with ochraceous edges.
The flanks and thighs are pale brown. The under wing-coverts are a
rich ochraceous-brown with the inner edges of the wing quills pale
chestnut. The legs and feet are dark brown, as is the bill. They are
about 9 inches in total length.
It was not until early 1963 that their identification finally was shown
to be the Pale-vented Robin, Turdus fumigatus ohsoletus, one of the races
of the Sabian Thrush, Turdus f. fumigatus , of the interior of tropical

South America. The nominate race is confined to east of the Andes,
but several other forms, including the Pale-vented Robin, range to the
southern Lesser Antilles, to Costa Rica, and down the western side of
the Andes to Ecuador.
However, to retrace our steps to 1961 when the birds were originally
received. They were released into outdoor aviaries in April that year,
one pair to a small aviary of 16 by 20 feet and the other to a larger one
of some 60 by 30 feet. The first-mentioned pair settled down immedia-
tely and, early in May, the female was observed to be constructing a
nest in a hemlock tree. It was a typical thrush nest, the outer casing
being bound with mud, with an inner lining of soft, fine grasses. Three
eggs were laid over the period 14th to 16th May, of which two hatched
on 2nd and 3rd June, the other egg being clear. The eggs closely
resembled those of the European Blackbird, having a ground colouring
of pale blue, mottled, marked, and streaked with light brown. The
markings were evenly distributed with no greater concentration in
any one place than another. They measured 29 by 21 * 5 mm.
The incubation, which began with the laying of the last egg, was
shared, as was the feeding of the nestlings. These were pale-skinned
with pale yellow-brown fluff on the top of the head and down the
middle of the back. Their gapes were pink, margined in bright yellow.
The rearing food in the early days consisted entirely of live-food in the
form of mealworms, supplied hourly, and any insects the parents
foraged for themselves in the aviary. Development was steady, their
eyes being open and quills showing in their wings at seven days old.
On 20th June, with one seventeen and the other eighteen days old, they
vacated the nest.
The plumage of the fledgelings was dark brown on the upper parts,
including the wings, the throat and upper chest being brownish-white
mottled with dark brown. The remainder of the underparts was clear
brownish-white. Within two days of their leaving the nest the parents
started to feed them fruit and raw ground beef in addition to the live-
food, the fledgelings finally attaining independence at thirty-two days
old. Full adult plumage was not obtained until they were some six
months old.
The pair placed in the larger aviary also reared a brood of two, these
being hatched in July, and independent by late August. As with the first
pair, there were three eggs in this clutch also, but only two were fertile.
It may appear to be a little tardy to write-up a report on a breeding
that took place over two years ago but, unless one has cause to be
fairly sure of the identity of the species, there seems to be little purpose
in just describing a sequence of events in respect of the breeding of an un-
identified bird. Not having come across any reports on the breeding of this
species in captivity, it is felt that the above information on the nestlings,
fledgelings, and adult birds might be of interest to other aviculturists.

By Russell Aiuto (the University of North Carolina, U.S.A.)
To date, most of what is known about inheritance in birds has been
confined to the three relatively lower avian orders, Galliformes,
Anseriformes, and Columbiformes. The first two groups have been of
interest mainly because of their economic significance, the last because
of ease with which antigen inheritance in hybrids can be studied.
Apart from some studies dealing with mendelian inheritance in
American Golden-winged and Blue-winged Warblers (Morse, 1926 ;
Parker, 1951), studies in natural hybridization in Towhees (Sibley,
1954, 1957) and in some tropical species (Williamson, 1957, and others),
and two studies of merit on the inheritance of mask colour in Gouldian
Finches (Southern, 1945 ; Murray, 1963), systematic breeding
experiments in the Passeriformes have been neglected by geneticists.
Thus, it is necessary to turn to the avicultural literature in order to
compile a satisfactory amount of information. The Zebra Finch, so
well studied by many aviculturists, is, genetically speaking, the best
known species of foreign bird. Members of the Zebra Finch Society,
notably P. A. Pope, C. H. Rogers, and many others, have made this
species an admirable subject for intensive genetic research.
Therefore, in an effort to link even more closely together the related
fields of aviculture and genetics, and to recognize the many contribu- j
tions that these noted aviculturists have made directly or indirectly to :
the field of avian genetics, discussions of systematized breeding experi- 1
ments with foreign birds are needed. This paper hopes to do this by :
(i) formally presenting in conventional genetic terms the mutants
known in the Zebra Finch, and, (ii) reporting on present studies now
being carried on at this institution on the two sex-linked mutants in this
species.
A. Mutants in the Zebra Finch
The first goal is essentially achieved by the presentation in Table 1.
Presumptuously, symbols have been assigned for each mutant (as is :
the convention among geneticists) since, to my knowledge, this has
not previously been done. Should these meet with the approval
of noted Zebra Finch fanciers, the suggestion is made that these
symbols become the standard notations used in reporting genetic
investigations. The consistent use of standard symbols has been found
to make for precise communication, and the great bodies of Drosophila
and Neurospora literature attest to this fact. i
It is helpful to point out that the symbols in Table 1 refer to mutant &amp;apos;
genes, and not necessarily to how the birds look. With this in mind, the ;
Cream Zebra Finch is not the result of a single mutant gene, but the

phenotype resulting from the interaction of genes which separately
would cause Fawn and Silver Zebra Finches. Therefore, by my
notation, a Cream male would be DDff or Ddff in constitution, i.e.
genotypically.

It may be helpful to define some of the terms glibly used by
geneticists so that future discussions of inheritance of birds will be
clearly understood.
In the case of birds, unlike mammals, females are said to be the
heterogametic sex , since females have both an X and a Y chromosome
while males have both sex chromosomes of the X type, i.e. are
homogametic. This would mean, then, that sex-linked inheritance is
actually " X-linked " inheritance--mutant genes on the X-chromo-
some (the Y in most known cases does not carry any factors, but plays a
role in sex determination) cause certain recognizable traits. If this
mutant gene is recessive, or " masked " in its expression by the presence
of a wild-type or " normal " partner (usually symbolized with a " -j- "),
then a male exhibiting this mutant trait would require to have the
mutant gene present in both X-chromosomes in order for the mutant to
be recognized, or, in other words, be homozygous. If one X-chromosome
carries the mutant and the other the wild-type gene, the male is said to
be heterozygous , and cannot be distinguished from a wild-type male.
Since the female has only a single X-chromosome and does not have
a " partner ", the presence of a recessive X-linked mutant gene will
always be recognized. All females are said to be hemizygous.
When speaking of pairs of genes or " gene partners ", we are actually
referring to what geneticists call alleles. Instances are known in birds
(Asmundson, 1947) where different forms of a mutant are known.
Thus, if it can be established that more than one mutant gene can be
at the same locus of a chromosome, we say that we are dealing with
multiple alleles. Obviously, no more than two alleles can be present in
any one individual male. In the case of X-linked mutant alleles in
females, only one of the alleles can be present in any one individual.

50 R. AIUTO-SEX-LINKED COLOUR INHERITANCE IN THE ZEBRA FINCH
One other pertinent distinction should be made. All birds (and most
animals) are said to have two kinds of chromosome sets which show two
different kinds of inheritance. As mentioned, the X and Y chromosomes
are sex chromosomes ; all others are present in the organism in pairs and
are known as autosomes. Therefore, if a mutant gene is carried auto-
somally, the method of inheritance is the same, whether transmitted
through a male parent or a female parent. However, in X-linked
inheritance, a daughter always receives its X-chromosome from its j
father and its Y-chromosome from its mother ; a son receives one of its
X-chromosomes from its father and the other from its mother. An I
examination of Figures i and 2 will illustrate this difference.
Ease in using these concepts requires careful study over a period of
time. But, since this information is available and universally used by 1
scientists, it would be disappointing for intelligent aviculturists who 1
deal with equally subtle concepts to dismiss genetic terminology as I
bothersome, and to continue with the less precise avicultural termi-
nology.
Investigation of the X-Linked Mutants.
Having been an aviculturist for some time on a modest scale, and
having had some brief experience with the successful breeding of ;
relatively &amp;lt;c easy " species of foreign birds, I began to investigate the i
possibility of studying the inheritance in a particular species. However, !
it may be evident to more experienced Zebra Finch fanciers that my i
avicultural experience has not been as great as could be desired, since 1
some obvious misinterpretations, even after extensive reading and j
communication concerning the Zebra Finch, have crept into this study, i
These have, where known, been left in this report, since not only is
experimental rationale illustrated by these misinterpretations and their
recognition, but their presence clearly shows that future large-scale
studies in bird genetics, much more sophisticated than this, require the i
experience and knowledge of aviculturists who have specialized in the
keeping of the particular group being studied.
In gathering information on colour inheritance in Zebra Finches, I
Mr. Pope informed me that he had been unable to obtain chestnut-
flanked white progeny from nearly one hundred attempts of the i
mating of !
cfw -f males X cfw -f females
+ f
The males were assumed to be of the indicated genotypes, since they
had been derived from crosses involving homozygous fawn males and
hemizygous chestnut-flanked females. Furthermore, he states that these

R. AIUTO-SEX-LINKED COLOUR INHERITANCE IN THE ZEBRA FINCH 5
same results were obtained by other fanciers throughout the world, and
involved some thousand attempts. For some reason, then, these two
sex-linked mutants, when present in the same male, cannot be segre-
gated out in equal proportions, as expected, in the next generation.
That is to say, since daughters receive their single X-chromosomes
from their father, the expectations would be for half of the daughters
to receive the father's X-chromosome carrying f and half to receive
the father's other X carrying cfw ; daughters are hemizygous for any
X-linked mutant, so if any chestnut-flanked white females were
produced, they would be immediately recognized.
To a geneticist, this is a fascinating state of affairs ! Since Mr. Pope
had tried this cross repeatedly, the large number of progeny obtained,
without a single cfw daughter, rules out chance. Some genetic
mechanism must be operating. Of the countless known genetic
phenomena, the one that comes most readily to mind is multiple
allelism , that perhaps fawn and chestnut-flanked white are mutants at
the same locus on the chromosome. However, even more bizarre
phenomena could be hypothesized, as we shall see later.
From one mating (called " mating type 2 ") of a wild-type male
and fawn female, two unexpected daughter progeny were produced.
Both of these offspring were completely white, save for a few fawn
markings on their mantles. They were assumed to be w/w geno-
typically, even though my limited experience to date with cfw females
had been that they could not be readily distinguished from such w/w
i individuals, since the faint eye and tail markings of cfw individuals in
my possession had not always been present. Consequently, while more
 |experienced fanciers would not, I had to assume that these two
exceptional progeny of mating 2 must be either w/w or cfw/O
I genetically (see Table 1).
Figure 1 gives the alternative explanations for the results in terms of
genotypes, and, with the assumption that a new, previously unrecorded,
mutation had not occurred.
In either case, the male parent, although phenotypically wild-type,
must have been heterozygous for the autosomal recessive white, or
heterozygous for the sex-linked recessive chestnut-flanked white.
(I have indicated the heterozygosity of the second case as being in
terms of the same locus, although it is possible that f and cfw are not
alleles ; nevertheless, because of linkage, the expectations are similar.)
If the male parent was heterozygous for w, then the female must
also have been w/-\-, since white is not sex-linked and both members of
the pair of chromosomes must carry the mutant gene. The first
alternative suggested in Figure 1 would not normally be seriously
considered, since the probability of both parents being w/-\- is far less
than if only the male parent was heterozygous for cfw . However, both
parents came from the same dealer, and therefore there is a good

chance that both parents are related. Should the male parent in the |
first alternative of Figure i also be heterozygous for f (not assumed in
the diagram), these two female progeny could also be ww/O.

This last possibility is mentioned because of the few traces of fawn
feathers appearing on the mantle of the two young females, indicating
that in the presence of ww, f (homozygous or hemizygous) might be
incompletely penetrant. However, if cfw is a multiple allele of f, one
would not be surprised to see a few traces of fawn, since the two
alleles would presumably be at least two steps in the same pigment
synthesis pathway which are blocked. Nevertheless, the probability
that both female progeny in one clutch could be wwfO is small, being
less than 0-4 per cent (as compared to 6 per cent and 25 per cent in the
alternatives given in Figure 1).
Therefore, the second alternative is a strong possibility, although the
first cannot be ruled out. The relative merits of these hypotheses will

become clearer as the missing classes of progeny are obtained and
progeny-tested ; this may soon be possible, since the original parents
of this mating 2 are now incubating four eggs.
In the meantime, these two female progeny have been mated as
follows :--
mating 4 : fawn male X cfwO or ww female from mating 2
mating 5 : fawn male X cfwO or ww female from mating 2
The alternative expectations from matings 4 and 5 are given in Figure 2.
If, from any of the above matings, wild-type sons are obtained, and,
upon mating to a wild-type female, cfw and f daughters are produced,
then these two mutants are not alleles, nor is the mother ww , as
indicated in the first two alternatives of Figure 2. If/ and cfw are
alleles, these sons should be some other phenotype than wild, and the
question of dominance of one allele over the other would be settled.
Should the combination f/cfw in males give a fawn phenotype, one
would still be able to distinguish these from the fawn sons of the
second explanation in Figure 2, since the former fawn males would
produce some chestnut-flanked white daughters. Unfortunately, this
is where we began, since Mr. Pope was unable to obtain such
daughters ; hopefully, using wild-type mothers (rather than chestnut-
flanked white ones) might give results consistent with expectations.

Should wild-type sons produced in mating 4 and 5 produce white
progeny when mated to a sister, then these original female progeny
must be w/w, and we are not dealing with chestnut-flanked white
mutants at all.
If allelism is proved, or still strongly suspected on the basis of the
types of concomitant progeny obtained, then such extremely complex
explanations as " gene conversion " would have to be considered,
i.e. the/mutant converting the cfw mutant gene to its likeness when
both are present in the same male. Regardless, hypotheses suggesting
that cfw/O females are not produced because they are lethal when
produced from f/cfw fathers, or that the X-chromosome carrying the
cfw gene is preferentially excluded from the father's gametes, are not
tenable in explaining Mr. Pope's results. This is because, in the first
instance, that cfw/O females exist : this alone would prove that such
progeny are viable, whatever the parentage. In the second instance, it
must be pointed out that preferential exclusion of a chromosome from
the gametes can only take place in females, since, during egg formation,
only one of four replicated chromosomes eventually enters the egg ;
consequently, since the cfw mutant was coming from a male parent in
which all four products of sperm formation eventually end up as sperm,
this second explanation cannot be the case.
In conclusion, it would be of great interest to geneticists to discover
a case of sex-linked multiple allelism, and Zebra Finch fanciers can
provide a great service to the field of genetics by exploring this possi-
bility. As far as I have been able to determine from an extensive, but
by no means complete, review of the literature, no case of sex-linked
multiple allelism is known. (Several good cases of autosomally linked
multiple alleles are known in chickens and turkeys, and X-chromosomes
in these two groups have many mutant loci.) A possible case of sex-
linked multiple allelism in the previously mentioned Gouldian Finch
now appears to be the result of separate loci on different kinds of
chromosomes (Murray, 1963), involving a change in the action of a
mutant for face colour by the action of a second mutant locus which
blocks the production of a carotinoid oxidase enzyme (reported by
K. Immelmann, personal communication).

W. H. Collard (Natal Zoological Gardens, Durban, S. Africa)
We were interested to read the recent article in the magazine on the
misfortune in the attempted breeding of Maroon Tanagers as we have
at last been successful with this species. Our solitary pair had produced
two chicks from two eggs twice previously but each time they
disappeared after three or four days. We suspect that shrews were the
culprits. We would mention that these events took place in their, the
Tanagers, temporary enclosure.
The Tanagers were introduced to their new aviary in the zoo, on
26th June, 1963. This aviary measures 36 feet long, 16 feet wide, and
9 feet high, and is also occupied by Yellow-winged Sugar Birds,
Lazuli Buntings, Nonpariel Buntings, Morning Buntings, Black-
crested Finches, Marico, Tacazze and Golden-winged Sunbirds. This
enclosure has been planted entirely with tropical vegetation and has a
miniature waterfall and running stream. A rough cup-shaped nest was
built in a tree, about 5 feet from the ground, and the first egg was laid
on 12th September. On the 13th the second egg was laid and incuba-
tion commenced. The eggs, incidentally, were blue with dark spots. We
never at any time saw the cock on the nest so must presume that
incubation was carried out by the hen alone. Both eggs hatched on 26th
September, and feeding was carried out by both parents and although
a certain amount of live food was foraged in the aviary, additional food
in the form of mealworms and white ants was supplied. The parents
were often seen flying to the nest with small lumps of hard-boiled egg in
their beaks and we presume that this was also fed to the chicks.
One youngster left the nest, but was obviously much too young and
was unable to fly. The second left the nest two days later but stayed in
the tree very close to the nest. For four days we picked up the first chick
every evening and returned it to the nest but on the fifth, after a heavy
rainfall, it died. The survivor is now flying very strongly and in colour
is like the mother.

BREEDING RESULTS AT KESTON FOREIGN

Although by the time this goes to print it will be 1964 I think that
several events of interest ought to be recorded.
By far the most interesting event was the breeding of the young
albino Ringneck. With parrakeets, breeding is apt to be a little
uncertain with delays such as a bird taking three years to mature, and
a lot can happen in this time, which makes producing a new colour
variety even more arduous. Finally after obtaining the stock you want
to use, in this case two young Ringnecks, a lutino, and a green bred
from lutino X blue parents, you have to find the correct mates for them
and, last but not least, hope that when put together they will take to
each other. In all this we were most fortunate. The green was a cock
bird and we happened to have a spare adult blue hen. This latter bird
is of uncertain temper and a year older than the cock, and was very
difficult to pair-up the first breeding year--she nearly killed the first
cock bird I put with her, a split lutino cock. Anyway the young green
cock (split blue and split lutino) was introduced to her in the autumn
when, being a young bird, he was through the moult and the older hen
was in the middle of her moult, and this being the time when birds
show least aggression, things went according to plan. This pair went to
nest this year and produced the albino and a blue young one.
Now the lutino (lutino X blue), a hen, sister of the green cock, was a
bit more difficult to pair-up. We had no spare blue Ringneck cocks so
I paired her to an older green split blue cock who had produced only
one green youngster two years running, when mated to a blue hen.
Imagine our surprise and delight when these two birds, a visual green
and lutino (both split blue) produced three blue young. This made our

effort all so worth while, for any cocks among these three young blues
carry the albino factor and would be a perfect mate for the albino hen.
We also happen to have a spare young blue not yet fully adult, but
obviously a hen, to use in case there are two young cocks. So in three
years' time we should have three pairs of Ringnecks producing albinos,
not a bad start.
We also bred our quota of the other parrakeets, G.M. Rosellas,
Stanleys, Redrumps (normal and yellow), Mealy Rosellas, Layard's,
Blue Ringnecks, lutino Ringnecks, Bourke's, Turquoisines (and this
year we bred mostly cocks of these to make up for previous years),
Splendids (we have now a nice little stock of these), Leadbeater's
Cockatoos, Grey Parrots, and Amazon Parrots. Unfortunately the
Barrabands had all clear eggs and also the Cuban Amazons. We have
the second generation aviary bred of this latter species, but the cock
Cuban was not bred by us. Our best breeding pair of these lovely
parrots were both killed by a breeding pair of Grey Parrots, who bit
their way through from their adjoining aviary and attacked and killed
them both in the early morning.
Of the insectivorous and fruit-eating birds we bred more Blue-
shouldered Mountain Tanagers and also we had a pair of Orange-
rumped Tanagers go to nest and hatch one young one. This pair
carried nesting material about all through the summer and finally built
and laid two big heavily-mottled eggs during early October. The nest
was open and cup-shaped and built of hay, low down in a small privet
bush, very much like an English Blackbird's nest. We did not have a
great deal of hope over this venture, for the nest was rather exposed and
after the first cold night the youngster was found dead. It was about
five days old. We thought the parents were a pair but we have since
found out that the hen is a Yellow-rumped Tanager, a very closely
related sub-species, but we have, however, obtained a Yellow-rumped
cock to pair her with. So we hope for better things next year in this
quarter.
We also bred one young cock Rufous-bellied Niltava. We have had
young in past years from these pretty little Indian birds, but this is the
first time a young bird has been successfully reared. The Azure-winged
Magpie, a favourite of mine, laid infertile eggs this year, but this time
we think we have a more certain cock to pair her with which was bred
in Scotland by a member of the Society.
Our pair of Red-hooded Siskins (Carduelis cucullata ), those used for
producing red Canaries, went to nest this year but I could not get the
little hen to lay in a proper receptacle or build in a small thicket that
I made for them, and eventually she laid two or three eggs in the seed
dish. These I collected and put under my red factor Canaries and
under the Himalayan Greenfinches (Hypacanthis spinoides ) but they
did not hatch.

However, I was very pleased to have bred eight of these delightful
little greenfinches from two pairs--although why they are called Siskins
in all the Indian bird books I do not know, for they are true Greenfinches
in every way (song and courtship, etc.). I have had pairs of these
birds for several years now in a big planted aviary, with an albino
House Sparrow and her mate, but they made no serious attempt to
breed. It was probably because we had large quantities of chickweed
this year which I gave daily, and I also noticed they started eating the
bread and milk and gentles I was supplying for the Sparrows. I think
it is worth while mentioning the difference in sexes of this species, which
is very marked when you have adult pairs ; also I can understand why
the hens are mistaken for immature cocks, for they have quite striking
check marks and the breast is a distinct yellow for a hen bird.
Fledgling Himalayan Greenfinches are quite a dull flecked-green
colour and one can only sex them by the thickness of their head and
beak, the hens being slightly narrower and thinner.
The albino Sparrow and her mate had three nests and reared eight
young of which, to our disappointment, there was only one cock bird.
We lost one or two of the second nest through various misadventures,
but when they were ringed, in this case just before fledging, I thought
they were all hens. However, we now hope to rear some cock albino
House Sparrows with this young split albino cock, which we think
should be very pretty. Unfortunately we reared no young from our
Orange Firefinches, but still have a nucleus of breeding stock after five
years' effort.
I have also been struggling for a number of years with the wild
Canary or Serin (Madeira and the Canary Islands), the ancestor of the
domestic Canary, and we have managed to breed a few every year,
reared by domestic Canaries. The wild hens seem light sitters and desert
the nest very easily. They are delightful little birds, the size of an
English Linnet, but with a very powerful melodious Canary song. We
also bred a few Australian Common Bronze-wing Pigeons and numbers
of the Crested Bronze-wing, including several of the latter at liberty ;
also quite a few Triangular-spotted Pigeons, some of which take after
their male parent who is a form of dilute--they have very small spots and
an overall vinaceous colour. Finally we also have a sport of the Barbary
Dove which bred true to type--the White-breasted Barbary Dove.
A few have the odd white tail-feather, but mostly they are fawn on the
back with white under-parts--a very pretty combination. We lost our
breeding hen Giant Whydah last winter and the other hen made no
effort to breed this year.

The data for this paper was largely obtained during a recent visit to
Western Australia made by the author and a companion. The author
would like to take this opportunity to thank most sincerely Mr. J. O.
Mackay for his excellent field assistance throughout. Gratitude is also
extended to the Western Australian State Fauna Protection Authorities,
to Dr. D. L. Serventy, of the C.S.I.R.O.; Dr. G. F. Mees, formerly of the
Western Australian Museum ; Mr. J. Ford, State Secretary for the
R.A.O.U.; and Mr. R. Breeden, of Busselton, for their valuable aid.
Many graziers, farmers, and local inhabitants assisted in various ways.
The help of these people contributed largely to the scientific success of
this trip.

The western representative of the genus Barnardius is the Port
Lincoln Parrot. Originally described by Shaw in 1805 from a specimen
collected near Port Lincoln, S.A., it was named the Zoned Parrot
because of the yellow abdomen. This characteristic was also incor-
porated into the specific name, zonarius being tabulated. Possessing all
the properties of a broadtail it was later placed in the genus Platycercus,
where it remained until 1854, when Bonaparte instituted Barnardius.
The adult male Port Lincoln Parrot presents a striking plumage
coloration of green and yellow strongly offset by a grey-black head.
The back and wings are brilliant green, while bluish-green is the colour
of rump, upper tail-coverts and lesser wing-coverts. The outer wing-
coverts are yellowish-green. The primary coverts and primaries are
dark brown becoming paler at the tip, while the outer sides are dark
blue. The central tail feathers are green shading to blue at the tips,
while the secondary tail feathers are dark blue on the outer edges
changing to greenish-brown on the inner edges with very pale blue
tips, giving the characteristic Platycercine effect when the tail is fanned.
Dull black is exhibited by the head, nape, and upper ear-coverts, while
the lower ear-coverts are blue. There is a yellow collar on the hind
neck. The throat and chest are bluish-green, while the abdomen is
yellow merging to a yellowish-green on the under tail-coverts and vent.
Some individual birds will show a red frontal band and this will be
discussed fully later in this paper. It is a medium-sized bird showing
many size variations depending on the locality. The following measure-
ments obtained from specimens collected by the author near Balladonia,

used in this paper the distribution becomes very widespread, extending
from the Tennant Creek area of Northern Australia to Port Lincoln,
S.A., and across the southern parts of the continent to the central
portions of Western Australia.
S.A. White tabulated Barnardius zonarius myrtae in 1915 from a male
collected at Horseshoe Bend, Finke River, Central Australia. It was
reported to differ from B. z- zonarius in being a somewhat larger bird
and having a much brighter coloration throughout. The feathers of
the chest were a much brighter green while the rump and upper tail
coverts were a very bright yellowish-green. The range was given as
extending from Oodnadatta, S.A., north to the MacDonnell Ranges
and west to the Musgrave and Everard Ranges. This range was
subsequently enlarged by the field work of other ornithologists.
Although Mathews (1927) rejected this race, Peters (1937) and
Condon (1941 and 1962) accepted it as valid. The author is unable to
find any justification in the retention of this variation and must agree
with Mathews in making it synonymous with B. z- zonarius . Conflicting
reports on the plumage of the birds from the central regions seems to
indicate that the populations represented by White's original descrip-
tion are not constant. McGilp (1944) and others have stated that the
colours of the plumage of these birds were not as vivid or bright as those
of the southern representatives. The author carefully examined the
skins in the Australian Museum, Sydney, and could not find evidence
to uphold the validity of this race.
In 1830 Quoy and Gaimard described Barnardius zonarius semitorquatus
as a distinct species. This bird retained its specific status until i960
when the R.A.O.U. Checklist Committee correctly reduced it to form
a race of B. zonarius. This sub-species differs from the nominate race in
having the underparts entirely green, in its larger size and in the more
constant possession of a strong crimson frontal band. The larger size
is illustrated by the following measurements of two specimens collected
at Busselton, W.A., and Cranbrook, W.A., on the 14th March, 1963.

Bill greyish-white, iris dark brown, and feet grey. The range of this
race is restricted to the coastal forest areas of south-western Australia.
The existence of a geocline series connecting the typical race to
B. z* semitorquatus has given rise to disagreement among authorities
regarding the validity of two subspecies. Intermediate forms inhabit the
eastern region of central Western Australia. These birds show a
gradual size increase from east to west, while the plumage shows
affinities to both zonarius and z* semitorquatus.

Mathews, in 1912, tabulated Barnardius zonarius dundasi from a
specimen collected at Lake Dundas, W.A. This race was said to differ
from B. z * semitorquatus in lacking the red frontal band and from the
typical subspecies in the deep green of the upper surface. The range
was given as the County of Dundas, Western Australia.
From a specimen collected at Woolundra, Western Australia,
Mathews described Barnardius zonarius woolundra in 1919. This sub-
species was reported as differing from B. z* semitorquatus in having a
broad yellow band on the lower breast, in being much lighter on the
back and with the vent a much lighter green. No distribution was
given but it is apparent that the central wheat belt region east of Perth,
from whence the type was collected, was understood to be the range.
Peters (1937) recognized z . dundasi and declared z* woolundra to be a
synonym of it. Cain (1955) dismissed both these intermediate races.
Condon (1941) rejected z* woolundra , incorporating it into z* semi-
torquatus, and registered doubt as to the authenticity of z- dundasi ,
suggesting it should be combined with the typical subspecies. This
arrangement is completely unacceptable when the geographical
positions of the type localities are considered and the plumage
differences are carefully examined. Lake Dundas is further east than is
Woolundra and it is most difficult to formulate any theory explaining
how development of these races could have occurred holding affinities
to the ends of the clinal series most distant in geographical position.
Both z- dundasi and z . woolundra are completely variable in the yellow
of the abdomen and in the red frontal band.
During a recent visit to Western Australia the author examined very
carefully specimens of Barnardius zonarius from every locality, both in the
field and in the extensive skin collection at the Museum. The conclu-
sion drawn from these studies is that both z&amp;gt; dundasi and z . woolundra
should be incorporated into the nominate race. It is true that the
influence of z* semitorquatus may be obvious in both races, but these
populations resemble z&amp;gt; zonarius in having yellow on the abdomens.
This characteristic is the distinguishing feature, because the red
frontal band is completely variable even within the birds of the south-
western coastal forests and is often displayed as a sexual difference.
Neither z . woolundra nor #. dundasi is constant in its properties and hence
cannot be considered as a valid race. As each population has the
characteristic yellow on the abdomen, variable in size as it may be,
each must be placed in the appropriate subspecies, which is z- zonarius .
A. J. Campbell collected specimens of the Port Lincoln Parrot at
Champion Bay, Western Australia, in 1889 an d noticed that, although
they resembled the typical birds of South Australia, they were smaller
in size and much duller in colour. These specimens were forwarded
to Salvadori but he identified them as belonging to the nominate race.
In 1893 two specimens taken near Roebourne, north-western Australia

in 1889 were referred to A. J. North as immature B. z- zonarius. On
comparing these skins with those of the typical race in the Australian
Museum, North decided that they were, in fact, a distinct subspecies.
He therefore tabulated Barnardius zonarius occidentalis with a female from
Roebourne as the type. The smaller size and strong dilution of plumage
were the distinguishing features. This dullness in colour is particularly
noticeable in the blue of the lower ear-coverts and in the lemon-yellow
of the abdomen. The vent is also lemon-yellow instead of greenish-
yellow. The range of this acceptable race is north-western Australia.
From a bird taken at East Murchison, Western Australia, Mathews
described Barnardius zonarius connectens as the race inhabiting the
Murchison River district of W.A. It was reported to differ from
Z. occidentalis in having a darker rump and abdomen. These characters
were actually far too absolute in the description, as they are completely
variable in this population, which is intermediate between #. zonarius
and z- occidentalis. This lack of uniformity in its plumage renders this
subspecies unacceptable and it should be dismissed.

General Discussion
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.99394232" page_id="56317726"  page_num="63" year="" vol="">
Barnardius zonarius enjoys a very widespread range, being found from
Eyre Peninsula, South Australia, north to Tennant Creek, across the
southern part of Australia to the south-western coastal areas and north
along the immediate west coast to Onslow, W.A. Throughout this
range the bird is quite common and in some areas almost reaches
plague proportions. As may be expected with such a vast distribution,
all types of country ranging from arid Mulga and Myall areas to dense
coastal forests are inhabited by this species.
All B. zonarius , irrespective of plumage, inhabiting Western Australia
are known in that state as Twenty-eight Parrots. This name originated
from the phonetic translation of the call of B. z. semitorquatus . This call
is more or less restricted to the birds of the forest areas of the south-west.
These birds, the true #. semitorquatus , are found south-west of a line
from Perth to just west of Albany. In this paper the name Twenty-eight
Parrot refers to the " all-green " bird from this restricted humid zone.
Whenever the Port Lincoln Parrot is met with in the field one seems
to obtain the opinion that it is a very strong species and is much
superior to the other member of the genus. One of the foremost reasons
for this impression is the adaptability of the species regarding habitat.
It is plentiful in the rich coastal forests, in the semi-arid Eucalyptus
dominant wheat-growing areas, in the arid Heath, Mulga, and Acacia
regions, and in the very dry, sparsely vegetated spinfex country in the
north of Western Australia. In all these regions the bird is plentiful and
is maintaining its numbers.

impresses the field observer as one of the most striking of Australia's
birds. The black head bordered by a vivid yellow collar stands out
strongly against the natural surroundings making the bird somewhat
easy to observe. Unlike B. harnardi it is quite a noisy species and this also
tends to further simplify its detection. The birds are usually found
feeding on the ground or in the branches of trees and shrubs. When
disturbed they call excitedly and proceed to investigate the danger
before flying away. When in flight the brilliant green of the body and
the deep blue on the primaries are exhibited to perfection.
The flight is undulating and comparatively swift. The wings are left
extended between beats as the bird flies close to the ground. When
alighting the tail is fanned as with the other broadtails. The Twenty-
eight Parrot often flies at a considerable height over the topmost
branches of the tall forest trees.
The usual call of the Port Lincoln Parrot is a high-pitched whistle
note repeated several times in quick succession. It is of a slightly
higher pitch than that of B. barnardi. B. z * semitorquatus also has a three
note call with the last note of a higher pitch than the first two. This
call resembles the words " twenty-eight " and is responsible for this
vernacular appellation being given to the race. A harsh screech-like call
is given when alarmed, while a soft chattering will often be emitted
when feeding.
Undoubtedly one of the major properties permitting the wide range
of habitats is the adaptation this species shows in its feeding habits. The
birds of the inland drier regions feed on seeds of grasses and herbaceous
plants, while the inhabitants of the south-west forest area show a marked
preference for fruits of Eucalyptus and other native trees. The stomach
and crop contents of the afore-mentioned birds collected by the author
at Balladonia and Dowerin, W.A., consisted of eucalyptus seeds, small
grass seeds, and some vegetable matter. Three specimens collected in
Central Australia in 1935 had small grass seeds, vegetable matter, and
grit in their crops. On the other hand the crops of the two specimens of
B. z- semitorquatus mentioned above contained vegetable matter, pieces
of Eucalyptus fruit, pieces of berries from the White Cedar Tree ( Melia
azederach ) and a few small grass seeds. This preference for succulent
fruits and berries has been illustrated by all observations carried out
on the feeding of the Twenty-eight Parrot. Robinson (i960) gives a
detailed account of these birds feeding on the fruit of the Marri
(.Eucalyptus calophylla) . They attack the fruit when about half ripe and
tear it apart with their powerful bills. They also remove the outer
covering of the fruit just prior to its ripening. Unlike the Red-capped
Parrot (Purpureicephalus spurius) B. z . semitorquatus is not interested in the
hardened bowl-like ripe nuts. The Twenty-eight Parrot is also very
quick to investigate the food value of all non-indigenous plants.

large quantities, thus necessitating the destruction of many birds by
orchardists and farmers. It rivals the lorikeets in the quantity of nectar
consumed while the gums are in flower. The flowers are crushed in the
bill and the nectar thus obtained consumed. One specimen, collected
from a flock feeding on the flowers of a Karri (Eucalyptus diversicolor ),
gave a flow of nectar from the bill when held up by the feet. These noisy
large green birds with their black heads and brilliant yellow collars
present an unforgettable sight when observed feeding in numbers in a
large flowering tree.
Generally to be considered a resident species, the Port Lincoln
Parrot is subject to some movement in the inner areas. This movement
is governed by the availability of water. As the dry period approaches,
the birds of the desert and sandhill country of the inland regions retreat
to the large rock-holes which hold water throughout the year. In other
areas they will often travel long distances each day to drink.
With the possible exception of B. z- semitorquatus, the Port Lincoln
Parrot is not an easy bird to sex. Immatures and females are generally
duller than the males, particularly in the black of the head. Immatures
are usually distinguishable in the difference of the upper mandible.
The female has a narrow pointed mandible while that of the male is
broad and rounded. However, this difference becomes less noticeable
as the birds mature. The Twenty-eight Parrot is somewhat easier to
sex, the males being very large birds with a flat head and a massive
broad bill, while the female has a small rounded head and narrow
pointed bill. The male of this race almost invariably possesses a vivid
crimson frontal band while those of the females and immatures are
considerably reduced in both extent and intensity. With the other races
the red on the forehead is completely variable, but most immatures
show at least a few red feathers. The " wing-stripe 55 is of little
importance with this species. All immature females show the stripes
but the majority of males do not have it. It is absent in all adult males
and most mature females. This species differs markedly from B. barnardi
in the loss of the " wing-stripe ".
As would be expected the mating display resembles very closely that
of the Mallee Ringneck Parrot. The male bows slightly before the
female and raises the wings in the folded position. The tail is fanned and
moved from side to side in a most agitated manner. The head is often
bobbed up and down accompanied by a constant chattering call. As
the breeding season approaches much fighting and arguing breaks out
as pairs seek nesting sites and set up breeding territories.
August and September reward the observer with records of feverish
activity as the birds inspect prospective nesting hollows. Every hollow
limb and hole in the branches of Eucalyptus trees is inspected by the
homeseekers. The parrot will poke his head into the entrance to the
hollow and if it has possibilities he will enter for a careful examination.

These actions are accompanied by much noisy chattering and tail-
wagging. On selecting a suitable nesting hollow the birds set about
preparing it for the laying of the eggs. The bottom is lined with
powder-fine decayed wood and a shallow excavation is made for the
eggs. The hollow itself may be in a dead or living tree and at varying
heights from the ground. In favourable seasons, when a very high
nesting population is evident, hollows in stumps and fence posts are
used.
During his recent travels through the Western Australian wheat-belt
areas the author noticed the large numbers of hollows in the Salmon
Gums (Eucalyptus salmonophloia) . It was readily perceived that this
ample supply of nesting sites was available almost entirely to the Port
Lincoln and Regent ( Polytelis anthopeplus) Parrots. With the absence of
the introduced Starling ( Sturnus vulgaris) and House Sparrow ( Passer
domesticus) these parrots are at a distinct advantage and this lack of
formidable opposition in finding nesting sites undoubtedly contributes
largely to the abundance of these psittacines.
Four to seven, usually five, pure white eggs are laid. These are
rounded oval in shape with a fine texture and a glossy surface. However,
this glossy surface is quickly lost through nest staining. An egg with
the measurements i * 21 in. x 0*93 in. would be average. The eggs of
B. z * semitorquatus are slightly larger, the average measurements being
1 * 24 in. X i*o in.
The female commences incubation after the laying of the second egg.
She sits for approximately three weeks before the eggs hatch. During
this time the male usually roosts in a nearby tree ready to give warning
of any danger. He is joined by his mate for short periods in the early
morning and late afternoon when food and water are taken. White
down covers the newly-hatched nestlings. During the first few days the
young are very closely brooded by the female, but as they progress the
cock assumes his share of domestic duties. The young leave the nest
approximately five weeks after hatching and remain with their
parents. After leaving the nest and while learning to fend for themselves
the new arrivals are fed regurgitated food by their parents.
As to be expected young birds and family parties may be observed
at varying times of the year throughout the different regions. The usual
breeding season for the southern and central populations extends from
August to February, and if conditions are favourable two broods will be
reared. Birds from the northern extremities of the range generally
commence breeding as early as June or July.
Because of its abundance in the natural state, the Port Lincoln
Parrot is not often bred in captivity in this country. However, it is kept
successfully in many overseas countries and appears to be a more
satisfactory species than the Mallee Ringneck Parrot. New arrivals
should, of course, be carefully guarded against chills, but once settled

down they are very hardy and should thrive given suitable conditions.
As with B. barnardi this species is very pugnacious towards other birds
and spends much time tearing apart perches and any timber framework
in the aviary. B. z- semitorquatus is by far the worst offender in both
spheres.
In Western Australia this bird is commonly kept in cages because of
its whistling capabilities. Nestlings are then hand-reared, but as they
mature they become fearless in their disposition and quite hostile.
Hand-reared birds seldom make satisfactory breeding stock for an
aviary.
The diet of captive birds should be a well balanced composition of
seeds, fruit, and green food. The seed mixture recommended is
sunflower seeds, oats, wheat, plain canary seed, and millet in the
proportions of 2 : 1 : 1 : 2 : 1, while maize (corn) will be eaten by
most birds. Fruit in the form of apples, grapes, oranges, and cherries
should be offered regularly. Berries from shrubs such as Pyracantha
and Hawthorn will be appreciated, while a daily supply of twigs and
leaf-bearing branches will satisfy the bird's whittling desires. This
species will often accept mealworms and aviculturists should experi-
ment with this. A plentiful supply of green food and grit should be
maintained.
For breeding purposes a pair of B. zonarius should be placed in a
separate flight, which is far removed from any aviary containing other
members of the Platycercinae. A choice of nesting logs and boxes should
be encouraged and once nesting has commenced the birds should be
disturbed only when necessary. If the female commences to sit on a
second clutch of eggs the young of the first nest should be removed from
the aviary as soon as possible.
Hybridization involving this species is comparatively rare both in
the natural state and in aviculture. Hybrids with Barnardius barnardi
and the Platycercus sp. are most frequently bred in captivity. There are
records of inter-subspecific breeding but these are of little importance.
Whether observed rising from the borders of an outback country
road, flying through the giant Jarrah ( Eucalyptus marginata ) trees,
feeding on a spinifex covered sand dune, roosting in a Mallee Gum, or
strutting through the stubble of a recently harvested wheat crop, the
Port Lincoln Parrot presents a striking contrast against the
surroundings. A vivacious manner further enhances this bird's appeal
and makes Barnardius zonarius one of the most impressive of " the parrots

<bodyText confidence="0.941097175" page_id="56317736"  page_num="69" year="" vol="">
By Holger Poulsen, (Curator of Birds at Copenhagen Zoological
Gardens, Denmark)
" Scaly-legs " is a well-known disease in domestic fowls and it also
occurs among cage birds. Recently attention has been called to this
foot-abnormality among wild birds (cf. Herman et al., 1962;
MacDonald, 1962). This foot-disease is caused by mites of the genus
Cnemidocoptes which live in the skin of the bird's leg. There is
excessive proliferation of the epithelium with formation of white crusts
\ which raises the scales. We have had much trouble with this disease in
a big outdoor aviary in which we keep a collection of native Danish
seed-eating passerines. Now and then a bird is observed with thickened
white crusts on one or both legs, sometimes found both on tarsus and
toes. The extent and position of the lesions associated with cnemidocoptic
mange vary. They usually start immediately below the feathers and
progress to cover the entire tarsus and foot. Sometimes as a result of
this condition the bird might lose one or more toes or the whole foot.
In most cases the disease is observed in the beginning of its appearance,
but it is not easy always to discover the first stage of the disease.
A more advanced condition of the disease is discovered by the peculiar
way the birds are sitting on the branches. They are sitting as if they
feel cold on their feet, in a very low position, covering their feet with
their belly feathers. Two infected Bramblings ( Fringilla montifringilla)
were killed and submitted to professor M. Christiansen at the Royal
Veterinary College, Copenhagen, who made a microscopic examination
and found mites which he identified as Cnemidocoptes mutans. This mite
is the cause of scaly-legs in poultry. Not all species which we keep in
this aviary seem to be prone to this disease. It is mostly found in
the Chaffinch (. Fringilla coelebs), Brambling (. Fringilla montifringilla ),
Bullfinch ( Pyrrhula pyrrhula) , European Siskin ( Carduelis spinus) , Redpoll
(Carduelis flammea) , Twite ( Carduelis flavirostris) , Linnet ( Carduelis
cannabina) and Skylark ( Alauda arvensis). Curiously enough it has not
been found in the Yellowhammer ( Emberiza citrinella ), Snow Bunting
(.Plectrophenax nivalis ), Greenfinch ( Chloris chloris) and Goldfinch
( Carduelis carduelis) which are in the same aviary.
As it is a very contagious disease, we watch the birds frequently to
discover new cases, and the aviaries are cleaned very often and new
branches put in. If the bird has been found in a not too advanced stage
of the disease we have treated the sick birds by rubbing or painting the
infected parts with salicyl-oil about every second day for some time. After
some weeks the bird recovers again and has normal feet.

By Charles Everitt (Trenton, N. J., U.S.A.)
A most colourful bird, with its rich cinnamon-rufous and slate-grey,
the Natal Robin, Cossypha natalensis natalensis, also known as the Red-
capped Robin Chat, is to be found over a wide area in Africa, ranging
from the Sudan and Abyssinia, in the Congo and Angola, down into
Southern Rhodesia, Transvaal, and Natal. Normally with a species
with such a wide distribution, sub-species are designated from the
various regions, but the only one of which I am aware is the race in the
Kenya Colony, the Cossypha n. intensa. However, it is with the nominate
race that I am here concerned.
It is about 7 to 8 inches in total length and the sexes are very
similar. The adult male has a cap of cinnamon-brown, the mantle
being of the same colour except that it is finely marked with slate.
The wings are slate-blue and the sides of the face, the rump, and the
entire underparts are rich cinnamon-rufous. The tail also, except for
the central feathers, is cinnamon-rufous, those feathers and the edges
of the outer tail feathers being black. The female is slightly paler on
the underparts and often is smaller also, but the variations are so slight
that to sex accurately an individual bird by coloration and size alone
would be very debatable. They both have a pleasing song, the male's
being stronger and more varied, and their powers of mimicry are
amazing. They can pick up the tune of a human whistle and seem
happy in partaking in a call and reponse session. Further, they have a
certain limited ventriloquial gift which can be very confusing when
trying to locate them by sound alone.
A true pair of these birds was received by Mr. Boehm from East
Africa in September, i960. After a period in the acclimatisation room
they were placed in a planted aviary that, at that time, housed pairs
each of Fairy Blue Birds, Bronzy Sunbirds, Blacksmith Plovers, and
Golden-backed Woodpeckers. This was early in 1961 and, later in the
year, the two last-named species were removed to other quarters.
The remaining six birds were very harmonious one to the other, but no
movements in the way of going to nest were made by any of them during
that year, nor the following. However, in May, 1963, the Fairy Blue
Bird female started to build a nest in a hemlock on one side of the
aviary. At the same time the Bronzy Sunbirds began to construct a
hanging nest in a crab-apple tree on the other side. To avoid any
clashing between the two nest-building species, it was decided to
divide the aviary in two, thus restricting their area to 16 by 20 feet, the
Natal Robins being left in with the Sunbirds . The fact that the Fairy
Blue Birds went on with their good work is recorded in the article on
their breeding in Avicult. Mag., Vol. 70, No. 1, p. 18. The Bronzy

Sunbirds also finished their nest and laid, but the chick that hatched
was not reared to maturity.
It was in July that the female Natal Robin was seen carrying nesting
material but, being very shy and retiring birds, immediately anyone
approached they used to disappear into the trees and shrubs. Although
all these were examined carefully, no signs of a nest under construction
could be found. It was not until i ith July, when the first egg was laid,
that the nest was discovered, for the female was seen to leave a hole,
about 8 feet above ground level, in a hollow tree-stump originally
placed in the aviary for the benefit of the Woodpeckers mentioned
earlier. It was only with the aid of a flashlight that the egg and nest
could be seen, for the hole was 9 to 10 inches in depth. The nest
appeared to be of the open-cup type, resting at the bottom of the hole
and made up of dried grasses. Three eggs were laid in all, on successive
days, and incubation began with the laying of the last. In the light of
the electric hand-torch the eggs appeared to be coffee-coloured but,
when an empty shell was picked up later, it could be seen that they
were blue, washed with olive-green, and heavily mottled in brown, the
basic colour being almost completely obscured. Allowing for the
missing cap, it was assessed that they must have measured about
21 by 16 mm.
Although it cannot be stated conclusively, it did appear that the
incubation was by the female alone, since this was the only bird ever
seen to enter or vacate the nest during that period. As she left the nest
immediately anyone entered the aviary, it was looked into each
morning and, on 27th July, three tiny chicks were to be seen. They
appeared to be covered with brown fluff and had bright yellow gapes,
margined in orange. Both parents fed the young in the nest, entirely
on live-food consisting of moths, insects, and mealworms, the male, if
anything, doing the major portion although he never stayed to brood
the nestlings, this being done by the female. Their eyes were open
at six days old and brown feathering, mottled with black, began to
form on their backs but, owing to the fact that they huddled close
together in the bottom of the nest as soon as the light was turned on to
them, it was not possible to get really definite details of this feathering-
up in the nest.
At twelve days old, on 8th August, all three vacated the nest and it
then could be seen that they closely resembled fledgeling European
Robins, being yellowish-brown, heavily mottled with black. Their tails,
however, small as they were, were bright rufous, the central pair of
feathers being black. Although the young birds were kept to the lower
branches of the trees by the male Bronzy Sunbird, they progressed
rapidly and the parents soon began to feed them ground raw beef in
addition to the live-food. By the time they were three weeks old the
mottling had started to clear from the underparts and their flight

feathers had changed to slate-grey. They were independent at four
weeks old and, as the male Sunbird was still as persistent as ever in
chasing them around, they were caught up and removed to the cage
room. It was interesting to note that, despite the belligerent harassing
by the Sunbird, neither parent Natal Robin ever attempted to go to
the aid of the young birds, and neither were they themselves ever
bothered by the Sunbird.
On removal, the young birds were caged separate from each other
and full adult plumage was obtained at three months old. At this stage
it looks as though they may well be two males and one female. If this
proves itself, it will fit in very well with Mr. Boehm's future breeding
plans, for he has one spare adult female and it may be possible, there-
fore, to breed the third generation without having to recourse to
inbreeding.

By John Mallet (Curator of Birds, Jersey Zoological Park)
In 1962 Mr. Jeremy Mallinson, Deputy Director, returned from
a collecting trip to a place 80 miles north of Maun, N'Gamiland, Bee.
Prot. Among the many specimens he brought back were three pairs
and two female Red-billed Francolins (Chaetopus adspersus), a species
not common in zoological collections. A pair of these were presented
to the Zoological Society of London, where they proved to be a species
new to their collection. They are the size of a partridge, short-tailed,
speckled grey all over, with red bills and red legs, and a yellow fleshy
circle round the eye.
Those at the Jersey Zoological Park (which is now the headquarters
of the Jersey Wildlife Preservation Trust) were housed in an aviary,
25 by 8 feet wide, the floor of which is covered with a thick layer of peat.
They shared the aviary with a mixed collection of smaller birds and
soon settled down well. Their diet consisted of : wheat, Layers pellets,
cut maize, bread and milk, hard-boiled egg, diced fruit.
They arrived in May, 1962, and courtship between the cocks and
the hens was noticed early the following year. The cock bird would puff
his feathers out and make short runs around the hen ; actual copulation
was not witnessed. The first egg was laid on the 26th February, 1963 :
about the size of a bantam's egg, it was more sharply pointed and was
a dull biscuit-brown in colour. It was obvious that the hen bird was not
going to sit, so the eggs--six in all--were removed and placed under
a Silky. One proved infertile, but the other five hatched successfully
after a twenty-two days' incubation period. The young closely
sembled Golden pheasant chicks in colouring and shape. They were

fed, to begin with, on chick crumbs with plenty of mealworms, and
within a few days hard-boiled egg and chick mash was added to their
diet. They also had bread and milk mixed with maw seed and chopped
lettuce. At nine days old they started to eat millet and canary seed and
at eight to nine weeks seed and Growers pellets. They were kept in
a movable wire run on a lawn.
As chicks their beaks and feet were brown, but in May they started
moulting into their adult plumage and their beaks and legs changed to
the adult red.
On the 18th August it was noticed that the spurs were starting to
grow on the young cock birds and by the 28th September the young
cocks were displaying and endeavouring to tread the hens.
Since then several clutches of eggs have been laid and successfully
reared and so we now have a thriving colony of fourteen Red-billed
Francolins.
In October, 1963, a pair of these were sent in exchange to Rotterdam

Two species new to the collection have recently been received. These
are a pair of Australian White-eyed Duck (. Aythya a. australis) that were
bred in the Wildfowl Trust's collection and a pair of Shelley's Francolin
(Francolinus s. shelleyi) presented by Mr. J. O. D'eath.
There are two races of Aythya australis , one inhabiting Australia,
Tasmania, New Zealand, New Guinea and as far westward as eastern
Java and the other, which differs in being smaller, lives on Banks
Island and " probably New Caledonia and the New Hebrides "
according to Delacour. There are four races of Francolinus shelleyi in
eastern and south-eastern Africa.
Other arrivals of particular interest include two Gentoo and three
Ringed (Bearded or Chinstrap) Penguins presented by the Captain
and ship's company of H.M.S. Protector and sent by air from Monte-
video. Mr. Tom Spence presented a pair of Capercaillie, a pair of
Picazuro Pigeons, a Naked-eyed Pigeon, an Eastern Turtle Dove and a
Lemon Dove. An Osprey, sent from Aden, was rescued from some
local people by Chief Technician Haigh of the R.A.F. who kept the
bird in the hope of being able to release it later, but its flight feathers
had been so badly damaged that this could not safely be done.
A Javan Brahminy Kite which attracted some publicity last autumn
by its exploits around the Bromley area of Kent has been presented.

including the Keston Foreign Bird Farm. It was blamed for the
disappearance of goldfish from garden ponds and as it was, presumably,
in some danger of being shot, it was brought here where it lives in the
Southern Aviary with another of the same subspecies that was pre-
sented in 1957.

Mme. G. Swaenepoel informs me that there is at present a collection
of twelve blue Quaker Parrakeets Myiopsitta monachus being offered for
sale in Belgium. The price asked is approximately #175 a pair, but
the owner wishes to sell the whole collection to one person as he cannot
guarantee the sexes.
These birds are the descendants of the blues that were in the collec-
tion of the late M. J. Bruyneel when it was dispersed in 1959.

In the last number of the Magazine there was a " wanted "
advertisement for the red wing-feathers from Touracos. Why are these
required ? A crimson animal pigment is found in the wing-feathers
of several species of birds of the genera Turacus , Gallirex, and Musophaga.
It is closely allied to haemoglobin, but free from iron, and containing
over 7 per cent of copper. The turacin is extracted from the feathers
and then converted to a porphyrin compound which is of use in medical
research.

property.
I vividly remember Mme. Pavlova because, in anticipation of her
return from an Australian tour with a collection of birds, George
Hedges (formerly curator to Mme. Lecallier) and I constructed a very
elaborate glass aviary within a conservatory. Great was the excitement
when, to the accompaniment of popping corks, the birds were even-
tually liberated from their travelling cages.
In the garden there is a miniature lake which used to have a swan.
It has often been said that Mme. Pavlova perfected her " Dying
Swan " dance by studying the movements of the swan. This I have
always thought to be fantasy. It is just as likely that the swan, watching
Pavlova rehearsing on the terrace, would have gained something
from her !

Charles Lucas, President, Avicultural Society of Australia, writes
(17th December, 1963) : " The breeding season is now almost ended
here and I have had good results.
" In May I got a nest of three young Hoodeds but unfortunately
later lost the hen and one of the young ; the father and the other two
young are thriving. The Smokers (Regent) produced a nest of three
beautiful young which have been flying for about a month and they are
all delightful birds. The Princess have a total of nine young all just out
of the logs ; for some reason I lost no less than five in the logs. The
Crimson-wings and the Barrabands have not nested to date although
being driven by their respective husbands. There is, however, still time
for them to go. I have also reared six Splendids and a small tally of
Bourkes and Turquoisines. Another pleasing result is nine young
Red-faced Parrot Finches. The Spinifex Doves again let me down,
after giving me three nests of two each in 1961. I have also got seven
well-grown Silver Pheasants, and the Swinhoe has just started to brood
a clutch of seven eggs, after getting nothing from her first round a few
weeks ago. The Peach-faced and Nyasa Lovebirds have been breeding
all the year round and I have been able to keep several fanciers supplied
with these birds for some time now, thereby making a substantial
contribution to the seed bill."

Left- and Right-footedness Equally Prevalent in Halfmoon Parrakeets
I have kept between twelve and twenty-four Halfmoon or Orange-fronted Parrakeets
(Aratinga c. camcularis and A. c. eburnirostrum ) in captivity for nearly five years and in the
course of behavioural studies noted prevalence of footedness. In these birds, either
foot may be raised to the head or to the body to be chewed or to scratch, but in a given
individual either the right foot or the left is used exclusively for purposes of holding
food or any other object to be taken in the mouth. About half the birds are left-footed

and half right. Under no circumstances has an individual been recorded using the
44 wrong " foot. It is hoped that in the future, when we have successfully bred captives,
that studies of the ontogeny of footedness and its neurological bases can be carried out.
I should appreciate communications from readers of the Avicultural Magazine
concerning their observations of footedness in these and related species of parrots.--

TREATING 'EM ROUGH

Rough." I have visited many bird fanciers and dealers who keep, and some even
breed, birds of all kinds in most unsuitable conditions; some were in filthy surroundings,
but looked well I must admit.
For one year before coming over here to Jersey Zoo I worked under 44 The
Milligans " learning a lot in the care of pheasants.
I feel that if more people were as meticulous in the care of their birds, many would
live to a greater age and better success in breeding would be obtained. As for dis-
couraging novices, if a person is not prepared to give a lot of time and trouble to his
birds, he should not keep them. As far as unnecessary hard labour is concerned it was
not so, to my mind. Only one bird was ill and whilst I was there it died, but it was
not in very good condition when it arrived a few weeks earlier.
I for one had to scrub the various dishes. I agree that gallinaceous birds do
prefer food off the ground, but I have never known one refuse it out of a dish. The
time taken to feed was approximately 40 minutes twice a day. Also I cannot
remember seeing any stale or mouldy food lying on the ground, which if eaten could
cause complications.
The aviaries were 72 feet long by 18 feet wide. Each one contained a large shed
and several bushes, including a large larch tree. The sheds were very seldom used by
the birds, only the more delicate ones were shut in at night in winter. Up to four birds
were kept in each aviary, except when the young stock from the rearing field were
brought in. The droppings under the roosts were cleared away only when gaining
height.
During the breeding season, the Milligans worked until dusk caring for the young
stock, losing the odd one, but rearing 99 per cent to maturity.
I also used the rotorcycle to cut the tall grass, which saved me getting wet searching
for eggs. The birds were disturbed as little as possible, usually running to the far end
of the aviary away from the machine seeking cover, and then when one-half of the
aviary had been cut they were carefully driven to the other end. If the grass was left
to grow a bird could die, and perhaps not be noticed for days.
Surely this is unhygienic to say the least.
May I say the Milligans were very conscientious workers and only asked one to do
what they themselves did.

(Grandala coelicolor)
ByJ. J. Yealland (London, England)
The Blue Snow Chat, or Grandala, inhabits the Himalayas and
mountains of Tibet, western China, and northern Burma, living at
altitudes of from 10,000 to 17,000 feet. Salim Ali ( The Birds of Sikkim ,
pp. 254-6), says that in Sikkim it lives between 15,000 and 17,000 feet,
" hardly descending in winter unless forced down temporarily by heavy
snowfalls and severe weather, and then not below c. 9,000 feet."
He goes on to say that it is gregarious, keeping in closely packed
flocks sometimes (in winter) of several hundred birds. At Lachen in
February, 1952, a flock of more than a thousand was seen " circling high
over the valley " and from time to time dropping " like rain more or
less in unison to settle on the tall leafless trees, covering the top branches
in dense clusters like starlings at the roost. Every little while, for no
apparent reason, the swarm would suddenly take wing, circle aloft,
and tumble again into another tree . . The birds were at that time
feeding #C exclusively on the abundant, sour, juicy berries of Hippophae
salicifolia . . The birds were observed to favour certain areas, while
equally laden thickets in neighbouring ravines were ignored. Other
berries and insects are eaten. The female is brown, streaked with pale
brown above and below, except on the throat and tinged with blue on
the rump and upper tail coverts. There are white spots and tips on the
brown wing feathers. In some flocks a large proportion of males have
been seen and in others mainly brown-plumaged birds. Little appears
to be known of the nesting habits and Salim Ali says that there is no
record for Sikkim : he also says that " Apparently flocks do not break
up into pairs for breeding, neither do they nest in colonies ".
The more easterly birds are smaller and the males of a brighter blue.
These populations are named Grandala coelicolorflorentes.

Introduction
This paper is based on some captive specimens of the south-eastern
form of the Dark Firefinch, Lagonosticta rubricata haematocephala. An
adult wild-caught pair was purchased in August, 1962, and these
reared two broods of young which were kept till mature. The adult
female died from an injury in January, 1963. A male and female of the
young of the first brood were kept and they and the original male are
still alive and well (February, 1964). These observations thus have the
drawback of being made on only a few individuals. On the other hand
they are based on daily observation extending over a considerable
period on birds that are known individually. Lagonosticta rubricata
haematocephala is very similar to the other eastern forms of this species and
is the most beautiful race of its species. Larger than a Common
Firefinch (. Lagonosticta senegala ), cobby, rather than otherwise, in shape
with a rather longish bill (for a waxbill), shortish, broad tail, and dense,
lustrous feathering. The male has the head and hind neck a beautiful
dark mauvish-pink which shades into a dark ruby-red on the breast and
under-parts (except for the black belly and under tail-coverts) and
dark brown, washed with mauve-red, on the back. The wings and tail
are dark brown, the tail feathers washed with red. The rump and upper
tail-coverts are crimson. There are short rows of shining, but small
white spots on each side of the lower breast which, at a close view, add
a perfect finishing touch to the male's dark but glowing beauty. The
eyes are encircled by narrow, rose-pink orbital skin. The bill is
bluish-grey with blackish tip and blackish along the cutting edge of
the mandibles. The female is paler and less richly red. Her breast and
under-parts are mainly an attractive rosy buff. Her orbital skin is
usually dull pink and brownish-buff in colour. In both sexes the
orbital skin grows pale if the birds are not in good condition. The
newly-fledged juveniles are brown except for their wine-red rumps and
upper tail-coverts. They have short, dark bills and the ring of pale
skin round the eye is more conspicuous than in the adult. The young
males have a rosy flush on the breast that is only noticeable in a good
light.
History of Individuals
My bird room being, as usual, rather over-full ; I put the Dark
Firefinches in a cage in the spare bedroom. This cage stands in a recess

by the window and is about o.\ feet square by 3S feet high. The birds
were allowed to fly freely about the upper part of the house, at least
every other day, but were shut in their cage at night. They were
rather wild but seemed (no doubt due to their cover-haunting habits)
to be " pre-adapted " to the chaos of a bachelor's rooms and provided
I was not in their immediate vicinity, appeared thoroughly at home,
hopping about under beds, into cupboards, and over piles of discarded
garments or darting in twisting flight from one room to another.
Almost as soon as I got them, both birds began to moult. This was a
" heavy " and obvious moult such as one finds in most British passerines
and in the Golden-breasted Waxbill, not the sort of slow, almost invisible
moult that adult Blue Waxbills (Uraeginthus sp.) usually have, at least in
captivity. By the beginning of September both were in full moult and
the male had begun to attack the female when she was shut in the cage
with him. Hitherto they had appeared to be paired. They had roosted
together and indulged in mutual preening. Now the female was
very frightened of the male and distressed when shut in the cage with
him, although whenever she was out of his sight, as when they were in
different rooms, she would soon begin to give her Whistling Calls (see
section on voice) in an apparent attempt to keep in vocal contact with
him. The male did not usually deign to reply and appeared to feel no
" loneliness " when he was the sole occupant of a room. On the evening
of the 21 st he went into a cage in my bedroom and roosted there instead
of in his usual place (previously both Firefinches had roosted at first in
the same, and later in separate, wicker nest-baskets in their own cage)
so I left him there for a time, liberating him and the female on different
days. I thought that a little enforced separation might make them
appreciate one another's company more, as it often does in other bipeds.
By mid-September the male was frequently " singing " (see section
on voice) in a sotto voce manner. However, on the morning of
23rd September, just as my room was beginning to turn from black to
grey in the first light of dawn, he began loud Contact Calling. As the
clear, rich, nightingale-like notes rang through the room I was amazed
and lay listening, entranced to this " music from the African jungle "
until the interrogative (and to my ears reproachful) calls of my other
waxbills impelled me to get up and put on the light in their room. The
hen Dark Firefinch was greatly excited by this calling of the male and,
from the other room, repeatedly answered him. At this time both birds
were in the later stages of the moult with the wing quills not entirely
renewed and lots of new feathers still coming in about the head and
neck.
By the 29th both appeared very interested in each other. For some
days they had been calling and answering each other with the Trilling
Call. When let out on the 29th the male flew immediately to the
female's cage and both birds approached each other with the tail twist

and gave the Greeting Display. On the ist October I let them free
together for the first time since they had been separated. Both showed
intense excitement, they approached each other in the tail-twist posture
and performed intense Greeting Displays (see under " Display "), also
intermittently indulging in mutual inhibited bill pecking and mandibu-
lation. They uttered faint trilling calls but not during the periods of
most intense display, After about a minute of all this the female
suddenly " broke off" and taking flight with a loud trill, darted
through into the other room, closely followed by the male. In the next
ten minutes (approx.) she behaved in this way on four occasions and the
male twice. Each time the bird that flew off gave the loud trill as it did
so, was immediately followed by the other and the mutual display was
excitedly resumed as soon as they alighted. This behaviour, indicative
of a high degree of sexual arousal, in conflict with hostile tendencies is
as I later found, very characteristic of pair formation in this aggressive
species. Shortly after this the male went into the smaller of the two nest
baskets in their cage (i.e. in the cage the female had been living in for
the previous three weeks or so but in which both had originally been
kept) and was followed by the female, both nest calling when inside.
They soon came out, but the process was repeated at least several times
in the next hour or so. The male usually entered the basket first but on
one occasion, at least, the female did so. On that evening both roosted
together in the same basket (the larger one, not the one they were
considering as a nest-site). Next morning I noticed that the male seemed
to be avoiding the female but I had not time to make any detailed
observations.
On 3rd October I spent some time watching the Firefinches. In
surprising contrast to her former cowed demeanour and even to the
apparent symbolic inferiority she had shown in their displays when
first reunited, the female was now completely and aggressively dominant
over her mate. She attacked him whenever he came within about a foot
of her, which he endeavoured not to do. Both were quite silent in the
cage ; Once the cage was opened, however, the picture was rather
different. The male still avoided the female's immediate presence,
being careful, even when they flew together (as they did only on a few
occasions) from one room to the other, not to alight within 2 feet of
the female and usually alighting at least 4 or 5 feet from her. Both
frequently gave the Trilling Call. Whenever out of sight of the female
the male would " sing ", or give Contact Galls but he obviously chose
to spend most of the time out of sight of his mate and in whichever
room she was not in. The female sometimes gave her Contact Calls but
not often and appeared quite at ease and happy when her mate was not
with her. Indeed, the pair gave the impression of having reached in two
days a state that some human couples achieve only after several years of
matrimony.

The next day on which I was able to watch the Firefinches for any
time was 7th October. The pair then seemed more at ease with each
other and the female did not attack the male when he perched near her.
On 13th October I saw the male dismounting from the female after
what I think had been an unsuccessful attempt at copulation. At this
date the female gave the impression that she was soon going to lay. She
had the " raised rump " appearance so characteristic of most female
birds in this condition and her droppings were large and moist like those
of female waxbills usually are at such times.
I had placed dried and green grasses of various types in the cage for
them but, so far as I could see, only a very little, mostly fine, dry stems,
had been taken into the nest-basket. On the 15th I gave them a large
number of Wood Pigeon feathers (it is surprising how many of these,
ideal for nesting waxbills, one can accumulate in a day if one picks up
and pockets each that is seen lying in one's way) and the male at once
began to carry them eagerly to the female, who was inside the basket.
That night both male and female roosted together as usual in the larger
basket, but soon after I put the light on (at about 5 a.m.) on the morning
of the 17th, the hen went into the nest and was still there when I left
at 8.10 a.m. After this date the pair were never seen off the nest at
the same time for more than a few moments. Oddly enough at the first
morning change over this often happened. The male would go down to
feed as soon as the light was put on, then, after feeding for a few minutes
he would fly up to the nest. He would give low-intensity versions of the
Alarm Call (or what sounded like this) and disappear into the nest
basket. After a little mutual twittering out would come the hen.
Sometimes she gave her whistling calls before, during, or immediately
after the change-over (or repeatedly at all stages) and if she gave it after
coming out of the nest the male would come back out and join her for a
moment or two before returning to the eggs. The whistling calls evidently
were (at this stage) a strong stimulus for the male to join his mate as,
if she gave the whistling calls as soon as I put the light on in the
morning, the male would sometimes go at once and take over without
having first had his breakfast.
I am uncertain just when the female laid but from her behaviour and
appearance I think the first egg was most probably laid on the 15th or
16th. On 26th October I put the cock off the nest, drove both birds into
the other room and shut them there so they could not see what I was up
to. Then I cleaned out the cage and, with the aid of a torch, looked into
the nest. Four white eggs were lying in a very dense but shallow depres-
sion of feathers. On the 30th both birds showed far more than usual
eagerness when I put some whiteworm " culture " into their cage. I gave
them some mealworms (which they had often been given and never
touched before) and at once both birds came down and took them. So
I knew that young must have hatched or be near enough to hatching

to have stimulated the parents by their sound or movements. Next day
(the 31st) I drove off the male and shut them both out of sight while
I looked again. The torch beam showed three naked, blackish nestlings,
and one egg which had not hatched (and never did). They seemed all
right and two of them turned up their heads and begged but like all
very young waxbills, they aroused " alarm and despondency " by
reason of their minuteness. I felt that such tiny, frail things just could
not live. But they did survive.

few hours after death.
On 2nd November I looked at the young again. They had grown
appreciably and made a very faint chippering sound as the light shone
on them, but did not beg. At this date I found that the male had
changed his roosting place and instead of roosting in the other basket in
their cage he was roosting in an old broken basket lying on a canary
cage (empty) about 3 feet above floor level in a corner of the room.
I removed this basket, but instead of going back to his original roost he
then chose to roost snuggled behind some old rags in a large glass jar
in which I was trying, without much success, to culture lesser meal-
worms. On 7th November, I looked at the young again. They had
grown considerably and their " pin feathers " were showing although
no feathering had yet broken from the sheath. Their crops were packed
very full with millet. I was a bit worried about the length of time they
went nightly without food, when I discovered, through coming home
early on the 10th, that the parents had gone to roost by 3.30 p.m. The
light was seldom put on in the mornings before 4.30 a.m., often not till
5 a.m. and sometimes even later. The young got their first feed about
ten minutes after the room was lighted. Nevertheless they seemed to
thrive.
On 11 th November the feathers of the young had broken out of the
sheaths, at all events on their upper parts which were all I could see as I
peered into the nest. On the 14th I arrived home early at 2.30 p.m. to

find one young one out of the nest and on the floor of the cage. The
parents were very upset and continually tried, without avail, to lead it
back to the nest. Since it appeared unable or unwilling to make a
nearly vertical flight upwards and I feared it would get cold if allowed
to remain where it was I opened the door of the cage (almost the entire
fronts of all my cages are made to open for ease of getting birds in and
out and with a smaller door for feeding), drove the adults into the next
room, caught the fledgeling and put it back into the nest after colour-
ringing it. The result, as is usually the case in such circumstances, was
that all three nestlings took fright and at once " exploded ", fluttering
all over the room.
Rightly fearing that anything I did now would " make confusion
worst confounded " I opened my bedroom door to free the parents and
retired hastily. They returned at once and were very concerned so I
kept out of the way for about half-an-hour, until the alarm calls had
largely given place to trilling and singing, when I crept cautiously
upstairs to a point where I could spy through the bannisters without
being noticed by the birds. This vantage point is not ideal, since it
does not give anything like a full view of their room. It sufficed to show,
however, that the parents were now chiefly concerned about one
nestling which was on the window ledge. They kept flying to and fro
between it and the nest basket in the cage but it did not follow them.
As it was getting dark and the fledgeling in the window looked cold and
miserable 1 thought I had better try to get it back into the nest, where
I imagined the other two young already were. I drove the parents into
the other room, not without some difficulty as they were so much
concerned for their young that they kept dodging back past my com-
manding arms. Having finally got them out of the way I picked up the
young one on the window ledge. It was already showing signs of
chilling. I put it back into the nest. I then found that the other two
young ones were not in the nest but on the floor under an old rucsac.
Evidently the parents had been unconcerned about them as they were
" in cover ". They also were not looking too happy and as a result of
their chilling did not panic and explode again when put back in the
nest. When I let the parents back the female joined the young in the
nest and roosted there with them, so all was well.
Next morning one fledgeling followed her immediately she came out
of the nest and within a few minutes all were out. That evening
(15th) two young were roosting on top of the larger wicker basket (into
which the female had returned and was roosting with her mate) and the
third young one was roosting on a low branch, a few inches above the
floor of the cage. As it was a cold night, and the room is normally only
slightly warmed by a single bar heater in the linen cupboard, I put on
an electric " radiant heater " also. Fortunately the unaccustomed light
from this did not upset the roosting birds. Next morning all were well

even although, by an oversight, the light was not put on in the room
until after 6 p.m. That evening all three young were roosting together
on top of the male's roosting basket. I noticed that although the two
outside fledgelings had their heads " behind their wings " in the usual
passerine manner the middle one was sleeping with its head in much the
same position as that of a roosting pigeon.
Fledgeling asleep with head in " pigeon " position.
The young could fly well by the 22nd. By the 27th they were
beginning to warble in the usual manner of young passerines and were
also eating seed although still being fed frequently by their father. At
their first appearance into the world and to a lesser extent subse-
quently, their parents had given alarm notes whenever I appeared. At
first this frightened the young ones but through being so often
" bombarded " with alarm notes they very soon ceased to worry when
their parents were " calling Wolf". Their own relative lack of fear in
my presence in turn had a somewhat quietening effect on the parents.
These latter had not, as is so often the case with wild birds that breed in
captivity, become tamer when they started to incubate. They did,
however, " steady down " a little after the young were flying, pre-
sumably as a result of the latters' relative tameness. On 27th November,
I saw all three young feeding themselves quite competently on millet
although on that day they were all also fed frequently by their father.
After the 28th I did not again hear them begging or see them fed. The
adults were not, however, quite unconcerned since if they heard or saw
a young one in any distress (e.g. if one, in another room, gave alarm
calls or if one in the same room fluttered against a window pane) they
at once reacted with Contact Calls.
When I cleaned the nest basket out two days after the young had
fledged I discovered that the hen had already laid two eggs of a new
clutch therein. In spite of being given no nesting material she laid five
more eggs (I think this total of seven really represented two clutches)
in the roosting basket. I removed these on 3rd December on which date
I put the original nest basket back in position, gave the birds nesting
material and let them all free in the house. That morning the male
frequently gave the Stem Display, the first time I had seen him do so.
The female was obviously responsive, but all the displays I saw came to
nothing owing to the interference of the young birds. These all, but

especially the young male, had a kind of paternal Oedipus complex
(of which more later) and as soon as their father started to display they
would fly to him and force themselves between him and their mother.
At this the male broke off the display.
That morning the pair also went 11 c house-hunting " and nest-called
in five different places, but did not attempt any nest building. When
I got home that evening I found that they had made a nest in a corner
on top of an old canary cage about 3 feet from the floor and were
roosting together in it. Two of the young were roosting on the same
cage a foot away from the nest. I could not see the third young one but
dare not make a search for fear of disturbing the others. Fortunately it
turned up safe and sound next morning. Next evening (14th December)
there was a feather in the new nest and the pair were roosting again in
the basket in their cage. The young ones roosted above them on top of
the same basket.
The position of the new nest had the advantage that I could easily
see into it. Its disadvantage was that if the birds were to use it success-
fully they must be left permanently free. Thinking that to have the
whole family free all the time would be too much of a good thing and
that, in any case, the young ones would be likely to interfere with their
parents, I caught the young ones and shut them in a cage in my bed-
room. They were liberated about every third day, the bedroom door
then being shut so they could not get out. Most of the time, however,
they were kept captive and their parents given the run of the upstairs
rooms.
All went well with the second nest in spite of the fact that the birds
were subject to a good deal of interference on my part. I felt I would be
unlikely ever again to get a nest in such an ideal place for observation
and experimentation and so I took a good many " calculated risks " in
the way of putting the parents off to look at the nest contents, trying to
provoke defence or distraction display and so on. We are always being
told that we should never interfere with birds when nesting, be careful
when we look at the young and so on. Certainly if one never goes into
an aviary and then, when a pair of timid birds have eggs or young,
charges up to the nest and looks into it the parents are likely to desert.
On the other hand if we " let well alone 55 we shall learn very little.
Most birds will stand a good deal of interference provided they are
accustomed to it early on, by judicious degrees of course, and provided
they have room to fly away a little distance from one when one has
frightened them. Where birds are concerned I have always been as full
of " satiable curiosity " as the Elephant's Child and, like him, have been
none the worse for it in the end. At any rate I seem to have been just as
successful with waxbills (which all the " experts " tell us are very sensi-
tive to disturbance) as most others have in spite of regularly shining torches
or poking my fingers into their nests in order to find out what is inside.

88 D. GOODWIN-OBSERVATIONS ON THE DARK FIREFINCH
When the young hatched I soon noticed that the number of mutilated
mealworms lying about the house seemed far in excess of the number of
live ones given to the Firefinches. Investigation showed they had found
the mealworm box in the linen cupboard and were helping themselves
with a similar reckless prodigality to that with which our own species
exploits the limited resources of its environment. Although, like most
people, I feel little emotional involvement with insects, I was slightly
uneasy about the number of mealworms being butchered in order that
the Firefinches could consume a minute amount of each. Fortunately,
however, this coincided with a cold spell (as the hatching, in this
country, of a brood of tropical birds usually does) and so I was able to
salve my easily-placated conscience by feeding the remains to a hungry
Song Thrush that came daily to my garden for hand-outs.
The above remarks about all going well with the second nest need to
be qualified as one of the young was backward in development and
when the others fledged, and it was left alone in the nest, it died in spite
of the room being heated and the parents feeding it well. The other two
proved a cock and a hen and were later put in the cage with the former
brood, which were two hens and one cock. Subsequently when both
broods had moulted into adult plumage, I gave away all except one
young pair and the two parents. Unfortunately the adult hen acciden-
tally injured herself and died. The old male paired with his daughter
and, after being an unwilling bachelor for a long time, the other male is
now paired to a female of the dark western form ofjamesons's Firefinch.

From its behaviour in captivity there can be little doubt that the
Dark Firefinch is exclusively a ground feeder. Besides the sideways
flicking movement of the bill, common to many ground-feeding
passerines (and pigeons) when searching for food in fairly loose soil it will
break up quite sizeable clumps of earth or debris. When so doing the
bird draws itself up to its full height and strikes down with a pickaxe-
like motion of the closed bill. I have the impression that at the moment
of impact the bird makes, or tries to make, the sideways flick, but as I
have only watched it with the naked eye and not taken high speed
photographs I cannot be certain on this point.
AUo-preening and " Clumping
This behaviour, which I have previously discussed (Goodwin, i960)
for some other waxbill species, is very little indulged in by the Dark
Firefinch. I have seen adults briefly preen the heads of their dependent
young when these have been huddling against them. I have twice seen
a female apparently making attempts to preen her mate's head when he

was drying himself after a bath. At these times he had his head feathers
very fully erected, so his profile resembled that with which other species
solicit Allo-preening. However, the male repulsed the female as often
as she made the attempt.
Connected with the lack, or virtual lack of this behaviour pattern is
the fact that adult Dark Firefinches do not usually sit clumped close
together as other waxbills do. The members of a pair do, however,
roost together (except when they have eggs or young) and when roosting
are certainly sometimes, and I think always in close physical contact.
However, when not breeding the pair often perch in contact side by
side.
Mandibulation.
A rapid opening and shutting of the mandibles as the birds face each
other is shown, as in the Blue Waxbills (Goodwin, 1959) in situations of
inhibited or lessening aggression. It is regularly performed by members
of a pair after bill-pecking or other more overtly aggressive behaviour.
It is also shown by the nest-calling male when the female approaches.
Bill-fencing or Bill-pecking.
Like many other estrildines Dark Firefinches often peck at each other's
bills; usually they seem to jab with the closed bill and in a rather formal-
looking way as if they were " pulling their punches ". This behaviour
indicates aggression that is, to some extent, inhibited but not inhibited
so much as in Mandibulation, which usually follows the mutual Bill-
pecking. It is shown often between members of a pair or, more
especially, between male and female during pair-formation, but does
not seem to occur in serious fights between rival males. I have, however,
seen only two of the latter and on both occasions the birds were free in
the house and the " loser " fled to another room.
Threat.
As in most estrildines threat display is poorly developed. It consists
merely of intention movements of attack ; the threatening bird
crouches facing its adversary with lowered head, somewhat opened bill
and spread or partly-spread tail. If a male in a cage is threatening or
defying one on a perch sticking out from its cage (with the wire between
them) one or both may crouch sideways on and turn the tail diagonally
so that the black under tail-coverts are exhibited to the rival. The tail is
held straight during this manoeuvre, not " twisted " towards the other
bird as in sexual displays.
The Greeting Display.
This is homologous with and rather similar to the Greeting Displays
of the Java Sparrow (Goodwin, 1963) and Lavender Finch (Kunkel,

1959). When performed at high intensity it is very striking. The two
birds approach and bow towards each other. As they bow their tails
come well above the horizontal. There is often some quick movement
of the tail but most of the time the tail is " twisted " towards the
partner so that when the two come really close their tails overlap (see
sketch). The bows are sometimes synchronous but rather more often
not and alternate with a rather upright stance in which the heads are
still turned towards one another in the same way. As the bird bows it
slightly lifts the still folded far wing and slaps it down again on its rump
making a soft, short, but clearly audible " thuk " or " fwut " sound.
Often when bowing the hen seems to try to bring her head across the
male's breast in front of and below his head and, but less often, the male
will appear to deliberately try to do this. Particularly during pair forma-
tion the male's head is usually held a little higher than the female's
during the head-up phase of this display and if one head is lower than
the other at the climax of the bow it is the female's.
The Greeting Display is given when members of a pair come together

after some little absence. It is shown particularly intensely during pair
formation and at such times especially is often prefaced by or inter-
spersed with bill pecking or mandibulation and often one bird will

house) uttering the Trilling Call as it goes. I have also seen this display

The Stem Display.
This is very similar to the homologous displays of other waxbills.
The male takes a piece of potential nesting material, often a feather,
but almost equally often a piece of grass, sometimes a piece of white
paper if nothing better is to hand, and holds it by the shaft (if a feather)
or by its firmest end. He holds his head rather upright (but position can
vary a good deal) and has the head feathers sleeked down and the belly
and flank feathers somewhat raised as in other species of Firefinch
(Kunkel, 1959, Harrison, 1956). The tail is usually slightly depressed
and twisted towards the hen although it immediately straightens should
the hen move to a position directly in front of the male. The male then
bounces up and down with a slight upward and backward throw of the
head. This head movement appears less as a rule than in Uraeginthus .
He may utter any or several of the Display Calls (see "Voice").
Sometimes, but relatively seldom the male, when displaying, brings
his head right down and bows in front of the female's breast. This
suggests a combination with elements of the Greeting Display. In the
Senegal Firefinch this movement is the normal culmination of the Stem
Display (Harrison, 1956).

D. GOODWIN-OBSERVATIONS ON THE DARK FIREFINCH
Displaying male drops feather and flutters wings (see text for details).
Sometimes, but not very often, the wings may be raised or extended
and fluttered during the Stem Display. Usually the bird drops his
feather or grass just before he begins to flutter his wings but he continues
the up and down movements which may, indeed, become more intense
and culminate in an upward jump and flutter on to the female and an
attempt to copulate. Seeing this behaviour it is as easy to think that the
upward jerking movements of the Stem Display could derive from
intention movements of mounting as the usual (and equally plausible)
idea that they are derived from nest-building movements.
Copulation.
If the female responds to the male's Stem Display by soliciting (and
sometimes if she does not) the male will mount and copulate, or attempt
to do so. Sometimes copulation may be initiated by the female soliciting
with crouched posture and quivering tail in the usual estrildine manner
without any apparent (immediate) stimulus from the male. Sometimes
the male may take the initiative by approaching the female or hopping
persistently after her on the ground, uttering the Soliciting Call and
attempting to mount her. Especially under such circumstances
apparently successful copulation may take place without any signs of
readiness from the female other than crouching still (without quivering
her tail or uttering the Soliciting Call) when the male mounts. Under
all circumstances the male, before mounting, pecks at the female's head

manner that Uraeginthus males do, except that I have not seen the present

So far as I have seen only the male bird brings material for the outer
part of the nest and he appears to do most of the building. This agrees
with Harrison's (1957) observations. However, my birds would not
build if I was watching them near enough to observe details. Both
cock and hen collected feathers to line the nest, continuing to do so
during incubation in the usual estrildine manner. All material was, so
far as I saw, held by the end in the typical estrildine way (see Goodwin,
i960) and not " bundled ". They showed no interest whatsoever in bits
of burnt wood (charcoal) at any stage of breeding. When they nested in
the small nest basket this evidently gave them the impression of a
" pre-fabricated " outer shell and the nest they built consisted at
the sides only of relatively few fine dead grasses. The wall of the nest
built later in the room was much thicker. In each case the eggs lay in a
dense bed of feathers although the cup of the nest was very shallow ;
saucer-shaped rather than cup-shaped in fact.
Both sexes incubate and brood. I got the impression that the male
took shorter spells on the nest than the female. This was so on the only
day during which I was able to make inspections every 20 to 30 minutes.
I did this on 25th December when the young in the nest in the corner of
the spare room were two days old. Between 6 a.m. and 3.40 p.m. the
male took six spells of brooding the young but was seldom on the nest
more than twenty minutes. The room light had been on since 3 a.m. on
that day, however, so it is quite certain that the male took at least
seven spells of " duty " since he invariably (at least on all the many
occasions when I stayed awake and watched after putting the light in
their room on) took over on the nest within thirty minutes of leaving his
roost. Possibly in a wild state where the birds might have to search for
some time to get enough food for themselves or their young both sexes
would spend a more equal amount of time on and off the nest.
As soon as the light was put on (usually about 5 a.m. when they had
the first nest in October and between 2 a.m. and 4 a.m. for the second
nest later) in the morning the cock would leave his roosting basket,
stretch, preen a little, perhaps sing a little, then go down and feed. He
" sang " much more often and more loudly during the incubation of the
second nest than of the first, I think because the light was put on, as a
rule, much earlier then. When he had fed he would go to the nest. As
he came to it he would give the " Twitter-trill Sometimes the female
would give her Whistling Calls from within the nest before the male

entered. More often only soft twittering from one or both would be
heard during the moment that both were together in the nest, then the
female would slip out. Very often, in fact about three times out of four,
she would give whistling calls from the perch. Whenever she did so the
male would come out of the nest again, go to her, they would perform
the Greeting Display and then the male would return to the nest. On
one occasion the female gave the Whistling Call while the male was in
the nest with her, only to repeat it after she came out, with the usual
result.
Owing to her being more timid and suspicious than her mate I was
never able to watch the change over closely when the female relieved the
male. There seemed to be less ceremony attached to this as she never
gave her Whistling Calls and the exchange was very quickly effected.
Once the eggs had begun to hatch the female no longer gave Whistling
Calls at the change over. From then until the young were about a week
or ten days old she would give the Alarm Call (see section on Voice)
immediately after leaving the nest. This apparently expressed a reluc-
tance to leave the nest at this period since she uttered these notes every
time she was relieved by the male and left the nest. It was not caused
by my presence, on the contrary when I was downstairs I could tell
immediately by her calls when she had " come off duty ".
Neither male nor female showed any signs of defensive behaviour
when incubating or brooding. When I reached a finger towards it the
incubating bird would crouch tensely as the hand approached then, as
my finger entered the nest, would scramble past it and fly into the next
room breaking into loud Alarm Calls as it took wing. With newly
hatched young the behaviour was different. Then (male twice experi-
mented with, female only once) the bird, after scrambling past the
intruding finger, fluttered downwards to the floor and scuttled under
the bed. There was no appearance of injury or incapacity, but the
behaviour strongly suggested the distraction displays of such birds as the
Reed Bunting. Or at any rate some of the basic elements of such
distraction displays.
The parental behaviour seems typical of most estrildines (see Kunkel,
1959, Goodwin, i960) in general. While the young were in the nest the
cock bird invariably fed them on taking over from the hen and the hen
often did when she returned to the nest. Probably she always did if
I was not in the immediate vicinity. A point in which the feeding
behaviour of this species and also of the Blue-headed and Blue-breasted
Waxbills (Uraeginthus cyanocephalus and U. angolensis ) differs from that of
Australian estrildines is worth mentioning. The Australian species
(Immelmann, 1962) repeatedly break off feeding for a moment, in
order to bring up more food into the mouth, when they have fed to the
young one the portion first brought up before beginning to feed. With
the African species I have studied the parent can be seen to bring up

food into the throat before beginning to feed, in the same manner as the
Australian species, but having put its bill into the fledgeling's mouth it
then visually appears to bring up more food from the crop and pass it
straight on to the young one without disengaging its bill. The mouths
of adult and young are engaged for an appreciable time during which
there are strong regurgitating movements by the adult and
" bulges " are seen to pass up from the crop region to the throat and
thence, presumably, since they vanish, into the young one. Usually
(although not invariably) if one of the above species disengages from a
fledgeling once it has started feeding it does not (till " next time ", of
course), re-insert its bill, no matter how frantically that young one may
still beg, but goes to another young to give it a share. That is, of course,
if it still has food to dispense.
During the period when the young are about to fledge, or have
recently fledged, the parents show the usual hypersensitivity to danger,
real, suspected, or imagined, that is characteristic of many (perhaps all)
species at such times. A recently fledged young one in an exposed place,
either on the ground or above it, greatly worries the parents and they
try to lead it to safety in the usual estrildine way, repeatedly flying to
it, alighting beside it, and then flying to the desired place and calling.
I am not certain of the laying periods and commencement of incuba-
tion for the first nest, but no doubt it was the same as shown for the
second which was as follows. The hen did not roost on the nest on the
night before she laid her first egg but went on the nest at 5.30 a.m., an
hour after the light in the room was put on. She was still on the nest at
6.30 a.m. At 7 a.m. the male was on. I put him off and found the first
egg had been laid. The eggs, four in all, were laid at daily intervals.
From the time the first was laid both birds were often on the nest by day.
In fact usually so when I looked but I was never at home all day during
this time. They were, however, left uncovered at night (both cock and
hen roosting together in a basket in their cage) until the night of the day
on which (in the morning) the third egg had been laid. That night the
hen roosted on the nest. This confirms what Kunkel (1959) found for
several other estrildine species in which true incubation begins with
the third egg.
As with other waxbills, at least those species that I have succeeded in
breeding, the parents tend to leave the young uncovered by day for
considerable periods once they are about a week old and before they
are well feathered. For this reason singly-reared young ones never do
well. I have had such singletons in several species and in all cases, even
if reared, they have been weak specimens and have died within three
months of fledging. I feel sure this is due to having been exposed to cold
during nestlinghood. It is certainly not due, as I have sometimes seen
suggested, to the parents being less " stimulated " by a single young
one and feeding it less. On the contrary the crops of such singletons are

always packed full of food, so much so that they seldom beg at " normal "
intensity.
Behaviour of Young.
The fledged young beg in the usual estrildine manner (Kunkel, 1959)
with crouched posture and twisted neck. One or both wings may be
very slightly opened and vibrated but there is usually no visible wing
movement. The Begging Call is a rapid " Tche-tche, tche-tche-tche-
tche which becomes louder and huskier a few days after fledging. When
given intensely it is speeded up to a very hurried, chattering. Usually
it is given at about the same tempo as the usual alarm chatter of the
Magpie (Pica pica ). I have twice seen a young one, possibly the same
one on each occasion, raise its wings in the same way as a young
Amandava does when begging (Goodwin, i960). This happened when
the young one had just scrambled over one of its siblings and got
between it and the parent.
I have also twice seen a wing-lifting display (?) from young that had
just become independent but were still, apparently emotionally
attached to their father. One, a female juvenile, was in my bedroom for
the first time and rather alarmed at the strange surroundings. Her
father (who was thoroughly used to coming into this room) flew in,
alighted on a cage top the other side of the room and gave the Contact
Call. The juvenile flew to him, landed near him and at once crouched
with head and tail slightly raised and fully lifted first one wing and then
the other. On the same day the male juvenile of the same brood was
in the room where they had been reared (and where he was quite " at
home "). His father went into a small cage in a corner and Nest-called
from a twig platform inside. The juvenile male at once flew to him,
landed on top of the cage and gave the same crouching and wing-
lifting as its sister had shortly before. I have seen no similar display
from adults.
At about the time they begin to feed themselves, and to spend much
of their spare time in the rambling and inconsequential-sounding
warbling characteristic of most young passerines, they begin to show a
strong interest in the display of the male. This interest increases rather
than diminishes and is usually most intense shortly after the male
ceases to feed them, which happens about five or six days after they
first start to feed of their own accord. At such times the juveniles fly to
and cluster round the male if they see him begin the Stem Display. Very
often he has only to pick up a bit of grass or feather for them to be
attracted. Usually the young at such times give elements of the Greeting
Display and I have seen a young male give a very intense Greeting-
Display in response to its father's Stem Display. This behaviour sug-
gests the same sort of basically sexual bond as has been described for
young Bullfinches by Nicolai (1959). The male did not, however, show

any overt sexual responses towards his young. I had the impression
that his Stem Displays at this time were being given either in reference
to his mate or in vacuo. He usually appeared nonplussed when the
young gathered round him and soon dropped his feather and ceased to
display.
The young of the first brood fledged when 16 days old. They were
noticed to be feeding themselves efficiently at 27 days old ; the father
was last seen to feed them when they were 32 days old. When 37 days
old two of the young (a male and a female) showed a red band from
gape to eye and a few red feathers elsewhere on the face. At 37 days old
all three had much adult plumage on heads, necks, and upper parts of
breasts. This moult was very " heavy 55 like that of young Amandava
species and unlike the slow and gradual moult of young Uraeginthus.
Of course the times and speed of moulting in captivity in England may
not agree in all, or many, points with what occurs in natural conditions.
Voice
I am only too aware of the flaws and imperfections of trying to convey
bird sounds by what is now generally looked upon as the bad old-
fashioned method of written description. Still, half a loaf is better than
no bread and I hope I shall be excused by and able to give some
information to those readers who, like myself, have not the time, money,
and facilities needed to produce sound spectrographs. Lagonosticto-
philes may be perturbed that my descriptions and interpretations of
calls do not entirely coincide with those in a previous paper on this
species (Harrison, 1957) which appeared in our magazine. It now
seems certain that most, perhaps all, Mr. Harrison's birds were in fact
(see Harrison, 1963) the western race of Jameson's Firefmch (L. rhodo -
pareia virata).
In naming the various sounds uttered I have in some cases used terms
indicative of (presumed) function of the call, in others of its sound. This
because it seemed to me a lesser evil than to sacrifice relative clarity of
meaning to nomenclatorial consistency.
The Alarm Call.
A loud hard " Tchit, Tchittick ! " " Tchittick ick ", etc., very
suggestive in tone of the scolding of a Wren ( Troglodytes troglodytes)
although the tempo often more resembles that of the much less loud
"ticking" of an alarmed Robin ( Erithacus rubecula). The more
apparently distressed the bird is the louder and harder and more
rapidly " run-together " the alarm calling. Where fear appears to be
the dominant motivation the bird is inclined to give single " Tchits "
or " Ticks " rather than the more usual series of notes.
This call corresponds to the calls that have been recently (Harrison,
1962) defined as " Excitement Notes ". However, I prefer the term

" Alarm Call " since in every case (at least with the present species)
when I have been able to ascertain the cause of the bird's outcry it has
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.867155690476191" page_id="56317775"  page_num="98" year="" vol="">
been something likely to have caused alarm, distress, or conflict. It is,
for example, given in the following situations.-- (a) When a bird is
alarmed by my close presence or by the appearance of a stranger ; if
one attempts to catch or otherwise much frightens a caged bird the single
hard " Tchits " will be given, (b) When the young are approached by a
human or when a fledgeling cries out in fear or flutters against a window
pane, (c) As a bird takes wing when I have frightened it from its nest.
(d) By adults with dependent fledgelings when (on three occasions) they
have seen a cat in the garden as they looked through the window.
(e) By a bird flying past me from one room to the other. When free in
the house they readily and voluntarily fly from the spare room into my
bedroom or vice versa even if I am standing in the doorway and they
then, of necessity, pass within a few inches of my head. At the moment
that it passes the bird almost always gives a brief burst of Alarm Calls.
(/) By a female immediately after coming off nest (having been relieved
by a male) especially if there are chipping eggs or young under a week old,
here the call seems to indicate conflict between the desire to brood or
incubate the nest and the need for food or exercise.
The Trilling Call.
A drawn-out trill with a rising inflection. Usually monosyllabic and
variable in length and loudness, but always with a strong " r " sound
running through it and an " excited sounding " tone. Sometimes there
is a suggestion of a " t " sound at its end. It could be written
" Trrrrrrrrrr-t " or " Trrrrrrrrrrr ". It bears some resemblance to both
the probably homologous trilling call of the Java Sparrow (Goodwin,
1963) and the shivering trill of the Wood Warbler (Phylloscopus
sibilatrix ). When given at high intensity this call is uttered with widely
opened bill and marked vibration or quivering of the whole body.
When given at lower intensity this quivering may only be noticeable in the
tail where it is, naturally, always most conspicuous.
This call is basically aggressive or threatening although when used
between members of a pair it often seems to indicate inhibited or
sublimated aggression rather than any overt hostility. When the pair
trill together at another bird it may well function to increase the
emotional bond between them just as the emotional bond between two
people is intensified (if only for a short time) when they both together
threaten, laugh at, or defy the same enemy.
It is given in the following situations :--
(1) By a male or by both sexes of a pair on catching sight of another
Firefinch.
(2) By a Firefinch when another (whether its mate or a rival) flies
into the room where it is living (whether it is free or in a cage).

intensity.
The Trilling Twitter.
Typically very similar in phrasing to the alarm call but much less
loud, lacking the 44 hard " tone and with an 44 r " sound in it. Could,
perhaps be written 44 Trittit ! Trittitit, etc.
This call appears to combine elements of both the Trilling and Alarm
calls but at the same time to express a lesser degree of excitement than
evokes either of them. It appears to be given in many circumstances
where there is some mild degree of excitement involving the presence
of conspecifics. It may be given when two birds come together ; as a
response to the Trilling Call of a conspecific out of sight (in another
room). It is usually given by the male as he approaches the nest to take
over incubation or brooding 44 duties ". Not always easy to distinguish
(but there is a difference of tone) from low intensity versions of the
Alarm Call.

100 D. GOODWIN-OBSERVATIONS ON THE DARK FIREFINCH
The Fear Screech.
When a fledgeling is seized in the hand it often gives an unpleasant
husky screech, sometimes repeating this two or three times before falling
silent. Adults and young no longer dependent on their parents do not
usually utter this cry when handled. Sometimes, however, they do so,
giving it in a rather deeper tone than a fledgeling does.
The Nest Call.
This is a very soft, repeated 44 Tu-tu-tu-tu " or 44 Teh-teh-teh-teh
It is given by the male when he has found a nest site and presumably
functions to attract the female who is, however, very often, only a few
paces behind the site-selecting male. I have also heard it given when
both birds were in the nest together so it is quite likely given by the
female as well. It may be prefaced or interspersed with the Trilling
Twitter in very soft form.
The Soliciting Call.
This is very similar to the Nest Call, but uttered rather more rapidly
than the Nest Call usually is (both are subject to some variation) and
has a more excited tone. Could, perhaps, be written 44 qwe-qwe-qwe-
qwe . or 44 Twe-twe-twe-twe-twe . . .". There is some difference
between this call as given by males and females but it is slight and may
be due to individual rather than sexual difference. This call is given by
the soliciting female, at least if the male is not at hand and immediately
responsive. Also by the male when he is about to mount the female
(sometimes) or, and more particularly, when he wishes to mount her
and she is not being very co-operative.
The Display Calls.
I group together under this heading several calls which are uttered in
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.938501" page_id="56317777"  page_num="100" year="" vol="">
the Stem Display or in Song (q.v.) but do not appear to be given in
other contexts. They are {a) a clear, high-pitched 44 Pee " or 44 Week ".
(b) A squelchy-sounding 44 Squeh ", very similar to the homologous
call of Jameson's Firefinch (see Harrison, 1957 and 1963). (c) A husky
44 Fwit " very suggestive of the sound made by the wings in the
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.969181727272727" page_id="56317777"  page_num="100" year="" vol="">
Greeting Display but vocal. (d) A soft but husky whispering or
muttering very suggestive of the sotto voce whispering calls often given by
displaying male Jays Garrulus glandarius. Both this husky muttering and
the 44 squelchy " note may be punctuated by a click rather similar in
sound to the bill-snapping of the Java Sparrow. This is probably
homologous with the 44 click-like 4 stip ' " described by Harrison (1956)
for the Senegal Firefinch.
Any or all of these calls may be given by the displaying male in any
sort of order. If, however, he only gives one note or repetitions of one
note during a bout of displaying then it is usually either the squelchy-
sounding 44 Squeh " or the clear high-pitched 44 Pee

The Courting Screech.
A long drawn out husky screech T'skaaa or T'schair subject to some
variation but basically very similar to the Fear Screech. This was often
given by the captive-bred male when hopping or, more usually, flying
towards females in whom he was sexually interested. At such times he
was more or less in Stem Display posture while in flight and uttered
this screech with wide open bill. He showed this behaviour towards
his father's mate, when he was unpaired, and later towards the female
L. jameson virata. He did not screech in this manner at his first mate
(his sister, whom he had always known) nor to the hen Jameson's after
they were firmly paired. The screech seems to express a very intense
degree of emotion and, I think, conflict between aggressive and sexual
impulses.
The Contact Calls.
In this cover-haunting species which, probably, lives in pairs and does
not flock in a wild state, the contact calls are well developed and appear,
so far as can be judged from very few specimens, to show marked
individual differences. My " old " (wild caught) male utters as his
Contact Calls a loud, ringing " Chew-chew-chew-chew ..." with an
almost Nightingale-like tone and richness, a slightly less musical but
equally loud " Chui-chui-chui-chui " and a more Canary-like " Chub-
chub-chub-chub ..." The homologous calls of the " young " (captive-
bred) male could be written the same way but are much harsher in
tone so that his Contact Calling, unlike that of his father, is unpleasant
to my ears. Separation from the mate or the Contact Calls of another
individual (female or male, mate or rival) usually elicit immediate
Contact Calls. Though their function is obviously communicative they
seem largely motivated by a degree of uneasiness or mild fear insuffi-
cient to elicit Alarm Calls. Thus they may be given in response to some
mildly alarming behaviour on my part or in response to Alarm Calls
(but usually only fairly low intensity Alarm Calls) from a conspecific.
Besides a " Chwee-chwee-chwee ..." very like the male's the
female has other and differently sounding calls that appear to be
referable to the Contact Call repertoire. Of these my first (wild
caught) female had three forms ( a ) a long-drawn, thin, high-
pitched plaintive, whistling " Feeeeeeeeeee " somewhat suggestive of
the whistle of a male Golden Plover ( Charadrius apricarius in its display
flight ; (b) a slightly louder and slightly less plaintive " Feeeu-feeeu "
and (c) a shorter, quicker, and tri-syllabic " Fee u-feed-fee u " very
suggestive of the whistling call of the Nuthatch [Sitta europaea). The
comparable calls of my present (captive bred) female differ from those
of her mother (as above described) in being a little less plaintive in tone.
Her equivalent of the tri-syllabic Feed-feed-feed could better be written
Fee-fee-fee and more than three " string together " notes are often

uttered. She also uses much more often the Chwee-chwee-chwee male-
like Contact Call.
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.987551119047619" page_id="56317779"  page_num="102" year="" vol="">
These calls are given by the female in situations where the male
would utter his Contact Call phrases. They are also uttered by the
nesting female (sometimes) before, during, or after the change-over
(see under " Nesting and Parental behaviour "). When given by a
female alone in a room I have not been able to find any difference in the
situation correlated with the three forms of whistling Contact Calls.
The single very plaintive " Feeee " seems especially to be indicative of a
greater degree of fear or disquiet. This is suggested by the fact that the
original female gave it more often during her first few days at liberty in
the house than subsequently. Also, on one occasion when a friend was
staying with me who was a stranger to the birds and alarmed them more
than I did and the Firefinches kept flying about in a rather worried
manner from one room to the other, the female frequently gave the single
" Feeee " (not the other Contact Calls) when she was perched only a
few inches from her mate. He responded in each case with the Trilling
Call and the Greeting Display, or at least some attempt at it, at once
followed in spite (or because ?) of their alarmed state.
The di-syllabic " Feeeu-feeeu " is most often used by the hen at the
change over. The single " Feeee " seems never to be used in answer (or
reaction) to the call of another individual, in which situation the tri-
syllabic " Feeu-feeu-feeu " or the male-like Chwee-chwee-chwee-chwee
are used.
The most striking thing about the Contact Calls is the difference
between those of the young pair and those of their parents. Especially
in view of the fact that they have never heard any other adults. Since
all their other calls sound identical to those of their parents this is
unlikely to be due to some adverse factor of the capture environment.
This individual difference probably functions for quick recognition of
the mate's voice, which is no doubt useful in this aggressive and
probably territorial species.
The " Song " of the Male
In the Blue Waxbills (Uraegmthus sp.) it is possible to draw a firm
distinction between the song (i.e. the rather complex series of notes
given when displaying as well as in other situations) and the simpler,
repeated Contact Calls even though both are often given in very similar
situations. In these Blue Waxbills I have often had the impression
that the song represents a sort of stereotyped potpourri of all or most of
the other calls in various permutations. This impression is, however,
far more vivid and unchallengeable in the case of the present species.
The " Song " of the male Dark Firefinch appears to consist of little,
if anything more than his repertoire of call notes. The only exception is
the Alarm Note but its apparent absence in the song may be due to my

thinking it genuine at times when it is given in " Song When singing
the male Dark Firefinch varies the pitch and intensity of some notes and
may give them in somewhat different forms. Thus the high-pitched
" Pee 55 may be given as several notes rung together " Pee-pee-pee-
pee " in a very musical and poignant tone suggestive of the " Tereus ! "
cry in the Nightingale's song, the Trilling Call may end in a liquid
bubbling sound and so on. In the quieter forms of Song there often
appears to be a certain amount of intergradation of different calls but
this is hard to be sure of. Such intergradation of different calls is very
seldom done when the bird is singing loudly.
It is possible to distinguish two main types of singing, one loud and the
other quiet and sotto voce. This is, however, an artificial distinction as
the two can intergrade and seem to express only a difference in intensity
not in motivation. When singing loudly the bird tends to utter each
note three or four times in a series, when singing quietly a note will often
be uttered only once. This is, however, an average not an absolute
difference.
In both forms of song there is a characteristic pause after each note
or series of notes. Usually the singer does not immediately repeat the
same note or series of notes after a pause although he sometimes does so.
When singing the bird perches, stands on the ground, or hops about. He
tends to hold his head rather high and to look around, moving his head
to do so, in the pauses. He may, on the other hand, utilize the pauses
for feeding. Often he indulges in low intensity display movements while
singing, sometimes he may give full Stem Display with material in his
bill while singing alone, although never while actually uttering the
Contact Calls or Trilling Call at high intensity. In loud song particularly
the style, staccato bursts of vehement short phrases or single notes, with
pauses of silence between, is very suggestive of the song of the Nightin-

As Harrison (1962) has emphasized for various estrildines, visual
isolation is one of the commonest situations eliciting Song. In the Dark
Firefinch loud song is rarely and quiet song less infrequently given in
sight of conspecifics. I once saw and heard a male singing while
perched with his flying and nearly independent young on each side of
him and in physical contact with him. Andrew (i960) has pointed out
that in many birds song seems to be elicited by the same stimuli that
elicit Contact Calls. This is certainly the case in the Dark Firefinch but
in this species the nature of the Song makes it very difficult, if not
impossible, to say where " call notes " end and " song " begins or
vice versa.
Comparison with Calls of Jameson's Firefinches
For some months past I have also had two Jameson's Firefinches

female of the dark Western race L.j. virata. Although the data on them
is necessarily scanty (as yet) some of it seems worth giving for compara-
tive purposes. For brevity's sake I shall hereafter refer to the two forms
of this species in my possession as jamesoni and virata.
So far as one can judge from two specimens, compared with only a
small number of one race of rubricata , Jameson's Firefinch gives the
impression of being a slightly slimmer and neater-looking as well as
slightly smaller bird. The male jamesoni is very like the male of rubricata
haematocephala but the red parts are a paler and more pinkish red and
the upperparts a warmer, more reddish-brown ground colour. The
male virata is dark greyish-brown and dark red, very like the western
races of rubricata and the female virata is almost as red as the male,
unlike the females of rubricata and jamesoni. Virata is also a little larger,
being as large, but perhaps not so heavily built as rubricata. My male
jamesoni and female virata apparently each " mistook " the other for a
rival of the same sex. They showed mutual hostility and the female
courted and eventually paired with a male rubricata whose resemblance
in colour to a male virata evidently made him preferred, or at least
recognized as a male, in spite of differences of language.
The calls of virata have already been described (Harrison, 1957).
Besides those he lists, however, my female gave a very high, plaintive,
long-drawn " Feeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee " and, less often, a bi-syllabic
" Feeee-eeee These were given in the same situations as the Feeeu
calls of female rubricata with which they are almost certainly homolo-
gous. They are, however, even more plaintive and drawn out, almost
eerie in tone and astonishingly like one of the calls of the Sun-bittern
(Heliopyga helias ), the long-drawn " Feeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee " having the
same, sad, haunting quality as the Sun-bittern's call.
The male jamesoni speaks the same language as the female virata but in
a very different accent, the calls being, at comparable intensity, much
less loud, and rather higher in pitch. Thus the Alarm Call is a trill
essentially like that of virata but much less loud and harsh. I wrote that
of jamesoni as " trrrrrrr ", " trrrr-trr-trrt ", etc., that of virata as
" Churrrr ", " Churrrr-rrrr " when listening to them. The very harsh,
loud, nasal Contact Call (or rather one contact call) of virata , which
Harrison transcribed as " Kyew " or " Kyah " and I as " T'skya "
appear to be rendered by my male jamesoni as a much softer, husky
" tchu ". His Display Calls do not differ from that described by
Harrison for virata although as it also is very soft (by comparison with the
" squelch " and fwit " notes of rubricata) it is probably also less loud
than the comparative notes of virata.
My jamesoni also gives as, apparently, a flight-intention call, a very
soft " Tsit, tsit " which intensifies into a rapidly repeated " ti-ti-ti-ti-ti "
(the " i " pronounced as in " bit " in both cases). His " song-like "
Contact Call consists of a series of very sweet musical notes strung to-

gether and uttered either rather rapidly " We-we-we-we-we-we-we . .
or more slowly and poignantly " Weet-weet-weet-weet-weet-weet . .
Usually in the course of a few minutes calling (or singing) he will give
both fast and slow versions, commonly one is followed by the other.
The slower series is very suggestive of one of the phrases of the Wood-
lark's song. As is the case with rubricata, the male jamesoni, when singing,
goes through his complete repertoire, alarm calls excepted, and makes
at least incipient display movements when uttering the Display Galls.
An interesting point in connection with the difference in calls in the
two species is that to human ears the Alarm Galls of virata and jamesoni
sound extremely like the anger call of rubricata and not in the least like
its Alarm Call. However, the Dark Firefinches were more perceptive
than their owner in this. They respond (if at all) to the Alarm Trill of a
jamesoni (or virata) with Alarm Calls, never with their Trilling Call with
which they answer the (to me )similarly sounding trill of an unseen
member of their own species.
My male jamesoni more often gives the Stem Display without any
symbolic nesting material in the bill than with a stem or feather and
he commonly adopts a rather more horizontal posture and lifts his head
up less far than rubricata. As, however, I have only seen him display by
himself such displays as I have seen may have been only low intensity
versions.
The Greeting Display of my female virata is the same as that of rubri-
cata although she much more often gives it without the wing slapping
component. She appears only to lift and slap down her far wing in this
display when she is performing it at very high intensity. Whether this is
a specific character or an individual idiosyncrasy it is, on present
evidence, impossible to say.

Male :--Forehead and crown grey ; cheeks black ; mantle, back
and rump vinous-pink. Tail coverts and outer tail feathers pink to
crimson ; wings brown but coverts washed-pink ; underparts vinous-
pink with tiny white spots on side of breast and body. Eye red. Bill
upper mandible dark olive-green. Lower paler. Legs and feet olive-
green.
Female :--A paler edition of the male--no black on the cheeks.
The whole head being grey.
Distribution
West Africa. Senegal, Gambia, Portuguese Guinea and possibly
French Guinea. Distribution eastwards not defined.
Wild Habits
Little is known about this species. In Gambia it is local in distribution
and usually associated with bamboos and fresh water. Nothing is
known of its nesting habits.
I purchased a pair of these birds at the beginning of June, 1963, from
Mr. Liptrott. He tells me that they came to him in a consignment from
Senegal. On arrival the cock looked in very good order, but the hen
appeared a little rough. However they were put in a cage to settle
down. When settled they were not at all wild.
On 9th June they were transferred to the heated shelter of an outside
aviary 12 by 8 feet. As the weather was good, they were allowed out
after three days. Also in the same aviary were a pair of Blue-headed
and a pair of Black-cheeked Waxbills. They got on well with the
Blue-heads, but did not care much for the Black-cheeks--I suppose
owing to the slight similarity of colour. They then went into a moult
for just over a month. They appeared to eat entirely pannicum millet
and millet sprays.
On 7th August the cock was carrying nesting material, and a nest was
completed in a wicker finch basket in the shelter. The nest consisted
of grass stems copiously lined with feathers. On 13th August the hen
flew out of the nest after I had been in the shelter for a minute or so. It
thus appeared that sitting began on this day. On this surmise, according
to the habits of most other estrilds, the young should hatch on
27th August and fledge on 14th September.
On 23rd August I went abroad for a holiday until 12th September.

SIR R. COTTERELL-BREEDING THE VINACEOUS FIREFINCH IO 7
I left instructions that from 27th August ant pupae and mealworms
should be fed to them three times per day. I am told that the parents
were not out together until 2nd September, and that they were not so
avid after the ant pupae as most other waxbills with young. As is
always the case with more than one pair of birds in an enclosure, it is
impossible to ensure that the ants' eggs are available for the birds that
should have them.
On my return on 12th September I inquired if there were any young
Firefinches out, and was told not. I went to look in the aviary and was
greeted by two young birds. I did not look in the nest in case there
were more to come. The next day another young one was found dead
under the nest. This was considerably less developed than the other
two, so probably had been dead in the nest for four or five days.
The young birds were more or less uniform mouse-brown all over
with a very slight vinous wash, beak nondescript, and a very short
russet tail. They were extraordinarily tame and I could walk right up
to them on the perch.
Five days after fledging I discontinued feeding ant pupae as they were
difficult to get, and the parents did not appear very keen on them. This,
I think, was a mistake.
Four days after this the young birds, whose tails were now full length,
were chasing the parents for food but getting no response. They were
starting to pick up some seeds for themselves but appeared very
hungry. So I fed ants' eggs again for another few days. Also on this
day the hen flew out of a new nest with one egg in it. (More of this
anon.) The young went through a very tricky time from then on, as
the parents seemed to be too busy with their new nest to bother about
them. They appeared tucked-up and hungry. They were definitely
moulting by 7th October (twenty-five days after fledging) and one
was showing clear black markings on the face. By 23rd October
the young hen was almost indistinguishable from her mother though
the young cock had only about a third of his black face.
Now to revert to the second brood.
I was stupidly caught unawares by this, as all the Waxbills which I
have bred have almost invariably gone to sit on a second brood, ten
days after the previous family has fledged. Anyhow I found a barrel-
shaped nest about 5 inches long by 3 inches high built of grass stems in
some brushwood about 5 feet from the ground in the shelter. It was
much the tidiest nest I have ever seen a Waxbill make.
I immediately put in a mass of pigeon feathers, but these were not
used for about three or four days, then they all disappeared. I rather
fancy the same procedure happened the first time, i.e. the feathers were
not used until laying was completed and sitting had begun.
I decided to try an experiment with this brood, to see whether they
could be reared on mealworms alone.

<bodyText confidence="0.996547555555555" page_id="56317785"  page_num="108" year="" vol="">
On 24th September the cock was sitting hard, which meant that they
should hatch 8th October and fledge about 26th October. On 14th
October I noticed that one of the parents was still always in the nest.
But chosing my moment I was able to feel in the nest and found that
there were definitely live young.
I then went away for three days, leaving the same instructions that
mealworms should be fed three times per day.
On 17th October I noticed that the mealworms were not being taken
and both parents were looking rather disconsolate. I felt in the nest and
found four dead young--two well-grown, one medium, and one very
small. I would say that they were not big enough to have fledged on
the proper day so it looks as though they died about the time I felt in
the nest on the 14th. The crops of the two bigger ones were full of
pannicum millet and the younger ones were empty.
The cause of death may have been the objection of the old birds to
my feeling in the nest ; though this I think is most unlikely. A more
probable cause may be that in my absence the evening mealworms were
not fed early enough. Anyhow it was very sad.
They went to nest again 24th October and I was in two minds
whether to let them continue at this late date or not. However, I
finally decided to let them go on and from hatching date fed meal-
worms and an insectile mixture. Although they hatched, the young
died after a few days, and they paid no attention either to the meal-
worms or the insectile mixture.
I think the difficulty with all the estrilds is the supply of insect food
for rearing young. Ant pupae seem to be the answer, but it is an awful
labour getting enough of them to keep several breeding pairs going.
Gentles were not tried--possibly they might provide the answer.
Undoubtedly they find a lot of various insects themselves in a planted
outdoor aviary but these need supplementing in a suitable manner.
The young cock has not yet (21st November) moulted into his full
plumage, though they both look in good order--they were moved into
an indoor birdroom about a month ago.
Finally this is quite one of the most attractive Waxbills. They are
reasonably tame and I feel could be bred quite easily if the insect
problem could be solved.

(Cyanolyseus byroni)
By W. R. Partridge (Evesham, Worcs, England)
Early in 1960 ,1 was fortunate to find a very fine pair of these magnifi-
cent birds, in a dealer's shop, which I was able to purchase and bring
home and install in my bird-room, until late Spring, and then transfer
to the aviary they have since occupied. This aviary is at the end of a
range occupied mainly by pigeons, doves, softbills, and a few small
seedeaters. The flight is 21 ft. long, 5 ft. wide and 7 ft 6 in. high, with a
large indoor shelter. The Greater Patagonian Conures are the only
parrotlike birds that are regularly housed in this range, which comes
under the care of my assistant, Peter Brown, to whom I give much of
the credit for this, and other successful breedings in the same block.
The Greater Patagonian Gonure (Cyanolyseus byroni) is the largest of
the Conures, and is a native of Chile. Its colour is dark brownish-olive
on the head, neck, and upper breast, which is crossed by a greyish-
white band. The lower breast is yellow with an orange-red patch in the
middle. The wings are a lighter and brighter olive, and the rump,
yellow-bronze. The bill is horn-black. The sexes are alike in colour, but
the male of my pair is easily distinguished from the female by his
stronger head and beak, more masculine appearance, and larger
orange-red patch on lower breast. Length approximately 20 in.
This Gonure differs in size from the Lesser Patagonian Gonure
(&amp;apos;Cyanolyseus patagonus ) which comes from Patagonia and La Plata,
being some 2 or 3 in. longer than the latter, and having a more definite
greyish-white band across the upper breast.
During 1961 and 1962, the pair were supplied with a box 11 in.
square, 2 ft. 6 in. tall, hung 3 ft. above the ground, half way down one
side of the flight, but their interest was confined to chewing the box to
pieces. In the Spring of 1963 what remained of this box was removed
and replaced by a hollo wed-out log of extremely hard wood. This log
is 29 in. high, standing on a post, so that its base is again 3 ft. above the
ground, and stood on the side of the aviary in the same position as the
original box. The inside of this log measures approximately 9 in. in
diameter, and the entrance hole, which is 20 in. above the nest, is 4 in.
in diameter. The nest itself is formed of wood chippings chewed off the
inside of the log by the birds themselves, and a very small amount of
rotten wood-dust that was put in the bottom of the log when it was
installed.
The birds were of quite a shy disposition, and were never actually

seen in the nest log, so it was with some surprise that on inspecting it on
20th May, three glossy white and obviously fertile eggs were found.
As the hen was now off the nest, and in the shelter, I risked testing them
with a light, and estimated they had been incubated between five and
seven days. As incubation progressed, the pair steadied down consider-
ably, and the hen started remaining in the nest when one passed through
the aviary. The nest was not inspected again until i ith June, when the !
hen left the nest, and feeble sounds could be heard coming from inside. j
On inspection, all three eggs were found to have hatched, and the
chicks looked to be from three to five days old, which would make the
period of incubation to have been twenty-four or twenty-five days.
By the time the chicks were two weeks old, they made themselves well
heard on all possible occasions. The cock was not seen to enter the nest
until after the young were hatched; from this time onwards he was
regularly observed entering and leaving the nest, presumably to feed
the hen, and later the chicks as well, which he continued to feed together
with the hen, for several weeks after they left the nest. The youngsters
progressed rapidly in growth, and were soon well feathered, but it was
not until 4th August, when they were eight weeks old, that the first two
youngsters left the nest. The third youngster came out two days later.
The youngsters were exactly like their parents, excepting that the upper
mandible was ivory-white in colour, where in the adults, it is horn-
black. They are now, at the time of writing this article, eight months
old, and are still identifiable from their parents by the colour of their
beaks, which, although they have darkened considerably, are still much
lighter than the parents.
The young were very intelligent from the time they left the nest, and
never flew into the wire, either on the top or end of the aviary, as so
many young parrakeets will do, and almost immediately were following
their parents in and out of the shelter. The only additions to their
normal diet of canary seed, sunflower seed, and apple were several
pieces of bread each day, and an increase in the amount of green food,
in the form of spinach-beet, which I have found invaluable in the
breeding season, for most young parrakeets.
As described, W. R. Partridge has bred the Greater Patagonian
Conure Cyanolyseus byroni. It is believed that this may be a first success.
Any member or reader knowing of a previous breeding of this species
in Great Britain or Northern Ireland is requested to communicate at
once with the Hon. Secretary.

(Sporophila frontalis)
By W. R. Partridge (Evesham, Worcs, England)
In November, 1959, I had ten small South American seedeaters sent
me. They were easily identifiable as being Sporophila of some species or
other. One was a smaller bird than the rest, which I later gave away.
The remainder subsequently proved to be two cocks, and the rest hens,
of Sporophila frontalis .
As at the time I was unable to find any description of these birds,
I treated the two cocks, on account of the different colouring, as a pair,
and put them in an aviary with some various doves and pigeons. I was
further mislead by the fact that both cocks and hens uttered a short
song. What proved later to be four hens, were placed in another aviary.
In i960 nothing was done by either lot of birds, but in 1961, after the
leaves had fallen from a nut-bush in the aviary occupied by the cocks,
a cup-shaped nest built of fine twigs was found. During the winter, one
of the cocks died ; the remaining bird was put with two hens, in a
21 ft. x 8 ft aviary, shared with a pair of Green Imperial Fruit Pigeons.
To confirm that they were beyond doubt Sporophila frontalis , I wrote
to our Hon. Secretary, Mr. Arthur Prestwich, to ask if he could turn up
a description in his library. As usual, he was very helpful, and
referred the matter to Mr. Derek Goodwin, who in turn was extremely
helpful by supplying an excellent sketch and description of the birds,
which are slightly smaller and thicker built than a House Sparrow. The
cock is a general olive-brown, strongly tinged with grey throughout.
The throat is white, broken by an olive-grey streak on either side. This
white runs right down through to the abdomen, but below the throat it
inclines to become greyer than the pure white of the throat. A broad
white line runs across the brow, between the eyes, this line being broken
in the centre by olive-brown, as in the rest of the head. A narrow white
line extends above and behind the eye. The flanks are olive, and the
wings show two greyish-white bars. The beak is short, thick, with
deeply curved culmen, and is a dark horn-brown. The legs are brown.
The female is the same size as the male, is olive-green, lacking the
greyish tinge of the cock, and the chin is yellow, shading through the
throat and breast to greenish-yellow. The wing bars are buffish-brown.
Both birds have the same limited song, which can be heard for a con-
siderable distance, and consists of three or four staccato notes, followed
by a low warble. The whole song range is very short and repeated over
and over again.
Early in March, 1962, the cock, now with two hens, started showing
interest in the small body-feathers moulted by the Imperial Fruit
Pigeons that were scattered about the aviary. He would pick one up and

fly to a high perch, where he would hold it in his feet, picking it up from j
different angles and then dropping it again. A couple of weeks after his
first interest in the feathers, he started to build a nest in a small nitida
bush, about 2 ft. high. The nest was placed in the top of the bush, and
was composed entirely of very thin nitida twigs and feathers. It had a
fairly deep cup and was not lined, and it was possible to see through the
bottom. This, like all subsequent nests, was built entirely by the cock, j
and was completed in three days. No further interest appeared to be !
taken in this nest for almost a month, but on 11 th April, it was found to
contain two eggs. There is some doubt if these two eggs were laid by the
same hen, as they were entirely dissimilar, both in shape and colour.
One was elongated, resembling that of a Robin, being covered by
indistinct sandy-reddish spots, which were larger and more definite at
the thick end. The other egg was shorter and rounder, and quite j
heavily blotched with dark brown spots, particularly at the larger end.
Both eggs had a white ground.
On 13th April, one of the hens started to incubate, and the cock and
other hen were never seen near the nest, except when anyone was in the
aviary, and then, if the cock should fly in the bush, he was greeted with
hisses. The hen incubated for almost a month before she finally
abandoned the eggs, which were found to be infertile.
On 17th May, the cock was again seen carrying feathers, and there
shortly followed a second nest, again in a small nitida bush, but at the
opposite end of the aviary. At first the hen seemed to accept this nest,
but after two or three days she lost interest in it, and shortly after this,
the cock took the nest to pieces, only to reconstruct it in a small bush
overlooking a drinking pool. The hen showed no interest in it at all.
On 5th June, the hen was seen to be taking an interest in her original
nest, and on 1 ith June, two eggs were found in this nest. A further egg
was added on the 12th, when the hen started to incubate the three eggs,
which were all alike and similar in colour and shape to the latter of the
first two described above. The eggs hatched in under two weeks, and the
hen alone brooded and fed the chicks. The cock took no part in feeding
the young, and in fact, if he approached the nest, was immediately
driven off by the hen. Whilst she was rearing the youngsters she took
very little canary seed, her normal diet, but seemed to spend most of her
time catching small flies and aphis in the aviary, although she was
supplied with any amount of aphids and ants' eggs. She would take
none of them, apparently relying on her own catching efforts to feed the
chicks.
The youngsters left the nest after fourteen days, spending the first
two days on the ground and in low bushes, before they found the use
of their wings, and got on to higher perches in the aviary. Some ten
days after the youngsters left the nest, the hen went back to nest again,
laying three more eggs from which one was hatched and reared, as was

a fourth youngster from a fourth and final nest, by which time it was
well into September.
The plumage of the youngsters on leaving the nest was similar to that
of the hen, with a more yellowish tinge on the under parts. All these
youngsters, with the exception of one from the first round which had
roosted in the open and was lost in a downpour of rain one night a week
after it left the nest, proved subsequently to be hens.
I have found these finches to be extremely hardy, surviving the
extremely cold weather we had for some six weeks in 1963, in an
unheated aviary. No nest was built during 1963, due, I think, to the
fact that the cock spent a long time coming through the moult, which
he did not start until early in the New Year.
Apart from their nesting habits, and hardiness, I can find little to
recommend these birds to aviculturists. Their song is strictly limited,
they are not very colourful, and are extremely destructive to growing
bushes.
These Cayenne Seedeaters, under the care of my assistant, Peter
Brown, were housed in another part of the same range in which my
Greater Patagonian Conures bred.
As described, W. R. Partridge has bred the Cayenne Seedeater
Sporophila frontalis. It is believed that this may be a first success. Any
member or reader knowing of a previous breeding of this species in
Great Britain or Northern Ireland is requested to communicate at
once with the Hon. Secretary.

By J. J. Yealland
A Brunnich's Guillemot ( Uria l. lomvia) that flew on to a ship some
500 miles to the eastward of Cape Race, Newfoundland, was recently
brought to the Gardens. It was the first of this species ever to be in
the collection, if, indeed, it could be said to have been in the collection,
for it did not long survive, being in a very emaciated condition and its
plumage damaged by oil.
A new subspecies is a specimen of the Fairy Bluebird ( Irena puella
puella). The Javan I.p. turcosa is the only form to have been previously
kept at Regent's Park.
Dr. K. C. Searle sent from Hong Kong a pair of Chinese Bamboo
Partridges ( Bambusicola t. thoracica ), Red-flanked, Japanese and Chinese
White-eyes and a Chinese Starling ( Sturnus sinensis).
Other arrivals of particular interest are a Cheer Pheasant, Red-
headed Buntings, a White-capped Tanager, Spotted Emerald Tanager
and a pair of Azure Jays (Cyanocorax caeruleus). Kenya Eagle-Owls have
three chicks.

In the January, 1964, number of Bird Keeping in Australia there is an
interesting report that the cinnamon mutation of the Cordon-bleu is
gradually increasing, being bred by several aviculturists. A fawn or
cinnamon mutation of the St. Helena Waxbill has also appeared.

The U.S. Secretary of the Interior has announced the arrival of
thirty-three Whooping Cranes at their wintering grounds in the
Aransas National Wildlife Refuge in Texas. This is an increase of five
in the flock that had left in the spring. Of great importance is the fact
that there are no less than seven young birds of the year, whereas in the
previous year there had been none.

The Yellow-billed Hornbill Lophoceros jiavirostris was bred in the
Bloemfontein Zoological Gardens towards the end of 1961. A short
breeding account in The Ostrich , December, 1963, says that three eggs,
laid in a hollow palm stump, proved to be infertile. Shortly after two
more were laid and these were successfully hatched, after an incubation
period of twenty-one days. The young ones left the nest when they 1
were eleven weeks old. One was drowned in the pond in the aviary a
few days later but the other was apparently fully reared. On the first
attempt the cock took five days to close the nest entrance, and on the
second two only. On the second occasion the nest opening was normal
again after nine weeks.

particularly American, call Poephila gouldiae the Lady Gould Finch.
The black-headed phase of this finch was discovered by John Gilbert
on Greenhill Island, at the head of Van Diemen Gulf. John Gould, in
naming the Gouldian Finch in honour of his wife Elizabeth, writes :
" It is with feelings of the purest affection that I ventured in the folio
edition to dedicate this lovely bird to the memory of my late wife, who
for many years laboriously assisted me with her pencil, accompanied
me to Australia, and cheerfully interested herself in all my pursuits
Mrs. Gould (nee Coxen) was indeed a very skilful artist and was
responsible for many of the plates in her husband's works. The mother
of five children, Mrs. Gould died at the early age of thirty-seven
(i8thjuly, 1804-15^ August, 1841).
It is quite correct to preface Amherst's Pheasant with " Lady ", also
to apply the title to the one time Lady Impey's Pheasant, now com-
monly Impeyan : but Lady Gould's Finch is quite inadmissable.

This is stated to be a distributional list, published in association with

region. Most of these involved travelling the " hard way ", sometimes
in virtually unexplored territory, before the advent of aeroplanes, and
in themselves are of considerable geographical interest.
The birds of this region are more numerous than might have been
anticipated, a total of 338 species and sub-species being covered in the
present work. Forty-six of these are classified as Accidental-Visitants,
mostly from other parts of America but ten are definitely of European
origin. Three species--two puffins and a petrel--from the Southern
Hemisphere, which come north to escape the southern winter, are
classified as Summer-Migrants. Twenty species are Transient-
Visitants, breeding in the far north and wintering to the south beyond
the limits of Labrador. There are 49 Permanent-Residents, but many
of these are resident only in the sense that they are known to pass the
winter season somewhere in the territory and most of them move about
with the changing seasons. Four species are Winter-Residents breeding
outside the area. The great bulk of the avifauna, however, is composed
of 200 species and sub-species of Summer-Resident birds, which
winter farther south and migrate northward in spring to reach their
breeding grounds, leaving again on the approach of winter.
The general introduction is followed by a systematic list of the species
and their study and consideration from a taxonomic standpoint is an
important part of the memoir. The main theme, however, is concerned
with the problems of distribution, general and local, of the Labrador
avifauna. All definite locality-records for each species have been
plotted on separate maps and some of them are reproduced in the present
volume. The presentation is aimed to show the significance of climatic,
ecological, and topographic conditions as distributional factors. The
result is a valuable addition to our knowledge of the avifauna of a little
known region.

As justly stated in the introduction to the present volume, Peters'
Check-list has long been recognized as an indispensable reference for
reliable information on the classification, correct names, synonymies
and geographical distribution of birds and there is nothing like it in
the world literature for any other kind of organism.

vernacular names. There were criticisms on the selection of the

feel that an effort should be made to standardize and supply appro-
priate English names for all species. This would have involved cumber-
some polls and other elaborate procedures beyond the scope of a
scientific work, so acting on the advice of ten of the 12 authors of this
and forthcoming volumes the vernacular names have been omitted.
This step will be regretted by the less experienced amateur but it was
obvious that the Editors could not take any other decision.
Volume X deals with two families of the Passeriformes, Suborder
Oscines, of very unequal size, comprising the Prunellidae (Accentors)
with only one genus Prunella and the Muscicapidae divided into six
sub-families. S. Dillon Ripley is responsible for the Prunellidae and the
sub-family Turdinae (Thrushes) ; the sub-family Polioptilinae (Gnat
catchers and allies) is by Raymond A. Paynter Jr. and the remaining
four sub-families--Orthonychinae (Logrunners), Timaliinae
(Babblers), Panurinae (Parrotbills) and Picathartinae (Picathartes) i
are by Herbert G. Deignan.

Following Mr. C. Naether's interesting article in this magazine for November-
December, 1963, I would like to state that the typical form criniger inhabits Mindanao,
with a closely related form in Samar and the Basilan group of islands. The late Madame
E. Lecallier and M A. Decoux, in France, reared the species several times between
1920 and 1939--I was myself successful at Los Angeles between 1953 and 1958, ten
birds being raised to maturity by one pair. After the death of the breeding male,
the female, mated to one of her sons, never laid again, neither at Los Angeles, nor since
i960 at Cleres, where she still lives. This dove never lays more than one egg in a
clutch, while the Common Luzon Bleeding-heart lays two.

Upupa epops longirostris Jerdon
By Kenton C. Lint (Curator of Birds, San Diego Zoological Garden,
Calif., U.S.A.)
This paper reports the successful nesting and rearing of two Thailand
Hoopoe chicks. It is believed to be the first breeding record for the
family in the Western Hemisphere as well as the first captive breeding
record for this subspecies.
Upupidae is a monospecific family of Old World birds with nine
subspecies ranging over southern Europe east to Asia and south across
Africa to Madagascar.
Captive observations on the nesting habits of this family have been
rarely reported due to the fact that hoopoes are difficult to maintain.
On 16th September, 1961, six specimens of the Thailand Hoopoe
arrived from Bangkok. These birds were collected by Mr. Swart
Chantharojvong, collector and exporter of Thailand fauna. Since the
birds were yearlings, no breeding activity was observed in 1961 nor in
1962.
In September, 1963, twenty-three new aviaries were designed and
constructed for the exhibition of exotic birds. The Hoopoes were moved
from their old aviary into one of the new aviaries. A new cage was
especially designed for these birds, measuring 7 feet in height, 6 feet in
width, and 6 feet in depth. Since they are hole nesters, recesses were
constructed for nesting facilities. A wooden box 14 inches long, 16 inches
wide, and 15 inches high with a 6-in. entrance was bolted on the
inside to the cement wall.
In 1963, a pair of birds showed interest in the nesting facilities
although no mating was observed and no eggs were laid.

interested in each other and subsequent mating was observed. A daily
ration of from six to eight mealworms was fed to each. The male would
take a mealworm in his bill, advance to the female and present the
grub. He would then wait until she had accepted and devoured his
offering. The cock, a particularly tame bird, would fly to the aviary
wire begging for an additional mealworm. If this was given he would
return to the hen, repeating the performance until her appetite was
satisfied. After the feeding she was seen to fly to a perch and rest. Only
then did the male feed himself. It appears the females will accept food
from the males only after they have reached a particular stage in the
sexual cycle. From our observations it would seem that the males are
the first to come into breeding condition. Food passing is a form of
courtship and an important feature in the breeding behaviour of the
family Upupidae.
Selection of the Nest
We observed that the nesting site was chosen by the male, a box
placed in a recess in the aviary wall. The cock runs around, raising
and lowering his crest, fluttering about, at the same time producing
soft calls to attract the hen's attention. This interesting courtship
behaviour was observed for approximately a fortnight, during which
time the hen was indifferent to the advances of the cock.
On the 27th March, the male was seen to be paying particular
interest in the nesting site. He would fly suddenly to the hole, enter
and exit, after which he would walk round and round, displaying and
calling to the female to consider his choice. Several days passed with
the hen giving but little notice to the male's behaviour. However,
on the 6th April, the female was seen to peer into the nest, though with-
out the sustained interest of her suitor. The following morning, 4 inches
of pine shavings were placed in the nest--which appeared to spur the
hen's interest. Both birds were observed entering the nest where they
spent a greater part of the day.
Further observations showed the pair would come to the ground,
feed, then return to the nest. We could now expect the laying of eggs i
within a short period.
Eggs and Incubation
In the literature, the clutch is said to consist of from four to six pale
blue eggs (Austin, 1961). On the 11 th April the hen was observed
sitting on a single egg. We believe that the second and third eggs were
laid on the 12th and 13th April respectively. The first egg, unfortun-
ately, was infertile. Only the hen sits, eighteen days, for the incubation
period. She leaves the nest only to drink and for short intervals during i
the morning and evening. As in the case of Hornbills, she is fed in the
nest by the male.

On the i st May I passed the Hoopoe aviary and heard a faint
squeaking coming from the nest. This sound is reminiscent of that
made by baby mice. I immediately placed a container of small
mealworms in the aviary. The cock bird carried eight mealworms, in
separate trips, to the sitting hen. We believe the mealworms were later
regurgitated to feed the nestlings.
For a fortnight following hatching the male continued to feed the
hen who would not allow him to enter the nest. She would raise her
crest, wing, and body feathers in order to block the nesting hole. On
the sixteenth day the cock was first seen in the nest feeding the young.
Shortly thereafter the chicks could be seen moving around in the nest,
begging food.
When seen leaving the nest the young were perfect replicas of their
parents though somewhat smaller, duller in coloration, and with shorter
bills. The chicks remained in the nest for twenty-eight days. One chick
flew out of the nest on the twenty-eighth day, the second on the
twenty-ninth day.
Because Hoopoe nestlings are fed insectile food, great quantities of
insects must be provided daily. We believe the young birds are reared
primarily on live food--mealworms, earthworms, and larvae of the
Larder Beetle ; therefore, in addition to the basic diet, Table i, the
following feeding schedule was established :--

The mealworms we feed are Tenebrio molitor, averaging approxi-
mately 50 mg. each ; these are purchased weekly and are packed in
wheat bran which contains some larvae of the Larder Beetle (Dermestes
lardarius). About 120 grams of soil containing innumerable newly
hatched earthworms are also placed in the aviary each morning and
evening.
Our observations indicated that the majority of these worms was not
consumed by the adults ; but rather, they were carried to the nest to
provide food for the the young. The chicks, now thirty-six days old, have
been down to the feeding area but have not yet been seen eating by
themselves.
Contrary to the stories found in the literature referring to filth in the
nest and a malodorous secretion expelled by the female during the
brooding season, our experience has been that the nests were clean and
the female at no time gave off an unpleasant smelling liquid as a
protective measure for the nest.

Who they are, How they are kept and bred
Jack L. Throp (Curator of birds, Arizona Zoological Society, Phoenix,
Arizona, U.S.A.)
I have found that there is a dearth of information concerning
Curassows in avicultural literature. They are bred in captivity,
infrequently and seldom is the event recorded in any detail. Even then
the details are sometimes conflicting. The following article is an effort
to introduce the Curassow as an aviary bird, to aid in identifying them
and to lend to the general knowledge information based on the rearing
of thirty-four young by the combined efforts of myself and Bernard Roer
of Phoenix.
Curassows are the principle members of the family Cracidae, the
others being the Guans and Chachalacas. They are chiefly tree
dwellers from the forests of South and Central America. The Curassows
are large and heavy birds, some species equal turkeys in size. The
general colour characteristics for the group would be, males--black
bodies with white abdomens and a crest that is strongly curled forward,
the females--marked or barred with black, brown and white,
abdomens chestnut-brown, and also crested.
There is a certain amount of confusion in the common names of the
various species of Curassows ; there even exists some disagreement
among taxonomists as to the number of subspecies. In this regard
I have followed the nomenclature of Peters and endeavour to avoid
any arguments. As for the common names, we have purchased
" Crested 55 Curassows three different times from dealers and received
three different species--and none of these were the bird generally
accepted as being the Crested Curassow. I can hope that the following
list of species and subspecies will help to clarify matters. I will say that
it can relieve some of my own tensions to see it all down in an orderly
fashion.
Great Crested Curassow, frequently called Globose, Mexican.
Crax rubra rubra (synonym -globicera, panamensis , hecki , chapmani ).
Range : from southern Mexico throughout Central America to
western Ecuador.
This species is the largest of the Curassows. The male has a black
body with a blue-green reflection to the feathers, the abdomen is
snowy white, the legs are black, the crest is strongly curled forward, tail
is black with the outer feathers sometimes tipped with white, the eyes
are brown, the bill is black, with a yellow base. A conspicuous yellow
knob on the upper mandible grows an even more intense yellow during
the breeding season. There exists a barred black phase of this bird that
is very rare. Raymond H. Paynter says that probably every local

considered a distinct species by the Mayas and is known as Bolonchan.
The females differ entirely from the males. The crest is barred with
white and is even more showy than the males, the head, neck and
throat are barred with black and white. The chest and mantle are
black washed with rufous, the lower back is chestnut-brown, the under
parts are cinnamon.

Their discovery actually took place on the mainland and undoubtedly
in an Indian village where they strolled among the huts, skirting around
groups of native women grinding meal or stepping out of the way of
running naked children. Indians have always sought the nests of the
arboreal dwelling Gurassow and raise the young by hand. The Indians,
of course, have a final object in mind when they assume the task of hand
rearing a Gurassow, the flesh is delicious. Friendly tame birds, Curassows
make fine camp-mates. Curassows thrive in confinement but the hopes
once held by the Spanish for their domestication ended in disappoint-
ment. They are poor breeders in confinement.
As far as records show, and these are largely from E. Hopkinson's
" Birds Bred in Captivity ", the Great Crested Gurassow was the first
to be bred. This was in Marseilles in 1825 by the Marquis de Montgard
as recorded in Le Bulletin de la Societe Nationale de France , 1854,
page 123. In the 1893 volume another French success is stated,
page 349, that of Le Grange in 1888 and 1892. They were also bred in
the London Zoo in 1910. I believe that this was the instance told by
the author Frank Finn in which he says that a Globose Curassow cock
(Great Crested) was devoted to a hen of the handsome zebra-marked
aberrational type described as Crax hecki, preferring her to three normal
coloured hens. One chick was hatched, a female, a typical globicera
{rubra). This was then believed to be a hybrid hatching but hecki is
no longer considered distinct from rubra.
The first Curassow to be reared in the United States was in 1913 ; a
Mrs. Thompson of New York raised a Great Crested from two eggs.
The eggs were taken away and a young one reared under a chicken--
Crandall, New York Zoological Society Bulletin 1917, page 1449.
Crandall also noted that an earlier American record (Gould 1909)
cannot stand as the young were not fully reared. A little later the
New York Zoological Society had a success of its own as reported by
the current Director of that zoo, William G. Conway. " On June 1,
1909, the Zoological Park received from Buenos Aires a Banded
Curassow, Craxfasciolata. The subspecies was not distinguished and at
this time of course we cannot be sure. Later on, September 20, 1915,
the zoo received still another curassow. The first bird had been a
female ; this last specimen was a male of the same species and it came
from Maracaibo. These two specimens bred in 1918. An egg was
placed under a broody and a young one was hatched and reared with-
out incident. I am afraid I have very little more in the way of details
except that the young was reared by the foster parent. The young
bird died in 1923."
A recent report of a successful breeding of both curassows and guans
appeared in the July-August 1956 issue of the Avicultural Magazine
by J. Carpentier, curator of birds of the Royal Zoological Society,
Antwerp, Belgium. Further reference will be made to this fine article.

In the same year a Mr. Grant Rothhammer of Melrose, Florida,
raised a Crested Curassow. A letter from Mr. Rothhammer tells of
the event. " During 1956 I produced three Curassow eggs in my pens
from birds that I had owned for five years. I had produced two eggs
the previous year but they were not fertile. I placed the eggs in a hot
water incubator, one hatched. I was about as surprised at his hatching
as he was at being hatched. I put it with a bantam hen in a 4 ft. by 8 ft.,
6 ft. high, J-in. wire pen. The baby was the wildest, toughest baby
I ever raised, no end to how wild and how scary. Yet I never saw a
baby so fond of its mother. At half grown when I finally moved it
from the bantam it grieved an awful lot. Now this baby was extra
hardy, never seemed to have a weak moment. It was tough and ready
to go before it got dry. I never saw anything so hardy and it seemed
extra large to come from that size egg. And it grew extra fast, much
faster than peafowl or turkey and matured better as it went without
being wing heavy like lots of birds."
I am sure that more people have reared Curassows in this country
but locating just who has and when is very difficult information to come
by. The conclusion must be drawn that Curassows are seldom raised in
captivity. Like every bird that we keep in our aviaries there is a reason
or reasons or group of circumstances responsible for their failure to
reproduce in captivity. In regard to the Curassow, Mr. Conway has
put forth these reasons, " It is my experience that very few females of
those species which have different coloured females are imported.
Then too, I don't think many people have made an effort to breed
Curassows ". This is probably quite true but surprising for I have
found the Curassows to be the most interesting of all gallinaceous birds
to care for and they are not difficult to raise if one bothers to accom-
modate them. The bother has been, for me, a pleasure.
In 1957 I was curator for the Buteyn Bird Ranch in San Luis Rey,
California, where I first had the pleasure of working with these birds.
Mr. Buteyn bought a pair of Red Wattled Curassows, Crax blumenbachii ,
from a dealer in Florida. Three months later we purchased a pair of
Greater Razor-billed Curassows, Mitu mitu. It took a year of observa-
tion to decide that we had two males instead of a pair of the latter.
A trade with Bernard Roer of Phoenix, Arizona, who had also bought a
pair of Greater Razor-bills and found them to be two females, turned
out profitably for us both. The Red Wattled hen laid in 1958 and
I raised two males under bantams. These were sold to the San Diego
Zoo. In the ensuing years through 1961 I raised eight Red Wattled
Curassows and six Razor-billed Curassows.
Bernard Roer, in 1957, acquired a male Red Wattled Curassow but
when he tried to find a mate for him he was sent a female Prince
Albert's Curassow, Crax a. alberti. He raised eight hybrids from this pair
in 1958, four in 1959, two in i960. In 1961 he raised six Red Wattled

babies from a purchased blumenbachii hen mated to the original male.
He also had a Razor-bill chick but it was killed by an accident when it
was only a few days old. Mr. Buteyn reared four fine Razor-bills in
I 9 62 -
The total reared to maturity by Bernard Roer and myself is thirty-
four curassows. I believe this is a larger number from which to base
collective information than anybody has previously had.
Climate may certainly be a factor in rearing Curassows. Though
there is little similarity between Phoenix, Arizona and southern
California in climate, the winters in both states seldom drop below
freezing. Curassows are fair weather birds. The curator of Birds at the
Philadelphia Zoo, John A. Griswald, has written, " it is generally
accepted that the feet of the Cracidae are quite susceptible to frost-bite
in our climate ". The Pittsburg Zoo found that they are not at all hardy
to cold and soon become crippled with rheumatic or arthritic condi-
tions, malformed toes, etc. Delacour once wrote that they have a
serious drawback, being very susceptible to cold, never bearing much
frost without losing their toes.
During the 1962-63 winter Phoenix experienced a temperature low
of 25 degrees. Roer had several Red Wattled Curassows at complete
liberty and therefore able to choose the most protected roosting sites
available and still two of the birds had toes injured by frostbite.
Weather severe as this is not at all general in southern Arizona or
California so housing is seldom used for gallinaceous birds. Climates
subject to freezing weather must provide heated quarters.
Curassows like to be off the ground. Generally for the few that are
seen in collections no provision is given for this arboreal preference to
manifest itself. Curassows are often treated as though they were
pheasants. If the birds are given ample branches to climb and perch
upon they will spend nearly half of the daylight hours above ground.
In the natural state curassows prefer heavy growth. Scutch says that
they come into the clearings very seldom.
Nesting by Curassows in nature is done in the trees. An open tub or
half barrel in the highest convenient place in the aviary will be readily
accepted by the pair. Lewis W. Walker of the Arizona-Sonora Desert
Museum at Tucson had a pair of the Roer hybrids in a large aviary.
The birds chose a nest site in a large Palo Verde tree. They would
walk out to the ends of the heavy branches, break off the smaller ones,
and carry them to the centre of the tree where they built a platform
nest in a fork. The male aided in the construction. It is advisable to
create ample shade for the nesting receptacle. Curassows like to feel
that the nest is secluded and at least partially concealed.
Because of their climbing ability they are not indefinitely kept in
anything but an enclosed aviary. Birds with clipped or pinioned wings,
like peafowl, are still powerful jumpers and difficult to keep in an open

<bodyText confidence="0.991875422222222" page_id="56317819"  page_num="130" year="" vol="">
pen. Also in clipping the wing, considering that Gurassows love to be
above ground, the danger of a broken leg is threatened.
As release birds they do well on areas where many trees are available,
such as an orchard. Birds released in their first year stay close to their
home and the food. As they mature unmated males will wander and
must be eventually confined. A mated pair at Roers stayed steadily but
didn't reproduce. The female took great interest in a nest-box provided
but failed to lay. As the spring wore on she began to stray in increas-
ingly wider circles until it was necessary to pen her. An adult male can
be a dangerous animal and so is not generally kept in a free state about
public places. Marvin C. Cecil, curator at the Caribbean Gardens in
Florida, says that nearly all of the birds roam free in the Gardens.
Gurassows were tried but one soon injured a little boy that attempted to
feed the bird and they were traded off for more congenial fare. A large
Great Crested Curassow male once owned by Ernest Crowell would
make repeated attacks on a person and could only be repelled by
vigorous force. He seemed not ready to give up until exhausted.
A male Razor-billed Curassow at Buteyn's would attack only if your
back was turned but this he would do with regularity. Males will also
attack other large birds such as peafowl, and we have known them to
challenge even Rheas. The females do not become aggressive. They
are safe with other birds. We have placed Curassow young of various
ages and species with their bantam hens in an aviary occupied by an
adult hen. She accepted them with friendly interest.
This same show of temperament is often bent upon their mates.
The Great Crested already mentioned nearly killed his female several
times. After watching a display of this male's malice towards the hen it
seemed remarkable that she ever laid fertile eggs, which she did with
regularity. This aggressiveness expressed by some males is certainly a
factor to be considered in keeping Gurassows but it should not be
construed as universal behaviour. The three breeding pairs kept at
Buteyn's were certainly affable birds and completely desirable aviary
mates. Owing to the aggressiveness of the cocks we believe that the
small groups found in the wild are family groups, the male, the female,
and one or two offspring.
Curassows mature in their second year. First year birds resemble
adults but are smaller in stature and weight. We had a female
blumenbachii lay in her first year, the eggs were not fertile. Her com-
panion male was of the same age. If she had mated with an older male
the eggs might have been fertilized. We have made no effort to breed
young birds. It seems advisable to wait until full growth is obtained and
this is in the second year.
Curassows lay two eggs to a clutch. Only once have I had a clutch
of three eggs. They are usually laid two days apart. If the eggs are
removed the hen will lay again in about twenty days. Roer had a

Red Wattled hen lay fourteen eggs during the nesting season. A Red
Wattled hen at Buteyn's laid twelve. The average, when the eggs are
removed, seems to be about four clutches per pair. I found in looking
back over records that seven eggs per pair occurred a few times. This
was caused by a hen laying a one-egg clutch, generally late in the
season. The Red Wattled Curassow began laying on 7th February in
1961 at Buteyn's, the Razor-billed on 24th February. Curassow eggs
are large for the size of the bird. The shell has a rough granular
texture, white in colour. I have never had one deliberately break an
egg, although Rothhammer says that his pair ate many a pheasant and
duck egg.
I used bantam hens to incubate the eggs. Twice each day I would
turn the eggs for her ; I have never trusted a bantam to be able to turn
such a large egg effectively. Roer prefers a turkey hen to incubate
Curassow eggs. He believes that he gets better results but a turkey hen
is inclined to kill the chicks when they hatch so he removes the eggs a
day before hatching and puts them in an incubator. After the chick
hatches he puts it under a bantam for her to rear. The chicks seem to
want a mother and it is felt that they would do badly in a brooder
without a hen.
If the eggs are left in the nest only the female Curassow does the
incubating. The male stays nearby or as one author said, even on the
nest itself. They are good brooders in captivity generally.
The chick hatches on the 29th day. This was invariably the period
of incubation for every chick hatched by Roer or myself. In Carpentier's
article on breeding curassows in the July-August, 1956, Avicultural
Magazine he states that the incubation for a pair of Razor-bills was
twenty-two days. But in the additional data at the end of the article
he says that the second egg was laid on the 10th July and that young
were seen on 10th August. Twenty-two days must certainly be a
miscalculation. One account that I found said that the Nocturnal
Curassow had an incubation of twenty-four days and another that the
Galeated Curassow was from thirty-four to thirty-six days. Of the four
species that we reared, Red Wattled, Great Crested, Prince Albert's,
and the Greater Razor-billed, twenty-nine days was the period required
for development.
The chick hatches immediately after pipping the egg. There is no
delay for rest or to build up strength. Roer said that it was a long time
before he actually caught an egg just pipped. The eggs would either
be whole or the chick would be out drying off. The chicks have a very
heavy down. In the one chick that was raised by its parents we noted
good reason for the thick down. The chick was brooded by the hen
for the first two nights in the nest and then the chick roosted inde-
pendently of its mother. Coming to her at dawn to be brooded and
loved and fed, but sleeping by itself at night. Incubating the eggs with

bantams presented few problems. A hen was given the two eggs and
they were faithfully turned twice daily. On the twenty-ninth day a box
with a screen top was placed over the hen's nesting box to keep the
chicks from wandering. The Curassow chick is hatched strong and will
more than likely be on the hen's back in a few hours. I tested day-
old chicks ability to perch and climb. They possessed a fair sense of
balance and if placed on a branch were generally able to stay there, but
not one of the day-olds was able to grip with the feet strongly enough
to retain its position under slight duress. On the second day they are
much surer. On the third they are full of confidence and ability to
scramble along any perch. The wings of the newly-hatched young
have distinct flight feathers which grow very rapidly.
A high percentage of curassows in captivity have crooked toes, most
of these are imported birds. The first Razor-billed Curassow that
I reared developed such badly deformed feet that it was necessary to
destroy it. At the outset it was believed that the cause was dietary since
we understand only the rudimentary needs of Curassow diet. But with
an analysis of the situation it was apparent that this was an external
problem rather than internal neglect. Curassows are taken from the
nest or captured as young birds by the South or Central American
natives and reared in the villages as " ground dwelling birds ". The
chicks have little opportunity to flex the toes in climbing and perching.
We corrected this detail and from the time our Curassow chicks were
put in the rearing boxes with their bantam mothers they had perches.
As they grew a greater variety of sizes of perches were available to them.
Not a case of crooked toes has been experienced since our first experi-
ments in Curassow culture. This same practice has since been applied to
various gallinaceous birds with gratifying success. It is particularly
effective with Green Peafowl, Ceylon Jungle Fowl and other pheasants
that seem prone to crooked toes.
Curassows are extremely hardy and resistant to almost anything but
frost. We lost very few chicks, and these losses were due to colds and
coccidiosis. They are strong at birth, grow rapidly and are generally
active and personable birds throughout their lives. Their longevity is
unknown, Roer has a female Prince Albert's that has been in his
collection nearly twenty years and still lays fertile eggs.
No great problems are met with as concerns food. Curassows do very
well on a game-bird ration with a little soft fruit added. The chicks are
fed a game-bird starter mash with hard boiled egg yolk sprinkled over
the top. They feed readily. Early accounts led us to believe that rearing
Curassows would present many difficulties. It was said that the chicks
required insect food, that they would not feed from the ground, that
the parents fed the young from her beak for the first ten weeks and that
they were not completely independent for some time after that. This
has not been our experience at all. Mr. J. Carpentier's article in the

July-August, 1956, Avicultural Magazine is an authoritative
description of nesting and parental care of Gurassows and well worth
re-reading.
The Red Wattled's display is the only Curassow display that I have
seen. It is probably typical of most species. The crest, which is the
most striking development of the bird, is not used in the mating
display. It is used instead in moments of nervousness, aggression, or
inquisitiveness, and its use is very expressive, but it seems not an
adornment to attract a mate. During the display the male lays his
head back on his shoulders in an awkward manner. The tail is raised
so that the showy white under tail-coverts are conspicuous and a
circling trot around the female is made over and over again. The effect
is lost on most observers but fortunately not on blumenhachii hens.
In conclusion, Gurassows are not difficult to breed or to rear, they
are generally quite tame and possess marvellous personalities. They
seem to be at their best exhibited in an aviary that provides ample
climbing room and the opportunity to nest off the ground.

By Charles Everett (Trenton, N. J., U.S.A.)
It was in December, 1959, that Mr. Boehm received a pair of Red-
winged Starlings from England, originally coming from Basutoland,
South Africa. There are five races of these birds, the nominate one,
Onychognathus morio mono , was the species we received. Its habitat
extends from Nyasaland, through Portuguese East Africa, down into
South Africa. One sub-species, 0 . m. ruppellii , synonymous with O.m.
shelleyi , ranges through the Sudan, Ethiopia, and Tanganyika.
A second, found in northern Nigeria and the north Cameroons, is
O.m. neymanni and a western race, O.m. modicus, inhabits the Upper
Guinea area, and the race, 0 . m. montanus, is a highland bird found at
elevations up to 9,000 feet on Mt. Elgon in Kenya. They are all very
similar in general colouring, the main variations consisting of body size
(the entire race varying from 10J to 14 inches in total length), and the
shape and length of the bill.
The nominate race, which was housed at the Boehm Aviaries, is
about 11 inches in length. The sexes are dissimilar, the adult male
being glossy violet-black above, with greenish ear-coverts. The
primaries are chestnut-red with black tips and the under-parts are
glossy blue-black. The long, slender bill is black, as are the legs and
feet. The iris is brown with a red outer rim. The adult female's head
and neck are grey, with violet and blue-black streaks. The upper chest

also is grey, streaked with blue-black, these markings being much
broader than those on the head and neck. All other colouring is the
same as in the male.
After being kept in one of the reception pens for the winter months,
the pair was released in April, i960, into a large planted aviary,
60 by 40 feet, the only aviary on the establishment completely open to
the weather, and unheated. This they shared with numerous other
birds, four species of Touracos, Black-headed Sibias, Mesias, Pekin
Robins, Jay Thrushes, Cocks of the Rock, Blackbirds, etc. all agreeing
very well. In order to provide an element of protection, a pane of glass
was removed from the window of one of the reception pens abutting
on to this aviary, so that any of the birds seeking shelter could return to
it. Many chose to do so and feed pans were maintained in there
throughout the year. This proved a great asset when it came to
catching the birds up for return to winter quarters, for they could be
trapped in there and transferred to their various allotted pens.
However, it was not until 1962, their third return to the aviary, that
the Red-winged Starlings made any attempt to go to nest. Up to then
they had, in their customary manner, been most sociable towards all
the other birds, and were quite entertaining with their melancholy call.
This consisted of a piping whistle, either in single notes or a variety of
phrases, both birds giving vent to it, although that of the male was
slightly stronger, and the phrases of notes more extended. Towards the
end of March that year the female attempted to build a nest on the top
of one of the perch " trees" in the retiring rooms. Realising that the
small area, about 4 inches in diameter, was totally inadequate, we
secured a 9 inch square open box with 4 inch sides on top of the
" tree ". With the male assisting in collecting material, the female soon
completed a nest of twigs, bound with mud, and lined with soft grasses.
It was largish, almost completely filling the nest-box. A solitary egg,
bluish-green in general colour but with rufous spots and blotches, and
measuring 33 by 25 mm., was laid, but it disappeared two days later,
and the birds took no further interest in the nest.
In May, the female began building in an open-fronted nest-box out
in the aviary. As before, only one egg was laid, which duly hatched on
7th June, after a fourteen day incubation, carried out by the female
only. Now their sociable manner changed, and the male became most
possessive of the area in the vicinity of the nest. Not only did he keep
the other birds at a safe distance, but he also made swooping attacks
on any of us if we approached too near for his liking. It made no
difference if we had live-food with us, particularly for him and his
family, for he kept up his attacks until we had deposited the food in his
special tray and retired to a respectable distance. As in the case of the
Derby Flycatcher the previous year, it became the order of the day to wear
some form of headgear when making the regular hourly excursions with

live-food. Despite all this, success was not to be ours for, on 18th June,
the nestling was found dead on the ground immediately below the nest-
box. It was quite large, with a fair amount of feathering on the wings,
although the body was bare, and it could only be surmised that it had
fallen out, for it was well nourished and did not give the appearance
of having died in the nest. Thus closed the 1962 season so far as this
species was concerned and, after another winter inside, the pair were
returned to the same aviary in April, 1963.
Late in June last year they began bringing nesting material back into
the room so the nesting tray was again secured to the " tree ". The
female lost no time getting her nest completed and, on 2nd July, laid
the first of three eggs. Incubation began with the laying of the first, and
they hatched on the 16th, 17th, and 18th. The nestlings were pink-
skinned, sparsely covered with a black fuzz, and had gapes of bright
pink. Both parents attended to the rearing and, being in the room, it
was much easier to ensure that the live-food supplied was consumed
solely by them. Further, although protesting orally when we entered
the room, it was possible, with a degree of craft, to follow the develop-
ment of the chicks. At seven days old their eyes were open and quill
feathers were visible in their wings. Although the last to be hatched
was found dead in the nest at eleven days old, the other two finally
vacated the nest, fully feathered, at twenty-two and twenty-five days
old respectively.
They were sooty-black with a slight sheen, one more apparent than
the other, and they both possessed the chestnut-red primaries of the
adult birds. Full independence was attained at thirty-four days by both
fledglings and, shortly after this they had to be removed as the male
began chasing them around. The reason for this quickly became
apparent for the female went to nest again, and laid three more eggs as
before, of which but two hatched, the other being clear.
By the time the first brood was five months old, grey feathering began
to show in the head of the duller one. This indicated that the fledgling
degree of sheen might well be a sex characteristic. This point was
further borne out by the second brood for both these fledglings were of
the duller tone, and eventually turned out to be females.
The first brood birds have since been presented to the Cleveland
Zoo, the two younger females being retained for future breeding.
Mr. Boehm also has one odd adult male so, space permitting, it is
planned to pair this to one of the young females with a hope of breeding
to the third generation. At the present time all three birds are together,
the parent birds being located elsewhere, so that the untried male has
the opportunity of himself selecting his future mate.

[Psephotus varius)
From a specimen reportedly collected at Spencers Gulf in 1802,
Kuhl described the Mulga Parrot as Psittacus multicolor in 1820. The
original manuscript mentioning this bird was reputed to be the work
of Brown, who probably collected the type specimen, but Clark (1910)
subsequently rejected this and attributed it to Temminck. With the
introduction of the genus Psephotus , the scientific name for the species
became Psephotus multicolor and so remained for many years. In 1910
Clark drew attention to the previous use of this name for the Rainbow
Lorikeet by Gmelin in 1788. Although this name was later invalidated
by taxonomists, it did constitute a case of preoccupied nomenclature
and the new specific name of varius, put forward by Clark, became valid.
The early scientific name, and the common vernacular name of
Many-coloured Parrot are both very apt because this bird affords the
observer a showy combination of colours in its brilliant plumage.
Green predominates in the adult male. The back, scapulars and upper
secondaries are bluish-green, while the head and breast are bright
emerald-green. Yellow is exhibited on the forehead and the humeral
patch. There is a cinnamon-red patch on the top of the head. The
upper abdomen and flanks are yellowish-green and this is in strong
contrast to the lower abdomen and thighs, which are deep scarlet
intermixed with yellow. The vent and under tail-coverts are yellow
tinged with red. The wing primaries are brilliant ultramarine on the
outer edges and offset by a brownish-black on the inner edges and tips.
This colour is also found on the undersides of the wings. Light bluish-
green is found on the rump and upper tail-coverts, which are marked
with an ill-defined yellowish-green band. This band is bordered by a
dark bluish-green line near the back and a dull reddish line towards the
tail. The tail is similar to that of the other broadtails. Dark green
with washings of dark blue characterize the upper surface of the central
feathers, while the under surface is darkish brown. The secondary
feathers show the upper surface bright blue becoming very pale
towards the tips, which are white. The under surface of the secondary
feathers is very pale blue. The bill is greyish-black, the iris dark brown,
and the feet grey. The adult female differs markedly from its showy
mate in having the upper parts and the breast dusky-brown tinged with
green. The yellow is absent from the forehead and is replaced by brick
red on the humeral patch. The abdomen and under tail-coverts are
very pale green. The bill is greyish-black, the iris dark brown, and the

Mathews (1917), on comparing this species with Ps. haematonotus ,
noticed several differences between the birds. The Mulga Parrot had a
more projecting bill with a more pointed tip, while the tail was pro-
portionately longer, well exceeding the length of the wing. The wing,
although of a similar pattern, was also noticeably longer. These
distinctions, together with the colour pattern, gave rise to the tabulation
of the subgenus Clarkona. There are no valid features upholding this
subgenus and, apart from a mention by Richmond (1927), it has been
generally neglected by recent authorities.
The invalidity of multicolor did not escape Mathews and, in 1911,
unaware of Clark's rearrangement, he instituted dulciei as a replacement.
However, varius was accepted by all and has subsequently enjoyed
widespread recognition.
Psephotus varius varius , the typical race, is found in the Yorke and
Eyre's Peninsula area of South Australia. It was in this district that
Mathews believed that the type specimen was collected.
From a bird taken on Yorke Peninsula, South Australia, Mathews,
in 1912, described Psephotus varius rosinae. This race was reported to
differ from the typical bird in having much less red on the abdomen
and deeper green on the upper breast.
In 1912 Mathews instituted yet another subspecies in Psephotus
varius exsul from a specimen collected at Mount Magnet, Western
Australia. The distinguishing feature was its generally bluer colora-
tion, especially noticeable on the cheeks. Following examination of
skins from Mid-Western Australia, which is the tabulated range of this
bird, the author believes the distinguishing feature to be inconsistent
and not valid as the basis for a different race.

JOSEPH M. FORSHAW-THE PARROTS OF AUSTRALIA
S. A. White collected an adult male in the Macdonnell Ranges,
Central Australia in 1913 and subsequent examination of the bird by
Mathews resulted in the establishment of Psephotus varius ethelae in 1917.
The range was given as Central Australia. The paler general colora-
tion and the reduced paler red on the abdomens of the males were
given as the marks of this variation. North (1911-12) and White (1915),
when treating the birds of this region remarked about the fact that some
male birds possessed varying amounts of brick red on the humeral
patches. This interesting observation has been analysed by many
recent authorities and will be discussed later in this paper.
The birds from south-western Queensland, the interior of New South
Wales, the mallee areas of Victoria and eastern South Australia, after
examination of a specimen from Underbool, N.S.W., were reported by
Mathews to differ from the typical subspecies in their generally brighter
coloration and in the males having a very red abdominal patch.
Therefore, in 1917, he described Psephotus varius orientalis with the range
as given above.
Many ornithologists have discussed the individual variation found
with this species, but few have examined it as a critical analysis of the
validity of the described subspecies. North (1911) gives a full account of
the plumage variation observed in individual birds. The colour of the
upper parts and of the abdomen is quite variable in the females.
However, variation in the plumage of the males is of more value when
the above races are considered. Of two males shot together by North
at Woodside near Coonamble, N.S.W., in 1905, one had the under tail-
coverts dull yellow, the other had them washed with dull red markings.
Another specimen collected in the same locality had them washed with
green, a pattern exhibited by many immature birds. One immature
male examined by the same authority had some of the golden-yellow
feathers of the frontal and humeral patches washed with brick red,
while the red markings on the upper tail-coverts differed in pattern
from the other birds. The red in the humeral patches was also noted
by White (1915), when he observed birds in Central Australia. He
remarked that the patch on the median wing-coverts was brick red on
several male birds and the type of Ps. varius ethelae collected by him was
one of these examples.
Cain (1955) examined specimen AMNH No. 623365, which was
collected by White at the Officer River west of the Everard Ranges.
The bird had every indication of a male, which it was marked as being,
but had dull brick-red shoulder patches as in the female. They were
reported to be more extensive and definite than those shown by other
specimens, which had red markings throughout the normal yellow.
The conclusion reached was that this bird must be regarded as an
individual variation.
Peters (1937) recognized only one race of the Mulga Parrot and

Cain (1955) followed his example, but drew attention to the fact that
eastern birds, as represented by orientalis, did tend to be much richer in
their plumage colours, especially the red on the abdomen. Condon
(1941) incorporated rosinae into the typical race, and used the lack of
sufficient material as grounds for the retention of exsul and ethelae ,
although their validity was doubtful to him. At the same time he
admitted that there was much individual variation with the species,
but for some unknown reason did not take this into consideration.
Later (1962) he again dismissed rosinae and recognized orientalis , but
made no mention of the remaining subspecies.
Reports on the plumage of the races have been inconsistent and
this has not assisted in the evaluation of the recorded differences.
Mathews, when describing Ps. varius exsul , stated that the birds of
Western Australia were of a lighter blue-green colour compared to the
typical race. However, White (1921) contradicted this, recording these
birds as being slightly deeper and darker in the green coloration.
Similar treatment has been accorded to the red on the abdomen of the
males. This marking has been the distinguishing feature of the races.
The accompanying photographs show two small groups of reference
skins and close examination of these will illustrate the individual
variation present. Five specimens from New South Wales have varying
amounts of scarlet on the lower underparts, while four birds from
distantly separated localities in New South Wales, South Australia, and
Central Australia show approximately the same amount of red. It is
possible to form similar groups with any collection of skins. The con-
clusion to be drawn from these facts is that, although the eastern birds
do tend to be more brilliant than the birds of the interior and western
regions, the individual variation throughout the range reduces the
importance of this as a subspecific criterion. In the author's opinion the
arrangement suggested by Peters, that is the rejection of all races of
Psephotus varius , is correct and should be universally adopted.

A very extensive distribution is enjoyed by the Mulga Parrot, which
is found in the interior region of the southern part of the Australian
continent. This includes south-western Queensland, western New
South Wales, north-western Victoria, most of South Australia and
southern Northern Territory, and Western Australia, north to the
Onslow area. Lack of reported observations renders the northern limits
of the range in Eastern Australia uncertain.
Although found in most of the inland areas, Psephotus varius is never
observed in large numbers, a fact in marked contrast to the habits of its
nearest relative, the Red-backed Parrot. When these two birds inhabit
the same area the former frequents the drier country, while the latter is

found along the creeks and watercourses. This habitat preference, of
course, assists in the extended range of varius.
Usually encountered within the sparsely-timbered forest, Mallee, or
the stands of stunted Mulga, this exquisite parrot charms the observer
as the pairs or small parties forage on the ground for grass seeds. The
brilliance of the male's plumage stands out against what is often a
desolate setting, and makes recognition in the field very simple indeed.
However, the sombre colours of the female give her protection by
making detection more difficult. The birds are generally observed
feeding on the ground in the shade of a tree or by an outback roadside.
At the approach of danger they fly to a nearby tree and await its passing
before returning to feed. If further disturbed they generally seek
shelter and seclusion in another area.
In spite of strong undulation, the flight is surprisingly swift. The
undulation and the fact that the wings are left extended between beats

gives a fluttering effect while the bird is in the air. This distinctive
flight further aids identification as it does not resemble the flight of any
other parrot found within the range of the species. As with the other
broadtails the tail is fanned when alighting. The impressive contrast
provided by the bright green of the body and the brilliant blue of the
wing primaries is displayed to perfection when in flight.
The call of the Mulga Parrot is a soft whistle note uttered in quick
succession. It differs strongly from the call of Psephotus haematonotus .
This call is generally employed while the bird is on the wing. On rare
occasions a soft chattering is emitted while feeding.
Seeds of grasses, shrubs, and herbaceous plants form the main con-
stituent of its diet. White (1921) observed the birds feeding on the
seeds of the Mulga (. Acacia aneura) in Central Australia and Sedgewick
(1952) reported the birds eating the developed, but unripe pods, of
Acacia tetragonophylla , together with the seeds of Loranthus murrayi , a
parasitic plant on the Mulga. A detailed report on the crop and stomach
contents of a number of specimens was furnished by Lea and Gray in
1935. Two specimens from Tarcoola, South Australia, gave small seeds,
seeds of the Ruby Salt-bush ( Enchylaena tomentosa ) and Mouse-ear
Chickweed ( Cerastium glomeratum ), pieces of charcoal and small quanti-
ties of sand. Another bird from Nackara, South Australia, contained
vegetable matter and pieces of charcoal, while small seeds, pieces of
charcoal and grit were found in the crop of a specimen from Port
Vincent, South Australia. Another bird from Renmark, South
Australia, had its stomach full of small black seeds of a Caryllophyl-
laceae , and small seeds were found in the crops of specimens collected at
Renmark, Ooldea, and Mannum, South Australia, and Macdonald
Downs, Central Australia. The crop contents of the birds collected by
the author for measurements consisted of small grass seeds, seeds of
Saltbush ( Atriplex vesicarum), vegetable matter, small pieces of charcoal,
and sand. Two interesting conclusions may be made following a close
examination of these feeding records. These are the large quantities of
seeds and fruits of Acacias and other trees and shrubs that are consumed,
and the presence of pieces of charcoal in nearly all the crop samples.
It is quite apparent that this species eats large amounts of fruits and
berries from inland trees and shrubs and this is in direct contrast to the
recorded feeding habits of Ps. haematonotus. In March, 1963, the author
observed a male bird taking charcoal from a charred tree stump near
Balladonia, Western Australia. The bird slowly walked around the
stump removing small pieces of charcoal from the base.
A close look at the types of vegetation existing in the areas of distribu-
tion may assist in the appreciation of the above described feeding notes.
The wheat belt areas of southern-western Australia and the eastern
states provide abundant feed in the form of grain and grass seeds, a
plentiful supply of which is always available. The birds have been seen

feeding in small groups at wheat sidings. Approaching the arid central
regions the grass coverage becomes less dependable. The dominant
vegetation consists of small Mulga, Myall, and scattered Eucalypts and
Casuarinas. These trees are dispersed throughout the sandy plains, the
gibber-covered hills and rocky outcrops, and form small groves near
waterholes, seasonal creeks and billabongs, and inland rivers. It is in
this country that the cones of the Casuarinas and seeds of other trees and
shrubs are utilized as food. Following many observations the author
believes that the restricted movements of Ps. varius are governed by this
food supply, coupled with the availability of water. The author has
found that after rains have increased the number of waterholes and
caused the creeks to flow, the birds arrive in good numbers and remain
until the water dries up. Then they move to new areas where it is still
available. This explains the fact that Mulga Parrots are unpredictable
in the central regions, because they must always remain within
travelling distance of a reliable water supply. It appears that this species
has not developed, to the same degree as the Budgerigar ( Melop -
sittacus undulatus ), a tolerance of a lack of water.
As illustrated by the plumage descriptions, sexual dimorphism is well
developed with the species. The sexes are readily identified. The young
birds generally resemble their parents, but the males are usually much
duller and may lack the red on the abdomen and thighs. All immatures
show a marked wing-stripe, which is lost by the males and retained by
the females with the moult at the end of the first year.
The typical Platycercine mating display is performed by Ps. varius.
The male takes up his position on a branch facing the female. The
neck is stretched and the head moved up and down in a bowing-like
motion. The wings are raised in the folded position thus giving the
shoulders a squared appearance. The fanned tail is moved from side to
side in an agitated manner. The display is accompanied by a soft
chattering call.
Prospective nesting hollows are inspected by the male at the approach
of the breeding season, which extends from July to December. The
breeding in certain parts of the range is strongly influenced by climatic
conditions. The birds generally go to nest earlier in the north, where
rainfall is of the utmost importance. On selection of a suitable hollow,
the female is forced to enter and at once commences to form a depression
in the decayed wood.
The hollow chosen is usually in a broken limb or a hole in the trunk
or main branch of a tree at varying heights from the ground. If the
tree is growing by a watercourse the nesting site is often a well-formed
hollow at a considerable distance from the ground. However, most
nesting trees are small stunted specimens and this frequently dictates
the use of a small ill-formed aperture at 6 to 10 feet. This was recorded
in detail as applying to the Blue-bonnet (Psephotus haematogaster).

<bodyText confidence="0.998755977777778" page_id="56317836"  page_num="143" year="" vol="">
Four to six, usually five, pure white eggs are deposited in the shallow
excavation in the decayed wood dust lining the bottom of the hollow.
These eggs are round in form with a shell of a fine glossy texture. The
glossy surface quickly succumbs to nest staining. The average measure-
ments are o * 88 by o * 75 inches. The eggs are laid at irregular intervals
over a period of approximately six or seven days.
Incubation, which is of eighteen to twenty days duration is com-
menced after the laying of the second egg or later. The hen, only,
incubates and sits very closely often refusing to leave the nest until
lifted from the hollow. The male is very attentive to his mate and, when
not feeding the sitting bird, he roosts in the nesting tree. At the
approach of danger he flies excitedly to and from the tree calling loudly
all the while. Lack of reliable records from observations on nesting pairs
is the cause of poor knowledge of the details surrounding the feeding of
the sitting female by her mate.
The newly-hatched young are covered in white down, which
gradually gives way to pin feathers. The hen closely broods her off-
spring for the first few days, but as they progress the male assists with
their feeding. The nest is vacated about five weeks after hatching and
the young are fed regurgitated food by their parents. Upon learning to
fend for themselves they become less dependent on the adults, but the
family group generally remains intact until the next breeding season.
The Mulga Parrot has always proved to be a difficult species in
captivity. New arrivals are very delicate and generally the survival
percentage is small. Many reasons have been put forward to explain
the difficulty in acclimatizing the species, but it does appear to be
brought about by a nervous disposition and a somewhat specialized
diet. However, once the birds have settled down they are very satis-
factory cage birds, becoming quite tame and confiding. They do not
have the usual Platycercine aggressiveness and in fact are reserved by
nature.
Very careful consideration should be given to the diet provided.
A basic seed mixture of plain Canary seed, sunflower seed, millet, and
hemp in the proportions of 211:2:1 should prove satisfactory.
A plentiful supply of greenfood in the form of milk thistles, lettuce, and
chickweed must be maintained if successful breeding is to be accom-
plished. Satisfactory results may be obtained by offering small
quantities of soaked maize (corn), oatmeal or wheatmeal biscuits, and
plain cake at regular intervals. Berries and fruits of various kinds should
be offered to ascertain the birds preference, while seeding heads of
grasses will always be appreciated. Access to grit and sand is also
desirable. A very important item in the bird's diet is pieces of charcoal.
Perhaps the most satisfactory method of obtaining these is by burning
animal bones. This results in a porous charcoal.
Mated pairs are very devoted to each other and breeding in captivity

with established birds is not difficult. Intended breeding pairs should
be isolated and provided with two or more hollow logs or nest-boxes.
The species will sometimes tend to be double-brooded, but if the
aviculturist is not experienced this should be discouraged by removing
the nests after they have been vacated. It is generally more desirable to
leave the family group together for some time if the adult male will
accept this.
Hybridization with this species is not common in the wild state or in
captivity. Reliable records involving such birds as the Hooded and

(&amp;apos;Treron curvirostra)
By G. E. Whitmore (West Bromwich, England)
After several unsuccessful attempts to breed during the winters of
1962 and 1963, in a 7-ft. flight in my heated birdroom, I decided to put
the pigeons in an outside flight during the early part of April, although
the weather was quite cool at the time. The flight is 12 feet long and has
a shelter at one end, a round nest bowl half-filled with soil and topped
up with dead leaves and twigs was placed in one corner. Within a few
days an egg was laid followed in two days by another. Both the parents
helped to incubate the eggs, the cock bird in the daytime, and the hen
at night.
Their food consisted of diced fruit, i.e. apple, pear, banana, grape,
etc., also soaked currants and sultanas with insect food mixed in. On the
fourteenth day one egg hatched but two days later I found the other
egg contained a dead young one. When the squab was eleven days old,
the parents ceased brooding and the youngster passed the night
perched on the side of the nest bowl. On the twelfth day the young
pigeon, although only one-third the size of the parents, was seen perching
in the flight and the same night perched between the cock and the hen.
The youngster was seen feeding itself on the twenty-fourth day although
still being fed by the parents, and at the time of writing is one month old
and is about half the size of the hen. It is a young cock as the claret
colour can be seen growing in on the wings. The adult pair were
National Winners at Olympia in 1961.
As described, G. E. Whitmore has bred the Thick-billed Green
Pigeon, Treron curvirostra. It is believed this may be a first success. Any
member or reader knowing of a previous breeding of this species in
Great Britain or Northern Ireland is requested to communicate at once
with the Honorary Secretary.

The following breeding may be of interest to fellow aviculturists.
Twelve months (April, 1963) ago I was offered a true pair of Natal
Francolins ( Francolinus natalensis) --attractive birds with orange bills and
legs, fawn-brown backs, and black pencilled scaling on breast, sexes
are alike although males are generally larger and spurred. Size
roughly that of the English Partridge.
Although wild trapped they soon settled down and were accommo-
dated in an aviary some 20 feet square along with several pairs of ducks

and two other pairs of Francolins (Swainsons and Crested), these for-
tunately all agreed fairly well together. Six months later I discovered
that the Natal hen had laid in a small covered box I2in. by 5m. by I2in.
hung in the shelter some 12 inches from the ground. Eight eggs com-
prised the clutch and these were incubated by the female which sat very
close for twenty days. Seven chicks hatched but unfortunately these
were attacked by the Crested Francolins when coming out of the box
the following day, three only were saved and placed under a broody
bantam the same evening. She took to them and then came the problem
of suitable food. White ants (termites) were offered and eagerly eaten
by the chicks--these were given ad lib for the first week when a tin of
growers mash was added to their diet. At first they were not interested,
but when I sprinkled it with mixed bird seed they soon started picking.
This food, with the addition of chopped lettuce, obviously agreed with
them as they never looked back and started to grow rapidly.
At nine weeks one chick went blind for no apparent reason and I had
to destroy it, the other two are now (April, 1964) six months old and
fully grown. They are, of course, very tame and had their freedom in
the garden roaming around with the bantams until one month ago
when I put them in a covered aviary as I was afraid that they would be
mistaken for wild ones and shot.
I have not heard of anyone here or overseas breeding them and
wonder if this is a first record. The parent birds were presented along
with some others to Chester Zoo so am hoping they will also be successful
in breeding them.

The large walk-through aviary in the new Berlin Zoo Bird House with
its luxurious tropical vegetation has proved to be a favourable breeding-
place for different species. After the hatching of three Hill Mynas last
year (which were not reared) two Red-eared Bulbuls hatched on 26th
March, 1964, but were unfortunately killed about three weeks later by
the Kiskadees or Drongos. The Rufous-winged Kiskadees (Pitangus
sulphuratus), have just now built a globular nest and seem to be
attempting to breed.
The most spectacular breeding success was that of a young Great
Crowned Pigeon (Goura cristata ), the first one bred to the second genera-
tion. 2 /1 Great Crowned Pigeons are living in the walk-through aviary.
The female was hatched and raised in the Zoo in 1959 by a breeding
pair imported in 1957, the two cock pigeons were reared in 1961 and

1962. Having shown their peculiar courtship behaviour almost through-
out the year 1963, one pair was seen mating in January, 1964, and
taking possession of an artificial nest in a tree about 2 metres above the
ground of the aviary. The young one was seen in the nest for the first
time on March 27th, 1964. It left the nest on 26th April. Although
Crowned Pigeons have been bred in zoological gardens several times,
this is, as far as we know, the first breeding to the second generation.
The Flamingos, both European (Ph. r. antiquorum) and Chilean
(. Ph . r. chilensis) have started breeding again. Last year the first young
Flamingo in Germany was reared at the Berlin Zoo. Between 30th
April and 14th May, 1964, the European Flamingos laid seven eggs,
and the Chilean, one. Maybe some more will follow, because about a
dozen pairs are sitting on nest hills and making breeding attempts.
However, pairing was rather difficult in the pinioned birds last year,
when only one of a total of five eggs was hatched. So also this year most
of the eggs will remain undeveloped.
Among the other birds which have bred our pair of Black-necked
Swans, which has reared twenty-one young ones in four years, two
pairs of White Storks, and our pair of Snowy Owls are worth men-
tioning. Two eggs of our pair of White-naped Cranes, two Magellan
Goose eggs and one Black Vulture egg are in the incubator, together
with a great number of waterfowl and pheasant eggs.
Between March 25th and 29th, three young Great Eagle-Owls
hatched, reared by our fine breeding pair which has been in the Zoo
since 1958.

Three specimens of the Yellow-throated Sandgrouse ( Pterocles
gutturalis), a species new to the collection, have been presented by
Mr. J. O. D'eath. This species inhabits the upland plains of eastern
parts of Africa, two races being recognized. It is said to be fond of
frequenting recently burnt grassland, perhaps because it likes roasted
seeds and bulbous roots.
One King and three Gentoo Penguins which were brought from
South Georgia have been presented by the personnel of H.M.S.
Protector ; a pair of Boatbills ( Cochlearius cochlearius) by the Paignton
Zoological and Botanical Gardens and among other gifts are an
Egyptian Plover or Crocodile Bird, four African Ring-necked Parra-
keets, two Abyssinian Lovebirds, a Yellow-fronted Woodpecker
(.Melanerpes flavifrons) and a White-faced Scops Owl (Otus leucotis).
Two young Ostriches, two Black-winged Kites ( Elanus caeruleus) and
a pair of Spot-billed Toucanets have been purchased, and a Green
Wood Hoopoe (Phoeniculus purpureus) and two Dusky Miners ( Myzantha
obscura) have been received in exchange.
The Spotted Eagle-Owls that bred in mid-winter have reared a
further three chicks and Humboldt's Penguins are among the birds at
present incubating eggs.

Dr. N. P. Sholar, Mooresville, North Carolina, reports : " Our
Psittacines are doing very well. I have raised over forty-five Port
Lincoln Parrots over the last three years, and what is unique about this
is that no one else has ever raised any over here in the United States.
My Pennants have raised some twenty-five the past three years. A few

P. H. Pudney, Flinders Park, South Australia, has recently reared
a brood of four Bourke Parrakeets. Such an event is not unusual in
itself but what was unusual was the nesting site. An 18-inch length of
6 * oo tyre, with one end blocked and the other partly so, was hung in
the normal manner. The split part which normally fits the rim was
covered with tin and not being a perfect fit allowed ventilation.

W. D. Cummings reports from Keston : " We thought you would be
interested to learn that our Fairy Bluebirds hatched two young--at a
fleeting glance they looked like baby Moorhens, covered with black
down and with scarlet gapes. Things were progressing well for about
a week, as cock and hen were both feeding, and then all stopped and I
could find no sign of them ; this coincided with a particularly wet
weekend and could have had something to do with it ".

B. V. Ramanjulu, of the Indian Ornithological Garden, Dhran-
gadhra, reports two recent breeding successes. Malabar Parrakeet
Psittacula columboides. On 16th April, 1964, the nest was found to con-
tain five eggs ; three hatched on 1st, 2nd, 3rd May, and all three
young are doing well. Indian Ring-necked X Moustache Parrakeet. The
Moustache mated with a very young male Ring-necked in spite of
several good Moustache males being in the same aviary. Two eggs were
seen on 30th March, 1964. One young one was found on 13th April,
and the second hatched on the 17th. The first fell from the nest on the
24th and died from its injuries. The second is thriving.
^ ^ ^
In the Magazine , 1963, 177, we mentioned the successful breeding of
Corncrakes in the Edinburgh Zoo. Last year the success was repeated.
A male mated with two females. One laid twelve eggs but only four
hatched and the male killed the chicks as they left the nest. The second
female, one of the 1962-bred birds, laid nine eggs. To prevent further
tragedy the male and first female were removed to an adjoining aviary.
Six chicks made their appearance on 1st July ; the other three eggs
proved to be infertile. One chick was drowned in the small drinking
pond, but the five others were fully reared. An observation worthy of
note is that in the spring, 1962, both male and female were seen and
heard uttering the well-known, rasping disyllabic sound crek-crek.
There is a breeding account and some good photographs of the young

The Scottish National Zoological Park, Edinburgh, last year cele-
brated its Jubilee, 1913-1963. In honour of the event Messrs. Chr.
Salvesen and Co., Ltd., presented sixty-two Gentoo Penguins, from
South Georgia. According to the Annual Report , ig 6 g, the breeding for
the year in the penguin colony was satisfactory. " Six kings, eleven
gentoos and two macaronis were hatched, but five of the gentoo
chicks and, even more to be regretted, the two macaronis succumbed.
The remaining six gentoo chicks and all six king chicks, however, have
been successfully reared, the former already moulted into adult
plumage while the young kings will retain their brown chick down till
the following spring. It is worthy of record that two eggs were laid
during the season by one of the female kings, the first being infertile and
discarded. Previous examples of this double laying by king penguins
were recorded in 1919, 1922 (when two birds laid twice) and 1923 ".

these will be of interest to many who are aviculturists or ornithologists
rather than fanciers. The standards of the Zebra Finch Society demand
that show birds should be " Bold throughout and of the c Cobby 5
type " so the reviewer fears that, in a few more years, our Zebra Finches
may well become the same sort of monstrous travesties of their beautiful
original as are our present-day Budgerigars. The remedy suggested for
birds which show hypertrophy of nest-building behaviour and make
" egg sandwiches " is not, as one would have thought, to breed from
those that don't behave in this way but to supply so little nest material
that they are unable to.
Very full instructions on feeding and housing are given and will be of
great value to the novice. Little is said about the behaviour of the
Zebra Finch, on which so much of interest has been published of recent
years in the ornithological literature. A comparison of the author's own
observations with these would have been of considerable interest since
it appears (page 13) that in those Zebra Finches he has kept the females
have, in contrast to what others have recorded, taken the major role in
seeking nest sites and fetching building material. Whilst this book
cannot be recommended as comprehensive to those whose interests
lie in the Zebra Finch as an interesting species rather than a show
object, even they will find it a useful addition to more ornithological
works while to the budding " fancier " it will be invaluable.

THE BOOK OF CAGE BIRDS. By Charles Trevisick. Stanley
Paul and Co., London, 1964. Price i6.y.
This book covers nearly all aspects of bird keeping although the
emphasis is rather on pet birds and the showing of birds than on
breeding. The author is obviously a great enthusiast but, perhaps,
tends to communicate this enthusiasm a little too readily and to give
the impression that bird keeping is a lot simpler and less demanding
than it is ; or at any rate ought to be if the birds are to be given a fair
deal. To give one example ; the statement (page 14) " A lot of the
birds that one buys are freshly imported and for the first few weeks
appreciate a little warmth," (italics mine) would hardly indicate to the
complete beginner, who is most likely to consult such a book, that in
fact many of them will die if they don't get a lot of warmth.
The diet recommended for " all the Finch family " (page 51), in
which context it is clear that " finch " is being used (justifiably in a
book on bird keeping pure and simple) for both finches and estrildines,
does not include insects. In the chapter on doves we are told that
" Being peaceful by nature they do not damage the wire one bit ". The
latter part of this statement (only) is, of course, true, but the wire is only
too likely to damage the doves more than one bit if they fly forcibly
against it. This, as all dove keepers will know, may happen in several

Hamlyn, London, 1964. Price 15s. net.
This colourful book is certainly a worthy medium for the subject of
colourful birds. The illustrations by Pierre Probst are both attractive
in themselves and attractively arranged and the letterpress, written for
children, is by an ornithologist of international repute, Professor Jean
Dorst, Director at the National Museum of Natural History, Paris. It
is stated that this is a book for all children with enquiring minds and it
will undoubtedly stimulate their interest in, and greatly increase their
knowledge of, birdlife. The excellent and simple maps showing bird
migration and where various species occur are particularly good. In a
chapter devoted to cage-birds the author relates how the first Canaries
were brought to France and also tells how Parrakeets and Parrots were
brought to Europe. A section entitled " Do you know that..." contains an
interesting assortment of most varied information. This is certainly a
gift book all children would like to receive, and those who are no longer
children would not find it amiss.

THE BIRDS OF THE LONDON AREA. By a Committee of The
London Natural History Society. A new and revised edition. Rupert
Hart-Davis, London, 1964, price 42 s. net.
This new and revised edition of the London Natural History Society's
invaluable record of London's birds is most welcome. The first edition,
which was published in 1957, was produced by a Committee under the
chairmanship of R. C. Homes and the present edition has again been
prepared by Mr. Homes with the assistance of Stanley Cramp and
D. I. M. Wallace. The first edition covered the years 1900 up to the end
of 1954 and the original text has not been altered but a supplementary
chapter added covering the years 1955 to 1961 detailing the major
changes and giving special emphasis to Inner London and migration.
In these years twenty-five species have been recorded in the Area for
the first time this century bringing the total number up to 270. These
new records include such rarities as Purple Heron, Crane, Spoonbill,
Rose-coloured Starling, and Caspian Tern.
The loss of habitat by wading and water birds by the modernization
of sewage farms and draining of marshy ground is a depressing though

inevitable result of increasing density of population and it is disturbing
to read of the decrease in breeding species of birds of prey, the Kestrel
and Sparrow Hawk which have now become quite rare birds. The Black
Redstart which established itself as a breeding bird in the bombed sites
of Inner London which offered its favourite nesting sites has slowly
declined since new buildings have been erected. But on the other hand
new nesting species have arrived and the provision of sanctuaries in
parks, active protection given by the various authorities and the keen
interest of the general public are encouraging for the future.

Breeding Black-necked Swans
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.985001366666667" page_id="56317847"  page_num="154" year="" vol="">
As the 1963 season was so cold all but the last egg laid by my Black-necked Swans
got frozen and so only one hatched off. Thus steps were taken to protect the eggs this
year and the result was that five out of six were hatched off.
One egg was left in the nest and the other eggs were taken away as soon as possible
for safety ; but difficulty was experienced in providing the pen with dummy eggs.
Large electric bulbs were tried but they were very soon turned out of the nest.
A greengrocer, on being asked if he could supply some " oval " grapefruit, replied
" I beg your pardon, you did say oval ones sir ? " to which I answered " the 64,000
dollar question is, of course, what do I want oval grapefruit for, so I will give you
64,000 guesses ". The greengocer asked again " you did say 4 oval grapefruit ' sir ? "
When he was told that they would be used as dummy swans eggs he soon provided some
of the right shape by hand manipulation.
So as eggs were taken away, grapefruit were used as dummies. In due course of time,
the sixth egg was laid and the pen started to sit. The grapefruit were then replaced by
the proper eggs.
It might be of interest to know that even the grapefruit were not wasted, someone
found them in the greenhouse and ate them, expressing the view that they were the
tenderest, ripest grapefruit they had ever had in their life. They were somewhat shocked
when they were informed that they ought to be, as a swan had sat on them for a
fortnight.
The only tragedy this year was that one of the cygnets fell out of the nest and could
not get back before it died of cold. It is suggested that just before the eggs hatch out,
the nest should be lowered to prevent this happening ; the four cygnets are thriving on
duck weed and turkey crumbs.
One other event of interest has happened to the Australian Shellducks. The female
sat on eleven eggs until they chipped, then eleven ducklings hatched under a bantam
and all have survived. It would be interesting to know if this is a record.

" SUKIE ", BABY AFRICAN GREY PARROT
By Mrs. Eve Wicks (St. Leonards-on-Sea, Sussex, England)

<bodyText confidence="0.994426566666667" page_id="56317858"  page_num="" year="" vol="">
This bird was hand-reared by me from the age of seventeen days, and
members may like particulars of the notes I kept.
The parents " Johnny and Jackie ", produced three babies, but were
themselves too young to cope with the responsibility of rearing a
family to maturity.
The first chick died when three weeks old and the second one died
four days later, also three weeks old.
23rd September , ig6j. 17 days old. Weight 4 J oz .
The third chick looked very feeble and would obviously have joined
the others, so I took it indoors and presumed that if it got through the
critical three-week period it stood a chance of survival.
It was so weak and half-starved that the first day I had difficulty in
getting it to take a few drops of mixture every hour. I fed it with a
spoon turned slightly sideways, as would be the mother's beak.
With the resilience of youth, however, it was taking a teaspoonful of
mixture every two hours by the next day. Its last feed was 11 p.m. and
it would not take any food during the night.
The mixture was Bengers and arrowroot, made to the consistency of
thin cream, with hot milk. The arrowroot was given because the
droppings were so liquid. After a week I substituted Farex for the
arrowroot.
" Sukie " was housed in a box 14 inches square, turned on its side,
to keep the chick dark and protect his tender eyes, only just cracking
open.
The mother had denuded him of down and he was quite naked, so it
was essential to keep him warm.
Peat was in the bottom of the box, covered with a woolly, and a
woolly covered the hot-water bottle, to keep back direct heat. The
chick was covered by another light woolly and snuggled up to the bottle.
From a tender age he could throw off the woolly or wriggle under it

break through, much like a baby's gums when teething, and he needed
very gentle handling.

Primaries breaking through.
13th October. 34 days old.
Has commenced preening and will not be covered up during the day-
time. Scratching peat vigorously.
16th October , 1363. 36 days old. ii\ oz.
Taking six teaspoonsful of mixture at each meal : 8 a.m., 11 a.m.,
4 p.m., 8 p.m., 11 p.m. The long break between 11 a.m. and 4 p.m.
would presumably be when the parents rested.
" Sukie " always dictated his own meal times and lengthened the time
between meals when ready to do so, by refusing a meal at the already
agreed time, but accepting it half an hour or so later.
21st October , 1363. 41 days old. Weight , 13 oz.
Red tail just breaking through. Will now eat up to fourteen sun-
flower seeds, slightly crushed after shelling, after each meal.
" Sukie " is now vigorously scratching the peat first to one side to a
height of 10 inches, and then back again. While doing this he suddenly
pounces on any sunflower seed kernels that may have been dropped.
He can see quite well in the dark.
Presumably this scratching of the bedding would be for two reasons.

teaches him to pick up for himself.
23th October , 1363. 43 days old. Weight 14 oz.
Food is now made to the consistency of thick cream, but " Sukie " is
getting tired of baby food. Have tried him with scrambled egg
and also porridge, but after a few meals this also was rejected.
The slow process of shelling quantities of sunflower seeds has now
commenced.
2nd November , 1363. 33 days old. Weight 13 oz.
Now enjoys a lamb chop bone, with a little lean meat, no fat ; and
I also cracked sunflower seeds and let him extract the kernel himself.
This he enjoyed so much that it was a job to get him to take the shelled
seeds and as he was so slow in getting out the kernel, it was quite a
problem to see that he consumed sufficient. I also gave him a little
Madeira cake and a grape.

EVE WICKS 44 SUKIE," BABY AFRICAN GREY PARROT 1 57
He can now use his beak for balancing himself and is chewing apple
twigs. He perches during the day, but still likes to be tucked up at night.
3th November, 1363. 56 days old. Weight 15 oz-
He never reached this weight again, so presumably it was 44 puppy-
fat ". Meals are a problem, refuses all soft food.
12th November, 1363. 63 days old. Weight 13 oz-
Loss of weight due to 44 Sukie's 55 independence. Can now crack his
own sunflower seeds, and is so very slow, but insists on doing the job
himself. I still persevere with offering shelled seeds in between the
process of shelling his own.
He is now feathering nicely and his red tail is 2J in. long.
23th November, 1363. y6 days old. Weight 13 oz-
I have three other parrots in the room, so 44 Sukie " has not become
too humanized. These birds (an African Grey cock, an Amazon cock
and an Amazon hen) are all free and 44 Sukie " now likes to go into an
empty cage and copy the other birds.
3rd December, 1363. 84 days old. Weight 13 oz .
Flying well, but cannot land properly or change direction.
10th December, 1363. 31 days old. Weight 13 oz .
Can now control flight and back-pedal to land. Practised this a lot
and seemed to enjoy it.
24th December, 1363. 13 weeks. Weight 13 oz-
Eyes starting to pearl and 44 Sukie " getting aggressive with the other
birds. Realizes that I rescue him when he is in a fix. Decided to let him
stand on his own feet and did not rescue him when he was showing off.
This checked his aggression, but he will still tweak the tail of any bird
near to him and fly back to my head (his favourite perch) for safety.
31st December, 1363. 16 weeks. Weight 13 oz .
44 Sukie 5 5 is completely fearless of anything and anybody. When a
friend came in with her dog, he perched on its head, although he had
never seen a dog before. He has since done this with another dog, but
fortunately both dogs were used to birds, so they took no notice of him.
After feeding the chick I always wiped his beak with a tissue and now
every time he sees a handkerchief he wants his beak wiped.
44 Sukie " is now six months old and weighs 14 oz. He is in perfect
feather and the only thing that distinguishes him from an adult is the
brown tips to his red tail-feathers.
For the last two months he has been very playful and, at the same
time, occasionally quite spiteful. He nipped quite sharply, and
obviously intended to hurt.
This is, perhaps, nature's way of making the parent birds wean off
their young and make them fend for themselves. He is now getting
very affectionate, and only nips on rare occasions.

By Mrs. K. M. Sgamell (Newdigate, Surrey)
The Malachite Sunbird is perhaps one of the best known and, once
acclimatized, the hardiest of the East and South-East African Sunbirds
which are kept in aviaries and cages in this country. Much has been
written about this species in this and other avicultural magazines so
I will describe only briefly one of the most brilliant of the sunbirds.
The general distribution of this sunbird extends from Eritrea to the
Transvaal. There are two races of the species, the more brilliant in
colour and larger in size, I believe, coming from the South. It is a bird
of the hills and mountains and according to some writers, is usually
found at levels above 5,000 feet and on Mt. Kenya and elsewhere at
altitudes up to 14,000 feet. It feeds on the nectar found in aloes and
other tubular flowers and is highly insectivorous. One of the largest
of sunbirds, the cock is very handsome in breeding plumage which in
this country we have found to be fleeting and incomplete. In colour
it is in general a metallic green with a golden wash. The flight feathers
and tail are blackish--the central tail feathers elongated. Underneath,
the metallic feathering is bluish. The female is drab in colour,
brownish above with a blackish white-tipped tail, the outer feathers of
which are also edged with white which helps to distinguish this species
from other hen sunbirds. Below, the hen is a mottled yellow. Out of
colour the cock retains its tail until it is moulted, but the dark flight
feathers still remain, together with some metallic feathering. At such
times he is also a drab specimen.
We obtained our pair about two years ago from acquaintances in
Southampton. The birds had been imported direct from South-East
Africa and were placed in an aviary with a pair of Paradise Flycatchers
and a pair of Diamond Doves. The aviary shelter has heat in the
winter (minimum normally about 40* F. though it has been lower
many times). Last summer the sunbirds showed no inclination to
breed. They are both very tame, as are most Malachites, and until
this spring were not pugnacious to the other inmates. Nor were they
aggressive to each other which is most unusual with Malachites and
many other sunbirds. However, in April, 1964, they were in magnifi-
cent condition--fitter than I have ever seen Malachites before. The
mild winter and daily access to the outside flight with plenty of midges
to hawk perhaps made all the difference.
Whilst I was on holiday in early May, my husband noticed the cock
Malachite chasing the Paradise Flycatchers, which are larger birds in
every way. Those who have kept Malachites will know that when these
sunbirds are really fit they will attack most birds. He caught the

Malachites up and transferred them to a small planted flight measuring
6 ft. 3 in. by 3 ft. 3 in. by 6 ft. 3 in. high which led into a 6 by 6 by 7 ft.
high cedar shelter itself divided into four small sections each opening
into similar flights. In the first flight is a mature bamboo which I
transplanted last year. We had this aviary in reserve for the first pair
of sunbirds which came into full breeding condition and these
happened to be the Malachites. Into the shelter we placed a supply of
feathers, fine grasses and kapok. Almost immediately the hen sunbird
started carrying the grass and in a day or two had made a start
towards building a bulky nest in the bamboo. On 14th May, on a
fine sunny morning, the nest was beginning to take some shape from
all the materials supplied with masses of kapok exposed to whatever
weather was to follow the fine spell. My husband thought it a good
idea to construct a clear plastic roof over the nest and fastened the
polyglaze to the roof of the flight. There was great excitement beneath
with both birds flying wildly about and all nest building ceased. The hen
certainly didn't like the covering which she pecked at so it had to be
removed. It seemed that the first shower would swamp the flimsy
and almost unprotected nest but as events proved later, the hen knew
better. I returned from holiday on 17th May, and as the nest was
making little progress, decided to add teased packing string cut in
6 inch and 9 inch lengths, to the other material. The string was readily
used by the hen in large amounts to anchor the purse-like affair to the
various stems of the growing bamboo. There was very heavy rain on
the 19th but nest building continued slowly until about 4th June by
which time we had supplied handfuls of kapok which would be used
up within a day or so. The hen seemed to be sitting closely on 6th June
with her head poking out of a hole on the topside of the domed
structure which was at last completed. All this time the cock had
supervised the work in which he took a deep interest but no part. He
frequently chased the hen when she slackened her building efforts and
his display with head thrown back and wings extended and with the
tail moved from side to side was repeated at intervals throughout the
days.
On 7th June the hen was off the nest for a moment and I was able
to see an egg quite clearly through the entrance hole, it may have
been there a few days earlier. The egg was quite large, very dark
brown at one end and tapering down through a pale grey/green to
an off-white at the pointed end. She sat with her head poking out
and completely indifferent to either of us or the occasional camera,
day after day, the cock remaining on his perch at the other end of the
flight. On the morning of the 15th at 7.45 a.m. she was off the nest
for a few minutes and I had a quick look at the nest expecting to see
a second egg, but there was still only one. About 5 p.m. the same day
I observed the hen feeding a chick which was clearly seen. I saw it

later about 7 p.m. as the hen was not brooding continuously. We
placed ajar of broad bean tops loaded with black-fly in the flight and
in the shelter a biscuit tin containing over-ripe fruit and banana skins
which were well inoculated with fruit flies. I don't think the black
fly were touched. On the 16th I searched the roses for greenfly but
without success. The weather was very cool. Around the garden and
in the wooded area surrounding it, I collected some aphis from
" cuckoo-spittle " which is found on long stems of grass, among the
bracken, on blackberry bushes, on honey-suckle, and on the underside
of hazel nut leaves, etc. It was a long slow job but at such an early
age in the development of the chick, I was able to keep up with the
demand ! On the 17th I continued collecting the aphis and a friend
brought in a further supply of fruit flies, etc., which I added to the
stock in the shelter.
The next day was very wet and cold, about an inch of rain fell, so I
set the thermostat controlling the heater tube in the shelter to 75 0 F.
and shut the door. I followed the same collecting programme on the
19th which was again wet and cold. On Saturday the 20th, I had a
look inside the nest. The chick was surprisingly large, had a short
whitish beak, body dark, and almost naked. We both worked hard all
day until dark collecting the large aphis but we had now given up any
pretence of removing them from the " spittle " which anyway tended
to disappear in about 20 minutes which was the time it took to collect
about two dozen. On arriving at the shelter with the collecting dish
the hen would come charging through the pop-hole from the flight on
to a perch and stand waiting for the shelter door to open and the dish
to be placed on a shelf! It would help itself to about a dozen of the
aphis, picking them from the remains of the " spittle " so that its beak
would be partly open with a row of the insects from root to tip of the
bill. It would then fly to the nest, cling on, and deliver the row of
aphis into the throat of the gaping chick, a matter of 2 or 3 seconds,
say 30 seconds in all. After a few minutes the remaining twelve to
fourteen aphis would be fed to the youngster in like manner. The
results of 20 minutes work would have disappeared and I can only
assume she made do with fruit flies until I returned. My diary records
that on the Sunday, 21st June, we had a busy day from 7 a.m. to
9 p.m. trying to keep up supplies. The weather was still cool and we
had several other birds with young, such as both pairs of Spreos,
Shamas, and a pair of Shelley's Starlings so there was plenty to do
one way and another. On the 22nd and 23rd, still in coolish weather,
we continued as before but the heated shelter was now taking effect on
the fruit fly cultures and substantial numbers were being produced
which helped with the feeding. On 29th June the cock was observed
feeding with one aphis at a time ! The next day our garden seemed
to be clear of aphis so I placed a small piece of raw meat in the shelter

and opened the door. This quickly attracted some flies so I shut the
door. The flies then made for the closed window which was protected
with 1 inch netting and the hen Malachite stood on the netting and
picked them off the window ! It was quite simple and I repeated the
procedure frequently throughout the day. It was certainly a change
from the arduous job of collecting aphis ! In the cool of the evening
it meant collecting more aphis which had now begun to re-appear,
but it eased the work.
On the morning of the 27th the young Malachite seemed to be
weak and listless but the day was hot and both parents fed flies and
aphis. At about 9.30 p.m. two pots containing about sixty aphis were
left in the shelter but somehow it did not seem that the supply of live
food was going to be enough. The hen was not feeding or brooding
and seemed to be more interested in the cock which was still in perfect
breeding condition. From past experience with other breeding birds
I realized that the parents were losing interest in the chick and were
likely to start another family. They were too fit, the food supply
came too easily. I netted the cock and placed it in a cage in my
hummingbird aviary which is out of sight and probably out of earshot
of the hen. At 7 a.m. next morning I shut the hen in the shelter and
examined the young bird in its nest in the flight. It was in a bad
way--the beak was stuffed with teased out string. I removed the
chick from the nest and took it indoors. We then cut off some of the
string with scissors and slowly pulled up what seemed to be endless
strands at the end of one of which was a fly ! The bird had every
appearance of being unfed for some hours and this was now under-
standable. I next returned the bird to its nest, released the hen from
the shelter and also returned the cock to the aviary. Both parents
ignored the chick ! At this point I almost gave up but after breakfast
I decided to hand-feed the bird with the usual plunger type feeder,
something I have never been very successful at. I always respect
those people who take hand feeding in their stride ! However at this
moment I saw the hen clinging to the nest feeding once again so I
left well alone !
During the next few fine days all was well, the hen feeding regularly
with beakfuls of live food and the cock making a lot of fuss about the
odd contribution he made to the feeding. The hen only removed the
sac containing the droppings. I had to enter the flight a few times to
cut away some of the strands of twine which were coming loose from
the nest which was now beginning to show signs of wear and tear.
On Wednesday, 1st July, the young bird left the nest at about
10 a.m., the sixteenth day after it hatched. I returned it to its nest but it
was out again at 3 p.m. and returned voluntarily at about 8 p.m. A most
unusual occurrence for a softbill if one can call a sunbird such. It
looked very much like the hen--the beak had grown quite a lot and

was about half the size of an adult's beak and similar in colour. The
bird itself was about three-quarters the size of the hen and similarly
marked but a shade darker in colour. Both parents fed the bird
throughout the day and it flew fairly well but without much direction.
The next morning the chick did not leave the nest until about io a.m.
and was out all day looking tight and sleek. It returned to the nest
about 8 p.m. As the parents were competing with each other in the
feeding, often breaking up a fly in the process and moreover knocking
the chick about in their efforts to be the first to feed, I caught up the
cock once more and removed him to other quarters as before. Peace
was restored.
The next day, 3rd July, a heavy thunderstorm broke about 3 p.m.
but the youngster had already returned to the nest before the light
had become really bad. At 8 a.m. on the 4th I saw the young
Malachite drinking nectar for the first time and during the day it
drank frequently. It returned to the nest on and off all day and the
hen was brooding it at 8 p.m., the pair of them completely
filling the nest cavity. The young bird was now as large as its mother
but its beak was about two-thirds adult size. On 5th July the young
bird had found its way to the shelter. The night had been very cool
and so had some of the day and the young bird was in and out of the
nest drinking nectar very frequently. On the 7th it was seen to catch
small flying insects itself though it gaped to be fed. The night of the
7th-8th was very rough, with rain and high winds. The hen was very
soft and had obviously been sleeping in the flight. The young bird was
very tight and had probably slept in the shelter or nest. I shut them
both in the shelter and later on the hen had recovered. Between the
9th and 19th July the weather was very sunny and hot and I was now
satisfied the young bird was feeding itself so I removed the hen from
the flight and placed it with the cock in their original aviary with
Paradise Flycatchers and Diamond Doves. Both parents were in a
moult and the cock was now in his winter plumage. At the time of
writing, 20th August, the young bird is now fully grown, has moulted
a few feathers about the head. About a week ago I introduced a hen
Violet-backed Sunbird to the aviary. This bird had been freshly
imported and from past experience I had found the species rather
vicious. However, they seem to agree. The immature Malachite is
really like an adult hen except for the darker upper plumage and
there will be uncertainty in regard to its sex until it really moults out.
As described, Mrs. K. M. Scamell has bred the Malachite Sunbird
JVectarinia famosa. It is believed that this may be a first success.
Any member or reader knowing of a previous breeding of this species
in Great Britain or Northern Ireland is requested to communicate at
once with the Hon. Secretary.

The Hoopoe is one of the birds that has been mentioned and illus-
trated for hundreds of years, its image being depicted in ancient Greek
and Egyptian mural paintings, and it is referred to in the Bible as the
Lapwing. Legends have been built around this bird, one being that,
after King Solomon had been shaded by the wings of a flock of Hoopoes
from the glaring noonday sun, he rewarded the birds with crowns of
gold. People coveted these, and an incessant persecution of the Hoopoe
was maintained to secure it. Tired and weary of this continual oppres-
sion, the birds asked the King to take the crown back. This he did,
replacing it with a beautiful fan-shaped crest. A further legend, of
European origin, affirms that the Hoopoe was the form assumed by
Jereus, King of Crete, as an atonement for his past sins. The fame of
the bird, however, was not confined to legend, for many references in
literature have been made to its use in magical and medicinal pre-
scriptions. These were mainly for afflictions of the sight or memory, and
use of different parts of the bird's anatomy were recommended by
various scribes from the early Egyptian days down to the Pharmacopoeia
Universalis by Dr. R. James (1752).
The nominate race, Upopa e. epops , has an extensive range, wintering
in the Mediterranean countries and Asia Minor, passing its breeding
season throughout Central Europe, including the south of England.
There are at least four other races ranging through Asia, these including
U. e. orientalis of northern India ; U. e. longirostris of Burma and
neighbouring areas ; U. e. ceylonensis of southern India and Ceylon, and
U. e. saturata of Mongolia. The differences in the races consist of
variations in the markings, size of crest, and length of bill. There are
also two other members of the family of Upupidae in Africa, Upopa
africans of East Africa and U. senegalensis of West Africa.
The species with which I am concerned here is U. e. longirostris ,
pairs of which were received at various times by Mr. Boehm from
Burma and Thailand. The sexes are very similar, the main colouring
consisting of black, white, and pinkish-brown. They are about 12
inches in total length, 2J inches of which may be accounted for by the
thin, slightly decurved bill. The head and the fan-shaped crest are
pinkish-brown, the crest feathers increasing in length from front to rear
and being broadly tipped with black. The back and sides of the neck,
and the shoulders, are a dull ashy-fawn, the remainder of the back
being banded broadly in black and fawny-white, these bands extending
across the wing-coverts. The quills of the wings and tail are black, the
primaries having a white band across their tips, the secondaries with
three or four white bands evenly spaced throughout their length. The

black tail has a single chevron-shaped white bar across the centre. The
chin is whitish with the throat and upper-breast being pale pinkish-
fawn. The remainder of the underparts is white, extensively streaked
with black and ashy-grey except for the under tail-coverts which are
clear white. The bill is horny black, lighter at the base of the lower
mandible ; the legs and feet are slate-grey, and the iris is reddish-
brown. They have an extremely short tongue, taking all their food,
mainly insects, by probing with their long bill, grasping it, and flicking
it back into their mouth. The wings are rounded and their flight is slow
and undulating, rather butterfly-like. The main visual difference in
the sexes lies in the length of the bill and the size of the crest, those of
the female being slightly smaller in both cases. Whether it is a definite
sex indicator or not I would not like to say, but I have noticed that,
with the pairs in the Boehm aviaries, the males appear to have nine
pairs of black tipped feathers in their crest, whereas the females have
but seven pairs. Any comments on this would be welcomed.
The crest lies back over the head but is raised whenever they become
excited, and also when they are feeding. It is a pleasing sight seeing
them walking on a lawn, they are very sociable and confiding birds,
probing in the grass, each probe being accompanied with an elevation
of that fascinating crest. They have a soft, mellow call note, a repeated
" hoop-hoop ", from which their common name undoubtedly derived.
Although it sounds very pleasant when one is observing them, I can
assure you that it can become very irritating when there is a flock
of them on your lawn during the heat of the afternoon, when you are
trying to take a few moments of sleep, as I experienced during my
years on the plains in India.
There had been attempts by Hoopoes at breeding in the Edward
Marshall Boehm aviaries from i960 onwards, with the exception of
1962, which was not a particularly good breeding year for anything.
Both in i960 and 1961 a pair did produce eggs, but in each instance
the female died after having laid three eggs. As the same male was
concerned each time, he was given a rest and a new pair, the male
coming from eastern India in December, 1961, and the female from
Thailand in June, 1962, were released into the Tropical aviary during
July, 1962. This is a large aviary, planted, as its name implies, with
palms, banana and olive trees, tropical cacti, ferns, and flowering plants
and has a stream, fed by a waterfall, running in an irregular course
around the inner limits. Due to the type of vegetation, a minimum
temperature of 60 degrees is maintained throughout the year. Many
other birds shared this with the Hoopoes, such as Blacksmith Plovers,

A 12 inch thick, 10 feet high tree stump, with a fairly large hole in
it at about 8 feet up, had been positioned in the aviary for use of such
birds as the Trogons or Hoopoes, if they should decide to go to nest.
It was in May, 1963, that the female Hoopoe was seen going in and
out of this nest hole, which incidentally, led to a hollow about 9 inches
in depth and 8 inches in diameter. During the period 18th to 22nd
May, four eggs were laid but they all proved to be clear. They were
pale blue, completely unmarked, and measured, on the average, 25 by
16 mm. In June she started again, this time laying five eggs by the 19th.
Again, four were clear but the other did hatch on 3rd July.
Except for the fact that a tiny live object could just be discerned at
the base of the nest hole with the aid of an electric hand-torch, little
more information can be given as to whether there was any nestling
down or not. However, by the time the chick was nine days old it
could be seen that it was feathering up in greyish-fawn and that it did
have a dark, thick bill, about S inch in length, the gape being margined
in white. By another seven days the feathering closely resembled that
of the adults, even to the black-tipped crest, and the bill had taken on
the long, thin, curved shape of the older birds, but it was much shorter,
not more than an inch in length. At this time the parent birds spent
most of the daylight hours out of the nest, paying it regular visits to
feed the nestling. Although it vacated the nest for a brief period on
25th July, it was not until the following day that it finally fledged.
A complete replica in general form of its parents, except that the colour
tones were softer, the crest not so full, neither was the bill as long. It
finally attained independence on 3rd August, and has since shown
itself to be a male.
During the incubation period and early brooding days, seemingly
carried out by the female only, the male was most conscientious in his
attendances upon her. Their diet was comprised entirely of live-food in
the form of mealworms, crickets, moths and other insects and grubs
foraged in the aviary, plus ground raw beef. The male seemed to make
a habit of taking four feeding trips to the nest, then something for
himself, then back to the nest again, repeating this series of operations
about three times each hour. Whenever the female seemed to feel he was
overdue with the rations she would poke her head out of the hole
and make a plaintive " hoop-hoop He would promptly reply and,
in a matter of seconds, would be there with something for her to eat
or feed to the nestling as the case might be.
Contrary to my expectations, having scented Hoopoe nests at 200 to
300 yards distant in India, there was a negligible smell connected with
this nest. This may have been due to there being but one chick, as
compared to the normal three or four in the wild, or maybe they had
become civilized in their lush surroundings and did carry out a certain
amount of nest sanitation. It is owing to their habit of never cleaning

the nest of the excreta of their offspring that they are regarded as
unclean by the natives of India, and are left entirely unmolested.
Although I have no particular desire to have the unpleasant odour
permeating through the beautiful aviaries, laid out in such a natural
style by Mr. Boehm, I do hope that another season may produce a
nest full of young Hoopoes.

By B. E. Reed (Wednesbury, Staffs., England)
This article is of an interesting experience we had early this year with
Scarlet-Chested Sunbirds (Chalcomitra senegalensis gutturalis) in our
birdroom. I should perhaps explain at this point that " we " includes
my partner Mr. A. Holmes.
Our birds are housed in what almost amounts to a semi-greenhouse
approx. 16 feet long by 8 feet wide by 6 ft. 6 in. to the eaves and
7 ft. 6 in. to the apex. The birds are kept in pairs in small indoor flights
or large cages. We have only experienced serious fighting with the
Scarlet-Chested Sunbirds and I think you will agree that we speak
from experience, having kept fifteen or sixteen different species of
sunbirds. The room is thermostatically controlled at 6o* F. min. (This
was raised to 70* when the sunbirds had laid in order to increase our
supply of fruit flies.)
The birds are fed on a Nectar Recipe as used by the late Cecil Webb
and is made up as follows :-- to the making of 1 pint, 6 teaspoons of
Baby Food, 2 teaspoons Condensed Milk, J teaspoon Haliborange,
4 teaspoons Glucose, and 2 teaspoons Honey. This is changed about
2.30 p.m. and is substituted by a mixture of 1 dessertspoon of
" Stimulite " and 1 dessertspoon of honey to 1 pint of water. (These
mixtures are only approximate and are varied daily as they must get
differences in the wild state.) The main source of live food given to our
sunbirds throughout the year are fruit flies and occasional spiders.
Slices of sweet fruit are occasionally given to those sunbirds that will
eat them.
The Scarlet-Chested Sunbirds were imported by us from Portuguese
East Africa in March, 1962. We have tried to pair them up many times
but serious fighting always broke out after a couple of days. On
8th February, 1964, these two birds were placed in a flight indoors

approx. 2 ft. g in. square by 6 feet high. They immediately began
fighting and the cock was removed.
It was noticed soon after that the hen was bickering with a pair of
Kirk's Black Sunbirds in the next compartment. So a large piece of
cardboard was fastened up to prevent this. An artificial nest of grass,
which was put up in the flight with the hen, was immediately destroyed
by her. The cock was introduced to her again on the 23rd March, 1964,
and apart from a bit of squabbling all was quiet. Within a couple of
days she was seen to be attempting to get through the wire netting into
a seedeater flight. We guessed that she wanted to get to one of the nest-
boxes and one was given to her. She began building almost immediately
and the materials used were canary nesting material, bits of grass and
moss. (Cobwebs were refused.) It was lined with scraps of paper off
the floor. The nest was very deep and had a porch over the entrance.
The nest-box was an old cardboard nut and bolt box with the corner
ripped out. The nest was completed on the 10th April, an interesting
point being that she would only build when the sun was shining.
The display consists of the cock flicking his tail from side to side
while singing continuously. He also holds the wing which is furthest
away from the hen in a curious position (dropped, with the shoulder of
the wing held out and the wing itself curved almost into an arc.) The
hen will then open and shut her wings continuously and raise her tail
(this is vibrated rapidly up and down). Mating then takes place.
When about to lay it was noticed that she caught more insects than
usual, possibly in order to form the egg shells. She was seen to be sitting
on the 21 st April and one egg was seen in the nest on the 26th April.
It was cream, heavily blotched, and streaked with greyish-brown,
especially towards the larger end. It was quite pointed and was about
18-5 to 19 mm. long by 13*5 mm. wide. (Two infertile eggs laid since
confirm this.)
The youngster is believed to have hatched on the 6th May as the hen
was noticed catching large amounts of fruit flies. On the 8th May, the
hen was seen hanging on the front of the box feeding her offspring. It
was covered in white down and the inside of the mouth was white.
It also had an extremely wide gape. About this time the hen was seen
searching the cracks in the flight for spiders, and it must be stated that
the feeding was carried out almost entirely on these, the hen taking
approximately sixty to one hundred spiders per day. The youngster
was fed at first by regurgitation but in the later stages the spiders were
killed and fed whole. On 14th May the inside of the youngster's mouth
was seen to be changing to yellow. It had also begun to feather up.
The droppings were removed from the nest three or four times per day.
On the 16th May the cock sunbird was removed from the flight as
the birds were seen attempting to mate again.
On the 17th May the hen was seen to be in a distressed condition.

(We think now that she had not been taking any food herself but had
been feeding it all to the youngster.) She was, therefore, placed in a
hospital cage for five hours and she recovered. During this time we
hand-fed the young bird with freshly killed spiders and fruit flies. About
g p.m. on that evening she was trying to get out of the hospital cage and
upon being released into the flight she went into the nest and sat on the
young bird.
The young bird left the nest on 26th May at approximately 5 p.m.
As its flight feathers were not developed it was returned. It promptly
left again. This was done three times and eventually it was left out.
It was progressing well and its flight feathers were opening slowly when
it suddenly refused to feed on the 31st May, although the hen kept
trying to feed it. It died early on the morning of the 1st June. We think
that it is possible that it died of shock as we had two very bad thunder-
storms at night on the 29th and 30th May.
We think that the slow development of its flight feathers may have
been due to our inability to provide enough live food in the first few
days of its life.
We have found that any hen sunbirds in breeding condition will show
this by filling the nectar bottles with any scraps of paper, straw, etc.
they can find. The building, feeding, and incubation, was carried out
entirely by the hen.
At the time of writing (6th June) the hen is pulling the nest to pieces
and we shall introduce the cock to her again in another week.
In conclusion we should like to thank all the people who helped us
by collecting spiders, especially Mr. Alan Lavender who, although a
Non-Fancier, collected in the region of three to four dozen per day.

To judge the pheasants at the Easter Show in Sydney at the invitation
of the Royal Agricultural Society of New South Wales, I travelled
1,000 miles (there and back) by car ; left it parked with 50,000 other
cars outside the vast show grounds ; mingled, and was nearly mangled,
among 300,000 Good Friday visitors ; and left a bit of my heart with
Sydney, one of the world's most fascinating cities.
In Australia we have fifteen different species of pheasants kept in
aviaries, with no prospect of increasing the number of species, because
of the ban on importations of all birds and eggs, for fear of Newcastle
disease introduced to poultry. Having regard to the lack of any new
pheasant " blood " since 1932, we seem to have kept what we have got
in pretty good shape and condition, without noticeable signs of in-
breeding.

Only on King Island, a small part of Tasmania in Bass Strait, an
hour's flight from the Melbourne airport, are pheasants available as
game birds. This is due to the happy circumstance of no foxes being
introduced to the island. These pheasants are all wild-bred, and are
hunted with dogs for shooters who fly from as far away as Brisbane
(1,600 miles) for the fortnightly open season in June. About 2,000 cock
Ringnecks are shot in that season ; no hens.
At the Sydney Royal Show, forty-three pairs of pheasants were
exhibited. The only available species not shown were the very high-
priced rareties, the Siamese Firebacks, Edwards, and Cheers. A few
pairs of each of these survive, but they are increasingly difficult to rear,
probably owing to in-breeding. As their prices range around #50
a pair, they appear too valuable to risk showing.
None of the birds shown was in perfect condition, owing to the very
late moult coinciding with a very early Easter. Only six days later than
its earliest possible date, Easter Sunday fell on March 28 ; had the full
moon reached its fullness 11 hours 11 minutes later than it did, Easter
Sunday would have fallen on April 5 ; and that extra week would have
perfected the plumage of most of the birds shown !
Lady Amherst's were resplendent, as usual. The Australian standard
is very high, owing to careful breeding from English Amhersts imported
from Huddersfield, Yorkshire, about 1925. The champion Amherst
cock shown by the religious order of the House of David in Sydney
was practically perfect : snowy breast and flanks, blue face, correct
crest, splendid ruff, and long clearly-etched tail. Also, the best Goldens
were beyond reproach. We are lucky in Australia in having very few
Golds with Amherst blood (and luckier still vice versa). By careful
feeding on a diet rich in vitamins and minerals the show Goldens were
both iridescent and wonderfully rich in colouring.
" Best bird in the show " was adjudged to be a Silver cock. It won
by a very narrow margin from the Golden and Amherst champions,
mainly on its condition ; but also because of its exquisite markings,
rivalling the delicacy of the old Chinese embroideries. This is rare in
Silvers.
Reeves's were represented by only one pair, far from perfect, in the
moult. They gave promise of much better colour and size in maturity.
Swinhoe's were excellent types of high quality but mutants lacked the
solid blackness and iridescence necessary for top ranking.
A pretty problem gave the judge a headache in the " any other
variety " class, where five pairs of Goldens were shown, each cock
having exactly the same yellow bar across the upper breast (though
otherwise 24-carat). They could have been condemned as mongrels ;
disqualified as out of their proper class among Goldens, where they
would have been disqualified anyhow ; or hailed as very interesting
examples of xanthism, or yellowness in the mutation range that

includes albinism (whiteness), melanism (blackness), or erythrinism
(redness).
The judge ruled in favour of xanthism in the firm belief that, properly
developed, this mutation might lead to the yellow-breasted Gold bred
by Professor A. Ghigi in Italy. His belief was not confirmed by a letter
written to the Ornamental Pheasant Society of Australia (Mr. E. A.
Eldridge) by M. Jean Delacour who insisted that our yellow-barred
Goldens were showing the taint of Amherst blood.
The judge at the Sydney Royal asks pardon from M. Delacour for
entire disagreement with him. The honourable and venerable President
of the Avicultural Society of America ruled without knowledge of our
birds' breeding.

BREEDING THE JOYFUL GREENBUL
By Charles Everitt (Trenton, N.J., U.S.A.)
A member of the Bulbul family, the Joyful Greenbul --Chlorocichla
1 . latissima --comes from Africa, where it may be found in a com-

paratively restricted area ranging from north-eastern Congo, through
the Sudan, to Kenya. It has a most melodious song but also possesses a
harsh, staccato alarm note, which it is subject to give vent to at the
slightest provocation. About 10 inches in total length, the sexes are so
similar in appearance that, to sex an individual bird, presents quite a
task. The upper plumage is golden-green, the head feathers being dark
centred, giving it a scaly effect. The underparts are golden-yellow,
more intense at the throat, forming a distinct patch. The only difference
we have noticed in the sexes is that the throat patch is less extensive in
the female, and the underparts in general are not as bright as those of
the male. These observations have been made on one pair only, so they
may not be at all conclusive.
There is a subspecies, Chlorocichla l. schoutedeni, which is found from
the eastern Congo to south-west Tanganyika. It is slightly larger than
the nominate race and is a brighter green, the underparts also being
green with a yellowish wash.
A pair of the former species was received by Mr. Boehm in August,
1961, from the well known collector the late Cecil Webb. After a period
in one of the pens in the main bird-house, early in 1962, they were
released into a planted aviary that also contained Royal and Spreo
Starlings, Red-eyed Bulbuls, Scarlet Cocks of the Rock and Plumbeous
Redstarts, pairs of each. They settled down well in their new environ-
ment and it was then that the beauty of their song could really be
appreciated. So far as we are aware, no attempt to nest was made
during that first year. It may appear strange that I employ the phrase
" so far as we are aware ", but the reason for this is that, when they did

go to nest, the site was not revealed until such time as there was a
nestling.
It was late in July 1963 that they began to get very excited whenever
anyone entered the aviary, flying in and out of the overhanging trees,
chattering incessantly. Nevertheless, they did not come down for any
of the live-food placed in there, at least not whilst we were present.
However, on 25th August, from another aviary one of them was
observed carrying a moth into one of the dense bushes and coming out
empty billed. Then, during a temporary lull in the general bird noises
always evident in an aviary, a faint cheeping was heard. On examina-
tion of this bush, carried out under a veritable bombardment of protest
cries by the Greenbuls, an open, cup nest containing one nestling was
found. It was obvious at a glance that it was a young Joyful, for the
colouring so closely resembled that of the adults. It was almost fully
feathered and, to hazard a guess, was about one week old. The gape
was bright orange, margined in pale yellow.
When it left the nest six days later, the upper plumage was green with
a brownish wash, the underparts being pale yellow, washed with green.
Both parents fed the fledgling, varying the diet between live-food and
fruit, but seldom attempting to do so while any of us were in the
vicinity. It grew rapidly, finally attaining full independence on
18th September, although, prior to that date, it had been seen feeding
on its own. Now, at six months old, it is identical to its parents,
favouring the male in its call note and overall colouring.
Unfortunately, owing to the tardiness in locating the nest, it is not
possible to supply any data as to the size or colour of the eggs, nor as to
how many made up the clutch. The nest had been constructed of
Spanish Moss, rootlets, and fine grasses, was about 9 inches across the
top with a central cup about 2J inches deep. Maybe there will be an
opportunity of gleaning information concerning the eggs, and further
details of the nestlings, if they decide to breed again this year. If such
is the case a report will be made on these items in due course.

The Tropical House is 240 feet long, 200 feet wide, and 40 feet high
in size, and is constructed mainly of reinforced concrete and sandstone.
Translucent sheeting is used as extensively as possible for the roof and
sides, to allow the maximum amount of light penetration. Included in
the building are the Reptile House, Nocturnal House, and Pigmy
Hippo, Gorilla, and Orang Utan enclosures, as well as vast accommoda-
tion for free-flying birds and spacious aviaries. The whole construction
is on two levels, with a large ramp between the two and numerous
pathways wind their way amidst profuse tropical vegetation. When
walking round the house, visitors can view the birds in flight and from
all angles, and seats are provided for those who wish to bird-watch in
comfort.
A tropical and sub-tropical rain forest have been recreated as
closely as possible--the temperature varying in different areas to suit
the particular animals exhibited there. The temperature at ground
level in the centre of the house averages 70* F. and the humidity is
70-75 per cent but at the upper level the temperature is slightly higher
and the humidity somewhat lower. The house has been planted with
trees, shrubs, and flowering plants--all thriving well and growing fast
under these ideal conditions.
Over 250 birds of seventy species have complete freedom within the
confines of the house, enabling visitors to observe them in surroundings
similar to their natural habitat. Hummingbirds and sunbirds are a
special feature and our many species are doing extremely well. Also
at liberty are Touracos, African Starlings, Bluebirds, Zosterops,
tropical finches and many other species. Numerous nectar bottles and
feeding tables are provided and fruit for the larger birds is skewered
onto branches located throughout the house. To help the general
public to identify the birds many species are depicted in coloured
illustrations. Eventually it is hoped to have illustrations of every
species exhibited, but in the meantime a list of all the free-flying birds is
given to each person entering the house.
A row of aviaries included at ground level is designed principally to
house the Toucans, Barbets, and Hornbills, which cannot be mixed
with the other birds at liberty. Also in these aviaries are Go-away
Birds, Rollers, Weka Rails, Quetzals, and a Flicker. There is another
row of aviaries at the top of the ramp, in the upper level, which are now
empty but are reserved for a collection of Birds of Paradise--due to
arrive in the near future. All the aviaries are planted to resemble the
natural environment of the birds.

The suddent death of Cecil Webb on 10th April, 1964, at his home in
Nairobi, Kenya, at the age of sixty-six, has robbed field zoology and
aviculture of an outstanding personality. It has also brought a profound
sense of personal loss to his many friends who held him in the highest
esteem and affection.
His early days were passed in his father's home in Essex, where he
and his brother Leslie ran a poultry farm, specializing in Buff
Orpingtons and exhibiting them with great success. Both brothers
were imbued with the spirit of adventure, and shortly before the first
world war they sold their farm and went to South Africa, where they
became overseers on an experimental farm in the bush veldt. Here, in
addition to learning the care of cattle, mules, donkeys and pigs, the
brothers were introduced to ostrich farming. Some aspects of this were
exceedingly dangerous, especially when the birds had to be caught to
have their feathers plucked. It was here that Webb got his first glimpse
of the wonderful bird life of South Africa--Hornbills, Rollers, Bee-eaters
and Glossy Starlings, besides coming into daily contact with the various
antelope and other game which strayed on to the 10,000 acre farm.
This ideal life was interrupted by the declaration of war in August,
1914, and the partnership was broken, Leslie being made manager
of a ranch and Cecil being hastily equipped with horse and rifle and
ordered to be prepared to fight rebels against the South African Govern-
ment. After the campaign against the Germans in South-West Africa,
he volunteered for overseas service in a regiment of heavy artillery,
where he was rejoined by his brother. The regiment, the 71st Siege
Battery, consisted of 6 inch howitzers and was the first South African
unit to arrive in England for service on the Western Front.
It was at this point, in June, 1916, that I first met the man who was
to become a lifelong friend. I was Regimental Medical Officer to a
group of batteries and made daily visits to the 71 st which was dug into
a camouflaged position in a little orchard at Mailly-Maillet, near
Albert, in readiness for the great battle of the Somme which started
on 1st July, 1916. In the autumn of that year, after the advance up
the Ancre, the 71st was moved to the Ypres salient, and for some years
we lost sight of each other.
Webb's first venture into the animal-collecting business was made in
September 1919, when he brought back to England a large number of
South African birds which he and his brother had collected in the
Transvaal. He disposed of them to the livestock department of a big
London store, and being pleased with the success of his venture, cabled
his brother to bring home another consignment. He then returned to
the Transvaal and applied himself to trapping birds of all kinds,
including many rare insectivorous birds such as Burchell's Crimson-

breasted Shrike, Thrushes, Sunbirds, and Lapwings. It was then that
he started to experiment with various forms of synthetic foods to
replace the birds' natural diet.
After this expedition he tried to settle down in England, but the urge
to travel and collect was too strong. This time he went to Bechuanaland,
Rhodesia, and Portuguese East Africa and started in real earnest to
become an animal collector. He brought most of his collections to
the London Zoo and gave them the first choice of rarities, while the
rest went to private collectors, notably the late Mr. Alfred Ezra, the late
Mr. John Spedan Lewis, and M. Jean Delacour. It was at the latter's
suggestion that he made an expedition in 1927 to Annam in Indo-
China, where he collected many rare Thrushes, Babblers, Pittas, and
Bee-eaters. One bird he managed to establish was La Touche's Owl
which had never been brought alive into captivity. There were also
many pheasants, including Rheinhardt's, Edward's Blue, Fire-back,
and Ghigi's Peacock Pheasant. Most of these birds went to
M. Delacour's aviaries at Cleres.
It would be impossible to enumerate in detail his many expeditions,
but one of the most important was in 1929, when he went with M.
Delacour to Madagascar and returned to the London Zoo with, among
many other specimens, an Aye-Aye, a highly specialized Lemur. The
Zoo had not seen one of these exceedingly rare and interesting animals
since one imported in 1862.
For some time I had been urging him to visit British Guiana to try
to bring back specimens of that curious prehistoric-looking bird, the
Hoatzin. In 1921 I had myself, following William Beebe's instructions,
found a thriving colony of these birds on the Canje Creek. I described
this to him and told him how to get there. I had only been able to
bring back skins for the British Museum but Webb got five live birds
which he fed on fresh caladium leaves, gradually weaning them on to
lettuces. When he returned with his collection, which included Sloths,
Tapirs, Cock of the Rock, and Humming Birds, the five Hoatzins were
alive. Unfortunately three died of cold during the journey home and
one only survived for a day after arrival, but the remaining bird was
in perfect condition and lived in the Zoo for some months. This was
the first time a Hoatzin had ever been brought into and kept in capti-
vity anywhere in the world.
During the 1930's, expeditions followed to Kenya, Tanganyika,
Australia, the Gamerouns, India, the Gold Coast, and Ecuador, and
on five of these expeditions he was accompanied by his niece, Delys
Webb, who helped him to feed and care for his collections.
Then, in the summer of 1939, he went for the third time to Madagas-
car. War was declared and for six years he was marooned in this great
island, at one time without news of the outside world for two and a half
years. He was forced, through lack of funds, to take to the jungle

where he could live for next to nothing. The list of creatures he captured
and preserved during his enforced stay would take many pages, and
his adventures when the Vichy Government took over and the island
became a German satellite make interesting and exciting reading,
especially the part he played in the British invasion of the island. This is
all described in his autobiography A Wanderer in the Wind (Hutchinson).
His entire collection of skins of lemurs, rodents, insectivores, and birds
was purchased by Sir John Ellerman, who presented them to the
British Museum.
When Webb eventually succeeded in getting a letter through to me
at the end of the war, I arranged for him to travel to Mombasa and
pick up a load of animals which various friends of the London Zoo had
got together to help restore its depleted collections. These included the
African Elephant " Dicksi ", a Baringo Giraffe, baboons, monkeys,
antelope, lions, and snakes. He was able to get a passage on the
S.S. City of Calcutta which was bound for Liverpool, but at his suggestion
I succeeded in getting the ship diverted to the Port of London, which
cut several days off the voyage and eliminated the railway journey
from Liverpool to London.
Soon after his return, the Zoological Society appointed him Curator-
Collector and he immediately went back to Kenya in the winter of
1945-46 to bring home an even larger collection--eighty-seven
mammals, 150 birds and two large pythons. The mammals included
six Giraffes (three of them reticulated) and a Black Rhinoceros. Most
were finger-tame for he found that tame animals had much more
chance of survival on a long journey.
In February, 1947, he visited British Guiana for the second time and
brought back a representative collection of South American species,
including a Harpy Eagle and many Humming Birds. There was yet
one more trip for him--to the British Camerouns, where he was successful
in capturing and bringing home a bird equalling the Hoatzin in rarity--
a Grey-necked Picathartes, the first ever to be brought into captivity.
This bird lived for several years in the Tropical House at Regent's Park.
He was, more than anyone, responsible for re-stocking the London
Zoo and Whipsnade after World War II. In all he had made over
twenty major expeditions to every part of the world in search of animals.
On his return from the Camerouns he was appointed Curator of
Mammals and Birds at the London Zoo but retired from this post
for personal reasons in 1951. In April of that year he married a great
friend of ours, who was to share thirteen years of absolute happiness
with him, for Daisy Burlington-Green proved an ideal companion who
shared his interest and love for all living creatures. Shortly after
leaving Regent's Park he was appointed Superintendent of the Dublin
Zoo, where he made many improvements, but after five years he became
restless again and decided to return to the warmth of Kenya. For a

time he and his wife settled on a small estate at the foot of Mount
Kenya, to which they became very attached, but they had to sell out
under the Land Settlement Scheme, so they moved to Nairobi where
he was given a Curatorship at the Coryndon Museum, a post he held
until his untimely death.
In my opinion he was one of the greatest animal collectors of all time.
For forty years his life was devoted to the capture, handling, and care
of wild animals, for which he possessed a unique gift. It must be
remembered that his collecting was done before air transport for
animals came into common use, and it was amazing to see the perfect
condition in which he would deliver the smallest and most delicate
creatures after many weeks of travel by land and sea.
The Webbs were never happier than when they had a house full of
unusual pets. One of the most attractive wild creatures they reared
from birth was " Horace ", a wild Irish Hare, about which he wrote
a delightful little book, A Hare About the House (Hutchinson, 1955).
In his last letter to me, written only a fortnight before his death, he
told me of their latest pets :
" A Pearl-spotted Owlet, 3 inches high, amazingly tame and loves
being held. One of our greatest joys is a Ruppell's Robin-chat who
sits in a hedge close to the house and mimics everything in a loud
voice. His repertoire includes the calls of Kites, Fruit Pigeons, Red-
chested Cuckoos, Paradise Flycatchers, Bee-eaters and many others,

By Jean Delacour (Cleres, France)
Because of the favourable climate of California, and probably also of
the way of life there where most people have the use of a garden, more
birds are kept and reared around Los Angeles than perhaps in any
other part of the United States or even of the world. But we seldom
read much about them, as most of their owners are either too busy, or
too reluctant to write. Only Mr. A. H. Isenberg and Mr. D. West take
the trouble to report to this magazine. A few others give some news of
their birds in the American (Los Angeles) Avicultural Bulletin, but not
to any great extent.
I have spent nine years in California (1952-1960) as Director of the
Los Angeles County Museum, and I still go there every winter for a
couple of months, so that I do not lose touch with the local aviculturists.
As the Honorary President of the Avicultural Society of America, I
usually attend its yearly Christmas dinners and one or two monthly
meetings. Furthermore, I stay most of the time with either of two close
friends, Mr. Ray Thomas and Mr. W. J. Sheffler, who have large
collections and know much about birds, but who never write ... I
think therefore that a few lines on their aviaries and those of some other
prominent collectors may be in order.
Most kinds of birds are kept in California. Pheasants, Partridges,
Quails and other game birds are reared in quantities, as well as Water-
fowl. Parrots and Parrakeets are particularly popular. Many Pigeons
and Doves, Finches and Waxbills breed freely. A number of people
keep mixed collections, and a few possess remarkable series of fruit and
insect eating species. The San Diego Zoo, of course, maintains a very
large and beautiful collection of all sorts of birds and propagate many
interesting ones under the care of an able curator Mr. K. C. Lint.
What I shall try to depict here is the recent achievements of a few
aviculturists who have been for several decades very skilful and
successful with different birds, but who seldom or never have recorded
it in print.
The roster of aviculturists in California is subject to many changes as
years pass. A number take up birds, often at once on a big scale, either
as amateurs or as professional breeders; they may be lucky and prosper
at first, but most of them soon become discouraged and give it up as
quickly as they have started. There are however many happy excep-
tions to this rule!

real bird lover and a good gardener, and that he also owns orchards
which contribute to his income. His aviaries are roomy and numerous,
disposed on a semicircle around a large expanse of grass dotted with
fruit trees, at the back of his house. Each pen is against a solid partition
and has a deep shelter, and several trees. Every one of them houses a
number of pairs of wild pigeons and doves, and a pair of pheasants:
Monals, Tragopans and Peacock Pheasants of several species. A
number of Crown-Pigeons and Nicobars are there, three of the former
(\0x25A0 Goura coronata ) and several of the latter have been reared in recent
years, as well as many Satyrs, Temmincks, Monals, Grey, Germains,
Palawan and Bronze-tailed Peacock-Pheasants. Of the smaller
pigeons and doves, Mr. Steinbeck has produced every year hundreds of
many species, some very rare. He also keeps several Crowned Cranes
in the garden, a pair of Blue and Yellow Macaws, and a number of
Australian Finches and Waxbills in special aviaries. I have known
Mr. Steinbeck, and have acquired birds from him, for more than
thirty years. I take the same pleasure in visiting his establishment and
discussing birds with him today as I did long ago. I hope to be able to
do it again for some years to come.

Mr. Frank E. Strange lives alone at Redondo Beach, near the ocean,
to the south of Los Angeles. A retired bank employee, he has been for a
long time the best breeder of Quails and Partridges in the world. He
has great knowledge and experience, and a very keen and unselfish
interest in those birds. His collections changed along the years as he is
continually acquiring species never kept before, which he practically
always rears for the first time in captivity. His installation consists of
many compartments, more or less 15x10 feet, and 6 feet high, with
long grass (no shrubs), boxes and perches, each for a breeding pair. The
eggs are mostly incubated by bantams, but reared in brooders with wire
bottomed runs. His techniques and care are such that he seldom fails
to raise the young. Here is the list of the species reared in captivity by
Mr. Strange during the last twenty years :

Quails :
Mountain, Mearns, Masked and Red Bobwhites, Colombian
Crested, Douglas, Gambel, Blue Scaled (2 races) from America ;
Jungle Bush ( Perdicula asiatica ), Painted Bush (P. irythrorhyncha) , Chinese

Harlequin, Cape from Africa ; Painted and Red Spurfowl, from India
(the Ceylon Spurfowl has been reared by Mr. Suthard at Long Beach.)
Mr. Strange has also bred repeatedly the Green Junglefowl from
Java and the Crested Tinamou from Argentina.
Mr. William J. Parsonson, of Paramount, is known mostly for his
successful keeping and breeding of Waterfowl. But he also rears
Pigeons, Doves, Tinamous and Sonnerat's Junglefowl. He is a true
lover of birds and plants, and I remember meeting him as a boy of
fifteen already dedicated to those hobbies. As an engineer working full
time for the County of Los Angeles, he is a busy man, but nevertheless he
finds enough leisure to look carefully after his birds. He has a large
collection of ducks in a big, wired-over enclosure, and rare geese, each
pair in a pen; also Black Swans. Grass is hard to grow in a dry climate,
but judicious feeding makes up for it. His greatest triumph has been the
breeding of a male Kelp Goose, a unique achievement to this day,
which he hopes to duplicate this year. He keeps a pair of this difficult
species in perfect condition on a diet of high protein and alfalfa pellets,
with the addition of some iodine to the food or to the water. He also
rears every year big broods of Orinoco and Andean Geese, some
Peruvian Crested Ducks, Ashy and Ruddy-headed Geese, Common
Shelducks and Laysan Ducks, to list only the rarer ones.
Mr. Harold Rudkin, at Fillmore, carries on with his family tradition.
Some of us keep a fond memory of his father, who lived to be almost a
centenarian ; he was a remarkable aviculturist, first in England, and
later on in California. He has a magnificent collection of parrots and
parrakeets, the gem of which are a pair of Spix Macaws and a beautiful
lutino (P. menstruus ) Pionus, all yellow and pink. He rears every year a
lot of young birds, a good many of which, particularly Macaws,
Cockatoos and Grey Parrots are produced from eggs incubated under
bantams, the young being hand-fed from birth. Mrs. Rudkin's help
in this matter is very important, and the birds so reared are naturally
extremely tame. Among them, in 1963, were two Red-tailed Black
Cockatoos.
Apart from the Parrots, Mr. Rudkin keeps small birds, fruit-eating
and others, such as Fairy Blue birds, Cocks-of-the-Rock and Tanagers,

and some Pigeons, Game birds and Waterfowl. Recently several
Victoria Crown Pigeons, Nicobars, Imperial Fruit Pigeons, Mountain
Witch Doves, Black and Black-necked Swans, various Peafowl,
Ocellated Turkeys and Ceylon Junglefowl have bred successfully at
Fillmore.

Mr. W. J. Sheffler built, forty years ago, a beautiful circular aviary,
with sixteen compartments radiating around a central shelter, all solid
masonry and steel frames, in the garden of his home at the foot of the
Baldwin Hills, in a central part of Los Angeles. Next to it is his private
museum, which contains a considerable collection of bird skins, mostly
from Mexico. The aviary still is in good shape, and well filled. There
are a number of Parrakeets and Parrots, Pheasants, Quails, Francolins,
Doves, Touracous, Tanagers and hundreds of Finches. His greatest
rarities are half a dozen of the beautiful Rosita's Bunting (Passerina
rositae) from S. W. Mexico, a bird larger than the well known Indigo
Bunting, a lighter blue, with the breast pink degrading to buff in the
belly in the male ; the female is light brown. Quite a number of
birds have been reared in Mr. Sheffler's flights along the years, one
of his greatest successes being the breeding of the Vermilion Tyrant
Flycatcher (Pyrocephalus rubinus). He had much larger series of Parrots
and Parrakeets, game birds and ducks first in the southern part of Los
Angeles, and later on at Salome, Arizona ; but those aviaries have
been abandoned some fifteen years ago after the retirement of the
attendant. They are now used by another amateur.

I was happy, as always, to spend a few days at Ross, to the North of
San Francisco, with my old friends Mr. and Mrs. Eric Kinsey. Mr.
Kinsey retired a few years ago and disposed of his larger place at Manor,
where they had long kept so successfully practically all the native
Californian birds, even the most difficult ones. Their new home has
only one bird room where some 80 birds, mostly native, live in cages,
but also a few exotics such as Clarinos, Solitaires, Shamas and Fruit-
suckers. Their skill in caring for difficult species, and the perfection of
their cages still are unsurpassed.

Mr. Ray Thomas possesses, in his fine and large garden at Bel Air,
the best collection of small birds in California, and also very fine
parrots and parrakeets. They are housed in a bird room, five large
flights, two of them planted with trees, 18 smaller ones with shelters at
the back, and 6 more in a transformed greenhouse. Most of the smaller
aviaries are reserved for parrots, but one contains two beautiful and
very rare males of the Banded Cotinga (Cotinga c. maculata) from
eastern Brazil, a present from Dr. E. Beraut ; the gleaming blue of the
plumage is magnificently contrasted with the silky plum colour of the
throat and lower breast. Another compartment is inhabited by a
number of small Waxbills and Parrot finches, and a third one by a pair
of Rothschild's Starlings. Among the parrakeets which live in the other
pens must be mentioned Crimson Wings, Kings, Queen Alexandra's,
several other Australian species ; Queen of Bavaria's Conures ; lutino

and blue Ringnecks. A pair of bluish Ringnecks imported from India
five years ago, have produced pure blue offspring as well as bluish ones.
There are also a Hyacinthine Macaw, a Hawk-headed Parrot and a
bronze-winged Pionus (P. chalcopterus ).
The five large aviaries are the homes of hundreds of small and
medium sized birds. So many are kept together that fighting between
them is discouraged and seldom occurs. Many species and individuals,
which would readily kill one another under other conditions, live
happily together, and losses are much smaller than the average bird
keeper would expect. As the birds are most carefully fed and the
aviaries very clean and well kept, they do not suffer from overcrowding.
Of the three smaller aviaries, which are nevertheless 25 x 30 feet or
bigger, one is full of Finches, small Starlings, Bulbuls, small Troupials,
large Tanagers, Thrushes, Robins, Babblers, South American Buntings,
Sparrows, Weavers, Whydahs, etc.; even a Pitta and a Cock-of-the
Rock live there. Some belong to species seldom kept such as the
Grey Starling ( Cosmosparus unicolor ), the Indian Stare ( Saroglossa
spiloptera ), and several South American Buntings : Pselliphorus tibialis ,
Arremon taciturnus , Poopsiza torquata and P. whitei.
Another aviary, large and planted, is stocked with innumerable species
of small Tanagers, Sugarbirds, Waxbills and other little birds, and some
bigger ones, among which Amethyst and Emerald Starlings, several
Fruitsuckers and Babblers. The third one has Fairy Bluebirds, Blue-
throated Toucanets, different Asiatic and South American Barbets,
large Tanagers, Orioles, Troupials, Bellbirds and Starlings.
The two larger flights are full of bigger birds. One shelters the
stronger ones : Pink-crested, White-cheeked and Purple-crested
Touracous ; Toco, Greenbilled and Sulphur-breasted Toucans ;
Lidth's and various Mexican and South American Jays and Magpies.
The other one accommodates over a hundred Touracous (Knysna,
Senegal and Schutti), Jay-Thrushes, Spreos, Glossy Starlings, Mynahs,
Troupials, large Barbets, Toucanets, Thrushes and other medium sized
species. It is a remarkable show, and a successful one when one
considers the great number of species thus associated. During the weeks
I have just spent with Mr. and Mrs. Thomas, as I do every winter
since my retirement, I thoroughly enjoy this large and excellent
collection of birds. Mr. Thomas also most kindly keeps for me, until
the spring comes to Europe, the various birds that I cannot resist
buying when I am in California.
There always have been good bird shops there. Many have gradually
disappeared along the years. But new ones have opened. A number of
retail dealers around Los Angeles have interesting birds at present,
and one wholesale man, Roy Marshall (M. and M. Bird Ranch,
Monrovia) always shows a large assortment of species from all over the
world, some very unusual. Those from the Americas, particularly

By Robert A. Copley (Hemingford Grey, Hunts, England)
In the spring of 1964 the two pairs of Hooded Mergansers nested,
one pair in a box in a high bank of grass and the other laid in several
boxes.
The eggs of No. 1 were collected carefully and turned everyday until
nine had been laid ; they were then put under a specially selected
bantam ; in 32/3 days they hatched. Care had been taken to apply an
overhead heating lamp every time the bantam came off.
Different methods were tried to induce them to feed, a cellophane
bag with two tubes in it for the maggots to emerge did not seem to
interest them so a maggot was threaded onto a needle and cotton and
swung in front of the youngsters who immediately showed great interest
and in a few hours they were catching and eating the flying maggots.
Four young were eating on the second day and the whole five eating
and drinking on the third day. This was rather a laborious way of
feeding and soon it was found that the young jumped at the maggots
as they were being threaded.
It was an extraordinary sight to see these difficult feeders fighting
for the maggots as they were threaded onto the needle. This dispensed
with the cotton and for the next four days they voraciously consumed
a quart of maggots and some mealworms. This was so unexpected
that the maggot supply had to be doubled.
At seven days they started picking up maggots and mealworms on
their own, but still preferred the food presented from above them
when they would actually have a tug-of-war if two happened to seize
the same maggot. If the long needle was held horizontally two or
three would swing on the needle trying to pull off maggots.
This hatch did not have a weakling though one did have an eye
blocked up which was opened in warm soft water and was in working
order soon afterwards.
In six days the young had doubled in size and instead of feeding eight
times in twenty four hours the period was reduced to six ; this made
night feeding 11 o'clock, 4-5 o'clock, 8 o'clock. The feed at 2 a.m.
ceased on the fourth day.

It was extremely lucky to find a completely docile and friendly
bantam that did not mind the daylight heating lamp on day and night.
The young, even when only a few days old, stretched and sunned
themselves in the rays of the heater while the poor bantam panted.
Directly maggots were started to be threaded they would all five begin
plucking my hand and the maggots on the needle. One or two got
pricked and promptly went under the bantam but returned before
the feeding was over. They could be fed while sulking in this way.
Some seized the needle as well as the maggot and became very
dangerous dashing about with a long lance pricking the bantam and
the other birds before being disarmed. It was fortunate that no damage
was done to others.
At fourteen days old they were quarter grown and were eating bread
and milk with eggs, sand, and fishmeal, but a large number of maggots
were consumed every day.
Three of the other four fertile eggs of the second pair hatched ; one
a week early and it only lived twenty-four hours. One died in its shell
and one hatched only with considerable help. These had to be fed
every two or three hours and the flying maggot principal did not
provoke the immediate response as it did with the other five.
Unfortunately the bantam in this case took every flying maggot it
could. This appeared to discourage the one remaining youngster as
much as it did the feeder. So it had to be done by hand with tweezers
every two hours night and day for a week. At a fortnight the youngster
was still boarded for food and lodging and looked like being a guest for
a long time and had not grown appreciably.
Bantam and young were allowed in fine weather (May) into the
garden where the young picked up leaves and tried to eat them ; any-
thing brown interested it particularly a leaf blown by the wind. But put
a maggot or mealworm beside the leaf and it would promptly turn its
back. At a week or ten days old this young bird was very little bigger
than when first hatched and on the fourteenth day was found on its
back dead.
The first pair laid again eight eggs and the female was allowed to
start the incubation, but it was felt that this was too risky so the eggs
were given to a bantam. All of the eggs were fertile and in due course
hatching started. Two died in the shell, two died the same day, two
lasted three days, one lasted five days, one continued taking flying
maggots for five days and then lost interest. Every two hours it was
fed but died about ten days later. All this was a great disappointment.
The second pair laid again and the eggs were collected late in May
and put under a good bantam and the same conditions were followed
as in the first batch. All except one were infertile and that one was
broken by mistake.
The first five birds went on to open water at three months old and all

fed from one's hand. They like bread, milk, eggs, maggots and chick-

Certain lessons have been learnt but there are still more to learn
before the breeding of these wonderful waterfowl can come under
some planned control.

NOTES ON THE RUFOUS-BREASTED DUNNOCK
(Prunella strophiata )
</equation>
<bodyText confidence="0.987819294117647" page_id="56317889"  page_num="184" year="" vol="">
By C. J. O. Harrison (Perivale, Middlesex, England)
Dunnocks are rarely imported, and there has been little opportunity
to study any species other than our own common Dunnock, Prunella
modularise which is better known to some by the older and less apt name
of Hedge-sparrow. During part of 1962 and 1963 I was able, through
the kind help of John Yealland, to make some observations on two
Rufous-breasted Dunnocks, P. strophiata. This species occurs in India
where it is found on the Himalayas on open rocky ground or among scrub.
In a garden aviary with a shelter shed I found that they were terres-
trial feeders but otherwise spent much of their time in branches or on
the higher ledges on the inside walls of the shelter. They were secretive
and shy and difficult to observe since they tended to crouch motionless
or hide when disturbed. If one's approach had been noticed it could be
safely assumed that they would be found in the other part of the aviary
or round the other side of a bush, waiting quietly for one to go away.
As a result of this it was impossible to study their feeding in any detail.
They ate some mealworms and gentles and seemed to find minute
objects of interest on the floor of the flight, but I am pretty certain that
they also ate a great deal of seed, mostly millet. They were quite hardy
and seemed indifferent to the cold weather of the awful winter of early
I96 3-
They were in general similar to the common Dunnock in their
appearance, but looked a little longer in the leg, with a more hunched
look about the head and shoulders. Most of the plumage was light
brown with dark-brown streaking, and this extended over the back,
wings, top of the head, and flanks ; but there were some conspicuous
patches of colour. The sides of the head were blackish, bordered below
with white, and above by a black-edged superciliary stripe. This had
two distinct parts, the anterior part from the bill to just over the eye was
narrow and pale cream in colour, the hinder part from the eye to the
nape was much broader and of a bright orange-chestnut colour. When
the bird was active and the plumage sleeked the anterior part was more
noticeable as a pale streak, but when the plumage was fluffed up a
broad orange posterior stripe suddenly became very conspicuous. The

throat was white, streaked with pale grey, and the breast and fore-
flanks were orange, which in one bird deepened to a more tawny
chestnut tint, raising hopes that the sexes might be different. The belly
and under tail-coverts were white.
The sexes are said to be alike, and throughout the time that I had
them neither bird gave any indication of sexual behaviour, and
I finally suspected that both were hens. I received the birds at different
times, and when the second arrived the first was already established in
the aviary. Immediately the second bird was introduced, the first
approached it in a crouching posture and then chased it. This
crouching posture was obviously aggressive and was seen several times
during that day. The bird crouched with belly to the ground, tail
uptilted, and head thrown back a little with bill pointing up. In this
posture it displayed frontally to the other bird the contrasting orange
breast and white throat, as well as the bold head pattern against a back-
ground of darker plumage. Aggressiveness rapidly decreased and within
a few days was no longer apparent.
Apart from this single occasion the two birds showed little specialized
posturing. Wing-flicking did occur when they were nervous or excited
but this appeared to be less frequent and less apparent than in the
common Dunnock. What was more noticeable at times of excitement
or alarm was a marked momentary quivering of the tail in a vertical
plane, in a manner rather reminiscent of the Redstart Phoenicurus
phoenicurus though not so vigorous as in that species ; a movement
which I had not noticed in the Dunnock. This quivering occurred
during utterence of the alarm call, when it appeared to be related to the
force with which the call was given. But it also occurred when the birds
were silent but mildly disturbed.
Both birds were rather silent. The note given when they were dis-
turbed, which might have been a contact note or indicated mild alarm,
was a dry " trit-it-it ", more like that of a Bunting than a Dunnock. It
appeared to correspond to the " si-si-si 55 call of the common Dunnock.
The more intense alarm of excitement call was a rapid repetition of a
series of loud notes " tic-tic-tic-tic ", midway in pitch between the
alarm call of the Robin, Erithacus rubecula , which it closely resembled,
and that of the Wren T. troglodytes. This usually indicated that there
was a cat somewhere in the vicinity of the aviary. This note appeared to
correspond to the loud " seee " note of the common Dunnock. The
latter were present in the garden about the aviary and their song could
be heard by the captive birds. The wild Dunnocks did not respond to
the sight or calls of the birds in the aviary and the Rufous-breasted
Dunnocks did not respond to the sight, calls, or song of the wild common
Dunnocks. The difference in colouring and voice appeared to be
sufficient to prevent recognition and there was no evidence of any
interspecific reaction.

Although they were kept with a pair of Jay-thrushes and various
seed-eaters the Rufous-breasted Dunnocks did not appear to arouse
any reactions and did not conflict in any way with the other birds.
Possibly their inoffensive furtiveness and rapid movements prevented it.
There might have been some difference had other small and mainly
insectivorous species been present.

THE MASKED WOOD SWALLOW
By Charles Everitt (Trenton, N.J., U.S.A.)

The Masked Wood Swallow --Artamus personata --is one of the
Artamidae family, there being seventeen species in all, fourteen of which
are confined to the Australasian area, the others being found in Asia
and Africa. In some regions in Australia they are referred to often as
Swallow Shrikes and, in others, as Blue or Bush Martins. Gregarious
in their habits, often associating with the White-browed Wood
Swallow-- A. superciliosis --(see A.M. i960, 229), they generally collect
in the southern parts of Australia during their breeding season, ranging
from August to January.
The sexes are dissimilar, the adult male being slate-grey above, with
a jet-black face mask and throat patch, the latter edged with white.
The underparts are pale silver-grey, the tail being forked with the
feathers tipped with white. The underside of the wings is very pale
silver-grey, almost white. They have short, black legs and a sturdy
powerful bill, also black. They are about 8 inches in total length,
representing, with the White-browed, the two largest species of the
family in Australia. The female, of the same size, lacks the black face
mask and throat patch, these being replaced by very similar markings
in dark grey. The remainder of the plumage is duller than that of the
male, the under-parts being a smoky-grey.
Although in their native habitats normally they select low bushes or
trees for the location of their open, cup-shaped nests, in the planted
aviary a pair shared with White-bearded Honeyeaters, Cedar Wax-
wings, and Ruby-throats, despite many admirable nesting sites, they
chose a most conspicuous position in one of the feed stands. It was a
trough about 9 inches long by 3 wide, the sides being 2 inches high and,
normally it held three feeding cups. In this case, however, only two
cups were used and the swallows began building in the little 3 by 3-inch
square left. Actually the pair had been received by Mr. Boehm, direct
from Australia, in April, 1962, and nested in the same position that
very year, but failed to rear any young, undoubtedly due to their not
having been fully acclimatized. In order to provide more room, and to
avoid interference from the other birds at feeding time, the cups were

removed and placed elsewhere in the aviary. A nest of fine twigs and
rootlets was completed within three days and the first egg was laid on
13th March with a second the following day. Incubation, which was
shared, lasted for a period of twelve days and began with the laying of
the first egg. The eggs measured 21 by 15 mm., were light greyish-
green, clouded and blotched with shades of brown and underlying
spots of grey.
The newly hatched chicks were very dark skinned, covered with
grey down, streaked with sooty-black. Their gapes were pale yellow.
As the nest was so shallow and it was felt that a danger existed of chicks
being ejected or dragged out of it, a wire frame was fitted around it,
raising the height to about 3J inches. The parent birds resented our
intrusions in a very physical manner, swooping down and striking us
continually whilst it was being put in place, but went straight back to
their young as soon as we got out of the way. As with the incubation,
the rearing was shared, live-food being the sole diet seen to be employed
during the nesting period. A wide variety of this was provided in the
form of mealworms, crickets, and whatever flying insects it had been
possible to trap by the use of night-lights. These last, however, were at
a minimum for, at that time of the year, they are not very plentiful.
Quill feathers were showing and their eyes were open at six days old.
Vacating the nest at fourteen days old, they were fairly strong on the
wing for fledglings, and immediately portrayed the characteristic of
the adults at feeding time by switching their tails from side to side as
they begged for food. It was now that the parent birds began to vary
their diet by introducing them to the ground raw beef and the chopped
fruits, as a supplement to the live-food. The colouring of the young
birds was basically grey, heavily flecked with sooty-black, except for
the flight and tail feathers which were plain slate-grey. One of them
showed much darker face markings than the other and it was assumed,
correctly as it turned out, that there was one of each sex. All subsequent
breedings have shown the same difference, thus revealing that they are
sexable as soon as they leave the nest. Actually, it had been noticed
whilst they were still in the nest, the difference being apparent at about
eleven days old.
They were independent at thirty days old and adult plumage finally
was acquired at six and a half months old. In all, they had four rounds
that year, 1963, rearing seven young, four male and three female. In
each instance the young birds had to be removed as soon as the female
went to nest again as the male began to chase them around. Most
gregarious in the non-breeding season, it has been found that, with
aviary birds at least, once they decide to go to nest they do not want
any other Wood Swallows around.
Since we lost our original White-browed Wood Swallow males but
have two females left, it was decided to pair the young Masked males to

the female White-browed with the hope of, eventually, by selective line
breeding, producing a visual White-browed male. The outcome of this
experiment, begun in 1964, will be subject of a separate paper at a later
date although I can say that, at the moment, June, 1964 we do have
three fine hybrids, fully independent, and the parents are sitting again.
It does look as though there may be one male and two females
amongst them, but it is too early to be sure on this point as, since they
are hybrids, it is not known to what extent the face markings will differ
in the sexes. As stated above, a full paper on this hybridizing will be
produced once the birds have acquired full adult plumage, and it is
hoped that 1965 will see the commencement of phase two, pairing of
one of the male hybrids back to its mother, endeavouring to lessen the
influence of the Masked in the final colour pattern.

Arrivals during June and July include a number of interesting birds
presented by Dr. K. G. Searle. These are four Red-thighed Falconets
(Microhierax caerulescens burmanicus ), two Falcated Teal, five Little
Egrets, one Eastern Cattle Egret, one Eastern White-breasted Waterhen,
one Watercock, two Chinese Necklace Doves ; the following bulbuls :
three Chinese ( Pycnonotus s. sinensis ), two Chinese Red-eared (P. j.
jocosus), two Chinese Red-vented (P. aurigaster chrysorrhoides) , one
Brown-eared ( Hypsipetes amaurotis ), one White-headed Black Bulbul
(.H . madagascariensis leucocephalus) , and a Black-naped Oriole. The
falconets are of a race new to the collection : there are two races of
this species, the nominate one living in parts of India and Assam and
burmanicus in Burma, Shan States, Siam, and Annam. Small birds and
mammals, beetles, butterflies, and dragon-flies are among the natural
foods and the nest is generally in a disused barbet or woodpecker hole,
three or four white eggs forming the clutch.
Two new African species have been presented by Messrs. G. H. and
J. R. Newmark. These are the Abyssinian Crimson-wing ( Cryptospiza
s . salvadorii ) and the Oriole Finch (. Linurgus olivaceus).
Other acquisitions of particular interest are eleven immature Rosy
Flamingos ( Phoenicopterus r. ruber), thirteen Kittiwakes, a White-crested
Hornbill of the race from Ghana, Berenicornis albo-cristatus macrourus,
and a Blue-backed Chlorophonia ( Chlorophonia cyanea).
When the breeding pair of Sarus Cranes nested, the two eggs were
sent to Leckford where one chick hatched and is so far thriving. A
second clutch was laid, one weakly chick hatching and living for about
a week. As crane chicks can be reared by domestic hen foster mothers,
the practice of taking at least the first clutch should certainly be tried
in the case of the rarer species.

Four ErckePs Francolins and three Sonnerat's Jungle-fowl chicks
are being reared by their respective mothers : one Mealy Rosella has
left the nest and a second clutch is being incubated.
In 1962 a pair of Masked and a pair of White-throated Jay-Thrushes
were put into the Waders' aviary where they have lived ever since. In
that year the Masked built a nest and laid, but the eggs did not hatch.
This year three nests were built and in one a chick of the Masked has
been reared, not entirely by the parents as it appears, for whenever
they were not near, one of the White-throated sat on or by the nest.
Whether the chick was fed by all four birds is not known and the height
of the nest and the density of the privet bushes in which it was built
made it difficult to see what exactly did go on, but the incubation of
the egg or eggs seemed to be done entirely by the hen Masked and the
others did not interfere until the chick or chicks hatched. One of the
nests is believed to have been built by the White-throated and this was
in a willow tree, but so far as is known no eggs were laid there.
Last year a pair of wild Herring Gulls, evidently attracted by those
living in the Southern Aviary, stayed behind in the spring and nested
on the high rockwork of the adjoining sea lions' pond, rearing three
chicks--the first record of wild Herring Gulls nesting in London. This
year a pair nested on the rocks and a second pair on a wide ledge that
runs round a ventilation turret on the nearby Ostrich House, each pair
rearing one chick.
A Sclater's Crested Guineafowl [Guttera edouardi sclateri) collected by
the late Cecil Webb in British Cameroon during 1948 has died.
The Secretary has drawn attention to the erroneous use of the name
c Lady Gould's Finch ' to describe the Gouldian Finch. The tanager,
Calospiza nigrocincta franciscae, named in honour of a Mrs. Wilson, is
sometimes similarly treated. Another case is that of Estrilda rhodopyga ,
originally described by Sundevall and often called Sundervall's Waxbill
even by some who should know better. One sees strange names in the
advertisements, but there is perhaps some excuse for the Indian dealer
who used to offer Verditer Flycatchers and regularly called them

In the last number of the Magazine I mentioned that J. G. Hamilton
had bred the Purple-crowned Lorikeet in South Australia. I now learn
that Ted Bruton of Hawthorndene, Brisbane, Queensland, was also
successful last year. Two pairs nested. One pair laid a clutch of three
eggs which failed to hatch. The other pair hatched two young ones.
One young one fell into some plants and strangled itself but the other
was successfully reared to maturity.

The Eighth Annual Lunch, at the invitation of the Chairman and
Council of the North of England Zoological Society, was held at the
Zoological Gardens, Chester, on 8th July, 1964. Between eighty and
ninety members and guests attended. Mr. W. R. Partridge thanked
the North of England Zoological Society for entertaining our members
yet again. In an appropriate little speech he mentioned that Mr. G. S.
Mottershead had celebrated his seventieth birthday on 12th June, the
opening of the new Tropical House on 13th June, and the celebration
of the N. of E.Z.'s 30th Anniversary on the same day.
The weather was a little stormy at first, but the day developed into
a beautifully sunny one. The roses can never have looked better--in
spite of the buffeting they had received during the two previous days.
The new Tropical House was, of course, greatly admired. It was
especially fortunate that a small collection of humming birds had
arrived only the day before and so were an added attraction.
Once again the thanks of all are due to Mr. and Mrs. G. S.
Mottershead and Mr. and Mrs. F. Williams and indeed their entire
staff for their very considerable efforts to ensure the event should be
such a success.

(Bombycilla garrulus)
By Frank Meaden (Slough, Bucks., England)
When first obtained for research from the wild, the Waxwings have
little, if any, fear of humans. Immediately upon being liberated into a
roomy aviary they settle down almost to the point of a domesticated
creature, feeding within a few inches of one's person with no encourage-
ment other than a supply of fruit being available to them.
When handled initially, the plumage strikes one as resembling an
extra fine fur-like texture, far different to the touch than feathers of
most small birds we find here ; the voice, for it can hardly be called a
song, consists of a continuous, fairly quiet, halting, and rather melan-
choly Tsee-ee-ee tsee-ee-ee. When very active during early morning and
just prior to dusk this call becomes incessant ; during the breeding
season and when feeding young in particular, both sexes utter a low
Chup-chup , which is only audible from about 4 feet away. The song
proper is seldom heard, and is a series of different notes uttered on
various levels, the throat movement catching one's eye often before
the exceedingly quiet sound is noticed. The only other vocal manifesta-
tion noted to date is a nest-site call, practised by the male and audible
only within a 2-ft. radius. However, it may possibly be used by
females when sitting, as at these times I have had difficulty in tracing
its source ; it is perhaps also a request for feeding.
This species is easily catered for, but obesity must be guarded
against. Waxwings appear to be prone to nephritis, crystallising of
uric acid, brought on by an over-rich diet or severe chill ; the latter
need never be encountered if the birds are housed wisely under natural
conditions such as an outdoor aviary with merely a dry sheltered portion
for roosting. It is the artificially-heated shelter, more than any normal
winter drop in temperature, which appears to cause chills.
The food during winter months should for safety sake be kept
frost-free and consist of a little insectivorous mixture, diced figs and
dates, small quantities of grated carrot or other root crop, finely chopped
greenfood, any of the cabbage family or dandelion, spinach, cress, etc.,

a second dish containing wholemeal bread sop, of which they are fond,
will provide a little animal protein ; sweet apple should always be
available, also soaked household currants, and it is truly amazing how
much of these foods can be taken daily. Pear can be given occasionally
but is too loosening in any large or daily quantity.
With the spring a greater amount of greenfood will be taken in
addition to the above-mentioned diet ; the seeding heads of sow
thistle is a favourite, the head complete, being pulled off the plant and
swallowed whole ; with the longer hours of daylight comes a taste for
live food which is invariably ignored during the winter. Maggots and
fresh Wood Ants' " eggs " are taken freely and in ever-increasing
quantity until the birds come into breeding condition in late May
or June.
The courtship display is a fascinating study but is being dealt with
in detail (C. J. O. Harrison and F. Meaden) elsewhere, and a
briefer version will be described here. The male hops towards a
female and displays a few inches from her, he depresses the tail and
erects the feathers of the lower back, rump and upper tail-coverts, thus
forming an exaggerated hump on the lower back, and at the same time
belly and under-coverts are raised. The crest is also raised to its limit
and the head turned slightly from the female ; there is a slight swagger
and with a response from the hen a gift-passing ceremony takes place ;
the latter may not entail actual food, in fact this is not a true courtship
feeding. Some small object, even inedible, may be passed from one to
the other for a number of times, there will frequently be a hop away
from the partner, a slight turning away of the head and then a repeat--
up to fourteen actual exchanges of gift have been noted.
From the side view this puffed-out stance gives the bird displaying
an extreme rotund appearance, tail and head vertical and yet from the
rear it is noted the wings are compressed tightly to the sides (see
sketch and photographs). With true courtship feeding there is no
display, just the offering of food from beak tip. This may be a bud from
blackcurrant or the actual fruit, an ant's " egg ", seeding head com-
plete with feathery portion, or any other small edible titbit. However,
it is never regurgitated but just passed from the male to female, beak-
tip to beak-tip, the former stretching himself taller and the female
adopting a slightly crouching position.
Since these birds are colony breeders in the wild, we provide them
with one large aviary. Until a hen has actually built there is no sign
of aggressive behaviour between the males ; at this stage, however,
there may be a certain amount of threatening, beak snapping, but no
damage resulting from it. Once a male has selected a mate, it would
appear that he objects to the close proximity of another male and by
this it is a matter of inches and not feet. When nest building is com-
menced in earnest almost any site may be chosen. I have had two hens

sitting within 8 or 9 inches of each other, both in full view of all visitors
on a shelf of fir branches we fabricated for them. Some have used
7-in. diameter nest-baskets, others built using the base afforded by
the tops of a dozen unused aviary partitions, approximately 5 feet from
the ground ; the lowest nest was some 3 ft. 6 in. above the aviary floor,
the highest about 6 feet, this even though similar sites existed up to
8 feet high.
The nest itself is built from twigs of heather or birch, some birds
using dry vegetation such as the stalks of shepherd's purse, quite a lot of
grass is used with relatively little moss ; coconut fibre seems popular
and for all their appearance of untidiness the nests are lined beautifully
with cow hair, cotton wool, and vegetable down from seeding heads.
We have made a point of providing every possible type of material ;
the inside diameter ranges from 3 to 3J inches, never above this when
first constructed, even though the outer dimensions have a far wider
range, at times larger than a Blackbird's nest. On the one occasion
when young were reared to maturity the nest expanded very con-
siderably. Waxwings' eggs appear to vary little in either size, shape, or

colouring. I can of course only speak of those kept under controlled
conditions ; the eggs are darkish blue-grey with black spotted and
streaked markings ; four has been the normal clutch and fourteen
days incubation, invariably by the hen, although males do seem to take
their turn when a female is feeding.
Were I to hazard a guess about our success in breeding these birds
I would suggest that it was brought about by their extreme tameness.
A sitting hen would fearlessly take food from the fingers of anyone ; it
being normal for her to offer her young whatever she was given by her
mate, I presume we in this way guaranteed the chicks receiving their
first feed. We made certain of this on this occasion (in previous years
the birds had not reared and we put this down to their wild habit of
hawking flying insects for feeding young) by offering the hen food when
we knew young had hatched. She accepted a number of ants' eggs and
swallowed them and, a moment later, whilst still being watched, she
raised herself slightly and lowered her head into the nest. The food
came up with a lot of slimy liquid, in no way digested, but coated with
this liquid which for a better name I will call " milk ".
Whether this " milk " is a food of high nutritional value or merely
a means of assisting the chick to take other food I am uncertain. From
then on the hen fed ants' eggs and bread sop to the nestlings whenever
I or any member of my family offered them to her, and from here on we
placed a small dish of ants' eggs within her reach as she sat on the nest,
this supply being replenished morning, noon, and about four in the
afternoon.
On the aviary feeding tray we kept a continuous supply of ant
larvae. No maggots were taken for the chicks, although daily supplies
were given, until around the eighth day. We offered no mealworms at all
during this period for fear that the shell-like skin might prove harmful.
I should mention here that every youngster which was close-ringed,
was lost. It was the same old story, despite each and every trick I tried,
always nest cleaning meant another chick thrown out; we breathed
warmth back into two but it proved only a temporary reprieve for
them.
The food during summer months can be varied considerably, so many
seeding heads are taken, even the ripe pods of the brassicas are torn
open and the seeds greedily devoured. Every form of soft fruit is taken
in the ripe stage, strawberry, blackcurrant, redcurrant, raspberry,
being favourites ; by shaking hedgerow branches over a large opened
sheet of brown paper we were also able to provide a wide variety of
insect life for feeding the young. With the arrival of the fall and its
abundance of wild fruit, we were able to obtain rowan berries by the
sackful, as many as eleven of these large berries were seen to be taken
at one feeding, the crop of the bird showing in an extended manner.
Always rather heavy drinkers, the Waxwing constantly visits the water I

trough when eating this fruit and that of hawthorn, whether assisting
the digestion or providing the required liquid for passing waste skins,
seeds, etc., I do not know, but they certainly do not bring up pellets.
We have found upon sieving and washing the droppings beneath a
running tap, that seeds do pass through the bird. Not knowing the
complete intake I cannot say whether some are ground to be powdered
waste or if the whole is passed, but an interesting point is that they do
eat large amounts of cuttlefish. At the request of a noted ornithologist
we studied this over a fairly lengthy period and found that where sea
grit was ignored, visits to the next dish which contained broken and
powdered cuttlefish, were quite frequent. They also nibble this from a
large piece in the same manner as a hardbill : presumably this must
assist in breaking up waste food particles such as hard fruit seeds or
passing them through.
At one time, in the hope that a number of ornithologists would be
able to observe this species nesting in the wild, we approached the
B.T.O. with a request that suitable habitat could be recommended
so that we could release two pairs during their breeding season (May,
June, or July). However, through lack of co-operation the idea was
discarded.
Being a firm believer in providing natural foods, our Waxwings get
regular supplies of Wood Ant larvae during summer months. With
these we collect large quantities of ants, in fact we have a complete nest
in one aviary. The point which I wish to make is that never in the ten
years or so in which we have kept these birds have I ever seen any sign
of anting behaviour ; so many species show an interest in this insect
yet the Waxwing will eat the occasional one or often use it in gift-
passing ceremony, but that is all.
Something which I have not noticed with other young birds struck
me when hand-rearing Waxwings--inside the bill are two fluorescent
and rather brilliant mauve patches. These appear to be directly under
the eye ball, though did not seem to be the colour of the eye showing
through the roof of the mouth, but I could well be wrong on this point.

{Speculipastor bicolor)
By W. R. Partridge (Evesham, Worcs. England)
In October last year (1963) Mr. David Roberts brought to this
country from Kenya a fine collection of birds, which included some
Magpie Starlings, Speculipastor bicolor , and I secured from him a cock
and three hens. Shortly after this I obtained another pair which had
been part of the same importation.
The sexes of this fine starling are easily recognizable, as they differ
in colour. The adult male has a glossy blue-black head and neck to
chest, back, tail, and wings. The base half of the primaries and under
wing-coverts, however, are creamy white, as are the breast, abdomen,
and under tail-coverts. Bill and legs black. The eye is a brilliant red.
The female has a slate-grey head and neck which extends to a black
band across the chest, back darker grey, wings and tail dull black and
underparts creamy-white. Bill and legs black. Eye more orange than in
the male.
When I got these birds home they were put into 4-ft. long cages in a
heated bird room, the original four birds in one and the pair in another.
Later the four were transferred into an indoor flight in the same room
from which they could be allowed into an outside flight for short
periods when the weather was warm enough.
At the end of April, when the weather started to improve, the birds
were moved into planted aviaries, the four into one and the pair into
another. Shortly after they had been put out three of the four birds
were sold and the remaining hen was put into the aviary with the pair,
giving the cock the choice of two hens.
The aviary flight measures 21 by 8 feet and at the back is an indoor
compartment 8 by 7 feet and about 8 feet high at the back, which is
lighted by a roof light and front windows. The birds are fed in this
shelter. The vegetation in the flight consists of a few small Lonicera nitida
and Snowberry bushes and one large nut bush. This is one of a range
of twelve similar aviaries which house principally doves and other
softbills. Also occupying this aviary when the Magpie Starlings were
first put in were a pair of Fairy Bluebirds, a pair of Dwarf Ruddy Doves,
hens of Blue-headed and Red Ground Doves. The doves were never
any trouble to any of the birds, but the starlings and Bluebirds after
settling down quite peaceably at the start soon became enemies. The
cause of the trouble was the cock Fairy Bluebird as he would tolerate
the hen starlings but not the cock, particularly when there were any
mealworms about, so they were removed from the flight.
The cock Magpie Starling soon became very fit and would literally
spend all day singing with his brilliant red eyes shining fiercely. For
nesting the birds were given the choice of two old boxes that mealworms

had come in and a hollow log. A box and the log were hung in the
flight and the other box was hung on the back wall of the shelter about
6 feet from the ground, and quantities of hay and straw were scattered
about the aviary.
The first sign of any interest in nesting was a piece of hay that was
found hanging out of the box in the shelter. This piece kept being
moved about and disappearing and then appearing again for several
days. Now whenever anyone went through the shelter to feed, one of
the hens would appear from the nest and on 12th June the nest was
inspected and on top of a few criss-crossed pieces of grass, a very flimsy
nest for a starling, four eggs were found. They were bluish-green,
lightly spotted all over with russet brown and about 27 by 20 mm.
Shortly after the hen started to incubate, the cock became very
aggressive towards the other hen so she, along with the two Ground
Doves, were removed to the adjoining aviary, leaving only the Dwarf
Ruddy Doves which were sitting at the time. The hen alone incubated,
and she sat very tightly, often not leaving the nest-box when anyone
walked through the shelter feeding. The first sign of a hatch was on
30th June, when squeaking was heard to come from the box. There
were two distinct notes, one stronger than the other, so at least two
chicks had hatched. A few days later when it was thought to be safe to
look in the box, three chicks were found.
Apart from their normal diet of Sluis Universal and minced raw meat,
the parent birds were given ad lib mealworms and maggots every night
and morning. They also consumed large quantities of sweet apple.
Both parents fed the youngsters and would often do so whilst someone
was in the shelter feeding and showed little fear. After about a week
one chick, that had been dead two or three days was thrown out of the
nest. On 22nd July both the remaining young left the nest for the first
time. They were quite intelligent from the start and found no difficulty
in finding their perches or the way in and out of the shelter.
The head, neck, back, wings, and tail of the young birds are a
uniform grey tinged with brown and the underparts are creamy white,
as in the adults. The eyes of the youngsters were dark brown, but now
as I write this in September they are beginning to turn red.
Within a few days of the youngsters leaving the nest, the old birds
were again carrying nesting material into the same box and had laid by
1st August. Again three young were hatched, one of which was thrown
out of the nest when still very young. The other two continued to
grow until we had a very hot spell for a few days and the shelter became
very hot. This proved too much for one of the youngsters who would
sit in the entrance to the nest-box to get as much air as possible and
in doing this fell out of the box on three occasions on to the floor
and eventually died. The remaining youngster left the nest on 6th
September.

198 K. M. SCAMELL-BREEDING THE SHELLEY'S STARLING
On 11 th September the parent birds were again carrying bits of hay
into the same box, which is i feet long by 4 inches wide and 7 inches
high. To-day, 15th September, they again have four eggs and one of the
first two youngsters is beginning to warble ; I can hardly describe it
as singing.
Mackworth-Praed and Grant in Birds of Eastern and North-Eastern
Africa , Vol. II, page 693, say this species comes from Southern Abyssinia,
Southern Italian Somaliland, and Kenya (where my birds came from),
and are of irregular appearance in most localities and given to very
wide wanderings. Generally noticed in small flocks at some height
which can be identified by their shrill whistling cry, but is sometimes
abundant when figs or other fruits are ripe. According to the same
authors, the nests as a rule are in holes in anthills, made of green leaves
and grass in chambers at the end of tunnels, and there are three or four
eggs which are bluish-green, heavily speckled and spotted with rufus
colouring.
As described, W. R. Partridge has bred the Magpie Starling
Speculipastor bicolor. It is believed that this may be a first success. Any

The Shelley's Starling is found in an area of East Africa which ;
includes Southern Abyssinia, South-eastern Sudan west of Lake
Rudolf, and the eastern half of Kenya. We have found it a shy bird
in an aviary though it steadies down in a cage.
In size the Shelley's Starling is like the Superb Spreo, about 8 inches j
long but it has a slightly shorter wing. In colour it is deep violet blue
above and from chin to chest ; breast to under tail-coverts, unbroken
dark chestnut. There is a green collar behind the neck and the wings
are glossy green with black spots at the ends of the wing-coverts.
There is some similarity in the general colouring to the Hildebrandt's j 1
Starling which is, however, less richly coloured and has a distinct light
chestnut colour on the breast contrasting with the deeper chestnut on
the belly.
We purchased three freshly imported Shelley's Starlings from Mr.
Dineen, then of Collier's Wood, about two-and-half years ago and last
summer turned them out into a planted aviary in which they were the
only occupants. The aviary flight measured 15 ft. by 4 ft. 6 in. wide by

7 feet high with a shelter at one end. High up in the flight, and with the
aperture facing west, we fixed a Cockatiel nest-box 10 inches square by
2 feet high with a hole near the top. It was half filled with peat and
some grass placed on top of the peat. At other places in the flight
was a smaller edition of the nest-box described above and another one
with a half-open front.
The birds soon settled down and agreed with each other, but as far
as I was aware, showed no inclination to breed. During the winter we
showed them once or twice, either singly or two of them as a pair.
They were kept together in a large cage in which they agreed. In
early May of this year (1964) they were returned to the same aviary.
On 17th May I picked up one of the Starlings, dead, in the flight. It
was unmarked and there was no apparent cause of death. The bird was
quite plump and did not have the appearance of having been driven
off its food by either of the other Starlings. As I mentioned earlier, the
birds are very shy and as their aviary is in a wood some way from the
house, they could always hear me coming, and I could never find out
how they were behaving.
On 8th June, I saw one bird only as I approached the flight, then
I saw the second bird emerging from the nest-box, so it seemed at last
they might be nesting. I decided to leave them alone, but increased
their mealworm ration. Unlike Superb Spreos, they wouldn't touch
gentles. Once or twice during that week I saw one bird only so I was
pretty sure that the hen was incubating. The cock sang continuously
from a nearby perch. On Sunday, 14th June, at about 5 p.m., my
husband stood on a short step-ladder and had a quick look in the nest-
box as both birds were in flight at the time. At first glance nothing
could be seen, but after a moment he saw a small naked chick on top of
the peat. It was probably only an hour or two old and was almost cold.
In the right-hand front corner was a scooped-out cup-shaped nest
lined with feathers. In it were two other chicks, larger and probably
hatched the previous day. He hastily returned the almost dead chick
to the nest, closed the hinged front and came out at once. I then
replenished the mealworm pot which was empty. There was no trace
of eggshells anywhere ; it is possible they are somewhere in the long
grass. I supplied the usual fruit soft food, also mealworms, from then on.
I also added gentles to ease the pressure on the mealworms which are
not only most expensive but seem to get in short supply most summers
when the breeding season is at its height. This is probably due almost
as much to the heat as to the demand. Once mealworms get overheated
either in transit or in store, they die off and blacken quickly. This
summer has been the hottest for three years and the only way I have
saved mealworms which have arrived in good condition is to spread
them out in containers in bran and also keep a supply in an old fridge
which I keep in the garage especially for storing soaked sultanas, figs,

pulped carrots, and my stock of gentles. On the occasions when
mealworms have arrived in bad condition, nothing much can be done.
On 16th June the Shelley's threw out one of the chicks--from its size
I would say it was the one put back in the nest two days earlier. A cold
wet spell was now with us, but the parents were far less shy than usual
and I was able to see them feed mealworms and gentles to the two
remaining chicks. I did not expect them to take to gentles seeing that
they would not eat any themselves, but with the mealworm shortage
they had to feed both !
The first Shelley's left the nest on 4th July--it was a fine bird and was
flying strongly. All the markings were dull, not glossy, the head and
back being an ashy-brown. I would reckon the bird was about
twenty-two days old. The second youngster left the nest the next day
and also flew high and strong. I don't think I have ever seen two
youngsters so fit at such an early age. They were almost as large as their
parents. There were no problems, feeding was normal, and all four
birds were generally very close together on high perches. On 19th July
I decided to remove the young birds from their parents as I had seen
them feeding themselves even though they gaped when near their
parents. It was about 6 p.m. when they were caught up and placed in a
flight in a birdroom where I could observe them. They made no
attempt to feed that evening nor had they fed by 8 a.m. next morning
so I returned them to their parents and left them there for another
fortnight, finally caging them on 3rd August. The parents were then in
fine condition and carrying nesting material, but I think that I left
the young with them too long as up to last Sunday, 23rd August, when
we had a look in the nest-box, it only contained grass and feathers on
top of the peat--no clear cup. I had hoped we would have had another
round and I particularly wanted to see the eggs. We have had two
clutches from two pairs of Superb Spreos this year, though none of the
young have been up to the standard of the Shelley's which are excep-
tional birds and though a little wild, are meated off on to soft food
containing fruit, gentles once a day, and a few mealworms. In colour
to-day they are showing some glossy blue on the lesser wing-coverts and
tail. The throat, head, and back are ashy brown, the chest and belly
deep chestnut. The eyes are dark grey-blue and not red as in the
adult bird.
As described, Mrs. K. M. Scamell has bred the Shelley's Starling,
Spreo shelleyi. It is believed that this may be a first success. Any member
or reader knowing of a previous breeding of this species in the United
Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland is requested to com-
municate at once with the Hon. Secretary.

g. The Red-Capped Parrot.
(.Purpureicephalus spurius)
Undoubtedly one of the most brilliant of all parrots, the Red-capped
Parrot was originally described from an immature bird in the Paris
Museum by Kuhl in 1820. It is generally believed that this specimen
was collected by Peron in the vicinity of King George's Sound, Western
Australia. When describing the bird Kuhl remarked that it was doubt-
ful if an adult specimen had ever been observed. Described under the
name of Psittacus spurius this species was subsequently subjected to a
variety of new scientific names until 1854 when Bonaparte introduced
the genus Purpureicephalus with pileatus the type. This specific name
had been previously introduced by Vigors in 1831 and was widely
accepted until the validity of spurius was established. Finally the correct
combination of the works of Kuhl and Bonaparte was universally
recognized and the name Purpureicephalus spurius came into existence.
An effective combination of bright colours renders the plumage of
the adult male very distinctive. Bright deep green is the colour of the
back and wings, while ultramarine blue is found on the outer edges
of the wing primaries, the inner edges of which are dark brownish-
black. The central tail feathers are deep green and this is offset by
blue on the secondary feathers, which are tipped with white. The
forehead, crown and upper nape are a deep crimson. Bright yellow-
green is found on the cheek patches, rump and upper tail-coverts.
This colour on the cheek patches merges into pea green on the throat.
The underparts are deep blue-violet, while the flanks and under tail-
coverts are red intermixed with some bright green. The oddly-shaped
bill is bluish-grey, the iris dark brown, and the feet light brown. The
adult female resembles the male. Individual birds may differ in
having the red cap marked with a sprinkling of green feathers and the
breast a dull greyish-mauve with the violet-blue restricted to the lower
abdomen. However, the flanks and under tail-coverts of all females
have a much stronger diffusion of green feathers. Immatures have the
crown dark green uniform with the back and wings. The blue on the
wings and tail and the yellow-green on the cheeks and sides of the neck
are noticeably reduced in both extent and intensity. The red cap is
represented by a rust-coloured frontal band. Dull cinnabar-brown is
the colour of the underparts, the lower portions of which are washed
with violet-blue. The flanks and under tail-coverts are strongly diffused
with pale green. It is a medium-sized, slim bird as indicated by the

Systematic Discussion

<bodyText confidence="0.995669794117647" page_id="56317921"  page_num="202" year="" vol="">
Many theories have been advanced to explain the development of
the Red-capped Parrot, but of these, three have become established as
the most worthy of serious consideration. However, before examining
each in detail it would be well to study the relationship between this
unique genus and the other members of the Platycercinae. Similarities
exist in the osteology with the incompleteness of the orbital ring and in
the articulation of the quadrate being unobscured. However, by the
same token the pre-orbital process is larger than in the other genera
and the post-frontal process is noticeably reduced, while the whole
cranium appears more slender than in allied forms. Externally, the
scalloping of the second to fifth primaries is typical of the broadtails.
The overall picture thus presented is that this bird occupies an isolated
position within the Platycercinae.
Mathews (1918) presented his evolutionary theory on the evidence
of colour change in the plumage, stating that the bill was the only
structural difference between this and the other genera. The essence
of this particular theory may be stated in saying that Purpureicephalus is
a specialized form developed from Barnardius. The main difference j
lies in the survival of the erythristic element in this species as shown by
the red crown and under tail-coverts, whereas Barnardius shows only
a red frontal band. Mathews used the plumage development from
immature to adult phase as an indication of the species' affinities to
the broadtails. As well as admitting to a major difference between the
two genera concerned, he failed to promote conclusively any colour-
change arguments supporting his findings. The author cannot support
this theory and must agree with Condon (1941) in using the unique
colour pattern and lack of blue cheek patches as arguments for the
separation, rather than combination, of Purpureicephalus and Barnardius.
The grouping with another genus was carried even further by
Cain(i955) who set about establishing affinities with Eunymphicus
cornutus of New Caledonia and the Loyalty Isles. The colour scheme
of this bird was stated to be that of Purpureicephalus with a great intensi-
fication of green and black, loss of blue on the underparts and restric-
tion of red on the head to a forehead band with a flush of yellow on the

crown. The main differences were that the bill was not elongated and
there was a small crest of two or three elongated feathers. It appears
to be a contradiction in terms to say that the plumage colours are
similar after dismissing the most conspicuous markings such as red cap
and blue underparts. Gain proposed incorporating E. cornutus into
Purpureicephalus stating that one was to the other what Platycercus elegans
is to Platycercus caledonicus or the genus Cyanoramphus is to Platycercus.
Such a statement demands close examination. If this were true
Cyanoramphus should be incorporated into Platycercus in spite of con-
spicuous anatomical differences. P. caledonicus and P. elegans are certainly
closely related as they show similar colour patterns and common
characteristics such as immature plumage and transition periods in
the development of adult colouration. Such obvious closeness of rela-
tionship is not evident with Cyanoramphus or with the two genera in
question. Geographically the two rosellas may be combined in the
one genus, but this is certainly not possible with the New Zealand
parrot or with Eunymphicus and Purpureicephalus. The author is not in
favour of the combination of these two genera.
Serventy (1938) outlined the theory of a relict form which once had
an eastern representative. This bird could have disappeared from the
eastern areas because of the over-specialization of the bill. Instead of
being derived from Barnardius it seems to have evolved separately from
the platycercine ancestral form. Using the colour pattern as a guide,
Serventy stated that Purpureicephalus could be more easily related to
Platycercus caledonicus than to Barnardius. This is most interesting
because the Green Rosella is regarded by many ornithologists as having
altered least from the common ancestors.
Condon (1941) discussed the above theory at length and modified
certain aspects of the bird's evolutionary history. Rejecting its affinities
with Barnardius he regarded it as an independent development from
the ancient prototype of the larger broadtails. The unique colour
pattern, the absence of blue cheek patches and the unusual cranial
structure adds considerable weight to this conclusion. Summing up,
Condon dismissed the south-western Australian origin of the Red-
capped Parrot and substituted its being the sole surviving member of
an assemblage of parrot forms which disappeared probably in the
Pleistocene. These forms could have been more widely dispersed than
at present.
Most existing evidence supports the theory of the Red-capped
Parrot being a relict species surviving in a restricted stronghold in
the forests of south-western Australia. However, the specialization of the
bill does not appear to be the main reason for the extinction of the
eastern representatives, although it may have been a contributing
factor. Observations have shown that Purpureicephalus uses its beak to
extract seeds from the fruit of other eucalypts besides Marri ( Eucalyptus

calophylla ) the species most closely associated with this parrot. It would
appear that related eastern forms could have adjusted to accommodate
the development of fruits of the eastern eucalypts. A combination of
changing forces undoubtedly prevented this happening in the eastern
regions. Whatever these factors were they were not as prevalent in
the south-western corner of the continent and the adjustments made
over a long period by the bird have resulted in the existence of
Purpureicephalus spurius in that region.
From a speciman collected by T. Carter at Broome Hill, Western
Australia, Mathews described Purpureicephalus spurius carteri in 1915.
This race was reported to differ from the typical subspecies in being 1
darker above and in having the cheek patches greener and the under-
parts dark purple. Subsequent examination of skins has failed to
support these differences and this race has been dismissed as invalid
by subsequent authorities.

The Red-capped Parrot is restricted to the forested areas of south-
western Australia, north to the Moore River and generally east to the
Great Southern Railway. In the south it occurs as far as Esperance
and rarely to Lake Grace. Vagrants are often observed east of the
Southern Railway as was the case with Garter's observations at
Broome Hill.
Within this restricted range Purpureicephalus is quite abundant and
is frequently observed even in the suburbs of Perth. They are usually
seen in pairs or small family parties feeding on the ground or flying
through the Marri forests. The rich gaudy colours of the adult birds
never fail to impress the observer. The brilliant blue of the primaries,
shoulders and undersides of the wings blending with the blue-violet of
the underparts renders the bird most conspicuous, while the contrast
of the red cap against the green back makes recognition easy. When
in flight the light yellow-green rump is displayed and this is the most
valuable aid to positive field identification.
During the day the birds frequent the Marri and other eucalypts
where they are most difficult to observe in spite of their bright plumage.
They are particularly quiet and the falling nuts and leaves are often
the only indication of their presence. As the intruder moves through
the timbered country the birds silently fly from tree to tree ahead of the
observer. It requires a strong disturbance to cause them to take to
the wing in alarm.
The flight is quite rapid with a little undulation. The short wings are
moved rapidly and this gives a somewhat buoyant effect when inter-
spersed with short periods of motionless glide. The flight is silent and
differs from that of the Platycercus sp. in being direct and in lacking
the overall curve towards the ground with the characteristic upward
glide before alighting. The tail is only slightly fanned before landing.
While in flight the peculiar call is usually emitted.
The call is a harsh, hollow, grating-like note uttered several times in
quick succession. This call is in addition to the shrieking alarm notes
given when disturbed. An analysis of the call notes of this species
reveals affinities to those of the Platycercus spp. of the eastern regions,
but the similarities are far outnumbered by the overall distinctiveness
of the voice of this unique species. Unlike most of the broadtails it
appears to lack any chattering call associated with feeding.
Early in the morning Red-capped Parrots may often be flushed from
the roadside where they have been feeding on green wild oats (. Avena
fatua) or from dams and tanks in the farm paddocks. Vagrants in the
semi-arid eastern areas are generally observed feeding on the ground
under the Mallee ( Eucalyptus occidentalis) and Marlock scrub. However,
the major source of food lies in the seeds of eucalypts and various trees
and shrubs. Birds from Bremer Bay were recorded feeding on the seeds

of Eucalyptus cornuta and Agonis flexuosa, the only trees in the area. The
specialized bill, which is illustrated in Fig. 1, is most useful in removing
the seeds from Jarrah ( Eucalyptus marginata ), Grevillea, Flakea , Casuarina
spp. and the Native Pear ( Xylomelum sp.). The fruit of the Native Pear
opens under the summer sun thus exposing the kernels which are
consumed in large quantities by the Red-capped Parrot. Blossoms of j
the Marri, Jarrah, Melaleuca and other trees and shrubs such as the
introduced Silky Oak ( Grevillea robusta ) are another source of food,
while apples, pears and citrus fruits are receiving more attention much !
to the orchardists' dismay. Nevertheless, it is the Marri ( Eucalyptus
calophylla) that is the most important item in the source of food and )
this association must be carefully examined.
The peculiar development of the bill of Purp. spurius has generally
been considered by most authorities as a specialization enabling the
bird to feed on the seeds of the Marri. Serventy (1938) following \
information provided by Carter (1924) and Alexander (1930) rejected I
this hypothesis because the bird is found outside the range of the Marri. ;
A specimen reported by Gould to have been collected at Port Essington
(see Salvadori, 1891) gave rise to an early belief that the species enjoyed t
quite a widespread distribution in the west. This, undoubtedly, was :
an error arising from incorrect labelling and the range was soon reduced
to the south-western corner of Australia, where the Marri is found.
Serventy is correct in saying that the parrot is found outside the range
of the Marri, but it is the author's belief that the observations used in i
forming this opinion were sightings of vagrants in areas where the
bird is quite rare.
The Marri is a large eucalypt with a dense foliage of large leaves
thus rendering it very useful as a shade tree on farms. The fruit as j

shown in Fig. 2 is large, thick and woody with average measurements
of 1 * 5 by i*2 inches, although specimens as large as 2 * o by 1-5 inches,
are not uncommon. The seeds within this bowl ripen over an extended
period and this means that many trees have an almost continuous
supply of fruits at all stages of development. Robinson (i960) has given
a full account of the Marri fruit as a source of food to south-western
Australian birds and the Red-capped Parrot figures most prominently
in this report. As soon as seeds have developed within the fruit it is
attacked by Purp. spurius. Preliminary tests on the fruit are made by
inserting the upper mandible into the bowl and when a tree with
suitable fruit is located the birds concentrate on that tree. The young
birds remove the fruit and while holding it by the stem peel off the
green skin by passing it through the bill. The older birds pick a fruit
and test it by the method described above and if unsatisfactory drop it
and move to another. If the fruit is acceptable the bird chops its way
into the bowl removing the seeds in the minimum time and with
maximum proficiency. It is with the mature fruit, however, that the
bird shows remarkable efficiency in the use of the elongated upper
mandible. The bowl holding the seeds is extremely hard and almost
impenetrable thus granting access to the seeds only through the lip of
the capsule. The adult bird revolves the fruit while holding it by the
stem and removes the seeds by inserting the upper mandible as shown
in Fig. 3. As well as feeding in the tree they often attack fallen nuts on
the ground. In this case the fruit will be merely steadied by the foot and
the bird will circle it removing the seeds in the same manner. The
whole procedure is performed swiftly and efficiently without marking
the lip. On the other hand young birds are comparatively clumsy in
extracting the seeds, indicating that experience improves the tech-
niques. This may or may not demonstrate that the extraction of these
mature seeds is the cause for the adaptation of the bill. Young birds
generally are not as agile in most facets of life as their parents. Even
if the elongation of the bill was originally brought about by factors no
longer present, it is evident that the substitution of this usage has been
to the advantage of the species. In spite of this anatomical peculiarity
the parrot is able to benefit from the ability of its kind to exploit new
sources of food such as seeds of shrubs and cultivated fruits. This
enables the species to live outside the Marri area without adverse
effects even though it is adapted to a close association with the tree.
In spite of its increasing diversity of feeding habits it appears to be
quite correct to assume that the shape of the upper mandible is a
modification to enable the extraction of seeds from the fruit of Marri.
Known throughout Western Australia as the King Parrot, Purp.
spurius is a resident species in the south-west. The numbers in a par-
ticular locality may fluctuate with the availability of food, but it
generally remains in each area throughout the year.

Sexing with this species is comparatively easy with adult birds, but
immatures present a little difficulty. Some people are under the impres-
sion that adult females resemble the immature bird, but this is not
correct. All immatures show a white " wing-stripe " which is retained
by the females and lost by the males with the first moult at about
twelve months. Immatures may be sexed by the difference in the head.
The male has a large flat head, while that of the female is small and
rounded. The mature plumage is attained over a period of approxi-
mately fifteen months. The author was fortunate in obtaining an
immature male of known age in March, 1963, and the process of
obtaining adult plumage was carefully noted. This is given here with
the admission that it applies to one bird only, but it should, neverthe-
less, be accepted as a valuable guide to the general procedure applicable
to the species. The bird was removed from the nest in December, 1962,
and no noticeable change took place until April, 1963, when the lower
underparts acquired a light violet-blue colouration. One month
later red feathers appeared on the crown and nape, the red on the vent
and under tail-coverts increased in both intensity and extent, the
underparts became noticeably violet-blue and the ear-coverts began
to show signs of moulting. It is interesting to note that the red cap
feathers began to appear in an uneven general pattern not from the j
forehead as may be expected. The cap rapidly established itself and in
a fortnight it was clearly defined even though a considerable quantity
of green feathers were still present. There was little alteration during
the winter months with the most noticeable change being an increase
in the intensity of the colours, particularly the violet-blue underparts.
The ear-coverts were still quite patchy. September and the beginning
of spring brought noticeable changes. The red feathers in the cap
began to increase rapidly, while the bright yellow ear-coverts became
established. The red on the vent and under tail-coverts spread to
the flanks and increased in intensity, as did the violet-blue of the abdo-
men and lower breast. The wings entered into a moult which was to
continue during the next six weeks. Little change in the plumage was
noticed until late summer, when the back took on a bright dark green
and the striking red of the vent and under tail-coverts was acquired.
Few green feathers remained in the cap by February, 1964, and the !
rich dark blue of the shoulders and undersides of the wings was attained.
By March, 1964, the glorious plumage of the adult male was exhibited i
by the bird.
The mating display differs markedly from that of the other broadtails ;
and further illustrates the isolated position of this bird. The male
takes up a position opposite or next to the female. This may be on the 1
same or a parallel branch of a tree or shrub. The red crown feathers
are erected and the wings drooped, thus exposing the bright yellow- j
green rump, the feathers of which are fluffed. The outspread tail is

then slowly raised towards the back. The typical tail-wagging and
squaring of the shoulders is entirely absent from the display.
The commencement of spring brings on a marked increase of
activity as pairs of birds investigate holes and hollow limbs in trees,
generally Marris, as nesting sites. Upon selection of a suitable hollow
the bottom is lined with decayed wood already present or formed by
the birds' scratching on the surface. Four to seven, usually five, pure
white eggs are laid. The eggs are rounded in form with a close-grained,
slightly glossy shell with average measurements of 1 *04 by 0*89 inches.
Up to nine eggs have been found but this is an unusually large clutch.
After incubation of three weeks the young are hatched naked and
helpless, but soon acquire greyish down. The sitting female is fed
regurgitated food by her mate. When she leaves the nest and alights
near the male he immediately erects the red crown feathers, droops
the wings and fluffs up the exposed rump feathers.
At first only the female feeds regurgitated food to the newly hatched
nestlings, but as they progress both parents assume domestic duties.
The nestlings leave the nest after approximately five weeks and remain
with their parents for some time thus accounting for the family parties
often observed.
Unfortunately, the Red-capped Parrot is more difficult than most
Australian species to keep in captivity. Because of its magnificent
colouring it is very desirable as an avairy bird, but disappointments
and setbacks are often experienced before they became established.
Newly trapped birds are wild and frightened. Adults should not be
purchased as they rarely settle down. Aviculturists have different
methods of treatment for young birds just incorporated into a collection,
but the author has confidence in the following procedure. Upon
arrival the birds should be placed in small cages about 3 by 3 by 3 feet.
If practicable each bird should be given a cage to itself. During this
time the flight aviaries should be prepared in the following way.
Branches with dense foliage should be introduced thus absorbing most
of the space in the aviary. Fish netting or similar material should be
erected about 6 inches inside the wire of the flight. This prevents the
birds injuring themselves by flying into the wire. After two months
confinement under supervision in the cages the birds may be placed in
the prepared avairies. During the next six months the branches and
foliage may be slowly removed from the flights as the parrots settle
down. Finally the netting may be removed and the birds left to com-
plete their adjustment to captivity. Red-capped Parrots always remain
very timid and their aviaries should have well secluded shelters into
which they are able to retreat.
Considering the feeding habits of this parrot in its natural state, the
special attention given to the diet of captive birds will be well appre-
ciated. Variety is the key to success in this sphere and experimentation

will assist in the maintaining of health of the birds. A well balanced
diet of seeds, fruits and green food is necessary. A mixture of plain
canary seed, sunflower seed and oats in the proportions of 2:1:1
is most satisfactory. This should be supplemented by a daily supply of
apples, oranges and other fruits, lettuce, chickweed, or spinach and
cuttlefish or grit. Berries such as Hawthorn or Pyracantha are relished
by the birds and should be given as frequently as possible. Plain cake
soaked in milk is very beneficial when there are young in the nest.
Finally a branch of Eucalyptus or another suitable tree should be
always available. This enables the birds to chew the leaves and stems
thus providing much nourishment as well as combating boredom.
If successful breeding is to be accomplished each pair of Red-capped
Parrots should be placed in a separate flight aviary not in close proxi-
mity to aviaries containing other pairs or non-breeding individuals.
Two or three nesting logs or boxes should be provided thus allowing
the birds to choose their own nesting site. As soon as nesting has com-
menced disturbance should be kept to an absolute minimum. Second
broods should not be encouraged because this could detract from the
care given to the newly fledged young by the parents and may
jeopardize a successful breeding of this difficult species.
As is to be expected no records of naturally occurring hybrids
involving Purpureicephalus spurius exist. However, reliable accounts of
hybrids in captivity have been published. A Red-capped Parrot mated
to a Western Rosella ( Platycercus icterotis) reared two young in the U.S.A.
in 1929. The young produced by mating with a female Crimson Rosella
(.Platycercus elegans ) were hand reared in 1958. The plumage of these
offspring was predominently green on the back with red markings on
the head and rump, blue segments on the flight primaries and the
typical blue ear-coverts of P. elegans. The breast was dull violet-grey
with a red spot on the abdomen, while the bill was that of a typical
Purpureicephalus .
Undoubtedly one of the most rewarding sights for the ornithologist
visiting the timbered areas of south-western Australia is provided by
the Red-capped Parrots as they fly through the tree tops displaying
their brilliant plumage. As the birds are observed feeding on the seeds
of the Marri or drinking at the tanks and stock watering troughs, the
good fortune of the inhabitants of the region in having in their midst
this, one of the beautiful parrots of the world, is fully appreciated.
Purpureicephalus spurius is truly a magnificent member of an ancient and
regal group of birds.

Lalocitta lidthi (Bonaparte)
By Thomas C. Oliver (Head Keeper of Birds,
Paignton Zoological and Botanical Gardens)
A Loo Choo Jay (.Lalocitta lidthi ) was hatched on 24th April, 1964,
in the Paignton Zoological Gardens. Its parents were part of a lot of
four imported from dealers in Kobe, Japan, on 28th August, 1962.
It was hatched in an aviary approximately 12x12x12 feet high
with an inside flight of about 9x6x12 feet high. The parents chose
to nest in a recess in the outside flight. The nest was built of small
sticks, lined with dried moss and camel hair. We also gave them
mud, but they did not use it. Both the cock and hen helped to build
the nest.
When the nest was finished the cock became very fierce, and the
hen very timid. Up till this time they were quite tame. We do not
know the exact incubation period.
The only foods observed being given to the young Jay by the adults
while in the nest were live foods, i.e. maggots, mealworms, and an
occasional small spider.
At the age of four weeks the young bird left the nest. Its head and
breast were a dull grey-blue in colour. Back, flanks, and belly a dull
brown, and wings blue. Because of the uncertain weather conditions,
plus the fact that the nest was in a difficult position relating to perches,
we separated the youngster from its parents and hand-reared it.
At six weeks of age it started feeding itself first only on live food and
after a few days on fine chopped meat, hard-boiled eggs, and finely-
chopped mixed fruit, and Sluis with one or two mealworms per day.
At about ten weeks old it started to gain its mature plumage.
As described above, the Loo Choo or Lidth's Jay (Lalocitta lidthi
(Bonaparte)) has been bred at the Paignton Zoological Gardens. It is
believed that this may be a first success.
Any member or reader knowing of a previous breeding of this
species in Great Britain or Northern Ireland is requested to communi-
cate at once with the Hon. Secretary.

smaller one was to be the hen. However, the following records will
clarify this subject.
1961.
In 1961 the larger bird laid four eggs and incubated them for the
complete three weeks, but alas no results. " Well done cock P.L."
1962.
This year to my amazement both birds laid four eggs each in the
same nest-box and during the incubation period no bickering was
noted, although these birds were sharing the box, side by side.
1963-
The 1963 procedure was the same as for 1962 for the parrakeets,
but this time a certain amount of jealousy arose as to who should have
the nest-box.
1964.
In March this year, I managed to obtain a cock ; this was paired
to the large hen, the other being moved to the adjoining aviary. On
6th April, the first egg was laid and by the 12th three more had been
added. After fourteen days these were found to be clear, but complete
incubation time was allowed for the hen.
On 24th May, I decided to remove the nest-box from the pen and
I was surprised to find five eggs, one of which seemed to be newly laid.
Two old eggs were removed and the nest-box replaced. On 26th May
another egg was laid and the remaining two old eggs were also
removed. On 28th May, the nest consisted of three eggs and from this
date the hen incubated with severe loyalty and was only seen on very
rare occasions.
On 18th June two young were seen and these had a smoky grey-
green down, a colour difficult to describe. Inspection was carried out
from time to time, but still only the two youngsters were seen, which by
26th July had left the nest in perfect plumage, with another bird to my
joy in the same condition, on 28th July.
These young were very sturdy and fully coloured, identical to the
mother, in fact to distinguish them is a very difficult task. They are
now progressing soundly and feeding on their own.
Interesting points noted are as follows:--
(1) Either before or just after the first egg was laid, pebbles were
carried into the next-box, the routine being one egg, one pebble,
two eggs, two pebbles, but after the third egg was laid the pebbles
could not be found ; this happened consistently also, during the
previous years.

sions of colour are quite distinct, unlike the cock.
My other successes for 1964 are Redrumps, ten consisting of Yellow
and normals, seventeen Turquosines, twenty-one Bourke's.
My two 1963 pairs of Stanleys made no attempt at all of going to
nest, also an additional pair of Turquosines showed the same disinterest
and my Blue-bonnets once again bobbed but got no further.
Altogether, this season has given me great pleasure and satisfaction.
Note. --27th October, 1964. These Port Lincolns are in perfect health
and condition and have turned out to be one cock and two hens.
Sexing is much easier when young of both sexes are together.

BREEDING THE RED-EYED BULBUL
By Charles Everitt (Trenton, N.J., U.S.A.)
It was in August i960 that a pair of Bulbuls was received by
</table>
<bodyText confidence="0.990361523809524" page_id="56317937"  page_num="214" year="" vol="">
Mr. Boehm from one of his East African contacts. They were not too
large, about 8 inches in total length, and were soon identified as the
Red-eyed Bulbul-- Pycnonotus nigricans. They have a fairly extensive
range in their native land, selecting the dry inland areas from the
eastern parts of South Africa, Cape Province, and Transvaal, through
Bechuanaland into great Namaqualand, Damaraland, and Ovampo-
land, all in South West Africa, to as far north as the Cubango and
Cuando districts of Angola, their line of habitat apparently following
the Kalahari Desert up to the Kaukau Veldt.
So far as general coloration is concerned, the sexes are alike, but the
female is slightly smaller. Another sex difference is in the song, both
having clear, cheerful, liquid notes, those of the male having a slightly
wider range. Their distinctive feature is a red wattle around the eye,
their feather colouring being rather on the sombre side. The upper
plumage, from the nape of the neck through to the tail, is a dark
greenish-brown. The head, face, neck, and throat are dark brown.
The upper chest is of the same colour as the upper parts, this blending
in with the dark brown of the throat. The abdomen is greyish-white,
flecked with brown, the under tail-coverts and vent feathers being
yellow. The iris is orange to reddish-brown, the bill, legs, and feet
being black.

After the customary time for new arrivals in the cage room, they
were released into a planted aviary of some 60 by 20 feet, late in
September i960. Here they settled down well with the other inmates
which included Spreo and Royal Starlings, Scarlet Cocks of the Rock,
Olive-flanked Robin Chats and Variegated Tits. Although there were
nestings by other species, the Bulbuls made no such move during the
following season. However, on 27th June, 1962, we were surprised by
the sight of two fledglings, obviously Red-eyed Bulbuls. They were
perching in a clump of cultivated honeysuckle and the parent birds
did not appear to be at all perturbed at our study of the young birds.
Although an extensive search was made of the trees, shrubs, and bushes,
no trace of their nest was found. Unfortunately, they were not to be
reared to independence for one was killed five days later, and the other
the next day. It is not known who was, or were as the case may be, the
killer, as there had been no signs of belligerence among the birds and
such a state of content appears to continue to exist, even though new
species in the form of Joyful Bulbuls, Hume's Mynas, and Plumbeous
Redstarts have since been introduced.
The fact that the adult Red-eyed Bulbuls, now known to be a true
pair, were still with us was some consolation, but no further broods
were raised that year. It was in April, 1963, that they were seen to be
constructing a nest of Spanish moss, grasses, and fibres in one of the
topmost branches of a crab-apple tree. It was only about 9 inches below
the curved wire roof which, at that time, was still covered with
visqueen, a clear plastic sheeting. As this most probably had deterior-
ated during the winter and was liable to let in the rain, a plywood cover
was fitted above the nest after the first egg had been laid. The nest
itself was an open cup, circular, with a central depression of about
2 inches and both birds had participated in the building of it.
The first egg, pinkish-white, copiously marked with reddish-brown
spots and flecks, and measuring about 21 by 15 mm., was laid on
20th April, with a second the following day. The incubation, which was
shared, lasted for twelve to thirteen days and appeared to commence
with the laying of the first egg. I use the term appeared for, on the
morning inspection of the nest on 3rd May, two nestlings were found.
One obviously had just hatched as it was smaller than the other and
there was still a piece of eggshell in the nest. It was customary to look
into the nest only once each day for, not only did it entail climbing the
tree, a delicate task in itself, but also we did not wish to disturb the
sitting birds more than necessary for general observation purposes.
The nestlings were devoid of all body covering and had bright pink
gapes. Their eyes were open at five days old and quills were showing in
their wings. By a further five days they were almost fully feathered,
being dark greenish-brown above with darker heads. On 15th May, at
twelve to thirteen days old, they vacated the nest and were exact

replicas of the two fledglings seen the previous year. The upper
plumage was dark greenish-brown, as with the adults, the head, face,
and neck being darker. The under-parts were a composite of clear
yellowish-greyish-white with no fleckings. There was complete
absence of any coloured eye-ring. Two weeks after vacating the nest
they were feeding themselves although still not averse to accepting
anything offered to them by their parents. Four days later they were
caught up and placed on their own so as to avoid any repetition of the
prior loss. By ist July, yellowish-white eye-rings were discernible, these
gradually changing to pink by the end of the month. Now at eight
months old, they have the same colouring throughout as the adult
birds and, judging by their song and behaviour, it may well be that they
are a natural pair.
The parents reared a second round in July but, in this instance, only
one left the nest and was reared to maturity. They had selected a fresh
site for this nesting, at the extreme top of a tree on the other side of
the aviary. It was completely inaccessible to us from the ground, or
from above, so no knowledge could be gained as to the number of eggs
etc. This third young Red-eyed Bulbul followed the same development
pattern as the older two up to the time it was donated to the Chicago
Zoo in November, 1963.
One of the parent birds has since been killed, but it is hoped to be
able to make up a true pair, for the 1964 breeding season, out of the
two yearling birds and the surviving adult, which is, we think, the
female. I have not been able to find any previous detailed report of the
breeding of this species and any information on this would be most
welcome.

One of the less frequently imported, and yet one of the most striking
in appearance, the Golden-crested Myna --Mino coronatus, also classi-
fied by authorities in the genus Ampeliceps --is fairly common in northern
Thailand, is a resident of the Tenasserim district of Burma, and may
also be found, in smaller numbers, in Laos, Vietnam, and the Malay
Peninsula.
About 8^ inches in total length, the adult male has clear yellow
feathering on the crown of the head, the face, chin, throat, and in a
broad wing patch. The long crest, lying flat on the head, also is yellow.
Further, there is a bare patch of yellow skin around the eye. The bill
is bright orange, the legs and feet being of the same colour, but duller.
The remainder of the plumage is glossy black. The female is very

under parts is confined to the chin, the throat being black. In addition,
the group of yellow bristly feathers at the base of the upper mandible
is not as distinct as that of the male.
A pair of these birds were received by Mr. Boehm from Burma in
April, 1962, and, after an adequate time in a reception pen for
acclimatisation, were released into a planted aviary in August of the
same year. Sharing this accommodation with a pair each of Striped
Kingfishers and Natal Robins, they settled down well in their new
surroundings, their diet consisting of chopped, mixed fruits, a soft-food
mixture, and ground raw beef. To this was added a liberal supply
daily of mealworms for, like all Grackles, they are avid insect eaters.
Although tree stumps with natural nesting holes were positioned in
the aviary, as an additional inducement to nest, a covered box,
18 inches high by 9 inches square, with a 2^-inch entrance hole in the
front, near the top, was secured in there also at about 8 feet above
ground level. It was in May, 1963, that the female was seen to be
taking pieces of twig, coarse grass, and fresh leaves into this box.
Three eggs were laid, the first on 10th May, but they all proved to be
clear so were used to obtain the following data. Averaging in measure-
ment 32 by 19 mm., they were pale blue with, on two of them, a few
fine, brown markings, mainly at the thicker end, the third being a
perfectly clear pale blue.
On 24th June, she laid again, once more a clutch of three, of which
one was completely unmarked. Although the incubation, lasting for
fourteen days, appeared to have been by the female only, I cannot be
sure on this point as the sitting bird vacated the nest at the first sound
of any approaching footsteps. However, I do assume it was a feminine
task entirely for, whilst in an adjoining aviary, the only bird I ever saw
to enter or leave the nest-box during the incubation period was the
female. One egg fully hatched on 8th July, but, although the other
eggs were fertile, and contained live chicks that started to cut their way
out, the female discarded these eggs from the nest and concentrated
on rearing the one solitary nestling.
It was completely devoid of any body fluff, had a bright pink, bare
skin, with a yellow gape, margined in orange-yellow. The male now
began to enter the nest, for the rearing, mainly with live-food for the
first seven days or so, was shared. Although the eyes were open at six
days, only dark markings could be seen under the skin and it was not
until about the eleventh day that quill feathers were visible. It has been
said that the young of Golden-crested Mynas have all-black heads, but
such was not the case with this particular nestling for, at eighteen days
old, yellow feathering was showing on the brow. Vacating the nest at
twenty-three days, it had the beginnings of a distinct yellow cap, a
yellow chin patch, and pale yellow barrings in the wings.
Independence was gained at five weeks old and all three birds lived

congenially together for a further six months. By that time it was
apparent that the young bird was a male, and as the adult of the same
sex began to chase it away from the feeding stand, it was removed to
one of the stock pens. Within a further two weeks the female had laid
again, two eggs only this time, both clear.
As this first breeding has turned out to be a male, careful observation
will be kept on any future young so as to determine if there is any
difference in the fledgling feathering of the sexes, that is, of course,
if we are fortunate enough to produce a female.
Note .--Six young, three of each sex, were raised in 1964.

(Otis tarda)
By Dr. Wolfgang Gewalt (West Berlin Zoo, Germany)
In Vol. 68, No. 5, of this Magazine we recorded our efforts in
breeding Great Bustards in captivity. We had three chicks in the 1962
and five chicks in the 1963 breeding season which hatched out from
some eggs laid in the West Berlin Zoo Bustard enclosure, but it was
impossible to keep them alive for more than five days. Whether the
young ones were hand-reared or fed by their natural mother, the
unsatisfying result was the same.
In 1964 our flock of Great Bustards consisted of three males (8, 2,
and 1 years old) and of eight females (12, 10, 8, 4, 4, 1, 1, and 1 years
old). Most of them were hand-reared from eggs found in the wild.
The birds live in a grassy enclosure measuring 1,000 square metres in
which are some trees and bushes. On the visitors' side, the paddock is
protected by a hedge. During cold or rainy weather the Bustards can
be driven into a stable divided into single boxes.
Unfortunately at the beginning of the 1964 laying period a mature
female was killed by a cock and a second female we lost due to indiges-
tion. Only eight eggs were laid in the shallow sandy nests, and as usual, !
put under sitting domestic hens. The chief cock carried out a wonderful j
display all the time and was extraordinarily aggressive. After an
incubation period of between twenty-two and twenty-three days only
three chicks hatched out. In one egg the embryo died, the others were !
infertile. The chicks weighed 75 to 80 grammes, rather less than free-born
young which weigh up to 100 grammes and more. The first chick
hatched died at seven days old from gut blockage and stomach over-
loading. Like young Cranes, the Bustard chicks do not eat inde- |

means of forceps with grasshoppers and other live insects, small pieces
of meat, boiled potatoes, and chickweed leaves. The remaining two
chicks, born on 7th and 8th June, 1964, did well. Surviving the first
ten critical days in an infra-red-heated box, as usual carefully supplied
with vitamins and the important manganese (manganese prevents the
deforming leg weakness/slipped tendon), they progressed well right up
to now. On 20th July, 1964, their weight was 1,850 and 1,100 grammes.
As far as we know this should be the first complete success in zoo-
breeding Great Bustards in the world.

The 1964 breeding season at the West Berlin Zoo has again been a
very successful one.
The most remarkable results were achieved in our Pelican breeding
colony. As in former years some birds built nests and made breeding
attempts in late April, but this time an egg was discovered in May in the
nest of our pair of American White Pelicans (Pelecanus erythrorhynchus).
Brooding in turn both birds defended their nest violently against other
Pelicans making nesting attempts in the colony. The nest was situated
on a platform about 10 inches above the water level, on a small island
in the neighbourhood of a cormorant breeding colony, at a distance of
about 30 feet from the visitors. On 19th June the young one hatched.
Compared with its swan-sized parents it was amazingly small, but
during the next weeks it grew up very rapidly. After a few days it was
covered with snowy-white down plumage, and on 18th June the black
pinions appeared. After six weeks the young had nearly reached the

size of a goose and was leaving the nest for greater excursions, still
jealously protected by its parents. On 6th August it went into the water
for the first time, swimming perfectly. Now at an age of three months,
the young one is hardly distinguishable from the adults. Only the bill
is smaller and bill and feet are paler than those of the parents.
At the beginning of July other Pelican species (P. onocrotalus , P. cris-
pus, P. rufescens) also built their nests on the platform and were sitting
on eggs. They were partly mixed pairs, e.g. P. onocrotalus X P. rufescens
and P. crispus X P. rufescens. At the same time two young cormorants
hatched. On ioth August a young one was discovered in the nest of a
pair of European White Pelicans (P. onocrotalus) being of the same size
as the young P. erythrorhynchus was. It grew up in the same way, but was
covered with a blackish down plumage and was quite different in its
appearance. It is still doing well.
All the other Pelican eggs did not develop and were lost after some
time.
Breeding Pelicans in captivity is still a rare event. While European
White Pelicans had been bred at the zoo of Rotterdam by the end of
the last century, at the Basle Zoo in 1930, and four times at the Tierpark
Berlin-Friedrichsfelde in 1961-63, this is to the best of our knowledge
the first rearing of an American White Pelican in a European zoo.
At the National Zoological Park, Washington, D.C., American White
Pelicans hatched in 1914, 1928, 1930, and 1931, and a P. erythrorhyn-
chus X occidentalis hybrid, hatched in 1934 and lived in the Zoo until
1943. To our knowledge pelicans have also been bred at the San
Antonio Zoo, Texas, but we have no records of it.
In our Flamingo colony, 1963 the first young flamingo in Germany,
a Phoenicopterus ruber roseus, had been reared (see Avicult. Mag.,
Vol. 69, 6, 1963), between 30th April and 6th June, 1964, altogether
twelve Chilean and eight European Flamingo eggs had been laid. At
most eighteen birds were sitting on eggs at the same time. There were
three main parts of the colony, two of them consisting of Chileans and
one of Europeans. Flowever, all the eggs did not develop. Some of them
disappeared after some time, but most were secured after being-
incubated for too long, and proved to be infertile. On 31st July one
chilensis and two roseus eggs were laid and two other eggs were found in
the water. At the beginning of August three pairs of roseus and one pair
of chilensis were again sitting persistently on eggs. On 28th August, the
first European Flamingo chicken hatched and on 7th September the
second. Both chicks are doing well, being now three and two weeks old,
but on account of the very cold and rainy autumn weather it must be
feared that they will not survive.
A lot of interesting birds have hatched in our incubators and were
reared artificially by our head-keeper, Mrs. Johst, among them six
Rheas, one Paradise Crane, one Black-backed Radjah Shelduck (to our

Our successful breeding pair of Snowy Owls, which have been in the
Zoo since 1958 and 1959, again reared four young ones. A report on the
first successful breeding of Great Bustards in captivity is published in
this issue of the Avicultural Magazine. In the large walk-through
aviary of our Bird House the Rufous-winged Kiskadees (.Pitangus
sulfuratus) successfully reared two young ones. A Red-eared Bulbul
hatched on 28th June, but was killed by other birds, probably by the
Drongos or Kiskadees. The great Crowned Pigeons, which had reared
a young one in March, 1964, in the walk-through aviary, were sitting
on an egg again in August. The young one hatched on 30th August, but
unfortunately died one day later by falling out of the nest.
In the Pheasantry the first young Brush Turkey in the Berlin Zoo
since the war came out of the large breeding mound, erected by the
cock. It was self-supporting and able to flutter about from the first
moment of its life.
Among the many new arrivals the following may be worth men-
tioning : one Brown Pelican, four Blue-winged Teals, ten Brent Geese,
two Common Sun Bitterns, two Pheasant-tailed Jacanas, one Great
Bustard (an adult male, found at night in a stadium in the centre of the
city), seven American Flamingos, one Bittern, two Squacco Herons, two
Black-headed Herons, one Great White Heron, four Little Egrets,
two Spoonbills, one American Wood Ibis, four Indian Painted Storks,
two Crested Wood Partridges, four Palawan Peacock Pheasants, two

Eagle, two Malayan Scops Owls, one Red-crested Cockatoo, two
Hyacinthine Macaws, two Senegal Parrots, one Violet-crested Turaco,
two Green-billed Toucans, two Black Hornbills (Anthracoceros malayanus)
nine Hummingbirds of different species, one female Peruvian Cock of

222 W. GRUMMT-BREEDING THE AFRICAN CATTLE EGRET
SOME NOTES ON THE BREEDING OF THE
AFRICAN CATTLE EGRET
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.989080380952381" page_id="56317947"  page_num="222" year="" vol="">
By Wolfgang Grummt (Tierpark Berlin-Friedrichsfelde, Germany)
Yealland has described the successful breeding of the African Cattle
Egret (. Ardeolai . ibis) in Regents Park (Avicult. Mag., Vol. 70, 21-22).
In 1958 the Berlin Tierpark received thirty-two Cattle Egrets, all
young birds, from Cairo of which four died soon after arrival. In 1959
the birds were placed in the new heron aviary, the outside flight of which
is 13 by 10 metres and 6 metres high and the smaller inside flight
6 * 20 by 3 * 85 metres and 3 * 6 metres high. In the outside flight there are
three trees for nests and the ground is covered with grass with a small
area of sand and a pool of water.
In addition to the Cattle Egrets there were also the following species
in the aviary : Chinese Pond Herons ( Ardeola bacchus ), Squacco Herons
(A. ralloides ), Little Egrets (Egretta garzetta), Snowy Egrets ( Leucophoyx
thula ), Boat-bill Herons ( Cochlearius cochlearius) , Scarlet Ibis ( Eudocimus
ruber) and Glossy Ibis ( Plegadis falcinellus) . In addition there were a few
waders such as Curlew, Whimbrel, Grey and Golden Plovers, Lapwings,
Ruffs, and Avocets.
In winter only the Cattle, Little, and Snowy Egrets were left in the
aviary while the other birds were placed elsewhere.
A few pairs of Cattle Egrets already started building nests in the
winter of 1959-60. In the relatively narrow aviary there were naturally
continual disputes for nesting material and nesting sites. On 8th March,
i960, the first pair laid and by the end of that month six pairs had full
clutches of two to three eggs. At the beginning of April the first nests
were built in the outer flight and there were soon some clutches here
also. On 31st March the first egg hatched. So far as we could establish
in i960 altogether forty-two Cattle Egrets hatched of which thirty-two
youngsters were reared. By 1963, ninety-four Cattle Egrets had fledged
and in February, 1964, there were already seven half-fledged birds in
nests in addition to several brooding pairs.
So far egg-laying has taken place from December to August, chiefly
from January to June. Full clutches usually consist of three to four
eggs and only once was there a clutch of two eggs, but possibly
in this case an egg was broken or fell out of the nest. Of sixty-four
clutches kept under observation, fifty-four contained three eggs each,
nine, four eggs and in only one clutch was there two eggs. Laying took
place at intervals of two days and as the adults began brooding after
the laying of the first egg the young also hatched out at intervals of two
days. Incubation lasted from twenty-three to twenty-four days and
sometimes one or two eggs were infertile. It often happened that the
young last hatched died during the first few days. In fifty-two successful
broods kept under observation the number of young hatched amounted

in twenty-nine cases to two young, sixteen times three young, twice
four young, and five times one young. Four young in a nest never
fledged. Once a young bird of four days old lay dead under the nest
while the remaining three fledged. In the second nest with four young,
one also died. Of 119 chicks hatched, a total of ninety-four fledged,
that is 79 per cent. The observation of the nests was chiefly carried out
by Keeper G. Graunke.
In 1961 a male Snowy Egret paired with a female Little Egret and
hatched two young which were successfully reared. In 1963 Little
Egrets were also successfully reared. Glossy Ibis also bred for several
years, but unfortunately the young died before they fledged.
The Egrets were fed as follows : to the basic food which consists
of soft Pheasant food crushed shrimps were added and in addition
both raw and cooked meat were mixed in. Fish was either cut into
small pieces or minced in the meat-mincer and mixed with the basic food.
As soon as the young Cattle Egrets were hatched they were also fed with
mealworms and ants 5 eggs. In the warm period of the year the Cattle
Egrets fed their young with many insects especially flies which they
caught themselves. As at the beginning of winter these birds often show
a Vitamin B deficiency so Vitamin B Complex is added to the food.
African Cattle Egrets have also been regularly and successfully
reared at the Biological Station Wilhelminenberg. According to infor-
mation in the International Z 00 Tear Book, Vols. II and III (i960, 1961),
they have also been reared at the Jerez (Spain) and Paris zoos. Indian
Cattle Egrets have been bred and reared several times in recent years
in the Dresden Zoo.

It was bred at the London Zoo in 1904, for the first time in Europe.
Three young were hatched ; one was trodden on and killed by one of
its parents the same day that it was hatched, but the other two were
fully reared. Four more were bred in 1905, two in 1906, and one in
1913. In the last year three were hatched but two were crushed by the
parents. Jean Delacour reared one young one, of four hatched, in 1922.

J. D. Money, Agent, Leeds Castle, Maidstone, reports a cross
between a White-headed Nun and a Chestnut-breasted Finch. He
writes : " The White-headed Nun appears to be the male parent.
The pair laid two batches of eggs. From the first they hatched and
reared three. The second lot of babies had to be brought up under
Bengalese, and there are three of these. This was owing to the fact that
we had to empty the aviary due to overcrowding ". This would appear
to be the first time this hybrid has been recorded for Great Britain.
Page, Butler, and Neunzig all give the cross Chestnut Finch X Maja
as having been bred both ways abroad.

According to the Fifteenth Annual Report of the Wildfowl Trust , 1962-63.
the world population of the Hawaiian Goose in January was between
380 and 430 : 250 to 300 in Hawaii, 84 in England, 22 in Europe, and
29 in North America. The results of the rearing programme at
Slimbridge were disappointing ; from 120 eggs only twenty goslings
were hatched, of which sixteen were reared.

The colony of Night Herons in the Scottish National Zoological
Park, Edinburgh, continues to maintain its numbers at about forty
birds. The Director-Secretary, G. D. Fisher, writes in the Report :
" Five nests were again occupied. ... So far as could be ascertained
the broods of these nests were all successfully reared, adding approxi-
mately fifteen young birds to the colony's strength. As this appears to
remain the same, it is indicated that the number of deaths among adult
birds equals the number of young birds hatched and reared ; and as
dead birds are not found within the Park it is assumed that the older
herons succumb during their nocturnal visits to more distant feeding
grounds in the surrounding countryside. "

Newton Capron, Lake Worth, Florida, reports : " This year was in
some respects a poor year for breeding results, with a few exceptions.
I raised three lovely blue Ringnecks to the age of three months, only
to lose one of them from a broken neck.
Australian Kings did quite well as far as eggs went, but neither of
the hens would sit. So between three pairs and a single hen--all
Princess of Wales--seven were hatched and six hand-raised. They are
delightfully tame. Of the six, one has salmon, instead of red, under
colouring (it looks now as if the salmon is being replaced by red),
another had a very few red feathers on the forehead, and still another
shows the light wing-bars as in the mature male ".

Ornithology. By James Fisher and Roger Tory Peterson.
Macdonald and Co. (Publishers), Ltd., London, 1964. Price
5 guineas net.
This is certainly the most comprehensive guide to general ornithology
that has yet been published and contains a wealth of information on
every conceivable aspect of the subject. Both the authors are ornitho-
logists of international repute and the amount of knowledge and
industry that has gone into the production of this book is astounding.
There are many original ideas and treatments such as the descriptions,
diagrams, and illustrations on Distribution and Bird Variety ; Birds
on the Tree of Life (including a family tree, and relationship) ;
Distribution of Birds (including altitudinal zonation, population, and
changing numbers), to mention only a few.
The section entitled The Regiment of Birds, with maps of the
families, is outstanding. Aviculture is dealt with in the chapter on
Birds and Men and is confined to tracing the rise of aviculture from
the time of ancient Egypt and references in general terms to present-
day activities. A list of the oldest surviving zoos with the date of their
foundation is included.
Roger Tory Peterson's superb illustrations have been very well
reproduced and the set-out of the book is beautifully designed. The
most difficult thing to understand is how the publishers were able to
put this book on the market for the low price of 5 guineas !

This is the fifth of a series of excellent books. In his preface
Mr. Harrison says : " We have come to realize that the egg is not
merely a dry and empty shell that looks rather nice arranged on a layer
of cotton wool. The egg is a living thing, produced by a living bird,
cared for by it, and the thing from which, in a short time, a living
bird will emerge." This is the fundamental approach of this sympa-
thetic and charmingly written book of six chapters--Why an Egg ;
The Nest, its Evolution and Usefulness ; The Structure of the Egg ;
The Egg in the Nest ; The Egg as a Living Thing ; Eggs and Man.
Mr. Harrison imparts a great deal of information in a most readable
way and the book is well illustrated with excellent photographs, the
majority of them by Eric Hosking. Aviculturists, most of whose main
object is to secure successful emergence from eggs, will want this book
(even if they are not young ornithologists) which is written by a fellow
aviculturist. P. B.-S.

Breeding the Red-billed Weaver (Quelea quelea ).
This year we have bred the Red-billed Weaver (Quelea quelea ).
The Weavers are kept in a long flight aviary with a shelter at one end. In this
aviary we exhibit twenty-five species of birds, including five species of Weaver. The
four Red-billed Weavers arrived in September, 1961, and many nests have been built
by them and a few eggs laid, but these were usually destroyed by other birds.
Following our usual practice the birds were disturbed as little as possible and a
young Red-billed Weaver was first heard calling for food about 10th July, 1964. On
16th July one egg was removed from the nest--it was a bluish-green colour with small
brown markings. Other species of weavers as well as both parents were seen to feed the
young one, especially the Rufous-necked. In addition to the usual seed mixture and
green food, live food was fed to the parents. This was regurgitated for the young
bird, the adult clinging upside down onto the nest. The young Weaver called loudly
while being fed. It resembles the female in colour and left the nest about 22nd July and
has now settled down well with the others.

THE PORT LINCOLN PARROT
</figure>
<bodyText confidence="0.994144181818182" page_id="56317956"  page_num="229" year="" vol="">
The weaknesses in the trend of subjugating acknowledged species to sub-species
(especially those easily identified in the field by the most inexpert observer) is graphi-
cally demonstrated in the otherwise excellent articles of Joseph M. Forshaw when, in
the March-April, 1964, Avicultural Magazine, he attempts to describe in detail,
two very different birds in one fell swoop.
A feather by feather description of the bird so well known to ornithologists and
aviculturists as the Port Lincoln Parrot just does not apply to the vastly bigger and
quite differently coloured birds we know as Twenty-Eights, nor would an intelligent
description of the latter apply to the Port Lincoln.
From this emerges one of two things : any description of the black-headed members
of the genus Barnardius is superfluous when applied en globo or two valid species exist.
