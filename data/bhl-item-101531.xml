Excalfadoria chinensis, Linn.
By Arthur G. Butler, Ph.D.
This pretty little species occurs in many parts of India,
Burma, Ceylon, China, the Philippines, Malaysia and southwards
to Australia : the Rev. G. Brown also obtained it in the islands
of the Duke of York group.
It will be unnecessary to give a description of the
plumage, the beauty of which has earned it several trivial
names : that by which it has long been known to scientists is
&amp;quot; the Blue-breasted Quail ;&amp;quot; to aviculturists however it is best
known by the title employed above.
Respecting the wild life of the species, as observed by
him in India, Jerdon says, -- &amp;quot; In lyower Bengal it is tolerably
abundant in damp grassy meadows, the edges of Indigo fields,
and in the grass on road-sides : and in Purneah, in the month of
July, it was the only Quail I observed. It breeds in this month,
the eggs being pale olive-green. When the young are full grown
they disperse all over the country, and this dispersion is greatly
assisted, and in many parts, perhaps, caused by the heavy
inundations to which a great part of the country in Bengal is
annually subjedted, generally in August or September.&amp;quot;
Speaking of the species in Ceylon (Proc. Zool. Soc, 1872),
Mr. K. W. H. Holdsworth says : -- &amp;quot; I have seen this bird from
Kandy and the cinnamon-gardens at Colombo ; and Layard says
it is common in the south.&amp;quot; Governor Ussher notes it in Borneo
(Proc. Zool. Soc, 1879) as tolerably plentiful in open spaces in
short thick grass ; it is met with up to May or the beginning of
June in little bevies ; after that I observed them in pairs. They
are of rapid flight, and are hard to flush a second time.&amp;quot; Dr.
Sharpe (loc. cit.) describes the eggs, sent by Mr. Low, as varying
from dark olive-brown with few black dots, to pale olive-brown

where the black dots are more numerous.&amp;quot; Mr. L,ow obtained
them in January, 1873, and he states that the native name of the
species is &amp;quot; Burong puyu puyu.&amp;quot;
Dr. Russ informs us that since 1870, single pairs of the
Chinese Quail have been occasionally imported ; that it is much
sought after for the bird-room, and has on several occasions been
bred ; that according to Mr. E. Berin, who indeed was the
first to breed it, it is shy and timid, needs a place of retirement,,
one of which he provided in the form of a straw covering
leaning against the back wall of the cage or bird-room. &amp;quot; At
the breeding- season the male and female are continually
together, the former being gentle and watchful ; both build the
nest ; every disturbance is to be avoided.
From the experience of this and other breeders, Dr. Russ
gathers that the laying consists of from four to seven clear
brownish, generally dark dotted eggs. Incubation lasts from
sixteen to eighteen daj^s. The nestling-down is yellowish, and
the young acquire their full colouring when three months old.
Early in the present year, a good many pairs of this Quail
came into the Eondon market, and were offered to the public at
prices even lower than those noted by Dr. Russ. Two pairs were
offered to me, and I was so delighted with the colouring of these
quaint little things that I gladl)^ added them to my collection.
My experience has not altogether coincided with that of Mr.
Berin, as I shall now show.
When first introduced into a tolerably large aviary I found
the Chinese Quails exceedingly nervous, so that when I entered
the aviary they would fly recklessly upwards, striking their
heads against the wire netting under the glass roofing and
falling heavily to the earth ; but no sooner did they perceive
that my intentions were never hostile, than they contented
themselves with merelj&amp;apos;- running out of my way or leaping in a
surprising manner to a raised bank of earth, bounded in front by
a wall nearly two feet high from the sanded floor.
At one end of the bank above noted, I provicled a place of
retirement by sticking a row of fir-twigs into the earth about six
inches from the back wall : behind this partial screen the Quails
often sat down during the day-time, sometimes scratching a
shallow depression in the soil and dragging in a little hay and
a few feathers ; but at other times they settled down all together
in an open corner of the aviary upon the sand, and at night
they frequently went to roost in another open corner upon a
cemented wall.
</bodyText>
<bodyText confidence="0.97426688" page_id="32635436"  page_num="3" year="" vol="">
At tlie present time my Quails are quite tame and
confiding, wandering about like young chicken, running to
seize cockroaches or spiders when thrown into the aviary, and
clambering into a demon beetle-trap to pick out the insedts if it
is placed upon the floor. They now never fly, but often stretcH
their bodies and flap their wings.
The note of these birds is very faint and I am never quite
sure, when I hear it, that it is not a muttered observation of
some other of my feathered family; but, on one occasion -- and
only one -- whilst watching one of the cock birds, I saw him
stretch himself and utter the tiniest and most ridiculous little
crow conceivable. &amp;apos;&amp;quot;*&amp;apos;
On several occasions, when hay and feathers have been
dragged together and roughly moulded into a vague kind of
saucer, I have hoped that my Quails were preparing to breed,
but no eggs have ever been produced.
Although I have never seen the slightest approach towards
quarrelling on the part of my two pairs, one circumstance has
rather annoyed me. A hen of one of the pairs, when first
purchased had the crown of the head quite bare, and the other
birds seem to regard it as a solemn duty not to permit this
unfortunate lady ever to retain a covering upon her head ;
indeed they recently denuded her of feathers down to the back
of her neck.f
THE SMALLER WARBLERS AS AVIARY BIRDS.

Among the many avicultural experiences upon which I
can look back with pleasure and satisfaction there are a few
which I can now only recall with feelings of regret and disap-
pointment. Among these last unfortunate episodes is my
attempt (made many years ago) to keep some of our tiny British
Warblers in my aviary. In our Magazine we have frequent
records of success ; perhaps, for a change, some readers will
bear, for once in a while, with a tale of failure.
I had seen a beautiful specimen of the Willow Wren at a
Bird Show, and I was fired with the ambition to possess one like
it, and eventually, in spite of warnings from more experienced
friends, I made up my mind to &amp;quot;go in &amp;quot; for the smaller Warblers.
It was the autumn, when such birds are obtainable, and I got

together, from various sources, two or three Willow Wrens, a
ChifF-chaff, and a couple of Sedge Warblers -- one of these last
being sold to me as a Reed Warbler (a common mistake, by the
way).
Some of these little birds seemed in poor condition when
I received them, while others were, apparently, quite healthy, but
I hoped that they would all improve under my care. They took
kindly to the food provided, which was, I still think, the best I
could give them, viz., soaked ants&amp;apos; eggs, hard boiled egg, and
grated carrot, mixed together with a few bread crumbs ; milk
sop ; and a liberal supply of mealworms. But instead of
improving they went from bad to worse ; one or two died
suddenly, falling from the perch in a fit ; but most of them went
into what seemed like a rapid decline, becoming quickly weaker
until they died. I think the last of them did not survive more
than about two months after I bought him. The Sedge Warblers
were certainly hardier than the others.
While they lived, they were the most charming little
creatures imaginable, delightfully tame, and, in their eagerness
for mealworms, bewitchingly comic. But then, the pity of it,
they so soon died !
I really think I did my level best for these little birds ;
they had the most nourishing food and a comfortable aviary, and
I fail to see that anything more which I could have done would
have prolonged their lives. And yet, in spite of every attention,
they were all dead and buried in much less than three months.
Whether my birds were wild-caught or hand-reared I do
not know ; or, if wild-caught, how they were meated off. A very
clever and experienced dealer has told me that he could never
succeed in meating off Willow Wrens, and he did not know how
it was done.
Well, no more of the &amp;quot;Smaller Warblers&amp;quot; for me. I
made my experiment, and it failed, and I think I am justified in
concluding that these charming, aerial little creatures are quite
unsuited for captivity -- unsuited, however, not by their mere
fragility, but from their natural diet being such as it is impossible
to satisfacftorily replace. They live on tinj^ living insects, and
nothing else will for long sustain their delicate bodies in health.
Possibly, some day, a substitute may be discovered ; but, at
present, we seek it in vain.
I will conclude with a warning. To those who are think-
ing of trying to keep any of the smaller Warblers, my advice is,
</bodyText>
<bodyText confidence="0.970435166666667" page_id="32635438"  page_num="5" year="" vol="">
-- &amp;quot;don&amp;apos;t&amp;quot; -- firstly, because it is cruel; secondly, because it is
useless.
I think that the Garden Warbler might be kept with about
as much success as the Blackcap and the White-throat. All
these will eat fruit largely, and being, therefore, less exclusively
insedtivorous, are much easier to fend for.

By R. A. Todd.
Among all the positive statements that have been made by
aviculturists at various times, there does not seem to be one to
which time or circumstance does not, sooner or later, find an
exception. There is, perhaps, no fact more generally accepted
as beyond doubt than that of the extreme pugnacity of the
Australian Fire Finch (Neochmia phaeton^. I can, however,
produce an exception to even this rule. I bought four cocks
in Odtober, i8g6 : one was in articulo mortis and died next
day ; two others proved the rule of the delicacy of the species
when newly-imported, by succumbing within the month.
The survivor has never had a day&amp;apos;s illness ; and, what is most
extraordinary, has proved the most peaceable of birds. He
lives in an aviary with about thirty companions, consisting
of Gouldians, Silverbills, Singing Finches, Nuns, etc., with
which he is on the best of terms. We are generally told
that this species is fond of mealworms, and Dr. Russ mentions
giving them the incredible number of twenty-five in a day ; but
my bird will hardly look at a mealworm, and possibly the
absence of animal food may account for his unusually peaceable
disposition, though in other respecfls he is extremely lively and
sings constantly. He is most anxious to nesf and is always
carrying bits of hay about, but unfortunately I have never been
able to provide him with a wife.
A handsome and rather engaging bird is the Blue
Grosbeak {Guiraca ccsriilea), but one about which the general run
of avicultural works are silent. Mr. Erskine Allon always said
that he found it short lived, dying within a few months or even
weeks, from no apparent cause. My first specimen came into
my possession on the 26th May, 1896, and a second in September
of the same year ; the latter was in poor condition. These two
birds were never on very good terms and the weaker succumbed
in the following January. In May I turned out the survivor into
</bodyText>
<bodyText confidence="0.99339765116279" page_id="32635439"  page_num="6" year="" vol="">
an open air aviary (together with a female), but he was killed, I
think by a cock Indigo or Diuca, both of which at once showed
hostility to him though they never molested the female, who is
still living. I am inclined to think that an open air aviary is the
suitable place for this bird, and that it will not thrive in a warm
and close room. I feel pretty certain that it is an egg-stealer
and should not keep it with smaller birds that are wanted to
breed. Canary-seed is its staple article of diet, and some hemp ;
mealworms it will eat to any extent, also egg-food and ants&amp;apos; eggs,
and it has a decided relish for green food. I have lately got
another male, but in poor condition, which seems generally the
case with these birds when first imported, though they soon
come round.
I find the Magpie Mannikin a most provoking bird in the
matter of breeding. My pair built a beautifully-constructed
nest of aloe-fibre in January. No young appearing after a
considerable interval, I made an exception to my invariable rule
of giving a wide berth to breeding birds, and examined the nest,
which I found half full of eggs. This nest was eventually
pulled to pieces and another built, which was almost immediately
destroyed, and another is now in process of construction, built, as
were the others, among some twigs of box. I should have
suspecfted that both my birds were females, but they are
decidedly different and came to me from Mr. Abrahams, who I
have never known to fail in distinguishing sex. These birds
also have a reputation for pugnacity, but I have not known them
to do any harm when associated with others of their own size ;
I have never tried them with Waxbills or other small species.
They are very fond of mealworms.
I consider myself fortunate in being the possessor of a
pair of Jacarinis ( Volatinia jacarini). The hen seems to be a
very rare bird in this country ; in colour she somewhat resembles
the hen Indigo Finch, though of course of a very different build.
These are rather slij^ birds, spending most of their time among
any bushes or cover there may be in the aviary, but when moving
about have very much the nervous habit of the Waxbills : their
tails seem never at rest. My birds have never nested, and from
their nervous disposition I should doubt their ever bringing off
a brood, though the Buntings seem generally steady sitters, if
these are Buntings, as Dr. Bowdler Sharpe suspects. They are
certainly fond of insects and always ready for a mealworm or
earwig ; as regards seed, they seem to prefer canary and Indian
millet, and delight in chickvveed.
</bodyText>
<bodyText confidence="0.998106953488372" page_id="32635440"  page_num="7" year="" vol="">
Of all the Waxbills the most delightful is probably
Dufresne&amp;apos;s Waxbill {Coccopygia dufresnii), but unfortunately I
cannot endorse the opinion that seems generally held of the
robustness of its constitution. I have had five individuals this
year, three cocks and two hens, and have now only one, a cock,
remaining. They were all in perfect health when I received
them, but dropped off one after the other without an}^ previous
sign of illness, after living with me for about two months. In
the same aviary I have kept two pairs of African Fire Finches
for over a year in perfect health, not to mention Cordon Bleus
for longer, so the conditions would seem quite favourable for
delicate species.
Another bird that seems difficult to keep is the Lined
Finch : it always appears moping and out of health, and never
lives long. Its nails grow at a rate that I have never seen
equalled in any other bird and require cutting almost weekl}^, a
very troublesome peculiarity in an aviary-kept bird. The
Guttural Finch I have found equally short lived (though I doubt
if I have ever had a thoroughly healthy individual); a great
contrast to its congener, the White -throated Finch, which
nothing seems to affect. This latter I had hopes of breeding
this year ; a small open cup-shaped nest was built very neatly
with bents in a branch of box, but no eggs were ever laid. The
Reddish Finch seems also fairly robust, though delicate when
newly-imported.
I think Mr. Fillraer rather maligns the Rufous-tailed
Finch. I have had a pair for nearly two years and, though kept
with the smaller Waxbills, have found them perfectly peaceable.
The hen is a ver}^ ready layer, but always dispenses with the
formality of a nest, preferring to deposit her eggs on the open
floor of the aviary ; she is apt to get egg-bound in the winter,
but this trouble invariably yields to the application of heat.
I have had a pair of Three-coloured Parrot Finches
{Erythrura trichrod) for some months. They are rather timid
and placid birds, but occasionally indulge in a very rapid flight
round their aviary. I believe allthe individuals now in Europe
are the descendants of a very small importation that reached
Germany some years ago ; it would appear, therefore, that they
are not difiicult to breed, but my pair has shown no sign of
doing so yet. They are certainly not so brilliant as the
commoner Parrot Finch, but the combination of subdued green,
blue and red is distindtly pleasing. I have not kept the two
species together and cannot say how they would agree ; the
</bodyText>
<bodyText confidence="0.99976988372093" page_id="32635441"  page_num="8" year="" vol="">
former species is perfedlly inoffensive with other birds. The hen
differs from the cock only in her slightly duller coloration. I
have never known this bird eat mealworms, of which the Parrot
Finch is very fond.
In May I received from Mr. Frostick a pair of White-
crowned Larks from lyoanda ; though rare, I can hardly
recommend them as interesting. They are purely ground birds,
but now and again rise two or three feet into the air with a
feeble fluttering flight. They become very tame, but are too
feeble to compete with birds of stronger will for mealworms,
which are their favourite article of diet ; they thrive well on the
usual seeds together with egg-food and ants&amp;apos; eggs. The cock
has rather a comic expression of self-importance and seriousness,
and is withal a handsome bird in his quiet dress of black and
white, the hen being more soberly attired in sandy buff.
One word of warning on the question of nesting material.
I was tempted to supply my birds with aloe-fibre ; they certainly
highly appreciate it (especially Aurora Finches and Magpie
Mannikins), but a bird once entangled in it is practicall}^ lost
unless quickly noticed ; and several severe losses have induced
me to abandon it. I now chiefly use hay, and this with
asparagus sprays, moss, and cotton wool seems to meet every
requirement, and such material is perfedlly safe. Weavers are
quite content with rather long fresh grass.
It seems generally held by aviculturists that a conserva-
tory is an unsuitable building wherein to place an aviary, on
account of the necessarily wide range of temperature it is
subjedt to. I confess I fail to see the force of the reason given.
In most climates of the world (though with some notable
exceptions) there is a very considerable difference between the
day and the night temperature, and this is markedly the case in
South Africa, whence we get- so many Finches. This facSl is
recognised by gardeners, who carefully maintain this variation
in the temperature of their glass-houses. Why should birds
require different treatment from plants in this respect ? If in
their native climate birds endure a lower temperature at night
than during the day, surely the same conditions will suit them
in confinement. Of course the efifecft of a hot sun shining
through glass is decidedly distressing to birds if they are
unable to find shelter from the rays, but this is easily arranged
by the use of an outside blind or a light wash on the glass, and
also by the provision of sheltered nooks in the aviary. I believe
other members of the Society have their aviaries under glass.
</bodyText>
<bodyText confidence="0.993449170731707" page_id="32635442"  page_num="9" year="" vol="">
and it would be interesting to know their experience. The main
point is the provision of ample ventilation, and this is probably
easier to arrange in a properly construdted glass-house than in a
room. I should mention that I do not keep any plants in the
same strudlure with my birds ; but again, I do not see why the
moderately moist atmosphere that the former require (coupled
with free ventilation) should be inimical to the health of the
latter ; in fact, so high an authority as Dr. Russ recommends
that living plants should be kept in the bird- room for the sake
of the beneficial effedts they have on the health of birds.
THE GOLDFINCH.
By J. Lewis Bonhotb.
Of the several species of birds commonly kept in confine-
ment, there is no more universal favourite than the Goldfinch.
It is the most brilliant in plumage of our commoner British
birds ; its ways and habits in a cage, where it may be taught
many little tricks, are pleasing and confiding ; while its song,
though hardly equal to that of the Linnet, is none the less
bright and cheerful. The plumage of the Goldfinch is too well
known to need any description. The female may be readily
distinguished from the male by her duller tints and brown
shoulders. The young, popularly known as &amp;quot; Greypates,&amp;quot;
resemble the adults, except that the head is of a uniform greyish
brown.
There are several varieties of this finch, which are met
with in a wild state, and breed true. The best known of these
is the &amp;quot; Cheverel,&amp;quot; in which the chin is white, the white extend-
ing upwards through the black band across the occiput. This
variety is supposed (with what truth I cannot say) to have a
finer song. Another variety is that known as the Pea-throat, in
which the white on the throat, instead of entirely replacing the
red, leaves a small patch the size of a pea. Besides these two
well marked varieties, birds are found in every intermediate
stage, and these are known in bird-catchers&amp;apos; parlance as
&amp;quot; bastard cheverels.&amp;quot; The usual other varieties occur, such as
albinism and melanism ; but these changes are often only con-
fined to the head. Lastly, this bird is credited by the ignorant
with many varieties which have no existence, such as Pear Tree,
Fir, Wood, etc. I have several times tried to master the sup-
posed differences between these varieties, but whenever I have
brought a bird-catcher to book, he has said he could not explain.

but would show me on a bird ; and when the bird was forth-
coming it was never typical of any particular kind !
Our Goldfinch has a very wide distribution, reaching east-
wards to Siberia and Persia, and southwards to the northern
shores of Africa. In Siberia it is replaced by another species,
C. caniceps (having no black on crown or nape), with which it
freely interbreeds, and specimens are found in all stages inter-
mediate between the two, as may be seen in some specimens
brought from the Yenesei by Seebohm, and now in the entrance
hall of the Natural History Museum at South Kensington. The
foreign Goldfinches, which are imported in great numbers into
this country every year, belong to a large eastern Asiatic race
known as C. major, and come from the south-west portions of
Siberia.
The Goldfinch breeds chiefly in orchards and gardens,
generally high up on the tree. The nest, which is cup-sliaped,
is composed of moss, bents, and a few roots, very neatly and
compactly woven together and lined with hair, willow down, and
a few small feathers. It is verj^ conservative as to locality,
breeding every year in the same orchard and sometimes on the
top of its former nest. The eggs are light blue, with a few
streaks of dark brown or purple, chiefly at the larger end. The
young are fed on semi-digested food from the crop, although it
has frequently been asserted that caterpillars are their diet.
It is as a cage bird, however, that it is of chief interest to
us, and it is, perhaps, the most widely kept of all cage birds.
Some like it for its song; others for its beauty and enticing ways;
others, again, because of the facility with which it may be made
to breed with the Canary, the progeny, if not beautiful, being
prized for the richness of its song.
Hybrids are also produced -- though only by experts -- with
the Bullfinch, this cross being one of the most beautiful of birds.
Never having possessed one, however, I am unable to speak of
the quality of its song. It may also be taught various tricks,
such as drawing up water and opening the box containing its
food ; but such performances are most unnatural, and certainly
not conducive to the birds longevity or enjoyment. They are,
therefore, greatly to be deprecated.
In the Fourth Edition of Yarrell, a quotation is given from
Syme, who writes about a number of trained Finches, which he
had seen exhibited by a certain Sieur Roman : -- &amp;quot; One seemed
\0x25A0dead, and was held up by the tail or claw without exhibiting any
sign of life ; a second stood on its head with its claws in the air ;
</bodyText>
<bodyText confidence="0.999197930232558" page_id="32635444"  page_num="11" year="" vol="">
a third imitated a Dutch milkman going to market with pails on
its shoulders ; a fourth mimicked a Venetian girl looking out of
a window ; a fifth appeared as a soldier and mounted guard as a
sentinel ; a sixth acted as cannoneer, and, with cap on head, fire-
lock on shoulder, and match in claw, discharged a small. cannon.
The same bird also feigned to have been wounded, and was
wheeled in a barrow, to convej^ it, as it were, to the hospital, after
which it flew away before the company. A seventh turned a
kind of windmill, and the last stood in the midst of some fire-
works, which were discharged all round it, without exhibiting
the least symptom of fear.&amp;quot; In captivity this bird lives for a
long time on the ordinary mixed seeds, but a small amount of
hemp daily is a necessity, and, if possible, it should always have
access to some &amp;quot; soft food.&amp;quot; When wild it is frequently met
with in flocks on waste ground where thistles abound, and such
food would, doubtless, be both acceptable and beneficial in
confinement.
About such a general favourite many fables and stories
naturally arise. The following we found when glancing through
a popular work on British Birds, now somewhat out of date : --
It appears that a pair of these birds built their nest on a very
slender branch, and in due course the eggs were hatched. The
young soon began to get too heavy, and the slender branch was
gradually giving way under their weight till the nestlings came
into imminent danger of being thrown out. When matters
had reached this dangerous stage, the birds were observed to
take one end of a piece of string, which had been used among
the nesting materials, and tie it round a stronger neighbouring
branch, thus saving their offspring. Another story tells how a
certain lady had a Goldfinch that never saw her go out without
making every effort in his power to quit his cage and follow her.
On her return she would be welcomed with ever}^ mark of
extreme delight, and as soon as she approached a thousand little
actions showed his pleasure and satisfaction. If she presented
her finger, he would caress it for a long time, uttering a low,
joyous murmvir. This attachment was so exclusive that if his
mistress substituted another person&amp;apos;s finger for her own he would
peck it sharply, whilst one of his mistress&amp;apos;, placed between two
of a stranger&amp;apos;s, would be at once recognised and caressed
accordingl}&amp;apos;.
The belief in the strong feelings of attachment of this
Species is widespread, and we will conclude this article by
quoting a few lines from Cowper on the subject.

The poet, after relating how two Goldfinches lived
together in a cage, and how one of them succeeded in escaping,
continues thus : --
&amp;quot; The open windows seemed to invite
The freeman to a farewell flight ;
But Tom was still confined.
And Dick, although his way was clear,
Was much too generous and sincere
To leave his mate behind.
&amp;quot; So settling on his cage, by play,
By chirp and kiss, he seemed to say
&amp;apos;You must not live alone.&amp;apos;
Nor would he quit that chosen stand
Till I, with slow and cautious hand,
&amp;gt; Removed him to his own.&amp;quot;
THE GREY JAVA SPARROW.
(Munia oryzivo7&amp;apos;a).
By Wesley T. Page.
This common bird scarcely needs description. It is about
five inches long -- body three inches, tail two inches -- heavily
built almost to clumsiness, and yet graceful and sprightly in its
movements.
The beak is thick and heavy and of a bright rose colour,
shading almost to white at the tip. The head, rump, tail, and
larger wing feathers are black, cheeks white and very sharply
outlined, the other parts of the plumage being lighter or darker
purplish grey, legs and feet, flesh colour.
In good condition it is tightly and compactly feathered, so
much so that it is difficult to individualise the feathers, but the
plumage appears one level, smooth garment, covered with a
bloom, similar to that seen on ripe grapes and plums, and this, in
spite of sharp contrasts, gives it quite a taking and masher-like
appearance.
Sexes are exactly alike in plumage, but the hen is
generally a little smaller, flatter on the crown, and, when closely
observed, particularly from the side, her beak is narrower and
more pointed.
Java Sparrows are found in Java, Japan, China, and
Southern India, where they commit great havoc in the rice fields,&amp;quot;
rice being their principal food in a state of nature ; in confine-
ment millet and canary seed will be sufiicient, with a little soft

food when there are young in the nest, though some pairs will
bring up their young on seed alone. Some aviculturists assert
paddy rice to be essential, but I have never found it so, and it is
certainly rather expensive and difficult to obtain ; and, if fed as
indicated above, they will remain in the best of health and bring
up brood after brood (green food and grit, of course, being sup-
plied in addition). I would recommend that aviary-bred birds
be procured (though they are double the price of imported ones),
as the wild-caught birds do not nest readily in captivity. And
though there are exceptions which do so, these generally choose
the winter (and then, out of doors, the young are seldom reared),
and usually only after being a year or two in their quarters, while
aviary-bred birds nest as readily as Canaries -- even more so, for
they are excellent feeders. Out of doors they will usually rear
three broods in the season, but in an indoor aviary, slightly
heated, I should say they would go on breeding all the year
round, only stopping for the moult ; but I have only kept them
out of doors.
Nesting accommodation : They like a box, closed on all
sides, with a hole for entrance, or a cocoanut husk -- mine always
choose the box. I generally get a dry soap powder box, which
is about eighteen inches by nine inches, and six inches deep,
with a wire-hinged lid ; insert two partitions ; tack down the lid ;
cut in it three holes ; fix a perch in front of each ; and I then
have three nests for about a penny, in which, according to my
experience, the birds will nest side by side, and not interfere one
with the other, save in defending their own apartment and the
perch in front of it. Fine hay is all they require for nesting
material.
The period of nidification I cannot give with certainty, as
it is so difficult to tell when they begin sitting, but I believe it to
be thirteen or fourteen days ; the young usually fly at about four
weeks ; and are well able to feed themselves at six weeks, though
they importune the old birds for food, till at last they lose
patience and drive them off&amp;quot;.
They must not be meddled with : inquisitiveness -- laudable
though it be -- is incompatible with the successful breeding of
foreign birds, or British either, with very few exceptions. I
have constru-cted my small garden aviary with small doors and
flaps, so that I can refill the hoppers, change the water, and
scrape out the floor all from the outside, only having to go inside
once a year for the renewal of perches, etc. I have always found
Java Sparrows to be quite harmless, though they will not let

other birds come near their nest perch, and my aviary is rather
crowded with a mixed collection of British and foreign finches.
Several pairs will agree and breed together, even with other
species, providing there are at least twice as many nests as pairs
of birds.
They are hardy in the extreme, safely coming through the
roughest winter weather. I have found mine on sharp frosty
nights roosting in the open uncovered portion of the aviary, and
in .the very pink of condition next day. The bath should be
given in all weathers, and they will keep themselves in perfect
trim, and thrive on the roughest treatment, though, like all other
species, they repay, to the full, careful and thoughtful attention.
When Mr. Java is making love to his mate, he is most
entertaining and amusing, going through a most grotesque per-
formance of jumping, bowing, scraping, and twirling in the
effort to shew himself off to the best advantage. lyCt me put in
a plea for aviaries here. Birds never do themselves justice even in
the largest cage, and they give an ample return for the cost of erecting
aviaries in the pleasure they afford and the happiness of their
demeanour when kept under almost natural conditions. I am in
favour of garden aviaries constructed similarly to an ordinary fowl
run, viz., with shed, shelter open at front, and run open top aud
front, wired with half-inch netting ; and I am convinced that
many species that will not live indoors without a little heat, in
such an aviary, if turned out in June, will survive our severest
winters.
Java Sparrows readily become tame, and with their bright
appearance, perfect trim, and entertaining ways, a beginner could
not do better than invest in a pair or two, provided he procures
aviary-bred ones. As I said before, these are the cheapest and
best in the end, even at three times the cost of the imported
ones.

SERIN FINCHES BREEDING IN CONFINEMENT.

A pair of Serin Finches ( Serhius seriiius) have this season
nested successfully in my aviary. The nest, an exceedingly
Small structure, much smaller than a Redpoll&amp;apos;s, was completed
by about the 3rd of May ; four eggs were laid ; and three young
ones left the nest on the 31st of May. They were fed chiefly on
the seed of the dwarf grass, and on leaving the nest were soon
able to look after themselves. The old birds nested again at
once; but I had carelessly allowed a lot of L,ong-tailedfield mice^

to establish themselves round the aviary, and these destroyed the
eg^s. A third nest of eggs was, unfortunately, wastedbysomeyoung
Goldfinches and Greenfinches which had been bred also. During
the time the hen Serin was sitting and the young being fed, the
cock spent the whole of his time in fighting, chiefl}^ with a cock
Goldfinch. At other times the quietest and most peaceable bird
alive, lie now was a regular nuisance -- he fought till he had no
feathers on head or breast, and looked a thorough wreck. The
young, on leaving the nest, were brown -- a good deal like Red-
polls ; but have now acquiredthe yellow markings of adult birds,^
though not quite so bright.
On the 26th May I was both surprised and pleased to see a
wild male Serin pay them a visit. It stayed about the aviary
most of the morning, having a wash in a brook which runs close
by. I heard it singing in some tall oaks in the afternoon, after
which I saw it no more. I imagine this species visits Britain
more often than is supposed, for it would probably not be noticed
by anj&amp;apos;-one unacquainted with its song.

We are afraid that most of the members never read the &amp;quot; Notices to-
Members&amp;quot; which appear inside the cover of the Magazine. Much of the
matter printed there is of a formal character, and is reproduced month
after montli without alteration, but almost every month there is some
special notice which members would do well to read.
It is very unfortunate that the plate to accompany Dr. Butler&amp;apos;s article
ou the Chinese Quail, and which is intended to form the frontispiece to our
fourth volume, is not ready, and has to be held over till next month. The
hand-colouring process is a lengthy one, and cannot be hurried. The
Secretar}&amp;apos; will do all in his power to secure the punctual appearance of the
other plates, but it is more than probable that some of these will be
delayed also.
While on the subject of plates, we may as well remind members that
those who want hand-coloured copies should give notice to the Secretary at
once. And it would save time and trouble if they would at the same time
send the special subscription of 5/- for the colouring. This will in every
case be expected to be paid before the ist of Januar3\ Those members who

It is a rather remarkable thing that none of our smaller British birds
of the soft-food sort take ver}&amp;apos; kindly to captivity, while many little soft-
billed foreign birds are hardy and long-lived in the aviary. The difference

<bodyText confidence="0.999476479166666" page_id="32635449"  page_num="16" year="" vol="">
is probably due to the fact that the Britishers are mainly insectivorous,
while the foreigners subsist chiefly on fruit. vStri&amp;lt;5lly insedlivorous birds
are hard to cater for, but fruit-eating birds, on the contrary, are scarcely
more trouble than seed-eaters. Also, fruit-eaters can be supplied with their
natural food in its natural form, while insect-eaters have to be fed chiefly
on artificial substitutes for the live insects which are their proper diet.
Honey-eaters, again, are fairly easj^ birds to provide for, as honey can be
given in its natural state, and milk-sop forms an admirable substitute for it.
There was some discussion recently in the Feathered World as to the
number of birds which an aviary of a given size would contain, and as to
how the capacity was to be reckoned. The better opinion seemed to be that
the ground area of the aviary was the most important element in the calcu-
lation, and mere height a secondary matter. This is, no doubt, correct.
An aviar}^ ten feet high will comfortably accommodate very few more birds
than one half that height, although it will give the inmates more room for
exercise. As Mr. Fulljanies pointed out, it is an excellent plan to build
bird-room aviaries in two tiers, one above the other. If the room be ten
feet high, five feet can be allowed for each aviar}&amp;quot;-, which is generally ample.
The upper aviaries can be used for breeding, while the lower ones are occu-
pied by birds kept only for show. The upper aviaries are even more
secluded than those which go from floor to ceiling, while in the lower ones
the birds are kept better under observation. But if the room be much less
than ten feet in pitch the lower aviary is apt to seem wanting in height,
and the plan does not answer so well.
At the last Palace Show the specimen of the Blue Sugar-bird [Dacnis
cayana) exhibited by Mr. Fulljanies aroused much interest, and it was stated,
we believe correctly, that it was the first female of the species ever imported
alive. This autumn a few more have arrived, all, like Mr. Fulljames&amp;apos;s bird,
females. For the information of those who have not seen it, we may men-
tion that the hen is slightly smaller than a Goldfinch, the general colour
being a rather dark metallic green, with pale greenish blue head and ashy
throat. The legs and beak are dark, and the latter is not curved. The male
is described as being a lovely blue and black bird. It is strange that the female
alone should be imported. This bird, and the Yellow-winged Sugar-bird
{Ccereba cyanea), in spite of their apparent fragility, seem well adapted for
captivit}&amp;apos;, being very tame and living well on a diet of milk-sop, fruit, and
honey. They seem much hardier and easier to keep in condition than
Tanagers, and are certainly more attractive on account of their more cou&amp;apos;
fiding disposition and more graceful movements.
The Committee of the L. &amp; P. O. have provided at their approaching
Show a class for Mannikins, Waxbills, and Combasous; one for Weavers and
Whydahs (except Combasous) ; and another for &amp;quot; any other variety of Seed-
eating bird.&amp;quot; The result of this frankly unscientific classification is that
Grass-finches are grouped with Finches, Grosbeaks, and Buntings, and the
judge has to take upon himself to decide which species are to be considered
Grass-finches and which Mannikins or Waxbills -- not always an easy matter.
Would it not be better either to name in the schedule every doubtful species
likely to be shown, or to refer to some recognised list }

A gentleman at Brighton has a common Barbary Dove which has
rived in his possession for 23 years, and was adult when he first had it. It
is in good plumage, but some^vhat infirm. This old Dove is a confirmed
bachelor, having always refused to have anything to say to the hens at
different times introduced to him.
The following pigeon story is vouched for by the Premierof New Zea-
land. Mr. Seddon&amp;apos;s family received from relatives in Victoria a beautiful pair
of Antwerp homing pigeons. One day the birds were out flying, but only one
returned to the cot, and nothing more was heard of the other ; but some
time after news was received from Victoria that the missing bird had
arrived safely at its former home. To reach Victoria from New Zealand
the bird must have accomplished the feat of flying something like 1,000
miles without rest, and according to the dates it must have done the
journey in less than three days, which would mean that it would have to fly
at a speed of from 18 to 20 miles an hour continuously.
We have always refrained from advocating the use of any special
make of aviary appliance or bird food, as we considered that to do so would
be iinfair to other makers. But we feel that we may properly make an
exception in favour of Jones&amp;apos;s Hygienic Fountains. These fountains are
entirely unlike any others that we have ever seen, and are infinitely
superior to the old-fashioned pattern. They, and none others, ought to be
used in everj^ bird room. It is true that they are rather more expensive
than the ordinary fountain, but then the}^ are much more durable, so that
they cost no more in the end. They are so constructed that the water can-
not very well be fouled by the birds ; they can be easily and quickly filled ;
and the inside can be thoroii ghly cleaned.
CORRESPONDENCE.
THE GENUS BROTOGERYS.
Sir, -- I should feel obliged to any member of the Avicultural Society
who can give me any general information about the genus Brotogeiys and as
to their desirability as pets. The Orange-flanked Parrakeet, which I have
had, was a most fascinating bird, as tame as possible from the moment I
bought him. I am desirous to know if the other members of this genus
are as attractive as B. pyrrhopterus.
Cl^AUDE D. RoTCH.
The follozving refly was sent io Mr. Rotch : --
I have kept members of the Brotogeiys genus for several years, and
am very fond of them ; but I find that individuals of the same species vary
greatly according to the treatment they have been subjected to before being
received. They are constitutionally very timid birds, and are ofttimes so
roughly treated before coming into one&amp;apos;s hands that the}&amp;apos; do not readily
recover sufficient nerve to become tame : the}&amp;apos; are terror-stricken.

The Orange-flanked Parrakeet, when kept in a cage, is quite one of
the tamer species ; my pair, however, loose in the bird-room and aviary,
became very strong, and then lost much of their tameness ; they never
followed me about, nor came up to have a chat, as some of the others do.
I had a pair of Tovi Parrakeets (B. jugiilaris) for many years ; when-
ever I appeared, they invariably flew on to my head or shoulders, and
followed me about in house and garden. The}&amp;apos; nested regularl}&amp;apos; (unsuccess-
fully) ; and this year, when just about to lay, the female was knocked over
by a Redrunip, and quickly died. The male I still have. Yet some Tovis
are not nearly so tame as, these always were. They are common.
The &amp;quot;White - winged (or Yellow-winged) Parrakeet (B. virescens) is
slightly larger. I have one, a male, which I am told is the only living
specimen in Europe ; certainlj- it is the only living specimen I have ever
seen. He is very tame, and very fond of arguing the point with me. I
like him much.
He has paired with a Golden-fronted Parrakeet (B. tiiipara), another
very rare species. I obtained twD females 3&amp;apos;ears ago, and have one still ;
they are the only specimens of the species I have ever seen. These are
very timid birds, and the least attractive of any I have kept ; probably a
male would be tamer. The orange of the primary-coverts is rich beyond
conception.
Quite one of the prettiest and most engaging of the genus is the tiny
Tui Parrakeet (B. tuij. It is somewhat rare. I have had three at different
times, and have found them rather delicate, and difficult to get into
good plumage, the tail feathers being specially liable to come to grief. A
male 1 now have has been with me eigliteen months ; but it was not until
about two months ago that it was strong and clever enough on the wing to
be left loose with the other birds. This Tui originally married the
Tuipara ; and they seemed a happy and contented couple. Then the
White-wing arrived ; and the fickle Tuipara forthwith deserted her tiny
spouse and offered her hand and heart to the new comer. The Tui and the
Tovi, both widowers, made friends, and are now inseparable.
The following, neither very uncommon, I have not kept : --
The All Gree;i Parrakeet (B. tiricaj, a long slim green bird, is said to
make a delightful pet.
The Canary-winged Parrakeet (B. cliiririj is like B. virescens, but lacks
the white flights. It is said to be a noisy bird; birt I have not noticed it to
be more so than the others. They all have shrill voices -- but they never
scream as do so many of the Parrots.
I am not acqirainted with the four other members of the genus.
They shorrld not be subjected to much cold, nor should they be too
well fed. As a rule, hemp-seed should not be given to them.

The following reply was sent to Mr. Harrison : --
Ordinarily, the greatest height of colour is attained at the age of
three years, but it is also very much a matter of constitution. Blackbirds,
haud-reared and kept in cages indoors, do not obtain the same crocus-like
colour of bill and eye cere as do wild birds, or even those kept in aviaries
outdoors. So that while the colour may be some guide to age, the con-
ditions uuder which the bird has been kept must be taken into considera-
tiiou.

THE BRONZED DRONGO.
Sir, -- A dealer lately advertized some Metallic Blackbirds, from India.
I wrote and asked him to let me know the scientific name of the bird or a
description of it. In reply, he writes : -- &amp;quot;The Metallic Bird is the size of
an English Starling, it is ver}&amp;apos; handsome, ver}- glossy ; the Latin name is
Metallic Bird.&amp;quot; Could you, from the above description, identify the bird.
I should like to get an Indian bird, called in Dr. Jerdou&amp;apos;s book, the
Himalayan Whistling Thrush, which is something like an English Black-
bird, but larger, with a metallic gloss on the back. I am afraid from the
dealer&amp;apos;s description, that the bird he has is hardly large enough to be the
bird I want.
C. L. Harrison.
7&amp;apos;he following reply was sent to Mr. Harrison : --
The bird is probably &amp;quot;The Bronzed Drongo &amp;quot; {Ckaptia ceneaj, a very
common species in India, and an excellent singer. It should prove a very

Sir, -- One continvially sees, in print, that green food must never be
given to birds either wet or with frost on it. I conclude that this only
applies to birds kept indoors ; as in my small aviar}&amp;apos; with aboiit 50 birds,
British and foreigners, last winter the seed was frequently coated over with
frost, and in that condition freely eaten ; also winter and summer, wet and
fine, my birds have a daily supply of such weeds as the garden supplies, and
at times, according to the weather, it is frequently wet and at other times
frosty. Again, I never remove the bath-- it is there all weathers-- and the
birds use it all weathers too, without any apparent ill eff&amp;quot;ect -- I have not had
a death for two years, with such birds as Canaries, African Weavers, Indian
Avadavats, Cutthroats, Java Sparrows, and British Finches -- but, if you
think it worth the space, I should like the opinion of some of our
experienced members upon it in our Magazine.

&amp;quot; BRITISH BIRDS, THEIR NESTS AND EGGS.&amp;quot;
Sir, -- I see in the review of the second volume of the above work in
the \0x25A0Avictcllural Magazine for Octoher, the sentence quoted, &amp;quot;If man would

let nature alone, lie would find the balance perfedt, but lie interferes every-
where and makes a mess of it.&amp;quot;
L would venture to put the question, &amp;quot; Is not man a part of
&amp;quot; Nature &amp;quot; ? Dr. Gatke remarks that man can affect birds in a very slight
way directly ; that species are exterminated by the destruction of their
breeding-haunts by cultivation, &amp;c. Is man to return to a nomadic life in
order not to disturb the balance of nature ? The rabbit became a pest in
Australia through nature. If man was not to introduce the i-abbit there,
we must also ask him not to cultivate wheat, &amp;c. It seems to me we must
accept man, and consequently man&amp;apos;s interference, as part of the whole
design.
I must say ni)&amp;apos; experience of rearing L,innets by hand, is that they are
one of the easiest birds to rear, and are very healthy, but, like sparrows,
they are not very tame after they are reared. Still, I should always recom-
mend anyone who wants to keep a Linnet, to rear it by hand.

BRITISH BIRD-CALLS.
Sir, -- A short time ago I heard a bird-call which I did not recognise;
beyond remembering that I had read of it a few days previously. I
searched the book in which I had seen it, without success, and the identity
of the bird remains undecided. I thought, &amp;quot; Oh, for a list of bird-calls,
arranged alphabetically, so that any call, which may be heard, can be found
at once ! &amp;quot; I did not let the matter rest here, and have collected the recorded
calls of more than 200 British Birds. Now, I seek the aid of the avicul-
turists, especially those who keep British Birds, both in supplying
omitted calls and in amending those which appear to be erroneously given.
My list, as far as it has gone, is now in the press, and will probably
be received ere this letter appears. I shall be pleased to send copies to all
members who will send me a post-card signifying their desire that I
should do so.

THE GUTTURAL FINCH.
Sir, -- I am surprised to note, in this number of the AvicuUiiral
Magazine, that this species is regarded, by a gentleman usually expert in
keeping delicate birds, as by no means hardy.
About tlii-ee years ago I purchased a pair of Guttural Finches and
turned them into one of my bird-room aviaries ; again, in 1896, I bought a
pair which I turned into my largest cool aviary. None of these birds have
ever had the slightest ailment or given me the slightest cause for anxiety:
they are very inoffensive, only swearing when disturbed at meals by other
birds, and the males sing almost as well as the White-throated Finch.

PARROT NOTES.
By the Hon. and Rev. F. G. Du&amp;apos;TTOn. ;
Whenever I undertake to write about Parrots, I am always
astonished at the very little I have to say. No fairy godmother
gave me the gift of imagination, and I seem to have little to tell
except some plain facts which are very much against all the
romance with which Parrots are: generally surrounded.
I must have been born with a hobby for Parrots, for I
cannot recollect the time when to have a Parrot was not my
great wish. It was probably a case of atavism, for I have always
heard that my great-grandmother had a &amp;quot; bird and beast room,&amp;quot;
as it was called, at Sherborne. But I did not possess a Parrot till
I was 15, since when I have rarely been without one, and often
have twelve or fourteen. As I am 57, that means 42 years of
Parrot-keeping, so I ought to know something about them. But
I have only arrived at a sense of my ignorance.
I confess that I have been narrow-minded. It isn&amp;apos;t every
Parrot I care about -- I am always in search of the ideal pet. It
must be as small as a Bullfinch, talk like a Grey, have the
intelligence of a dog, and the beauty of the Paradise Parrakeet.
It must not bite and it must not scream, and it must be as tam6
as a Troupial. And it must be clean. In what species is this
combination to be found ? It will be seen that it at once excludes
a good many, and therefore my experiences are more limited
than if I had set to work to keep Parrots with the purse of
a Rothschild and the thoroughness of a German.
Parrots must be fairly popular, for the demand seems
unlimited. It would be interesting to know how many thousands
are yearly imported to Liverpool alone. What becomes of the
greater number of them ? I think we know -- the dustman&amp;apos;s cart
or the back garden receives the vast majority in a few weeks.
But the mortality is chiefly confined to the Greys, though I was

told the otlier day, in tUe Zoo, that Parrot fever had at last
invaded the Amazons.
We may suppose that everyone who bu3^s a Parrot would
agree that my list of qualifications is the right ideal. In what
species will the nearest approach be found to it ?
Now it must be understood at once that in what I am
going to say I shall speak of species as a whole, and only of
mj^ own experience of them. If I say Cockatoos are noisy, I shall
l3e extremely interested if any one can aver with truth that they
have one which never screams, but it will not in the least aflfedt
ni}^ position, which is this, that I have found the Cockatoos I kept
noisy.
I.-- MACAWS.
People who write about Parrots generally begin with
Macaws. Let me do so too. The Macaw excels all the other
-Parrots in intelligence and in affection for its master ; and in
powers of speech, so long as it is a cock-bird ; but it is not small,
Jt is not clean, and none of mine could be warranted never to
scream. To keep a Macaw one wants a Parrot-house and a parlc
They are beautiful objects when. seen at a great height in the
air, but in a garden they are too destructive to the smaller trees.
And then a tame bird never really enjoys its liberty.
There are some Parrots jovl cannot trust out ; but it is, I am
convinced, because they fly out of reach the first time they are
let out. Let a Parrot once know its way ho)ne, and it will
always be wanting to come back as soon as it is turned out. I
had one Blue and Yellow Macaw which, though a good talker, was
an idiot. It flew to a branch, and there it would have stayed till
it died, unless it were frightened off, or caught. But all my other
Macaws came back. And then the trouble is, they come in at
the windows of the house, and, if no one sees them, they may
make matches of a priceless piece of furniture, before they are-
found out !
If one could only put the dog-like intelligence and&amp;quot;
affection of a Macaw into a Senegal or Meyer&amp;apos;s Parrot, one
would compound for the want of brilliant colour. But I fear for
the ordinary householder the Maca:w miist be put outside the
range of practical pets.
\0x25A0 Yet even with Macaws (though I write as if I had been&amp;apos;
Parrot-keeper in the Ark, and had had every kind) riiy experience
has been very limited. I do not say that I have not studied the
other species in other people&amp;apos;s keeping, but for myself, I have

-otily kept oiie Red and Yellow, one H3&amp;apos;aciiitliine, and four Blile
\0x25A0\0x25A0aiid Yellows. . *
Why did Beclisteiii say the Blue and Yellow Macaw was
not a good talker? I have never known any Parrot equal it -for
&amp;apos;quick learning and exact imitation of a special voice. I feel
&amp;apos;5ure the Parrot that was said to have preserved a lost language
*must have been a Blue and Yellow Macaw. But then it must be
a cock-bird -- the hens would not learn a word. Let all would-be
.&amp;apos;purchasers of Parrots beware of the superstition that sex makes
.no difference to a Parrot&amp;apos;s power of speech. In Grey Parrots, I
-admit, the hens talk ; but even in Grey Parrots, I believe, all the
really wonderful talkers have been cock-birds. I have knoWii
-hen Bengal Parrakeets say several sentences, but nothing like
the number the cocks quite commonly master. But certainly
,imy hen Macaws would not learn a word, though kept side by
side with cocks that learnt easily and readily. &amp;gt;
Beclistein gives the Great Green Macaw a good reputation
for talking. I never had one, but those I have seen did not
strike me as talking well. How curious is its trick of blushing!
Does any other animal share with man that most inconvenient
endowment ?
, - Have any of our members kept a Spix ? I have only seen
two-- one that our Zoo acquired some years ago from the Jardiii
d&amp;apos;Acclimatation, and one bought by Mr. Rothschild from Mr*.
Jamrach and deposited in the Gardens. They were both ill-
tempered : but as the first had a broken wing, it had probably
been caught old. I was greatly tempted by the offer of one from
Mr. Cross the other day, but there are so many calls on a parson&amp;apos;s
purse,. that he cannot always treat himself to expensive parrots.
I ought to have been keeper at the parrot-house in the Zoo.
It would be hard to take away the character of a whole
species on the observation of only two individuals, but if I have
*not yet seen a good-tempered Spix, neither have I ever seen an ill-
tempered Hyacinthine, or Glauca, or lycari. So sure am I always
-of their temper^ that I never hesitate to scratch the heads of these
kinds in the foreign Zoos. I see people looking at me as though
.1 wei&amp;apos;e Daniel in the. lions&amp;apos; den, but truth to say, it is a very cheap
-piece of bravado. Their angelic tempers seem accompanied by
a certain amout of stupidity. I have seen many, but only heard
one talk. And I do not think they have the same individual
attachment that the other Macaws have. They are equally good-
tempered to all the world, but my Hyacinthine did not seem to
make any difference between myself and others.. However, on

<bodyText confidence="0.98921004" page_id="32635457"  page_num="24" year="" vol="">
..this point I may not have had experience enough. I wonder
why dealers always ask such a high price for Hyacinthine
Macaws. They are not everybody&amp;apos;s bird, for they can bend the
wires of an ordinary Macaw&amp;apos;s cage with ease, but dealers will
ask for them double the price of a Spix, which is a far rarer
bird. They have one great advantage over other Macaws -- they
are much quieter ; they can make a row, but don&amp;apos;t often choose
to do it.
The Red and Yellow Macaw seems to me to be as good a
talker as the Blue and Yellow, but my bird was a hen, and
never learnt a word ; yet it always knew me. It was not uni&amp;gt;-
versally good-tempered. For the last eight or ten years of its
life it was at the Zoo, but on my rare visits it always recollected
me, and let me do just as I liked with it.
I do not think Macaws mind cold so long as they have
their liberty. I confess I do not understand what makes one
Parrot more susceptible to cold than another. I think I can say
which Parrots will not endure cold, and which will, but I do not
know why. Psittacus and Pceocephalus will not endure much,
Chry soils will -- yet they are all tropical. Cockatoos will. Ivories
will not, though they come from the same islands.
Here I must, for the present, bring my observations to an
end. I think I ought to be rewarded by someone writing their
experiences of the Crimson and Green, and Military Macaws.

BREEDING OF THE NECKLACED DOVE.

By Arthur G. Buti^er, Ph.D.
The Necklaced Dove (Turtur tigrhius) is found from
Burma through Malaysia southwards to the Moluccas. The
German name for it is Pearl-necked Dove ( PerlhalstdubchenJ ,
which appears to me to convey to the mind a more accurate idea
of the nuchal patch than the term &amp;quot; necklaced.&amp;quot;
In 1894 I purchased what purported to be a pair of this
species and turned them out into my garden aviary : I however
soon discovered, from the fact that they were constantly dis-
puting and cooing to each other, that I had two cock birds. I
tried introducing a Collared Turtle Dove (Turhir risorhts) but
that also proved to be a male bird and became so aggressive that
I gave it away. In 1896 one Necklaced Dove killed the other by

constantly^&amp;apos;peckiug its head ; thus my chance of breeding this
species was, for the time, at an end.
In 1897 a genuine female was offered to me, and I gladly
purchased it, and turned it out with the male (which had then
passed two winters in the open air). My old bird had become
quite tame, but the hen was very wild and I feared she would
not be prevailed upon to breed ; however I hung up an oblong
open box under cover against the wall of the aviary, filling it
half full of bran, and laying some hay and twigs upon the
surface of the latter.
The first intimation which I received that an attempt at
breeding had been made was the discovery, early in August, of a
broken egg upon the floor. Looking from this to the box, I saw
that a Bronze-necked Dove fZetiaida auriculataj was sitting in
the nest. I naturally concluded that I was going to breed
Bronze-necks ; but was puzzled, a few days later, to see a Neck-
laced Dove incubating, whereupon I imagined that hybrids
would probably result. For nearly three weeks the four Doves
took turns upon the eggs, the Bronze-necks doing the lion&amp;apos;s
share of the work, and then I found two neatly divided half egg-
shells on the ground and hoped that a young one had been born.
I saw no more shells after this, and had almost forgotten what
my Doves were about, when, on the morning of the 28th August,
I saw what looked like the hen Bronze-necked Dove sitting
huddled up in a corner. I picked it up, carried it indoors, and
turned it into one of my covered aviaries, where it waddled
about clumsily all day.
In the evening when I returned from business I went to
look at my Nicobar Pigeons, one of which had broken or dis-
located the last joint of one of its wings, when I perceived my
Bronze-necks in perfedl health sitting together on a branch :
then the truth was manifest,-- I had kept a young Dove away
from its parents all day. Of course I promptly restored it to its
nest, when I saw a wing lifted and knew that another bird yet
remained therein.
The following day the first bird was again on the floor,
and, when I attempted to replace it in the nest-box, the second
one scuttled out and flopped helplessly along on the floor. Each
day the same folly was repeated, for it was fully a week before
the older bird could fly from the ground ; although, starting
from the nest-box, it could pass on the wing through the double
aviary from end to end, a distance of about twenty-one feet.
The second youngster never got so far as this, but on September

the gtli apparentlj&amp;apos;^ went to &amp;apos;roost &amp;apos;on a box beside hiy cock&amp;apos;-&amp;apos;&amp;apos;

By this time the older &amp;quot; squeaker&amp;quot; had acquired its full&amp;quot;
l^tigth&amp;apos;of tail, and wa.s clearly seen to be &amp;apos;a. young Necldaced .
Dove (of course with ho trace of the whitie-spotted collar, which.&amp;apos;
does not appear until later), then the wet nights gave it cramp,&amp;quot;
it became helpless, broiichitic, and on the 17th September it died. &amp;apos;*&amp;quot;
This bird being in its first plumage, and therefore some-
what younger than those described by, Count Salvadori, it is
worth while to note its colouring :-- Forehead and cheeks ,
whitish ash ; crown and mantle ash-gre}^ all the feathers more .
or less broadly fringed with vinaceous brown ; back vinaceous
brown in front ; lower back and rump ashy-grej^ with smoky
tips to all the feathers. I^esser wing-coverts mostly vinaceous ;
brown with blackish shaft-streaks, but the outer ones white witk.;
blackish streaks, and the bend of the wing pure white ; Quter&amp;quot;
primary co\^erts ashy with blackish shaft-streaks ; outer median
atid secondarj&amp;quot; coverts whitish ash, with white outer borders ; ^
remaining coverts smoky brown, washed exteriially v^ith vina- \0x25A0
ceous, and with blackish streaks ; primaries blackish, the second, .
third and fourth emarginate, and white-edged externally bej^on&amp;apos;d&amp;apos;
the middle ; the remainder liarrowly from beyond the middle on.;
both sides with rufous-brown ; outer secondaries blackish, ;
edged exterirall)^ towards the tips with white ; inner secondaries;
vihaceous with black shafts, edges clearer rufous-brown ;&amp;apos; two ^
central tail-feathers smoky-brown, remaining- feathers black, the&amp;apos;
three outer ones on each side broadly tipped&amp;apos; with white ; chin
and front of the throat white gradualh^ passing into vinaceous -
lavender on the breast, becoming paler and more buff-tinted on -
the abdomen &amp;apos;and flanks and chalky white on the vent and under-
tail-covertSv Bill dark leaden-grey; feet dark flesh-pink ; iris
pale straw-yellow. . .:
About the middle of September and before the death of &amp;apos;
the second of the two j^oung birds (both of which proved to be&amp;quot;
males) I fixed up a series of pigeon holes, with shallow boxes
filled with bran and haj^, at one end of the aviary, and shut off&amp;apos;-
the Nicobar Pigeons by closing the door of communication&amp;apos;
(which divides the garden aviary into two). &amp;apos; Before the end oP
the month the hen bird Vv^as again sitting, this time steadily and -

\0x25A0 I have a small pond very near to. ni}^ house, so near tha^;
the Moorhens, from neighbouring water would never have taken-;
possession of it of their own accord. With the view of establish- :&amp;gt;
ing them, three years since I obtained some half-dozen pinioned-;
young ones, and kept them in a fruit cage&amp;apos;&amp;quot; not far from the water,,
until the ensuing spring. While in the cage, I accustomed;
them to take wheat from a Pheasant feeder, weighted so as to lift
easily. After they;were set at libertj^, the presence of some men,)
who were working close to, the pond, frightened them all away;.;
En passant, I may remark thatj in my opinion, they would have.:
remained if some faggots had been immersed, close to the bank,&amp;gt;
Under which they could have concealed^ themselves ,wi:thont;)
leaving the water. I afterwards had two refuge? &amp;apos; made of;;
branches, etc., so that the birds are never far from cover. ; ;:
;..... The next autumn I obtahied another consignment of
5^oung ones, and kept them in the cage until the spring. During--
the severe weather one of the previous batch returned, and&amp;apos;^
remained about, with an absence of five days in the spring,,
until the new-comers were liberated. It had made friends;
through the wires, and quickly mated when the cage-door was.-
left.open. During 1896 the. couple reared two broods. About^
the first week in October great commotions were heard in the&amp;quot;
pond, and all but one of the young disappeared, apparently,
driven away by the old ones. The remaining young one left this-,
spring. This year I took regular notes of the nesting operations, ,
a resimie oi which may, I think, interest the members. .\0x25A0 \0x25A0: \0x25A0
* On the i6th of February my favourites were flirting. The^
next morning, although frosty, one of them was seen carrying ;
building material in its beak from the little island to the nearest&amp;apos;
covert. The next day the rudiments of a nest were seen on,
the island. The male-bird had, for the past fortnight, been very;
tame. From this time until the i8th of March the weather Was ;
very raw and disagreeable,, and the construdtion of the nest:
proceeded-;:in a very desultory manner. The first egg appeared-

was laid on the 25th. The hen then began to sit closely,
allowing us to pass within some eight or nine feet of her without
leaving the nest. This favour was not accorded to others. The
hen got up and made for covert the moment that she heard a
strange voice ; and one visitor only (a lady) was fortunate
enough to see her on the nest. While the laying proceeded the
nest was constantly added to. This was continued during sitting
until April the loth, when the nest presented the appearance of
a bulky mass of weeds. The bottom had been raised as well as
additions made. At this date the male was very bold, and was
engaged in picking over the tops of the weeds, apparently
searching for suitable food for the expected chicks. On the I5tli
the male was even bolder, and coolly sat preening his feathers,
regardless of my watching the performance. The next day six
young came off, one egg remaining in the nest. The demeanour
of the male was peculiar, and quite different from the previous
season : he kept away from the brood and appeared to take no
notice of them. Rain followed for two days, and the hen was
continually brooding the young on the nest. When she left it
on the iStli the seventh egg had gone and the hatching numbered
seven birds. The cock was now in attendance, although not
nearly so fussy as in the previous season.
A few days afterwards it was noticed that some bread,
which had been thrown on the water, had been taken into the nest:
it is fair, therefore, to presume that the parents considered it suit-
able food for the 5&amp;apos;^oung. The male was also observed feeding
the hen as she sat brooding on the nest. For a few days it was
noticed that the tops of the irises, which held a booby nest the
previous year, were bent over, and on the 21st the foundations of
a nest were to be seen. The male bird had been constantly
about the place, but the hen had not been near it. Two days
afterwards, the male and two chicks were in this nest, while the
old one was occupied by the hen and the other young. On May
the ist I was surprised to see three eggs in the new nest. Further
eggs were laid daily until the 5th, when absence from home
suspended my observations. Before my leaving, however, the
hen had commenced sitting. Returning home on the 17th, I
found that the eggs had been stolen during my absence. On
the loth it was observed that a new nest had been built among the
sticks near the island, and was nearly ready to receive the eggs.
Further work was done at this new nest, but it was finally
abandoned, and a new one commenced in a much safer position
in a willow clump a little distance from the bank. The next day the
robbed nest was pulled in pieces, and another nest observed on

the island. In all, three new nests had been built, and the
robbed one desti&amp;apos;oyed, since the eggs were taken. On the 22nd,
further work was proceeding at the willow. The abandoned nest
in the sticks was used for brooding the first clutch, and trodden
out of all shape by them. The nest in the willow was worked at
dail}^ and on the 29th two eggs were observed therein. The next
day the eggs could not be counted, as fresh reeds had been added
to the sides of the nest so as to partially conceal them. On the i5tl;
of June an egg was floating on the water near the nest ; the male
bird was seen raising the sides of the nest round the sitting hen.
On the 20th three chicks appeared, while three eggs remained in
the nest. The next day there were still but three chicks, and I
had to leave home. On my return, on the 25th, I counted six
chicks, but one was in the water looking very weakly. The
next day it was floating, dead, close to the nest ; but the parent
birds made no effort to remove it. The same day I saw one of
the first hatching sitting on the nest, brooding the little ones.
.When the chicks were a week old the parents, for some reason
or other, began to still further raise the sides of the nest. A few
days afterwards, one of the old ones was brooding the young on
the site of the original nest on the island, which was partially
renewed by bending down the growing rushes ; and the nest on
the willow had the sides further repaired, as if in readiness for a
fourth laying. This was continued for several days, but no eggs
were laid. A new nest of reeds was observed on the island, but
judging from its small size and bad workmanship, it was probably
built by the young in imitation of the parents. The tops of a bed
of irises were bent over some two feet above water, so as to form
a platform, on which one of the adult birds was sunning itself.
On the 28th of August, it was noticed that all the nests,
except that on the island (supposed to be the work of the young
birds), were pulled to pieces, and the materials scattered about.
In the latter end of September, the number of young birds was
reduced to two ; but whether this was the work of cats or rats,
or was the result of the others being driven away by the parents,
can only be conjedlured. None of the commotions heard in 1896
have been noticed this year
A comparison of the behaviour of my Moorhens with that
of those in St. James&amp;apos;s Park, is curious. While mine are nearly
as tame, so far as we are concerned, as those in London, yet they
remain as wary as wild birds, with regard to strangers ; while
those in the Park are quite indifferent to the presence of anyone.

EXHIBITION.
Held in the Aquarium, Westminster, on Nov 2nd, yd, &amp; /\.th, 1897.
By Reginai^d Phillipps.
The members of this Society are heartil}^ to be con-
gratulated on their fine Exhibition of Birds, held on the first
Tuesday, Wednesdaj^ and Thursday of November.
The total number of exhibits must have been great ; and
possibly to this may be attributed various errors in numbering,
missorting of cages -- getting worse each day it seemed to me --
and other little matters vexatious to the spirit of the orderly
man ; a little more organization or supervision v^&amp;apos;ould not have
hurt anybody.
The sickness and mortality among the birds v^^as not
inconsiderable, for which some of the exhibitors were not wholly
irresponsible. Apparently quite a number were more or less
debarred from drinking by their over-careful owners. The very
shallow show-cages, too shallow to allow some of the birds to
moderately extend their wings, and cruelly exposing nervous
and timid species, were sad to behold. And can all this pretty
painting of the inside of cages be otherwise than injurious ?
I^et me state a case. I purchased a bird on the Wednesday, not
a first class, but an apparently healthy, specimen. On the
Thursday it was lumpy ; and on the Friday morning when I
took it home it was nearly as round as a ball For a day or two
it was ver}&amp;apos; bad, but has since moderately improved. On
inspedling the cage, I found not only that the inside had been
painted light green but that actually the water-tin had been
painted inside and out. I suppose birds must be exhibited, but
exhibitors need not go out of their way to predispose the poor
captives to sickness and death.
Thanks to the glass roof of the Aquarium having been
thoughtfully covered over, the light was atrocious, rendering it
practically impossible to study some of the rarer exhibits as
one would have wished to have done.
Once more this Society has shown that it is possible to have
a great exhibition in the middle of the week, without intruding
on the sanctity of Sunday.

Of the British birds I did not take mucli notice, for I did
not know that I sliould have to write about them ; and I spent
most of my time -- all too little -- among the foreigners ; however,
as our Hun. Secretary proposes writing about the latter, for the
sufficient reason that he had not time to look at the former at all,
I must just do my best.
For many years of my life I studied British birds in their
natural haunts, and likewise as pets -- I lived among the birds.
As pets, some are incomparable ; but pets are one thing,
common species as show-birds quite and altogether another.
Then some that are beautiful when wild are comparatively
despicable as show-birds. What more beautiful in the wild state
than a pair of Bullfinches and the male Blackbird ! but over the
dowdy creatures at a show I cannot get up any interest. And
concerning those that do not materially lose their colours : I
would infinitely rather see them in the fields and pastures.
The Goldfinch, Bullfinch, Linnet, Siskin Redpoll and Twite,
classes I &amp;quot;passed by on the other side.&amp;quot; It is curious that in
class 87, &amp;quot; Any other variety of Finch or Bunting,&amp;quot; although I
simply strolled down the line without a thought of awards (for I
went to look at the birds, not to criticise the judging), only five
caught my eye, and I now observe that four of these gained the
first four prizes. I admired Mr. Raine&amp;apos;s Hawfinch as much as I
condemned its owner for placing such a comparatively large bird
in so small a cage. Miss Benbow came second with a large,
tight, not very bright. Greenfinch, a bird always associated in
my mind with supper for the many Hawks of my early days. Mr.
LfOtt came next with a very large Chaffinch, and Mr. Allen fourth
with a nice Snow Bunting. I have a note of faint praise against
Mr. Jones&amp;apos; Reed Bunting, which probably I looked at as being
less common than the majority of the very common birds of
which the class was composed.
Against only one bird in the Lark class have I a note --
against Mr. and Mrs. Vincent&amp;apos;s young Wood Lark, a very
favourite bird of mine, and always interesting as being the onlj^
bird in this country that sings on the wing at night. I dare
say the Blackbirds, Starlings, and Thrushes in class 89 were all
right-- indeed, I am convinced that they must have been ; but
somehow against only one of the whole lot have I a note, against
Mr. Kneen&amp;apos;s well marked Thrush (2nd) ; nevertheless I am
rather suspicious of the Show Thrush, as it is a bird not always
innocent of colour-food. Classes 90 and 96 (Migratory, and
small Inse(ftivorous) were more interesting ; the former con-

tained over 40 birds ; but to my mind the general quality of the
exhibits was poor, and some were poorly. Notwithstanding the
excellency of Mr. Maxwell&amp;apos;s bird (ist, in the large class) --
and Mr. Frostick&amp;apos;s (1243) was not bad -- the sight of so many
(seven) Swallows in show-cages was sickening ; at least one
succumbed during the show. There were an unusual number of
White-throats, I^esser White-throats, and Chiffchaffs, difficult
birds to keep for a long season ; and none were in good form.
The various Wagtails did not come out nearly so well as one
occasionally sees them ; but the Redstarts and Redwings were
looking smart, and should not have been so severely let alone by
the Judge, Mr. Erskine&amp;apos;s Redstart alone getting V.H.C. There
were three fairly good Ring Ouzels ; and Mr. Lowne obtained
a second with a good Wheatear, Messrs. Fulljames and Philips
likewise exhibiting satisf^^ictory specimens. A solitary Fieldfare
was ignored ; it was not a well coloured bird, but, for a caged
Fieldfare, was in good plumage. Mr. Poynter&amp;apos;s Wren declined
to be interviewed, for which I was really very sorry ; Mr. Wells&amp;apos;
Great Tit treated me with like discourtesy (both gentlemen had
humanely supplied a shelter for their exhibits), and Mr.
Dewhurst&amp;apos;s would have done ditto if it had not been in such
a miserable cage that escape was impossible. Two of the much
rarer Crested Tits appear in the catalogue, but I remember
seeing but one, and that looked sickly ; the other may have been
present ; but several exhibits which appeared before the Judge
were not apparent on Wednesday. A Nuthatch seemed contem-
plating suicide, and likewise two unfortunate Spotted Fly-
catchers ; how dull and spiritless they were compared with the
wild bird ! The Nightingales were not much, and one looked
remarkably like a Sprosser. Mr. Dewhurst&amp;apos;s Greenshank
appeared in good order, and might have been noticed -- for it is a
much more suitable bird for a show than a Swallow or even than
a Spotted Flycatcher. Two Robins and a Blackcap about complete
the list of species exhibited in these interesting classes.
In the Rare-feathered class, I should like to have seen Miss
Martin&amp;apos;s striking Fawn Starling placed first ; it was, if anything,
in better condition, and is of a rarer colour, than Mr. Herbert&amp;apos;s
White Blackbird. Mr. Prior&amp;apos;s Pied Blackbird (3rd) was a hand-
somely-marked specimen. I have a moderately favourable note
against Mr. Hiscock&amp;apos;s Drab Greenfinch (5th), but do not remem-
ber the bird. I think there were eight birds in the class when I
passed it ; and to give six &amp;quot; prizes &amp;quot; under such circumstances
is not prize giving at all, unless the birds are of exceptional
merit, which the Cinnamon Chaffinch (4th) and Cinnamon Star-

ling (6th) did not appear to my eyes to be. Only six prizes were
given in class 90. Besides, First in a class of eight or nine
(classes 88, 91, and 93) shorild not be placed on a level with First
in a class of forty-four. Both in my notes and in my memory,
Mr. Taylor&amp;apos;s White Linnet (H.C.) and Messrs. Kilbury&amp;apos;s White
Siky Lark (V.H.C.) have become mixed. I think they ^were both
good birds in bad plumage.
In the A. O, V. class, I do not know if there has been a
mixing up of the names, the numbers, or of my brains, but the
Missel Thrush, which I took to be Mr. Wilson&amp;apos;s (C), was far
superior to its neighbour (2nd), and should have been placed in
a much better position; but, perhaps, it was not &amp;quot;steady&amp;quot;
enough to please the judge ; some judges seem to prefer a steady,
lifeless bird to a lively, vigorous one. The Magpies and Jays
were scarcely up to the mark ; but the two Great Spotted Wood-
peckers were moderately good.
The only class that now remains for me to deal with, that for
&amp;quot;Any Variety of Rare Continental Bird,&amp;quot; should have a place in
every large Exhibition, and I hope to see it at the Palace in the
future, although the word &amp;quot;rare&amp;quot; is quite out of place. In this
class there appeared two good specimens of my favourite Pied
Rockthrush, Mr. Fulljames&amp;apos; taking the first prize, Mr. Frostick&amp;apos;s
the third. Two Blue-throated Warblers were announced in the
catalogue, and both &amp;quot; exhibits &amp;quot; seem to have been before the
judge, but no such bird was visible when I paid my first visit to
the show, i.e., on the Wednesday. These charming but delicate
pets are not fit for show life : why cannot exhibitors be satisfied
with the many robust species ! Cage 1209 had disappeared, but
eage 1208 had not. In it, however, instead of a Bluebreast, I
found a Blue Rockthrush (2nd), a good specimen ; but it is a far
easier species to keep in health than the Pied Rockthrush. Mr.
Lowne&amp;apos;s Ortolan Bunting (4th) should have been placed in class
S7. Concerning the Eastern Nightingale, known in this country
by the rather misleading name of Greater Nightingale^ and in,
Germany by the handy name of Sprosser, it was some two or
three years ago that it was brought under my notice that a few
were being exhibited as British ; but I must add that, as I know
to my cost, not every bird that is sold as a Sprosser is a Sprosser.
I have such an one now, -- as honest a Western Nightingale as
ever was hatched. Mr. Fulljames&amp;apos; bird was certainly a Sprosser,
but I am not so sure about No. 1212, not so sure by a long way
as I am of the bird in. class 90 which I have already referred to;
but the two species are difficult to distinguish in a bad light.

~ I have never yet seen a building perfedlly adapted for;
a bird-show, but of all&amp;apos; unsuitable places the , Westminster &amp;apos;
Aquarium is the worst. , The light is extremely bad in the&amp;apos;
da^^time ; the atmosphere loaded with tobacco-smoke is most
oflfensive to non-smokers (in whicli class the birds must bei;
included) ; and the fadl that a variety entertainmeut is going on^
upon the stage in the centre of the hall all the afternoon does&amp;apos;
not (to put it mildly) assist one&amp;apos;s quiet enjoyment of the birds. &amp;apos;
Still, in spite of the noise, the smoke, and the dim light, the &amp;apos;I
Aquarium Show of November 1897 was well worth a visit ; for *
the collection of birds has, possibly, never been excelled for&amp;apos;
rarity and interest. . . ^
In numbers alone the Show was a notable one, there bein^,
193 entries of foreign birds. . &amp;quot;
:The Glass for Rare Continental Birds is a capital idea and
contained some very interesting birds, including a. Blue Rock,,
Thrush, two Pied Rock Thrushes, and two specimens ai Daulias
jZi/zz7(7w^^/," (one entered as a Greater&amp;apos; Nightingale the other as a.
Sprosser). The &amp;quot;Blue Rock Thrush was catalogued as a &amp;quot;Blue=-,^
throated Warbler.&amp;quot; There was al^so an Ortolan Bunting in this,
class^this spepies is a fairly frequent visitor to our shores and is&amp;quot;
recognised as British bj^ the Avicultural Society.
\0x25A0 It is not my intention to give anything like a detailed,&amp;apos;
report of the Show and I shall, therefore, pass over in silence &amp;gt;
tlie class for Amazons and Grey Parrots, and come to the more
interesting cla;ss for Macaws, Cockatoos and Parrots (other than. &amp;gt;
Amazons and :Greys) including &amp;quot;Loreys,&amp;quot; (as the catalogue haS-
it). Here were several birds well worth a long journey to see. 1
The gem 6f thfe collection was, I think, the beautiful Hawk-
Beaded Parrot exhibited by Mr. Maxwell. Mr. Fulljames&amp;apos; &amp;apos;
Hyaciiithine Macaw, which took first prize, was in fine con-.,
ditiou, -but appeared to&amp;apos; nie to be rather smaller than other. &amp;quot;
specimens which I have seen, and in rarity it scarcely equals the.
Hawk-headed &amp;apos;l^arrot. The Spix Macaw was- unfortunately in .
ratkerjSoor feather. The two Ganga Cockatoos, .Sent by. different&amp;apos;
exhibitors, were a pair ; and visitors to the Show had, therefore, &amp;apos;,
atn&amp;apos;opportuhity&amp;apos; of observing the striking difference between the^
sexes lit this* &amp;apos;reire Species&amp;apos; (the female lacks the red head .and!
crest which are the distinguishing features of the male). The

pair of Meyer&amp;apos;s Parrot&amp;apos;S&amp;apos;WeTe charming little birds, but their fails *
were very rough. The Bronze-wing Parrot was quite new to me-^.:
is this the same as the Dusky Parrot (^Pioiuis violaceus) ? A Blue-:;
eyed Cockatoo, a Blood-stained Cockatoo, two Senegal Parrotsjj
two or three Macaws of common species, a Purple-capped Lory,.^^
aiid&amp;apos; another Lory (I thihk Eos reticulata&amp;apos;), made up a class oft
ndost unusual merit. The Blue-streaked (or Reticulated) lyoryi-
had nothing to eat but canary seed and dry bread, and wasr
evidently starving^ -- probably it died before the Show was over.
The Class for Budgisrigars Love Birds and Pigmy Parrots
contained nothiiig of special interest except two pairs of Blue-
crowned Hanging Parrots. &amp;apos; -^ !-
The Class for Parrakeets and Lorikeets contained many&amp;apos;
good birds. It included a Blue-bonnet, two pairs of Lineolated &amp;apos;
Parrakeets, a pair of Orange - flanked Parrakeets {BrotogeryT
pyrrhopteriLs), two pairs of Man57--coloureds, and a Turquoisin^,&amp;apos;
not to , mention several commoner species. Of the Lorikeets,
onh^ the Ornamented and Forsten&amp;apos;s were represented. The&amp;apos;
Purple-breasted Lory was in the wrong class but, nevertheless/&amp;apos;
got a prize. &amp;apos; &amp;apos;\0x25A0
In the Class for Waxbills, Mannikins and Combasous, Mr., ,
Maxwell&amp;apos;s lovely pair of Violet-eared Waxbills were most
deservedly first. The third prize, went to a pair of Mannikins,
which I could not identify. There were also Aprora Finches,
Cordon. Bleus, Crimson Flinches, a cock African Fire Finch^
(rarely seen at a Show), Green Avadavats and Magpie Mannikins.
A good -Class, but not equal in interest to the Parrot Classes.,
The Class for Weavers and Whydahs comprised a Crimsons-
throated Whydah and a Long-tailed Whydah along with somSr
common species. , - .:
^ &amp;apos; &amp;apos; The&amp;apos; Class for &amp;quot;Any. other variety of- seed-eating birds &amp;apos;V
(Why &amp;quot;-variety,&amp;quot; by theway?) was of great merit, and contained,
34 entries. Apparently the Judge did not consider it to be part!,
of his duty to disqualify birds in the wrong class, and under theC
circumstances I am not surprised at this : for to do so he would:
have had to draw a hard and. fast line between the Grassfinches&amp;quot;
and the other PloxeidcB with nothing in the Schedule to g-uide.

The- result, however, was that birds of the same genus were.^
allowed ,to compete in different Classes -- the Class now Underi&amp;apos;

third and fourth, Gouldian Finches fifth, and a male Cuba Finch
sixth. Mr. Cushny&amp;apos;s Citril Finch ought not to have been passed
unnoticed, and Mr. Maxwell&amp;apos;s Mexican Siskin deserved more
than a V.H.C. The Diuca Buntings, also, v^^ere v^^orthy of
a card, at least. All the prizes, except the sixth, were awarded
to Grassfinches -- which was rather hard on the Finches. The
millet seed with which the Mexican Siskin was supplied was a
most unsuitable tliet for the little fellow.
Insectivorous or Fruit-eating Birds, larger than a Blue
Robin. -- The first prize was awarded to a splendid Green-crested
Touracou, the second to a Toco Toucan, the third to a pair of
Lettered Aracari, the fourth to a beautiful Andaman Starling,
the fifth to a Purple-headed Glossy Starling, and the sixth to
a Malabar Starling. A Blue-winged Green Bulbul was V.H.C.
-- why will the owner of this bird persist in calling it a &amp;quot; Blue-
winged Sugar-bird &amp;quot; ?
Insectivorous or Fruit-eating Birds, not larger than a Blue
Robin. -- This was a splendid Class. The judging which gave
the first prize to a Superb Tanager over the heads of so many
rare birds was, to say the least, eccentric. I do not profess to
know the species of Mr, Maxwell&amp;apos;s bird (entered as a Blue- faced
Tanager) which was placed second, but it was a lovely bird in
perfect condition, and probably&amp;apos; the first of its kind which has
been shown in England. The third prize-winner much re-
sembled the female Dacnis cayana, but had blue on the breast as
well as on the head. A Tri-coloured Tanager was fourth ; a pair
of Fuscous Honey-eaters fifth, and a Violet Tanager sixth. The
Class also contained a nice pair of Zosterops and some good
Tanagers of various common species. A Pileated Finch should
have been &amp;quot;wrong-classed.&amp;quot;
The Members&amp;apos; Classes presented rather a mixture, but there
were several entries of great merit. Among them I must
specially mention Mr. Maxwell&amp;apos;s pair of Violet Tanagers (the
hen being seldom imported) and Mr. Fulljames&amp;apos; Golden-crowned
New Zealand Parrakeets {^Cyanorhamphus auriceps). These last-
named birds were catalogued as &amp;quot; New Zealand Parrakeets,&amp;quot; a
name usually reserved for the commoner and less attractive C
novcB-zealayidics. Mr. Frostick&amp;apos;s Bulbul took my fancy greatly.
He calls it a Persian Bulbul -- is this the same as the Syrian
Bulbul, and, again, is the Scinde Bulbul the same or a different
bird ?* I must confess that the Bulbuls are beyond me, though
* The Syrian Bulbul {P. xanthopygus) is perfectly distinct from the Persian, but
the latter occurs at Scinde, where liowever it is smaller, and not so good a singer as
the Persian bird.-- A. G. B, ^

they are not quite so confusing as the different species of
Zosterops.
It was a splendid Show, and its splendour was entirely
due to two exhibitors (Mr. Fulljames and Mr. Maxwell) who
sent about 45 entries each in the Foreign Classes, and one or
the other of whom was the owner of almost every rare and
interesting: exhibit in those Classes.
CORRESPONDENCE.
THE QUAKER PARRAKEET.
Sir, -- I shall be very grateful for information in answer to the follow-,
iug queries :--
Is the Quaker Parrakeet known by any other name ? The Colour ?
Size ? And locality ?
I have had the offer of one, but having never had the &amp;quot; Quaker
Parrakeet,&amp;quot; I am quite in the dark,
M. Husband,
The folloimjig reply was sent to Miss Husband :
The Grey-breasted Parrakeet (Myopsittacus jnonachusj is very common-
ly known as the Quaker Parrakeet. It conies from Argentina, Bolivia,
Paraguay, and Uruguay, is a common bird, and is usually obtainable for
a few shillings.
Speaking generally, the upper parts are green, wings mostly blue,
while the upper parts of the head, the cheeks, throat, and breast, are grey ;
and the under parts are yellowish-green.
Notwithstanding their plain colour, I have seen real beauties ; but
too often they are nothing to look at. They are naturally very sociable;
and, when made pets of, especially if there be only one, they will usually
lavish their love of companionship upon their owners. They are hardy,
and may be taught to talk a little ; but they bear a bad character for
screaming, especially when kept in a cage, and are not general favourites.
To aviculturists, however, they are intensely interesting from the
circumstance that, unlike any other known member of the Parrot order,
they build nests, not of strips of bark, in holes, like the Lovebirds (see our
Magazine, Vol. II, pp, 49 and 128), but of sticks at the top of tall trees..
They have not infrequently built nests in captivity.
Including the tail, the Quaker Parrakeet is about iij inches long-- *
roughly speaking, of the size of a Turtle Dove.

BIRD CAIvLS.
Sir, -- Can any member help me to identify two calls heard in August,
this year ? One was &amp;quot;te-te-te,&amp;quot; uttered rapidly in a long series without
^variation. It was heard for about a week in the neighbourhood of ni}&amp;apos;

FOOD FOR THE PIN-TAILED NONPAREIL.

Sir, -- It has alwaj&amp;apos;s been insisted on that, when first imported,
*^rj&amp;apos;/A/-?^/rt^njjzV^" requires paddy-rice (its natural food) in order to bring it
into condition.
On the 19th of February, 1897, I purchased a pair of this species and
was much exercised in my mind as to what I should do, owing to the utter
impossibility of obtaining rice in the ear. I had tried everywhere and
could not get even a sample of this seed. I even asked a friend to enquire
at the docks, but he told me he could not get it, as the demand for it was
insufficient to induce the importers to ship it to England.
Suddenly it occurred to me these birds might possiblj&amp;apos; be induced to
accept oats as a substitute. The result was most satisfactory ; the oats were
eaten with relish and, I believe, with better effect. My hen was out of
&amp;apos;-health when I purchased her, unable to reach her perch excepting by
clambering up the wires ; but she gained strength and, for several month.s;
manaoed to fly up to roost ; then again she became weak, and in August
she died.
The cock bird got well through its autumn moult, and is still in fine
^condition and perfect plumage.
I now use oats instead of paddy-rice for all rice-eating birds, and find
them to do better on them: this is not surprising; for there can be no
doubt that the former seed is far more sustaining and nutritious than the
latter.

Sir,-- I see in the November No. some remarks by Mr. Perkins on
the smaller Warblers. As I have only kept four soft-food birds in my life,
jny observations must be taken with great reserve.
Supposing insects are essential, are there not dried mosquitoes sold
(from Germany) .which might do ?
But are insects essential .? Some 40 years ago, I think, there were
some very interesting articles on the management of Nightingales, etc., by
vSergeant lEanly, of the 2nd Life Guards, in the Fkld. Sergeant Hanly had
succeeded in breeding Nightingales in a breeding-cage. His diet was lean
i-aw beef pounded with yolk of hard-boiled ^^^. Is it certain that in
confinement the natural food is best ?
The Blue Mountain L,ory, the late Mr. Jamrach told me, could never
be kept as long as they tried to feed it on lione_v and other soft food. It
&amp;gt;vas not till they put it entirely on to seed that they were successful.
After that, they were imported in large numbers without risk.
Again, the Tui bird -- a great honey-eater -- Mr. Abrahams told me that
to give them honey was fatal. It nia}^ not be so, but an acquaintance of
mine -would give his birds honey, and in that case the result predicted by
Mr. Abrahams at once followed. The bird was seized with fits and died.
It appears to do well fed on biscuit and condensed milk ; or on boiled
mashed potato -- both articles which are very far removed from the natural
food.
I would humbly suggest that someone should tr}- the raw beef and
egg regimen with the smaller Warblers.
I cannot say that Mr. Perkins&amp;apos; dietarj&amp;apos; sounds a likely one. An aviary
jiiay have something to do with the ill-success. Many birds might do well
in a cage that would die in an aviary.
F. G. DUTTON.
I full3^ agree with the main point in Mr. Dutton&amp;apos;s letter, viz., that the
natural food of a bird in a state of freedom is not necessarily that which is&amp;apos;
best suited to maintain it in health in captivity.
With regard to dried mosquitoes (or flies), it seems to be generally&amp;apos;
recognised that their food value is inferior to that of ants&amp;apos; eggs, and that
they are useful only as affording a variety and-(possibly) a cheaper food.
Witii all respect to the memory of the late Mr. Jamrach, I feel bound
to point out that the notion that Lorikeets should be fed on seed is now
almost exploded. They live well enough on biscuit soaked in boiled milk,
and fruit, &amp;apos; with a little seed. Doubtless they can be made to live on seed&amp;apos;
alone, someti-mes for a good long time, but it is no more a proper diet for
tiiem than bread-crumbs and hempseed are for a Robin. Of course, biscuit&amp;quot;
and milk are quite .as unnatural a food for Lorikeets as seed is, so that this
in &amp;apos;no way weakeiis Mr. Dutton&amp;apos;s argument.
If condensed milk agrees so well with Tuis, it seems strange that
lioney should be fatal to them-- for the only way in which honey could
affect them injuriously would, I suppose, be by causing excessive fatness
and thus producing fits. But condensed milk is nearly as sweet as honey,

<bodyText confidence="0.986592234042553" page_id="32635473"  page_num="40" year="" vol="">
and therefore, one would imagine, almost as fat-producing. I am not
striving to throw a doubt on the fact that honey is bad for captive Tuis, for
that seems fairly well established, but only wondering why it should be so,
I do not share Mr. Perkins&amp;apos; high opinion of egg as a food for soft-
bills. It is certainly very nourishing, but I fancy it is not always easily
digested. And there is such a thing as giving too many mealworms.
&amp;quot;Will Mr. Button kindly tell us which are the birds that do better in a
cage than in an aviary ? I have never found this to be so with any which I
have kept.
I have heard it hinted that if the sinaller Warblers are to be kept at
all they must be fed largely on gentles. But, as it has been well expressed,
&amp;quot; a bird which can only be kept on gentles is not worth keeping at all.&amp;quot;
Horatio R. Fii^IvMEr,
[Further correspondence on this subject of &amp;quot; Food for Soft-billed Birds&amp;quot; is invited. Th^
greatest diversity of treatment prevails, and all members who have successfully
kept the rarer or more delicate species, whether British or foreign, are urged to
state the food which they have found to be, in their experience, the best. -- Bd.] -
THE NOMENCIvATURE OF FOREIGN DOVES.
Sir, -- Considerable confusion exists with regard to the correct names
of many foreign Doves.
In 1894 I obtained a pair of Turtles, the name of which I was
ignorant of at the time. I subsequently found that at the Zoological Gardens
the species was labelled &amp;quot; Vinaceous Turtle-dove.&amp;quot; I, therefore, since then
have always referred to these Doves by the above name.
This pair has been in my possession since the spring of the above
year, and I have sent their young to aviculturists in various parts of the
country, always under the above name ; so that the species is known thus
to several aviculturists.
Another, somewhat larger bird with a black ring on its neck, some-
what resembling a large Barbary Dove, has for years been named the
&amp;quot; Cambayan Turtle &amp;quot; by the Zoological Society.
It appears however that the above learned Society have now dis-
covered that they have been confusing the two species ; and they are now
labelling the two species vice-versa. My birds are, therefore, Cambayau
Turtle-doves fT. senegalensis) .
The true Tiutur vinaceus is considerably larger than the Barbary
Dove, which species it closely resembles, although somewhat browner in
colour. It is often confounded with the Half-Collared Turtle (Turtur
semitorquatusj , a species slightly smaller than the Barbary Dove. *
The true Turtur senegalensis has no ring on the neck. It is of a
ruddy pink hue, with small black niarkings on the throat. The rump and
wing coverts are of a delicate bluish grey.
D. Sfth-SmiTh. .
* This is certainly incorrect : for Covnit Salvadori (the greatest authority on the
Cohimboz, gives the total length of Turtur semiforquaius as 12.4 inches, and that or
T. rixorius as about 10 inches. These measurements are borne out by the skins iii the
British Museum and specimens which I have kept of both.-- A. G. B.

THE BRONZE-WINGED PIGEON.
fPhaps chalcoptera) .

Of colours less startling than many of tlie feathered
inhabitants of the Australian groves, the members of the Pigeon
tribe, one and all, from the magnificent Crowned Pigeon to
the tiny Diamond Dove, are unsurpassed for quiet beauty of
plumage and gracefulness of shape and bearing.
In most parts of that Island-continent, so rich in feathered
gems, the Bronze- wing abounds, and is sometimes seen in large
numbers feeding on the stubble-fields ; or from a distance the
mournful love-note of the male is heard, as, with expanded
crop and bowed head, he flaps his jewelled wings to attradt the
attention of his mate.
During the dry season, we are told that numbers of
Bronze-wings may be observed, towards evening, winging their
way, with arrow-like flight, towards some distant pool. The
thirsty traveller notes the direction of their flight, knowing full
well that by careful observation of the habits of these birds he
may be able to find water to refresh himself and his steed.
In a wild state. Bronze-wings are said to nest from August
to December.
Selby tells us that &amp;quot; It breeds in holes or decayed stumps
of trees near the ground, and not unfrequently upon the surface
of the earth itself.&amp;quot; This statement is evidently far from
correct, for in captivity the highest available position is always
chosen for a nest, which is built preferably in the open.
Of the foreign members of the Dove tribe, the Bronze-
wing is one of the best known, but is, nevertheless, by no means
frequently met with in living colledlions at home. Why this
should be is not clear, seeing that the species possesses so many
attractive qualities. It is easily tamed, quite hardy, very

beautiful, and, as will be hereafter shown, a free breeder in
captivit}^
Those of our members who possess the old Jardine&amp;apos;s
Naturalists&amp;apos; lyibrary will be familiar with a life-like illustration
of a cock Bronze-wing, which gives a ver}^ fair idea of the
general appearance of the bird.
In size it nearly equals the English Ringdove ( Cohunba
pahimbzcsj. The plumage of the male is chiefly of a mottled
brown on the upper parts, which, in some lights, presents a
greenish tint. The breast is a very delicate vinous pink, which
shades into purplish blue on the sides of the neck. A well
defined white line encircles the eye and extends backwards
towards the nape. The tail is blue-grey, and the under wing-
coverts orange.
It is in the wings that the great beauty of the species lies.
These present in the sunlight the most exquisite tints -- the
sapphire, rub}^, and opal all being in turn refledted.
The hen closely resembles her mate but is of more
slender build, and the colours on the wing-coverts are less
brilliant and of a greener tint. She lacks also the forehead
markings of the cock.^*
I obtained a cock Bronze-wing on the 2Sth of May, 1896.
He had just arrived from Tasmania, and was somewhat rough
in feather although otherwise i n good condition. He soon
became quite tame, and, until a short time ago, remained a
bachelor in my aviar}^ He never interfered in the least with
the other occupants of his domain, some of which were Doves
of various species -- and Doves are not usually the most peace-
able of birds.
In August last, I received a note from a dealer, to the
effedl that he had a hen Bronze-wing for sale ; and, accordingly,
I lost no time in providing my old bachelor with a wife. She
was rather wild at first, but, as is the nature of her species, very
soon became tame. The cock seemed very anxious to commence
housekeeping; he would fly up on to an old basket-lid that was
fixed to some branches, and there he would remain, son;etimes
for hours together, cooing and gently flapping his wings. At
the end of September, a slight nest of twigs was formed on the
top of the aforesaid basket-lid. All the nesting-material was
carried up by the cock, the hen merely placing it in position.
The pair took turns in the tedious process of incubation, the
cock sitting during the greater part of the day, and the hen
* Consisting- of a large patch of buff. -- A. G. B.

at night ; and, although the weather became very cold -- the
thermometer falling almost to freezing-point on two or three
occasions -- the first egg was successfully hatched on the loth of
Odlober, the second youngster leaving the shell two days later.
The old birds proved most devoted parents, never allowing
their charges to be uncovered. Had they been less attentive to
their young, the latter must have succumbed in a very short
time to the cold. The young birds left the nest when just over
two weeks old, but were fed by their parents until they had
attained the age of six&amp;apos; weeks or more.
The 3^oung closely resembled their parents fi&amp;apos;om the first,
but the wing-markings were less distinct. The cock showed
clearly the burnt-sienna on the forehead when still in the nest.
I consider Bronze-wings the most attractive of the larger
of the foreign Doves. They are of a tame nature, and do not
knock themselves about when one enters the aviary, as do many
of the Dove tribe. Mine are fed upon canary and millet seed,
and a little hemp occasionally.
There is a closely allied species, the Phaps elegans, or
Opaline Pigeon, which is not uncommon in manj^ parts of
Australia ; but I have never seen it offered for sale, neither is
it represented in the Zoological Gardens. It would doubtless
be a most desirable species for aviculturists. It is of a richer
brown than, and in many respects closely resembles, its
congener.

SOME RARE BUNTINGS.

By R. A. Todd.
I have recently acquired three Finches not often met with
in captivit}^ regarding which some notes may be of interest to
members of the Society.
The most conspicuous is the Towhee or so-called Red Kyed
Ground Finch of North America (Pipilo erythrophthahnus) . In
colour it is curiously similar to the Shama ; the head, back and
wings, deep glossy black ; chest, breast and abdomen, white ;
sides, bright chestnut ; tail, black, the outer feathers being white
on the outer side. The hen is brownish where the cock is black.
Size rather over seven inches, including tail, which is over three
inches long. Dr. Sharpe places this species among the Buntings,
but the position is not unquestioned. The name is derived from
the cry very frequently uttered by the cock, and is a very close
imitation of it. The bird is undoubtedly pugnacious, and should
only be associated with others of its own size. It takes readily

to the usual seeds, but I think is largely insectivorous, as it is
always eager for mealworms, and will consume a considerable
quantity of egg food and ants&amp;apos; eggs. I do not find that it remains
on the ground more than other finches, rather the contrary, and
in this respecft the English name does not seem justified ; the
eyes in my birds are distindtly not red but brown, which is
described as a feature of the immature bird. When on the
ground it frequently scratches like the Combassou, and if its
food be placed in an open pan will at once scatter the whole of
it over the floor of the aviary.^&amp;apos; It will, no doubt, be perfectly
hardy in our climate.
The White-throated Song Sparrow f Zo7iotrichia albicollis),
also a native of the Eastern United States, is a trifle larger than
the Chingolo Song Sparrow, the tail in particular being longer and
more graceful. The general colour is a greyish-brown, mottled
with black centres to the feathers ; the most distindtive features
are the white throat, from which the species takes its name, and
a dash of 5^ellow over the lores. The hen has hardly a trace of
the yellow dash, her throat being greyish, and the breast mottled
very like a thrush. My birds have so far hardly uttered a sound,
but I suppose they would naturally not sing in the winter. They
are even fonder of mealworms than the Towhee, and will
pluckily snatch one out of the very beak of a much larger bird.
They appear to be far bolder in character than their Chingolo
relative, which with me has always shown a most retiring disposi-
tion, usually hiding in a corner of the aviary during the middle
of the day, though fairly active in the morning and afternoon,
but even then rarely bold enough to come forward for a meal-
worm .
The third species I had some difficulty in identifying ; it is
not always easy to make out an obscure bii&amp;apos;d from scientific
descriptions. It is the &amp;quot; Eittle Sparrow &amp;quot; Bunting {Spizella
pusilla), also from North America. The total length is less than
five inches, of which over two inches are taken up by the tail.
The general colour is rather bright brown with darker centres to
the feathers, the under parts being decidedly paler ; the very short
conical beak and legs are pinkish. There seems to be no
difference between the sexes. In my bird the right wing is
almost entirely white, no doubt a case of albinism. Like the
White-throated Song Sparrow he is very partial to mealworms.
I have as yet observed no peculiarity in his habits.
* This habit of scratching like a Combassou is characteristic of the 80115 Sparrows,
and therefore confirmatory of its position among tlie Buntings.-- A. G. B.

Of all the Parrakeets I have kept, the subject of the
present notice stands highest in my estimation.
Its amiable disposition, its lively and active habits, and
its not unmusical voice, together with its soft colours, would
attract all lovers of the Parrakeet family. In size, the Golden-
crown compares favourably with the Turquoisine, but is much
stouter in build ; the beak is ver}&amp;apos; long and sharp, and of a
bluish-slate colour with a black tip, and the lower mandible
dark brown. A band of bright crimson surrounds the upper
mandible, which extends to the eye. From the band of crimson
to the crown of the head is a patch of golden yellow; the iris
is a brilliant crimson ; the back and the wings are of a dark
bluish-green colour, and the front edges of the latter are a
bright blue ; the tail is dark bluish-green ; all the under parts
are of a yellowish-green colour. On the body under each wing
is a patch of bright red. The legs are long and grey ; the claws
long and black. There appears to be no difference in the sexes,
except that the female is about a third smaller than her mate ;
at least, such is the difference in size between the one female
and the male birds which I possess.
The habits of my Golden-crowned Parrakeets are very
interesting. They are remarkably tame, and, although so
recently imported, will come quite close to me while feeding.
When first introduced into my aviary, hardly two months ago,
they made themselves at home and behaved as if they had
been there all their lives. The long legs of this bird enable it
to run and hop with great freedom, and it has the peculiar
habit of scratching on the ground, after the manner of our
common poultry. It is never tired of either running, hopping,
or flying about and uttering its song (if such it can be called),
and at such times it will stretch itself out with a forward
motion, and then it is that the Golden-crown really looks at its
best: for while it is singing, the dilating of the eye goes on
and the iris becomes like a ball of fire. They are particularly
fond of their bath -- they quite drench themselves through, and
then fly to the nearest branch to dry. Although their beaks are
so long and sharp, yet they are very gentle. My Turquoisines

and even Budgerigars frequently drive them away if they
approach them whilst feeding.
During their short residence in my aviary one of the
cocks has paired with the hen, and on the 24th October (exactly
seven weeks after date of arrival) the hen bird laid her first
egg; and on the 28th she was closely sitting on five pure
white eggs.
If any young are reared, I will ask you to let me record
the fact.

Dr. Carl Russ says of Tanagers : -- &amp;quot;They have no true
song, only low harsh unpleasant sounds,&amp;quot; and, because he
regards the Violet Tanager as an exception to this rule, he
adopts for it the name of &amp;apos;&amp;apos;The Common Organist&amp;quot; or
&amp;quot; Whistler,&amp;quot; yet he says that it is &amp;quot; decidedly not a superior
songster,&amp;quot; although Mr. Abrahams pronounces it &amp;quot; a magnificent
songster.&amp;quot;
Undoubtedly the renowned German aviculturist is,
generally speaking, a very trustworthy guide in the treatment
of birds ; and what he tells us of their habits rightl}^ commands
our respect ; but, when we consider that none of his Tanagers
lived long ; that, by his own admission, they were invariably
dirty, greed}^, and abominably stupid, it stands to reason that we
must accept his statements respecting their vocal acquirements
C2WZ grano salis.
The Tanagers being intermediate in structure and in
nidification between Finches and Warblers, it would be a curious
fact, if it were a fact, that all, with the exception of the species
of Euphonia, were songless.
A German lady, Mrs. A. Musil, stated that her Scarlet
Tanager uttered &amp;quot;clear Thrush-like sounds and a beautiful soft
song, rich in variations, somewhat resembling that of the Robin,&amp;quot;
and Dr. Russ quoted the statement with a note of interrogation,
yet he does not appear to have attempted to investigate the
matter for himself. When I have kept my two fine males long
enough for them to become confiding, perhaps they will give me
an opportunity of forming an opinion respecting the merit of
their performance.
My Superb Tanager, which I purchased on May 28th, 1897,

question, the healthiest and most intelligent representative ot
its species which I have hitherto seen. Soon after I became
possessed of it, this bird, in addition to its bright excited chirp,
uttered a number of harsh Weaver-like notes which I took to be
its song ; but, this morning (December 6th, 1897), when my birds
were just beginning to rouse from their long winter-night&amp;apos;s,
sleep,-&amp;apos;&amp;apos; I heard what sounded like the recorded song of the
Indigo-Bunting (a bird which I do not at present possess) ; this
was immediately followed by three excited chirps, which I at
once recognized as uttered by the Superb Tanager.
The bird was sitting quietly at the end of his perch
farthest from the front, and, as I watched, he again sang the
same thin though cheerful little song, ending with the same
chirping notes twice more ; after which he stretched himself,
first his legs and then his wings, hopped a little way along his
upper perch, then flew to the lower one, and so down again to
his food saucer, snatched a morsel of ^%% and returned to the
lower perch to eat it ; he is anything but a greedy bird.

Most aviculturists can only devote a stridlly limited time
each day to the care of their birds, and it therefore becomes
ahnost a necessity for them to have such arrangements in their
bird-rooms as will enable them to quickly perform the work of
feeding and cleaning. In a bird-room well-stocked with proper
appliances, attending to the birds is a pleasure ; but in a bird-
room where nothing can be found wlien it is wanted, and where
every article in use is badly adapted for its purpose, the work
soon becomes a weariness, and often, in the end, the birds are
got rid of in disgust. My present purpose is to describe briefly
some appliances which I have found useful, and which I can
recommend to others.
Every bird-room should have an inner door, consisting of
a wooden frame covered with wire netting -- this allows the outer
door to be left open for ventilation without risk of the escape of
birds or the entrance of cats. For the same reason, the windows
should be covered with netting, and also the opening of the

fire-place. If the netting be placed outside the windows, the
sashes can be raised and lowered just as if it were not there, but
there is the risk that birds may injure themselves against the
glass. There really ought to be netting both outside and inside,
that on the inside being stretched on a light moveable frame-
work. It is not safe to have it only inside, for you are sure,
some day, to forget to replace the frame after opening the
window, and then, if a bird escape from cage or aviary, off he
goes !
A small sink in the bird-room is a great convenience, and
those who have experienced the comfort of it would never be
without one. The most suitable kind is made of earthenware,
is nearly a foot in depth, and is furnished with a brass plug so
that the water can be made to stand in it. If a supply of hot
water as well as cold can be arranged, the soft-food vessels need
not be taken out of the room to be cleaned. The wall behind the
sink should be covered with glazed tiles or sheet lead, to protedl
it from the splashing of the water, (a piece of gutta percha tubing
on the tap will minimise the splashing). If the food-vessels are
washed in the room, there should be a draining-board at the
side of the sink.
A small &amp;quot;sanitary dust-bin&amp;quot; is handy. Needless to say,
it should be emptied daily.
There should be a large ventilator just under the ceiling,
of the kind that can be opened and shut at will. Mine opens into
the chimney, and is never shut. If it opened out-of-doors it
might sometimes be necessary to shut it.
For food -vessels I prefer white earthenware, as it is
stronger than glass. Jones&amp;apos;s Fountains are far and away the best
water-vessels, except for Parrots. A satisfactory water-vessel
for Parrots has yet to be invented. Ivories and lyorikeets I
supply with water in soup-plates, for they require a bath at least
once a day, whatever the weather may be.
I have used one of Clark&amp;apos;s S3&amp;apos;phon Gas Stoves in my
^bird-room for five winters. It is safe and very economical. So
far as I can see, it has no injurious effect on the birds. I now
Taave an atmospheric stove (No. 3), and find it gives more heat
than those which give light as well as heat, and there is no
chimney to break ; but the heat cannot be quite so well regu-
lated as it can with the kind more often used (i.e., that with an
argand burner). This winter the temperature in my room has
never fallen below 54*, and generally keeps at from 58* to 60* --
and the gas is never full on. A pan of water should always

Stand on the top of the stove, othen\dse the air becomes un-
healthily dry.
A net for catching birds in the aviary is indispensable. A
common butterfly net does well enough ; but the gauze should
be replaced by light cotton netting.
If the aviaries are built in two tiers, one above the other,
a short step-ladder will be useful for reaching the upper ones.
All seed should be kept in tins, and these should be
arranged in an order which should never be varied -- and you
will then at once be able to find the seed you want, even in the
dark.
CORRESPONDENCE.
CAGES V. AVIARIES.
Sir, -- Mr. Fillmer says, &amp;quot;Will Mr. Button kindly tell us which are
the birds that do better in a cage than in an aviary } &amp;quot;
Mr. Fillmer interprets nie somewhat too positively. I only said,
&amp;quot; Some birds might do better.&amp;quot; In other words, I was merely suggesting
a possibility, My idea is that all small and delicate birds, and birds which
are fastidious about their food, are better in cages. I very much doubt its
being possible to keep a Troupial in an aviary : they want so much
attention about special warmth.* If I were asked to keep a Wren, I think I
should prefer trying to keep it in a cage.t
But readers will kindly bear in mind how very limited my knowledge
and experience is-- almost confined to Parrots, and to man}&amp;apos; fewer of them
than I could wish. All I can do is to throw out suggestions which ma}&amp;apos;-
lead to successful results or may not. F. G. Button.

I had two nests (five and three) of African Silver-bills, and two nests
of Zebra Finches (three in each). The Silver-bills built a lovely solid nest
in a gorse-bush. Chestnut Finches built three large globular nests, but
laid no eggs. Bronze Mannikins built in a small cage, and laid three eggs,
when I was obliged to take them in. St. Helenas, Red Avadavats, and
Cordon Bleus had commenced nests. A hen Saffron Finch lined a cocoa-
nut shell with fine ha}^, and laid three eggs, when the male bird nearly
killed her, having already destroyed a pair of Green Singing Finches ; so I
parted vi&amp;apos;ith them.
Three-coloured Nuns I find very meddlesome : they interfered greatly
with domestic arrangements generally, sleeping in the newly-built nests one
after the other.
The temperature was 42* when I took the birds in, all in perfect
health and plumage.

Sir, -- In my letter which appeared in the last number of our
Magazine, under the above heading, I mentioned Turtiir se?nitorquatus as
being slightly smaller than T. risorius : but in a foot-note Dr. Butler says
that this is incorre6t.
I niiist own to having been decidedly confused over the proper
identification of the species.
A few years ago I had two pairs of African Doves, which, at first
sight, might readily have been taken for Barbary Turtles. They were,
however, slightly smaller, and the collar was somewhat broader than in the
domestic species ; the iris, moreover, which in T. risorius is bright red, was,
in these birds, very dark.
I had not, at the time, the opportunity of examining the collection
of skins in the British Museum ; nor had I access to the Museum Cata-
logue : but when at the Zoological Gardens, I found the species labelled
and figured as 7&amp;apos;. semitorquatus.
On referring to the Museum Catalogue, I find that the birds above
referred to as being less in size than T. risorius correspond with the
description of T. vinaceus ; while T. semitorquatus is, apparently, the larger
species referred to in my last letter as 7\ vinaceus.
Thus the nomenclature of the Doves at the &amp;quot;Zoo.&amp;quot; differs from that
at the British Museum, and the only safe plan is to refer to the Museum
Catalogue for the identification of rare Doves.
The length of T. vinaceus is given by Salvador! as scarcely 10 inches;
that of 7\ senegalensis as about II inches, and that of T. semitorquatus as 12*4
inches.

his last visit. This is a mistake which, if adhered to, would lead to endless
confusion.
It is well known that birds associated together in a cage or aviary
will sometimes agree perfectly for weeks or years, and then, either because
the breeding-season is at hand or because old age has made a bird dis-
agreeable, it will attack every one of its associates (I have had an instance
in one of my aviaries this year).
Supposing this happens at the Zoo, and an under-keeper is passing
at the time, he will quickly remove the offender to a cage containing
perhaps one bird, substituting the latter for the offender. For the time
then, the labels on the cages are transposed, and a Green Bulbul becomes
a Paradise Whydah or something equally absurd.
My pair of Ilalf-collared Turtle Doves were seledled from a series
brought home by our member, Mr. Frank Finn, and deposited at the
Zoological Society&amp;apos;s Gardens ; at his request the Society sent the birds to
me.
Knowing what confusion had existed respecting the true Turtur
semitorquatus, I spoke to Count Salvadori (who was then engaged upon the
British Museum Catalogue of ColumbcB) and he showed me our fine series of
skins of T. Senegalensis and of T. semitorquatus, as well as T. vinaceus.
T. semitorquatus is b}&amp;apos; far the larger bii&amp;apos;d ; then comes T. senegalensis, about
II inches ; whilst T. vinaceus is barely lo inches in total length.

Sir, -- The article by Mr. C. L,. Hett in the last issue was of great
interest in revealing some of the habits of a most shy and interesting bird ;
they are still more interesting since they agree in one or two minute details
with my observations on the breeding of the Corncrake, last year (1896). I
have not at hand the number of the Avicultural Magazine in which my
remarks appeared, but I remember distinctly passing over several of my
notes, as I considered the habits to which they referred probably due to a
life in confinement. Mr. Hett refers to the fact that the male bird kept
away from the brood and took no notice of them during the first three days
of their life ; also that the male tended some of the chicks in one nest
while the hen looked after the rest in another. The following are my notes
on the subjecfl.
i6th July, 1896 -- &amp;quot; The Corncrake began to sit on July 6th. . . The
male bird goes on as soon as she comes off.&amp;quot;
22nd July -- &amp;quot;The Corncrake has to-day hatched off all her young (8),
after seventeen days incubation. She -will not allow the cock to interfere with
them or come near her.&amp;quot;
26th July--&amp;quot; A marked change has come over the hen, who, instead
of driving the cock away, now allows him to brood the young They
have not been seen going about together, but each has a few young.&amp;quot;
A glance at these notes will shew that in these particulars, and during
a time of greatest importance to the welfare of the species, the habits of
these two species are practically the same. And although it may be
argued that they belong to the same family, yet their modes of life, which

are always supposed to have the greatest influence in determining habits,
are as divergent as can be : the one spending most of its time on water, the
other inhabiting dry fields. It also tends to show that habits are b}&amp;apos; no
means so transient and easil}&amp;apos; influenced b}&amp;apos; external circumstances as many
suppose ; but, at any rate, in this case they have been able to withstand the
agents that have caused so great a divergence from the common ancestor
of the two species.
Another point which has often puzzled me with regard to the Moor-
hen is the abundance of unused nests that are always found ; undoubtedly
some of them are built as landing-stages for the young, but Mr. Hett
evidently believes that some are built by earlier broods, and it would be
extremely interesting if he could another year ascertain the fact.
As regards bread as food for the young, I was much entertained one
day this year in St. James&amp;apos;s Park, by watching a Moorhen taking bread as
it was thrown down, and coveying it to her young, who remained partially
concealed in the rushes close by.

Sir, -- In the last issue, you invite correspondence on this most
interesting subjecl, and this is my only excuse for burdening your space.
A few years ago I tried to keep many of our Warblers, and afterwards
gave it up, as I came to the conclusion that not having means or suitable
accommodation to keep them properlj^ it was better not to do so at all.
For three or four years I always had a few by me, as I was determined, if
possible, to find out the secret of success, and I only gave it up when I had
satisfied myself that I had found out the secret, and that owing to practical
conditions, it was impossible for me to carry it out. &amp;quot; First catch your
hare and then cook it,&amp;quot; is a golden rule for most people, but the exception
to it is found in aviculture, where it is all-important to learn the rudiments
of how to keep a bird before catching it. I will, therefore, pass over the
great question of &amp;quot; meatiug oflf&amp;quot; a fresh -caught bird,* or the other
alternative of hand-rearing -- to which practice I am, personally, strongly
opposed.
The first point to consider is that of cage verstis aviary. During our
winter, the Warblers do much better in a large and roomy box-cage, with
not less than two or more than four in a cage. The reason is, not because
the birds keep in better health, but that they can be under closer observa-
tion, and the delicacies more evenly divided. Besides which, a bird may be to
all appearances well in the morning and dead in the afternoon ; in an aviary
it would not be noticed, or if noticed, the excitement of catching it would
probably place it beyond hope of recovery. The next point is, where should
the cage or cages be kept 1 An ordinary living-room is too hot by day and
too cold in the early morning, and, to make a long story short, the only place
is a room devoted solely to birds, with good ventilation and a fairly con-
stant temperature.
In writing these notes, I would impress on my readers that individual
birds have thriven under very different circumstances, but these notes are

intended to apply where a number of birds are kept, and to all individuals
\0x25A0of our British summer Sylviuice, weakly or robust.
As regards food.-- The only satisfactory staple food that T have been
able to discover is hard boiled egg and ants&amp;apos; eggs, in equal parts, served
fresh twice a day. The egg should be run through a wire sieve and then
mixed, with the ants&amp;apos; eggs. About twice a week, scraped raw beef should
be given, and. on those days, instead of the egg and ants&amp;apos; eggs, give bread
soaked in milk, with the milk well .squeezed out, and mixed with about a
third of its bulk of hempseed well crushed and pounded. Each bird
should have at least five mealworms a day, or other live food. Green meat
and fruit should also be given, and will be relished b3^some but not by all.
The only drawl)ack to this food is that it is liable to become too fattening.
The first symptom of this is, probably, that the bird has a slight fit ;
when this is the case, stop the egg, give him ants&amp;apos; eggs damped in milk,
and a little scraped beef and plenty of green food, but do not feed too well.
During the winter, if a light be not left in the room, they should have
a last feed at night. Drop some mealworms into the food-dish and they
will soon feed. A bath, twice a week at least, is essential.
If this method should be followed, I am sure there are few or no birds
that will not keep in the pink of health and condition, but it may well be
questioned whether birds that need such care are worth the trouble of
keeping. I can only say that, if one&amp;apos;s purse is long enough and one has
sufficient spare time, few birds would better repay the care, both in
their song, tame dispositions, and enticing ways ; but there can be no half-
measures, and a couple of days&amp;apos; neglect is sufficient to induce many to
\0x25A0start on their last journey.
_ J. I,EWIS BoNHOTE.
Sir, -- The Gefiederte W^^//f mentions that Dr. Russ kept a Tui for over
two years on the following food : Ants&amp;apos; cocoons and grated carrot, mixed :
l)esides dailj&amp;apos; a little piece of biscuit soaked in milk, now and then a little
:sweet fruit or a teaspoonful of honey, also a little scraped raw meat.
In the Zoological Garden of Berlin the Tui is fed upon Tanager-food ;
this bird has lived there four years.
I feed my Tuis in the same way as Tanagers, Spectacle-birds,
Warblers and similar birds, and, I make bold to say, with the greatest
success : fresh sweet cheese or curdle, a little preserved yolk of &amp;gg, ants&amp;apos;
\0x25A0cocoons, grated stale bread or biscuit, grated raw carrot or carrot-meal,
mixed ; now and then banana or other sweet fruit.
The fresh cheese is much easier digested by all these birds than boiled
\0x25A0egg and meat ; it is made by mixing fresh milk, one quart, with rennet,
three teaspoonsful, keeping it for a little while in a temperature of So to 90
*degrees and boiling it afterwards. Mixed with some good dried ants&amp;apos;
\0x25A0cocoons, I consider it to be a good substitute for fresh ants&amp;apos; cocoons.
The great success which places the Austrians in front of all other
nations in keeping soft-billed birds is due, I believe, in a great extent, to
the free use of fresh sweet cheese.
Through my persuasion, the late Mr. Erskine Allon tried feeding his
\0x25A0Shamas on fresh cheese-food, and he assured me many times that these
birds were thriving splendidly upon it.

I cannot believe that Tuis or any other birds could be kept a long
time on mashed potatoes and sugar without becoming ansemic, as potatoes
contain so little nitrogen, but plenty of carbon ; even biscuit or bread
soaked on milk as the staple food would not give them sufficient nitrogen ;
therefore I prefer to use the above-mentioned cheese-food, which contains
plenty of nitrogen, is very easily digested, and will not produce too much.
fat.
R. Maschke.
Sir, -- Some time since I had a little talk with Mr. Abrahams on this
subject, and he told me that his experience of the Tui-ljird and other
honey-eaters was that they could not be kept for any length of time either
on honey or condensed milk.
At the same time it was a great mistake to suddenly remove the food
upon which any bird had been imported and give it that which was suitable
as a permanency: this change must be effected gradually: thus, if Tui-
birds reached him which had been fed on condensed milk, he gradually
added his insectivorous food and potatoes or breadcrumbs until he had
accustomed them to the drier food, when he gave no more of the sweet
laxative mess, and got the birds into a healthy condition.
In the case of Tanagers, of which I have two species, -- the vSuperb
and the Scarlet, -- oranges are the favourite food in a wild state ; yet during
the winter, when oranges are visually more or less acid, I find that my
Scarlet Tanagers will not touch them, but eat my soft food mixture greedily,
and make up with banana ; the vSuperb Tanager eats a little soft food,
always beginning upon the yolk of egg, a little orange and a good deal of
banana. As regards condition, I think all who have seen my birds will
admit that they are fit to compete at any show -- a trial to which I shall not
subject them.
My Zoslemps, which I have had for some years, prefers grapes or apple
to orange during the winter-time, but feeds chiefly upon soft food at this
season and is in the pink of condition. My mixture consists of stale bread,
potato, egg, ants&amp;apos; cocoons and Abrahams&amp;apos; food.
I find that Tanagers prefer cockroaches to mealworms, but they
sometimes accept the latter.
A. G. BuTi,ER.
Sir, -- In response to your request for information as to &amp;quot; Food for
soft-billed birds &amp;quot; I am glad to give you the following particulars of the
manner in which my own birds are fed.
For the staple food which is supplied to the aviaries, and the less
delicate of the British and foreign &amp;quot;soft-bills,&amp;quot; I take equal parts, in bulk,
of the finest ants&amp;apos; cocoons procurable, &amp;apos;* dried flies,&amp;quot; Osborne biscuits ground
to powder, and Spratts&amp;apos; fine-ground crissel : this mixture keeps indefinitely.
Each morning a portion of this is taken, and made up to double its bulk by
the addition of breadcrumbs, hard-boiled e^g, and boiled potatoes ; or bread-
crumbs, egg, and grated raw carrot. The coarser birds, such as Thrushes,
Blackbirds, Shamas, and the like, would thrive perfectly upon a larger
proportion of bread and potato, while the more delicate ones are better
with less bread. I may anticipate enquiries by stating that I get the &amp;quot; drie
flies&amp;quot; from Maggs Bros., of Swansea, at i/- per lb. The ants&amp;apos; cocoons ar

imported directly for nie from Austria at 30/- the five kilo bag (about ten
pounds). Until I discovered these latter I was vising Roman&amp;apos;s ants&amp;apos; cocoons,
but as this firm would not sell them in bulk, only supplying them in shilling
tins, which makes them come out, even at wholesale price, at 6/- per lb., I
was ver)^ glad to find a sample nearly or quite as good at half the price. I
believe the one secret in feeding insectivorous birds is to give as many ants&amp;apos;
cocoons as one can afford, and only of the best quality; cheap ants&amp;apos; cocoons
are about as valuable for food as chopped straw. The ideal food of all is
fresh ants&amp;apos; cocoons, but these are of course only obtainable by those, or from
those, who know how to take them, and then only through the summer.
On the Continent they are sold during the season by all bird dealers, and I
should think they would prove a most remunerative &amp;quot;line &amp;quot;in England.
The process of taking these cocoons is a most interesting one, and one day
I will write an article explaining it.
The food as above will be found to suit all but the most delicate of
the insectivorous birds, for there still remain some which would not eat, or
could not digest, the biscuit and breadcrumbs. Among the latter may be
classed the Nightingale, the various Warblers, and the Long-tailed Tit. As
I have a Long-tailed Tit which I have twice cage-moulted, and as I believe
it to be the only specimen of its kind which has ever been kept in a cage
for more than a few daj&amp;apos;s, perhaps a short account of my experience with
this individual bii&amp;apos;d may be of interest, as being indicative of the troubles
incidental to the keeping in captivit}&amp;apos; of the more delicate kinds of insecti-
vorous birds. I bought him at the &amp;quot; first feather &amp;quot; show of the L- &amp; P. O. S.
in 1S96, and had no particular trouble with him until his fii&amp;quot;st moult. His
food was scalded ants&amp;apos; cocoons andj-olk of freshly-boiled ^&amp;apos;g&amp;apos;g, supplemented
by mealworms, flies, and such small insects as we could capture for him --
house-flies were a particular dainty which he would always take from one&amp;apos;s
finger. When he was deep in his first moult I was daily expecting to lose
him, but he pulled through with a plentiful supply of live insects, and
everything went well until the past ai:tumn, when he went into his second
moult. Then we had a very serious time with him, and even now he has
not quite recovered &amp;quot; show condition.&amp;quot; When at his worst he would not
touch even scalded ants&amp;apos; cocoons, and was kept alive by feeding from th
fingei-s with live flies, spiders and other small insects. At one time he was
so weak that as a desperate resource we poured small doses of strong beef-
tea down his throat, and I really think the bird&amp;apos;s preservation is due to the
&amp;quot;exhibition &amp;quot; of this &amp;quot;unnatural food.&amp;quot; At the time of writing he is in
perfect health, and I confidently hope to show him at the forthcoming
Palace Show.
My Nightingales, Warblers and Swallows have only scalded ants&amp;apos;
cocoons, 3&amp;apos;olk of egg and live insects.
Such birds as Tanagers, Zosterops, Sugar-birds and Lories do perfectly
well with me upon sponge cake soaked in boiled milk and sweetened with
sugar or hone}&amp;apos;, together with a daily supply of fresh fruit : the favourite
fruits being bananas and oranges. Some of these birds will eat mealworms
and scalded ants&amp;apos; cocoons; others refuse them.
I have not mentioned birds which feed on raw meat. I have in my
collection three species of birds, the Greater Grey-backed Shrike, the

vSiR, -- I feed my soft-bills chiefly on Gaspariii&amp;apos;s Food. My Whindiat;
now nearly three 3&amp;apos;ears old, has always been fed entirely on it, and she has
taken numerons prizes at Shows. Besides the Whinchat, I have iised it for
feeding Blackcaps, White-throats, Robins, Redstarts, Wheatears, and Pekin
Robins, but I find that Nightingales, ChifFchafFs, and Wagtails do not care
for it.
I take a shilling packet of Gasparin&amp;apos;s, add to it one third its bulk of
dry ants&amp;apos; eggs, and, having mixed it well, take as mvich as will last for one
day and make it quite moist with boiling water. On three days in the week
I add to it, when cold, either watercress, lettuce, or the leaves of gi&amp;apos;oundsell
chopped very fine, -- as I find that the soft-billed birds do not otherwise eat
green food, which I consider good for them.
When I first began to keep soft-bills I tried dried flies, yolk of egg,
and more than one advertised mixture ; but I found that the birds did not
look so healthy upon any of them as they do upon what I now give them,
and I consider it more economical.
As a rule, I give six to eight mealworms a day to each bird, but some
birds take more. My Robin, which I have had for three years, has only
three a day, as, if he gets more, he has fits. As I consider the mealworms
heating, I generally give them the first thing in the morning, about nine,
and feed with Gasparin&amp;apos;s about ten and again about five.
On their return from Shows, and about once a month, when at home,
I give my birds six to ten drops of extract of Cascara Sagrada in their
drinking-water, as I find they will drink that -- and it is so difficult to give
castor oil. As a rule, I keep them separately in box-cages, 20 inches by 12
inches, not being able to have aviaries, except for Wagtails. I find the
Blackcaps and Whinchats are very fond of a little piece of cooked fish.
E. Iv. HOPWOOD.
Gasparin&amp;apos;s food I consider to be an excellent preparation, and I am
now giving my foreign soft-bills a mixture of it with Abrahams&amp;apos; Preserved
~B,^^, and soaked ants&amp;apos; eggs, in about equal proportions. This seems to
form a nourishing and wholesome food which they all eat readily, and with
bananas and apples, and biscuit or sponge cake made into a crumbl}&amp;apos; paste
with boiled milk, constitutes their regular diet. I am not at all sure whether
the preserved ^%^ might not with advantage be omitted.
My Ceram Lory lives on biscuit soaked in boiled milk (made rather
sloppy) and stewed apple. The Ivorikeets have their biscuit much more
solid, and usually have bananas and raw apple instead of stewed apple.
Horatio R. Fii,i,mbr.
[We should be glad of many more letters upon this subject, as we
should like to have the benefit of the experience of ever}&amp;apos; member who has
successfully kept soft-bills for years. The treatment adopted by many will
doubtless be much the same as that described in some of the letters we have
already published, but the evidence will not be the less valuable on that
account.]

Sir, -- I am this year testing the hardiness of several species that I
have not previously tried in an open air aviary during the winter. Of these
I have, perhaps, been most interested in the Green Avadavat, in view of the
very different opinions held on the point by high authorities. As far as the
experiment has yet gone, the opinion expressed by Dr. Butler, in his
&amp;quot;Foreign Finches in Captivity,&amp;quot; is fully confirmed. We have already had
a good deal of cold weather here, and several nights of sharp frost ; not
only have these birds not suffered, but one morning with the thermometer
showing ten degrees of frost, I noticed them in the open flight of their
aviarj^ flying briskly about and evidently rather enjoying the bitter air
than otherwise. Of course this, like nay other aviaries, has a house for the
birds to retire to at night or when they desire shelter. A hen Blue Gros-
beak, in an adjoining aviary, seems also quite indifferent to frost. I fancy
that farther experiment will prove many birds, usually considered delicate,
ablp to withstand as much frost as we usually experience in this country ;
but, of course, the aviary should be iu a position as far as possible sheltered
from cold winds, and communicate with a house or shed to give shelter
from wet. The principle danger is, probably, the liability of hens to
become egg-bound during the cold months. It would certainly be ad-
visable to separate the sexes during the winter.

BREEDING RESULTS FOR 1897.
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.997210185185185" page_id="32635490"  page_num="57" year="" vol="">
Sir, -- I have been looking forward to seeing reports of the breedino-
results of members of the Society for 1S97. My own aviaries are rather too
crowded to admit of great results in this branch of aviculture. I have,
however, not been altogether unsuccessful.
Zebra Finches. -- Fourteen reared, and as many or more not reared. I
cannot fathom the reason why so many are thrown out of the nest by the
parents before they are fledged, unless it is that in a confined space the
different pairs interfere too much with each other&amp;apos;s proceedings. I give
hardly any mealworms in the summer, but a fair supply of egg-food and
ants&amp;apos; eggs, and plenty of green food and flowering grass. I am also ex-
tremely careful never to approach the neighbourhood of the nests. The
first brood was hatched during the&amp;apos; sharp spell of frost in January, when
the thermometer fell on one night to 17* F. The nest was built in thick
ivy in the open flight of the aviary ; two birds were hatched, but only one
was reared.
Ribbon Finches. -- Five reared, and in this case also several not reared.
It is curious that I have only bred one hen in the last three years. These
birds I also keep in an outdoor aviary.
Bengalese. -- One reared and one not reared. Whatever they may do
if kept in separate pairs in cages, these birds will certainly not breed freely
in an aviary. Their habit of packing together in the same nest is not con-
ducive to the rearing of young.
Long-tailed Finches. -- Three reared. The young birds, nearly four
months old, are now hardly distinguishable from their parents.
Hybrid between Bronze Mannikin and Rufous-backed Mannikin. --
Five reared. These are very similar to the latter (the male parent), but are
generally duller in colour, with the white and black marking on the wings

less distinct. A pair of these have now mated, and are building a nest, but
according to all rules the eggs should not be fertile.
Parson Finches. -- As usual, my pair has nested repeatedly all through
the season, but never hatched out. I have had this pair for three years,
and they have never got beyond eggs, though an undoubted pair.
Cherry Finches.-- Nested twice with no result.
Red-crested Cardinal. -- Two nests and three j&amp;apos;oung in each, wliicli
were thrown out and killed before they were a fortnight old. The old birds
have a constant supply of cockroaches and a good many caterpillars, but
very few mealworms,

Magpie Mannikiu. -- Their first nest was filled with eggs which were
constantly incubated, either the cock or the hen being alwaj&amp;apos;s on the nest,
but never hatched. Several nests have been built since, and immediately
pulled to pieces again, and no eggs laid.
I have noticed an egg dropped occasionally in my Weaver aviary, but
none of the occupants have ever made any serious attempt to nest.

TANAGERS, RUFOUS-TAIIvED GRASSFINCHES, AND
DUFRESNE&amp;apos;S WAXBILLS.

Sir, -- As Tanagers are usually considered rather difficult birds to
keep, perhaps my experience ma\^ be of some interest. Even Dr. Russ, in
Vols. I. and II. of his great work, &amp;quot; Die Fremdlandischen Stubenvogel,&amp;quot;
does not speak favourably of these birds in an}&amp;apos; i-espedt, except their beauty.
I had, therefore, never contemplated the possibilit}&amp;apos; of keeping a Tanager,
though I had often admired their brilliant appearance in Dr. Russ&amp;apos; books.
However, on seeing several species mentioned in Mr. Abrahams&amp;apos; list last
October, I wrote to enquire about them, and bv his advice I selected a
Superb Tanager {CalListe fastuosa). I received a beautiful specimen in
perfect plumage, and put him at once in my aviary-cage with about thirty-
six small Waxbills, Finches, Weavers, Mannikins and a pair of Gre3&amp;apos;-backed
Australian Spectacle Birds (Zosterops lateralis). Mr. Abrahams told me the
Tanager would eat the same food as the Spectacle Birds, i.e., preserved 3&amp;apos;olk
of egg mixed with potato finely grated, Mr. Abrahams&amp;apos; Insectivorous Food,
and ripe fruit. I give the Tanager three or four mealworms daily, which I
drop into his food-tin to ensure his securing them, as he does not appear
to like the floor of the cage. He was rather shy at first, but now watches me
so closely during the process that I think he will soon take them from my
hand.
Dr. Russ describes this bird as being dull and voracious. The speci-
men in ni}&amp;apos; possession is always lively, and certainly does not eat more than
his companions. My cage is cleaned daily, but I do not find that the
Tanager necessitates any extra trouble in that line, and he is quite peace-
able with the other birds, suffering a tiny Orange-cheek Waxbill to snatch
away a mealworm before his ej&amp;apos;es. On the whole, he prefers the egg and
potato to the insectivorous food : tinlike my Shama, who refuses to touch
anything else (except mealworms) ; and, during the three years I have had
him, he has thriven and sung splendidly on that food alone.
I quite agree with Mr. Todd about the peaceable disposition of the
Rufous-tailed Grassfinch {Bathilda riificaiuia). I bought a pair nearly two

years ago, wliicli I was told had just gained ist prize at the Crystal Palace,
and they have never attempted to molest any other birds. Last year they
showed an inclination to nest, so I put them in a separate cage, but they
devoured their eggs as soon as they were laid.
I have had a cock Dufresne&amp;apos;s Waxbill, who came from Mr. Abrahams
just a year ago^i and he has alvva\-s been verv healthy. His only drawback
is his love of having his neck plucked b}&amp;apos; the other birds, and he is always
trjdng to obtain that pleasure. I got another cock this spring, from Mr.
Allou&amp;apos;s collection, but unfortunately he slipped out of the aviary-cage the
day of his arrival, without my perceiving his escape, and next morning he
was found dead in the drawing-room underneath the window, havino-
probabl}^ flown against the plate-glass.

Sir, -- I well remember with what pleasure I received m\&amp;apos; first cage of
foreign birds (Java Sparrows), brought home by a coloured sailor on one of
the tea ships. About the same time, I had sent me a book on foreign birds
and with it a list from a foreign-bird dealer. Perhaps it might be interest-
ing to the readers of the Avicidtural Magazine to compare some of the
prices of thirty years ago (1867) and the prices of to-daj&amp;apos;. The following
are some of the prices in this list : -- ^Java Sparrows, Cutthroat or
Coral-necked Sparrows, vSilverbeaks, 10/- pair ; Amandava or Avadavat.
African Waxbills, Black- and White-headed Mannikins, Combassou Birds,

Australian King Parrots, ^^^5 each.
Since then, some of the birds I have kept have come to me in rather
strange wa3&amp;apos;s. Some ten years ago, a very fine Blue-fronted Amazon Parrot
flew into one of the windows of a Girls&amp;apos; Orphanage in South London.
Some of the girls, with sticks and brooms, tried to drive it away ; when
they drove it from one window it flew to another. Pollie would not be
driven away -- it being an Orphan Home, she had come to stay. When I went
to see her, poor Pollie was tied to the leg of a table in one corner of the
room. We made ever}&amp;apos; enquiry, but could not find the owner. I had
the pleasure of taking it home as a present for ni}&amp;apos; wife. It took several
prizes, was a very fair talker, and one of the tamest Parrots I ever kept.
At another time, a driver of one of Carter Paterson&amp;apos;s vans called and
enquired if I had lost what he thought was a large Black Crow which talked :
he had caught it in the neighbourhood. It proved to be a large Vasa Parrot,
a very tame bird. He offered it to me at a very low price ; I promised, pro-
viding he could not find the owner, to purchase it, which eventually I did.
Walking down the East Eud one day, I was looking at the cages of
birds piled up outside one of the bird-shops; amongst them, in a small
cage, were two birds which, at first, I took to be a pair of Great Tits. I

asked the man outside what birds they were, and the price. (I had recognised
them as being a pair of White-eared Bulbiils). He said they were Prussian
Bullfinches, good singers, and he thought they were worth &amp;quot; &amp;apos;arf-a-crown
each.&amp;quot; I purchased them at that price; they soon improved in plumage,
and, before long, were quite in show condition.
One cage of birds came to me from North Queensland, in rather a
strange wa}&amp;apos;. Some twelve years ago, two brothers were in my employ; they
emigrated to Australia. The elder one is quite a naturalist in every sense.
Perhaps I might quote one or two extracts from his letters ; he writes: --
&amp;quot;This part (North Central Queensland), with its iron-bark forests and
rolling plains, is quite a paradise for a naturalist. We have an abundance
of Kangaroos and Wallabies, also Emus, Cassowaries, Scrub and Plain
Turkeys, Wood and Whistling Ducks, Swamp Pheasants, Cockatoos, Black
and White Magpies, Leather-heads, Blue Mountain Lories and other kinds
of Parrots, Fan-tail Flj^catchers, a strange bird called by the settlers More-
pork, something like an Owl, (at night when out hunting it says distinctly
&amp;apos;more pork,&amp;apos; whence comes its name), all kinds of Pigeons and pretty
Doves, plenty of Laughing Jackasses which make a great deal of noise when
attacking the carpet Snake (I saw five of them a few daj&amp;apos;s since attacking a
laro-e Iguana, three feet long : they flew in rapid succession one after the
other past the Lizard, each and every one giving a tremendous blov/ with
the beak on the head, until the Iguana was killed). . . . The trappers
have caught a large flight of eight hundred Blue Mountain Lories; they
migrate West from here at this time of the year (April, 1896). I have picked
out thirty to send to you for your Blue Mountain aviary at Sydenham, all
the rest will be sent down to Brisbane and shipped on a China boat for
Hong Kong ; when just caught they are fed chiefly on canary seed ; they
are a lovel}&amp;apos; sight.&amp;quot; (I am sure they must have been, for the twenty-one that
reached me, in splendid plumage, were quite a living picture ; they became
so tame that they would come down on my arms and shoulders like a flock
of tame Pigeons). &amp;quot;Also seven Pink-cheeks, which were caught in the nets,
I am sending.&amp;quot; (Five reached me; these were Musky Lorikeets; a pair of
them took honours at the Brighton and Aquarium Shows when exhibited
by Mr. Maxwell ; they were the finest pair I ever saw.
Another letter says, &amp;quot; I want to send you some rare Finches, some are
very pretty. Farther North I am told there are some as yet unnamed ; these
are found in a locality where the Blacks are, who have a very bad name. I
hope to send you some *Painted, Blood (Crimson), Double-bars (Bichenos),
Star (Rufous-tailed Grass), Black-throats (Parson), and Gouldian Finches,&amp;quot;
and a name I could not quite make out. I wrote saying I should like to
have the birds he had mentioned. In due time a letter came saying he had
sent me a number of birds, including thirteen of the strange-named Finch,
as I thought. When the boat arrived I was very anxious to see the new
birds ; I made enquiries of the man who brought them home; he said he
hadl&amp;gt;!)st only one on the voyage, the others were all right. To my surprise,
the cage contained twelve Pectoral Rails {Rallies pectoralis) in finest con-
dition. I was somewhat disappointed at not receiving Finches, although
pleased with the Rails, as they were new birds to me, most beautifully
marked, and a good addition to my aviaries.

A BIRD&amp;apos;S WING.
B}^ Arthur G. Butler, Ph.D.
Some of the members of our Society have expressed a
wish for a drawing of the wing of a bird with an explanation of
its parts, to enable them to follow intelligently the descriptions
of species which appear from time to time in our pages. Our
Secretary asked me if I would undertake the work, which of
course I willingly agreed to, being only too happ}^ to be
permitted to do what little I can towards the advancement of
knowledge in this branch of our hobby.
The simplest plan would have been to prepare a mere
outline map of some full-feathered species ; but it occurred to
me that it is not always easy for anyone with a map before him
to recognize the corresponding feathers in an adlual specimen,
owing to their frequent displacement in sickly or dead birds, and
to the absence of sharply-defined lines, due to their fringed ends
and compact arrangement : I therefore determined to make a
detailed drawing of an actual wing, and I consulted with Mr.
Gronvold (a very talented taxidermist and draughtsman) as to
the most suitable subject for ni}^ illustration. This gentleman
kindly selected and lent me the wing of an Australian Bower-
bird, yEhirocdtis crassirostris, in which the ends of the chief
feathers are rendered prominent by white terminal spots, and
which will serve as a good typical model.
The quill-feathers of the wing separate into two well-
defined series -- primaries and secondaries, and serve much the
same purpose as the front and &amp;apos;hind wings of a butterfly (whicli
have consequently received the same names, the front-wings
being called primaries and the hind-wings secondaries). The
first primary (fig. i) is often veiy short and may be easily over-
looked in some families by superficial observers. It has been
called &amp;apos; bastard primary &amp;apos; by Seebohni and many other writers ;
</bodyText>
<page confidence="0.998825" page_id="32635497"  page_num="62" year="" vol="">

</page>
<bodyText confidence="0.993578785714286" page_id="32635497"  page_num="62" year="" vol="">
but this is a most misleading term, inasmuch as it implies that
the feather does not originate from the same part of the
wing-framework as the remainder of the primaries, whereas
it certainly does.
If the cov^erts are carefully removed from the under surface
of a Sk^dark&amp;apos;s wing, the tiny first primary will be seen projecting
from the tip of the index finger of the hand (^majius), and in
exactly the same plane as the nine large primaries which follow
it ; all the primaries in fact originate from the inner border of
the hand, the thumb {pollex) alone being reserved to support the
bastard-wing, -- a group of stiff feathers which strengthen the
front of the wing from the bend forwards.
As in the wing selected for illustration, ten is a frequent
number for the primary quills ; but, when great sweep of wing is
required, an extra primary and several additional secondaries
are often found ; and, in not a few families, only nine primaries
are said to exist. -^
In the wdng before us the secondaries (11-21) are eleven in
number. These quills are attached to the front of the fore-arm
(tihia) ; the inner ones, which are graded and therefore readily
recognizable in my illustration, are in some groups elongated ;
so that, by careless observers, they are apt to be confused with
the outer scapularies. The latter represent a mass of soft feathers
(analogous to the wing-lappets (pierygodes) of butterflies) which
proceed from the hinder division of the arm {humerus), and
strengthen the base of the wing.
In the closed wing the innermost secondary is on the
surface, and thence to the first primar}^ each overlaps the feather
in front of it ; this is also the case with the greater coverts, the
innermost secondary covert (s. c.) being on the surface, though
parti}&amp;apos; overlapped by the outermost scapularies : the innermost
primary covert (p. c.) is necessarily overlapped by the outermost
secondary and its covert, otherwise the free movement of the
wing would be obstructed.
Situated between the two groups of greater coverts, but
terminating half-way between the tips of the median and greater
coverts, a white-tipped feather will be noticed (in many birds
there are two of these feathers varying somewhat in the method
of their emission) ; this is probabl}&amp;apos; emitted from the skin which
covers the ulnar carpal bone of the hand, and is known as a
carpal covert. These feathers are rarely mentioned in descrip-
* The fifth piimaiy starts from tlie plialanx of the third and last digit.

lions, and are very likely to be mistaken for a portion of the
ba.stard wing, or even for primary coverts.
If the median and lesser coverts are removed from the
front of a Skylark&amp;apos;s wing, it will be seen that all the greater
secondar}^ coverts originate inside and at the base of the quills
which the}^ overlap ; the primary coverts seem to me (though I
may be in error) to originate between the quills and to be directed
obliquely to the front of them.
The median coverts (m. c), represented in our illustration
by the inner series of white-tipped smaller feathers, and the
lesser coverts (1. c), which clothe the basal portion of the wing,
are arranged in a reverse direction to the greater coverts (s.c. and
p. c), the outermost feathers being on the surface, so that the
order of overlapping is in the opposite direction ; but, it must be
remembered, when examining skins and even living birds, that
the lesser coverts, being small and soft, get easily disarranged ;
moreover, I have often seen a bird, when preening its feathers,
pluck out and fling away a refractory covert which would not
take its proper place ; it is therefore not unusual to find more or
less confusion as regards the relative position of these tiny
details of plumage. The number of rows of lesser coverts
varies not a little, the Doves being most liberally supplied in
this respec5l.
The terminology of the feathered areas on the bodj^ is, for
the most part, readily comprehended, but there are one or two
terms which may prove puzzling, such as the &amp;apos; lores &amp;apos; or feathers
&amp;quot;between the upper mandible and the e3&amp;apos;e, the &amp;apos; ear-coverts &amp;apos; -- a
patch of feathers covering the ear and often well-defined in
colour (as in the Song - Thrush), the &amp;apos; axillaries &amp;apos; -- feathers
*covering the arm-pit and placed below and at the base of the
wing ; when the latter is extended they stand slightly away from
the surface of the bodj&amp;apos;, and look like a continuation of the
scapularies carried under the wing.

at a time. We have not finished the Macaws. Someone must be

Military Macaws. However, while waiting for those, we might
take the smaller race of Macaws. I hardly expect any one will
tell us anything about Spix&amp;apos;s, but there remain the Severe
Macaw, the Noble Macaw, and Illiger&amp;apos;s.
I do not know that I could distinguish the Severe and
Noble Macaws without a book to help me, but Illiger&amp;apos;s is much
smaller : it is, I suppose, the smallest Macaw. About this I can
say one or two words, and Mr. Cresswell will, I hope, supplement
what I have to say with a few notes on one now in his posses-
sion. And, as he has the living bird before him, I will leave to
him the description of the plumage.
I digress here to say that, talking of the description of
Parrots, an3rone who devotes himself to Parrots should not fail
to have the British Museum Catalogue of Parrots. It is simply
invaluable for identifying them.
The first time I saw an Illiger&amp;apos;s Macaw was somewhere
about i860, in the Pantheon. I suppose there are few who
recollect the old Pantheon. It was like the Solio Bazaar, but to
my mind far more attractive. And then one entrance (the
entrance from Great Marlborough Street, I think,) was a long
glass-roofed vestibule, rising by steps to a circular space with a
fountain in the middle, round which were the Parrots. The
Pantheon proper was entered by a door to the right of the
fountain. The whole vestibule was given up to plants and birds.
Chained to a perch, close to the fountain, was a delightfully tame
little Macaw. I longed to buy him, but I suppose I had not room
for him, or that Mr. Isaacs and myself could not come to terms,,
for he did not become mine.
Well, that lUiger didn&amp;apos;t come off. But I had a friend
whose brother had a West Indian Kstate, and who sent him lots
of Parrots, and those rare ones-- alas ! thirtj^-eight were once
lost in one wreck ! Amongst others, my friend had an lUiger
sent him, and I took care of it for him. But I cannot say that it
was tame, nor did it talk ; it left me with the idea that I might
very well leave Illiger&amp;apos;s Macaw alone for the future, as not being
likely to realise my ideal. It is only since my experience of
other Macaws has shown me how great the Macaws&amp;apos; powers of
talking are, and how affectionate they may be, that I have
reconsidered the question. And now, were I to have an empty
cage, and I saw a very tame lUiger, and particularly if that
lUiger were to say a word or two, I might buy it. I saj^ &amp;quot;if it
said a word or two,&amp;quot; for in Illiger&amp;apos;s Macaw I am sure sex would
be all important. I very much doubt the hens talking at all.

At any rate, Mr. Cresswell has an Illiger which does talk,
and, if he will be kind enough to tell our Society about it, I
think we shall have some idea of the merits of the species as a
cage-bird.

ILLIGER&amp;apos;S MACAW.

By O. E. CresswelIv.
I formerly had a prejudice against all Macaws ; I can&amp;apos;t tell
-why, probably because they screamed and sometimes prevented
me from enjoying the sight of other Parrots. I thought I never
would have a Macaw, but fate decreed otherwise.
In 1893 I was at Antwerp ; there, in the Zoo, where most
of the birds are on sale, were several Illiger&amp;apos;s Macaws, each in a
rather dreary pen-like cage. The servant, who at home has
chief care of my foreign birds, was with me, and reported that
amongst these Illigers w^as a very interesting bird which he
hoped I would buy. Certainly the bird had taken a great fancy
to him, and seemed to extend this affection to myself ; but I
regretfully refused to buy any more birds -- I had already with
me Doves from Voss&amp;apos;s establishment at Cologne, and had just
bought a Redrump, which, I am glad to say, is still close by me
as I write. I could hardly descend at hotels with more boxes of
birds ! The poor Illiger seemed to implore us to take him, and
despairingly called &amp;quot;cockie&amp;quot; as I left the house. I had learnt
that there evidently might be character in an Illiger ; it is, too,
I believe, quite the smallest of about thirty known varieties of
Macaws, and this is an advantage. For those who have never
seen one, I may say that in body the Illiger is about the size of
a Grey Parrot, though, from its long tail, it looks larger. The
face has the bare skin of most of the Macaws ; over the beak is
a scarlet diadem ; the general body-colour is green, shading
from a kind of blue bloom on the head into rich yellowish green ;
the lower breast is scarlet, the primary wing-feathers blue. Its
full, long tail is extremely beautiful : on the upper side the
feathers are of deep claret colour shading into peacock blue,
.and on the under side soft yellow, like autumnal leaves. I
collect them at the moult, and the}^ are a study of shades.
The spring after my visit to Antwerp a I^ondon bird
dealer owed me #1. 1 had sent it for a Rockpeplar, which he
pretended to have despatched, but at last confessed he had not.
His man advised me to take anything I could get as the master
was vei-y hard up. I looked round the shop, but saw nothing

tempting. There were two Illigers in wretched plight, whose
cages showed that their internal state was all that a Parrot&amp;apos;s
shonld not be. They had belonged to a fancier of ill repute
who had fled from justice, and had been neglected ; I was offered
one for my sovereign. I hesitated and returned to the country ;
then I thought of the birds at Antwerp, and sent for the better
of the two. He dul}^ arrived, and certainly was a very
unpromising and uninteresting specimen. I sent him to my
warmest bird-room : it is in the grounds and far from the house,
where birds have a quiet time. When the windows are open I
have often listened below unseen, and heard funny essays at
talking; but the Illigerlong continued painfully timid, and clung
to the farthest side of the cage whenever he was approached.
He was named &amp;quot;Jerry,&amp;quot; and after a few months a boy, who
assisted in the aviaries, said he had called out &amp;quot;Jerry,&amp;quot; -- I dis-
believed the statement, but no doubt it was perfectl)&amp;apos;&amp;apos; true.
Parrots would do and say almost anything for this boy.
The next year &amp;quot; Jerry &amp;quot; came down from this room, which is
in a ver}^ lofty position, to the garden, and shared the regime of
several other Parrots, which .spend most of their days in a glazed
verandah or on terraces, and their nights in rooms over the
stables. B)^ degress he became much tamer, frequently repeated
his name in various voices, and then learnt to say almost ever&amp;gt;^-
thing that ni}^ favourite Patagonian Conure said. My only com-
plaint against him is that he has caused the Conure by degrees
almost to cease to talk from sheer disgust and jealous3^ When
I speak to the Conure &amp;quot;Jerry&amp;quot; answers for him, and then he is
silent. In one way only do they ever perform in unison ; they
sometimes jointly imitate a hen which has laid an egg, and set off
a whole troop of Bantams cackling. The lUiger will invariably
talk for me if I am alone, though not always if strangers are&amp;apos;
present. His sa3dngs, I confess, are only about a dozen. His
own name he says in several different voices, from a regular
scream when one is at a distance, to the softest whisper when
one&amp;apos;s ear is near- He is very affectionate and delights to kiss ;.
but he is not proof against one passion : he is crazily jealous,
and has occasionally bitten his attendants when he thought the}^
were attending too much to another bird. Through the whole
time (over three-and-a-half years) that I have had him, he has
constantly improved both intellectually and physically, and his
plumage is exquisitely close and glossy. It may be interesting
to some aviculturists to know that a bird, evidently of mature
years when I first had him, should have become, instead of sO&amp;apos;
wild and uncouth a creature, an educated and civilized one ; and

still more that his ph5&amp;apos;sical condition, so unpleasantly deranged,
should gradually have improved till at the end of three years he
was quite cured.
Last summer he busied himself for da^^s over a fastening
of his cage door, with the result that he at last broke it, raised
the door with his head, and flew off. At some distance I saw a
grand bird with outspread tail fly over an oak tree. Every bird
in the menagerie screamed, and I wondered which of my foreign
Pheasants had escaped this time, till I found &amp;quot;Jerry&amp;apos;s&amp;quot; tenantless
cage. At first he enjoyed his liberty much, but never went far.
From dawn the next day he conversed from tall fir trees ; the
day turned wet, and he amused himself in biting shoots off
walnut trees ; by the second morning he looked bored and took
much notice of all our proceedings. Then he gradually
descended a big copper beech. I held his cage up and he let
himself down to it, and was evidently delighted to be in it again.
Once more he got out, but within an hour flopped on to the cage
of another bird as it was being carried. He had found out that
liberty has its disadvantages, and now makes no serious attempts
to get out. I should have no fear whatever of turning him out
any day, save for the oak carving outside the house, or furniture
if he came in at a window ; released once in the bird-room he
quickly snapped off the pinnacle of a fine new cage.
I think the story of &amp;quot; Jerry &amp;quot; will show that an Illiger may
be a very fascinating and companionable pet.
Since the above lines were penned &amp;quot;Jerry&amp;apos;s&amp;quot; portrait has
appeared in the pages of the Feathered World.
THE INDIAN SHAMA.
By the Rev. Hubert D. Astley, F.Z.S.
(Illustrated by the Author).
A most charming cage-bird ! Bold, vivacious, easily kept
in good health, rich in colouring, though not gaudy, with a voice
of great melody and much power of mimicry, the Indian Shama
must necessarily rank amongst the most coveted of cage-birds.
In Tydekker&amp;apos;s &amp;quot; Royal Natural History&amp;quot; it is described as
delicate, requiring care in the colder climate of Great Britain.
It is true that if a Shama be exposed to draughts and improperly
fed and kept, this ma}&amp;apos; be the case ; but I have not found it to be
so. M}&amp;apos; Shamas have lived well, and the one from which I have
taken my sketch is now in magnificent plumage, ready on the
coldest morning to plunge into his bath, in which he splashes
until he has thoroughly wetted ever}^ gloss}^ feather about him.

His lameness is that of all individuals of his famil}^ that
I have ever seen. Show him the tin containing mealworms and
open his cage door ! He positively darts to you, settles on your
arm, or on the edge of the box, and the mealworm held in your
fingers has disappeared before you have time to say &amp;quot;Jack
Robinson.&amp;quot;
It is aggravating that hen birds should so seldom be
imported, for, if I remember rightly, a brood was successfully
raised in IvOndon by Mr. Phillipps.
B}^ looking at the illustration, anyone unacquainted with
the colours of the male bird can easily picture them in the mind&amp;apos;s
eye : his size being rather larger than the Robin ; the whole
head, throat and back a glossy blue-black with a splendid sheen
thereon, as in the plumage of a swallow; all the breast and
underparts a bright rich chestnut ; the wings dark brown, each
of the primaries edged with lighter brown ; the tail black in the
centre, the shorter and outside feathers being white, **&amp;apos; whilst the
tail-covei&amp;apos;ts show conspicuously in a patch of snowj&amp;apos; whiteness ;
the bill is black ; the legs and feet flesh -colour ; and the e5^es are
large and full like a Robin&amp;apos;s, and of deepest brown. The whole
of the outline of the bird is extremely graceful, much of which
grace is given by the length of the tail.
A Shama should never be kept in a small cage, and cane
or wooden bars are the best, care being taken that the perches
are placed so that the tail wdll not be rubbed or broken ; but it is
a bird which will preserve its plumage well from one autumn to
another, and its feathers do not seem to have the brittleness of
many of our English Warblers, such as the Nightingale and the
Blackcap.
A Shama fed upon some reliable insectivorous food, as
sold by men like Mr. Abrahams and Mr. Cross, will prosper ; but
fresh chopped raw beef, mealworms, fruit in season, and insects
should be given in addition to the food ordinarih^ placed freshly
each morning in the food- trough ; and don&amp;apos;t forget a big bath.
The Shama {Cittocinda tricolor) is a resident in India ; a
jungle bird, I believe ; where his beautiful voice must be a great
addition to the haunts of Peafowl and to jungle-life in general.
There the Shamas nest between April and June. Other species
of the same family are to be found in the Malay Peninsula,
the Andaman Islands and the Philippines.
* None of the tail-feathers of Cittocinda tricoloi- SlVC wholly white, even the outer having
each a black base. If the outer tail-feathers of Mr. Astley&amp;apos;s bird are wholly white, it is
not C. tricolor but C. suavis. -- R.P.

DEALERS&amp;apos; NAMES FOR BIRDS.

<bodyText confidence="0.997792307692308" page_id="32635506"  page_num="69" year="" vol="">
Sir, -- The compilation of a glossary of dealers&amp;apos; names appears to be
much desired; but it would be almost impossible for a single individual to
undertake it unless supported by a Committee of other members of this
Society.
In 1883 a Committee of the British Ornithological Union prepared
a list of British birds, which should be in the library of every British
observer. Could not the Avicultural Society form a Committee with an
enthusiast as Secretar}&amp;apos; and Editor ?
The Latin or so-called scientific, as well as the dealers&amp;apos; names, are
rather an uncertain quantity, and a Committee could give a standing to the
names selected, which could not be done by an individual.
Latterl}-, owing to the muddling of systems, systematic nomenclature
is now rather at a discount, and fire-side work is undervalued. Hence any
number of observations are offered to the public in a desultory and un-
indexed form.
According to mj&amp;apos; view the first thing to bedone would be to select
the regular Latin name in more common use for each species, and then
to arrange a glossar3^ \0x25A0
I need hardly add that such a Committee as I have suggested should
be mainly resident in town, and that the assistance by letter of country
members should be invited.
Chas. Louis Hktt.
Sir, -- In reply to the queries re names of birds, perhaps the following
list maybe found interesting. I have also given the names used by some
of the Australian dealers ; Australia is rich in birds -- there are 700 known
species, 600 of which are to be found in Queensland.

FOOD FOR SOFT-BILLED BIRDS.
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.99702644" page_id="32635508"  page_num="71" year="" vol="">
Sir, -- The article in the AviciiUurnl Magazine by Mr. Perkins, giving
his experience with some of the smaller Warblers was, I thought, particu-
larly interesting; and, while I do not feel competent to say just what was
the cause of his failure, I am strongly of opinion that if he had kept his
Willow Wrens, ChiffchafFs, and Sedge Warblers in cages indoors, either
together or separately, and fed them more sparingly, he would not have had
to record such a tale of woe.
The food for and feeding of soft-billed birds has been a pet subject of
mine for 3-ears, and I could fill many pages of our Magazine with records of
both success and failure. The main difficulty the keeper of soft-bills has
to cope with, is the fact that w&amp;apos;hat one bird will eat readily and thrive upon,
another of the same species will do neither.
In spite of many advertisements to the contrary, a perfect food has
yet to be found; and it is curious to compare the endless differences in the
mixtures to be seen in the food-tins of the various birds one sees on the
show-bench. In catering for the smaller Warblers I can recommend a
mixture of good ants&amp;apos; eggs and 3-olk of hard-boiled ^&amp;apos;g^ as a base. Bread
crumbs I do not believe in, as I am convinced that the smaller birds
eat only what they cannot avoid, through their being incorporated
in the mixture ; and the white of ^%% wdll disagree even with human
beings, especially in hot weather. To tlie ^gg and ants&amp;apos; eggs let
there be added fineh- chopped green stuff (lettuce, watercress, sprouts,
or cabbage). Meahvornis certain!}- ought to be given sparingly, and
ought to be cut in halves before being given.* Let me also give a
wrinkle in the preparing of eggs for consumption : don&amp;apos;t boil them, let
them gently simmer for twenty minutes, they will then turn out much
lighter and more easy of digestion than if boiled to the consistency of
leather-- This hint was given in a work on Poultry, published many years
ago, but few seem to know it or practise it. If the birds don&amp;apos;t thrive on
the mixture given above, I have found it good to add scraped raw lean beef;
but great care needs be exercised in giving this, as an overdose will bring
on diarrhoea, and in the case of larger birds, larks and thrushes, causes
baldness. Blackbeetles and cockroaches I have never known to disagree ;
and I have frequently been amazed at the ability of the Whinchat to sv/allow
quite gigantic specimens of these malodorous creatures.
I distinctly do not wish it to be understood that I have given the
onl}&amp;apos; formula on which the smaller Warblers can be kept, because I have
long since found out that there are many people who successfully keep
these interesting little creatures on quite different lines, nor do I contend
that I have given the best recipe. One&amp;apos;s ideas receive periodical shocks in
this connexion in a manner that effectualh&amp;apos; prevents conceit. Only a few
weeks ago, a gentleman who is very successful with Blackcaps told me his
method, and ants&amp;apos; eggs were conspicuous by their absence; and I remember
coming across a particularly fine Blackbird just as his owner was preparing
his food, and I asked the usual question -- &amp;quot; How do you feed it .?&amp;quot; the reply
was, &amp;apos;&amp;apos;On cheese, of coiirse ; what else would 3&amp;apos;ou give a Blackbird.&amp;apos;&amp;quot;
Needless to say, this reply was too much for me.
To the aviarist bent on keeping our British Warblers, I would say, in
conclusion, that cages are better than an outdoor aviary ; give good nourish-
\0x25A0 In my opinion cruel and iiunecessar\-.-- R.P.

iiig food, little and often ; closely observe each bird&amp;apos;s particular vaiiit}-, and
fall back on that at the first sign of debility, and if the signs of recover}&amp;apos;
are not apparent in a few hours give the poor creature its liberty while it
yet has the strength to fly and find what it requires.*
T. Marshai^i,.
Sir, -- Perhaps my way of feeding will interest some readers.
Bread crumbs, mashed boiled potatoes, finely chopped cooked beef or
mutton, and grated dog-biscuit, mixed, with sometimes a little boiled carrot
or boiled bullock&amp;apos;s liver (grated) added, and always a few whole groats thrown
on the top of the mixed food. The groats, I think, are excellent for all
birds; they give gloss to the plumage and a healthj&amp;apos;-looking excrement.
My Blackbird is fond of groats, also my Chinese Spectacle Thrush and
Piping Crow; but the .Shama, I think, hardly touches them. I always give
them to Canaries and all seed-eating birds that will eat them -- a few with
discretion.
When insect-food is scarce my substitiite is unbaked pie-paste, made
with flour and lard, then rolled between the fingers (with a little flour) the
size of small mealworms. The birds relish a few of these now and then.
The Rock Parrot will eat a piece the size of a nut with avidit}&amp;apos;.
SaMUEIv Burge.
Sir, -- Although I do not keep insect-eating birds, I could have
wished that some of the members who do would have given their opinion
of Sergeant Hanley&amp;apos;s diet of hard-boiled yolk of egg and lean raw beef
pounded together. I know his letters were unchallenged at the time they
appeared. It seemed to me that to breed Nightingales in an ordinary
breeding-cage was a very successful feat. But as no one saj&amp;apos;S anything about
his diet, it looks as though those who have experience consider it entirel}&amp;apos;
unsuitable.t
As to the feeding of lyories, a bun made of egg, flour, and sugar, stale,
and soaked in hot water, then squeezed dr}&amp;apos; and mashed with half its
quantity of dried fig, soaked in boiling water, will keep these birds in the
best of health.
In &amp;quot; Parrots in Captivity &amp;quot; I see that Dr. Greene dwells much on the
difiiculty of keeping the Many Coloured and Paradise Parrakeets alive. I
should not care to try the diet he reconnuends, and I very strongly suspect
the difficulty of keeping these birds consists in over-feeding, and not giving
enough exercise. Blue-bonnets, Manj&amp;apos;-coloured, and Paradise Parrakeets
are most restless birds, and shortish commons and plenty of room would
probably be found their best medicine.

vSiR, -- Perhaps it may be of interest to some of our members to learn
that I succeeded in keeping a Spotted Flycatcher for considerably over a
year on a mixture of ants&amp;apos; eggs scalded, and hard-boiled j-olk of egg, with
a plentiful supplj- of mealworms daily. I obtained the bird three 3-ears ao-o
at the h. &amp;. P. O. S., he then being in immature plumage ; I subsequently sent
him to the Palace where he got a card. I had some trouble with him duriuo-
his moult, which he took a long time to accomplish, but he was never &amp;quot; in
extremis &amp;quot; as Mr. FuUjames&amp;apos; Long-tailed Tit seems to have been. I had
unfortunately to leave m}^ birds for some six weeks to the care of an
individual whose experience in that line was extremelj&amp;apos; limited, and the Fl}--
catcher was one of several that succumbed during my absence. I should
not have mentioned the fact, had I not been told that the Spotted Flycatcher
is exceedingly difficult to keep for any length of time, and to successfully
cage-moult one quite an exception. I should not be surprised to learn
that his diet might have been very easily improved upon, and I am inclined
to agree with those who think that hard-boiled yolk is indigestible ; at the
same time I know of nothing to suggest as a substitute.
The Honej&amp;apos;-eaters and Bell-birds in my possession have been kept
with success on a mi.xture of bread-crumbs, potato, ants&amp;apos; eggs, and preserved
yolk of egg. Thrushes, Mocking-birds and the like have a preparation that
is bought locally, which seems to be composed of meal, crissel, ants&amp;apos; eo-o-s,
and crushed hemp ; this is made moist with raw grated carrot, and they
seem to do very well on it. I &amp;quot;ring the changes&amp;quot; occasionallj- with a
mixture recommended by Mr. V. Castellan, but the principal ingredients
are, I fanc}&amp;apos;, much the same.
Starlings and Pastors are fed on whatever is over from the others;
they seem to eat anj- and everything, and thrive on it too.
BulbulsandTanagers have a diet similar to the Hone^&amp;apos;-eaters, with the
addition of plenty of ripe fruit ; those most delightful of all birds to my
mind, the Green Bulbuls, existing almost exclusivel}&amp;apos;^ on the latter -- five
which have been in my possession for a length}&amp;apos; period consume per head
more than twice the amount of anj- other F&amp;apos;ruit-eater in the bird-room.
With regard to birds which are b}&amp;apos; natiire carnivorous, meat in some
shape or form is a necessit}^ and the result, especialh- if kept in a confined
space, is, to put it mildly, odoriferous. I have found that, to a great extent,
this unpleasant characteristic can be remedied by providing a larger suppl};-
of insect food, and a proportionally smaller quantity of raw meat. The
European Roller, which is, as far as ni}&amp;apos; limited experience goes, one of the
worst offenders in this respect, is fed largel}- on black beetles, gentles, and
earthworms, the latter from one to two inches long; this with the addition
of a few mealworms will obviate the necessity of much raw meat. One of
the three in my possession has occasionally condescended to taste the
mixture provided for some of the other birds, but apparently does not
relish it.
A fine Himalayan Pie lives almost exclusively on Sparrows, and he
could not be termed &amp;quot; nifFy &amp;quot; by the most fastidious.
Two species of the family Lauiidse, viz. : the Red-backed Shrike, and
the Woodchat are fed on ants&amp;apos; eggs and preserved yolk, beetles, earthworms
and gentles, etc., and do well on it ; a tiny morsel of raw beef very
occasionall}&amp;apos; is all the meat they get. They are in every way perfectly
&amp;quot;sweet.&amp;quot; Rus.SEi.1, Humphrys.

THE SCHEDULE FOR THE CRYSTAL PALACE SHOW.

As the Crj&amp;apos;stal Palace Bird Show is this 5&amp;apos;ear under new nianagemeiit
the schedule is of more than usual interest, and perhaps a little space may
be usefully employed in comparing it with its predecessor.
I cannot take upon myself to express an opinion upon the classification
of British Birds, but as far as I am capable of judging it seems to be fairly
good. There are one or two more classes, but the amount of prize money
distributed among them seems to be about the same as before. There is a
class for &amp;quot; A.O.V. resident Finch or Bunting,&amp;quot; and the other A.O.V. classes
are reserved for Insectivorous Birds only -- this seems to be a decided
improvement. The Migrator}^ Birds are placed among the British, and not,
as before, in a section by themselves ; and the A.O.V. Migratory are divided
into two classes -- one for Insectivorous and the other for vSeed-eating.
There is a class for &amp;quot; Any Variety of European Bird not included in the
National British Bird and Mule Club&amp;apos;s List&amp;quot; -- why this class is placed in the
British section is not very apparent.
There are five extra classes in the Foreign section, but the average
amount of prize money per class is somewhat reduced. The classification
for 1S97, for which it is an open secret that Dr. vSimpson was mainly
responsible, is somewhat closely adhered to : witli,five extra classes it tizight
bave been greatly improved. The chief alteration among the small seed-
eaters is that in place of the class for &amp;quot;Any species of Grassfinch, Mannikin,
or Waxbill, not previously mentioned,&amp;quot; there are now two -- &amp;quot;An}&amp;apos; variety
of Waxbill,&amp;quot; and &amp;quot; Any varietj&amp;apos; of Mannikin.&amp;quot; The iise of the word
&amp;quot;variety,&amp;quot; when species is intended, is silly -- and it looks all the more
stupid because &amp;quot;species&amp;quot; is retained in the case of those classes in which
there has been no alteration. I have before pointed out that the huge class
for Grassfinches, Mannikins, ami Waxbills sadly wanted dividing, but it is
disappointing that the division has been so carelessly effected. The result is
that the rarer Grassfinches cannot be exhibited at all. The common ones
can appear in the class for &amp;quot; Any variety of Foreign Bird other than Parrots,
pairs not to exceed #2, single birds not to exceed ;^&amp;quot;i &amp;quot; ; but such birds as
the Long-tailed Grassfinch, the Red-headed Finch, and Bicheno&amp;apos;s Finch
.(unless their owners are willing to part with them at a low price) are
altogether excluded. Probably the framers of the Schedule intended that
the Grassfinches should be shown in the Finch class, as they have changed
the wording of that class from &amp;quot;Any species of True Finch, Bunting or
Grosbeak not previously mentioned &amp;quot; to &amp;quot; Anj&amp;apos; other variety Finch, Bunting
or Grosbeak.&amp;quot; If this was the intention it is scarceh&amp;apos; necessary to say that
it has not been carried out -- bj&amp;apos; all rules of construction &amp;quot; Finch, Bunting or
Grosbeak&amp;quot; can mean nothing but &amp;quot;any species of FringillincE, E?nberizi7ia,
or Coccothraustincc&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos;&amp;apos; (that is. any species of Fringillida;), and cannot possibly
include Ploceidce. The judge would undoubtedly feel boixnd to disqualify&amp;apos;
Grassfinches if exhibited in this class, for to do otherwise would be to show
himself as ignorant of the most elementary principles of classification
as the framers of the Schedule obviously are. If the words &amp;quot;Bunting or
Grosbeak &amp;quot; had been omitted, it might have been reasoiiably contended
that the word &amp;quot; Finch &amp;quot; is used in a wide popular sense so as to include all
Finch-like birds, but the addition of the names of these two sub-families
shows clearly that the word I-&amp;apos;inch is used in the sense of True Finch onl}- :

for if &amp;quot;Finch &amp;quot; means all Finch-like Birds, why particularise two sub-
families ? vSuch a construction would be as ridiculous as if one were to say
&amp;quot; any other variety of mammal, dog or cat.&amp;quot;
The division of the A.O.V. Insectivorous or Fruit-eatin.^ birds into
two classes is a welcome change. The classes for common birds are also a
good notion -- there is one for Parrots and one for other birds. The only
alteration of importance in the Parrot classes is the formation of a separate
class for Macaws : this is a welcome and long-needed reform.

BREAD FOR SOFT-BIIvLED BIRDS.

<bodyText confidence="0.985926722222222" page_id="32635512"  page_num="75" year="" vol="">
Sir, -- I am i-ather astonished to see one statement in the letter by Mr.
Fulljames in the January No. of the Magazine, namely, that Nightingales
and &amp;quot;Warblers would not eat bread, or would not digest it if they did.
I believe Mr. Fulljames is a subscriber to &amp;quot; British Birds with
their Nests and Eggs,&amp;quot; and therefore he must be aware that one of the Night-
ingales which I hand-reared in 1887 was fed partly upon bread from August
18S7 to Atigust 1888, and another from August 1887 to December 1888 ; and I
am sure that hand-reared Nightingales naturally have not the same power
of resisting the influence of adverse circumstances as trapped birds. But,
considering how closel}^ related the Nightingale is to the Robin, and the
fact that the latter bird, during hard winters, feeds niainl}&amp;apos; upon bread
when in the neighboiirhood of towns and villages, it surely seems an un-
warranted supposition that this food cannot be digested by the Nightingale.
From personal experience I can positively assert that the Blackcap
and Garden Warbler do eat bread, and that it does not disagree with them :
my present example of the latter species has twice moulted in my possession,
and is now in perfect health and plumage ; it not only eats bread and
uncooked apple, but swallows a good deal of canary- and millet-seed of its
own free will, 5^et it never looks unhappy or out of sorts.
I think it is a mistake for an aviculturist to assert positively that any
food which is wholesome and nutritions in itself cannot be digested by any
group of birds (at an}&amp;apos; rate until he has given it a fair and impartial trial).
Mr. Fulljames is a man of judgment, and he acted wisely in administering
beef-tea to a sickly bird ; yet he goes out of his waj&amp;apos; to declare that a far
more natural food is indigestible. This curious prejudice against the staff
of life is yevy puzzling to me : I use a considerable quantity of bread every
week and yet my soft-food eaters are healthj&amp;apos;. Surely for a Blue-bird
to have kept in vigour and good condition for nine j^ears, a Liothrix in
moderate health for ten 3ears, a Blackbird in perfect health for nearly five
years, a Pileated Jay for four or five 3-ears (with many others for shorter
terms) should be a pretty good test of the value of bread as one item, in
soft-food mixtures, M&amp;apos;hich is not injurious to health. My English Jay and
my Nuthatch will eat pieces of crumb bread broken from a loaf with relish ;
I have even seen ni}&amp;apos; Superb Tanager do the same, although I rarely offer it
bread alone.

Sir, -- I hope Mr. Todd will not think me discourteous in expressing-
regret that he should be testing the hardiness of several species of foreign
birds. I have kept many hundreds of foreign birds, -- granivorous, fru-
givorous, insectivorous, large and small, birds of prey, ground birds, Crows,
Jays, Pies, Finches, Waxbills (including Green Avadavats), and British
migrants, and the more I see of them the more I am satisfied that to
subject them to unnecessary cold is not only cruel, but a great mistake.
Many die and many live -- and it is wonderful what trials some will stand;
but I am convinced that a large proportion of those which are supposed to
have successfull)- passed the test do not live out half their days, ofttimes
not a quarter.
Look at some of these little birds, Green Avadavats if j&amp;apos;ou like, in the
cold ; the greater part of the day tlie}^ spend huddled together in some box
or nest ; and when compelled to venture out for food they are lumpy and
fluff}&amp;apos;. Look at the same specimens in a moderatelj&amp;apos; warm room ; they are
tight, sleek, active, and as happy as the day is long (I extend the length of
the winter da5-s with artificial light). The larger birds act differently,
usually sitting shivering on their perches, excepting the different species
of Mynahs and Starlings, who naturall}- take to the nests and boxes; they
feel the cold acutely, but do not die nearly so readily as the others. I
regularly let many of my larger birds out for a constitutional di^ring the
winter, some even in severe weather, but only for a limited time, longer or
shorter according to the day, and the change is distinctl}- beneficial. When
the window is opened, they rush out like mad things, with joyous shrieks
and yells. I have but to give the signal, and back they go again as docile
as dogs, usualh&amp;apos; more so than children, and are safely shut up in their cosy
room. I no more allow them to stay out in the cold as long as the}&amp;apos; like
than I would allow a child to do so.
Mr. Todd admits the importance of protecting the females from cold,
and says it would certainly be advisable to separate the sexes during the
winter. But most of the Waxbills and foreign Finches are truly miserable
when separated. And more than half the pleasure of keeping these little
creatures consists in seeing them together and watching their deep affection
for one another. Of course it is sometimes absokitely necessary to separate
the sexes -- but even human beings cannot alwaj&amp;apos;s have their own way ; and
those species which separate in their wild state should be kept separate in
captivity.

NESTING OF THE GOLDEN-CROWNED
PARRAKEET OF NEW ZEALAND.

By Gko. K. Bouskh,!,.
It was late in the season to allow my Golden-crowns to
nest, and the only portion of my aviary which I could allot to
them at the time was occupied by a pair of Turquoisines and
a pair of Budgerigars, the latter of which had young ; but
before these had left the husk the Golden-crowns had begun
to prospect on their own account ; and as I did not want the
young Budgerigars to be turned out of their nest, I decided to
put up another husk, and it was in this that the Golden-
crowned Parrakeets settled down to nest.
The hen built a cup-shaped nest, using the fibre off the
inside of the cocoanut-husk, and in this she laid five pure white
eggs, which were very round, and, I think, large for the size of the
bird (they almost equalled in size the ^%% of the Rosella). The
female alone incubated the eggs, and a most dutiful parent she
was, rarely leaving her nest except to be fed by her mate.
Incubation lasted about twenty-one days from the laying of the
first Q.&amp;apos;g^. As I stated in my last paper, the first egg was laid on
the 24th of October, and the fifth on the 28th : this would fix
the time for hatching to be about the 14th of November. You
can imagine how anxious I was when the 5th of November
arrived, for my neighbours had their children to please and
could not be expected to study my birds. I was greatly afraid
that the illuminations and flashes of light would frighten the
hen bird off her nest, and so let the precious eggs get cold ; to
obviate this, I covered the glass portion of the aviary with dust
sheets ; the loud reports I could not keep out, and so far as noise
was concerned, the birds had to take their chance. I have read

somewhere that &amp;quot;a loud report or the slamming of a door will
kill young birds in the shell;&amp;quot; mine, however, had a fair test
in that respedl on the 5th of November last. But the hen
Golden-crown was not so easily startled, and proved herself a
most assiduous sitter.
When first hatched the young were covered with a dirty
yellow down ; the}^ grew very rapidly ; and during the first week
the hen bird did not leave them much, but the cock bird fed
her both whilst she brooded her young and when she came off&amp;apos;
for a little exercise. As the young got stronger, she left them
more frequentl}^, and when about ten daj&amp;apos;-s old both birds entered
the nest to feed their young. They began to feather when about
fourteen days old, and were fully fledged when about a month old.
The young did not leave the nest until they were five weeks old.
They were then very much like their parents, except that the
crimson band above the upper mandible was hardly perceptible,
and the patch of golden-yellow less bright, the red under the
wangs was only just indicated, and the beak was flesh colour,
being rather darker at the tip. The j^oung were reared on
canary, hemp and millet seed, and in addition, about thirty to
forty mealworms per diem, and stale bread soaked in cold water
and then squeezed nearly dry.
About a fortnight or so after the young had left the nest,
I was so unfortunate as to lose three out of the five young ones :
they died without giving the least warning. The last one of
the three I sent to a well-known aviculturist for post-mo7ie?Ji
examination, and received from him the following report : &amp;quot; The
crop was filled with hemp, the liver was much congested, and the
kidneys were affected although to a lesser extent ; but there was
great effusion of blood on the surface and in the substance of the
brain which vv&amp;apos;as the immediate cause of death, the congestion
of the liver being the remote one. You would find a diet of
canary seed and oats preferable to what you have been giving.
The bird was a male and in excellent condition.&amp;quot;
It would seem quite possible that the hemp seed was the
main cause of the death of the young ones, as the old birds are
particularly fond of hemp and will eat no other seed so long as
there is any hemp left. I now only give them a little occasion-
ally. The remaining young are doing verj^ well and can scarcely
be distinguished from their parents.

By Thomas MarshalIv.
Ill attempting to say something respecting the 472
specimens of British birds at the 1898 Crystal Pakice gathering
of birds, and their owners, there seems such a variety of lines
to go upon that one hardly knows which will be the most
acceptable to the readers of our Magazine. To criticise the birds
is only doing what many of our members have done for them-
selves, to criticise the judging is to bring down upon one&amp;apos;s self
the wrath of the successful exhibitor, and to write of the catering
for the exhibits is, we know from experience, an utter waste of
labour. It was to be hoped, after what I stated in the Magazine
last year, and which was afterwards borne out by Mr. Fulljames
and Mr. A. Jones, that this year the German paste abomination
would be conspicuous by its absence ; but no, there it was as
plentiful and as sticky as of 3-ore.
To come to the birds, however, the specimens staged at
this show were the best I ever looked over. Beginning with the
Bullfinches the class was one long string of grand birds, and yet
the winner (1,381) was such a superb specimen that the judge
could have no difficulty in awarding the prize ; some of his other
awards would probably have been disturbed if the two Bullfinches
wrongly entered in the Redpoll class had been in their proper
place. The winners of first, second, and third prizes in the
Goldfinch class were all the propert}^ of Mr. Williams, of Ponty-
pridd, and it is interesting to note that each of this gentleman&amp;apos;s
birds got a prize, and also that another gentleman of the same
name did the same thing with each of his fifteen entries ! As,
however, these latter were hybrids, the}&amp;apos; are outside the province
of this paper. The fourth prize Goldfinch was the propertj-
of another Mr. Williams, one of our members, and was very
unlucky to be beaten.
The Chaffinches were not, as a class, very remarkable,
though there were several very good looking birds staged, and after
selecting these the judge must have had some trouble in awarding
the prizes, there being so very little to choose between them. I
thought that prizes three and four might have been reversed.
The man who wins a prize with a Chaffinch must always be
looked upon as a fortunate individual, and deserving what he
wins, as it is one of the most difficult birds to get steady (tame-
ness, as We understand the word, being out of the question).

months of care often become wasted at the last moment in the
transferring of the bird to the show-cage.
I^innets formed the next class, and these birds are such
favourites of mine that it would not take much effort on mj^ part
to become effusive on their merits. The winner of the second
prize must have misbehaved himself while under the judge&amp;apos;s
e3-e, or he must have been first, as he was full of qualit}^ all over.
1,505 was a Greenfinch, and was, of course, thrown out as being
wrong class ; as it came from Yorkshire, where Greenfinches
are commonly called Green Linnets, the owner&amp;apos;s mistake is
pardonable.
The next class (Lesser Redpolls, and Twites) contained, as it
generally does, a large proportion of freshly- caught birds, which,
however, were very properly not allowed to win over genuine
cage-moulted specimens. 1,564 and 1,565 were shewn in cages
provided with all the paraphernalia generally used by fanciers
for making these intelligent little creatures &amp;quot;do something for
their living,&amp;quot; by drawing up a small bone bucket out of a water
receptacle suspended some foot or so below the cage. Small
things are always associated with small minds, and it is not
difficult to form an opinion as to the mental calibre of those who
indulge in freaks of this kind. Amongst the Siskins, we find
last year&amp;apos;s winner (as in the Bullfinch class) quite unnoticed by
the judge, and yet such is the fate which natural^, sooner or
later, befalls champions, feathered and otherwise ; and when that
happens, owners should accept the inevitable, and allow their
birds to rest on their laurels. The winner in this class was a
remarkably fine bird, but might have been beaten by 1,570 (which
took third) had it not been over done in the matter of colour-
food. 1,578 was a capital Black-headed Siskin, and consequently
was marked wrong class.
The next class for A. O. V. resident Finch or Bunting
was very interesting, and here again an old winner, Mr. Raine&amp;apos;s
Hawfinch, was unnoticed ; the first prize went to an exceedingly
bright Yellowhammer. It has long been known to me that the
further one gets away from London the better for getting good
Yellowhammers, and this view was confirmed on m^^ turning to
the Index of the Catalogue and there finding that this winner
comes from Aberdeen. Essex Yellowhammers are very dowdy
creatures, and yet, curious to record, Essex Chaffinches are the
best in England; but this is a digression. The second prize
went to a very good Greenfinch, and the third to another Yellow-
hammer, thus leaving the ten Hawfinches, all of which were
good, out in the cold.

The Skylarks and Robins were two very ordinary classes.
Messrs. Killbury&amp;apos;s old champion Skylai&amp;apos;k was easily first, and this
for the sixth year in succession ; next to it I should have placed
1,634, which had to be content with a V. H. C. None of the
Robins were up to show standard ; the winner was a goodly
shaped specimen, but by no means a bright one.
Blackbirds come next, and we are again treated to a sight
of some superb specimens. Messrs. Hobbs&amp;apos; bird (first) was
wonderfully steady, and had a beautiful eye cere ; while next to
it was Mr. Morgan&amp;apos;s (1,672, V. H. C), with an ideally shaped
head and intense blackness of body feather.
In the Thrush class old birds were conspicuous by their
absence. Clean-legged, racy, up-standing young birds comprised
the bulk of this class, and a better lot of Thrushes have probably
never been staged ; some grandly marked birds were not awarded
prizes, but the judge had a by no means easy task.
In the Starling class we were again brought face to face
with old friends, and once more &amp;quot; talent &amp;quot; has had to give way to
&amp;quot; appearances.&amp;quot; The birds catalogued as &amp;quot; talkers,&amp;quot; or otherwise
accomplished, were absolutely unnoticed by the judge ; the first
prize bird was a particularly well marked bird, full of &amp;quot;work,&amp;quot;
and, to my mind, 1,703 V.H.C., might have been second. 1,720
was Mr. FuUjames&amp;apos; &amp;quot;Jacob,&amp;quot; who had a deal to say, but I am
sorry to say failed to make himself &amp;quot; understanded of me.&amp;quot;
Class 107 for Magpies, Jackdaws, Jays, and Choughs was a
very small one, but all the birds were in a first rate condition. I
thought 1,723 V. H. C. a better and smarter Pie than the winner
1,724, which seemed dull and listless. Mr. Fulljames&amp;apos; and Mr.
Gibbons&amp;apos; Choughs (1,729 second, and 1,725 V. H. C.) were really
beautiful exhibits.
One of the most interesting classes in the whole show
was that for Pied birds and Albinos, and in this class were
some charming specimens : notably, 1,732, a Cinnamon Yellow-
hammer (unnoticed), and 1,742, an Albino Skylark (V. H. C),
small, and undoubtedly a hen, but a true Albino with pink eyes.
Mr. Fulljames&amp;apos; Cinnamon Starling was in grand condition, and
was deservedly first in a class most difficult to judge. Two birds
in this class well worthy of mention were Mr. Swailes&amp;apos; Yellow
Greenfinch, 1,731, and Mr. Hay&amp;apos;s White Greenfinch, 1,738, both
of which were good exhibits and very uncommon.
Of the resident insectivorous birds not larger than a
Woodlark there is little to be said. Mr. Staines&amp;apos; Stonechat
and Mr. Poynter&amp;apos;s Jenny Wren were first and second, and I was

pleased to see that both of them were independent of the fare
provided by the authorities ; had it been otherwise, neither of
these interesting little creatures would ever have seen their home
again alive. Mr. Maxwell took third prize with a very good
Grey Wagtail ; and here let me say that a Wagtail always seems
to nie to be more at home on a show bench than most of the
birds that find their way there, and generally makes a graceful
and charming exhibit.
Noticing that the first bird in the next class was catalogued
as a &amp;quot;Peewit&amp;quot; I was looking forward to interviewing alive, and
at close quarters, that bird of tradition, cursed of the Covenanters
and blessed of the Tyrwhitts (whose family name is a lyincoln-
shire rendering of their call-notes), but alas, the occupant of the
cage was a hen Ring Ouzel, and as the class was for larger
resident insectivorous, was out of place. A Great Grey-backed
Shrike, the first I remember to have seen on show, took first
prize, and a well-shewn Woodpecker took second. It is not
often that one has the pleasure of hearing a Nightingale singing
*on the show bench, but that shewn by Mr. Maxwell certainly
sang on the occasion of my visit : the prize, however, went to
Mr. Preston&amp;apos;s &amp;apos;Gale, the only entry that gentleman had in the
show.
Three more classes and I shall have got through m)^ task.
Taking the last first we have, I believe, quite a new class, i.e.,
one for Any Variety of European Bird not included in the
N. B. B. and M. Club list. Not the least interesting exhibit in
the class under consideration was a Crested I^ark, which was
unnoticed by the judge, owing to its obvious want of condition.
A capital Blue-throated Warbler was awarded first prize, and
Mr. Russell Humphrj^s was fortunate to get second with his
Rose-coloured Pastor.
Classes 112 and 113 were for Migratory Insectivorous and
Seed-eating respectivel}^ and the former class shewed us the
advisabilit}^ of yet another division in the classification, for fair-
play can hardly be dealt out where such birds as Ring Ouzels
and Fieldfares are opposing Whitethroats and Redstarts. As it
was, the smaller birds took the prizes, and the larger ones went
without. 1808A was catalogued as a Blackcap, but the cage
contained the remnant of a Swallow.
In the Seed-eating Migratory class such extremes did
not exist, and the Bramblefinches secured the prizes -- the
winner, i,82oa, being a particularly well marked specimen. The
fourth prize went to a very good Mealy Redpoll, albeit it was not
cage-moulted.

Comparing the wliole show with many of its predecessors
the quality and condition of the exhibits were strikingly superior,
and exhibitors generally seem to be acquiring a predilection for
\0x25A0only such birds as are more or less difficult to keep, and the
.absence of Ja^^s, Twites, Snow, Lapland, and Corn Buntings,
Tree and Reed Sparrows bears out my remark.

SMALL FOREIGN BIRDS AND DOVES AT THE
CRYSTAL PALACE.

By A. G. Butler, Ph.D.
The show of small foreigners (but especially of soft-food
\0x25A0eaters) was exceptionally fine this year, so that the task of
judging must have been unusally heavy ; it is therefore not at
all surprising that not a few exhibitors are dissatisfied, and (in
some cases) I think, with reason : nevertheless every judge must
he guided by his own opinion ; and if, in certain classes, he
\0x25A0elects to regard perfect plumage of greater importance than
rariti^ there is no law to prevent his doing so.
The names given to the birds in many classes were less
accurate than they usuallj^ are (which is saying a good deal),
perhaps one of the most comical things being the substitution of
a Ring-ouzel for a Peewit in the British Classes.
Class 115. -- GOULDIAN FiNCHEt&amp;apos;, ETC.
The first prize was given to Mr. E. Grifiith&amp;apos;s male Red-
headed Gouldian, which was perfect in plumage though, if rarity
;had been taken into consideration, Mr. Maxwell&amp;apos;s Three-coloured
Parrot-finch (though not perfect in feathering) must have stood
#rst ; it was however not noticed. The second prize went to a
&amp;quot;very good pair of tj&amp;apos;pical Parrot-finches exhibited by Mr. H. B.
Smith ; the third to Mr. Maxwell&amp;apos;s pair of Gouldian&amp;apos;s, fourth to
a good cock Black-head exhibited by Mrs. H. W. Wickens, and
the fifth to Mr. Maxwell&amp;apos;s cock Pin-tailed Nonpareil (entered as
#L pair). (")
Class 116. -- Java Sparrows.
A very beautiful white pair, exhibited in too small a cage
by Mr. C. G. Knowles, carried off the first prize ; whilst Mr.
H. B. Smith&amp;apos;s birds took the second and third prizes. I had so
few Greys to choose from this year, most of my last year&amp;apos;s young
birds having been imperfect white specimens, that I stood little
\0x25A0chance of a card.

Class 117. -- Weavers and Whydahs.
Messrs. Fulljames and Maxwell took four of tlie five prizes,
the first and third being given to Crimson-throated Whydahs,
the second to Mr. Smith&amp;apos;s Orj^x (still nearly in full breeding
plumage), whilst the fifth prize was given to a common, cheap,
though not frequently imported bird -- the Half-masked Weaver.
Class 118. -- Waxbii,i.s.
I fail to understand why exhibitors enter Bicheno&amp;apos;s Finches
in this Class, since they undoubtedly stand between Zebra and
Cherry Finches, having the call-note of the former with a vague
approach in coloration to the latter: they certainly are not Wax-
bills (a) ; those exhibited were apparently two cock birds. The
first prize was properly awarded to Mr. Maxwell&amp;apos;s splendid pair
of Violet-eared Waxbills, the second to his Rufous-tailed Grass-
finches, the third to his Crimson-finches, all of these being in
very good condition.
Class 119. -- Mannikins.
Mr. Maxwell&amp;apos;s Pectoral-finch (entered as a pair) took the
first prize and Mr. Fulljames&amp;apos; pair stood second : his Magpie
Mannikins did not look to me like a pair, and Mr. Abrahams
probably disqualified them for that reason.
Class 122. -- CARDINAI.S.
Mr. Davis&amp;apos; Thick- billed Cardinal was hardly in show
condition, therefore only got a card, Miss A. P. Jackson taking
first prize with a good male Green. Mr. C. Verrall&amp;apos;s Pope
took second, Mrs. Frostick&amp;apos;s Virginian third, Mr. Verrall&amp;apos;s male
Green fourth.
Class 123. -- Mixed Finches.
This Class is a curious jumble of Fringilline \0x25A0d.w^ Ploceine
birds, and I must confess that I cannot follow the judging : I
should have given Mr. Maxwell&amp;apos;s pair of lyong-tailed Grass-
finches first and Mr. Russell Humphrys&amp;apos; Trumpeter Bullfinches
second, but in other points I should not have done as our
experienced judge did : my idea is that Mr. Maxwell&amp;apos;s Mexican
Siskin merited a third, Mr. Housden&amp;apos;s Red-headed Finch a
fourth, and Mr. Swaysland&amp;apos;s Yellow-headed Sparrows at least a
fifth : I do not understand common birds like Parson- finches
(though they were not a bad^pair) taking a prize at all ; but it is
evident that, in nearly all cases, plumage was considered before
rarity.

Class 124, -- DOVKS AND QUAII^S.
The names of the Doves were curiously mixed : Australian
Crested Doves being entered as &amp;apos; Diamond Doves,&amp;apos; Bronze- wings
as &amp;apos; Crested,&amp;apos; Peaceful as &amp;apos; Zebra.&amp;apos; In this Class the rarest birds
(Mr. Housden&amp;apos;s Nicobar Pigeons) took the highest honours and,
unless I am much mistaken, two cock Peaceful Doves, exhibited
by the lyondon Fanciers&amp;apos; Supply Association, the second ; they
were entered &amp;apos; Two Zebra Doves, Cock.&amp;apos;
Class 125. -- Tanagers and Bulbui^S.
This was a splendid Class and really required several extra
firsts to do it justice. To my mind Mr. Maxwell&amp;apos;s Blue and Black
Tanager, which took fifth, should have stood first, both for rarity
and colouring ; Mr. Humphrys&amp;apos; Blue-winged Green Bulbul
second ; his Black-crested Yellow Bulbuls third : Mr. Maxwell&amp;apos;s
Tricoloured Tanager extra third, his Greenish Tanager fourth,
and his curiously coloured Tanager (No. 2,014) of which I do
not know the name, fifth. I cannot see that birds which have
become so common in the market as ordinary Green Bulbuls,
or (much less) Red -eared Bulbuls, have any claim to more than
V.H.C. for condition.
Class 126. -- Crows, Stari^ings, etc.
Mr. Russell Humphrys&amp;apos; magnificent Occipital Blue Pie
well deserved its place at the head of this Class ; but Mrs. W. H.
Field&amp;apos;s IvOng-tailed Glossy Starling was somewhat bobtailed and
not to be compared with Mr. H. B. Smith&amp;apos;s Purple-headed
Starling (No. 2,025). I should also have preferred Mr. Housden&amp;apos;s
Mexican Jay to Mr. Humphrys&amp;apos; Andaman Starling, although the
latter was a very nice bird. Mrs. Field&amp;apos;s Blue-hooded Jay (fourth)
is a good bird and deserved its place, though a year in a good-
sized flight would improve it. Mr. Fulljames&amp;apos; Malabar Mynah
(fifth) was a capital specimen of a common species ; I prefer
Mr. Housden&amp;apos;s Crested Mynahs, rarer and far more intelligent
birds.
Class 127. -- Smai^ler Insectivorous Birds.
Mr. Maxwell&amp;apos;s beautiful male of Dac7iis cayana surely had
a higher claim to a first place than his much commoner though
lovely little Spectacled birds (not &amp;apos; Finches &amp;apos;), yet this Sugar-bird
only got a V.H.C. : I cannot, with all deference to the great
experience of an old friend, comprehend this decision.
Class 128. -- Larger Insectivorous Birds.
Mr. Russell Humphrys&amp;apos; Racquet-tailed Drongo took first.
I think I should have given preference to Mr. Maxwell&amp;apos;s Green-

crested Touracou (wliich was in much better plumage, in spite
of the quantities of sawdust which it was fed upon) {a) : altogether,.
I quite approved of the judging in this Class, and felt inclined to
pat my instructor upon the back (which is the way of the world
when the judgment of the pupil chimes in with that of his
preceptor).
Class 129. -- A Mixed SeIvUng-CIvAss.
I should have given a prize to Mr. Fulljames&amp;apos; Madagascar
Weaver in breeding plumage, in preference to the not very grand
pair of Zebra-finches which took fifth prize, and I should have
preferred No. 2,074 to 2,076 (fourth prize), which struck me as-
not being quite up to the mark : otherwise I was satisfied.

By H. R. FiLivMER.
The placing of the Class for &amp;quot; Any variety of European
Bird not included in the N. B. B. and M. C. List,&amp;quot; in the British
Secftion is one of those things which, I suppose, only a &amp;quot;fancier&amp;quot;&amp;apos;
can understand, a mere aviculturist certainly cannot. The Class
declares itself to be for non-British birds, and j^et it is a British-
bird Class ! But let that pass. There were good birds in
this Class, and Mr. Maxwell&amp;apos;s Blue-throated Warbler was
deservedly first. Mr. Russell Humphrys&amp;apos; Rose-coloured Pastor
was second, and Mr. Fulljames&amp;apos; Blue Rock Thrush and Barred
Warbler respectively third and fourth. The Class also contained
three Waxwings, two Ortolan Buntings, a Crested Lark, a Pied
Rock Thrush, and another Blue Rock Thrush (decidedly inferior
to the prize-winner). It was a most interesting colledtion of
birds, and no fault could, I think, be found with the judging.
There were no less than five pairs of Parrot Finches, none
however in really perfect condition. These birds moult twice in the
year, and are usually a long time over it, so that they are moult-
ing during a large part of each year -- this makes them very
trying birds to the exhibitor. There was besides a Three-coloured
Parrot Finch (^ErytJmira trichiva) a rarer but, to my thinking, a
less beautiful species.
Passing over the Java Sparrows (about which there is
(a) I cannot understand why fruit-eating&amp;apos; birds are expected to digest sawdust,
I should almost as soon mix tintacks with their food : sand or earth in the tray would
be far better.-- A. G. B.

never much to be said), and the Weavers and Whydahs (about
which much might be said, though not by me), I come to the
Waxbills. Here were Violet-eared (properly first). Rufous-tails,
Crimson Finches, Dufresne&amp;apos;s Waxbills, SydneyWaxbills,Bicheno&amp;apos;s
Finches, St. Helenas, and a hen Cordon Bleu. Crimson Finches
are commoner than Dufresne&amp;apos;s Waxbills, but the former were
placed over the heads of the Dufresnes, probably because the
latter were a little out of condition. Mr. Storey&amp;apos;s St. Helenas
were of the small variety, no larger than the Grey Waxbill. The
Bicheno&amp;apos;s Finches were disqualified. Besides the Bicheno&amp;apos;s
Finches in this Class, the judge disqualified, in other Classes, a
pair of Magpie Mannikins and a pair of Popes. These entries
were presumably all disqualified on the ground that they were
not true pairs : they are all birds in which the outward differences
between the sexes (if there be any outward difference at all) are
of an extremely slight and uncertain character, and, in my
opinion, the judge would have been wiser to give these exhibits
the benefit of the doubt.
The Mannikin Class contained only seven entries, one or
two of which were absent. Both prizes went to Pe(5loral
Finches.
There was nothing of special interest in the Cardinal
Class, except Mr. Davis&amp;apos;s Thick-billed Cardinal, and that has
been seen once or twice before at the Palace. This year it was
in rather rough feather.
The Class for &amp;quot; Any other variety of Finch, Bunting, or
Grosbeak&amp;quot; was a most interesting one, and contained thirty-
three entries -- unfortunately the judge failed to do justice to
it. A Virginian Cardinal, a Black-headed Mannikin, and a
pair of Pecfloral Finches were rightly marked &amp;apos;wrong-class,&amp;apos; and
the same course ought to have been taken with the Grass-finches,
of which there were nearly a dozen entries. It is perfedlly clear
that Grass-finches had no business in a class for &amp;quot; Finches,
Buntings and Grosbeaks,&amp;quot; but if the judge decided to admit
them he should, in common fairness, have refrained from
&amp;quot;wrong-classing&amp;quot; any of the entries in the show. The first
prize was awarded to a very fine pair of lyong-tailed Grass-finches"
the second to the Desert Trumpeter Bullfinches which were first
last 5^ear, the third to a ver}&amp;apos; ordinary pair of Parson Finches,
the fourth to a Mexican Siskin, and the fifth to a Red-headed
Finch. It will thus be seen that no less than three of the prize-
winners had no business in the class. There were several
entries of great interest (of species having a right to be in the
class) ; among these I may especially mention an Klegant Bunting

from Japan, and Mr. Swaysland&amp;apos;s three exhibits, Chrysoniitris
tristis (the so-called American Goldfinch, in winter plumage) ;
Chysomitris iotta ; and what he calls the Yellow-headed Sparrow.
The giving of the third prize to a pair of Parson Finches, not in
the very best condition, and a mere V.H.C- to the American
Goldfinch, which was in perfecft feather, is the worst piece of
judging that has been seen at the Palace for some years. Judges
are human, and like other people they will make mistakes, so
that I am not disposed to be severe upon a judge for trifling
errors such as awarding a prize to a bird which has lost a claw,
or to two of the same sex of a species in which the sexes are
almost alike -- but putting a pair of Parson Finches (worth about
lo/-) over the heads of a Mexican Siskin, a Citril Finch, and an
American Goldfinch (not to mention other birds in the class of
almost equal interest) was an error of a different kind, and shews
the judge to be wanting in the judicial faculty.
And in the Class for &amp;quot; Any species of Tanager or Bulbul &amp;quot;
the judging was nearly as bad. First, a splendid Blue-winged
Green Bulbul, very properly first so far as condition goes -- but
how about rarity ? Second, a Malabar Green Bulbul, young,
and not quite in full plumage -- the next exhibit was an adult
specimen of the same species, in better condition, but this got
only a V.H.C. Third, a magnificent Superb Tanager -- a lovel)^
specimen, but it ought not to have been put over the heads of
the remaining prize-winners. Fourth, a hen Greenish Tanager.
Fifth, a Blue and Black Tanager. The class also contained a
most interesting pair of Black-crested Yellow Bulbuls, not in the
best condition perhaps, but unique on the Show bench ; a nice
White-eared Bulbul ; a Red-eared Bulbul, apparently a hen, and
scarcely deserving the card awarded to it ; a good pair of Violet
Tanagers ; several Scarlet and Superb Tanagers ; and two or three
rare Tanagers which I will not expose my ignorance of by
discussing. All the birds of any interest in this class belonged
either to Mr. Humphrys or to Mr. Maxwell.
&amp;quot;Any species of Crow, Ja}^, Magpie, Starling, or Mynah.&amp;quot;
First, Occipital Blue Pie; second, L,ong-tailed Glossy Starling;
third, Andaman Starling; fourth. Blue-hooded Jay; fifth, Mala-
bar Starling. The class also contained a Black-throated
Grackle, which was first last 5^ear, a pair of Black-crested
Mynahs, a Pileated Jay, and several birds of less attradlive
species. The awarding of the second prize in such a class
to a rather poor I,ong-tailed Glossy Starling would be difficult
to defend.

<bodyText confidence="0.976572651162791" page_id="32635526"  page_num="89" year="" vol="">
The Class for A.O.V. Small Insecftivorous contained only-
five entries -- a pair of Grey-backed Zosterops, a single bird of
the same species, two pairs of Pekin Robins, and a rare little
Sugar-bird which its owner rather oddh&amp;quot; calls a Blue-headed
Warbler. There would seem to be no difficult}^ here, the Sugar-
bird being in the most perfedt condition and undoubtedl)^ rare
-- but no, with almost incredible wrong-headedness, the judge
gives the only prize to the pair of Zosterops.
The large Insectivorous Class was well filled. First, Great
Racquet-tailed Drongo ; extra first. Toco Toucan. Second, a
pair of Australian Pittas ; extra second, Sio&amp;apos;nus ideronohcs. (a)
Third, Green-crested Touracou ; extra third, Tui or Parson Bird.
There were also -- a specimen of Cassidix oryzivora ; two Mocking
Birds ; several Toucans of different species ; an Indian Barbet ; a
Laughing Jackass ; another Parson Bird ; quite a number of
Shanias, oddl}^ enough nearly all hens : and last but not least Mr.
Fulljames&amp;apos; La Plata Cuckoos which struck me as the strangest
and most noteworthy, though by no means the most taking, of
the birds in this class. The very fine Tui which received an
\0x25A0extra third should, in ni}&amp;apos;^ opinion, have been higher up.
The Limit Class contained some very charming birds,
such as one does not expedl to find in a selling class. One little
bird, exhibited by Mrs. Frostick, struck me as specially rare and
curious -- I understand that it came from the west coast of Africa.
I have felt bound to express mj^self somewhat stronglj&amp;apos;&amp;apos;
about the judging, as it was, in my opinion, on the whole very
bad -- much worse than it \0x25A0 has been in any year since 1894. It
may perhaps be urged in defence that the judge put condition
TDcfore raritj^ and that he was right in so doing. But even if
this were admitted there would still remain the numerous cases
in which the judge preferred common birds to rarer ones in
equally good condition. The fact is that no birds, whether foreign
birds or not, can be judged for condition onh*, for the simple
reason that in a large class at a good Show there are sure to be
several entries which are in pradticall)^ perfedt condition, and
between which there is nothing to choose on the score of con-
dition only. In classes of mixed species it is impossible to give
points for size, shape, or markings, and therefore rarity becomes
a most important element. Of two birds in equally good
condition there can be no question that the rarer should win --
to what extent rarity should be allowed to compensate for slight
defedts is a more difficult point upon which I need not enter.
(a) The more correct name for this species is Cassicus persicus (Thejapim Hang-nest).-- A.G.B.

Considering Mr. Abrahams&amp;apos; thorough knowledge and
unequalled experience it is strange that his judging should not
have been a greater success -- it seems to shew that, besides
knowledge and experience, an indefinable &amp;quot;judicial instinct&amp;quot; is
required to make a good judge.

I will preface these notes with the remark that I do not
write as a real authority on Parrots. It had been hoped that Mr.
Button would be present at the show, and would criticize the
Parrot Classes ; he was prevented from coming, and I only
undertook to supply these notes that our Secretary might be
relieved from embarrassment in the matter.
To myself, and I should think to many more, these classes
were a veritable treat -- two of them at least were super-excellent,
and the majority very good ; there were some failures, which
may suggest different classification for next year.
In the class for &amp;quot; Lovebirds or Pigmy Parrots &amp;quot; the
entries were ten in number. The first prize went to a lovely
pair of Blue-crowned Hanging Parrots belonging to Mr.
C. T. Maxwell ; oddly enough, though I watched them on two
days, I never saw them hanging. Second went to Mr. Storey&amp;apos;s
large and handsome pair of Peach-faced Lovebirds; and. third
to Mr. H. B. Smith&amp;apos;s single Ceylonese Hanging Parrot with
golden crown (Loriculus indicus, I believe) ; why no notice
should have been taken by the judge of Mr. Fulljames&amp;apos; beautiful
pair of this same species, I could not understand. Fourth prize
was awarded to a pair of Peach-faced Lovebirds (Mr. Fulljames&amp;apos;)&amp;apos;
in singularly good condition. Fourteen pairs of Budgerigars
were entered. Mr. Arthur&amp;apos;s first-prize pair were unusually large
and in beautiful condition ; Mr. Cushny&amp;apos;s second verj^ good ; Mr.
Maxwell&amp;apos;s third prize pair were Yellow. I cannot pretend to-
admire this strange variation of colour.
The Class for Rosellas was a failure, the entries being only
three. The reason for this may probably be a good one, viz.,
that Rosellas are more and more kept in aviaries, whence their
owners do not care to catch them up. Could they not be classed
with Pennants or other Platycerci ? The first prize was with-
held ; second went to Mr. C. Martin&amp;apos;s fine Mealy ; third to Mr.

Housden&amp;apos;s Red-headed pair, not in strikingl}^ good trim. Mr.
Jeffrey&amp;apos;s V. H. C. pair were superb Red - heads, large, and in
beautiful condition, but they looked somewhat like two cocks;
if so they should not have been V.H.C. ! (a)
King or Crimson Wings brought eleven entries, nearly all
in nice condition. First was Mr. Fulljames&amp;apos; very fine King;
second, his lovely Crimson-wing ; third, Mr. H. B. Smith&amp;apos;s King;
I admired, too, the same exhibitor&amp;apos;s (V.H.C.) Crimson-wing.
&amp;quot; Ring-necked or Indian&amp;quot; were not a very varied or interest-
ing collection. First went ,to Mrs. Henderson&amp;apos;s grand pair of
Alexandrine; Mr. H. B. Smith took second with a pair of Rosas,
not in striking bloom ; Mr. Railton&amp;apos;s Alexandrine, described as
&amp;apos;a grand talker,&amp;apos; secured third prize. Mr. Button showed a
5^oung Malabar, but not for competition. Mr. Maxwell&amp;apos;s Long-
tailed Malaccan was in good condition ; the species seems
nowadaj&amp;apos;s rare.
&amp;quot; lyOries or Lorikeets &amp;quot; was labelled by the judge &amp;apos;a very
good class.&amp;apos; About this there can be no doubt -- the rarer
Lorikeets were especially beautiful and most of them in lovely
condition. First was awarded to Mr. A. Green&amp;apos;s Ceram Lory -- a
happy-looking bird, lively and in perfect plumage ; its catalogue
price -- #2 6s. 6d. -- was tempting, but Lories are not long lived.
Mrs. Frostick won second with a very sweet pair of Musky
Lorikeets ; Mr. Maxwell third with a pair of Scaly-breasted
Lorikeets, in excellent condition, and extra third with a single
Ornate Lorikeet. There were also good specimens of Swainson&amp;apos;s
and Forsten&amp;apos;s Lorikeets in the class.
The class for &amp;quot; Any other species of Parrakeets (single)&amp;quot;
was a decidedl)^ interesting one, with fourteen entries. First
went deservedly to Captain Tutton&amp;apos;s somewhat rare Fiji Parrakeet
{Pyrrhulopsis tabiiensis), very tame and in lovely condition.
The figure of this Parrakeet is somewhat like that of the King
Parrot. The head, breast and underparts are maroon, shading
downwards into crimson ; a brilliant blue patch at the back of
the neck, flights and tail blue, and the rest of the bodj^ green.
Mrs. Astrop took second with her beautiful Pileated Parrakeet,
which has before won at the Palace. Third, fourth, and fifth all
went to Mr. Fulljames : for a Barraband cock in good trim, a
cock Blue Bonnet, and a good Many-coloured. A Red-mantled
{Platycercus erythropcplus), shown by Mr. Cocksedge, did not
obtain any notice. Pairs of &amp;quot; Any other species of Parrakeets &amp;quot;

brought only six entries. Mr. Hoiisden&amp;apos;s glorious pair of
Pennant&amp;apos;s, in a large cage, gained first ; no second was awarded ;
Mr. Setli Smith took third with a fine pair of Barraband&amp;apos;s in
perfect trim, and interesting because hens of this species are
rarely seen. I admired the brilliant heads of Mr. H. B. Smith&amp;apos;s
V. H. C. Red-masked Conures {Comirus ricbrolarvatus). Mr.
Maxwell&amp;apos;s H.C. pair of Paradise Parrakeets are still in 3&amp;apos;outhful
plumage, (jx)
Grey Parrots were six in number. Mrs. Peacock&amp;apos;s winner
was in loveh^ trim, and looked to advantage in a splendid cage ;
no second prize was awarded, but the third went to apparently
an excellent talker, shown by Miss Hatwell. The class for
Amazons brought eleven entries. Mr. Hudson won first with a
nice-looking Yellow-fronted ; Mr. H. B. Smith second with a
fine Mealy, and the L,ondon Fanciers&amp;apos; Association third with
a Levaillant&amp;apos;s. I think a pretty little Amazon shown by Mr.
Maxwell (V. H.C.) was a &amp;apos;Spectacled&amp;apos; Amazon not quite in full
plumage -- a treacherous little fellow, which, after much show
of affedlion, bit me !
In the Class for Ecledlus Parrots the entries were,
unfortunately, only four, and the first prize was withheld.
Second, a small all-green male, said to be &amp;quot; Westerman&amp;apos;s
Eclectus &amp;quot; : in size, it seemed to me more to resemble the
nearly-allied Eckchis riedeli. Mr. C. Martin is its exhibitor.
Third went to Mr. Maxwell&amp;apos;s fine Red-sided cock.
&amp;quot;Any other variety Parrots&amp;quot; were eight. Mr. Maxwell
took first with a good specimen of the Hawk-headed Parrot ;
Mr. Fulljames second and third with, respectively, a Bronze-
wing and a Meyer&amp;apos;s. He also obtained a V.H.C. for his Kea --
the well-known Parrot of New Zealand, interesting to naturalists
from its having acquired carnivorous habits since the country
was stocked with sheep.
Macaws were only five. First, Mr. Fulljames&amp;apos; magnificent
Hyacinthine ; and third, Mr. Maxwell&amp;apos;s Blue and Yellow, in
singularly lovely condition. Mr. Fulljames only got a V.H.C. for
his rare Spix, probably on account of its poor condition.
&amp;quot;Cockatoos -- Lemon -crested, White -crested, or Rose-
breasted,&amp;quot; were also few. Unfortunateh^, Mr. Housdeu&amp;apos;s fine
[a) I took these birds to be in adult plumage, and to be two female Golden-
shouldered Parrakeets, Psephotus chrysopterygius ; the misleading- brownish cap seems
not to be unusual in the adult female of this species. They should have been disquali-
fied. It is to be regretted that the Zoological Societj&amp;apos; should call this bird the Paradise
Parrakeet, a name which has so long been associated in our minds with P. ptilcherrinius.
I think I am correct in saying that it was Gould who called it the Golden-shouldered
Parrakeet ; and I fail to see any reason wliy the name should be superseded.-- R. P.

pair of Slender- bills, so often winners at the Palace, were
apparently entered in error in this class. The first prize was not
awarded ; second went to Mr. Housden&amp;apos;s large Sulphur-crest,
and third to the lyondon Fanciens&amp;apos; Association for a Rose-breast.
The Class for &amp;quot; Any other variety of Cockatoo &amp;quot; was
much better filled -- lo entries. Mr. Fulljames took first for a
pair of Gangas, claimed at the catalogue price of ;^2o. They
were by no means in full plumage. Second went to Mr. Martin&amp;apos;s
cock Leadbeater, a very fair specimen ; and third to Mr.
Maxwell&amp;apos;s Ganga : a pair was entered, but only one was in the
cage. It is curious that after some interval there seem lately to
have been several importations of this species.
The cheap class contained some good specimens and
pairs of well-known species, but, as might be expected, nothing
very rare.
CORRESPONDENCE.
PARROT NOTES.
Sir,-- I have thought that a few notes, disjointed as they will
necessarily be, in reply to various items in the Magazine for December,
may be of interest.
Firstly, with regard to the Hon. and Rev. F. G. Button&amp;apos;s ideal of a
Parrot pet, I fear his qualifications will never be realized in an individual bird.
In respect of size, of course the only Parrots which would comply with the
first of Mr. Button&amp;apos;s conditions would be the Pigmy Parrots. Of these I
have two species -- the Blue-crowned Hanging Parrot {Loriculus galgidus)z.\\^
the Golden-crowned Hanging Parrot {Lorkulus asiaticns). (a) Both species
are very beautiful, and the latter I believe to be exceedingly rare, although
I myself have five specimens. Both sorts are niess}-, stupid {b), and do not
talk. They do not scream, but they are certainly not tame. They hano- in
clusters from the top of a &amp;quot;waggon &amp;quot; cage, and the wall on which the cage
is hung shows disagreeable evidence of their presence, (c)
My own pet, among a collection of more than forty Parrots of
different species, is the Bronze-winged Parrot [Piomis chalcopteru.s). It will
scarcely be true to say that it does not scream, but its &amp;quot; scream &amp;quot; is a very
tiny one, and not at all offensive. Neither does it talk -- (I am writing only
of my own bird, as it is not easy to speak generally of birds so rare as the
Bronze-winged Parrot). In tameness it is far and away the pink of the
collection. It positivel}- loves to be &amp;quot; made a fuss of,&amp;quot; and when I have it

constitute the subfamily Nasiier?tin&amp;lt;B, and are, I believe, practically unknown as ca&amp;quot;e-

on my hand, in the presence of a visitor to whom I am showing the
peculiarly beautiful colours of the underwing, which are hidden when the
bird is at rest, the Parrot utters only the feeblest protest against the liberty
I am taking, never dreaming of activeh&amp;quot; resenting it.
Mr. Button asks if anyone can aver with truth that they have a
Cockatoo which never screams. In ni)&amp;apos; collection there are two of which I
can so speak. The Blood-stained Cockatoo [Cacatua sa?iguinea) has never
uttered a sound during the twelve months or so that it has been with me,
while the Black Cockatoo [Micfogiossus ateriimis) is equally innocent of the
fault of screaming, although he is fond of calling out something which
sounds like &amp;quot; Papa,&amp;quot; and accompanies his effort with a ludicrous attempt at
laughing. My bird is very tame, but a sad feather-eater, and every possible
remedy has been tried in vain. We have sprayed him daily with a liquid
specially prepared to make his feathers distasteful to him, but with only
partial success. Even his tail and wing-feathers, which he knows wovild
&amp;quot;be painful of extraction, are not safe, for these he takes b}^ the extreniitj-,
and strips of their &amp;quot;web,&amp;quot; leaving only the quills. I am faintly hopeful of
curing him by giving him only small seeds to eat, and plenty of soft wood
to make toothpicks of, and if my treatment succeeds I trust to be able,
some time hence, to show him in reasonable condition.
I have never kept the Great Green Macaw mentioned by Mr. Button,
although I have seen it ; but the trick of blushing, spoken of by Mr. Button
as appertaining to this bird, is shared to a remarkable extent by the Black
Cockatoo. In repose its cheeks are about the colour of the back of one&amp;apos;s
hand, but when excited, either with pleasure or anger, they are flushed
with a rosy fed. He very much enjoj&amp;apos;s being taken out of his cage,
although his formidable beak prevents visitors attempting liberties.
Mr. Button&amp;apos;s query, as to whether either of our members have kept a
Spix Macaw, is answered by Mr. Fillmer&amp;apos;s mention of wxy bird in his report
o\\ the foreign birds at the late Royal Aquarium Show. My bird is one of
the best-tempered birds in the collection. He delights in being taken in
one&amp;apos;s hand, and there he will, with very great enjoyment, flap his peculiarly
short wings as though he meant to fly to the moon. Upside down or right
side up is all the same to him. He says a few words, and could easily be
taught to become a good talker if he were not mixed up with a large
number of Parrots, each of which has his own idea of harmony.
I cannot quite endorse Mr. Button&amp;apos;s statement that Hyacinthiue
Macaws have no individuality. My Hyacinthine is devoted to my house-
keeper, and endures me, while he is spiteful to a degree to strangers. I
suspect that the latter is due to the fact that strangers are mistrustful of
his wonderful beak, and he knows it. With regard to &amp;quot; making a row,&amp;quot;
Mr. Button should hear the daily duet which takes up an hour each
morning between my H3-acinthine and the Spix, and he would wish he
hadn&amp;apos;t. For the rest of the day, both birds are quiet; and I think if they
were beyond each other&amp;apos;s hearing neither would be objectionable, {a)
I quite agree with Mr. Fillmer that the hen Violet Tanager is seldom
[a\ We have been oblig-ed reluctantly to omit that part of Mr. Fulljanies&amp;apos; letter which
continued the discussion of the L. and P. O. Society&amp;apos;s Show -- as we consider that sufficient
space has already been devoted to that subject. We have received other communications
upon the same subject which we have refrained from printing, for the same reason. -- Kd.

are now represented in my collection by three survivors, all of which are
cocks. I have never had a hen in my possession.

DEAIvERS&amp;apos; NAMES FOR BIRDS.
I agree with the writers of the letters which have appeared under the
above heading in thinking that a glossary of English names of foreign
&amp;quot;birds would be useful -- I doubt, however, whether it would be expedient for
the Societ}&amp;apos; to undertake the preparation of such a work at present. I
think that if the Society were to publish a glossary, it would be necessary
for us to fix upon one English name for each species commonly imported,
which should in future be treated by lis as the accepted name. The
recognition of an accepted English name for every species would be a great
convenience, but the selection of the name would, in many cases, be a very
difiicult and delicate matter, and might possibly cause much dissatisfaction.
Further, it is worth serious consideration whether the preparation of
a glossary of dealers&amp;apos; names would not tend to the perpetuation of some
names which would be better forgotten, and give a fictitious importance to
names scarcely known bej&amp;apos;ond the circle of the customers of the dealer
who invented them.
With regard to scientific names, it has long been an unwritten law
of the Society that only those names adopted in the British Museum
Catalogue of Birds should be used in the Magazine. This rule has, however,
frequently been broken, and there are reasons which make it sometimes
difficult to enforce it in practice. I believe it to be the wish of all those
engaged in editing the Magazine that it should be more strictly enforced in
future.
Personally, I should like, as far as possible, to see the adoption of a
uniform S5&amp;apos;stem of English names in our Magazine, and I believe that this
may in time be gradually bi-ought about. If this were achieved, the
adoption by the Society of a list of accepted English names would be easy --
at present, I fear it would be hazardous and difficult.

WINTERING FOREIGN BIRDS IN OUTDOOR AVIARIES.
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.995458461538462" page_id="32635532"  page_num="95" year="" vol="">
Sir, -- In commenting on Mr. Phillipps&amp;apos; letter in last issue re winter-
ing foreign birds out of doors (for, as I read it, it is of general application,
and he only mentions Green Avadavats as an instance) I would not pit my
small array of facts against his, for I am comparatively young in aviculture,
but my experience is quite the contrary to his, and leads me to believe that
many birds which will appear puffed and unhappy in an unheated indoor
aviary {a) will, in a garden aviary, open to the atmosphere (of course
screened on the North and East) charm their owners (in the winter) with
their cheerfulness, vivacity, and song.
{a) Mr. Phillipps did not suggest that foreign birds should be wintered in &amp;quot; an
unheated indoor aviary,&amp;quot; -- his words are &amp;quot; a moderately warm room.&amp;quot; It is well-known
that birds kept in the open air will stand much more severe cold than those indoors, and
that indoor aviaries should always be heated in winter. -- Uc

Under such conditions I have kept African Weavers, Green Singingr
Ribbon and Zebra Finches, Indian Avadavats and Mannikins, and Java
Sparrows in my garden aviary here in London, constructed similarly to an
ordinary fowl-run and shed. They have exhibited the demeanour afore-
mentioned, and by it have left no doubt as to their happiness and well-being
-- this is actual experience, not belief-- t\\e. bath is never absent, and they bathe
freely in the most inclement weather.
As already stated in the Magazine, I had a young Java Sparrow fly on
November 6tli last, and it is now in the pink of condition, still, of course,
in its nest feathers. I have only had two deaths in two years, and these
occurred in late summer (one Weaver stuck in the moult and one Java
Sparrow in a fit). It seems to me, that these facts speak for themselves,
and I fail to see any cruelty in the practice when the birds, by their
demeanour and song, most certainly say otherwise, [a)
As to Green Avadavats, the Rev. C. D. Farrar has wintered them out
of doors, and what is more, bred from them early the following season. I
am of the belief that most of the Grass-finches could be so wintered with
advantage to themselves, but this I have not yet tried.
We;si,e;y T. Page.
Sir, -- It is naturally with great hesitation that I venture to differ
from so experienced an aviculturist as Mr. Phillipps.
If experiments to test the hardiness of birds were certainly fore-
doomed to failure (and even success of no great iiuportance) they might
well be considered cruel ; but is the failure such a certainty ? Considering
the number of birds native to warm climates that are now kept with perfect
success in open air aviaries throughout the year, it is not unreasonable to
suppose that there are others that would thrive under the same treatment,
and it seems to me that to add to the list would be an important service to
aviculture. In making experiments to this end I am afraid it is inevitable
that there should be victims, but each of these will teach a useful lesson
which will justify the apparent cruelty.
A large out-of-door aviary is more within the means of most people
than one of similar extent under cover and warmed ; birds that do not
mind the exposure will surely pass thus a happier existence than confined
in cages or small aviaries in a warm bird-room.
Mr. Phillipps&amp;apos; description of birds in cold weather certainly does not
apply to my Green Avadavats. I have particular!}- noticed them on the
few days of sharp frost we have had this winter and have always found
them as lively, spruce and active as on a bright summer day.
As regards separating the sexes, I advise this, not because the females
mind the cold, but because some birds will not learn that our winter is not
the suitable season for breeding, and the females, in consequence, get egg-
bound. However, most of the species I keep out make no attempt to breed
during the winter, and of these there is no necessity to separate the sexes.
(a) Mr. Page might have mentioned many more svich facts -- I could mention many
more myself-- but I remain unconverted. There is another side to the picture, of which
I have too often beesi an unhappy spectator. -- K. P.

I liave so far experimented with Virginian, Red-crested and Green
Cardinals, Red-lieaded, Japanese, Nonpareil and Indigo Buntings, Sycalis
arvensis, Desert Trumpeter Bullfinch, Cherr}^ Finch, Chestnut Finch,
Diamond Sparrow, Black-headed Nun, Parson Finch, Zebra Finch, Green
Avadavat. Of man}&amp;apos;- of these I have had specimens out for three winters,
and cannot see an}&amp;apos; loss of vitality in them ; of those I have lost, I have not
been able to attribute the death to cold in anj^ one case, but a Diuca Finch
I certainly lost owing to exposure. I judge from ]\Ir. Farrar&amp;apos;s notes in the
Magazine that he has kept out many other species, and his experience on
the subject would be interesting.
Time onlv will show whether the lives of my birds are shortened
by exposure. In this conne6lion it would be interesting to have fuller
statistics than we at present possess of the length of time during which
the smaller Finches are generally kept in a warm bird-room.

FOOD FOR SOFT-BIDDED BIRDS.

Sir, -- I see Mr. Marshall was somewhat surprised at a Blackbird
being kept on cheese.
In this part of the world, we feed Blackbirds and Thrushes on barley
meal made crumbly with water. The}&amp;apos; may have an occasional snail, but
not regular!}&amp;apos;. On this they thrive and live long. I can answer for it,
because I have kept them in this wav.
F. G. DurroN.
Sir, -- As A&amp;apos;ou invite further correspondence on the subject of Food
for Soft-billed Birds, I send you my experience in the matter. I feed my
birds on a mixture I make myself, but which I cannot give the receipt for,
as I am thinking of making it for sale. I shall be glad, however, to send a
limited number of members samples of it on application. In addition to
the above mixture, I give raw meat prepared as follows : The meat (mutton
for choice) is first scraped or chopped fine ; it is then well saturated with
water, which is then well squeezed out in the hand. The meat can then be
placed in mouthfnls between the bars of the cage or in a pan. I Ijelieve
this washing of the meat to be the secret of success in feeding on meat,
and that it agrees better with birds than when unwashed. Washing the
meat before chopping it Avould not have the same effect. I suppose the
juices in ii;:washed meat are too stimulating. Meat prepared as above may
be given ad libitum with the greatest benefit. Another advantage gained by
the washing is the removal of the stickiness of unwashed meat, which
causes too large a quantity to be taken by a bird and wasted about the cage.
When raw meat is not at hand I give cooked meat ; but I do not consider it
as good as raw, nor do the birds care for it as much. I also think some
insect food every day is desirable, but not necessary.
On the above treatment I have kept birds si;ch as ShSmas, in perfect
health and song; also, while in India, an English Nightingale, in perfect
health and song for about five years, and probably should have kept him
longer if I had not taken him with me to an altitude of about 6,000 feet
when he was moulting, and the sudden change from heat to cold was
evidentl}&amp;apos; too much for him.

In the December number of our Magazine, Mr. Button questions
wlietlier in confinement the natural food is best, on the strength of the fact
that honey has been found injurious to birds which eat it in a wild state ;
but ma}&amp;apos; not this be explained b}- the fact that honey or nectar, as extracted
from flowers, is a different substance from honey as stored by the bees ? My
bee book, speaking of the working bee, says &amp;quot;It has a honey-sack in which
the nectar from the flowers is collected, and transformed by a chemical
action into honej-.&amp;quot;
Green Bulbuls I have found do well on my mixture, bread and milk,
and soft fruit.
I have not found it necessary to feed my birds at night in the winter,
as recommended by Mr. Bonhote. My idea is that while birds are asleep
there is no waste of tissue, and therefore no demand for food. I doubt if
Miss Hopwood&amp;apos;s plan, of making her birds eat green food, is a good one.
I find that insectivorous birds do not, as a rule, care for green food. If it is
good for them, I don&amp;apos;t think they ought to require forcing to take it.
C. Harrison.
Sir, -- It seems more convenient to discuss Dr. Butler&amp;apos;s letter on
&amp;quot; Bread for Soft-billed Birds &amp;quot; iinder this heading, as it deals with a branch
of the same subject.
Aviculture is not an exact science, and aviculturists always have
differed, and probably always will differ, in opinion as to the best foods for
various kinds of birds ; still, there is such a thing as what may be called
the traditional or orthodox doctrine on the subject, and I think everyone
will agree that the feeding of British Warblers on food containing bread-
crumbs is not in accordance with orthodox avicultural teaching, (a) It seems
to me, therefore, that Dr.Butler can scarce!}&amp;apos; complain of Mr. FuUjames&amp;apos;state-
nient to the effect that the more delicate insectivorous birds cannot digest
bread, as that statement is in no way original, and is but an echo of what
we have always been taught by those who have hitherto been supposed to
know most about the subject. The statement itself may be true or may be
false, but it is so well siipported by authority that no one need be astonished
at its being made, and the onus of proof is on those who controvert it.
There appears to me to be an inherent difficulty in believing that
bread is good for insectivoroi:s birds. The ability to digest farinaceous food
depends upon the power to convert starch into dextrine; and we are told
that young infants, whose natural food is milk, do not possess this power.
The natural food of insectivorous birds is insects, and as the power to
convert starch into dextrine would be useless to them in a state of nature it
seems scarcely likely that they possess it. The advantage of biscuit over
bread is that in biscuit a larger proportion of the starch has been already
converted into dextrine in the process of baking.
The fact that insectivorous birds will devour considerable quantities
of bread without injury to themselves proves little or nothing. Our grand-
fathers and grandmothers were largely fed, in infancy, on pap, and were
(a) What is orthodox avicultural teaching ? Orthodoxy teaches that some fruit-
eaters shall be fed on raw meat. To each man orthodoxy is his own doxy.-- A. G. B.

apparantly none the worse for it -- yet no one would nowadays recouunend
such a diet for babies.
Birds like the Blackcap and the Garden Warbler, both of which feed
larojel}- on berries and fruit, would be much more likely to digest bread
than birds which live entirely on insects; and the same applies to a smaller
extent to the Nightingale, Avhich is also in some degree an eater of berries.
The Liothrix. the Blackbird, and the Jays will, as is well known, live on
anj&amp;apos;thing -- the Nuthatch is almost equally omnivorous, while the Tanagers
are mainly fruit-eaters. Therefore scarcely any of the birds mentioned by Dr.
Butler come within the meaning of the expression used by Mr. Fulljames --
&amp;quot; the most delicate of the insectivorous birds.&amp;quot;
Septimus Perkins.
Sir, -- I have been asked to reply to Dr. Butler&amp;apos;s criticism upon my
letter in the Aviciiltmal Magazine for Januar}^
My statement that Nightingales could not digest breadcrumbs was
based upon the fact that, during an experience of nine or ten 5-ears, the
Nightingale which I now have, and which is singing from dajdight tintil
the gas is turned out at night, is the on!}- one I have ever been able to keep
through the autumn.
About ten years ago I began with two Nightingales, and fed them on
a mixture somewhat resembling that mentioned b}&amp;apos; Dr. Butler in &amp;quot; British
Birds, their Nests and Eggs.&amp;quot; Both died just as I was expecting them to
come into song. I have had never less than one Nightingale each season since
then, but they have all died before Christmas in each 3-ear. I sent the last
two bodies iov post-inortem, and the report was that the birds had died from
some disease (with a I^atin name reaching across the page), induced in the
first stages by indigestion, consequent upon the birds having been supplied
with food which contained breadcrumbs and peameal.
My existing bird has had, since he has been with me, which is since
the Cr3&amp;apos;stal Palace Show of 1897, nothing but ants&amp;apos;-cocoons and insects, and
his condition at the recent Show of 1898 was, I think, sufficient justification
of the treatment. He was singing in his cage during the vShow, and held,
at times, quite a levee.
Dr. Butler&amp;apos;s referring me to &amp;quot; British Birds, their Nests and Eggs&amp;quot; was
scarcely a happy thought on his part, for I thereby gather that of the five
birds he took from the nest in 1S87 three died in about two xnonths, and the
fourth and fifth within eighteen months, and he does not mention having
tried to keep a Nightingale since. Might I suggest that the presumed
&amp;quot; sunstrokes &amp;quot; were Ji(s consequent upon injudicious feeding ? Anywa)&amp;apos;, a
Nightingale will have nothing but strictly insectivorous food with me.
Henrv J. FUIXJAMES.
In connection with the alleged injurious effects of honey on captive
birds, it is worth mentioning that I have been informed that Mr. Richard,
a member of our Societ}% has kept two specimens of the Yellow-winged
Sugar Bird {Ccereha cyanea) for some 5&amp;apos;ears, in perfect health and plumage,
and that these birds have been largely fed on honey -- a section of honey in
the comb being almost always in their cage.

Sir, -- From a former member of our Society I obtained a pair of
Orange-clieeked Waxbills on tlie 8th of November, 1889. The cock died on
the 17th January, this year, and the hen on the 21st of February, their ages
averaging S^ j-ears.
I wrote to the lady from whom I purchased them to inquire whether
she could tell me how long they had been in her possession, but un-
fortunately she had kept no record. I presume they must have died of
old age, for the person who dissected them could not detect any disease in
them.
The wonder to me is that these frail little creatures live so long in
confinement. This last survivor was put on the scales, and weighed exactly
a quarter of an ounce !
W. T. CaTi^uuGH,
ZWARTE KIVISPAAL.
Sir, -- It seems hardl}^ seemly that so curious and little knov/n a bird
as Mr. Russell Humphr3?s&amp;apos; Cassidix oryzivora should be passed over by our
vSociety without comment, even the owner&amp;apos;s note in the Show catalogue
that it is &amp;quot; absolutely unique,&amp;quot; failing to get a rise out of any of our critics.
In the catalogue it is called Cassidix oryzivoid ; and the* error has been
reproduced b}&amp;apos; the different papers with the docility and complacency of
sheep playing at Follov/-my-L,eader over a precipice. I came across an
adult male in Holland last summer, where it was known as the Zwarte
Kivispaal. It was much the same colour as the adult male Satin Bower-
bird, but the head and neck were of a lighter and much more brilliant
violet, and the bill and feet were black. Only too conscious of its beauty
and of the oddity of its ruff, the conceited creature was blowing out its
neck and crop, showing off to perfection the marvellous reflections of the
plumage, and the curious long and enlarged feathers at the back. The
bird seemed to have a peculiarly small and snake-like head, -- but this maj&amp;apos;
have been more apparent than real, owing to the exaggerated size of the
neck. It was an irresistibly comic and absurd looking bundle of vanities,
and would have been the Bird of the Show had it appeared at the Palace.
I could not exactly make out Mr. Huniphrys&amp;apos; unsteady exhibit in its
dark cage, and should not have recognised it as a Zwarte Kivispaal (will
somebody kindly oblige with the English name ?) had it not been for the
entry in the catalogue. It seemed not to be wholly black, nor to have the
elongated neck feathers or the violet reflections, and the size of the head
was ordinar}&amp;apos;. The female is said to want the neck decorations -- but this
bird seemed rather large for a female ; so it may have been an immature
male; and the ill-defined white line which I think I saw over the eyes may
have been a mark of immaturity, or one of the variations of plumage
characteristic of the species. It comes from Central and South America.

All hobbies, to be really interesting, should add something
to the sum of general knowledge ; in other words, should make
some new facts known to mankind.
It has been forced upon me lately, by the questions put to-
me b}^ scientific workers in other branches of Zoological study,
that aviculturists are doing far less than they might do towards
helping their brethren the cabinet-ornithologists. As a class
they seem to think that if they have succeeded in breeding a
bird not previously reared in captivity in this country, they have
done all that mankind is entitled to expect at their hands.
When a man has been fortunate enough to succeed up to
this point, the cabinet-naturalist has a right to expect far more
from him ; for if he merely records the bare fact, he has indeed
been fortunate (and men will doubtless praise him who does
good to himself), but he has nevertheless fallen short of that
which he ought to have done, and has neglected a golden
opportunity of imparting knowledge.
To know a bird thoroughly, it must be studied in both
sexes and at all ages ; and this, alas, (in spite of the indefatigable
zeal of such men as Dr. Russ) has been done in very few of the
numerous species which exist on the earth&amp;apos;s surface ; and not in
anything like all of even the commonly imported species.
The aviculturist has it in his power to correct the errors
which even careful travellers and cabinet-naturalists have, from
time to time, undoubtedly made -- respecting the young plumage,,
or the sexual plumage, the seasonal changes, and the senile
plumage, of various species : he has his birds before him from
year&amp;apos;s end to year&amp;apos;s end ; he is interested in their habits, in their
dances, songs, courtships, nest-buildings, and method of feeding
their young ; he tells us about these things, all of which give us
</bodyText>
<bodyText confidence="0.99932611627907" page_id="32635539"  page_num="102" year="" vol="">
pleasure to read about, and perhaps enable some of us to follow
in his footsteps ; yet, more often than not, the recital of these
items adds little or nothing to the sum of fadts already recorded
in Kuropean works.
On the other hand, every new item made known to the
world is a distinct gain to mankind : in that it assists in the
great scheme of education, in which, whether we recognize it or
not, we are all interested.
The first duty of the breeder is to describe the nest, the
eggs, the time of incubation, and the nesting plumage of every
species reared by him ; provided that it has not alread}^ been
thoroughly done by some previous breeder ; then the date at
which the young leave their nest should be noted, in order to
decide how long this infant plumage is retained ; and the change
to the adult plumage should be carefully studied.
I know that one objection will at once be raised to this ;
an objection which never daunted Dr. Russ, and which is based
upon an error of observation. It will&amp;apos; be said that it is impossible
to examine a nest without causing the parents to desert their
eggs and young. I can only say that I have lifted down boxes
containing nests and eggs of Java Sparrows, Saffron-finches,
Zebra-finches and others ; have even pulled out the linings and
replaced them by cleaner ones, restoring young or eggs after
the process, and hanging up the boxes again. I have done this
not once but dozens of times, and do not remember ever to have
lost a brood thereby.
Some birds, such as Blue Robins, get excited and fly about
wildly whilst you examine their young, but no sooner are 3&amp;apos;&amp;apos;0U
out of the aviary than they return to the nest and are as
assiduous in their attention to their offspring as before. It is not
one deliberate and quiet examination which scares most birds
from their duties, but that idle curiosity which tempts some avi-
culturists to look frequently to see how matters are progressing.
The Zebra-finch above manj^ birds has been credited with
foolish nervousness about its nest : I will therefore put on record
here one out of many instances in which I have meddled with it.
I^ast year I hung up a cocoa-nut shell among other nesting-
receptacles in one of my aviaries ; a pair of Zebra-finches soon
took possession, and having carelessly lined the shell settled
down to rear a family, but only hatched one out of four eggs.
One day I noticed that both birds were absent from the nest, so
climbing on a bank, I looked into the shell but could see nothing
but what seemed to be a little fluff (which I took for lining) at

the back of the shell. I unhooked and turned the shell upside
down into my hand, when out fell a young bird about half grown
and quite lively. I carried both away, pressed some cow-hair
into the back of the cavity, replaced the youngster and hung the
shell up again : in five minutes both parents were back feeding
their baby, which is now an adult bird. That is about as strong
a case as I have met with as regards the Zebra-finch, but I have
*often done the same thing with Java Sparrows.
Many of our members may perhaps think to back out of
their responsibilities, on the ground that they have no aviaries
but only a few small birds in cages. Now I will tell them what
they can do, if they only have a pair of the common Avadavat
in a cage.
It is well known that this commonest of all Indian Wax-
bills is incessantly changing its plumage throughout the year,
but nobody has ever made a careful study of these changes ;
nobody knows whether they are produced by complete or partial
moults, by growth of colour in the feathers themselves, or how
long each phase of colour is permanent. It is certain that at
some time or other there must be a complete moult, perhaps
once, perhaps twice in the year : it is certain that the bird which
at one time is in full breeding-plumage, resembles a hen at
another time ; resembles all kinds of comical mixtures between
male and female plumage sometimes, and at other times does not
remind one of either sex. /V carefully-dated diary describing
the metamorphoses of this common bird would be a boon to
science, and if undertaken by several independent workers
would do much to clear up the mystery which enshrouds this
.little Waxbill.
THE ROLLER AND ITS FOOD.
By Reginai^d Phii^lipps.
I am much pleased to observe that our members have
struggled free from the thraldom of seed-eaters and got so far as
the Warblers, and that Mr. Fulljames has made a still bolder
move to the front by venturing to refer to such an unfashionable
bird as the European Roller. It seems to me to be probable that
other aviculturists besides myself may have a liking for some of
these less known but often highly interesting and attractive
species; and that, possibly, our Magazine would be more widely
read and more highly esteemed if we were a little less narrow-
minded in the choice of our subjects than we sometimes appear

The Roller {Coracias garrulus) is not only interesting as a
bird and taking as a pet (if properly managed), but it is a subject
which our Society ought to take up as a matter of duty. Writers,
ancient and modern, have had much to say about the Roller, but
few of them seem to have understood its true nature ; and, as the
moderns seem to be taking a retrogade step, a little discussion
about the bird will be timely. And amongst all the writings,
ancient and modern, with which I am acquainted, there is but
one that even so much as refers to one of the most interesting
points in the economy of the bird, a point, too, on which the
question of its food partly hinges. Mr. Fulljanies, therefore, in
asking about food for his Roller, touches on an important subject ;;
and to deal with it, principally though not entirely, will be
sufficient for the present paper, {a)
Perhaps it may somewhat clear the air if I commence by
saying that the more I see of the Roller the more do I disagree
with those writers who liken it to our Jay. The Jay is a bold
knave, and wary after the manner of clever knaves, but the
Roller is neither bold nor a knave ; on the contrary, although
not exactly wild, it is exceptionally nervous and timid, and (for
example) will fast for hours rather than go near its food should
any such uncanny object as a dust-broom be lying anywhere
near. It is more or less wary according to the circumstances of
its lot ; in Greece, for instance, I not infrequently came across
the feathers but rarely saw the bird, for the natives seemed tO&amp;apos;
have little to do but to shoot at every member of the feathered
creation they could find, even a rare Sparrow which ventured
to chirp in the outskirts of Athens itself being immediately
catapulted by the ubiquitous urchin. On the other hand, I
understand that in Palestine and Algeria the Roller is a common
and conspicuous object. In some of its ways the Roller is
curiously like to its not very distant connection the I^aughing
Jackass ; and on very rare occasions it gives utterance to a short
but almost perfect Jackass laugh. Some writers endeavour tO&amp;apos;
describe its different notes, but rather feebly, for its language is
varied and expressive, and to my mind distinctly pleasing ;.
nevertheless it is the custom to abuse the voice of the Roller,,
so there is no more to be said.
It is not a robust bird, and should not be exposed to much
cold.
In considering the food of the captive Roller, it must be
borne in mind that it is rather an obstinate bird to get on to food

it has not been accustomed to, and that, too often, it has con-
tracted bad habits before it reaches one&amp;apos;s hands. In the dealer&amp;apos;s
shop, it is usually a half-ruined, raw-meat eating creature,
seldom attractive, sometimes wholly repulsive ; but patience and
gentleness bestowed on the Roller will be amply repaid -- if you
hestow enough.
It is now several years since I received my first Roller.
It was little but a bag-of-bones, a bag, by the way, which sorely
needed mending, for the skin and flesh had been knocked off
the bones by the poor creature&amp;apos;s mad batterings against the wires
of a most unsuitable cage, and the bones in the bag-in-rags were
about all that was left for me to carry home ; and many a long
day passed before I could get the poor creature decently clothed,
but it came to its right mind much sooner than might have been
\0x25A0expected. A year or two ago my notice was attracted by some
letters about British Birds, in which the Roller was more than
once referred to as a suitable species for the Show Bench. I am
strongly of opinion that it is about as unsuitable a species as
could easily be found, for, as I have already said, it is
exceptionall}^ nervous and timid ; and without rhyme or
reason it dashes about anyhow, an3^where, absolutely regardless
of consequences, and of its own and of its owner&amp;apos;s feelings.
This first Roller of mine was a specimen of no small
interest, for it was a fairly natural bird, and very different from
those one usually sees in captivity. In the summer following its
arrival, it was placed in the garden along with Hawks, Crows,
Jays, and Pies, of many kinds and climes ; and it had to be on
the alert if it wanted its dinner. Its favourite portions were
grapes and cockroaches ; and in Greece, by the way, I found the
Roller in the vineyards, in the midst of scores of acres of grapes.
It also ate worms, mealworms, sop, cooked cabbage, etc. I still
have a lively remembrance of this bird, when a plate of scraps
from our midday meal was put out, swooping down and seizing
upon the cabbage, gulping down huge pieces, almost choking
itself in its haste -- but it would take a good deal to choke a
Roller. Many of the older writers were agreed that the Roller
partakes of vegetable food ; probably we cannot materially
improve upon Wood, who says that the food is &amp;quot; almost wholly
of an insect nature, but is diversified with a few berries and
other vegetable productions.&amp;quot; Modern writers, however, will
not allow this, and mostly tell us that the Roller is &amp;quot; purely
insectivorous,&amp;quot; that &amp;quot; There seems to be no evidence that it
[euro]ver eats grain, or in fact any vegetable substances,&amp;quot; and the

like ; but Seebohm could not have known much about the
matter, for he adds : -- &amp;quot; Naumann asserts that caged birds, when
given any vegetable matter to eat, die from its effects ; but this-
requires further confirmation.&amp;quot; How far modern writers have
taken their ideas from one another I will not pause to consider,
but one, whom we all respect, riOw passed away, seems to have
taken his ideas all ready formed to the bird ; and his evidence is
consequently all the more valuable. He is quoted in &amp;quot; British
Birds with their Nests and Eggs &amp;quot; as follows : -- &amp;quot; We once
discovered some remains of figs in the stomach of a bird of this
species, but imagine that the}^ were swallowed unintentionally with
some insect food.&amp;quot; From what I have seen, I should think that
natural fig would be a very likely food for the Roller to partake
of; and the fig tree the bird seems rather to have a liking for. I
have more than once seen one of a pair I now have pick up and
eat odd pieces of dried fig. Several writers tell us that the
Roller feeds on frogs, one adding &amp;quot; smaller mammalia &amp;quot; ; and
another says, &amp;quot; It also frequents broad stretches of reeds, on
which it is said to perch on the look-out for the frogs below.&amp;quot;
To say the least, these statements are misleading : they give one
to understand that the Roller is so far a rapacious bird that it has
the power to tear up its prey ; but it has no such power, although
likely enough it may swallow baby frogs, and also possibly-- not
probably -- juvenile mice, if not afraid of them ; the sight of a
live mouse would scare my Rollers out of their seven senses. A
mouse cut up, however, and a callow young bird, would probably
be good for a Roller in captivity. The power of the Roller is
in its beak ; and it seizes its prey in a vice-like grip, sometimes
banging it against its perch with great violence. Moreover, to
infer that a Roller would willingly perch upon a reed, and plunge
down amongst the reeds after a frog, is to misrepresent its nature.
It is, in a sense, a heavy clumsy bird amongst foliage ; it cannot
hop from perch to perch but must use its wings, and greatly dis-
likes going where the tips of its long wings may flap against any
thing. It likes to perch on a substantial bough, a bare, dead one
from preference, on rocks, large stones, or on some open, solid,,
raised seat, from which it may look down for beetles, locusts,,
grasshoppers, or other large insects, on which it will swiftly dive
from its watch-post, often returning to the same place. But the
statement that it will perch on a reed, even on such gigantic
reeds as one meets with in Kgypt, is rather difficult to under-
stand. It rarely stops on the ground longer than is necessary
for seizing and swallowing its prey ; all the same I quite fail to
see that on the ground it is &amp;quot;very clumsy,&amp;quot; &amp;quot; grotesque,&amp;quot; &amp;quot;hops

with great effort,&amp;quot; and so on. When I have a scramble for meal-
worms in my aviary, and the Rollers are on the ground with
other large birds, I find that they are as active as the best of
them, darting about from place to place, and invariably getting
the lion&amp;apos;s share.

THE SEX OF PENNANTS.
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.997042875" page_id="32635544"  page_num="107" year="" vol="">
By the Rev. C. D. Farrar.
I suppose that the one thing which keeps back amateurs
from trying to breed these splendid birds is the difficulty of
securing pairs.
Writing of Pennants, Mr. Gedney says, &amp;quot;The inability to
recognise any outward distinction of sexes in these birds has
deterred many amateurs from attempting to breed them in
captivity. Beyond an imperceptibly lighter shade upon the breast
of the adult hen and a somewhat smaller and more effeminate
head, there is absohttely no means by which an inexperienced
person could determine the sexes.&amp;quot;
Dr. Greene is even more careful not to commit himself-
&amp;quot;The sexes,&amp;quot; he says, &amp;apos;\0x25A0&amp;apos;\0x25A0resemble each other in size aiid colouring,
although the tints of the plumage in the female are, perhaps, not
quite so brilliant as in the male bird.&amp;quot;
I can only conclude that Mr. Gedney and Dr. Greene never
saw a hen Pennant, otherwise they would never have penned
such amazing statements !
There is absohdely no possibility of mistaking a hen for a
cock Pennant. They are as different, as they say up here, as
chalk from cheese. In the first place, the hen Pennant is one-
third smaller than the cock, and has a small round head ;
whereas, he has a somewhat flattened crown. These points alone
would almost be sufficient to any but a tyro ; but when we come
to examine the plumage, a mistake is absolutely impossible : --
The cock has a rich crimson head extending right over
the neck and cheeks.
The hen has a head of orange-red shading off into greeny
orange on the neck ; the cheeks are very pale greeny pink.
The chin of the cock is splendid violet.
The chin of the hen is quite pale violet.
Breast of the cock rich crimson.

Breast of the hen reddy orange, the lower feathers of the
breast tipped with green.
Back of the cock, each feather black, edged with rich
crimson.
Back of the hen, top part, each feather dull black, edged
with a very narrow strip of colour like the colour of the Strand
Magazijie, followed by a broader strip of orange-red ; the lower
feathers are dull black and are edged with green and orange,
Shoulder of cock rich mauve.
Shoulder of hen pale mauve.
Wing of cock dark violet, flights much better colour than
in the hen.
Wing of hen fairly dark violet, shaded towards the back
with paler mauve, edged with pale orange.
Rump of cock rich crimson ; rump of hen orange red.
Tail of cock, outer feathers rich violet, centre black.
Tail of hen violet with greenish centre.
L^egs of cock black ; legs of hen grey.
I may say that nearly all the birds sold as hens are young
birds in their first feathers -- which youngsters are dark green,
mottled and splashed with red ; but no one who has had a hen
would ever be deceived by such, {a)
Pennants are most engaging birds. My hen is so tame,
although she is in a large outdoor aviary, that she is almost a
nuisance. Whenever I go out she at once comes to the edge and
begins rubbing her poll on a branch as a gentle hint that
she would like a little flowering grass or some green corn in the
ear ; she will also carry on a little conversation in Pennantese, if
I make a kissing noise with my lips. Her lord and master is a
bit more suspicious, although absurdly eager to know what is
going on and to see what his wife has got. Poor fellow, I expedt
he remembers the day when he was trapped out in Australia,
owing to his enquiring turn of mind.
I find that my Pennants are perfectly hardy, but they
don&amp;apos;t like too much sun, and quite pant like old hens do at mid-
fa.) In the British Museum Catalogue one description alone, of the adult plumage,
is given, -- had the sexes iu variably differed in plumage as Mr. Farrar&amp;apos;s birds appears to do
a separate description of the female plumage would, in all probability, have been given.

day. They sleep in the covered run during the hottest part of
the day, and are most lively in the evening. The cock&amp;apos;s note is
something like the barking of a dog, and he has rather a nice
whistle in spring. I feed my Pennants on hemp and canary seed,
and they have a nice grass lawn in the aviary. They are great
bathers and delight in getting into a deep pan, and making the
water fairh^ fly. Mine have an aviar}^ to themselves, as do all
my Parrakeets, so I cannot say how they would behave in a
mixed society.
I have not been successful yet in breeding Pennants, as I
could never get a hen : but I quite hope to do so next year, if we
live and all goes well.
Pennants are never very plentiful in the market ; and I
consider that a true pair, and acclimatised, would be well worth

An appeal from our energetic Secretary to supply him
with cop3^ is not always easy to respond to. To write one of
those delightful accounts of the life of a bird, or a happ}^
married pair, which so often decorate, and materiall}^ add to
the interest of, our Magazine, is not within my power.
Having a rather large collection myself, I am sometimes
inclined to envj^ other members of our Society who confine their
attention to a selecSt number of favourites, whose behaviour and
habits the}^ are, in consequence, able to observe closely and
describe in minute detail. Birds, after all, are ver}^ like human
beings. The solitary man or woman, living his or her individual
life apart in his or her appropriate cage, displays various
peculiarities or angles full}^ developed ; placed in a crowd, these
angles are soon worn off, and members of a large societ)^ become
verj^ much alike. My birds are all in a crowd, or I should rather
</bodyText>
<bodyText confidence="0.992031454545454" page_id="32635547"  page_num="110" year="" vol="">
no
say in several crowds, as in their case the obliteration of angles
cannot be allowed to go too far without undesirable and often
disastrous results ; such differences of habit as there might
naturally be between the various occupants of each aviary
consequently rather tend to disappear.
Among seed-eating birds, a noteworthy peculiarity is the
wonderful strength of constitution of the Weavers. A dead
Weaver is almost as uncommon as a dead donkey. I have always
been inclined to attribute this largely to their living mainl}^ on
canary seed, of which they eat fully four times as much as
they do of millet ; Indian millet they seem hardly to touch,
though they certainly are fond of the spray form. If this is so,
however, whr is the mortality among the closely related
Whydahs, which also live mainly on canary seed, so much
greater ? It is true it is chiefly the Pintailed and Paradise
Whydahs that I have found difficult to keep, the Pintails going
off without any apparent cause, and the Paradise cocks never
surviving their second moult out of colour (the hens are hardy
enough) ; but moulting with them is hardly a more severe
operation than it is with many of the Weavers whose health is
hardly ever affected by it, and the Red-collared and Yellow-
backed Whydahs moult without difficulty.
It has been suggested that Weavers owe their longevity in
confinement to their never, or very rarely, attempting to breed,
and this is probabl}^ the correct explanation. Out of a fairly
large number of species, I have only once had a nest of the
Orange Weaver ; one young one was hatched but not reared.
My cock Oryx is of a decidedly amatory disposition, but always
seledls as the object of his affections a hen Orange or Napoleon
Weaver, both of which treat his advances with undisguised
aversion ; his own hen he entirely negle(5ts.
While on the subject of Weavers, has it ever been
remarked that the species in which the cock is mainly black in
summer plumage are the earliest to come into colour ? I have
at present Pyrotnelaiia capensis in full colour, and Urobrachya
axillaris and bocagii nearly so, though strangely P. c. minor is
still in its winter plumage. Of those in which red or yellow
predominates, Foudia viadagascariensis, Nesacanthis emine^itissima
and Ploceus atrigida are half in colou.r, but no other species has
commenced the change yet. The Combassou seems most ir-
regular in this respect ; my solitary cock has been in full colour
for twelve months since he first came into colour as a young bird.
Of the Whydahs, the Red-collared Whydah {Penthelria ardens)
</bodyText>
<bodyText confidence="0.992932744186047" page_id="32635548"  page_num="111" year="" vol="">
is nearly in full colour ; the collar seems to become redder as the
bird gets older ; when I first had my specimen, over two years
ago, it was of yellow orange colour.
There are two Weavers against which I ought to warn all
aviculturists with susceptible ears : I refer to Hyphantornis cucul-
latus and H. spilonotus. They are undoubtedly handsome birds,
and their weaving is highly interesting ; but they screech as
cacophonously as any Parrot and they do it almost unceasingly
throughout the day, added to which their tempers are the reverse
of amiable. The}^ both have a curious habit of from time to
time, as it were, running amuck through the aviary&amp;quot;&amp;quot;, shrieking
at the top of their voices ; this, however, does not appear to
frighten the other birds, who only just get out of their way till
they calm down again. I have only noticed this habit during
the summer. Last j^ear a hen H. aureijiavus took possession of
a nest nearly completed by H. spilonotus and proceeded to line
it with feathers ; the bigger bird, in spite of his unamiable
temper, never attempted to drive her out, but contented himself
with fluttering round the nest or sitting on a neighbouring twig
as long as she was in occupation, hurling abuse at her in
language totally unfit for publication ; this apparently got on her
nerves at last, and she abandoned her design of rearing a family
-- the nest was soon afterwards destroyed.
This habit of pulling their nests to pieces almost as soon
*as they are finished seems to be a regular practice with the
African Weavers, and it makes a terribly untidy litter all over
the aviary. My Indian Weavers have never done any building
(they are all bachelors) ; possibly grass, which is the only
material I supply for the purpose, does not suit them, though
the African species highly appreciate it. {a) I should mention,
however, that the Madagascar Weaver also will not use grass,
and has never built with me though he has a wife to help him .;
according to Dr. Russ this species prefers aloe or Agave fibre.
It seems that birds which build without the artificial
support of a nesting-box require a stronger material than grass
or hay ; except perhaps such birds as the Buntings, which build
very strong open nests with the tough flowering stems which are
naturally far stronger than the leaves. My Pied Mannikins
built once a beautiful nest of aloe fibre which lasted for several
months, but since they have only been supplied with hay their
successive nests are destroyed as soon as made. However, I have
{a.) My Indian WeaYers, also batchelors, have built very strong; and quite opaque
blasts with hay alone.^A, G. B,
</bodyText>
<bodyText confidence="0.994776" page_id="32635549"  page_num="112" year="" vol="">
a wholesome dread of aloe fibre, after having had some valuable
birds entangled and hung by it, and never use it now.
It is astonishing what an immense quantity of hay the small
Ornamental Finches can dispose of. In my aviary set apart for
these there are about fifty birds ; I give them a good handful of
hay almost every day, all of which gets tucked into their nestmg
boxes, only the shortest pieces being unappropriated, and they
are always ready for more.
The cock Sycalis arve^isis, in an open air aviary, has just
begun to sing. I know of nothing that so closely resembles his
song as saw-sharpening, of all sounds the most shrill except,
perhaps, the Bat&amp;apos;s cry. It is a bright and active bird, but its
music is too excruciating. I should be glad to come across an
mndotibted female, as they should breed.
An incident that occurred a few days ago with me is
interesting in reference to the question of the hardiness of
tropical birds. My Shama, being almost more than tame, is
allowed the free run of the bird- house, and late one frosty after-
noon he slipped out into the garden as the door was opened.
Though as a rule he comes to me very readily, on this occasion
he absolutely refused to be caught and flew away out of sight, and
I was not able to secure him until the next morning. There was
sharp frost that night, the thermometer registering 22*^ F., but
my bird has not shown the slightest ill effedls from the cold and
exposure, though since he has been in my possession he has
never known a lower temperature than about 50* F. Doubtless,
however, it would not be safe to ai&amp;apos;gue from this incident that
the Shama can be kept in an open air aviary during the winter.
I have recently acquired a Dhyal Bird, which entirely
belies the reputation I have seen given to the species of being
excessively shy and nervous in disposition {a). My bird may be the
exception that proves the rule, as he is most bold and confiding,
taking mealworms (of which he is inordinately fond) from my
hand or pecking at my fingers if I don&amp;apos;t oifer him one, and
whenever I approach his cage he comes close up to the wires to
see if I am bringing him anything. His close relationship to
the Shama is evident in his every movement and gesture, but he
is a larger bird and perhaps not quite so handsome. He has not
given me much opportunity of criticising his singing powers,
which are said to be at least equal to those of his near relative.
I feed these birds on a mixture of Abrahams&amp;apos; food, dried yolk,
(a) This bird is notoriously bold, even in its wild state.-- R.P.

and ants&amp;apos;-eggs, with a little potato, giving also a few mealworms
\0x25A0and cockroaches daily. On this food my Sham a has thriven for
nearly three years ; and his recent escapade, as just related,
proves that he is by no means in feeble health ; often, for weeks
at a time, he entirely refuses mealworms (his customary
allowance is six or seven a day), and cockroaches are then his
only insect-food. He has never had meat in any form, as it seems
to me most inappropriate food for an insecflivorous bird.

Sir, -- In reply to Mr. vSeptimus Perkins, I fail to see that because
&amp;quot; the abilit}^ to digest farinaceous food depends upon the power to convert
starch into dextrine &amp;quot; the most delicate insectivorous birds, such as the
English Warblers, are therefore necessarily iinable to digest bread. If any
-of these birds did, as he suggests, live entirely upon inserts in a wild state,
there would be something in his argument, but they do ttot.
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.904162375" page_id="32635550"  page_num="113" year="" vol="">
Probably the most delicate of all the English Warblers is the Gold-
crest, which, in addition to insect food, swallows both seeds and berries;
nor do I know of one Warbler (the natural food of which is known) which
does not eat the smaller berries, such as elderberries.
Mr. Perkins&amp;apos; mention of the Nightingale is unfortunate for his argu-
ment, because this bird is the one species upon which the discussion arose,
and of which Mr. FuUjames said that it could not digest biscuit or bread
* crumbs. Now Mr. Perkins not only thinks that the Nightingale, being
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.94540065" page_id="32635550"  page_num="113" year="" vol="">
accustomed to swallow a certain amount of cellulose, may be expected to
\0x25A0convert a certain amount of starch into dextrine ; but he further admits
that biscuit, being already partiallj&amp;apos; converted, is almost (if not altogether)
a suitable food for the more delicate insectivorous birds. (")
After all, the best argument that can be used for or against any food
is experience. Mr. Fulljames found that Nightingales fed partly on bread
died before the end of the first year of captivity ; and he fairl}&amp;apos; calls my
attention to the fact that my birds did not live more than eighteen months ;
still eighteen months represent a good period in which a bird is discovering
that it &amp;quot;will not eat and cannot digest&amp;quot; that which it has eaten and
digested for a year and a half.
As to the suggestion that my Nightingales died of fits : all I can say is
that those fits curiously resembled heat apoplexy, and did not in the least
look like fits resulting from indigestion.

;am not enamoured of that phrase, which I adopted on the spur of the

moment for want of a better, but I will try to explain what I meant by it.
There are many questions in aviculture which remain open, but there are
some upon which there exists a more or less complete concensus of opinion.
For instance, no one dispiites that the staple food of Waxbills should be
white-millet seed, or that Parrots require water to drink. When I say that
no one disputes these things, I mean, of course, no one whose opinion is
entitled to the respect of experienced aviculturists. With regard to the
feeding of the more exclusively insectivorous birds, it is impossible to
assert that &amp;quot; no one disputes&amp;quot; that the diet should be non-farinaceous; but
I think I am justified in saying that, with the single exception of Dr.
Butler, all competent modern authorities take that view ; and if I maj&amp;apos; so
far trespass upon space I will venture to give a few quotations to prove
this.
In &amp;quot; Song Birds of Great Britain &amp;quot; Dr. Greene writes,-- &amp;quot; My Nightin-
gale&amp;apos;s food consists of as many dried ants&amp;apos;-eggs as it chooses to eat, eight or
ten mealworms daily, or rather on alternate days, and in the interval the
same number of blackbeetles, which it appears to equally enjoy, a little
green food in the shape of chopped lettuce, and cooked mutton cut up very
small, about three times a-week.&amp;quot;
The late Dr. Bradburn, in his most valuable little book on British
Birds, saj&amp;apos;s, -- &amp;quot; The food must be soaked ants&amp;apos;-eggs as a staple : there is
nothing to touch them. Avoid all pastes and messes if you wonld have
strong healthy birds. Nightingales will live on good ants&amp;apos;-eggs and half-a-
dozen mealworms per da}&amp;apos;, and keep in grand condition all the year round.&amp;quot;
He then goes on to mention various things which may be given by way of
a change, none of them, however, in the least resembling breadcrumbs.
I have purposely selected for quotation writers who are not members
of our Society. With regard to our own members it is sufficient to point
out that not one of them who has taken part in this discussion on &amp;quot; Food
for Soft-billed Birds &amp;quot; supports Dr. Butler in his advocacy of bread for
Nightingales and other warblers. Dr. Butler appears to be in a minority of
one.
I am anxious not to be misunderstood. I do not wish for one moment
to suggest that the knowledge or experience of Dr. Greene or Dr. Bradburn
or anyone else is greater than that of Dr. Butler. I simply want to shew
that the concensus of opinion is against him : in other words, that his
contention is contrary to &amp;quot; orthodox avicultural teaching.&amp;quot;
It may be that Dr. Butler is right and everyone else wrong, but it is
clear that he is the heretic, and not those who condemn breadcrumbs. This
is all I undertook to shew.
Septimus Perkins.
Sir, -- If I understand Mr. Perkins rightly, he regards the opinions
of Dr. Greene and the late Dr. Bradburn as orthodox. I do not. I will say
nothing more respecting the former gentleman lest it should be imagined
that I have a personal objection to him (which is not the case). With regard
to the late Dr. Bradburn, his opinion was based upon experiments carried on
in one direction onl}&amp;apos;, and he was far from correct in some of his views : he
was a strong advocate for the use of chopped beef for soft-billed birds,
and that is certainly an error in the opinion of many aviculturists of the
present time.

Mr. Perkins will find, if lie looks through the letters on soft food
which have been piiblished in the Magazine, that I do not stand alone in
my advocac}- of bread as an article of diet in soft food mixtures : moreover,,
if he will get a tin of Abrahams&amp;apos; food for soft-billed birds, he will find that
this gentleman (than whom no living authority has had more experience)
recommends that his food be mixed with double its bulk of stale bread-
crumbs.
I think it possible that the more delicate Warblers would do better
with less bread than I have generally given them ; for when I reared the
Sedge- Warbler and Lesser Whitethroat they died from apoplexy ; being
found (when skinned) to be abnormally fat : they therefore not only digested
bread, but it proved too nourishing for them.
A. G. BuiXER.
Sir,-- The Nightingale, Blackcap Warbler, Larger and Lesser White-
throat, Redstart, Wheatear, Wagtails, Tits, Flycatchers, Larks, etc., can be
kept in the best of health on ants&amp;apos;-eggs (or more correctly, cocoons), meal-
worms, blackbeetles, crickets, flies, spiders, butterflies, moths, mothworms,
caterpillars, gentles, flesh maggots, woodlice, wasp grubs, etc.
Mealworms I always render helpless by incising them behind the
head with a sharp knife before putting in the cage. Beetles, crickets and
woodlice I usually kill by scalding with boiling water before giving to the
birds.
Wasp-nests may be procured in the summer from artizans in the
country districts, who take a delight in hunting for them, and seem well
satisfied with sixpence to one shilling per nest, according to the size.
I make it known to the country workmen that I am open to buy a few
nests of wasps at prices named above, and soon the men come in with their
pocket-handkerchiefs full of them. They are just taken and all alive, but
the winged wasps are stunned and so made helpless by the &amp;quot; fuse &amp;quot; which is
used to keep them off whilst the nest is being taken. I at once put the
nests into a hot oven and bake them until they are nearly brown, and
then remove them from the oven, put them on an old tray on the top of
the oven or cooking stove, drying them until all moisture has disappeared.
If the grubs will rattle when a cake is shaken about, they can then be stored
away in baskets or boxes in a dry place. Be sure the}^ are thoroughly dried
before they are stored away, or they will become mouldy and spoil. They
can be used dry, powdered, or after being steeped in boiling water.
Other insects can be given when they are plentiful. No one need
despair of keeping soft-billed British birds in good health and condition, in
a favourable temperature, with such a bill of fare to select from. Ripe fruit
and dried fruit may be offered occasionally as a luxury.
I have kept several Nightingales and other soft-billed British birds in
the best of health and condition, and won with them at most leading shows
in Great Britain, and have fed them on one or more of the items specified.
My Nightingales would sing almost as soon as unpacked in a show-room.
The Secretary from Carlisle Shov/, on one occasion, sent me a post card
saying that his Committee sat listening to my &amp;quot; Gale &amp;quot; until the early hours
of the morning after they had unpacked him at about 10.30 the night
previous. Chas. Houi,ton.

Sir, -- Your inviting correspondence on this interesting subject, some
time ago, emboldens me to write and give my experience. My soft-billed
birds now consist of four cock Song Thrushes, a Blackbird, a Sk3dark,
an American Mocking Bird, and a Nightingale ; and my staple food for them
is hard-boiled egg and breadcrumbs, stirred together with a three tined
fork, to which I add ants&amp;apos;-eggs and slightly crushed hemp, and mix lightly
together so that the birds can pick out, without difficulty, what they like best.
The Nightingale and Mocking Bird get a dozen or more mealworms each
everj&amp;apos; da}^ and the Lark coarse oatmeal and canary seed. The Thrushes are
very fond of Spratt&amp;apos;s dog biscuit soaked in grav)^ from a bullock&amp;apos;s head,
which I boil for my dogs. When the weather is warm, I give them all
gentles ; and the way I produce them is this : I buy about a pound of cheap
foreign beef for 3d., put it in the sun for about two daj^s, then put it in a
large flower pot and fill the pot up with garden mould -- after ten days I find
nothing but fine gentles and mould. I have them sifted through a cinder
sieve into a Nestle&amp;apos;s tinned milk box, and throw a trowelful into the
aviaries every day.
As bread is rather relaxing for birds, I substitute, occasionally, barley-
meal made crumbly with milk, and scraps of sponge cake, which can be
bought cheap.

Sir, -- As the Spring advances, some of us, mindful of failures in the
past, are anxiouslj- considering how we ma}&amp;apos; command greater success in
the approaching breeding season. In this connection, it would probably
be of great advantage if those aviculturisLs who have succeeded in rearing
some of the more difficult subjects would explain their methods. I for one
should be very greatly obliged for any practical hints of a system of
management which has proved successful in rearing an}&amp;apos; of the foreign
insectivorous birds.
I have a beautiful pair of Rock-thrushes just passing their second
Winter in an open aviary. They are in the highest condition, and the male
is fast acquiring his handsome breeding-dress of cobalt blue and bright
chestnut. Last Summer young were twice hatched ; and, if my mealworms
had held out, I have no doubt the young would have safely left the nest.
But the parents would take nothing but certain insects to the young, and
not even flies or small earthworms ; and as, while inse(5ls were being given,
they themselves would not look at their usual mixture of artificial food, the
drain upon my store of mealworms was considerable ; and at the time (May
and June) they were hardly to be obtained, and not at all at short notice.
In the end the mealworms, and such wire worms, centipedes and woodlice as
I could collect, gave out, and the young died. The birds went to nest again
at once, and I accumulated a small supply of mealworms in readiness ; but
they were soon exhausted, and all the young died, except one which I took
at nine days old and endeavoured to rear by hand.
However, I suppose the youngster had been left too long in the nest,
for it was curiously wild and stubborn, though two young Song-thrushes of
the same age, placed with it as companions, were easily reared ; for the
whole of the succeeding week the Rock-thrush obstinately refused to open

his beak, and had to be crammed. In the end it suffered from some
derangement of the intestines, and succumbed.
A neighbour of mine, last Summer, lost three broods of Shamas from
the same cause -- inability to keep up a supply of fresh insedl food. I have
seen it stated that Mr. Phillipps has reared Shamas. If he would be so
kind as to say how he managed this, I feel sure many of our readers would
be grateful (a).
I am inclined to think that it may be best in a similar case to take
the young at a week old, and try to rear them on a diet of scraped lean
meat, egg, and such insects as are obtainable ; but of course it would be
more satisfacSlorj^ if one could help the old birds to carry out their parental
duties.

Sir, -- May I ask the name of the beautiful Lory at the Palace Show --
&amp;quot; V.H.C., 2,137, Mr. C. T. Maxwell, cock, ^5 &amp;quot; ? Roughly describing it, it
had a rather dark speckled red and black throat, and green back, and, as
regards colouring, took my fancy more than any other.
Might I suggest that at such an important Show (visited by
aviculturists from all parts of the Kingdom, many of whom see some
of the birds for the first time), the label or catalogue, or both, should give
the name of the exhibit. Nearly all Mr. Maxwell&amp;apos;s exhibits were just
catalogued &amp;quot; cock,&amp;quot; which is no doubt enough for the experienced, but
judging from the host of questions put to me throughout the day that I
spent there, scores of visitors had come up to learn as well as see, and must
have felt equally (.&amp;quot;.isappointed with such scant naming of dozens of
beautiful birds.
There were, of course, numerous outsiders drawn by mere curiosity
to see a lot of strange birds, and it is unfortunate for this class of visitors
when the label gets on the wrong cage, which happened in several cases.
I heard a man explaining to his wife that &amp;quot;It was the first time he had ever
seen a Nightingale.&amp;quot; Then they began to take an inventory of the bird :
they &amp;quot; Never expected to see such a small bird, and what a dark coloured
head ! &amp;quot; Not wishing them to take home a wrong impression, at the risk
of being thought impertinent, I pointed out that the label had been trans-
posed with that of a Blackcap and that Mr. Gale tenanted the next cage.
May I also ask what is the difference betweu a ShSma and a Dial or
Dhyal bird ? Dr. Greene classes them as the same bird, but I have seen
them catalogued at two different prices in the same list, and can only
suppose the Shama to be an Indian, and the Dial a Malay or East Indian
variety of the same bird. If they are different birds are their habits and

The Lorikeet referred to was a specimen of Trichoglossus ornatus -- the

People who have had no personal experience of exhibiting sometimes
fail to tmderstand that the catalogue is made up from the entry forms, and
that these are filled up by the exhibitors themselves, so that the exhibitors
and not the managers of the Show are responsible for the omission of the
names and for the transposition of exhibits. Exhibitors, I believe, seldom
keep copies of their entry forms, although it is most important that this
:should be done when more than one entry is made in a class. In the
absence of a copy of the entry form it is almost impossible to attach the
labels to the cages in the right order.
When Dr. Simpson and I acted as Show Secretaries we made a
practice of sending (with the labels) to each exhibitor who had made more
than one entry in the same class, a list of such entries with the numbers of
the labels, so as to insure their being attached in the right order. This
involves a good deal of extra trouble, and it is almost more than can be
reasonably expected from the Secretary of a Show.
Another cause of incorrect cataloguing is that if a bird, entered for a
Show, dies or goes out of condition before the Show, the exhibitor
generally substitutes another bird, often of a different species. In order to
avoid this man}&amp;apos; large exhibitors do not give the names of the species on
the entry forms, and it is certainly better that there should be no name at
all than a wrong one. The Cr3&amp;apos;stal Palace Catalogue has alwaj-s been
\0x25A0especially incorrect, because the entries have to be sent in so long before
the Show.
I have thought it worth while to explain these matters, as although
they are well understood by exhibitors the}&amp;apos; are often puzzling to others.
The Shania [Cittocincla tricolor) and the Dhyal Bird {Copsychus saularis)
are nearly allied but absolutely distinct species.
There was an illustrated article on the Shama by the Rev. H. D.
Astley, in the Magazine for February. The male Dhyal Bird is black and
white -- somewhat like a small Magpie -- it is figured in the &amp;quot;Royal INatural
History.&amp;quot; I hope that before long one of our members who has kept this
*charming bird will give us an article upon it -- I should be very glad to
receive such an article. The Shama is a much finer songster than the Dhyal
Bird, but I should say that the latter is a much bolder and more inquisitive
and amusing bird.
It is difficult to understand how the strange confusion of these very
different birds could have arisen, but I, believe that &amp;quot; Favourite Foreign
Birds&amp;quot; was written against time, under great pressure from the publishers.
The mistake was corrected in the second edition. Dr. Greene is not a safe
guide on questions of nomenclature, classification, and sexual and specific
differences, but this fact should not blind us to the great services he has
rendered to aviculture. His books were for a long time almost the only
avicultural literature in the English language ; he did, for many years,
more than any other man to popularise the study; and his teaching on

Sir, -- I had a pair of birds sent me this morning, and as I know
nothing about them I thought I would ask you about them.
They are called &amp;quot; Plum-headed Parrakeets,&amp;quot; I think. They are short
thick green birds, and both their heads are a sort of grey colour. I have
only an unheated outdoor aviary. I will put a few questions which I shall
</bodyText>

breed ? (4) What food .?

The following i-eply wai&amp;apos; sent to Mrs. Lancaster :
(1) When first imported, the Plum-headed Parrakeet {PalcBor^iis cyano-
cephala) is often as }&amp;apos;Ou describe ; but it should turn into a rather long slim
bird, the two central tail-feathers being especiallj^ long : a young female
may sometimes be distinguished by the shorter tail. As they grow older,
the beautiful colours on the head of the male, and a black collar, will enable
you to distinguish the sexes. When young, to distinguish the sexes is often
very difficult. Look carefully at the wing, (when closed), rather high up
towards the bow, and see if there is any sign of a dark reddish-brown spot.
If both birds have the spot, they are probably two males ; if neither has a
spot, the}&amp;apos; are almost, though not quite, certain to be two females. Rose-
headed Parrakeets (P. rosa) are often confused with the Plum Heads ; and
the females of these have the wing spot as well as the males. Both the
males and the females sing.
</bodyText>

(2) They are not robust when first brought over, but, as soon as
acclimatised, can stand a good deal of cold ; nevertheless, those I have
kept never seemed to like much of it. If 3&amp;apos;our aviary is well sheltered from
the cold Avinds, and is large enough to enable them to fly about freelj-, they
ma}&amp;apos; do fairly well ; but this year the}&amp;apos; should not be put out at any rate
until May.
(3) Yes, under favourable circumstances they breed readily ; but your
birds cannot be expected to breed this year.
(4) Chiefly canary seed, with a little white millet. They are usually
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.91342375" page_id="32635556"  page_num="119" year="" vol="">
very fond of spray millet. A little plain dry biscuit, crumbled small, may
be mixed with the canary seed. A few good oats may be given occasionall}&amp;apos;,
but hemp very sparingly. When nesting, sop squeezed rather dry may be
given, and more biscuit, as then the male feeds the female, and is all the
better for a little help.
The more care you take of your^ two birds this year, the stronger
they are likely to be in the future.

CASSIDIX ORYZIVORA.

Sir, -- I would suggest that iu future a little more supervision be
exercised in the printing of the Palace Catalogues ; I may possibly have
been an unfortunate exception, but two gross errors appeared in my entries.
One entry came out of the printer&amp;apos;s hands as a Racquet-tailed Drowgo, and
what should have been Cassidix oryzivora was transformed into oryzivoid !
From a letter I received immediatel}&amp;apos; preceding the Show, I gathered
that special arrangements had been made with a view to assisting the
reporters to present a fairly intelligent account of the exhibition to the
public : one cannot reasonably expect them to do otherwise than accept
the catalogue as correct, but surely those who are deputed to take the
reporters round should not knowingly perpetuate such palpable printer&amp;apos;s
errors.
With regard to the example of Cassidix oryzivora sent to the Palace, I
am inclined to agree with Mr. Phillipps that it is an immature male, but
cannot explain the curious ill-defined ring of white round the eye. In the
examples of this bird at South Kensington, the white feathers are entirely
wanting. Mr. Dresser, who saw this bird some few weeks before the Show,
took them to be either a mark of immaturity or the result of climatic
influence.
At home in his own cage, this bird is very quaint -- he has the curious
habit, mentioned by Mr. Phillipps, of blowing his feathers out in a most
ridiculous manner, usuall}&amp;apos; at feeding time. He is very peaceful towards
other birds, having occupied an outdoor aviary all last summer with a
collection numbering over thirt\% all smaller than himself, among them
being several tiny Tanagers. In the autumn, when the birds were removed
to their winter quarters, he was left to share the place with some game
Bantams, and during the cold, weather he always went to roost with a
Bantam tucked snugly each side of him.
He will eat almost anj&amp;apos;thing, but has a great partiality for hemp seed
and mealworms.
These birds inhabit Central and South America from Southern
Mexico to Peru and Paraguay.

THE ROLLER AND ITS FOOD.

I^et us now turn more particularly to the food of the
Roller in captivity. As a rule, this unsightly creature, before it
reaches our hands, has been fed chiefly or entirely on raw meat ;
and, as the Roller is often slow to take to strange food, the raw
meat should be withdrawn, or the supply lessened, gradually
and watchfully ; for it will go a long while without food if not
pleased with what is supplied ; but I do not believe in the
wisdom of tr3nng a bird with long fasts, as some bird-owners
almost boast of doing. As far as possible, as suggested by Mr.
Russell Humphrys, feed the Roller on insedts, especially grass-
hoppers, cockchafers and the Coleoptera generally, with a few
worms -- and baby frogs when obtainable ; cockroaches, too, are
valuable, but I do not care about gentles. I cannot obtain inse(5ts
nor breed cockroaches, so have to fall back upon mealworms.
Nevertheless, wherever you are, insects will fail sometimes, and
the Roller cannot be fed solely on mealworms, so something else
must be found. My experience with the Hoopoe, so unlike and
yet so like to the Roller, has taught me that the first thing to be
done with a Roller is to get it on to sop -- milk-biscuit sop is what
I actually provide. This supplies moisture ; the bird takes to it
readil}^, and seldom tires of it. With the ordinary insedlivorous
food I mix scraped meat (cooked and raw), and a little prepared
yolk of egg. The yolk of a fresh egg I give occasionally as a
treat, but this I do not mix up with the other food. Dry crumbled
biscuit they always have, and it is usually taken pretty freel}^
They also have access to, and irregularly partake of, bits of
grapes, dates, figs, and occasionally sultana raisins. Sometimes
I notice them feeding complacently out of the seed saucers
supplied for the Parrakeets, but do not know what the particular
attraction may be.

Another interesting question remains to be considered --
The Roller and its Drink. Is the Roller a total abstainer in its
wild state ? Does it drink or does it not drink, that is the ques-
tion ! Morris states -- &amp;quot; They are said never to drink.&amp;quot; My first
Roller, who developed into an exceptionally natural specimen,
and seldom had a chance of getting sop, was never seen to drink
until it had been with nie just short of twelve months ; I was
acquainted with the above-quoted statement of Morris, and was
on the look out, and noted the date of the occurrence. When I
received my present birds (a pair), not being able to supply them
with insects, I took considerable pains to get them on to water ;
but it was slow work, for they had been put on to sop the moment
they arrived. I did not see the female&amp;apos;s introduction to the
drinking water, but what seemed to be the first attempt of the
male was ludicrous, although he was several months old ; he
didn&amp;apos;t know how to drink ; and the water ran out of the corners
of his mouth, and flowed freely down his breast, as he took gulp
after gulp. Even now these birds sit down before the water and
drink in a most ceremonious manner, as if there were some
mystery about the proceeding and they could not quite make it
out. Nevertheless I suspect that caged Rollers, fed on raw meat
and dry food only, with water close under their noses, would
take to it pretty quickly.
I have not ever known a Roller knowingly touch water on
the ground, nor ever attempt to wash an5&amp;apos;where ; but they will
spread out their wings and feathers during a gentle shower in
warm weather. Some time ago, I chucked some mealworms on to
the ground, and down swooped the Rollers, who as usual returned
to their perches immediately, but continued scrutinising the
ground for any that might have been overlooked. One had
fallen into a washing-pan containing less than two inches of
water, and down dropped my little hen again like a shot. For a
few moments she stood in the water, her legs astraddle, astonish-
ment and bewilderment depicted in every feather and feature.
She flew up to her perch, and remained there for some time
dejected and disgusted, the mealworm still lying in the water ;
but, greedy pig as she is, with an unbounded stomach for meal-
worms, I think she would have rather rotted on her perch than
liave gone for that mealworm again.
My theory is that the Roller, from necessity rather than
choice, is certainly a partial, perhaps occasionally or often a
total, abstainer from water. During the dry season in many hot
countries frequented by the bird, except in inaccessible wells,
</bodyText>
<page confidence="0.999611" page_id="32635560"  page_num="123" year="" vol="">
123
</page>
<bodyText confidence="0.99073625" page_id="32635560"  page_num="123" year="" vol="">
water is exceedingly scarce. All the watercourses are dry ; and
one may travel for miles without seeing a drop. And so the bird
has got out of, or never developed, the habit of drinking, and
obtains the moisture necessary for its body from fruits. My
present lazy overfed Rollers are not fair samples,but my old bird
ate grapes with avidity ; lyord Lilford has shewn us that one
specimen he examined (and the whole number he examined
could have been but as a drop in the ocean) had some remains of
figs in its stomach ; and all but the more modern writers give
berries as part of the food of the Roller.
Some one will say here : -- If this be so with the Roller,
how about other birds ! Why should the Roller be the only
abstainer ? Not a writer hints at any other bird not drinking.
True ; I know not of so much as one ; but I fear we must not
attach too much importance to their silence. Some time ago,
I chanced to meet one of our great cabinet -naturalists, and
remarked on the non-drinking of the Hoopoe. To my surprise he
immediately rejoined that the &amp;quot;desert-loving&amp;quot; birds did not drink.
If this is a well-known facft, it is certainly remarkable that it should
not ever, so far as I know, have been referred to in literature on
birds. I sometimes think that the speaker made the remark in
order to give me to understand that there was not anything
tinder the sun, or anywhere else, which I could possibly know
that he was not fully acquainted with, (a) On the other hand, I
remember noticing a case in which, in answer to an anxious
enquirer, a well-known writer told the owner of a sick Hoopoe to
put certain medicine in its drinking water. He clearly did not
know that the Hoopoe, as a rule, does not drink. I have had
twelve Hoopoes in my time, some living for long periods, but
only two out of the twelve were ever seen to drink. These two
were not seen to drink until I had had them about eight months,
when the one became very fond of water, the other drinking
only rarely, I think. The Hoopoe, if I mistake not, is supposed
to be wholely insectivorous ; my birds were not so. In addition
to milk sop, I have it recorded that they partook of rice pudding,
stewed pear, and boiled cabbage ; that they were very fond of
tomatoes and stewed onion ; that they had been seen eating young
shoots of Virginia creeper ; and that they were very fond of
cherries (uncooked) and red currants. They also tried grapes,
(a) Mr. Phillipps does not, of course, overlook the fact that some of our best cabinet-
naturalists are also not only excellent field-naturalists but even ardent aviculturists. --

True, and they also write ; but not one has yet got so far as to say, with Morris,
*&amp;quot; They are said never to drink.&amp;quot;-- R. P.

out had difficulty in manipulating them. I still have a lively
remembrance of their eagerness and excitement when cherries
were tossed down, each bird seizing and rushing off with its
prize ; using the bill as a gouge, they scooped the flesh off the
sides of the fruit as cleverly and neatly as if they had been at it
all their lives. The habits of the Hoopoe, it will be seen,
strongly support my theory about the Roller ; and since the
habits of, comparatively^ such an easily watched bird as the
Hoopoe are so little known to those who write about birds, it is
hardly surprising that the latter should not be fully acquainted
with the manners and customs of the shy, timid, and wary
Roller. The whole matter teaches us the importance of supple-
menting our observations of birds in their wild state by studying
their habits in captivity, keeping them under as natural
conditions as circumstances will permit.
Most of the foregoing was written some time ago ; and I
iiiay well add a few supplementary remarks. My two Rollers
seem to have given up drinking ! Is that because they find they
do not need water or are better without it? or do the}^ disapprove
of cold water during the winter ?
Since the experience of the female, already related, the
male likewise, by an accident, found himself in a bathing dish,
and in the dish he remained as if petrified. Unlike the female,
he is not finger tame ; j^et he allowed me to take liini out of the
water, which covered his feet but little more ; and he sat on my
hand with a dazed expression in his face, as if he had been
saved, by the skin of his teeth, from some ten&amp;apos;ible calamity.
No wonder my two birds have given up drinking ! ! !
During the time I have had these two Rollers, small birds
(Nonpareils, Grey Singing Finches, Bearded Tits, etc.) have
often been left ilying loose with them for weeks together, but
never has either, by look or action, betrayed the slightest
inclination to devour or injure them. Next to a fledgeling, I
suppose there is nothing which will develop a latent rapacious
instinct in a bird so readily as a small ground bird, yet Quails and
lyarks have wholly failed to get a rise out of my Rollers -- there is
nothing of the Jay about the Roller.
I notice in Tlie Zoologist that, last autumn, a pair of adult
birds of this species was shot near Battle in Sussex. The Editor
makes the announcement as if the slaughterer had performed
some meritorious act instead of one calling for the severest
condemnation. In connection with the female it was stated,.

PHEASANTS.
By D. Seth-Smith.
The culture of the many species of Pheasants -- some of
the most magnificent of the feathered tribe -- appears to be less
popular with our members than other branches of aviculture.
To those, however, who can afford the space for fairly large
aviaries, the keeping and breeding of many of the most lovely
species of the Pheasant tribe is a most delightful and fascinating
hobby, and one well worthy of consideration in our Magazine.
It will, of course, be impossible to go fully into the
subject of Pheasant keeping here, but I will try to give a few
directions for the practical management in captivity of some of
the most popular species of this tribe.
Before I speak of the kinds most likely to repay the care
and attention of amateurs, it will be well to briefly consider the
most suitable aviaries in which to keep them. These should be
as large as possible and consist of two parts -- an inner or
covered part composed of woodwork and well lighted, and an
outer part composed of wire netting on a wooden frame-work.
An aviary, each part of which is about twelve feet square and
proportionately high, will be suitable for one cock and his
harem ; but if the outer run be larger the birds will be all the
better for the greater amount of exercise they will thus obtain.
In this part of the aviary it will be a good plan to have,
fastened about one foot below the wire netting at the top, some
strong string netting stretched tightly across, to prevent the
b)irds from injuring themselves, if from a sudden fright they
should dash upward.
The outer part of the aviary must be thickly planted with
[euro]vergreen-shrubs to provide plenty of cover for the birds ; for it
must be remembered that Pheasants are particularly nervous
birds and easily frightened, and if there should be no hiding-
places they will, when suddenly alarmed, dash wildly about,
damaging their plumage or perhaps breaking their necks.
The males of some species are exceedingly spiteful, and if
there is insufficient cover for the hens the latter will occasionally
&amp;quot;be murdered by the cocks. This savage nature of some cock
Pheasants in captivity is one of the greatest drawbacks to the
culture of Pheasants in aviaries ; it is more noticeable in some
species than in others : one of the rarest and most beautiful of
all the true Pheasants -- Soemmering&amp;apos; s -- was pronounced by the

late Superintendent of the Zoological Gardens to be the worst
offender in this respedl (a).
In the covered part of the aviary, stout perches should be
fastened up for the birds to roost on ; and faggots of gorse or
other thick brushwood should be placed against the walls to
afford further protedlion for the hens.
All the species with which we shall have to deal are hardy
and require no artificial warmth during the winter, provided that
their aviary be well sheltered from the north and east winds.
The best food for the adult birds is barley, wheat, rice
and maize ; but the latter must be given sparingly as it is very
fattening. There are several prepared foods for Pheasants
on the market : Chamberlain&amp;apos;s is generally recommended, and
Spratt&amp;apos;s Crissel is very good. The adult Pheasants should be fed
twice daily -- early in the morning, and late in the afternoon just
before they retire to roost. Pheasants, as a rule, do not hatch
their own eggs successfully in captivity, so it is necessary to
obtain reliable broody hens for the purpose. Most Pheasant-
breeders recommend a cross between the Silk^^ and Game Fowl
as being the best variety to employ. Bantams are too small,
being unable to properly cover the Pheasant chicks when the
latter become any size.
The eggs must be collected as they are laid, and kept
carefully in a cool place until a sufficient number have been
obtained for a hen to cover comfortably. The number for one
hen will of course depend upon the size of the latter ; but a
small hen, such as the cross above recommended, will easily
cover from fourteen to sixteen eggs of the size of Amherst&amp;apos;s or
Versicolors.
A habit to which Pheasants are liable in confinement is
that of egg-eating ; the cocks are usually the worse offenders in
this respect, and there appears to be no reliable cure. It is
therefore very important that a sharp look out should be kept
for eggs, for if left about they are liable to be broken, with the
probable result that this habit will quickly become established.
Having selected a broody hen, she should be set in a coop
without any bottom to it, there being merely a handful of straw
{a) In many cases, this is owing- to there not being- a sufficient number of females ;
they are polygamous, and each male should have a suitable number of wives. In some
aviaries, which are constructed for the purpose, with connecting- compartments side by
side, like the tigers&amp;apos; dens at the Zoological Gardens, the male is run into the next com-
partment after having visited each female, and the connecting-door shut for the rest of the
day.-- R. P.

or hay between the eggs and the ground. The coop should have
a run attached in which the hen can feed and take exercise.
As soon as the chicks are fairly strong on their legs, they
should be removed, with their foster-mother, on to fresh dry
turf. They must be fed often, but only a little food must be
given each time. It is very important to feed early in the
morning. A favourite food with amateurs is hard-boiled egg
chopped into very small pieces ; this has, however, the dis-
advantage of being soon burnt up by the sun and thus becoming
hard and indigestible.
Mr. W. B. Tegetmeier, the greatest living authority on
Pheasants, recommends a custard &amp;quot; made by beating an egg
with a tablespoonful of milk, and &amp;apos; setting&amp;apos; the whole by a gentle
heat, either in the oven or by the side of the fire.&amp;quot; The same
authority advises the use of canary seed in preference to meal
for young birds.
Green food in the form of chopped lettuce and onion-tops
must be supplied in addition to the custard and seed. As the
chicks get strong, more seed and less custard should be given ;
and when five or six weeks old, their owner should begin
to gradually accustom them to barley and wheat. Fresh ants*
cocoons are the natural food for Pheasant chicks, but unless a
constant supply of these be guaranteed, it is best not to
commence feeding with them.
Having briefly touched upon the chief points in connection
with the general management of Pheasants in aviaries, we have
now to consider the kinds best adapted to a life of captivity in
this country.
The genus Phasianus, which includes all the so-called true
Pheasants, claims our attention first, as the most familiar and
beautiful of our game-birds belongs to this group. Everyone is
perfectly familiar with the common English Pheasant, but its
origin is perhaps not so well known. Space will not permit of
my going fully into the details of the introduction of the Chinese
Ringed Pheasant ( Phasiainis torquatus) and of how it freely
crossed with the original P. colchicus, which, before the intro-
duction of the former bird, had reigned supreme in our coverts
for centuries. Suffice it to say that the English Pheasant of
to-day is not a true species, but a hybrid, or perhaps more
correctly a mongrel, albeit a singularly beautiful one, the
product of two varieties or sub-species.
All the true Pheasants, with the exception of the Bar-
tailed, or Reeve&amp;apos;s, appear to be capable of freely inter-breeding

<page confidence="0.999375" page_id="32635565"  page_num="128" year="" vol="">

</page>
<bodyText confidence="0.998867023255814" page_id="32635565"  page_num="128" year="" vol="">
with either of the parent forms, or inter se ; so that the members
of this genus are probably only entitled to sub-specific distinction.
They are all of great beauty, and it can be easily understood that
the hybrids produced by the inter-breeding of two well-defined
races, such as the P. colchicus or P. torquatus, with the richly
coloured Japanese P. versicolor (hereafter to be described) are
some of the most beautiful of birds.
All the true Pheasants are well adapted to a life in
captivity, and all appear to lay freely when once acclimatised
and used to their surroundings. Great care must, however, be
taken that they are not suddenly frightened by some unfamiliar
object, for they take fright very easily, and on the appearance of
anything strange, such as a dog or a broom, are apt to dash
upward and injure their heads severely.
Common Pheasants&amp;apos; eggs can be readilj^ hatched under
hens, and the young reared without difficult}&amp;apos;. I remember some
years ago in our woods in Surrey, my dog, against all rules,
made a dash at a sitting hen Pheasant, which so closely resembled
its surroundings that I had not noticed it. Fortunately^ he was
not quick enough to catch the bird, and a few tail feathers only
remained in his mouth, the Pheasant going off uninjured. The
dog was of course duly chastised, but that did not mend matters ;
several eggs were broken and there was little chance of the hen
returning to the remainder of the clutch. I therefore placed the
remaining eggs in my pockets and took them home to the keeper
who placed them safely under a broody hen. How many eggs
there were I cannot remember, but four only hatched, and one
of the chicks died. The three survivors, a cock and two hens,
were successfully reared, and a large aviary was prepared for
them. In this they lived and throve ; and each year several young
were reared from their eggs, which were hatched by common
hens. The cock was a very fine fellow, but had no white on
his neck, shewing that his ancestors were chiefly of the Colchican
variety.
The true Phasianus colchicus is much darker in colour than
are most of our wild Pheasants of to-day ; and, moreover, it
entirely lacks the white ring on the neck, a feature characteristic
of the more recently introduced P. torquatus of China. In
almost any poulterer&amp;apos;s shop may be seen, during the game
season, Pheasants in various phases of plumage : some with the
white patch on the neck very clearly defined, shewing their close
relationship to P. torquatus ; while the descendants of the
original P. colchicus may be noticed with hardly any white on

the neck at all. Others again will sometimes be seen with
exquisite shades of green and blue in their plumage, giving
plain evidence of the introduction of the Japanese Pheasant
( Phasiamis versicoloj&amp;quot; ) , another and exquisitely beautiful sub-
species. This Pheasant is now often to be obtained from the
dealers at a moderate price, and is certainly one of the most
lovely of the tribe. It is a somewhat smaller bird than either
P. colchicus or P. torq^iattis, and the young are said to be quite
ias eas5&amp;apos;^ to rear as either. The colours of the cock are chiefly
metallic green and blue of different shades on the head and
underparts, chestnut on the back, and greenish grey on the rump
and wing coverts. The hen is much like those of the common
species, but her markings are more clearly defined.
In his very useful &amp;quot;Hand-book to the Game Birds&amp;quot; Mr.
Ogilvie-Grant writes, -- &amp;quot;The Japanese Pheasant inter-breeds
readily with the Chinese Ring-necked Pheasant, the male hybrid
being a remarkably fine bird, surpassing in size and beauty either
of its parents. This species also crosses freely with P. colchicus,
the males being truly splendid birds, not unlike P. elega?is&amp;apos;^&amp;apos; in
general colouring, but very much larger.&amp;quot;
Versicolors are said to lay very freely in suitable aviaries,
and are, like all the true Pheasants, polygamous, four or five hens
being usually kept with the cock.
Another Pheasant hailing from Japan is Soemmerring&amp;apos;s
/P. soemmerringii) . The male may be described as of a rich
fiery copper colour. The hen is coloured somewhat like him,
but her tints are less brilliant. This is perhaps the most
laeautiful of the true Pheasants, but it is very rare in this
country, and, unless a very large enclosure can be placed at
its disposal, the cock will be almost certain to attempt the
murder of his wives. This most unfortunate habit of some
captive Pheasants is, however, by no means confined to
Soemmerrings : there is probably hardly a species certain
individuals of which will not, at times, be troublesome in
this way. The best and safest plan is, as before mentioned, to
provide plenty of thick cover for the hens, and, if the cock
should be inclined to be nasty towards them, to cut the quill
feathers of one of his wings fairly close, in order to give the
hens a better chance of getting out of his way.
The Prince of Wales&amp;apos; Pheasant {P. principalis) is another
very beautiful bird, but at present quite unprocurable in
England. It is found wild in North - Western Afghanistan,

principalis, as well as numerous others, which are yet unknown
to us in a living state, may be procurable in the English market.
The giant of the race, and one of the most attractive, is
Reeve&amp;apos;s, or the Bar-tailed Pheasant (/*. reevesii), a species which
does not inter-breed with its congeners so readily as do other
true Pheasants; and the h3^brids produced from Reeve&amp;apos;s and any
other Pheasants are said to be quite sterile. The Bar-tailed
Pheasant is therefore in all probability, not merely specifically,
but generically distinct from the true Pheasants, although still
included in the genus Phasianiis by most authors. A majestic
bird this truly is, measuring some six feet or more in total length,
and with plumage chiefly of a pure golden colour, each feather
being edged with black, as in a perfectly marked &amp;quot; golden
spangled &amp;quot; fowl. It is now comparatively easy to obtain these
grand birds in this country, as they have been bred in aviaries
by several amateurs ; and on some estates, both in England
and Scotland, have been introduced into the coverts. They
seem to succeed best amongst the wild rocky scenery of
Scotland, which must somewhat resemble the mountainous
districts of China in which the species is found in a wild state.

REVIEWS.
The &amp;quot;-Feathered World&amp;apos;&amp;quot; Spring Ntunber.
Probably five-sixths of the members of the Avicultural
Society are subscribers to the Feathered World, so that a review
of the Spring number of that paper is really a work of super-
erogation -- but for the benefit of the remaining sixth we wish to
call attention to this excellent three-pennyworth. We can only
mention the articles and illustrations which are of special
interest to aviculturists, but doubtless the two coloured plates,,
and other &amp;quot; features,&amp;quot; will be highl}^ appreciated by the poultry
and pigeon people.
There is an article by Dr. Butler on &amp;quot; Some imported
Finches of the genus Spennophila,&amp;apos;&amp;quot; which treats of the White-
throated Finch, the Bluish Finch, the Lined Finch, the Guttural
Finch, and the Reddish Finch. This is accompanied by a really

excellent picture b}^ Mr. Lydon, representing all five species
(both sexes of the Guttural Finch being figured). It is no easy
task to shew, in black and white, the distinctive characteristics
of such closely allied species, but the artist has succeeded in
shewing this, and we have seldom seen a more satisfactory and
life-like drawing of birds.
There is a short illustrated article on the Arizona Quail,
and one on &amp;quot;Larks and other British Birds in Captivity.&amp;quot;
Mr. Camps&amp;apos; article, entitled &amp;quot; My Bird Room,&amp;quot; is
apparently a reprint, with some alterations and additions, of one
from his pen which appeared in the Aviadtural Magazine for
December, 1894; a number which has, b}^ the way, long been
out of print. The article was well worth reproducing, and
is made much more interesting by the illustrations wliich now
accompany it.
&amp;quot; The Grey Java Sparrow,&amp;quot; by Mr. W. T. Page, is sub-
stantially the same as an article which appeared quite recently
in this Magazine.
Popular Parrakeets : their Breeding and Managetnejit by Amateurs,
by W. T. Greene, M.A., M.D., F.Z.S., Qfc.
In this, his latest work, we find Dr. Greene at his best, and
we can most heartily recommend this practical little book to our
readers. The Introduction contains valuable hints on aviary
building, the selection of nesting boxes, and other matters, and
is followed by chapters on the Budgerigar, Cockatiel, Ring-
necked Parrakeet, Rosella, New Zealand Parrakeet, Turquoisine,
Blossom-headed Parrakeet, and King Parrakeet, while a few
other species are treated of incidentally. &amp;quot; Popular Parrakeets &amp;quot;
seems to have been written with great care, and is commendably
free from the &amp;quot; padding &amp;quot; which often disfigures avicultural
handbooks. Dr. Greene has wisely adopted the nomenclature of
the Catalogue of Birds at the British Museum, and avoids those
discussions on classification which are so out of place in a
popular manual.
The statement that the King Parrakeet belongs to the sub-
family of the Broad-tails must be a slip of the pen.
The illustrations are shocking.
There is a very complete index -- a most useful addition to
a book of this sort.

HEN PENNANT PARRAKEETS ; WINTERING BIRDS OUT
OF DOORS ; CHANGE OF PLUMAGE IN WEAVERS.
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.997970695652174" page_id="32635571"  page_num="132" year="" vol="">
Sir, -- I think Mr. Farrar has a hen of a different kind, as I have seen
a great number of Pennants in the nestinj^-season, and with their young
families, in their native land, Victoria, but I never saw much difference
between the sexes except in their manner and in the carriage of the head,
the cock looking much prouder and more given to swagger -- but he is,
perhaps, a little more brilliant. On the other hand, I did see some birds
similar to the hen described, in South Australia, veiy frequently in cages,
but I do not remember noticing them wild. These are, however, well
known to be a different variet}&amp;apos;, and have a name of their own which I forget.
In the wild state the Pennants and Rosellas hang about the home-
steads together, and if allowed liberty will do the same in England,
apparently not having any desire to fly to woodlands -- at least, mine were
so ; but I had to cage them up again because they went down the chimneys
several times.
Pennants are particularly &amp;quot;loose&amp;quot; in their colour, and soon go
brownish if left in the sun. All Australian creatures seem to avoid the
midday sun, and the Bush is quiet for a few hours in the middle of the day,
even where there is shade.
Almost any bird (fowl, pigeon, or fancy cage-bird) must be kept out of
the sun if its full brilliancy of colour is required, as any person who shows
soon learns.
I should like to know if any of our members have kept Red-faced
Love-birds in an outdoor aviary for several winters. I have kept them
for an odd winter once, but I fancied the cold was too much for them. I
onlj&amp;apos; want to keep cocks. Is the Madagascar really much more hardy ? 1
should also like to know if a vShama would stand the winter in an open
aviarj&amp;apos; in a cold part of Lancashire (b).
I am trying Red Lories {Eos rubra) in it ; they have stood it well so far,
but this is the most trying season, I always find. I suppose the birds get
run down with the long cold weather, and the cold windy nights of March
and April just seem to finish them off.
This 3&amp;apos;ear again one of my Rufous-necked Weavers went into dull
winter plumage, while the other retained his full black and yellow suit. I
have had them now two years, and they seem in perfect health and feather.
Last 5&amp;apos;ear it was suggested that perhaps the one which went grey was a very
young one or the other a very old one, but would that argument stand
good again for this year .&amp;apos;&amp;apos;
A. A. Thom.
(d) I have now a pair of Red-faced Lovebirds, in perfect condition, which have spent
a large part of the last;three j&amp;apos;ears in my very open aviary ; but duringr the winter I insist
on their going into the bird-room, at any rate at night. When really well established, they
can stand a good deal of cold, but they do not like it, and it is not good for them ; never-
theless, being constitutionally timid, they cannot be depended upon to seek shelter -- the
slightest thing will keep them out. I consider the Madagascar Lovebird to be a much
hardier species. It is my opinion that a Shama would not stand a winter in an open aviary,
but I believe they have been kept out through the winter in well shut up quarters.-- R. P.

FOOD FOR SOFT-BILLED BIRDS.
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.976973" page_id="32635572"  page_num="133" year="" vol="">
Sir,-- It may be true that none of the English Warblers live
absolutely entirely on insects, but I believe that many of them, such as
the Nightingale, Redstart, Wheatear, Whinchat, vStonechat, and ChifFchafF,
eat very little else. On the other hand, it is certain that the Blackcap,
Greater and Lesser Whitethroat, and Garden Warbler, are largely fruit-eaters.
Mr. Meade- Waldo&amp;apos;s instructive article on &amp;quot; The Food of the Blackcap,&amp;quot;
which appeared in the Magazine last year, proved that that species will live
for years on fruit alone, and my own observations confirm this. But because
a Blackcap will live on fruit it does not follow that a Nightingale would.
The birds require quite different treatment.
Dr. Butler appears to argue that because a Nightingale, in its wild
state, will eat a few berries {a) in the autumn for the sake of a change or
because it can get nothing better, therefore it ought to have, in captivitv,
as its regular food, a mixture which consists largely of bread. It would be
just as reasonable to contend that because a man can eat, without ill
effects, a little pastry occasionally, he might, with impunity, eat pastry for
breakfast, pastry for lunch, pastr}&amp;apos; for dinner, every day all the 3&amp;apos;ear round.
If a man were to try this, the result would almost certainly be a bad attack
of indigestion, especially if he took little exercise, and a similar result
follows when a caged Nightingale is fed largely on bread. Moreover,
there is a good deal of difference between bread and berries.
No doubt quite unintentionall}&amp;apos;, Dr. Butler somewhat misrepresents
what I said: I certainly never admitted that biscuit is &amp;quot;almost (if not
altogether) a suitable food for the more delicate insectivorous birds.&amp;quot;
Biscuit is no doubt better than bread, but really that is not saying much
for it.
I cannot understand Dr. Butler&amp;apos;s statement that Dr. Bradburn &amp;quot;was a
strong advocate for the use of chopped beef for soft-billed birds.&amp;quot; I believe
that the reverse of this would be much nearer the truth, and can only
conclude that Dr. Butler has never read &amp;quot; British Birds : their successful
management in captivity.&amp;quot; Nevertheless, there is a good deal more to be
said for the occasional use of meat for soft-billed birds than Dr. Butler will
admit.
I thought that Mr. Abrahams dealt almost entirely in foreign birds,
and that there were a good many &amp;quot;living authorities&amp;quot; with more experience
of British Warblers than he has.
Septimus Perkins.
Sir, -- Mr. Perkins writes as though mj^ sole object in recommendiii&amp;quot;&amp;apos;
bread for soft-billed birds was to prove him in the wrong : consequently he
gives one the impression that he is hurt. I can assure him that my sole
object is to arrive at the truth, and this (as I said before) can be best attained
by practical experience.
(a) These frequent references to tlie Nightingale eating berries surprise ine. I have
not myself ever observed either the wild or the captive Nightingale devour any vegetable
matter &amp;s/ooii. The captive bird occasionally takes a little vegetable matter for medicinal
purposes, just as the cat and the dog eat grass-- but I have not ever known one touch a
berry.-- R. P.
(a) I must admit that I never heard of the Nightingale eating berries until Mr,
Perkins made the statement ; but I suppose he has proof of its being a fact. -- A. G. B.

Nightingales warble but are not called &amp;quot; Warblers,&amp;quot; and most
assuredly the Chats are not : the Stonechat eats bread and thrives upon
it, so does the Whinchat ; the Redstart in my aviary would certainly die
without it, for he gets but little of the egg and ants&amp;apos;-cocoons in his mixture,
these being quickly appropriated by other birds ; yet he is in excellent
health and sings well : I have had him two years.
It was Mr. Perkins (aud not I) who hinted that there was some affinity
between bread and berries ; I, on the other hand, said that I failed to see
the point of his suggestion.
Dr. Bradburn, even in his Intioduclion, says : -- &amp;quot; Beef and mutton
(preferably the lean portions), sheep&amp;apos;s heart and liver, in the right place will
be found very useful, and in some instances indispensable.&amp;quot; If Mr,
Perkins will take the trouble to run through the suggestions for feeding
insectivorous birds in Dr. Bradburn&amp;apos;s little book, he will see that I have
certainly not underrated the late doctor&amp;apos;s high esteem for raw meat.
Lastly I would ask Mr. Perkins whether a foreign bird which
voluntarily visits England is more subject to indigestion than a foreign
bird which is imported into England ; because, if not, his statement
respecting Mr. Abrahams falls to the ground.

THE FOREIGN BIRD EXHIBITORS&amp;apos; LEAGUE.
A new Society with the above title has been founded to encourage the
exhibition of foreign birds and to improve shows in regard to them.
Thirty members have already joined, and a Council consisting of the
following gentlemen has been elected : -- Messrs. W. H. Betts, H. T. T.
Camps, J. F. Dewar, J. Frostick, J. B. Housden, R. Humphrys, N. H.Jones,
W. Osbaldeston, C. S. Simpson, J. Storej&amp;apos;, and W. Swaysland. I have been
elected Hon. Secretary and Treasurer.
The subscription is 2/6 per annum to members of the Avicultural
Societ}&amp;apos;, and 5/- to others. I shall be very pleased to receive the names of
any desirous of joining. The rules have not yet been drawn up, but this
will be done forthwith.
The objection has been made that the formation of a new Society was
unnecessar}&amp;apos;, and that its objects could have been just as well effected by a
special committee of the Avicultural Society. The answer to this is that the
Avicultural Society is, as a Society, unable to interfere usefully in Show
.questions, as the great majority not onl}&amp;apos; of the members but also of the
officers, are non-exhibitors. For the same reason it would be unfair to use
any part of the funds of the Society for any purpose connected with Shows.
It is the belief of its founders that the League supplies a long felt
want. The U.K. Foreign Cage Bird Society, which was amalgamated with
the Avicultural Society in 1895, was, to a large extent, a Society of
exhibitors -- since that Society ceased to have an independent existence
exhibitors of foreign birds have been without a Society of their own.

<bodyText confidence="0.9854155" page_id="32635574"  page_num="135" year="" vol="">
Sir, -- I liave thought it might be of interest to the members of our
Society to hear of an incident which has just occurred in my foreign bird-
room.
In the larger aviary I have had for some time a pair of Golden-
crowned New-Zealand Parrakeets {Cyanorhafnphus auriceps) ; and they have
neither interfered with each other nor with the other birds in the aviary.
Last week the hen was noticed to be slightly ailing, and she was
caught out for treatment. The cock expressed such anxiety at losing his
partner, who was lierself palpably anxious to get back to him, that it was
thought charitable to catch him also, and put him with the hen while she
was being treated.
As long as anyone was in the bird-room the birds seemed, perfectly
content to be vinited, and everything went on satisfactorily for the first
day. The next morning the hen was found dead in the cage, not from
the trifling ailment for which she had been &amp;quot; caged up,&amp;quot; but from having
been killed by the cock bird. The top of her skull was torn completely off.

GOULDIAN FINCHES.
Jkfr. Rotch having asked for information on the subject of the breeding of
Gouldian Finches, the following reply has been serit to him by Mr. Phillipps : --
I fear you maj- have difficulty in obtaining a hen of either the
Beautiful or of Gould&amp;apos;s Grassfinch just at present, and, should you be
successful, there would be little chance of the birds breeding until the end
of the year. The hurried account I wrote for Dr. Butler (see &amp;quot; Foreign
Finches&amp;quot;) gave a fair representation of the birds as they were at that time,
but those good days have passed away. They used to be brought over a
few at a time and with great care, and they reached this country in capital
condition. Now they are brought over in great numbers and crowded
together ; and they die off like flies, especially the females. Those that do
survive are not of the slightest use for breeding until they have been kept,
under favourable conditions, for a considerable time. Their breeding
season is during our autumn and winter ; and these modern birds, at any
rate with me, do not shew any inclination to breed at any other time.
When wishing to nest, the females become delicate if with, or within
hearing of, the males, and must be kept warm or inflammation of the
ovary may set in : warmth is the only preventive and cure. If you can get
a good pair, the}&amp;apos; will nest almost anywhere ; during cold weather,
however, I think a wooden box is about the best place. Dry grasses, or
even hay, is all that they require ; neither species will use moss, wool,
feathers, or anything of that nature.
It is said that these birds {Poephila mirabilis and P. gouldice) are bred
largely in captivity in Australia for exportation. Possibly this may have
something or much to do with the want of stamina in those specimens
which now reach our shores.

THE PRICES OF FOREIGN BIRDS ; THE SONGS OF
FOREIGN BIRDS.

<bodyText confidence="0.997419617647059" page_id="32635575"  page_num="136" year="" vol="">
Sir, -- I should be glad if some experienced aviculturist (in next
month&amp;apos;s Magazine, or the month after, now foreign birds are getting
plentiful) would issue a list of the present market value of healthy
specimens of the different species of foreign birds, stating their relative
merits as songsters, whether good, bad, or indifferent. I have just been
much disappointed with a Pekin Robin -- I find his song is not nearly as
good as that of our English Robin, although it is described by one of
the dealers as equal to that of the Blackcap or ordinary Nightingale ;
and the Virginian Nightingale, so-called, has nothing of a song, and
yet the dealers describe him as a beautiful whistler.
I have gained much valuable information from the Avicultural
Magazine, and I hope to gain a great deal more.
A. Jones.
The following reply was sent to Mr. Jones : --
It is quite impossible to compl}&amp;apos; with your request. The prices of
birds vary from day to day, and are governed, like the prices of other
commodities, by the laws of supply and demand. By watching the dealers&amp;apos;
advertisements a fair idea of the current price of the commoner species can
be formed -- there is no regular price for the rarer birds. The Shania and the
Pekin Robin are generally considered to be about the best songsters among
the insectivorous foreign birds, and the Grey-singing Finch and the Alario
Finch the best among the foreign seed-eaters. But the respective merits of
songsters is largelj^ a matter of opinion, and individuals of the same species
differ greatly. I should say that the average Pekin Robin is a better songster
than the average English Robin, though not so good as the Nightingale
or Blackcap, but this is only my personal opinion {a). I have never heard a
Virginian Cardinal which could be called a fine songster -- the song of that
bird appears to me monotonous and tiresome -- still, I should give it a fairly
high place among foreign birds, as most of them are still worse performers.
Horatio R. Fii,i,mer.
(n) I have had a good many pairs of this species : as a rule the males sing-
magnificently (quite as well as any Blackcap) ; but occasionally a poor songster comes
to hand. One wliich I parted with last year sang only seven notes, which may be thus
expressed tjtr-te-rur-itir ; tur-tui-tnr. -- A. G. B.

In responding to Mr. St Quintin&amp;apos;s invitation to say a few
words about the breeding of the Shama, I may commence by
remarking that I have always a certain number of large,
often rapacious, birds-- formerlj^ I had a great many -- and that,
as my space is verj&amp;apos; limited, breeding with me has been almost
an impossibility, and rarelj^ attempted except when the birds
insisted upon tempting their fate. Moreover, my outdoor
aviary, although provided with plent}^ of shelters, is simpl)&amp;apos;- a
little walled-in garden (an ordinary cats&amp;apos; playground) covered
over with wire netting to a height of over nine feet, so that the
inmates and their nests are much exposed to the weather ; for
most birds in a natural garden-aviary will roost and build in the
shrubs, and rarely will take to artificial nesting - places or
structures (see, for instance, &amp;quot; How the Birds learn.&amp;quot; Vol. III.
p. 174). Again, strange as it may seem, I could hardly obtain
such a creature as a mealworm, and the few I did obtain only at
fancy prices. And I was commonly absent from home from
morning till night, the birds being left pretty much to take
care of themselves, so that m}^ experiences in this particular
direction have been incomplete.
Some of the Mynahs used to nest very freely; the most
energetic and persevering were a male Acridotheres cristatellus 2iW^
a female A. tristis ; many eggs were laid, and mostly stolen by the
male, but a few young were hatched and partially reared.
Artificial food only was supplied, with which the parents were
dissatisfied ; mealworms and cockroaches would have saved the
young. But the nest of all others I look back upon with sorrow
and regret contained four as strong young White Jackdaws as
ever were hatched. The male, who stole the first &amp;^% as soon as
laid, had been removed, and the female would not feed the young
on artificial food. I can still hear her voice as I opened a window

looking on to tlie aviary before starting to the city ; she asked
me for food for her babes in a pathetic and reproachful tone ;
but I gave her nothing to her liking and the young died of
starvation.
I am satisfied that the White Jackdaw is not an albino,
nor an artificial production like the White Java Sparrow, but a
distinct variety or race which breeds true to colour coming from
the Continent ; but I have not been able to ascertain the locality
whence those annually imported acftually come. Of course
mealworms, cockroaches, etc., would have saved these birds, and
the plumage would have settled the question. Several times with
birds I have had an opportunity which I have failed to avail
myself of, and the opportunity has never been offered again -- a
warning to my fellow-aviculturists. In succeeding years the
female Jackdaw would never allow the male to approach her
(one year she mated with a Chough, but the eggs were not
fertile) ; and I have had other instances where brother and sister
obtained a divorce : -- was this accident, or a natural instinct to
avoid inbreeding and a degenerate progeny ?
The female Shama is now a common bird in this country,
but years ago it was as fabulous as the Roc, and many were the
mysterious reasons given for its non-appearance. I may mention,
in connection with the food question now being discussed in our
pages, that my first female died in a fit owing to the special food
I used to have prepared for my birds not having been sufficiently
cooked. I have long since ceased to give a servant an oppor-
tunity of killing my birds by negligence. My next female I
imported direct from Calcutta. A pair of Shanias were sent over,
but the male disappeared shortly before the steamer entered the
Thames. According to the official report, it was killed by the
rats. I examined the cage, and found that the rats could not
possibly have got hold of it. A sovereign was to have been paid
to the butcher, the caretaker of all birds and beasts on board
ship, for each bird received alive ; but somebod}^ had evidently
offered more than the sovereign, and so the butcher let the
&amp;quot;rats&amp;quot; have it. I mention this as there seems to be strong
evidence that this is not an uncommon occurrence when rare
birds are imported unaccompanied by a responsible person.
However, the despised female, of course the one I valued most,
arrived safely on September 29th, 1892. On April 26th following,
this bird, who was shut up separately from a male, but in the
same bird-room, commenced carrying hay about. On May 5th
it was clear that the birds wanted to pair, when, on the following

<bodyText confidence="0.999142340909091" page_id="32635578"  page_num="139" year="" vol="">
morning, a sad calamity occurred. The male chanced to fly on
to the front of his house when the old Chinese Blue Pie, a very
spiteful bird, who still survives, darted down and tore off the
centre toe of the left foot. Later in the month, the birds were
introduced to the garden, and, on the 19th, both were set free.
The male&amp;apos;s delight was unbounded ; and right bravely did he
disport himself before the lady of his love, but his bad foot
rather quickly cooled his ardour. As evening drew on, he went
to roost in a balsam poplar close to the side of the aviary, the
female not being far off. In the night I was awakened by one of
the most painful sounds I know, the cry as of a bird in the talons
of a hawk. With more speed than clothes, I rushed out. A cat
had climbed up the outside of the aviary, and the male, after the
unfortunate manner of birds in real or fancied peril, had flown
on to the wire netting. Years previously, however, I had learned
by bitter experience that a single wire is practically useless as a
protection against cats. The wires were double, and some three
inches apart, one being of one-half inch mesh. As an additional
safeguard, the aviary was and is surrounded by a cat&amp;apos;s-claw
protection ; and up to this point the cat had climbed, but higher
it could not go. So the Shama, although within a foot of the
cat, was safe ; the horrid eager look of the beast I can picture to
myself now, as it strained itself against the wire between me
and the sky ; and the poor bird was paralysed with terror. I
carried both of the Shamas back to the house, placing them in
the male&amp;apos;s old home which would be familiar to his eye, -- but he
lay on the ground all night in an almost helpless condition.
When are our legislators going to mete out justice in the matter
of cats ! Why should there be one law for the cat-owner and
another for the aviculturist ? What justice or reason is there in
allowing people to let their cats loose to trespass in other
persons&amp;apos; gardens and feed on their pets ? They should be
required to keep their cats within their own domains or to
take the consequences.
As soon as the birds had recovered from the shock, once
more they were placed in the garden, and, more wise than before,
they roosted in safe places and were disturbed no more. Several
times the female commenced to build ; but the cold weather
seemed to cause much pain in the male&amp;apos;s foot, or perhaps he had
not recovered from the cat scare ; anyway he was not responsive,
and the nesting was again and again discontinued. The place
selected was on a shelf nearly four feet from the ground, running
along under a shed. It transpired afterwards that two nests
were built, about two feet apart, in different partitions of the

<bodyText confidence="0.998315159090909" page_id="32635579"  page_num="140" year="" vol="">
same shelf. In building, the plucky little woman, who seemed
fully to understand that her mate was bad -- a state of affairs
which seldom fails to bring out the best qualities in the sex --
carried at first only dead leaves, chiefly ivy and euonymus, the
other available dead leaves being those of the rhododendrons,
which she would not touch ; she also took up straw and ha}^
finally lining the second nest with the finest ha}^ ; moss, hair,
etc., she would not look at. The foundations of the nests were
very large ; Robins&amp;apos; and Redstarts&amp;apos; nests are often built on the
same plan. In some respects, perhaps, it was more like to the
nest of the Nightingale than to that of any other British bird-
While all this was going on, the male looked on approvingly, sang
occasionally, and from time to time made miserable the lives of
an Australian Black-breasted Peewit, another very old friend who
still enjoys the best of health, and a common L,apwing, the only
other occupants of the aviary, who eventually had to be removed.
Judging from appeai&amp;apos;ances, for I kept away from the nest, the
first egg was laid on 6th June, 1893, and the female commenced
to sit on the 9th, on four eggs as transpired later.
On June 2otli I noticed the female fly across the aviary
from her nest with something in her bill ; the male immediately
darted at her and seized the &amp;quot; something,&amp;quot; and a tug-of-war
ensued. This &amp;quot; something&amp;quot; turned out to be the first-born ; the
excited mother had by an accident carried out the nestling along
with the shell, and it was forthwith torn to pieces between the
two birds and, if I recollect rightly, devoured by them. Twice
again that day and once on the following morning did the female
fly across the aviary to the same spot bearing the discarded
shells. For the first few days the young were fed by the female,
later by the male also. Not only did the parents refuse to carry
artificial food of any kind to the young, but, as is too often the
case, they themselves wholly gave up eating artificial food ; and
this circumstance adds greatly to the difficulty of rearing a
brood of insectivorous birds. It is impossible for me to obtain
insects here in London, and the young Shamas were reared
on cockroaches, mealworms, and gentles. I tried to breed
&amp;quot;jumpers&amp;quot; in cheese, but they were not appreciated. The
gentles I discontinued after a time, as they seemed to be more
heating than the mealworms. At first small cockroaches were
taken to the nest from preference, but later the mealworms were
preferred. Unfortunately I could obtain but a very limited
supply of cockroaches, and had to rely mainly on mealworms.
The gentles and mealworms I placed in bran, in large open
saucers over a foot in diameter.

The tliree surviving young left the nest on 2nd July, well
feathered but unable to fly. The noise the two old birds made
that day was astounding, the female mad to entice the young
away from the adjoining aviary and its rapacious occupants
(a Hunting Cissa being especially desirous of &amp;quot; assisting &amp;quot; the
mother), while the male, on the highest perch, whistled defiance
at the world. The more he whistled, the more the neighbours
crowded into the gardens around (it happened to be Sunday) ;
and the more they came the more the bird whistled and sang.
In feeding the young, excepting quite at first, the parents
would not be bothered with carrying ^;;z(3;// creatures to their nest ;
these they swallowed, and carried only the larger ones. If I
persisted in supplying only small mealworms or cockroaches,
ihey would not budge until they had collected several of these
in their bills. The enormous cockroaches which I saw that
female Shama give to her young after they had left their nest
would have convinced me, if I had had need of convincing, of
the needlessness of cutting up mealworms to give to young
birds. The mouth of the young bird while being fed was like
the vortex of a whirlpool. The female would endeavour to tilt
a big cockroach head foremost into the open mouth : if success-
ful, it was caught in the vortex and disappeared in a twinkling ;
but if the insect happened to get crossways or was not caught
fairly in the vortex, it flew off at a tangent, and the performance
had to be gone through again.
I supplied the mealworms, etc., alive and uninjured,
leaving it to the parents to kill them, which they did not always
\0x25A0do by any means.
One reads that the parent Eagle shoves its young out of
the eyrie on the sides of the precipice, and then darts under the
falling bird for the purpose of supporting it in the air. This is
sometimes regarded as a pretty story and nothing more. Story
or no story as regards the Eagle, I can say that, as regards the
Shama, on the day the young left the nest, I saw the female
*several times, when trying to get them on to perches in a shrub,
ily under them and give them a partial back-up.
Until the young left the nest, the parents kept up the
delusion that I did not know anything about it. They never
went straight to the nest, but every morsel of food was carried
round the best part of three sides of the aviary, almost precisely
hy the same route, a pause usually being made at two points,
and again just below the nest. When the male, who usually
performed the office, carried off the excreta, he flew zig-zag

hither and thither all over the place, dropping them at the
farthest possible point.
I need now only add that more delightful pets than these
young Shanias could not be, flying after me everywhere, and
perching on me anywhere they could find a footing.
PHEASANTS.
By D. Seth-Smith.
f Co7ifinued from page i^oj.
In aviaries. Reeve&amp;apos;s Pheasants become very tame and
familiar with those who habitually feed them. The hens lay
freely, and the eggs can be hatched under domestic hens, and
the young reared quite as easily as those of any of the other
Pheasants. Considering that a full grown cock of this species
carries a tail some five feet in length, the aviary in which these
birds are kept cannot very well be too large.
The genus Calophasis possesses but two species, Elliot&amp;apos;s
(C. ellioti) and Hume&amp;apos;s (C huinicB) ; the latter is unknown in
Kurope in a living state, but the former has, within the last few
years, been imported in some numbers, and has been bred by
amateurs, as well as at the &amp;quot; Zoo.&amp;quot; KHiot&amp;apos;s Pheasant is
indigenous to the province of Che-kiang, where it w^as discovered
by Consul Swinhoe, and was first brought to Kurope in 1879 by
Mr. Jamrach. In shape and manners this bird closely resembles
the true Pheasants, but it differs greatly in the form of its mark-
ings. In the male, the mantle, wings and breast are of a rich
bronze-red ; a band of purplish steel and two bands of pure
white cross the wings ; the underparts being chiefly pure
white, and the throat black.
The genus Chrysolophzis contains but two species, both of
which are of exceptional beauty and deservedly popular with
Pheasant keepers. The Golden Pheasant {C.pictus) is almost as
well known as the Common Pheasant, having been bred in
captivity in Europe from a very remote period. Its general
appearance is too familiar to need a detailed description here,
the rich red, gold and green of its plumage making it the most
gorgeous of all the known Pheasants. My experience of this
species is that the males are often exceedingly spiteful towards the
females, but this, alas, is a failing which most Pheasants sometimes
possess in captivity. I^ady Amherst&amp;apos;s Pheasant (C amherstice) is

now fairly well known and easily obtainable in the Knglish
market, having been bred by numerous amateurs. It is slightly
larger than its congener and very different in colouring, the crest
being deep red, the mantle and breast metallic green, and the
underparts chiefly pure white. The tippet on the nape is com-
posed of feathers of pure white margined with black. This very
lovely Pheasant is indigenous to the mountainous districts of
Western China. In suitable aviaries Amhersts thrive well and
the young are said to present no especial difficulty in the matter
of rearing, but they do not attain their full plumage until nearly
two years of age, differing in this respect from the true Pheasants.
The two species of this genus interbreed very freely in captivity,,
and the resulting hybrids, which are said to be perfectly fertile,
are remarkably handsome birds, combining the rich colourings
of both species.
The Silver and Swinhoe&amp;apos;s Pheasants belong to the rather
large family of Kalij Pheasants, -- the genus Ge?misiis. G.
nycthe7nerus, the common Silver Pheasant, has been known for
a very long time as an aviary bird. Its colours may be roughly
described as white, finely pencilled with black, above, including
the tail, and black on the underparts. This is a very hardy
species, and breeds very freely in captivity. It is found wild
in the south of China, but is said to be becoming very rare
there. G. stvinhoii is a handsome species, the male having a
white crest and mantle, the centre pair of tail feathers being
of the same colour. The rest of the body is bluish black
relieved by crimson on the scapulars. It is not a common
bird in the English market, and is found in a wild state on
the forest-clad mountains of Formosa.
The foregoing notes have already occupied too much
space, and I must stop. I would, however, just mention the
Moonal Pheasant of the Himalayas (Lophophorus refulgens),
whose gorgeous plumage no artist can truthfully depict ; the
Peacock Pheasant (JPolyplectron chinquis), the Firebacks, and the
Tragopans. All are well worthy the attention of our members,,
and let me express the hope that before long we may hear of the
successful rearing, by members of the Avicultural Society, of
some of the rare and lovely species of the Phasia7iidce.

A VISIT TO &amp;quot; BROOKLYN.&amp;quot;
By the Hon. and Rev. F. &amp;apos;G. Button.
I was enabled the other day, through the kindness of Mr.
Fulljames, to see his Parrot-room, and, as his collection is a
singularl}^ interesting one, I thought a few words about it might
be welcome to the readers of the Aviculhiral Magazine.
One thing that rather astonished me, in making my
appointment with Mr. Fulljames, was to learn that he was only
at home after 6 p.m. except on Sundays. I knew he bought
largely, but since he could hardly see much of his birds, I was
at a loss to understand what attraction they could have for him.
He met me at Balham station, and as we walked up to his house
I asked him plainly what his interest in the birds was. He told
me quite simply that his object was excellence as a collection.
His interest was exhibiting. As a former exhibitor of fowls
myself, and as one who occasionally shows dogs now, I under-
stood, and could sympathize at once. But it is necessary to say
this that my readers may understand what I could not get from
Mr. Fulljames himself. I could not get much account of the ways
and habits of his Parrots. He devotes himself to their health
and condition, not to the study of their characters. For that
one must go to the lad}^ who keeps house for Mr. Fulljames --
*&amp;apos;for,&amp;quot; said he, &amp;quot;it would not be possible for me to keep the birds
I do, unless my housekeeper took a great interest in them.&amp;quot;
He ought to have a gold medal for being such a plucky
buyer. Were there a few more able and willing to do as he
does, what rare birds might we not see imported !
But before I went to the living birds, I was shown a case
containing some two hundred stuffed Humming Birds. Cases of
Humming Birds, my readers may say, are not very uncommon.
Perhaps not, but have they ever seen a nest oi young Humming
Birds ? I must confess that I never have. Yet here were two :
one with the young just ready to fly ; the other with young
three or four da5^s old. These latter were rather parchmenty,
owing to the drying up of the tender skin, but one felt that one
knew something appreciably more about Humming Birds after
seeing them.
I was then taken to the room containing the British birds,
but as my object was the Parrots we did not stop there long, but
went upstairs to the Parrot-room. It is not a very large room,
but it would be very difficult to find a collection of rarer Parrots
</bodyText>

<bodyText confidence="0.999023636363636" page_id="32635584"  page_num="145" year="" vol="">
in the same space. The room is scrupulously clean, and has
plenty of light. The cages are sensible, and I had but one
criticism to make -- I thought it too hot. There was a stove
burning, and no window open. Of course an open window
could not be expected at 6.30 p.m., but I do not think a stove
was desirable on the third of May. If I had one, I should have
Tobin&amp;apos;s system of ventilation going on. Parrots do not require
great heat ; and the only time they suffer from cold is when they
are moulting in September and on the very severe da3^s of winter,
Then I think they like artificial warmth. Parrots, however, are
different in their powers of enduring heat.
The first bird I looked at was the Hyacinthine Macaw. He
evidently did not mind the heat, for he was in the pink of bloom
-- I do not think I have ever seen a Macaw with such a sheen on
his plumage. This was the bird which Mr. FuUjames said, in a
previous number, was not good-tempered. I hardly agree. The
bird is devoted to Mrs. S. (as I will call the lady who looks after
them), and I think his devotion to her is the cause of his
warning off other people. I think he would always be good to
his feeder. However, one has to be careful of such a tremendous
beak. He had twisted about the wires of his cage in all
directions. The next bird to him was the Shining Parrakeet,
\0x25A0claimed by Mr. Fulljames at the last Palace Show. This bird is
quite thrown away where he is -- he is full of antics, and evidently
wanted a great deal of play and petting. He ought to be with
some one whose &amp;quot;only joy&amp;quot; he should be. After him came a
Meyer&amp;apos;s. This bird was in admirable condition, but not as tame
as those deposited at the Zoological Gardens some three or four
years back -- they were charming -- pocket companions, I might
\0x25A0call them, but this one was as much where he ought to be, as the
Shining Parrakeet was where he ought not to be -- nothing was
wasted in keeping him for exhibition purposes only. Then
there were two Antipodes Island Parrakeets, (^Cyanorhamphus
ufiicolo?&amp;apos;&amp;apos;). I thought the Zoo. alone had a specimen of this
very rare Parrot, but found, to my surprise, Mr. Fulljames with
two. Alas, both cocks ! Had they not been, I think I must
have asked Mr. Fulljames to let me try and breed some for him.
Next to them were a pair of Blue Bonnets, Then a lyineolated
Parrakeet. This, my host thought, might come near to my
ideal pet. It is pretty, if not gorgeous, and quiet ; but I should
doubt its capacit)&amp;apos; for talking. Considering that they have been
brought over in some numbers at different times, I rather
wonder we have not heard more about them as cage-birds. I
have never had any myself, because my space is limited, and there

have always been other [birds I have wanted more -- but they
would be an agreeable change from Budgerigars, if they would
breed as readily. The one bird at &amp;quot; Brooklyn,&amp;quot; which I do not feel
sure I have ever seen before, was the Blood-stained Cockatoo.
This must be Bechstein&amp;apos;s Cockatoo (C. philippiiiariini) (a) of
which he says the cry is very disagreeable. But Mr. Fulljames
says it is quiet. It is quite the smallest Cockatoo I have seen..
Not far from it stood Pionus chalcopterus -- the Bronze-winged
Parrot. He is a very tame little bird ; but the Piojii, as a rule,
are tame, yet they can occasionally give a nip, as this one alsO&amp;apos;
does. And they take their dislikes, too. A hen Menstruus I had
was very good with me, but hated one of our under-keepers, and
would always bite him if he could. Mr. Fulljames had also a
hen Menstruus , but it did not seem specially tame.
In the window stood several Australian Parrakeets, but
amongst the Australians there was nothing, with the exception
of one, which was either a Variegated Rosella or a hybrid, to call
for special note. A Forsten&amp;apos;s lyorikeet, a Scaly-breasted Lorikeet,,
a Crimson-wing, a Rock Peplar, a King, and a cock Barraband.
were amongst the number. In mentioning the birds on the oppo-
site side of the room, I forgot to say that there was a hen Malabar,
which was the only representative of the genus PalcBornis in the
collection. There were no Conures ; Mr. Fulljames, I was
interested to find, quite sharing my feelings about them. I was
disappointed at missing the Microglossus -- which had been sent
to the Alexandra Palace to try and forget feather picking in a
large aviary. The Gangas had been sold at the Crystal Palace
Show. Even Mrs. S. had not a good word to say for them. Her
experience was what mine has been, that they were morose
creatures, and not very willing to make friends. I may be going
to change my opinion-- but of that more another day.
I have left, for the last two notes, the gems of the collection,
and the most interesting bird in it.
The gems were a pair of Princess of Wales Parrakeets-
{Polytelis alexa^idrcB). I had seen the bird before at the
Zoological Gardens, but never in such plumage as these. Not
only were the colours of these -- the yellow-green of the wings
and the delicate rose of the throat -- most vivid, but their tails-
were of a length I have never seen in an}^ species of the family.
I have never seen even a Barraband, or a Rock Peplar, with such
tails. And then, they were delightfully tame, coming up to the
bars of the cage to be noticed, and piping with a loud clear pipe
(a). The Cacatua haematuropygia of the Cat. Birds Brit. Mus.-- R. P.

to draw attention when we turned away -- as pets, it, perhaps,
was their one drawback. That pipe might have got upon one&amp;apos;s
nerves. They were said to have been taken from the nest, and
brought over as pets, by the man who sold them to Mr. Jamrach,
from whom Mr. Fulljames bought them. They did the importer
the greatest credit.
I have some reason to hope that their owner is going to
devote a large aviary in another room to these lovel}^ birds, to
induce them to breed. It was, at the time of my visit, inhabited
by a Cinnamon Blackbird and &amp;quot;Jacob,&amp;quot; the talking Starling (not
that he favoured me with any conversation), both of whom might
very well make way for the Parrakeets. It would be a great
feather in anyone&amp;apos;s cap to have a nest of young AlexaJidrczs.
Lastl}^, the most interesting bird was the Spix Macaw.
The most interesting, because it is clearly a bab}&amp;apos;, and now,
owing to Mr. Fulljames&amp;apos; kindness, I can tell my readers what
they will not find, as far as I know, in any book -- that the young
bird has every feather on the back edged with black, entirely un-
like the even grey-blue of the adult. It was very tame and gentle,
but not, as regards plumage, in the best of condition. I never
can see a bird in rough plumage, without longing to get it right.
And so it was arranged between Mr. Fulljames and myself that I
should have the Spix at Bibury, and try what a little outdoor life
might do for it. Had our plan come off, I might have had more to
say hereafter about the Spix Macaw as a pet. But I had reckoned
without Mrs. S. When she was told of the plan, she showed so
much reludtance to the Spix going out of her keeping that I
withdrew my proposal. It is not fair to those who have the
trouble of our birds to disregard their feelings about their
charges.
With this ends the account of my very pleasant visit. I
write it in the hope that it may not be altogether uninteresting
to my readers, but that the bare account should be as interesting
to them as the visit was to me is not to be expected.
P.S. -- I should perhaps say that, though I think the heat
of the Parrot-room was too much for Australian Parrots, it is
not the heat I so much objedl to as the want of oxygen. My
Nymphicus cornutus, which is out of doors and comes from a
hot climate, has exadtly the sheen of Mr. Fulljames&amp;apos; Hyacinthine
Macaw.

Notes by the Rev. Hubert D. Asti^ky.
In India this Dhyal Bird is found in every part of the
Empire, and is a resident of Ceylon and Southern China.
When a lady saw the male bird that I once kept in a cage for a
few years, she immediately recognised it as a species of bird that
as a child she had often seen hopping about in the gardens of
Penang. (I think Penang was the place named by her).
Those that are brought over in captivity invariably seem
to be extremely tame, and many are bold enough lo attack one&amp;apos;s
fingers when placed to the bars of the cage. Dhyal birds are, I
believe, favourite cage-pets amongst the Chinese gentry, who, as
they do with other birds, carr}^ them about with them in small
cane cages in order to enjoy their company and their song. As
to the latter, the Dhyal bird, although related very closely to the
Indian Shama, cannot sing so melodiously ; for its notes, in my
opinion, are harsher and wanting in variety ; still, he is a good
songster and a gay one.
Mr. L,ydekker describes the adult male as follows : --
&amp;quot;Head, neck, breast, and upper-parts glossy black, the wings
and tail are black, varied with white ; and the abdomen and
under tail-coverts white. The female has the upper-parts of
an uniform dark brown glossed with bluish ; the throat and
breast dark grey ; and the wings and tail dark brown varied
with white.&amp;quot; The male Dhyal bird might well be roughly
described as a miniature Magpie. In size he is rather larger
than a Shama, although the tail is not nearly so long.
A very delightful cage-bird,, bold and happy in disposition,
and seemingly not difiicult to keep in health, eating any good
mixture of food for insectivorous birds, with the usual addition
of mealworms, raw beef, and fruit, etc.
My bird would perch on my hand, pecking most pug-
naciously at my fingers, puffing out his feathers and singing
sotto voce.
Probabl}^ a pair of Dhyal birds would nest in an outdoor
aviary, where they might have a chance of catching insects,
which could be attracted within the wire by a piece of meat
hung up. Gentles could be supplied by such means, and might
serve for the constant demand made by insectivorous birds when
they have young in the nest.

It is too aggravating to lose broods of Shamas, etc., for
want of proper food.
Dhyal birds build in boles of trees, or crevices of walls,
and consequently a tempting nesting-place could be easily given
in an aviary.
There is another species in the Philippine Islands (Cc"/&amp;apos;-
sychus 7nindane7isis), and yet another inhabiting Madagascar
{C. albospecularis) (a) whose song is said to be very superior.

Sir, -- I am sorry that Dr. Eutler thinks that I am hurt : I should be
very unreasonable if I were to allow myself to feel hurt by the remarks of
such a courteous antagonist. I fully recognise that his &amp;quot; sole object is to
arrive at the truth,&amp;quot; and I am sure he will admit that mine is the same.
I did not think that anyone would question the fact of the Nightin-
gale eating berries. If I simply give my own personal experience I shall
perhaps be suspected of faulty observation or defective memory, so I will \0x25A0
refer my critics to Howard Saunders&amp;apos; Manual of British Birds, 2nd. Ed.,
page 40, where they will find it stated that &amp;quot;the adults live on worms,
insects, ants&amp;apos;-eggs, fruit and berries, especially those of the elder.&amp;quot; (^&amp;gt;)
I used the term &amp;quot; English Warbler,&amp;quot; in a rough popular sense, for all
the small insectivorous British species for which there seems to be no com-
prehensive name. I really think that the Nightingale and the Chats may,
in that sense, be called Warblers with no more impropriety than Waxbills
and Weavers are called Foreign Finches. Indeed, in &amp;quot; Foreign Finches in
Captivity,&amp;quot; Dr. Butler goes so far as to include the Tanagers under the term
&amp;quot;Finch.&amp;quot; If a Tanager may be called a Finch, surely a Nightingale may
be called a Warbler. And the ornithologists are not agreed among them-
selves, for Professor Newton includes the RuticillincB in the Sylviidce. The
whole point, however, has nothing to do with the present discussion.
I am sorr}&amp;apos; that I feel bound to repeat that, in my opinion, Dr. Butler
absolutely misrepresents the drift of Dr. Bradburn&amp;apos;s teaching on the subject
of raw meat for birds. In the quotation he gives, observe the words &amp;quot; in
the right place.&amp;quot; A careful perusal of &amp;quot; British Birds : their successful
management in captivity &amp;quot; will show that by &amp;quot; the right place&amp;quot; the author
did not mean daily or regular use. This, however, is a plain question of
fact, upon which everyone can satisfy himself, and if this dispute intro-
duces some readers of the Avicidtural Magazine to Dr. Bradburn&amp;apos;s book it
will not have been wholly useless.
(a). The Gervaisia albospecularis of the Brit. Mus. Catalogfue. In this Catalogue
another species is given, Copsychus seychellariim, from the Seychelles. -- R.P.
{b). It may be questioned whether Howard Saunders speaks from experience : I have
tried my present male with banana but it will not even touch it. -- A. G. B.
Mr. Swaysland informs us that he has known the Nightingale (both wild and caged)
to eat elder berries, and also black currants. Many birds, undoubtedly frugivorous, will
refuse banana, although greedily fond of some other fruits. -- I5d.

If Dr. Butler supposes that I make an arbitrary and unscientific
distinction between British and foreign birds, and assume that they need
different treatment, he is mistaken. But he knows, even better than I do,
that ninety-nine out of every hundred of the smaller foreign soft-billed birds
imported into this country are totally different feeders from the Nightingale.
The Nightingale, Redstart, Wheatear, and Whinchat are almost exclusively
insectivorous, but with the exception of the Red-sided Tit and the Blue-
throated Warbler (both very uncommon) I cannot at this moment recall any
small foreign soft-billed birds that I have ever seen in captivity in England
of which the same can be said : they are, on the contrary, nearly all fruit-
eaters, and, therefore, much easier to cater for.
Septimus Perkins.
Sir,-- Mr. Septimus Perkins&amp;apos; quotation does not interest me. Can he
state that he has himself actually seen a wild Nightingale take fruit or
berries ? The Nightingale was a rare bird (only one sure nesting-place each
year within two miles of the house) in the county in which I passed twenty
years, the greater part of my country life, and I cannot say, and did not
say, that the wild bird does 7zoi take either or both, but am, at present,
strongly of opinion that it does not.
As regards the captive Nightingale, for many years past I have kept
it pretty regularly (I have two now), wild-caught birds and hand-reared,
English and German, in the house and in the garden, in cages and flying
loose, but I have never seen one touch either fruit or berry, although most
of them have had constant opportunities.
Just like the Sliama, I have found the Nightingale with me to be
wholly insectivorous, but occasionally taking a portion of a fading, not a
dry, leaf, or a whole euonymus leaf, for medicinal purposes.
But Nightingales under different conditions may act differently ; and
I can readily iinderstand that a specimeUjkept in a cage on the monotonous
food, so often recommended, of ants&amp;apos;-cocoons with a few mealworms, might
be glad to swallow anything for the sake of a change. Nevertheless, this
would not necessarily indicate the true nature of the bird ; and I shall be
glad to hear of Mr. Perkins&amp;apos; personal experiences of the wild Nightingale in
this connection -- but no more quotations, please.
REGinaIvD Phii^lipps.
Sir, -- As there has been so much correspondence in the Magazine
re food and treatment of Nightingales, I have written to a gentleman at
Torquay who I knew had a Nightingale which has been in his possession a
long time, asking him to give particulars of his feeding and treatment, and
I enclose his reply, which I think may be of interest to many of our
members, if you care to publish it in the Magazine.

had.
Everyone is surprised when I tell them I had him on the 6th Sept.,
1890 -- nearly eight years ago -- and his song is more powerful now than ever.
My course of feeding is, in the morning about two teaspoonsful of
your food mixed with a little bread-crumb and scraped carrot or swede-
turnip -- carrot for preference -- and four mealworms ; then at midday, a little
raw beef, scraped ; a few spiders if he seems a little seedy ; a rusty nail in
his water, and a little saffron when in the moult.
He enjoys a bath now and then, and when he does not bathe I always
see that his feet are kept clean.

MAGPIES.
Sir,-- I should be nmch obliged to any member of the Council who
would give me some information about keeping and feeding Magpies in
captivitJ^
Would it be better to have only one, or a pair.?
I have a shed with weather-proof roof and wire front, which I think
would be a comfortable home for a bird of this kind, or for a pair if they
would be happier. I was obliged to give up keeping small birds in it, as
the mice, and sometimes rats, persisted in visiting them, and although,
strange to say, they did no harm to the birds, I was afraid they might do so.
Would it be necessary to have anything done to keep out rats and
mice supposing I had Mkgpies ? There is no floor to the shed, it is only
gravelled. E. E. WEST.
The following reply was sent to Miss West.
You do not give the size of your shed, but if it is fairly large -- say
10 or 12 feet square -- a pair of Magpies ought to get on well enough, if
properly attended to. If it is much smaller, however, it would be best to
keep one bird only, as two might fight. If you keep two together, it would
be best to have a true pair, as they might disagree if both of the same sex.
With regard to food. Magpies are practically omnivorous : meat,
grain, vegetables, and fruit being readily eaten ; while their partialit)^ to
eggs and young birds has caused the death of countless numbers at the
hands of game preservers. In captivit)&amp;apos;, therefore, they are very easily
catered for ; all scraps from the table should be collected and given to them,
and soaked dog-biscuit will be found useful. Magpies are very fond of
bathing, and a plentiful supply of clean water should be provided for the
purpose in a shallow trough. When reared from the nest they make
delightful pets and are most tame and amusing, and I don&amp;apos;t see why a pair
suitably housed should not nest in captivity.
Rats should certainly be kept away, and I should strongly advise you
to have a thin floor of concrete -- say 3 inches -- put down, if you are
(a). Mr. Arthur&amp;apos;s Food appears to be very similar to that made by Mr. Abrahams.
All such foods contain a good deal of preserved egg, and some ants&amp;apos; eggs -- fastidious
feeders like Nightingales pick out the egg and ants&amp;apos; eggs and leave nearly all the rest-- at
least, that is my experience. -- H. R. F.

troubled with these destructive rodeuts ; but mice would uot so much
matter, and, if they should show themselves in the day time, would
probably form part of the Magpies&amp;apos; food.
Some game-keepers make quite a harvest by the sale of young^
Magpies, and you will probably have no difficulty in obtaining a couple
next month. If you can have a choice out of a nest of j^oung birds, I
should advise 3-ou to pick out the largest and the smallest, providing the
latter is a healthy bird. You would then be most likel}&amp;apos; to have a
true pair. Of course it would not do to keep any small birds with them.

THE &amp;quot; IDEAL &amp;quot; PARROT.
Sir, -- I have read with interest the description given b}^ the Hon.
and Rev. F. G. Button of the ideal pet Parrot, because I think I may claim
to have been the possessor of a bird which had all the characteristics that
Mr. Button considers essential, size only excepted.
He was an Alexandrine, and as tame as it is possible for a bird to be.
He never refused to go to anj&amp;apos; human being at first sight, and indeed was
never really happy unless sitting on someone&amp;apos;s shoulder or wrist. He greatly
preferred men to women, and to some men in particular he showed the most
demonstrative affection, positively refusing to come away from them, and
sometimes flying back when he had been removed from them. He would
allow me to do anything with him, even to putting him in a basin and
washing him ; and he habitually sat on my lap or on my foot, close to the
fire and beside the cat, which animal was devoted to him. He never made
any unpleasant noises, and during nearly three years was never heard to
scream, and never bit anyone. I gave him the name of &amp;quot;Tony,&amp;quot; and he
soon knew his name, although for years he had been called &amp;quot; Polly.&amp;quot;
As an instance of his intelligence, I may relate that, one evening after
everyone had gone to bed, I heard &amp;quot;Tony&amp;quot; giving the little cry which he
usually made when he wanted attention. As he had never done this before,
I went downstairs to the room where he was, and found that the electric
light had been left on ; I turned it out, and heard no more of &amp;quot; Tony.&amp;quot;
The friend who gave him to me had him four years, and for most of
that time he was a great talker, but suddenly left off, and while I had him
he never talked except in hot weather, and when alone out of doors.
During the last year of his life, I trained him to such cleanly habits that I
could safely trust him on anyone without fear of accident, and, indeed,
none ever occurred. &amp;quot;Tony&amp;quot; was the envy and admiration of all my
friends, and his early death is unceasingly regretted by his mistress, who
would not have exchanged him for all the Parrots she has ever seen, or
ever will see.

THE GOLDEN-SHOULDERED PARRAKEET.
(Psephohcs chrysopterygius j .
By Regina-LD Phillipps.
&amp;quot;We come now to a group of Australian Parrakeets wliich
are, in my opinion, the most beautiful and most desirable of all,
namely, the Psephotus Parrakeets. Of this genus there are but
five (a) species known to exist, and four {h) of these are occasionally
kept in this country. The remaining species (JR. chryi^opterygius)
is very rare, and but little seems to be known of it even in its
native land.&amp;quot;
So read our esteemed fellow aviculturist Dr. Simpson, at
the Inns of Court Hotel, on 19th May, 1894, before the members
of the late Cage Bird Club, the same being an extract from his
excellent paper on &amp;quot;Parrots and Parrakeets&amp;quot; as it appears in
the Transactions ; and so much and no more is the sum total of
what he had to say on the subject of this article ; and yet it is of
this species, of which so little is known even in its native land,
and concerning which Dr. Simpson intimates so much by saying
so little, that our hard-hearted editor calls upon me to write an
account. Alas, and alack ! &amp;apos;tis but little that I know of Psephotus
chrysopterygius.
Some time in the spring of 1897, a few specimens of what
were at first supposed to be Paradise Parrakeets reached this
country from the continent. I am probably correct when I say
that six were brought over in the first instance, 6i which two
went to the Zoological Gardens, two to one of our members who
exhibited them at the Palace last February, and the remaining
two to the most humble of your servants. Two more arrived
towards the end of June, but I do not know whither they went.

Out of the eight, I believe only one turned out to be a male ; this
bird and his mate are at the Zoological Gardens in the Regent&amp;apos;s
Park, and it was from them that our illustration has been taken.
When first received, the male was in immature plumage, like to
that of the adult female ; but the authorities at the Gardens
quickly detected that the birds were not Psephotus pulcherrimus ;
and, as soon as the male had donned his adult attire, it was
announced that they were Psephotus cJuysopterygius. I suppose
that never before had living specimens of this species been seen
in this countr3^
For a time I tried to persuade myself that my two were
likewise a pair ; and I kept them under observation in a large
aviary-cage in my dining-room ; but there is not any sense in
living in a fool&amp;apos;s paradise. True, indeed, that one had a darker
\0x25A0crown than the other, and that a well-known Parrot-lover (not,
indeed, a member of our Society) pointed out with authority
which was the male and which was the female, and what were the
points of difference. I could only smile a sickly smile, for even
an authority cannot change the sex of a bird. Something may
be said for deceiving another, but not much for deceiving one-
self; and I knew in nxy heart that they were both females.
Although lacking the magnificence of the male, the female
possesses a sweet delicate beauty of her own ; some of the tints
are exceedingly soft and attractive, and the figure is exceptionally
slim and graceful. In many of its notes and ways, the Golden-
shoulder is like the Many-coloured Parrakeet, and is as easily
kept in health on the simplest fare, canary seed and spray millet
being its principle food. But the female, at any rate in the
absence of a male of her own species, is much more timid and
nervous. It is an adlive, lively bird, and its flight is very rapid.
When eventually loosed into the bird-room with garden aviary
attached, my two females did not get on very well, for their timid
wild nature hindered them from seeking the shelter of the bird-
room during cold weather, and often from obtaining a sufficiency
of food. This, however, was distinctly the fault of the aviary
and its inhospitable inhabitants. With peaceable companions,
this species would succeed much better in a warm aviar}^ than in
the best of cages. Although not exactly delicate, it is small
wonder that it keenly feels the cold when we consider that it
comes from so torrid a region as North Australia.
Like the Blue Bonnet and the Many-coloured, only in a
much greater degree, the Golden-shoulder has an instinctive
desire, as a general rule, to hang on to the wires of its cage or

aviary during the night, and as high up as it can get ; and, owing
to their insistence in passing the nights hanging on to the wire
protection over my bird-room window (they were always shut in
at night, and often during the day when cold), one of my birds
this winter took a chill and died. In all three species the idea
seems to be of roosting just under some projection, for the
purpose of concealment, just as if they were in the habit, in their
wild state, of roosting clinging to the trunk of a tree, pressino-
most likely into some convenient crevice, just below some thick
projecting bough or other over-hanging protection. Except in
the case of the sitting female, I think they never roost in holes,
or one might suppose that, like the Carolina Conure, the}^ sleep
hanging on to the insides of large hollow trunks, or possibly in
.spouts of the gum trees. When not roosting as mentioned
above, they prefer some thin natural branch or bush, fixed up at
the highest possible point. Probably the same instinct prevails
in the Paradise Parrakeet, but it is practically latent in the less
nervous Redrump, the most free breeder in captivity of the
^enus.
This spring, I have shut up my surviving female with a
young male Redrump, but nothing has come of it. The Golden-
shoulder has mostly received his advances with maidenl}&amp;apos; fear
and trepidation, which is all very pretty and proper but distinctly
aggravating. Probably, also, her feelings towards him are not
unmixed with scorn, not so much on account of his 5&amp;apos;outh, for he
will get the better of that, but on account of his comparatively
plain dress, coarse figure, and plebeian name. Is she not
indeed, a Golden-shouldered Parrakeet and he but a vulo-ar
Redrump ! Nevertheless, for all that, twice recently have I
-caught her on the sly making gracious advances, which have
been received with becoming humility, so there is room for hope
that, another year, if we should all be alive and well, somethino-
\0x25A0of the nature of a nest may come to pass after all.
This species is smaller and of more slender build than the
Many-coloured Parrakeet ; and the chief points in the plumao-e
that catch the eye may be indicated as follows : --
Adult male. A light-yellow band across the forehead, each
*end dispersing among and washing the feathers around the e3^es ;
a large triangular patch of deep black covers the crown, the base
resting on the yellow frontal band, while the apex is extended
down the centre of the back of the head and merges in the lio-ht
greyish brown of the nape, upper back, and neighbouring
regions ; lower back and upper tail-coverts light blue, inclinino-

to green towards the tail ; two central tail feathers dark olive
green, dark blue, and tipped with black ; a large golden-yellow
patch on each wing ; sides of face, neck, breast, bright blue
down to abdomen which, with thighs, is whitish barred with
deep red ; some of the blue on sides of face and neck tinged
with brilliant green ; eyes dark ; bill light with bluish or greenish
tinge ; flights dark with bluish or bluish white (or yellow) edges ;
length slightly over nine inches.
Adult female. Crown brownish ; frontal band and wash
around the e5^es, yellowish white. In my living specimen the
bill and throat are nearly white, and the cheeks and sides of face
white with a faint blue wash, so that as she holds herself erect
after the manner of her species the face generally seems
exceedingly fair, and sets off the brown cap to perfection ; the
rest of her front down to the abdomen is washed more decidedly
with blue, and the abdomen and thighs are barred with faint red,
the under tail-coverts being tinged with the same colour, while
the general appearance of the under side of the closed tail is
light blue tipped with black, the latter being caused by the two
central feathers, mostly black underneath, projecting beyond the
others ; and there is also a black bar across the base of the tail
underneath, differing in shape and width with the movements of
the bird, according to the amount exposed or hidden by the
coverts. The upper parts of the bird are j^ellow-green, the
yellow predominating here and there, especially on the wings,
but the yellow wing-patch is not so bright as in the male, nor
so well defined. The deep blue-black edge of the wing, the black
tail-tip, and the beautiful blue lower-back and upper tail-coverts(#-),
shew up grandly against the general light body-colour of the
bird. Feet and legs, pale whity-brown. It is impossible not to
notice a marked difference in the shades of the plumage of the
female at the Zoological Gardens, the skin of my dead bird, and
my living specimen, ray little female being a perfect queen
compared with the others. The delicate tints and wash-
colourings are manifestly very fleeting. A few days ago, not
deeming the colours used by our artist to be sufficiently bright,
I paid a visit to the Parrot House, and was grievously dis-
appointed to find how the birds there had deteriorated since I
saw them last summer. The male was dull and generally shabby,
and the female seemed to have entirely lost the blue tints about
the front, and was a regular dowd3^ A small cage is not the
place for such active birds. When are the members of the

Zoological Society going to wake up to the fact that their Parrot
House is an objectionable place and unworthy of its occupants !
Considering how great and growing an interest is now taken by
so many in Parrots, foreign Finches (of which they have so
miserable a collection -- presumably owing to want of space),
and other species now immured in the Parrot House, it seems
short sighted that they should be wasting their land and money
on other buildings (one looks like another feeding bar -- as if
there were not too much of that sort of thing already) while so
many valuable birds are being ruined from want of proper
accommodation.
THE NIGHTINGALE IN LANCASHIRE.
By W. lyANDLESS.
No doubt the above heading will appear somewhat strange
to most people (dj, but to me it is one of the greatest pleasures
I have to hear my Nightingale singing his full wild song every
*day, the whole day long.
My first experience of these birds was about sixteen years
ago, when I heard one singing for the first time in its wild state ;
and I was so struck with the delightful music that I determined
to possess one for myself, with the result that I have kept a &amp;apos;gale,
and sometimes two, ever}^ year since -- of course taking fresh birds
*every year and liberating in the spring each bird that does not
turn out a songster.
I have tried hand-reared birds; and have also taken the
young, and captured the parent birds which have fed and reared
them ; and I have caught branchers in the autumn ; and all
liave turned out failures, never producing any more music
than you will hear from the 3^oung swallows when they are
perched on the eaves. But being no way disheartened by this
non-success, I determined to persevere, and am rewarded with
now hearing, in the midst of a Lancashire manufacturing town
in the months of March and April, the Nightingale singing
Tiis pure wild notes as well as ever he was heard in the Surrey or
Kentish dales in the middle of May.
No doubt the above statement will sound rather doubtful
to most people who have tried to keep these charming birds ; but
when I say that I have experimented with the Nightingale for
sixteen years, and have made that species a special study -- being
(d) The Nig-htingrale is not found in its wild state in Lancashii-e -- possibly some of
&amp;quot;Our south-county readers may not be aware of this fact. -- IJd.

determined to possess, if possible, a perfect songster, -- I should
be a fairly good judge.
With regard to the treatment which is the secret of success.
First we will take the cage, which is a very important factor in.
the comfort of the bird. This should be of the box pattern,
wired onl}^ in the front; and great care should be taken to see
that there are no sharp projections such as nails, or any cracks
in the bottom, or an}^ loose rough wires in the front, as the
Nightingale is a very restless bird when in health, and con-
tinually jumping about; and the chances are that, in the course
of his daily exercise, he would come across some of these
imperfections, and ver}^ likely break his leg. I mention this as
I have lost birds in this way myself; and if there is any faulty
place in the cage they will find it. The top of the cage should
be covered with baize to prevent any damage to the bird&amp;apos;s head
if he should fly upwards, as caged Nightingales often do,
particularly during the breeding season. The perches, I find,
are much better of plain wood, say about fin. diameter, and
not covered with any material, such as baize or wash-leather.
The cage bottom should be well covered with sharp grit, say
about l^in. thick, and cleaned out at least twice a week.
Since I have adopted the plain perches and plenty of grit at
the bottom of the cage I have not been troubled in the least
with the birds&amp;apos; feet, and their claws have kept their natural
length, being of course worn down by the grit.
The cage dimensions should be at least 2ft. by i8in. by
i5in., and the food should be placed in porcelain hoppers. The
bird should be kept in a cool room having no artificial heat
whatever, as I find the Nightingale can stand a great amount of
cold, and should have a bath every day ; of course during the
winter you must add a little warm water just to take the chill
off -- your finger will be a sufficient thermometer, but I should
say the temperature should be about fifty degrees in the winter.
After the bird has bathed draw out the bottom, scrape away the
wet sand, and cover with fresh grit.
The staple food should be yolk of hard-boiled new laid
egg mixed with ants&amp;apos; eggs of the best quality, and only mix
enough to last the bird one day (this you will soon find out by
experience), and do not on any account give it stale food --
particular attention should be paid to this in summer time as it
is then more liable to turn sour. I make the yolk of one egg last
two days tor two birds -- that is, each bird gets one quarter of the
egg each day; the remaining portion of the egg should be placed

</page>
<bodyText confidence="0.99953465625" page_id="32635600"  page_num="159" year="" vol="">
in a cool place till required. You add to each daily allowance of
egg one spoonful of best ants&amp;apos; eggs, wliicli should be well worked,
in amongst the egg food, to put, as it were, a coating of yolk on
the outside of each ; if this be not done the bird will simply toss
the ants&amp;apos; eggs away ; and I find, even under the most favourable
conditions, they eat very few ants&amp;apos; eggs, but I continue to give
them my daily allowance -- one spoonful each per day.
In addition to the above diet they require a good supply of
mealworms. I give the birds at least thirty per day each, which
I cut in two before giving them. I never make a practice of
letting the birds take mealworms from my fingers, as it is an
unnatural process, and birds must be starved to do so, and once
brought so low they never regain stamina again, but sit on the
perches and mope, waiting for some one to give them another
worm. Of course the above does not refer to hand-reared
specimens. If any one were to offer my birds a mealworm from
his fingers they would simply ignore it, and yet they will sit
and sing their wild full song while I am feeding them, of
course during the singing season.
About the middle of Ma}&amp;apos; the captive Nightingale gets
somewhat off-colour, and remains so till he gets well through the
moult, which generally commences about the first week in July;
then is the time to give them a good supply of spiders and
insects, such as earwigs, flies, etc. -- nothing comes wrong in the
insect line.
From the middle of June to the end of August fresh ants&amp;apos;
eggs are very plentiful. I generally run out in the country on
my bike at least once a week, and take a small tin and spoon, and
collect a few, which help them over the moult wonderfully, and
by the middle of August they have their new plumage, and
rare and well they look, and by their action in the cage they
appear to feel very proud of it.

ON AN UNCOMMON TANAGER IN CAPTIVITY.

<bodyText confidence="0.971440125" page_id="32635600"  page_num="159" year="" vol="">
By Percy W. Farmborough, F.Z.S.
Some two years before we were married, my wife received,
as a present from a friend in South America, several birds, and
among the number were three Tanagers. Of these two died
about a month after their arrival in this country, but the
remaining one soon adapted itself to a change of residence, and,
in fact, survived until two or three weeks ago. During the three
years that it lived in England it was one of the most engaging

pets I know -- stay a moment, though, as I married after only a
six months&amp;apos; courtship, I must restrict my responsibility for that
statement to a period of eighteen months, and let my wife have
the responsibility of the previous eighteen.
The bird in question may be described as follows : -- Top of
head, cheeks and upper part of back, a rich chestnut ; lower
back, a greenish yellow, some of the feathers being faintly tinged
with chestnut ; the tail, and the primaries and secondaries of the
wing, blue ; the primary and secondary coverts, a pinkish fawn ;
the lesser and median coverts, the same as the lower back only
brighter ; the chin, throat and breast, a brilliant green verging
into a greenish blue on the abdomen, the ventral feathers being
chestnut ; the lores, jet-black ; the beak and feet, slate.
As may be imagined, the bird was a ver^^ beautiful one
and attracted a great deal of attention from visitors, and until
eighteen months ago its identity was a mystery ; but, after
looking up various ornithological works, I at length recognised
it as the Chestnut-backed Tanager (Calliste pretiosa).
The bird was kept in a drawing-room in a box-cage, which
stood on a table in the ordinary recess to be found at the side of
a fireplace. The corner in which it was placed was well lighted.
The Tanager was tame -- tame enough to take food from the
fingers of those with whom it was familiar, and steady when
surrounded by strangers. When I use the word &amp;quot; steady,&amp;quot; I do
not mean to infer that the bird was stationary, but that it was
not restless, fluttering about the cage and dashing itself violently
against the wires. The size of the cage was about three feet
six inches long, by about two feet high, by twenty inches broad.
It will thus be seen that there was sufiicient room for exercise.
There were four perches, one placed three inches from the floor
and three inches from the front of the cage, this one extended
from one side to the other, a second connected this perch from
its centre to the back of the cage, and the remaining two were
in the ordinary position of perches. The food and water were
placed in white glazed earthenware vessels, so that everything
was perfectly sweet and clean. The floor was strewn plentifully
(nearly half-an-inch in depth) with coarse sand.
The bird was fed on small insects, mealworms, spiders,
and small garden caterpillars, as well as on such fruits as
were in season, black currants being particularly relished. It
ate banana, but shewed no particular liking for it, and whilst
other fruit was to be had would leave it till the last. When
insects and fruit ran short the deficiency in food was made up by
</bodyText>
<bodyText confidence="0.952728625" page_id="32635602"  page_num="161" year="" vol="">
i6i
a mixture, in equal parts, of ants&amp;apos; eggs soaked in hot water for
\0x25A0a few moments, and fresh hard-boiled yolk of eggs.
The Tanager in question often whistled softly, but exhibited
no extraordinary vocal powers, its chief attraction lying in the
beauty of its plumage. It would take food from the tips of our
fingers, but only in a very gingerly fashion ; first hopping down
on to the lower perch, standing there for a few moments twisting
its head from side to side as if trying to ascertain whether there
was a trap laid or not.
The other Tanagers, which survived their arrival in
England only a matter of three or four weeks, were described
as being thickly spotted with blackish markings on a green
ground. This description would shew them to be either Calliste
j)unctata, or C. guttata, or C. xarithogastra, but of this there can
be no certainty as I never saw the birds.

THE NEW ZEALAND PARRAKEET.

By A. Savage.
These Parrakeets are great favourites of mine, although,
</table>
<bodyText confidence="0.997226" page_id="32635602"  page_num="161" year="" vol="">
from want of room, I do not possess any at the present moment.
They are, as far as my experience goes, quite harmless birds,
and can be lodged, without fear, in an aviary of mixed Finches
or Budgerigars, and this opinion is confirmed by others who
have kept them on this side of the Channel {i). Their plumage
is in harmony with their disposition -- quiet -- the prevailing
colour being dark green ; the forehead and cheeks are red,
and a small patch of red is found on each side of the rump ;
the flight feathers are blue. The beak is dark, with a large
whitish spot on the upper mandible ; eyes ruby. The legs are
long, enabling the birds to run quickly, and they spend a good
deal of their time on the ground, turning over, with their feet,
the sand on the floor of the aviary in search of tit-bits, fowl
fashion. The male and female are practically alike in plumage,
but the female is smaller than the male^ier head and beak are
considerably so, and there, I think, is the best mark of distinction
between the sexes. The voice is peculiar, and resembles a bleat
more than anything else -- hence the German appellation &amp;quot; Ziegen-
sittich,&amp;quot; or Goat Parrakeet. I believe the importation of the New

Continent ; but aviarj^-bred birds are frequentlj^ obtainable on
this side of the Channel ; such birds are quite hardy, and a good
pair will breed free!}&amp;apos;- without fuss or trouble. They are adult at
six months, and 3&amp;apos;oung hatched in January have been known to-
breed the same year; birds hatched during the spring and summer
months breed, as a rule, the next year. I believe New Zealands
were the first Parrakeets, larger than Budgerigars, I ever bred.
The eggs are white, as is usually the case with Parrakeets, and
there are generally from four to six to the clutch. I have never
had less than tw^o or more than four j^oung reared per nest, but
more fortunate amateurs can boast of a nest of six on more than
one occasion. There are three, four, or even five nests during
the year, when a good pair commence breeding early in January ;.
but three nests have always satisfied me.
Food is a ver}^ simple matter : -- Canary seed, white millet,
and oats, mixed with a sprinkling of hemp (about a couple of
dozen seeds) on the top, and spra}^ millet, is all the seed I gave,
whether they had young or not. Green food is, of course,
necessar}^ -- chickweed in seed, and groundsel in flower, I con-
sider the best -- and they must have plenty of it when they have
young to feed. As soon as the young are hatched, the parents
become quite bold when the green food is taken into the aviary ;
one cock bird I had would almost come on to my hand for it, he
was in too big a hurr)&amp;apos; to wait, with the cares of his family of four on
his shoulders, until it was tied up in its place. They are excellent
feeders, and I never lost a young one from want of care on the
part of the parents or insufficient feeding. The}^ remain in the
nest about a month, and can dash about pretty well when they
leave it. This Parrakeet can be strongly recommended to any
amateur wishing to &amp;quot; try his hand &amp;quot; with a species a nick above
Budgerigars. I do not think they have been mentioned in the
Magazine before, but we had an interesting article, by Mr.
Bouskill, on breeding C. auriceps, a kindred species.

ON CERTAIN IMPERFECTLY KNOWN POINTS IN
THE HABITS AND ECONOMY OF BIRDS.

By F. Finn, B.A., F.Z.S.
DepJity Superintendent of the Indian Musenni.
Although the habits of birds, more especially those
connected with nidification and the care of the young, have been
long and carefully studied, much remains to be done in the
observation of living birds, even when these belong to quite
common and well-known species. This consideration serves me
for an excuse for introducing a few notes which I have been led to
make on certain points, in the economy of birds, which appear
to me to have been insufl&amp;ciently studied, and to have, possibly,
some bearing on the difficult problem of avian classification.
Students of other groups of animals -- I may instance Bats and
Butterflies-- avail themselves of peculiarities of attitude, etc., in
their subjects for taxonomical purposes, and with regard to
Birds I see no reason why such peculiarities as those to which
I draw attention below should not be taken into consideration
by systematic ornithologists, equall}&amp;quot; with nidificatorj^, distribu-
tional, and dietetic variations.
On the position of the feet in fi^ight among &amp;quot; Picakian&amp;quot;
Birds and Parrots.
I will first notice a point which has latelj^ attracted consider-
able attention among ornithologists -- the positions of the feet in
certain groups of birds when the members of these are on the
wing. It ma}&amp;apos; be taken, I think, as fairly settled that Waders
and Waterfowl, Game-birds, Pigeons, and Birds-of-Prey, carry
their feet behind when in full flight, irrespective of the length of
those members. But with regard to the mostl}^ short-legged
Picarics and the Parrots I am not aware that any observations
have been made, and I have therefore taken particular notice of
these birds with the following results : --
To take the Parrots first. I long watched the common
Indian Parrakeets (chiefl}^ PalcEorriis torquatus) when at large,
in order to discover where their legs were placed when the birds
were on the wing ; but owing to the swiftness of their flight, and
the fact that the feet are ordinarily concealed beneath the feathers
of a flying bird, I was unsuccessful, till one day a Palceornis
torquatus got into the Bird Galler}^ of the Museum, and flying to
and fro overhead, gave me an excellent opportunitj^ of observing
that its feet were carried behind. As the gallery is a very large
one, and the bird took long flights, I have no doubt but that this
</bodyText>
<page confidence="0.9668" page_id="32635605"  page_num="164" year="" vol="">
i64
</page>
<bodyText confidence="0.993837204545454" page_id="32635605"  page_num="164" year="" vol="">
is the normal position for the species, and very probably for
Parrots in general.
Among the so-called &amp;apos;&amp;apos; Picarice&amp;quot; using the term in its
widest sense, I have noted the carriage of the feet in flying
Hoopoes, Kingfishers, Rollers, Hornbills, Barbets, Woodpeckers
and Cuckoos, and will now take each of these groups in detail as
to this point. In Hoopoes I have been unable to get a sight of
the feet of a bird flying at large, but by buying specimens of
Upupa epops in the Calcutta Bazaar, and letting them out in my
quarters, I found that the feet are constantly kept drawn up
to the body, as the bird flies -- never extended behind, at least in
a room. In Hornbills on the other hand in spite of the supposed
alliance of these birds to the UpupidcB, the feet appear to be
extended behind in flight. I saw this very distinctly at any rate
in two specimens of the common black-and-white Ani/uacoceros;
the bird in each case was a tame one, but flying out of doors.
With regard to Rollers, I have suspected, from watching birds
at liberty, that the common Coracias iiidica carries its feet behind;
l3Ut I could not be certain till I let out a tame bird I had in my
iDedroom, and found that though the feet were at first allowed to
hang like a crow&amp;apos;s when starting, they were undoubtedly stretched
out behind the bird when well under way.
Of Kingfishers I have observed more than one species. A
Ceryle riidis I brought up from the nest, and allowed to fly about
at liberty for this very observation, distinctly carried its feet
&amp;quot;behind, as also do Alcedo ispida and Haley 07i sniyrneyisis, as I
have been able to observe with wild birds ; though the former
takes a lot of watching to determine a point like this ! The
I^aughing Jackass {Dacelo gigas) carries the legs behind also, as
I made out with the keeper&amp;apos;s assistance in the fine aviary at the
London Zoological Gardens, when in England on leave last year
(1897).
With Barbets my only observations that were at all
satisfactory were made on a specimen of Thereiceryx zeylonicus in
a very large compartment of the Bird House in the Calcutta
Zoological Gardens. Here this bird constantly kept its feet
drawn up to the body when on the wing. Some Blue-cheeked
Barbets {Cyanops asiaticd) in a smaller compartment in another
house, did the same, but for reasons to be presently given I do
not set so much value on this observation.
Of Woodpeckers I have observed only two individuals of
our common Gold-backed Woodpecker (^Brachyptennis aurantms) ;
a young female I kept mj^self and let out both in the open and
in my room, and a male in the large aviary in the Zoological

<bodyText confidence="0.990693595238095" page_id="32635606"  page_num="165" year="" vol="">
Gardens above referred to. Both birds carried the feet drawn
up to the body like the Barbets, or like Passerine birds (/). In the
case of Cuckoos I have observed, with wild birds, that both the
Koel {Eudy7iamis honorata) and the Crow-pheasant {Centropus
sinensis) carry their feet behind when well under way. I have
seen this particularly well in the case of the last species, whose
feet in flight have exactly the same position behind as I have
seen in a Pheasant and a domestic fowl, in Kngland. A
Hierococcyx appeared to have its feet drawn up in a short flight.
Domestic fowls, however, in their short flights, usually
carry their feet in front, and this I noticed in a young Centropns,
I had free, but tame, in the Museum compound, and in a Koel in
the large aviary above referred to. As this is done by Pigeons
also when starting, though they afterwards extend their feet
behind, I do not feel absolutely certain about the Woodpeckers,
Barbets and Hoopoes, but as I never saw any backward extension
of the feet in these birds, I think that the forward position iS&amp;apos;
really the permanent one in them, though I should have liked a
good look at a bird in a long flight overhead, at liberty if possible.
With regard to the Parrot and Roller, though these birds
were confined, the former had plent}^ of room for a long flight,
and as to the latter, I have never met with any bird which first
extends its feet behind and then draws them up, so that I consider
the observation on these as sufficiently conclusive for the species,
in question, if not for their allies.
From these experiences I conclude that, supposing the-
same habit of carrying the feet to run through a famil)^ the forward
position of the feet in flight probably characterises Hoopoes,
Woodpeckers, and Barbets, and the backward one certainly
obtains among Kingfishers, Rollers, Hornbills, Cuckoos, and
Parrots.

SCIENTIFIC AVICULTURE.
Sir, -- I was much interested in Dr. Bntler&amp;apos;s article on &amp;quot; Scientific
Aviculture&amp;quot; in the April number of the Magazine, p. loi, vol. iv.
I quite agree with the views therein expressed, and in this connexion
I should like to know whether measures have been taken to secure the
lodgment of complete copies of the Magazine, from its commencement, in
some of the leading scientific libraries, e.g., that of the Zoological Society
in Hanover Sqtiare, so that they maj- always be available for reference. If

If aviculturists, however, are remiss in recording their experiences, it
must be acknowledged that naturalists are most inattentive to living birds
in captivity ; and so the former should take every means of publishing the

as well as in our little publication, which, I fear, is probably less well known
among scientific ornithologists than it deserves to be.

FOOD FOR SOFT-BIIvLED BIRDS.

Sir, -- It is with great reluctance that I continue this discvission, but
inasmuch as Mr. Perkins ignores facts which have been clearly stated, I feel
it a duty to the Society as well as to myself to repeat them here.
As regards his first assertion that, &amp;quot; If a Tanager may be called a
Finch, surely a Nightingale ma}&amp;apos; be called a Warbler,&amp;quot; I must reply that,
according to Dr. Sclater, a Tanager is simply a deutirostral Finch, that is to
say, a fruit-eating Finch whose beak has been adapted to its mode of
feeding; whereas a Nightingale is merely a small Thrush, having spotted
young ; and is about as nearly related to the Warblers as the Tanagers are :
the same is true also of the Chats.
His second statement, respecting Dr. Bradburn, hardly needs a reply;
for an5&amp;apos;one who has read the book (I believe I was its first reviewer) will find
that raw or cooked meat is recommended by its author for the Song-Thrush,
Missel-Thrush, Blackbird, Ring Ouzel, Skylark (b}&amp;apos; implication -- the Wood-
lark), the Shorelark, Meadow-Pipit, Tree-Pipit, etc., etc., etc. The book is
a fairly good one, but contains some serious blunders, one of which is --
*&amp;apos; Never attempt to hand-rear Wagtails of an}&amp;apos; description or you will fail.&amp;quot;
I do not doubt that the cause of Dr. Bradburn&amp;apos;s failure to rear this least
difficult of all birds, was -- that he gave scraped raw beef to the nestlings.
I do not suppose that Mr. Perkins makes an arbitrary distinction
between British and Foreign birds: if he reckons the Nightingale British
because it comes here in the spring, and the Blue-throat Foreign because it
comes here in the autumn, I know that he does so. The Redstart and
Whinchat are both said to eat growing corn, and the Redstart and Wheat-
ear to eat fruits : the Redstart which I now possess, and have had for
nearly two years, lives principally upon bread and seed ; for the &amp;^^ and
ants&amp;apos; cocoons in its mixture are usually seized by other birds before it can
get more than a taste. On the other hand the American Blue-bird is almost
exclusively insectivorous until the aiitumn, when it does what Mr. Perkins
credits the Nightingale with doing; yet who will say that bread disagrees
with a Blue-bird .? Not I, certainly, for I have my male still in perfect
health, and I purchased it from Mr. Abrahams, I think, at least nine years
ago.
I will, however, candidly confess, that Mr. Fulljames&amp;apos; practical
experience has so far convinced me that a Nightingale may be better with-
out bread (even though it 7nay be able to digest it), that I give none to my
(gj The Avicultural Magazine is forwarded monthly to the Library of the Zoological
Society of London, and also to the Zoological. Library at the Nat. Hist. Museum, .South
Kensington. We believe that complete copies of the JIagazine from its commencement
are preserved at both these Libraries.-- Kd.

present bird ; but feed it upon Abrahams&amp;apos; food, 5^olk of egg, ants&amp;apos; cocoons (/?)
and mealworms; I give the food all mixed together (but not damped), and I
sometimes sprinkle in a little Zeke, the new &amp;quot;dried flies&amp;quot; now being

A. G. Buti,e;r.
Sir, -- I am sorr}&amp;apos; that I cannot comply with Mr. Phillipps&amp;apos;s request
that I should give my personal experiences of the food of the wild
Nightingale, for the simple but sufficient reason that I have, so far as I am
aware, never even seen a wild Nightingale. I confess with much sorrow,
though without shame, that almost the whole of my sixty-two 3&amp;apos;ears have
b)een passed amongst bricks and mortar : even when in America I was
nearly always in New York or Montreal (though I should not, under any
circumstances, have been able to add to my knowledge of the Nightingale
on that side of the &amp;quot; herring-pond ! &amp;quot;).
As to captive Nightingales, my experience is that they w/// eat fruit.
When I lived at Birmingham in the seventies I had several Nightingales,
most of which w^ould eat a little fruit occasionally, but never freel}- or as if
they cared for it. I fed them on a mixture of ants&amp;apos; eggs, hard-boiled eo-o-,
and a little powdered biscuit, and I now believe that if I had omitted the
&amp;quot;biscuit and giveii the j&amp;apos;olk of egg without the white mj- success would have
been greater. The Nightingale which I now have has, up to the present,
refused to eat fruit. I feed him on soaked ants&amp;apos; eggs, with a little of
Abrahams&amp;apos; egg now and then, and at least seven or eight mealworms a day (i).

BRITISH BIRD NOTEvS.
Sir, -- I have been staying this spring in a rural part of Kent, about
ten miles from Canterbury ; perhaps a few notes on the birds I have seen
ma}&amp;apos; be of interest to some of the members.
The nesting season was generallj&amp;apos; rather late, owing to the cold winds
and frequent rain. I heard the Nightingale for the first time on the 4tli
April, and the Cuckoo on the 9th. Nightingales have been numerous. I
found one nest containing five eggs on the i4tli Ma}&amp;apos;. This was on the
ground, in a bunch of nettles, at the back of a stack of wood. The eo-o-s
all hatched, and the young ones had flown by the 2nd June. When I
cautiously looked at the nestlings, the birds made a good deal of noise, and
came close to me with their tails up, in a very excited and angrv manner.
Linnets built both in the hedges by the roadside, and in short bushes on the
slopes of the Downs. I had seven nests under view, one with four eoo-s
that were almost white, without any spots. Of these seven nests, four had
the eggs taken, I think by other birds, probably Jays, as there were two
pairs near by. The eggs were broken in the nest, and the contents eaten.
One nest of young Linnets was dragged out by some boys, from whom I
captured it. As it was useless to attempt to replace it, I took the little
things home, placed nest and young in a basket, and hand-fed the birds
(/;) The ants&amp;apos; cocoons are the last things eaten, but all the egg- disappears.-- A. G. B.
(i) Thank j&amp;apos;ou ; books are responsible for many avicultural errors&amp;apos;. But I must
not crow too loudU&amp;apos;, for on June 9th m,v English Nightingale deliberately went ud to
and gave eight decided pecks at, the half-rotten remains of a partialh- devoured cherry
(put down for but little regarded by the Golden Orioles-- books again), ignoring many
sound good ones scattered around. -- R. P.

every two hours with scalded rape and crushed biscuit, mixed into a paste-
with milk, aud given warm. They are now fledged and flying in a large-
cage.
There are several Nightjars about. I nearly trod on two eggs which
were laid on the ground in an open space in a wood. They have apparently
deserted the eggs, as they are cold, and I have not seen the birds near since,
but I hear their peculiar whirring noise at dusk. The Nightjar is an object
of superstition with many of the country people in Kent. The idea that,
when they are hawking round for moths of an evening, they are trying to-
strike the passers by with their wings, is common. And if the}&amp;apos; touch a
child, it is thought that that child will cease to grow.
I found the pretty little domed nest of the Wood Warbler, made of
grass and lined with hair. It was at the foot of a small elder bush, and, to
my regret, came to grief. Broken egg shells, a torn nest, and a number of
feathers on the ground, showed that some enemy had surprised the hen.
The Red-backed Shrike, or Butcher Bird, built in a hedge near the house.
The cock constantly sat on a high twig, nearly always in the same place,
and I found the nest within a few yards of his perch. Three young ones
hatched, but I can find no &amp;quot;larder.&amp;quot; Does this bird always have a larder,,
such as the one in the Museum at South Kensington ? The nest is very
like that of the Greenfinch. The latter bird is very plentiful, the nests-
close to the road and easy to find.
The slaughter that goes on at nesting-time in many of these country
places is enormous. The Wild Birds&amp;apos; Protection Act is completely ignored.
Gangs of boys and young njen start out on Sundays, and tear out all the
nests they can find, smashing the eggs, and killing the young ones. I have
spoken to farmers and others, asking if the}&amp;apos; cannot try to stop this whole-
sale massacre that goes on on their land. But as a rule they are inclined to
approve of it, and appear to think that all birds are vermin, and should be
treated the same as rats and mice. I have found the same state of things in
Hampshire, Sussex, Devonshire, and Somerset. Can no influence, that is.
of any practical use, be brought to bear to prevent this ? A. Crafer.

Sir, -- I bought a pair of Cherry Finclies in August last. They
\0x25A0were not long in my aviary before they took possession of a German
travelling cage, but it was not iintil the end of March that I suspected
they were busy. I did not, of course, satisfy my curiosity on the point
for fear of disturbing them. The last &amp;quot;w^eek in April three fully-fledged
birds, strong on the wing, emerged from the nest ; a fourth I found dead,
having evidently been the weak one of the brood, and insufficiently fed.
Two are now fine birds ; the third, unfortunately, was the victim of an
accident. The parents were capital feeders, and it was very interesting to
watch them following their young ones from tree to tree, and guarding
them from any other bird which ventured near them. My room is tenanted
by quite twenty pairs of Finches, Mannikins, and Canaries, and one pair of
Goldfinches (forty to fifty birds in all). I believe the Cherry Finches are
already busy again. (_/&amp;quot;) M. PIusband.
(/) The Cherry Finch (Aidemosyne inodesta) has been bred in this country before, one
young- bird being reared by Mr. Cronkshavv in 1895 (see Avic. Mag. vol. ii., p. 30)-- but the
occurrence appears to be very unusual, though it is hard to say why this should be
the case. -- e;d.

M)^ experience of the subject of this paper is not a
lengthened one ; and consequently there is a possibility that a
longer acquaintance with the species may cause me to take a
different view of some of the fadls and fancies gathered up to
date, and now about to be recorded.
A dealer told me, not very long ago, that he would never
buy a White-eared Finch again as it could not bear a journey,
all of his having died when sent on their travels. It may be
useful to note, therefore, as tending to point to a want of robust-
ness in the species, that the first pair I purchased was sent an
unnecessary journey owing to the absence of the ordinary
elements of care. Of the five I have had, these two alone have
ever shewn signs of sickness, one dying within the month, and
the other, although still alive, being delicate, and not likely to
make old bones.
These first two birds greatly won my heart ; and since
their advent I have regarded the species as quite one of the
nicest of the small seed-eaters. It is not gaudy, yet the shades
of colour in a good specimen are exceptionally chaste and
delicate ; it is, as a rule, of a gentle and amiable disposition,
quiet, and the reverse of restless, yet not dull and listless ;
the love song is quaint and almost pretty -- quite so to my avi-
culturally-tuned ears ; and, when there are several together, they
occasionally burst into quite a tiny blare of trumpeting delight.
They have a funny little way, too, of assembling on the ground
in a group, with heads raised on high, and of all starting oflf
together in an excited chatter, as if raising their voices against
some infringement of their privileges or curtailment of their
liberties ; or sometimes three will join together and say nasty

things about No. 4, who, standing near, listens attentively to all
their remarks ; so far, however, they have not carried out the
&amp;quot;sentence of the court and executed the offender, after the manner
of Rooks. Their ordinary calls and notes, which have man3^
variations, are of the trumpet class, and very like those of the
Masked Grassfinch, but more prolonged.
I observe that different individuals of this species var}&amp;apos;
considerably in the colourings of their plumage, and, in a lesser
degree, in the shades of their bills, legs, and feet ; this seems to
be the result of surroundings, health, and general condition
rather than of sex or age. Recentl}^ I saw some in a dealer&amp;apos;s
shop and took them to be Masked Grassfinches, but on looking
at them again more carefully I found they were White-ears.
Although well kept, they appeared to me to be nearly as
dull and dark in their colours as the Masks. Three I bought
in the early spring had likewise been dull and dark where
now they are light and bright, excepting the bills and legs,
wdiich perhaps retain their different shades. This close re-
semblance, under certain circumstances, to P. personata is
suggestive of the close affinity which probably exists between
the two species, and tempts one to be so profane as to suggest
that the one may be but a bleached variety of the other. My
Masks and White-ears freely associated together for some months
and formed one flock, and all slept amicably together at night
in the same box, and their notes are much alike as has already
been remarked. One of my Masks paired off with a White-ear
in a half-hearted sort of a way ; and there was a good deal of
indiscriminate kissing going on during the off season. The eggs
from such a cross would certainlj^ be fertile ; and probably the
progeny would not be altogether barren. For all that, although
so nearly allied, the two species are now obviously distindt. I
notice that, if approached when on the ground, where they
spend a good deal of their time, the whole flock becomes still
and motionless, each individual retaining its exact position and
posture as if turned into stone, trusting to remain undiscovered,
all of them flying off simultaneously with wild cries when the
intruder comes too near. Here we have a peep into their native
life, of which, unfortunately, so little seems to be known.
Neither will associate with members of the other species of the
genus, and when along with them endeavour to keep out of their
way ; and in one way or another they differ from all of them.
My first pair of White-eared Grassfinches was placed in a
large aviary-cage in a warm room with the Masks and lyong-tails
(P. acuticauda), the door being usually left open for a few hours

in tlie best part of the day. In the front part of the room there
were two tables covered with potted plants, and in front of the
tables, in the bay window, were some large eucalyptus trees, etc.,
for the birds to perch upon. The two White-ears soon shewed a
desire to nest ; there were several nesting-boxes in their house,
but the presence of the other birds was too much for their timid
nature, or possibly the boxes were too artificial to arouse their
nesting instincts, and they soon declared their intentions of
nesting in a flower-pot in which a creeper was growing, at the
edge of one of the tables. Finding they were in earnest, that
they would not nest anywhere else and fretted when separated
from this pot, I shut off the other birds and let them have their
wa}^
A domed nest was quickly built, with the aperture of
course facing the window ; but the construdlion was flimsy ; and
when in the room I could see the birds through the back of the
nest ; and this seemed to distress them greatly. I supplied
abundance of material in the wa}^ of dried grasses, but the}^ were
exceedingl}^ dissatisfied, and hunted all over the place for some-
thing more. I then threw down other materials, and they
instantly pounced on the feathers, of which they took a large
number, very thickl}^ lining the whole interior with them,
including the roof : moss, hair, etc., they did not touch. But
the precious nest was far too precious to be slept in ; and they
quickl}&amp;apos;- betrayed by their squatting instincfls still closer affinity
with personata (see page 185 of vol. III.). Before nightfall of
the first day they commenced to build a squatting-place on the
floor, some three or four feet from the nest but in a place from
which they could keep an eye on it. I took the hint and placed
some travelling cages about this spot, of one of which they
immediately took possession, and in which they invariabl}^
passed the night, and also a good part of the day when the nest
was finished. But day followed day and matters did not progress ;
the nest had been industriously and carefully built and finished,
but beyond carrying up an occasional feather or piece of grass
everything seemed at a standstill : something was wrong, and it
was only too clear what that something was : the male was sick.
For some time I had been watching him with anxiety, but he
was steadily going down hill, and was soon a thing of the past.
It would probably have been wiser had I resisted their strong
inclinations to go to nest until I had had them longer -- but they
came from a good home, they were in comfortable quarters, and
I thought I might risk it.

The nest was like the very fluffy head of a fair child poised
in the flower-pot, but in front the dried grasses hung down, inter-
mingled with the creeper, like a long flowing beard. The first
thought naturally is that this long streamer was an accident, just
the materials that had been dropped by the birds and caught in
the creeper. But last autumn, after the leaves had fallen off the
Virginia creeper in the garden, I found the squatting-place of
the Masked Grassfinches. It was like a pedestal, about eight
inches high, nearly flat at the top, and without any covering
whatever, the mass of foliage amongst which it was built doubt-
less having been considered sufficient protection. But the most
interesting point about it was that all the way down, and all
round except on the side of the square post against which it was
built, the ends of the dry grasses of which it was constructed
hung down several inches, something like a shower bouquet.
With this before me, I should hesitate to say that the &amp;quot; beard &amp;quot;\0x25A0
of the White-ears&amp;apos; nest had been caused altogether by accident.
This nest formed a very pretty object, and was preserved in a
spare room for many weeks. It was sunk in the flower-pot
slightly over one inch, and the dimensions were : -- Height above
rim of flower-pot, 4 in. ; solid breadth, 7 in. ; extreme breadth,
10 in. ; solid depth, 5 in. ; extreme depth, 6 in. ; extreme height
from tip of beard, (which was mostly 5-7 in. broad, and extended
down just about as low as the creeper) over 30 in. Our artist&amp;apos;s
drawing, bj^ the way, was not taken from this nest.
The poor little survivor, still known as The Widow, was
disconsolate at the loss of her mate ; and for manj^ days her
plaintive cry -- which was often double like the call of a
Partridge, but more prolonged -- quite rang in our ears and filled
our hearts with S3anpath3^
Some time elapsed before I was able to obtain another
specimen. I had quite looked forward to the Palace Show with
the hope that I might be able to obtain one there, but, splendid
Show as it was, it was so far incomplete that it did not contain
a single specimen of the White-eared Grassfinch. However, on
February igtli, I unexpe(5tedly dropped upon three, and carried
them all home with, much satisfaction. My objecfl had alwa3^s
been to obtain a mate for the poor little widow, but in this
respedl I was unsuccessful, for the new birds turned out to be a
married couple and a sedate spinster.

II.-- CONURES.
The Macaws should naturally be followed by the Conures,
but here I must confess to a great lacuna in my knowledge of
Parrots. The Conures have never appeared to me attractive from
any one point, neither that of colour, nor of intelligence, nor of
harmlessness, nor of silence. They seem to me noisy, mis-
chievous, indifferent talkers, and not particularly beautiful.
The Patagonian Conure I have been tempted to try, but I feared
that it might prove as noisy as a Macaw, and more destructive.
I had a pair of White-eared Conures, which were given to me
because one picked itself. They were turned into an aviary, but
they shewed no sign of wishing to breed, and as they were wild
and uninteresting I parted with them.
I had in my charge for some time four specimens of
solstitialis. These certainly were beautiful. All four slightly
differed in colour, which may have been owing to their being
5^oung birds. They resembled Jendayas, but were of a more
brilliant orange and red. Bechstein says they learn to speak
easily and well. Russ makes no remark upon their qualities as
pets. These were noisy and wild, and though I put them under
the charge of a woman who was particularly fond of animals,
they never became tamer as long as I had them. Perhaps had
they been kept singly they might have grown tamer.
The one really fascinating Conure I have seen was a
specimen of biteus, or, as the British Museum Catalogue calls
it, guaronba. This was a specimen which was deposited at the
Zoological Gardens, and was for sale for ;^io. It was extra-
ordinarilj^ tame. You could swing it about by one leg or by the
tail ; it would lie on its back in your hand, and delighted in being
played with ; it was said to be a good talker. The plate of it in
&amp;quot; Parrots in Captivity &amp;quot; is a good one. In that it will be seen
that the flight feathers are green, and I hardly think that is the
idea one gets from the description of it in the British Museum
Catalogue. It is a lovely gold lemon yellow, with white beak
and feet. Later on Mr. Bartlett had two young ones, which were
very fairly tame and nearly all green. Those three are the only
living specimens I have seen, and with them conies to an end all
that I can say about Conures.

Perhaps the Hawk-headed Parrot ( Deroptyus accipUrimis )
which forms a genus by itself, may best come after the Conures.
I take the description from the British Museum Catalogue, which,
however, classes it after Pionus, and puts it away altogether from
Co7niriis.
&amp;apos;&amp;apos;Adult male. Green ; head brown, frontal edge and lores
darker ; pileum hoary grey (I should have called it muddy
white) ; sides of the head with hoary shaft-streaks ; long feathers
of the nape, and feathers of the breast and abdomen, dark red
with the edges blue ; bastard wing, primary coverts, and primaries
black ; secondaries green, with the tips black, slightly tinged
with blue ; tail feathers green, tinged with blue towards the
tip, the blue increasing towards the outer feather, which has the
outer web blue, except at the base ; greater under wing-coverts,
quills, and tail feathers below, black ; the lateral tail-feathers
have dull red spots at the bases of the inner webs ; bill dusky
horn colour : feet black ; iris brown. Total length 14 inches ;
wing 8 ; tail 6-4.
Specimens from Ecuador and Maranham are larger.&amp;quot;
Perhaps these latter may account for Russ saying the bird
is almost as large as a Raven. Certainly I never saw one as
large as a Rook.
It has a curious habit of puffing out all its head and neck
feathers when excited, like the Salmon-crested Cockatoo.
They are not very common, and are more often sent or
brought over privately. Dr. Greene found one a very good
talker. That has not been my experience. The birds I had
were not very tame, and the tamest, when it got used to me, was
treacherous, and would bite when I put its tins into the cage.
It was very noisy at times. I think their character as pets is
very like that of the Conures, whatever their structure may
be. I expect one may say of all that, if you rear the young by
hand, you might find the cock birds clever and companionable,
but that unless they are quite tame, they are better in a Zoological
Garden than in a private house.

CONURES.
By O. E. CRESSWI3LL.
I do not for a moment pretend to have any wide knowledge
of Conures ; but what experience I have is far more favourable
to the genus than that of Mr. Button. I have had but four, and
have them all now, for Conures are extremely hardy and I fancy
long-lived, and I never tire of any feathered pets. Before I come
to them I would say of the Conurus hdezis (a) or &amp;quot; Queen of
Bavaria&amp;apos;s &amp;quot; Parrakeet that the only specimen I have seen, a very
splendid one, in the Parisian Jardin d&amp;apos;acclimatation, was richer
and deeper in hue than the pretty illustration in &amp;quot; Parrots in
Captivity.&amp;quot; I believe I described its colour in my account of
the said garden as being the richest amber. No doubt the depth
of colour depends on the bird&amp;apos;s age.
The first of my Conures, which I have had towards six
years, is a Patagonian. He came to me from Mr. Abrahams&amp;apos;
establishment with the character of a &amp;quot; tame and talking bird.&amp;quot; It
was a long while before he talked here, but when he once began
he rapidly improved, learnt more words and sounds, and his utter-
ance of them is the clearest I have ever heard from any Parrot ;
he is very clever, indeed cunning, and unfortunately will never
talk or do anything to order. He knows perfectly when one
wishes to show him off, and is immediately silent. He spends
much of his time in a verandah near the hall door, and I have
known him often persistently silent when visitors were looking
at him and other birds, and before their carriage had gone half-
a-minute he was jabbering absurdly. He is a great respecter of
persons, perfectly quiet when well-dressed people call, but makes
an appalling noise if disagreeable-looking tramps arrive, and
never stops shrieking till somebody he knows comes out, and
then he is instantly silent- He knows everybody on the premises,
but if a new gardener or groom arrives he summons us on their
first, and probably their second, appearance ; then he understands
that they are to be tolerated. He is never disagreeably noisy,
unless he thinks something is wrong. He imitates a hen which
has laid an egg, perfectly ; with voice and beak against the bars
he catches exactly the various sounds of sawing wood ; for one
boy he would dance absurdly, and is suspected of mocking a
maid whom he sees resting her head upon her hand by a window.
Certainly he puts up his foot, and rests his head sideways upon

it in a most lackadaisical fashion. Apparentl}&amp;apos; he is impervious
to cold, and is quite happy when his water-dish contains a block
of ice.
The next of my Conures are a little bright green pair with,
orange breasts -- Cactus Conures {CoiuLriis cadoriaii). I have
liad them about five years, they don&amp;apos;t talk, but are always merrj^
and bright, and seem to have great capacity for enjoying life.
At any time the}&amp;apos; \vill go into a strange sort of ecstas}&amp;apos;, jabbering
and fluttering and rushing towards me if I come up to the cage
or aviar}&amp;apos; (for I have at times turned them into an aviar}-), but if
an}&amp;apos; one else is too near they are sh}&amp;apos; and won&amp;apos;t do this. When,
however, I have been away for any time, and then reappear, their
delight knows no bounds, all shyness goes, and before any
company the}&amp;apos; continue their jabbering and flutterings as long as
I will look at them.
]M}&amp;apos; fourth Conure is a late acquisition. In Februar}&amp;apos; I
saw% in a grimy little London shop, a St. Thomas&amp;apos; Conure
(^Comtrus pertinax) ; he is slightly larger than the Cactus Conures,
bright green with orange forehead, and back of the head golden.
He is tame and funny, and is said to say a few words very
plainly -- but he has not said them to me 3&amp;apos;et. I must confess he
is noisy, especially when he is in my library and can just hear a
party of other parrots out of doors, and another contingent in
another room. It is funny how Parrots, which are fearfully
jealous of each other w^hen in close quarters, never cease to call
and answer each other when separated. The Latin epithet for
this s^ec\QS, pertinax, sounds strange, but I am inclined to think
was not rashly conferred. Through many mornings my bird
screeches with real pertinacity. When alone I am almost
unconscious of such noises, but when friends are announced
certain Parrots as a matter of course are carried out of the room.
The strong health of the Conure tribe is one of their greatest
advantages, and many of them are gaudih^ lovel}-. The
Patagonian, wath his quaint hues of olive, his underparts of
lemon and bright fire-colour, and above all his beautiful flesh-
coloured feet, is a unique Parrot. M}&amp;apos; own Patagonian has
by far more character than any other Parrot I have ever
possessed, and is, I believe, capable of much further education,
but I have too many birds to fully bring out the talents of all.

THE NESTING OF THE PEKIN ROBIN.

B}^ the Rev. C. D. Farrar.
Pekin Robins are among the loveliest birds imported into
this country. They usually arrive about February or March, and
can often be purchased for as low a price as 5s. a pair. The
reason of this is that, being half insectivorous birds, very few-
amateurs keep them proper!}&amp;apos;&amp;apos;, and consequently they soon die
off. Another reason why so few are kept is that Pekins are
very soft feathered birds ; and, after being a few days in a dealer&amp;apos;s
box-cage, they present a really deplorable appearance, -- wings
fra57ed out and tails like a stumpy paintbrush. This comes of
their habit of clinging to the bars of the cage. Personall}&amp;apos;-, I do
not think Pekins suitable to cage life at all ; unless they are very
tame. I have always found them most hardy. Mine are kept in
a big outdoor aviary all the year round, and they never seem to
ail anything, and care nothing for the severest cold. The only
sort of weather they object to is &amp;quot;Fog;&amp;quot; but all birds do that.
Pekins are the most gentle and inoffensive birds, and may be
kept with perfect safety in any company. They are tremendous
fellows to bathe, and in hot weather are in and out of the water
all day.
I saw, somewhere, that it is not safe to put them in an
aviary, as they steal eggs. I don&amp;apos;t believe it one bit. I have had
them in an aviary with nests all round them, and they never
touched an ^%% or a young bird {b). I have two pairs, at present,
in an aviar3^
I find the best staple food for Pekins is Abrahams&amp;apos; 3&amp;apos;^olk of
^%%\ they are also very fond of white millet, which they swallow
whole. They must have some insect food ; they like mealworms
better than anything else, and will eat small &amp;quot; clocks,&amp;quot; big ones
they can&amp;apos;t swallow. Of course in a large garden aviary they
catch a great many live things for themselves. They are
fond of maggots, and a decaying old hen is to them a joy for
ever -- or at any rate as long as she holds together.
The cock birds sing pretty well, but nothing to boast
about ; the hens do not sing, as so often stated -- they simply
(3) Has Mr. Farrar ever read these words of a well-known writer ? &amp;quot; To deny
what is outside one&amp;apos;s own experience, however large that experience may be, proves it
capable of increase.&amp;quot; -- Ed.
Last month, in one of my aviaries, I had twenty-four eggs and five or six newly-
hatched young eaten by these birds. -- A. G. B.

repeat a few bars as a call note. Talk about &amp;quot;scolding;&amp;quot; but
two Pekins can scold if j^ou go near their nest.
In breeding, of course the first thing is to get a pair. The
only sure way to distinguish the cock from the hen is by the top
of his head, which is always a beautiful mossy green colour,
and his eye markings, which are primrose colour. The hen has
a pale greyish crown and mouse-coloured eye patches. Both
birds have red on their wings and the white tail edging, which
are stated by Dr. Greene to be characteristic of the cocks alone.
Far more hens than cocks are imported.
It is not wise to look for any great breeding results from
Pekins under the most favourable conditions. In a large garden
aviar}^ the best results will be obtained. I utterly refuse to
believe that Pekins would nest in a cage or bird-room. I saw
an account of alleged nesting in a back number of the Reports
of the U. K. F. C. B. S. (c). I say alleged for this reason, that
the description of the young was utterly fallacious.
I have had several near shaves of success in past seasons,
but this year victory has crowned the efforts of my Pekins.
Last 5&amp;apos;ear we got as far as a completed nest ; this year we have
gone two better -- eggs and 5&amp;apos;oung. My Pekins began operations
early in May, by building a beautiful little nest of roots and
fibre, lined with horsehair, in a box tree. The nest is really a
work of art and very cunningly hidden. The hen laid three
eggs, very large for the size of the bird, a bluish white in
colour, heavily blotched with chocolate at the big end. The
parents take it in turn to sit ; the hen takes the day nurs-
ing, and the cock relieves her about 6 p.m. The time of
incubation was about fourteen days. On looking into the
nest very casually as I passed, I was delighted to see two
youngsters and one addled ^&amp;apos;g&amp;apos;g. This disappeared in about three
days, but whether eaten or broken I can&amp;apos;t say. At fii&amp;apos;St the
youngsters were fed from the crop. I saw the whole operation
through a &amp;quot;knot hole&amp;quot; close to the nest. The old birds do not
carry out the excreta, but eat it. After a few days they began to
feed on mealworms, which they first killed ; these did not.
(c) In the Report of the United Kingdom Foreign Cage Bird Society for November,
1891, where an anonymous account of the breeding- of Pekin Nightingales is reprinted
from the Bazaar, Hxc/iangf, and Mart. Tlie account bears every mark of genuineness, and
there seems to be no ground for Mr. Farrar&amp;apos;s suggestion that it is apocryphal.
Whether or not the writer&amp;apos;s observations were in every respect careful and accurate is
of course a different matter, upon which we express no opinion ; but we imagine that
where the anonymous writer and Mr. Farrar differ, the one is, prima facie, as likely to
be right as the other. -- Ed.

fortunatel}^, prove &amp;quot; too stimulating,&amp;quot; as the youngsters evidenced
by their ready enjoyment of them.
Of course I had the good sense and taste not to go poking
about the nest. I did all my observations through a &amp;quot; knot hole,&amp;quot;
where I could see all, myself unseen.
To-day the 3^oung have flown (June nth). They are
queer little things ; dark slate colour all over, with hardly a trace
of eye markings ; no tails ; a tiny yellow edging on the big wing
feathers; pink legs, and horn-coloured beaks. When first
hatched, I forgot to say, they were perfectly naked ; at about the
eighth day they got a sort of bluish colour where the feathers were
coming through, and when next I saw them they were nearly
full feathered. I say pink and naked when hatched for this
reason, that in the account of hatching in the Report of the
U. K. F. C. B. S. the young were spoken of as covered with a
hair}^ sort of fluff, which makes me think that the whole
account was apocryphal. Besides the extraordinary things the
old birds were asked to feed on. &amp;quot;What would they give
the 5&amp;apos;oung ? &amp;quot; I quote from the writer : -- &amp;quot; Egg ? No. Biscuit ?
No. Bread and milk ? No. Crushed hemp seed ? No. Meal-
worms cut up ? Yes.&amp;quot; I wonder what the youngsters did while
these experiments were being tried.
There is such a scolding now each time I go into the aviary
to feed, and it is quite amusing to see how the old birds will wait
about, with their beaks full of mealworms, until I am gone, lest
I should see where the precious babies are hidden.
I might give one word of caution. In sending Pekins on
a journe}^ never forget to put in a sponge of water in the pot, or
the birds will arrive in a moribund condition, and will the next
day shuffle off this mortal coil, if they do not do so the same
night. I will relate my other breeding experiences at the end of
the season ; but I thought our readers would be glad to hear of a
genuine case of Pekins nesting.
Since writing the above the Pekins have built another
nest high up in an Elder tree and have again three eggs. I have
however, taken the nest, as I have a Virginian Nightingale
setting in the same aviary, due to hatch, and cannot aflbrd to
keep both.

<bodyText confidence="0.987853568181818" page_id="32635623"  page_num="180" year="" vol="">
Sir, -- In the last October number of the Avicultural Magazine,
Mr. Moerschell wrote: &amp;quot;Some years ago a friend of mine had eggs from a
Virginian cock and a Green Cardinal hen, but somehow they were all
broken, but it would be worthy an attempt, provided a very quiet place
could be given, and a liberal supply of mealworms.&amp;quot;
Having at that time just completed building a new aviary, and having
both these birds in a mixed aviary, I thought I would try the experiment,
more especially as the green hen had killed already four small birds
{selecting always those approaching her own colour).
The cock I have had in an outdoor aviary through three winters, and
the hen two.
The aviary I placed them in was divided into two, one part all
covered in with wood and glass, which I use for canary breeding, the other
part an open wire flight (in which I placed the birds) 6 ft. x 6 ft. x 6 ft.,
partly covered on the top with three sides open, and on the fourth side
covered with Virginian cork to within two feet of the ground. The hen
started building about five weeks ago, making a nest among the cork, much
like a Blackbird&amp;apos;s nest, and laid three eggs much like those of a Thrush,
but longer in shape ; I interfered ver}&amp;apos; little with her, so I was unable to
tell to a few days when the eggs were laid. On Saturday last, wishing to
show a friend the somewhat peculiar-shaped eggs, I found to my surprise
two were hatched, and the young are now three days old.
To my great sorrow the cock escaped the following day ; he remained
about the garden all day singing his loudest, but about six o&amp;apos;clock I lost
sight and hearing of him, and I much fear I shall never see him again.
The hen seems quite indifferent to his going, and continues feeding and
.sitting on her young. It will be interesting to know what colour the birds
will be from two so differently coloured parents. I learn from those who
have bred the Green Cardinal that the hen leaves the feeding of the young
after leaving the nest to the cock, so I much fear that the absence of the
cock will be fatal to the young.
Mr. Moerschell saj&amp;apos;s he gave amongst his food fineh&amp;apos; minced meal-
worms, but I find my hen prefers to take them whole, biting them down
herself to a convenient size. lam giving besides, &amp;&amp;apos;g^ and biscuit, boiled
millet, sunflower seeds, ants&amp;apos; eggs, and plain millet, hemp, and canary,
with a few oats, and much green food.
I was greath&amp;apos; surprised to find the eggs fertile as the two birds appeared
perfectly indifferent to each other since they have been together. The
cock has been singing at his best this year, but last 5&amp;apos;ear he scarcely sang
a note.
I must apologise for my rather lengthy letter, btit, as I believe this is
the first recorded cross between these two Cardinals, the matter may be of
interest to many of our members.

Sir, -- Ornithological classification is a fine field for controversy, for
no two writers agree, and each is persuaded that he alone is right and
everyone else wrong. No doubt Dr. Butler and I could go on for a good
many months with this very pretty dispute as to whether or not it is more
improper to call a Nightingale a Warbler than to call a Tanager a Finch ;
and he ought to get the best of it, for is he not a big scientific man, and I
only a little aviculturist ? No doubt for every &amp;quot; authority &amp;quot; I could quote
it vsrould be easy for him to cite two on the opposite side-- such is the
charming finality of this puzzling branch of science.
&amp;quot; But scientists, who ought to know,
Assure us that they must be so.
Oh ! let us never, never doubt
What nobod}^ is sure about ! &amp;quot;
I will therefore content myself with asking a few questions, and then
leave the matter, (i) Are not the Sylviidce according to Dr. Sliarpe,
Mr. Howard Saunders, and Dr. Btitler himself, included in the family
Turdida ? (2) Are not the Tanagridce placed in a separate family by Dr. Sharpe
and most modern ornithologists, none of whom include them in the
FringillidcE ? (3) Are not birds in the same family presumably more nearly
related than those in different families ? {4) If all these questions be
answered in the afiRrmative, as I think they must be, how does Dr. Butler
justify his statement that the Nightingale &amp;quot;is about as nearly related to
the Warblers as the Tanagers are &amp;quot; } (ej
I could only think, for the moment, of two Foreign cage-birds which
would reqiiire treatment similar to that of our Nightingale, and Dr. Butler
very properly reminds me that one of these belongs to the British list --
tliiis strengthening mj&amp;apos; argument that nearly all the foreign soft-billed birds
imported are frugivorous rather than sti&amp;apos;ictly insectivorous. I am glad that
Dr. Butler is disposed to admit that there may be a better food for
Nightingales than the mixture of Abrahams&amp;apos; Food, preserved &amp;^%. potato,
and bread, which I understand he prescribes for all other birds, and I hope
that he will continue his experiments, and in course of time come to the
conclusion, which most of lis have come to long ago, that there is no such
thing as a universal food for soft-billed birds, but that every group requires
different treatment. So long as he sticks to the idea that all soft-billed
birds will thrive on the same food, whether it be xlbrahams&amp;apos; Food or some-
body else&amp;apos;s, he must pardon me for drawing a distinction, in ni}&amp;apos; own mind,
between the avicultiire of a scientist and &amp;quot;scientific aviculture.&amp;quot; I learn
from a recent letter of his in the Feathered World that he uses six to eight
large tins of Abrahams&amp;apos; Food per month. Has it never struck him that he
is paying rather dearly for the ^^g and ants&amp;apos; eggs contained in it }
Septimus Perkins.
This discussion has been the means of eliciting much useful informa-
tion, and I am ver}&amp;apos; grateful to those who have given us the benefit of their
experience. I am sorry to find that it seems now in danger of degenerating
into a rather personal controversy on points which have little or nothing to
(e) Birds in the same family are often far less nearly related than those in different
families. The Frini^illidie and Ploceidce differ chiefly in their manner of building-.-- A. G. B.

\0x25A0do -with the main question. Surely there must still be a large number of
members who can and will contribute something of value and interest to the
discussion ?
I think that novices sometimes overlook the importance of making
the food of a proper consistency. It is essential to a good food not only
that the materials should be right but that it should be properly prepared.
Generalh^ speaking, food for &amp;quot;soft-bills &amp;quot; should be &amp;quot; crumbly-moist,&amp;quot; and
never sloppy on the one hand nor sticky and claj&amp;apos;-like on the other. Nor,
again, should it be a dry powder. Many have a prejudice against milk-sop,
\0x25A0on the ground that it is too laxative. It certainly is laxative if given either
in too great quantit}&amp;apos;, or too slopp}% or sweetened. I make it of powdered
lunch biscuit, on which I pour hot boiled milk, and give it to the birds
ujisiveetened, and fairly stiff (too stiff to find its own level). I never allow
any birds (except Lories and Lorikeets) to live entirely or even chieflv on
sop, but most of mine have a little ever}^ day, and I find that it is miich
appreciated and apparentl}&amp;apos; beneficial. It is a cheap and easy-made food,
and will keep fresh for twenty-four hours. Another cause of non-success
with the more delicate birds is, I think, allowing them to eat white of egg,
which is ver}^ indigestible. Either the yolk onl}&amp;apos; of fi&amp;quot;e.sh eggs, or preserved
\0x25A0&amp;&amp;apos;g%, should be used.

liappens but the unexpected. If there is one species more than another
where I should have said you need never hope to find the &amp;quot; ideal,&amp;quot; it
would have been the Alexandrine.
I never knew of one that was not intolerably noisy, at times. I think
the Bengal comes very near the ideal, but for noise; it is lovely, an excellent
talker, and full of character.
It is curious that &amp;quot;Ton}&amp;apos;,&amp;quot; who, I presume, was a cock, should have
preferred men. Bengals, certainly, have a strong perception of sex, and so
have &amp;quot;docilis&amp;apos;&amp;apos; -- generally the hens can be handled by men and the cocks
\0x25A0by women. I had a lovely cock Bengal and an exquisite &amp;quot; Jociiis.&amp;quot; A
woman could do anything with either, Init the}&amp;apos; could not be trusted with
men.
I should like to know hoza &amp;quot; Tony &amp;quot; was trained to be clean. And
also how he came by his death.
I think the true ideal is most likely to turn up in the Senegal,
Meyer&amp;apos;s, or Riippell&amp;apos;s Parrots. As far as colour and charm are concerned,
Mr. FuUjames&amp;apos; &amp;quot; Shining Parrakeet &amp;quot; would have done. But he is not a

MYNAHS.
Sir, -- Kindly let me know what species of Mynali you consider the
best mimic and talker ? Also, food and general treatment.
Charles Speed.
The follo7ving reply was sent to Mr. Speed.
The Mynah that mimics and talks best is the Larger Hill-Mynah,
llainatus intermediiis. Much depends on its being a young bird, as when
old it does not pick up new sounds nearl}&amp;apos; so readih--. The males are
usually better mimics than the females ; the former may often be
distinguished b}&amp;apos; their bills being larger and more hooked, at any rate
when of about the same age. Their talking powers are sometimes greatly
exaggerated, the curious natural notes of the species being twisted into
words by the niiglit}^ power of imagination. Nevertheless, some of them
do talk and mimic, and they can be made into very nice pets. Just now
and then the huge Javan lM3-nah (Mainatus javanensis) appears in the-
market. It is a magnificent bird, and ought to talk well ; but I have not
kept it, and cannot sa}^ whether it does.
I have been told repeatedly that it is the vSmall Hill-MjMiah
{Mainatus religiosiis) that is the talker ; l)ut my own pei&amp;apos;sonal experiences
and observations have taught me exacth&amp;apos; the contrary. It is a nice bird
enough, with quaint notes, but it is not to be compared with the Larger
Hill-Mynah.
The Hill-Mynahs are sometimes known as Rock-Mynahs.
They are all large eaters, and should be fed on sop, fruit, cooked
vegetables (boiled rice, carrots, &amp;c.), &amp;^g^j raisins, and messes generally.
In this climate, at an}- rate, I think they should have a little meat.
They are rather offensive when kept in the house in a small cage,
though they may learn to talk better under those conditions ; but for their
health the more exercise you can give them the better. In the summer, a
garden aviar}- is the place for them, but they should not be exposed to
cold ; and, like their relations the Starlings, they dearh^ love something
of the nature of a box to sleep in at night, especiall}- during the winter.

OUR BRITISH WBAVBR-BIRD.
Sir, -- The vulgar Sparrow is one of the last birds one would think of
naming as capable of constructing a clever or artistic nest, but, when he is
put to it, he is by no means such a duffer at house-building as is generally
supposed ; aviculturists who may happen to pass by the gardens of the
Tower of London just at the present time of the year, before the leaves are
fully out, maj&amp;apos; see this for themselves. (_/) A number of the trees in this city

oasis are adorned (?) with half a dozen or more big ronnd bristly balls of
rubbish, looking at a little distance like so many strange fruits ; presumably
the Tower itself and the giant warehouses near by do not offer the necessary
holes and corners, so Mr. Sparrow is obliged to take to the trees ; and when
one considers that the material available for building consists of more or
less dirty straw, with say about ten per cent, of string, paper, rags, and
shavings mixed, and an occasional pigeon&amp;apos;s feather, it must be acknowledged
that the result is a highlj&amp;apos; creditable production. Finish, of course, there is
none; but the way in which the bird gets a start with such unpromising
material, making the nest not infrequently among thin twigs near the top
of the tree, is reall}&amp;apos; clever ; and the fact that it takes some six or seven
months of wind and weather to demolish it after it is done with, speaks
well for the strength with which it must be woven together. This type of
Sparrow&amp;apos;s nest is common enough, it is true, but the number that one sees
together at the Tower, and elsewhere in the cit}&amp;apos;, makes it particularly
striking.

THE YEIvIvOW-FRONTED AMAZON.
Sir, -- Having recently purchased a Yellow-fronted Amazon Parrot,
and not being very well up in the Fsittacidce, I should be glad of a little
information on the following points : -- \0x25A0
Are the sexes distinguishable, and is there anj-thing to choose
between them as far as talking powers are concerned }
Is the Yellow-fronted Amazon as apt a scholar as the Blue-fronted
and other species, aiul after how long can one reasonably expect a newly
imported bird to make any attempt at speech, i.e., when everj&amp;apos; encourage-
ment is offered .&amp;apos;&amp;apos;
The bird in question sneezes and coughs rather often, and, after
feeding, seems to get dull, half closing its eyes and ruffling its feathers ;
there is also, occasionally, a watery discharge at the nostrils ; does this
indicate the existence of pneumonia, or is it merel}^ a cold 1
Any information will be much appreciated by
H. C. Martin.
The foUoTving 7-eply zvas sent to Mr. Martin : --
I have been desired to answer 5&amp;apos;our letter. I think the male Yellow-
fronted is as good a talker as the Blue-fronted Amazon, but I doubt an old
and untaught bird learning to speak. A young one should begin to say
something within two or three months of importation.
The males have, I think, a larger yellow cap than the females, [g)
The bird, I think, has a cold. I should keep it warm, and give it
chillies, and, if it eats sop, put a few drops of Tabasco sauce with it.
F. G. Button.
[g] I niav be mistaken, but I think the sexes differ in the colour of the iris.-- A. G.

On March 23rd, the new pair seemed anxious to nest ; and
in an impulsive moment, which I have not ceased to regret, I
brought down the old nest and placed it in its original position.
With a cry of joy the widow flew to it -- perhaps hoping to find
her mate, who can say ! but she was promptly dispossessed by
the pair, who seemed inclined to adopt it as their own forthwith ;
their triumph, however, was short-lived, for the other birds, now
a miscellaneous horde, got wind of what was going on, and,,
headed by two rascally Ivavender Finches who still trouble me
with their looting propensities, swooping down like Vultures on.
to a carcase, tore the nest to shreds, and carried it off&amp;quot; piecemeal
to various boxes and holes, in spite of the White-ears&amp;apos; piteous
cries of remonstrance.
The pair could not tear themselves away from the flower-
pot. There might be time for a nest before their season was
quite over I thought, so shut off the other birds, supplied
materials, and placed a box on the floor where the former had
been (of which they had not any cognizance), and of this they
immediately took possession. A nest was quickly built in the
flower-pot as before, very like the first but not so carefully con-
structed -- the dome, for instance, barely supporting its own
weight and requiring frequent pushing up from the interior,
many of the feathers being shoved through ; and the beard was
not so long -- possibly on account of the now shrivelled condition
of the creeper. Little by little, however, the birds seemed to lose
interest in it, there came a time when they actually slept in it,
and then I saw that it was of no use, put them back with their
companions, and removed the nest. A wave of warm weather
once more started them off, so I brought back their nest, which

they themselves quickl)^ pulled to pieces. Once again they set
to work, and tried to build in a pot containing a geranium ; but
the plant did not leave them sufficient room, so I placed a little
Idox by its side, of which they thankfully took possession, and in
which they built -- a squatting-place, so there is an end of the
matter for this summer.
It was the nest built by the second pair which has been
pictured by our artist, who has artfully brought into prominence
*one of the seeming peculiarities of the species, the profuse use
\0x25A0of feathers in the building of the nest, the whole interior of each
nest having been very thickly lined with them. Last year my
pair of Long-tails never touched a feather in the construction
\0x25A0either of their squatting-places, or of two nests which they built
late in the year : and Mr. Todd&amp;apos;s experience in this respect seems
to have been similar (Vol. iii., p. 210). But this year the male of
at any rate one of my two pairs has occasionally been seen with
a feather in his bill ; the Parson Finch, I think, often uses a few
feathers ; but neither species of Gouldian has ever touched a
feather with me.
The following is a rough description of the White-eared
Orassfinch. Upper parts a rather dark fawn, darker and more
glossy on the crown ; lower back, upper and under tail-coverts,
white, with some black on the sides of the upper coverts ; tail
feathers black with brownish bases, graduated ; a black mask
round base of bill, as in pasonata ; cheeks and ear-coverts,
silvery white ; chest, breast, etc., white washed with light buff,
especially across the chest ; a large black flank-patch with white
blotch in front ; iris, dark brown ; bill, whitish yellow in life, and
much lighter than in personata, but in skin dull and inclined to
iDlackish ; feet and legs, coral red ; length, slightly over 4J inches.
Sexes alike ; and in this it possibly differs ixom personata, for my
male personata has much the larger and more curved bill, and
seems to be the larger bird. M}^ male lezicotis occasionally
seems to be stouter in the chest than the females ; but now that
the nesting is over I am often quite unable to pick him out
from amongst the others. Although usually remarkably peace-
able, lately they have taken to quarrel when going to roost ; the
male commenced by ejecting the male Mask whilst retaining the
female in the Mormon bed-chamber -- and I retaliated by removing
the Masks, male and female. And again later the Widow has
been forbidden the family sleeping-box, and has philosophicallj^
built a little squatting-place for herself on the floor behind the,
bottom of one of the window curtains.

At pages 202 and 203, vol. xiii., of the Cat. Birds Brit. Mus.,
the distinctive difference between the genera Aidemosyne and
Pi^^/Zzz&amp;apos;/^ is given as {o\\q\^s:-- Aidemosyne: Tair graduated, the
two centre feathers longest, but not produced to a thread-like
point. Poephila : Tail not so strongly graduated, but the centre
feathers produced to a thread-like point. I have had five White-
ears and three Masks. My male Mask seems to be fully adult,
the female I have had for over fourteen mouths, and they are
both in perfect feather; when recently placed in the garden,
neither had a thread-like point to the central tail feathers,
although these were long and very narrow towards the ends.
Nor have any of the White-ears ; nevertheless it is possible that
this feature may be developed later.
Habitat, the grassy plains in the interior of North
Australia.
Before closing this paper I should like to draw attention
to the curious way in which the six recognised species in the
genus Poephila are grouped in couples, the two species forming
each couple being remarkably like to one another, but very
different from all the others. First come the handsome Long-
tailed Grassfinch, P. acuticauda, and the familiar Parson Finch,
P. cinda, with their black girdles and throat spots, surly tempers,
and rapid flight, chiefly differing from one another in the colour
of the bill and in the formation of the tail ; the sexes are alike
(I am speaking cursorily), and the young like the parents but
with black bills (vol. iii. p. 210). Then come the Masked Grass-
finch, P. personata, and the White-ear, with black flank-patch
instead of girdle, and mask instead of large throat-spot, amiable
in temper, quiet in habits, and sexes alike. The j^oung of leucotis
seem to be unknown, but doubtless they will prove to be, as
-with perso7iata, like their parents but with black bills. All of
these four roost, from preference, in boxes or squatting-places
of some kind ; and none of them sing in the manner that
the Gouldians do. Lastly, we have Gould&amp;apos;s Grassfinch, P.
gouldicB, and the Beautiful Grassfinch, P. mirabilis, popularly
classed together as Gouldians. In these the sexes are diverse,
and the ^-oung, while like to one another (on this point the
Cat. Birds Brit. Mus. is inaccurate), are quite different from the
adults. They have neither black girdle nor flank- patch, never
use feathers in the construction of their nests, and always roost
in the open (towards the ends of the slender boughs of growing
trees if possible, often quite amongst the leaves) except when
actually sitting. Specimens that are ^rt&amp;apos;/.fr/r /^&amp;apos;\0x25A0^^/ moult true to
colour year after 3^ear ; and the two species are at any rate as

distinct from one another as are leiccotis from pe^^sonata, and cinda
from acuticazcda.
Probably the species occasionally referred to as Poephila
atropygialis is /*. acuticauda. Being personally unacquainted
with Poephila armitiana, I will simply quote &amp;quot; May be looked
upon as the golden- or yellow-headed phase of P. inirabilis..
Hab. Derby, N.W. Australia, Gulf of Carpentaria.&amp;quot;
The statements in the Cat. Birds Brit. Mus. of the total
length of the different species of Poephila cannot be accepted as
correct.
THE SONG OF THE SCARLET TANAGER.
By Arthur G. Butler, Ph. D.
In an article on the Songs of Tauagers (at p. 46 of this
year&amp;apos;s Magazine) I say of the Scarlet Tanager, &amp;quot; When I have
kept my two fine males long enough for them to become con-
fiding, perhaps they will give me an opportunity of forming an
opinion respecting the merit of their performance.&amp;quot;
At the commencement of July of the present year one
of my males began to sing, and he has continued to do so
industriously, whenever the sun has shone hotly into his flight-
cage, up to the present time.
The song is soft, not unpleasing, and is perhaps capable
of further development ; but hitherto I have not noticed any
striking resemblance to the notes of either Thrush or Robin in
its performance ; excepting that, as with the Thrush, the first
note is repeated four times and all the other expressions or
double notes are repeated : they are, however, at present too soft
and gentle to remind one of a Thrush, and the general effect is
rather that of the White-throated Finch&amp;apos;s melody.
On the iSth of July, I took down the song as the bird
uttered it, and carefully went over it afterwards : I render it as
follows; -- &amp;quot; Whip, tvhip, zvhip, whip ; tzeivee, tsewee, tzezvee ; cheo,
cheo, cheo, cheo, cheo, cheo, cheo ; tzcTwiss, tserwiss, tzerwiss ; cheo,
cheo, cheo, cheo, cheo, cheo, cheo.
The cheo part of the song is very liquid and always uttered
seven times rapidl}^
I see no likeness in any part of this song to the irregular
plaintive trill of the Robin.

GRASSHOPPER-WARBLER.
By Percy W. Fakmborough, F.Z.S.
During the past few months there has been a great deal of
discussion in the correspondence columns of our Magazine on
the subject of the Warblers in captivity, and it occurred to me
that I might supplement others&amp;apos; experiences with my own.
Some time ago, having occasion to spend a short time at
Sandwich in Kent, I noticed that several specimens of the
Grasshopper Warbler {Locustella ncEvia) were flying about the
sand}^ downs skirting the sea-shore at a point situated about
midwaj^ between Deal and the estuary of the river Stour. For
several days I made persistent efforts to discover the nests and
eggs of these birds, but signally failed until about a week after
commencing the senrch, when I was rewarded \yy finding a nest
containing unfledged j^oung placed rather deeply in a coarse tuft
of sedge-grass (I think that that is the name of the grass I
mean, it grows in tufts, is cylindrical and about two feet long)
which I must have passed by and examined a score of times
at least before I found the nest ; and even on this occasion the
nest would not have been found if it were not for the fact that
the hen was flushed from the tuft of grass, thus drawing my
attention to it.
The spot was marked, and, about nine or ten days after-
wards, was visited once again. The young were fledged and very
shy, cowering down into the nest and striving to make themselves
as unobserved as possible. As I was returning to town that day,
I took the brood, doubting whether they could be successfully
reared. For a few da5&amp;apos;S they lived, being fed on yolk of 0^%%
mixed with ants&amp;apos;-eggs and milk, but one by one they sickened
and died.
A week later, I was obliged to go once again to Sandwich,
and, only having a couple of days to spare, I took a small trap-
cage and a tin box of mealworms down with me, in addition to a
very powerful field-glass -- one magnifying to i8 diameters.
After transacting my business I retired to rest, and was up
betimes the next morning. The clock was striking three as
I was crossing the downs to my post of observation. The
morning was beautifully clear, and bird-life was well manifested.
The trap (a single one) was baited with a few mealworms, and
carefully set in a large bed or clump of grass-growth covering
</bodyText>

igo
about thirty square j^ards of ground, and situated about sixty or
seventy yards from the sea-shore. That the birds were about
was evidenced by the occasional utterance of the grasshopper-
like call. I took up a position about one hundred or a hundred
and fifty yards away, and, lying down in another expanse of
sedge-grass, carefully covered any likely tufts or hillocks with
the field-glass. Owing to the high power of the field-glass, the
field of vision was limited, and as a conseqence it took some
time to go over the likely places. Alter a considerable time had
elapsed, a bird suddenly sprang into the air not twenty yards
from where I was lying, and flew off ; it was joined in a few
moments by two companions, and the three, to my delight, took
a wavering flight to where the cage was. It was impossible to
see the cage from the position I occupied, so it was necessary to^
be contented with keeping the glasses on the birds as they
fluttered about the mass of herbage. Every now and again the^
disappeared from sight, but suddenly two flew upwards and
went away uttering notes of alarm. As the third did not
accompany them, I concluded the trap had been successful, and,
on going over to investigate, I found that to be the case,,
for a fine young Grasshopper Warbler was inside the cage,
fluttering wildly in its attempts to escape. As it was tolerably-
certain no more would be caught, that day at all events, I packed
up and went back to where I was staying. The bird had to be
left in the trap-cage it was caught in, as there was nothing else
to change it into until it got to L,ondon ; once there, however, it
was put into its intended home -- a larger cage of box pattern,,
about two feet long and of proportionate height and breadth --
where it was left for the night.
It was fed whilst in my possession on ants&amp;apos;-eggs mixed
with a crumbly paste of hard-boiled yolk of egg and milk, with
a few mealworms now and again. The bird only survived its
captivity three months, and I am not altogether satisfied with
my experience of it. Perhaps I did not feed it properly ;,
probably it pined at the loss of its freedom ; but one day,
although previously it had seemed in the best of health, it was
found on the floor of its cage -- dead. I cannot say I am pleased
with myself for my capture, I often wish now that I had left the
bird to enjoy its freedom. The Warblers seem particularly ill-
adapted to a life of captivity, or else my experience has been an
unfortunate one, for, with the exception of a Blackcap (^Sylvia,
atricapilla) which lived for some time (nearly two and a half
years), they have all died in a few weeks.

DOVES.
By A. G. Butler, Ph. D.
The facts which I propose to record here are probably not
new to many of our members ; but circumstances have proved
to me that they are not so thoroughly well known to all bird-
students as to be valueless.
It is generally admitted that where a male bird possesses-
brilliant colours in any part of its plumage, it alwa5^s makes the
most of them when approaching its mate. In many of the
CohtmbcE the most telling arrangement of colours is to be found
on the nape, mantle, and in the open tail : it is therefore not
surprising that the species of Turhcr and Geopelia bow almost to
the ground, at the same time drooping the wings and raising the
tail fan-wise almost at right angles to the body.
During tlie past winter I lost my male Necklaced Dove
and my female Bar-shouldered Dove. Thinking that I might,
safely pair up the two bereaved birds, I placed them together in
one of my small aviaries, but Geopelia humeralis evidently did.
not admire lurhcr tigrhnts and attacked her so systematically
that when he had half denuded her of feathers, I was compelled to
remove her and purchase a supposed female of his own species : I
fear, however, that I paired up these birds too late or too early,,
for she fared but little better than her predecessor (a).
When I first turned in the &amp;apos; female &amp;apos; G. humeralis, the male
began at once to chase her about the aviary : this was followed
by the usual posture of worship. When neither bowing nor
chasing seemed to awake any emotion of pleasure in the heart,
of his partner the male suddenly turned his back upon her, raised,
his head to its highest elevation, spread his tail fanwise so that
it swept the earth and ran forward two or three steps with a short
sharp little gutteral sound, then looked over his shoulder and
repeated the action perhaps a dozen times. His rage when she
ignored all his efforts was unbounded and he then commenced a
system of tyrannous persecution, varied with occasional fondlings,
which bade fair to reduce her to a scarecrow. However, it is
evident that G. hiirneralis has two very distindt methods of
showing off to its hen ; which was a new fact to me.
In the Australian Crested Dove ( Ocyphaps lophotesj the
(rt) I finally discovered that the bird was only a small cock of the same species, and.
had to separate them.-- A. G. B.

larger and median wing coverts are brilliantly coloured with,
ultramarine changing to ruby red, and emerald green changing
to golden green : therefore, if this bird were to display itself
exactly in the same manner as Tiu-tur and Geopelia, its chief
beauty would be concealed : it does indeed bow and spread its
tail fanwise ; but, instead of drooping its wings tlie}^ are lifted
backwards so that the coverts almost join and form a glittering
rainbow of colours behind the head as the bird bows.
In Phlogcenas luzonica (the Bleeding-heart Pigeon) the
most brilliant colouring is on the breast and this bird rarely
hows to its hen, but races after her at full speed with its long
legs, its outstretched neck bobbing as it runs : then as it nears
her it depresses its tail, throws out its breast, retracts its head
and utters a very ventriloquial coo, rocking on its feet as if the
utterance disturbed its balance ; at other times it slightly raises
and quivers its wings cooing in a rapid staccato fashion --
gu-g2i-gti-gti-gu-gii.
I never saw Tympanistria show off to its mate, and suspect
that it is far too sluggish to breed in any but a very large aviary,
and my experience of Calcenas yiicobarica is the same ; doubtless
Mr. Meade-Waldo, who has bred the latter species pretty freel}&amp;apos;-,
could enlighten us as to its method of displaying its charms.
Chalcophaps and Phaps are genera of rather sluggish but
very beautiful birds, and I am not sure whether what I have seen
them do was intended as an attraction or an insult to their wives,
but I have seen them approach the hen and lift up the wing
farthest from her, so as to expose all the metallic feathers
*simultaneously : I have seen them do this when sidling up to
another dove to give him a smack so that it may not have been
intended as an overture of affection, but it was extremely
heautiful for all that. {U)
The species of Zejiaida, which are chiefly ornamented on
the neck, appear to me to show themselves off like our domestic
Pigeons, but I have not studied them intimately enougli to be
\0x25A0quite sure of ni)^ facts yoX, though I have had a pair of
Z. aicriaciata for twelve months. Z. azwita I have only added
recently.
By the way, it seems curious that Zenaida should be

namely, by bowing- the head, expanding the tail and spreading the wings over the back,
thus presenting to the hen a shield of brilliant metallic colours. At the same time the
hird sways its body from side to side, balancing its weight first on one leg and then on the
other. I have also seen it bow and spread the tail like an English Woodpigeon or the
various species of Geopelia. -- D. S.-S.

REVIEWS.
Song Birds ; a Paper read before the National British Bird and
Mule Club, by Mr. Albert Rettich.
Our readers know Mr. Rettich, and they do not need to be
told that his writings are always both practical and interesting.
The paper now before us the author modestly acknowledges to
be largely a translation from a German Avicultural Journal -- he
is not the only avicultural writer who has borrowed from German
\0x25A0sources, and such a course is much to be commended, for
\0x25A0German avicultural literature is undoubtedly ahead of our own.
We are surprised at the veiy high estimation, as a songster,
in which the Garden Warbler appears to be held, by German
aviculturists.
A Mr. Heppe, who seems to be a man of great experience,
is quoted as an authority against giving too niau}^ mealworms
to delicate birds, -- &amp;quot; The armour - like skin of the inse(5t, he
#nds productive of indigestion, of clogging, swelling, and
cramp in the feet, and other disorders.&amp;quot; He giv^s fresh ants&amp;apos;
"eggs in the summer and no mealworms, and but few in the
\0x25A0winter.
It is a pity that this interesting paper should be printed
in such very small type.

&amp;quot; As a set-off against the many interesting (British) species that we
&amp;apos; have lost for ever, it is gratifying to know that the spread of cultivation
&amp;apos; and the improvement of waste land, so disastrous to the larger birds, has
&amp;apos; favoured the increase and dispersal of considerable numbers of the smaller
&amp;apos; species. Many of these latter birds are songsters of varying merit, and
&amp;apos; these have followed the horticulturist and the agriculturist, so that many
&amp;apos; districts are now made glad with song which formerly were silent. The-
&amp;apos; boom of the Bittern has died awa}&amp;apos; with the disappearance of marsh and
&amp;apos; fen ; the song of the Passere is heard in its place. This, in a measure, is-
&amp;apos; some compensation for our loss. In some districts, however, many of the
&amp;apos; smaller birds have been ruthlessly depleted by the gunner and the snarer ;
&amp;apos; and we can name localities where such species as Goldfinches, Bullfinches,
&amp;apos; Hawfinches, Wood Larks, Nuthatches, and Kingiishers are altogether
&amp;apos; exterminated or fast becoming so. Certain intelligently-framed Amend-
&amp;apos; ments to the Acts for the Preservation of Wild Birds, and the establishment
&amp;apos; of proper machinery for the enforcement of the existing law, should
&amp;apos; remedy the evil. The wholesale destruction of the nests and eggs of the
&amp;apos; smaller birds that goes on in most country districts mnst have a most
&amp;apos; injurious effect upon the species, and is even worse than the destruction
&amp;apos; of the birds themselves. Kggs to some extent are now protected, but the
&amp;apos; law in most places is ntterh^ ignored.&amp;quot;
Mr. Dixon lays little stress upon the alleged depredations-
of bird-catchers, and we presume that he considers that they are
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.976527090909091" page_id="32635637"  page_num="194" year="" vol="">
responsible for only a small fra6lion of the destru(5lion which,
goes on. This coincides with our own views, for we believe that,,
with the exception of the Goldfinches, there is scarcelj^ a British
species whose numbers have been seriously reduced by the
capture of specimens for cage or aviary. We cordially approve
of the policy of the Wild Bird Protedlion Adts, and consider
that indiscriminate bird-catching should be prevented -- but we
firmly believe that few, if any, of our British species are in any
danger from bird-catchers alone, and that they are often blamed
for what has really been caused by game-keepers, so-called
&amp;quot; scientific colle(5lors,&amp;quot; the more ignorant among the farmers,,
and last, but not least, the village hobbledehoys.
Mr. Dixon is disposed to laugh at the outcry often made
about the slaughter of some very rare bird which has wandered
to our shores, and considers that the killing of such specimens is-
perfedll}&amp;apos; justifiable, as the species would never become indigenous,
and the solitary wanderer would probably perish from hunger
if not shot. This may be all very trvie in theory, but we cannot,
agree with it in practice, for the species is seldom identified
until after the bird has been killed, and a man with a gun in his
hand, on the look out for rare birds, will not stop to consider
whether or not the bird at which he is aiming is sufficiently

Sir, -- The last paragraph in Mr. A. Crafer&amp;apos;s letter raises a subject
which has given me a lot of thought : -- the wanton destruction of birds
and their eggs. I am afraid no real good will be done until there is a
society formed (on similar lines to the R.S.P.C.A.) whose special object shall
be to protect the birds and eggs {c). I know some people argue that birds are-
as plentiful as ever they were; well, they maj&amp;apos; be in some parts, but I am
sorr}^ to say that here in Yorkshire it is not so. I remember when I was a
lad seeing Goldfinches flying by the dozen, and hearing my father talk of
hundreds, but now, alas, where are they .&amp;apos; I have not seen a dozen out of
cages in as many years. The last I saw \vere a pair crossing the road near
Scarbro&amp;apos; ; and the next day that I went past there was the bird-catcher,
call-birds and all. I felt that I would like to give him a ducking in the
sea ; an3&amp;apos;\vay it would have given him a wash, a thing he very much
needed. I am not against keeping bii&amp;apos;ds in captivity, far from it, providing
they are caught out of the breeding season and properly cared for, but
when I see a dirty, filthy thief, too lazy to work, catching birds to get
money to booze, I think it is time that something were done to protect
our song birds from extermination. I have no doubt that there are a few
respectable Ijird-catchers here and there, but the best of them are not the
kindest of individuals. What do they do with those they cannot sell, hen
Linnets, for instance ? I once asked one the question, he said: &amp;quot;Oh, we
kill them; we cannot be bothered with them.&amp;quot; I do not include in my
condemnation the working-man who catches a few for his own iise -- only
the seven-days-a-week man.
I am afraid the Wild Birds&amp;apos; Protection Act is dying a natural death ;
and if something be not done to remedy the existing state of things many
of our most desirable birds will be altogether extinct. What is the use of
fining a man 7s. 6d. for shooting a bird when he has sold it for #*] ? No,
the Act should be amended so that the bird (or eggs) should be confiscated
and go to the public museum in the town or county where taken ; and if
it could be proved that anyone has bought it, or tried to buy it, he
should be fined as well as the man who killed or caught it. This, and
nothing less, will stop the wanton destruction that is now going on, and
which every right-minded man must deplore. I hope some of our
influential members will give this their serious thought, and tr}- and get the
Act amended so as to make it more effectual. Then may we hope to see the

FAMILY CHARACTERS IN BIRDS.
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.983457382978724" page_id="32635639"  page_num="196" year="" vol="">
Sir, -- A remark in Mr. Perkins&amp;apos; letter in the last numlDer of the
Magazine is worth consideration ; as it appears that the importance of
family characters is somewhat over-estimated by some aviculturists. As a
matter of fact families are mere conveniences for the cabinet-naturalist, and
are often based upon a single structural peculiarity which alone unites
certain very distinct sub-families.
Sub-families of different families lua}&amp;apos; be ver\&amp;apos; closely related in all
respects, excepting that which has been seized upon by the systematist as a
distinctive family character; whilst sub-families having this character in
common, may differ far more in other respects.
In the family Turdidcz, the lurdince are naturally distinguishable from
the Syl-viiiicB by their spotted young, a character most important when
considering the question of affinity ; on the other hand the young of
Warblers are not spotted, and it is evident that they are a perfectly separate
branch of the Thrush-like stock; indeed their clearly scaled tarsi
distinguish them at once from the Tiirdina, in which the front of the foot
(popularly known as leg) is quite smooth and undivided until just before
the junction with the claws (digits).
The two families Fiingillida and Ploceidce are even more nearly
related than most of the bird-families, for they differ chiefly in the relative
length of the first primary and its covert ; so that, whereas the first primary
may be even longer in a genus of t3&amp;apos;pical Finches than in a genus of
Weaving-finches, it is not apparent, owing to the greater length of the
covert. It is true that the Weaving-finches build cave-like nests, whilst
most typical finches build open nests; but the ^q.\\\xs, Phonipara {\\\\\q.\\ has
been placed b}&amp;apos; scientists in the Fruigillida:) builds like a Waxbill ; whilst
the species of Passer build purse -shaped nests somewhat approaching in
character those of certain Grass-finches.
It seems to me that the mere habit of eating fruit and the notching
of the upper mandible to that end, although it may serve as a good family
distinction, affords no evidence of long separation in point of time. In the
family Icterida we have both fruit-eaters and seed-eaters, -- Hang-nests and
Troupials ; but I must admit that I believe the Troupials to be indistinguish-
able from triie Starlings (which also eat seed voluntarily when they can get
it) unless the fact that they nest on or near the ground, like some of the
Buntings, be regarded as sufiEciently important to warrant their separation
from the hole-breeders.
In like manner I doubt whether the New World Bush-creepers are
distinct from the Old World Warblers, the supposed nine-primar}&amp;apos; distinction
hetween the Mniotiltidcs and Sylviincz being a fiction : perhaps some more
learned student of ornithology among our members can suggest a reliable
family difference between these birds.

THE EAvSTFRN NIGHTINGALE OR SPROSSER.

name of the &amp;quot; Nightingale Thrush &amp;quot; ?

In answer to enquiries from a man who has advertised one, he writes,
&amp;quot; The Nightingale Thrush is a smaller bird than the ordinary Song Thrush,
and considered a superior songster.&amp;quot; I want to know if this bird is a
distinct species or variet}&amp;apos;, or whether it is onl}&amp;apos; a small specimen of the
Song Thrush, and whether it has a different song from the latter.
C. Harrison.
The following reply was sent to Mr. Harrison : --
&amp;quot; Nightingale Thrush,&amp;quot; or rather &amp;quot;Thrush Nightingale,&amp;quot; is an
out-of-date name for a bird which is usually called in this country &amp;quot; The
Greater Nightingale ; &amp;quot; but &amp;quot; Eastern Nightingale &amp;quot; is a better name, our
own bird being the Western Nightingale ; it is now often known by the
handy German name of Sprosser. If you will refer to the lower part of
page ;^T, of the current volume, }-ou will see that this species has already
been referred to in our Magazine ; -- and you will also please observe that it
is not every Nightingale which has been &amp;quot; made in Germany &amp;quot; that is a
Sprosser. Indeed, I am getting more and more suspicious of the genuine-
ness of these imported specimens. Moreover, it seems to me that those
that do come over are mostly females ; with this as with other species,
the Germans seem to have a way of keeping the best for themselves and of
sending the rubbish to this country -- to be disposed of at absurd prices.
I have often found it exceedingly difficult to distinguish the Sprosser
from our; Nightingale. It is true that the breast is sometimes mottled
but then so is that of the Nightingale : I think it is in the spring that the
mottling comes out so strongly. In the Cat. Birds Brit. Mus. no mention
whatever is made of mottles or spots on the breast of the Sprosser : the
account is, &amp;apos;&amp;apos;This species differs from the preceding (the Nightino-ale) in
being generally less russet in colour (more olive), especially on the upper
tail-coverts, in having a smaller bastard primarj% a more pointed wino&amp;quot;, and
in being a somewhat larger bird.&amp;quot; Mr. Howard Saunders specially refers
to the &amp;quot; minute bastard primary &amp;quot; as a distinguishing mark. A German
writer (Brehni) states that the Sprosser is stouter and about three-fourths
of an inch longer than the Nightingale, and that the upper breast is cloudy
speckled. The song is stated to be more powerful but less melodious than
that of our bird. It is stated by some, even quite recently, that the Sprosser
has been occasionally met with in this country ; but this is discredited by
modern scientists, who have laid down the law that the bird must not
appear farther west than the Rhine valley -- but birds do not always regard
the laws of the learned. The Cat. Birds Brit. Mus. says, &amp;quot;The Eastern
Nightingale breeds in Eastern Europe, rarely strajdng into the valley
of the Rhine, extending northwards into South Sweden and Central
Russia, and eastwards into Asia Minor, Northern Turkestan, and South-
western Siberia. It passes through North-eastern Africa on migration, and
doubtless winters somewhere in the interior.&amp;quot;
It will be seen from the foregoing that the Thrush Nightingale must
not be compared with the British Thrush but with our familiar Nightino-ale.
Even the old scientific name Philomela tiitdoides (Thrush-like Nightino-ale)
has long been discarded along with the English one.

<bodyText confidence="0.977412379310345" page_id="32635641"  page_num="198" year="" vol="">
Sir, -- Mr. Dutton is surprised to hear of an Alexandrine being, in
any sense, the &amp;quot; ideal &amp;quot; Parrot. I have not his wide experience of Parrots,
but as far as my limited knowledge goes, every rule with regard to them
.seems to bristle with exceptions. I mean, of course, especially with
regard to their powers of intelligence as shown by their tameness and
acquisition of speech.
&amp;quot;Tony&amp;quot; was a cock bird, a very beautiful specimen of his kind, and
in all respects a perfectly unique creature. I trained him to be clean by
means of a little stand, fourteen inches high, upon which I used to place
him at intervals. He very soon learned to know why he was removed from
my shoulder or lap, and it was comical to see him nodding his head when,
the object of his removal being accomplished, he was ready to come back.
Of course I always watched him when he was on a visitor, and I knew by
his movements when he wanted to come away, especially as he never
refused to come when it was necessaiy, although stoutly declining when it
was not. But I may mention that, even before this training began, I never
once knew him misbehave when sitting on a gentleman, and only once
when on a lady.
His extreme tameness was the indirect cause of his death, which was
hrouo-ht about by his being accustomed to eat all sorts of things which
were neither natural nor wholesome. He had done so before I had liim,
and, beino- ignorant throiigh inexperience, I unfortunatelj&amp;apos; allowed this to
continue, and so lost a bird which I would not have parted with for a
thousand pounds. A post-mortem revealed the cause of death to be in-
((/) The tweuty-four eggs were tliose of Java Sparrows and Saffron Finches; the
young liirds were of the latter species. Mr. Farrar need not use the word &amp;apos; alleges &amp;apos; : the
fact was repeatedly pointed out to nie by my man, and I saw the Liuthrix enter the ne.sts,
brino- out both eggs and young and devour them : the nest-boxes were examined every
week, o that we knew exactly how many we lo.st.-- A. G. B.

digestion and congestion of the liver. I never expect to see another bird
to equal &amp;quot;Ton}&amp;apos;,&amp;quot; and I think that if Mr. Dutton had seen him he vs^ould
liave agreed with me that he was certainly an &amp;quot; ideal&amp;quot; Parrot.

PARROT FINCHES.
Sir, -- I bought a pair of Parrot Finches in Januarj- last, and on the
ii&amp;apos;th April put them into a waggon-cage to see whether they would breed.
This morning (21st I^Ia}&amp;apos;) a broken egg was on the sand-tray, (e)
I should not have troubled you with this letter, but when the egg was
\0x25A0opened to see whether it was fertile, to my surprise there were two chicks
inside, one slightly larger than the other.
For years any number of Zebra Finches bred with me, but never a
case of a double-j-olked egg. I know fowls occasionally lay them ; and a
man who kept Canaries in this neighbourhood gave an account in the local
jDaper, about two years ago, of having five birds from four eggs; (/) but
I cannot recollect an}&amp;apos; mention made in the Avicultural Magazine of a
similar case happening to foreign Birds.
It would be of interest if any of our Members could mention having
the like experience, aud, if so, whether the birds lived.
W. T. CaTi,eugh.
Sir, -- This spring I started with four Parrot Finches (sexes doubtful) ;
and several nests were built and eggs laid ; but my aviarj- is far too
crowded, and nests and eggs were destroyed by other birds. The Parrot
Finches made no attempts to defend their nests, the hen ilying off at the
approach of any tin}&amp;apos; bird ; practically their time is given up to fighting
amongst themselves aud hunting one another all over the aviar}&amp;apos;. At first
the nests were all &amp;quot;independent&amp;quot; nests, built less than four feet from the
ground, small, compact, and neat; but all the later nests have been built
in boxes and high up. The last nest which I know of (perhaps there is
another missing hen now sitting) was in a box just under the centre of the
roof of the aviary, in full view : and on the ist of August the hen flew
down close to me with excreta in her bill -- which seems strange for a Parrot
Finch. Since that date the young from this nest have been in hiding
somewhere at the back, and quite out of sight, but often distinctly heard.
Yesterday I thought I saw an unusual number of Parrot Finches, and
to-day (i6tli) I saw a flock of five, two being apparently j&amp;apos;oung birds. My
Parrot Finches have nested so ve/y freely and perseveringly that, under
favourable circumstances, there ought not to be any difficulty whatever in
breeding them.

NOTES ON THE NESTING OF THE CHINESE QUAIL
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.981361755555556" page_id="32635643"  page_num="200" year="" vol="">
Sir, -- I am not aware that an}&amp;apos; of the &amp;quot;Painted&amp;quot; Quails have been
bred in England ; I had hoped to be able to record the fact of having bred
the common species, E. chinensis, myself, but unfortunatel}&amp;apos; one of those
slips twixt the cup and lip, which so often happen with aviculturists, has-
prevented my success, although I now possess, preserved in spirits, some
genviine young Chinese Quails, which never lived to break the shell.
A inimber of eggs were laid by my Quails last winter when they were
in an indoor aviary, but besides the time of year being adverse to the rearing
of 5&amp;apos;oung birds, the aviary was too crowded for anj&amp;apos; hope of success and no
attempt was made to incubate; the eggs being, in fact, laid in different
places. In April the Quails were put into an outdoor aviar}-, and very soou
eggs were discovered about the floor, but no attempt at a nest was made.
I obtained some thick branches and stacked them against the wall in one
corner of the aviary, and behind them I placed a bunch of soft hay. Shortly-
after this I had to leave home, and i;pon my return was glad to find that the
ha}&amp;apos; had been formed into a nest, and that the hen was steadily sitting upon
eight eggs. She sat very well and I quite hoped within three weeks to have
a brood of young Chinese Quails, but I was to be disappointed. When the
three weeks were up I thought it probable that the eggs lacked sufficient
moisture and they were sprinkled with luke-warm water; but I hardly
hoped for success now, as I was nearly sure the full time was passed.
The hen would leave the nest when I went to sprinkle the eggs,
and immediately I had finished would rush on again long before I left the
aviary, a fact that is perhaps worth noting, since it has been stated that the
slightest interference with the nest or eggs of this species will cause the
birds to desert -- still it is in all cases where foreign birds are nesting much
better not to go near the nest, whatever has been stated to the contrary.
Shortly after the three weeks were up I placed the eggs in warm
water and found that they all floated, and no motion was visible as it should
have been had the chicks been alive. I thereupon broke one egg and found
that it contained a fully developed chick, which had evidently been dead
some few days. I then broke all the eight, four of which contained dead
young birds, all fully developed, and apparently within about a day of
hatching ; they were of course covered with down, and closely resembled
young partridges in colour.
How it was that none hatched is not clear, but my own opinion is
that the fault lies in the concrete floor of the inner part of the aviary, upon
which the nest was placed. If I ever put up another outdoor aviary I shall
have the bare earth as a floor to the inner as well as the outer part, only I
shall have a layer of half-inch mesh wire netting laid about six inches below
the surface as a proof against ground vermin. My Chinese Quails are
particularly tame, and will readily take mealworms from the hands of those
they know. The hen occasionally &amp;quot; crows &amp;quot; as well as the cock, but in a
feebler voice.

Altliougli the increase in membership has not been so
:great during the past year as in the previous one, we still have
to report a steady growth, somewhat exceeding that in 1895-6.
Forty-five new members have been eledted, and the number now
on the roll is two hundred and eighty-four.
It was found that the practice of issuing plates in two
:States, black and white to ordinary members, and hand-coloured
to those who paid an extra subscription, was a cause of much
labour to the Hon. Secretary and to the publishers, and for
various reasons undesirable. We had therefore to choose
between raising the subscription sufficiently to enable coloured
plates to be supplied to all members, and abandoning the plates
altogether. The response to the circular issued in reference to
this matter shewed that a large majority of the members was
in favour of an increase in the subscription ; and we accord-
ingly altered the rules by making the future annual subscription
7/6 instead of 5/-. The extra 2/6 will not fully meet the cost of
the plates ; and we are relying upon an expedled large increase in
membership, and in the sale to non-members, to justify this
step.
Two of the plates issued this year were from the drawings
by Mr. P. J. Smit, and all of those to appear next year have
been drawn by him. It was intended that half the number of
the plates for next 5^ear should be drawn by Mr. Frohawk, but
lie was too busy to undertake them.

Two medals have been presented -- to Mr. R. A. Todd for
breeding the Ivong-tailed Grass-finch {Poephila acuticatidd), and
to Mr. G. E. BousKii,!, for breeding the Golden-crowned New
Zealand Parrakeet {Cyanorhamphiis a^iriceps). Their success
should be an encouragement to others to try to breed new
species.
In March, Mr. St. Quintin, who was elected a member of
the Executive Committee at the beginning of the year, resigned,
as he had to go abroad, and Mr, Seth-Smith was chosen in his
place.
At the request of the R.S.P.C.A., we undertook the pre-
paration of a small pamphlet on &amp;quot; Birds during transit by Sea or
Land&amp;quot;: this has been published by the R.S.P.C.A., and, we
believe, extensively circulated. In this matter several members,,
who are not on the Council, kindly assisted.
Our thanks are due to those members who have contributed
articles or letters to the Magazine. It is hoped that next year
the size of the Magazine may be again somewhat increased ;
and to meet this growth we shall want more matter from
our contributors. We hope that no one will wait to be asked
to write, but that everyone who feels that he has any facts of
interest to communicate will not hesitate to do so. Complaints
are sometimes made that the Magazine devotes insufficent space
to British birds, and papers upon that branch of the subjedl will
therefore be specially acceptable. But it must be recognised that
the scope for original observation is now much more restridted
in the case of British than foreign species, and we can therefore
hardly expecft to receive as many good articles upon the former
as we do upon the latter ; the subjedt of British birds has been
already so fully dealt with by many competent authors that it is,,
in a sense, comparatively exhausted.
We shall always be glad to receive, and publish, records
of the breeding of species not often bred in captivity, and
members should not be deterred from contributing such notes
by the fadl that the species has been bred once or twice before.
The publication of the Magazine b}^ Messrs. Betts and
Sons, Ltd., has relieved the Secretary of a good deal of work,.

and has led to a very considerable increase in the sale to
non-members. It would be well for members to bear in mind
that the Officers of the Society have no longer anything to do
with the distribution of the Magazine.
The Society has now been in existence for four years,
and its permanent success may be regarded as assured. The
position reached by the Society is due to the way in which the
members have worked together for the common good ; and so
long as they continue as united and energetic as they have
hitherto shewn themselves, we believe that the Society will
continue to grow and prosper.

THE CHINESE SPECTACLE-BIRD.
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.98042502631579" page_id="32635647"  page_num="204" year="" vol="">
Zosterops simplex, Swinh.
By A. G. BuTLKR, Ph.D.
The White-eyes or Spectacle-birds are placed among the
Honey-suckers by scientists ; but their general aspect, their
actions, and their notes resemble those of our smaller Warblers.
The Chinese bird was first recognized as an undescribed
species by the late Consul Robert Swinhoe in 1862, when he
gave it the name of Zoste7vps simplex. In his &amp;apos; Revised Catalogue
of the Birds of China and its Islands,&amp;apos; (P. Z. S., 1871, p. 346) he
states that it is found from &amp;apos;Hainan to Wancho, and in Formosa.&amp;apos;
The upper surface of this bird is olive-green, the forehead,
chin, throat and under tail-coverts sulphur yellow, remainder of
underparts ashy white towards the centre ; lores and a line
running round the lower edge of the eye-ring blackish ; a ring
of white feathers encircling the eye ; iris amber, bill blackish ;
feet leaden-gray.
The sexes are much alike, but it is probable that they
differ in the width of the bill ; my male being alive and my
female a skin, I cannot compare them.
I have been unable to obtain notes as to the wild life of
this species, but there is not the least doubt that it corresponds
with that of other species of the genus ; therefore one may
safely assume that, when at libert}^, Z. simplex feeds upon the
small insecfts which frequent the nectaries of flowers and soft
berries ; that it builds a neat deep cup-shaped nest in a bush and
lays pale greenish or bluish eggs.
Like all the Spectacle-birds Z. simplex is always on the
move ; its sprightly actions are extremely graceful, and the
occasional flip which it gives with its wings, when running up and
down its perch before leaving it, adds much to the appearance
of activity which characterizes it, as also do the sharp jerky
turns of its head.
The shrill tsip tsip uttered as this Zosterops flits from one
point to another, evidence its abounding health and excitable
temperament ; but its song, which merely consists of a short
Cicada-like trill, is very rarely heard.
It was formerly supposed that the White-eyes were
difiicult birds to keep ; so they were cooped up in little

ornamental waggon-cages, not permitted to bathe, but fed on
milk-sop and grocers&amp;apos; currants : of course under this treatment
these active and cleanlj^ birds soon died. Fed in the same
manner as a Tanager, a Zosterops (even when alone, as mine has
long been) will live in perfect health for years ; but it needs a
good-sized cage and a bath.
As elsewhere stated, Mr. Abrahams gave me my only pair
of this species in 1893 or 1894 ! ^^^&amp;lt;^ ^^^ hen, which at first
appeared to be the stronger bird, only survived about a year ;
whereas the cock bird is still in perfect health.
Last 3^ear I turned in a newly-captured Gold-crest with
him, hoping that he would teach the latter to feed ; but, though
he cuddled up to it and preened its feathers, the Gold-crest
refused everything in the shape of food excepting small spiders,
and only survived for twenty-four hours from the time of its
capture.
I give my Zosterops my usual soft mixture consisting of
stale bread-crumbs moistened with mashed potato, and mixed
witli Abrahams&amp;apos; food, preserved yolk and ants&amp;apos; cocoons, also half
an orange or apple daily : he will not touch mealworms, but
likes small flies or clothes moths when he can get them, which
is extremely rarely. I hardly know when he moults, as the
feathers are so gradually shed that they make no noticeable
litter ; consequentl}^, throughout the year, my bird is invariablj&amp;apos;&amp;apos;
to all appearance perfect in plumage.
If oranges or soft apples are not procurable, which is not
often the case, a soft pear split in half, or a few split sweet-water
\0x25A0grapes with the pips removed, are accepted gratefully ; but, as is
the case with Tanagers, sweet oranges seem to be preferred to
most fruits ; banana is eaten in the absence of anything else, but
Zosterops simplex seems not to appreciate this fruit as the Scarlet
Tanager does. Like the Superb Tanager, he usually commences
a meal with the soft mixture ; but, whereas the former always
selects a piece of bread for his first mouthful, the latter prefers
yolk of ^zz-
Spectacle-birds are naturally sociable, and when at rest
like to sit close to a companion, after the manner of Liothrix or
Estrilda ; nevertheless a solitary life evidently does not distress
them as it would other species.

Considering the perfect organization of the feet of
Passerine birds for grasping, it is somewhat astonishing that
so many of them appear to have no notion of using these
members for holding their food, or for transporting any object,
after the manner of Birds of Prey.
It would appear, however, that our common Crow fCorvus
splendens) does occasionally do the latter, for I have on two or
three occasions seen one flying with a stick or other nesting
material in its foot, thus imitating a Kite {a).
Curiously enough, Kites themselves frequently carry
nesting material in their beaks, though food is carried by them
in the feet.
Among Passerine birds other than Crows, I have seen a
&amp;quot;Brown Shrike (Lanius crisatusj, in the Museum compound,
\0x25A0carry off in its foot a dragon-fly on which it was preying when
disturbed ; and a King-crow (Dicrurus ater) in a large com-
partment in one of the aviaries of the Aliphore Zoological
Oardens similarly transported a butterfly I had given it, when
persecuted by other birds which wanted the insect. I have also
noticed that Bhimrajs ( Disseniurus paradiseus J which I have kept,
\0x25A0when disturbed with food in their foot, will still thus retain it
when shifting their position.
This habit of grasping the food in one foot is just as
-characteristic of the Drongos as of the true Shrikes, judging
from what I have seen of Disseniurus paradiseus and Dicrurus
&amp;lt;iter ; I have even seen the latter bird apparently trying to eat
something from its feet in the air. Chibia hottentotta appears
also to grasp its food with its foot when feeding, at times. I
have distincftly seen recently a Piping-crow ( Gyni7iorhina ) both
grasp its food with its foot like a Shrike and put it under one
foot like a Crow, in quick succession.
(a) Our British Carrion Crow certainly often carries its prey in its foot. On one
occasion I saw a pair carrying off even goslings in this way. The Raven commonly uses
its pouch and bill-- the former for food, the latter for other articles. Speaking from
memory, the following have carried small birds for short distances in their foot in my
aviary-- The Wandering Tree-pie, and the Hunting Cissa ; also probably some of three
species of Blue-Pie -- Urocissa sinensis, occipitalis, and ma^niiosttis.- -- R. P.

This habit of using the foot as a hand (with the leg
resting on the ground or perch) would thus seem to be common
to various Shrike-like birds ; but it is rather surprising to find
it markedly characteristic of many of the Babblers, as I have
done after studying many species in captivity (b).
In the case of C^&amp;apos;ateropus canorus^ Argya earlii, Garrulax
leucolophus and albigularis, PydoT-his sme7tsis, Lioptila capistrata,
Siva Cyanuroptera, Liothrix hUeus, Mesia argentauris , and y^igi-
thina tiphia, this action was to be remarked, though some of
these birds, at all events, frequently employ the corvine method
of putting the food under the foot simply, and this was specially
the case with Pyctorhis. T^-ochalopterum liJieahun and a species
of Zosterops I kept very seldom used their feet in feeding and
lanthocincla rufigidaris and Po7iiato7&amp;apos;hinus etyihrogenys apparently
not at all, though I thought I saw a sign of this in the last species.
None of the various species of Bulbuls, however, which I
have kept from time to time, have ever shown any disposition to
use their feet in feeding, and in this respect Chloropsis also
agrees with them rather than with its obviously nearer relative
j/Egi7ithma.
Myiopho7ie7LS ie77i7)tinckii, \.]i&amp; only member of the l,7^achyp-
te7ygi7tcs which I have been able to examine in this regard, does
not seem inclined to use its foot ; as indeed one would not
expect it to do, seeing its manifestly close relationship to the
typical Thrushes, Mei&amp;apos;ida and Turdus, which in its gait and
appearance it so much resembles. For the Babblers, when on
the ground, generally move with quite a different action from the
true Thrushes, standing less eredl and progressing by more or
less bounding hops only, without running as a rule. But Argya
earlii appears to be more Thrush-like in its gait than other
Babblers, though typical enough in most respects. The
New Zealand Thrush (Tur7iagra) though somewhat resembling
a Babbler in gait and tail action, does not, according to the
keeper of the Western Aviary at the London Zoological Gardens,
who watched it for me, use its foot in feeding.
These differences between the Babblers and Thrushes
may seem very trivial matters to insist upon, but it must be
remembered that the former group is generally admitted to be a
very difficult one to define, and this habit of using the foot in
feeding, like a Crow or a Shrike, will certainly differentiate most
ibi BU&amp;apos;th, however, as quoted by Jerdoii (Birds of India, vol. IV., pt. I., pp. i6 and
36.) has recorded the use of the foot in feeding by Pyctorhis sinensis and Dryonasfes
sinensis. I haVe alluded to the habit in some of these birds in my papers on the Theory
(Of Warning- Coloration and Mimicry, J. A. S. B., 1895 and 1897. -- F. F.

Babblers, large or small, from either Thrushes or Warblers, none
of which, so far as I have seen, ever act in this way ; and I have
had opportunities of observing, besides other Thrushes and
Warblers, Copsychus saularis, Cittocincla macrura, and Orthotomus
sutorius, under conditions which should have made them show
this adlion if it were liabitual (r).
This distincT;ion in habit is paralleled by the fact that the
Troupials, as I have observed in the case of Icterus vulgaris,
though simulating the Starlings in form and the Orioles in
colour, differ from both these groups in readily making use of
their feet when feeding, generally in the Corvine fashion.
Of course, habits of this kind may vary in allied groups
even ; I do not remember seeing Sparrows {Passer domesticus and
montanus&amp;apos;) ever use their foot to retain any object, as some
Finches, e.g., the Canary, will do. And among Cuckoos, while
the Crow-pheasant {Ce)itropus sinensis) uses its foot like a Crow,
the Guira {^Giiira guira) does not appear to do so, though a bird
of similar habit in some respects. Nor do all Parrots even,
charcteristic as the gesture is, use their feet as hands ; the
Budgerigar (^Melopsittacus taidulahts), does not do so, as far as I
know. I would not, therefore, press this charadler too hard.
But a habit certainly does seem very persistent in many cases,
and the present one should, I think, be allowed a certain amount
of weight, in conjunction with other characters.
Curiously enough, the typical Babblers are strikingly
marked off from allied groups by other peculiarities only
observable in the living bird. Thus, they are usually, from
Garrulax to Zosterops, remarkably and demonstratively sociable,
exhibiting au intense love of company, and being given to
cuddling up to and caressing other birds, including those of
another species, or even group, if the latter permit. Chbropsis,
however, and appai&amp;apos;ently ^ginthhia, are not thus disposed.
This social disposition, which, by the way, is less notice-
able among Bulbuls, is obviously different from that of Tlirushes
and Warblei&amp;apos;S, and though a mental or moral character, should
be allowed its due weight in considering the relationships of
such difficult and closely -related groups as the Thrush -like
Pas seres (d).
[c) Although this may be a general habit, it is not without exceptions ; for my
hand-reared Missel-Thrush always used his foot as a hand to retain my finger when I
was fighting him. (See &amp;quot; Brit. Birds with their Nests and Eggs,&amp;quot; vol. I. p. 6). -- A. G. B.
(d) I may also mention, in this connection, that I found that being confined and
watched in a cage, ^ginthitia iiphia and Argya earlii did not produce &amp;quot; castings &amp;quot; from
insects given, while Cittocincla macrura did so. -- F. F.

REVIEW.
A Dictionary of Bird-Notes, by Chas. Loziis Hett.
(Jackson, Market Place, Brigg. Price 2/6. y
There are, we are sure, many of our members who do not
confine their study of bird-life to the occupants of cage or aviary,
but delight to ramble &amp;quot; far from the madding crowd &amp;quot; and take
mental notes of all the birds seen or heard ; and who, amongst
these students of wild nature, has not experienced great difficulty
in identifying certain uncommon bird-notes? Perhaps an un-
common Warbler is heard singing or chirping in a hedge or
thicket, and with the greatest caution is approached ; but the
bush is far too thick to admit of the slightest view being obtained :
the bird drops like a stone into the densest part of the thicket,
and has skulked away before the observer has had a chance of
identifying it ; and he is forced to the conclusion that without
that &amp;quot; murderous weapon,&amp;quot; tlie collector&amp;apos;s gun, it is quite
impossible to identify many of the rarer species of small British
birds. Or again, as he lies awake on a warm night in Spring or
Autumn, he hears the notes of innumerable migrants as they fly
past overhead, calling loudly to one another as they pursue their
aerial course to or from their breeding quarters. How are these
birds to be identified by their notes only ?
Mr. Hett, a well-known member of our Society, has
greatly helped us in this direction by supplying us with a
complete &amp;quot; Dictionary&amp;quot; of the notes of nearly every species that
is accepted as &amp;quot; British&amp;quot; by the British Ornithologists&amp;apos; Union.
In the opening paragraph to the preface the Author tells
us that &amp;quot;bird-notes have been recorded, more or less, since the
days of Gilbert White ; but up to the present time they
have never been presented to the public in the alphabetical or
dictionary form.&amp;quot;
The book before us may be said to consist of five parts, in
the first of which the different Notes are given in alphabetical
order, and opposite each is printed the name of the species by
which that note is uttered. Of course it must be admitted that
many bird-notes are quite incapable of being truthfully rendered
by any combination of letters ; nevertheless, the Author&amp;apos;s
rendering of many, we might say most, of the notes is very
accurate, and conveys a very clear idea of the sounds uttered by
the different species.
The peculiar &amp;quot;purring&amp;quot; of the Nightjar does not strike
the writer as resembling chur-r-r, jarr-r-r-r-rr ; but then it is
</bodyText>
<bodyText confidence="0.99737811627907" page_id="32635655"  page_num="210" year="" vol="">
one of those sounds which the English alphabet is incapable of
rendering truthfully : and we should have given the sound
emitted when the bird stops &amp;quot;purring&amp;quot; and takes flight, as
something like coo-oo uttered softly, rather than as dee- dee ; but
co-ic, co-ic is a very truthful rendering of the sound made
frequently by the bird on the wing, probably by the male only
when chasing the female. This, by the way, is the sound alluded
to by Gilbert While as a &amp;quot;small squeak&amp;quot; {e). The Author does
not mention the clapping of the wings over the back which is so
characteristic of this species, as well as of the Woodpigeon
{C . palumbus) \n Wi^ &amp;apos;$)^xm.%. This is, of course, not a "^/^ but
a distinct aid to identification nevertheless.
The Woodpigeon is only mentioned under the misleading
name of Ring-dove, by which it is absolutely unknown to many
people.
In the second part of the volume the names of the Species
are given in alphabetical order, opposite which are printed the
notes they utter.
The third part consists of a &amp;quot; Glossary of popular, local
and old-fashioned names of British birds,&amp;quot; which will be found
most useful b}^ those who reside in remote localities where the
peasants are, for the most part, unfamiliar with the generally-
accepted names of the birds. Most of us would be much puzzled
if we were told that a certain bird was a &amp;quot; Blethering Tarn ; &amp;quot; but
by the aid of Mr. Rett&amp;apos;s book we should find that this was
merely a local name for the familar Stonechat. We should
probably be equally at sea if told that a certain sound was
produced by a &amp;quot; French Magpie,&amp;quot; but the book before us informs
us that this is an appellation in some parts bestowed upon the
lyCsser Spatted Woodpecker.
A list of birds accepted as &amp;quot;British&amp;quot; constitutes the
fourth part of this useful little volume. Here the names of the
species are printed in orthodox order,, and the scientific names
are given. The Author has, we are glad to see, kept to the
nomenclature adopted by the B. O. U., instead of following
the authorities at South Kensington. The Goldfinch is still
Curdzielis elegans instead of Cardiielis carduelis, and the Partridge
is still Perdix cinerea and not Perdix perdix.
At the end of the volume we find a list of terms applied,
to various gatherings of birds.
The book is very small and compact, and can easily be
carried in the pocket. It contains a large amount of information,

and we can strongly recommend it to all our members who are
lovers of wild bird-life. We do not hesitate to say that the book
before us will prove to be what its Author would&amp;apos; have it -- &amp;quot; An
aid to identification without slauofhter.&amp;quot;

The ti-eatnient which I have adopted for this species differs somewhat
from that advocated by Dr. Butler in his interesting article which appears
this month, and I think that it may be useful to some of our readers if I
venture to supplement his remarks by some of my own.
Dr. Butler refers to some unnamed persons who cooped these birds
up in small cages, did not permit them to bathe, and fed them on milk-sop
and grocer&amp;apos;s currants -- and he rightly condemns such treatment. I must
&amp;lt;:onfess that I never before heard of Zosterops being so treated. I think it
ought to be pointed out that milk-sop, properly prepared with boiled milk,
and unsweetened, is an excellent food for Zosterops and other Honey-eating
birds, though they require in addition some mixture containing egg and
ants&amp;apos; eggs, and plenty of ripe fruit. I have had my l)ird for nearly a j&amp;apos;ear,
and feed him on milk-sop ; a mixture of sponge cake, Abrahams&amp;apos; egg, and
soaked ants&amp;apos; eggs ; and fruit. The fruit is usually banana, which I consider,
on the whole, to be the most iiseful and wholesome fruit for all birds; but
just now, while pears are in season, he more often has pear. He is very
fond of mealworms, and I think that in strict moderation they are beneficial,
or at any rate harmless.
My specimen inhabits a small bird-room aviar^&amp;apos; in company with a
Blue Sugar-bird, a Cordon bleu, a Blackcap, and some other birds -- they
should have plenty of room and frequent baths, but they are not singular
in these requirements, and I see no reason to suppose that they would suffer
more from being confined in a small cage than any other active bird of the
same size.

NOTES ON THE NESTING OF THE CHINESE QUAII,.
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.994898461538462" page_id="32635656"  page_num="211" year="" vol="">
Sir, -- I was particularly interested in Mr. Seth-Smith&amp;apos;s letter upon
this subjedl: as it shows me that I am not the only unlucky one as regards
this species.
My Chinese Quails did not begin to lay until the end of March, and
soon after they started my larger Doves commenced fighting over
their nest -- a shallow depression scratched in the earth and scantily lined
with grass and scraps of fern. This naturally frightened the sitting hen,
who laid one or two eggs on the floor in the opposite corner of the aviary.
I picked the eggs ixp, placed them in the nest, and did my best to screen it
off with extra twigs : but it was of no use, for the Crested Pigeons, Bronze-
wings and a male Bar-shouldered Dove were always at war, and in their
struggles soon trampled down the twigs and broke or bruised all the eggs,
thus putting an end to ray hopes for this year.
</bodyText>
<bodyText confidence="0.9855882" page_id="32635657"  page_num="212" year="" vol="">
About six (perhaps seven) eggs were laid, in colour something
between that of the eggs of the Nightingale and Sedge Warbler, a slightly
olivaceous stone-brown, and in size a little larger than those of a Skylark
with more nearly the form of those of a Blackbird. They are very
minutely speckled with dark brown, most of the dots being like the finest
pin-pricks but one or two slightly larger.
It is probable that the eggs of this, as of the Common Ouail, may
vary a good deal ; but I should be surprised to see pale green unspotted
eggs such as Jerdou describes and Capt. Legge extracted from the oviduct
of a bird which he shot in Ceylon : I quite think (with Capt. Legge) that
the colouring of this egg was undeveloped.
In the &amp;apos; Birds of Ceylon&amp;apos; there is a good deal of information about
the Chinese Quail, but the author states that very little is known respecting
the nest or eggs.

CROSSBILLS.
Sir, -- Yesterday morning, 31st of August, I several times noticed an
unfamiliar call-note in the garden, and, later on in the day, came upon a.
pair of Crossbills busy among some fir-trees. The birds allowed me tO&amp;apos;
approach within a few feet of them as they swung from the fir-cones^
twisting out the seeds with their powerful bills. They were about the
garden the whole da}-.
Is this not an unusual time of the year for Crossbills to visit Kent ?&amp;apos;
I wonder if they have been observed in other places lately.

Sir, -- Most people find that it takes them more than all their time
to keep Firefinclies alive, let alone anything else : and therefore I venture
to think that these few notes on the nesting of the species may be of
interest to our members.
1 bought ten Firefinches in the summer of 1897, and was so fortunate
as to lose none of them. They wintered with my other birds in a perfectly
cold indoor aviary, and seemed to care nothing for the weather. They are
in lovely plumage, the cocks like little rubies for splendour.
This summer a pair set their hearts on reproducing their species.^
They built a snug nest in a cocoa-nut husk hung low down, the said nest
being composed of hay and feathers. Two eggs were laid, fairly large for
the size of the bird, and the hen sat most steadily. One egg was hatched,
the other being unfertile. The youngster has now flown, and is a very
vigorous little thing ; it is brown all over, with just a little patch of dull
red on the rump ; no eye-marks, black beak, darkish legs, and without any
of the distinguishing marks of the old birds.
I have never heard j&amp;apos;et of a case of Firefinches rearing young, so I
thought I would send you this account.
