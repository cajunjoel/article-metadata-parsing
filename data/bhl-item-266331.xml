During the past year the Council has seriously considered
"" * *
the question of a change of publishers for the Magazine ; and at
the meeting held in. July it was unanimously .and definitely
decided to accept the specification tendered by Messrs. West,
Newman &amp; Co., the well-known publisher&apos;s of the "Zoologist"
and other monthly periodicals dealing with natural history from
the popular and scientific side.
Members of the Society therefore are requested to
remember that for the ensuing year, and until further notice,
the publishers of the Magazine are
Messrs. WEST, NEWMAN &amp; Co.,
54, Hatlon Garden, London, E.C.
One more change has to be announced. Mr. Frank Finn,
who was appointed editor in succession to Mr. Seth-Smith, was
reluctantly and unexpectedly compelled by pressure of other
work to resign the Editorship last June. The Executive
Committee were fortunate enough to secure the services of
Mr. J. Lewis Bonhote for the post, and desire to express their
indebtedness to him for consenting to take the matter in hand at
a moment's notice.
For the rest the progress made in the past year calls for
no special comment. Under Mr. Finn, and latterly under Mr.
Bonhote no effort has been spared to keep the Magazine up to

v.
the high standard of previous years, both in the way of illustrations
and subject matter, and the thanks of the Council are herewith
given to all those Members who have kindly contributed articles
and notes to the present volume.
It must be remembered, however, that owing to the cost
of production, this standard can only be maintained at a high
expense and improved by increased income--in other words by
increased membership. The Council, therefore, would urge
existing Members to lose no opportunity of bringing the work
and privileges of the Society before the notice of friends who
are interested in birds.

The Medal may be awarded at the discretion of the Committee, to
any member who shall succeed in breeding, in the United Kingdom, any
species of bird which shall not be known to have been previously bred in
captivity in Great Britain or Ireland. Any member wishing to obtain the
Medal must send a detailed account for publication in the Magazine within
about eight weeks from the date of hatching of the young and furnish such
evidence of the facts as the Executive Committee may require. The Medal
will be awarded only in cases where the young shall live to be old enough
to feed themselves, and to be wholly independent of their patents.
The account of the breeding must be reasonably full so as to afford
instruction to our Members, and should describe the plumage of the young
and be of value as a permanent i ecord oj the nesting and general habits of the
species. These points will have great weight when the question of awarding
the Medal is under consideration.
The parents of the young must be the bond fide property of the
breeder. An evasion of this rule, in any form whatever, will not only dis-
qualify the breeder from any claim to a Medal in that particular instance,
but will seriously prejudice any others claim he or she may subsequently
advance for the breeding of the same or any other species.
In every case the decision of the Committee shall be final.
The Medal will be forwarded to each Member as soon aftet it shall
have been awarded as possible.
The Medal is struck in bronze (but the Committee reserve the right
to issue it in silver in very special cases), and measures 2S inches in
diameter. It bears on the obverse a representation of two birds with a nest
containing eggs, and the words " The A vicultural Society--founded 1894."
On the reverse is the following inscription : " Awarded to ( name of donee
for rearing the young of {name of species), a species not previously bred in
captivity in the United Kingdom.'

THE ABYSSINIAN LOVE-BIRD.
Agapornis tar ant a.

<bodyText confidence="0.99627944" page_id="58072343"  page_num="23" year="" vol="">
When paying an afternoon visit to some friends when I
was in Italy last March, my hostess was so grateful to me for
dosing a sick Black-capped Lory, which had been ailing for a day
or two, and which after the dose promptly laid a fine egg, that
she presented me with a pair of Abyssinian Love-Birds*
On entering a sitting-room I caught sight of these birds in
a cage in a corner of the room, and on asking what they were,
befote I went up to them to make a closer examination, my
hostess said they were only some little common green parrakeets
which she had purchased in Genoa for twelve francs.
On going up to their cage, I said, " They may be common
to you, but they certainly are not so to me, for I have never seen
the species before." Upon which the kind lady answered, "Oh
well, do take them, it will be a little return for having saved my
Lory's life."
As I found she did not set great store by them, in spite of
*heir rarity, I complied. They lived happily until I brought
hem to England in June, when seeing they were inclined to
lest, I put them in a large aviary amongst Parrakeets and Black-
aced Love-Birds. Immediately they began eagerly to explore
11 the nesting boxes, but most unfortunately the male bird
elected a very deep one, which larger parrots seemed to appre-
iate, and inside of which they had gnawed away (unbeknown to
ie) all the perches that had been placed to assist them in ascend-
Jg and descending to the hollowed space at the bottom of the

Two days went by. and as I could only see the hen bird, I
beo-an to take alarm. A ladder was put in the aviary. In the
very first nesting-box that I took down, there was my poor bird
as dead as he could be! # # *
Moral! No more deep nesting-boxes!
These Abyssinian Love-Birds are the largest of their
species, although I suppose the Rosy-faced ones run them fairly
closely. The male is easily distinguished from the female, as s e
has no red about the head.
From what I could see, they are birds that would nest
readily * indeed I fancy my widowed hen has laid some eggs in
spite of her being a widow. And they ought to be hardy, for I
believe they dwell in fairly high altitudes amongst the Abyssinian
mountains. _

South Wales is an area of some 36,000 acres of perfectly wild
country, which has been set apart as an immense recreation
o-round for the people, and called the National Park. It consists
for the most part of high table-land, varying in altitude from
-30 to 900 feet above sea level. It is bounded on the east by the
ocean, and is mostly covered with thick forest. Through the Paik
runs the Port Hacking River, the lower reaches of which are
tidal and contain any number of salt-water fish--the celebrated
Schnapper, the red bream, the black rock cod, jew fish, whiting,
flounder, and many others. Some way up the river a dam
separates the salt from the fresh water, and above this dam one
can row for miles along the most beautiful river scenery. The
banks are for the most part steep and rocky and thickly wooded

to preserve the indigenous fauna and flora; rangers have their
stations and their beats, and to their energetic protection is due
the fact that this is one of the very few places, perhaps the only
place, in Australia, where the naturalist may be fairly certain, on
any day, of seeing the Lyre Bird in its wild surroundings.
On the evening of February 22nd, 1908, Messrs. S. Re
Souef, H. and P. Peir, Coles and myself left Sydney, equipped
with provender for the following day, our destination being
National Park Station. O11 our way Mr. H. Peir pointed out a
spot, not a dozen miles from the Metropolis itself, where he and
others, when boys, used to shoot Turquoisiiie Parrakeets for pies.
Now 110 one knows where these Parrakeets have gone to, if
indeed a single bird exists in its wild state!
Darkness had fallen when we arrived at our destination,
but my companions knew the way well enough, and, shouldering
our belongings, we followed the leader down a long winding
roadway. On our right was thick scrub, while on our left, far
below, we could just discern the silver winding line of the Port
Hacking River as it made its way towards the sea. From every
bush came the chirrup of crickets and cicadas, and the voices
of innumerable frogs came up to us from the river below. A
glimmering light at a window revealed the presence of the
Government Accommodation House, a most comfortable wooden
building, where we found excellent provision for the night.
A great deal was said by members of our party about
rising with the sun or starting off in the morning before the sun
was up, but I regret to say the sun was very well up before we
made a start, certain members of our party being very loth to
leave their comfortable beds.
We went to a boat house where there were many boats for
hire, but it was too early for an attendant to be 011 duty. This
did not however deter us, as neither boats nor oars were locked
|up, and we were very soon paddling down the river. The sun was
by this time hidden behind heavy clouds which promised to loose
their contents upon us in a short time. But the weather was
very warm and, being well provided with waterproofs, we did not
much mind if it rained or not. Semi-domesticated Black Swans
.uid Wild Ducks (. A. superciltosa) were very numerous 011 the

river, and before we had gone far we heard in the distance th
unmistakable notes of the Lyre-bird. Every now and hen a
Laughing Jackass would be seen or heard, and such commo
bird: as White-shafted Fantails and Honey-eaters were con-
stantly with ns. A large Water Lizard was detected sittm,
motionless on a stump which projected from the water ana we
discussed the best means of capturing him. One of the par &gt;
possessed a butterfly net and thought he might be secured m this.
But just as the net was about to drop upon the motionless form
it took on animation and disappeared with a splash into tie
Water Gliding along silently in our boat we were apparently
undetected by a Lyre-bird which had, presumably, come to drink
at the river until the boat came up level with it. We detecte a
pheasant-like form with tail stretched out behind it running from
the river&apos;s edge and ascending the steep banks with great hops
from boulder to boulder.
The river wound its way into the wildest woodland
scenery ; great crags and boulders of rock projected from the
banks which were thickly wooded with gigantic eucalypti, some
-rowing apparently out of the very rock itself, their huge roots
twisted and woven into extraordinary shapes in their endeavour
to force a way through some crack to where nourishment could
be obtained. Maguificentcabbage-tree palms, tree ferns, bauksias
and numerous other beautiful forms of vegetation abounded, and,
a* that early part of the day there were no human beings, save
ourselves, to spoil the scene of wild freedom that surrounded us.
We landed for breakfast and soon had burning the very
necessary fire on which to make our " billy " tea. The little Red-
eyebrowed Finch, or Sydney Waxbill, was here in some numbers,
but was extraordinarily adept at hiding itself amongst the leaves
of the bushes. The clear notes of the Lyre-bird came across
the river from the opposite bank, and a Laughing Jackass, un-
aware of our presence suddenly appeared perched on a branch
above. One glance earthward however revealed our proximity,
and with a jerk of his tail he disappeared, hurling back mocking
laughter at us.
By this time the rain, which had been threatening since we

started, commenced to descend in earnest and gave every pros-
pect of a thoroughly wet day, but the temperature being high
enough to make a little wetting rather pleasant than otherwise,
we kept up our spirits and again took to our boat. Proceeding
down the river we came to a spot where trunks of fallen trees
were numerous in the water, and navigation became somewhat
difficult. A Yellow-breasted Robin appeared on a branch pro-
jecting from the water, within a few feet of our boat, and allowed
us to examine him at close quarters. The rain was now coming
down in torrents, and as we noticed some large caves in the rocky
banks of the river, we decided to land and take shelter.
In the crevices of the rock in which these caves are found
live some very interesting little animals, mouse-like Marsupials
of the genus Phascologale , at least we took them to belong to this
genus, but, according to the authorities on these animals, all of
this genus are said to be strictly arboreal, so these may have
been some species of Smnithopsis, which are more terrestrial.
At all events they were " Pouched Mice " of sorts, and we set to
work to find their sleeping places and if possible to capture some
of the creatures themselves. In crevices in the roofs of the caves
we discovered their nests, mere bunches of dead leaves of the
Eucalyptus. My friend Mr. S. Le Souef pointed these out to me,
or I should never have guessed what they were. We carefully
pulled the leaves away and lay in wait to capture the inmates,
but in every case they were too quick for us. Rike lightning
they dashed out and sped along the most minute ledges of the
rock. I grabbed at one and managed to touch it, but only to
make it tumble from one ledge to another, along which it dashed
like a streak of brown lightning.
We got quite excited over the hunt for Marsupial Mice,
and wandered quite a long way in search of their nests. While
stepping from one rock to another a large Wallaby jumped up
quite close to me and bounded away amongst the undergrowth of
wattles and banksia. At another place a party of three or four
Satin Bower-birds, all in green plumage, flew up from the ground.
I shall never forget the beautiful notes of the Lyre-birds in this
place. Often we heard them quite close to us, but we could,
rarely catch a glimpse of the bird itself. O11 three occasions

Mr. E. J. Brook,
only, on this hay, did we actually see these birds, and then we
were quietly paddling down the river and they took very lilt e
notice of us. All these were males with fully developed tai s
which they carried in the same way as Pheasants. The Austra-
lians often call the Lyre-bird the Native Pheasant, and it is not
to be wondered at, so very pheasant-like do they look at a htt e
distance. . _ , ,
Wonga Pigeons are not uncommon in National Park, and
we flushed several in the course of our rambles. Pennant and
Rosella Parrakeets were common, and we saw also several Crow-
Shrikes ( Strep era), Thick-heads (Pachycephala ), Sacred King-
fishers, and any number of different species of Honeyeaters.
As we rowed back towards the boat-house a couple of dark
grey birds flew across the river and settled on a high tree at the
water's edge, and my companions immediately identified them as
Apostle Birds, or Grey Struthideas. Two is an unusual number
of these birds to be seen at a time. They generally go about in
small flocks of about a dozen, hence they have been termed
" The twelve Apostles."
Thus ended a very delightful trip, only marred by the rain
which hardly ceased, and the countless hordes of mosquitoes
which, encouraged by the dampness of the atmosphere, gave us
much more of their attention than we relished.

THE BREEDING OF THE BLACK LORY.
(Chalcopsittacus ate?&apos;).
By E. J. Brook.
Two years ago Mr. Goodfellow brought from New Guinea
three Black Lories (C. ater) which eventually found their way to
my aviaries.
This little party consisted of one old cock, a young cock
and a hen of uncertain age. They were all very tame and fear-
less and agreed together remarkably well.
In the spring of the present year it was noticed that the
young cock and the hen had paired. Early in May, I think it

on the Breeding of the Black Lory.
was, two eggs were laid in a large nesting box. These e"&amp;lt;r S
proved clear, possibly because the whole family sat on them.
About the middle of June another two eggs were laid, but as
serious incubation did not begin for quite a week a like result to
the first was anticipated.
However, serious incubation began at last, and this time
the old cock was not allowed inside the box. The poor old
fellow used to sit, the very picture of misery, on top of the box,
and his delight when any one he knew would pet and cuddle
him was quite pathetic.
In about a month my aviary man thought it time the eo-as
were removed, and his joy was great when he discovered a young
bird about a week old in the nest. The period of incubation was
evidently about three weeks.
When the young bird was about a fortnight old, the
parents would leave it for about an hour every day, when they
would wash and take exercise. They, however, did not leave
the young bird without attendance, for the old one was sent into
the nest to look after the baby and, by way of reward, he was
again allowed into the nest box at night.
d he young bird remained in the nest exactly two months
and on leaving it was full-grown and fledged. The colouring is
like the parents except for some small splashes of blood-red on
the neck and ears, and the skin round the eyes and under the
lower mandible is white.
The feeding throughout was the same as all my birds get,
viz:--sop made with milk and barley-water, thickened with Mr.
Millsum's " B.C." food, and occasionally a little biscuit or bread
added for a change ; also they had fruit.
As I think this will be the first true Tory reared in
confinement, certainly in Great Britian, I hope my account may
be of some small interest.

DARTFORD WARBLERS.

About the only reference to this little known Furze-
Warbler that I can find indexed in the volumes of our journal
is that in Vol. 4, N.S., No. i, p. 26. Here Mr. E. G. B. Meade-
Waldo mentions the fact of having seen it at the Frankfort
Zoological Gardens. Elsewhere I can find but few references to
it in captivity and this fact encourages me to briefly refer to such
an instance at the present time. In Butler's "British Birds, Vol.
I., p. 84, an extract is to be found which runs " The Dartford
Warblers which Montagu kept in confinement were taken from
the nest and reared by hand." These birds " began to sing with
the appearance of their first mature feathers and continued in
song all the month of October.''
Swaysland says" In an aviary the bird is active and
cheerful, and its graceful, sprightly movements cannot fail to
attract attention ; but it is rather difficult to keep in health. It
should be fed the same as a Nightingale."
He does not mention having had one or that he had
obtained such information from anyone in particular, although
that may have been the case.
Going back to the time of Sweet, we find that he says
" I have never been able to procure a living bird of this species,
should any of my subscribers be able to procure me one
of them, or a nest of young ones, I should feel much obliged
and would be willing to purchase it, or exchange any other sort
that I have to spare in return."
Quite recently, however, I met Mr. John Frostick of Balhatn
(a late original member) and he informed me that after trying for
over twenty years he was at last the fortunate possessor of three
young birds. Owing solely to his kindness I have been able to
have them under close observation and have watched them
assume their first winter plumage, which is getting more ashen
and ruddy, and less brown, weekly. Like many other young birds
they grew pugnacious and separation became necessary. In a
large cage their movements are full of interest. They will come

close lip to the wires and peer in one's face without a sign of fear,
or will dart round displaying acrobatic performances extra-
ordinary. On the other hand, they will fearlessly bathe before
one, preen themselves and settle down on the perch and doze,
taking little heed of what is otherwise going on.
One bird is a persistent and sweet songster, the notes
being not unlike those of a Stonechat, with a Lesser Whitethroat
flourish added at intervals. As the books record, their scolding
note is Cha-cha-tcha!
They were reared from the nest on live ant cocoons, and
are apparently larger in size than stuffed specimens I call to mind.
They feed and thrive freely on a good mixture of egg, biscuit,
cocoons, dried flies, etc., and although they had not previously
been offered fruit, they eat sweet pear and banana as readily as
Blackcap Warblers.
When at rest, their tails are carried in a manner reminding
one of a Violet-eared Waxbill, but, after shifting their positions,
this appendage is elevated slightly. In order to see a pioper
display, one was taken outside into the garden, where, at close
quarters, it was possible to witness the natural demeanout of
this very charming bird. Brightening up, the little tellow
curiously examined everything about him, elevated its head
feathers, and then, without warning, shot like a dart to the next
perch. With a jerk the tail was raised, the body dipped and
another flight taken, then back again and so on for a few moments.
The "cock" of its tail seems almost peculiar to the species, not
resembling the same movements of a Wren or of a Robin. The
only bird I can liken it to in this respect is Malurus cyaneus.
This is all done without the slightest sign of fear or wildness,
being merely a display of natural movements. As far as I can
ascertain from a large series of show catalogues extending back
many years and also from those who have attended bird shows
for a considerable length of time, this bird is one of the tew
British Warblers that have yet to be exhibited.
Ornithologists usually give the total length of this bird as
5 inches and that of the Lesser Whitethroat as 5 - 2 inches. As
compared with the latter bird side by side, a Dartford Warbler in

rule measures exactly 2.5 inches.
A nest I have before me I find to be fully 2 inches in
depth and quite that across the inside cup. The gentleman who
procured it, and who also reared these identical birds, told their
present owner that although he had for many years been in close
touch with the species, he had never before removed nest or eggs
or exhibited to covetous eyes their whereabouts, and that he had
yet to find a nest in furze. All that he had had the good fortune
to come across were placed in heather. Other home observers
have generally referred to furze in this respect, although I believe
on the continent, especially in the south, heather is selected as a
site.
These young birds I believe to be all cocks, and they may
be described roughly as follows. Head slaty, deepening in colour
daily, otherwise above, smoky brown ; wings dark brown with
paler margins ; tail dark greyish brown, the two outer feathers
having white outer margins and tips. Underneath they are
principally reddish chestnut, which gradually fades to dirty white
towards the centre of the lower breast and towards the vent,
grey. The eyelids are yellowish and the iris probably wine-red
(but so quick are these birds in shifting the position of their
heads that this is difficult to determine). Bill horn-brown,
yellowish near the gape; feet flesh brown ; a few white tips
ornament the edges of the feathers on the upper throat.
[Since writing the above, a letter signed Florence Burn
appeared in Ca?iarj r and Cage Bird Life , in which the writer
states that she reared two in 1905. Both had short lives; the
diet of raw beef and sops given to them in all probability being
the means of hastening their ends.--A. S.]

Hyphan torn is spilonotus.
By R. A. Holden, F.Z.S.
The Spotted-backed Weaver ( Hyphaniomis spilonotusy
ranges, according to Shelley, from Lake N'gami into Eastern Cape
Colony and Zulnland, and eastward to Mozambique ; and the
following description of it is given in Sharpe's Lavard : " General
colour of the head, breast, belly, vent and rump, bright gamboge
yellow--back, liver brown and yellowish green varigated--sides
of head and chin in front of throat, black--wing feathers brown,
edged with yellow. Tail greenish brown, bill black, feet flesh
colour, length 7&apos;, wing 3&quot; 6&quot;, tail 2&quot; 7&quot;." The eyes are a very
bright red. The hen bird lacks the black upon the face and
throat, the back is dull greenish brown and the gamboge yellow
of the male is replaced by a dull grey, verging into pale lemon
yellow at the throat and some way down the breast. According
to the authorities the eggs of this species (which usually number
three) are of the most diverse colouring, being either white, blue,
or white or blue spotted with brown, and are about 0.75 by 0.56.
I secured six specimens of this Weaver from a dealer about
December, 1908. All were out of colour, and were turned into a
garden aviary 20 feet by 10 feet, with a fairly large unheated
shelter. Two of them died towards the end of February and of
the remaining four three proved to be cocks. About the middle
of April the three cocks came into colour and became exceedingly
quarrelsome, so much so in fact that I had to remove two of them,
leaving the hen bird and the oldest cock in possession. At this
time both birds were very shy and wild when the aviary was
entered. To my surprise the cock at the beginning of May com-
menced to moult rapidly and in a fortnight was quite out of
colour, but by the end of June he was again in full colour and
began to sing and chase the hen all day long.
Both birds refused any seed but canary seed, though insects
of any kind, particularly mealworms and even earthworms, were
much appreciated. The nest (according to Ayres) ( Ibis i860, p.
212) is usually constructed of the leaves of palm and banana with
a small quantity of grass, and Shelley notes that the interior is

Mr. R. A. Holden,
often lined with the leaves of the Australian Blue Gum and Black
Wattle since the introduction of those trees into Africa.
My birds were supplied daily with coarse grass, hay, and
bast, but the grass alone was used and with this the cock bird
built several nests, the hen taking no part beyond inspecting
and usually destroying them.
About July, however, a nest was commenced hanging
from the wire netting of the top of the outside flight. This nest
was a very much more finished article than the former ones,
being both deeper and stronger. In shape it resembled an
inverted snail-shell, its extreme depth being about seven inches,
length seven inches, width four inches, with an entrance tube of
two inches diameter and about two inches long.
The hen seemed from the first to thoroughly approve of
this nest and would sit inside it uttering a peculiar clucking call
while the cock hung from the entrance flapping his wings after
the fashion of the Hyphantornes and singing his harsh song.
The song, which lasts for perhaps four or five seconds,
consists of a series of discords ending with a long-drawn-out hiss
resembling a file being scraped across a metal bar.
After about a week the hen built a bar of strong grass
stalks across the inside of the nest, presumably to prevent the
eggs from falling out when she left the nest; but the effect of this
was to make her entrance a matter of some difficulty; in fact on
later examination the actual space in the interior of the nest
seemed very inadequate for the hen bird alone, without taking
any family into consideration. The nest was lined exclusively
by the hen, the cock bird never entering or adding to it, and the
materials used were cocoanut fibre, roots, dead leaves, cow-hair,
feathers, and a quantity of the leaves of the common montbretia
and privet.
On the 7th of August I found a pure white egg on the
ground under the nest, unfortunately broken, and on the next
day the hen commenced to sit in earnest, only coming off when
disturbed or when mealworms were being dispensed.
The cock frequently flew up to the nest, but never entered
it, and I do not think he ever fed the hen, though close observa-
tion was very difficult. O11 the morning of the 20th August I

on the Nesting of the Spotted-backed Weaver.
found the complete shell of a newly-hatched egg (again pure
white) and another was found the next day. Live ant's eggs were
at once supplied, together with soft food, but neither of the birds
would touch the latter, and if mealworms were mixed with
the soft food they would carefully clean before eating them. On
the 23rd I was unfortunately forced to leave home for three
weeks, but was lucky enough to secure the services of a very
competent neighbour who fed the birds many times daily with
fresh* ant's eggs. Neither she nor myself ever saw the cock
attempt to assist the hen in feeding the young birds.
Unfortunately, about the 2nd September one young bird
(of which I am unable to give a description) was found dead
under the nest and there was no trace of the other.
The weather in Hertfordshire at that time seems to have
been cold and wet, but it was quite possible that the cock bird
was the culprit, for he seemed to think that the business of
incubation was one in which his wife ought not to indulge, and
evidently wished her to spend the day inspecting new nests.
Many of the Weaver-birds show a decided preference, when
building, for branches which overhang water, and I imagine that
H. spilonotus is 110 exception. My birds have for a bath a
shallow earthenware dish, perhaps a foot in diameter, and one of
the first nests was built directly over this. The dish was, from
motives of curiosity, twice moved and on each occasion weaving
was commenced directly above it.
The final nest, in which the young were hatched, was
within four feet of the entrance to the aviary and as nearly as
possible directly above the water-dish. I give these facts for
what they are worth ; they seem to me curious enough to deserve
mention, though I do not think that the various Weavers in the
Western Aviary at the Zoological Gardens ever build over the
much larger bath with which they are supplied, The Spotted-
backed Weaver is figured as the "Natal Yellow-crowned Weaver,"
in Swainson's "Birds of West Africa," and at plate 66 of Smith's
" Illust. Zool. South Africa," the same species is figured, but
from a male which is not in full colour.
I hope if both birds live to breed this species with greater
success next year ; they are handsome, hardy, and exceedingly
interesting, and become fairly tame.

By the Duchkss of Bedford.
I am again sending you a few notes regarding Cranes and
oilier birds at Woburn, in the hope that they may be of some
interest.
A Common Crane, which has for more than a year attached
itself to a pair of Sams Cranes, laid an egg last spring, on which
the Sarus Crane sat for the full time.
Tired of sitting on an infertile egg, they finally went off
to another pond accompanied by their friend, and the Sarus
Crane laid an egg on which she began to sit. Very wet weather
followed and the egg was found at the bottom of the pond.
Shortly after, they started a third nest, laid two eggs,
and this time their perseverance was rewarded and they hatched
out two chicks, which are now well grown.
A second pair of Sarus Cranes hatched out one chick which
is also thriving.
A pair of Common Cranes, both full-winged , nested and
hatched two young. I saw these birds swim across a pond when
still in down.
The White-necked Cranes have also two young ones.
The Mantchurian Cranes nested for the first time with us.
They laid one egg and the young bird was hatched in July and
is doing well.
The Australian Cranes hatched out two chicks which lived
only about ten days. They nested again and have now one
half-grown young one.
A pair of Coscoroba Swans laid four eggs. Two young
were hatched, but I regret to say lived only five and ten days
respectively.
A Chinese and Snow Goose have a cross-bred young one.
One pair of Cereopsis Geese successfully reared their
young, but they unfortunately nest very early in the year and
most of the eggs get frozen.
The Hutchin's Geese nested for the first time and reared
their young.
Bewick's,Whooper and Black-necked Swans all nested but
did not hatch out.

The rain has spoilt not a few of the nests in the aviary
here this summer. The most grievous loss was that of three
nestling Waxwings; for just a week all went well, and then came
prolonged rains. From the afternoon of August 17 until about
noon 011 the following day the parents seemed to be afraid to
uncover the young in order to feed them, and when the rain
stopped it was too late--they sat on the edge of the nest trying
to coax the young ones to raise their heads, but they were either
too far gone or dead. The parents were new importations and
tailless; that birds in defective plumage should have built a
solid substantial nest, laid eggs, hatched them all, and fed and
tended the young with the utmost care was a remarkable occur-
rence. Two nests of the Violet-eared Waxbill have been ruined.
These obstinate creatures will build in a bush or tree if there be
anything of the kind available ; they are now sitting for the third
time. Another perverse little monkey in this connection is the
Quail Finch; do what you will he gangs his ain gate--and comes
to grief accordingly. If there be but a blade of green grass in
the aviary, under that bit of greenery he will build his nest--or
i
nowhere. Oh, the number of nests my old male has had des-
troyed by the rain during these last three summers ! Nevertheless,
he has never given up ; and now, at last, his perseverance has
been rewarded, for three fledgelings, strong on the wing and

Mr. R. Philupps, .
stout of foot, have left the nest :--surely his pluck is woithy of
being immortalised in the pages of the Avicultuval Magazine.
In order that one point in my story may be understood, it
is necessary that I refer back, for a moment, to ancient history.
When my first Quail Finches arrived in December, 1906,
three were found to be suffering from something suspiciously like
septic enteritis. Both of the males died ; one female, after a long
illness, recovered, while the other escaped infection. 1 he latter
is the heroine of the series of nests which weie built during the
summers of 1907 and 1908. Of the effect, or supposed effect, of
the illness upon the other female I shall have something to say
later on.
During the summer of 1907, I had a succession of nests,
all built on the top of a hog's back in the garden aviary. On
September 5, the nest looked so weather-beaten that, concluding
it had been deserted, I was about to tear it open when there
came forth such a bitter cry, and there was such a frantic strug-
gling within as of a wrestle for life, that I held my hand and
withdrew. O11 the nth, one young bird had left the nest, the
only one--the pioneer aviary-bred Quail Finch. On the following
morning I found it dead--it had been muidered.
Now that I look back on this little tragedy, from the higher
ground of later experiences, I can trace the course of events with
sufficient clearness.
Doubtless the rain had much to answer for at first; but, as
the season advanced, the mice increased in number and boldness.
I had read of birds being killed by mice, but, never having had
any personal experience of such a case, I did not give the matter
a thought. The mice stole the eggs; then the birds added a
layer of lining to the nest, and began again. At the last, one
nestling was hatched, and was protected by its parents so long as
it remained in the nest, for both seem to sleep in the nest at
night. That the nestling had had many a scare was evidenced
not alone by the terror it exhibited when I touched the nest, but
from the circumstance that it must have been partially paralysed
from fear. It was in excellent feather, but it was weak on its legs
and made no attempt to fly. I found that my fledgelings of this
summer, as soon as they left the nest, were strong on their legs,

could fly well, and were wild, springing up from the ground as
powerfully as their parents and flying off on the smallest alarm.
If the poor bird had had the proper use of its limbs, I doubt if
the mouse could have grabbed it, owing to its habit of springing
into the air. Should this brief sketch teach a lesson of caution
against mice to any of our readers, then this bird will not have
lived its unhappy little life in vain. It was stupid of the mice to
have killed that fledgeling, for they have had but a poor time of
it here since.
Late one afternoon, not long afterwards, I noticed about a
dozen little birds hovering and disporting together close to the
ground ; having seen something of the kind before, and not
understanding what it meant, I stalked them with the greatest
caution. The centre of attraction proved to be a mouse. A bird
would alight on the ground, sometimes three or four together, the
mouse would dart at a bird, and the bird would just flit up on to
the nearest bough. Bird after bird went down, again and again
the mouse charged, now here now there, now after one bird now
after another, the bird aimed at just dodging out of its reach. It
looked very much like an illustration of the old story of the
snake fascinating its would-be victim. There was no fascination
here, however, although curiosity may have attracted the birds.
It looked very much as if they were having a game; a case of
children, not understanding danger, running across a road in
front of a motor car--a little game which sometimes has a fatal
termination, as with the snake and the bird.
During 1908, the usual number of nests was built--some
three or four each summer--but the Regent Birds and others were
in the aviary ; so what between the birds and the rain the Quail
Finches had not a chance.
In March of this year the female died; and I was left with
the male and the odd female which had had the serious illness
already mentioned ; I had had others in the intervening time
but only the male had survived. As this female had regained
strength, her upper mandible had become red like a male's ; and
she had put on the plumage of the male in every respect but the
black throat, and retained it until last spring. Moreover, she
sang as pertinaciously and freely as a true male. She was scouted

by the other Quail Finches--neither males nor females would
associate or have aught to do with her; in their eyes she was
neither fish, nor flesh, nor fowl, nor good red herring. In Juneot
last year, at pages 228-9 of our magazine, Mrs. Howard Williams
referred to a female in her possession which seems to have been
much such another bird.
When my black-billed female died, I supposed that my
red-billed bird would not be of any use, and endeavoured to
obtain another, but did not succeed in doing so until May 27.
This brought my total number of adults up to three for the year ;
but this new female does not come directly into my story.
After the two old birds had found themselves alone in the
world, little by little they chummed up; the female ceased to
sing, the brightness of her colours abated, and the two went to
nest together. Fertile eggs were laid before the new female was
received, so there cannot be any question of confusion ; and, as
far as I can see, she is the mother of the young birds. This
species is very faithful, and they would seem to pair for life ; and
I have not observed any sign of a shuffle here. The case is
interesting; but then there are not any reasons for supposing
that the ovary had been directly affected.
My notes tell me that, on April 12, the male was very nois&gt;
and restless, and " wants proper female and to go to nest." Or

It is not unlikely that, if I had been acquainted with tin
ways of the breeding Quail Finch, at any rate with the eccentrici
ties of this erratic female, I should have had fully-bred fledgeling
in June instead of September. I know now, what I did no
suspect then, that this female--perhaps others too--lays one egj
and immediately commences to sit; she docs uot lay ho second eg^
until after the lapse of several days ; and then there comes anotlie
pause before the third appears. Moreover, the old black-bille&amp;lt;
female used to sit well, and would not leave the nest unless
touched it. The superior creature who has succeeded her, oi
the contrary, is too grand to admit that she has anything to J
with either the nest, the eggs or the male. Her curious behaviou

and fickleness combined misled me, and caused me to commit a
big blunder.
The nest was built 011 the side of a steep slope. For a
while all went well, and then the male became uneasy. I tried
to find out what was wrong; the female was never near the nest
that I could detect, but seemed to pass the time, as she still does,
showing herself off 011 a high perch ; and so I concluded that it
had been deserted and proceeded to examine it. I found two
eggs in the nest, one dark, the other newly laid, while a third lay
on the grass outside. The male Quail Finch is a vain little
fellow, and is never so happy as when carrying feathers, and the
larger the feather the greater his joy and pride ; he had been
carrying feather after feather into the nest until the inside was
on or above the level of the aperture and an egg had rolled out;
this is what had disturbed his equanimity. I broke the dark egg,
and was annoyed to find that it contained a live chick nearly
ready to leave the shell--the nest had not been deserted after all ;
the egg which had rolled some inches down the slope had been
incubated for a few days. I deepened the shallow depression
without disturbing the nest, but the birds would not return to it.
On the next nest the female sat well (but always flying oft
on any one entering the aviary), but she was flooded out by the
rain; and a third, which I found recently with three eggs in it,
had probably been deserted from the same cause.
The fourth nest was a reconstruction of No. 2. I had
become so accustomed to failures that I thought little of the
Quail Finches, and was so much occupied with other matters that
I was unaware of its existence until the sprightly behaviour of
the male during the interval of lovely weather between the rains
of August brought him under my notice. The destruction of all
the other notable nests by the returning rains made me settle my
attention for a time 011 his goings 011, for, saving the Violet-eared
Waxbills, he was my last hope for the year of anything new.
When that delightful little spell of fair weather occurred in
August, was there ever a manikin so happy and proud as the
male Quail Finch ! Here at last was the sun ; his fourth nest for
this year was progressing favourably and success was in view.
How he held himself up and strutted about ! Were ever his

Mr. R. Philupps,
waistcoat and tie so smart and so bright--and how he did sing !
Alas, the return of the rains soon took the starch out of his
collar; and limp and dejected he was once more as he went
about his business.
The nest was on a piece of flat ground, quite in the open,
and might at any time be flooded. The old birds were very
secretive; they never approached it from the front but always
sneaked round from the back ; when I entered the aviary, the
female would fly on to a high perch, while the male watched my
every movement from an opposing bank. Nevertheless I decided
at all risks to place a shelter over it, which I did in the form ot a
table, with long straddling legs pushed into the ground as far
away as possible, the top having a list in order to shoot the water
off into the safest direction : happily the birds did not desert
their young ones, notwithstanding their dislike to having any-
thing above them. Instinctively they seem to dread anything
that may obstruct and interfere with their upward spring.
On what date the young ones commenced to leave the nest
I do not know. The nest had been full ; and I had noticed
with concern, for I did not suspect the cause, that it was not so
full, that it contained only one after all. This one came out early
on August 31st ; on that day the nest was empty. The youngster
was with her father ; although some yards away, she resented my
inspection ; and I was surprised to find not only that she was
strong on her legs but that she could fly well. O11 the following
morning, I was well pleased to find her in the company of a
second fledgeling, which was evidently some days her senior. O11
both of these occasions I had noticed not only the presence of
the father but also of another red-billed bird which, in my
hurried glance, I had supposed to be the mother. On September
2nd I had an opportunity of counting heads, and found that there
were not less that six Quail Finches in the aviary, or an increase
of three. The following morning was bright and warm, and the
youngsters so strong and alert that I felt I might safely make a
fuller examination (with the binocular). I found that the red-
billed bird was a fledgeling; he stood up side by side with his
father, and the two bills were equally red and brilliant. This is
rather startling. If he had come out of No. 2 nest, which is not

absolutely impossible, would the father have kept company with
him, and have allowed him to associate with the others? The
five (the odd female was never anywhere near) were on the most
affectionate terms--and this species is intolerant of intruders.
Moreover, although there might have been more, I cannot think
that there could have been less than three in the last nest. On
one occasion when I inserted my forefinger, the nest had appeared
to be so full I had supposed that the mother must have been
inside--a most improbable supposition, and she certainly did not
fly off as I withdrew. Of course there may be another nestling
about somewhere, alive or dead, which I have not noticed.
I experienced difficulty in noting the plumage of the young
birds. The foliage in the aviary is thick, and there is still long
grass, etc., about; and I had to exercise care lest I disturbed other
nests. They lie concealed under a tussock ; and, when at length
they are located, out they trot in different directions, fidget rest-
lessly about for a brief span--and then in a moment there are
five little creatures bobbing about in every direction, but mostly
behind the trees--and one is nonplussed. The following notes,
taken on August 31 and three following days, are the best that
I have to offer.
No. 1, a fine male, with bright crimson bill ; the white
face-lines boldly marked ; but I cannot satisfy myself that there
is any black about face or throat unless it be a shade just below
and edging the white chin. The bars more conspicuous and
diffused than in the father (the two stood up together side by
side, and directly facing me), especially about the upper breast,
and encroaching on the throat ; sides liberally washed with pale
chestnut; under parts light brown without a trace of chestnut
that I could detect. Legs not noted.
No. 2, doubtless a male, very like the last but generally
more brownish; bill slaty horn ; the legs and feet of this and the
following bird light flesli-pink.
No. 3, doubtless a female, differing from the others in
general colour, a gray bird, with all the markings much less
pronounced ; a faint wash of chestnut on the sides ; under parts
pale sandy ; bill black.
The rains recommenced on September 4, so I have not

Mr. R. Phillipps,
since disturbed them. They are very active and alert, flying
readily and easily ; they are always attended by the father and
usually by the mother; the father is most attentive, especially to
his little daughter, whom he accompanies like a shadow, even on
the wing.
While inspecting the fledgelings, on two occasions I
obtained a good view of the mother. She seemed to be washed
all over with pale isabelline. The bill, when viewed from the
side, was bright crimson like the male's, but with the culmen
dark brown or black--quite different from that of the ordinary
female, which has only the lower mandible red and that not bright.
With me the nests, about three a summer, have been built
of grass or hay and lined with feathers, the male doing ail the
carrying. They have been well-builded, neat, compact, and strong,
and not in any sense " rough " (Stark). As a rule when a bird--
the Violet-eared Waxbill for instance--uses growing grass for
his nest, he catches hold of a blade and tugs away until he tears
it up or breaks it off; it is done by brute force. One day this
summer, I watched the male Quail Finch for some minutes
through a binocular. The nest (No. 2) was about a foot off the
path (along which I rarely trespass during the summer), quite
out of sight amidst some thick wheat-grass, and doubtless the
female was inside. The bird went to the edge of the path on the
opposite side, where also there was a thick growth of grass--he
did not touch any on the side where the nest was situated --cut
off a length of some six inches and carried it to the nest; again
and again he returned, cutting off each blade with his bill as
easily and quickly as with a pair of scissors. I have not myself
been witness to anything like it in all my life that I can
remember.
The nest has invariably been placed on the ground, in
thick growing grass, wheat, or oats, on rising or sloping ground
from preference. I think this year's nests 2 and 4 were placed
on the particular site occupied because it was open and especially
favoured by the sun. Unlike those of our Willow Wrens (speak-
ing broadly of our three common Phylloscopi ), not only are the
nests built in the open but anything in the way of a bush or
skirt thereof is avoided ; they are birds of the open and detest a

thicket. It is a good large compact ball, very roomy inside, with
the aperture well down and almost on a level with the ground
outside, and well concealed if the grass be long enough to hide
it. The eggs are white ; and the usual number to the clutch is
probably four or five (N.S. IV., 213) ; I think , with me, three has
been a more usual number; but the Quail Finch is a queer
character ; and two addled eggs which I found placed together
in a spot some 6ft. from the last nest may have been carried
thither when found to be of no use. Incubation is carried on
almost entirely by the female, but the male is constantly on guard
close by, and probably slips in when the female comes off to
feed. Sir William Ingram's experiences of last March (p. 174)
were abnormal, I should suppose.
The adults of this species are certainly fond of tiny insect
life ; with what exactly they fed their young I do not know. On
not a few occasions I saw the father battling manfully with a
large mealworm, but this is the utmost that I could detect; and
absolutely nothing could be observed after the young had left the
nest, for they were all too retired and too much 011 the alert.
Excepting when disturbed, they were very quiet and se-
cretive. Now and then I heard a lot oi low-toned clacking
whispers, as if they were having a family confabulation, but all
was carried 011 in voices too subdued to attract attention. On
being approached and aroused, the notes of both young and old
were alike as far as I could observe.
The Quail Finch will take freely to bare perches, even the
highest, which indeed it favours as offering the more extensive
view, an important point with this tiny species. Only on very
rare occasions will it perch in a tree, and then a leafless bough or
twig will be selected.
It gets over the ground by means of walking, tiny runs,
and little jumps. Owing to its legs being so short, it keeps to
bare ground as much as possible in every-day life, and is very
fond of basking in the sun.
The flight is undulating, and, in my reserved aviary, jerky,
a sort of dancing in the air ; but, when the two aviaries are
thrown into one and there is plenty of space, the undulating
flight is very fairly rapid. While on the wing, they are rarely

silent, but utter a characteristic monosyllabic note by means of
which the members of a family are enabled to keep in touch with
one another.
The name "Quail Finch" is convenient but misleading,
for there is nothing of the Quail about the species: "Ground-
Finch" would be better. Stark calls it the " Bar-breasted Weaver
Finch"; why the word "Weaver" should have been brought in
does not appear, while either "Bar-breasted Finch" or "Bar-
breasted Ground Finch " would have been suitable. The only
other species in the genus, Ortygospiza alricollis , since the name
Quail Finch has become so firmly established in this country for
O. polyzona, might be known as the Black-necked or Black-
chinned Quail Finch when it arrives--and it may arrive any day.
Unfortunately, sometimes when our species is badly kept, it loses
its white chin and becomes melanistic ; when given plenty of
liberty, however, it retains its proper colours.
No account of the Quail Finch would be complete without
some reference to the ravishing song of the male.
When I was a boy, there was a certain cottager's garden
which had in it a large cherry tree ; and year by year, as the
season of cherries came round, in order to frighten away the
birds, the old man used to fix up in the tree a clapper arrange-
ment which was worked by a diminutive windmill. As the sails
revolved, two heavy loosely-hung pieces of iron were banged
against an empty gunpowder canister--a common object in old
muzzle-loading days--with results which were more audible than
musical; and I do not know of anything that reminds me so
much of this ingenious contrivance of the old cottager as the
staccato song of the Quail Finch, which goes somewhat as fol-
lows :-- Click clack cloik clike check deck click cloik cluck click deck
clack cluck clike cloik, etc., etc. Now if this score be read slowly,
it may appear a little tedious; it should be galloped through, as
when a gust whirls round the arms of the windmill, and great
care must be exercised lest a slur or false note be uttered ; and,
as the wind is uncertain and unequal, so the song bursts forth at
one time with startling suddenness, at another just for a little spell,
at another for a prolonged period, according to the spirit of the
moment. I am conscious that no combination of words which

September 13th.--The plumage of the young birds has
developed rapidly, so much so that, yesterday, I was doubtful of
the identity of three out of five Quail Finches--all I could see--
the father and his little daughter alone being recognisable. Of
the five, four had dark bills ; and all of these four had the under-
parts more or less washed with isabelline ; and two had black 011
the throat. The weather is so bad, and the aviary is overgrown
that satisfactory observations are impossible.

are alive and well.

By G. A. Momber.
Lately, on finding in our September number an article
entitled " Morality in Birds," my hopes rose high. At last I was
to be told what I had long waited to hear. I was to be admitted
to a new thought, to be answered questions I had not skill to put.
But with the opening sentence the page grew dark. Instead of
being shown the sky-laws at work in nature, instead of finding
the moral sentiment discerned and expounded in the Kingdom of
Birds, I was flatly informed that morality in them was not. In
proof thereof followed a catalogue of the errors of judgment
perpetrated by captives in aviaries. Nothing was affirmed,
nothing brought, and I felt robbed of something that was mine
by such negation of character to my friends. Nor was conceding
mention made even of the manifest good traits in birds, the
palpable virtues we all can see: their altruism and devotion and
diligence in the cause of others ; their fortitude under stress and
courage in making the best of bad times ; their genial response
to prosperity and fair weather ; their self-reliance in solitude and
adaptability in society. To chronicle a list of misdeeds in
aviaries,--murders and misalliances,--and then to impute all the
vices to the feathered tribes, seemed too unjust to pass un-
challenged, though birds may be trusted in the end to ply an

abler quill in their own defence, and with less danger of entangle-
ment in so perilous a net as the philosophy of ethics.
Of course, fallacy underlies the title. Morality, the doctrine
and practice of moral duties, the standard of right and wrong,
how can it be applied to the wild creatures of nature ? Especially
how can it be looked for when these are brought by man into the
unnatural conditions of captivity ? I11 vain we seek it in other
men, until by knowledge they have attained will, and then it
seems to be more an aspiration than a fulfilment.
Can we not endorse in wild creatures the original impulse
and the skill that comes without experience, except we demand
also to see our human aims accomplished ? What is evil but the
continuation in man of the animal&apos;s necessary and implanted
instinct? Evil begins with consciousness, and the violation of
the moral sentiment. In wild animals there is no evil ; though
in the higher domestic animals there is already a conscience,
inculcated by man, and some sense of right and wrong. But if
wild animals are incapable of wrong-doing, through having no
scale or norm, we can yet find traces of virtue in them when they
by will set aside their own advantage for the good of others. We
can still discern them on the side of the angels.
Domesticated birds are commonly considered degraded,
but it would not be safe to deny them all virtue. Guinea-fowls
have lost their parental qualities, but they adhere to monogamy.
The gander may have so far forgotten himself that he takes more
than one goose to spouse, but he retains a fatherly care for his
offspring. The Homing Pigeon is an emblem ot domestic faith-
fulness, the Gamecock a symbol of courage. Swans keep intact
every sterling good quality.
In face of what our scientific friends tell us, that the Class
Aves is a side growth in the general development, and out of the
race for progress, it is curious to compare it with the higher Class
Mammals, in point of mentality. Maternal instinct, that funda-
mental provision of nature's, without which no species could
survive, makes heroines alike among vertebrates and insects.
But of all wild creatures, it is birds that chiefly show the
domestic virtues, a long stride in the direction of morality.
With the possible exception of a few of the higher apes,

about which little is known, the males of mammals are-
progenitors, not mates or parents. Whereas it is certain that
many of the larger birds, Swans, Cranes, Eagles, Ravens,.
Parrots, pair for life and live in pairs ; that the smaller species
are monogamous, pairing probably afresh for each nesting season,,
and that in almost all birds, except a few polygamous groups, the
male takes a part in nest building, in incubation and in tending,
and afterwards guiding the young.
Leaving aside the dog, whose centuries of close fellowship
with man place him quite apart, there are in mammals no mental
qualities which cannot be found at least equalled in birds : when
wild, quickness to detect danger, and that in spite of having little
or no sense of smell; acuteness and memory to avoid it; readi-
ness to seize opportunity. When brought under the influence
of man ; tractability, faithfulness and affection. There are many
anecdotes to bear out these points. Here it must suffice to
instance the trained Hawk, the fishing Cormorant, Cranes that
have been taught to round up and bring home the cows; the
Crow that follows his master on his walks or rides, flying from
tree to tree ; the singular devotion of Parrots to their owner ;
the intelligent recognition and friendliness that all birds, even
the smallest, wild and captive, show to the person who is good to
them.
It is mostly impossible to tame wild mammals taken adult ;
this applies far less to birds; in fact the haggard or wild-caught
Hawks make the best when trained.
Birds are nature's darlings, loaded with advantages. They
stand for beauty, but their elegance and vivacity form a part
Duly of their attractiveness. It is theirs to celebrate motion
in its most perfect forms. Such grace and power lead them
naturally to sociable, pleasurable exercises. Who has not
admired the wheeling flights of flocks of Starlings or Dunlins;
hundreds of birds carried by one impulse into sweeping curves
and returns, wave-like rise and fall; each pair of wings exactly
adjusted to its place in the dance, and all at the same instant
tilting to new angles of light, now the dusky backs, now the
clearer flanks.
Birds are artists. Taste they show, and plastic skill and a
sense of symmetry, in the weaving and binding, stitching and

moulding, plastering and tunnelling of their nests--marvellous
examples of workmanship, often most pleasing, always har-
monious with their surroundings. But above this constructive-
ness, they exult in a higher gift, one they share exclusively with
man, to whom conceivably they taught it--the gift of cheerful
song, of melodious expression. The drowsy man of sense may
call it a love ditty, the musical formalist may try his sense of
pitch to score the notes, but try in vain to report the chant, for
nature's wild melodies will not be described by our laws of
harmony. Yet, rapture or challenge, war-lay or recital, there is in
bird-song the archetype of poet and minstrel. In this universal
utterance vibrates inspiration, a passion and an enthusiasm you
cannot go behind.
There is somewhat of inspiration, too, in the mysterious
migration frenzy that drives them with unerring periodicity to
change their hemisphere, to change their leisurely day-time
habits for urgent midnight wing-marches, their earthly haunts
for a track across the starlit skies. Would we see the impossible
accomplished ? It is done, when the slow-winged Rails leave
the thick herbage in which they skulked all summer and become
tireless, dauntless voyagers across the Mediterranean ; when tiny
Goldcrests and Tits, that hesitate to flit from one fir tree to the
next, take the North Sea at a flight.
Lux mea dux might be their cry, as, leaving earth and
clouds beneath them, they wing their way without guide or
landmark to the unknown.
Perhaps, instead of wondering at nature's lavish bounty to
birds, we should see the inevitableness that their physical and
mental traits should complement each other. Perhaps wise
Spenser was right:
" For of the soul, the body form doth take,
For soul is form, and doth the body make."

Sir, --I am very glad to see Mr. Astley's letter in the October number
of the Avicultural Magazine. I fancy I wrote some years ago on the same
subject. It is a waste of space and money introducing figures of common
birds in our Magazine. What we want is illustrations of something we have
not seen before or are not very likely to see. The Levaillant's Barbet is a
good example in this month's part. James Cooper.

A LITTLE-KNOWN POSE OF THE KAGU.
Rhinochetus jubatus.
By Arthur Denman, M.A.
</table>
<bodyText confidence="0.97904072" page_id="58072417"  page_num="51" year="" vol="">
Of all the birds in the Western Aviary at the Zoo, probably
that which calls forth the warmest expressions of admiration is
the Kagu of New Caledonia. In repose a forlorn object, re-
sembling a cut-down Heron or a diminutive Crane, on the proper
calls and signals being held out to it by its intimate friends, it
will almost surely respond by elevating its mane-like crest,
swelling itself out in the most portentously dignified manner,
and following any bit of white material shown to it. Thus it can
be induced to strut, with wings and breast protruded, and utter-
ing a curious, subdued, crooning noise like the commencement
of a hen's cackle, round and round, and through between, the
visitor's legs.
In its strutting attitude it is admirably portrayed in Cage
Birds, of 18th January, 1908. The attitude in which it is here
depicted is a much less common one, and one which I have
reason to believe it was not generally known to assume.
The Kagu first exhibited its tendency to show off in this
ivay to me some eighteen months ago, when I was poking meal-
worms through the wires of its cage. It stared very hard at my
Tiger, and then, very gradually, opened its wings, bending them
)ver and forwards, as shown here. The barring of the primaries,
consisting of alternating, peculiarly delicate, mottled grey,
slightly tinged with rufous) and black, is remarkable ; for not
1 sign of any colour other than a pale slaty grey is visible at
&gt;ther times.

Mr. H. Goodchild,
The bird constantly assumed this, to me, new pose for
several weeks; and, at the Superintendent s lequest, X met Md.
Berridge with a view to obtaining a photograph. Then , of course,
it obstinately refused to pose, and it was not until late in this
summer that the picture here given was obtained.
What either of the displays spoken of indicate I do not
profess to know. One would imagine that the strut was a love
posture but for the fact that, not infrequently, the bird makes a
dash at the boot-buttons or the trousers of the visitor in any-
thing but a loving way. The display shown here may be, and
probably is, a fighting attitude; though the bird's attention
seems always to be fixed far more on the mealworm than on the
finger, and the moment that the latter is withdrawn and a shirt-
cuff shown, it will reassume the strutting walk and will follow
the whole length of the cage without the least sign of animosity.
The Kagu is a bird of moods. There are days together
during which it cannot be induced to do anything. It generally
transpires that this condition follows on its having been fright-
ened by some small child ; but even when thus " off colour," its
beautiful ruby eyes never fail to observe any dropped mealworm.
The Assistant Superintendent told me that this bird is,
unfortunately, extremely rare--in fact, in a fair way to becoming
extinct--and he explained this by saying that the French, tc
whom New Caledonia belongs, like an easy shot. Certainly, il
the Kagu in its natural surroundings is in the habit of describing
figures of eight round the legs of the chasseurs, it must afford
an ideal quarry for " le sportman " !

WILD BIRDS ABOUT HODDAM CASTLE.

By H. Goodchild.
A kindly fate, to which I have been indebted for mor&amp;lt;
than one pleasant outing, allowed my making a postponed visi
to the North, at a time of the year when I most like to be out o
London, for in the latter half of July, 1909, I left St. Pancra:
Station, bound for Hoddam Castle, in Dumfriesshire, 011 a visitt(
our esteemed member, Mr. K. J. Brook.

that season, for if the weather is fine, it is less hot and oppressive
in Scotland than in London, and if one is engaged during the
day, as I was, there are the long summer evenings and the tardy
twilight of the North, in which to make observations of one's
feathered neighbours. My arrangements, to my regret, did not
permit of my breaking my journey to visit the Lake District, and
I looked wistfully at the moorlands of Westmoreland as the train
passed amongst them, and consoled myself with the thought that
I was going to a district that was new to me, and which might_
as it did--yield me the sight of birds not commonly met with in
the country I was afterwards to visit. All I saw to note on my
journey were Peewits in the North of England and Gulls as we
skirted the Solway, while on the drive from the town of Annan to
Hoddam, the Yellow Bunting was heard singing from his
favourite twigs in the hawthorn hedges, and the Partridge calling
close to the Castle.
The first morning there (July 22nd), I found the Green-
finch still singing in the Castle gardens, and heard him again in
the afternoon, but T. brushes and Blackbirds had already stopped,
it seemed. Mr. Brook most kindly arranged that in the evening
I should have some fishing in the River Annan, which flows
through the grounds, near the Castle, and under the care of a
stalwart Scot, I waded in, fully equipped for even a salmon,
should an unsophisticated one take my fly, but I saw more of
birds than of the sea trout that were my hope and quarry. I
caught a tiny fish that I should have been ashamed to kill, had a
rise from another, and like nearly all the other fishermen 011 the
river just then, got nothing worth taking. Gulls flew over, and
as I waded, a Dipper passed me only a dozen yards or so away,
which is much nearer than they come to one in the Westmorland
Gills. The fisherman who accompanied me having expressed his
opinion that the wind was in the wrong " airt " for fishing, or else
that the sea trout had gone further up stream, I relinquished the
rod into his experienced hand, and contented myself with
ornithology. A11 adult Lesser Black-backed Gull went over
about half past eight, flying up stream, and a flockof twenty-three
Black-headed Gulls--their heads almost white--passed up also.
Other Gulls were seen, but at too great a distance to be identified.

Mr. H. Goodchild,
Oil the morrow, an alternately bright and cloudy sky
brought out the Yellow Bunting, which I found singing near the
aviaries, and the Greenfinch also, close by, in full song. The
lawns were frequented by the male Bunting, but I never saw his
mate. The Grey Wagtail had bred in the courtyard of the
Castle, I was told, and I noticed one running over the stones in
an ornamental basin in the gardens. In the evening, for the
second time, I went fishing, and again had a tug from a fish in
mid-stream that I should like to have caught, but as before, only
caught a little one. This time the Grey Wagtail was in evidence
on the pebbly sides of the river bed ; and at nine o clock, I saw
the Sandpiper, which Mr. Brook told me breeds in a wood lower
down, flit over a pool close to me. Cater on at 9-4* this birds
distinctive piping was heard as it flitted over the water.
On July 24th, as I went out to the aviaries, I heard mouse-
like sounds, thin and unmusical, kept up by several voices,
coming from some young fir trees that flanked one of the lawns,
and these I found to my delight, came from those little gems of
British birds, the Golden-crested Wrens, a party of which, three
or four young, were being fed by one of the parents, fl hese
birds, which were probably hatched in the immediate vicinity of
the aviaries, were seen again and often heard, during my visit.
A pair of Willow Wrens also, were seen hunting the fir trees, and
a party of four Thrushes hunted over the lawns, while again, the
Greenfinch and the Yellow Bunting were heard in song. In the
evening, my friend the Dipper showed itself, alighting 011 a stone
opposite to me 011 the river, from which it seemed loth to move ;
the Sandpipers were seen and later on, in the twilight, repeatedly
heard from the river. The musical piping of Curlews was heard,
but the birds could not be seen anywhere, and at midnight, Owls
were serenading us close to the Castle.
The next day, Sunday, was wet, but not too wet for me to
go out, and I added the Spotted Fly-catcher to my list, and saw a
bird I thought was a Kestrel, but it only flew straight over, and
did not hover. Many Greenfinches were heard and many Chaf-
finches seen and on the outskirts of the park, the Woodpigeon
was found in plenty. One of these last was observed alternately
flapping and sailing so that it looked like a Hawk and I thought

it was one until X looked at it witli tlie binocular. In tlie ev6uiii (r
I walked towards Lockerbie, and the Corncrake, Curlew,
Partridge, Yellow Bunting, and Woodpigeon, were all heard or
seen, at eight o'clock. Rain was falling quietly at the time and
two Corncrakes were heard at once near together, the call of one
being slower and lower pitched than the other. I went to the
field (of seed grass I think) whence I heard them, and then it
seemed the sound came from three different parts of it at once,
and it came also from adjoining fields up to 8.40, but when I
mentioned the fact to Mr. Brook the next day, he told me that
the sound was believed to be ventriloquous, so that after all,
tliere might only have been the two birds whose voices differed.
On the Monday, I found the Yellow Bunting still singing
but did not hear the Greenfinch. I again heard the Gold-
crests and saw one of them. The River Annan was in flood
and I saw the Dipper and the Sandpipers go past, and the Black-
headed Gulls flew overhead. There is a tract of moorland
between the Castle and the town of Annan, and at night as I
passed it about a quarter past nine, I heard what I took to be a
Snipe drumming, and making the " Jik-Jak " sound, but it was
distant and indistinct, and I did not feel sure of it.
I he next day, at one o'clock, just as I was passing the
aviary where the Parrakeets are kept, I had a splendid view of
an apparently male Sparrow-hawk sailing over it, so close that
I thought the bird was going to alight on the top of the wires.
1 his was the first time in my life I had had a good view of a
Spairow-hawk in a state of nature, and not often have I seen it
even in captivity. Cole Tits were heard, and one was seen in the
afternoon about three : they were calling to each other as they
hunted over the young fir trees. The Yellow Bunting still sang,
and I heard what I took to be the song of the Willow Wren, but
as I did not see the bird, and the sound was not near, I could not
be sure. Por the third time, the Goldcrests were seen, and
several were heard, as also was the Blue Tit, and I had a good
view at close quarters of a Wood Wren. The Curlew was heard,
but still I could not get a sight of it.
Being so near the place with the supposed unpronounceable
name--Ecclefechan, the birthplace of Thomas Carlyle--I felt I

Mr. H. GooDCHir/D,
ought to pay it a visit, and about 9 p.111. set off. As I passed
through a grove of trees which overhung the road, I heard the
mewing cat-like noise of an Owl, so cat-like indeed, that it had
seemingly deceived a kitten, which wandered out from a
neighbouring house on to the road, mewing in response. I saw
the Owl in one of the trees, though not well, but when it changed
its perch and flew into a tree with less dense foliage, I got a good
view of it and then saw the row of half light scapular feathers
characteristic of the Brown or Wood Owl.
The heavy rains of the previous two days had stopped, and
by 9.20 the wind had gone down and the clouds were high and
there was a red sunset. Peewits were heard crying, and soon
after, the grating cry of a Heron was heard as the bird flew
towards the river, but the bird itself could not be seen.
On the Wednesday, the usual birds were seen or heard,
and in the evening, as I stood watching along with the aviary
attendant, from the stone bridge over the Annan by the entrance
to the Castle grounds, a fine Black-backed Gull, which at the
first glance I thought was a Heron, flew into view and down
down to the low end of the pool beneath us, and poised
itself as it seemed, over the water with its white head looking
down. We saw it plunge once, but even with my powerful
binocular I could not see if it had caught anything. From the
bridge we could discern, in a field some distance off, about a
hundred Gulls, probably the Black-headed, one of which species
flew over us as we watched. A small bird which might have
been a female Redstart chatted from a wire fence, but was too
restive for me to identify it.
O11 the Thursday my only notes record that on the moor
lying between Hoddam Castle and the town of Annan, I heard
the drummin g of the Common Snipe and also the "Jik-Jak ?&gt;
sound they make when on the wing, and that both sounds were
heard at once at 9 p.m., also that the Peewit was heard calling.
In the evening of July 30th, for the first time this visit,
I actually saw the Curlew, a string of seven or eight nearly in a
line, passing 11s flying towards the Solway at 7. I had gone up
Repentance Hill, as it is named, which stands by itself and over-
looks the Castle and the River Annan, as the evening was beauti-

fully clear,and it looked as if, with the clouds that were about,
there was going to be a fine sunset. From the top of this hill, we
could see not only the Solway, but also the Lake District Mountains
and the far-away Pennines, but both were topped with mist and
somewhat indistinct.
On the Saturday, a bird which looked like a Sparrow-hawk
flew over me, while I was working outside the aviaries, but it
disappeared behind a tree before I could get the glass on to it.
Cole Tits were heard singing and the Willow Wren also.
The early part of Sunday, August ist, was dull, but looked
like coming out a fine day, a promise which was fulfilled, and I
again went towards the only piece of primaeval moorland that I
knew of in the district, and on the way heard the Wren singinu&apos;
a very brief song, in a very half-hearted way, and a Robin giving
alarm without any apparent reason for it. A batch of Gulls was
seen circling round in a peculiar way, but I could not identify
them. A Black-headed Gull, with his head half white, went over
and I saw his wings were interspersed with the drab feathers.
Then a Curlew came over from the moorland, flying east, and
settled in a pasture among some Rooks, which I noticed moved
away a few feet to make room for it. Three or four Missel
Thrushes were seen in the same pasture and a Greenfinch in the
hedge was heard giving his characteristic song, cpiite loud and
full. A Woodpigeon passed and a pair of adult Black-backed
Gulls went over, flying towards the Nith. I went on to the moor
itself, but saw and heard nothing of Snipe or other birds such as
one would expect to see there, and only as I retraced my steps I
saw a pair of Stock Doves go flying towards the Solway, passing
near enough to me to show the absence of white on the rump and
the wings. In the evening, on the road to Lockerbie at 7.35, I
noticed a Wren chatting nervously from the upper part of a young
fir, and clinging on to the upright stem and with the glasses I saw
it had food in its beak ; immediately after, I heard the song of
the male close by, and when he caught sight of me, he too,
chatted his alarm note, while the female simply crossed the road
in front of me and disappeared into the quickset hedge.
My last recorded item was of another pair of Black-backed
Gulls which, at 7.45, I saw winging their way towards the Solway
Firth.

Mr. C. Barnby Smith,
Despite the fact that primaeval moorland was only repre-
sented by a moderate sized patch, and that of other uncultivated
ground there was none to speak of in the vicinity of Hoddam
Castle, I saw the Sparrow-Hawk, the Goldcrests, Stock Doves,
Sandpipers and Gulls, all birds which I only saw in this district,
for although the)&apos;' do occur in the part I know best, it was not my
good fortune to meet with them there this year.

Bv C. Barnby Smith.
For some years past I have been anxious to get Turnstones
(,Strepsilas interpres ), but, although I wearied dealers with repeated
orders, yet I was never able to get the birds until a few months
ago, when a friend kindly presented me with a pair.
The Turnstone does not seem to be as commonly kept in
captivity as many other little Waders, but few birds are more
interesting. It is quite small--only nine inches long--that is
rather smaller than a Knot, and its chestnut and black and white
plumage render it far more ornamental. It is of a cheerful and
friendly disposition ; indeed, when my birds arrived they walked
out of the basket and began to search for food, as though they
had been in their new quarters all their lives. Nor do the birds
seem difficult to suit in the way of food, thriving well on chopped
raw meat, poultry food, chopped shrimps, crissel and live mag-
gots. In one thing only was I disappointed with my birds at
first, namely, they would not justify their common name and
seemed quite indisposed to turn any little stones that happened
to be in their run. I guessed that it was merely a case ot
dormant instinct, and that the birds had had a good deal of
artificial food provided without any necessity for search. I
accordingly put a dozen or so of shells in the run--varying in
size from mussel shells to very large oyster shells--and for a
week or so the birds' food was usually placed under these shells,
a few live maggots being put under one of the largest shells.
The result was at once encouraging. Almost after the first day
the Turnstones fully realised the situation and, as soon as I had
left the run, they would go to the shells, put their bills under

them, and jerk the shells over with a sudden, almost impercep-
tible movement. Sometimes one bird would follow a shell and
jerk it three or four times over with great rapidity.
It was interesting to note a pair of Avocets, an Indian
Plover, and a Ringed Plover, all waiting more or less helpless
until the Turnstones relieved the situation by getting rid of the
obnoxious shells that hid the choicest bits of food. I am bound
to say, as far as the Indian Plover was concerned, he did not seem
grateful, he being somewhat short in temper--perhaps owing to

flee hastily to avoid his wrath, as soon as they had turned a shell
or two and brought some tempting maggots into view.
The largest shells would often in the morning be several
yards distant from the place where they were placed the previous
evening, and were usually left with the convex side downwards.
I have never seen both Turnstones working at the same shell
together in unison, as they are said to do.
Professor Patten mentions an instance of some Turnstones
being in an enclosure with some newly-liatched quail chicks,
which the Turnstones kept jerking over and over in their search
for food until the poor little chicks all succumbed to the rough
treatment.

them, and so gave them some thin zinc plates (each 4^ inches
s&apos;qnare) laid flat 011 the food, which was pressed down, these
plates I found were seldom turned over, the size being too great,
but the birds might be seen with their bills under the edge of a
plate diligently levering it little by little out of the way.
I next cut the zinc plates about three inches square, and
fastened one to a quarter-pound flat scale weight and a similar
plate to a half-pound weight. The quarter-pound weight was
readily turned over and removed some distance. The half-pound
weight was occasionally turned over when maggots were placed
underneath, but it was quite plain that this weight in this form
was not easy for the little birds as, whilst this heavy weight was
only turned once or twice over, the oyster shells would on the
same day be made to travel quite long distances.
I next got a one-pound weight (a scale weight with ring on
the top) standing one-and-a-half inches square on the ground,,
and placed a few maggots underneath. This weight was repeat-
edly knocked over on one side and the maggots eaten. A similar
two-pound weight, standing two inches square, was apparently
too heavy to be knocked over, but the ground at the side was
undermined and a good many maggots extracted by this means.
The one-pound weight was so readily knocked over that I am
inclined to think that, under pressure of hunger, a Turnstone
would upset a similar scale weight of at least i |lbs.
No doubt the short legs of the Turnstones are very suit-
able for their peculiar operations in enabling them to get good
leverage.
The contrast between these little birds at work, and the
long-legged Avocets standing by and either helplessly " scything"
the sand, or giving encouraging cries of " squick-squick " to the
Turnstones, is very striking.
I find my Turnstones seldom call much during the day-
time, but, like Knots, they seem to grow excited about sunset
and their peculiar sharp cry may be then repeatedly heard.

By Major H. Jones.
I do not think it has been generally noticed that the female
of the " Paradise Duck of New Zealand " (Casarca variegata ) after
the breeding season--from the beginning of May to the end of
July--assumes what may be called an eclipse plumage.
Soon after the breeding season she begins to acquire a
plumage somewhat like the male on the back, mantle, flanks and
belly; the latter has a few chestnut feathers here and there, but
the back, mantle and scapulars are entirely black, vermiculated
with fine lines of white exactly as in the male ; the flanks and
belly are the same, with the exception of the few chestnut
feathers above mentioned ; the breast, however, remains chest-
nut, with some of the feathers slightly vermiculated with black
and white at the tips. The rest of the plumage remains through-
out as usual and does not alter in any wav. The change back to
ordinary plumage begins by the feathers of the back becoming
gradually chestnut from the base, leaving the vermiculations on
the tip and some way down the sides of the feathers; most
feathers gradually become quite chestnut, but some retain the
vermiculated tips all the year.
The change does not appear to be effected by a moult, but
by actual change in the colour of the feather. The breast and
belly become quite chestnut, but in some skins I have seen the
vermiculations on the tip and sides of the feather, which seem to
remain to a certain extent. I have noticed this change iti the
birds in the Zoological Gardens for several years past, but this
year I not only watched the change every week, but I have made
drawings of the bird in both states of plumage.
Now, I do not know whether this is the normal state ot
things, or can it be possible that the bird now in the Gardens is a
barren one. It cannot be that it is a female assuming male
plumage as in the Pheasants, as she throughout retains her
white head, &amp;c. and also she changes back to the full breeding
plumage. Of course I cannot say that all the birds I have noticed
in bygone years were the same ones, but I think that what I have
stated applies to all specimens of this duck.

By Dr. A. G. Butler.
The Horned and Uvsean Parrakeets have been long known
to avicnlturists in England, as on the Continent; but whereas
our Continental friends seem to find no difficulty in keeping them
alive and have even bred them successfully, the most expert of
English bird-lovers regard them as among the most delicate of
all the Psittaci.
The Hon. and Rev. Canon Dutton tells us that he once
bought eight Horned Parrakeets which looked health} 7 , but all
died, one after the other, of digestive troubles.
Mr. Seth-Smith also says of the two imported species :
"Both species are rare as cage-birds in this country, and very
little seems to be understood as to their correct treatment. Both
appear to be decidedly delicate." He adds:--" The diet of these
Parrakeets in captivity is little understood, but the usual seeds
should certainly form the staple food, and a little ripe fruit
should be given every day. I should also be inclined to give
them occasionally milk-sop as recommended for Lorikeets"
On the other hand Dr. Russ, who (not regarding these birds
as especially delicate) may be considered a reliable authority,
recommends "all kinds of green food, chiefly salad " (by which I
should judge he would indicate lettuce, watercress, mustard and
cress, &amp;c.) and touching seeds he says:--"after millet, canary,
and hemp, it may be accustomed to all other kinds of seeds, fresh
ant-cocoons or ant-cocoon mixture with egg-bread, &amp;c. ; also
service-berries, a little apple, and mealworms."
After what Mr. Brook has told us recently of the intoxi-
cating nature of service-berries, I should be more inclined to
substitute grapes, and in place of egg-bread I should give sponge-
cake, though I suppose the latter does contain a certain quantity
of egg as well as turmeric or saffron. Anyway it is always easy
to obtain sponge-cake and most birds are very fond of it.
I think we may safely conclude that Dr. Russ obtained his
information respecting the feeding of Nyrtiphicus from Baron von
Comely who, in 1882, succeeded in breeding three hybrids be-
tween N. cornutus and N. uvcee?isis , and subsequently bred the

latter species. It might therefore be worth while for anyone
fortunate enough, in the future, to secure specimens of either of
the species, to try the same treatment.
As other Platycerchice occasionally indulge in a partly in-
sectivorous habit, there is no reason for supposing that ants' eggs
and mealworms would be unnatural food for Nymphicus , and it
may be that this and abundant green food are just the very
things they require to keep them in health.
Head of Uvz#an Horned Parrakeet.
(Nymphicus uvcsnsis ).
As my friend Mr. Seth-Smith well knows, I am no believer
in milk sop for any kind of parrot; it seems to me a hopelessly
unnatural food and one that I, personally, should never give to
any bird. I would always prefer to mash up stewed fruit with
sponge cake for them or, as Canon Dutton says,--dried fig and
bun scalded with boiling water and mashed up together.
[A few N. iivceensis have come into the market of late, and
one is on view at the Zoological Gardens ; I am told it talks a
little. This species is about the size and build of a Rosella; its
prevailing colour is green, with a red spot on the forehead and a
blackish mask, and blue 011 the large wing and tail-quills;
Ny 7 ?iphicus cornutus differs conspicuously by its crest being
composed of two long red-tipped feathers and by its yellow
nape-patch. Ed.]

My attempts to breed the Blue Grosbeak extend over a
period of five years, during which time I have had no less than
twelve clutches of eggs from this species. Eleven times I failed:
the twelfth time I succeeded. From this one might be tempted
to infer that this is not altogether an easy species to breed were
it not that I have noticed that one sometimes has an extraordinary
run of bad luck with some particular species. I shall not there-
fore go so far as to say that this is a difficult subject; nevertheless
I have a dim suspicion that the market is never likely to be
flooded with home-bred Blue Grosbeaks.
There are certain difficulties to be overcome before attain-
ing success, which are very much more real than apparent; one
finds them out gradually as one proceeds. To begin with, this
Grosbeak, though not exactly a quarrelsome bird, requires careful
watching, because he can, and will occasionally, do a lot of
damage with his powerful beak. For this reason I tried a pair
in a small enclosure in 1908, which they had entirely to them-
selves, but they simply played at nesting. They evidently
require a fairly large aviary, and, should any other species
attempt to nest in their neighbourhood, there will surely be
trouble. Then, again, the males are exceedingly uncertain in
the temper they show towards the females at the breeding season ;
atone moment they will be most affectionate : the next they will
be seen savagely pursuing their unfortunate partners, and I have
several times had eggs and young thrown out of the nest by the
male in an apparently uncontrollable fit of passion. Another
characteristic of this species, which has contributed to some of
my failures, is the exceedingly small size and flimsy construction
of the nest, which as a rule will barely contain the usual clutch
of three large eggs, and which, as soon as the young begin to
grow, invariably sags.
Then there is another consideration, which I put forward
only as a suggestion, my notes on the subject being derived from
observation of a single individual, and that is that the males
apparently take three years to attain the adult plumage and are

not inclined to mate in their second year. I have retained the
young male which I bred this season in order to test the accuracy
of this suggestion. This bird is now (18th Oct., 1909) in his first
moult, and he does not as yet show a single blue feather. In
their second season the males are sparsely blotched with dull
blue ; in their third year they have the full adult plumage, but
the colour increases in brilliancy up to the fifth year, more
especially the wash of cobalt on the forehead. There is no
difficulty in getting nests and eggs from this species. (I have had
no less than four clutches from one hen this summer), but the
rearing of the young, unless my experience is exceptional, re-
quires the most careful dieting and management.
The eggs of the Blue Grosbeak are large in comparison
with the size of the bird, -93 x *65 ; ground colour white with a
faint grey-blue tinge, thickly spotted and clouded towards the
upper end with reddish brown.
The two young which were reared this summer flew on
the 16th July. One was killed by the Blue-bearded Jays in the
same manner as the young Jerdou's Accentor recently mentioned :
the other I still have.
They were at first distinctly lighter and more washy in
colour than the adult hen, but when I parted with the adults in
September I should not have been able to distinguish the young
male from the adult female, had it not been for the much smaller
size of the beak of the former.

MORAL AND MENTAL ATTRIBUTES IN BIRDS.

I11 the Avicultural Magazine , 2nd ser., Vol. VI., pp. 210-
215, I published an article entitled " The Mind of a Bird," in
which I pointed out that, as Darwin had stated years before, the
senses, intuitions, and sensations of birds differed only from our
own in degree, that they stood high in the scale of intelligence
and were capable of considerable reasoning power.
On the other hand, as evidence that great mental enlighten-
ment does not necessarily march with a highly developed moral
sense, I published an article in Vol. VII., pp. 325-328, entitled
</bodyText>

66 Dr. A. G. Butler,
"Morality in Birds," in which I showed that their animal instincts
were depraved and not under control.
In the first volume of our third series, pp. 47 to 50, Mr.
G. A. Momber has an article on " Morals in Birds," in which he
questions the correctness of my deductions on the following
ground :--that Morality, as we understand it, cannot be applied
to the wild creatures of nature : this is the first statement made
in my own article, only I say that, in birds it does not exist; and,
in proof thereof I cite instances not only of errors of judgment
in captive birds, but in wild ones. Hybrids caught in nets in
the open country are not, as a rule, the result of misalliance in
aviaries, nor are the many cruelties which one daily witnesses in
the dealings of strong birds towards their weaker brethren.
I well remember the animal artist, T. W. Wood, speaking
with horror of the wanton brutality which he witnessed in the
case of a Peregrine Falcon, which amused itself for a considerable
time by swooping upon a flock of domestic pigeons, striking
down one after the other and leaving their torn and writhing
bodies to die miserably, not taking one of them for food but
merely destroying for sport: but this is no isolated instance, for
most birds of prey maim and mangle far more than they require
for their bodily needs.
Moreover, it is all very well to assert that, when confined
in aviaries, however spacious, birds are not actuated by the same
impulses as when free, but it would not only be very difficult,
but I believe quite impossible, to prove the assertion. On the
contrary we keep them in captivity in aviaries in order to study
their habits, which would be futile if those habits underwent an
entire change as soon as birds were enclosed.
As Mr. Momber says:--Evil is " the violation of the moral
sentiment," or, in other words, sin does not exist where there is
no law, and he tells 11s that wild animals are incapable of wrong-
doing. Perhaps he is right, who knows? If, however, as he
asserts, there is a conscience in the higher animals, does it not
seem presumption to assert that there is no perception of law and
order in such highly intelligent creatures as birds? Dogmatic
statements are not proof.
At this point of his argument Mr. Momber practically
</bodyText>

on the Moral and Mental Attributes in Birds. 67
drops morality and turns to mental qualifications and beauty as
proofs of the high respectability of birds. Had he read my first
paper " The Mind of a Bird " he might have saved himself the
trouble of expatiating upon these points. I am not aware that even
the wisdom of Solomon rendered him a pattern of morality, nor
has beauty always been inseparable from virtue, The fact is
that the moral sense in birds is very low ; and, however much we
may deplore that fact, it is one that cannot be disproved. On
the other hand the mental powers of birds are high, much higher
than those of many mammals, and it is because of this that we
find them so companionable. To argue, as Mr. Momber does,
that a bird's mental status and its beauty evidence its high moral
condition, and that all its vices are virtues because it is un-
conscious of sinning, is--well, a little more than I can admit, for
the following reasons :--
The mental attributes belong to the higher nature--the
soul of creation, whereas the immoral attributes are the uneradi-
cated remains of the animal nature--the body : and although it
might be expected that the highest type of mental perfection
would control the animal instincts, in birds such perfection has
not been attained.
That a bird has no conscience is pure assumption ; that,
when domesticated, it certainly either acquires or manifests one
is indisputable; as it is also, that in many respects, a bird's in-
telligence attains a far higher level when it is associated with
man than when it is free; but, on the other hand, its animal
nature becomes apparently lower, more depraved in some ways.
The so-called "domestic virtues" of birds are, I am sure,
nothing more than natural impulses due to a condition of the
blood recurring at certain seasons ; they are liable to be wholly
lost by a sudden change of temperature or by shock; hitherto
closely guarded young are deserted or tossed out of the nest, and
nidification commences afresh. Moreover in wild birds even the
"domestic virtues" are sometimes wanting in male birds, as
witness the case of the Blackbird which I recorded in " British
Birds with their Nests and Kggs," Vol. 1, p. 20, which watched
each morning until his wife had laid and then devoured her egg:
that this trick was not a unique instance seems probable, when
we remember how often it is noticed in captive birds.

Mr. Arthur Denman,
Affection in birds, as with beasts, is, at its inception,
nothing but cupboard-love or pure selfishness; though in time
it may cease to be so, and in the case of the domestic dog un-
doubtedly does: for this reason, if, for my sins, I were condemned
to keep some mammalian animal, I should certainly choose a
dog before all others, in spite of its boisterous and startling
behaviour; but to keep birds, in spite of their delinquencies, is a
pleasure: they are, as Mr. Momber admits, among the most
beautiful of the inhabitants of our planet, they produce among
them some of the sweetest music in nature, and many of them
have gradually acquired considerable artistic talent, but in what
way such gifts disprove their lack of moral sense I fail to see.

IN MEMORY OF " GEORGE "

It is not certain that even the cognoscenti fully know all
with regard to the several varieties of the beautiful bird generally
spoken of as the " Brazilian Hangnest," and, therefore, it would
ill befit a mere bird-lover to venture on a word as to the differ-
ences between Icterus ja??iacaii, braziliensis, vulgaris, and the rest.
All that the present writer can lay claim to is the privilege of
having been on terms of intimate friendship with a good many
Hangnests, and the honour of having enjoyed the completest
confidence of the prince of all their race,--" George."
Of him first. He (or was he, all the time, she ?) was given
by Mrs. Price to the Zoo. in 1906, and was described as " Bra-
zilian Hangnest" (Icterus jamacaii). Bet it here be mentioned
and noted that he had blue ceres to his eyes.
It was early in 1907 that he and I became known to each
other. At that time he would perch on the finger of any reason-
ably quiet visitor who would thrust his through the wires, and
would pipe his call
as cheerily for one
as for any. From

acquaintance "George" and I became fast friends, and it
was from that moment that I took to paying daily visits to the
Western Aviary. After a very few of these, he would allow me
{and very likely it is that he would allow anyone else who had
tried) to stroke him on the head and the back, to place my hand
right over him, to take him up and to put him bodily into the
pocket of my coat or my trowsers, or into the breast of my coat,
from whence he would put out his head and sing. He would
then suiter himself to be turned over on to his back and to be
placed on the top of my hat, where he would lie perfectly still,
or on to the palm of my hand, where he would deftly catch a
mealworm dropped from a distance of two or three feet.
He would catch a piece ol tissue-paper, rolled up into a
ball, unerringly, and would fly off and play with this until invited
down again, when he would at once return to the hand of the
visitor.
Mist, the then under-keeper, was devotedly attached to
"George," and, whilst these tricks were in progress, would never
omit to murmur in tones of intense admiration "Ain't he got a
nerve, Sir?" adding, in those of deepest affection, "You bounder,
George ! "
In December 1908 "George" fell ill. I was allowed to
carry him down in the breast of my coat to the Small Bird House,
where Sutton carefully tended him, but he died in a week from
pneumonia. His remains were given to me, a kindness which
was greatly appreciated, and they are before me as I write,
stuffed in his most eccentric attitude--011 his back, with a meal-
worm in his mouth. Under him is the inscription : " I11 maim
mea sic jacebat et cantabat. Obiit 15 Dec., 1908." Many, other
than I, mourned " George."
Having thus had it revealed to me how charming was the
nature of these birds, I bought one for myself. "Jim " was quite
untamed and timid when I got him, but so docile was he that, in
ten days, he would come on to my hand for his mealworm. I11
less than a month he would fly down from any part of the room
and settle on my hand or 011 my head, or on that of a bald-headed
friend of mine, and was perfectly " at home." He would even
come under an up-lifted sheet of my bed and hop about on my

legs. One day, the window having been left open whilst he was
having his bath, he flew out from the thiid floor, and was heard
singing two hours later from the roof of a house thiee doois off,
and 80 or 90 feet from the ground. O11 his cage being shown to
him through the trap-door he flew down into the house and on
to an out-stretched finger!
For " Jim " I got a companion--not a stable companion,
for these i?itei&apos; sc are pugnacious and jealotis biids, puffing them-
selves out and croaking and swearing at each other in a most
violent and ridiculous way whenever brought near to each other.
My second venture " Tim '' was the most audacious rascal
of a bird that I had hitherto met with, and had many of the
traits of a Magpie. Perfectly wild when he first came, it was
only about ten days before he, too, became finger-tame; and
from that time he educated himself. He would get on to my
dressing-table, fly up on to my hand when I was shaving, return
to the table and commence an inspection of every single article
thereon, chucking the studs on to the floor, opening every match-
box and pulling out one or more of the matches, piising open
envelopes and trying to withdraw the contents, and so on.
He used to creep up a newspaper rolled up and held at an
angle of 45 0 , emerging at the top with a croak to fly on to my
head and give me a friendly peck. This most amusing and in-
teresting bird was left in a draught and died in April 1908. His
body is in the Natural History Museum, described as Icteius
vulgaris , and he had blue about the eyes. O11 the day of " Tim's ^
death "Jim" broke out into song for the first time, and con-
tinued to sing lustily until he moulted in the autumn.
In May 1909, another Hangnest was given to me. " Dan "
had lived in Madeira, where his owner had allowed him to fly
loose all day, and he had been in the habit of returning to his
cage at night. But beyond that he would come and take a meal-
worm from one's hand when in his cage, he was not tame when
he came to me. He is a most engaging bird and, 011 the approach
of his friends,he throws his head back and flutters his wings and
croons and chirrups in a manner most clearly indicating pleasure.
It sounds hardly credible, but it is a fact, that he will almost
always retire into his cage before voiding ! He is on the high

road to becoming as tame as "George,' and already is as tame
as was my "Jim." That word has to be written, for poor "Jim "
died this summer whilst spending his holidays at the Zoo.
Neither "Jim" nor " Dan " had any blue about their eyes.
I have at the present moment yet another Hangnest, " Pan "
--so called by my daughter because he pipes--who promises to
be as good company as the others have proved themselves to be.
It is impossible to imagine any more delightful cage-birds
than Hangnests. They have a strong sense of humour and a
delicious spice of devilment in their nature. " Dan " and I play
every morning at "catch " and " touch," and he evidently enjoys
doing so.
But two faults they have, and two only. They will peck
with extraordinary rapidity and accuracy of aim at one place on
a finger, indeed so vigorously as to draw blood; and, secondly,
they have a tendency to fly at the eyes of those with whom they
are not acquainted. But when once they have learnt to recognise
their own family circle, which they do in a very few days, the
vigour of their peck abates and they never attempt to fly at eyes.
O11 one occasion a foreign lady, who had rather a pale
complexion, came into the Western Aviary with me to see
"George." He flew straight at her face, and it was only her veil
which protected her from some injury. Her nerves were a little
shaken and, wishing to make her forget the incident, I said--
" I am so very sorry, but I think that the cause must have been
your being in white. He saw only your lips and took them for
cherries." For some reason or another this speech seemed to
salve the lady's feelings enormously.
I11 the Royal Natural History it is stated that whilst some
of these birds construct pendent, others build cup-shaped, nests.
For the latter statement I can vouch, for towards the end of 1907
one resembling " George," blue cere and all, built a nest in the
Western Aviary, which was made of leaves and long pieces of
string, and omnibus tickets! But I must not encroach 011 the
province of those from whom we learn.
Let me just say a few words as to diet. All my birds have
thriven well on a mixture of boiled potato, hard-boiled rice,
carrot, crushed sweet biscuit, a few soaked currants, a little hard-

boiled egg - , some ripe banana, and a grape oi two. It is a good
thing to give them a few small strips of raw meat every other day
and six or eight mealworms will not hurt them. They want and
enjoy a bath every day, and are very much the better for lots of
flvinexercise. Half an orange fixed on a nail on their best
perch is a sine qua ?iou to their health.
They appear to be peculiarly sensitive to draughts, but can
stand any amount of still fresh air.
Their notes are as melodious as those of a flute, and are
always rhythmical, tuneful, and, in some cases, amusing. Some
think that they can be taught to imitate calls. My experience
leads me to doubt this.
To my mind their black heads, shirt-fronts, tails and wings,
contrasting with the delicate yellow of tlieii bieasts and bodies
(a yellow that is a bright orange after the moult, but gradually
fades into the most lovely canary tint), form a combination which
is hard to beat, though they would undoubtedly be still more
beautiful but for the presence of a little white on their wings.
At the risk of increasing their price I must say that, as
amusing, lovely, companionable, and interesting birds, they are
well worth the 30/- to 50/ -, which is their usual price.

Egyptian Birds, by Chari.es Whymper. Published by Adam and
Chari.ES BI.ACK, Soho Square, London. Ordinary Edition 20/- net;
Edition de Luxe (Limited) 42/- net.
This beautiful book will prove of great interest and
assistance to bird-loving visitors to that wonderful land, the tomb
of an ancient civilization and the gate of the glorious East, which
is now so popular as a winter resort. Although the birds of Egypt
are largely migrants from the North, and so familiar to 11s already,
many are such as are not often to be seen wild here, and a few are
characteristic tropical species, such as the Pied Kingfisher and
Green Bee-eater, both figured in this book, which has no less
than fifty-one full-page illustrations, all in colour. Many of
these are very beautiful, such as that of Cream-coloured Coursers
in the desert, and that of Buff-backed Egrets--the "Sacred Ibis'&quot;

of the mendacious dragoman--in attendance on buffaloes. The
plate of flying birds is also happily conceived and useful. The
text is chatty and interesting, and deals with a good represen-
tative selection of Egyptian birds, while a full list of the bird-
fauna is given at the end of the volume.
So charming a book is likely to run into several editions,
so it is as well to point out a few points which need revision.
The plate of the Pale Crag Swallow has nothing referring to it in
the narrative, though the bird is mentioned in the list ; the bird
which builds the edible nest, of saliva, incidentally alluded to in
the text dealing with Swallows (p. 64) is a Swift, not a Swallow
at all; the Sacred Ibis is not, as anyone can see at our Zoo. here,
"a moody sort of bird," but quite lively for a large wader ; and
the Woodcock seems to be literally "dragged in by the ears," for
it is not mentioned as at all a characteristic bird, while some
attention is devoted to the unusually forward position of its ear-
orifice, which Mr. Whymper seems to think he was the first to
discover, though as a matter of fact this peculiar situation was
known to, and figured by, Nitzsch, about three-quarters of a
century ago.
These are, however, but small points, and the book can be
cordially recommended both to those travellers for whose use it
is primarily intended, and to those home-naturalists who like to
be able to acquaint themselves with the birds of other lands in
freedom, and incidentally to get some idea of the brightness of
nature under an Eastern sun. F. F.

WiTHERBY &amp; Co., 326, High Holborn. Price 2/6 nett.
Bv the act of a fairv Tommv is changed into various
beasts and birds, and his adventures in the company of his
companion, the fairy, similarly disguised, are recounted in this
little book, which may be described as a sequel to ' The Change-
ling,' by the same author. Like its predecessor it is written
essentially for children, and the stories are told in simple well-
chosen language, and illustrated by several coloured plates and
many line figures in the text, the work of the author himself
and of Mr. Carruthers Gould. Let it not be supposed that the

tales are fanciful or overdrawn. Far from it. The purpose of
the author is to give a true account of what happens ill nature ;
and the first chapter tells of the things To in my saw, under the
guise of a cock pheasant, in the woods at night; and the second,
his experiences on the following day during a covert shoot.
Later on he goes to the Arctic Regions as a Glaucous Gull and
falls in with polar bears and walruses ; and, finally, as a Starling
he travels back in time and makes acquaintance with his remote
ancestor, the Archaopteryx . On closing the book we cannot
repress a feeling of regret that the educational advantages it
represents were not in vogue some five-and-thirty years ago
when we were children ourselves.
We cordially recommend " Tommy's Adventures " as a
Christmas gift for 'kiddies' with a taste for natural history.

The Waterfowl of India and Asia, by Frank Finn, B.A., F.Z.S.,
M.B.O.U. Thacker &amp; "Spink, Calcutta, 1909. Price, Rs. 2-8.
I11 an unpretentious little paper-bound volume of 117
pages, suitable by its pocket-size for a field vade mecum , Mr. Finn
has embodied an account of the Swans, Geese and Ducks of Asia,
which will be a most useful guide to the correct identification of
the species of the Anatidce, not only for sportsmen and naturalists
in India, for whose benefit it was originally compiled, but also
for those of Kurope, seeing that so many of the birds described
are widely distributed in the northern hemisphere of the old
world.
The opening chapter contains a section briefly telling the
beginner how to distinguish the Duck family from other water-
fowl like Gulls, Petrels, Grebes, Cormorants, and their allies,
with which they might possibly be confused. Flamingoes also
are contrasted with them. We should like, however, to have seen
these birds, which are surely nothing but specialized Anatidce ,
included in the volume. That, however, is an unimportant
detail. Another section gives the characters of the four sub-
families represented respectively by the Swans, Geese, Mer-
gansers and true Ducks, into which the family is divided.
The following chapters deal with the species, their salient
characters, habits and geographical ranges; and the book closes

with two appendices, the first being a key to the rapid identifi-
cation of the birds described in the preceding chapters, and the
second being a useful tabulation of the colour of male birds in
full plumage. For a future edition of this excellent little hand-
book we should like to suggest as an improvement the insertion
of the name of the original describe!&apos; of the species. The method
of quoting the species suggests that Blanford and Salvadori were
the first to describe them all. The work is illustrated by eleven
plates showing profile views of the heads of the males of twenty-
three species. In connection with these, we feel sure Mr.
Gronvold will not regard as an unkind reflection upon his past
efforts our sincere congratulations to him for his great improve-
ment as an ornithological artist. R- I. P-
The Home-Life of a Goeden Eagt.E. Photographed and described by
H. B. Macpherson. Witherby &amp; Co., 326, High Holborn, London,
1909; 2/6 nett.
The title of this tastefully issued volume of 45 pages and
32 mounted photographs, tells in a measure its own tale; but the
account itself must be read ere it is possible to form any just
appreciation of the pluck and perseverance of the author in
overcoming the hardships involved in watching and recording
the doings in an eagle's eyrie ; waiting many a long hour, hidden
with his camera under an artificial shelter of stones and heather
upon a narrow ledge of rock, beneath which the hillside dropt
two hundred feet sheer into the brawling stream beneath.
It tells how at first dame Nature retards the growth of
strength in the legs of the eaglets lest inexperience lead them to
topple over the edge of the nest into the abyss below ; how the
nest is kept clean by the removal of soiled pieces of branch and
heather; how the hen bird, aided sometimes by her mate, brings
the daily rations of grouse, hare and rabbit to her offspring;
how, as the time for flight draws near, the young bird, as if
conscious of his growing strength, impatiently flaps his wings
aud starts to wander about the ledges and boulders in the vicinity
of the nest, always, however, returning at nightfall or when
rough weather overtakes him. And, finally, it tells how after a
sojourn of eleven weeks in the eyrie, the young bird, stimulated

by the repeated calls of his mother, at length summons courage
to launch himself into space to start a new phase of his career,
for ever beyond the camera's reach. All this, and much more,
was seen and photographed by Mr. Macplierson in the summer
of this year of grace 1909, under climatic conditions which may
be left to the imagination of those who have spent the last nine
months in Great Britain. The rest of the young Eagle's story
is left to conjecture. " If we are fortunate we may even watch
his attempts to catch a hare, and see how the Red Grouse scorn
his clumsy efforts to take them on the wing. We may even
witness the last and strangest scene in the drama of an Eagle's
life, when the devoted parents, who for five long months have
tended their offspring with loving care, turn on him as on a foe
and drive him forth into the outer world." We quote this con-
cluding paragraph to give an idea of the author's stimulating
style, and to attest the naturalist's enthusiasm and love of his
subject which pervade every page of the story. R. I. P.
British Birds for Cages, Aviaries and Exhibition, bv Sumner W.
Bircheey, N.B.B. &amp; M.C., L.P.O.S., &amp;c. Two Vols. 234 pp. and
many plates. Sherratt &amp; Hughes, London, 1909. 25s. net.
Books on British Birds have of late years flooded the
market, but the present one by Mr. Sumner W. Birchley, although
having a familiar title, has struck out on a new line and deals
with the caging and exhibition of those species which are more
or less adaptable to cage life.
The scheme of the book closely follows that of Bechstein's
Cage Birds and the information under each species is divided in
headings dealing with Description of Plumage, Habitation, Nest,
Eggs, Countryside Notes, Catching, Meteing Off and Steadying,
Feeding, Hand-rearing and Exhibition, and gives under each
heading clear and definite instructions.
The author is evidently a practical man who knows his
subject; he has had to fall back for his information on no outside
authority, and his experience is practical, serviceable and to the
point.
As regards the ethics of caging and exhibiting British
Birds different opinions are held, and the Avicultural Society as
a body does not set itself up as a "show" Club. I11 the writer's

opinion wild birds are not suitable subjects for competitive
exhibitions ; the classification is bound to be unsatisfactory and
any reliable system of judging impossible, while the continuous
bustle and travelling must involve a certain amount of cruelty.
On the other hand, the sight of our native birds alive and
in first-rate trim, as show specimens have to be, cannot fail to
stimulate an interest for the natural inhabitants of our country-
side and that feeling and love for Nature which should by all
means be fostered.
The keeping of birds and animals in confinement is
common to all races of mankind but the lowest, and will never
die out ; lienee the value of a book whose information is sound
as in the present case--for it cannot fail to alleviate the inevitable
cruelty which must arise when an animal is first caged. This
cruelty is reduced to a minimum in skilled hands, and the
subsequent release from enemies and abundance of food more
than compensate the captive for his loss of freedom, while he at
the same time gives abundance of pleasure to his owner. Un-
fortunately there are many who, with the best intentions in the
world, are woefully ignorant of the needs of their captives; for
such as these, this book, the only one of its kind, will prove in-
valuable, and if they follow its instructions not only will their pets
live in health and happiness, but they themselves will derive a
greatly increased satisfaction in watching the many little ways
and antics which are only shown by birds in the pink of health
and condition.
The book is further completed by chapters dealing with
Cages and Aviaries, Moult, Ailments, etc., so that it forms a
complete vcide viecum to the beginner while containing many
hints of use to older hands. It is illustrated by numerous full-
page black and white plates, some of which, however, leave much
to be desired. J. U. B.

understand, very difficult to catch as they very seldom leave thick cover, hut
sooner or later no doubt I shall obtain some.
vSo far, I have not been able to find anyone in England who has kept
Hazel-hens, and it seems to me a pity that such an interesting game-bird
of Northern Europe should be neglected, if indeed it is practical to keep
them in health in captivity.
Baron Klinckowstrom, of Stafsund, who has kindly made enquiries
of the Director of the Zoo. at Stockholm, informs me that the Director
says: "The food to begin with should consist of berries ( Myrtillus nigra,
Vaccinium vitis-idea, Oxy coccus palustris, &amp;c.) fresh or preserved; white
bread soaked in water, peas also softened in water, birch buds, and so on."
All this is doubtless correct in theory, but difficult to carry out in
practice--hence my request for the benefit of any fellow-members' ex-
perience.
If Hazel-hens will take readily to grain or seeds as their main food
(as Willow Grouse, for instance, do) they should not be difficult to keep.
If, on the other hand, they are capricious and difficult to get to take grain
or seeds (as Rock Ptarmigan are at first) then niv attempt to keep them in
captivity may not be successful, as, under my present conditions, I cannot
ensure a constant supply of berries and birch buds.

Sir, --They say that a dog should have his due, so that perhaps as my
trumpeter is either defunct or not forthcoming, I may be pardoned if I
remind you that the original painting of my pair of Abyssinian Love-Birds,
a coloured plate of which forms the frontispiece for the November Part of
this Magazine, was done by myself. The late Editor wrote to me, to Italy,
at the time, saying that he liked the pose of the birds so much that he
should have my coloured sketch of them copied .
This sketch I did from life, the male was posted at the extremity of a
dead bough, and the female had just come out of the nesting-box towards
her mate.
The only addition to my original sketch is the palm tree in the
background. Hubert D. Asteey.

For some two or three years a male Australian Crimson
Finch had paired off with a female Star Finch, in my aviary in
Aal\ r , and although they had built nests on several occasions and
iven laid eggs (at least she had), nothing had come of it.
In 1908, I left Italy in May, and did not return until
February 1909, when I found the Lake of Como much the same
s Dr. Cook must have found the North Pole. Such frosts and
ontinuous snow had not been known within the memory of
|nan.
Arriving in a blizzard, liiv first question of my Italian
nan-servant was--"How are the poor birds in this awful
leather? "
He sadly shook his head, but answer came there none !
Please," I said, " put me out of my agony."
" Eleven were picked up this morning, Signore, in the
viary."
A tea-tray was produced, which for the moment was acting
3 a bier. Some African Singing Finches were there, and some
arson Finches. I at once saw the corpse of the male Australian
rimson Finch, who had wintered not once nor twice in an
nheated avian&apos;&apos;, and beside him lay his Star Finch spouse, and
eyond her lay, all in a row, five other little birds, new to me,
it I discerned their identity in a moment.
They were full-grown, having been hatched in thesummer
1908, in my absence. Father, mother, and five grown-up

So On the Nesting of the Bahama Amazon,
children, all gone in one night! One of them was hardly to be
distinguished from a pure-bred Star Finch ; a second was de-
cidedly of that species, but not quite so pure, and the other three
favoured the father both in colouring and shape: and very
handsome they were.
An interesting family. They must have been roosting in
the open all together, and were beaten down by the snow which
fell constantly and thickly all through the night.

Chrysotis bahamensis.
By J. Lewis Bonhote.
In the Avicultural Magazine , Ser. 2, Vol. II., p. 239 (1904),
I wrote a short article on some parrots of this species, which I
had brought back with me from the Bahamas.
During the intervening years they have inhabited an out-
door aviary with a slightly warmed inner compartment into
which they could retire and escape the worst of the weathei.
Under these conditions they have lived for several years in peace,
happiness, and apparently in the best of health.
In 1905, when I moved to my present home, I separated
them into pairs, placing the pairs in adjoining aviaries, and
hoping by that means to induce them to breed, but without
result. . . .
About July 1908, however, two birds 111 different aviaries
were observed to be continually feeding each other through the
wires, and shortly afterwards the male had eaten his way through
to join his chosen mate, while the remaining occupant was given
a rather bad time. Needless to say, matters were soon readjusted,
but I waited for results in vain.
During last winter the hen nearly died from a very bad
cold, but luckily she recovered, and by early spring was again
fit and well. This year, however, they showed no signs oi pair-
ing and I had given up hope, till on the 4th of June I missed the
hen. She was nowhere to be seen, so hoping for the best I kept
a close watch, and 011 the following day I saw her feeding and
the cock standing guard by the nest box.

On the Nesting of the Giant Whydah. 8r
I now guessed that my hopes were to be realized, in part at
any rate, so choosing a suitable opportunity, when they were
both feeding, I peeped into the box and found two white e^o-s
very similar in shape and texture to pigeon's eggs. They were
warm, but apparently clear; however, I left them and tried to
find some reference to the period of incubation, but in vain.
After much search I found that Cockatoos are said to take twenty-
three days, and Parrakeets from nineteen to twenty-one, but
of the true parrots there was nothing recorded. The lien sat
steadily, only coming oft to feed in the morning and evening
and evidently carried on the whole of the incubation duties,
while the cock sat outside in proximity to the nest. On the
23id day I ventured to take another peep, and found she had laid
another egg, which was fertile and ' hard set.' Again I left them ;
after ten days she gave up sitting, and a look in the nest showed
that the young one had hatched--and died.
After waiting all these years it 7 vas a disappointment, and
all the more aggravating as I had been able to establish 110 new
information regarding the period of incubation or nesting habits.
One can only hope for better luck another season, but meanwhile
I write these notes, as it is, I believe, a record for an Amazon
Par rot to have successfully hatched in captivity.
THE NESTING OF THE GIANT WHYDAH.
Chera frocne.
By W. E. Teschemaker, B.A.
I have always had a hankering to breed the Giant
Whydah--just one of those inexplicable impulses that involve
the wasting of much valuable time which might have been
employed in doing something useful.
This hankering dates from the day when I first turned out
a male Chera procne in an out-door aviary. As he sailed majesti-
cally round and round, his sable train streaming in the wind, he
seemed a very king amongst birds. I have not the least idea
what the native name of this species, " Sakabulo ," means, but it
seems to me to convey the idea of some dusky potentate of the
"Dark Continent" and from that day to this I have called all

Mr. W. E. Teschemaker,
my male Whydahs " Sakabulo." Sakabulo the First is still in my
possession and will follow me round the aviary like a pet kitten.
Now the first difficulty in the matter of breeding the Giant
Whydah was to obtain a hen. Several were sent to me by various
dealers who were prepared to make an affidavit that they were
hens, but " Sakabulo" would not tolerate them for an instant--in
fact he fairly wiped the floor with each and all of them. So passed
the summer of 1907.
Early in the following year I saw an advertisement offering
a private consignment of this species. 1 his sounded much moie
hopeful and I had one sent on approval. Alas, it was simply
another male out of colour. I wrote again to the importer,
asking if he could not find something more like a hen. He did,
and at last I was the proud owner of a genuine hen Chera procne.
Let me here say that, having once seen a hen, you can never
again fail to recognize one. She is only two-thirds the size of a
male and is entirely brown with black striations on the back.
A male, so far as my experience goes, no matter in what state of
plumage he may be, is always black on the inside of the wing
and has some yellow feathers on the "shoulder," and, as I shall
subsequently show, he acquires these characteristics at the eaih
age of ten weeks.
During the fine warm summer of 1908 I had, therefore, a
genuine pair of this species in a fairly large aviary with some
cover in the form of bushes and coarse grass growing in tufts.
We got a little nearer our goal this season because we had
several good nests constructed by the female--one in a bush and
two in the grass--but I am not sure that any eggs were laid. We
also had a very interesting nest constructed by the male alone 111
an Euonymus about three feet from the ground. He built it in
two days, and I watched him at work and can testify that he had
110 assistance whatever from the female. It was as round as a
cricket ball, firmly woven but not very cleverly finished off round
the entrance. This achievement caused me to ask myself
whether the male of this species is really such a polygamist as
he is popularly assumed to be. We shall have something more
to say on this subject later on.
I commenced the season of 1909 by building a new aviary,
</bodyText>

or perhaps I should say that I ought to have commenced the
season in this way. As a matter of fact it was not begun until
the middle of April and not finished until the middle of June.
It has always amused me very much to see what a shock
my aviaries have been to various members who have been kind
enough to come and look over them. One avicultural expert
came here with two cameras and several note-books : I think he
expected something after the style of the Western Aviary at the
Zoo. He tried to be merciful in the account he wrote of them
but he could not resist one scathing remark--" there are no
service-passages." I am afraid my new aviary has proved even
a greater shock than the old ones, so I will not harrow our
members' feelings by saying anything about the design of it.
Two of our lady members inspected it the other day, and timidly
asked " where is the shelter?" When I had to admit that the
only shelter was the 18 inch square zinc screen over the food-tins
I could see that their kind hearts ached for my poor birds. I11
constructing the new aviary we kept a corner for the Whydahs.
I said to myself that the Whydahs are marsh-birds and that we
must have a marsh. That marsh took a lot of making. First we
built a tank 8 ft. square and 1 ft. deep. Then we went three miles
out into the country and dug up reeds and rushes and tussocks
of a kind of pampas-grass. At the end of June we introduced
" Sakabulo " and his bride to the new aviary. This was not my old
friend " Sakabulo I." but a younger bird that had just come into
colour. One of the first things the " Sakabtilos " inspected w T as
the marsh and they seemed to be much impressed by it. True,
it was not extensive but they evidently came to the conclusion
that it was a genuine marsh, or at all events the nearest thing to
a marsh that they had seen since they had left the Dark Continent.
After a few days however, their interest in the marsh seemed
to wane : Sakabulo was generally to be seen sitting on the topmost
bough of a tall Cupressus, and the female began to construct a
nest in an Austrian pine--of all places. But one evening, just as
it was getting dusk, I happened to look out of a window which
commanded a view of the aviary and I saw something that
interested me. The female Whydah was flying round and round
the enclosure evidently 011 the look out for spies and, having

Mr. W. E. Teschemakkk,
satisfied herself on this point, she dropped quietly into the
marsh. Then "Sakabulo" glided in a stealthy manner down
from his perch and slipped as silently as a shadow into the rushes
close to her. Next morning I walked round and round the
marsh, inspecting it closely. It seemed much as usual except
lust one place, where the sedge seemed to have been drawn
together in a kind of knot. I went down on hands and knees
and under that knot was a perfect nest of the Giant Whydah and
in it a single large egg. It was the 19th of July. There is an
old Devonshire saying--" they be where they bain&apos;t,&quot; which, being
interpreted, means " do not look for them where you would
expect to find them "--and this might well stand as the family
motto of Cher a procne.
For the next few days I wanted no better occupation than
that of watching the Whydahs. From dawn till dusk " Sakabulo "
was ceaselessly active. At one moment he was to be seen run-
ning with extraordinary rapidity amongst the long grass and
rank weeds, looking like an unusually lithe and dusky Polecat.
The next he would be sailing round and round the aviary in
wide circles like some strange model aeroplane. Continually with
hawk-like swoops he would dash at some unoffending neighbour,
who had come too near the marsh, pursuing the victim with
marvellous power of wing through all the twists and turns of the
chase. The popular fallacy that a male Giant Whydah in breed-
ing plumage cannot fly in a high wind is an amusing one. On
the 10th July the Exeter Cage-Bird Society, to the number of
twenty-eight, came to have a look at my birds. On the afternoon
of their visit it was blowing a gale of wind, yet they all remarked
on the powerful flight of " Sakabulo." The suggestion that the
bird cannot fly in heavy rain is equally fictitious: I will under-
take to say that the heaviest rain that ever fell in this country
could not possibly wet the plumage of a Giant Whydah in good
condition. The love-song and dance of this species once seen
can never be forgotten, the male posing erect and on tip-toe
before the female, the long feathers of the neck erected as a
hood, and emitting that weird long-drawn note which I can
only describe as a combination of hissing and spluttering.
It is singular that when an adult male is grasped in the

hand it generally utters this strange sound, showing that the
latter is also minatory. The female and the young, however, do
not avail themselves of this means of defence though, one would
think, they require it more. One may well ask of what use can
it be to the male. We have the answer to this, I think, in the
habit of the male (alluded to above) of roosting on the ground
amongst rushes and close to the nest. It seems a reasonable
supposition that he thereby protects himself (and possibly the
female also) from grazing and predatory animals. The reason
that the female and the young do not also produce the note is
probably simply that they cannot do so or possibly that, being
protectively coloured, they find quiescence pays best. I11 any
case the fact that the most characteristic note of the love-song is
used also as a means of defence, is worth noting because it is
possibly unique. Another habit of the male which I will notice
is that of hovering over the nest, the wings drawn up almost
vertically above the back like the Montagu Harrier or the Short-
eared Owl, the tail dropped below the body in sickle shape and
so extended as to show every feather, with frequent utterance of
the call-note, " chit-chit ." At such times we have the display of
the Giant Whydah at its very best, the bird, as it floats lightly on
outstretched pinions, looking like nothing so much as one of
these weird representations of oriental art which we see on
Japanese screens. Some time since I spent a delightful after-
noon in the aviary of our member, Mr. Reginald Phillipps, who
told me that he thought that this display of the tail was effected
by the stiff upper tail-coverts depressing the long rectrices. I
have examined two males lately with a view to confirming the
observation, but I have not been able to detect any separate
muscular action of the upper tail-coverts ; also I cannot help
thinking that, if the tail-coverts pressed the upper rectrices
forward and the wind pressed the lower rectrices backwards,
the tendency would be for the tail to be compressed into one
mass, whereas actually each individual feather stands out dis-
tinctly. Nevertheless Mr. Phillipps' opinion is, as I need hardly
say, a much better one than mine. The twelve long feathers of
the train are implanted in V shape, six 011 each side, the longest
(and these sometimes exceed 17 inches in length) being the next
to the topmost pair.

Mr. W. E. Teschemaker,
We will now consider the nesting habits of the female.
The first point that impressed itself on my notice was that she
continued assiduously adding to the nest after the first egg was
laid, up to, and even after, the time that incubation commenced.
I could not quite make out what she was doing until I made
another careful examination of the nest. When first I saw it
(19th July) it was so constructed that the entrance hole looked
right into the centre of the cup of the nest, and the cavity was
exceedingly small. She now commenced to force out one wall of
the nest,working very fine grass into the interstices. The result
of this was that she so altered the position of the cup in relation
to the entrance hole that it was no longer possible to look directly
into the nest. She never alighted directly at the entrance but
approached it by a well-defined path through the long grass.
After a few days she drew the grass together over this path, thus
forming a tunnel.
The second egg was laid on the 20th ; the third on the
21st, and the fourth, and last, on the 22nd. She commenced to
sit on that day, and was so unsteady for several days that the
near approach of anyone to the aviary was sufficient to make her
spring from the nest in wild alarm. She came off about every
two hours to feed, and was never fed by the male. There is
never the least difficulty in ascertaining when a female of this
species commences to sit, for her tail is at once deflected to a
semi-circular shape by contact with the walls of the nest, as
also may be observed in the case ol the Long-tailed, or Masked,
Grassfinch when incubating.
O11 the 2nd August, at 10.10 a.m. I closed the screens, thus
making her a prisoner, but at 10.20 a.m. she was back on her
eggs. Most unfortunately I did not succeed in enclosing " Saka-
bulo " with her, which was the more annoying because I par-
ticularly wished to ascertain what part, if any, he would take in
rearing the young.
I am not quite sure of the period of incubation, because,
as I have said above, it was not possible to look directly into the
nest, but I can make an approximate guess from the behaviour
of " Sakabulo." O11 the 3rd August he was very excited, and
what particularly interested me was that he was continuously

searching for insects in the grass--a thing he had never done
before. I asked myself why he should do this if. as we are told,
the male Giant Whydah takes no interest in his progeny.
I obtained my first sight of a young Whydah on the 9th,
on which day a little head covered with light grey down was
thrust forth from the entrance hole. On the 14th I saw two
young--queer little objects with very dark eyes. O11 this day
the female pulled away some of the nest material round the
entrance, apparently to give the young more air, for from the
5th to the 17th we had the only hot weather of this most in-
clement summer, the 9th being the hottest day experienced at
Teignmouth for many years, with a shade temperature of 83*.
I supplied plenty of insect food, and the female also foraged for
her family in the long grass. I watched '*Sakabulo" closely
through binoculars. He evidently took the greatest interest in
the course of events, perching close to the netting which separated
him from his family, and every now and again, after searching
for insects, he would go close up to the hen at the netting. My
impression is that he passed insects through the netting to the
female, although, owing to the length of the grass, I cannot state
this as a fact. Taken in conjunction, however, with the fact that
the male can build a nest and his general demeanour it leads me
to think that he assists in rearing the young and may even be
occasionally monogamous.
About this time our difficulties began. The first of our
troubles was the wasps which invaded the aviary in battalions
and carried off our insect food as fast as we supplied it. Then
the weather broke 011 the 17th, and thereafter we had nothing but
a succession of gales of wind and torrents of rain ; in fact, it
seemed impossible that any young birds should be reared in an
absolutely unsheltered aviary, exposed to the full fury of the
elements and with only a single parent to feed and brood them.
Success was solely due to the unfaltering devotion of the female:
the clever way in which she managed the young and took advan-
tage of any little assistance which we could render, without any
fuss or any sign of fear, was beyond all praise.
I examined the young closely 011 the 18th. There were
three of them, fine large birds with a somewhat uncanny appear-

Mr. W. E. Teschemakek,
ance, due to the fact that the down had disappeared from the
crown of the head, leaving a light patch over each eye. they all
gaped widely and at first appeared to be simply asking for food,
but, when they remained rigidly fixed in this position for several
minutes, glaring at me with their dark eyes, it dawned upon me
that this was a deliberate pose, and that they were trying to
frighten me. This caused me to ask myself whether the curious
o
marking of the palate of some young birds, which has generally
been explained as an aid to the parents in feeding, may not be
really a device for scaring off intruders. In the case of the
Bearded Tit for instance, the markings closely resemble teeth,
which is significant.
In the annals of every aviary (which is not a total failure)
there is one particular day in every year which is different from
all other days. It is the day when the young of the most in-
teresting nest of the year make their first appearance in public.
Last season we celebrated here the occasion of the first breeding
of a British Bunting : the year before of a Tanager. This year
my birds wanted to hold a "fiesta" for our young Blackcaps:
they said they were the first Warblers to be bred in an aviary,
but I had to explain to them that no one seemed to know whether
the Blackcap had been previously bred or not, and that it would
be better to make the young Whydahs the piece de resistance for
1909, because, for once in a way, we had beaten the Germans.
So on the 18th August we held wassail, for on that date the first
young Wliydah flew. I distributed mealworms all round with
lavish hand, and every bird had as many as he could carry.
The Laughing Thrushes laughed till they could laugh 110 more.
As for " Sakabulo " he went round and round the aviary like a
shooting star, bowling over one victim after another. O11 the
19th the two other young birds made their appearance and proved
to be both hens and almost exactly like their mother, a little
lighter in colour. The first youngster, however, was a male and
much more heavily striated on the back, while the disparity in
size was quite extraordinary. One of the females came to an
untimely end : it fell down a sounding hole, used for testing the
depth of water under the marsh, and was not discovered for some
days after its disappearance. O11 the 28th August I saw the young

On iotli Sept. I found the adult lieu sitting on two eggs in

Mip-shaped affair, loosely constructed of fine grass, not attached
II any way to the rushes that supported it, but fairly well hidden
inder a swathe of coarse grass (see photo.). The eggs were dull
greyish white, clouded with washy blue-grey and faint purplish
liaculations, especially around the larger end; dimensions
89 x .62. It is evident, therefore, that this species constructs at
east three different types of nest.
This paper has already attained much greater length than
iriginally intended, but it would perhaps not be complete witli-
&gt;ut a few general remarks on breeding the Viduince. This family
aas generally been considered by aviculturists to be difficult to
ireed, but I must say that various considerations have led me to
III exactly opposite conclusion. I11 the first place, it will be
loted that my young Whydahs, though they had everything
igainst them in the matter of weather, developed into strong,
lardy birds, as large as their parents. I11 the second place, one
&gt;f our members has this season successfully reared young from
&gt;oth the Pintailed and the Red-collared Whydah, and, inasmuch
is the first indication that breeding was going 011 was the actual
ippearance of the young, it is evident that the parents received
10 assistance from their owner. Thirdly, Herr Karl Neunzig
las very kindly informed me that 110 less than five species of
Vhydahs have been bred by German aviculturists, namely :

Certainly the Paradise Whydali and the Combassou do not, as :
rule, seem inclined to go to nest, but I am not aware that anyon
in this country has made a serious attempt to breed them. I a
all events have never given either species a fair trial, and yet I ha&amp;lt;
a nest of S. paradisea in 1907, and young are said to have beei
hatched in another aviary. I have not yet heard of complet
success in the case of the Combassou, but I have particulars of
very curious Hybrid, bred by an Exeter fancier, between th
Combassou and the Black-headed Mannikin. I think the abov
data will show that a considerable amount of success has alread
been obtained with the Viduinee , and, if only an effort wer
made to get some females of the rarer species imported, I expec
that in a few years' time medals will have been awarded for 1110s
of the remaining members of the group.

DARTFORD WARBLERS.
By Henry Scherren.
Most of 11s have, no doubt, already entered in the margii
of our favourite book 011 British Birds the fact that last year th
Hartford Warbler ( Sylvia midata ) was successfully kept by Mr
John Frostick, who recounted his experience in Canary and Cag
Bird Life of Oct. 1, 1909. Later in the same month I dealt wit]

the subject in that journal.
The story of the species in captivity can be carried a littl
further than was done by Mr. Allen Silver in our Novembe
number, where he described Mr. Frostick's birds in an admirabl
way. Having also had the opportunity of seeing them, I car
corroborate his account in all particulars.
My purpose is to supplement his excellent article b;
enumerating the few references to this species as a cage-bin
that I have been able to find, and to bridge as far as possible th

iterval between the historic birds of Montagu and those of
[r. Frostick.
We are able to fix the date at which Montagu kept his
irds by his coni muni cation to the Linnean Society in 1807
Trans . Finn. Soc., ix. 191). In the paper he referred to them
s having been taken "last year "--that is, in 1806, so that there
, an interval of 103 years to bridge over.
I may as well confess at once that to do this is beyond my
ower. It will, however, be possible to fill in a little at both
nds, and supply a kind of platform in the middle, whence other
orkers may carry on investigations either forward or backward.
This Warbler was not mentioned by Patrick Syme, whose
Treatise on British Song Birds " was published in 1823 ; but
here is a reference to it in Sweet's " British Warblers," which
ppeared in the same year. This passage was quoted by Mr.
Jlen Silver (p. 30), and need not be repeated.
Next in order of time came Rennie's edition of Montagu's
Ornithological Dictionary" (1831). It is there stated (p. 131)
iat Mr. Bennet--[this should be Bennett]--Vice-Secretary of
le Zoological Society, had recently a pair of nestling Dartford
Warblers from Wiinbledon Common. Now Bennett held office
0111 1831 to 1833. If he were already Vice-Secretary when he
ad the nestlings--and this appears to be so--he must have had
aem in 1831 ; so that we find Dartford Warblers kept as cage
irds just a quarter of a century after Montagu kept his.
I11 1833 Rennie founded a magazine, The Field Naturalist,
diicli had a very short existence. Only four numbers of the
scond volume were issued when it came to an abrupt end.
anong the contributors was Edward Blyth, the well-known
rnithologist, afterwards of the Calcutta Museum. O11 p. 317 of
iie volume for 1833 Blyth mentioned six or seven Furze Warblers,
s these birds were then often called, in the possession of Bennett,
nd referred to one having been limed while eating fruit in a
arden.
At that time they do not appear to have been rare as cage-
irds, for Blyth added : "The manners of the P&apos;urze Warbler in
onfinenient much resemble those of the Babillard [the Lesser
Vhitetliroat] ; it often darts about in the same active manner as

that bird, and has the same remarkable habit of throwing bad
the head."
We must now pass over fifteen or twenty years. I hav&amp;lt;
been informed by my friend Mr. Frederick Burton, the well
known naturalist of Wardour Street, that from 1848 to 1855 hi
father, the late Mr. H. Burton, used to get eggs from Hampstead
Highgate, and Finchley, and " sell them to the dealers by tin
dozen." Of course this was before the days of bird protection
On one point of importance my friend is positive. Hi:
father used also to get the live birds, which were disposed o
through the same channels. Now the inference I draw fron
these facts is, that the Dartford Warbler about the middle of las
centurv was in the trade as a cage-bird.
This middle point is what I referred to as the platform
whence one could work backward or forward--to Bennett's bird;
in one direction, and to those of Miss Florence Burn in the other
Before passing to these last mentioned, a word may be said abou
the well-known Smithers, of Churt, who must have taken hun
dreds of eggs in his time--in the sixties and seventies of tin
last century. Viewing his work in connection with the evideuct
afforded by Mr. Frederick Burton I find it hard to believe tliai
Smithers did not also take live birds, and draw the same
conclusion as in the former case.
Now we come to quite recent times. I11 Canary and Cao t
Bird Life of Oct. 15, 1909 , Miss Florence Burn claimed to have
kept Dartford Warblers, hand-reared by her, from June 1905 tc
August 1906 . I11 the number for Oct, 29, she explained that the
dates were given in error, and should have been 1S95 and 1896
respectively. Her story was completely confirmed by a lettei
from Mr. W. Thomson, published in the same journal on Nov. 5.
I have heard of one example that was sent last season to a
prominent aviculturist, who may if he likes contribute some
particulars. It is not my province to do so, nor did I make
enquiries as to details, being satisfied generally as to the truth of
the statement.
To recapitulate. Starting from Montagu's birds in 1S06,
we have those of Bennett in 1831 and 1833; evidence of live
birds being taken between 1S4S and 1S55 ; presumptive evidence

of their being taken in the sixties and the seventies ; Miss Burn's
birds in 1895, and Mr. Frostick's and another example in 1909.
There is one point of special interest in Mr. Frostick's
article in Canary and Cage Bird Life --the occurrence of the nest
in heather, and to him, I believe, is due the credit of being the
first to publish this observation. It was, however, already known
to Mr. Edward Hart, of the Museum, Christchurch, who con-
tributed a note 011 the subject to the Field of Oct. 23, 1909. The
choice of such a site by the species on the Continent is recorded
by Saunders and Seebohm.

ON TWO CURIOUS AUSTRALIAN SPECIES
OF ANATID^E.
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.913645625" page_id="58072465"  page_num="93" year="" vol="">
By Frank Finn.
The two birds which I wish to direct attention in these
notes are the Magpie Goose of Australia {Anseranas melanoleuc2is&apos;)
and the Musk-duck of the same country ( Biziura lobata ), of
which the former is still on view at the Zoological Gardens,
while the latter was until recently.
The Magpie Goose is remarkable for its peculiar form,
which is much more like that of a heavily-built Ibis than any
anatine bird, and the resemblance is strengthened by the fact
that its front toes are only webbed at the base, and that the
hind-toe, unlike what occurs in other A?iatida? i is well-developed
and rests on the ground throughout. Accordingly we find that
this bird perches more readily than any other member of the
family, its grip being more secure by reason of this development
of the hind-toe ; at the same time, according to all Australian
accounts, it seems to nest 011 the ground, contrary to what obtains
with almost all other Anatidw of a perching habit. No inform-
ation about the appearance and habits of the newly-hatched young
appears to be available, for no one seems to have sufficiently
appreciated the peculiarities of this strange bird to have tried
breeding it, although some time ago quite a number were on sale
at Mr. Hamlyn's establishment.
Our member, Mr. Blaauw, however, has long ago recorded
the very interesting fact that, according to his experience, the

Mr. Frank Finn,
Magpie Goose does not moult all its quills simultaneously as all
other Anaiidce appear to do, but gradually, like most birds, thus
always retaining the power of flight. My observations on the
bird, which has been for some years in the London Zoological
Gardens quite bear this out; in fact, it moults so gradually that
the process is not at all noticeable.
As far as I have seen, the species very seldom swims,
but it is not so reluctant to enter the water as the Cereopsis Goose
(&apos;Cercopsis novce-hollandice ), which I have only seen twice in the
water during the many years I have watched waterfowl at the
Zoo, and then, on both occasions, the bird was washing.
The Magpie Goose when swimming, sits high in the water
like a gull ; on land it walks with the slouch of a big wader, not
the waddle of a goose. When washing, it prefers not to go into
the water, but crouches at the margin of its little pond and
throws the water over itself. The operation always makes its
plumage wet--another striking difference from Anatidtz generally.
Its note is an insignificant cackle, not at all what one would
expect from a bird with a long windpipe which is carried under
the skin all along one side of the body, and then returns to
enter the chest again. This structure is only found in the male,
but I have never been able to detect how the voice of the two
sexes differs, if indeed it does so, as one would expect. Although
the sifting-apparatus of the bill is little developed, this bird
" bibbles " like an ordinary duck.
The Musk-duck differs from the normal ducks in a less
remarkable way than the Magpie Goose; while the latter seems
to represent a semi-wader--the sort of bird one would expect the
ancestor of all Ancttidce to have been--the Musk-duck shows an
exaggeration of the specialized diving-duck type. The feet are
very large, and the tail long and wiry, while the wings are
perhaps the smallest found in any flying bird. In point of fact
there has been quite a controversy in Australia as to whether
Musk-ducks could fly at all, since evidence was produced
showing that these birds were sometimes captured by hand when
making their way on foot from one watery haunt to another,
and that under such circumstances they positively refused to fly.
Ultimately it turned out that they did their flying at night,
like our dabchick.

on two Curious Australian Species of Anatidcz.
That the bird should attempt an overland passage on foot
is, however, sufficiently remarkable; its gait is very awkward,
and it seldom goes far at a time, often lying down to rest; at
least such was my experience of the specimen which recently
died at the Zoo : I have even seen this bird throw itself forward
in a prone position by a succession of jerks, as divers so often do.
In the ordinary way, however, the bird keeps the body semi-
erect when walking or standing, like a Cormorant, as is well
shown in Mr. Medland's photograph--this, by the way, was not
taken from the female specimen lately in the Zoological Gardens,
but from a male which was there years ago, a specimen I never
saw in life.
Being a full-grown male it displayed the curious wattle on
the chin in high development. In the female, this is so small
that I never saw it while the bird was alive, though on two
occasions she came up and took my finger in her bill. On
examining her freshly-made skin, however, I noticed it as a little
low ridge of skin growing from the centre of the bare area
between the branches of the lower jaw. In the male this wattle
forms a pouch, with an orifice under the tongue ; it would be
interesting to note if this is ever dilated, as the wattle of the
Cape Crowned Crane (Balearica chrysopelargits&apos;) is when that bird
is calling.
The female Musk-duck at the Zoo led a solitary and
apparently not very happy life; placed in the big flight aviary
opposite the Eastern Aviary, she was ignored by the other ducks
and worried by some of the waders. Now and then she took to
the water, swimming low, with the tail usually floating on the
surface, but at times raised above it like an ordinary duck's. She
lay about a good deal, and apparently subsisted on meat, as the
keeper told me she ate this, and I never saw her partake of
grain, grass or biscuit. On one or two occasions I saw her flutter
along the water in an attempt to fly, but she only succeeded in
driving herself ashore; possibly this species is, as Grebes appear
to be, incapable of rising directly into the air. I may mention
that she moulted all her quills at once, in the normal manner of
the family.

Canaries are, by our rules, outside the scope of this Mag-
azine, but I take it this only applies to their culture as fancy
birds, and that any scientific results obtained from them are at
least worthy of notice. I therefore make no apology for reprint-
ing the notice which has been sent of the paper mentioned below.
CANARY BREEDING.
From Biomelrika Vol. VII., Nos. i and 2. July and October, 1909. Five
plates (4 coloured), pp. 42. Price 5/- net. Cambridge University
Press, London and Edinburgh. 1909.
In this paper Dr. A. Rudolf Galloway gives an analysis of
the results he has obtained in 17 years breeding of a great variety
of types of canaries. He considers that diversity of type has
arisen from crosses between cinnamon sports and the wild green
bird, and illustrates this theory from his knowledge of cinnamons
and incomplete albinos in other forms of bird life. He criticises
the recent memoir of Davenport, and indicates the necessity for
a more exact use of fancier's terms. The extent to which inheri-
tance in canaries does or does not accord with Mendelian theories
is discussed at length. The paper is illustrated by four colour
plates and a number of engravings which it is hoped will assist
in giving definite value to the terms employed. The paper is,
probably, the most extensive study of canary inheritance pub-
lished up to date.

years ago laid in our Gardens here. The account is worth giving-
in full "The breeding of the Bald Eagle in captivity in the
Buffalo Zoological Gardens is, I believe, the first and only
record. Dr. F. A. Crandall, Jr., has kindly furnished the follow-
ing data. . . . ' The mother bird was caught in Georgian Bav,
Canada, in 1898. The father was brought from Alaska in 1903.
Both birds were between two and three years old when received.
" ' The female has had three mates, the first for two seasons
and one each for the last two years. She has laid four clutches
of eggs, the first two of which were not fertile. The eggs laid
when paired with the second male proved good, and they were
within one day of hatching when accidently destroyed by freezing.
"'The last mate she chose was the Alaskan bird above
described. Two eggs were laid, and on the third day incubation
began. They hatched just thirty-one days later on April 18th,
1909. The young eagles left the nest when sixty-five days old
and were then in general appearance larger than the hither.' "

Rollers, Kingfishers and Bee-eaters. It thus contains a large .
amount of matter dealing especially with groups of particular ,
interest to the aviculturist, and I strongly recommend it as a most
attractive work, dealing not only with nesting habits, but also
with other details in the life history of the biids concerned.
Particularly interesting is the account of the importation of a
Lyre-bird (Menura superba) to Europe, though this is not its first
appearance there, as supposed by the author, the species having
been more than once on view at the London Zoological Gardens.
It is given below in full :--
" From information and notes received from M. Leon Jaubei t,
of North Sydney, I have extracted the following" Hearing
from Mr. E. P. Ramsay, Curator of the Australian Museum,
Sydney, that a Mr. Rose, farmer of Webb's Creek, near Wiseman's
Ferrv, on the Hawkesbury River, had a pair of tame Lyre-biids,
I went up there on a shooting expedition, and called at his place
to see them. I found them running with the fowls and perfectly
tame. Mr. Rose informed me that he had several times taken
young birds from the nests, and after rearing them and letting
them have the run of the bush with the fowls, they all had
mated with wild birds and forsook the place. Phe pair of biids
then in his possession had been hatched from eggs taken from
the nests at the same time, and placed under a domestic iowl,
but he did not inform me of the length of period of incubation.
These birds were exceedingly tame, and would take cuids out of
the mouth of the farmer, or his daughter, or eat anything out oi
their hands. Finally I purchased the birds, and stayed there
four days shooting in and about the neighbourhood, and then
returned to Sydney with them. As I intended shortly leaving
with the Lyre Birds for France, I put an advertisement in the
Sydney Morning Herald , offering to purchase twenty thousand
live worms. These I succeeded in obtaining, and placed about
an equal number of each in twenty casks of good soil, and also
purchased one hundred-weight of curds, which was placed in the,
cooling chamber. On the 21st of April, 1885, I took the French
steamer ' Sydney,' and Captain Pellegrin, the commander, gave
me all possible help to succeed in my attempt to take the bird-
alive to France. I fed the birds regularly every day on about

two pounds of curds, for this they would fly up on to my
shoulders, and take it out of my mouth, and placed half a barrel
of fresh soil in their cage, from which they extracted the worms
as they required them. At that time the French steamers called
at Mauritius, Bourbon and the Seychelles, on their way to my
birthplace, Marseilles. Just at day-break on the morning prior
to our arrival at the latter place, the female died from the effects
of the great heat while passing through the Red Sea. The
male bird was landed in splendid condition, and remained for
about a month at the Acclimatization Society Gardens at Mar-
seilles. I then made arrangements with M. Milne Edwards.
Director of the Jardin des Plantes in Paris, presenting the bird
to that institution, where it was placed in a very large aviary. I
gave full instructions to the keeper there how to feed it and look
after it, and it thrived well, living for a period of five and a half
years, and where I saw it several times during my different trips
to Europe."
Of even greater interest to the average aviculturist is the
following note on the house-haunting habits of the lovely Aus-
tralian Crimson Finch :--
" Mr. G. A. Keartland writes me as follows :--I saw many
nests of Neochmia phaeto?i near the junction of the Fitzroy and
Margaret Rivers, North-western Australia. Tliev were all made
of very coarse grass strippings, some of which were so large that
the birds could scarcely carry them, but the interior was lined
with softer material. At all the habitations along the Fitzroy
River, these birds make their appearance just before the heavy
rains of January, and commence building at once, but as soon as
the young broods are reared they all clear out again. The Crim-
son Finch seems to delight in the company of man, and although
I found over thirty nests, they were all attached to dwelling
houses, under the eaves or on the rafters of the verandahs. At
the Police Camp eleven nests could be seen, two of them being
within twelve inches of each other. At Mr. Blyth's camp several
&amp;lt; nests were under the eaves of the bough shade, and the birds
hopped about the floor within three or four feet of those sitting at
the breakfast table. Although some birds were taken from the
nests and handled, they soon returned to their eggs when

ioo Reviews , Extracts , Notices , etc.
liberated. At Mr. E. J. Harris's store-room many nests were
seen on the wall-plates, and in one instance a pair of birds
entered at one of the corrugations of the roofing iron, flew across
the room, and built their nest in a coil of telegraph wire hanging
on the wall. I never saw a nest of this species in a bush or tree."
Other observers, however, find it in trees as well, but its nesting-
habits are evidently quite House-Sparrow-like.
A very interesting observation is that the Laughing Jack-
ass (. Dacelo gigas&apos;) is more subject to albinism than any other
Australian bird, and a detailed account is given of a semi-albino
female which lived for some years (to the great credit of Mr.
F. J. Parks, its protector), and was at last accidently killed by
eating strychnine-poisoned mice.
Another very interesting note concerns the Red-backed
Kingfisher, a bird very similar to the Sacred Kingfisher familiar
to visitors at the Zoo :--" The late Mr. K. H. Bennett sent me the
following interesting notes :--Under the verandah of the home-
stead on Yandembah Station, near Booligal, New South Wales, a
number of Fairy Martins' (. Lagenoplastes arid&apos;) nests were clustered
together. One day I observed a pair of the Red-backed King-
fisher (Todirhamphus fiyirhopygius) perched on one of the rustic
branches attached to a verandah post. Curious to know what
was the object of the Kingfishers in coming to such an unusual
place, I watched them and had not long to wait to ascertain the
cause of their visit. The eggs and young birds contained in the
Fairy Martins' nests were the attraction, and I was exceedingly
interested in the manner in which the birds extracted them.
One of the Kingfishers would fly up to a nest, and, clinging to its
rough sides, break off with its bill the neck of the structure,
piece by piece. When tired with the exertion, the other would
then take its place, and so on until the whole of the neck was
broken away, and the eggs or young birds were reached, which
were quickly withdrawn and devoured. This was continued for
some weeks, the Kingfishers coming every day for their meal."
It is indeed difficult to leave off quoting from this fascinating
work, the most interesting of its kind that has been published
since Hume's "Nests and Eggs of Indian Birds," and if the
subsequent numbers prove anything like the present it will be
quite unrivalled. F. F.

IOI
AN ESCAPED FLAMINGO.
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.998879256410256" page_id="58072475"  page_num="101" year="" vol="">
The stock of Flamingoes inhabiting the Three Island Pond at the
Zoological Gardens, were never in more perfect condition than they are at
the present time ; the six European specimens showing the beautiful pink
tinge on the plumage that is usually associated only with perfectly wild
specimens, and the solitary American bird being practically identical with
those so wonderfully depicted in Mr. Frank Chapman's most delightful
Camps and Cruises.
The " Authorities" having decided that it would be a pity to disfigure
these lovely birds by pinioning, they have been allowed to grow full wings,
and at this time of the year, with their newly grown flight feathers, they
seem often to be contemplating a flight.
A Flamingo is not able to rise straight up from the ground, but like
an aeroplane, must take a run with expanded pinions and gradually rise
into the air. For this reason there is not really so very much danger of
their departing; but they are not entirely unable to take flight, as the fol-
lowing will show.
On November 17th the water in the pond was drawn off for cleaning
and a gang of navvies appeared with brooms and shovels. This rather
scared the Flamingoes and one managed to clear the boundary fence, circled
round two or three times in the air and then throwing out its long neck
forward and its long legs aft, headed straight away to the south and vanished
out of sight. Nothing more was heard of it that day, but on the following
morning a report was brought in that the bird was walking in Regent's
Park. I at once summoned four keepers, and arming myself with a long
net set out in search of the truant. We soon discovered it walking in
stately fashion on the grass.
As we approached it became uneasy and hastened its steps, and before
we had approached forty yards it lextended its wings and commenced to
run. With slowly flapping pinions it soon got under way and gradually
rose from the ground, a wonderful object in the bright morning sunshine,
its jet black pinions contrasting beautifully with its pink plumage. With
neck and legs in a straight line it sailed away towards the lake and soon
became a mere speck in the distance. We saw it wheel to the left over the
lake and vanish from sight in the distant mist. We made in the direction
in which the bird had disappeared but did not have to go very far, for again
our bird appeared heading directly for us and gradually approaching the
ground ; down it came gently to earth and sank upon its breast with
expanded wings, exhausted.
We picked it up without the aid of the net before it could recover,

At the risk of re-discovering America, I would extol the merits of
curd-cheese. For a year past I have proved it a light and nourishing diet
for all species of insect-eaters. From the smallest Warblers to Nightin-
gales, Rock Thrushes and the hardier Thrush tribe, without exception all
eat it readily, even at first sight, and thrive 011 it My birds prefer it to
everything, except live insects. It is easily made, keeps fresh a couple of
days, but seems no less wholesome for being sour, and, chopped fine, mixes
well with ant's eggs and other foods.
Perhaps it is because I number few skilful bird-keepers among my
acquaintances, but it seems to me this preparation is too little known and
used.
I make mine by stirring a saltspoonful of tartaric acid, in powder,
into a quart of boiled milk half-cool. Sometimes the composition of the
milk makes more tartaric necessary, and the cheese can be hardened or
toughened at will by boiling the milk more than once, and by adding more
acid and pressing the curds.
A useful supplementary food, which keeps sweet indefinitely and is
liked by many insect-eaters, is coarse maize-meal (polenta), made crumbly
with olive oil. In Italy it is the standard food for Robins and the Thrushes.
I find Woodpeckers and Wrynecks like it, and in aviaries some of the
Finches will eat it for a change. It is inexpensive, too.
Silkworm cocoons have the same advantage and keep for a long time,
and are recommended by some amateurs. But I do not find the more
delicate birds like them--they are fatty,--although a small quantity pow-
dered, mixed with other food, will pass muster and help to vary the diet.
Choughs and Rails relish them, given whole.
Can any of our members report on their use with Waders? And can
any report on the qualities of chafers or Mavbugs, baked, powdered and
bottled for winter use ?
My experience is that no kind of insects suit caged birds so well, in
the long run, as the orthoptera. Rock-thrushes sing well on nothing else
than thirty or forty small grasshoppers a day, and so will Nightingales, 011
rather less. My Solitary Thrushes, and even Indian Slianias, will kill a full-
sized locust, and eat it at a meal, but will not attack a second that day.
Scops Owls are well suited with a diet of cockroaches.

BLACK-CHEEKED LOVE-BIRDS.
Sir, -- I thought the following notes on the breeding of Black-cheeked
Love-birds might interest your readers; as, though Mr. Reginald Phillipps
has wrttten at great length on the same subject in Vols. VI. and VII., he
does not seem to have noted the exact dates on which the eggs were laid,
and the young hatched, etc.
As I found my Black-cheeks seemed likely to go on breeding for ever,
after I had got all the young ones I wanted, I determined to take careful
notes of the next nests. Most writers say they are shy sitters. I can only
say that mine are not: for I not only was able to examine the two nests
almost daily, but I frequently took them down and opened them to show
the eggs or voung to friends. The nests are all long boxes about 12 to T4L1S.
long, 6ins. deep and 6ins. high, with a round hole at the side near one end.
Tliev are hung on a nail to the wall in the inner part of the aviary, and the
top opens like the lid of a box. The following are my notes.
Nest No. 1. 1st egg laid July 13th; 2nd, July 15th; 3rd on 17th;
4th 011 20th; 5th on 22nd; 6th on 24th. The birds commenced to sit on
July 22nd--after the 5th egg was laid. The first young one was hatched on
August 8th, after seventeen days. Two young ones left the nest on Sept.
11 til, and two others were murdered by their elder brothers and sisters in
the nest. The other two eggs were clear.
Nest No. 2. 1st egg laid July 22nd; 2nd on 24th; 3rd on 25th;
4U1 on 27th; 5th on 30th. Birds commenced to sit July 25th. I was from
home from August 10th to September 9U1 ; but three young birds left the
nest between September 12th and 17th.
Nest No. 3. ist egg laid September 28th ; 2nd September 30th ;
3rd October 2nd ; 4th on 3rd ; and 5th 011 the 5th. Birds commenced to sit
October 4th. Two young birds hatched October 20th ; after sixteen days ;
one October 22nd, and one October 24th. I found them all dead in nest on
November 9th, with their heads scalped.
The above notes seem to show that the birds commence to sit when
they have almost completed their clutch of eggs: and that tuey sit foi from
sixteen to seventeen days.
I11 making their nest in the long boxes, they block up the end nearest
the entrance with sticks, leaves, etc., allowing only a narrow passage at the
top to crawl along, but leave a good-sized chamber at the other end for the
nest. The condition of this chamber after three or four broods have been
hatched would delight the heart of a Sanitary Inspector.

I should like to supplement Mr. Phillipps's account bv offering some
remarks upon the mouth-decoration of the nestling.
I was not fortunate enough to rear any young this season, but I had
an opportunity, denied to Mr. Phillipps, of handling a recently deceased
nestling. My birds made a fairly compact nest of bents in a tussock of
grass, much like a Willow Wren's nest, and lined it profusely with Sand
Grouse feathers. Though very late in the season, and in miserable weather,
one young bird was hatched on the nth September, out of three eggs, and
reared till it died on the 13th day. I believe it was killed by cold, through
the parent being accidentally flushed off the nest in the night, probably by
a branch of an over-hanging tree falling on the aviary roof.
1 he following notes were taken as soon as it was found the next
morning.
The palate ornamented by six black dots and the tongue by two,
while the tip of the latter was also black. Two small iridescent, opal-
coloured, bead-like warts on each side of the upuer, and one of greater
size and brilliancy on each side of the lower mandible, the spaces between
the warts being black.
The general colour of the gape bluish-white above and flesh-coloured
beneath. The eyes only partly open.
Mr. Pycraft, to whom I sent the nestling in spirit, remarks in a letter
upon the curious resemblance of these ornaments to those of the mouth
of the nestling Gouldiau Finch (Australian), which had also occurred to me.

The accompanying extract from the Daily Mail of 13th December
may not have been seen by all our Members, so I have asked the Editor to
reproduce it.
It deals with the introduction of the American Robin into this
country, an experiment which seems to have passed the experimental stage,
and one which we hope will not be accompanied with the disadvantage of
the introduction of our birds into Australia, and the Sparrow into
America.
There would seem no reason why some of the larger Parrakeets, such
as Rosellas, should not live through our winter, and nest successfully in
this country ; they would make a beautiful addition to our avi-fauna, but it
would be probably a rather costly experiment.

lias been given in the Daily Mail. It will be remembered that in the early
part of last year a dozen American " Robins," or more properly Thrushes-
were brought over to England and kept in a large aviary in a country
garden. When breeding time came they duly nested in the aviary, but con-
gregation is not congenial with the family svstem ; many of the clutches
were broken, and none likely to be hatched. When this was discovered the
eggs were taken out as they were laid and put into the nests of wild
Thrushes and Blackbirds ; some few pairs of " Robins " were enlarged.
The success of both systems was such that the dozen Robins were multi-
plied eight-fold at the end of the summer.
So far, so good, The English summer, as breathed in the shine and
shade of a beautiful garden, proved thoroughly sympathetic with the
American birds. They fed and bred and flourished without disturbance from
their neighbours or their surroundings.
Will they remain ? The pleasing fact is now to be chronicled that up
to December io they have remained. One migrating period, so far as it
has any definite date, is over. Many Blackbirds and Thrushes have gone to
France. Flocks of male birds have launched themselves from the shores
of Kent southwards and eastwards. But the hundred ' Robins,' though
many have wandered from their garden centre, have not congregated or
flown away."

In September last Mr. R. Phillipps sent me the body of a young
male Pied Rock-Thrush, bred by him that month) and killed by its father
oil the 26th, with a request that I would describe it, which I thereupon
attempted to do as hereunder:
General colour above mottled drab, the ground-colour of the feathers
being earth-brown, with a blackish band just before tip, which is cream-
colour. Bases of feathers 011 the head grey-blue, and of the back pure
white, but these were only visible where feathers are missing or disturbed.
Upper tail-coverts dull orange, with indistinct buff tips. Wings dark earth-
brown, the coverts distinctly tipped with buff, which forms an edging to
the greater and primary series. Quills tipped and edged with pale drao,
the edging very narrow on the primaries.
Centre tail-feathers dark earth-brown, the others dull orange with a
slight dark brown edging on the tip half of the outer web, this becoming
quite broad and well-marked on the outer pair.
General colour below barred, the feathers having black bars just in
advance of the tips, on a ground colour of mixed orange and dull cream-
colour, the tips being always of the latter colour. Under wing-coverts pure
orange. Under tail-coverts pale dull orange, with cream-coloured tips, vent
pale buff, unspotted.

The blue on the head and orange on the breast have the appear-

though I also found a few pin-feathers on the head.
Feet very dark horn-colour, beak dark horn, with bases of both jaws,
especially lower, shading into orange.
The bird was in good condition, and in perfect plumage, except for a
few feathers missing on head, nape and back, and could not have been
distinguished from a wild one. Frank Finn.

Mr. Seth-Smitli has recently handed me a most interesting letter from
a lad}' who describes a very curious change of colour going on in her Grey
Parrot, the breast and legs (presumably the thighs) of which are turning
scarlet. She " has had it twenty-five years, and it began to get the scarlet
feathers about six years ago ; it is now (November, 1909) beginning to get
them 011 its backs, under its wings, and also a few are coming on
the top of its wings." It seems to me that this assumption of red
in a bird already of a good age points to constitutional weakness, and
apropos of this I may perhaps be permitted to quote what I wrote in my
book " Pets and how to keep them " in 1907, respecting these "King"
Grey Parrots, as the varieties showing abnormal red feathers are called : " the
best specimen of the variety I ever saw, a bird which was really more red
than grey, showed the plumage of a thin and sickly character, and I have
since heard that it moulted out much greyer, thus showing the red feather-
ing to have been a sign of constitutional disturbance. Frank Finn.
OBITUARY.
It is with sincere regret that ornithologists will have heard of the
death, on Christmas day last, of Dr. R. Bowdler Sharpe, an Assistant
Keeper of the British Museum, and long the acknowledged head of British
Ornithologists--it would not be exaggerating to say that he was the premier
ornithologist of the world. Although he had written an immense number
of scientific papers and several monographs, and done much popular work
besides, he will be best remembered by his connection with that magnificent
publication, the British Museum Catalogue of Birds, nearly half the volumes
of which were his work. Dr. Sharpe's kindly and genial manner and
readiness to place his knowledge at the disposal of everyone who needed
assistance, had rendered him widely popular, and no one in the ornitho-
logical world will be so much missed or so sincerely mourned. He was
made an honorary member of this Society in 1902. F. F.

THE BROWN-NECKED PARROT.
Pceocephalus fuscicollis.
By E. Hopkinson, D.S.O., M.A., M.B., F.Z.S.
The subject of this article is one of the three Parrots
found in the Gambia, the other two being Pceocephalus senegalus
and Palceomis docilis. It is an extraordinarily ugly-looking bird
011 account of its huge, powerful beak and ungainly head, its
heavy build and rather dull colouration, and except for its
rarity, possesses few attractions as a cage-bird, as I have found
most of those I have had very difficult to keep alive for any
length of time, and this is especially the case with young birds
taken from the nest. Even when odd ones do survive, they
rarely or never assume any semblance of tameness, or get rid of
the awful habit of screaming wildly when anyone goes near
them. However, this bird has always interested me owing to
the peculiarity that the young are actually more brightly
coloured than the adults, and because I am still doubtful as to
what species it really belongs to. The name at the head of this
article is that by which it is known at the Zoo, but our birds
differ in many respects from the descriptions of that species
which I have read, particularly in the differences between the
young and old. When I first saw these birds here I thought
that they were the same as P. levaillanti , a few of which I saw in
South Africa, but as soon as I got a specimen in my hands, I
saw that our bird was quite different from the South African one ;
for one thing our bird's beak is half as big again, I should think,
as that of Eevaillant's Parrot. During the seven years I have
been in the Gambia, I have had a good number of these birds

Dr. E. Hopkinson,
through my hands, both alive and dead, and have often watched
the change from the red-headed stage of the youngster to that
of the grey-headed, red-winged and -thighed adult, and am
quite sure that all my red-headed birds were young ones, as ^
practically all were brought me from the nest before they
could fly. .
The following notes taken from three birds I had alive
in April, 1906, give the differences in their plumage at the
different ages.
No. 1. A very old bird, which had been slightly winged
by a shot the previous January, and which eventually went to
the Zoo. Whole head (including forehead) neck and upper
chest brown-grey; each feather with a darker centre ; reddish
tinge on chin. Back dusky green; scapulars, flights and tail,
dull black, with a greenish tinge; rump, upper tail-coverts,
breast, abdomen, thighs and under tail-coverts grass - green,
brightest on the rump ; under wing-coverts dark green merging
into grey. Edge of wing (at angle) and ring round lower end
of thigh orange-vermilion. Sexes apparently alike. 1 lie beak,
which is very large and strong and looks out of all proportion to
the size of the bird, is liorn-coloured ; the cere a paler shade of
the same colour. Legs black; iris dark brown. Length 12
inches.
No. 2. A younger but nearly adult bird noosed 011 a
groundnut heap. Like No. 1 with a grey head, but the green of
the rump and under surface was not quite so bright and there
was no sign of vermilion on the angle of the wing or thighs.
No. 3. A very young but fully feathered bird, with just a
few tufts of down showing 011 back and breast ; taken from the
nest. The whole crown from forehead to nape bright brick-red
(or rather a colour between brick-red and pink), with a pale
wash of the same colour over the rest of the head, the ground
colour of which is brownish grey as in the adult. This red
persists for four or five months after the bird leaves the nest, and
during that time gradually changes into the grey of the adult
though some signs of it last till the first moult. In otliei
respects the plumage resembled that of No. 2.
In Rochebrune's " Oiseaux de Senegambie " there is 1

071 the Brow 7 i- 7 iecked Parrot, 109
coloured (rather crude) plate of P.fuscicollis (Reickenbach), which
exactly repiesents our adult bird, but in the descriptions of the
species I have seen the forehead and cheeks of the adult are
described as red (certainly not the case in our bird) and there is
uo mention of the red heads in the young. In the Hand List of
Birds of the British Museum two Pceocephali are given, whose
range includes Senegambia (1) P. senegalus , the Senegal
Parrot, which is very common here, and (2) P. rubricapillm. I
have never seen any description of the latter, and wonder whether
it is our bird or whether perhaps P. rubricapillus may have been
named from a young specimen of the Gambian bird. Perhaps
some readers may be able to help on this point of diagnosis.
These birds, whatever may be their proper scientific name,
are well-known here as Bambara* Jobo (the Bambara Parrot),
their Mandingo name, which they owe to the common belief that
they come fiom the East, where the Bambara people live, and
because of their strength and size, the Bambaras being a
particularly tall and powerful race.
In the Gambia these Parrots appear to be confined to that
part of the country between the mouth of the Vinntang Creek
(al)out 30 miles from the sea) and the McCarthy Island District,
some 150 miles up the river, and within these limits are especially
common on the South Bank where the country is well-wooded
and fringed with a very deep belt of Mangroves. They never
seem to wander far away from the river or its creeks at any time,
and even on our boundary, though in most places this is only
seven miles fiom the river, one never sees them ; nor have I ever
come across a single individual in the Upper River, where there
are no Mangroves (and therefore probably no attractions for the
Bambaras) nor in the districts near Bathurst and the sea, where,
although there are plenty of Mangroves, these are bushes rather
than trees. I11 fact one may say that they confine themselves to
that pait of the country where the water is neither too salt nor
too fresh, but sufficiently brackish to encourage a luxuriant
growth of Mangroves. I11 the breeding season they are even
moie local, and aie then hardly ever to be seen outside the
Mangrove belt.

Dr. E. Hopkinson,
During the winter months they go about in parties of six
to twelve, visiting the farms and clearings to feed on the ground-
nuts, which are dug up about November and left in heaps in the
open to dry ; but every evening they are to be seen flying off m
the direction of the river to roost in the trees which border it.
They make their presence known far and wide as they fly over by
their hoarse grating cries, and look when on the wing as if they
were weighed down in front by their huge beaks and heads,
though in spite of this apparent topheaviness their flight,
accomplished with very rapid wing-beats, is fast and powerful.
Their breeding season commences about March or April, and
they make their nests in holes in the larger trees of the
Mangrove belt, which is half forest, half swamp, an almost
impenetrable growth, except by means of the small creeks which
in places pierce it, and to which they keep themselves almost
entirely during the hot months of the year. Occasionally an odd
one or two may be met with in the open at this season, but never
more, and these would only be a pair or so flying over from one
Mangrove-bordered creek to another or perhaps merely taking a
short flight to break the monotony of their household cares.
One May I had to spend the night in a canoe in one ot the cieeks
of the South Bank, owing to the stupidity of my boatmen, who
kept taking the wrong turnings and eventually landed 11s with a
rapidly falling tide in a cul-de-sac, thus converting what ought to
have been an hour's journey into one of rather more than twelve
hours ; that morning I shall always remember how I was
awakened by the really deafening clamour with which a
party of these Bambaras, waking up in the tree tops, greeted the
first rays of the rising sun, or the zest with which a few moments
later they came down to a shallow place and took their morning
drinks and baths.
The sight of these Parrots, which from what I had seen
of them in the dry season or in captivity, I had always regarded!
as morose and rather sluggish birds, playing 111 and round the
water and darting about most actively among the branches or
helping one another to preen and dry their plumage, was almost
sufficient to make up for one of the most unpleasant nights I
have spent-- aground in a leaking canoe and rocking on a sunken

nr
log, surrounded on all sides by black mud, blacker water and
slippery Mangrove roots, with millions of mosquitoes and other
flying things to plague or bite, while at intervals huge slimy
beasts, half slug, half caterpillar, dropped from the boughs
above. It is in such safe places that the Bambaras breed, and I
should think that under such circumstances and in such naturally
protective surroundings their infant mortality should be low.
Their only enemies here (except for the very occasional small
boy who would venture so far after their young) must be the
Green Monkeys, and against them the old birds should have
splendid weapons in their terrible beaks ; once bitten by one of
these a Monkey would be more than twice shy, for he would
carry for the rest of his days in what was left of his hand and
fingers a souvenir which would make him most chary of ever
putting his fingers into holes again to look for Parrot eggs.
As cage-birds, as I said before, I can hardly recommend
the Bambaras. I have had a good many at times, a few of which
have got home, mostly to the Zoo, but they certainly do not do well
in captivity. The young I have almost given up trying to keep, as
I have never yet known survive any longer than eight months, an
age too that was only reached by one of my birds, most of which
died soon after being taken, or at any rate within six months.
While hand fed they take readily what is given them, chiefly
crushed and chewed groundnuts, with perhaps a little bread,
biscuit or boiled rice, and as they get older and begin to feed
themselves, will eat groundnuts freely, though nothing else ; but
they rarely seem to thrive. I think the reason must be that they
are fed by their parents almost entirely on the seeds or fruit of
the Mangroves among which they are born, and that for this we
can supply no efficient substitute. The old birds thrive better,
or at any rate last longer ; one I had lived two years at least at
the Zoo after it got there, and there is another there now (looking
as well as a Bambara can look, when I last saw him) who must be
more than eighteen months old by now. But even the old ones
can hardly be said to do really well in captivity ; there is
certainly no trouble about getting them to feed when first
caught, as they will begin to eat groundnuts within a few hours,
and as long as these are fresh and full of oil, as we get them here,

they do well enough, but after about May, when the nuts begin
to get dry, and especially later on in England, where the ground-
nuts obtainable are dried-up, wretched little things compared to
the fresh article out here, they apparently get very little nourish-
ment out of their food and gradually decline. If one could get
them earlier on to some other suitable Parrot food, such as
maize, sunflower, rice, bread or potato they would no doubt have
a better chance, but most of those I have had would apparently
rather go hungry than try anew diet; they would sit all day with
an abundance of all sorts of good food round them waiting till
their master relented and put in a handful on their favourite
nuts, when down they came and gobbled for all they were worth.
The two birds which survived longest certainly owed their
survival to their having taken to other food as the supply of
groundnuts decreased ; the one at the Zoo would eat a little
ordinary seed and sopped maize, while the last I took home
would occasionally condescend to take a small piece of bread or
potato, even before the groundnuts began to get old and un-
satisfactory. I see I said at the beginning of this article that the
Bambaras never got tame ; however every rule&apos;has an exception,
and I must not forget to mention one I saw in Bathurst some
years ago, which was really steady and apparently reconciled to
captivity, though I noticed that its owner never trusted his
fingers within reach of his pet's beak, and that when changing
the water tin in its cage, he was careful to keep the hand inside
near the bird's tail end, while the other had (outside) engaged
and interested its head.
In conclusion may I again hope that some of the Parrot-
experts among our readers will be able to tell us to what species
this bird really belongs, for if so the writer at least will be very
grateful ?

By Lieut.-Colonel G. A. Momber.
We will define the Riviera as the seaboard between Hyeres
and Genoa, with as much of the hinderland as owes a mild
climate to the midland sea on the South, and a screen of hills
on the North. These hills gradually become the Ligurian and
Maritime Alps, with points of 5,000 and 6,000 feet, which carry
snow half the year. The seaboard is densely populated, holdings
run small, and every yard of suitable ground is tilled for flower
cultivation ; the remainder being either waste land or olive
terraces and vineyards. The olive trees hold the hillsides to a
height of some 1,500 feet; above that is the chestnut zone, and
at 2,000 feet the pine zone begins, with hollies, heaths, junipers,
and myrtles scattered about. Few pine forests are left now, for
Italians and French alike recklessly consumed their woods, with-
out planting others, and the present generation is reaping its
heritage of treeless mountains, which, at their summit, are rocky
deserts.
Southern France, and especially Italy, are naturally rich in
birds. Three continents, in fact, the whole of the Old World,
contribute desultory migrants; and numerous regular visitors
also are assured by the fact that the high roads of avine migration
in Europe lie across the Mediterranean, and that many of the
migrants, to some extent, winter on its shores. But the Riviera
is not the bird-lovers' paradise it should be, for merciless per-
secution by man thins the winged ranks to skeleton companies,
and the survivors become difficult to observe. The excessively
ornithophagous proclivities of the Southerner are a heavy set-
back to the advantages lavished by nature on his country.
Everyone shoots, nothing is spared, and the daintiest songsters--
Goldfinches. Siskins, Robins, Warblers--hang in bunches on the
town markets.
In Italy, the protective laws are still embryonic, and
seldom enforced ; offenders are leniently dealt with and illegal
practices prevail. I11 general, wholesale methods of bird-catching
are prohibited in Liguria ; it is in the provinces of Como and
Piedmont that the gardens of death flourish, the terrible roccolo
and passata. But the popular amusement of besetting with bird-

limed grasses the streams in dry weather is indulged in despite
the law, and is singularly destructive and wasteful, for all the
birds of the district get limed, and many are not even bagged,
but flutter away to die a lingering death.
If proof were needed of the deep-rooted passion for bird-
hunting of the Italians, it could be found in the fact that in
U.S.A. the Audubon Societies find it necessary to disseminate
leaflets among the Italian immigrants, printed in their tongue,
exhorting them to respect the laws and customs of their new
country, and to refrain from destroying that which is beautiful
as well as profitable.
These habits are less surprising in a newly-united Kingdom
such as Italy, still tinged with mediaevalism and the traditions
of many formerly separate small States, than in hranee. For
France signed the International Convention of 1902, and thus is
accredited with the perspicacity and aesthetic development which
are inseparable from an intelligent and humane protection of
natural objects. But, after giving itself the sound and sufficient
laws of the Convention, as now in force in Germany, Switzer-
land, Austria and Hungary, and after appointing a day for these
enactments to take effect, the French Chamber, by a large
majority in November, 1906, passed an " indulgence decree,"
suspending sine die the application of the laws, and upholding
the old order of things, which means an annual issue by prefects
of departments of regulations relating to game and birds; many
axes to grind; the road open to every abuse ; and the old
systematic war of extermination carried on indefinitely. It is
a poignantly ridiculous condition of affairs, until one remembers
the political corruption and favouritism that lie at its root, and
the steady diminution of bird-life it causes. Then it becomes
deplorable.
The following is a list of British birds the writer has per-
sonally observed, in the flesh, either at large or newly caught or
killed at San Remo, during the last five winters

A collection of skins obtained at Bordighera some years
ago, and now on view at the Library, further includes: Corn
Bunting, Curlew, Bagle Owl, Little Bittern, Woodlark, Wood
Sandpiper. The above by no means comprise all the British
species found on the Riviera, for there is hardly a British land-
bird which is not claimed to have occurred there ; and nearly all
the sea fowl, too, are included in a list of 343 varieties, published
in a comprehensive handbook on Genoa, " Descrizioue di Genoa
e del Genovesato," 1847. Although so old, this work seems
reliable, and is now scarce.
Oddi, in his Manual of Italian Ornithology, credits Italy
with 445 species and 28 subspecies, the latter including such
local variations as Whitehead's Nuthatch, the Cisalpine Sparrow,
etc.
Noticeable is the absence of water and marsh birds from
our index, due no doubt to there being 110 suitable feeding
grounds for them, and no flat land of any kind ; but though
rarely seen, both waders and swimmers are to be heard flying
over at night. Most of the species indicated are stationary ; the
number of individuals being increased in winter by immigrants
from the North ; but Cuckoo, Redstart, Hoopoe, Oriole, Pipit,
Bee-eater, Wheatear, Turtle, and all the swallow tribe arrive in
April.

u6 Lieut.-Colonel G. A. Momber,
It is somewhat remarkable that these migrants re-appear
in Southern Europe very little, if any, earlier than in England ,
that they leave no later, although the weather conditions usually
remain genial until Christmas; and that the nesting operations
of the resident species are not more forward than with us. By
way of exception, a pair of Stonechats, which had haunted a
rough barren hillside near the sea all winter, nested there, and
launched their fledgelings on April 9, 1908.
Whilst the Little Owl is stationary and is often rather
noisy in its hollow tree at sundown all through the wiutei, Scops
is a summer migrant. Scops is here the more nocturnal of the
two, and sounds its monosyllabic whistle at short intervals
throughout the warm nights.
Numerous Blackcaps, Goldfinches, Siskins, Grey Wagtails
and Chiffchaffs winter on the Riviera; and Hawfinches, Chaf-
finches, Bramblings and Coal Tits descend from the hills to the
coast in cold weather. Large numbers of Song 1 brushes, and
with them some Redwings and occasionally Fieldfares, make the
pine zone their habitat from late Autumn to April, and roost
there at night, and spend a part of the day among the olive
groves lower down, they are considered big game by the local
gunners, and a lire 18 licence legalizes their being shot until as
late as March 31. Redwings and Fieldfares do not nest in Italy,
but it is now established that Song Thrushes do, exceptionally.
Throughout Italy there is a brisk demand for all I brushes, for
culinary purposes, when they are retailed at 40 or 50 centimes
each, and also as live decoys to attract their kind within reach
of the pot-hunters gun. Alive they make lire 2 and upwards,
and thousands are illegally snared in fine nets, sometimes 200
metres long, and four or five metres broad, dhese nets are
stretched across the narrow valleys, up which the birds skim in
swift, low flight, on their return at sundown to the mountains.
Some Blackbirds are stationary on the Riviera. Their
breeding grounds extend farther South than those of the Song
Thrush*; they nest throughout Italy, and the writer has found
their brood in Tenerife in March. On the Riviera many of the
British species hardly leave the cooler, moister climate of the
hills, and are rarely seen by the coast; Gold Crest, Jay, Raven,

Missel.Thrush, Yellowhammer, Hedge Warbler. The latter is
described by Oddi * as an Alpine species in Italy, as are also the
Marsh-tit, Coal-tit, and Tree-creeper. The Italian name for the
Creeper is Rampichino alpestre, the alpine climber; and Long-
tailed Tit, Skylark, Bullfinch, Sparrow Hawk, and, in summer,
Willow Wren are equally considered mountain dwellers.
In late April the summer migrants arrive, and often stay a
few days before passing on. The coast is not quiet enough for
most of these, and water and cover are too scarce to tempt them
to remain and rest. But Nightingales will establish themselves
in any leafy spot where they find water, and freedom from being
molested ; such as Grasse, a few miles inland of Cannes. Night-
ingales are more plentiful throughout Italy and Southern France,
than in the damp North.
O11 the Riviera Wrynecks are very abundant, arriving in
early April and remaining to breed. Quail begin to arrive in
late April, and the shooting season is kept open until May 31st
for them, for aquatic birds and "for birds of passage." Of
course, this paves the way for much abuse, much indiscriminate
slaughter, for it keeps the gunners afield, and if peradventure a
sportsman is brought to book--a faint probability--he can claim
any kind of fowl to be a bird of passage, which indeed it is.
Was it not Gatke who wrote that when the course of
migration runs smooth, little of it is observable. It is the mis-
fortunes, the bad chances, that we witness. The truth of this
is well illustrated, when exhausted Quail, after crossing the
Mediterranean, pitch on the first land they see. Then, during
the month of May, the seaboard from Portugal to Constantinople
is patrolled by innumerable Chasseurs, who render the roads
parlous by their erratic fusillades. Gun accidents--sometimes
:atal--are not infrequent along the Riviera, and the Ligurian's
liabit of carrying his loaded piece everywhere at full cock, makes
it probable that more casualties occur than become generally
known.
Robins arrive in force during October, but only a few
&apos;einain after November has passed. During these two months

autumn pugnacity proves his undoing, and laige numbers aie
taken and duly eaten with polenta. Wrens also are passage
birds, during winter, and establish themselves in gardens and
bushy places until the warm weather sets in, when they move back
to their mountains. The Great Tit is stationary tlnoughout the
year, and finds good nesting sites in the hollow olive-trees ; and has
become so cautious and wary that it is less victimized than most
other varieties. This Tit, the House Sparrow, and the Blackcap
Warbler are perhaps the most abundant species, taking the
seasons together, and the rich, joyous fluting of the latter makes
the sunshine resonant, even on the shortest days.
Of the winter visitors, some years show a marked inciease
over others. Although there appear to exist no reliable notes
taken over a long enough time to establish any theoiy of
periodicity, the phenomenon is constantly being recorded in
different countries; witness the invasion of the British Isles by
Woodcock in 1908, and by Crossbills in 1909.
Near San Remo, during the winter 1903-4- there was a
great incursion of Coal Tits. Caged Coal H its weie hanging
outside all the houses, and the confiding little fellows were
snared and eaten in large numbers. &apos;The old chasseuis prophe-
sied a repetition of this in three years. But they were wrong,
and few Coal Tits have been seen since. The British sub-species
of this bird is recorded by Arrigoni D. Oddi as a winter visitor
to Italy. This year (1909) Siskins are numerous ; in 1905-6 more
Goldfinches than usual appeared ; other years again are maiked
by an influx of Cirl Buntings or Crossbills. A spell of cold in
Feb. 1907, brought remarkable numbers of Mountain Finches.
Everywhere they were hopping about the roads and gardens
like Sparrows, and doing about the same amount of damage. A
number of gunners, one cold day, posted themselves in line at a
place on the hills which the birds were crossing, and kept up a
brisk musketry for hours.
In the winter, 1908-9, Hawfinches were plentiful; alsc
Linnets, which had not previously been observed for four or five
years. The causes of such abnormalities in migration offer at

interesting problem, which should in time be solved by increased
observation.
Some of our common Northern birds, which are erratic
and which may or may not wander to Southern Europe during
the winter, will also summer and nest there, if they can find the
climate they require, coinciding with suitable surroundings. Of
course, this is only possible at high altitudes. Hedge Accentor,
Chough and Yellowhammer have been referred to as residents of
the mountains of Liguria. In the fir woods that fringe the high
broad valley above Thorene, 3,000 feet, in Provence, the writer
saw, in June 1906, many immature Siskins which had recently
left the nest and were undoubtedly bred there. These birds are
not found in the low lands so far South during summer. On the
high plateau of Mount Revard, 5,000 feet, in Savoy, in June 1908,
Skylarks were soaring over the wide stretches of open grass land,
and Song Thrushes were singing in some fir plantations. But
neither species was seen or heard anywhere else, during some
weeks of rambling in that region, where, indeed, they are looked
upon as winter visitors. This observation was confirmed in
June, 1909, and nestling Song Thrushes were seen, which had
been taken 011 a neighbouring hill, near the Gde. Chartreuse
monastery. The vertical migration ascribed to certain Alpine
species, such as the Wall Creeper and Alpine Accentor, which
move up or down their mountain in response to the changing
season, would seem, therefore, to be practised by a greater
number of varieties than is commonly supposed.
It is an interesting fact, in the bird lore of Southern Europe,
that in certain localities many species have been observed only
during the Spring migration, others are not seen but in Autumn.
Of some species, the old birds are recorded in Spring, and only
the immature young are seen in Autumn. This emphasizes
Gatke's statement that the journey to the South takes a different
route from the return to the North ; that the points of arrival
and the points of departure are not the same. It makes it clear,
also, that different species, and even the different ages of one
species may steer each their own course, and that this is not
necessarily the same every journey.

THE DECEPTIVE TURTLE-DOVE.
Turtur decipiens.
By T. H. Newman.
As very little has appeared in the pages of our magazine
about this highly interesting species of Collared Turtle Dove, I
propose to give a few notes about my experiences of the bird,
which date from November, 1905, when I received my first two
specimens.
I do not know why Finscli and Hartlaub bestowed the
name "Deceptive" on the bird; perchance they had heard the
very curious note, and had beeii beguiled into the belief that
they were confronted by some savage beast, instead of a " gentle "
dove. Anyhow, the name seems appropriate, for if two male
birds (I subsequently bred young from both) could not only
make the bird-man of one of our principal members believe that
they were a pair, but even imagine that they laid eggs, and if a
hen could make one of the most experienced bird-keepers at the
Zoo. believe that it was a cock, I think they must be considered
deceptive by nature as well as name.
It is a very handsome bird, most nearly resembling the
Half-collared Turtle (T. semiiorquatus), but considerably smaller,
a little larger perhaps than a common Barbary Dove. The
Museum Catalogue gives a total length of 12.4 inches for semi-
tor quatus, and 12 inches for decipiens ; but an adult male of the
former which I bred in 1906 measuied about 13^ inches in the
flesh, while two adult male decipiens measured respectively about
ha inches and 12J inches, also measured in the flesh.
The typical bird is a warm brown 011 the upper surface;
the breast is vinous changing into lead grey 011 the flanks ; the
under tail coverts are paler grey tipped with whitish, which is
very characteristic of the species ; centre of abdomen whitish ;
the vinous of the breast passes up along the anterior part of the

head to the nape, where it is very pronounced ; the crown and
cheeks ashy ; chin and throat whitish; central tail-feathers
greyish brown ; basal half of under surface of tail black ; apical
half light grey ; only a very narrow whitish line along the outer
edge of the outermost tail-feathers; edges of wings grey;
primaries blackish ; a very broad black collar on the hind neck,
edged above with ashy white ; iris buffy orange, bare skin round
the eye grey tinged with pink ; inner edge of eyelids black ; bill
black ; feet carmine. The above is taken from an adult male
and female from Kordofan, and as I shall point out later on are
doubtless referable to typical decipie?is.
The species inhabits East Africa from Dongola to the
Zambesi, and one form occurs in West Africa in Angola ; as one
would expect in such a wide range the species differs somewhat
in tone of colour in different parts of its range. The typical race
is found along the Nile, from Dongola to Kordofan. As this
form is common on the White Nile, the specimen in the British
Museum from the Sobat River, and called ambiguus , probably
belongs to this form.
In 1905, Erlanger described the race from North Somali-
land under the name of griseiventris , which differs principally by
having the [flanks and abdomen a deep grey. In 1877 Bocage
gave the name ambiguus to a bird from Benguela in Angola, so
that this must be the typical locality for this race. It is said to
be of a somewhat yellow brown shade, and to have more grey on
the under surface.
In 1905 Reichenow pointed out that the bird from Victoria
Nyanza to the Zambesi which had hitherto been considered to
belong to the form ambiguus was really distinguishable from it,
and differed from it by being of a somewhat darker tone of brown
011 the upper surface, lighter grey 011 the sides of the Tody and
under wing coverts, and the white on the abdomen more extended.
The two birds from Tette in the British Museum, and there called
ambiguus, without doubt belong to this form which Reichenow
called permistus.
Lastly, there is perspicallatus from Nguru, at once recog-
nised by having the flanks and under tail coverts pure white; a
specimen from Ugogo which lies between Nguru and the country

Mr. T. H. Newman,
inhabited by permistus seems to be intermediate between these
two forms as it is mentioned as having the under tail-feathers
(coverts) washed with grey.
Habits. Witherby, writing of the typical form from the
White Nile, which he .however, calls ambiguus, Ibts, 1901, pp. 266,
267, writes: " Exceedingly abundant, except within twenty miles
of Khartum, where it became rarer.In the south of our
route they were so common and tame, and clustered so thickly
011 certain trees, that on several occasions we killed fourteen and
sixteen at a "family" shot, while five or six was no unusual
return for a single cartridge. All the pigeons we observed were
great drinkers, and flock after flock used to rush down to the
river regularly morning and evening. Returning from it 111 the
evening they often rose to a great height, and circling round,
suddenly plunged down headlong, like our wood-pigeons, into
the trees used as roosting places. On April 24th, near
Shebesha, I found a bird of this species sitting on two incubated
eggs, in a ,nest made of some twenty sticks, placed low down 111
a cactus plant growing upon a small acacia.' I
Rothschild and Wollaston, writing 011 the birds from
Shendi, Sudan, Ibis, 1902, p. 25, say : " This dove was very much
less numerous than the preceding species (roseogrueus) from
which it was readily distinguished by its larger size. It becomes
increasingly common as one goes southward from Shendi, which
place seems to be about its most uorthernly limit. A nest con-
taining two eggs was found in an Acacia bush on March 16 1 .
The nest was a light structure of twigs. The eggs are of a pure
white, without gloss, and measure 32.1 by 22.5, and 29.6 by 23 nnn.
Again, A. L. Butler, on the " Ornithology of the Egyptian
Soudan," Ibis, 1905, P- 359 . writing of T. decipiens and roseogrtseus
says: "These are quite the commonest doves 111 the Soudan.
decipiens however seems to keep more to the vicinity of rivers
than T. roseogriseus. In Kordofan it seems to be entirely absent.
I have taken eggs of T. decipiens on the White Nile in November.
Reichenow in his "Die Vogel AJrikas ," Vol. I., p. W-
writing of the form perspicillatus says: "A few examples only
noted between Kilmandscharo and Meruberg, in the district of
Nguru they occurred in greater numbers. Heie they nested by

I first saw this species in May, 1905, in the aviary of one ot
0111 niembeis, who very kindly allowed me to have them in the
following November; there were two of them, they came to me
for a pair, but subsequently turned out to be both males. It is
not often that one is able to find out the exact locality from
which one s birds come, but as these had been sent over privately,
through the kindness of their former owner I was able to ascer-
tain that they came from British Central Africa just north of
Chitomo, and not far from the Zambesi, so that they must belong
to the form permistus ; they differ from the birds described above
rom Kordofan by being perhaps a trifle larger, also having all
.heir colouis blighter and darker, the back is a more ruddy
orown, the cheeks are a shade darker grey, and the white 011 the
diin and abdomen is purer; the most striking difference lay in
he bare skin round the eye, which formed a broad raf circle,
itherwise the two races are identical in shape and distribution
&gt;f their colours, also their notes were indistinguishable ; they are
nost certainly only local forms of the same species.
O11 the 19th July, 1906, I got a female of true decipie?is , and
m May iotli, 1907, a second example, and 011 16th Nov., 1908,
male, 'lliese three birds, together with three others, were
*rought back from the White Nile by the expedition sent by the
Egyptian Government to get rare birds and beasts for the Giza
zoological Gardens, Cairo; they came from Kordofan and must
*e considered to be quite typical birds.
On the 31st July, 1906, one of my first male birds mated to
&apos;lie of the Kordofan females; four eggs were laid, resulting in
s many young ones; none were, however, reared, the eldest
uiviving about one month ; the old cock died 011 the 25th Sept.,
906. One of the Kordofan hens, perhaps the mate of the above
ock, died 011 the 29th Dec., 1908. The Kordofan cock died on
lie 28th Dec., 1908, when I had only had him a little over a

one of the Kordofan females. In June, 1906, the cock mate .
a Barbary Dove hen ; they were together until February 1907,
six Young hybrids were fully reared-four cocks and two hens
very handsome birds taking strongly after their father (I will
remark in passing that these hybrids, both male and female
were perfectly fertile, young ones even being freely produced
when thev were mated together). From Feb. to June, 1907, t te
cock was mated to one of the Kordofan hens; six young were
hatched, only two being reared by a pair of Turtle X Barbary
hybrid Doves. Both these, which were cocks, lived to be mate ,
one to a white hybrid hen dove ; a young one was hatche rom
this pair, but as the cock died before it was hatched it only lived
a few days. The other mated in May, .90S to one of the
Kordofan hens, with whom he remained unti the follow ng
November; about a dozen eggs were laid, several of which w
hatched, but no young were reared. Ibis coc&apos; tie 011

of his hybrid daughters, three young were reared, which could
hardly be distinguished from pure-bred decipum. The by r.
hen having died in January, 1908. her father again mated to a
Kordofan hen in the following April. I am not certain if this was
the same hen he was mated to in 1907 or the other; most probably
he had gone back to his old mate. Between April and November
about thirteen eggs were laid and twelve young ones hatched
most of these died when quite young, one lived to be ovei tw ,
months old, and one became adult and may be still living. I
parted with it on Nov. 16th, 1908. This was the first young one
entirely reared by Us parents. During 1909 fourteen eggs were
laid and nine young were hatched; two of these have beer
reared, but one was brought up entirely by the same pan o
hybrids that reared the two in 1907, so that with all this laigd
number of eggs laid, and young hatched, only six lived to be
independent, and three of these are now dead: while only
-two in 1908 and one in 1909-were brought up by their pare,, s

-entirely to the neglect of the parents, for of the two reared in
1909* although I gave the smaller and weaker young one of a
pair to the hybrids to rear, this young one grew faster, and left
the nest some days sooner than the one with its parents, and
became a much stronger-looking bird.
My birds invariably nest 011 the top of a pile of brushwood
in the inner house of the aviary, right in a corner. They often
carry up so many small sticks as to make a thick mass of twigs
several inches high, so that I have to take away most of them to
Prevent the eggs from rolling off the top. I have eight eggs
before me, laid in 1907-9; they are small for the size of the bird,
pure white, rather glossy and round, though three laid in 1908
aie lathei larger and longer in shape. The eggs generally hatch
on the 13th, sometimes on the 14th day after the second e^ 0-
is laid. The young 0:1 hatching are well covered with down,
longest 011 the crop region ; 011 the back of the neck, and back
as far as the tail, including the wings, it is a deep buff, almost
fawn coloui ; but is of a bright yellow on the under surface.
Sides of the head, including eyelids and bill, dark lead grev, tip
of bill pink with a dark purplish band, bare skin 011 chin and
surrounding the ear reddish grey; feet pink, claws bright pink.
I have a seiies of eight skins of young birds, ranging from under
a foitnight to over two months old; the under surface and nape
entiiely lack the vinous of the adult; in the youngest specimens
|Oii the uppei surface the feathers are very distinctly edged with
light brown, the crown is brownish, not grey as in the adult.
I note that the feathers of the collar are the last to appear, there
being a baie patch on each side of the neck when the bird is
otheiwise well fledged, but when these do come they form a
broad black band broken in the middle by brown feathers, the same
colour as those above and below the collar.
I he adult birds are of a cheerful disposition; the cock
bird often gives several hops or bounds after his mate, then as he
bows low to her he utters a coo more nearly resembling that of
the Barbary Dove than any other species of Collared Turtle that
I have heard. When in the nest calling the lien, a loud coo-hoo-
hoo is repeatedly given, the " tuhuhu&quot; of Reichenow, this is not

The Common Tree-partridge is a most lively little fellow,
ilmost as round as a cricket-ball, and with the tail pressed down-
wards and under the body as though the bird had been con-
linually backed up against a wall. Both sexes are beautifully
narked with brown 011 back barred with black and grey-chested.
The cock, however, is easily distinguished by his black throat
with white on neck below, whereas the hen has a rust-coloured
md black throat. The white spots on the flanks of the hen are
;aid to be larger than those on the cock, but in birds I have had
or some two years past I have found the size of spots on the
lens to vary greatly and even to change considerably in the
ame bird 011 moulting.
I usually keep my Common Tree-Partridges in the same
enclosure as a pair of Tragopan Pheasants--a place with a few
'oung Austrian pines, several low bushes and a shelter shed.
The partridges invariably roost high up in the pines, spending
heir days scratching under the trees with the utmost vigour and
"nly going under the shelter shed for a sand bath occasionally,
&apos;hey are easily tamed. I had doubts at first as to their hardi-
less, but found they would stand the severest cold (after being
;radually acclimatized on arrival from India). As to food--at
irst I thought they might require insect food in addition to corn,
nd accordingly gave them cleaned maggots (such as are sold
ir "coarse fishermen,") but, although the birds always devoured
hese with the utmost relish, I found they were quite unnecessary
nd that the birds do perfectly well on wheat and dari. This
ley pick up from amongst the Tragopans' food, stealing out
orn under the bushes and getting what they want in a short
pace of time as soon as the food is put down. They also readily
ike barley meal, which I give to the Tragopans in winter. The
&apos;ree-Partridges are so quick in movement they can easily evade
eing pecked by the Tragopans should the latter happen to be
ad-tempered, and when both lots of birds are feeding together
always elicits admiration from old ladies to see "the beautiful
id speckled fowls and their dear little chicks."
These Tree-Partridges give a peculiar whistle in the
3 ring time, but are quite silent for the rest of the year. I have

Mr. Frank Finn,
one another with grains of corn. They are always in good
feather and sprightly, and the one drawback to keeping them
seems to be that their continual scratching makes their run
untidy.
The Black-throated Tree-Partridge is in my opinion a less
handsome bird and less interesting than torqueola , nor, according
to my limited experience, is it so hardy--perhaps because in its-
native country it frequents lower elevations. It is stated to be
" less distinctly arboricole in its habits," which appears to be
quite true, as I have watched one fairly closely for about a year
and only seen it perch twice.

The call of this Rock-Pigeon, as I have heard it from cap-
tive birds, is not a coo, but a rapidly repeated croak, like a
hiccough. Although an essentially Alpine species, it does not
appear to feel the heat in Calcutta at all, and even shows signs of
breeding. When courting it does not sweep the tail like the
tame pigeon, though looking very like some of the continental
breeds of this bird.
Red Turtle-dove. Oenopopelia tranquebarica.
The eyelids of this dove are indifferently lead-coloured or
pink in different individuals. Rutledge once gave me an albinoid
male of this species, which much resembled in colour the cream-
coloured collared Dove ( Turtur risorius ), but had a pale grey
head. _ ...
Common Pea-fowl. Pavo cristatus.
Wild young of this bird were often to be had in the
Calcutta Market in my time. We also had in the Calcutta Zoo
specimens of the Black-winged (the so-called nigripennis) and
white varieties, imported from Europe. Our late Superintendent
there, Sanyal, saw a black-winged male pair, without previous
display or any fighting, with a hen white bird, whose white mate
had just displayed to 110 purpose. The same Black-winged bird

had been seen by another observer to display to some Lascar
sailors in bine and red. It killed another male of the same
variety, and later on the white male; yet I have seen him
and the white one both displaying to their respective hens at
once. I have also seen the present London Zoo. specimen of
this Black-winged variety displaying with several others and
not disturbing them, though he is the master bird of the lot.
In 1902 there were bred in the Zoo a pair of Peafowl from a
common male and a nigrifiennis female; they both resembled
the common kind. The immature male ?iig?&apos;ipe?i?iis when fully
feathered has the bases of the blue neck-feathers white and
the wings, except the chestnut primaries, white with strong
black pencillings, very like that on the wings of the adult
common Peacock, whereas in the young common bird at the
same stage the pencilling is fine, so that the wing looks much
more uniform and much like the hen's drab wing. The late Sir
George King, formerly Superintendent of the Calcutta Botanical
Gardens, told me he once saw a common Peacock they had there
plucking out his own train feathers when moulting ; surely this
is unusual with any bird ? I have seen a hen at the Zoo here
showing off to a cock, which was quite indifferent.
Javan Pea-fowl. Pavo muticus .
I11 India this bird is more delicate in captivity than the
common Pea-fowl, and also more savage. I saw two birds in
Calcutta, when desirous of attacking a Pheasant, spread out
their tails (they had no trains), and one dropped its wings too,
and raised its tail, assuming almost the show position. I have
also seen one show off before a Crow, apparently in anger.
Grey Jungle-fowl. Gallus sonnerati.
Blanford, quoting Jerdon, gives the legs and feet as horny
yellowish ; I have found them, both in India and here, salmon-
red in the cock when in full vigour ; in one at our Zoo which
had shown this colour, in 1906, the legs become wax-yellow
after death, as they had been when it first arrived in poor con-
dition. Hen seem always to have dull yellow legs.
Cheer Pheasant. Cat?eus wallichii.
This species is said not to show off, but a vicious male in
Calcutta Zoo used to show off in the common Pheasant's attitude,

Review.
aslant with spread tail, when trying to attack, and as the show
position so commonly seems to be the fighting one too, I expect
the species does tints display when courting. This bird utteied
a murmuring note when approached, like the Kaleege Pheasants
(Gennceus).
Monaul. Lopliophoriis refulgens.
Blanford says " The young resemble the female, except that
young males have the throat more or less black, and generally
are darker throughout." I found in some I got when I left India
finally that the young cocks were just like hens, except for a plain
buff patch on the back concealed by the wings, where the white
patch is in the old cock. When frightened in the coop my old
males raised and spread the tail in the courting position.
Bustard-Quail. Turnix pugnax.
I found that this small bird in captivity would eat even
large butterflies.
Little Button-Quail. Furnix dussumieri.
I observed in otherwise similar specimens brought alive to
the Calcutta market, that some had fleshy-white legs and some
pale blue-grey, the bills being blue in both cases.
Indian Button-Quail. Turnix tanki.
In April 1898, I saw a fine live specimen which had been
captured the night before in a butterfly-net, as it flew round a
street lamp. This was at Darjeeling, far higher up than it is
supposed to range in the Himalayas.

REVIEW.
A History of the Birds of Kent. By Norman F. Iicehurst, M.A.,
F.R.C.S., F.Z.S., M.B.O.U. *
In his preface Dr. Ticehurst tells us that when he first
undertook the preparation of this work no history of the avifauna
of Kent as a whole existed ; but, although since that time two
other works have appeared, he hopes the record ol his own work
for years past and that of many correspondents in all parts of
the County justify the production of this presumably exhaustive

treatise : that his hope was founded upon a sound basis will, I
think, be admitted by all interested in British birds, and especially
by those who, like the present reviewer, have studied the bird-
life of this country chiefly in Kent.
I11 a comprehensive work like Dr. Ticehurst's, which deals
with the geographical position of the County, its geological
features, its rivers, vegetation, avifauna and the migratory move-
ments of the latter, their number, an account of the various
museums and private collections in which they have been pre-
served and the authors who have described them, it was not
considered necessary or advisable to burden the chapters by
synonymic lists or technical descriptions of the species ; such
details are always to be secured by the reader from the Catalogue
of Birds in the British Museum, as well as from several works
dealing with the birds of Europe or the British Isles.
To the more strenuous students of bird-life the various
species are familiar and their synonymy is of secondary import-
ance ; whereas their haunts, their habits, their food, their
variations, the first discovery of their nests in the County,
as also the time and probable direction of their migrations, are
all matters of considerable interest; and it is just these facts
which render Dr. Ticehurst's book of inestimable value.
But, apart from the faultless character of the text, the
value of the book is greatly enhanced by the admirable illustra-
tions of Kentish scenery which one keeps stumbling upon ; these
remind one of past pleasures and companions, of birds'-nesting
and bird music. I11 the seventeen or more years during which
the reviewer searched the woods, coppices, lanes, and marshy
levels of Kent, the County became greatly endeared to him. Of
the authors referred to in the present book one or two spring from
the shadows of the past: one remembers the first French Partridge
nest discovered in the Rainham Woods and how the companion
of that day would not hear of the removal of an egg or two for
one's collection, yet smashed the whole nestful because forsooth
i( these birds spoil sport, by running before the dogs." What
barbarities have not been excused in the name of sport! A day
out with Edw. Bartlett, then of the Maidstone Museum, is a much
more pleasing memory, though I believe unproductive of spoil.

Correspondence.
A book which not only instructs but revives the memory
of summer pleasures is always delightful, and few books fulfil
these conditions more perfectly than Dr. Ticehurst s . moreover,
so far as accuracy and thoroughness are conceined his name is a
sufficient guarantee. A. G. B.
CORRESPONDENCE, NOTES, ETC.
THE SHAM A AS A PET.
After reading Mr. A. Denman's most interesting obituary article on
poor " George" the Hangnest at the Zoo, of whom I had an affectionate
remembrance I felt I must say a few words on Shama, as in so many
ways those I have been fortunate enough to have as pets and friends, have
been so like Mr. Denman's descriptions of the Hangnests, and I think
really make even more charming companions than the latter on account of
their lovely song. I think Shamas have, if anything, a more marked
character than Hangnests, though I won't say a nicer one, but mine have
all shown their likes and dislikes in such a determined manner, no one
could be in any doubt as to what they wanted.
The Shama I have at present is called " Bobby." His intelligence is
remarkable in so much that if in a good temper he will always sing to
order. As George " the Hangnest, he sits on the hand, or lies flat in
it, and holding a piece of your finger in his beak, will sing his lovely song
to you. But, and there are many " huts," if he dislikes the room he is
brought into or the people are those he doesn't like, nothing will make him
sing a note, neither will lie ever accept a mealworm, or what he is equally
fond of, a pinolia nut. He has the greatest dislike to bare feet, and should
he be flying loose in the room in the early morning, will attack one's toes
viciously. His pecks are not sufficiently severe to hurt, and I regret to say-
lie will treat his wife, if allowed near enough, in the same way as toes !
The variety of notes in a Sliama's songs are marvellous, his powers of
imitation are enormous, he can copy a dog barking, a Canary singing, Rooks
cawing, all with the greatest ease. His nature is intensely jealous; the
reflection of himself in a looking glass makes him furious, and with tail
very flat down and wings drooped, he shouts all his stanzas of song in
succession, mixed with fierce pecks at himself.
The great fault in Sliama's natures is their sulkiness. Should the
cage be put into a room they don't know, sometimes as long as two days
may elapse before a note will be uttered ; at the same time I really think
these are the most attractive of birds, and certainly equal the Hangnest in
E. Warren Vernon.

Cannot Mr. Temple go one step farther, and tell ns how to sex
the young and immature Black-clieeked Lovebirds ? Others besides myself
have met with difficulty here. I have found the iris to vary in colour,
possibly in accordance with the age of the individual, quite a [number of
different shades of brown appearing.
Moreover, perhaps as a result of our climate, some if not all of the old
females have lost the black, and have assumed a rich rather deep brown-red
iris. At present confusion rather than rule seems to prevail. Can Mr.
Temple produce order out of chaos ?

LONGEVITY OF PINTAILED SANDGROUSE.
Sir,--T he recent death of an old female Pintailed Sandgrouse which
I first got in 1892 is, I think, of sufficient interest to be recorded in the
Avicultural Magazine. The Sandgrouse in question, which was one of four

<bodyText confidence="0.964382894736842" page_id="58072513"  page_num="133" year="" vol="">
purchased from Pring, a bird dealer who used to carry on business in the
Brompton Road, was of the Eastern race, Pleroclums alchatus. She paired
and nested in 1893, and bred regularly, rearing her young ones annually
with one or two exceptions until three years ago. Then for two years she
laid infertile eggs, and this last summer she did not lay, but she moulted
out every feather and then began to fail, and died apparently of old age.
Which it well might be, for she lived in confinement seventeen years and
was certainly at least eighteen years old. She was the means of the discover)&apos;
of the extraordinary breeding habits of the .Sandgrouse. That a bird that leads
the life of a Sandgrouse should survive and thrive all these years in con-
finement in a climate such as ours seems to me marvellous. Nothing can be
more different, and one almost wonders what might be the length of life
of these birds in a purely natural state.
She survived four husbands, the last, her own son unfortunately, still
survives her. She lived in an entirely open unheated aviary always, but
with good shelter from wet, and got all available sun. I may add that with
other food she had practically as much hemp seed and maw seed as she
liked, and the latter was her principal and favourite food !

BREEDING WHYDAHS,
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.981210166666666" page_id="58072514"  page_num="134" year="" vol="">
Sir, _i notice in Mr. Teschemaker's most interesting and instructive
article on the nesting of the Giant Wliydali, that he says One of our
members has this season successfully reared young from both the Pintailed
and the Red-collared Whydahs, and, inasmuch as the first indication that
breeding was going on was the actual appearance of the young, it is evident
that the parents received no assistance from their owner.
It is extremely unfortunate that the breeding of the Pintailed
Wliydali was not observed when we remember that Mr. Austin Roberts
{Jour. S. Afr. Om. Un., 2nd ser., Vol. I, pp. 9-u) expressed his belief that
it was parasitic upon various Waxbills, not building any proper nest of its
own and laying pure white eggs, whereas the late Mr. Stark had described
its nest of the typical Wliydali type with the grasses to which it was
attached tied together over it so as to conceal it, aud Captain Shelley had
described the egg as spotted like those of other Whydahs. If, however, no
Waxbills were present in the aviary in which the Whydahs were bred the
only suggestion ofMr. Roberts' which now remains to be disproved is the
character of the eggs.
I don't and never did believe in the parasitic habit of Vidua principalis
myself, as will be seen by my article ( Avic. Mag., 2nd ser., Vol. VI., pp, 121,
122), but one likes one's convictions to be supported by pioof.

HYBRID GRASS-FINCHES.
Sir,_ Mr. Astley's hybrids between the Crimson and Star-
finclies are very interesting on account of their perfectly intermediate
character, which indicates their close affinity. I have long suspected that
those two birds were related, in spite of the fact that Bathilda somewhat
reminds one of Tcznioopygia. The outline, face mark of the male and the
colouring of the tail, as well as the song, remind one more or less of
Neochmia ; both were, for along time, confounded with the Waxbills.

I. BRITISH BIRDS.
By Allen Silvek.
Irrespective of limit classes, this division of the Show
contained about 590 birds. These, almost without exception
were first-rate examples of their kind from an exhibitor's point
cf view, and when one takes into consideration the ripe age and
splendid appearance of many of them one cannot help reminding
iviculturists proper of the great pains taken by their owners in
jetting them up to " concert pitch " ; for to-day, slightly dis-
irranged or frayed feathers, faulty feet, or any appearance of
mfitness will prevent a bird from getting near the top.
Leaving out the more familiar crosses between Gold-
inches, Linnets, Siskins, Greenfinches, Twites and Serums
anarius var. dom., it is worth while to allude to the fact that
here were no less than 12 Canary-Bullfinch, 2 Linnet-Bullfinch,
: Redpoll-Bullfinch, 10 Goldfinch-Bullfinch, 9 Greenfinch-Bull-
inch Hybrids on view, and in the A.O.V. Hybrid Class were to
)e seen: 2 Goldfinch-Siskin, 2 Goldfinch-Linnet, 6 Goldfinch-
greenfinch, 2 Redpoll-Goldfinch, 1 Siskin-Linnet, 3 Redpoll-
jreenfinch and 1 Brambling-Chaffinch Hybrids.
Two points of interest strike the aviculturist here, namely,
hat with Bullfinch crosses successful issue has at present occurred
mly when the female parent is a Bullfinch, the male of this
pecies usually proving useless as a fertilizing agent, and,
econdly, the fact that, almost without exception, Canary crosses
veil when bred from perfectly clear, i.e. unmarked yellow or buff
anaries (paired to a finch that possesses no line-like markings

in its plumage) seldom fail to exhibit in a marked degree these
line-like markings of the original wild Serin on their flanks
and mantles. With regard to the Finch-like birds, the classes
for Bullfinches contained 41 males and 16 females; that for
Goldfinches made up a brave array of 41 birds. The Linnets
numbered 41, the Chaffinches 22, the Bramblefinches 23, Lesser
Redpolls 20, Twites 9, Siskins 19, Greenfinches 25, Hawfinches 16,
Yellow Buntings 19, and the A. O. Species of Bunting Class
contained fifteen birds, including one example of Emberiza
melanocephala and a Meadow Bunting (E. cia), otherwise the
Class consisted of one Cirl, three Snow, one Lapland, three Corn
and five Reed Buntings. The Blackbird Class contained twelve
birds ; the Thrush Class thirteen, and that for Starlings thirteen
birds and in the small Crow Class were to be seen four Choughs,
two Jays and only one Magpie.
Among the " Pied, Albino, or Pare Feathered" birds were
two White Sparrows, one Pied and one White Linnet, one White
Jackdaw, a White, a Pied, and a Cinnamon Blackbird, one Cinna-
mon Sparrow, one Cinnamon Redpoll, one Cinnamon Green-
finch, a Silver Starling and a Reed Bunting practically white,
only marred by a few dark feathers. The Nightingale and
Blackcap Class consisted mostly of Blackcaps, only two or three
of the former birds competing, and they not up to the usual
standard, making in all nine birds. The Any Species of Lark or
Pipit Class contained some remarkable examples of Alauda
arve?isis and some Shorelarks and Tree Pipits. I11 the Class for
A.O.S. Small Resident birds were two Bearded Reedlings, and a
Tree Creeper, which, with the other birds, made up the number to
eight. In the Class for A. O. Species Migratory Birds about the
size of a Wheatear, were two splendid Black Redstarts, a Greater
Whitetliroat, a Yellow Wagtail, a Two-barred Crossbill (which
was British-taken) and a good Grasshopper Warbler, which won
premier honours. This class included Seed-eaters not otlieiwise
classified, and consequently admitted the Two-barred Crossbill,
which, by the way, was a cage-moulted male in '' old gold diess
tastefully staged and an interesting exhibit. Among the birds
competing in the A. O. Species Class larger than a Wheatear,
seed-eating or otherwise, not previously classified, weie two

tails of the pied, white and grey species were practically absent
from the Show this season. Generally speaking the section was
well supported otherwise, and although this branch of bird-keep-
ing does not fit in with our requirements as a Society, I should
like to point out that exhibitors do not keep birds in the small
cages they aie exhibited in. The very perfect condition and
robust health of the majority of them alone confirms this, and I
can assure the members of the Avicultural Society that the care,
labour, and time expended in keeping birds in what is termed
peifect feathei would be tiresome to most of us ; moreover so
accustomed to journeys and show cages do old " champions "
become that they behave in the manner comparable with that of
a trained circus horse.
II. PARROTvS.
By David Skth-Smith, F.Z.S., M.B.O.U.
I he three classes of Parrots at the recent Show, although
perhaps not above the average as regards number of entries,
were certainly very far above so far as the rarity of the species
was concerned. It is doubtful indeed whether such a choice
collection has ever before been seen upon the show bench. Some
exhibitors had sent birds which they may excusably have thought
could hardly be beaten, but when they appeared in the arena
they had to contend with such rarities as had never been seen at
the Palace or elsewhere, and thus ordinary birds, however good,
stood no chance.
The first class, " Budgerigars, Lovebirds, and Hanging
Pairots, contained nothing really new. Mr. Townsend's Blue-
crowned Loriculus was a gem, in perfect adult plumage, and well
deseived its first prize. The Black-cheeked Lovebirds, of which
a paii was shown, although so very rare a short time ago, have
produced their kind so freely of late that they are now common.
Mr. Millsum entered a pair of Johnstone's Lorikeets in this class,
where, had they appeared they would have been disqualified, but

he thought better of it and exhibited them in the next, which
consisted of all species of Parrakeets other than those comprised
in the first class. This class is generally attractive, but on this
occasion was much more so than usual, hirst came a Stella
Lorikeet ( Charmosyna stellae), one of those exquisite cieatuies
with which Nature has so richly endowed New Guinea. It
reminds one somewhat of a small Purple-capped Lory with
two very long, tapering tail-feathers, and took special foi best
foreign bird in the ,Sliow. The present writer was privileged
to see several of these lovely Lorikeets on their anival in Eng-
land, and an extraordinarily fine sight they presented. Equally
interesting, though less brilliant in hue, were Mr. Millsum's pair
of Trichoglossus johnstoniae, the little Lorikeets from high up in
the mountains of Mindanao, from whence Mr. Goodfellow brought
the species to light. They very well deserved their second prize.
Mr. L. W. Hawkins took the third prize with a very good
Botirke's Parrakeet, a rare species; while Mr. Millsum s pair of
Golden-shoulders, which came fourth, might have been higher
had they been in better condition; they showed too clearly the
result of recent importation. This latter species is perhaps the
most attractive of the lovely genus Psephotus , and, as several
pairs have been imported of late, we may hope to hear of its
having bred in captivity before long.
Another delightful bird was the Elegant Parrakeet shown
by Mr. Maxwell. It did not obtain a card, evidently through the
Judge's eagle eyes having detected the absence of a toe-nail.
Pennants, Barnards, a King, a Redrump, a Swainson's, a Rosella
and a hybrid Pennant, completed the class.
The class for the larger Parrots was headed by a very good
Hawk-headed, shown by Mr. Beaty, while a nice Meyer s belong-
ing to the Rev. G. H. Raynor came second ; a Blue and Yellow
Macaw, sent by Mr. Stubbings, came third, and a very good Grey,
owned by Mrs. Bury, fourth.
A very nice Black-headed Caique (Mr. Hawkins) was
awarded a " V.H.C." card, an Eclectus " H.C." (Mr. W. Smith)
and a Senegal Parrot (Miss Bland) was " Commended."

III. FOREIGN BIRDS OTHER THAN PARROTS.
By Frank Finn, B.A., F.Z.S., M.B.O.U.
Although the entry in this section, which I had the honour
of judging, was not very large, there were, as usual some ex-
ceedingly good birds on view, especially among the soft-bills.
In the class for the common small finches the first prize went to
a very perfect Diamond Sparrow, excellent in colour and very
steady, shown by Mr. F. Howe ; second were the same gentle-
man's St. Helena Waxbills, an exquisitely perfect pair; Mr. S.
Beaty's Nutmeg finches, third, were very well shown, though
one had rather overgrown leg-scales ; they were of the Indian
race or species, with black lacing below, not of the much less
handsome variety from further Fast, with the double brown
lacing. Fourth went to Mr. Townsend's beautiful pair of Orange-
breasted or Zebra Waxbills, which might have stood higher had
not some of the cock's flights in one wing been only growing;
the other pair of this species, though also fine, did not strike me
as so good on the whole, and so took v.H.C. The Diamond
Sparrow which was highly commended was a nice bird, but less
good in colour than its rival which took first. "Commended"
went to a pair of white Javas, which would have stood higher
had not one had a few foul feathers and a broken tail.
In the class for rarer small finches, after considerable hesi-
tation, I gave first to Mr. Maxwell's beautiful pair of Violet-
eared Waxbills ; the second prize bird, Mr. F. Howe's Melba
Waxbill, a lovely, steady specimen, running them very close.
Only one of Mr. O. Millsum's Tricoloured Parrot finches turned
out, and took third; it might have been steadier with much
advantage. Dr. Hetley's Bicheno finches, which were fourth,
were an absolutely perfect pair. The same gentleman's Gouldian
finches were v.H.C., their condition not being equal to that of the
Bicheno's. Mr. C. T. Maxwell's Black-cheeked Waxbill would
have got something much better than h.C. had it not been look-
ing rather thick when I judged it. The species is not common,
and, for the benefit of those who do not know it, I may say it is
very like the St. Helena Waxbill, but has a black face and the
beak dark, not red. Messrs. Ford &amp; Son's Paradise Whydah
well deserved its " commended " card, but could not stand higher

among such company ; its condition was excellent. A Painted
Finch was in this class, but looked too out of condition for notice.
In the last Finch class, for Grosbeaks, True Finches, and
Buntings, Mr. C. T. Maxwell's perfect Painted Finch had hard
luck in not being noticed ; it should have gone in the previous
class, where I should have given it first. A11 English Greenfinch
had also got in this class by some queer mistake, in entering, I
suppose.
The first-prize birds here were new to the show bench, as
far as I know; they were exhibited by Mrs. E. Galloway, and
were a fine pair of Brown-shouldered Blue Grosbeaks (Guiraca
coerulea ), in perfect feather but very wild at judging-time. Mr.
Hamlyn had a small consignment of this species, which conies
from Southern North America, last year, and there is one at the
Zoo. This is, however, ever a lumpy-looking bird like a Green-
finch, whereas the show pair were smart and active like Chaf-
finches, and kept the head-feathers up in a semi-crest in the same
way. The cock, like the Zoo bird, had the blue of the plumage
dulled by the brownish edges to the feathers, evidently a winter
plumage, since they only appeared in the Zoo specimen after the
autumn moult. I11 summer, however, this species is much
brighter than the Brazilian Blue Grosbeak, being a rich brignt
violet blue, so that it could be distinguished even without the
larger size and chestnut wing-coverts. The hen is coloured and
marked much like a hen Sparrow, but of a richer brown ; I had
not seen a specimen of this sex before, and the pair attracted
much admiring attention from the aviculturists present. Second
prize went to a nice little Hooded or Red Siskin, shown by Mr.
C. T. Maxwell ; and third to to a really exquisite Pine Grosbeak,
in full red colour, shown by Mr. J. Frostick ; a nice Cape Sparrow,
shown by Mr. L. J. Arriglii, was fourth ; v.H.C. and H.c. went to
a pair of White-throated Finches and a Virginian Cardinal
respectively, neither of them in such perfect feather as the rest
of the class, even had they been as rare.
The class for Tanagers contained only seven entries, all in
wonderful trim and a great attraction. First went to Mr. C. T.
Maxwell's Rufous-tliroated, and second to Mr. W. H. Pickles'
Black-throated ; this was the same order I gave these two birds

when judging at Westminster the year before last. The Black-
throated, being a Calliste , scores in brilliancy of colour, but the
Rufous-throated ( Glossiptila ruficollis ), a species confined to
Jamaica, is of a more unusual type. ( See frontispiece). This
specimen is, I believe, the first of its kind imported ; I identified
it at Mr. Hamlyn's in its dull immature plumage, which resem-
bles that of the female. Mr. J. H. Harrison's splendid pair of
Maroon Tanagers, one of Mr. K. W. Harper's importations, stood
third, while Mr. S. M. Townsend's Magpie Tanager was fourth.
A Tri-coloured Tanager, shown by Mr. S. Beaty, won v.h.C. ; it
was to my mind the most beautiful bird in the class, but the
rarity of the others prevented a higher award to it. h.C. went to
an Archbishop Tanager, though this entry was marked " Superb "
on the Catalogue ; it was perfect, but for a stiff hind-toe, the only
defect of any bird in this lot.
It was no easy matter to pass by Mr. S. M. Townsend's
exquisite Yellow-winged Sugar-bird in the next class, for Sugar-
birds, Honey-eaters, Zosterops, Bulbuls and Sun-birds, and give
the first place to the Black-headed Sugar-bird shown by Mr. J. H.
Harrison, but the latter was, I think, certainly the rarer, and in
perfect condition. The Yellow-winged, however, might almost
have been called " pluperfect" in that respect, and was more
admired by the public than any bird in the show ; I think cer-
tainly that from the point of view of beauty alone it was the best
of any there, to my way of thinking. Beauty, however, is a
matter of taste, while rarity is positive ; that is why I favour the
latter, and also I think novelties should be given a chance. Mr.
C. T. Maxwell took third with a very nice hen Sugar-bird of the
Black-headed species ; this sex, it may be observed, is of a grass-
or leaf-green throughout, not the silky sea-green of the cock, and
has no black upon the head. Another cock Black-headed, shown
by Mr. Millsum, was in this class, and took v.h.C. ; its condition
was not equal to that of the others, and the fourth prize bird, an
otherwise good Gold-fronted Green Bulbul, had some flights
missing. Although small, this class was on the whole good, but
not better than the next, for all species not comprised in the
above, and smaller than the King Bird of Paradise. Here Mr. S.
Beaty's Tevaillant's Barbet, in good form, took first, and attracted

much attention from the public ; I think, however, that this award
of mine is distinctly open to criticism, and that I ought to have
wrong-classed this bird as too big. As I did not think of this
at the time, however, it deserved to stand highest in the class,
although the second prize bird, Mr. C. T. Maxwell's Great-billed
Flycatcher was also in perfect form, though a harder bird to keep
in condition. But then we have Flycatchers in this country, and
no Barbets, so the less familiar type should score here. This
Great-billed Flycatcher (Cyornis magnirostris )--which has not a
noticeably big bill, by the way--is about the size of our common
Flycatcher, and of a subdued blue above and pale chestnut below.
It is an Indian bird, but I never saw it alive in India.
The third prize went to Mr. S. M e Townsend's White-
capped Redstart, a bird I have seen both wild and in captivity in
India ; although called a Redstart in books, it has not the lateral

quivering motion of the tail characteristic of those birds, but
moves it up and down like a Chat. Mr. J. H. Harrison's beautiful
oair of Silver-eared Mesias, another of Mr. Harper's importations,
ook fourth, and the same gentleman scored a v.h.C. with an
squally perfect Blue-winged Siva. A rather unusual exhibit,
shown by Mr. H. Lewis, was a pair of Chinese Painted Quail, a

comprised in the above, larger than and including the King Bird

far from " steady," easily took first. Second went to a Bengal
Pitta, a good tame bird, but, like most of these Pittas I have seen,
not so sleek as could be wished; it was shown by Mr. C. Cushny.
Mr. Maxwell's Lanceolated Jay took third; it had a few quills
missing, but this was because it had escaped and had to be re-
captured previous to judging. Fourth was a Glossy Starling, of
a red-eyed species unknown to me, in perfect form, shown by
Mr. Townsend. I was surprised to find my old Indian friend,
the Pied Mynah, in the Show, and no one seemed to have seen it
on the bench before ; in fact, it is very rarely imported, though
one of the commonest birds in India. Accordingly, I felt justified
in giving it a v.h.C., though it was not very steady, and not so
sleek as I could have wished. It was shown by Mr. C. Cushny.
Mr. Otto Puck's Common Hangnest took h.c. --a good bird, but
over-matched by its competitors, and the same gentleman's Blue-
cheeked Barbet was "commended " ; I should have put it above
his other exhibit if its tail had not needed a wash and if one of
its quills had not stuck out.
As I feel deeply gratified by being honoured by an invita-
tion to judge at the greatest avicultural fixture of the world, I
hope exhibitors will pardon some criticisms which suggest
themselves. One is, that too many birds are put on the bench
before they are really ready--not sleek or steady enough ; another
is that pairs are shown. I do not see why this should be done;
it has been given up long ago in the case of pigeons, and more
recently in that of fancy waterfowl, and often one bird of a pair
drags down, by reason of some imperfection, a superior partner,
as happened on the present occasion more than once. If I had a
good pair of birds to show I should send them out separately, or
keep the hen at home altogether, with a view to future breeding.
Furthermore, I strongly object to the classification now in
vogue, which is very hard on the exhibitor, who may not be well
up in scientific matters ; and I think foreign birds should be
classified on size and feeding habits, due provision being made
for classes for the very common species. It is the comparative
lack of such provision, to my mind, which is responsible for
the very poor show the foreign birds present, as far as numbers
go, alongside the British section.

By W. E. Teschemaker, B.A.
The Blackcap is far and away the hardiest of our Warblers--
1 fact it stands in a class by itself. There can be no doubt that
is want of insect food and not delicacy of constitution that
nnpells it to leave our shores in autumn.
A few individuals remain in Devonshire and Cornwall
/ery winter, and as a rule they seem to do well. In a sheltered
.itdoor aviary it thrives ; in fact the only male I have kept this
inter has sung every morning, rain or shine. All our other
Warblers appear to me to do much better in a heated aviary. I
n quite aware that some of our members are able to show good
suits in cold aviaries, as, for instance, Mr. R. Suggitt, who tells
e that his Whitethroats, etc., do quite well in an outdoor aviary
itli a good snug shelter even in Yorkshire. One of the first
ings we learn in aviculture, however, is that what one man can
) another finds impossible and I can only say that they do not
) as well under these conditions with me. By the use of
tificial heat, however, I find I can get quite good results and
is winter, amongst a mixed lot of Garden Warblers, White-
iroats, Nightingales, Pied and Spotted Flycatchers, Blackstarts
id one Dartford Warbler, I have only had three deaths, in each
.se due to accident, in spite of the complete breakdown of the
/e bait commissariat. On the other hand in a cold aviary I lost
beautiful pair of White Wagtails, though this was probably due
liefly to the want of insect-food.
Just as the Blackcap is by far the hardiest of the Warblers
!* it is, I think, very much the least difficult to breed. The fact
at our member, Mr. Suggitt, reared a fine brood (only a fort-
gilt after I succeeded) shows that the experiment is quite a
asible one ; on the other hand the fact that both he and I
id, I think, other aviculturists also have had many failures
lows that the Blackcap is not bred every day. I was rather
nused the other day to come across the following paragraph
ritten by the late Dr. W. T. Greene :--" Hand-reared speci-
ens of this species will breed in a cage or aviary as freely as

Canaries, making their compact, but not heavy, nest of hay in a
bush if there is one at their disposal or, lacking that, in an
ordinary nest-basket. . . . The different pieces are very firmly
interwoven, so that it really requires an effort to separate.
The elastic nest of the Blackcap may often be found in the spring
as firm and compact as when the little builders first put it together
nearly twelve months before. . . . The Blackcap, like the
Nightingale, is an amiable little creature and never interferes
with any other bird."
Now I do not for one moment say that the Blackcap has
not been bred--indeed I think it very likely--but I do say that I
feel almost sure that Dr. Greene did not breed it himself because
he describes it as peaceable. This is just the sort of nonsense that
anyone who knows our silky little Blackcap only as a cage-bird
would write, whereas anyone who has had experience of the
species when actually engaged in breeding will I am sure agree
with me that for concentrated ferocity it has no equal among
British insectivorous birds. Can anyone confirm Dr. Greene's
observation as to the durability of the Blackcap's nest? It is
well known to be the flimsiest of all British birds' nests and 1
have certainly never noticed that it was remarkable for durability
the only one I ever dissected almost fell to pieces. It the Black-
cap can be bred as " freely as the Canary " why do we take sc
much trouble to catch them and meat them off? One woulc
think that domesticated Blackcaps would be advertised at sc
much " per stick." I fear the breeding of Blackcaps in cages
must have become a lost art since Dr. Greene's time. I agree witl
Dr. Greene that there is 110 difficulty in obtaining nests, eggs anc
young from this species and probably this is all that he meant tc
convey when he described it as " breeding freely." The difficult)
is in rearing the young, and, if this has been done, I can 011b
once more invite those who have been successful to throw asid&amp;lt;
their natural modesty and to come forward and let us hear ai
about it, because all my efforts to discover their identity hav&amp;lt;
hitherto proved unavailing.
And now let me see if I can find anything of interest t&amp;lt;
relate regarding my own efforts to breed S. atncapilla.
Up to 1905 I only kept males of this species for their song

ut in that year I had a pair which built a nest but did not
pparently lay : I think the female was a very old bird. I11 that
ame summer I caught a couple of young Blackcaps which had
een bred in my garden and which proved to be both females.
I11 1906, therefore, I had an old male and two young
imales. When the spring came round and the hawthorn began
:&gt; look green, I heard the cock Blackcap uttering a peculiar note :
1: was a dissyllable and sounded like the word 11 e-jus" or perhaps
eja ." At the time I did not understand what it meant but I
ave since had cause to know it well ; it should be a sort of red
ag to the aviculturist, for it is the war-cry of the Blackcap, and
means battle, murder and sudden death. Now I had a pair of
larden Warblers in the same aviary and throughout the win-
sr they had been the best of friends with the Blackcaps. But
ow the male Blackcap began to stealthily pursue the Garden
Warblers: from bush to bush he followed them and all day long
e kept them on the move, ever uttering his war-cry. There was
deadly, cold-blooded tenacity of purpose about his movements :
e never openly attacked them but, wherever they went, the
lackcap was close 011 their track. One morning I found the
lale Garden Warbler on the ground : it was warm, but it was
ead--yes, dead as New Zealand Mutton. A day or two later I
icked up the female ; she too had reached that bourne whence
o traveller returns. I now became gravely suspicious. I
^called the strange pursuit of the Blackcap and I could not
elp comparing it with the methods of the dreaded Mafia , whose
gents follow their victim night and day until in some lonely
pot they spring upon him and drive the stiletto deep into his
eart.
This "amiable little creature" (to quote Dr. Greene) now
lrned his attention to one of the young hens : in a few days she
)o was lying stiff and stark. He now paired with the other
miale and built a nest in a low privet. I will continue the story
y an extract from a paper I contributed to Bird Notes, written
'hi 1 st the circumstances were fresh in my mind. " The nest was
lie of the frailest structures I ever saw, resembling the frame-
&apos;ork of a nest just commenced. Unfortunately the Chingolo
ong-Sparrows selected the same time for nesting again and

Mr. W. E. Teschemakek,
the most furious conflicts took place. As I had set my heart on
breeding the Chingolos I removed the cock Blackcap. The lien
sat very steadily on three eggs, and I thought it quite possible
she might rear the young single-handed if well supplied with
insect food. The day after she hatched I went out soon after
daybreak to see how matters were progressing. A glance was
sufficient to show me that success was not to be mine. The bird
absolutely refused to feed with any insects I supplied, and was
I11 two davs all
busily engaged in searching every leaf. As soon as she found
anything she took it at once to the young birds ; in the mean-
time the young were getting completely chilled
were dead."
As mentioned above, I removed the cock Blackcap and
confined the " amiable little creature" in a cage by himself in the
bird-room. And now a strange thing happened. I gave him a
few mealworms to console him for the loss of his wife and family,
The bird, however, did not seem in the least inclined to pine
He danced about the cage and sang brilliantly and almost con-
tinuously --but he did not eat. To test this, I counted out a
certain number of mealworms and placed them in one receptacle
and in another I placed a section of banana, cleanly cut with a
knife, so as to show the slightest peck. Will it be believed that,
for two days, he eat literally nothing, and on the third, only a few
mealworms? Yet, after a fast which would indubitably have
killed any small insectivorous bird under normal co?iditio?is , he
was obviously perfectly well ; he gradually returned to hi
ordinary diet and lived another two years in captivity. The
bird was clearly in one of those singular conditions of me?itcu
exaltation in which the body will perform the most extraordinary
feats of energy and endurance. This is not quite such a common
place observation as it may appear, because it helps us to under-
stand how the smaller migrants perform those wonderful anc
arduous flights across the open sea, often in the teeth of adverse
winds. Without doubt it is under the stress of an overmastering
and transcendental emotion, which the human mind cannot fully
comprehend, that the tiny Golden-crested Wren launches itsel
on that long and arduous flight across the stormy waters of the
North Sea.

he Swallows find plenty of insect food in the upper strata of
he air, and that Hawks and Owls dine en route on their fellow-
uigrants, but the above observation suggests, I think, the
implest explanation of all, namely, that under conditions of
uental excitement they do not require any food.
Some time since I said in our Magazine that I thought the
tudy of British birds in aviaries was more interesting than the
tudy of foreigners. Dr. Butler took the opposite view, namely,
hat the lives of our common birds were so well known that it
vas more useful to study foreign birds. I wonder if any definite
&gt;roof of the above fact has been previously adduced. It is quite
ikely that similar observations have been made and have escaped
ny notice, but, should mine prove to be original, then I think it
pill be admitted that the aviarist can glean useful scraps of
nformation even about our most common species.
I now come to 1908, in which season I confined the same
lale and female Blackcaps in a breeding pen, in view of the
xtraordinary pugnacity of the species. Again the male "sang
f love and desire" (as the old German song runs): again a nest
/as built but, just before the eggs should have appeared, another
trailge thing happened. I watched the male one day perched
n a bending spray, his throat swelling, every feather quivering
htli the energy of his song -- but no song was heard. Yes, the
inger was dumb : his voice was gone for ever ! For several days
le bird seemed to refuse to recognize the fact: lie tried per-
istently to sing. Then he gave it up and in a few days he was
ead. Was his heart broken ? Who shall say ? Personally I
link it was simply old age, for he had been in my possession
&gt;ur years and may have been an old bird when I got him.
At the commencement of 1909 I had four male and two
male Blackcaps, all of which lived peaceably together until the
iring came, when I once again heard the war-cry. This time
lere was a free fight--all against all--and the females fought as
wagely as the males. Result: one male killed, another had a
oken leg, and a third was slightly damaged. " Amiable little
eatures"! However, the remaining male and two females
ttled down very comfortably together: the male paired with
)th females, and both the latter built and laid, showing that the

Blackcap (like many other Passerine species) is an occasional
polygamist. The male was always ready to assist in incubating
the eggs, and proved a most devoted husband and father. I
spoilt the chances of one nest by various experiments, but from
the other three young flew, or I should say scrambled, on 13th
July, for the young of this species leave the nest befoie they can
fly. It was very curious to see them crawling, and worming
their way about amongst the thick foliage, and I cannot help
thinking that young birds at this period of their development
give us a glimpse of the Lizard-like animals from which they are
descended. The adept manner in which they climb up per-
pendicular surfaces by the aid of their sharp claws with the
slightest possible assistance from their wings is very remarkable.
Although the young Blackcaps seemed so defenceless I had the
greatest possible difficulty in catching one for the purpose of
inspection. It was dark brownish-grey on the head and back,
flights brown; abdomen white. By the 21st the crown had
assumed a distinct reddish-brown shade. O11 the 31st July one
young bird was showing two black leathers 011 the crown. I have
recorded not a few evil deeds on the part of my Blackcaps, but
the worst is to come. O11 2nd Aug. the adult male murdered his
own son just because he was getting a black cap and had com-
menced to warble a little ! " Amiable little creature " ! I sent
the victim to Mr. W. T. Page for inspection, and he pronounced
it a fine specimen. The young females I ringed and released
about a month later, hoping that they might give me a look up
in the following spring.
One word about the rearing of these young Blackcaps. I
attributed my failures with one or two previous broods (not nieii-
tioned in these notes) to the use of gentles, so 011 this occasion I
withheld all gentles for the first ten days after hatching and was
inclined to attribute the result to this policy. Howevei, healing
that Mr. Suggitt had reared his on gentles alone I. wrote to him
for further information and append his reply: " The staple food
of my Blackcaps when rearing the young consisted of gentles.
I gave the parents a few spiders occasionally and branches ol
infested trees; you, however, know what this means in a mixed
collection with a dozen other Warblers, not to mention Waxbills,

-tc., all of which are fond of Aphis. The Blackcaps of course
caught a few insects, but I am satisfied that quite 90 % of the
food given to the young was gentles for the first 14 days."
A good deal of misconception appears to exist as to the
date at which young males assume the black cap, and Bechstein
recommends drawing a few feathers from the crown, in which
:ase they would be replaced by black ones and so show the sex.
As I have shown, the black feathers appear on the crown at quite
in early date, and I feel sure that this is normal, because last
Dctober I examined quite one hundred male Blackcaps which
lad been caught on migration and imported, and not one had
iny brown on the head, although a large proportion of them
must have been young birds of the year.
Although we only see Blackcaps singly in this country,
hey pass through the South of Europe during migration in large
lights. Years ago, in an olive wood, looking down on the
)eautiful Cote d' Azur, I saw one such migration and shall
lever forget it. It was about the iotli March and the birds had
ust landed after their passage across the Mediterranean. Every
ree was full of Blackcaps--all males in full breeding plumage.
Phey flitted silently from tree to tree, not pausing to look for food,
&gt;ut pressing 011 with set purpose 011 their long journey north-
vards. There must have been hundreds of Blackcaps in that
dive wood.

Mr. D. Seth-Smith,
It was nearing the date of my departure and I was ex-
tremely busy with my collection, which now numbered several
hundred animals, the boxing up of which for an eight weeks
voyage was no light undertaking. My excellent fiiend, Mr.
S. Le Souef, was also very much occupied in preparation for
his wedding and honeymoon trip to Europe. We both decided
however that we would snatch a week-end and take a trip to
Stanwell Park, which my friend knew well, and described to me
as a rich field for bird observation.
On the evening of April 4th we took train on the Great
Southern Railway for Stanwell Park Station, which we reached
long after dark. We found most excellent accommodation at a
delightfully comfortable boarding house. I11 the morning I woke
early and heard the song and call-notes of innumerable birds,
for within a stone's-throw of my window the thick eucalyptus
bush, interspersed with tree ferns, commenced. We were at
the foot of high hills, all thickly timbered, and below us, within
a short distance, lay the Pacific Ocean. I heard many birds
which I had got to know well, and several whose notes were
unfamiliar. The Lyre Bird was distinctly lieaid, though it is
far less common here than in National Park. I he Coach-Whip
Bird repeatedly endeavoured to deceive us by its imitation of a
stock-driver's whip.
We started out early and made for the rocky bed of a
stream, which at this time was almost dried up, though, after
rains, it is converted into a rushing torrent down the hill-side.
The first birds we met with were a party of Blue wrens,
some seven or eight in number, in a large clump of the intro-
duced blackberry; all in undress plumage. Australian Waxbills
(.EEgintha temporalis) simply swarmed in some low bushes at
the back of the house, while the commoner Honeyeaters and
Yellow-Tails were often seen.
We climbed up the hill-side in the bed of the stream,
jumping and climbing from boulder to boulder. To either side
the ground was covered with magnificent ferns of all kinds,
from the delicate Maiden-hair, to the lovely tree ferns, and the
handsome Palm Seafo?tlna elegans , towering above which came
the lordly forest Eucalyptus.

A little Rock Warbler (Origrna rubricata&apos;) dodged about
under the boulders, flying from under our very feet and dis-
appearing beneath another great stone some yards ahead of us,
repeating the performance as we ascended the gully. I11 a high
tree above we detected the cry of the Grey Crow Shrike (Strepera
cmieicaudata ), and we caught a glimpse of the beautiful Bronze
Cuckoo C Chalcococcyx plagosics ). Yellow-breasted and Dusky
Robins were seen, while the little White-shafted Fantail was
much in evidence.
Rain commenced to fall, and we took shelter under an
immense oveihanging rock. High above our heads we heard
the ciy Wlie-o, whe-o," which my companion immediately
recognised as the note of Black Cockatoos. Rooking up we were
delighted by the sight of a party of these magnificent birds, the
Funeieal, or \ ellow-tailed Cockatoo, (Calyptorhyjichus JunereusJ
flying above our heads. I his is the Kastern representative of the
fine Baudin's or White-tailed Cockatoo, which I had become
quite familiar with in Western Australia.
We slowly retraced our steps down the rocky stream bed,
and found the descent by no means easier than the ascent; so
*flippeiy were the rocks, and so deep were the intervening pools,
:hat on more than one occasion we narrowly escaped a wetting.
In the afternoon we struck out in another direction, takin" r
.lie main road to the Fast, leading from the valley to the summit
of the cliff. Io our left was the wooded hill-side, to our right
lie sea. As we passed through the first belt of timber and low
; crub I had the best view of the Coach-Whip bird that I had had.
Ye heaid the bird ''cracking its whip'' quite close to the road side;
ifter every crack his mate added an answering note. Presently
lie female flew across our path, and a second or two later the
nale appeared on the fence some twenty yards in front of us.

pub 011 the surface of the road descended and snatched up
lis prey, at the same time giving us a most perfect view, his
flack dress and white cheek patches showing out very distinctly
&gt;11 the dusty roadway.
A couple of cock White-throated Thick-heads (Z 3 &apos;achycep hata
&apos;utturalis ) were chasing one another about the branches just

above 11s, their brilliant yellow breasts, black caps and white
throats forming a fine contrast to the grey-green foliage of the
eucalyptus. As the road approached the summit of the hill a
most perfect prospect was presented to our eyes. We were at
the top of a high cliff rising sheer out of the sea, and as we
looked back over the valley the cliffs on the opposite side made
a lovely picture with the waves dashing at their foot; but what
pleased us most was the view obtained of a pair of mighty
White-bellied Sea Eagles gliding 011 motionless wings over the
valley, the bright sunlight lighting up the pure white of their
undersides. We watched them until they weie out of sight, but
could not detect a motion of their pinions.
The only other bird, which I clearly recollect during that
afternoon stroll, was a Butcher-bird (Cvcicticus des i? ucto ?), which
on that occasion struck me as being one of the finest songsters I
had heard since my arrival in Australia. It was perched on the
topmost branch of a dead tree, and its loud flute-like notes,
answered in the distance by a rival, gave a special charm to the
whole country-side.

DUBLIN.
By Major B. R. Horsbrugh.
Although it is well known in Ireland that Dublin boasts
of an excellent collection of waterfowl, it may not be generally
known to the readers of the slvzculturcil Mcigciznie, and I there-
fore send a few notes on the birds to be seen there.
The ornamental water on which they live is by no means
large, and Mr. Kearney, the Superintendent, who is a most
enthusiastic ornithologist, tells me he has many difficulties to
contend with.
First and foremost are the cats; Stephen's Green is in the
centre of a city square and, of course, cats simply swarm, and nc
trapping is allowed ; how the duck manage to do so well I cannoi
imagine. Next, dogs run loose everywhere, and the waterfow
avoid them as best they can. Herring-gulls are great enemies

on the Waterfowl at Stephen&apos;s Green , Dublin.
to the ducklings, but they and rats can be dealt with, and
generally are ; and, lastly, the water is infested with huge eels
which can, and frequently do, take the young ones.
It speaks volumes for the care which Mr. Kearney and his
subordinates lavish on the birds to see the great variety on show,
the condition they are in and the large number of rare birds bred
there.
Some years ago the Board of Public Works, to whom the
collection belongs, obtained a pair of Black-necked Swans (Cygnus
nigricollis)&apos;. the male bird proved to have been rendered sterile by
caponising, and they had the mortification of seeing the female
laying and sitting steadily on infertile eggs. At last, however,
this state of affairs was remedied, a good male was obtained from
the Antwerp Zoological Gardens, and young were reared in 1908
and 1909.
Mr. Kearney tells me that the female Black-neck is apt to
go off the nest with the first one or two eggs that hatch, and to
leave the remaining good eggs to die, which is rather trying.
Black Swans have been kept, and did so well that one year
they reared no less than twelve young ones, but there is only one
bird on the water at present, as during the breeding season this
species is so dreadfully savage to other birds. A breeding pair
)f Black Swans I knew of, on an ornamental water near Dover,
Irowned every young Mallard as soon as it appeared on the water
[his last summer.
Only a few of the most interesting geese are kept, owing
:o the way in which they render the turf unsightly by eating all
;he grass.
The Cereopsis breeds regularly ; but more interesting than
:hey were three Ross's Snow Geese ( Che?i rossii) and three
Lesser White-fronted Geese (Anser erythropus). One of the latter
paired last summer with a Bernicle Goose, and reared two broods
)f one and five young respectively, all of which are still alive and
ully grown. They are exactly intermediate between the two
parents, but not as handsome as either.
Another hybrid was between Bernicle Goose and Bar-
neaded Goose ( Anser i?idicns ), this was also rather ugly but in-
:eresting.

156 On the Waterfowl at Stephe?is Green, Dublin.
There were a pair of hybrid Ruddy Sheldrake ( Casarca
rutilci) and Egyptian Goose (Chenalopex egyptiaca), a cross which
is fairly well known, and extremely savage they are, so much so
in fact that, in spite of the web of one foot only being split up
to stop them swimming well, they have to be shut up away from
the other fowl during the breeding season.
Other hybrid Sheldrake were between the Ruddy and Aus-
tralian and Ruddy and New Zealand Sheldrake. There were the
European Sheldrake ( Tadorna cornuta ), Mallard, Wigeon, Com-
mon Teal and Garganey, several pairs of Japanese Teal ( Querque -
dula formosa ), some Yellow-billed Teal (Q. ftavirostrisf), a little
bird from S. America, which much resembles the Yellow-billed
Duck ( Anas undulata ) of S. Africa, in miniature, and which
breeds freely.
Then there were Pochard ( Nyroca ferina&apos;). Red-crested
Pochard (. Nett a mfina ), White-eyed Duck ( Nyroca ferruginea ),
Tufted Duck (N. cristata) and some lovely old Scaups and some
Golden-eyes. Several Rosy-billed Duck ( Metopiajia peposaca)
were swimming about, as well as the lovely Mandarin and
Carolina.
A male Mandarin and female Carolina paired some years
ago and hatched the young, but the hen bird was killed by a dog
and the ducklings all perished ; but two birds are now similarly
mated, and it is to be hoped that better luck will attend this
venture. I am sure that the result would be a very attractive
hybrid.
Several Fulvous Tree Duck (. Dendrocycna fnival) surprised
me by suddenly rising and flying round the square. O11 inquiry I

found that they had been bred on the place, and that this species
breeds every year. The Red-billed Tree Duck ( D. autumnalis)
has also bred here, but not within the last few years.
Scores of Mallards were on the water, several of them
showing a cross of the Indian Spot-billed Duck among them.
These are often joined by wild Mallards from the sea, which is
quite close, as well as by Pochard and by Teal.
Several Mallard and Pintail hybrids were also to be seen, as
well as pure Pintail ( Dafila acuta), Chilian Pintail ( D. spinicauda).
Bahama Duck ( Pcecilo?ietta bahame?isis), Shovellers and Chiloe
Wigeon, which latter breeds regularly.

On the European Rock Thrushes.
Added to all these captive birds were scores and scores
of Black-lieaded, Common and Herring Gulls in all stages of
plumage, screaming and fighting for every bit of bread thrown to
the duck, and I think it will be admitted that the sight in
Stephens Green is one most attractive to a bird-lover.
It may be of interest to record that after February all the
Black-headed Gulls leave for their nesting sites, the Common
Gulls leave in March, and the Herring Gulls a little later.
THE EUROPEAN ROCK THRUSHES.
By W. H. St. Quintin.
There is a curious teature in connection with the European
Rock Thrush (Monticola saxatilis&apos;) which I have not seen recorded.
Mr. Dresser (" Birds of Europe ") observes that the adult male
has a winter dress, differing from the summer plumage in being
more obscure." Mr. Dresser notes that the Blue Thrush
\Monticola cyanus&apos;) also has a winter plumage, differing from the
breeding dress, inasmuch as the blue on the head and upper
:hest is less intense, and each feather of breast and flank is edged
with greyish brown.
To the ordinary observer the Pied Rock Thrush appears
note of a Chat, and the Blue Thrush to be nearer the true
Thrushes, and Mr. Dresser says that he was inclined to think
:hat the Blue Thrushes might be kept generically distinct from
he Rock Thrushes, but in the end he came to the conclusion that
le could not separate them. And yet, in spite of the obviously
-lose relationship between them, those who have kept these
wo European species may have noticed that they have a very
Afferent way of assuming the nuptial dress (I speak of the males
mly).
The Blue Thrush sheds no feathers in the spring, and
)ecome gradually brighter by the casting of the feather tips, and
ilso perhaps as regards the blue of the head and throat, by the
colour pigment intensifying under the subtle influence of the

Mr. T. H. Newman,
wing feathers, all the winter plumage (head, neck, and body
feathers) are moulted.
I have a twelve-and-half year old male Fied Rock Thrush
before me; and two days ago (Feb. 12th) I found the first small
feathers on the floor of his cage, some of which I enclose. The
change is extremely rapid, and in little more than a month the
bird's appearance will be quite transformed.
My Blue Thrush, I am sorry to say, is a year older still,
and has this autumn become almost blind. He has never been
heard to utter a note since his sight failed, though previously he
would always acknowledge my entrance into the room by a song.
While at liberty in the room, he would let me pick him up, and
from the bottom of my pocket would utter a few sweet notes,
really I believe a challenge to combat! I never knew a bird
become so utterly fearless of human beings, or of the dogs of the
house ; and yet, when I brought him from Cannes in 1898, a
mowing-machine 011 the lawn, or the sound of carriage-wheels,
would send him fluttering round his cage in wild panic.
Within a few days of the end of June last year (1909) I
found both these species feeding young near the southern end of
the Simplon Pass. The young Pied Rock Thrushes were
amongst some huge boulders on the side of the Val Toce' and
the Blue Thrushes' nest was in a hole in a viaduct of the
Simplon Railway, above Domodossola.

By T. H. Newman, F.Z.S., M.B.O.U.
It will be remembered that mention was made in the
Avicultural Magazine for October, 1908, that six of these mag-
nificent birds had recently been imported from New Guinea;
they were deposited at the Zoological Gardens on September
24th, 1908, special attention being drawn to them in the report
on the additions to the Menagerie for that month. Only one
specimen seems to have been previously exhibited there ; that
was in 1874, and then its stay was brief, as certain remarks on its
anatomy appear in P.Z.S. for 1875.

I purchased the six birds 011 the 7th November, 1908,
removing one pair to my own aviaries 011 the 12th of the month.
It is of this pair that I am going to write. I need say very little
about the other four which I allowed to remain at the Gardens ;
-hey are such large birds that I thought two were enough for my
imited accommodation and that such beautiful birds deserved to
oe seen and admired by visitors to the Zoo .; but they did not
thrive there, and by the middle of the summer three of them
iad developed more or less white in the plumage, one looking
almost like a Spangled Game Fowl, while another had a pure white
:ail feather besides white 011 the wings; I believe they would
ioon have died if I had not removed two on 31st July and the
ast two four days later. They have much improved in health
since, and I expect the white will disappear during the next
moult ; anyway, it will be interesting to see what will happen.
I he birds differ in their temperament: the first two were nearly
dways to be seen outside in the flight at the Western Aviary,
-vliile the other four never seemed to come out of the inner part
mless obliged to ; I wonder if the warmth affected their plumage?
^.nd even now they keep much to the same ways, the last four
spending much time, and I believe roosting, in the inner house,
;vhile the first two seldom go into theirs ; during the summer they
oosted in the open, but since the winter under the glass shelter
n front of the inner house.
The White-throated Violet or Metallic Pigeon is the most
beautiful member of the finest group of the typical Pigeons, to
which the sub generic name Ianthamas has been given ; they are
probably largely fruit and bud eaters in their wild state and
tpproacli the Imperial Fruit Pigeons (Carpophaga) in appearance
uid some of their habits.
I hardly know how to describe a bird which completely
changes with every ray of light; see a poor specimen on a dull
lay, it looks little more than a black Pigeon with a vinous breast
md white throat; but catch sight of a newly moulted bird in
he bright sun, then a Humming-bird could scarcely surpass it
n brilliancy of colouration. The general plumage is blackish
late ; every feather, except the quills and tail, being edged with
Jittering metallic hues ; the front of the neck and breast are of

Mr. T. H. Newman,
a beautiful vinous shade ; generally the hind neck, mantle and
rump appear of a shining green, while every small feather ou-
tlie wings is edged with the same colour; the crown appearing
a beautiful pink, while the fore neck and breast have a fine pink
lustre; but catch sight of the bird at a fresh angle, then the
crown will reflect green lights, the neck will glow with pink and
copper and the whole breast becomes shot with the brightest
green and pink; again, rich purple glosses maybe seen. It is
this wonderful diversity of colouration that forms one of the
chief attractions of this beautiful bird and makes one never tired
of looking to see how it will appear next. A fine drawing I
have, by Mr. H. Goodchild, showing the same bird in two positions,
shows well how different the same bird may look. The most
conspicuous feature is the pure white chin, throat and ear-
coverts, which show up when otherwise the bird would scarcely
be noticed. The beauty of the bird is much enhanced by the eye
and bill ; in the former the iris is orange-scarlet becoming yellow
next the pupil, and is surrounded by a bare rosy-carmine ring
broader in front next the bill, where it comes to a point; the bill
itself is rather long and is of a rosy-carmine tint with the hard
part at the tip yellowisli-horn colour ; the feet are pale carmine
with yellowish-horn claws.
In size and shape it much resembles our Wood-pigeon (C*
palumbus ) ; as the legs are rather short the bird looks best on a
branch ; it is thoroughly arboreal in habits and only seems to
come to the ground to feed. When the cock displays to the hen
the neck is inflated and he bows slowly towards her uttering a
single very deep note, which is followed by a second one as
though he were drawing in his breath ; when the head is raised a
distinct jump is often made up and down on the perch, a very
Carpophaga-WXze habit, so that the bird may be said also to have
a dance. I am sorry I have not noticed this point closer, but
though the pair are seldom far apart, I have hardly ever seen
them caressing one another as Pigeons so often do, and have not
heard them coo frequently. They are very quiet and peaceable
birds. The flight seems rather slow and heavy but would doubt-
less appear very different in the open. The sexes are alike, the
cock being rather larger and seeming to have a longer neck,
while the hen seems more squat on her legs.

I have not come across any account of the habits of this
Pigeon, so that the following- letter, most kindly written tome
)&gt; otn member, Mr. Walter Goodfellow, who procured and
nought the birds to England, will be of all the more interest,
t is dated 3rd November, 1908. He writes:--"I am not sur-
prised that you should admire the White-throated Pigeons.
Vhen 111 good plumage they are very handsome and shine with
11 sorts of surprising colours. Although I believe they are
mnd all over New Guinea and a few years ago I saw some in
aptivity in the Moluccas (Banda Island), I had never met
dth them myself until I went to British New Guinea. During
lie very wet months of February and March I never saw any^
tobably like most of the other Pigeons there, they retire at that
me to the Eastern sides of the high main ranges where it is dry.
found them range up to 5,000 feet, and they probably go higher
ill in the very dry weather. Mine were caught in May at 4,000
&apos; et , and they were quite numerous then in the Moroka Mountains,
hereas at the same place in February I never saw one. In
pnl I began to see them about singly near the Owen Stanley
mge and at the other camp mentioned, in May, they came about
1 small flocks of seven or eight. Most days we caught some,
id at one time I had eighteen or more caged together in an
iiclosme I had built for them in camp. I was uncertain
hetlier to bring any home or not as they require a large cage,
at I admired them so much that I could not resist bringing a
w of them. They were a great nuisance to my nets; a flock
ould fly through carrying them either away bodily or breaking
lem so much that they were no further use. They roost in the
ps of the highest trees, choosing the dead ones usually. They
so retire to the same during heavy rains instead of, as one would
ink, to the shelter of leaves. They have a pleasant deep boom-
g note, weie rather troublesome to get 011 to maize at first, at
ast the first ones were, as they did not seem to understand^ ;
course later arrivals that were turned into the enclosure were
0 trouble in that way, as they learnt to eat it from the others.
At the beginning of June I found several eggs on the
ound at different times and again on the voyage home two
-re laid and broken, but I did not know which bird or birds
id them.

Mr. T. H. Newman,
" We used to catch a good many Pigeons of different kinds,
fruit-eating and otherwise, but having so many other biids I
could not bring them home, for I was a long way from the coast
(eight days) and the question of carriers was a serious matter, as
the district was very thinly populated ; as it was I had to abandon
a great deal of camp gear and the sixty odd cariieis I had
practically exhausted the supply."
Mr. Good fellow told me subsequently that he had not met
with the bird since, so that it seems that it is at any xate a
partial migrant, very likely like other fruit-eating Pigeons being
found where its food is in proper eating condition. I have often
seen the birds sitting out on a bare branch during heavy rain,
and I believe they eat little else than maize, of which I am always
careful to give them a good supply, and they seem to thrive on it.
During the early part of 1909 my first pair of birds seemed
to show some desire to nest; a few sticks were collected on the
top of a faggot of brushwood under the glass shelter and I
used to hear the cock utter his single deep note, at this time
without the second one, but after a little time they seemed
to give up the idea, being disturbed I think by a pair of White-
crowned Pigeons, and I thought there would be 110 further
attempt to nest that year.
About the end of August they moulted ; for some time the
cock was nearly bare of feathers on his white throat, and all the
tail-feathers of the hen were broken when I first had her, but by
the second week in September both birds were in perfect feather
and fine condition. Having been away for a short time on
September 17th, I could only see one of the pair of White-
throated Pigeons, so began to search for the very possible remains
of the other one; when close to a large golden elder bush it
suddenly flew out, and to my great surprise I found a well-built,
almost flat circular platform of twigs about five feet from the
ground, with a single large rather pointed white egg in the
centre. After examining the egg I retired and the old bird soon
returned to the nest. The egg was quite fresh and could only
have been laid a day or two; but, of course, the exact date is
unknown. It was not until some days later that I was again able
to catch sight of the egg ; there was still only one. The birds sat

very closely ; the cock would not leave the nest when I stood
close by. I only once saw the egg left alone for a minute.
On October 2nd it hatched, sixteen days after being dis-
covered ; I found the shell under a branch some distance from
the nest; it is of a very pale cream colour, and is rather coarsely
granulated with very little gloss. I know the egg was not
hatched on October 1st. The weather was foggy when the young
was hatched and the next day was wet, but the parents covered
it well ; as the nest was in the open a very little neglect would
have been fatal.
The 6th was a fine bright day after much wet, in the morn-
ing the hen was on the nest; she let me look at the young one,
only raising one wing, puffing herself out and gently pecking at
my hand when I touched the infant. Its eyes were just beginning
to open; its skin was very dark grey; the quills were com-
mencing to sprout in the wings ; its body, wings and head were
covered rather sparingly with yellow down.
O11 the 9th, weather still bright and fine ; young one grow-
ing ; feathers on wings just ready to burst their quills. I could
not get a clear view as the old cock kept striking at me with his
wing and trying to cover the youngster by fl uffing out his feathers.
I did not see the young one again until the 21st as I had
been away. I was told that the old birds had been brooding
very closely, and had not been noticed to leave the nest alone
during my absence. However, on that morning both parents
were off the nest; the young one looked healthy. It was well-
leathered with well-developed wings and tail. The yellow down
still adhered thickly to the ends of the smaller wing-feathers;
in colour it was much blacker than its parents; the whole general
colour being slaty-black ; head sooty black ; bronze-green
reflections 011 the back of neck and nape ; ear-coverts white ;
chin, throat and base of bill quite bare and grey-coloured ; the
bill looked very long. Soon the hen returned to the nest and sat
by the young one, whose head only was beneath her feathers.
22nd. Young one has the breast feathers sooty black like
the head, only a little lighter than the wings and very much
darker than in the adult; it was alone and raised its wings when
I went near, its parents uttering warning grunts from near by.

23rd. Young one three weeks old and still looking well.
The white ear-coverts form conspicuous oval white patches on
each side of the head below the eye, giving the bird a very
curious appearance at this stage, they are still separated by a
broad bare patch 011 the chin and throat.
25th. Young one out of nest and on the ground; next
day it had returned to the nest, where it remained for two or
three days longer, and was then seen on a perch at the end of
the aviarv.
*
November 2nd. The young bird was now between four
and five weeks old and could fly strongly ; it struck out with its
wings at any bird that came near it.
3rd. Young bird very well, it struck out at all strange
birds that approached it, but quivered its wings when its parents
came near. Saw the old cock feed it when on a perch ; it after-
wards followed him about.
11 tli. Young one nearly six weeks old and very strong,
quite three-quarters as large as its parents. General colour
slaty-black with strong green reflections on back of neck and
mantle; green showing 011 flanks and also on rump, a little on
the wing-coverts ; the green seems to be getting stronger each
day; breast and crown fuliginous; white cheeks and throat not
quite so large in proportion as in the adult and more of a dead
white; primaries with brownish edges; wing-coverts still retain
yellow down ; iris dark ; bill dusky-brown, no red visible round
the eye, which makes the bird much less noticeable than the old
ones; feet dusky pink. It flaps its wings very much when being
led, and utters a low squeak also often after alighting.
After about four months this young bird seems to be prac-
tically adult, as it has assumed the plumage of maturity. The
bill and skin round the eye have become almost as brightly
coloured as these parts in its parents ; it seems nearly as large
as they, but looks a little slimmer. The tail has not, however,
been renewed, and the white area 011 the throat seems not quite
fully developed yet.

(Psephotus chrysopterygius.)
Sir,--H aving lately acquired two pairs of these beautiful little
Pairakeets, I should like to ask whether anyone knows whether they are
birds of the last breeding season in Australia ; and if so, whether the males
acquire their black caps, brown backs, and yellow shoulders, at once ; for
my two lllales lla ve these, but are not in full colour, as they lack the
yellow frontal band and the same colouring round the eyes, besides which
the tail-coverts and flanks are very subdued in their tints with regard to
the blue in the fiist instance ; and the red in the second.
The females also have their heads of a uniform dull apple-green.
In the male birds, an occasional dull green feather shows 011 the backs,
[amongst the deeper brown ones.
I have not had an opportunity of examining any series of skins of
these Psephoti.
Would their present colouring be that of the first change of feathers
after the nestling plumage: and if so, when will the fully adult colouring
be assumed ?
One would have thought that the difference between the males and
einales would not have been so very marked, as it is, if their present plumage
epresents that of immature birds.
If several pairs of these gems of the Psepholus family came over to
England, how many were landed 011 the Continent ? and when shall we see
t like consignment of P. pulcherrimus ? Hubert D. Asti.ky.

SUGAR-BIRDS.
Coereba coerulea and C. cyanea.
By Frank Finn, B.A., F.Z.S., M.B.O.U,
The Purple Sugar-bird, a blue-coat-boy among birds, is
he only near relative imported of the now comparatively familiar
fellow-winged Sugar-bird ( Coereba cyanea). Both species are
5011th American, and are, I believe, known in the feather trade,
vhere they are unfortunately infinitely more familiar than in
Aviculture, as " Blue Creepers." In habits they would appear,
tidging from their ways in captivity, much to resemble the Sun-
&gt;irds of the Eastern tropics, to which they also greatly approxi-
mate in appearance. In fact, did they occur in the Old World,
hey certainly would be referred to the Sun-bird family.
The Yellow-winged species was received by the Zoological
Society many years ago, and a bird lived at the Zoo, in a cage, in
lie Parrot-house for seven years, from 1890 to 1S97. This was
ne of the specimens in which I observed the annual assumption
f female plumage (except 011 the wings and tail) ; this was
scorded by me in a paper published in the Journal of the Asiatic
&apos;ociety (Vol. EXVII., Pt. II., No. 1, 1898), in connection with
bservations on an analogous change in the Indian Purple Sun-
ird ( Arachnechthra asiatica ), but this change of plumage in the
ugar-bird may have been previously described, though there
&gt; nothing about it in the British Museum Catalogue.
The Purple Sugar-bird was not received at the Zoo, or
nported at all, to my knowledge, till January 20th, 1905, when a
; 111 ale was deposited at the Gardens. She had 110 companions

Mr. Frank Finn,
of her own species till November 25th of that year, when Mi. A.
Pam presented two male specimens from Venezuela. Last month
Mr. DeVon had a consignment of both this and the Yellow-winged
species, and a male of the former was acquired for the Zoological
Society's collection, and may, at the time of writing, be seen in
the new indoor aviary in the Small Birds' House, along with the
old hen.
Mr. Tinniswood Miller has also got one of this consign-
ment, and has very kindly furnished me with the following notes
on his treatment of these birds:--
"I feed the birds on Nestld's milk (made with boiling
water} with a little Mellin's food and sponge cake ci limbs in it.
He has about a fluid oz. of this and drinks every drop, leaving the
sponge cake almost dry at the bottom of the cup , also several
grapes (green or black, so long as they are sweet) split open and
the stones taken out, and about a quarter of a banana a day.
" I feed the Yellow-winged Sugar-bird in precisely the
same way, and have had him since Octooer, 1906; he is still
going strong, and at present in perfect condition.
"They are kept in separate cages, sizes: i8in. x I2in.
x i6in. high, with a twiggy branch in them. The floor of the
cage is covered with blotting paper, that is changed three times
a day: morning, mid-day and evening."
A few notes on the Purple Sugar-bird, as observed in the
Zoological Gardens, may not be out of place. The young male
brought by Mr. Pam was in a plumage exactly like that of the
female, but his legs were of so distinctly yellow a green, or rather,
greenish-yellow, that I suspected his sex from this alone, and
was not surprised when he proceeded to don his purple plumage.
It was, I think, the old cock who showed that this species also
has a green undress plumage like the commoner Yellow-winged
species, by assuming some patches of green, but he did not live
long enough to complete the change. These two cocks both died
on the same day ; I strongly suspect they fought and killed eacl
other, though the keeper told me there was 110 evidence of this.
The little hen is still living, and has had as much exper
ience of the Zoo as most birds, having lived in a big fligh
and glass case in the Insect house, in a small cage in tin

Small Bird house, and in one of the outside aviaries there. She
has always been well and is very tame. A habit I noticed in
her when she first arrived was that of flying up and hovering
under the roof of her flight; a gentleman who knew Humming
# b
birds in their wild state told me that this was exactly how they
acted, and when the Zoo had theirs I was able to appreciate
the truth of this observation. The cocks seem less addicted to
this habit, as I can hardly remember seeing anv of the three I
have watched indulge in it; it may perhaps be a peculiarity of
this individual, which is certainly a very robust one.
On the whole I should judge the bird to be quite as easy
to keep as its relative, if not more so; and I hope both will
become commoner in aviculture. I11 this connection I should like
to suggest that they beknown as the Red-legged and Yellow-legged
Sugar-birds respectively ; the red legs being a far more striking
point of C. cyanea than the usually-concealed yellow of the wing,
while purple is the prevailing colour of both. It is true that the
leO/ li a s 11 o t y e 11 ow legs, but then neither is she purple
in colour !
bor the benefit of those members who may not happen to
know the Yellow-winged Sugar-bird, I may say that, in addition
to having red legs in both sexes--much brighter in the male,
however--it is distinguished by the yellow colouring on the inner
webs of the quills, and most conspicuously by the brilliant
metallic sea-green cap of the male, the feathers of which are
often raised. The female is of a more uniform and duller green
than that of the Purple or Yellow-legged bird, and has no buff
or blue on the head. I his species is about the size of our
Willow-wren, the Purple one being smaller, about as big as the
Chiffchaff.
I understand that a specimen of the Yellow-winged species
has been kept for twelve years at the Hotel Mdtropole at
Brighton, living in a flight in the Winter Garden along with
Pekin Robins and other soft-bills, and that its chief food has
been honey in the comb, a section being kept hung up for its
benefit.
The ease with which these birds are kept in confinement
alone suggests the possibility of breeding them, but, so far as I

know, no one has done this, though a good many people must
have had pairs of the Yellow-winged or Red-legged species at
any rate. In case any one wants to make the attempt, I should
strongly advise them not to keep the two species in the same
place as I believe sooner or later there would be war to the
death between them.
It is true that Mr. Beebe records in his paper on Venezue-
lan birds, in Zoologica , Vol. I., p. ioi. having found both species
in the same district of Venezuela, but this local association of
species which nevertheless do not get on well together often
occurs, notably in the case of the Blackcap and Garden Warbler
in Britain, and of the Gold-fronted and Blue-winged Green
Bulbuls (Chloropsis aurifrons and C. hardwickii) in India. It is
worth noting in this connection that in the Zoo last year the
male Blue Wren, then living there, so violently hunted a male
Yellow-winged Sugar-bird that the latter had to be removed
from that particular flight; no doubt the jealousy of a similai
colour, so often observable in birds, came into play here.
In the above paper on Venezuelan birds, by the way.
Mr. Beebe records that the female Purple Sugar-bird collected
by him "had been feeding on the small seeds of an orchid.'
A male Yellow-winged Sugar-bird, on the other hand, had fed
on small insects.
Sugar-birds are credited with building domed nests; i
these two species do so, and construct them at all like those o
Sun-birds, the fact would be very interesting and not witliou
scientific value. The hen Purple Sugar-bird is very simila
in colouration and form to some of the streaked Eastern Sun
birds of the genus Arachnothera , and these build peculiar nest
sewn on to the large leaves of plants.
Altogether, these two charming birds are of extrem
interest aviculturally, not only for their singular beauty an.
grace, and the comparative easiness of keeping them, but also i:
that the breeding of them would be really an achievement to b
proud of and likely to add something to our knowledge. I hop
some one will soon succeed with one or other of them in thi
way, and then give us as full an account of their ways a
possible.

BRITISH BIRDS ON MIGRATION THROUGH ITALY.

By Lieut.-Colonel G. A. Momber.
T. lie following list of British species is selected from a
Catalogue, with notes, of the fauna (including marine zoology)
and flora of Genoa and district. The Catalogue, published in
1847, seems a conscientious work, at which several experts must
have been employed. It numbers 343 species, of which 66 figure
in our excerption. It has been accessible to the public at the
Genoa museum and library, and has, therefore, stood open to
the criticism and challenge of time. The present selection from
the Catalogue is made with the object of showing how, in that
district, certain birds are observed at one season of the year,
chiefly, or only. Although the scientific names quoted are readily
intelligible, Howard Saunder's nomenclature, technical and Eng-
lish, is now added, as also are the Ligurian vernacular names,
dliis rude Doric may perplex even those who can command some
Italian, but it is conclusive evidence of the bird being known to
the natives. It should be remembered, in this connection, that
the implacable proclivities for bird-hunting of the Southerner
must inevitably produce some knowledge of species. Without
the wholesale catching formerly carried on in Heligoland, and
without Gatke to record its results, our Northern bird knowledge
would lack many of its facts. The regular exposure for sale of
birds on the markets of Italian towns must help to manifest the
prevalence or non-occurrence of a species, and confirm the
observations of chasseurs and naturalists. In Italy, too, a small
oird is often not what, popularly, it would be in England, just a
unall bird. In Italy, it is a delicacy of varying degree. The
3 euoa cooks, when purchasing Ortolans, are careful to avoid
nferior substitutes, for the dealers have a trick of subcutaneously
njecting olive oil to give the plucked bodies of other Buntings an
Ortolan-like appearance. I11 the great birding centres of Northern
taly, the restaurant gastronomes will not put up with Tits and
finches when they can titillate their palates with Warblers.
In considering the course of migration, it is necessary to
iscriminate between the passage of a bird through a district
-lid its arrival at its summer haunt, or departure therefrom.
.Vhilst 011 migration, it is for the most part a skyfarer, hardly
&gt;bserved but by those who know where to look for it, and do so.

But, on arriving at its nesting quarters. it at once pioe.a.ms Ls

up for the autumn journey, again, is less perceptible. I ne l rc&gt;
have 1&amp;lt; ng been s ng their r except in the
case of the Swallow tribes and a few others that ostentatiously
band themselves together, they unobtrusively vanish like the
morning mists.
It seems probable that birds generally are more ooservab.e
on their autumn, than on their verna.. travels. The jonmey
South is mirsued le&gt;s directly, in more leisurely fasnion. with
more halts for food and rest, and perhaps at lower elevations,
than the urgent rush Xorta to the nesting haunts. Moreover.
the numbers should be greater in autumn.
Vet, of the kinds picked out tor our list as otterre: seen ...
one particular season, it is in spring that the majority .*ie ob-
served. rougillv iorty-seven k&apos;uos as against mne seen .n autumn.
Of course, there is to be reckoned with the :act that on tne land-
ing side of a wide sea like the Mediterranean, exhausted birds
often pitch on the first available land, and fall an easy pre&gt; to
the fowler. The writer lias watched tired Quail. Hoopoes, and
Sandpipers flying low from the sea alight on the slopes by the
Italian sea-sh re. But if this fact contained an explanation, nowi
is it that the bulk of the Genoa Catalogue names is recorded on
both pass.-.ges ? that any species is noticed mo.e .a -
that so many of the kinds observed in spring are the strong-flying
ducks and waders, whilst of the nine autumn-preponderating
varieties five are small weak Passerines? These five are:
Richards&apos; Pi; it. Meadow Pipit. Reed Bunting. Marsh Bunting
and Citril Finch. The remaining four comprise Loug-earea
Owl, Rook. Ring-dove and Stock-dove.
Only voting birds are seen of: Snow Bunting, Red-tnro-.c-
Diver. Goosander, in winter : Common Scoter and Golden-eye.
in spring ; Rosv Pastor. Marsh Bunting. Glossy Ibis, in autumn.
The inference to be drawn ::o:u our tao.e. tnererore. vron.-
be that these srecies pass tiirougn tie Bay ct Vrtrnoa res pec ti *
more on one annual migration than on the other : he cr r
that thev follow tixed, different routes, and trat certain!} L;gunts,

By Hubert D. Asteey.
I have lately received a Short-tailed Parrot (Pachynus
brachytirus) which is the size of a Meyer's Parrot or of a Pionus,
but resembling a miniature green Amazon in appearance.
The head is of a sea-green colour, which brightens into
grass-green all over the body. The larger wing-feathers are
finely edged with yellowish-green or yellow, but the whole effect
of the bird is a green one. At the shoulders there is a very
small patch of dull wine-red, and the same colour is found at
the base of the outer tail-feathers. The beak, which is rather
large for the size of the bird, is greenish horn-colour; the feet
greenish grey, and the eyes dark brown with an outer circle of
orange-red. The tail is very short, barely protruding beyond the
points of the wings.
This little parrot is exceedingly tame and confiding, coming
011 to my hand (or anyone else's !) and allowing one to stroke
and handle it.
It promises not to be lacking in intellect, and perhaps it
will learn to speak. A gentler bird I never saw, and its looking
like a pygmy Amazon, gives it some fascination all its own.
Ecuador and Northern Brazil is, I believe, its home.
I fancy it is very rarely imported ; I have never seen one
in the London Zoological Society's collection, but that does not
follow that it has not been represented there !
When I first received this bird, he was in a dirty condition,
and he looked as if he was about to depart into the plane of
spirits, there to prepare for another incarnation, in who knows
what species of bird's body ? But warmth, biscuit sop boiled in
water, milk, and barley water in three equal portions, and some
quinine and ' Cinnamal ' in his drinking water, pulled him round.
It was a pleasure to see the drooping wings and ruffled feathers
tightening up, the eyes growing brighter, the whole body becom-
ing smaller in appearance. Warmth is the chief restorer.
A female Golden-shouldered Parrakeet which was
growing thinner and thinner, (a new importation) became so ill
at last that she sat at the bottom of the cage in a tottering state,
neither eating nor drinking, the eyes half closed, the breast

ike a knife. I put some drops of port wine, with sugar melted
iti it, down her throat, an operation by no means easy with that
mall rounded bill and tiny mouth ; but what proved better still,
put her in a liot-house where the temperature is between 70*
nd 8o* by day, and not under 65* by night. The next day
er feathers were tighter, and she was on a perch, and by the
fternoon she was eating. In the fortnight, though still lacking
er normal flesh, she was looking as well as any bird could look,
&apos;he moist heat had restored the poor bird to life.
*Bye-the-bye ! These Golden-shouldered Patrakeets, which
ave been imported lately, are not the same as illustrated in Mr.
ieth-Smith's " Parrakeets " ; they lack the yellow frontal band
nd eye-patch, and the area of yellow on the shoulder is, I think,
irger. The female has a paler coloured crown than that of
^sephotns chrysopterygius. If the title were not too lengthy, they
hould be called the "Black-capped Golden-sliouldered Parrakeet,"
nd the other species (or ? variety) the " Yellow-fronted.'&apos; They
2em to come from a different part of Northern Australia. I
nd that the black-capped variety has apparently been imported
11 at least three occasions. Mr. Blaauw has had it before this
ear, and also Mr. Fasey.
Another rare importation which is in my possession is a
air of partridges (?) from Senegal. Perhaps Ptilopachys fuscus.
hese birds are, let us say, rather smaller than a Virginian Colin,,
ud resemble Guans in miniature, or even hen Bantams of the
Ltckwing game variety. The tails are carried like Guan's and
re the shape of a hen Bantam's ; the necks have hackle feathers,
ellow brown with whitish edgings. The same colouring is
arried over the upper breast and along the flanks. The general
olouring of the upper parts is dull brown with a tinge of rufous
1 it. A red skin encircles the eyes, and the legs and feet are
Iso red. If they are the species I suppose them to be, they are
ailed " Rock Pheasants." I should like to hear from any fellow-
inciers whether they know them, or anything about them, f
I have also received what I believe to be a Tropical Seed
*This was written before any matter had been published. It is since decided that
they are to be called " Hooded " Parrakeets Pscphotus cucullatus. H.D.A
t No doubt Ptilopachys fuscus, as suggested; the Zoo have one. Ed.

Finch (jOvyzobovus torridus), a small Grosbeak-like biid, whose
colouring is black on the head, neck, and upper parts; with a
small patch of white on the wings, and the underparts licli deep
chestnut. The large Grosbeak bill is black, and the legs and
feet deep lead-colour.
This species is said to have a melodious song, and comes
from Para. It is the size of a Mannikin. The tail is broad and
rounded. This Tropical Seed Finch has been acquired, I fancy,
before now, by some of our members.
Of other rarities, which I have possessed for some time, my
male Racquet-tailed Parrot from the Celebes, which I have
had for over two years, is in perfection of plumage and condition,
only marred by one wing having been severely sprained at the
shoulder, and consequently not lying tightly down on the body.
This bird's colouring is most lovely, with his emerald head, on
the crown of which is a pure French-grey patch, in the centre of
which lies a brilliant pink spot, whilst the 'old-gold ' at the lower
part of the neck at the back is a very uncommon bird colour.
The racquets of the tail remain in beautiful condition from
one autumn to another, and as far as I can ascertain, grow out
unsheathed in quills until the more solid portion of the feather
begins. It would be interesting to know whether the Racquet-
tailed Parrots commenced originally to develop these appendages
as the Motmots are apparently now doing ; for Mr. Beebe of New
York has made the discovery that the Motmotdoes not deliberately,
as has hitherto been supposed, pluck off the shafts from the two
central tail-feathers, leaving the racquets, but that those shafts
which drop off are merely helped by the bird preening its feathers,
because just in that spot they are abnormally weak. Therefore,
the Motmot, as regards his racquets, may be going through a
transitional stage, and later on the racquets may grow perfectly
developed with the shafts above them already bare and ready-
made ! The same thing may have happened with the Racquet-
tailed Parrots. Chi lo sa ? as the Italians say.
My Racquet-tail is probably the only one in Europe, and
up to a short time ago the same might have been said of my
Purple-breasted Parrot ( Triclaria cyanogaster) which I have
had in perfect health and magnificent condition for some five years

&gt;ut I understand that one has been lately acquired by the
uthorities of the Berlin Zoological Gardens.
My parrots keep in far better condition if they are syringed
vith water, and allowed some exercise out of their cages.
I have never succeeded in obtaining another male Agapor-
tis tar ant a [Abyssinian Love-bird], but the female has wintered
n an outdoor aviary, and lays eggs.
Another rarity is a pair of Calornis metallica ; given me,
r ery kindly, by Sir Walter Ingram. Starling-like birds from New
Guinea and thereabouts; the male resplendent in iridescent
lark purples and greens, with an eye " which looks like a ruby "
-and a narrow pointed tail; the female with subdued tints of
he male on the upper parts, whilst the lower are of a pearly-
vhite with narrow black longitudinal streaks.
These birds, unlike true Starlings, build a bulky pensile
lest of fibre, etc. The male has a Starling-like song.
My Fairy Blue-birds ( Irena turcosa )--called, in the Malay
'eninsula, Coffee birds, owing to their habit of assembling to eat
he berries on the coffee bushes, when they are ripe--have passed
he winter in a semi-open outdoor aviary, and look gorgeous;
he male, who like the Calornis , has an eye of flashing red,
esplendent in shining upper parts of cobalt satin, and under-
,"arts of blackest velvet.
But I must write more on these subjects on a future
ccasion.

By Dr. A. G. Butler.
It has been questioned whether birds live longer in cap-
ivity than when at liberty, and I think there can be no doubt,
part from the risks which a bird runs from destruction by
nemies of all kinds when free, that cage and aviary birds when
roperly looked after attain to a considerably greater age.
In the Ibis for 1899, pp. 19-41, Mr. J. H. Gurney published
valuable paper entitled " O11 the Comparative Ages to which
h'rds live," and it has often occurred to me that if each avicul-
urist who has kept many species and preserved a record of the
uration of their lives would publish the same in a single article,

Dr. A. G. Butter,
it would be possible to prove conclusively that a life of moderate
restraint was more beneficent than one of savagery.
It has often been asserted by those entirely ignorant of the
devotion of bird-lovers to their pets, that it is cruel to keep birds
in cage and aviary. Undoubtedly it is cruel to keep a bird in an
enclosure in which he has scarcely room to turn round ; but
nobody with any affection for a bird would dream of keeping it in
a cage in which it could not use its wings, bathe, and, in fact,
obtain healthful exercise.
I began to keep birds about the year 1883, and have never
confined any bird permanently in a small cage; and, beginning
with one measuring about 18 inches cubic for a single small bird,
I have gradually adopted an enclosure of about twice that
measurement. When I first received my English Jay, then only
two or three months old, I at once built a cage for him measure-
ing 5 feet 5 inches in length, 3 feet 3 inches in height, and 2 feet
inches from front to back, thus enabling him to use his wings
freely : the result, combined with nutritious food from the first
is, that I do not suppose there is another bird of its size or
condition in this country either tame or wild.
That birds are happy in captivity is evident from the re-
luctance which they exhibit, after a year or two's association
with a considerate owner, to being set at liberty; hanging about
their cage or aviary, or at least the neighbourhood, for days, and
not infrequently voluntarily returning to captivity. O11 several
occasions when my cages have been accidently left open, the
inmates have disregarded the open door and made no attempt
whatever to come outside. Is it conceivable that this would
occur if their lives were irksome?
A bird which is happy, lives healthily--taking sufficient
exercise, bathing freely, living in pure air, and receiving good
food, has a better chance of prolonging its life than its wild
relatives, which have to struggle for their existence with numerous
foes, accidents of many kinds, and adverse weather; and although
(like all aviculturists) I have lost many newly-acquired birds
from weakness and disease contracted before they came into my
possession, I think that those which were healthy enough to
recover have shown a fair average for longevity.

I think it was about 1902 that Mr. E. W. Harper imported
specimens of the Grey-winged Ouzel, of which he gave me a
ine male: this bird is still in splendid health and condition, its
ige at present being about eight years I suppose ; it remains to
&gt;e seen how much longer it will live.
Shama (received through the post November 1903); still
n perfect health--over six years in my possession.
Bluebird purchased 1889, bred in 1890, died 1899. The
:ock bird therefore lived with me about ten years.
Mocking-bird purchased 1892, died 1896, only four vears,
)Ut a second very old bird given to me subsequently lived with
tie about eleven years, dying in 1909.
Pekin Nightingale purchased 1888, died 1898 ; a female
till living was purchased about 1901.
Red-vented Bulbul purchased early 1892, died November
S95--by no means a long life.
White-eared Bulbul presented 1887, died end of 1892-
bout five years.
Chinese Bulbul purchased June 1899, still living in good
ealth--getting on for its twelfth year in my possession.
Collared Jay-Thrush purchased January 1900, died
anuary 1907--seven years : its cage was none too large,--about
feet by 2 and 2 feet 6 inches in height.
Chinese White-eye. I have no exact record of the date

Superb Tanager. The longest record I have is from
larch 1899 to September 1901; the birds generally come to hand
1 rough condition and seem delicate.

Archbishop Tanager. Presented end of 1903 ; one male
ill living in perfect condition--over six years so far.
Scarlet Tanager. Two males purchased in 1897 '&gt; both
ving and healthy at present after thirteen years in a large cage.
Madeiran Chaffinch. Presented 1895, the male died in
398, and the female in 1899 ; not much of a record !
Lesser and White-throated Rock-Sparrows. Pre-
iiited in 1898, died in 1903--five years in a flight-cage.
Grey-headed Sparrow. Purchased 1895, died 1900.

Dr. A. G. Butler,
Saffron-finch. I kept few records of this species, but a
bird bred between this species and a Canary in 1S98 lived ten
years, and doubtless many of my pure Saffron-finches have done
the same.
St. Helena Seed-eater, purchased 1S89 or 1890 ; the
male lived until late in 1S9S--eight to nine years.
Grey Singing-finch. I have no exact record of the
purchase of my specimens, but I know I .seemed a pair about
1900, the hen of which lived until near the end of 1908.
Alario-finch. A male purchased in 1892 died in 1900,
having been over eight years in my possession.
Chingolo Song-Sparrow. I have no record of my earlier
specimens of this species, but Mr. leschemaker sent me a pair
bred by himself in October 1907, one of which is still living.
PilEated Finch. A hen received in exchange in the
winter of 1887-8 died in December 1893, having been in my
possession about six years.
Green Cardinal. I have 110 exact record of when I
purchased the male of this species ; the female I imported in
1893 ; but I had them in an indoor cage for about two years
before I turned them into an outdoor aviary to breed in 1895 ;
thus assuming that they were both secured in 1S93, the hen died
in 1896 and the cock in 1897, which gives from three to four
Yellow-billed Cardinal. Of four purchased in i 9 * 3 &gt;
one lived until August 1909, six years in captivity.
I have no notes of the number of years for which my
Red-headed and Red-crested Cardinals lived, but I don t
think any of them exceeded from three to four years: my
Virginian Cardinals certainly did not live so long, all being
destroyed by heat-apoplexy.
Tropical Seed-finch. Presented November 1907 and
still living.
White-throated Finch. I had a male for about ter
years.
Fire-red Finch. Presented in November 1907 and still
living.
Reddish PTnch. I have no exact record, but my bin
certainly lived from eight to ten years.

Guttural Finch. A lien lived with me about ten years.
The SpermophilcB generally are long-lived in captivity, and
although a Lavender-backed Finch died after two years I have
reason to believe that it was killed by my Tropical Seed-finch.
Black-headed Lined Finch. Presented November 1907
and still living.
Lavender Finch. About four years.
Unfortunately I have not recorded the date of purchase
m the labels attached to my Waxbills, but I am sure of the
ollowing: Common Amaduvade, eight to ten years. Gold-
breasted W axbill the same. Green Amaduvade the same.
\0x25A0Ied-browed Waxbill, six to eight years. Grey Waxbill eight
/eats. Crimson-Winged Waxbiel oulv two or three vears at
nost.
Cordon-bleu. A male purchased in 1896 was living at
he beginning of 1908, having been in my possession close upon
welve years,--a very good record for a delicate little bird !
Pintailed Nonpareil. A very delicate species, but a
len lived with me from 1906 to 1909, nearly three years.
Gouldian Finch. A male lived from 1896 to 1902, six
ears: birds born in 1905 are still living.
Masked Grassfinch. Purchased 1905; still living.
Long-tailed Grassfinch. Purchased 1906 ; still living.
Parson PTnch. I have no record, but am sure that I
ave kept this species for quite five years, probably longer.
Zebra Finch. I believe this to be naturally a short-lived
ird, and do not suppose that, in its wild state, it lives more than
mee years, but I have kept unpaired cocks for fully eight years
nd they are still living.
Bicheno Finch. Three to four years.
Cherry - finch. Five years--1892-1897 is my longest
ecord.
I have kept the African Silver-bill for years in suc-
ession, as also Ribbon-finches and Red-headed Finches, but
ave hardly a record to guide me as to the number of years,
lie females of the two latter species never seem to live, at the
utside, more than two or three years, being extremely subject

purchased hen Ribbon-finches as mates, every hen has died egg-
bound, but all the cocks are still living, having been in my
possession from four to five years nearly.
Sharp-tailed Finch. Of specimens purchased in 1894,
one lived until October 1900--over six years.
Common Spice-bird. Of birds presented in 1902, one
lived to 1907--five years.
Pectoral Finch. Of birds bought in 1905, one lived to
April 1909--nearly four years.
Chestnut-breasted Finch. Of specimens purchased in
1894, three died in 1896, two in 1897, and the last I believe lived
on until 1899 or 1900, but unfortunately no labels are attached to
most of the specimens: still it may safely be assumed to have
lived in confinement five years.
Yellow- rumped Mannikin. Purchased in 1906, several
still living.
White-headed Mannikin. I have already recorded the
fact that a pair formerly in my possession died after seventeen
and eighteen years in captivity.
Black-headed Mannikin. I purchased half-a-dozen of
this species in 1897, and am sure that they lived five or six years,
but on account of their abundance in the market had none of
them skinned, and preserved no record of the exact date of their
death. I have found the allied Three-Coloured Mannikin
rather a short-lived bird.
Java Sparrow. Bred in 1896 and 1897 ; two birds still
living--at least thirteen years.
Magpie Mannikin. Purchased 1896, the cock died August
1900, the hen two years later--six years in captivity.
Bronze Mannikin. Specimens purchased in 1894 were
living in 1899, so that we can safely record five years for this
species.
Most of my Whydalis were kept at a time when I had not
thought of recording the exact dates of their purchase and death,
but I have noted the Combassou as long-lived.
Paradise Whydah. Purchased 1895, died 1909--fourteen
years : a record even for a hen of this species I think ; the males
have generally lived from three to four years.

I unfortunately kept no record of the dates when most of
liy various Meadow Starlings died : I know that Ageloeus frontalis
ived for some years, but both Dolichonyx oryzivora and Leistes
uperciliaris were short-lived ; the first living less than a year,
md the second I think between two and three years. Agelasticus
hilius I believe died in less than a year, but A. hunteralis(J)
ifter ten years in captivity was given to me in 1900 and is still
iving; its present age must be (at least) close upon 21.
Silky Cow-bird. Imported 1893, given away in exchange
[898; I have not heard how much longer they lived.
I believe my Military Troupials (De Filippi's) did not
ive more than about three years.
Common Hangnest. Purchased 1899 and still in excellent
lealth, having been in my possession nearly eleven years; a race
-f the latter given to me in December 1906 is also still in splendid

Bronze-necked Dove. Purchased June 1897, died about
1901, but I have no exact dates: about font yeais.
I had no means of telling how long my Half-collared Turtle

Moorhen, stretches its wings both together when taking this
nuscular exercise, instead of one at a time as other birds do.
Purpee Moorhen. Porphyriopoliocephalus.
This species puffs out its white under-tail-coverts when
courting or when angry, in both sexes. It also claps its wings
)ack to back at times. Like other Porphyrios I have watched, it
oses all its quills at once when moulting.

Stray Notes o?i ludia?i Birds.
Coot. Fulica atra.
An old cock of this species I kept moulted in winter, like
the Indian resident ducks ; no doubt resident individuals of the
Coot usually do this.
Common Crank. Grus communis.
This Crane moults all its quills at once, though the
Crowned Cranes of Africa ( Balearica ) seem not to do so.
Stone-curlew. CEdicnemus scolopax.
A specimen I kept cast at least one pellet during two days.
It swallowed--when this was half put in its mouth--a gecko
lizard about four inches long. It used, in alarm when approached
to lower and wag its tail.
Great Stone-plover. CEdicnemus recwvirostiis.
A very tame bird of this species, reared from a chick by
the person who sold it to us, was in the Calcutta Zoo. It used to
follow people round the Waterfowl aviary, and lower and wag its
tail like the above species, evidently not from fear in this case.
It also, like the tall Australian Stone-plover {Burhinus grallarius&apos;),
has the habit of occasionally rushing about with wings and tail
spread, as the European bird has been seen to do when wild.
Large Indian Pratincole or Swallow-plover.
Glareola orientalis.
I did not see any pellets cast by a specimen of this bird
which I fed on cockroaches.
Sociable Lapwing. Chettusia gregaria.
I found captive specimens of this bird would readily eat
boiled rice, though not soaked paddy. Though they also fed on
cockroaches and shrimps, I saw no pellets cast by them.
Eastern Golden Plover. Charadrius pluvialis.
In confinement this species would eat the fruit ot Tipari
{Physatis). It bores for worms, although short-billed, and is very
pugnacious when confined.
Black-winged Stilt. Himantopus Candidas.
In captivity this species will eat soaked canary-seed even
when provided with maggots, and the seed is fairly well digested ;
it appears to agree well with all waders which will eat it.
Curlew. Numenius arquata.
I saw, in 1899, a Curlew pass over the Calcutta Zoo (low

iown as to be easily identifiable) on July 20th, a curious date for
1 winter visitor as this is in India ; it was possibly attracted by
lie call of our captive bird.
Black-tailed God wit. Limosa behica.
o
Bland ford, quoting Jerdon, gives the bill as dull orange,
eddish at the base, dusky at the tip; I have found it pink, with
he tip black. He also says it is commonly sold as Woodcock in
he Calcutta Bazaar; but I seldom saw it there, and never heard
t so called there. My friend Mr. C. M. Inglis told me he had
:ept one for months on paddy only.
Bar-tailed Godwit. Limosa lapponica.
Of a pair in the London Zoo in 1901, the male came into
ummer plumage, but not the female. They were in the small
vaders' aviary in the Diving birds' house.
Wood Sandpiper. Totamis glareola.
In the winter of 1900-01 I got a pallid or semi-albino
pecimen of this bird in the Calcutta Bazaar.
Green Sandpipek. Totamis ochropus.
This species wags its tail like the Common Sandpiper,
vhicli the last-named bird does not.

too sure of this point, as we know that the White-crowned Pigeon
(C. leucocephala ) sometimes lays one and sometimes two at a
clutch. A pair that I have nested twice last year, each time
laying only one egg ; then, in the onlyjtwo instances that I know
of the Rufous Pigeon (C. rufind) breeding in captivity, only one
egg was produced at a sitting ; but we read in Novitates Zoo
logicse, Vol. XVI., p. 261, that Mr. S. Venturi found a single nesl
of C. rufina sylvestris , (which only differs from typical rufna b&gt;
having the basal portion of the tail blackish) with two eggs in it
This second young one also grew well, and first left the
nest on January 7th. One would hardly expect a bird from Nev\
Guinea, whose natural nesting season seems to be about June
to rear young in such weather as we have had--frost, snow, anc
rain,--but they may well be pardoned for failing to recognise the
late wet summer as our dry season ; so perhaps were expecting
better weather when the winter came on. When this youngste)
left the nest it was well fledged, the back of the neck, rump, anc
especially the triangular patch between the shoulders being of &amp;lt;
brilliant metallic green. I feel sure that this young one waj
brighter coloured than the first one; the wings were black with
hardly any green, white on throat not fully developed, as the chit
and space round the base of bill were still bare of feathers

for some time ; I believe it always roosts out in the open, wliat
ever the weather may be. The iris is now changing colour, anc
the green on the mantle is very intense; I notice there is a single
line of green-tipped feathers running obliquely across each wing
from the bend of the wing to the centre of the back, it is curvec
and is parallel to the edge of the mantle ; it is curious that there
should be this one row of adult-looking feathers across tin
otherwise black wing.
One of the reasons which finally led to the White-throatec
Pigeon being placed among the Cohimbince instead of with the
Caipophogince was the food, that it had twelve instead of fourteei
rectrices; it is therefore somewhat significant that my younges

REVIEW.
/OoroGicA : Scientific Contributions of the New York Zooi.ogicai,
Society for December 1909 and January 1910.
In these two numbers Mr. C. W. Beebe has published three
m port ant articles, the first of which, entitled c ' Ecology of the
loatzin " is of considerable interest for all Ornithologists; deal-
ug as it does with the history of the bird, its distribution, general
ppearance, parasites, food, nidification, enemies, and its reputed
vil smell.
Mr. Beebe has had exceptional opportunities for studying
his strange bird in Venezuela and British Guiana, and has taken
umerous photographs (reproduced in his article) illustrative of
s actions and nidification in a wild state.
With regard to the reputed disagreeable odour Mr. Beebe
ays :--" When skinning or dissecting one of these Hoatzins, one
otices the faintest of musky odors, not at all unpleasant, and
ideed perceptible only when the attention is directed to it. Our
pecimens were certainly most inoffensive in this respect, and
he flesh of one which we cooked and ate, while it was tough,
/as as clean and appetising as that of a Curassow."
The article concludes with a complete Bibliography of the
pecies. A second article in the same number is entitled "A11
)rnithological Reconnaissance of North-eastern Venezuela" and
/ill be most welcome, no doubt, to systematic Ornithologists,
/bile containing many field-notes of interest to Aviculturists.
In the January number is an article on " Racket formation
1 tail-feathers of the Motmots " which will serve to clear up the
isputed question as to whether or 110 these birds actually produce
he rackets themselves by biting off a part of the web to within
bout an inch of the end. It will be remembered that in the

Correspondence.
Ibis for 1895 Dr. Sclater, in a footnote to a review of Newton's
" Dictionary of Birds," observes--" There has been a specimen
of Momotus subrufescens living in the Zoological Society's Gardens
since May 6th, 1890. It reproduces its moulted tail-feathers in a
perfect state every year. The keeper in charge of it says that he
has never seen it nibble out the webs of the central rectrices (as it
ought to do), but that the pieces disappear gradually--he does
not know how."
Mr. Beebe seems never to have questioned that the spatules
were produced by the bird, and at first he tried an experiment
with a view to discovering whether the outer feathers were used
as a guide when the bird was denuding the central rectrices ; he
pulled out the latter and cut straight across the second and third
shorter pairs of tail feathers; the middle rectrices when repro-
duced were denuded at the same point as when the other feathers
were entire. Microscopic examination of the untrimmed feather
shows congenital weakness of the barbs at the place where
denudation takes place : in some cases the weak web seems to
adhere to the corneous sheath of the feather (which would
account for Newton's belief that in some Motmots the tail-feathers
are originally developed in a spatulate form) but in the majority
of cases the weakly attached barbs are broken away when the
bird is preening its tail-feathers, and are no more evidence oi
a taste for decoration in the Motmot than is the development ol
the nuptial plumage in many birds, by the breaking away of the
tips of the feathers of the prenuptial plumage.
There is a fourth short paper in the January part on "Three
cases of a supernumerary toe in the Broad-winged Hawk."

THE BLACK-HOODED PARRAKEET.
Psepholus cucullatus, North.
vSir,-- .Since I wrote the notes on Parrots at the Crystal Palace Show,
hicli were published in the last number of the Magazine, the Zoological
ociety has acquired a pair of the recent consignment of what were thought
&gt; be Golden-shouldered Parrakeets. The pair at the Palace struck me as
sing different to the specimens I had seen of P. chrysopterygius , and since
le arrival of a pair at the Zoological Gardens I have looked into the
ibject somewhat carefully.
P. chrysopterygius possesses a very distinct frontal band of yellow,
lis colour also surrounding the eye. The crown of the head is covered bv
black patch, which fades away into the grey of the back. In the
:centlv-imported birds, however, there is no yellow frontal band whatever,
le black of the crown extending forward to the bill, over the lores and
irrounding the eyes. I thought at first that these might belong to a form
iscribed in the P.Z.S. for 1908 by Professor Collett as P. dissimilis, but this
rd has a frontal band of brown.
I have, however, discovered the black-fronted birds in a note by Mr.
ortli in "The Victorian Naturalist," dated Feb. 6, 1909, where he describes
s inspection of a cage-full of these birds in Sydney, which had been
iptured in the Northern Territory of South Australia, some 200 miles
mth-East of Port Darwin. He gives a complete description of the birds,
Inch agrees absolutely with those which have recently reached this
*untry, and proposes for them, should they prove to be new, the name of
f ephotus cucullatus , the Black-liooded Parrakeet.
I think there is no doubt that this is a distinct form and that Mr.
ortli was justified in describing the species as new.
Mr. F. E. Blaauw tells me that he received some of these birds last
miner, doubtless those that Mr. North saw on their arrival in Sydney.
I cannot at present detect any difference in the female from that of
chrysopterygius. D. SkTh-SmiTh.

most likely the latter. Have the flat head with feathers like a cap, colour
sort of pale greeny brown, sparrow marked wings, white breasts and throats
and belly and a broad belt of same colour as body across the chest, stout
built birds and very vicious, kill all other birds. Feed on mixed seed,
millet, and like insects and soft food as well.
I wonder if they are the South American Sparrow.
If von can let me know in next issue of Avicultural Magazine, I shall
be obliged. I sent a description to another member, but he could not find
out what they were, and I want to sell them, they are such vicious birds.
I have a pair of them, and the hen is a fainter edition of the cock bird.
K. Warren Vernon.
[The description is too incomplete for certainty; but, if the cap is
black and if there is a white eyebrow-stripe (neither of which points are
noted in your description) I should say that your birds are DOtbignys
Tanagers, and therefore neither Grosbeaks nor Buntings. 1 he general
olive-green, or, as you say, greeny-brown colour and pectoral belt, and white
under surface, certainly seem to indicate that species , but I don t under-
stand the description "Sparrow marked wings" it is too vague. Do you
mean that they are crossed by white bars ? The true Sparrows are an Old-
World group, though the English House-Sparrow has been introduced
into America. D'Orbigny's Tanager is said to have black wings edged with
olive and with the bend of the wing yellow. A. G. BuTKER.]

By Frank Finn, B.A., F.Z.S., M.B.O.U.
1 he Mouse-birds or Colies ( Coliidac ) are a very peculiar
and isolated family of birds; the species are few, all much alike
in form and size--about that of a Sparrow, except for the long
tail--and confined to Africa south of the Sahara. They are
very arboreal in their habits; in the small experience I had of
them in Hast Africa, I never saw one on the ground, nor have
[ ever heard of their going there when wild. Their feet are
very peculiar, the first and fourth toes turning either forward
cr backward, so as to give a firm yet changeable grip; yet their
eg-joints seem very weak, for they straddle a great deal, and
;quat down on their stomachs like a bird whose feet are sore.
They generally sleep hanging up in a bunch, but not head
lown like the Hanging-parrakeets or Bat-parrots ( Loriculus ), the
lead being up at the level of the toes--feet upwards, but not
lead downwards, in fact. One would expect them to nest in
ioles, as they are rather parrakeet-like in some ways, but they
eally build open nests of twigs in a bush or tree. They are easy
subjects for aviculture, and of particular interest, because, in
pite of their ugly crawling movements and their dirtiness,
hey are worth breeding from a scientific point of view, as hardly
nything seems to be known about their young, except that these
re of the helpless type, and have down of the very scantiest
haracter, so that they are practically naked. In all Mouse-birds,
nfortunately, the sexes are alike, so that it is hard to select
airs. Their food consists chiefly of fruit and buds, with a few
usects ; so that they are easily suited with artificial food.

The Red-faced Mouse-bird.
Two species, both South African, are in the market at
present, the Striated Mouse-bird (Colins striatus ), and the Red-
cheeked (C. erythromeloji) figured in our illustration ; from this
the Striated may be easily distinguished by having the bill black
and grey and the eye-cere black, while the feet are dull dark red
instead of bright coral, and the plumage is dull drab with fine
pencilling.
For the following interesting notes on the much prettier
Red-faced species, I am indebted to our member Major B. R.
Horsbrugh :--
" I bad many of this species brought in to me by trappers
at both Potchefstroom (Transvaal) and Bloemfontein (O. R. C.)
but I found them dirty, greedy, and expensive to keep, so that
one day I released all I had except a pair that I brought home
in 1906 and presented to the Zoo.
They are perfectly easy to keep, any fruit does them for
diet, and they are not in the least quarrelsome with other
species. They have a very swift flight indeed, and look very
pheasant-like as they shoot along with their long thin pointed
tails carried stiffly behind them. The tail-feathers are very
hard and wiry indeed, and I do not think it has been observed
before that their skins are quite extraordinarily thick and
tough, so that they can hardly be torn by the hands in a fresh-
killed bird.
They are interesting birds in some ways and I can con-
fidently recommend them as inmates of a mixed aviary in this
country; but they will not stand cold at all, and die at once if
subjected to severe weather."
This species has been observed to line its nest with wild
cotton in seed, while the Striated uses green leaves; the latter
seems to lay pure white eggs, those of the Red-cheeked being
mottled and streaked with red.
Besides the above two species, the following have been
exhibited at the London Zoological Gardens :--
White-backed Mouse-bird {Colins capensis ); distinguished by
a white black-edged patch on the back, followed by a maroon
one; South African. This species nested in 1892 in one of
the large waggon-shaped flight cages in which these birds

were then kept in the London Zoo Parrot-liouse, two of them
sitting on several eggs in the same nest, as stated in the Ibis
for that year.
Chestnut-backed Mouse-bird (C. castanonotus)\ also with a
maroon patch on the back, but no white above it; West
African.
Beack-necked Mouse-bird (C. nigricollis&apos;) ; also West African ;
very like the Striated, but with black forehead and chin.
OUR SOCIETY AND ITS WORK.
By Dr. A. G. Butter.
Our Editor has asked me, as one of the original members
|of the Avicultural Society, to sketch our history and the work
done by our body since its inception : and although I feel sure
that others of our members would be far better able to do justice
to this subject than myself, I cannot be so churlish as to refuse
to do my best to enlighten certain outsiders who are seeking for
information.
It was in the summer or autumn of 1894 that Messrs.
H. R. Fillmer and C. S. Simpson of Brighton communicated with
Mr. Reginald Phillipps and myself with a view to founding a
Society for the study of British and Foreign Birds, both in
freedom and captivity. These gentlemen visited me at the
Natural History Museum at South Kensington and briefly dis-
cussed the objects of the Society, the means by which those
objects should be attained, and lastly the title by which it should
be known.
It was decided that, in order to encourage and assist one
mother in bird-study the members must have some means of
ntercommunication, in addition to that afforded by the post;
ind, as it would be impossible for us to hold general meetings,
t was agreed that a Journal should be published in monthly
Darts to which the members should be invited to contribute ;
bus not only recording their own successes and failures, their
hews on housing and feeding, with other matters of mutual
nterest, but at the same time bequeathing the results of their
[study for the benefit of their successors.

Dr. A. G. Butler,
As regards the title, the term " Fancy'* was at once rejected
as objectionable, and as applicable chiefly to those variations
from species produced by the agency of man; "Ornithology"
was decided to be too general a term ; I therefore suggested that,
as we proposed to deal with birds much as gardeners did with
flowers, and as the latter study was known as "Floriculture" and
" Horticulture," we might surely use the term "Aviculture " : this
term was eventually agreed upon, and our body issued its first
modest volume of 132 pages 011 November 1st, 1894.
Unfortunately the list of members which appeared in
Volume I. of the Avicultural Magazine included only fifty-two
individuals, and as at that time the entrance fee was but lialf-a-
crown and the subscription five shillings, it was not surprising
that it was impossible to afford illustrations either for this or
the second volume; although, by the end of 1895, the member-
ship had increased to 175, among the accessions to our body
being some of our most successful breeders.
With over two hundred members at the end of 1896, it was
possible to afford four coloured plates by scientific artists, as well
as one or two cuts to illustrate Volume III. ; and, from that time,
not only was the success of the Society assured, but there was a
marked improvement in the character of the work done by the
members: by the end of 1897 the membership numbered two
hundred and sixty-one, a very strong argument in favour of the
attractiveness of good coloured illustrations!
With the completion of Volume V. the annual subscription
became 7/6 ; the entrance fee however still remained 2/6. At that
time there was no increase in the number of plates, the member-
ship not having varied greatly since 1897.
The magazine continued gradually to increase in size and
importance ; so that Volume VIII. the last of the first series,
contained no less than 318 pages of text with seventeen illustra-
tions, including seven coloured plates ; and the expansion was
most strongly marked in this volume, which inaugurated the very
successful editorship of Mr. D. Seth-Smith: during the entire
reign of this energetic ruler the Magazine greatly prospered, as
indeed we have every reason to believe it will do in the hands
of his successor.

on our Society and its Work.
Of the very valuable work done by our Society there can
)e no question. Not only have numerous species been bred for
he first time by many of our members and thereby a knowledge
)f the life-history of the species has been completed, but iri
several cases disputed points have been satisfactorily cleared up.
vTrs. Johnstone's successes in breeding Fraser's Touracou have
hrown considerable light on the relationship of the Touracous
o the Hoatzin and to the Cuckoos, and Mr. Seth-Smith's studies
n breeding Hemipodes and Tinamous have established the
Dolyandrous character of these birds, a fact already indicated
&gt;ut not cleared up in the case of certain species by Lieut. Hautli
n Germany.
The zeal of some of our wealthy members has been the
Means of bringing to light new and interesting species of birds
diicli might otherwise have remained unappreciated for many
ears to come, and even an insignificant member like myself
las been permitted to clear up a few points of synonymy, as in
he cases of Q:ielea russi, Paroaria cervicalis and Petronia albigu-
iris, the first two being mere plumages, but the third at least a
istinct race.
The anatomical articles by Mr. Pycraft and those by Prof.
. O. Whitman and others of our American friends are all of
Dnsiderable scientific importance.
Lastly, in many cases where young have not been reared
1 captivity, it has been possible to secure young plumages,
erectly describe the eggs for the first time, and to deposit
becimens in the National Collection for the benefit of cabinet-
orkers.
Then, apart from the good work which we know to have
sen done, there are the ideas and suggestions which occur from
me to time to the student of living birds ; many of them per-
aps very ridiculous, but some of them perchance capable of
ading up to truth, and therefore worth recording : it does not
lswer to despise the day of small things or the feeble glimmer-
gs of light emitted from small minds, for behold how great a
atter a little fire kindleth!
The creation of our Society has produced a need for works
ialing with aviculture, and thus has kept some of us pretty

Mr. D. Seth-Smith,
busy; and the wish to give of our best to the public, has doubt-
less stimulated us to close and careful study, with the result that
both we and our readers have benefited by increased knowledge
of our subject.
Most of the coloured illustrations in the Avicultural Maga-
zine have been carefully copied from living birds, and thus the
natural actions of the different species and the correct outlines
of their bodies have been faithfully reproduced : this is often
quite impossible in the case of illustrations drawn from dried
skins, some of which are mere caricatures.
Although for some years past the annual subscription to
our Society has been ten shillings and the entrance fee half-a-
guinea, the value of the Magazine has so greatly increased both
as regards bulk, interest and the number of its illustrations that
the increase of its membership to close upon 450 is by no means
surprising; the only marvel is that more bird-lovers do not join
our ranks.

BRISBANE.
Although the time of my departure was drawing near, I
was most anxious if possible to make an expedition to Brisbane,
as I was well aware that some of the best and rarest of the fauna
which I hoped to obtain, had its home in Queensland. I had
moreover been in correspondence with a live-stock dealer named
Beard in Brisbane from whose letters I judged that a visit to that
town might result in some very valuable additions to my collect-
tion of living creatures.
The easiest way to travel to Brisbane, providing the
weather is calm, is by steamer, but the weather has a way of
being very rough round the Australian coast just at the time
when one has decided to travel, and the coastal boats, although
excellent in many ways, are somewhat noted for their capacity for
rolling. The N.S.W. Government having, moreover, generously
granted me a pass 011 their railways, I decided without hesitation
to travel by train.

The train journey occupies about thirty hours, the distance
)eing nearly 600 miles. I left Sydney at 5.10 p.m. on February
:9th, arriving in Brisbane about n p.m. the following evening.
Some of the scenery is most beautiful, especially the first part as
me approaches the Hawkesbury River and obtains numerous
glimpses of large expanses of water surrounded by forest and
lotted with islets. Much of the country consists of rocky
ground, thickly covered with bush, which is absolutely useless
or cultivation, but ideal as a sanctuary fordhe native fauna.
The greyish foliage of the Eucalyptus is now and then
elieved by a patch of feathery whiteness--a gum-tree in full
lower. The same trees do not bloom every year, but every year
ome trees are in bloom, and apparently at almost all times of
he year, and these flowering trees provide an abundant supply
&gt;f food for the honey-eating birds of which Australia possesses
o many species. This inaccessible country also unfortunately
&gt;rovides ample shelter for the introduced fox, which is becoming
curse by its ravages not only amongst the native mammals and
ground birds--the Lyre-bird and Mallee-bird in particular--but
mongst the flock-owners' lambs.
At Newcastle, the colliery town of New South Wales, we
lad to turn out of the train and snatch a hurried dinner, for the
Government has not yet seen the advantage of providing dining
ccommodation 011 its trains. We reached Wallangarra on the
)tieensland Border the following morning, and here passengers
lust change, as the gauge of the Queensland railways is narrower
lian that of the older state, which has adopted the standard
English gauge of rail.
O11 the Queensland side the railway crosses the Darling
)owns, winding in and out among the hills, and much of the
cenery is very beautiful.
I saw several Wallabies as they hopped away at the side of
ae line, and on one occasion a splendid pair of Australian
lustards or "Wild Turkeys" rose from the plain and flew for
erhaps half a mile, alighting in a field still within view of the
rain.
We passed through country which is badly infested by the
rickly pear, this plant nearly covering the ground in places

Mr. D. Seth-Smith,
and spoiling the pasture land. The Emu, I am told, is accused
of distributing the seed of this plant, and in consequence these
fine birds are being killed off in many districts.
Arriving in Brisbane late at night, I put up at an Hotel
close to the Botanical Gardens, and through my open window
heard the weird squeakings of the numerous Fruit-bats
or "Flying Foxes" which fed on the fruit of the Moreton
Bay fig trees, of which many fine specimens were growing
within a stone's throw. The noise of hundreds of frogs in these
gardens, which every night set up a regular concert, will also
remain long in my memory.
Mr. Beard, the animal dealer, had promised to procure me
what he could, and I took an early opportunity of calling upon
him. In his shop, however, I saw nothing but domestic pigeons
and rabbits, which was not encouraging. He assured me, how-
ever, that he could procure me some very good animals, and that
he already had some of the beautiful Parry's, or, as they are
locally called "Pretty-faced" Wallabies, and some Brush Tur-
keys for me.
He told me that he knew of a pair of the Beautiful
Parrakeet (.Psephoius piilcherrimus) in captivity which he hoped
to be able to secure. This species appears to be very local, and
he knew of a place where a pair regularly bred each year. It is
locally known as the " Elegant Parrakeet."
A story he related to me of the Squatter Pigeon ( Geophaps,
scripta) presents an aspect of the character of some of the
Australian so-called sportsmen which is anything but sportsman-
like. Three years before my visit these Ground Doves had
been very numerous in the neighbourhood, and he received no
less than 400 of them from the catchers. He offered them to the
Sydney dealers, who declined them ; but a party of pigeon
shooters bought the entire lot, all of which they used in shooting
matches ! When one remembers how rarely this, the handsome
Partridge Bronzewing, is seen in this country, and how glad
private aviculturists and European Zoological Gardens would
be to obtain specimens, one can only be horrified at this wanton
destruction.
The Brisbane Botanical Gardens are very well laid out

with many kinds of beautiful tropical and semi-tropical vege-
tation such as Palms of all kinds and masses of giant Bamboo.
The beautiful scarlet Hibiscus was in full flower, and, I watched
with much delight a lovely blood-red Honey-eater (Myzomela
sanguinolenta) sucking at the flowers and flying from one to
another, almost putting the brilliant flowers themselves in the
shade by his brilliance.
There was a small collection of animals in these gardens,
but nothing of special interest except perhaps a Banksian
Cockatoo, which I, with some difficulty, persuaded the authorities
to let me take home. Emus, and a nice collection of Wallabies,
always attracted the public, and it struck me what a splendid
Zoological Garden could be run in so ideal a climate, and in a
country containing so many interesting forms of animal life.
As I was looking at these creatures one afternoon, I heard
overhead the cries of Lorikeets, and looking up saw two large
locks of Swainson's Lorikeets, orobablv each containing some
Ifty birds or so, flying very rapidly, the bright sunshine showing
1 blaze of colour on their brilliant undersides. So common are
hese birds in the neighbourhood, that I was able to buy a cage
nil, containing fifty birds, for the sum of thirty shillings. I
anded thirty-one of these birds safely and they made a fine
.how during the summer in the London Zoo.
The Sacred Kingfisher was always to be found at the side
&gt;f a pond surrounded with bamboos, a spot which also was the
eeding ground of several of the elegant Pied Grallinas.
Brisbane has a very fair museum, where I saw a collection
i"f Queensland animals that was extremely good numerically,
&gt;ut the labelling was by 110 means faultless and many of the
ases were very badly arranged.
Brisbane hopes also to have a Zoo. one day ; at least a few
nthusiasts are trying their best to get one. I saw the proposed
ite, which was good, and I only hope they may have their Zoo.

ountrv contains, of which the average settler is woefully
gnorant.

NESTING OF THE RED-WHISKERED BULBUL
( Oloco?npsa jocosa ).
</sectionHeader>

By W. E. Teschemaker, B.A.
I have found this quite an interesting species and have
noted several points in connection with its nesting habits and
sexual distinctions which would be worth discussing if space
permitted, but the last two accounts I contributed to our Maga-
zine were so long that I must on this occasion be more brief.
Although I have had various individual Bulbuls at one
time or another I never tried my hand at breeding them until
last summer. Nearly all the Bulbuls are dangerous in a mixed
community, but O. jocosa appears to be a somewhat notable ex-
ception. It is distinctly a sociable bird, and I think might be
safely trusted in any aviary. One of mine struck up a close
friendship with a Magpie Tanager, and did not seem the least
afraid of the latter's formidable hooked beak and hawk-like
yellow eye. Several pairs will nest in close proximity in the
same aviary and, as we shall see in the course of this narrative,
two hens will even share a nest.
Bulbuls seem to offer a promising field to the would-be-
medallist, because, although there are more than fifty species of
this family in India alone (if we include local races), I believe
only one species besides O* jocosa has fully reared young in this
country, namely, P. haemorrhous. Yet they seem generally
anxious to breed, and at least three species (the Syrian, Philip-
pine and White-eared) have incubated.
The subject of our present notice ranges from the Hima-
layas to Assam and throughout Burma and S. China, and has at
least two local races :
(i.) O. enteria, from Bengal.
(ii.) O.fuscicaudata , from Southern India.
The former of these is the most frequently imported, and is
distinguished by the white tips of its tail-feathers and by the
dark necklace being broken in the centre. There was a large
importation of this species in 1909, which were retailed by the
trade at the not extravagant figure of three shillings and six-
pence each. The first thing that struck one on looking through
this consignment was that they ran in two distinct sizes. I

elected two of each size and will not go further into the matter
hail to say that I fancy that the two large birds were a pair
nd the two small birds were two hens.
First nest. Although all birds try to hide their nesting
perations from us, they are as a rule singularly unsuccessful,,
ecause the aviarist can generally tell by a mere glance whether
bird is going to lay, has laid, is incubating, or has hatched.
Tow and again I go through the aviaries with a good big stick
a case any bird should be " playing possum." I bush-whacked
lie Bulbuls' aviary (which by the way was only 17ft. by 10ft.)
arly in June and only succeeded in beating out two Bulbuls : a
unt for corpses produced no results, and therefore I could only
onclude that the other two Bulbuls were actually sitting. I
xamined the shrubs carefully, but they contained no nests. I
len gave each shrub a thorough shaking--and the mystery was
olved. A dead branch of a Cupressus was leaning against the
r ire netting, and between the two and not attached in any way
) either was the nest, containing six eggs and with the two
lissing Bulbuls sitting side by side.
Capt. Perreau tells me that our friend Whiskers is regarded
1 his own country as a bit of a fool : he falls unsuspectingly into
le most elementary trap and builds his nest in the most con-
ficuous and ill-chosen places. It is evident to me however that,
though Whiskers may not be born wise, he acquires wisdom
ith great facility. I never saw a better hidden nest than this,
id what especially impressed me was that its constructors must
ave realized that their only chance of success was to conceal
from the malevolent eyes of the pair of White-crested Jay
brushes in the same aviary, because the third, fourth and fifth
-Sts were built in ordinary situations. Perhaps someone may
;k how can any stupid species be abundant in a land of hawks,
lakes, crows, cats, mongooses and fowlers. I expect our friend
r hiskers succeeds by perseverance. If he loses a nest he does
ot sit in sackcloth and ashes : he sets to work at once and
arts another. It must be understood that Capt. Perreau is res-
msible for the above estimate of the intelligence of Whiskers:
^rsonally I have found him most wary, secretive and suspicious.
1 1904, and again in 1905, I had communal nests of the Indian

Mr. W. E. Teschemaker,
Avadavat, the two liens incubating and feeding the young jointly
and in perfect amity, and the young were fully reared, but this
nest was not so fortunate : in a few days' time the eggs were
thrown out and broken. They were all fertile and had been
incubated apparently about a week.
Second nest. I now removed the Jay Thrushes and Pekin
Robins and left the four Bulbuls in undisturbed possession of the
aviary. I do not seem to have made any notes about the second
nest, and all I can remember about it is that the eggs were laid
in the same nest and again thrown out after a few days' incu-
bation. The eggs are smaller than one would expect, and are
closely covered with small red and purplish spots, closely re-
sembling one type of egg of the House-sparrow and of much the
same size (90 mm x 62 111m). The usual clutch appears to be
three.
Third nest. Another nest was now commenced in the very
top of another shrub about five feet from the ground. These
Bulbuls are said to buiid small neat nests, but tliose-I have seen
have been very loosely compacted of hay and unlined, probably
owing to want of suitable materials. Once more three eggs were
laid and incubation commenced on the 14th July. As it was
evident that the two (or more) hens were jealous, I tried, hard to
ascertain which birds had constructed this nest--but in vain.
They were so extraordinarily secretive that I could never get a
glimpse of them whilst pairing or building. I therefore deter-
mined to remove all but the one actually incubating, and even this
proved a very difficult matter because she (or he) would always
slip away into the thickest covert, when put off the nest, and thus
elude identification. However, I at last ascertained that it was
the largest Bulbul which was sitting, and I at once removed the
other three. Two young were hatched on the 23rd, after the
unusually short period of nine days' incubation. The young were
quite naked and grew with astonishing rapiditj&apos;. On the 25th,
after a night of continuous rain, the nest collapsed, but I fixed
it up again and lashed it firmly in place, for which assistance
Whiskers seemed very grateful. O11 the 27th, the wind piped up
to a gale from the S.W., and it rained in torrents for twelve
consecutive hours. This unlucky day cost me two medals. I

svas away from home for a few days, so poor Whiskers had no
assistance whatever in sheltering and feeding the young and, as
vas only to be expected, they succumbed.
Fourth nest. I felt quite sure from what I had seen of
he perseverance of the Whiskers family that they would have
*mother try, so I drafted back two of the three I had recently
emoved. Not having any idea as to which were males and
vhicli females I selected the other large bird and one small one.
ly the iotli August the Bulbuls were incubating another clutch
*f three eggs, which hatched on the 19th ; but a day of continuous
ain on the 20th was too much for the young birds.
Fifth nest. These untoward events seemed to indicate
hat the young required warmth and some shelter from the rain,
o I fixed up a basket-nest and a rain screen, the advantages of
/hicli the Bulbuls were not slow to recognise, for they soon had
wo more young in hand, and these, when I left home on the
2nd Sept., were growing apace. I returned on the 5th October,
nd was told there had been an epidemic of some sort amongst
lie fruit-eating birds, and that all the Bulbuls except one were
ead. I was, therefore, not a little astonished to discover two
vely little Bulbuls sitting side by side in the middle of a clump
f privet. Although they were tiny little things they had well
eveloped crests, white cheeks, and, in fact, resembled the adults
1 every respect, except that the under tail-coverts were paler
nd the necklace only faintly indicated. By the 18th Oct. the
ecklace was quite distinct. O11 the iotli Nov. I caught up the
oung Bulbuls and brought them into the house, and I then noted
lat, whereas in the adults the four outer rectrices 011 each side
e tipped with white, in the young only the outer rectrix was
) marked. I was glad to find a good home for the youngsters
id their sole surviving parent with one of our members. It is
iteresting to note that the surviving parent was the second
rgest bird, and therefore, if it was a female, as one would infer
0111 its size, the other large bird, which incubated the third
utcli of eggs and took sole charge of the young, must have
ien a male. However, as I said before, I am not at all sure
hat the sexes of any of the four Bulbuls really were.
When I look back upon the many vicissitudes which these

Mr. T. H. Newman,
young Bulbuls underwent, the terrible weather of last September
and October, the gales of wind, the long cold nights, and the
many days when I .$aw them huddled together in a soaking
downpour of rain, when I reflect that they were reared by a
single parent, and that that parent only escaped death from
contagious disease by a fluke, I can only repeat the remark of
the Duke of Wellington anent a certain great and historic battle
--"it was a deuced close run thing."

By T. H. Newman, F.Z.S., M.B.O.U.
I think we all like to read about wild birds, and in fact it
seems to me almost the duty of anyone who keeps birds, to try
and find out what has been written about their natural habits,
what sort of country they inhabit, what is the lowest temperature
they are subjected to, and so forth. I am sure many of our
members must from time to time come across interesting birds
during their travels, but a glance down the " Contents" columns
of the volumes of our Magazine, does not show that many have
given us their experiences; this must, therefore, be my excuse
for jotting down these few notes about the birds I met with
during a recent five weeks' tour to Tunis and through Algeria,
although they only deal with the commonest species.
As I did not decide to go until it was nearly time for
starting, I had not much opportunity beforehand to read up
about what sort of birds I was likely to come across. Many very
interesting papers dealing with the ornithology of this region
appeared in the earliest volumes of The Ibis , and latterly Mr.
Whitaker has contributed a series of articles which have cul-
minated in his two beautiful volumes on "The Birds of Tunisia."
I was greatly indebted to this work when compiling these notes,
and have generally followed the nomenclature there used ; as
unfortunately I found these books too heavy to take with me, my
modus operandi was to tick off all the species, as far as possible,
mentioned by Mr. Whitaker, in Mr. Dresser's " Manual of Palse-
arctic Birds." I also made a list of the species of especial in terest;
in this way, when a bird was clearly seen, it was nearly always

o
&gt;ossible at least to determine the family to which it belonged,
nd a glance down the species marked in the Manual generally
es ulted in the exact identification. I cannot imagine anyone
ailing to be greatly edified by a visit to this part of the world,
vhich presents so many varied objects of interest; but no one
vll * does llot care ^ the feathered inhabitants of a country can
ealise what a vastly added delight there is in coming across
*irds which aie either quite unknown or rare with us, and of
bserving them under conditions very different from those at
ome.
Our party was a small one, consisting only of three others
esides myself, which often gave me opportunities for lookin*.
nt for birds which I should not have had had we been a larger
timber.
We started on 12th of November last. On the way down
) Dover I noticed a few Lapwings ( Vanellus vane/lus) and Black-
eaded Gulls (Lams ridibundus) in the fields. We had a good
tossing to Calais, though it was rather cold and inclined to min ;
flock of Gulls followed the boat, among which were recognised
tie Lesser Black-backed (L. fuscus ) and a few Black-headed ;
lere were some also which looked like Common Gulls (L. cairns),
s we neaied Calais, four Gannets (Sula bassana ) were seen ;
)ine were flying just over the surface of the water, while others
ere at a considerable height. Gulls also became more numerous,
gain apparently mostly Common, though there seemed to be
*me young Herring-Gulls (Lams argentatus ) among them.
Ihe 13th was spent in Paris; we were quite glad to leave
behind in the evening after a damp and very muddy day.
We leached Marseilles early next morning in brilliant
nsliine. After lunch I took the opportunity to visit the Zoo;
is small, though prettily laid out in the upper part of the City,
* hind the Palais de Longecamp; beautiful trees and shrubs
liming by 110 means the least attractive feature. It is under the
mie management as the Jardin d'Acclimatation at Paris, and
rves as a resting-place for animals destined either for Paris
for exportation. There were not very many birds; the first
be seen were two Flamingoes (.Phocnicopterns roseus ) in a
it of giotto; some Canada Geese were in a pond with a fine

waterfall at the back. Under the arches of a viaduct which rum
across the gardens, were a fine pair of Condors and some very
perfect Bearded and Griffon Vultures. In another part of the
gardens were four Ostriches, one being a cock, a couple of Rheas,
and two young Emus. A range of aviaries contained a few oi
the commoner species of Pheasants and some common Peafowls,
some being white ; a quantity of domestic Pigeons and Poultry are
also kept; among the latter were several cocks of the curious
naked-necked variety. In another row of small aviaries were a
nice Hobby ( Falco subbuleo ) and some Kestrels ( Tinnunculm
tinnunculus ), apparently newly arrived, as they were very wild
and kept flying against the bars and uttering screams; there were
also some Barn and Eagle Owls. Some Magpies shared one com-
partment with a Jackdaw, said to have been obtained in France,
which showed very pale grey, almost white on the sides of the
neck. Two Macaws, together with some of the commoner
Cockatoos, a Lesser Vasa Parrot, also a Blue-fronted Amazon,
were on perches hung under some trees; elsewhere I came
across a Crowned Crane (Bolearzcapavonina), a couple of Wood-
Ibises (probably African) a Great White Egret and some Purple
Gallinules. In a grassy enclosure were some Gulls of several
species, some fine White Storks, a female Australian Sheld-duck,
an Egyptian Goose, a pair of Black Swans, and what I took to
be a Shag; it had a distinct crest at the back of its head, which I
should hardly have expected at this date. Yet another range oi
four or five enclosures contained a number ot Barbary Doves, a
Common Turtle-dove and a hybrid Turtle x Barbary; a quantity
of Java Sparrows, some Weavers, and a few other small birds
occupied another of the compartments. I noticed an Emerald-
spotted Dove--or had it purple spots?--a number of Barred
Doves, and, most interesting of all, a Dove which I believe to
have been an Aldabran Turtle-dove (Turtur aldabranus) from its
resemblance to the Madagascar Turtle ( 7 &apos;. picturatus )--(see Avic.
Mag ., Vol. VI., N.S., p. 79)--being of the same purple vinous
tint as that species, but having the head also of this colour
instead of grey, it seemed also a little smaller ; it was very like
the plate in P.Z.S. 1871. A Half-collared Turtle-dove was bully-
ing it. The most noteworthy Mammal seemed to be a white

iind, probably a Red Deer ; she had I believe pink eyes, there
vas a curious brown patch on one flank, and a yellowish tinge
urrounded the tail. Rater in the afternoon we visited the rocky
slet of the Chateau d'lf. I saw some Gulls flying near the
Island but did not identify the species.
O11 the ]5th, we embarked at midday for Tunis; a large
lock of Yellow-legged Herring-Gulls (Laws cachumans&apos;), mostly
dult birds--but some young ones in the mottled grey plumage
oubtless belonged to the same species--also a few Black-headed
hills, followed 11s. I watched them from the stern of the boat
3r some time ; the Yellow-legged form of Herring-Gull differs
Iso from our bird by having a darker grey mantle : the bright
ellow bills and feet of the adult birds were very conspicuous,
ix or seven continued to follow until darkness came on.
Owing to the rough and wet weather I did not come on
eck until late next morning, which was a matter for regret, as
arlier in the day we had passed along near the Western coast of
ardinia, and as this is one of the chief breeding places of the
ire and beautiful Audouin's Gull (L. aiidoumi ) it was here if
tiywhere that I had hoped to see it ; but, although I kept a good
&gt;ok out for a pale grey Gull with a coral-red bill with a black
and, I never saw one. About a dozen Yellow-legged Herring
nils were in sight: they kept close behind the ship. During
le early part of the afternoon the African coast was sighted; a
mg line of irregular hills ending in the low promontory of Cape
artliage, which we rounded soon after dark, and steamed slowly
ong the canal through the El-Bahira Rake, getting some pretty
fects in the water from the reflected lights which dotted the
hole shore 011 our right, while a crescent moon, partly hid by
ouds, hung low down just ahead, above which Venus blazed
ightly. We landed at Tunis just before eight o'clock.
It can be imagined with what eagerness next morning,
most before it was light, I seated myself by the window and
oked out to see what birds were stirring. A few nondescript
wls were visible in a neighbouring yard, flocks of domestic
Igeons were also seen circling round ; presently a large Gull
speared, which was later on followed by a whole flock flying
Igh overhead. Some Sparrows were observed perching 011 some

Mr. T. H. Newman,
telegraph wires; when one flew nearer it seemed to have a
chestnut-coloured crown, so I took it to be a Spanish Sparrow
(Passer hispa?iiole?isis&apos;), as I knew Mr. Whitaker had stated that
this was the common Sparrow of Tunisia. Here I will pause
to make a few remarks about the Sparrows I met with ; they were
*certainly the most generally distributed birds I saw, being met
with everywhere ; numerically I must have seen more Sparrows,
with the possible exception of Crested Larks, than any other birds.
I devoted a considerable time to watching them, and confess
myself much puzzled ; they were as a rule not nearly so tame as
ours at home, and objected to being watched. Certainly at least
two types of Sparrows were common ; there were those with dis-
tinct chestnut crowns, which were always seen in or near towns,
and which, knowing Mr. Whitaker's opinion, and that most surely
he should know, I always gaily put down as Spanish Sparrows;
but on looking up figures of the Italian and Spanish Sparrows in
Dresser's "Birds of Europe," I find that while many of the birds
I saw very closely resembled the former, I certainly never noticed
a bird with so much black on the breast and flanks as depicted
for the latter. When Canon Tristram wrote in The Ibis for 185c
\0x25A0" On the Ornithology of Northern Africa," he was of opinion
that the form which was found in the towns, with habits resem-
bling our own bird, was the Italian Sparrow ( P . italics), while
the Spanish Sparrow, though very abundant, especially in the
salt marshes, and always breeding near water, avoided in Africa
as a rule, the habitations of men, and in habits differed greatl}
from the House Sparrow (P. domesticus). O11 the other hand, Mr
Whitaker has no hesitation in saying that the Spanish Sparrow
is the common species both in towns and in the open country
and is doubtful if the Italian species occurs in Tunis, in wliicl
supposition he is doubtless correct. It seems that both these
chestnut-crowned forms vary considerably in different localities
and that the Italian form sometimes approaches the Hous^
Sparrow in all but the colour of the crown ; all these form*
appear to breed together indiscriminately wherever they happei
to meet. Then there was a Sparrow which I often saw awaj
from the towns, generally when there were only a few building. 4

:rown and only a small black patch on the throat; I used to put
liese down as Tree Sparrows (P. montanus ), but Mr. Whitaker
*ays this species is not common in Tunisia, and that it is rather
are in Algeria.
The morning was spent exploring the higher part of the
own. Tunis is too well known, neither is this the place, for a
iescription ; it is sufficient to say that the modern French town
;xtends from the harbour along the shores of the lagoon of
il-Bahira, the so-called Take of Tunis, occupying the flat neigh-
bouring land, behind which is situated the ancient native quarter
&gt;n somewhat higher ground. I saw two bird-shops, which, how-
ever, had nothing of more interest to show than a few Canaries
md a very tame Blue-fronted Amazon Parrot. The streets are
r eiy narrow, mostly paved with rough stones ; many were covered
&gt;ver with arched roofs like arcades ; the native Bazaars or Souks
re even more Oriental and picturesque than those of Cairo or
Constantinople. The shops are small square places open in
rout; the proprietor squats on one side surrounded by his
7 oods.
In the afternoon we visited the Palace known as the Bardo,
idiicli is about two miles outside the town ; it is surrounded by
;ardens containing many beautiful flowering shrubs and trees,
moug which a large flock of Sparrows were making a great noise
ike their relatives at home before going to roost; they were
ather shy and so hidden among the leaves that I could not get a
,ood view of them, but two I saw on the building seemed to have
hestnut-coloured crowns, so very likely they were all Spanish
Sparrows.
The 18th was a bright morning after heavy rain, which
jiade the streets very muddy. In the morning I came across
notlier bird-shop with a quantity of Canaries ; one cage con-
lined several Serin Finches ( Serinus serums) and a hen North
kfrican Greenfinch (. Ligurians chlo?is aura? it liven t? is ) which I
7 as veiy pleased to see, as it was one of the birds I was anxious
) meet with ; I shall have something more to say of these birds
iter on, as I afterwards came across both species at large. A
Goldfinch ( Carduelis carduelis ) occupied another cage. There
'as also a Blackbird : I was not able to notice any difference in

Mr. T. H. Newman,
the Blackbirds I saw from those witli ns, but the resident form
has a larger and stouter bill, and the hens are greyer than our
bird. I heard Blackbirds several times, but they were always
very wild, and I was never able to get more than a glance at the ]
birds as they dived into cover ; the North African form is known i
as the Moorish Blackbird (Turdus menila viauritanica). Later i
on I saw another Goldfinch, this time a young bird, in a small
cage hanging outside a shop. In the afternoon we took the
Galetto motor train for Carthage; the line runs along a raised
embankment right across the El-Bahira Lagoon, alongside of
which the canal has been constructed which now joins Tunis
to Galetto, and so connects it with the open sea. Small birds
were fairly numerous along the line, and I also saw a small flock
of Waders, which flew alongside the train over the water; they
were probably Dunlins (Tringa alpma), or Knots {T. canutus)A
but from the motion of the train it was impossible to identify
them for certain. A row of posts projected out of the water at
intervals near the line on the left side of the train, almost every
one of which served as a perch for a Cormorant (.Phalacrocorax
carbo ) ; one had its wings extended in the usual attitude assumed
by this bird when drying itself in the sun. This habit of perch-
ing on posts here seems to have been indulged in from time
immemorial, as Salvin saw them sharing the posts with the
Ospreys in 1857, and Mr. Whitaker says that they may often
be seen in winter at El-Bahira perching on the posts in the
shallower parts. Just before we left the vicinity of the Lake we
were fortunate enough to see a beautiful flock of some seventy
to a hundred Flamingoes standing in the shallow water
in a long irregular line, their beautiful pink plumage making a
lovely contrast against the blue water. Flamingoes, though not
so common as formerly, still frequent both this Lagoon and the
smaller one of Sebka es-Sedjoumi to the south-west of the town
in considerable numbers during the winter months ; they do not,
however, remain to breed here.
On arriving at Carthage we began to inspect the ruins;
this was a most glorious day, it was quite hot, in fact this was the
only really warm day we had during the whole five weeks. We
first went into the well-preserved amphitheathre where S. S.

^erpetua and Felicitas and their companions were martyred in
he year 203 in the persecution under the Emperor Severus ;
lere I saw a large green Lizard, over a foot long, run under some
tones; large Grasshoppers with red or green wings, Dragonflies
nd other insects were very numerous. We then saw the Theatre,
n which a number of Wagtails, apparently Motacilla flava, were
lisporting themselves ; I also noticed a small flock of Pipits,
vhicli, from their well-spotted breasts, I take to have been
i?ithuspra/e?isis, as the Meadow Pipit is a common winter migrant
o North Africa. The remainder of the time was spent viewing
ome of the other ruins, which are numerous and extensive. A
;&gt;eautiful garden surrounds the chapel of S. Louis; a fine blue
Convolvulus was a conspicuous feature, growing over many of
he houses and covering fences. Just before sunset we drove
0 the charmingly-situated Arab village of Sidi-bou-Said, and
scended the lighthouse 011 Cape Carthage, from which a most
xquisite view of the entire Gulf of Tunis was obtained, with a
Jorious sunset behind Tunis ; as the Bats were already on the
ving, we hurried back to the carriage and drove in the dusk to
&apos;artliage Station. As we passed through a grove of Olive trees
flock of birds, about the size of Pigeons, flew by, but it was too
ark to see what they were ; and directly afterwards a large light-
poking bird, probably an Owl, was caught sight of. At Cape
&apos;artliage I saw a few bright-coloured Sparrows, but, on the whole,
&apos;irds seemed wonderfully scarce.
Next morning we visited the Belvedere Gardens, which
re situated on the steep slopes of a hill, from the top of which
ne views of the Gulf, with Carthage in the distance, can be
btained ; the gardens are extensive and contain many fine trees,
'alms, and flowering shrubs : Oleander and Plumbago being in
loom everywhere. I watched some Sparrows, which did not
eem so chestnut on the head as those in the town ; there were
aany birds among the trees, but they were difficult to see. I
id, however, get a glimpse of a grey-looking bird, which kept
ttering a loud note; I am nearly sure it must have been a
Uackcap (Sylvia atricapilla ); the Blackcap can be found here
uring the entire year. I afterwards walked up to the Bab Sidi
Abdullah, an old gate-way situated in the higher part of the

Mr. T. H. Newman,
town ; through the double arches again charming views across
the Bay were seen. In cages just beside the gate were two small
rather brightly- coloured Goldfinches and a very fine Nortli-
African Greenfinch cock, of a beautiful yellowish-green colour.
While I was here two Swallow-birds flashed by without giving
me time to identify them.
In the afternoon I strolled down in the direction of the
harbour, passing flocks of Sparrows, which were rather wild ; the
cocks had not much chestnut on the head ; they may have
been ordinary House Sparrows, but seemed neater than our
birds. A number of Gulls were seen in the distance flying over
the water. I skirted the shore of the Lagoon, and watched some
Waders feeding on a broad mud-flat; I think they must have
been Dunlins; among them were two very small Gulls, one
being immature, with a blackish band on the end of the tail;
they were evidently Little Gulls {Lams minuius&apos;). They did not
seem to be feeding; one hardly moved at all during the whole
time I was watching; it just stood in the shallow water, the other
flew about a little. A few Yellow-legged Herring-Gulls were
also flying about. I then mounted a steep stony green hill;
small birds were numerous but very wild, I saw one flock in the
distance, which must have contained some hundreds of indi-
viduals. Everywhere I went the birds seemed wilder than with
us, no doubt because so many are shot for eating ; it made it very
difficult to make out the species, especially as I am not much
used to identifying wild birds. There was a tremendous wind
blowing on the top of the hill, which made me not inclined to
linger there ; on the very top I saw a large Locust. As I was
descending the other side a small dark-grey-looking Hawk dashed
round a corner; I expect it was a Merlin (Falco cesalcni), but it
might have been a Hobby ; this was the first Bird of Prey I had
seen.
The 20th was spent in the train ; as we had some eleven
hours of travelling to get through, an early start was made and
Tunis was left behind at 7.16. At first the country was flat with
hills in the distance; soon it became more undulating, with
numerous rough bushes, some of which were covered with pink
or mauve blossoms ; a beautiful low-growing bright blue Iris was

common, as well as other flowers. Presently we came to the
Vledjerdah River and kept by it for a considerable distance, it
Irst flowed through muddy looking banks, but as we got higher
lie country became more wild, the river banks higher and more
itony; then we passed through extensive cork forests which
cover many acres, and later on the forests which are said to be
he last home of the Algerian Red Deer, for by this time we
lad passed out of Tunisia into Algeria. About here the line makes
&gt;ome remarkable bends, so that the same view may often be seen
irst from one side of the train and then the other. A very
orilliant sunset was remarkably fine seen over the mountains
vitli masses of dark purplish chocolate clouds; we reached
Eammam Meskoutine, our destination, about 6 o'clock.
During the day I noticed the following birds : just after
eaving Tunis we passed close to the inner lake of Sebka es-
Sedjoumi, where Waders were flying over the mud flats and
several flocks of Flamingoes could be seen scattered over more
listant parts of the lagoon. A few small birds, generally in
locks, were noticed from time to time flying over the low scrub ;
t saw one medium-sized and four small Hawks ; a bird which
ooked like a Buzzard flew past while we were having lunch, and
ust after we had changed trains at Duvivier, when it was begin-
ling to get dusk, a large bird, probably an Eagle, flapped past
he station, but on the whole very few birds were seen all day.
The 21 st was spent at Ham mam Meskoutine ; this remark-
able place deserves a brief description. It is situated on the line
)etween Bona and Duvivier ; there is simply an hotel there in
connection with the baths, the place getting its notoriety from
he wonderful boiling springs of sulphur and iron water, which
leposit most curious limery cones wherever they have bubbled
ip out of the ground ; some of these cones must be thirty feet
ligli, and resemble small extinct volcanoes as they have a hollow
ort of crater running down their centres. There are more than
me hundred scattered about. At present the hot water, after
lowing over some beautiful terraced formation like white marble,
&gt;ours down in streams over a great mass of lime-stone and forms
he Grand Cascade. Where the water is flowing the rock is of
he purest white, but it is stained a rusty red in other places from

the iron in the water; dense clouds of steam rise above, and
when seen in bright moon-light, as I first saw it, the whole effect
is most weird and peculiar. The hot water flows away forming a
pebbly stream at the bottom of a beautiful sheltered valley, the
steep sides of which are covered with a luxuriant growth of almost
tropical vegetation ; in the steamy atmosphere great Palms
flourish, tangled thickets of low growing shrubs, mostly thorny,
clothe theslopes, clumps of small Bamboos form thickets,Oleander
and Tamarisk bushes grow close to the water, and Cyclamens were
in full bloom among the rocks. I spent the morning watching the
birds ; the valley seems to be a perfect paradise for them, the
bushes being full of birds. Many Warblers were wintering here;
I think I heard the Chiff-chaff and Grasshopper Warbler, and
thought I saw a Wren slip out of a bush I seated myself on a
rock where I was partly hidden, but could get a good view of a
large part of the valley ; the stream flowed beneath me, while
growing on the opposite slope was a tree with many horizontal
branches almost bare of leaves, which appeared to be a favourite
resting-place for many different species, and I soon began to make
the acquaintance of several that I had not seen before. The first
bird to show itself was a Goldfinch with a drooping wing, which
hopped about for some time among the boulders close to the
water; then I saw a Sparrow, and a couple of Tits flew into the
tree opposite. At the time I could not quite make them out, but
I now believe them to have been the Ultramarine Titmouse
(Pains 7 iltra?nari?iusJ a species which I often saw afterwards, it is
the North-West African representative of our Blue Titmouse,
from which it differs by having the upper parts slaty blue and all
the blue portions of the plumage much darker. Then a fine cock
Algerian Chaffinch (Fringilla spodiogenys&apos;) took up his station on
a branch ; it differs from our bird by having the head more slate
blue, there is also more of this colour in other parts of the
plumage and more green on the back. Then my attention was
attracted by a rather loud note and a couple of birds settled on
the outer twigs of a bush growing at the top of the slope opposite
to me ; I saw they were something I was quite unacquainted
with, for though they were soberly attired yet there was some-
thing about them which seemed attractive; in size they seemed

/ere only dull brown with darker, almost black-looking heads,
/hile the pale brown breast faded into white towards the tail,
&apos;his was one of the birds I had been hoping to meet with, as they
/ere Dusky Bulbuls (.Pycnonotus barbatus ), a species which is
on-fined to this region and which has no European represen-
itive ; for some time they sat in full view, thus giving me time
b have a-good look at them. This species inhabits wooded and
ush-covered localities. Next to arrive was a Redstart-looking
ird, which sat on the end of a branch for some little time ; I
m not quite sure of this bird, but think it must have been a
MLoussier's Redstart (.Diplootocjis moussieri ), a most attractive
ttle bird which I frequently saw for certain later on. Then a
eautiful cock North-African Greenfinch settled in the tree
pposite; the male of this form is much brighter-coloured than
urs, and this one looked almost as yellow as a Canary as it sat
1 the sun. The hen, on the other hand, is greyer and duller
ian the English bird. Very likely this species, or at least the
ocks, would be acceptable over here as exhibition birds. Lastly
couple of greyish-looking Sparrows with chestnut-coloured
;rowns came to the tree, and I also saw another of the Redstarts,
lackbirds were numerous and often heard, but were so wild that
could only catch just a glimpse of one now and then.

CORRESPONDENCE, NOTES, ETC.
THE BLACK-HOODED PARRAKEET.
Sir,--I n my note 011 this species in the last number of the Avicultural
lagazine , I stated that I had not detected any difference in the plumage of
le females of Psephotus cucullatus and P. chrysopterygius. I now hasten
&gt; correct this statement, for I find there is a distinct difference. I11 the
male of P. chrysopterygius there is a distinct, though faint, yellowish
ontal band, whereas there is none in P. cucullatus , so far as I can judge
0111 the material at my command. Moreover the crown of the head in P.
irysoptetygius appears to be somewhat darker in colour than in the allied
&gt;ecies, which has a greenish tinge over the otherwise greyish crown.
I was at first led to think there was 110 difference in the females of
:e two species by comparing a specimen in my collection, imported in 1902

or 1903, which I took to be a typical example of P. chrysopterygius , with the
female of P. cucullatus in the Zoological Gardens ; and I found them to be
identical.
This bird was one of a pair recieved alive by Mrs. Johnstone. The
male went to Mr. Fasev, who now has it stuffed ; the skin of the female was
kindly given to me by Mrs. Johnstone.
I have now ascertained the very interesting fact that this pair of birds
are typical examples of P&amp;lt;ephotus cucullatus , a species only described last
year, although Mrs. Johnstone's birds were imported seven or eiglU years ago.
Hence the bird I compared with the living examples of what I
believed to be a species new to avicnltnre, was in fact one of the very same
species. In comparing the female of the true P. chrysopterygius with
P. cucullatus the difference is at once obvious.
By the way, the true Golden-shouldered Parrakeet appears to have
been extremely rarely imported, in fact I am inclined to think that the
eight examples received in London in 1897 are the only living specimens of
Psephotus chrysopterygius which have ever reached this country.

WILD HABITS OF THE GIANT WHYDAH.
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.998739416666667" page_id="58072622"  page_num="224" year="" vol="">
Sir,--I was much interested by the article by Mr. W. E. Tescliemaker
on the breeding of the Giant Whydah which appeared in the January
number.
I have now been about seventeen years in East Griqualand, and the
Giant Whydah is a common bird in most of the parts I have been stationed
in, and I am very familiar with its habits.
Now the point that particularly struck me in the above article, is that
Mr. Tescliemaker expressed doubt as to the polygamous habits of this
species; the same thing has often struck me, but I have never been able to
prove it. It is usual to read in the text-books that the black males are
accompanied by ten or twelve brown females. Now in the spring, when the
adult males have already acquired their black plumage, but before they have
separated for breeding, these birds are often found in large flocks, which
appear to be composed of perhaps two or three males and perhaps twenty
or thirty females, but if anyone were to fire into the " brown " of one of these
flocks he would probably find that out of the brown birds killed a good half
were not females as is usually supposed, but young males of the previous
year which had not yet acquired the black plumage, and I think the idea of
this species being highly polygamous has probably sprung from the belief
that all the brown birds were females.
Another point I should like to mention is that, according to my
experience, the young males do not attain the full plumage until the second
year; but this is a point for aviculturists to decide. I have often seen
young males, still in the brown plumage but much larger than females, and

itli often fairly long (compared with females) brown tails, paying vigorous
&gt;urt to the females, and going through the different forms of display, but
oking quite ridiculous as they have no beautiful plumage to show off.
Another reason for ascribing polygamous habits to this species may
ii that the males are very ardent and will chase or display before any
male that comes along; but this habit is not confined to this species, but is
minion to the whole family, and also to the genus Pyroitielana (Bishop
rds) which are not accused of polygamy.
Mr.Teschemaker mentions that he does not know the meaning of the
affir name for this "I Sakabula it is very appropriate, but is rather hard
translate, as it is a compound of the two verbs " saka saka," which literally
eans to wave about, like the waving of tall grass, and "hula" which
eans to shake, like the shaking of a mat; both refer to the display of the
rd and the long waving tail. European names are "Kaffir fink" and
Kaffir chief." I quite agree with Mr. Teschemaker that the idea that the
ales cannot fly in wind and rain is quite a mistake, as I have often seen
em flying about quite happily in sheets of rain, and their breeding season
: at the rainiest time of the year; but like most birds with heavy loose tails,
&apos;ey do not like turning their backs to the wind, as they cannot control
emselves properly. C. J. Davies.

THE CRY OF THE SATYRA TRAGOPAN.
Sir, -- I should be glad to hear from some of your readers who are
iquainted with Tragopans, either in their native haunts or in captivity, as
I their experience of the various cries of Tragopans and the meaning of
icli. I see in the volume of " Game Birds," in " Lloyd's Natural History,"
i thing is said as to the various calls of salyra , but Mr. Young is quoted
; saying that m el a nocephalus, when alarmed, utters a series of wailing
ties, not unlike those of a young lamb or kid, like the syllables " waa, waa,
ua," and that this is louder in the breeding season when it can be heard
li&apos;Wards of a mile, and that it is probably to invite females to the spot.
The Abbe David is quoted as stating that termnincki gives a very
lid cry most nearly imitated by the syllable " 011a " two or three times
Ipeated.
I have never kept either of the above varieties of Tragopans, but my
fperieuce of Satyra Tragopans is: (1) The hen will, when alarmed, at all
Usons utter a cry of "quar, quar, quar," something like a duck. (2) The
cck is almost invariably silent except in the breeding season. (3) I11 the

breeding season lie at intervals gives utterance to a plaintive high pitched
note " bay, bay, bay," like a very young lamb. This is, I think, a call to tilt
hen and is only used on days when he is displaying. (4) In the breeding
season the cock also gives utterance occasionally to a very loud, boom
ing, most weird, unearthly cry "oo-ah, oo-ali, oo-ali," which I take to be?
challenge of defiance to the neighbourhood. It is not, I think, to call tin
hen, as I have seen the birds together when the cock has given this cry
which causes him considerable effort to make. He is then taking 11c
apparent notice of the hen. Nothing could be less like his cry when calling
the hen than this moaning cry and it is (in the case of my birds) uttered
only two or three days each season. When heard for the first time it is verv
startling and not easily to be forgotten. I was incredulous at first that il
could be the same bird that uttered the plaintive lamb-like cry. (5) The
cries of the cock are only uttered by adult birds which have assumed full
breeding plumage. C. Barnby Smith.

Members will, I know, be in accordance with me in wishing
show all possible respect to the memory of so good a ruler as
r late king, and thus I am sure the illustration which forms
r frontispiece this month will be appreciated, representing as
does a bird which was named after him when lie was Prince of
ales, and has since been imported here and bred to some
tent in this country, winning golden opinions wherever it has
en kept. It is worth mentioning that his late Majesty on first
aring of it, asked if it could be got alive.
The Prince of Wales's, or, as I should propose to call it
w. the Royal Pheasant, is, as the illustration well shows, one
the species or races of which the well-known Colchian or
&gt;111111011 Pheasant is the type. It differs from that bird in the
ich lighter tone of the plumage, which is of a bright chestnut
her than a deep bay, and most conspicuously in its white wing-
verts. In the latter point it agrees with the Mongolian (. P .
mgolicus ), but that bird is widely different otherwise, especially
having a wide white collar and being particularly dark in
lour. The h ^.w principalis differs from the Common Pheasant
n in being lighter.
This Pheasant was discovered by the Afghan Delimitation
mmission of 1884, inhabiting grass and tamarisk-jungles in the

semi-aquatic life, for it was observed to be quite at home i;
thickets growing in two or three feet of water, and to swim a
well as wade in getting from one place to another.
Zarudny also states that it always keeps near water whe
crowing in the pairing season, for " it drinks and bathes eve
during the interval of its crow or song." In bathing at all i
would appear to be unique among birds of this family.
Its great abundance in the swampy reed-covert, where
has been described as rising in places in far greater number
than at any battue in England, points it out as a singularly sui
able species for our damp climate and often soppy soil ; and
the breed spreads it may yet become our dominant type, and af
memorial of the late King.
And apropos of this, just as I am going to press or

I feel some diffidence in sending these notes for publication,
s I am well aware that to generalise on the species when one has
&gt;nly one individual under observation is rash in the extreme,
&apos;he re fore, my remark may only be considered to apply to my
wn bird, and not in any way as laying down the law.
My Hoopoe has been eleven months in my possession,
&gt;assed the winter in a partly closed-in but unheated garden aviary,
s now robust and in very decent plumage. He was only a few
lonths old when I bought him, and I was told that he was doing

/itli him) and would require no other food. This I soon found

iilk, so I tried mixing some with the food. The bird ate it
oraciously, but it was not a success. He remained thin, took to
loping, and neglected himself till lie became so dirty that I was
arced to wash him. I gave him all the insects, especially grass-
oppers. that I could catch, and I believe these kept him alive.
)f course, the miserably wet summer and autumn were sadly
gainst him, and every morning I fully expected to find a corpse
ffien I came out.
One of our members kindly advised me to try scraped meat
nd ants&apos; eggs, in addition to all the living insects I could obtain ;
e added that he feared it was a case of consumption, and urged
le need of warmth. This was very difficult, for when put in a
age the bird wore himself out in his endeavours to get out,

bjectionable in the house. He would not even try the meat
aid ants' eggs ; so, at last, I gave him a daily feed of mealworms,

lsectivorous mixture for another containing more egg-flake
ad dried insects, and found a slight improvement in the bird's
audition. I also used to prowl about grassy hedges and banks

obtained a number of various larvae for him.
Then I read a letter in the Magazine singing the praises "
curd. I tried it the next day on my bird and had the satisfactic
of seeing him eat it greedily. From that moment he began i
pick up and I had no more trouble with him. He grew live
and well-covered, dusted and preened his feathers, grew fres
ones where needed, and throve apace. In short, from a pitiab
object he became a healthy bird. Curd alone, however, does ir
suit, and I find the ideal to consist of a mixture of half curd ai
half "food" and a few pieces of scalded bread, all mixed t&amp;lt;
aether with hot milk. Mealworms have diminished to six pi
diem, and generally some of those find their way into other beal
than his.
Once he was properly fed cold did not seem to affect hi
unless, as once or twice happened, his food was frozen. I sh
him into the inner compartment at night and let him please hit]
self about coining out by day into a roofed lean-to. Now 1
spends most of his time in the open flight, probing every inch
soil. He loves smooth caterpillars and grubs of all kinds, al
cockroaches, and eats worms occasionally, but not in any quantit}

In the afternoon a small Arab boy guided us up a ste&amp;lt;
rocky path for about two miles to see a curious undergroui
lake, which became exposed some twenty years ago after a Ian
slip. O11 the way back, when exploring some rough rod
ground among Olive trees, I flushed a covey of Barbary Pa
ridges (Caccabis petrosa ) which, after getting up with a clatt
sailed across the valley and were soon lost to sight; I w

zk with me from that place. We passed some more, hot springs,
th the remains of Roman baths near, and followed a warm
earn back towards the Hotel, on the banks of which Palms
d Oleanders flourished. At night, I think I heard Owls, which
mded like the distant barking of dogs ; there was a particularly
isy kind of frog in a warm pond close by. The country round
wild and rocky and affords good sport with Wild Boar and
rcupine ; I had some quills of the latter given to me, they
;i often be picked up among the rocks.
I was down in the valley again by six next morning,
nost before it was light; though many birds were about I saw
thing fresh, I heard, however, a Robin-like twitter in some
ive-trees, but could not see what it was. We left Hammam
eskoutine soon after eight, and arrived at Constantine at mid-
y. I only saw a few small birds e?i 7 oute, and a Kestrel poised
the air just before we reached the town. Constantine is
nous, of course, from its impregnable position, being perched
the extreme edge of the precipitous cliffs which form one side
the deep and narrow Gorge of the Runnnel, which encircles
i town for the greater part of its circumference, the remaining
rtion being protected by rocky heights. A wonderful footpath,
lied the Chemin des Touristes, overhanging the River Rummel,
s been constructed against the face of the cliff all along the
&gt;rge, from which fine views of the cliffs can be got ; they rise
ep up from the river-bed to a great height. I11 the Gorge were
mbers of Rock Doves ( Columba livia ), but many tame Pigeons
d joined them ; I saw a number of chequers, several reds,
lers with white about them, and one pure white bird. A large
lony of Jackdaws (Corvus monedula ) inhabited some holes high
in the rocks, close to the spot where the old Roman and the
)dern iron El Kantara bridges span the ravine ; Jackdaws are
no means common in Algeria, but this is one of the spots
lere they are plentiful. Kestrels were very numerous, I had
ver seen so many together before ; they kept flying in and out
crevices in the cliffs and overhead, uttering their shrill cries,
number of Wagtails, probably the White Wagtail ( Motacilla
id) were running over the stones in the river bed or flitting
out the rocks. Storks and Eagles are said to occur here ; I

Mr. T. H. Newman,
saw an Arab collecting some large flight feathers from near tli
water's edge, and one or two large birds of prey were seen.
The morning of the 23rd was spent exploring the town ;
saw several Goldfinches and one rather miserable-looking Ortola
(.Emberiza hortulana) in cages. Left Constantine at 1.45 fo
Batna, which we reached about a couple of hours after dark ;
was quite cold here. Batna lies very high, as it is situated righ
in the Allies Mountains ; there is nothing of interest in the tow
itself, as it is only a modern French military station, but th
marvellous ruins of the Roman towns of Lambessa and Timga
can be visited from here, and that was how we spent the 24U
We started early to drive to Lambessa ; it was bitterly cole
though the sun shone at intervals. On the way we passed a fe\
flocks of small birds, and I first saw Irby's Raven ( Corvus cora.
tingitanus ) which is a small race of tlie common species, whic
it represents in North Africa. O11 arriving at Lambessa, whe
inside the fine square Roman building known as the Prsetoriun:
a small dark bird flew noiselessly across and popped into a hoi
between two large stones ; I have no doubt this was a Souther;
Little Owl ( Carine noctua glaux ); this is a very common bir
here and may often be seen in the day-time. Among the ruins
first came across Crested Larks; so many forms of these bird
occur in this region that I am afraid I cannot attempt either her
or elsewhere to define those I saw, but can only call them Creste
Larks--these particular ones seemed to belong to a small race
I saw several Black Redstarts ( Ruticilla titys ) flying about am
perching on the stones, and I watched a small flock of prett
little sandy-brown coloured birds which were feeding among, o
perched upon, some of the blocks of stones from the ruins ; the
must have been Rock Sparrows (Petronia petro?iia). I afterward
saw a very fine brightly-coloured cock Cirl Bunting (. Emberiz*
chins&apos;) perched on the edge of a twig in an overgrown hedge
The weather was very cold, and as it came 011 to hail, we wen
glad to continue our journey to Timgad, which is about 25 mile
from Batna ; it is rather an uninteresting drive through barren
looking undulating country. Snow was visible on the higlie
Allies Mountains; much ploughing was going on, and I sav
some Irby's Ravens following the plough as the Rooks do wit

s. Just before reaching Timgad I caught sight of the black
uills of a large grey bird by a small stream, I expect it was a
Heron (Ardea cinerea ) ; I also saw several small Hawks. A large
lock of Goldfinches were singing in the fruit-trees just outside
he ruins; I watched them as they fluttered about while some
fere feeding on a grassy bank below. A very fine white Wagtail
fas running about by a little stream near the small Museum,
yhile what looked like some Tree-Sparrows were sitting on the
oof of the building. Among the ruins I came across a pair of
Hack Chats (Saxicola leucura ) ; this is a very taking bird, though
inly attired in smoky black with the tail-coverts and base of the
ail white. As they obligingly perched themselves 011 the top of
ome blocks of stone I was able to see them plainly ; they flew
o the ground, then up on to a block again.
During the night there was quite a sharp frost ; it was a
lice bright morning, fresh but not so cold. I took a walk round
he outskirts of the town ; Batna is surrounded by a wall for
mrposes of defence. A number of Goldfinches were singing in
he trees just outside the town: I saw several Ultramarine Tits
linging to one corner of the walls and flying about the trees, and
presently I encountered two or three brightly-coloured Great
fits, which would be referable to the Mediterranean form ( Pams
najor excelsus ); they were very tame and hopped about in a hedge
&gt;nlv a few feet away from me. On the other side of the town
vere many Irby's Ravens, some which were perched in some low
rees and let me get near enough to have a good look at them ;
jifterwards the}&apos;&apos; flew towards the hills uttering harsh deep croaks
nd soared up in wide circles. The commonest birds were
Sparrows ; they seemed to be rather difficult to identify; most
vere of what I have called the Tree-Sparrow type, the same as
hose at Timgad. One, however, seemed to have a very chestnut-
floured crown ; some that were near the Great Tits were darker
irown and looked looser in leather, more like our House-
Sparrows.
We left Batna before eleven, at first passing through 1111-
lulating country with hills near; a road runs parallel with the
ine for some distance, along which numerous caravans of camels
nd donkeys were making their way to or from the Desert. I

Mr. T. H. Newman,
noticed several small Hawks, many flocks of small birds, most!
Larks, and a few Ravens. We afterwards passed some rugge&amp;lt;
isabelline coloured country, scarred with dry water-gulleys ; her
Chats were numerous. Lastly we came to the district when
dates begin to be cultivated, past large groves of Palms, am
arrived at Biskra about two in the afternoon.
Biskra is situated at the foot of the Allies Mountains, am
is just on the borders of the Desert; it is an oasis which, witl
others near, forms one of the chief date-growing districts.
took a walk through Old Biskra with its mud-built house:
"
surrounded by beautiful Palms, White Wagtails were ven
numerous; I heard and saw a Senegal Dove (Turtur senegalensis
fly out of a Palm-tree, for here the bird well deserves its name o
Palm-dove, being inseparable from that tree, thus differing ven
widely from the habits of the species in such places as Jerusalen
and Cairo, where it has become parasitic on houses and builds ii
walls and verandahs. The Senegal Dove is verv abundant ii
Southern Tunisia and Algeria. Canon Tristram found it com
paratively scarce at Biskra in the fifties, owing to its being mucl
shot at by the French Officers, but Mr. Whitaker has found i
most plentiful here recently, some of the Palms being full o
them. Though I was often among the Palm groves I only sav
very few, and then only single birds.
Next day, the 26th, was a dull cold morning ; we drove t(
the oasis of Sidi Okbar, which is sixteen miles from Biskra
across the flat mud dried-like Desert, with low shrubs growing a&apos;
intervals out of little heaps like ant hills. I noticed many Lark.'
and Chats ; as we drove along a flock of large dark-looking birds
with long legs and necks, were seen flying in the direction of tht
Mountains. I stopped the carriage and got out in order to get r
better look at them, they were a long way off; at the time I tool'
them to be Glossy Ibises (Plegadis falcinellus ), but it seemec
rather a dry district for Ibises, though they may have beei
making for some distant marsh or stream ; still perhaps the}
were Cranes (Grus grus). Sidi Okbar is a very ancient place
and is said to contain the oldest Mosque in Africa; the streets
are very narrow, and the sun-dried brick houses so high, tha
nothing can be seen from them, but when you mount the lo^

ower-like minaret of the Mosque, a wonderful view is obtained ;
11 the distance were the Aures Mountains with Biskra plainly
visible nestling at their base, and the level Desert was seen stretch-
ng for miles all around with green oases dotted here and there.
At our feet, surrounded by a great belt of Date-palms, lay Sidi
Dkbar, the flat roofs of the houses all being in full view ; dates
md couscouss were drying in heaps 011 many of the roofs. A
jeautiful cock Blue Rock-Thrush ( Monticola cyajius) was just help-
ng himself to a date from one heap, while a party of Sparrows
md House Buntings {Frin gill aria saharce ) were busy further off
&gt;ver some couscouss. The House Bunting is a charming foxy-
;oloured little bird, the cock having a bluish-grey head and neck;
t is most familiar and tame, and is nearly always found near
imnan habitations, being particularly partial to the Arab huts
md mosques. It will be remembered that Mr. Meade-Waldo
\0x25A0ontributed an interesting paper on this bird in the second
&apos;olunie of our Magazine, p. 52. A Senegal Dove was walking
ibout 011 the roof near the House Buntings, and a Starling
Sturnus vulgaris&apos;) was perched on a Palm frond. I saw two
furtle-doves ( Turtur turtur) in a cage, hanging just inside one
&gt;f the Arab houses, they were not in very good condition, but
eemed to be rather small brightly-coloured birds; this species
s abundant as a summer migrant. I took a walk among the
^alms, which are very fine here, and saw what I think was a hen
doussier's Redstart. At the edge of the oasis I saw many Crested
/arks, which appeared larger and darker-crested than those I
lad seen before. O11 the way back to Biskra we passed a large
ight-grey bird on the ground ; I much regret I did not stop to
lave a better look at it, as it is possible that it may have been a
)emoiselle Crane.
On the following morning I saw several White Wagtails
11 winter plumage, an Ultramarine Titmouse, and several Irby's
lavens in the stony dry river-bed. A Desert Buzzard ( Buteo
lesertorum , or cirensis as perhaps it should be called) was flying
bout loose in one of the houses in the town ; it was very tame,
nd I used to see it when passing, sitting outside on the window
edge, looking out into the street ; I believe it was quite full-
vinged. The upper surface of the bird is light rufous brown,

while the head, neck and under surface are creamy-white with
sundry dark stripes distributed about the plumage ; there seemed
something Kite-like about the bird to me. I11 the afternoon, we
went to the hot Sulphur spring, just at the foot of the hills. The
spring, which is utilized for baths, is situated in the midst of
rough stony ground, with very little vegetation about, though
an attempt is made to grow a few Palms. I noticed several
White Wagtails and a couple of Starlings, which were rather
wild ; in contrast to them was a lovely Pallid Shrike (Lanins
elegans ) which was one of the tamest birds I came across ; it flew
from Palm to Palm, perching on the very tips of the fronds, as
though to be admired. The upper surface is of a delicate French
grey, and it has the usual black Shrike markings on the head,
while the entire under-surface is white ; it much resembles the
Great Grey Shrike, and is confined to the district south of the
Atlas Mountains. It is one of the most familiar and fearless
birds to be met with ; Canon Tristram noted the habit of perch-
ing on the outermost edge of a Palm-leaf over 50 years ago.
Next morning, the 28th, large numbers of Starlings were
flying about the Palms opposite the Hotel; they were all of the
common species. I did not come across the Sardinian Starling
which is not uncommon in many places. White Wagtails
and Ultramarine Tits were observed on the other side of the
Hotel among the Palms growing there. I walked along the dry
river bed and saw a party of House-Martins (Chelidon urbica ),
probably late stragglers, tempted by the bright sunny weather to
linger awhile, as the House-Martin appears only to be a migrant
here, wintering further south ; though both the House-Martin
and Swallow may occasionally be met with in mid-winter, their
presence here then is to be regarded as accidental. Among the
House-Martins were a few specimens of the pretty little Crag
Martin (Biblis rupestris ) ; this species is resident and may be seen
at all seasons; they can readily be distinguished from the Sand-
Martin by the absence of the brown band across the breast and by
having a white spot 011 all tail-feathers except the middle pair.
Though I passed this place at least once ever}&apos;&apos; day during our stay
at Biskra, I did not see either species there again. A beautiful
Falcon flew along the river course ; it appeared to be dull bluish-

grey on the wings, with a whitish under-surface, so it was very
possibly a Barbary Falcon ( Falco Barbaras&apos;) ; a solitary Raven and
some White Wagtails, which seemed to be the commonest birds
about, were noticed. I returned through Old Biskra, where I
saw a Senegal Dove fly out of a Palm. I11 the afternoon I went
for some distance along the Sidi Okbar road, hoping I might
again encounter the big grey bird I had seen on the 26th, but I
only saw some rather small pale-coloured Crested Larks and the
ever present White Wagtails.
Next day I visited some Palm gardens just outside the
town, where I saw a beautiful cock Moussier's Redstart; it was
hopping about in an Acacia bush, and presently flew to the
ground, so I could see it well. This lovely little bird is con-
fined to the North-West portion of the African continent ; the
wings, top and sides of head are black, a conspicuous white
band passes from the forehead over the eye, ending in a
large patch on each side of the neck, a large alar patch on
die secondaries is also white ; the rest of the bird, with the
exception of the two central tail-feathers which are brown, is a
rich tawny orange. The female is dull brown on head and
wings and the under-surface is duller than in the male, fading
:o whitish towards the tail. The bird does not seem to be wild,
50 may often be watched from a short distance without showing
dgns of fear. I just caught sight of a large bird with black and
white wings sailing over the Palm-trees; if it was not an Egyptian
Vulture, I do not know what it could have been. Several Ravens
and Goldfinches, a very brightly-coloured Sparrow, and two birds
that looked like Stonechats (fPratincola rubicola ) were seen, and
a solitary Swallow ( Hirundo rustica ) was winging its way to and
fro just beyond the Palms. This morning a Jay was seen in Old
Biskra perched in a Palm tree: I did not see this bird myself,
but it was described to me, and a Jav is a bird which cannot well
be mistaken. This would be the Algerian Black-headed Jay
( Garrulus cervicalis ), which differs from our bird chiefly by having
a black crest and white ear-coverts and cheeks. I11 the afternoon
we drove to the oasis of Chetma. I saw very few birds ; we passed
a nice pair of Black Chats, and I think I saw a Senegal Dove at
Chetma ; on the way back I got a good view of a Desert Chat

(Saxicola deserti). It kept flying along a ditch by the side of the
road, appearing some distance ahead and waiting until I got close
to it, when the performance was repeated. I saw a stuffed Bee-
eater {Meiops apiastcr) in a shop at Biskra; this bird is exceed-
ingly abundant through Algeria during the summer months.
Barbary Sheep may be obtained in the mountains near Biskra,
and Gazelles are common.

Passer dijfusus.
By W. E. Teschemaker, B.A.
I am not too sure about the identification of this species--
indeed the African Rock-Sparrows are quite a special study.
There is a female of this species (apparently) in the Zoological
Society's Small Bird - house at present, presented by Dr.
Hopkinson, but labelled Passer simplex. I am under the im-
pression that the identification of the Zoo specimen is incorrect,
but I may be wrong.
Anyway, the subject of the present notice may be described
as follows : crown, nape, throat and breast light ashy-grey; back
and wings pale brown, median coverts margined with white;
rump and tail warmer brown; beak dark horn-colour; irides
reddish-brown. Size about that of P. doviesticus. Note a harsh
Sparrow-like chirp. Song none. Disposition savage. Habitat
(if correctly identified) N.E. and E. Africa. Constitution hard
as nails.
I extracted four of these Sparrows from a large consign-
ment of African birds at Mr. Luer's in June of last year; they
are not frequently imported, I think. I turned them out in a
small division of the aviary by themselves, and they agreed fairly
well until one pair commenced to nest. I rescued one of the
non-breeding birds just in time, but the next morning I found in
a corner a ghastly object--a thing without eyes, without scalp,
without feathers, but still breathing. It was the other unpaired
P. diffusus.

They built in a nest-box a domed nest, lined with feathers,
ind laid four eggs of a dull greyish ground-colour with reddisli-
)rown spots. Size: *75 111m. x &apos;58 mm.
Incubation commenced on the 21st July, and I saw young
&gt;eing fed on the 1st August. Only one youngster was hatched,
)ut this developed into a fine specimen, being fed solely on
nsect-food. It was apparently most reluctant to leave the nest
--in fact I had it out and examined it once or twice to see if
here was anything wrong with it. It finally left the nest 011 the
\0x25A05th August, and was then practically as large as the parents
ud closely resembled the latter, the only points of difference
hat I noted being the colour of the back and beak, the former
&gt;eing grey-brown and the latter lighter, The white margins of
he median coverts were as distinct as in the adults.
The adult hen sat again 011 the 28th August and, when I
&gt;arted with all my P. diffusus to one of our members, there was
notlier not quite fully fledged youngster which, however, did
lot survive the journey.
I find that males of this species are rather larger than
emales and darker round the eye.
I had less trouble with P. diffusus than with any other
pecies bred last season, but it must not be taken for granted, I
liink, that all Rock Sparrows are equally easy to breed. I have
truggled with Petro?iia dentata for five years and have not seen
n egg yet.

ence between them is, that whereas Cumberland has a long coas
line, the sister county has but an apology for one, in the form 0
the estuary of the Kent and the adjacent part of Morecambe Bay
Of the three characters they have in common, the one I an
chiefly acquainted with is the line of hills on the east, as at the
foot of that I had the good fortune to spend some of my earh
years, and to pass many an Autumn Holiday. Uninteresting a?
it may look as one passes down the valley of the Eden, and com
monplace and featureless in outline as it may appear as viewer
from the mountains of the Lake District, in comparison witl
them, it nevertheless possesses charms of its own, and it is onh
when one explores its deep cut valleys, or " Gills" as the native,
call them, that one realises that its want of interest is more
apparent than real.
Following a holiday taken in the height of the summer o
1908, when weather favoured me to the utmost, I was fortunate
in being able to alter the time of my visit this year (1909) tc
August and doubly fortunate in that I was there during almos
the only spell of fine weather they had, the summer and autumi:
through.
Leaving Hoddam Castle on the 2nd of August, after hav-
ing had the pleasure of drawing and painting some of Mr
Brook's superb collection of Malayan birds, I travelled southwarc
down the Midland line to a station opposite the highest part o
the Pennines, and only about five miles distant from the summit
of them. Walking up from the station, I heard, as I neared tin
village I was to stay at, a Corncrake grating, this being the onh
time I heard the bird, although it is one that is heard all around
from the grass fields at Midsummer.
Circumstances permitted my commencing my observations
at once, and on the Tuesday I made direct for the hills, stopping
in the '' fell lane " to make notes of a Wren sitting on a stake in
a hedge and carrying his tail level as any other bird might do
and to make a sketch of a Whitethroat which I started from a
bed of thistles and which flew off looking very much surprised.
The dull skies which had prevailed through July were
showing signs of brightening, though in the meantime we were
fain to be content with merely an absence of rain.

A Tit was heard but was not seen, so likewise was a Chat
of some sort. I was now on the open moorland and might
expect to see not only the Meadow Pipit, which abounds on these
grassy uplands, but Red and even Black Grouse, although of the
latter only a few are about. Two Woodpigeons were seen and a
pair of Pipits, but no Grouse of either species. The afternoon
was taken up in visiting the cultivated ground to the south of the
village and here I found much of the hay still uncut, although it
was about a month after they usually begin the hay harvest. In
&gt;ne field which was half cut, but in which no one was workin* r
\t the time, I saw four Woodpigeons hunting over the swaithes of
reshly cut grass. In a neighbouring plantation of Scotch Fir
[ saw six or seven Chaffinches feeding together in one of the
tees, and not far off recognised the Sand Martin, which in this
^strict only breeds in one place that I know of, viz. in the soil
it the top of an abandoned quarry of red sandstone. The Hedge
Accentor was seen and the Yellow Bunting heard. A small patch
&gt;f primaeval moorland adjoined the plantation, and on this the
Curlews bred, I believe, in peace and safety, for I found them
; ery common on it and saw several at once, and also some Pee-
vits. This moor contained a very slight green valley, only some
en or twelve feet deep and about as many yards wide in its
ipper part ; no stream flowed in ordinary times, yet there was a
mall pond in it with clumps of rushes growingabout it. On my
ast previous visit to this district, in June 1908, a young friend
ltd I had gone to this pond towards dusk and had been much
uzzled by an object we saw in a clump of rushes growing in the
/ater : my friend was the first to guess what it was, and proved
iglit. It was a Water-Hen, the only one I ever saw alive in
hese parts, which was seeking safety by crouching with its head
la amongst the rushes, but which had left its conspicuous white
fathers exposed towards the prowling naturalists ; had it gone
le other side of the clump and faced towards 11s, only thrusting
s head into hiding, we should most likely not have seen it, as

Peewit, so it seemed to be a favourite resort with them.
On Wednesday, August 4th, there was a high wind and a
cloudy sky, and I noticed a Curlew being blown about over the
fields near the village. Further out I saw several Chaffinches,
all appparently females, hunting over the swaitlies of newly cut
hay. Not only many Chaffinches, but two or three Yellow
Buntings, a Hedge Accentor and a Redstart came to pick up
what they might, and these were soon joined by a Common Wren,
a Willow Warbler and an immature Greenfinch. I could not
be sure what they were after, but I do not doubt that the finch
and bunting as well as the insectivorous birds were searching for
such flies and other insects, or their larvae, as were disturbed or
exposed by the newly mown grass.
P&apos;rom the higher woods, at the foot of the hills, I heard a
cry as of a Kestrel, but a long search with the glass, from a dis-
tance, failed to show the bird that made it. Just as I was coin-
ing into the house at lunch time I heard a Greenfinch singing,
in what I put down at the time as " full song."
I11 the afternoon I again went over the cultivated ground
and cautiously approaching the field where the day before I had
seen the Woodpigeons hunting the new mown grass, searched its
further parts for any interesting birds it might contain ; in this
way I got right up to the fence enclosing it, still prying into its
far corners, when suddenly a tremendous whirr sounded almost
under my nose and, putting down the binocular, I was chagrined
to see a covey of about fourteen Partridges which had beer
squatting close to the fence amongst the cut grass, and which 1
might have seen crouching had I only looked close to my teel
instead of surveying the distant sides of the field. these
Partridges flew over towards our local mill-dam, but although 1
went in pursuit I saw nothing more of them. This dam, being
sheltered both by a bank and by trees, was secluded and seemec
a favourite spot with Herons, as several times I found theii
feathers about it; but this time as I searched round it, I foiluc
none. From here I went to the plantation beforementioned, ii
the hope of finding Owls or Goldcrests. I saw a Squirrel, whicl
sat on a bough about forty feet above the ground, apparent!}

enjoying a dolce far ?iiente and which took no notice of me
though I stared at it with the binocular, and a few Woodpigeons.
The only other birds really seen were Chaffinches, although I
beard the cheep of birds which I thought must be Goldcrests.
Nearly all the feathers found were those of Woodpigeons, but one
might have been from a Sparrowhawk's alula, and another, a
downy feather from an Owl. In the evening I only heard Green-
finches singing and Partridges calling, as I was only out for a
short time.
On the 1 huisday, Chaffinches and Willow Wrens were
seen, and a Great Tit, whose churring notes I at first took for
those of a Blue Tit; these on the way to the moorland, where
however, I saw no Grouse, but only a few Rooks stalking about,
and heard a Willow Wren singing from some trees bordering the
highest lying hayfield in the country.
A Kestrel was seen hovering near the top of one of the
loot hills, about 1,400 feet high ; and three birds I took to be
Ravens, but which were nearly a mile off and therefore could not
be identified by sound, circled over a small valley at the base of
it, while a Peewit was noted on the flank of another steep hill
dose by. As I approached a curious flat-topped hill composed
)f shale, overlooking the confluence of the two streams mv
irother and I most often fished, I flushed a Meadow Pipit from
itnong the beds of bracken fern, and arriving at the top about
uid-day, sat down to rest. This day proved to be the first of the
lot weather we were to enjoy and so unaccustomed was I to
teat, that I spent an hour in going a distance of about two miles
&gt;ver nearly level though somewhat rough ground, and even
lien felt oppressed.
From the top ot this hill I searched with my binocular
he rough, rushy pastures lying to the South where I knew the
flack Grouse nested and saw four birds at a distance of a
housand yards or so, which might have been Greyhens, but,
lthough I watched the birds closely, I got 110 clue from
oinparison with Curlews or Peewits to their actual size, and so
itt their identity an open matter.
My objective this time was a waterfall in one of our best

passing through one of our finest mountain valle\s, distin-
guished by the local people as Gurt Deal. My search for the
particular waterfall did not succeed and I settled down to make
a sketch of another instead. A Kestrel was seen flying over the
valley at 1.20, and a pair was seen about 1.30 over a spur of a
hill near, and a male in adult plumage came and hovered near
me, close enough for me to see with the binocular his tail spreau
out like an open fan, and his alert, bent-down head. this bird
flew down to the side of the hill I had rested on, and perching 011
the steep side near the top, remained there and pieened. I wicej
it flew up and returned before finally leaving. A Cariion Ciow
came down the dale and flew backwards and forwards past the
most conspicuous limestone crag in the neighbourhood, with
something which might have been an egg iu its bill, but dis-
appeared over the skyline of the mountain above me without
coming near. In the afternoon, a Dipper gave me a chance 0
sketching it, as it perched on a boulder iu a side stream, and
^fter drawing it, I noted four Carrion Crows round the scar when
I had seen the one earlier on. Turning my steps homeward
I stopped to examine the skyline of the scar in its 1110s
prominent part and saw either a Raven or a Cairiou Ciow sitting
so that it appeared against the sky. This bird soon began t&amp;lt;
preen and I watched it at intervals as long as I remained withii
sight. My last item for the day was the flushing of two Partridges
seemingly adults, in one of the rough pastures, on my way
home.

unshine of the African wilderness that transfuses its pages. He

&apos;reserve of the world, to the ice-floes of the antarctic ; from the
ntipodes and the coral islands of the Pacific to the prairies of

ay that Dr. Rensliaw can write like Major Eeveson at his best;
lit I cannot pay him a higher compliment than by saying that his

THE JACAMARS.
Enera Avium, Conducted by P. Wytsman. Picarice Fain. Galbulidae
by P. L. SCUATKR. Brussels, 1909.
The Jacamars are related to the Toucans, Barbets and
l T o ok peckers, resembling them in many characters besides the
iructure of the feet which belong to the type called ' zygodactyl.'
although in its strict etymological sense ' zygodactyl ' simply
leans with united toes, the term is not applied by ornithologists
) webbed feet but to feet in which the inner and outer toes are
irned permanently backwards while the two middle toes retain
leir usual forward direction. This type of foot has been in-
ependently acquired by distinct kinds of birds, perhaps the
est known to aviculturists being the Parrots. It is obviously an
daptation to an arboreal as opposed to a terrestrial mode of life,
nee birds which possess it are expert climbers but clumsy
alkers on the ground.

The Woodpeckers and Barbets are widely distributed ; but
the Jacamars ( Galbulidee ) and their near allies the Puff-Birds
(. Bucconidce ) and the Toucans are only found in tropical or sub-
tropical America. The Jacamars recall the Bee-eaters in appear-
ance, with their brightly-coloured often metallic plumage and
long somewhat-slender bills. They frequent the edges of forests
or open glades and feed upon insects. They are not uncommonly
found near streams and nest in holes in the banks, dliere are
some twenty different kinds known, and these form the subject-
matter ot the memoir under notice. Those who are acquainted
with Dr. Sclater's scientific papers will recognise in this treatise
his happy knack of grasping the essential character of species
and of expressing them with a combination of brevity and
lucidity which very few authors can equal. R. I. P.
INDIAN BIRDS.
Being a key to the common birds of the plains of India.
By Douglas Dewar. London 1909: John Lank. 6s. net.
There has been 110 better book on the fauna of any large
area than Blanford's volumes on that of India, but four volumes
on birds are a rather large order to carry about, to say nothing of
the difficulties beginners find with books like this, and Anglo-
Indians and those visiting India will welcome Mr. Dewar's most
light and handy work, which is destined to serve as a guide to the
larger book, dealing with the commoner species only ; for after
these are learnt, as the author says, it becomes easy to locate the
rest.
The book is most ingeniously arranged, the first part
being occupied by keys destined to facilitate birds by some con-
spicuous peculiarity of colour, form, note or action. Thus there
are lists of crested biids, forked-tailed birds, birds with black
heads, birds with yellow, pink, blue, etc., in the plumage, and if
the subject of one's search is not identified by means of one ot
these keys, there is always a good chance of "spotting'' it with
another.

species, such as the Sparrow and Crow, and these birds of com-
parison are indicated by letters ; the Sparrow, for instance being
I, while a bird larger than a Sparrow and smaller than a Bulbul
goes as IF, and a smaller bird than a Sparrow as --I ; a very
ingenious idea. Long tails are treated as extras.
No less than 231 species are dealt with, so it will be seen
that the work is comprehensive enough, although birds regarded
as game are for the most part omitted, such birds, as Mr. Dewar
remarks, being usually shot on sight and readily identifiable by
other manuals which exist, while his book is intended to facilitate
the identification of ordinary, everyday birds by those who have
no wish to shoot them. Mr. Dewar points out that it is quite
likely that he has omitted some birds which are locally common,
but I only miss very few of my feathered acquaintances, chiefly
the Blue-cheeked Barbet (Cyanops asiatica ) and the Jungle
Mynah {Aethiopsar juscus), while, though my experience of India
was far less wide than his has been, I have come across most of the
kinds he mentions. I think, therefore, he has covered the ground
completely, and I recommend his book to all who wish to take
tip the study of what I am convinced is the most interesting avi-
fauna of the world, if only because it has been less disturbed by
man--in spite of an ancient civilization--than any other.

of ten days, instead of being killed as usual, and one interesting
note on it was that it took food when on the wing as well as
when swimming.
It is interesting to read that that grand bird, the Canadian
Goose, is breeding freely in a perfectly wild state on Cheshire
waters, and that flocks of hundreds may be seen at times in
winter. This bird will at this rate, probably have to be put on
the game list shortly if it is not treated in this way already, for
geese in abundance are not bv anv means friends of the farmer ;
but we could very well do with it as a game species.
An observation to the effect that two domesticated Shel-
drakes were killed by foxes is worthy of notice, in view of the
statement made by a continental author that Sheldrakes will
nest in Foxes' earths even when Reynard is in occupation. It
is evidently no repugnance to the flesh of this bird, unpalatable
as it to most people, which causes this forbearance if the story
is really correct.
Another interesting note concerns the persecution of a
Pied Flycatcher by one of the common spotted species; if this
is usual it may explain why the former bird is so local in this
country, but the relations of allied species to each other, although
probably of great importance with regard to geographical dis-
tribution, have been but little worked out. The book is full of
suggestive observations such as these, and I cordially recommend
it to all members. F.F.

.Vhite and plain-coloured eggs have been figured by ordinary
hack and white plates.
Turning to the text, we find a description not only of the
lest and eggs of each species, but the birds themselves are
lescribed, an excellent arrangement since, in many cases, to
atisfactorily identify eggs one must first be able to see and
dentify the bird that laid them.
The arrangement of the species is somewhat unorthodox ;
nstead of the recognised systematic order being followed, the
)irds are arranged in groups such as " In Towns and Gardens,"
; By Wayside and Woodland," " By the Waterside," and so forth.
L&apos;liis arrangement has something to commend it in the present
&gt;ook, which is intended, we take it, rather for the beginner than
or the experienced naturalist, though even in this case it is
oubtful whether the recognised system would not have been
ireferable.
We cannot agree with the author when he says that pro-
iably any of our lost breeding species might be restored by
rtificial introduction. Doubtless this would be beneficial with
uch species as the Kite, as the few remaining pairs in Wales, its
ist stronghold in Britain, are very in-bred, and the introduction
f some new blood from abroad might give the species a new
iase of life. But in the case of the majority of disappearing
British birds, their threatened extermination is due to cultivation
nd drainage, and the reintroduction of such species would be
ntirely useless.
With these few comments we leave the book to our readers
'ith the assurance that they will find it an exceedingly useful
ddition to their libraries. D. S.-S.

first locality they stayed at a settlement on the renowned lake of
pitch, one of the wonders of the world, and in the latter enjoyed
excellent opportunities of studying the Hoactzin (Opisthocomus
hoazin ) and would no doubt have succeeded in introducing this
most remarkable bird to aviculture, had not Mrs. Beebe had the
misfortune to break her wrist by a fall from her hammock, which
necessitated an immediate abandonment of the expedition.
Fortunately the accident had no serious consequences, Mrs.
Beebe having made a rapid and complete recovery.
The book is replete with observations of the greatest
interest, not only on birds, but on beasts, on reptiles, fish,
insects, and the local types of humanity. Many of the birds
dealt with are, of course, familiar to aviculturists, such as
Toucans, Parrots, Hang-nests, Tanagers, and the various South
American Finches ; and the accounts of these will be read with
especial eagerness and interest by those of our members who are
wise enough to acquire this book. Many birds were secured for
the New York Zoo by the expedition, and interesting accounts
are given of the methods of capture employed ; the following,
for instance :
" A cage containing a Yellow-bellied Calliste was one day
placed in a tree about twenty feet high, and limed twigs arranged
on neighbouring branches. In two hours in 'the morning, two
specimens of the same species, three Blue Tanagers, two Black-
faced Callistes, two Toua-touas or Brown-breasted Pygmy Gros-
beaks, and one Yellow Oriole were taken. The various species
of Tanagers and Orioles are much more gregarious in feeding
habits than the Finches, hence the variety caught. The Toua-
touas were purely accidental visitors. The Finches are rarely
taken by a call-bird not of the same species."
Mention is wisely made of the difficulties in catching in
the tropics, owing to the liquefaction of bird-lime by the mid-day
heat, which is also dangerous to the call-birds. Among the
appendices is a very useful one giving the native Guianan names
of birds, and the descriptions often given of the various birds
mentioned in the text are so good that any aviculturist going to
these regions armed with this book would be able to recognise
many at all events of the new friends he would meet with.

"The British Warblers: A history with problems of their lives."
By H. Eliot Howard, F.Z.S., M.B.O.TJ. Part IV.
London : R. H. Porter, 7, Princes Street, Cavendish Square, W.
Price 21/- net.
The fourth part of Mr. Eliot Howard's beautiful work on
le Warblers is now published and is in every way equal in
ualitv to the three preceding parts. The species dealt with are
le Whitethroat, Lesser Whitethroat, Greenish Willow Warbler
nd Siberian Chiff-chaff. Five excellent coloured plates and six
hotogravures, all by Henrik Gronvold, are well up to the
andard of those of the previous parts and add very materially
&gt; the value of the work.
Never has a book been written in which the life-history of
group of birds has been more fully treated than in the present
istance, and the author introduces his readers to many habits
id problems in the lives of this charming group of migrants
hich will be quite new to most people.
The author is undoubtedly a rare good observer, and from
le day of the arrival of a Warbler in his neighbourhood, he
irefully notes its habits. In the case of the Whitethroat for
stance, the males precede the females by several days as a
de. Each male takes possession of a certain territory, and
mietimes even constructs a nest in readiness for the female
qon her arrival. Severe battles take place between individuals
the same sex if they cross one another's boundaries. The
irious attitudes of display, courtship, and so forth, as revealed
the reader of Mr. Howard's book, are highly interesting and
ftraordinary.
The species dealt with, with the exception of one or two,
hich can only be regarded as rare stragglers, are all treated in
e same thorough style, nothing of any importance in their
:onomy having apparently escaped the author's observation.

Sik,
(i) Nesting of the Pintaieed Whydah.
Dr. Butler having asked me to obtain some further particulars of the
event mentioned in my notes on Chera progue, I wrote to our member, Air.
W. T. Page, who inspected the aviaries in question shortly after the young
were said to have left the nest. Mr. Page has very kindly written me as
follows:--" The facts are simply these. The roof of Mrs. A.'s aviary was
covered with spherical nests of Weavers, Whydahs and Finches: she
pointed to quite a group of nests close together--all of one character, i.e.
merely spherical. Mrs. A. said at the time her impression was at first that
the parents were Finches, but, among a crowd of birds, I thought the
evidence too inconclusive and did not bring it forward, as afterwards she
saw the Pintails feeding. Practically the only intimation she had of them
was seeing the young--in fact the nests were so thickly placed undei the
roof among the branches, in husks, travelling cages and the like that it
would be most difficult to locate the young." The original reference to this
occurrence may be found in Bud Notes, Nov. I 9 * 9 &gt; P- 2 57 * I fear the above
data do not throw much further light on the interesting question of the
alleged parasitic habits of this species which Dr. Butler has referred to. It
will be noted that the owner first thought the young were being fed by
Finches and subsequently by the Pintails.
It is not probable that both these observations can be correct, and. it
one is incorrect, then both may have been so. A possible explanation of the
matter is that the Pintailed Whydah may only be occasionally parasitic, and
this hypothesis would not of course be disproved by the fact of its rearing
its own vouim in an aviarv (even if the fact were well attested) because,
under these unnatural conditions, the parents might not easily find a
suitable host. It should be noted that Haagner in his latest work ap-
parently accepts Austin Roberts' statements as conclusive, although lie
must of course be well acquainted with Stark's and Shelley's description 01
the nests and eggs (cf. Sketches of S. African Bird Life p. 72). I am not in
any way opposed to Dr. Butler's view : all that I wish to point out is that I
do not think he is justified in saying (p. 134) "if no Waxbills were present
in the aviary in which the Whydahs were bred the only suggestion of Mr
Roberts which now remains to be disproved is the character of the eggs.
We have evidence that some young Pintails were bred in an aviary, but not
as to how they were bred, and, further, according to Haagner (I have not
seen the original paper) Roberts did not say that this species was parasitic
only on Waxbills.

The question of the colour of the eggs, however, ought to be easily
ettled by an aviarist and, if it can be shown that they are not white, then

Perhaps I may be permitted to add a postscript to my recent notes on
his species. On nth Feb. I caught up the young male and examined it
are fully. It had only two very small blue feathers on each side of the
hroat--so small as almost to require a magnifying-glass to see them. As
his bird had an extensive, and apparently natural, moult in October last
his fact marches well with my suggestion that the young of this species do
ot assume the adult plumage till their third season. It has not sung as yet.
iii) The Giant Whydah.
The young male of this species went through an extensive moult in
November, casting the whole of his tail, many of the flights and some of
he body-featliers. Towards the end of the mouth I first heard him sine--
ag, and he has continued to do so at intervals throughout the winter. The
ong is not so loud as that of an adult male, but of the same character. The
ong itself and the attitude of the singer, with quivering and partially out-
pread wings, are essentially Weaver-like.
14th May.--I have been much interested in Mr. C. J. Davies' letter in
he May issue re the wild habits of the Giant Whydah, and am glad to find
hat his observations lead him to agree with my suggestion that this species
lay not be always polygamous. If someone could tell us what [numerical]
roportion the females really bear to the males in an ordinary flock in the
&apos;inter one would be better able to form an opinion. The fact that so very
iw females are imported might lead one to suppose that the females are
ctuallv less numerous, but a correspondent who trapped and imported
Dine Giant Whydahs wrote me that the explanation of the scarcity of
nported females is that the males perch in conspicuous places 011 bushes,
nd are therefore easily taken with bird-lime. He found it impossible to
atcli any females because the latter always took shelter in the long grass.
It would be a very interesting experiment to test the alleged polygamy
f this species bv associating two males and two females in one aviary. Our
lember Mr. W. Willford purchased my adult male and the adult and young
miales, and it is just possible that in the large division of his aviary, which
understand is no less than fifty feet square, the adult male might tolerate
le presence of his son and heir. I atn keeping the young male to ascertain
t what age he may come into colour and, should he do so this summer, I
lall have no further use for him and shall be only too pleased to present
iin to Mr. Willford for this purpose.
I may here mention that this young male has lecently succeeded in

learning the song of the Blackcap, which is certainly quite the oddest
imitation in the way of bird song that I have ever come across. I may also
mention that on the 6th May when I had occasion to catch him, he tried
very hard to frighten me by emitting the loud hissing Weaver-ish note
which, as I have already pointed out, adult males adopt as a means of
defence.
I am glad that Mr. Davies has at last given us an authoritative trans-
lation of the native name, Isakabula , because I have at various times
come across no less than three versions, each quite different.
(iv) The Rufous-backed Mannikin.
I kept some of the young in a cage in my sitting-room for some time
to see how they assumed the adult plumage. All those hied in the early
part of the summer completed the change in one month (except as to the
colour of the beak and a few of the primaries) but one bird bred towards
the end of the season has retained a kind of intermediate plumage, the
head not having become black. I find that they undergo a complete moult
of everv feather except as to the back from the neck to the mmp. Heie,
however. I could detect no sign of a moult, although I handled them con-
stantly, and yet the shade gradually changed from mouse-colour to rich,
dark chestnut. I can only conjecture that in this case there was an actual
change of colour. Isay " I conjecture " because I know that many have
denied the possibility of such a change, and it would certainly be most
difficult to prove. W. K. 1ESCHEMAKER.
A .SUGGESTION.
Sir,--A s the satisfactory cageing of Eagles, Vultures, etc., has for
long been a matter of much difficulty, I venture to put before you a sug-
gestion which, doubtless, many will consider a mad one, though nobody
can deny it would be novel.
Most readers are familiar with the tape-measure that winds itself up
by a spring when released, after having been pulled out to its full extent.
Could not the same principle be applied bv tethering an Eagle or Vulture
in the open, so that it could have the space to fly aloft ?
The length of flight could be controlled by the amount of cord wound
on the cylinder, and the strength of the spring, in conjunction with the
weight of the rope, could be so arranged that the bird would be unable to
pull it out to its full extent, and so receive a severe check in mid-air.
On returning to earth, the coil of cord would automatically wind
itself up. To prevent the bird from severing the cord and to give it a
certain amount of freedom when 011 the ground, t would be necessary to
have several yards of strong but light chain fixed to the end of the cord,
with a button or some kind of stop, placed at the junction to prevent
the chain becoming wound up 011 the cylinder. E Z. S.

MR. FROST IN DEMERARA.
. Most of us have probably read of our member Mr. W. Frost&apos;s safe
&quot;tum to Demerara in our press, but the following from the Deme) ara
laity Argosy for April iotli, kindly supplied by Mr. F. W. Harper, will be
f interest, no doubt.
Mr. Wilfred Frost has just returned from his journev into the
iterior in search of the beautiful bird that occurs there, the "Cock of the
ock." He has succeeded where others have failed, for he has brought
ack with him six living specimens. Their capture, however, entailed a
ist amount of labour and hardship, and at times there was even danger to
fe and limb.
All. 1 lost, who is big and stalwart, and possesses the true spirit ot
ie hunter, is the representative of the well-known naturalist, Sir William
lgram. Some months ago, he brought "Birds of Paradise" from New
uinea to I obago for Sir William, and at the beginning of Januarv he
nnmenced his quest of the " Cock of the Rock," only stuffed specimens
which are to be seen in museums. He was accompanied by Mr. Alfred
'inter, who has spent many years in the interior, and, therefore, was in
i excellent position to act as guide and general adviser.
1 he destination of the party was the Merrimai range of mountains,
iiis is where the "Cock of the Rock" abounds, and the party were
rtunate in getting there just at the time the birds were nesting. This
ade their capture easier, but, all the same, it was not achieved without
me difficulty, the birds being extremely shy. A number were caught by
e Buck Indians, but they died, and the six brought to Georgetown were
ptured by Air. Frost himself, who is an expert in the art of bird-catching.
The journey into the interior was toilsome and trying; but. the return
urney with the birds was even more so. For days at a time, the party's
ogress was stopped by forest swamps, which because of the heavv rain,
se almost breast high. Then, the bush was almost impenetrable at parts,
d the greatest difficulty was experienced in getting along. By water the
ual danger was incurred when the numerous falls were taken. On one
casion, the Buck Indian at the bow of the boat, fell overboard, but

managed to swim ashore at a point lower down. At another time, the
party's boat ran on to a submerged buoy and stuck. The Indians. swamj
ashore, and attempted to pull the canoe off by means of a rope. As they
pulled, the boat tilted over, until the water poured in. At this, Mr. Frost,
who had been holding down the cages in order to prevent them toppling
over with their precious prisoners, sprang out on to a log, thinking, to use
his own significant phrase, that "all was up." This action apparently was
all that was required, for the boat floated off, and Mr. Frost got inside
a&amp;alll *Mr. Frost speaks with pleasure of his experiences in an Indian village.
This consisted of two long houses, and into one of them Mr. Frost and liisj
party went without any ceremony whatever. The occupants were some.I
what surprised, but they soon made the strangers " feel quite at home," and
treated them in the most hospitable manner all the time they remained.
Mr. Frost describes the house or hut as very dark inside, there being ncj
windows. The roof was low, and, as Mr. Frost stands 5 feet 10 inches in liis
stockings, he could never stand erect when within doors. The inmates
were kindness itself, sharing generously whatever food was going--and
there was plenty of it, game being very plentiful. 'I have never comt
across a better lot of people than the Indians I met with there.' That is
Mr. Frost's tribute to them ; and Mr. Winter says it is certainly deserved."

So little is known of the normal limit of age in birds, and
.cmate observations lelating to the age attained are so meagre,
lat it is hoped that these short notes, for the accuracy of which
can vouch, may be not without interest. I have kept birds
ive since 1893. I 11 1896, however, my aviaries were broken up
id, with the exception of two individuals which I was after-
ards able to trace, I have been unable to follow the subsequent
reer of any of my former birds. I11 1899, on my return from
*road, I again started my aviaries, and since then I have, as
fore, kept accurate records of all my birds. These notes
erefore show the age to which certain species can live, but in
&gt; case can it be said that they show the normal length of life,
r, with the exception ot one drake of eleven years, to which
Terence will be made later, none of the birds still living show
&gt; ns of old age, and I cannot recall a death which could be
:ributed definitely to that cause.
My notes on the small birds are remarkably scanty, as,
dng to the difficulty of identifying any particular individual,
:ords of their deaths were not kept. We know, however, that
uiy pet finches have lived 15 to 18 years, doves also reach from
to 20 years, and a few records of Gulls, Owls and Parrots run
11 higher.
In looking through these notes care must be taken not to
neralize, as the average of age in the different families may be

largely due to their adaptability to confinement. For instance,
most of the Waders seem to die after two or three years, and il
might be presumed that they are normally short-lived, till we
also note that one Oystercatcher has lived seven years and three
months and is still living in splendid health and condition.
For the rest, the notes tell their own story. No records
(with one or two special exceptions) of less than a year have
been taken, and in spite of their admitted imperfections, I hope
other readers may be induced to give us some of their records
as only by an accumulation of accurate facts can we hope for
definite knowledge.

6 years 6 months, 1 year 2 months.
Five examples: average 2 years 8 months. I only once
succeeded in getting this species to nest, and then I lost
the hen through egg-binding. The difficulty lay in sexing
the birds; my longest-lived bird, a cock, persistently killed
others put with him in spring, and these on dissection
proved to be cocks. I finally succeeded by introducing
three new birds in autumn, and was then able in the very
early spring to pick out the pair.
28. Scops Owl (Scops giu).
3 years 6 months to 1 year 1 month.
Three examples: average 2 years 7 months. This is not a

failed to rear their young, although Mr. Meade-Waldo had
no trouble with them in this respect. (See A vie. Mag.,

species, but with the one exception they have never lived
beyond a few months. My experience, and it is confirmed
by others, is, that they never become reconciled to confine-
ment and always knock themselves about on the slightest
provocation. They should, therefore, never be placed in an
open cage or aviary.
34. Common Buzzard (Buteo vulgaris).
10 years 4 months, still living, and 4 years 5 months.
These two birds, the only examples of this species I
have had, were hand-reared from the nest in 1899. They
were both females, and the one that died succumbed to
persecution from her sister during the breeding season.
They both belonged to the dark phase, and the plumage
has not altered in the least with age.
35. Sparrow-Hawk. (Accipiter nisus).
3 to 4 months; six examples.
I have on several occasions reared Sparrow Hawks from
the nest. They have, however, never lived longer than
a few months. They are very shy and nervous birds and
must be fed on small birds or mice. They will not live on
butchers' meat. The last ones I had got ill owing to lack
of fresh sparrows, and although fresh sparrows helped to
pull them round, they never recovered.
36. Brack Kite (Milvus migra?is).
10 years, 3 years four months.
I received five examples : four young and one adult in
1900, three of which are still living. They are very hardy
and stand captivity well, the two deaths being due to
fights during the nesting season. They frequently laid
and hatched, but always refused to feed their young. In
Egypt last year, I attempted to rear a pair of young from
about two days old on butchers' meat. They lived for
about a fortnight and then died, their bones being so
spongy and soft that they bent under the weight of their
bodies. ,

be found were it given a large place in which to fly. The
one I kept had the use of a large barn from October on-
wards but was not strong enough to complete its moult
the following summer.
Birds of prey, without exception, are delicate in confine-
ment, and to do well and keep in good plumage want care
and attention. They should not have butchers' meat more
often than necessary, should be fasted on at least one day
a week and be given rats or birds also at least once a week,
if fresh and warm so much the better. They should ?iever,
in my opinion, have an open-air flight, but the aviary
should only be open 011 one side and should face the dryest
and warmest aspect. Water to drink or in which to bathe
is by no means essential.
They should never be given more to eat than they can
finish at a meal, but on the other hand they must not get
too hungry before their next meal. Their appetite varies
with the seasons, and they require more generous feeding
in autumn than at other times of year. If these points be
watched, however, the careful aviculturist will find no great
difficulty in keeping them in health and beautiful feather.
The ' Kestrels' House ' at the Zoological Gardens, although
in bad repair, is to my mind a model house for Raptores,
and the condition of the birds in it at the present time
will bear out my contention. It is. however, doomed to
destruction and will, I fear, probably be replaced by a more
pretentious, but certainly not more suitable, building.

survived their first winter. In confinement this is a hardy
bird once it is acclimatised, but they require careful watch-
ing during their first winter. They will do well in an open
aviary, but must have a good shelter into which they can
retire in bad weather. My herons are always fed entirely
on fish ; they will not do well on butcher's meat, though if
it be given they will take it in preference to their more
natural food. As they are comparatively sedentary birds
they are apt to get corns on their feet from continual
perching on the same spot. This may be obviated by
tying small twigs of varying sizes on the perches so that
the birds never get exactly the same grip. Perches must
of course always be provided, and herons should never be
pinioned.

NESTING OF THE ARGENTINE BLACKBIRD.
Turdus fuscater.
By Percy W. Thorniley.
About the middle of January I received from a dealer,
&apos;horn I had not previously dealt with, a pair of what he described
s South American Blue Thrushes something like blackbirds,
</table>
<bodyText confidence="0.941252666666667" page_id="58072679"  page_num="267" year="" vol="">
/hen they arrived I could not find any blue thrush about them
ut a good deal of blackbird : however I arranged to keep them
5 I had not heard of them being imported before. They were
ither dirty, but otherwise in fair plumage for newly imported
irds, and it was not until they had done a good deal of bathing
lat I was able to make out any difference in the two birds,
hey both looked a dull black, each had a yellow beak and
allow legs, but the colour of the latter not so pronounced as the
ills. It was not before I turned them out that I could distin-
uish any difference in the plumage. The cock is black, but not
ich a good colour as our common blackbird. The hen can be
escribed as a brown black, but at a distance, it is not easy to tell
le sex except that the cock has a yellow iris round the eyes.
11 Sclater's "Argentine Ornithology" they are described as
Uniform brownish black, bill and feet yellow : total length 11*5
iches, wing 5*3 and tail 4*5. Female similar." I11 fact it was
&apos;om this description that I was able to class the birds. It is

Tucuman and met with among the shady trees of the prom-
enades : lias a better song than onr blackbird, which is heard at a
distance, especially in the evening." The whistle is distinctly
loud--they have both a call of two short and one long note, but
none of the wretched war-cry of our common bird.
On February 4th, I noticed the hen going with open bill at
the cock and driving him round the cage ; in fact, she gave him
no peace at all, so the next day, Sunday, being fine and mild, I
decided to turn them out in a fair-sized aviary, 40ft. by 20ft. and
14ft high, which is in a sheltered position. They seemed to
enjoy the change and soon settled down.
O11 the 18th March I saw the hen carrying dried grass into
a nest-box made out of an old cartridge box with two boards
inverted, V-shaped, forming the roof, and hung on the side of
the aviary in the open. O11 the 19th the hen was 011 the nest, so
011 the 20th I took a ladder into the aviarv and found two eggs
in the nest. The next day the third egg was laid which appears
to be the usual clutch. I did not remove the eggs but saw thev
were about the usual size of Blackbirds' eggs, but more like a
Missel Thrush's in markings. The hen sat steadily, only coming
off to feed. O11 the morning of April 2nd, I noticed the hen
breaking up her mealworms, so I concluded she had not sat in
vain. The next day I looked in the nest and found two young
hatched and the last egg chipping, so by that she must have
started sitting from the laying of the first egg. So far all had
gone on swimmingly, because I had had nothing to do with it--
the birds had done it all.
Now the work was to be co-operative, and it remained to
be seen if I could rise to the occasion. About this time the
weather was much colder than when I turned the birds out and
upon going to the aviary, on the morning of the 4th, my hopes
of a medal dropped to zero, for the head of one young one was
hanging out of the nest. However, upon looking into the nest,
I found the other two alive, one much bigger than the other in
fact; I should say the first and last hatched. From now until
the birds left the nest I was kept well on the trot. I looked again
on the 5th and found all well, both old birds feeding steadily. On
the 17th they had very little down left on them and upon going

ito the aviary on the 19th, I found both young ones on the
round, one still a little larger than the other. The young birds
ave black bills with lighter tips, the legs flesh-colour. The
ody is dark brown, the throat and breast lighter, the feathers
ave ashy tips which gives them a speckled appearance.
By the 23rd the hen had re-built the nest and laid two
ggs ; the next day she laid the third. This nest I robbed for two
easons. First, I thought the old birds would neglect the young
nes, and secondly I wanted the eggs to examine. They have a
ale green ground-colour, splashed and dotted all over with rich
ark brown, but more particularly at the large end. They vary
1 size, the largest egg is i 3 \ by H.
O11 the 27th, I saw one of the young ones feeding at the
oft food dish for the first time, but the old birds continued to
ied them until about the 7th May.
At the time of writing the two young ones look as large
s the old birds, and another clutch of eggs have hatched and
ae young are feathering nicely.
If the three blown eggs will be of any interest to the
luseuin, I shall be glad to send them.

of a fine cock Blue Rock-thrush sitting on the edge of a Prickly-

tail upwards much as a Blackbird might do. A Black Chat and a

were in evidence, while from high up the mountain side the
hoarse croak of the Raven could be heard. I11 the dining-room
of the Hotel were two stuffed Rollers ( Coracias garrulus ), a
species which is very plentifully distributed during the summer
months, but it has never been my good fortune to meet with it
alive, except in captivity; also a large dark Eagle Owl, doubtless
referable to the North African form Bubo ascalaphus. In another
room were four Houbara Bustards ( Otis undulata), one being a
very fine bird ; a Night Heron (. Nycticorax griseus), and a Chough
(Pyuhocorax graculus). Canon Tristram found this last species
breeding here in 1857, so it 1S probably still to be met with here,
though I did not see any living birds.
December 1st was a nice bright morning : it was quite
cold and there had been a sharp frost in the night. During the
morning I only noticed some Crag Martins and Sparrows, and I
was glad again to see the House Bunting in one of the Arab
villages. Later in the day I saw two Black Chats sitting 011 a
low wall near the river; they have a noticeable way of jerking
the tail upwards, and the white patch at its base is very con-
spicuous during flight. A Cirl Bunting, some Ultramarine Tits
and hen Algerian Chaffinches were also observed. The Blue
Rock-Thrush must be very abundant here ; I saw three dart out
together near one of the villages ; the second bird was making
dives at the leader, while the third followed a little way behind;
they quickly turned and disappeared behind a wall.
The next morning was rather warmer. I saw nothing fresh,
but a couple of Ravens at pretty close quarters--one was soaring
round and round uttering hoarse caws--a hen Moussier's Bed-
start perched on a cactus, and a Blue Rock-Thrush. Left El
Kantara before 10 ; a little way beyond Batna, a man got into
the train who had evidently been shooting by some neighbour-
ing water ; he had a number of Teal (. Nettium creccd), and other

)licks ; also a fine Black-winged Stilt (Himantopus himantopus&apos;).
*mall birds were numerous ; I noticed two Kestrels and four
,apwings, and I caught sight of a grey bird which I thought
light be a Harrier ; the Pallid Harrier ( Circus macrurus&apos;) is said
) be the commonest species to be met with; it is, however,
ifficult to make out birds clearly from a moving train. As we
ad nearly an hour to wait at El Guerrah, I walked up a steep
icky hill close by but only saw a Grey Wagtail (Motacilla
\elanope) and some White ones near a small stream, also some
,arks.
Arrived at Setif about 7.30 in the evening ; there is
othing of interest in Setif, which is only a modern commercial
)wn. We left it by motor next morning; at first travelling
irough fertile land with hills 011 either side, gradually the hills
icame more and more steep and rugged and closer to the road ;
j" we approached Kerrata, where we stopped for lunch, I saw
&gt;me Ravens, and three beautiful Kites {Milvus viilvus) were seen
irly near, gliding up the valley. I know of no bird more
scinating to watch on the wing than a Kite. A Kestrel and a
rger Bird of Prey were also seen, and a number of small birds;
flock of Rock-doves were flying along the river bed at Kerrata.
11 resuming our journey, the scenery at once became most
and, the road, which descends all the way from Setif, now
:irted round magnificent rocky heights and wound in and out
a wonderful way along the side of a pebbly stream. This is
e famous Chabet Pass, which would certainly be hard to beat
r grandeur anywhere. After passing through the Gorge, the
\0x25A0untry again becomes more open, the hills become clothed with
ees and shrubs ; 011 the lower slopes grow fine cork trees. Soon
impses of the sea are obtained; Olive trees appear; many
dms, Plantains and other fruit trees are grown ; and you pass
rough extensive vineyards; then the road skirts the Gulf of
&gt;ugie. It is extremely pretty as you look down first 011 the blue
iter, then across to Bougie nestling at the foot of the green
)pes of a hill jutting out into the sea and forming one arm
the Bay. We reached Bougie just before dark; it was much
ilder here.
The 4th was a bright summer-like day. I11 the morning I

Mr. T. H. Newman,
walked out as far as Cape Carbon ; the steep path runs above the
sea, while on the other side is a dense tangle of scrub, prickly
oak and other shrubs, among which a fine heath three or four
feet high was growing, ranging in colour from pure white to
deep pink; behind rose high rocks. This scrub was full of birds
which were, however, very wild and dived into cover as one
approached. I heard Blackbirds, and by watching saw some Tits,
probably^ Ultramarine, but they may have been Mediterranean
Great Tits; Blackcaps were very numerous. I saw two greenish-
brown Warblers, apparently belonging to the genus Hypolais , blit
I could not make out the species; a Black Redstart, and some
Chaffinches, Algerian I expect. Ravens were heard high up
among the rocks. On the way back I detected a Tree-creeper on
the trunk of an Olive tree; the North-West African bird is
rather darker in colouration than ours ; it has been given the
name of Certhia familiaris brachydactyla on account of its some-
what shorter hind-claw. In contrast to the other birds were
some Serin Finches, which several times flew into the tree under
which I was standing; this charming little bird reminds me
rather of a Siskin in the way it balances itself among the small
twigs. Interesting papers about this bird appeared in Vols. II.
and IV. of our Magazine, the latter containing an account of its
nesting in captivity. In the town I saw a small green Ring-
)\0x25A0
necked Parrakeet in a cage, and on the balcony of a private
house was a large cage with about twenty small foreign birds in
it
In the afternoon of the next day I climbed up Mount
Gouraia, which lies to the back of the town ; from the top were
obtained magnificent views of the Gulf in front, while range
upon range of mountain-chains stretched inland as far as the eye
could reach ; the slopes are covered with a thick mass of scrub,
and a plantation of Aleppo Pines grows about two-thirds of the
way up. Many birds were about but were very shy ; I saw and
heard Blackbirds and Ravens, and on the way down I saw a fine
P&apos;alcon flying along the face of some precipitous cliff--it looked
like a Peregrine--and just as dusk was coming on three Barbary
Partridges flew across the road just in front. Some Lapwings
vyere also seen near the town.

O11 the following morning I saw two Barbary Partridges in
iges, and noticed a couple of White Whgtails. Verv few Spar-
es were seen at Bougie, which we left before eleven o'clock in
e 11101 ning, tiavelling all day through fertile plains with fine
11s more 01 less neai ; at one place the ground was covered
ith a thick growth of low scrub Palms. We arrive at Algiers
:ortly after seven o'clock.
Next day the Museum at Mustavo Superieur was visited ;
contains a dilapidated collection of dusty stuffed birds and
animals, apparently nothing of much interest and onlv few in
lmbei. I11 the gardens of the Governor's summer palace was
'small round enclosure which contained some Barbary Doves,
so one Turtle Dove and a hybrid Turtle x Barbary. On the
T following the beautiful Botanical Gardens, known as the
rdin d'Essai, were visited ; there is a poor little Zoo there with
ly a very few birds, but I noticed a nice Desert Buzzard. The
strich enclosure was covered with a mass of beautiful purple
d scarlet Bougainvilleas.
O11 the morning of the 9th I again visted the Jardin
Sssai, but only saw Sparrows, Blackbirds, Pipits and some
arblers which seemed to belong to the genus Phylloscopus ; and
11st caught sight of a very small bird, possibly a Wren. Dur-
? the night there was a sharp thunder-storm accompanied by
il.
December 10th was devoted to an excursion to the Gorges
la Clififa ; you go by train to Blidah, where a fine stud of Arab
d Barb horses may be seen, and drive about ten miles, passing
ough extensive Orange groves and vineyards, to the entrance
the Gorges; just before arriving there we stopped to see a
all cave. On the other side of the road were some steep rocks
tli ivy and other greenery growing over them, among which
re fully a dozen Barbary Apes (Alacacus hums&apos;) ; they were not
all shy, and were only a few feet above our heads. They dis-
rbed stones and sticks which almost fell 011 our heads below ;
/eral were of considerable size, and some had small young
nging to them; they kept uttering a sort of grunting note,
the garden of the Inn at the head of the Gorge were a pair of
rbary Partridges, the cock being in very good plumage ; below

them was a small Ape. We walked some distance down the
Gorge ; its sides are very steep and high, and at one place where
water was trickling down, the whole face of the cliff was covered
with a beautiful veil of Maiden-hair ferns, while a pretty little
yellow Narcissus was growing among the rocks. At one place
more Apes were seen; there were only some few small bird?
about, among these some Tits. On the opposite side of the
valley, in a shallow depression in the rocks, a large flock of Rock-
doves were sunning themselves and sheltering from the very
cold and keen wind which was blowing. I watched them for
some time; every now and then a bird would fly from one point
to another so that their backs became plainly exposed to view;
they were a good way up the cliff, so I may after all be mistaken,
but I am of decided opinion that none of these birds had white
rumps; there could be no question of the birds having been
contaminated by tame birds in this remote spot, so that this
appeared to be a genuine flock of Columba livia s chimp eri, which
however only differs from the typical Rock-dove by being a
little lighter in shade and by having the rump light grey like
the back. Numerous instances are on record of blue-rumped
Rock-doveshaving been obtained in Tunisia and Algeria; Mr.
J. H. Gurney, jun., observed and procured specimens in Algeria
in 1870, and Mr. Whitaker has examples from Tunisia and
Morocco; but generally these have been obtained from among
flocks of typically-coloured birds and have been supposed to
have been the result of crosses with domestic birds. There must
have been at least a hundred birds in the flock I saw. Suddenly
the form of a great bird appeared over the top of the cliffs; it
was a magnificent Bearded Vulture (Gypaetus barbatus) easily
recognisable from its large size and long wedge-shaped tail ; it
sailed rapidly across the valley on motionless wings, going at a
great rate without seeming to make the slightest effort; it passed
and repassed overhead several times, a wonderful sight, worth
going many miles to see.
While walking up one of the steep narrow streets of
Algiers, which led up to the Chasbah, next da\% I came across a
pair of Barbary Partridges in a cage hanging up over a vegetable
shop; the proprietor showed me the birds, which were very

me, he let the hen bird out of the cage; I agreed to buy them
id brought them back with me. The Barbary Partridge is
ry closely allied to the familiar Red-legged bird, differing from
by having the crown of the head chestnut-red, the cheeks and
roat bluish-grey instead of white, and the collar round the
ck chestnut-red not black ; they are very handsome birds, and
ese were so tame that I got quite fond of them. They were
id to have been caught young, and I expect they had lived
the small cage I saw them in ever since.
We left Algiers at mid-day on the 12th on our return voyage
Marseilles. A number of Gulls were flying about the neigh-
urliood of the harbour; I recognised many Lesser Black-
cked, mostly adults, but some large dark grey young birds
obably belonged to this species; also several Yellow-levered
irring.Gulls, and Black-headed Gulls were well represented;
arge flock which seemed to be entirely composed of this last
ecies followed the boat. Some Whales were seen sporting
&gt;se to the ship. We had a very calm passage ; next morning
p Yellow-legged Herring Gulls were in sight. We arrived
tside Marseilles early in the afternoon ; here a great many
ack-headed and a few Yellow-legged Herring Gulls were
ing about.

I was much interested to see in the April number of the

resemblance to a dark-coloured Bantam is really quite extra-
ordinary. Their general colour is chocolate brown, more rufous
on the under surface of the wings; the bill and feet are pink,
and they have a small comb of the same colour. The cock is a
distinctly darker bird than the hen.
They frequent the ironstone ridges which intersect a large
part of the more inland parts of the country, and which are
covered with bamboo growth varied here and there with patches
of thin scrub. Here they are found in pairs or small parties of
about half a dozen, which lie very closely, and prefer to trust to
their powers of hiding rather than their wings, as they will wait
till almost trodden on before moving, and then they either scuttle
away, exactly like frightened chickens, dodging in and out the
rocks, or rise with a scuffle and scattering of dust to fly rapidly
away for a few yards and then drop again into shelter. They
never appear to perch 011 trees or to move far away from their
customary haunts, and they must also be able to get along with
very little water, at any rate during the dry season, for then there
is never any on the hills they frequent, and one never sees them
like other Game-birds going to or from water. Their note is a
low-pitched whistle. They are not at all easy birds to shoot,
as they are only flushed with difficulty, and even then are
usually out of sight again in a second. If one is wounded it
will generally be lost, as it will probably manage to struggle
away into some hole in the rocks. In such holes, which are
often very deep, they nest, commencing to lay about the end of
May. The young after leaving the nest remain with their
parents for some time. Their food must be found chiefly, if not
entirely, 011 the ironstone hills, as one never sees them on the
cultivated ground. It probably consists mainly of the seeds of
bamboos and various grasses with a considerable addition of
insect-life as well. I had one in captivity for some time ; it ate
any of the common native corns and was also very fond of boiled
rice, while white ants, when obtainable, were always greedily
devoured. Although so common here, I have never heard of one
being caught by the natives, who catch a good many of our
Common Bush-fowls (Francolins) in primitive traps or horse-
hair nooses.

INTRODUCTION.
The following notes on some of the Birds of Paradise are
:hiefly from observations made during various visits to New
Guinea and some of the adjacent islands for the purpose of
&gt;rocuring living specimens of these remarkable and beautiful
&gt;irds, and date back from my first visit in 1903 up to the present
ear. Unfortunately I am writing these notes entirely from
nemory, not having brought my note-books out with me to
sTew Guinea; hence they will not be so comprehensive as they
night otherwise have been. Likewise I much regret having 110
vorks of reference with me. for I constantly read remarks about
hese birds which are altogether wrong, and some purely im-
ginative and needing correcting. Except perhaps in the British
art of New Guinea few white men have had an opportunity of
feeing the rarer species in their native haunts, as these all inhabit
tie mountains which, apart from their steepness, are the most
laccessible in the whole world, and only to be approached
trough swamps and tangled jungle, the abode of fever and
ostile natives, not to speak of insect plagues and other dis-
omforts. Unlike the feathered inhabitants of these parts, the
uman animal is of the lowest, and travelling alone, as I have
itherto done, I have found it requires all one's resolution
rouglit to bear to keep from succumbing to the gloom and
meliness of it all.
After landing my consignments in England I have had
ut little opportunity to study them after they have settled down
&gt; aviary-life, when so much might be found out about them,
specially about their various modes of display, but often the little
have observed has quite upset theories I had formed during
ie time some of the species where in my charge. Doubtless, in
me, Mr. Brook, of Hoddam Castle, will be able to give us all
&gt;rts of interesting information about Paradise Birds under these
mditions, for he has the finest living collection ever brought to-
other, comprising 110 less than nineteen species, some of them the
ost beautiful of the whole family. The cult of the Paradise-

Bird may be said to have commenced in 1904, when I brought over
a small consignment for Mrs. Johnstone, consisting of one Greater
Bird, two Lesser Birds, two Kings, and a pair of Black Manucodes.
I always feel that aviculturists are much indebted to Mr. and
Mrs. Johnstone, whose liberality in providing the means to fit
out expeditions has enabled them to see these birds established
as inmates of the aviaries at home, also on the show benches,
while numbers have been on exhibition at the Zoo. Later, Sir
William Ingram and Mr. Brook have both sent out expeditions
for the same purpose, and been the means of introducing still
further species to this country. These importations have con-
clusively proved one thing, that Paradise Birds are by no means
so delicate as they were atone time supposed to be; in fact, I
think it may safely be said that generally they are hardy birds.
So far none have bred in captivity, but I see no reason why they
should not do so, and I feel sure, now that the treatment of them
is better understood, that before long we shall hear of success in
this direction. It is only about three years ago that the first
females of any species were imported.
These notes will be confined to those I have imported alive,
which, with the Gardener Bower Birds, consists of twenty species,
namely : The Greater (. Paradisea apoda), the Lesser (P. minor),
the Red ( P . rubra). Count Raggi's (P. raggaina), the Twelve-wired
(Seleucides ?iigrica?is ), the Port Moresby Rifle-Bird ( Ptilorhis
biterccdens), the King ( Cicinnurus regius), Hunstein's Magnificent
(.Diphyllodes hunsteini ), the Lesser Superb ( Lophorhina minor),
Lawes' Six-plumed (. Parotia lawsei), D'Alberti's Southern (. Dre -
pa?iornis cervinicauda), Meyer's Sickle-Bill ( Epimachus meyeri),
the Princess Stephanie's (Astra?chia stephanice). Prince Rudolph's
( Paradisomis rudolphi), the Black Manucode ( Manucodia aira),
the Purple-violet Manucode (flZ. purpureo-violacea ), the Green
Manucode (M. viridis). Lady McGregor's ( Loria maria), and two
specimens of Gardener Bower Birds (. Amblyomis subala?&apos;ts and
A. inornata). * * * *
The Greater Bird of Paradise (Paradisea apoda).
The Aru Islands off the S.W. coast of New Guinea are
usually considered the chief home of this species, but it also
inhabits the mainland in the interior south of the Charles Louis

and the Snow Mountains, which form the dividing line N. and
S. between the Greater and Lesser Birds. We have recently met
with it on the upper Mannika River, but it was not until we had
gone nearly 40 miles inland that we first heard their cry, and so
far they appear not to be at all common. The natives had often
brought the plumes to trade at the base camp, and I took them
to belong to the Lesser Bird, because being always old and dirty
it was impossible to recognise them. When I first heard their
-all up the liver it struck me as sounding too vigorous for P.
minor , and I remarked it to one of our party at the time ; then
ater on, when specimens were brought in, I saw they were apodas ,
but certainly smaller than those from the Arus. The Dutch have
ately been exploring several of the rivers down this coast, and I
lave heard that in each case no Paradise Birds were met with
intil they had got some considerable distance inland.
I11 the Aril Islands it is by 110 means distributed equally
M over the group, but confined to the deepest jungle of the
xtreme interior where the trees are tallest, and it requires a
tood gun to reach them at all.
I first went to the Arus in December 1903. This was
*efore the advent of the pearl fishers from Thursday Island, and
was at that time the only Kuropean in the country. I made
*ilbattabatta my headquarters. It was then a flourishing village
ir along the north bank of the Wanumbai channel. These
urious channels intersect the Islands from one side to the other
nd wind about in every direction. Some are navigable for
hallow draught boats, and through others only the smallest
anoes can pass. As the islands are very flat, the banks of most
f them present an unbroken line of mangoose swamp, but 011
ae Wanumbai channel the jungle conies down to the water's
dge, except round the villages where the ground is more or less
leared. The Silbattabattas were at war with the Wanumbais of
le south banks of the channel, so my search for birds had to be
onfined solely to the forests on the north shore. I soon saw it
&apos;as useless for anyone to come out here thinking they would be
ble to catch or shoot apodas themselves, for the natives look
pon the birds absolutely as their own property. This is hardly
&gt; be wondered at when the trade in skins has been carried 011

Mr. Walter Goodfellow,
for generations; and, though this was one of the earliest species
known, there is practically still everything to learn about them.
Dr. Wallace, some fifty or more years ago, was the first to throw
any real light on their habits.
I had been established at Silbattabatta quite two weeks
without seeing or even hearing the sound of an apoda , although
I was out in the bush every day with native guides; and I was
sure they purposely led me away from the district they frequented.
At last I came to an understanding with them, and promised if
they took me to their grounds I would give them a present for
every one I shot. This they agreed to do, and the next morning
I set out with six men, who took me, after about three hours walk,
to a part of the forest which was different in appearance from any
I had yet seen. The trees were taller, and the undergrowth not
nearly so dense; and, instead of the usual coral rock, which
seems to crop up everywhere in the Aru forests, the ground was
covered with beautiful lycopodium moss, which made walking
much easier. It was not long before I heard those loud ringing
calls which I have since learnt to know so well, but it is im-
possible to convey to anyone the thrill it sent through me at the
time; the whole surroundings were mysterious, the green gloom
of the jungle with its strange vegetation, my silent, wild-looking,
dark-skinned companions, and then to be at last so near to the
birds I had come so far to see. A little further, and there in the
tops of the high trees were sixty or seventy restlessly flying from
branch to branch, picking a fruit here and there and apparently
not at all afraid, although they could plainly see us below. I
found at this season the males were all out of plumage, but I
noticed several had the yellow heads, but the majority of them
appeared to be females or young males. Feeding in the same
trees were several Black Manucodes, a couple of which I shot,
a fine Cat-bird, and, on my way back, my first King Bird. I
learnt from the natives that the dancing-trees, which are used by
the birds only when they are in plumage, were still some distance
further on. Every tribe claims the trees in their district, and
should a man from another tribe trespass on the preserves of the
other it means war, unless they are sufficiently friendly through
intermarriage for the matter to be settled by the chiefs. In such

a case a fine is usually demanded in the form of bronze trade
gongs, obtained through the Chinese traders in Dobo. The
dispute with the Wanumbais had originated in this way, and,
when I arrived in the district, fighting had been going on in-
termittently for two seasons. Peace was concluded before I left,
as an even number had been killed on both sides. The Silbatta-
battas kept the heads they had captured suspended from a tree
in the middle of the village, just facing my house, and it was
somewhat weird to hear them speak of each head by name,
giving details of family history and the manner in which he
was killed. I may add that these particulars were not always
creditable to the captors, and in almost every case showed the
grossest treachery.
In 1904 apoda skins were fetching forty shillings each in
Dobo (the one trading station of the islands) and this price
appears to have increased last year to fifty and fifty-five shillings,
owing to a great decrease in the numbers. About four years ago
Customs were established in Dobo, and a ten per cent, export
duty levied on the skins. The collector of Customs kindly gave
me the returns for the first year, which amounted roughly to
1,100 skins of apodas. These figures would include only those
sent away in bulk. There would certainly be more taken out
in personal baggage and not declared. A European firm in
Makassar, now takes, by contract with the Chinese, the whole of
the skins obtained during the season. Their numbers must have
considerably diminished during the last few' years, as when I
passed through Makassar last June, I was told that about 650
only were collected the previous season, and this is not because
the birds are less hunted than formerly; 011 the contrary, they
were never so persecuted as they are now.
The apodas resort to the same dancing trees year after year,
and at the commencement of the season (March) the owners of
the trees are able, before the birds' plumes are quite mature, to
estimate almost to a skin the number they will obtain when
shooting commences. A chief once told me that the preceding
year he was only one bird out in his calculations, more or less, I
quite forget now. This really means that each year possibly not
one full-plumaged bird escapes. Formerly they were all shot

with blunt arrows, but now in some districts the natives art
supplied with guns by the traders, and some possess guns o
their own. When arrows are used the hunter is concealed unde:
a shelter of boughs placed over a small platform in an adjoining
tree. I have never been in the Aril Islands during the actua
shooting season, but I have seen many of these platforms re
maining in situ , and others in course of construction for the
approaching time, and in no case were they ever in the dancing
trees themselves. The heads of the arrows are of several shapes
some are flat and round on the top, much the same as a lotus
when gone to seed, but not so large ; others are merely a knot
of wood, but the more usual shape has three blunt projecting
spurs, cut from the natural fork of a branch. The display is
called " Sakaleli," which is the word used generally for the native
war-dances. The shooter takes up his position in the tree at
daybreak, as the birds assemble at seven a.m. and again in the
late afternoon, but the morning dance is the most important. Il
the Greater Bird is anything like the Lesser he is in such a state
of excitement at these times that he would not be disturbed
.much even by the report of a gun, but I shall have more to say
about this when writing of the Lesser Bird. The males are in
full plumage by the end of April, and remain so until November,
when they commence to moult. In England they appear to
reverse the seasons, which is a pity, as comparatively few people
see them at the Zoological Gardens when they are at their best
during the winter. In captivity they lose the rich golden yellow
on the head, which becomes a very pale straw colour, as it does
also in skins. Strange to say, a full-plumaged male, which I
brought home last year, had a broad band of white round the
nape, becoming narrower at the sides as it reached the green of
the throat. When last I saw it the white colour was very con-
spicuous, but probably after it has moulted out, and the yellow
head become paler, it will scarcely be noticeable at all. This
bird is in the Hoddam Castle aviaries, and is otherwise perfectly
normal. Apodas quickly become tame in captivity, especially
in a cage. The old male, which lived for so long at the Zoo,
became quite tame within three weeks after he was caught, and
displayed every day as far as his limited cage-room allowed, even

n board a ship in the Indian Ocean during the S -W. monsoon,
dien the boat rolled so much that it was impossible to keep
;ater in the tins unless very deep. In their native forests they
re not accustomed to take any long flights, neither is there any
eed for them to do so, when all the trees are in one inextricable
angle. They have the same zigzag way of ascending trees in
onimon with all the Paradise Birds.
The nesting season appears to commence in December,
ast as the males have gone out of plumage, for I had an egg
rought to me early in that month, during my last visit to the
slands, and a few days later the same native took another to Sir
Villiam Ingram's collector, who was staying in the same district,
&apos;he man said he got them both from the same nest, but there was
remarkable difference in the colouring of the two. While Mr.
&apos;ratt's was almost white, with comparatively few markings, mine
fas very pink and richly streaked all over, but more especially
t the base. At the same time, together or apart, there could be
o question as to their being the eggs of a Paradise Bird. The
ative who brought them being a particularly stupid person, not
peaking much Malay, I could get no satisfactory information
*0111 him about the nest, whether it was high up or low down.
11 all probability it was low down like the raggiana&apos;s, and that
.vo eggs is the usual number, with a possible three at times,
hiring the first week in January Mr. Pratt had a young apoda
rought to him alive, which a native had caught in the jungle,
t must have fallen from the nest, as it was able to fly but little,
&apos;he wings seemed to be developed out of proportion to the rest
f the body, with the exception of the legs and feet, which, even
t this age, were almost the normal size of those of an adult bird.
Lidging from the young raggianas I reared from the nest two
ears ago, this is the usual development, and in my notes on that
pecies I shall have more to say about it. The young apoda ,
ith the help of its strong feet and claws, climbed about the
aim-leaf walls of the native house and even up 011 to the rafters.
: was some weeks before it used its wings for flight, although
ad it remained in the jungle it would have flown long ago, but
1 captivity, owing to adverse circumstances, its development
as retarded. The thighs remained perfectly bare of feathers

Mr. Walter Goodfellow,
for quite two months after it was brought in, as also did tli
throat and forehead. I noticed the same thing with th
ragoia?ias, that the parts which are green in the adult male wer
the last to acquire any feathers. The eyes were brownish viole
at first, but gradually became browner after the first month
which colour they apparently retain tor the first year. Judging
from subsequent experience, I should say that this bird was quit
three weeks old when it was caught, and had it remained in tin
bush it would have fed itself in a few more days, but in captivit&apos;
it made no attempt to do so until fully a month later. Whethe
it eventually lived to get to England I never heard. I thinl
there can be no doubt that almost, if not all, the family an
polygamous, and certainly those of this genus are.
The Aru natives have various ways of catching Paradise
Birds, and probably now, along the Wanumbai channel at am
rate, they are more expert at it than ever they were, as severa
collectors have been out there within the last few years
Formerly the few apodas kept in captivity had been stunned b\
the hunters' blunt arrows, and were often more or less injured,r
broken wing being the usual injury. Now they catch them bj
means of snares placed in the feeding-trees, or better still, in the
dancing-places. Bird-lime, prepared from the sap of the guttr
percha tree, is also much used, but makes the birds in a fearfulh
sticky condition. Unlike some of the other members of the
family, there is no difficulty about getting newly-caught apodas tc
feed. Being greedy birds they take readily to almost any kind of
fruit, and even to the mixture used at home for insectivorous
birds. Unless they are freely supplied at first with live insects
or some animal food I have found them liable to fall off in con-
dition and die. I have found the yolk of hard-boiled egg the
best preventative for this, and when once they have taken to it I
had no further fear for them. It is a difficult matter to get a thin
bird back to condition. For one apoda I allowed the yolk of one
e &amp;g P er day. I have found it quite impossible to keep two males
of this species together, at any rate in a cage, and I always
thought it would be impossible in an aviary also, but recently in
Amboina I saw three adult males together in a not very large
aviary, but they were mixed up with parrots, pigeons, and other

rds, which probably was the reason they did not fight. When
ice they start to fight they usually both get killed, as with
eir powerful claws they grip each other's throats and peck the
es out, and even when taken in the hands it is all but im-
&gt;ssible to separate them. It is also risky to place even a true
iir together in a cage, for, undoubtedly at certain seasons of
e year the sexes separate, and as likely as not the female will
tack the male, and perhaps injure him fatally, or else worry
m so that he does not get sufficient to eat, and dies.
Although in their native islands they are accustomed to
e same tropical temperature nearly all the year round, they
em to be able to stand a good deal of cold in England, and
en on the voyage over I have found them far less susceptible
cold and variations in the temperature than some of the
ountain species naturally used to a certain amount of cold.
The last time I was collecting in the Artis I took down
ith me a couple of male Red Birds of Paradise from Waigiou.
t Dodo I hired a large prau, on which I lived for ten days,
:ploring some of the intricate channels I have already spoken
, on the look out for a good collecting ground. The rubras
ges were placed on deck, and often in the early mornings the
&gt;odas on shore replied to their calls, and even once or twice
owed themselves in the trees at the water's edge.
As I have remarked before, the males commence to assem-
e irregularly in the dancing-trees even before the moulting
ason is completely over. Occasionally it happens that a recog-
sed dancing-tree is tabooed by the birds for a whole season, or
;rhaps longer ; indeed I heard of one tree which was deserted
r three whole seasons, although the old chief of the district
id never before remembered a season when it had not been
ied. Of course this was put down to the fault of the shooters'
tio had failed to duly propitiate the spirits, or had not given
em the first offerings, which usually consist of the legs of the
st bird shot that year. These are fastened to the trunk of the
ee, together with a small bunch of plumes; in fact, a bird is
ldom shot without a few of the plumes being pulled out and
ruck into the tree somewhere. A traveller, unacquainted with
1 e custom and coming upon a dancing-tree in the jungle, would

be puzzled to understand the meaning of the miscellaneoi
offerings piled around. These consists of bronze trade gong
china plates and bowls, empty cartridge cases, mysterious packe
tied up in leaves, half cocoanut-shelis containing offerings
tobacco, betel nut, &amp;c., also with copper coins, and sometim
even silver. A recognised ritual of incantation is made win
the offerings are placed there and great privacy preserved, as
would not do for another person to see it.
W itliout my notes I have quite forgotten the native At
name for the apoda , but the usual Malay trade name of " buron
mate ' dead birds, is understood everywhere. The name orig
nated through the early Malay traders knowing them only froi
the dead skins. In travelling through the Archipelago on m
way back to Singapore, it often sounded strange, when stoppin
at some island, to hear one Malay call to another " to come an
see the live dead birds."
On our first journey of exploration recently up the Minik
River, I was much impressed one day by a comparison betwee
man, as he is in those parts, and the so-called lower animals, a
represented by this beautiful highly-developed species of Paradis
Bird. After travelling for five days up the river, we had tha
evening come in touch with the first of the upper river tribee
The following morning, as we approached a mud bank, we fount
some wild-looking, naked men, waiting for us, who, on th
approach of our canoes, threw themselves on the ground ant
rolled and wallowed in black slimy mud and plastered it ove
their heads and faces so that every part of their bodies wa
covered with it. More degraded objects it would be impossiblt
to conceive, yet while all this repulsive exhibition was going 01
some Greater Birds of Paradise were feeding and calling in tilt
trees just over their heads. The contrast between the two coulc
not have failed to strike most people.
We have found two names on the Minika for the apoda-
" tamuku " and "yau."

Greenshank. Totanus glottis.
Blanford, quoting Oates, gives the bill of the Greenshank
lark olive-brown, darker at the tip ; I have found it French-
y, with the tip black.
Ruff and REEVE. Pavoncella fugnax.
Blanford gives the legs and feet of these birds as fleshy
ow to yellowish-brown in adults; I have usually found them
gilt orange, and the bill is often orange at the base. Many
cimens in the Calcutta Bazaar had portions of the toes miss-
1, the stumps being quite healed over, and deformed claws
e also common. It would be interesting to know what causes
ects so extremely rare, otherwise, among wild birds, and
ecially why they should occur in this very hardy species.
Red-necked Phalarope. Phalaropiis hyperboreiis.
Between Aden and Bombay, in 1907, I saw many flocks of
ilaropes, which were very wild, and rose at a distance from
ship.
Painted Snipe. Rostratula capensis.
A young bird of this species which I obtained before it
: fledged, and reared, feeding it upon maggots and canary-
1 given in water, "swore" and showed off its wings like an
It. I have seen one of these birds drive off the Eastern
den Plover ( Cha?ad?ins Julvus), a bird pugnacious enough to
r e a Ruff, by this wing-displav.
Gull-billed Tekn. Sterna anglica.
This bird would be better called the Gull-legged Tern, for
most noticeable difference from other Terns is in the longer
and consequently easy walk, unlike the waddle of Terns
ierally. One I got for the Calcutta Zoo devoured maggots
-dilv. Terns were constantlv sold in the Calcutta market in
j j
time as Plovers, when the fraud could be worked, and a fine
lection could easily be obtained by any aviculturist finding
self there in winter.

Shay Notes o?i Indian Birds.
Sooty Tern. Ster?ia fuliginosa.
As Terns are supposed to swim but little, I may menti
that I have seen three of this species swimming together in t
Red Sea.
Indian Skimmer. Rhynchops albicollis.
I have had specimens of this curious bird and found th
would take shrimps and fish from the hand, though owing to t
" under-shot" formation ol the bill they could not pick them 1
from the ground.
White or Roseate Pelican. Pelecanus onocrotalus.
The Calcutta Zoo obtained a full-plumaged pair in my til
from Europe, and these, to my great astonishment, changed ba
into immature plumage and then back again to full colour.
Little Cormorant. Phalacrocorax javanicus.
This bird is supposed to have a young plumage much li
that of the young of our Common Cormorant ( P . carbo ), and
certainly saw some of these brown white-breasted birds amor
the fledged young of the wild colony of the species in t
Calcutta Zoo ; but the colouration of most of the young I saw
Calcutta was black like that of the parents, though some I rear*
and sent to the Calcutta Zoo, where they were kept confine
assumed the supposed immature plumage later on. The nestin
down is black, but there is none on the forehead, and the bare sk
there is white like human skin, giving a very comical effect. Tli
species walks, either in a semi-erect or horizontal position, we
enough, and is active on trees; I have seen a young bird turn i
head back to sleep, with the wings still spread out, after it In
been in this well-known Cormorant pose. My captive birds pr
duced no castings, like the Shag (Z 3 . graculus ), and unlike tl
Common Cormorant.
Indian Darter or Snake Bird. ( Plotus melanogaster&apos;).
In this bird the down of the young is white. I have see
a captive one asleep with the wings still expanded, so, takin
this evidence with that of the last species, I think Newton w&amp;lt;
wrong in doubting the fishermen's statement that our Cormorai
may sleep in this position.

Sir,--A t the annual spring sale of the Antwerp Zoological Garden,
bought a pair of Emblema picta, which I kept for some time in a large
gilt cage of my bird house.
As the weather got warmer, now some three weeks ago, I put the
:tle birds in a warm sheltered out-door aviary.
The birds seemed to like the change very much ; their plumage and
aieral condition improved, and the male began to sing a good deal. This
tie song is very simple and not much of a song in any way, but he seems
take great pains about it, and looks very proud when he is at it.
The birds after a while began to collect nesting material in a square
\0x25A0x, and built a large, dome-shaped nest, using the material of two
iinmon Wrens' nests and one Robins'.
As the birds are since a few days only visible in turns, I presume that
ey have eggs, and are incubating.
Emblema picta are very quiet little birds, which in many of their
tie ways remind me of the Red-shouldered Finch from Africa ( Pytelia
cenicoptera).
Rather striking is the pearl-white iris of these birds which gives them
sharp expression.
Gooilust , 27th May. - F. E. Bi.aauw.
THE PIN-TAILED WHYDAH.
Sir,--I have to thank Mr. Teschemaker for his courtesy in obtaining
much information as he was able to secure respecting the breeding of
is species in captivity. Unfortunately it leaves the question of the
rasitic nature of the bird just where it was.
Haagner is mistaken if he asserts that Roberts mentioned any other
ds than Waxbills as hosts to Vidua principalis : he specifies Estrilda
&apos;rilda and Estrilda dufresnii, and recommends African oologists to
amine with greater care all nests of Waxbills which they may come
ross.*
Mr. Teschemaker asks why I do not settle the question once for all
breeding the species. He says I have leisure, suitable aviaries and
perience. In reply I may say that my experience has not helped me
ich in breeding species, for the simple reason that my aviaries are not
d never were suitable for breeding most birds--certainly not for Whydahs,
ice they contain no growing grasses. I have also abolished one of my
t-door aviaries, because it only produced me one young bird in two
Hrs ; whereas, as a plant-house, it will be most useful.
Excepting in the winter months I have very little leisure, or have
t had hitherto, for I have been constantly occupied in the " making of
y the way I wrongly quoted the article as 2nd Ser., Vol. I; it should be xst Ser. Vol. III.

MR. FROST'S CORRECTION.
The return of Mr. Frost from Demerara with the collection he h.
there made for Sir William Ingram, is of course the great avicultural evei
of the month. The birds are now on deposit at the Zoological Gardens, ai
the six Cocks of the Rock (Rupicola crocea) four adult and two immatu
males, are attracting great attention. This species, however, has bee
represented at the Gardens before, and the really greatest novelty of tl
collection is a little Manakin, apparently the female of the Blue-backe
species (Chiroxiphia pareola), the first of this South-American group
fruit-eating birds to be imported. In appearance it is not unlike the he
VioletTanager, but larger; the male would be black, with a turquoise-bh
back and scarlet crest expanding transversely when erected.

A PET CASSOWARY.
Ccisuarius picticoliis.
By E. J. Brook.
Visitors to the Zoological Gardens can see the subject of
hese remarks in the Cassowary house. The bird is the Painted-
lecked Cassowary, and was caught by Mr. Goodfellow in Papua
ibout fifteen months ago, being then a small chick of about a
ortnight old.
The bird accompanied the expedition during the whole of
ts wanderings. At 10,000 feet "Kitty," as the bird was named,
elt the cold a good deal, and I believe passed many a night
ucked up in Mr. Goodfellow's bed. When " Kitty " first reached
ny aviaries she was a delightful pet, would follow anywhere like
dog, and loved to race and play with children.
During all last autumn and most of the winter the Casso-
wary passed wandering practically where she liked, doing little
amage, except in the rock garden, which she stripped of every
iempervivum she could reach, the round balls of the plants
eing swallowed like pills. As the bird grew she got rather too
udependent, hiding herself when shutting up time came, and
ccasionally straying long distances anti causing much astonish-
lent at various farms she visited. On one of these journeys she
wain the river Annan--this was in January--and the river was
mining cold and big, but the cold water did her no harm,
&apos;here is nothing "Kitty" hates more than a dog; on one occa-
on she chanced to see a hound in the park that was on its way
) the kennels, having been left out the previous day, she caught
lat hound and gave it the worst licking it ever had in its life.

Mr. W. E. Teschemaker,
I was really sorry to part with " Kitty," but it was quite
necessary to do so as she took to kicking and is enormously
powerful. I noticed that this bird was particularly fond of a
mud bath, she would wallow in any dirty ditch, and when dry
the soil would shake out of her liair-like feathers, leaving her
clean and glossy.
For food she took household bread and potatoes chiefly,
she was also fond of well-boiled rice, but a bowl of dry " B. C. "
food was looked upon as a particular treat. Apples cut into
irregular pieces, also cabbage leaves and bits of the stalks were
much appreciated. Earth worms, small birds and mice were
swallowed whole. "Kitty" was only ill once, and that for only
a short time after eating a number of wire staples.
Cassowaries should have a fairly long trough to drink out
of;-they do not suck the water up, but take a long sweeping
scoop with the beak wide open, and they find a great difficulty
in scooping up enough water from a round vessel such as a
bucket.

Serimis sulphur a tus.
By W. E. Teschemaker, B.A.
This Seedeater is one of the most charming songsters:
brilliant in colour, the male being a deep golden yellow : abso-
lutely hardy and perfectly peaceable. What better subject could
one want for an aviary bird ? And yet it is hardly ever imported
(though a common species in South and South-East Africa), and,
even if it were imported more frequently, it would probably only
fetch a few shillings. What a strange tiling it is to see our
members tumbling over one another in their eagerness to acquire
such useless birds as Parrot Finches and overlooking real merit!
I11 six years I have only been able to pick up four in-
dividuals--two males and two females--and one of the latter,
purchased from a member, was of so venerable an age that it
really did not count. (N.B.--I am always very pleased to get
hold of acclimatised birds, but I wish some of our members
would not "pass 011 " birds which really ought to be in receipt

on the Nesting of the Sulphury Seedeater.
of old age pensions). Not only is this species rarely imported,
but it does not seem to be as well known as it deserves to be
For instance, in Dr. Butler's excellent " Foreign Finches in Cap-
tivity" the female is described as "slightly duller than the cock,
with less-defined yellow streak on the face." Both the females that
I have seen have been dark grey with whitish throat and super-
ciliary streak and dull reddish-yellow rump. The male can sing
as well as a Cape Canary and both sexes have a curious call-note
which sounds to me exactly like the words "Pleased to see you."
I feel sure there can be no difficulty in breeding this
species, and yet, out of fifteen nests and no less than sixtv e^s
only two young were hatched. One of these, hatched in 1905,
grew to be a good size but disappeared in the usual mysterious
manner just before it was ready to leave the nest. Practically
every clutch has consisted of four eggs, and of these three have
usually been light bine with a few black spots on the larger end
and the remaining egg unspotted.
O11 the 8th July, 1909, I found one young one some days
old in the nest: it was thinly covered on the head and back with
whitish down. O11 the 13th it had quill feathers in the wings.
O11 the 15th its eyes were open: its beak was yellowish and
lighter in colour than the adults. On the 20th it left the nest
and was then a light buff-grey with bold, dark brown striations
011 the breast and smaller ditto on the back; there was some
yellow 011 the margins of the primaries, and it resembled its
mother in its light superciliary stripe and pale yellow rump. It
retained a little down on the head until the 25th. It was a fine
youngster, and naturally its mother was immensely proud of it,
being the only child of her old age, but, when she went to nest
igain, I regret to say that its father used to neglect it and even
drive it away from the food-tins. So on the 1st August I placed
it by itself in the next division of the aviary, and here it seemed
to get on well, but on the morning of the 7th [ picked it up dead
out well nourished. It certainly did seem hard that the first
young Sulphury I ever succeeded in rearing should have been so
quickly snatched away by the grudging hand of Fate.
I have always been careful to provide myself with actual
proof of nesting results--I think one owes this to oneself as well

Mr. Frank Finn,
as to the Society--so I sent the late lamented the same day to
Sliopland, the taxidermist, of Torquay, to be made into a skin.
The weather was sultry, and next day I got a post card from
Shopland to say he could not make a skin of it. I wrote by
return asking him to put it in spirits but when, by the following
post, I received only a small handful of feathers I am afraid--to
perpetrate a mild pun--that my remarks were also rather sul-
phury.
However, as I write (19 June, 1910), the old hen Sulphury
--o-etting a little bald but otherwise wearing her years lightly--
is sitting again, and perhaps I may this season be able to produce
something more tangible in the way of evidence. The old male
is as gallant and debonair as ever: he sits by the nest and
warbles to his better half and scoffs at Time.
I have not been able to ascertain whether this species has
been bred or not.
P.S.--I see that Stark and Sclater say that " the young
remain in the nest from three to four weeks." I wonder if this is
correct. The young bird mentioned above left the nest about
the 15th day and could feed itself by the 26th day.

(Concluded from fage 288.)
Masked Booby. Sula cyanops.
I saw specimens between Aden and Bombay in 1898.
Diving-Petrel. Peleca?ioides urinatrix.
Blandford rejects the claim of this species to figure in the
Indian list, but I saw, between Aden and Bombay, in the autumn
of 1897, a short-winged black and white sea-bird which could
hardly have been anything else. While on the subject of Petrels
I may say that I have seen plenty, and never noticed that they
ran along the water any more than Gulls do.
White Stork. Ciconia alba.
Storks are supposed to have no voice, but the young of this
species certainly utter a wheezing squeak ; so do young American
Jaberus ( Myderia americana).

Painted Stork. Pseudo tantalus leucocephalus .
I met a gentleman in India who told me that at a breed-
ing-haunt of this bird he got the local natives to climb the trees
and catch the old birds, then clipping off their pink wing-plumes
and letting them go. This is a good harmless way of getting
plumes, but birds would have to be very tame, even for India, to
stand it!
Cattle Egret. Bubulcus co?&apos;o?na?idjis.
This species eats cockroaches--the large Periplaneta ameri-
cana --readily, as many as fifteen at a meal, and does not always
cast pellets. But the specimen I observed cast a very perfect
one after receiving some small birds broken up and, some time
previously, cockroaches. The pellet contained some only of the
bones, some feathers, and hard parts of the insects. Yet I saw
no pellets after the Egret had received a Gecko lizard and several
cockroaches, all at one meal. The gecko was given alive, and
its tail came off on attack, as usual, but the bird did not let the
reptile escape, but seized it again, and only ate the still-wriggling
tail after the lizard was swallowed.
Common Flamingo. Phoenicoptems roseus.
These birds, not only swim well, but will turn "end up"
to feed in deep water, like ducks ; at any rate, two I kept on the
Museum pond did so. They also eat water-snails. With regard
to the affinities of the Flamingo, I may remark that there are
two points, independently of its anatomy, which ally it to the
Stork and Ibis group rather than the Ducks ; one is that the
young, although not helpless, are fed from the bill by the parents,
and the other is that the young fledge like Storks, the wings
being full-sized and well-quilled when there is still some down
on the body, as may be seen in the just-fledged specimen of this
species exhibited in the South Kensington Museum. I11 ducks,
as everyone knows, the wings long remain small, and feather
only when the bird is nearly full-grown and plumaged.
Grey-lag Goose. Anset ferns.
The common domestic goose of India has been supposed
to be a hybrid between the domestic race of this bird and that of
the Chinese Goose ( Cygnopsis eygnoides ), but I do not think this
is right, as domestic Indian geese never, so far as I know,

Mr. Frank Finn,
show any resemblance to the European tame geese ; they never,
for instance, show any of the characteristic grooving of the neck-
feathers conspicuous in the Grey-lag and its tame descendants
and even in the hybrids of these with the Chinese goose. The
gander of these Indian tame geese is quite as often pied as white,
unlike what obtains in European common tame geese.
Comb-Duck or Nukta. Scu-cidiornis melanonota.
There is a good deal of variation in the speckled head-
colour of the male in this species, some specimens having more
black than white, while in others the white predominates. A
male I got in immature plumage and sent to the Calcutta Zoo
moulted out into a fine bird with a very light head, but, curiously
enough, with the flanks nearly black, thus closely 7, resembling
the American Comb-duck (S. carunculata).
Whistling Teal. Dendrocygna javanica.
The eyes of this bird are not only proportionately but
absolutely larger than in its bigger Indian relative, the Large
Whistling-teal or Fulvous Duck (D.fiilvci). These "Whistlers"
dive as freely as Pochards, but with a spring like a Coot. The
small species is very quarrelsome ; I have seen several unite on
Rutledge's pond to attack Spotted-bills, and a Calcutta friend of
mine, a very 7, observant sportsman, used to say r that whenever he
heard that confounded whistling he know there would be no
decent ducks on that tank--he despised Whistlers as not being
fast enough on the wing for sporting shots !
Cotton Teal. Nettopus coroma?idelianus.
I have (. Avicultural Magazine , VII., p. 131) described the
courting gestures of the drake of this charming little species in
our pages previously, but I may add here that the gesture of
bending down the head is seen in both sexes when about to fight,
and apropos of Cotton Teal's fights it is noteworthy that though
females will attack males and each other as well, males will not
fight females, though they will attack young drakes in the female-
like immature plumage as well as their full-plumaged companions.
Mandarin Duck. sEx galericulata.
Although onlv once recorded in Indian limits as a wild
o J
bird (in Assam in 1902) this species is often imported alive from

I pair. I recently saw a female at the Zoo imitate her drake in
he gesture of dipping the bill in the water, and then putting
t behind the partly-opened wing, which looks so much like an
ittempt to draw attention to his fan.
Mallard. Anas boscas.
The common domestic duck of India is descended from
his species, and although the Muscovy (Cairina ?noschata&apos;) is
nore often kept than here, it is, I think, chiefly known as a
uiriosity. Hybrids between them are not uncommon, and have
leither the curls of the Mallard's tail, nor the bare face of the
)ther parent. The brown ones, which bear some resemblance
o the Mallard in coloration (they are often black and white and
iometimes grey and white), go into undress plumage like Mallard
md common tame drakes. Some of these hybrids I kept were,
niriously enough, more inclined to perch than the true Muscovy,
oosting at night regularly in a tree. I have seen some stand
vhen resting with the body erect like a Cormorant. The
'Indian runner" breed of tame duck, by the way, I never saw

Spotted-billed Duck. Anas pcecilorhyncha.
Rutledge told me he had twice known a female of this
pecies pair with a mallard-coloured tame drake. O11 the last
*ccasion I saw the birds. Male Spotted-bills were also present
nd ready to pair, and also two Mallards, but these were in-

eadily with Mallard. The female in captivity is very apt to get

is more conspicuous in the female in repose; but appears in the
male when showing off; his courting gestures are like those o:|
the Mallard, Pintail and Common Teal.
Baikal Teal or Clucking Teal. (. Net Hum formosuni).
I have before noted ( Avicultutal Magazine , N.S. V., p. 316&apos;jj
the variation in the colour of the feet, grey or olive, in this!
species ; this has nothing to do with sexes as the following note"|l
show. In 1901 there were a pair in the London Zoo, of which!
the male had grey and the female olive feet; two males kept fori]
sometime in the Calcutta Zoo both had olive feet. Of a consign-)
ment which were brought to Calcutta from abroad in 1902, some
had olive feet, but I did not note their sex ; and in a consignment!
now with Mr. Hamlyn, I note some olive-footed ones.
I have, however, only seen one specimen with the bill
olive, an Indian-caught female, I procured in Calcutta market in
the winter of 1898-99. In all others the bill has been grey, nor!
have I noticed anv variation in the eves.
Garganey. Querquedula circia.
Of six specimens of the pallid or cinnamon variety of this
duck I have seen, three were males and three females.
Pochard. Nyroca ferina.
Blau ford gives the irides of this duck as orange-yellow; I
have usually found them red in the male,very rarely yellow; brown
in the female, though I once saw a red-eyed female in St. James's
Park.
Eastern White-eyed Duck. Nyroca baeri.
When this bird was obtainable during its invasion of India
I placed some specimens on the Museum pond without pinioning
them. Phils a full-winged male arrived some time during the
winter of 1900-01 and stayed till May in the latter year, while a
full-winged Common White-eye (yV. africana ) left long before.
One full-winged bird even kept a pinioned pair company for
more than a year, never flying, so far as I saw, till in his second

A very delicate species in captivity. Their food (fish)
must be given them in water, cut up small, and the bones
removed. They must be shut up in cold weather and
would, I believe, do better with a moderate amount of
heat, though mine never had that luxury. It eventually
died of starvation, as it refused all food when moved from

Notes on the Age of Birds in Confinement.
water be limited it is almost impossible to breed ducks
unless each pair be kept separate, but the breeding pen
may be of extremely modest dimensions. This, of course,
does not apply where one drake is kept with several ducks,
but only when the sexes are approximately equal. In
these cases each duck will be worried in turn by all the
drakes, and, for a few weeks, will be given no peace or
rest until eventually she is killed. Although this is a
normal course in the case of Mammals, I have never
known or heard of similar cases in birds. In ducks, how-
ever, I have observed it every year. There is no doubt
that ducks choose their own drakes, and in this species at
least it seems more than likely that sexual selection plays
a considerable part. In most cases birds once paired will,
if opportunity occurs, mate again every year, although they
may have been separated during the winter. The drakes
remain with the duck until the young are hatched, after
which they retire to moult. The assumption of the eclipse
plumage of the drakes is, to a large extent, dependent on
the hatching of the young, and although all drakes assume
the eclipse plumage it usually shows itself much earlier
in the year in breeding birds than on those which are not
paired. Roughly speaking, under normal conditions, the
eclipse plumage will first show itself about five weeks after
the duck commences incubation. It is perhaps also worthy
of note that, if suitable shelters are made, laying can be
advanced by two or three weeks. In some of my pens
bushy laurels were grown as nesting cover, whereas in
others straw shelters were erected, and during the last
four years, without exception, eggs were always laid in the
straw shelters considerably before they were in the other
pens. These notes refer largely to my hybrid ducks. (See
also Avic. Mag., ist Ser., Vol. II., p. 160.)

six years ago, I have bred many young birds. They are as
hardy as domestic pigeons and adapt themselves to con-
finement quite as well. An attempt, however, to establish
them at liberty in a dove-cot failed. Six were liberated_
one pair remained and bred, and a single bird lived alone
at the opposite end of the garden. The young birds were
never seen after they were on the wing, and the parents
were caught in a dying condition early this spring, possibly
from having fed on poisoned grain. From the pair at liberty
I bred one chequered bird, the only one of many bred that

These birds are perfectly hardy, but the low average ol
life is due to losses from rats. In common with the other
species of pigeon they breed and rear freely in confine-
ment. I11 Turtle Doves the period of incubation is only
13-14 days, and the young are fully fledged a fortnight
after hatching. I11 the Rock Pigeon (C. livid) the periods

artificial heat during August if the weather be cold, is the
best means of bringing them through their moult. It
should be borne in mind that most Waders pass the winter
in the tropics and, in my opinion, the majority of adult
birds reach their winter quarters during September, and
do not leave them till April. Individuals met with in
England after the middle of September are almost entirely
birds of the year. In this species all the birds have left
their breeding quarters by the middle of August. The
spring moult is not so important, and many wild indi-
viduals do not assume it completely.

tremely hardy, requiring no shelter of any kind and feed-
ing well on any animal refuse, though mine were always
fed entirely on fish. I11 a suitable place they will breed
and rear their young without any extra attention, but they
are not quite such free breeders in captivity as is supposed.
If possible they should be kept in an enclosed aviary and
allowed the full use of their wings; they will live well
enough when pinioned, but if pinioned and unpinioned
birds be kept under the same conditions the difference
in favour of the full-winged birds is striking. No full-
winged gull of the larger kinds has ever died in my
possession.
Lesser Black-backed Gull (JLarus fuscus).
9 years 9 months, still living--at least 4 years older.
3 years, still living.
The same remarks apply as in the case of the fore^oino-
species. One Lesser Black-back amongst several Herrino&apos;
Gulls will probably be persecuted during the nesting
season. 1 his is the oldest bird that I know of in my
aviaries : it was in full nesting trim last year, when at least
thirteen years old.
Greater Black-backed Gull (Lams marinus).
6 years, still alive. Three individuals.
I liese hi ids were all hand-reared six years ago; one pair
is at present (May 1910) nesting in the Zoological Gardens.
In a comparatively small enclosure they are very quarrel-
some, both amongst themselves and with other species.
If kept with ducks or other waterfowl they will soon kill
them, and also become adepts in catching any sparrows or
rats that venture into their aviary.

I reared several of these birds from the nest one year,
but the last eventually died of enteritis. I believe this
was accelerated by its continually sitting on the damp
ground ; unless actually on the water they should do better
if kept quite dry.

These birds were also reared from the nest and died of a
peculiar kidney trouble, possibly through lack of salt.
They were strictly nocturnal, sitting in a dry corner of the
aviary all day and going to the water only at night.
ORNITHOLOGICAL RAMBLES.
By H. Goodchild, M.B.O.U.
(Concluded from Page 246.7
The Thursday had been hot, with an atmosphere and
clouds that suggested thunder, but Friday, August 6th, was
hotter, with a cloudless sky. I decided to spend the day in
going to the top of our highest mountain (Crossfell 2,930 feet).
Suitably dressed for exposure to a blazing sun, I sallied forth
with a full equipment of binocular, notebook, map, and compass
_the last in case the weather should change and mist come
down while I was on the tops--and carrying over my arm my
" protectively coloured " grey jacket (closely assimilating to the
weathered grey limestone and sandstone rocks) trudged cheer-
fully over the moorland, feeling far less oppressed, despite the
greater heat, than I had done 011 the previous day. O11 my wav.
I saw the Carrion Crow and Woodpigeon, and heard the Pipit
and the Skylark. From the top of the flat topped hill (where I
sat down to rest and observe) I heard and saw a Curlew. Know-
ing that this hill was in full view of a group of rocks high up 011
the top edge of the steep sided valley in front of me, I looked
carefully and saw, at a distance of about a mile, a solitary black
object on the grass above the rocks, apparently posted there lik#
a sentinel to keep a watchful eye over the wide panoramic view
it commanded. I had just noted the fact in my pocket book
when the bark of a Raven sounded in my ears. I immediate!}
began to search the skyline over the limestone crags where tin
Carrion Crows had been seen the previous day, but saw no Ravei
there, nor bird of any kind, when again the bark sounded. Tlii-j
time the bark came from the zenith. I lay back and looked intc

the cloudless sky, and there, right above me, but almost a speck
in the blue, was the Raven, sailing slowly round in circles, a
thousand feet or more over my head. With my prismatic
binocular I could see him well enough to make a silhouette of
him in my sketch book, and when he had sailed away I got up
to continue my journey along the trout stream. Cautiously and
quietly I walked towards the rocks (which I knew to be a
favourite resting place with the Ravens) stopping every hundred
yards or so to look at the black sentinel, which however, sat
steadily on, and never moved. When I got to within half-a-mile
or so I began to get suspicious, and when I arrived at a quarter-
of-a-mile my fears were confirmed--the sable sentinel.was nothing
else than the underside of a rock sticking up obliquely, but
which, in the blazing sun, showed a black patch against the grass,
about the size and shape of a Raven ! This was a distinct dis-
rippointment to me, as I had hoped to see how near a watchful
Raven would allow me to approach, in full view, before he took
wing. However, I resolved to compensate myself if I could by
gathering any feathers there might be about the rocks, and
climbed up towards them. Although I was here at an altitude
)f some 1,500 feet, I saw a Small Tortoise-shell Butterfly flitting
ibout in the sun, and the insect seemed inclined to accompany
ne on my climb, for it passed me two or three times. A Meadow
3rown Butterfly was also seen close by the stream before I left
t. Arrived at the rocks, I searched round them but only found
&gt;ne feather, a medium primary of the left wing, which I have no
ioubt from its size and colour, was from a Raven. No "casts"
lid I find, nor any other sign of birds, though on a previous
I&apos;Ccasion I had seen both and found more than a solitary feather
o tell the tale that it was a favourite look-out with them. The
-iew afforded was so fine that I sat and looked at it and rested
tiyself after my climb, as the hillside below was one of the
teepest in the district.
Leaving this favoured spot my line of advance took me
ver some beds of large weathered chunks of sandstone, in
egotiating which one had to be very careful as, although the
urface of them was rough and afforded a good grip for one's
oots, there was here and there a stone that might tip up and

cause a nasty fall or even a broken ankle. These beds of broken
sandstone rocks were a characteristic feature of the high grassy
moors--2,000 feet or more in altitude--that I was now on. A
Pipit attracted my attention on one of these beds, and then
another ; these two birds, it seemed to me, were more tawny
than even the Tree Pipit, and as I looked at them from only some
ten yards distance, I found there were others, and counted four-
teen in all. Careful comparison showed that there were Pipits
there of three distinct shades of colour: the darkest were nearly
as grey as the weathered sandstone rocks they were on ; the next
were appreciably browner, about Skylark colour, while two of
them were distinctly yellowish tawny and, according to my note
put down at the time, " reminded me of the female Yellow Bunt-
ing " in colour.
The best part of the afternoon was spent sketching on this
high mountain slope, and about half-past four I moved on to the
summit. Two Whinchats were seen amongst stone beds at the
base of the last rise at an altitude of about 2,800 feet, and two
Pipits, apparently Meadow Pipits, flitted round me as I sat at a
spring beyond the plateau of the top, enjoying what should have
been lunch, but which I partook of after five o'clock, with water
at 34 0 Fahr. instead of tea.
Returning by a different route, the head waters of the river
Tees were explored, and a Kestrel rose near by and went and
settled in sight some two hundred feet away. Selecting the easiest
gradient for the return journey, I was interested to find, on what
would have been a ridge if it had not been so rounded, several
feathers of the Red Grouse; and at 7.30 p.m., passing near one of
several tiny moorland pools or tarns, with no water flowing
into or out of them, I flushed the first Red Grouse I had seen
for certain--a solitary adult--at about two thousand feet, and
this bird flew off down into the nearest valley, complaining as
he went at being disturbed. Lower down on this tongue of
the mountain, at 7.45, as I was nearing the lowest group of peaty
tarns, the croak of a Raven, rapidly repeated, came over from
Gurt Deal--the deep valley lying between the spur I was on and
Crossfell--and I looked in vain along the skyline of Crossfell.
Again the sound came, this time from above the tongue where I

was, and then I saw two Ravens travelling southward. I got
the glass on to them and saw three in its field at once at a con-
siderable height. While descending the steep slope formed by
the lowest outcrop of limestone, the Ring Ouzel's alarm note
sounded sharply in the evening stillness, but at first the bird
could not be seen. It was seen soon after and flew towards the
big valley on my right--the only Ring Ouzel I had seen or heard
that day. My last ornithological item was of a Heron which rose
from the Trout stream I had passed up at mid-day, and when
this bird got well away I saw there were two Herons, which flew
down stream out of sight. Thus ended the observations of one
of the finest and most enjoyable days of my holiday.

Sandgrouse do not seem to excite the enthusiasm of most
aviculturists and, perhaps for this reason, are very difficult to
obtain from dealers.
The Pallas Sandgrouse, which periodically visits this
country, is perhaps more difficult than any to get hold of, and
although for some time past Mr. Hagenbeck has been trying to
get me some of these birds from Central Asia, yet, so far, they
have not arrived.
A request to Senor Saccone to get for me some Pteroclurus
byreniacus (which is, I am given to understand, one of the most
beautiful varieties of Sandgrouse) from Spain has elicited the
reply that they are very difficult to catch, and no birds have
arrived.
My hopes of obtaining the rare Tibetan Sandgrouse ran
aigh last year when a merchant travelling in that country
promised to get some. Alas! he only managed to get one or
:wo chicks and these he failed to keep alive. .Evidently he got
iold of the right birds, as they were said to have " no hind toes."
In another direction I have been much more fortunate. A
riend very kindly sent me over three Indian Painted Sandgrouse
Pterocles fasciatus ) caught near Bhopal in Central India. The
)irds (a cock and two hens) arrived in good health in the early

Mr. C. Barnby Smith,
part of last February. At the same time a consignment of the
Common Pintailed Sandgrouse ( P.exustus ) arrived. These birds
seem to travel well, as out of eighteen birds that left Calcutta
sixteen arrived alive.
Such of the Pintailed Sandgrouse as I retained for myself
I put at first with the Painted Sandgrouse in the conventional
sort of place--a large wooden shed (with sand floor) open on the
South, on which side it has a sort of glass verandah with grass
on the ground underneath.
The birds were, and are, fed on millet, canary, maw, rape,
and hemp seeds, but seem to like millet best of all. They are
also supplied with lime, small flint, grit and rock salt.
The Pintailed Sandgrouse do not seem to care for grass at
all but love to squat in the sand, basking in the sun whenever
possible. The greatest danger with these birds seems to be their
sudden panics, which makes them dash violently against the
sides of the enclosure unless the feathers of one wing are heavily
cut. My birds arrived late at night (as birds always seem to do)
and when I went to look at them the following morning the
whole lot were dashing with wild flights and shrieks of terror in
all directions. It was only prompt and resolute action with a
landing net and subsequently with a pair of scissors that put a
stop to their apparently determined efforts at suicide.
The Pin tailed Sandgrouse soon become comparatively
tame and run about on the sand with contented little ''crooning"
cries. I have noticed they are much steadier when divided as,
when a lot are together, the alarm note of one at once sets off
the others attempting to fly. So far I have seen no signs of nest-
ing, though I have divided them into several different enclosures
in hopes they will do so.
The habits of the Painted Sandgrouse were from the first
strikingly different from those of the Pintail. When the latter
were frightened their instinct was to fly, whereas the Painted
Sandgrouse crouched all together in a corner as though it was
their nature to seek cover ; although, as a fact, there was no
cover there.
I accordingly provided them with another enclosure very
similar to the first, except that nearly all the floor space was
covered with tussocks of grass, small box bushes, dwarf juniper,

<bodyText confidence="0.997839921052632" page_id="58072733"  page_num="315" year="" vol="">
etc., of course with sandy spaces at intervals. I found the birds
always loved to lie in the sun near a tussock of grass, and would
be seen to have moved their position several times a day so as to
get full sunshine. This surprised me, as they are said to be
crepuscular and nocturnal in habit. Their large staring black
eyes would quite give one this impression. Whatever they do by
night their habits by day are most unexpected, and they justify
their common name of " painted &quot; in an extraordinary manner,
for they might as well be merely painted birds as far as any
movement can be observed in progress. One might go to look
at them half a dozen times a day for weeks without seeing them
making any movement. The seed put down vanishes, and the
birds keep a good gloss on their feathers and appear to be in
excellent health. Very occasionally one may be seen moving,
but the same instant the bird will catch sight of you and draw in
its head and remain squatting motionless, however long you
remain to watch. If approached within about a couple of feet
however the bird will attempt to fly, with its wild alarm note of
*&apos; Yek--yek--vek." and land behind another tuft of grass. After
one attempt to fly, if again approached, it will permit itself to be
handled. It is said that bird-catchers in India take these Sand-
grouse by approaching them under cover of leaves and dropping
a net suspended at the end of a bamboo. Having seen the birds
themselves I can readily imagine the possibility of such a method
of capture.
To make up for their uninteresting habits, it must be
conceded however that the Indian Painted Sandgrouse have
most exquisitely marked plumage, the markings on the cock
especially being most striking. Even in rough grass they are
very difficult to see at a short distance, but our English grass is
oo green to hide them perfectly. I should imagine that in their
native haunts they will form a perfect example of obliterative
:oloration. I am told they frequent broken ground in ravines,
md that seldom more than three are found together.
Whether or not they will endure the severities of English
winters without artificial heat remains to be seen. I sincerely
lope they will and that I may be able to report as to nesting
&gt;perations next year.

J. D. HAMLYN'S PUBLISHED STATEMENT.
Sir,--A s J. D. Hamlyn has taken upon himself, without my fore
knowledge, to publish a printed statement with regard to my purchasing
some Queen Alexandra Parrakeets from him, I shall be most grateful to you
if you could find space for the following facts.
On the 19th March, 1910, I received the following (written by Mrs.
Hamlyn, who I should like to say has always shown me courtesy):
"Sir, --111 reply to your favour re Queen Alexandras, Mr. Foglia has
" written Mr. Hamlyn asking him to meet him on arrival, and take charge
" of the stock.
" You can reckon on having the two pairs of birds for ^40, provided
"you will send us a cheque for above sum. . . . It is of course quite
"understood that the birds are to be free from blemish .II
"they do not arrive, your cheque is returned same day steamer docks.
" . . . You need have no fear whatever but what I shall act honestly."
O11 the 23rd of March, I received the following from J. D. Hamlyn:
"Sir, --My wife is away. . . . The cheque for ^40 arrived, for
" which accept our united thanks. This will enable us to plunge oil
" Foglia's consignment, with, I trust some benefit to ourselves." . .
When I was in Italy some weeks later, I received a letter to say that
only three birds had arrived (I was promised two true pairs) but that if I
kept them, Hamlyn must keep the ^40 I had already paid for four! or lie
would accept other offers. N.B. Offers for goods which were 110 one's
property but mine! I naturally remonstrated, but as I was not in England,
and very much wanted the birds, I gave in.
O11 my return, not long after, I found one of the three birds minus
tail and flight feathers, (it had arrived in that condition) and looking very

11 . In spite of having been kept in a conservatory and well cared for, it
0011 died. When I wrote to announce the fact I received no answer at all !&apos;
I think that most members of the Society will be struck with these
&gt;oints:
(i) Why I should have had to pay ^40 for three birds, when I held a
written agreement promising me two true pairs " free from blemish"
for that sum.
ii) That the birds were most certainly mine, and that there was no ques-
tion about larger offers afterwards.
iii) That as J. D. Hanilvn took over the other stock at the same time from
the importer of the parrakeets, the sum of ^5 seems a very ex-
orbitant one for him to have paid for the expenses connected only
with three birds of that size between London and Plymouth ! ! !
v) That, in any case, he gained a clear ^5 on the transaction.
I might add, that after this, one would have thought that anyone
f ho had failed in supplying me with the full number of birds which I had
aid for, and paid for generously, would be glad to think that I had had an
pportunitv later 011 of, in a way, making up the loss by securing some
lore Queen Alexandra Parrakeets, for which I paid #7 a pair ( ! ! ); instead
f which this dealer in birds was extremelv annoved at my doing so,
lthough it was no business of his whatever.
A short time ago another English dealer sent me a pair of birds as a
ebt. The female was dead in the box, the body (a mere skeleton) smelt
) high that it had to be hastily cremated, and the eves were completely
ink in, yet the birds had only been a few hours 011 the journey and were
let at the station on arrival !
O11 my remonstrating, I received a post-card :
"Sir, --Well I don't see any good or (sic) continuing this affair, you
may think as you choose I shall do the same [here follows a word which
is supposed to be 'insinuations'!] "as not facts."
I was offered two single birds which I didn't in the least want, as a
mipromise.
It is really time that an Association should be formed for obtaining
irds from foreign lands by some other means. Mr. Goodfellow has shown
3 that birds can be landed looking as if they had only just been caught,
it they are often received so full of deadly disease owing to the filthy state
: the cages they have been in, that one marvels why one ever runs
iy more risks. Hubert D. Asteey.
[Mr. Hanilyn's letter, referred to above, was printed on the last page

lport rare birds privately, might possibly, if a feasible scheme could be

Rupicola crocea.
By W. Frost.
The new year of 1910 found me in Georgetown, Demarara,
:.G., enquiring for Cocks of the Rock. The general opinion
\0x25A1long the colonists, however, appeared to be, that I might ask
until the cows came home," and then I might not get them.
Evidently there was nothing for it, but to hunt them up myself.
I reckoned that by following up the old route, used by the
avannah tribes, who used occasionally to bring the birds down
j ,r sale, in the old sugar days of the Colony, I should stand a
:&gt;od chance of locating the district from whence they obtained
leirs. This meant taking the Mazuruni River as far as the
uripoung, then over the trail, leading across the Merume range
kith towards Roraima. The Northern slopes of the Merume
oved to be the place.
Travelling up Guiana river is about the stiffest kind of
oving job I have ever struck. It is apt to remind one of the
ol's advice to " take a cab and walk " ; only there, one hire's a
*at and carries it (most of the way anyhow).
Towards the end of the month we reached Sevanamo, and
ere engaged a crew of Ackawai Indians. According to them,
!owenaros,' i.e. Cocks of the Rock, were never seen North of
e Mazuruni, but there were still a fair number between that
7 er and the Blue Mountains, (i.e. Merume), so, acting on their
vice, I started up the Aping and Perinoung creeks. There are
tails here, but the stream runs like a millrace. Paddles were
eless, the boys having to haul the canoes along by the over-

banging branches, and lianes, " Monkey jumping," as they term
it; every other pull bringing down showers of venomous ants
with an odd centipede or so as a treat. Two days of this, witl
another two through the bush, brought us to an Indian camp
within ten or twelve miles of the range. Here we were held up
for about a fortnight, awaiting a chance to cross the floodec
valleys, laying close in under the hills.
During this wait, I visited some twenty or thirty ' dancing
places, made and used by the birds during the last two months
In every case, I found it to be a small, level, bare-swept space o
from two-and-a-half to three feet across, invariably under the
feeding trees and, in most cases, within a short distance o
running water. I saw no birds, however, and, according to the
Indians, they had all shifted to the higher grounds to breed.

On February iotli a strange Indian (Macusi) came int(
camp from across the range, and reported passing a nest con
taining eggs. Four days later we got across, and the day after j
hunted up the nest. It was stuck to the face of a large over
hanging boulder, fourteen feet up, on a small, sharply sloping
ledge. The hen sat very close, whilst being watched from below
only shifting at the approach of a pole, which we propped agains
the boulder to use as a ladder. On close inspection the lies
appeared to be built of fibrous material, probably from a palm
worked up with some gelatinous substance, and plastered on tin

outside with dried lichen or moss ; in shape, forming about two
thirds of a circle. It contained two eggs, roughly about the size
of a pigeon's, dirty white, with large, rusty coloured blotches at
the larger end. These hatched March 5th and 7th respectively.
Three days later, owing to the carelessness of the boy 011 guard,
a 1 iger cat cleared the lot. Marks of old nests of previous
seasons were very numerous on the boulders scattered along the
slopes.
Perhaps I had better explain that these boulders vary in
size from that of a small cottage to, say, that of the Albert Hall.
The whole formation of the range indeed reminds one of nothin(R)-
so much as a gigantic stone wall, from which the top courses
have been dislodged, forming a heap of debris all along the foot,
over and under and through which one has to struggle like a
stray ant, until one comes to the wall itself, running up sheer
some hundreds of feet. Over all is the thick, dark, tangle of
hush, the sort of trail that even the Indians shirk, although
swarming with game.
Near the top of the slope, close up under the wall, we
found more ' dancing' places; here, however, they were neces-
sarily 011 a stiff incline. I found the birds danced fairly regularly
every morning between eight and ten a.m. The Indians say they
tiever dance later in the day, but I have caught birds as late as
*ur p.111. on the grounds, though I ought to add they did not
?et a chance to start a game.
During the time I remained on the range, I watched per-
laps some thirty to forty dances. They were always started by
in old cock who, taking up a position on a horizontal or slightly
doping branch, a fallen one preferably, at a height of from three
o four feet, would start squawking out a challenge to his com-
panions feeding overhead. Presently he would start jumping
pack and forth from his perch to the ground, giving a quick swirl
with open wings and tail, as he struck the ground and turned to
egain the branch. One after another the other cocks would drop
lown and sit around watching. Then one or another would join
n, sitting opposite the first and taking turn in the jumps,
squawking the usual challenge. The excitement spreading, the
est would gradually fall into place, until with seven or eight

Mr. W. Frost,
birds flashing up and down, faster and faster, it began to look
something like a dance. I cannot say that I ever saw a hen
anywhere near during a dance, though, of course, they may have
been watching the game from overhead in the thick foliage. All
the dark birds I ever caught on the dance grounds turned out to
be immature males.
Although the birds sometimes stick to one dance spot tor
weeks, yet, if disturbed too much, they quickly start another.
One morning the birds seemed a bit late in turning up, but about
8.30 I heard the usual row going 011 a little higher up the slope.
On creeping round I found they had started another ring;
probably they had begun to take notice of the unaccountable
number of " accidents " at the old show. I noticed here that the
fresh spot, after only a few minutes use, could hardly be distin-
guished from one that had been in use for perhaps a couple of
weeks, so that the usual idea of a dancing place as being trodden
down hard and smooth by continual use won't hold. The ground
is actually swept bare of leaves, twigs, and the top soil, scratched
up by their strong claws in getting a throw off, and by the
vigorous flirt of the wings and tail, as the birds strike and turn,
until the layer of hard-packed white sand beneath is exposed.
The Indians have two methods of capturing Cocks of the
Rocks alive: one by shooting, with blowpipe and poisoned
arrows, afterwards administering an antidote, which, in the
majority of cases, fails to work; the other by trapping with fine
string noose and spring,--this method is very apt to bieak or
dislocate the limbs, however. I barred them both and stuck to
my nets ; these proved a source of unfailing interest to the
Bucks. To see me scoop up seventeen Trumpeters out of a
small flock of two or three dozen fairly flabbergasted them. The
old chief once asked to be allowed to try one on his own. dhis
I did not care to risk, but I fixed him a large net one morning
for a Maamo (Tinamou) that was feeding near, and giving him
full instructions how to use it and how to flush the bird at the
proper time, I left him to it and took up a position about tliiity
yards off.
For about lialf-an-hour old Harry sat there, whistling the
Maamo call fit to blow his teeth out, and staring till his eyes

Watered, in a vain attempt to keep the net plainly in view.
Suddenly the bird answered, and immediately after showed
tself about the middle of the net, blit on the far side. The old
nan, however, had long ago lost its exact position and, sighting
lie bird, made a desperate rush. His wild yell of astonishment
uid rage when he struck and found he had only caught himself
md lost his dinner was jolly funny. Afterwards he told me I
vas welcome to my spider traps, for his part he&apos;d hunt his meat
ike a sportsman.
When caught, Cocks of the Rock are by no means certain
ivers, for the first forty-eight hours at any rate. Some will sulk,
md in that case nothing one can do or offer will tempt, him to
ive in captivity. Others again will feed readily 011 berries and
Iiopped banana as soon as caged. One old bird, indeed, that I
lad just taken from the net, and was holding in a small open-
vork basket in one hand, while resetting the net with the other,
ctually took the end of a cigarette from between my fingers, but
aiding that unpalatable, started to finish up the food a previous
ulky occupant had left.
Insectivorous mixture I found they despised ; live meal-
worms and other insects they were, on the whole, very indifferent
j. Any and every berry procurable, ripe or unripe, they were
lways eager for, and next to berries, preferred paw paw, mangoes,
ananas, or boiled pumpkin. Some even grew to be very fond
f boiled rice sweetened with condensed milk, more especially if
oloured by the addition of a little dark jam such as Blackberry
r Blackcurrant. I found them always very keen 011 a bath, the
;ght of a syringe would set them all shuffling madly in their
agerness for a "cooler."
Although they travel about and feed in small flocks of one
) two dozen birds, apparently quite amicably, even in breeding
me, yet I found them all terribly vicious toward each other
hen caged. Even the youngsters in brown plumage always had
daily rough and tumble over the food tins, so that at last I was
oliged to cage each bird separately,--a great drawback in a
mntry where carriers are scarce and roads or paths non-existent.
From what I saw of the Cocks of the Rock, I do not think
ley are any scarcer now, or yet likely to be, than they ever were

in British Guiana. There is no trade in the skins now. Bucks
rarely use them for their dancing costumes, generally preferring
those of the various Toucans, with long strings of Yellow-winged
Sugar Bird skins. Neither is there any certain sale for living
specimens in Georgetown or Bartica, the birds rarely surviving
more than a few weeks, owing partly to the change of tempera-
ture, but more I suspect to their owners' ignorance of their
habits and requirements.
I heard of their being seen on most of the Sandstone
ranges of the Interior, so that one can hardly call Rupicola crocea
a scarce species, rather, one might term it inaccessible. The
B. G. interior has well earned the title of the white man's grave,
moreover, to my knowledge one is apt to bundle into it mighty
unceremoniously.
I might mention that Mr. Goodchild has given, in the
accompanying plate, an exact picture of the bird, as I first caught
sight of it, though, from his alert attitude, I take it he had been
long aware of my presence.

Some of our members are interested in this species; I
will, therefore, say a few words more about the pair which I
brought under notice in August and September of last year.
A change has come over the female since I last wrote.
Instead of being a second-rate bird, this winter and spring
she has been a magnificent specimen, trim and tight, a superb
creature full of life and energy. One curious result of this
improvement in her condition has been that she would not
allow the male to approach the nest nor to feed the young, not
even after they had left the nest:--from first to last she took sole
and entire charge of them, and from first to last, whenever she
had a moment to spare, she spent that moment in chasing her

nate. Did she remember how that, last year, he drove her from
ler children and displaced her in their affections, attempted to
liurder her, and, later, slaughtered one of the young birds, and
vould have slaughtered the other had it not found a friendly
asylum at the Zoo.!
This year I did not permit the Rock-Thrushes to have
)OSsession of the reserved aviary, but kept them in the general
iviary close to the house. I was enabled consequently to watch
hem better; and the fledgelings, being brought up in the open,
became accustomed to our presence and delightfully tame.
Moreover, they were saved from the deleterious effects of the
*reat damp occasioned by the heavy rains ; this summer, as last,
lie reserved aviary with its luxuriant foliage has not been the
dace for such a species as the Pied Rock-Thrush.
This spring the female, expecting daily to be loosed into
he aviary in which she bred last year, was a long time settling
lown to business ; moreover, she was much perturbed by the
iresence of workmen about the house. Three several nests she
milt; in the first she laid one egg ; there was not anything in
he second ; in the third, which was absolutely and completely
\0x25BAut of sight, she laid three eggs and thus made up the clutch of

During the whole of the first day of the building of each
lest, and on the first day only, she carried up mud, wet dirt, and
nuddy rubbish. I think this is new:--lam under the impression
--perhaps wrongly--that it is supposed that this species does not
ise mud in the construction of its nest. After the young had
lown, I found a good deal of dried mud in the bottom of the
\0x25BAox which had contained the nest, mostly in the form of balls;
&gt;ut everything had become so dry, and I had such difficulty in
getting at the place, that I cannot say more than that the mud
ieemed to have been used for the purpose of filling up the
:orners of the box in order to make the bottom more saucer-
haped. The first nest was much the same ; the second is
&gt;ccupied by other birds and has not been examined.
The female commenced to sit on June i ; and the young
:ommenced to hatch out on the morning of the 15th.
Early on the 29th, a dead nestling was carried from the

nest by the mother. For its age, it was a perfect specimen ; it
seems to have been killed by a poisoned insect--one of the many
dangers to our birds to which we poor Londoners are liable. All
during the morning the mother was frantic, and dashed about the
place like some mad creature. I picked up a female Beautiful
Grassfinch ( P . mirabilis ), which presumably had chanced to get
in her way; it had received one dagger-like stab--one was
enough--in the lower neck : no bill in the aviary but that of
the frensied Thrush could have inflicted such a wound. I could
not blame her, though I grieved sorely for the poor inoffensive
victim. She did not steady down and resume the regular feeding
of the survivors until quite midday.
On the evening of the same day, the 29th, the two sur-
vivors left the nest together. Last year the young remained in
the nest some two or three days longer, probably because they
had plenty of elbow-room ; this year the nest was in a small box
wherein only two nestlings may have been somewhat crowded;
moreover the position was not nearly so satisfactory as that of
last year.
For some days the fledgelings hid about in holes and
crannies on or near the ground, and often were difficult to find;
and, even now, the peculiar unassertive mottled light-gray aspect
of the general plumage, notwithstanding the darker wings and
dull-rufous latter end, harmonises so well with their surround-
ings--whether bricks or mortar, wood or ground--as to render
them inconspicuous even when not in hiding and quite invisible
to the casual passer-by. For the first few days, if not hidden
away when any one approached (and they could see no reason
why they should hide from me), the mother would dash at and
peck them, and endeavour to force them into some nook or
corner. When not flying about, they still instinctively retreat
into shady places, almost invariably near to the ground. Towards
nightfall, however, they mount to the highest perches, and for a
while persisted in going to roost in the open where they were
fully exposed to the rain ; and from time to time I had to come
to their rescue and stow them away under shelter until the
morning. They like to pass the night in some particular spot,
so I have got over this trouble by putting a cover above each

Favoured sleeping-place. They never roost near to one another
nor to their parents; but the mother always waits in attendance
jpon them until they have finally settled down.
The fledgelings did not hurry themselves o'ermuch in
earning to obtain their own food, and seemed disposed to take
idlings easily ; but the old mother is not one to put up with any
duckoo nonsense. Commencing early on July 9, and from that
day onwards, she ceased to carry food to them but has required
hein to follow her about to the several food-dishes. She seemed
:o put them through a regular course of training in the art of
providing for themselves; and certainly they have done credit to
ler teaching.
I referred, last year, to the tameness of this female. When
n want of food for her young, not only did she follow me every-
vhere, watching my every movement, in the hopes that I should
ind an insect, but she dashed about me, pecked my hands, beat
ne with her wings, dodged about between my feet, so that I had
o exercise the greatest care lest I should injure her. She like-
vise followed and inspected the movements of the bird-woman,
vitli a like purpose. She reminded me of a Magpie I once had,
vho used to accompany me when gardening, and who, terrier-
ike, was ready to dart upon any unlucky earwig, centipide, or
&gt;ther creature that I might start--even a Magpie is not all ' black'
ou see!
Last September (pp. 312, 3) I hinted that this female had
&apos;Ccasionally been wanting in amiability in her intercourse with
ittle birds. Very shortly afterwards I found that, like Mr.
deade-Waldo's Rock-Thrush (VI., 189), she also is keen after
mall mice, catching and killing them eagerly and boldly. Now
t so chanced that one evening, soon after the youngsters had
eft the nest, as I was carrying them into the birdroom out of the
ain, I brushed against a little branch upon which, cuddling
ogether in a row, were sleeping four baby Blue-breasted Wax-
Ills, and upset them all, one of them fluttering under a 'house'
vliich is raised about a foot above the floor. Whether the
&apos;hrush thought it was a mouse or one of her own little ones I do
ot know, probably the former, for she immediately flew to the
pot with a look of expectancy on her face which meant mischief;

Mr. R. B. Woosnam,
and I endeavoured to drive her away with my handkerchief. She
turned upon me and, at the third flip, bounded on to the food-
table close by, with wings outspread and every feather bristling,
and in a hurricane of fury dared me to mortal combat. I have
never before seen a bird in such a towering rage.
Both of the parents fell into moult, as usual, at the begin-
ning of July, no suggestion being offered towards the rearing of
a second brood ; but the mother still keeps a watchful superin-
tendence over the young, and carries to them every tit-bit she
can obtain.

Scops erlangeri .
By R. B. Woosnam.
I caught this little Owl in rather a curious way. Late
one evening on the banks of the Tamalakan river (Ngamiland),
I saw two small Owls sitting together in a big kameel thorn tree.
I could see they were Erlanger's Scops, and as I wanted specimens
of this Owl for the collection, I stalked them and bagged both
with a single shot. When I went to pick them up I found they
were quite young birds with still a few traces of down showing.
One was quite dead but the other was very much alive and on
examination proved to have no bones broken and only three
slight wounds from dust shot so I decided to try and keep it alive.
I had a small wicker cage made for it and, although it was most
ferocious at first, it soon got to know my whistle and later even
my voice, and I never had the least trouble about feeding it, and
it would come and take its bird or mouse out of my hand. I
always made it pluck and tear up its food for itself as in this way
it got a considerable amount of valuable exercise and afforded
us much amusement. It always began bv swallowing the bird's
head whole, and the remainder in lumps, feathers and all, except
the wing and tail feathers, standing on the bird and tearing it to
pieces with the most evil look on its face. It had the most
extraordinary range of facial expressions I have ever seen, some
fierce, others so ridiculous that no one could resist laughing.
When let loose in a room it would quietly look round till it

nade out the highest possible perch it could get, and nothing
would satisfy it till it got there, then from this point it would
examine carefully everything in the room, bowing up and down
md turning its head around without moving its body in the most
ncredible way. Nothing escaped its keen eyes, even a tiny
^lack ant moving on the wail at the other side of the room would
attract its attention. If a cat or dog came into the room and it
was well out of reach, it would glare at them and swear
occasionally in a low voice, but if it was perched low down, say
on a chair, it would puff itself up to three times its normal size,
ower its head and spread out its wings like a fan, swear and
map its beak and dilate its glorious eyes till they seemed ready
:o burst out of its head, if it was put on the floor then, it would
actually attack a cat, striking at it with its claws like a Game
eock. I often used to take it out of its cage in the day time and
out it out to sit in a tree (it had of course the primaries of one
wing cut) and it was wonderful to see how it would try to make
tself inconspicuous especially when any animal passed near it.
[t used then to stand bolt upright and make itself so small and
:hin that it looked scarcely thicker than a candle, at the same
:ime closing its eyes till only the narrowest slits were visible and
raising its horns straight up over its head like two thin spikes,
[t always assumed this attitude if I went to speak to it when it
was in a tree, and bobbed up and down, tittering and chattering
it me (a sign of friendship) and screwing up its face with one
eye half open in the most ludicrous manner possible. Curiously
enough it always behaved in this way if any birds came to mob
t, and never became angry.
It is impossible to describe all its amusing little ways and
loings, it was one of the most interesting and charming pets I
lave ever had. It travelled with us in the waggon many
lundreds of miles, and once when crossing a river, which was
inexpectedly deep for a short distance, it was completely
submerged for about a minute and I shall never forget its
expression when it came out.
I always fed it once a day, in the evening, when it had
either a freshly killed bird or a mouse, of which it eat as much
is it wanted, it would eat a bird the size of a Sparrow every

night. It was very particular about its meals and if there was
any noise or movement going on near it, would not touch its
bird nor eat anything.
It generally eat its food at once, but sometimes it would
keep it all night and eat it just at dawn. Besides small birds
and mammals, they feed upon large insects such as beetles,
moths and big grasshoppers, these latter it often caught for
itself when I let it out in a tree. I believe that the formation
and casting of pellets is absolutely essential to these small Owls,
if not to all Owls, if they are to remain in perfect health, and if
they are fed upon butchers' meat it is only a matter of a short
time before they die. I took some traps on board ship and man-
aged to catch rats for them fairly often. A days' complete fast
now and then is most beneficial to all carnivorous animals in
confinement.
I brought home, also, two S. African Barn Owls (Strix
flammed) but I failed absolutely to tame them in the slightest,
and, although I had them in down, they became more morose
and savage every day.
Erlanger Scops Owl frequents the forested parts of S.
Africa, I believe only in the neighbourhood of water. I have
never been able to identify its note for certain, but I believe it is
a rather loud single whistle or hoot with a trill in it. It is
plentiful on the Molopo river, in the Kameel thorn forest and
in Ngamiland along the numerous branches of the Okovango,
but we did not see it or hear what I think to be its note in the
waterless parts of the Kalahari desert. There seem always to
be a pair of these Owls together, and they are only partially
nocturnal.

WE SAIL FOR HOME.
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.995909757575758" page_id="58072757"  page_num="331" year="" vol="">
On April the nth, 1908, we set sail from Sydney, 011 our
ught weeks voyage for home with a large stock of animals, in
he good ship "Persic," of the White Star Line.
Besides the New South Wales animals, we had a large
lumber from Queensland, which Mr. Beard of Brisbane had got
ogether for me. The beautiful Parry's or Pretty-face Wallaby,
iow only found in Queensland, and always rare in collections,
vas represented by five specimens, and the most delightful,
hough highly unsatisfactory Koala or native Bear was represented
&gt;y two specimens. These latter were the tamest little creatures
maginable, and before we sailed, each morning came for a walk
ound the Sydney Zoo on my shoulders. They would make
deal "Teddy" Bears if only they were easy to keep.
We had Wallabies and Kangaroos of many species;
Dasyures, or Native Cats of two species, Wombats, Marsupial
vlice, Rat-Kangaroos, Opossoms, Dingoes, Snakes and Lizards
o the number of over a hundred, and some thirteen or fourteen
pecimens of the Echidna, the curious egg-laying porcupine,
vliose nearest relation in Australia is the Platypus.
Of birds we had a large number. Cages full of Honey-
aters of several species, Magpie Larks, Coacli-whip birds, Biue-
ATe 11s, Aellow-breasted and Dusky Robins, Black-and-white
pantails, several species of Parrakeets, Wedge-Tailed Eagles,
1 Funereal and a Banksian Cockatoo, Rajah Sheldrakes, Herons,
bises, Cranes, Pelicans, etc.
There were two large sheds on the fore deck of the ship,
vhich, 011 the outward voyage, are generally used for cattle and
lorses. These I appropriated, and had a third and larger one
pecially constructed, and in these we housed most of our stock,
vdiile the larger animals stood out on- deck in their boxes.
Two days after sailing we leached Melbourne, where we
lad three or four days to wait. Here Mr. D. Le Souef had
mother large stock of animals awaiting me. I took also a

quantity of Honey-eaters and other small birds which Miss
Bowie and Mr. Newell had kindly got for me. Shelley, a keeper
from the London Zoo, had been in charge of the stock at Sydney,
and here at Melbourne we picked up Vinall, who had also come
out from home, and to whom I had entrusted the special care of
the Victorian stock as it accumulated in the Melbourne Zoo.
Hobart.
During the apple season in Tasmania, all the large steamers
leaving Australia for Europe call at Hobart for a cargo of apples ;
and as I hoped, through the kindness of my friend Mrs. Roberts,
to secure a nice collection of Tasmanian animals, this fact was
very fortunate for me.
When I awoke early in the morning of April the 18th, we
were already anchored about lialf-a-mile from shore in the still
waters of Hobart Harbour. It was a perfect autumn morning,
the atmosphere crisp and bright, and from my porthole I viewed
an exquisite picture of the pretty town nestling at the foot of
snow-capped Mount Wellington. The fine old Orient ship
"Omrah" lay at the quay, in the berth that our ship was to
occupy when her rival should have taken her fill of the luscious
cargo of fruit which Hobart, at this season, distributes to the
World ; so our ship had to wait her pleasure. A steam launch
soon came out to us and conveyed 11s to the shore, and I pro-
ceeded to " Beaumaris" to see Mrs. Roberts' interesting collection
of Tasmanian birds and beasts.
Mr. and Mrs. Roberts received me very kindly, and I was
at once taken to see the collection.
A number of Bennet's Wallabies occupied a large en-
closure, and followed their owner about as tame as domestic
rabbits. Some fine black Tasmanian Opossoms or Phalangers
and a number of Flying Phalangers were amongst Mrs. Roberts
pets. The birds, however, interested me most.
One large aviary was devoted to Parrakeets, and here one
saw the Tasmanian Yellow-vented Parrakeet (Platycercus flaviveii-
U is), Rosellas, Yellow-rumps, Pennants, Red rumps and Cocka-
tiels, and amongst them a New Zealand Kea Parrot, which
appeared to agree quite well with its smaller companions.
In a small aviary I was delighted to see a number of Fire-

:ailed Finches ( Zo?i&amp;lt;zgi?ithus bellus ) looking in the pink of con-
dition, but doubly pleased was I when Mrs. Roberts most kindly
presented me with eight of them. These little finches are
common around Hobart, but appear to be very delicate when
first caught. When once acclimatized, however, they are com-
paratively hardy, and of the eight examples given to me by Mrs.
Roberts, one only died on the voyage home.
A very fine White-bellied Sea Eagle occupied an aviary
with a Wedge-tailed Eagle, a beautiful White Goshawk, a Gould's
Harrier and an Allied Harrier. Of waterfowl, I saw in Mrs.
Roberts' garden for the first time the beautiful Chestnut-breasted
Teal (. Net Hum casta?ieum) i locally known as the King Teal,
Cereopsis and Madned Geese or Wood Ducks as they are called
there. There were Black-backed Porphyrios, and a single
''Native Hen," or Mortier's Water-hen ( Tribo?iyx mortieri ) to
give it its correct designation.
Mrs. Roberts most kindly allowed me to purchase, at a
very reasonable figure, the largest part of her collection, and
before we left Hobart my stock on the " Persic" was augmented
by a nice lot of Tasmanian animals, which I need hardly say
I should have been quite unable to obtain had it not been for
Mrs. Roberts most kind help.
At "Beaumaris" I was fortunate in meeting Miss Fletcher,
a keen naturalist, (whose contributions to the Emu on Tasmanian
ornithology are well known and appreciated by Australian orni-
thologists), and her sister; Mr. and Mrs. A. L. Butler, the former
an excellent ornithologist, and Mr. Robert Hall, the Curator of
ithe Hobart Museum, and one of the foremost of Australian
naturalists. The meeting was very pleasant and I learnt much
Tasmanian natural history.
Although I had secured from the Melbourne Zoo a pair of
that extraordinary carnivorous marsupial, the Tasmanian Devil,
I was very anxious to obtain other specimens. Mrs. Roberts had
been doing her best to secure some for me, but on my arrival at
Hobart no word of any had come to hand. I had nearly given
up hope when a telegram arrived stating "three Devils sent on
by rail." This was on Saturday night and Monday was Easter
Bank Holiday.

334 Bird Notes from the Zoological Gardens.
No news of the animals came to hand on the Sunday, but
on Monday (Bank Holiday) morning Mr. Butler telephoned to
the Station-master--"Have you got any Devils at your station?"
"I don't know about Devils," replied the official, "but we have
some very ugly looking animals in a box." We promptly
chartered a conveyance and proceeded to the railway station.
We searched high and low amongst cases containing every
variety of merchandise, but no sign did we find of the Devils.
Being Bank Holiday everybody connected with the station
-appeared to have gone holiday-making. At length we discovered
a sleepy-looking porter who said he believed that the carrier,
whose duty it was to deliver them, had taken them to his own
house, until he should have finished his holiday-making and feel
disposed to deliver them. We proceeded to the carrier's house,
which was securely locked up for the day. The back yard con-
tained some half-dozen dogs and a shed which looked as though
it might contain our quarry. The dogs seemed to welcome our
intrusion over the top of a six-foot fence, and did not in the
least object to our forcing the door of the shed. Here we found
two suspicious-looking boxes, through the crevices of the board-
ing of which we beheld the ugly faces of our prizes. They were
promptly transferred to our conveyance, and we drove back well
satisfied.

The season now rapidly drawing to a close has been a
fairly good one on the whole for breeding; though, of course,
many things have not bred that should have done so.
Early in the year I had the incubators put into order in
view of Pheasant rearing ; our breeding stock was distinctly poor,
but I thought it advisable to rear what one could from the
available stock.
I foresaw a difficulty in securing trusty broody hens for
rearing the chicks at the right time, so determined to have a

earing in this. I was told that these machines were excellent
or chicken rearing, but that for pheasants they would be a
ailure. However, we have reared about ninety pheasants with
*omplete success; the species reared being Mongolians, Gold,
Silver, Amherst, Peacock (. Polyplectrori ), Elliot's, Prince of Wales'
Caleege, and a Tragopan, as well as a Globose Currasou and a
lybrid Peafowl ( Pavo nigripennis X P * muiicus).
Waterfowl have done fairly well. Of Sheldiakes we have
)red three species : the Variegated or Paradise Duck, six hatched
md reared; Ruddy, nine hatched and reared; Common, two
latched and one reared. Of Wigeon we have reared six, Shovel-
ers four, Chestnut-breasted Teal, five ; Australian Wild Duck,
&apos;our ; hybrid Yellow-billed and Dusky Ducks, ten ; hybrid Yellow-
fill and Meller's Duck, six, and one young Snow Goose. Then
here are three young Andaman Teal, two young Maned Geese,
seven young Tufted Ducks and seven young Muscovies--all
loing well.
A pair of Black-tailed Waterhens (. Nicrotribonyx ventralis)
lave three chicks about six weeks old, and a pair of Wattled
Peewits have hatched three young, which are doing very well.
[ do not know of a previous case of these latter being bred in
captivity. A Bantam hen has charge of a rapidly-growing cluck
)f the Black-backed Australian Porphyrio. We are rather proud
)f having reared a young Hammerhead or Tufted Umbre ( Scopus
\imbretta ). The enormous nest was built last year, but then no
-ggs were laid to our knowledge. This year they took to the
nest again, and on the first of August a young bird, differing
anly from its parents in possessing a pale yellow iris in contrast
to the dark brown iris of the adults, left the nest and at once fed
itself and was forthwith ignored by its parents, who are paying
great attention to the nest again.
In the Seagulls' aviary not much has happened. A pair
of White Storks made a nest, laid four eggs and sat the full time,
but the eggs were clear. Black-backed and Herring Gulls have
reared young.

Among the recent additions we may note a fine example
of the Ruby-throated Bulbul (Rubigula dispar ), on which species
Mr. Phillipps wrote an article in the Magazine a short time back,*
a Yellow Sparrow (. Passer flaveolus&apos;) from Burma, which is but
rarely imported ; a valuable collection from South and Central
America, brought back by Messrs. Albert and Hugo Pam, and
including a Naked-eyed Pigeon ( Columba gymnophthalma ), two
Condors (S. gryphus&apos;), and an Orinott Goose (C jubata ), and, lastly,
a Hawk ( Cerch?ieis ardesiacus&apos;) and a fine pair of Touracous ( Muso-
phaga rossez), from Africa, brought back by Mr. L. M. Seth-Smith.
In a forthcoming number it is hoped to figure the Touracous,
which are, I believe, the first of their kind to be imported.

' Die Vozelwarte Rossiten ' is a small pamphlet, profusely
illustrated with photographs, dealing with the German Bird
Observatory in the Kurische Nehrung. The object of this obser-
vatory, which has now been established some three years, is
largely for the study of migration, and is under the direction of
Dr. Thieneman. Much work is done by the ringing of birds,
and already some striking results have been achieved. Maps are
given in the cases of the Hooded Crow and Black-headed Gull,
showing in the former instance a marked westward trend after
reaching the southern shores of the Baltic. In the case of the Black-
headed Gulls which nest at Rossiten. their southward migration
appears to follow three routes either (i) along the coast as far
south as Bordeaux, or due south across Europe to the Adriatic

at Trieste, or southwards across Europe via the Rhine and the
Rhone. At present it seems to us that the routes are defined too
definitely for the number of birds recovered, and in some cases,
e.g. on the Danube and Save routes are marked which do not
seem to be substantiated by any direct evidence ; however, as
time goes on and more birds are recovered the results are bound
to correct themselves. Some of the most striking results have
been obtained from the ringing of Storks, several of which have
been shot in South Africa, 5000-6000 miles from their birth-place.
The investigation has further established that the young Storks
return in the spring to within a radius of 50 miles (6-94 km) of
where they were bred.
Many more years work will be necessary to confirm and
deduct theories from these results, but they form sound incon-
trovertible facts on one of the most fascinating features of bird-
life. J* B.
AMERICAN AVICULTURE.
Breeding operations appear to be conducted on a large
scale in the New York Zoological Park. I11 No. 40 of the
Zoological Society Bulletin it is stated that 300 Mallards were
hatched between May 1 and June 20. This number contains
three interesting articles contributed by Mr. Lee S. Crandall.
The most important deals with the fine collection of Waterfowl
belonging to Mr. T. A. Havemeyer, who has on his estate at
Maliwah, New Jersey, about 300 birds, including seven species
of swans, twenty-eight of geese, and eight of ducks. The
grounds consist of over 3000 acres of broad, rolling lowlands ;
three enclosures, each with miniature lakes and an ample ex-
panse of grazing grounds are provided for the birds. So far,
nothing special has been achieved in the way of breeding, the
only broods recorded being those of Canada, Egyptian, and
Upland Geese, Wigeon and Mallard.
It is interesting to know that Mr. Havemeyer has secured
a pair of Hawaiian Geese, which are better known 011 this side
as Sandwich Island Geese. By that name the birds have been
designated in the records of the Zoological Society for over
eighty years, and it is indicated in the specific name sandvicensis .

In 1887 Mr. Scott Wilson expressed his apprehensions that the
species would soon become extinct in a wild state. Mr. Crendall
fears that this may be brought about "as the result of indis-
criminate slaughter by Japanese immigrants." We certainly
hope that the New York Zoological Society will draw the
attention of the United States authorities to the matter and
endeavour to secure a measure of protection for these birds.
They bred freely at our Zoological Gardens, the Society's farm
at Kingston, and at Knowsley; and Lord Stanley, afterwards
the Earl of Derby, believed that, with a little care, they might
be domesticated. Other rare species in the collection are the
Maned Goose, which has bred at Gooilust and the Berlin Zoo-
logical Garden, Emperor, Ashy-headed, and Ruddy - headed
Geese. I11 the Berlin Garden the Ashy-headed Goose (&amp;lt;J) has,
in the last two successive years, produced hybrids with the
Variegated Sheldrake, and the young in down plumage had the
typical Sheldrake dress.
Although it is not stated that most of the rarer birds came
from Gooilust, there seems to be little doubt that such is the
case.* This presumption ripens into certainty, when one reads
that "It is planned to build this year a number of smaller
paddocks in [each of] which a pair of birds may nest in peace."
This arrangement is a special feature of Mr. Blaauw's method of
keeping his waterfowl, and one of the chief factors of his success
in breeding. Some of these successes have been recorded in our
own pages, others in the Ibis, whence many have been quoted by
Miss Rose Hubbard in her "Ornamental Waterfowl."
A shorter article deals with the moult of the Willow
Grouse, and is interesting as recording observations on birds in
captivity; it adds, however, little, if anything, to what was
written by Mr. W. R. Ogilvie-Graut 011 the subject in tli e Annals of
Scottish Natural History (1894, pp. 129-140) and included in the
first volume of his " Game Birds." Although the account of the
breeding of the Cereopsis Goose in the Zoological Park adds
nothing to our knowledge of the habits of the species in cap-
tivity, it is of considerable importance as recording, as far as is

known, the first instance of successful reproduction in America.
In this country Cereopsis Geese were first bred in the Royal
Menagerie at Windsor. When that was broken up, on the death
of George IV., eight birds came into the possession of the
Zoological Society, and the fact of their breeding at Kingston
Hill is recorded in the Farm Report published in 1832.

Sir,--M r. Astley's plan for members to club together and send out
their own Collector would be an excellent plan if it were feasible.
But would sufficient funds be collected for it ?
Members want birds from many quarters of the globe. Say that our
desires were all concentrated 011 S. America, or Australia, or New Guinea,
money enough might be found.
If the leading purchasers would agree amongst themselves never to
pay till the birds were delivered in sound condition, and observe the agree-
ment, they would work a change.
F. G. Dutton.
Sir,--I think that Mr. Astley's suggestion that an Association for
importing birds should be formed is most heartily to be supported, but I am
afraid the difficulties in the way are many and great. Many of the dealers
seem to look upon birds as mere instruments for money making, and treat
them shamefully. It is difficult to understand why they go into the
business if they have no love for birds. I had a good many birds sent over
to me while I was in Ireland, and I found that I could not get most of the
iealers to understand that due warning of time of despatch is necessary.
They seem to think that a bird has no more feelings or wants than a brick, and
that what happened to the unfortunate birds after leaving their shops was a
matter of supreme indifference to them. I have spent much money in
wiring with prepaid answers, and much time going down to the station to
meet every mail train in the day, all for the want of a little courtsey and
humanity 011 the part of the dealers. The general condition of dealers'
airds on arrival is usually very bad indeed. They are almost invariably very
ill, and take much time and trouble to bring round, and are consequently
useless for breeding purposes for some time after one has acquired them.

As Ci ossbills have attracted so much notice la tel v, a few notes on
one which lias been a cage pet of ours since November 1905, mav be ot
interest. He had been in the possession of a friend for over a year pre-
viously, so is certainly more than six years old, and is still in the best of
health and plumage, the colouring of the latter being yellow-green through-
out. He eats almost anything; ordinary seed, green peas in the pod, an
ear of wheat or oats, elm-buds, as well as the seeds of the larch or Scotch
fir; the green cones are especial favourites. His song, though not power-
ful, is very pleasant; and his movements, as he climbs about his cage, verv;
interesting.
As soon as I enter the dining-room, where his cage hangs, he wel-
comes me with the sharp call of "jip, jip, jip," and if the process of clean-
ing his cage and feeding him is deferred till later than usual, he protests
till his grievence is remedied. In hot weather he loves bathing, and drinks
rather freely at all times.
I find it a good plan to replace the ordinary perches in a Crossbill's
cage with fresh boughs of Scotch fir from which they like to nibble off
the bark. Julian G. Tuck.

TREATMENT OF BIRDS OF PREY IN CONFINEMENT.

Sir,-- I have read with much interest Mr. Bonliote paper on "Ages
of Birds," and his remarks about Birds of Prey.
I have had some experience of these birds, and on the whole agree
with what Air. Bonhote says, but with ordinary care and good food carefully
administered most raptorial birds thrive in confinement, and are amongst
the longest livers.
There is no doubt but that the)'' do extremely well in enclosed aviaries
only open in front and facing to the South, but it is hard to give enough
space to large birds. While the finest individuals I have ever seen have
had large flights, I do not believe that the true Falcons and Goshawks
can ever be kept in perfection with flights to their cages. My mentor in
the keeping of Birds of Prey was the late Edward Fountaine, of Easton,
Norwich. I saw his beautiful collection first in 1873. They were all\\\ enclosed
aviaries with open fronts facing the South ; and I remember their faultless
condition. He impressed me, however, with the necessity of water both
for diinking and bathing, which practice I have kept to ever since. With
few exceptions all are most regular drinkers and bathers. As all falconers
know a hawk will not fly until she has been "Weathered," viz. drank,
bathed, dried and plumed herself. If flown before having "Weathered"
the first thing she does is to go on the "soar" to look for water, and when
she has found it you may wait for her until she is ready !
Many birds will live without water. The unfortunate hens that are

sed as foster mothers for Pheasants often live without it for ten weeks in
burning sun, and you are told that they are given moistened food once a
ay! Rut I do not recommend the treatment.
Some of the Falcons, viz. the Saker, has the reputation of never
lathing. Owls of the genus Strix rarely bathe, neither do Owls of the
;enus Athene , but Surnium (Bubo) Asio, in fact all other Owls are great
lathers. E. G. B. Mkade-Wai v do.

veil as a letter in the Times of the 8th, and in the Daily Telegraph of the
oth, must be my excuse for again reverting to this subject.
"It is perhaps only to be expected that the ordinary naturalist should
magiue that the more roomy the cage the happier and better the bird is
ikely to be ; to those, however, who have studied birds in captivity and
vhose object has always been to keep them, as far as may be, in the best of
lealth (and I suppose it will not be denied that no bird unless in good health
:an be happy) the matter is a complex one.
Take for example a Kestrel, though these remarks would have equal
orce if applied to any other species, the roomiest aviary in the world will
lot induce this species to indulge in that flight which affords the field
laturalists so much pleasure. And why? Because such a flight is only
mdertaken for the purpose of procuring food. If a very large aviary, such
is let us say the Gulls' enclosure at the Zoological Gardens, could be
levoted to two or three Kestrels, who would receive no dead food but
Would have to subsist merely 011 live sparrows and mice put in for the pur-
pose, then probably the birds might indulge in aerial exercise. Such a
scheme is, however, ridiculous and impossible, not to mention the cruelty
nvolved to the sparrows and mice.
" The advocates of a large aviary may however argue that, even if the
birds do not exercise, it is all on the right side to give them the opportunity.
But is it ? The birds take no exercise but sit on some perch in the outside
portion of the aviary exposed to all the elements for there is probably
but little shelter outside and they have a natural aversion to using a house.
Gradually their plumage fades and wears, they get soaked with rain and
in a few months or possibly a year they die.
"There is yet another difficulty; most birds of prey are overfed in
confinement and this leads to sluggish livers and a still further disinclination
to move; but if by chance they get suitably fed (a matter almost impossible
of attainment in large Gardens where they cannot be treated individually)
they will become restless a few hours before feeding time and in taking the
flights, which a large aviary allows, they almost invariably injure either
themselves or their plumage.

Officers for the Year.
"If on the other hand they are kept in covered aviaries of a reason-
able size and properly fed, they will merely hop from perch to perch when
they become restless, and their plumage being protected from the weather
will retain its natural colour and gloss until the moulting season comes
round again, while being in perfect health and plumage they cannot fail to
be happy and a delight to those that watch them.
"These are then my reasons for advocating small closed-in places
for birds of prey in preference to large open flights. I have studied the
matter as a practical Aviculturist for many years and the fact that no
Kestrel has ever died in my aviaries under six years and eight months
speaks for itself. J. Lewis Bonhote."

Spindalis pretrei.
By J. Lewis Bonhote.
The genus Spindalis consists of some eight species which
are only found on the various islands in the West Indies and one
species on Cozumel Island, off the coast of Mexico. They are
all very similar in general coloration and differ chiefly in the
greater or less intensity of the different portions of their plumage.
The subjects of the accompanying plate were brought from Cuba
and purchased by the Zoological Society, unfortunately the hen
has since died and the male bird when I last saw him did not
appear in very good health.
Like most West Indian Birds they are seldom imported,
but in their own country (I am speaking more particularly of
the Bahamas) they are frequently caught alive and seem to stand
captivity very well. One which I had for some months lived
entirely on fruit, readily taking any kind that was offered. In a
wild state, however, they seem to prefer small berries and were
always to be found round the fruit-bearing trees in the thick bush.
I was never able to locate a nest of this bird, nor have I
been able to find any authentic description of one which, con-
sidering how common a bird it is, is somewhat curious. Gosse*
describes a nest, which was brought to him as the nest of the
Cashew Bird (the local name for the representative of this genus
in Jamaica), but its proper identification was by no means certain.
It was composed of cotton, decayed leaves, epidermis of weeds
and stalks and tendrils of the passion flower. This nest con-

tained two eggs of a dirty white splashed at their larger end
with dusky spots.
As mentioned above the differences between the various
species, though well-marked and distinct, are not great. The
form figured may be considered as a central point from which
the other species have diverged. In A. portoricensis, from Porto
Rico, the collar on the nape is yellower than S. pretrei , the rump
is concolorous with the back, and the breast pale lemon-yellow
with a small patch of reddish-orange on the lower throat.
A. nigricephala , from Jamaica, resembles S. portorice?isis but
the coloration is much more intense, and the black of the throat
and head more defined and greater in extent. The collar on the
nape is absent.
S'. ??iulticolor , from San Domingo, resembles S. pretrei but
the collar is light yellow and the lower throat deep chestnut.
Most nearly allied to this last is A. salvini , from Grand
Cayman. It differs, however, in being duller and smaller, and in
the collar being deep chestnut.
A. zena, from the Bahamas, only differs from S'. salvhii in
the color of the back, which is pure black, or nearly so, instead
of green, while from Abaco Islands, in the north of the Bahama
group, there is another form, which may be distinguished from
A. zena by the long brownish olive tips to the feathers of the
back.
Lastly, from Cozumel Island, off Mexico, we have S.
benedicti , a species which is almost identical with A. townsendi ,
though curiously enough it occurs at the opposite extremity of
their range. I am unable to give any definite points of difference
between them, but in A. benedicti the back is slightly greener and
never shows any trace of black which most of the Abaco birds
do.
This genus would be one well worth studying from the
Avicultural point of view, for so little is known about them and
with ordinary care they should not be difficult to keep in health.
I believe a well-known dealer is shortly going out to the West
Indies so we may, perhaps, hope before mail}' months are gone
to be able to record the arrival of some more of these pretty and
delightful birds.

(\0x25A0Concluded from page 334.)
There were a number of wild birds in the delightful old-
fashioned garden of " Beaumaris." A pear tree was laden with
ripe fruit, and I noticed that this was being attacked by several
species of Honey-eaters, but especially by the beautiful New
Holland or White-bearded species ( Meliornis nov&amp;lt;z-hollandi(z). As
I had several in my collection 011 the ship, I placed one in a trap
cage baited with a half-eaten pear, but although I saw the wild
birds perch on the side of the cage, none would venture inside.
Knowing that I was anxious to see all that I could of the
wild birds around Hobart, Mrs. Roberts very kindly arranged a
drive to, and a picnic at, the foot of Mount Wellington. Starting
in the early afternoon, our carriage gradually ascended higher
and higher, and at every bend of the road a magnificent view
presented itself to us. Below 11s lay the magnificent harbour,
and beyond other bays and natural harbours as far as the eye
could reach. As we passed through a belt of gum-trees we
commenced to see birds. Every now and then small parties of
Yellow-bellied Parrakeets would get up from a patch of some
seeding herbage by the roadside, or their note, sounding like
" tussok tussok " would be heard. Miss Fletcher, who was one
of the party, is an excellent ornithologist and knew every bird
we either saw or heard. Rosellas we also saw in the wood, and a
party of Musk Lorikeets passed over 11s 011 their way from a
flowering gum tree.
Every now and then we would hear the note of the
*Garrulous Honey-eater, or see the gaily-dressed New Holland
Honey-eater busy with some flowering shrub close to the road-
side.
After an excellent " billy " tea, three of us made our way
up the mountain. It was a long climb and a hard one, but we
eventually reached the top, which was covered with snow.
O11 the lower slopes the Yellow-bellied Parrakeets were
extremely common amongst the timber. Butcher-birds, locally
known as "Jackasses" were also met with. The true Lausrhiii&quot;-

Jackass is not found in Tasmania, and the Butcher-bird has
appropriated its name.
Two days later I was invited to join another picnic party
to a wooded creek at the foot of the mountain, and here we were
more fortunate in the number of birds seen. O11 this occasion the
party consisted of Mrs. and Miss Roberts, the Misses Fletcher,
Mr. and Mrs. Butler, Mr. Robert Hall and myself. With such an
ornithological party I had every opportunity of learning from
the very best authorities of the birds of the neighbourhood. It
was not a nice day, rain was falling, and as we sheltered under
some thick bushes by the side of a stream, I saw what appeared
to me then to be one of the most lovely birds I ever set eyes
up0 n. It hopped from the deep shade on to a stone in the bed of
the stream. It was a male Pink-breasted Robin (Pelroeca rhodino-
gastra ), with black back, a small white spot on the forehead, and
a breast of the most beautiful shade of pink. As we watched it
another male appeared, and for some time we watched them
hopping about amongst the thick foliage. On the hillside we
heard the mournful cooing of the Bronzewing Pigeon, and later
on the "hoop hoop" of the Brush Bronzewing.
When the rain ceased Mr. Butler and I went for a stroll
through the woods, where we saw a number of interesting birds.
The rare Acanthornis magna,a Scrub Wren peculiar to Tasmania
and some of the adjacent islands was pointed out by my com-
panion. Thick-heads (. Pachycephala ), White-eyes, Crescent and
Yellow-throated Honey-eaters, the Brown Scrub-Wren (Sericornis
hum Hi s&apos;), Fantail Flycatchers, and many other birds.
On our way back to Hobart I saw a Robin with reddish
breast, which my companions identified as a female Scarlet-
breasted Robin (Petrceca leggii). She was perched on a fence
and was soon joined by her mate, a most lovely feathered genu
The upper parts are black, and the breast most brilliant scarlet,
while the abdomen and a conspicuous spot on the forehead are
white. There are several species of Petrceca in Australia, and
lovely creatures they are. I had seen some beauties at Katoomba
in the Blue Mountains, but of the exact specie^ I was ignorant.
There could be no doubt of those I saw on this occasion
however.

Pearl Spotted Owl.
In the "Domain," a public park behind Hobart, I saw
numbers of the tiny Spotted Pardalote, minute tit-like birds,
chiefly keeping to the tops of the gum-trees, but sometimes
coming to the ground. Garrulous Honey-eaters or " Minas" as
they call them there, were plentiful, and we saw the Tasmanian
form of the Butcher-bird, the Tasmanian Magpie, Wattle-bird,
Cuckoo Shrike ( Graucalus ), Wood Swallow, and many other birds.
On Wednesday, April 22nd, I bade farewell to my kind
friends at Hobart, and early the following morning we weighed
anchor and sailed for Albany, Western Australia.
Very rough and cold weather was encountered as we sailed
round the South of Tasmania, and our stock suffered somewhat.
Four days later we reached the western port, where Mr.
L. Le Souef came out to our ship in a lighter, laden with cases
of Western Australian animals, which he had brought by rail
from Perth, some three hundred miles distant. Kangaroos,
Wallabies, Dingoes, Banksian Cockatoos, Buff-breasted King-
fisher, Mksu-ducks, and so forth.
After a stay of some four hours only we finally set sail for
home with our complete collection of some seven hundred
animals. There were many species I had greatly hoped to have
aot which I was unable to secure, but 011 the whole I think our
collection contained a fairly representative sample of the Aus-
tralian fauna.

I did not catch this little Owl myself, but it was one of
a family of four young ones taken by a trader out of a hole in
an old tree about the beginning of March. I had left Take
N^ami at the time and was on the way back to Mafeking,
but Mr. Hannay, the resident magistrate at Lake Ngami, was
shortly coming back too, and he kindly tried to buy the four
little Owls for me. Their owner would not part with them at
first, but before long one escaped and a second died, probably

from being wrongly fed, and Mr. Hannay then succeeded in
getting possession of the remaining two. However, during tlie
long waggon journey of five hundred miles down from the Lake,
one died, Mr. Hannay thinks it was killed by the mosquitos
which were terrible at that time 011 the Botletle river, and he
made a mosquito-proof cage for the survivor, but I am rather
inclined to suspect wrong diet again as the cause of death as he
was feeding them on small pieces of antelope meat. However,
the last one withstood all the hardships of the journey and came
safely into my hands on the 13th April, 1910. It was a charming
little bird and Mr. Hannay had made it very tame ; it would
always answer to a whistle and would fly out of its cage 011 to
his hand or shoulder in the evening to have its food. It became
greatly excited when I showed it my Erlauger's Scops (which I
had at the time), and bobbed up and down uttering some beautiful
clear whistles, but I was afraid to put them together as Erlanger's
Scops is a much more powerful bird and very fierce. He
curiously enough took 110 notice of the other, although usually
so observant of birds and animals.
The Pearl Spotted Owl is quite common throughout the
whole of the Kalahari desert and Ngamiland, but is like other
birds more numerous near water or places which have water
during part of the year, 110 doubt on account of the food supply.
They frequent chiefly the Kameel thorn (acacia) forests, especially
the larger trees. They are particularly common all along the
Molopo river and in the early morning and evening their curious
shrill whistling may be heard in all directions. It is a remarkable
note very easily imitated and best described as an ascending
scale of seven equally spaced clear whistles followed by a
descending scale of five or six longer drawn notes and with
longer intervals between. I have often made one answer me and
called it into the tree under which I was standing. I have
occasionally heard their note during the day time and late at
night, but usually only in the morning and evening. This Owl,
like all the small African Owls, is, I think, partially diurnal, and
they feed considerably on large insects. I have never been for-
tunate enough to find a nest, and thus see the pellets, but they
certainly catch small birds and mammals and lizards as well.

Lagopus rupestris.
By C. Barnby Smith.
Since I wrote to the Avicultural Magazine in 1908 *
concerning Rock Ptarmigan ( Lagopus rupestris&apos;) I have had some
sad losses with these birds, owing both to disease and accident.
However, as I have had, until quite recently, a pair of
Rock Ptarmigan in perfect health, which arrived from Iceland
some twelve months ago, I am not altogether in despair. Indeed
I may say that of all birds in my garden--from Sams Crane to
Pekin Robin--the Ptarmigan are my favourites. This is perhaps
partly owing to the fact that, in their case, it is easier than most
to approximate their natural surroundings. A few pieces of
limestone or granite thrown down in a rough grass enclosure,
with a few stunted bushes, form a passable background, and when
the cock Ptarmigan perches on a large stone (as he loves to do),
utters his weird cry and looks defiantly around, the onlooker is
transported away from motor cars and " increment duty " and is
living for the moment in the North of Iceland.
O11 sunny days last Autumn I was interested to notice my
Ptarmigan at play--taking sudden, short, quick runs with out-
spread wings, then suddenly stopping with a jerk, and then
dashing suddenly forward again. When one bird started these
movements another would imitate them, and their delight in
so doing was evident.
By the beginning of December all traces of brown or blue-
grey feathers had gone. It has been stated (110 doubt correctly)
that in Scotland, when the mountains are partly covered with
snow, the Ptarmigan of that country (. Lagopus mutus) select the
white patches of snow on which to crouch, and the birds are (of

Mr. C. Barnby Smith,
course) thereby rendered invisible, instead of conspicuous objects
as they would be elsewhere. Whether or not they are led to do
this by some inherited protective instinct, or whether they merely
prefer the snow to lie on as being more comfortable, I do not
pretend to say. Certain it is that I have found my Ptarmigan
prefer to crouch on patches of snow than on the turf. I well recall
my surprise at going to the enclosure one day last January,
when the ground was partly covered with snow, and finding the
Ptarmigan had completely vanished. As a matter of fact they
were right under my eyes a few yards distant, having rounded
out little hollows in the snow bringing their backs to the level
of the drift, and were thus basking in the winter sun.
Even when I had once seen the birds and came back to
the spot, it was difficult to realise they were there, so completely
were they hidden ; the only noticeable thing being the black
mark in front of the eye on cock birds. On another occasion I
found the birds crouching on the ground in an evident state of
abject terror for no apparent reason. An occasional turn of
their eyes upwards at last made me think that the supposed
enemy must be a hawk. I looked carefully round the sky
several times but failed to see anything, till I at last detected
a hawk hovering, a mere speck, over an adjoining field. This
hawk had evidently been mistaken by the Ptarmigan for their
arch-enemy, the Icelandic falcon.
The Ptarmigan remained completely white until the begin-
ning of March, when the hen bird began to show a few brown
feathers on the back of the neck. She continued to change into
breeding plumage until the beginning of May, when her new
dress was complete, not a white feather to be seen on the upper
part of the body and a good deal more black amongst the buff
on the back than I expected to see.
The change in the cock was very different, but from what
I have seen elsewhere I think it was quite natural. In April he
developed a good deal of loose red skin over the eye, but it was
not until the first week in May that he showed dark brown
feathers on the neck. At the end of May and in early June
these were followed by a few blue-grey and light brown feathers
ou the upper parts, though a good many of the white feathers

were still visible. I think that 110 one who had not seen it could
fully realise how little conspicuous a bird in this plumage is
when on a piece of rock. Mr. Frank M. Chapman, in his
Camps and Cruises of an Ornithologist," has noted this as
regards the White-tailed Ptarmigan, saying " As long as he
holds his statuesque pose he is simply a lichen covered rock."
The cock in springtime differs from the lieu in demeanour
as much as they differ in plumage. She is often stealing along
quickly under any long grass or other cover, with both neck and
tail lowered, and when stealing away might, at a short distance,
be easily mistaken for a large rat. Her evident object is to
escape observation as much as possible. Not so the cock, he
will be for ever perching on an elevated rock where he stands
erect, distends the skin over his eyes, keeps a watchful look over
the surrounding country and utters loud croaks of satisfaction,
calling upon all the world to take note of the fact that he is the
finest Ptarmigan for miles round. This at least is how my birds
behaved last Spring. I was much amused one day in May to see
the cock Ptarmigan attempting to fight a cock Reeves' Pheasant
through the wire dividing their enclosures. The Pheasant was
peacefully walking along his side of the wire when the plucky
little Ptarmigan charged violently at the wire with loud and
defiant croaks, and followed the Pheasant alongside the wire
for some ten yards, making repeated charges. He then rushed
back to the hen with both head and tail erect, evidently delighted
at his own success in driving off the intruder. I thought this
conduct looked hooeful for nesting, and I also noticed for several
weeks that the cock Ptarmigan kept working little hollows in
the grass at different places and inviting the lien to enter. He
must have made at least a dozen of these. O11 June the 14th, f
noticed him perched on his stone as usual, when the hen sud-
denly came out of a tuft of grass near a low bush where she had
been lying. The cock at once jumped down with low growls of
disgust and slowly drove the hen back. He then resumed his
perch. I11 about one minute the hen again came out and began
feeding. The cock again immediately jumped down, swearing
loudly, and violently chased her back. She did not venture out
again whilst I was watching. It was not until the 17th ol June

that an egg was laid. The site selected was under a broom in a
little hollow made some weeks previously. My Ptarmigan run
is at times, unfortunately, infested with rats, so the birds have
had to spend the night in an inner enclosure covered with rat-
proof wire. Hence the trouble when the hen Ptarmigan nested
in the outer enclosure. However, I determined after this to keep
the birds entirely in the inner enclosure for a week to see if they
would make a fresh nest there. This effort was (as I half ex-
pected) without result. With this apparently complete failure of
nesting operations I was left musing deeply on the late poet
Laureate&apos;s forcible phrase, " Curse me the British vermin, the
rat."
However, in this case, as in many others, the unexpected
happened. When I first kept the birds by day in the inner
enclosure I put the egg with them, placing it in a little nest of
dead grass which I made, and when I let the birds out at the end
of about a week I removed the egg. To my surprise, after a
few more days, the Ptarmigan laid one evening in the artificial
nest. She laid thirteen eggs here between the 30th of June and
22nd of July. The eggs were very carefully covered by her
(especially at first) with a covering of grass about an inch thick.
The covering was afterwards less thick, but the nest was, at all
times, so arranged as not to be noticeable a couple of yards away.
1 he cock helped the hen to make the covering, pulling grass
with great vigour. I noticed the hen on several occasions after
laying very busy working the eggs about in the nest. When she
went to lay the cock bird would always go with her and perch on
a stone near the nest.
for some reason or other (which I did not understand at
the time) the Ptarmigan refused to sit. After laying the 13th
egg she left the eggs quite uncovered for a few hours, and after-
wards returned to the nest and sat on the eggs for about an hour
both that and the following day. Without being disturbed she
then deserted the nest. I placed the thirteen eggs under a
bantam. About five days later the hen Ptarmigan died rather
suddenly. Some of the eggs proved to be bad ; as to the rest--
the bantam, with laudable but ill-advised attempt to expedite
matters, on and prior to the twenty-fourth day of sitting, pecked

the chicks out of the shells and none lived, so that the whole
attempt ended in disastrous failure. Nevertheless it was (to me
at least) a failure of such interest as to encourage further efforts.
I am getting a hen Willow Grouse to go with my cock Ptarmigan

BIRD NOTES FROM THE ZOOLOGICAL GARDENS.

September is always a dull month in the bird line, whether
the birds are wild or in captivity. The nesting season is over,
and most species are indulging in a full moult, when, needless to
say, they do not look their best. At such times also, in contra-
distinction to their spring habits, they tend like brer rabbit to
* lie low and say miffing ' as though ashamed of their weather
beaten aspect. Towards the end of the month, however, when
they have donned their new livery they become more lively and
may even play at nesting, as was the case to-day (September 21st)
with two Herring Gulls, till the first cold snap reminds them to
husband their energies for the approach of winter.
The Birds of Paradise are by now nearly through their
moult and are already beginning to indulge in their loud raucous
cries and to show off their newly acquired plumage in anticipa-
tion of coming summer, for it must not be forgotten that in their
sunny homes in the South Pacific, they nest during our mid-
winter.
Among the new arrivals may be noticed two Roseate
Spoonbills and three Darters from America, the former have not
often been seen in the Gardens and the latter have been absent
from the collection for some years. From America, also, a pair
of Dusky Ducks has been imported. This is a dull coloured
species, closely allied to the Mallard and one in which both
sexes are alike.
The genus Anas offers the curious instance of nearly allied
species in one of which the sexes are markedly distinct, while in
others they are practically alike. A similar case occurs in the
Pintails (. Dafila ) where our common species shows marked
sexual differentiation and the Bahama Duck and Chilian Pintails

practically none. These last two are now placed in a separate
genus ( Pcecilojietta) but they are none the less very closely allied
to the true Dafila.
Perhaps the most noticeable instance of this sex difference
(or lack of it) is to be found in two species of Wheatears from
North Africa, Saxicola luge?is and Saxicola halophila. These
species both inhabit similar localities (viz. sandy deserts), the
former in Egypt, the latter in Tunis. The males are practically
indistinguishable and only to be recognised by a difference in the
amount of white on the primaries. Yet in A. lugens the female
is merely a rather duller counterpart of her mate, while in
*S. halophila the differences are striking. These cases must
probably be due to some physiological causes and it should not
be beyond the power of Aviculture to throw some light upon
them.
The appearance in the new Bird of Prey Aviaries of two
fine young Peregrines, confiscated for having been illegally
taken, remind us that a few of the rarer hawks still breed here
in spite of persecution. They look in fine health and plumage
though most bird lovers would probably prefer to think of them
soaring over the Solent and the cliffs of their birthplace in
the Isle of Wight.
A pair of Carolina Doves (. Zenaidura carolinensis) and two
Cuban Trogons ( P . temmurus ) complete the list of the principal
additions with the exception of a Manx Shearwater picked up in
a street of Greater London. The Shearwaters are seldom seen
in captivity nor do they live long when caught, none the less a
little trouble in finding out their requirements would be well
spent, for they are mysterious birds spending their lives on the
high seas and only approaching land when storm tossed or for
purposes of breeding. At their nesting haunts, however, but
little is seen of them for they nest in holes and only arrive and
depart after dark.
There is one breeding record to be noted, that of a Red-
collared Lorikeet ( Irichoglossiis rubritorques). The pair nested in
a box in one of the large cages in the Parrot House and a fine
healthy young one left the nest early in the month.

WILLIAM MACGILLIVRAY*

<bodyText confidence="0.984145472222222" page_id="58072793"  page_num="355" year="" vol="">
This book should prove to be of more than ordinary
interest to the bird-lover. It is a carefully arranged record of the
life of one of the most eminent British Ornithologists of his day,
and considering the fact that no materials for a complete
biography of Prof. MacGillivray now exist and that all but two
volumes of his journals were accidentally destroyed by fire many
years ago in Australia, we are given a more complete account of
his life than we are led to expect from the Author's introductory
note.
The earlier chapters of the work give a vivid impression
of the irresistible fascination which nature exercised over the
young medical student, a fascination which so dominated him that
as soon as opportunity offered he abandoned his medical studies
for more congenial scientific work. The account of his work is
followed by a most interesting appreciation of the same by Prof.
J. A. Thomsom, and the concluding chapters are devoted to
extracts from MacGillivray's writings, each extract a word picture
in itself of what the writer saw and observed.
But it was not only as a writer that MacGillivray was able
to portray the beauties of his beloved nature, he excelled also as
an Artist and his drawing of birds now in the British Museum of
Natural History, some of which are reproduced in the volume
before us, remain for beauty and minuteness of detail, unsurpassed
up to the present day. The plate of the Meadow Pipit and
Young Cuckoo, p. 126 (which we reproduce here by kind per-
mission of the publisher) is particularly beautiful and life-like.
MacGillivray was born in 1796* and his work therefore
was carried on under difficulties, of which we in the light of
modern science know little or nothing. The works ol Linneaus
and Pennant were his only guides and " he knew no living
wight "
It may be, however, that it was this freedom from book
knowledge, and the consequent necessity of seeing and observing

for himself, unhindered by the pre-conceived opinions of others,
which led him to take every opportunity of studying birds and
plants in their natural surroundings, and it was as an ardent
field-naturalist that MacGillivray acquired the mass of extra-
ordinarily interesting information which made his scientific work
so fascinating and valuable. His zeal and energy were tremen-
dous, no trouble or hardship deterred him from furthering his
knowledge. Nights were spent on mountain tops in order to
study the habits ol birds, and discomforts which would have
discouraged many another man, were clieefully put up with.
In September 1819, he walked all the way from Aberdeen to
London to see the British Museum, and fortunately the parts of
his journal describing this experience are still in existence. We
would lefer 0111 leaders to Chapter II. where copious extracts are
given.
In 1830 MacGillivray was appointed Conservator of the
Museum of the Edinburgh College of Surgeons, and in addition
to his work there found time to compile and write his " Historv
of Biitish Biids and to assist Audubon in preparing his great
work " Ornithological Biographies." This great American orni-
thologist had come to Scotland in order to publish his works on
American birds, for which there was no opening in America in
those days! His acquaintance with MacGillivray ripened into a
deep friendship which proved profitable to them both.
The very considerable work which these two books, and
many minor writings, entailed was not however allowed to
interfere with his duties at the Museum and we read that one
year after his appointment as Conservator, the whole collection,
comprising some 4000 specimens, was moved to a more suitable
building, where MacGillivray cleaned and labelled every article
with his own hands.
In 1833 was sent to London to inspect the Museums
there, 011 which he subsequently wrote a report.
In 1841 he resigned this post to take up the Professorship
of Civil and Natural History in Marischal College, Aberdeen.
It is most interesting in reading this book to note from
the extiacts given from MacGillivray's writings his continual
insistence upon the necessity of studying animals and plants in

their living state. It was "the business of living creatures"
which appealed to him so strongly, and he saw then, what the
foremost workers in zoology are realizing now, that the study of
living specimens is absolutely indespeusible to true scientific
work. It is from this point of view that the writings of
MacGillivray are of such interest to all aviculturists, for although
most of his observations were from animals and plants in their
wild state his arguments and reasonings hold equally good where
birds in captivity are concerned, and it is beyond question that
certain facts, concerning for instance moult, incubation, length
of life, etc., can only be satisfactory obtained from living speci-
mens under close observation and it is here that the scientific
aviculturist can assist so vitally not only in the true study of
ornithology, but also in those greater problems of nature,
heredity, etc., which are becoming of such vital interest and
importance.
In Chapter VI., Prof. J. A. Thomson, who now holds the
position in the Aberdeen University which MacGillivray occupied
in his day, contributes a just appreciation of the latter's scientific
work which was marked throughout by a precision and attention
to detail, which subsequently earned him the epithet from
Darwin of "The Accurate MacGillivray." Unfortunately a
-crenius for detail seems often to imply a narrowness of mind on
larger questions, but MacGillivray seems to have combined to an
extraordinary degree the capacity for the most detailed work and
a breath of outlook which is truly refreshing in these days of
specialists. MacGillivray was an " all round Naturalist, a well-
equipped Geologist, Botanist and Zoologist," he taught all three
sciencies with conspicuous success, but above all his affections
were given to ornithology, and, of his work in that science we
cannot do better than quote the verdict of the late Prof. A. Newton,
who, as Prof. Thomson says " was not lavish in his compliments."
" This is not the place to dwell on MacGillivray's merits ;
but I may perhaps be excused for repeating my opinion that
after Willoughby, MacGillivray was the greatest and most
original ornithological genius save one, (who did not live long
enough to make his powers widely known) that this island has
produced."

British Birds continues to maintain its high standard,
though the two numbers under review are almost entirely com-
posed of short notes. Among the longer articles, however, we
may notice Miss Turner's account of a Wild Duck removing her
eggs to a more sheltered spot, the vegetation round the nest first
having been removed for photographic purposes. Mr. Ticehurst
gives us a further instalment of down plumages, and Mr. Witherby
describes the sequence of plumage in our Common Tits. The
" Recovery of Marked Birds" forms, perhaps, the most interesting
of the " Notes." Two Blackbirds, which were caught in fruit
nets last year having been again recaptured in the same nets
this year. Other records shew the recovery of Gulls, Woodcock,
Cuckoo, etc., but in all these cases they had travelled but a
short distance from where they were originally rung.
A LIST OF BRITISH BIRDS.f
As so many additions to the British Avifauna have been
made since the publication of the late Mr. Howard Saunders'
list in T907, the necessity for a new list on the subject for the
purposes of labelling and reference is apparent and the list
before us is practically a reprint of one recently prepared bv
Mr. Grant for the " Guide to British Vertebrates" in the Natural
History Museum.
The system used by the author for showing the status of
of each species is good and is easily understood ; but we can
hardly agree with all the author's conclusions, as for instance
the inclusion of the Shore Lark and Water Pipit in column 5

William MacGilllvray was a native of Aberdeen,
lived during his boyhood with his relations in the
island of Harris, went to his native city for his
university education--spending his long holidays
during the period of that education in Harris. While
in the course of his goings and comings between
Aberdeen and Harris, and of other excursions on
foot in many parts of the country, including a walk
from Aberdeen to London, his eyes were always
open to every object in Nature, both animate and
inanimate. All that he saw he treasured in a
retentive memory, besides committing much to
carefully written journals.
He married in 1820, and the twenty-one years
of his life that immediately followed were spent
in Edinburgh. During that period, besides attend-
ing faithfully to his official duties as Conservator
of the Museum of the Edinburgh College of
Surgeons, for the last half of that period, he devoted
much of his time to the acquisition of extended
knowledge of Nature, especially of ornithology,
which had become his favourite study.
Besides much other scientific literary work, he
published during that period the first three volumes
of his History of British Birds; and he revolutionised

the science of ornithology, by insisting on the
necessity for taking into account, in the classifica-
tion of birds, the internal as well as the external
organs, to which latter all ornithologists had, up to
that time, restricted their attention for purposes of
classification.
In 1841 he obtained the position of Professor
of Natural History in Marischal College, Aberdeen,
which he held until his death in 1852. During
that period he devoted himself with untiring energy
and zeal to the discharge of his professorial duties.
He was a most attractive teacher, and many
students were drawn to his lectures, although the
subjects of them were quite unconnected with
their own special courses of study--brother pro-
fessors even being unable to resist their attraction,
while one of them enrolled himself as a student in
his class.
In his excursions with his students he taught
them how to look at Nature in every aspect and
detail of it, while he inspired them with much of
his own spirit as a devoted lover of every natural
object on which they looked, however small or
apparently insignificant.
What a blank he left behind him when he
died! How great the loss was to all who had
relations with him of any kind---a man so loving
and so beloved! His loss to science too--quietly
progressive and evolutionary as he was in his views
--even before the days of Darwin, who can
estimate ?

(occasional visitor, never known to breed). Both these species
as is now well-known, occur on certain parts of the coast every
vear with unfailing regularity.
With regard to the systematic order used by the author
we must confess that we fail to understand it, had it commenced
&apos;'at the bottom" it would have been easier to follow but the
reason for starting with the Game birds seems incomprehensible.
Sub-species (or geographical races) are not recognised as such,
the binominal system being strictly adhered to. In a list such as
the present, this may be wise but there can be no excuse for
including the British and Continental Robin as two species and
ignoring the difference between the British and Continental
Thrush. This last-named occurs in this country in winter much
more commonly than the Robin.
A most useful feature in the present list is that references
are given to all species which have occurred on less than six
occasions. This, however, would have been made far more
useful had the original references been given in every case instead
of quoting a periodical which had copied them from the original
source.
Lastly, as a " Label List," it is not suitable, for the names
are printed far too closely together to enable them, when cut out,
to form a presentable label. In short, this list, though attempting
to supply an undoubted want, might have been so much better
had more care and attention to detail been bestowed on it, as it
stands, however, it is superior to existing lists.

Sir-- l send these notes to the Avicultural Magazine hoping they
nay be of some slight interest, but I fear most of the birds I write about are
iot such as ate in the hands of many members of the Society.
During the past season my more ordinary birds, such as the Australian
Parrakeets, have absolutely refused to nest; I have, however, had success
with Stella Lories, two pairs of these beautiful birds having successfully
reared young. The pair of Black Lories that reared a young bird last year
have been successful again ; this young bird has not flown yet, but it is very
strong and healthy.

The Society&apos;s Medal.
I have had unsuccessful eggs from Red-naped Lorikeets, Black-cap
Lories and Yellow-streaked or Red-fronted Lories.
I think I once mentioned in the Magazine how fond the Greater and
Lesser Apodas were of mice and small birds ; I recently had another illustra-
tion of how Birds of Paradise feed on flesh. While watching the birds in
an aviary containing Lawe's Six-plumed and Prince Rudolph's Birds of
Paradise a mouse ran out from behind some pipes, immediately one of the
Six-plumed birds pounced on it with a silent Owl-like flight and very soon
had the mouse killed and [eaten. I was very much surprised.at this, as I
always looked upon this species as more frugiferous than .insectivorous,
and the beak does not look at all like breaking up live creatures such as
mice for food.
Last Spring I had an instance of the value of sop as an occasional
food for birds I should never have thought of giving it to. I had, in one
aviary, five Superb birds of Paradise; these birds were rather given to fits
which soon passed off and seemed to leave the birds none the worse I
tried all ways to check these fits but without success. One day I required an
aviary fora new arrival and, so to get the space required, I put two Scarlet
Tallagers and a Fruit-sucker into the Superbs&apos; aviary. In a few days the
Snperbs were taking some of the sop given for the Tanagers and Fruit-
sucker, and since then there have been no more fits.
