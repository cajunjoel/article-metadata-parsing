EXPERIENCE DURING FIFTEEN YEARS WITH
THE FEEDING AND MANAGEMENT OF
HUMMING BIRDS IN CAPTIVITY
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.976560379310345" page_id="58090740"  page_num="Page 1" year="" vol="">
By Axel Reventlow (Managing Director of the Zoological Gardens,
Copenhagen, Denmark)
Since we got our first Humming Birds in May, 1935, these small
birds have been one of our greatest attractions. Many people have
come to our Zoo specially to see the Humming Birds, and on busy
days one or two keepers constantly have to regulate the stream and to
make the crowd move on. This interest has not diminished since the
arrival of the first birds, and in this connection I should like to mention
that a gentleman from England, who had never before seen live
Humming Birds, was so enthusiastic about the birds that he at once
cancelled his air passage in order to study them for a whole day.
In our bird-house at present we have a stock of about 700 birds of
more than 300 different species, but the Humming Birds still prove
the principal attraction. On the 1st August, 1952, we had 40
Humming Birds of eight or nine different kinds.
It is very important that the Humming Birds should be in good
condition on arrival. According to my experience, the last con-
signments to Europe of these birds have not, by far, been of the
same good quality or consisting of as many different species as before
the war. Then the birds were brought to Europe by clever and
experienced men such as Charles Cordier and the German, Danisch,
who generally caught the birds themselves and had time and patience
enough to care for and feed them, and to clean the cages properly
during the journey from Brazil, a voyage of about 10-12 days by the
great passenger liners. The Humming Birds are now coming to
Europe by air, and though this means a quicker journey, it involves
the great drawback that the crew of the aeroplanes only in very few
cases shows the least interest in the welfare of the birds. During the
last few years we have several times got collections of Humming Birds

consisting of big and very small ones all mixed together, and conse-
quently the small ones were constantly chased away from the feeding-
glasses so that many of them starved to death during the journey.
The cages were badly constructed and almost impossible to keep
clean. On arrival at our airport late in the evening many of the
birds were lying on the bottom of the cage, in a very deplorable state.
They were so soiled that they stuck together in their own faeces, and in
the food spilled from the feeding-glasses. My wife and I had to wash
every single bird several times with cotton-wool in lukewarm water,
dry them by means of a heating lamp, and feed them by hand almost
the whole night.
Immediately after the arrival of a collection of Humming Birds it
is advisable to put them into as many small cages as possible, so that
every bird can rest, and drink as much as it needs from the bottles.
It is very important to use a great number of feeding-glasses and to
place them in the cages a good distance apart. Usually I divide
the birds up into at least three different lots according to their size.
Every lot is then divided into smaller lots according to their condition.
The best specimens are placed together and can, as a rule, get along
very well when provided with sufficient light, heat, and food. The
next lot, which is weaker, must generally be fed by hand, and the last,
including quite exhausted birds and some without wing-feathers which
are consequently unable to fly up on the perches, need to be constantly
fed by hand. The birds should be taken by the beak and held between
the thumb and the third finger of the right hand ; the forefinger
should be placed on the back of the bird so that its wings are sticking
out between the fingers and can be moved when the beak of the bird
is put into the spout of a feeding-bottle which is held in the left hand.
The beak should not be put too far into the liquid and care must be
taken not to spill any of the liquid on the feathers.
It is quite astonishing to observe the vitality of these small creatures,
in many cases weighing only i J to 4 grams. Very often I have seen
them lying stiff and motionless with closed eyes and expanded wings
on the bottom of the travelling boxes, but putting them into my breast
or trouser pockets I soon found them beginning to stir the wings and,
shortly after having been fed by hand, they sat on the perches or were
flying around in the cage as if nothing had happened to them. After
the arrival of new birds we generally do not put out the electric light
at night for about a week so that they are able to find the feeding-
glasses and to drink whenever they like.
At present our Humming Birds are placed in five cages or aviaries,
two of them being 145 cm. long, 135 cm. deep, and 180 cm. high. The
medium-sized cages are 325 cm. long, 235 cm. deep, and 290 cm. high
--and the biggest one is 1,250 cm. long, 500 cm. deep, and 400 cm.
high. The Humming Birds are generally put together according to

<bodyText confidence="0.998955555555556" page_id="58090742"  page_num="Page 3" year="" vol="">
their size, so that the smallest species are preferably placed in the
smallest cages. It is, however, remarkable to note that a number of
Mosquito Humming Birds, White-bellied Humming Birds, and
Swallow-tailed Humming Birds, the whole summer have got'along
splendidly in the biggest cage together with Sunbirds, Sugarbirds,
Tanagers, and other gaily coloured birds. At the end of this summer'
when the Humming Birds from the biggest of the above-mentioned
cages had to be removed, the plumage and general condition of these
birds were remarkably better in comparison with those from the
smaller cages.
All cages are furnished with live plants and flowers. The biggest
one, containing also a number of alligators and a little pond is, by
means of palms, diacenaes, sansiviera, and other plants, arranged
as an artificial tropic scene. The most suitable plants for the small
cages aie stone-ferns as for instance Nephvolepis whitmanni , Begonia,
Erica, Solatium capistvatum , Cobaea , and Monstcxa deliciosa , the long soft
aerial roots which are excellent as resting places for the Humming-
Birds. The bottom of the cages is covered with brick-coloured gravel,
moss, and grass. The moss and grass have to be renewed rather often
lest they should decay in the humid atmosphere and thus foul the air
in the cages. All plants are sprayed every day with lukewarm water
which is used by the birds for drinking and bathing purposes.
It is wonderful to see the small energetic birds sitting on the green
leaves and rubbing the water into their feathers. As the Humming
Birds have never been seen sitting on the bottom of the cages, we have
fixed some artificial leaves made of green rubber to the plants. These
artificial leaves aie somewhat the shape of dishes, so they serve both
as drinking vessels and bath tubs. The keeper enters the cages several
times daily in order to clean the leaves and to give fresh food. If we
want to catch any particular Humming Bird we spray it with a syringe
until it is soaked with water and falls to the bottom of the cage, when
it is easily caught.
It is very important that the temperature of the cages is as constant
as possible; it may, however, be a little lower at night. I consider
a temperature of 22-24 0 centigrade as best during the day, and 18-20*
centigrade at night. By accident the temperature has sometimes
fallen to 13-14* centigrade at night, but the birds have never come to
any harm.
The cages have to be supplied with plenty of fresh air. The
Humming Birds do not feel comfortable if the air is constantly too
moist or too foul, owing to decaying plants or moss. Preferably less
heat and more fresh air !
Our Humming Birds cages are heated by electricity, and we use
a varying number of stoves according to the outside temperature
and the sun : for example, if the sun is shining many hours on the

glass roof of the bird-house, we naturally put out some of the electric
stoves. We also have to take into consideration the heat from the
lamps alight in the cages. The neon tubes are placed in such a way
that the birds are illuminated from above, below, and from the sides.
It would be an advantage if the cages could be placed in a rather
low place so as to be convenient to the human eye. Having been
forced to use some existing cages, we have not yet been able to solve
the problem of illumination to our entire satisfaction, but this question
will be taken up soon. We have never noticed that the Humming
Birds, or their eyes, got damaged by the heat of the lamps or the
strong light. They are able to look directly towards the sun without
being dazzled. In the very few cases when a Humming Bird has flown
against the glass front of the cage, it was being chased by other
male birds.
As everybody knows, the Humming Birds are by nature very
quarrelsome and unsociable among themselves. I have, for instance,
never seen two of them sitting close together as many other small
birds often do. Owing to their bright colours we prefer to keep
male birds, so it is inevitable that some quarrelling takes place and
some of them drive others away from certain feeding bottles which
they consider to be their own property. It is well known that
Humming Birds in a wild state are birds which energetically and
constantly keep others away from their special territory. Every day
at certain times they are to be found on the same perches, generally
on a bare twig and in an open place. For this reason, we have put a
considerable number of bare branches and twigs into our cages, and
these are constantly being used by the birds. New Humming Birds
always require a certain space of time before choosing their special
sleeping places, but after this they can be found every night at the
same place. The newcomers are usually chased by the old ones ;
these are generally stronger than the others and are usually flying
better. We therefore temporarily remove the most pugnacious of the
old birds until the new ones become acquainted with the cages and the
feeding-bottles.
During the dark season we constantly have the artificial light burning
in the cages of the Humming Birds. In the evening most of the lamps
are put out and only a few below the ceiling remain burning for a short
time, and these are then gradually put out in the course of 10-15
minutes by means of a special dimming switch made for this purpose.
Before total darkness sets in, we count the birds through the outer
pane of glass. If any of them still prove to be restless, we must wait
and put out the last light, when all are sitting quietly at their sleeping
places. Usually the Humming Birds fall asleep very quickly, and
when healthy they sit in a very characteristic attitude with the wings
pressed very close to the body which is practically 1 esting on the

twig, with the beak pointing upwards in an angle of about 45 0 . When
sick or exhausted a Humming Bird will put its beak more or less
vertically in the air during the sleep, i.e. that means considerably
more than 45 0 . The more sick it is, the more it raises the beak.
The birds have a very tight grip on the twigs, and are almost
impossible to shake off. Having had the opportunity to study the
Humming Birds for many years, I have not yet seen any of them
" putting their heads under their wings " as many other birds do
when sleeping.
During sleep the body-temperature of these birds, which is normally
about 42 0 centigrade, drops considerably. Their consumption of
oxygen is very reduced in this condition which can practically be
called a state of torpor. I beg to refer to an article by Dr. F. W.
Braestrup in the Danish Salmonsen's Cyclopaedia, where he quotes
an article by Oliver P. Pearson in " The Condor ", vol. 52, page 145,
: 4 By Hummers the amount of oxygen varies throughout the
twenty-four hours. The Humming Bird spends the night in a
lethargic slumber during which the metabolism descends to about
tu of the normal one. Some birds could not exist at all without
becoming torpid every night. The very small kinds of Humming
Birds have a metabolism of such a rapidity that they could not take
sufficient reserves of nourishment to survive a night without eating,
if the expenditure of energy at night were normal. This is a conse-
quence of their very modest size."
The Humming Birds have a fantastic energy and endurance which
is illustrated by the following. In Birds of America , page 183, ii,
T. Gilbert Pearson writes among other things : " These Humming
Birds winter to a limited number in South Florida. The bulk of them,
however, go farther south. In the autumn nights the little birds
launch out across the Gulf of Mexico straight for Yucatan or Central
America. This incredible journey, not less than 500 miles (937! km.)
is made without a single stop for food or rest."
The Humming Birds are in their own way very intelligent and
independent animals. So they are very often in a surprising way able
to get along in an unforeseen situation. Their sense of direction is
fantastic, and they very soon get accustomed to new surroundings
and new conditions. They do not show any fear of the keeper going
into their cages every day to feed them and to clean the glass. Their
senses are developed to an astonishing degree : the sight, hearing,
and as / think also, to some extent, the sense of smell, are excellent.
In order to be sure that all the birds get sufficient to eat, we always
place a great number of feeding-glasses in our cages. Some of them
are hidden behind the big green leaves, and these glasses are of special
importance to the weaker birds and the newcomers, which are very
often chased by the other ones. Each glass is suspended by a specially

constructed holder and contains about 40 grams of liquid. According
to our experience every Humming Bird drinks on an average between
17 and 15 cm 3 of liquid in the course of twelve hours. Taking into
consideration the weight of the birds (1 i--4--5 grams), this seems quite
fantastic.
The glasses are furnished with a soft rubber cork and both this and
the glass must be kept spotlessly clean. The birds are fed twice a day.
The Morning Food (at 8 o'clock) for forty birds consists of 1 litre of
water, 4 table-spoonfuls of honey (about 125 g.), 3 table-spoonfuls of
condensed milk with sugar (about 40 g.), 1 table-spoonful of Mellin's
Food (about iog.), and a pinch of meat extract with salt (about 3 g.).
To this quantity is added 5 small drops of A and D Vitamins. Each
drop contains 750 units of A and 125 units of D vitamins. The
vitamins should be stirred very carefully in the condensed milk and
a little hot water ; the rest of the water (about 750 g.) should be
lukewarm.
At about 4.30 in the afternoon (on hot days a little earlier), the
morning food is replaced by the Night Food , which does not become
sour even if remaining 12 hours or longer in the cages. The night
food consists of 1 litre of lukewarm water, 5 table-spoonfuls of honey
(about 160 g.) stirred and mixed up with the contents of 1 ampoule
10 mg. of vitamin B (chlorhydrate of thiamine), and 1 ampoule of
100 mg. vitamin G (ascorbic acid).
The recipe of this vitamin food has been given by Mr. Charles
Gordier in the Avicultural Magazine, Vol. 58, No. 4, page 143,
July-August, 1952, in an article entitled " A Better Way to feed
Humming Birds ". In the Copenhagen Zoo we have, however,
with what I should call fairly good results, been using for many
years what Cordier in his article calls " an antiquated formula "
which contains less honey but some sugar and 2 tablespoonfuls
of Mellin's Food. We have now started gradually to reduce the
quantity of Mellin's Food and to increase the quantity of honey.
There are, however, two things Mr. Gordier does not mention in his
article : fresh water and the provision of live insects. As most
Humming Birds in a wild state eat quite a lot of small live insects, etc.,
I attach great importance to this kind of food. In 1934 I brought
along with me about 25 live fruit-flies (Drosophila repleta ) from the
Zoological Garden in Berlin and having later established a special
fly-farm we have now reared millions of these small insects. We
catch them in a net and release them alive to the birds which catch
them in the air and eat them.
All our Humming Bird cages are of course made in a way to prevent
the small flies from escaping.
During the years in which we have kept Humming Birds we have
several times had to deal with severe invasions of red ants ( Mono -

moriiwi pharaonis) in our cages. These small pests climbed from the
walls on to the branches and from these down along the suspended
feeding-glasses sometimes in such numbers that the spouts of the
glasses were nearly stuffed up. We found that the Humming Birds
did not like this and consequently to some extent kept away from the
liquid food. By suspending the feeding-glasses in yet another piece of
steel-wire which goes through a small glass tube almost filled with
ordinary watei and with a cork at the bottom, we have now been
able to stop this plague. The red ants cannot now get at the liquid
food and for this reason leave the cage in search of other food.
Before making use of our little " invention " the average quantity
of liquid food consumed by each Humming Bird during its twelve
feeding hours was 14*655 cm 3 , but afterwards 14*815 cm 3 . This shows
an average difference of 0*16 cm 3 , for each bird during its twelve
hours of feeding and besides it clearly shows how even small things
can be of importance in connection with the feeding and management
of difficult or delicate animals in captivity.
Humming Birds in captivity have to be constantly and carefully
examined. The claws should be cut when too long, as otherwise the
birds do not fly as much as they should. It has happened now and
then that some of the birds get a kind of paralysis of the tongue which
then cannot be withdrawn but remains more or less protruding from
the beak. Even if the tip of the tongue is quite dry, the bird is able
to live for quite a long time. I have been told that this is due to the
bird having caught a cold. I don't understand, however, how this
suddenly can happen to birds living in such a steady temperature.
We have tiied to cure such a case by giving the bird aureomycin
dissolved in the food, but so far the result has not come up to our
expectations.
How long do the Humming Birds live in captivity ?
Unfortunately, I have only very little information from other
Zoological Gardens, and can only say that we have lost quite a lot
of Humming Birds since the war because they arrived in a miserable
condition. I have not yet had time to treat this matter statistically,
but I am able to state that 28 birds or more than 38 per cent of our
first stock (from 17th May, 1935, till 5 th June, 1945) consisting of
74 Humming Birds lived more than one year, 8 birds or 11 per cent
lived more than two years, and 5 birds or 7 per cent lived more than
three years, 1 bird lived almost four years, and finally 1 bird eight
years less thirteen days.
For fui ther details, I should like to refer to my articles in the
German periodical Der J^oologische Garten , 1941, vol. 13, page 167-178,
and the Avicultural Magazine, Vol. 54, No. 3, pages 69-79.

By Terry Jones (Leckford, Hants, England)
It has been a fairly good season here, but when a collection is as
big and as varied as this one it is almost impossible to have a good
season with every kind of bird.
The Parrot family has done badly. We had a good pair of Princess
of Wales who reared young every year. This year the pair bred satis-
factorily, hatching four young and rearing three, all strong birds.
One night there must have been a cat or something on the aviary roof.
The aviary is 72 feet long, and the birds have distance enough to
acquire some speed, enough speed with which to kill themselves
against the wire, and unfortunately this is what happened, and now
we have the mother and one youngster only.
Incidentally, some people may not know that this species is one of
the few Parrakeets larger than a Grass Parrakeet which is not
destructive to shrubs. The Stanley Parrakeets excelled themselves
this year, laying six eggs and hatching and rearing one.
Last year we reared a number of Fischer's Lovebirds, and I decided
to keep them to try to build up a good breeding stock ! Even if I
could sell any of them to-day, I should hardly get any more for the
whole lot than I could have got for one pair of young birds last year.
This species bred quite well again this year.
And so we come to the Peach-faced Lovebirds. Here again we are
in trouble In 1950 we bred some nice young birds from a very old
pair which died last year. Then in Cage Birds in the autumn of 1950
I saw an advertisement offering three young unsexed Peach-faced for
sale. These I bought, and after marking them and our own three by
cutting a few feathers on the back of the head of one, shoulder of
another, tail of a third, and so on, we turned the six out together.
The food room window overlooks their outdoor flight, and the idea
was to watch the birds unobserved by them, and to note which fell
in love with what. It seemed a foolproof way of sexing these difficult
birds. Mrs. Milligan, whose charges they are, spent days, weeks, and
months watching them. They got along fine, and were nearly always
in pairs, but the snag from our point of view was that A who is sitting
with B , was sitting an hour ago with C, and has in fact sat with the
rest. My idea of a pair is the same as Noah's, but their idea of a
pair was two birds, simply that !
The summer of 1951 they spent all together. We never saw any
bird feed any other. We put up enough boxes to look like a " Develop-
ment Area " and supplied willow and lime boughs. The birds had a
grand time stripping the boughs and in clambering in and out of
boxes, but no material was carried into the boxes. This spring, 1952,
Mrs. Milligan had decided that A was now paired to B and C to Z),

so they were put in separate aviaries. " They were not hatched till
August, we told each other, " and were too young to breed last year "
But nothing has happened at all this year till the other day late
October when B was seen to stuff a splinter in her rump feathers and
fly to a box. I hese boxes had not been removed, as no one seemed
m danger of egg-binding. However, they were promptly removed
and in eai ly November B laid an egg from a perch. At last we know
the sex of one of the party, and now we must wait till 1953. This
has cheered us up so much that Mrs. Milligan has been rash enough to
say that she is certain that D also is a hen. Having spent two seasons
wondering whether all were males, I now am wondering whether
perhaps all are females. We tried sexing the birds by the width
between their pelvis bones, but anyone who has kept poultry knows
how much the width varies according to the state of the bird's ovaries.
In Nyasa Lovebirds we had an old bird and three youngsters
which came from the Duke of Bedford. One bird died during the
winter. The three between them built two nests, but forgot to lay.
I must try to get some more of these nice little Lovebirds, and see
whether we can pair them up more successfully than we have the
Peach-faced.
The two Touracous we know are both hens and, as they do each
year, both laid and sat on their eggs. One of them is a delightfully
tame bird who has been here since 1938. The Sun Bittern, a charming
small owl from New Caledonia, or somewhere like that, are both
pre-war birds and continue to thrive, and so do the two cock Wonga-
wonga Pigeons, also pre-war birds.
The breeding results amongst the Pheasants is also mixed. We
will start with the bad news. No. 1 pair, Monals, had been together for
ten years, and were a very good breeding pair. Without any warning
the cock murdered his wife. No. 2 pair : Again a good breeding pair.
Something scared the hen one day in early spring, and she was found
imp and warm with a smashed skull. Pair No. 3 : A cock which was
very tame and a young two-year-old hen, daughter of one of the
above, who was laying for the first time. She laid just one clutch of
eggs. Six, I think, were hatched and five reared. These five are
possibly all cocks !
Besides the above we have a very nice 1951 cock we had kept as a
St *nt- ir * intendin S to res erve him a mate from this year's crop.
Chinquis Peacock Pheasants are another poor patch. We lost
three old birds ; two of them the best pair we ever had, were well
pre-war. But we have some nice young pairs, so next year we should
be all right. Only two young were reared this year.
Elliotts were new birds. The cock went into a moult as the hens
started to lay. Only two eggs hatched, and these proved to be a pair
but the cock unfortunately, though a very vigorous bird, has bad feet.

A young pair of Grey Jungle Fowl were also newcomers. The cockerel
crowed day and night, particularly at night. A cheerful guy, bred
from American stock, he shouted his curious call which sounded
to me like " Chum--hi-yeah ! hi-yeah--chum ! " He had ceased
crowing when his little hen eventually laid five eggs which proved
clear. Eight young Brown Crossoptilons were reared from one young
pair ; the second pair did not breed. Incidentally, our males are
spurred, as was the pre-war European stock. Twenty-three Mikado
were reared, fine birds, but I am afraid a rather henny lot; 16
Temmincks Tragopans; 16 Blue Crossoptilons, 15 Swinhoes, 11
Edwards, and 27 Amherst.
Swans. The old female Black Swan is at present a widow, and
having a well-earned rest from child rearing. She and her mate,
who came here as adults in 1937, have bred continuously ever since,
not quite managing three broods a year. They have hatched cygnets
in every month of the year, and have never lost a cygnet. She has
been single since February, but a mate should arrive soon. Her
daughter is due to start breeding next spring. The Whooper female
is a failure in that she prefers human society to Swan's. She lays every
year between eight and fourteen eggs upon which she dutifully sits.
Unfortunately, she almost always forgets that male Swans have a small
part to play. Only twice has she had a family, some years ago she had
two, and now she has a ewe lamb. I saw her bring this one to the
water. The father was delighted, and thinking he was going to play
the male Swan's role of guard and guide, he swam to meet his family.
He was promptly seized and thoroughly beaten up. Swans apparently
suffer from a social handicap which forbids a chap to thrash his wife,
however badly she behaves. He spent most of the subsequent weeks
standing on the bank. He is now suffered within the family circle,
but is hardly made welcome.
The Black-necked Swans are immature, or rather the female is.
We have three males and one female at present.
Geese. Six Greater Snow goslings were reared from our old Goose,
who must by now be the ancestress of most of the European stock, and
of quite a few of the American. Two Emperor, 4 Ross, 3 Barhead,
4 Redbreast, 8 Magellan, 6 Ashyhead, 10 Ruddyhead were reared.
The Abyssinian Bluewinged let me down. I acquired a completely
unrelated gander from the Severn Wildfowl Trust, and paired him to a
goose who has laid each year till this year. The gander never came
into full breeding condition, and so she did not lay. I am hoping to j
make him madly jealous next year by giving him suitable neighbours.
Sheld-Duck. Nine Radjah were reared, also fifteen Ruddy and about
the same number each of Common and South African. The Red-
billed Pintail laid, but her pre-war mate was beyond breeding age.
We have now got a nice young male bred this year at Slimbridge.

We have been lucky in breeding each year for several years now a
species of waterfowl which either has not been bred previously or has
not been bred for many years as in the case of the Marbled Teal.
This year it was the Philippine Duck, A. luzonica.
The Severn Wildfowl Trust very kindly lent us their pair on
breeding teims. This species was well illustrated in the Avicultural
Magazine for Jan.-Feb., 1952. The male and female are similar
in colour, the body soft greyish stone, the neck and face a bright
rusty buff, top of the head and a broad eye streak are black, bill blue.
It is a handsome species, and in my opinion competes with the Spotbill
for second place in the Mallard beauty competition. The pair here
were very peaceful and I never saw the drake take the slightest notice
of any other species except of Mallard drakes, and to these he objected
very strongly. The drake's call is more drawling than a Mallard's
He chatters very little to his duck or she to him. Her call is very
similar to a wild duck's. The drake's display seems much simplified.
I he only form I have so far seen is what I call the fast-swimming
t * ie ^ellowbill drake, he swims fast either ahead
of his duck or round her; his body is elongated, and the base of his
neck awash, the head erect and jerked backwards and forwards. The
display is probably the same as the Yellowbills, but the above is all
I have seen so far. The duck courts him as does a Mallard female
her drake, but less violently, less often, and with far less chatter
Mating is the same as the Yellowbill. The duck's first nest was made
in some rank grasses, and was a substantial affair, so much so that the
day the first egg was laid, 7th May, I was passing the nest, which
I already knew of, and a man who was nest-hunting nearby said:
There's an egg in that scrape by the stick in the top block." " What
colour is it? " "Greenish." I presumed it was a Red-crested Pochard's,
and did not go to collect it till after lunch, when the egg had vanished.
I put a dummy in the nest and, at a distance of about three feet, com-
pletely encircled it with a narrow band of kreosote. A good way of
protecting a nest from ground vermin. No sniffler will cross the
band. The following morning I looked first thing. The dummy was
there and beside it an egg of the palest eau-de-nil, almost white. The
egg was of normal shape, and between a Shoveler's and a Red-crested
Pochard's in size, but when compared with these it was paler and the
colour very clean, not muddy as are the other two. Dr. Ripley describes
his ducks' eggs as very round. I think all species of duck, tree duck
excepted, tend to lay a normal shaped egg, but individuals vary greatly.
One of my Shovelers lays sausage-shaped eggs, while the other lays
normal ones; both hatch equally well. Ten eggs including the missing
one were laid on consecutive days. Down was very like the Common
rintails. Incubation 25-26 days. The ducklings on hatching were
comica ly like theii parents in design. The body colour was olive,

vaguely showing the Mallard family flank and hip markings, but the
necks and faces were bright yellow plus dark eye streak and cap as in
the adults. In the first plumage the head markings seemed identical
to the adult plumage, but the body plumage lacked the grapelike
bloom of the adult. They grew quickly, and were easily reared.
The old duck made a second nest under a Guelder rose bush. The nest
was again a bulky affair, composed chiefly of sycamore leaves which
had lodged under the bush. She laid seven eggs, and then had some
internal trouble, failed to lay the eighth, and was dead by 10.30 a.m.
We removed this egg from her body, but it was the only egg which
failed to hatch. Fifteen ducklings were reared to maturity.
The little American Ruddy Duck laid well ; her extraordinary
eggs, almost as big as a Sheld-Duck's, were of the same lovely shagreen
texture as the Black Swan's.
Heartbreaking creatures to rear under a hen, because they can
barely walk, and will only feed in water. They won t leave their
mother's flanks, and she would not swim ! However, we eventually
reared four, all females. Next year we hope to do better now we
know what we are in for.
BREEDING NOTES 1952 AT WOBURN
By The Duke of Bedford (Woburn, Beds, England)
The breeding season of 1952 produced, on the whole, rather more
than the average crop of troubles and disappointments. March went
out like a lion after deceptively lamb-like behaviour earlier. As a
result both my hen Princess of Wales Parrakeets got egg-bound. One
died later of another complaint, and the other did not nest a second
time. The eggs, given to Rock Peplars, failed to hatch. Later in the
year I also lost one of my cocks from a mysterious injury.
The hen Crimson-wing of the breeding pair also got badly egg
bound, and I thought I should lose her, but she laid in the end,
although the eggs, given to Green-winged Kings, failed to hatch.
I think I am now well and truly cured of allowing early breeding
with many species of Parrakeets. Even if the hens escape egg-binding,
the fertility of the cocks early in the season is apt to be poor.
I did not put the Crimson-wing back in her breeding aviary again
until mid-May. She laid again and reared four fine youngsters.
My old pair of Rock Peplars reared three young ones and a new pair
consisting of an imported Victorian cock, and an English-bred hen
reared four. Rock Peplars from Victoria are much to be preferred
to those from Western Australia on account of the fine clear yellow
colour of the cocks. I also had a 195 1 coc ^ that had been trained as

a liberty bird, and I used, for a time successfully, in training the
Victorian cock's four offspring. After a few weeks, however, he
disgraced himself by going off, taking the young hen with him. Some
weeks later she returned alone, so presumably he met with an accident.
As a rule young Rock Peplars, properly trained and managed, can be
flown as day-liberty birds with perfect safety for about six weeks,
and great is the enjoyment to be derived from their superb flight.
If allowed out much longer they tend to go wild and eventually are
lost, so that it is necessary to catch them up and confine them until
the cocks have mated, when the presence of their wives in aviaries
should anchor " them for good. Hens are always worse stayers
than cocks, and are better kept in as soon as their sex can be deter-
mined with some degree of probability.
Green-winged Kings, as usual, had two lots of clear eggs. They
seem to be too old to be fertile, although they are most eager to
go to nest.
Browns repeated their disappointing failure of last year, losing
their young for no obvious reason at about io days.
In the spring I had obtained three imported Browns, but they
seemed to have no constitution at all, and got ill again and again
even while still in the heated birdroom. One hen soon died of an
unusual throat ailment. The cock, after about half a dozen illnesses,
swallowed the bristle of a brush which at length finished him. After
that his mate, who had been getting ill even oftener than he, blossomed
out into robust health and breeding condition. Who says there isn't
an X ! ?
Two pairs of English-bred Pileated Parrakeets each hatched their
six eggs, but made a poor job of rearing, only three young surviving
in each case. The old birds plucked their offspring, one pair very
badly, the cock being as serious an offender as his mate.
The hen Barnard would not settle down. She only laid one egg
and did not sit.
The Blue Indian Ringnecks did better, rearing four young. I tried
a year-old cock blue with a lutino hen but, though he displayed,
he was too young to mate and the eggs were infertile. Later the hen
died and a pair of two-year-old lutino-bred greens lost their young,
probably through the hen getting ill.
Gang-gang Cockatoos reared a pair of young, but the hen injured
herself severely the day she left the nest. She is now, however, nearly
well.
Roseate Cockatoos this year were a failure. The old albino hen
mated to her son laid again after an interval of nearly fifteen years,
but the eggs were infertile. Another white-bred cock mated to a
normal grey hen did not breed, although the hen had nested regularly
in previous years. Two young 1951 normal Roseates which I hoped to

establish as liberty birds behaved in a disappointing fashion, although
those that one breeds are normally good stayers. I first released the
young hen. She went out quietly and looked like settling down, but
the following day she removed herself to the Battlesden area, about
three miles away, where she settled down as a wild bird. Her brother,
when first released, stayed well, and after a few weeks I used the
parent cock as a decoy and captured his erring daughter without
difficulty and brought her home. For a short time she stayed well
with her brother, then the pair returned to Battlesden. After some
weeks one returned and spent a few hours at the aviaries, but again
went off in the Battlesden direction, and soon all news of them ceased.
(By a very strange coincidence Pennant's Parrakeets were bred at
liberty at Battlesden in 1871, forty-three years before I bred them at
liberty at Woburn !)
A lutino cock Nyasa Lovebird mated to a green hen did not nest
this year, and pretended to be terribly nervous, although they had
lived in aviaries and wintered in cages for years. Possibly these love-
birds, like budgerigars, nest more readily in colonies.
As the cock I had obtained with much difficulty had died suddenly
during the winter, my two hen Naretha Bluebonnets continued in
unrelieved spinsterhood and, like the widowed hen Browns, in much
more robust health than they had enjoyed when there was a prospect
of getting them mated !
This year I started a new aviary of liberty Budgerigars in Devon-
shire, the foundation stock consisting partly of homing birds from
Woburn and partly of non-homers. They were kept shut into the
aviary until the young of the first round were leaving the nest, and
when released the homers behaved as well in their new locality as
they had done in the old one. The non-homers, as at the beginning
of my experiment at Woburn, either proved " non-exits " and did
not go out at all, or gave a certain amount of trouble by straying.
Of those that strayed and were reported and recaptured with the
aid of a spare cage containing food and another cage with a decoy,
some proved sensible the second time, and some did not go out again.
Budgerigars and other Parrakeets, on finding themselves free, may
go off for different reasons. Some depart because they really want
to go. Others do not really wish to leave, but are puzzled and con-
fused by their unaccustomed freedom, and lose their heads and their
way. Very quickly, however, they learn to manage themselves in the
air and to fly down, and if they can be recaptured may give no more
trouble. The other type are, however, hopeless as liberty birds. Very
young birds only just able to feed themselves will usually " home "
for a time, even to a new aviary if it contains plenty of others of their
species, but their subsequent performance will depend on how they
are bred. Young birds whose eyes and ceres are beginning to change

coloui are at the worst age for release in a strange place. Even homers
that have flown at liberty elsewhere are not to be relied on. If
purchased at this age they must be confined until they have bred and
their young are leaving the nest.
The homing Budgerigars at Woburn started the season very well
but I made two mistakes later that taught a rather unexpected
esson. In previous years I had allowed some birds to continue
breeding until late autumn, although I did not permit any individual
pair to rear more than two broods. This season, however, the
u gengars were staying so well and the aviary was getting so over-
crowded that instead of disposing of surplus stock then, as I should
ave done, I stopped all breeding in the aviary. I also made what
proved to be another mistake. Previously the birds in the libertv
aviary had never all gone out together. Some always remained
inside. One day, however I drove them all out at once, and although
some began to re-enter within a few minutes it was clear that I had
caused a psychological upset. The birds that came in were much
disturbed at finding the aviary empty. " The place didn't feel the
same, and after feeding quickly and nervously they flew about
restlessly like wild birds trapped in an enclosure, and quickly made
their way out again. This and the stopping of all breeding had a
curious and lasting effect on the mentality of all the occupants of the
aviary. They became wild and scary; lost their steadiness and
would no longer feed from millet sprays held in my hand ; were
su ject to panics and stayed in the shelter long after sunrise as they
do when there is a Sparrowhawk about. Young hens did not come
into breeding condition and select nest boxes eight weeks after leaving
e nest themselves, as is usual. They moulted and still showed no
ln nestl &quot;S- ^ n f ly they be S an to stra y, going off in small
parties and--which had never happened before-even some old
breeding birds of both sexes were among those that left. To check
this tendency I introduced, from the hens' resting aviary, three
oming hens I judged to be in breeding condition ; but these also
showed no interest in the nest boxes, and two even went away.
* 1 *, * k r Pt the blrds shut Up entire 'y for about a fortnight
introducing four more homing hens from the resting aviary. That did
the trick. After a few days these hens selected mates anti nest-boxes
iheir example infected all the young hens of different ages, and they
too rushed into breeding condition. The temperament of all the
birds m the aviary likewise changed ; their tameness returned ; and
when they were again released there was no more straying, even among
unmated birds. 5
It is clear, therefore, that the attraction which " anchors " homing
u gengars to their aviary is its significance to them as a breeding
P ace. This must on no account be upset except of course during

the winter, when the short days and absence of wild foods reduce the
temptation to stray to a minimum. Next year I intend to arrange
two breeding " shifts Towards the end of February I shall introduce
about eight fully adult hens, leaving them to select their partners from
the considerably larger number of cocks occupying the aviary. At the
end of June, when they have reared their second broods, I shall put
them and, for a few days, their mates also in the resting aviary,
providing another eight hens for the cocks that have not yet bred.
I shall have the first catch-up of surplus young birds about the same
time, and may confine the whole flock for some days to allow the
new adult hens to choose their nests and mates and the young hens to
profit by the good example set them ! Past experience has shown
that it does a hen no harm whatever to allow her to have one nest as
soon as she wants to, provided she lays before ist September. Her
young may not always grow into large birds, but there is rarely much
wrong with them either. Cocks that have bred early in the season
I shall return to the liberty aviary as soon as the second lot of adult
hens have mated. They can then moult and rest and, as the aviary
will still have a " breeding atmosphere," they are not likely to stray.
Experience has again shown that whereas a " breeding atmosphere "
is a vital factor, it is not necessary for every cock in the aviary to be
mated to keep him at home.
For waterfowl the season has been the worst I ever remember.
Never before have vermin been so active in destroying eggs, young,
and sitting birds, and never before, among the geese, have so few
pairs gone to nest or so many eggs proved infertile--under conditions
identical with those which in previous years have produced quite
good results. The only geese reared have been one Emperor, one
Red-breasted, and one Magellan, and the only ducks (apart from
wild Mandarins), about two dozen Carolina.

The news of the death of Madame Jeanne Derscheid which occurred
at a few minutes past midnight on the night of 2nd-grd January 1953
will be received with the greatest sorrow by her many friends 'in the
Avicultural Society. The British and Americans have particular cause
to be grateful to Madame Derscheid, her husband, and their family
for the great part they took in the Escape Service which achieved the
safety of many British and American airmen during the last world war *
a service for which Dr. Jean-Marie Derscheid gave his life. On two
occasions Madame Derscheid was imprisoned as a hostage on account
of her husband s activities and was decorated for her own services with
the Medaille de Prisonniere Politique , Medaille de la Comunne , and Medaille
departicipation aux oeuvres de Guerre. In 1948 Madame Derscheid received
from Field-Marshal Montgomery the late King George Vi's Commen-
dation for Brave Conduct which His Majesty had commanded she
should receive personally on behalf of her husband in recognition of
special services he rendered to the Allied cause during the war and
which proved of particular value to Great Britain. Madame Derscheid
was also presented with a similar Certificate by the U.S. Ambassador
in Belgium expressing the gratitude and appreciation of the American
people for the gallant service performed by her husband in assisting
the escape of Allied soldiers from the enemy.
Madame Derscheid shared her husband's interest in birds and
aviculture and actively assisted with the famous collection at Armendy
before the war, particularly in the rearing of rare ducks. In 1929 and
1930 she accompanied Dr. Derscheid to the Belgian Congo, when he
led a scientific expedition to Kivu and the regions of the Albert
National Park.
After the war Madame Derscheid made many visits to England and
was on three occasions the guest of honour at dinners of the British
Aviculturists' Club. Though assured of a warm welcome as the wife of
a great aviculturist she earned a special place for herself in the
affections of everyone who met her by her gentle charm, natural
friendliness, and spontaneous gaiety. Madame Derscheid took a great
interest in all the affairs of the Avicultural Society and was instru-
mental in procuring numbers of new members in Belgium ; she also
organized the Belgian participation in the most successful Anglo-
Belgian-French week-end meeting of aviculturists which was held at
Cleres in May, 1950.
Her premature death after a severe illness which she bore with
outstanding courage is yet another tragic loss to her son, Jean-Pierre
Derscheid, and the deepest sympathy is offered to him and his grand-
mother, Madame Gustav Derscheid, in their great sorrow. P. B-S.

By Edward J. Boosey (Keston, Kent, England)
During last year (1952) we received a few welcome and rarely-
imported birds at the Keston Foreign Bird Farm.
The first to arrive was a pure lutino Plumhead Parrakeet ;
then came two pairs of Lilac-crowned Fruit Pigeons (Ptilinopus coronu-
latus), and half a dozen Citron-crested Cockatoos ( Cacatua citrino-
cristata ), followed by six Layard's Parrakeets ( Psittacula calthorpa), and
finally, three pairs of the Cuban or White-fronted Amazon Parrots
(.Amazona leucocephala ).
Layard's Parrakeet is very rarely imported indeed, probably because
of its restricted range, as it is entirely confined to the Island of Ceylon,
and does not extend to any part of the Indian mainland. The six we
have are young birds of the year, and were very kindly presented to us
by Major Weinman of the Colombo Zoo, who, with his wife and
son, paid a visit to our farm about a year ago, and we are most
grateful to him for this welcome gift.
To take the first arrival first : The lutino Plumhead was an
immature and rather delicate-looking specimen, and twice it nearly
died. At first it shared an aviary with an ordinary green hen, and
both were given sweetened bread and milk and millet spray, as well
as apple and the ordinary seed mixture. At first they ignored the
latter, having been sent over on nothing but small brown Indian
millet. Later on, however, both (as we supposed at the time) started
to eat the normal seed mixture, and the daily amount of bread and
milk and millet spray was gradually reduced, although a plentiful
daily supply of apple was still maintained. The lutino, however,
showed increasing signs of weakness, and it was only just in time that
we discovered that it was the hen alone who had taken to the normal
seed mixture. After that the lutino was put in an aviary by itself
and given plenty of bread and milk, apple, and millet spray. Even
so, however, it did not really seem to flourish and eventually got a
bad chill and had to be put in the hospital. It was very weak, and
I had not much hope of saving it ; nevertheless, it finally pulled
round, and the fact that it is alive and very flourishing to-day is really
due to the fact that I happened to put it to share an aviary with a
heated shelter with a pair of the Fruit Pigeons. The latter's staple diet
consists of boiled maize and rice sweetened with Nestle's milk, and
having sampled these the Plumhead decided at once that they were
the ideal diet for a delicate Parrakeet, in which apparently it was right,
for it has never once looked back since it started eating them. After
the autumn moult it assumed full adult plumage with the typical long
tapering tail of a Plumhead, and is now very handsome with a bright
golden-yellow body and flesh-pink head.

The two pairs of Lilac-crowned Fruit Pigeons (which, incidentally,
weie sold as Jambu Fruit-Pigeons and not as Lilac-crowns) were
sent to us by air from Singapore, and arrived in quite good condition,
in spite of the fact that they had been given nothing but ordinary
uncooked maize to eat on the journey. They seem even more quarrel-
some than ordinary doves and pigeons and one of the hens bullied
the other so badly that the pairs had to be separated with all speed
Nor did they hesitate to attack the Plumhead Parrakeet when it
was hrst put m an aviary with them, buffeting it with their wings if
it ventured anywhere near them. Now, however, the three have
formed one of those improbable bird friendships, and it is a curious
sight to see the two Fruit Pigeons and the Parrakeet sitting side by
side on a perch, so close together as to be actually touching--all their
former enmity forgotten !
The Fruit Pigeons are very beautiful, a rough description of them
eing that they are green, with a wide diffused orange band across the
breast, m the centre of this band being a patch of pale violet. The
feathers of the neck and crop are grey with a greenish tinge and are
rather stiff and pointed, like the feathers of a cock's hackle, and the
crown of the head is a very lovely rosy-lilac colour narrowly bordered
with yellow. They inhabit the Aru Islands and New Guinea, and
are quite small. 5
Some species of Fruit Pigeons--and I rather think this one among
them have been given the reputation of being hardy if shut into a
cosy shelter on winter nights, but although this may be the case
once they are thoroughly acclimatized, they certainly need heat
during their first winter in this country. Ours arrived about the end
of August, and I was able to put them in outdoor aviaries as soon as
they had recovered from the journey. Directly the weather became
at all cold, however, it was obvious that they would have to be given
heat, but although we have had some quite sharp frosts of late, one
P ai f are s * far dom S v ery well in an aviary with a lamp in the
shelter This pair is the better of the two, and with the other pair
we had a stroke of bad luck, as the cock got a chill as soon as the
weather started to turn cold. He was put in a hospital cage, and was
recovering when the heat supply failed during the night, and he was
ound dead m the morning, so we now have a pair and an odd hen,
and I Shall keep the latter and hope to breed a mate for her next
summer. This, incidentally, would not be a first breeding, as Captain
Stokes successfully bred Lilac-crowns on more than one occasion
some years ago and found that, like the Ruddy Quail Dove and
Bleeding-heart Pigeon (both of which we bred at Keston before the
war) the young leave the nest at a very tender age.
Judging by our Lilac-crowns, Fruit Pigeons differ in several respects
rom t e grain-eating species : they fly quickly but less gracefully

than the latter ; the under-surface of their feet is flatter and they
have a tenacious and rather reptilian way of gripping one's finger
or a perch, which doubtless enables them to clamber swiftly about
among the branches of the trees on the fruits of which they feed ;
also they seem very silent birds, and I have never heard ours utter
more than an occasional low murmuring sound, though they may
become more vocal in the spring.
They have proved unexpectedly easy to cater for in the matter of
food, and ours have come into excellent condition on a diet consisting
solely of boiled kibbled maize and rice sweetened with Nestle's milk
and then drained, with cored, peeled, ripe sweet chopped-up apple
added each day before it is given. This diet has the added advantage
of keeping their faces as clean as possible, whereas I find that if
they are given mushy fruits such as plums and bananas they get
themselves in a fearful mess.
I had somehow never thought of Citron-crested Cockatoos as
particularly attractive, but the six that arrived here by air and in
excellent condition quickly made me change my opinion of them,
and I think that with their lovely combination of orange, palest
lemon-yellow, and snow-white, they closely rival Leadbeater's for
beauty. The general body-colour is white, with the under surface of
the tail and a patch on the cheeks pale yellow. The crest, which is
very large, particularly in the male, who can spread it almost as far
forward as a Leadbeater's, is bright orange.
Many birds are stupidly named--this one being a good example
and I cannot imagine why, when a bird with a crest the colour of a
ripe lemon was aptly named the Lemon-crested, or Sulphur-crested
Cockatoo another bird with a crest the colour of a ripe orange should
not have been named, with equal aptness, the Orange-crested
Cockatoo--and it is only fair to add that the inhabitants of its native
land have apparently had the sense to call it this ! as we were offered
them not as Citron-crested but as Orange-crested Cockatoos.
Their one disadvantage is their extreme shyness. The cock of our
pair is even shyer than the hen, who does very occasionally venture out
into the open part of the run if she thinks there is nobody about.
Another peculiarity--and one that would be a great advantage if one
of these Cockatoos was kept as a pet in a room--is that they are an
extremely silent member of an extremely noisy family, and I cannot
recall having heard either of ours utter a sound of any kind, except
when they were being caught to be transferred to their present aviary.
The Layard's are charming little birds and quite tame and steady.
They are about the size of a Plumhead, but their tails, instead of
being long and tapering, are quite short. The six Major Weinman has
given us are as yet in immature plumage and are predominantly
green, brighter on the head, and brightest just below the blackish

neck-ring which is just starting to appear in some of them. The two
central tail feathers are fairly dark blue tipped with greenish-yellow
and the rump is lilac-blue. Four of them have red^ beaks, and the
blaCk * neS ' S * lo * ks as thou S h we have two pairs and two
odd birds. I am not, however, certain of this particularly because one
o those with red beaks has to my mind an unmistakably feminine look
about it, and its beak rather looks as though it may be in the process
of turning black. I am not certain about the colour changes of the
beak in young Layard's, but in their relative, the Malabar Parrakeet
young males have the curious, and I should think unique, habit of
starting with a red beak which later turns black, and later still turns
red again ! Young females, on the other hand, merely start with a red
beak which later turns black.
Adult Layard s are most attractively coloured, having the head
lavender-blue and the mantle the same colour shot with grey. The
young Layard s have settled down well in an aviary facing south with
a heated sheiter in which they are shut each night. Like the lutino
Plumhead, they all eat bread soaked in sweetened watered milk
and are very fond of boiled sweetened maize and rice, all of which
should prove valuable additional rearing foods if we are successful in
breeding them.
The last birds to arrive were the three pairs of Cuban Amazons--
the first we have ever been offered since we started the farm. I have
always thought them one of the loveliest members of the family, as the
deep rose-pink of the cheeks and throat goes so beautifully with their
mam body-colour of green and the feathers of the head, neck
and forepart of the body strikingly bordered with black. The crown
is white, and there is a considerable amount of purplish vinous-
colour on the lower breast and abdomen. The beak is very pale
almost white. They are considerably smaller and slimmer than
Blue-fronts, and seem fairly easy to sex, as the hens have smaller,
rounder heads and the rose-pink area in their plumage is rather
less extensive and not so well-defined.
The three pairs we have are in an outdoor aviary with a heated
shelter, and have not yet been let out into the flight, as I think they are
far better off inside so long as this arctic weather, which this year has
come so unseasonably early, persists--which I sincerely hope it will
not do for long, as we usually get quite enough of it in the first three
months of the year.

By Kenton C. Lint (San Diego, Calif., U.S.A.)
The Andean Condor, Vultur gryphus Linne, is an inhabitant of the
mountain chain of the Andes. It is found principally in the Peruvian
and Chilean Andes, but it also ranges as far north as Bogota, and
south to the mouth of the Rio Nigro on the east coast of Patagonia.
According to the early observers, it was described as frequenting the
loftiest peaks of the Cordilleras, but later writers deny this, and say
it rarely ascends above 16,000 feet, while the normal range is the zone
lying between 9,000 and 15,000 feet.
The Andean Condor is not only the largest of the birds of prey, but
the largest land bird of flight. Over a period of ten years, 1942-1952,
the Zoological Society of San Diego has hatched eight Condor babies
and reared seven Condor chicks to maturity. All seven birds are
living and on exhibition in Zoological Gardens in the United States.
The first Andean Condor raised in captivity in the United States
was hatched 8th July, 1942, in the Zoological Gardens of San Diego,
in our large flying cage. The first baby proved to be a male, and was
sold to the Washington D.C. Zoo, where it is still on exhibition.
Again, on 8th June, 1945, the second Andean Condor baby was
hatched and raised, another male bird.
On 21 st June, 1947, our breeding pair of Condors hatched their
third chick. We were a little disappointed, as this baby was also
a male. We removed this bird from the old pair just before nesting
time, to see if they would nest in consecutive years.
This strategy did work, and on 20th May, 1948, the fourth baby
Condor was hatched, breaking the old precedent that Condors only
raise every other year. This baby, our first female chick, was removed
from the parent birds when four weeks old, and raised to maturity
by hand feeding. Weights and feather growth were recorded weekly,
and much was learned in rearing this young bird. The difficulties
in the way of field studies would make it impossible to acquire the same
knowledge in the wild. We fed one half pound of finely ground liver
twice a day, and one half pound of finely ground horse meat twice
daily.
On 7th June, 1949, the fifth Condor was hatched, a male, and
raised to maturity by the parent birds.
Experimenting in hatching Condor eggs in an electric incubator,
we hatched the sixth chick 31st May, 1950. This baby, a female chick,
lived seven days. Our breeding pair laid a second egg which hatched
10th July, 1950, also a female chick, which they raised to maturity.

fully hatched, this one in an incubator. It was raised to maturity by
hand feeding. This male chick weighed six ounces at the time of
hatching. Shipped to Liberty Park, Salt Lake City, Utah, at the age
of eleven months, the bird weighed 34 pounds. This bird was fed
on tenderized food from the time of hatching, without the use of
regurgitation as used by the parent birds. To our knowledge this has
not been done before successfully in captivity.

By G. de Goederen (Amsterdam, Holland)
In the zoological park Dierenpark " Wassenaar " a new large bird-
house is being built and will be the home of the zoo's interesting
collection of birds, about which I had the honour to inform our
members in the Avicultural Magazine of July-August, 1951.
The birdhouse, which will be opened in spring of 1953, is a large
glass construction measuring over 400 feet in length with a width of
over 60 feet and a maximum height of 21 feet. The President of the
Society, Mr. P. W. Louwman, was kind enough to give me a rough
outline of the plans of the internal construction of this large building.
From what I saw of the great aviaries which are now under con-
struction in the building, I expect that when everything is completed
this birdhouse will be not only the most beautiful but will also guarantee
the most appropriate housing for the bird collection of this zoo.

Over ioo enclosures of varying size are expected to be filled with a
considerable variety of rare birds, such as : Quetzals, Cock of the
Rock, Birds of Paradise, Greater Hornbills, Toucans, Crowned
Pigeons, a considerable number of Parrakeets and Lorikeets, and an
abundance of other birds.
The aim is to give the spectator a view of the birds in natural
surroundings, but in this the management has given more attention to
the actual biological needs of the birds than to purely ornamental
adornments, which are so often advertised as natural surroundings,
but which are very often only very poor imitations and generally do not
fulfil the most elementary demands of practical birdkeeping.
From what I saw I am quite sure that the Louise Hall (named in
honour of the late Mrs. L. Louwman-de Brey, mother of the President)
will be an achievement, which will be greeted with enthusiasm by all
aviculturists and which no doubt will attract much attention.

A. GENERAL.
Both species are only being mentioned as a kind of appendix as
I do not know them nearly well enough. Both, through the lack of
a social play and through their highly specialized method of pair
formation, which in M. sibilatrix is quite reminiscent of that of the
Anserinae, stand out sharply from the pattern of the rest of the surface-
feeding ducks. The following facts are important taxonomic char-
acteristics which separate both species sharply from other Anatinae :
(1) the almost uniform colour of the plumage of the female M. penelope
which completely lacks the lengthwise marking so widely prevalent on
the flight feathers ; (2) the dark chestnut-brown summer plumage of

of a true triumph-cry, whose function is quite similar to that ol the
triumph-cry of the Anserinae and Casarcinae. Therefore I rather suspect

XVIII. MAREGA SIBILATRIX X ANAS PLATYRHYNCHOS
A. GENERAL.
Although I have hitherto omitted from my discussion the many
hybrid ducks that I have already studied and whose behaviour-
inventory I might easily have given, I cannot help touching briefly
upon the hybrids named above, which I received through Professor
Heck's kindness from the Berlin Zoological Gardens, where a u -
winged wild Mallard duck has lived for years, mated to a sibilatrix
drake. Physically the birds were pretty well intermediate between
the parent species, although the male had much less of the Mallard
drake's colouring than the hybrids Poll (1910) had pictured. Above
all he had little green on his head, distributed just as in the Chiloe

Wigeon. The two birds were paired, laid, and brooded sterile eees
every year and flew around freely for years, until the duck flew away
in the winter of 1939-40, while the drake, who had survived this bad
time, became frightened by my catching the other ducks before my
move to Konigsberg and stayed away.
B. THE NON-SEXUAL REACTIONS AND NOTES.
These were exactly like those of the Mallard. The drake had
both the one- and the two-syllabled call of the Mallard drake, except
that his voice was softer and hoarser.
C. THE SEXUAL REACTIONS AND NOTES OF THE FEMALE.
Inciting.
This cannot be described more briefly than with the assertion that
it was like that of neither the one nor the other parent species, but
resembled even to the smallest detail that of the Gadwall. The
tendency, inherited from M. sibilatrix , to break into chin-raisim? at
every sexual excitement was combined with the urge to perform the
inciting act over the shoulder, which the duck had inherited from her
mother, with the result that between every two chin-raisings there came
an inciting movement backwards over the shoulder. As the drake
hfted Ins chin at the same time as the duck, there arose a ceremonv
which was not very different from that of the Gadwall.
The Decrescendo Call.
This was hoarser and broken off shorter than in the Mallard
A nod-swimming was lacking.
The Prelude to Mating.
This corresponded to that of the Mallard. However, sometimes
nstead of this both birds carried out the intention-behaviour of
diving away before treading, just like the beginning of play-diving
efore midday bathing. Unfortunately I do not know whether this
diving-away occurs as a prelude to mating in Mareca. Heinroth has
described something corresponding to this in Tadorna.
D. THE SEXUAL REACTIONS AND CALLS OF THE DRAKE.

This was marked by the omission of nod-swimming, that is to say,
the drake, after treading, rose slightly in a manner suggestive of the
" bridling " movement and then swam around the duck very leisurely
without nodding, but paying much attention to her and keeping the
back of his head exactly toward her.

<bodyText confidence="0.960531125" page_id="58090771"  page_num="Page 28" year="" vol="">
Lampronessa sponsa (L)
A. GENERAL.
Here we come to a group which some experts class with the true
surface-feeding ducks and others with the Cairininae. As a matter ol
fact this quite independent sub-family, which consists of only two
o-enera, Lampronessa and Aix, is almost midway between the two.
Characters which they have in common with the Cairininae are the
following : (a) Certain markings in the ducklings ; {b) certain physical
characteristics resulting from their living on trees and nesting in
holes, such as the very long thigh and, therefore, legs that seem to be
very far forward on the body ; and also the long broad tail ; (r) certain
undoubtedly primitive characters in their behaviour. The true
Cairininae, together with the Carolina and Mandarin ducks, are the
only Anatidae which make aiming head movements before flying up,
quite like those of birds of prey, pigeons, and innumerable other
orders, but quite unlike the pre-flight movements of all other Anatidae.
A further point the genera Aix, Lampronessa, and other Cairininae
have in common is that the nystagmic nodding of the head, which
occurs when the bird is walking does not take place with every step,
as in almost all other birds, but in a most unusual and striking manner
at every second step ; thus, the head always goes forward at the same
time as the one leg, which almost gives the impression that the bird is
limping. Without doubt the genus Cairinina is unusually rich in primitive
characteristics, a thing which Heinroth, Delacour, and Boetticher
</bodyText>
<bodyText confidence="0.989561475" page_id="58090772"  page_num="Page 29" year="" vol="">
DR. KONRAD LORENZ--STUDIES ON THE BEHAVIOUR OF ANATINAS 29
have already pointed out. The black-white marking of the plumage
and the baie face-mask remind one of Anseranas. The completely
reptilian rape of the female, and the complete lack of pairing can also
be regarded as primitive characteristics. Now although Aix and
Lampronessa are undoubtedly highly differentiated forms, very nearly
related to true surface-feeding ducks, I prefer to class them funda-
mentally with the Gairininaein agreement with Delacour and Boetticher.
This group, in spite of its clear relationship to forms rich in primitive
characters, contains some very highly differentiated forms, analogous,
for example, to the Herpestoidae in the Carnivora, in which forms
like Mungos and Crossarchus exhibit a truly insectivore-like primitive-
ness, while otheis in their specialization almost intergrade with the
completely separate higher group of Felidae, such as the Civet Cat
Vlverra &amp;gt; the Palm Civet Parodoxurus , or even the Fossa Cryptoprocta
ferox.
The Carolina Duck's reactions were exhaustively described by
Heinroth in 1910. We shall only give them briefly for the sake of
comparison.
B. THE NON-SEXUAL REACTIONS AND NOTES.
Except with very small ducklings the two-syllabled conversation
call of the Anatinae is lacking. In the whistle of desertion the one-
syllabled " piep " call does not sound at the same intervals as in the
Anatinae but, especially at moments of high intensity, in couplets,
but not so close that they sound like two syllables. We have already
spoken of the intention-behaviour for flying away which is distinctive
for the whole group. The duck's " go-away " call, which is heard
especially when she is looking for the nest, is a soft rapid " tetetetetet ".
thC drake in the corr esponding mood is a delicate
^ jibjibjibjib ". As a conversation note the drake utters a short
ji-ib ", accented on the second syllable, which one hears especially
when he is paying " polite " attention to the duck. The call-note
of the drake is a drawn-out " ji-ihb " ; the duck's call-note is a more
raucous ku-ack ". While the calls noted are analogous in significance
to what may also be homologous utterances of many Anatinae, the
warning call of the female is a peculiarly short " Huick ". As in the
Anatinae, the drake's warning call corresponds to the call-note. While
these two calls of the Anatinae cannot be distinguished, the drake
Carolina's warning call is very clearly recognized by its cut-off
brevity.

makes caressing movements with her bill towards the drake, especially
towards his breast. Mandarin ducks do this in the same manner. On
the other hand, the female Brazilian Teal, Amazonetta brasiliensis , has
a very peculiar inciting behaviour which may perhaps be regarded as
derived from the one just described. She first threatens the enemy
with her neck stretched forward, with her upper mandible raised and
her bill open, then turns her head towards her male and performs
the typical inciting movement, accompanied by a rasping note,, in
his direction. Between the inciting movements the female Carolina
often moves her head as if aiming which, as in the Carininae, has the
significance of a very general excitement gesture.

This is not a very loud sound. It is difficult to represent in letters

nod-swimming of the Mallard and Chestnut-breasted Teal, i.e. to
stir the drake up to the courtship display.

</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.997262954545454" page_id="58090773"  page_num="Page 30" year="" vol="">
This is a peculiarly loud " u-ih " corresponding to a long drawn-
out and gradually dying call-note. It sounds peculiarly like an owl.
No one who did not know it would ever ascribe it to a duck. It is
heard especially towards evening and when Wood Ducks fly m over
decoys. As lonely ducks are very prone to utter it, it doubtlessly
has the additional significance of a decrescendo call. I did not,
however, at the time of the first publication of this paper, believe that
this note was phylogenetically comparable to the decrescendo ca
of the Anatinae proper. Better knowledge, acquired but lately at the
Severn Wildfowl Trust, has made me change that opinion : the
female of the Maned Goose Chenonetta jubata, has a decrescendo call
which, while quite indubitably homologous to that of the Anatinae,
at the same time is so similar to the " owl-note " of the female Carolina
that it represents an exact intermedium between both. Chenonetta
is, in spite of its goose-like bill, a close relation of Lampronessa and Aix,
but in some details of its courtship it shows a closer resemblance to the
Anatinae than both of them do. Thus it is not so astonishing that its
decrescendo call forms a connecting link between that of Lampronessa
and that of Anatinae. An interesting difference lies in the fact that the
" owl-note " of the female Carolina also denotes the duck's intention
of flying away herself which the common decrescendo call of surface
feeding ducks certainly does not.

On his part the drake shows his intention to mate by repeated drinking

The drake Carolina woos one particular female more than any
male of the Anatinas that I know. While the courtship of the Gad wall
and Wigeon, with their threatening and annoying of other pairs
reminds one of the courtship of the Anserine and Casarcin&lt;e, the display
of Lampronessa reminds one very much of the display of pheasants
in which the male continually reveals his striking plumage differentia-
tion before the female. There is not the least tendency of the drakes
to unite in a social display, which is all the more interesting and
striking because this minimum of social play in Lampronessa is in direct
contrast to a maximum of social play on the part of the closely related
AiX; The number of different, though for the most part not highly
differentiated, behaviour patterns in the drake Carolina is striking,
remaps this is a primitive condition.

This occurs not very often and only in one particular situation.
I hat is, when the drake, while in a state of&quot; lazy " restfulness and of
low motivation" concerning courtship activities, finds himself
suddenly confronted by his female. The rising of &quot; courtship mood "
finds its expression in a repeated shaking of the head exactly similar to
e initial shake of Anatinae. Very frequently it is combined with
3. Mock-Preening.
This regularly follows drinking, especially at a high reaction-
intensity. As with Aix it never occurs without the preceding drinking.
However, in Lampronessa , in contrast to Aix, there is drinking in
moments of lesser intensity but this is not followed by mock-preening
In mock-preening the drake Carolina reaches deep behind his wing
As rapid as the movement is I have a clear impression that he touches
and moves one particular feather on the underside of the wing, which
Heinroth calls the " brass-feather Because of their extraordinarily
short time of reaction birds have a great number of optically-effective
releasers whose exposure is too brief for human observation. One

This is rather rare in the drake Carolina. It is doubtless homo-
logons to that of the Anatime and the Mandarin drake. The accom-
panying sound, a whistling-sneezing " P f 11 " sounds very differed
from the long drawn-out " P f r r r u i i b " of the Mandarin. The
movement of the hood, which is seen
particularly in this movement, is the
same in both species. The edge of the
" disk set ", already mentioned, pro-
trudes sharply, while the feathers of the
back of the head, which are partly white
and elongated, form a long veil, giving
the bird its German name (bride duck)
(Fig. 46).

effective visually because of
white lines on the edge of
the forehead and through the
lengthening of the feathers.

This is homologous to that of the
Anatinac only because it has certainly
arisen from a drinking through mimic-
exaggeration. After the bill has been
briefly tipped downward it is thrust up
almost to a vertical position, during which the drake utters a short
whistle. A loose connection between this act and that of chm-lifting
shows that both have probably the same origin.
6. Chin-Lifting.
Chin-lifting itself is connected with the turning of the back of
the head (Fig. 47) just as it is m the solicitous Mallard drake. Wi
the drake Carolina, too, the plumage on the back of the head is ai
flat so that the surface turned to the duck shines, not like the Pintail
and the Gadwall drakes, or in the Mallard's second turning, where it
is striking because of its lustreless black. Something else happens with
the drake Carolina's head feathers, in that the hood is not only depresse
tightly against the neck, but at the same time it is spread to the side
so that the surface turned toward the female is considerably widened
and appears shiny green edged with white (Fig. 47 )- This turning
of the back of the head is one of the most frequent of the drake s
display acts, and in it the drake is almost constantly showing solicitude
for his duck. At the same time, a second plumage differentiation comes
into play. The drake, swimming before his duck, turning the back o
his head to her and constantly uttering the short j 11 b . . . j 11
i i i b ", turns his tail sideways toward her. The tail is held
high so that the deep purple-violet side, with the orange-red plumes
in the shape of a sickle hanging to it, is also turned to the due ,

is the spread-out back of the hood (Fig. 47). With the drake Carolina
e\ er\ little detail of a plumage so rich in special differentiations
is used, so to speak, in a special ceremony effective optically as a
" visual adaptation " in the Siiffert sense, or " releaser " in the
Loienz sense. As the drake cannot turn his tail at right angles while
he is tui ning the back ol his head and showing the side of his tail,
he swims in front of the duck quite obliquely " from the shoulder "

<bodyText confidence="0.86174" page_id="58090776"  page_num="Page 33" year="" vol="">
I purposely do not designate this action as a grunt-whistle because
1 believe it is homologous to that only in so far as both arise from the
introductory shaking. On the other hand this very behaviour of the
drake Carolina, because it is far nearer the original form of shaking
t an is the grunt-whistle of the Anatinae, is to me the most convincing
evidence of the correctness of our view concerning the phylogenetic
derivation of the latter. In the Carolina, even the completely
autochthonous, mechanically effective shaking begins with a lowering
ot the head almost to the breast, so that the upward thrust which
lollows reminds one of the grunt-whistle movement of the Anatime
just like the " display-shaking " of the male Tadorna tadorna. The
whistle-shaking " of the drake Carolina compared to the " true "
shaking of the duck is only slightly, although noticeably, mimic-
"WTOd, but in combination with the linkage to an introductory
shaking, the fact that the drake utters a whistle exactly at the right
place makes up a continuous chain of evidence for the theory that the

whistle-shaking of the drake Carolina is comparatively rare.
8. Male Inciting.
The drake Carolina is the only male among the Anatinae I know
that has a symbolic threatening behaviour completely like the inciting
behaviour of the female. Especially when he is being incited by the
duck, and clearly as an answer to her the drake thrusts his head over his
shoulder sideways as though threatening an " enemy . At each
thrust he utters a soft " dih
q. The Combat of the Drakes.
This is marked by the fact that the bill is not used as a weapon
of attack. Drakes shoot like a flash over the water beside each other
and hit with the shoulders of the wings without ever seizing the ot er
with the bill. In Lampronessa this shooting ahead has become
" ritualized " as an independent form of display. The drakes often
shoot up to the duck they are courting in the same way, or shoot
back to her after chasing off another drake. Even old females carry
out this behaviour for their drake. Then both birds shoot along beside
each other like fighting drakes but the next moment the ceremony
changes into the turning of the back of the head and expressions of
good will.

A male and two females of this species were presented to the Trust
by Mr. Herbert Shipman, of Hawaii. Both females laid in 1951, but
owing to the late arrival of the male, the eggs were infertile. The 1952
season has proved more successful.
The hist egg was laid on 18th February and four clutches were
completed, totalling 19 eggs. Fourteen were set under Silkie x
Buff-Rock hens, 9 of which were fertile and duly hatched. The
incubation period varied from 29 to 31 days. The last clutch of five
eggs was left under the parent goose, and although she did not desert,
incubation must have been faulty. On the 28th day the eggs were
found to be cold and subsequent examination proved that three
fertile eggs had ceased to develop at an early stage.
An inch of snow covered the sitting boxes when the first goslings
hatched and for four days they were kept in a warm brooder. Although
three were very weak, all nine survived and are now fine healthy
birds.
In addition to grazing, the birds fed well on a mash consisting of
biscuit, fresh egg, and dried milk. Both watercress and milk thistle
were supplied, the former being eaten in large quantities.

A paii of these biids laid one infertile egg in 1950 and commenced
nesting in 1951, but were driven from their territory by a Grey Lae-
Goose.
In 1952 nest building started during the second week in January
and in all, three nests were constructed. Both birds built, the male
playing the greater part. The first egg was laid on 16th March and
the clutch of four completed by the 21st. The female was at first
allowed to incubate and during this period one egg disappeared.
Meanwhile the male was particularly aggressive to other occupants
of the pond and it was decided to remove the remaining three eggs
which were transferred to a broody Silkie. One of these proved to be
infertile and one addled, while the third hatched successfully on the
35th day.
The downy pattern of the young bird superficially resembled that
of a Sheld-Duck, but with the characteristic head markings of a Tree
duckling.
After fourteen days the " cygnet's " legs appeared to be under-
developed and rachitic, and a course of calcium lactate and para-
thyroid extract was administered. The bird duly recovered and
feathering was complete in three months.
Apart from the usual duckling mash, plenty of duckweed was
&amp;gt;upplied, together with a daily helping of dried ants' eggs.

By G. af Enehjelm (Helsingfors, Finland)
I recently obtained a fine pair of Hawk-headed Parrots, but un-
fortunately lost the male--I believe. It was a great pity as I had hoped
to try my hand at breeding them later on. I also received nine Quakei
Parrakeets, apparently a very small subspecies, which I shall try to
breed in the pheasantry next year. . ,
Other new arrivals are a pair of Rock Pebblers, two pairs of Red-
faced Lovebirds, an imported Bourke cock (I now have two pairs),
five Bichenow Finches, and a pair of Quail Finches.
It has really been a very poor breeding season. About twenty
Fischer's and three Peach-faced Lovebirds bred in the pheasantry.
Abyssinians were sitting on two eggs on ist December, but as it was
very cold I had to take them inside.
For some reason it has been a Zebra Finch year. I have never been
so successful with them. I have bred many normals, whites, fawns, and
cinnamons. The only ones which refused were two pairs of a new
mutation, with pure white underside, and without zebra markings.
Last year I had a pair from Raymaekers and got two youngsters (a
pair) from them, and of the same colour. This year neither pair did
anything. A cock paired to a white hen gave me three cocks, normal-
coloured. I bred lots of Indian Silverbills, and about ten Modest
Finches (Plumheads) ; also some Cordon Bleus and Avadavats.
I have a very reliable strain of Painted Quail, and reared seven
young from two pairs. I have not bred any birds of prey this year.
As to parrot records, one of my friends in Denmark, H. Carlsson,
bred one Abyssinian Lovebird : and with another friend, W. Lang-
berg, one of the most experienced aviculturists in Denmark, a pair o
Red-faced laid three eggs in a Budgerigar box and sat for some time
--one egg was fertile. The pair was kept in a box-cage 30 inches by
15 inches by 20 inches in his birdroom.

Dr Konrad Lorenz's work on animal behaviour is well known and
his book, King Solomon&amp;apos;s Ring , is one that everyone interested in natural
history will wish to possess. It is an account of his observations,
adventures, and experiments with his many animal companions, both
pets and in the wild, at his home at Altenberg, near Vienna, and
contains much information on animal psychology of great value, his
observations on birds being of particular interest. In the chapter
" Pitying animals " Dr. Lorenz stresses that sympathy for animals in
captivity is in most cases entirely wasted but some aviculturists may
not agree with his contention that Parrots and Cockatoos are unhappy
prisoners in cages. . , r T
The book is written with that inimitable humour typical of Lorenz,
which has in no way been lost by the translation, and is a delight to
read. The many pen-and-ink sketches by the author with which the
text is interspersed add greatly to its charm. Q
ENJOYING THE COUNTRY. By E. Fitch Daglish. Messrs.
Faber and Faber, London, 1952. Price 18 s. net.
Mr. Fitch Daglish opens his book with a chapter on the best means
of enioying the countryside and what to do and what not to do to get
the fullest enjoyment. He then takes his readers through the seasons
of the year, giving much information and telling them m a clear and
interesting manner what they should look for. As he says m his first
chapter, in nature's year it is difficult to know where to start as
January brings no significant change in the lives of our wild animals
or plants. He comes to the conclusion that it seems rational to think
of nature's year, like the farming year, as beginning with autumn and
as reaching its finale in late summer. He therefore begins with bird
movements in autumn, followed by " autumn colour , and spider
time " and continues through the seasons to high summer. There is
much about birds in the book, in fact they claim the major part of the
author's attention. The black and white illustrations are of the usual
high standard expected from Mr. Fitch Daglish.

THE CAPERCAILLIE IN CAPTIVITY

By S. H. Benson, Director-Secretary, Zoological Society of Glasgow
and West of Scotland (Glasgow, Scotland)
Wheo a poultry farmer in the County of Angus, Scotland, phoned
say that he had trapped a Capercaillie cock bird (Tetrao uro-
\0x25A0'allus ),.and that he wished to present it to our Gardens, I accepted his
und offer with some misgivings. It was in the last week of September
&amp;gt;950, and the prospects of being able to provide an adequate supply of
-omferous feeding throughout the winter were not good.
Although there are many areas of conifer woodland in Scotland
C * nVenie &quot; 1 the Cit Y of Glasgow, where our Gardens'
ire situated I was able, however, to have branches of pine and fir
ent in for the first five weeks, and although the bird picked at them
&amp;gt;ne could not say that it tackled them with avidity, or showed as
nudr preference as it did for the Indian corn (maize) and whole oats
l p ' h d f by " s \* r the herba ge and insects it got in the ij acre wood
/ith thirty deciduous trees.
However, let us first of all consider the psychological attitude of this
\0x25A0ir very difficult to keep in captivity--in a strange and confined
nvironment. In the wood were peafowl, guineafowl, wallaby,
.g&amp;gt;ptian Geese, Blue Snow Geese and Grey Lag. The Capercaillie
love about m an aloof attitude, at times aggressive. Its one ambition

^ s. H. BENSON-THE CAPERCAILLIE IN CAPTIVITY
Following a letter I wrote to The Field on the subject of our unique
Capercaillie, some rather interesting information followed in the
columns of that publication. One writer said that it is evident that
young Capercaillie, reared in Scotland, in the wild state, can get no
pine needles until they are able to fly up to the tree tops. He knew
of young Capercaillie broods going into fields of growing oats long
before oats were ripe, and remaining there, feeding on oats and
weed seeds, until the corn was cut. But this writer asserted that pine
shoots form their winter reserve of food. Nobody doubts this un er
natural conditions, but our experience proves that the bird can live
without coniferous food in the winter.
Dr Ian D. Pennie, who has investigated the history and distribu-
tion of the Capercaillie in Scotland, mentions its reduction in its
colonisation areas and its extinction in others, due to widespread
felling of conifers caused by two world wars. There is evidence of
changes in the Capercaillie habits. Younger plantations are now
frequented and birds regularly visit stubbles to feed. .
It now seems that we are witnessing a unique change in the habits
of the Capercaillie ; a change which may have advanced somewhat
farther than we realize. We may well assume that our success in
keeping one so long is in some measure due to its being a product
of the " new race ".
Let us now consider the exhibition of a Capercaillie m
Zoological Garden where the great majority of visitors expect to see
striking and exciting specimens. To many, the lonely, ungainly and
somewhat unusual bird is interesting. Some think it is a bird of prey.
However, the fact that it begs so successfully in face of competition
assures the Capercaillie of an admiring audience.
In May 1952, we were able to observe the display of the Caper-
caillie. It is a most impressive performance, and I think it is something
that few can claim to have seen in the wild state. The neck is stretc e
and the tail is fanned vertically in a way that suggests the Turkey s
nuptial performance ; wings are drooped and the bird struts about
in a most hostile manner. Its aggressive attitude is no idle threat, tor
I have seen it attack our Peacocks and even advance on the keeper
when he went into the wood. .
The exhibition is not confined to action, and there is an unpleasan
vocal accompaniment more suited to a mammal. The prelude o
attack is a very clear click, and this call is repeated at frequent intervals.
We have been trying to get a hen to keep our bird company but so ar
have been unsuccessful.
So far as I am aware our keeping of a Capercaillie so long (1
zoological garden) is a record, but it is not by any means a record
for keeping them in captivity anywhere. I am most reliably
that they have not only been kept for a number of years in Sweden,

By The Duke of Bedford (Woburn, Beds, England)
It is not often that a Parrot-like bird dies in one's collection of
genuine old age. If the management is good it is, indeed, the owner
who may first succumb to that universal malady !
This summer I have, however, lost two cock Roseate Cockatoos
from tins cause, but there was rather a remarkable difference in the
manner of their going. One, tame and a talker, I acquired a few
y ea |s a s* the Zoo, where he had doubtless been a number of
years, probably after a similar, or longer, period in other hands
He was at first wmg-stiff from long caging, but soon recovered the
power of flight and he bred a few weeks later, and continued to
breed until this season, when he had no mate.
He remained in good spirits and perfect plumage until a few weeks
ago when he began to spend an abnormal amount of time in the
shelter and did not seem as active as usual. His appetite remained
good and he brightened up a bit in the high temperature of the
hospital readily greeting his friends with conversation, but he never
again 63 7 ^ ^ bef * re he seemed well enough to turn out
The other cock--a non-albino white--I obtained, with an albino
hen, about 25 years ago. For some seasons they bred, producing
always grey young, but they stopped doing so about sixteen years ago
The cock began very slowly to show signs of age. When I brought
my birds to Woburn I decided to fly him at liberty in the hope "
rejuvenating hum Complete liberty sometimes has a marvellously
juvena mg e ect on birds that have aged prematurely owing to
close confinement in a cage, but it did not make much difference to
he old Roseate doubtless because he had long been living in an
viary which allowed a decent amount of exercise. He behaved
^ensibly, and stayed round the aviaries, but never flew about very

ttendant had found him one day on the ground, and unable to make

Most of his time he spent sleeping, but the weather did not seem to
trouble him, and he would often sit, by choice, in cold, drenching
rain when a cosy shelter was available. His companion at this time
was a hen Malabar Parrakeet for whom I have never been able to
secure a mate. I thought they would agree together as she would
be too small to hurt him, and he would be too decrepit to hurt her.
They not only agreed, but formed an attachment for one anot er
the strangest, most amusing, and most pathetic I have ever known
amonv birds. " Amor omnia vincit" was certainly true in their case.
There 5 were differences in size, the Cockatoo being about four times
as big as the Parrakeet. Their language was wholly different. Ihei
courtship technique was wholly different. A courting Roseate preens
his feathers as an invitation to his lady-love to return the complimen
and also to allow him to preen hers ; but he does not feed her. A
courting Malabar does not preen his lady's feathers, but he oes
feed her That the Malabar should have made advances to the
Roseate in spite of these difficulties was not so very strange as lonely
spinsters, with or without feathers, do sometimes try and make the best
of very unpromising material ! What was extraordinary was that the
poor old Cockatoo, with one foot in the grave, and not within a
hundred miles of any capacity to be in breeding condition, not on y
understood the Malabar's affectionate intentions, but appieciate
and was flattered by them, trying bravely to be young for
sake " ! When she made advances to him he would perk up and
make nibbling movements with his beak, as Roseates do when fee; mg
friendly He would also start preening and she, partly understan ing
what was required of her even though it was not at all what the
instinct of her species taught her, would pull his feathers in a clumsy
but gentle fashion, an attention which pleased him very much.
The sad time at last came, however, when it seemed kinder to have
the old man put to sleep as, if he fell off the perch as he sometimes
did, he was only able to regain it with great difficulty.

Glossy Starlings have appealed to me ever since I first saw them at
the Zoo as a child, but I did not keep any myself until May, 1951,
when I was given a Purple Starling, Lamprocolius purpureas, and subse-
quently purchased an orange-eyed Green Glossy Starling, of whose
specific name I was not sure, as a companion for it. There was n
sign of pairing between them during the summer as I halt hoped
there might be, and later behaviour showed them both to be ma

In November, I acquired another pair of green Starlings, slightly
laiger and with yellow eyes. Derek Goodwin has examined&amp;apos;and
compared notes on the plumage of the three green Starlings with skins
at the Natural History Museum and has come to the conclusion
that they are all the same species, Lamprocolius chalybeus, and that the
orange eye colour is an individual or local difference, although the
hooks give yellow ' as the eye colour for all races of L, chalybeus.
1 he first owner of the yellow-eyed birds did not know if they were
a true pair, and certainly there were no external differences except
that one had a permanently ruffled patch of feathers on the breast
and was, perhaps, a fraction smaller. They were in very good
condition, so I introduced them straight away into an aviary 15 f ee t
by 22 feet, with a shelter 8 feet square, whose other inhabitants were
the Starlings mentioned previously, a pair of Blackbirds, several
British finches, a pair of Barbary Doves, and a pair of Budgerigars
They all agreed quite well together during the winter, although ffle
gieen pair speedily established superiority over the other insectivorous
birds they did not molest them unduly. By March, however they
were becoming decidedly aggressive, and harried the Purple Starling
m a disturbing manner, but did not take so much notice of the orange*

Inside the shelter I nailed up a budgerigar nest-box, with the door
at the front left open, and both birds showed interest in it but made
no attempt to carry nesting material. I had seen the cock offering
mealworms to the hen, who accepted and ate them, although occasion-
ally she would return the mealworm to the cock and it would pass
retween them several times before she ate it. They had also tugged
at string securing the perches, as if with nest-building intentions.
On 1st May I nailed up a parrakeet style nest-box, 8 inches square
and 12 inches deep. By the next evening a heap of twigs and dried
grass had been added. On 3rd May I provided two old sparrow
nests, dried leaves and more twigs and saw the female carrying
feathers and string to the nest, but she made no attempt to enter whik

each other and the cock would go into aggressive display against the
Starlings in the other aviary whenever they approached the dividing
netting. There are two common postures which seem to merit full
description since they do not appear to have been previously desciibed.
(1) The threat-display .--When threatening a rival the male bird
holds himself erect, with head stretched upwards and the wings held
so that the secondary feathers, with their dark velvety spots, are
somewhat spread and fully exhibited in a lateral plane. In this
posture the wings (without being opened) are constantly moved
with a quick, upward-fickling movement and the irides rapidly
contract and dilate.
(2) The greeting-display .--When one of the paired Starlings is
approached by its mate it often greets it by lowering its head and
uttering a note rather similar to, and undoubtedly derived from, the
begging-note of the juvenile. This would appear to be in the nature
of a friendly greeting and, like so many displays signifying friendliness
or submissiveness, it is very obviously the " opposite of the hostile
threat-display.
On 12th May, having seen no evidence of nest building for three
days, I provided fresh moss and dried grass, but this was not used,
although a few blades of fresh green grass were added. The next
day I threw down some small bits of cotton wool which both cock
and hen collected and took into the nest. Early in the morning of the
following day (14th May) I put in a handful of white and brown duck

and pigeon feathers which were pounced upon by both birds with
much chattering and obvious excitement. By evening the nest was
well lined with feathers, and the hen roosted in the nest box for the
first time.
On 15th May the hen laid a soft-shelled egg at midday, so I
immediately supplied plenty of crushed cuttle-bone and egg-shell.
She roosted in the nest-box again that night, but on the following
three nights slept on a perch beside the cock. The next three nights
she spent in the nest-box and on 22 nd May I found an egg, a delicate
shade of turquoise-blue mottled with irregular brown splotches. Three
more eggs weie laid on successive days, all before 1.30 p.m., and one
definitely before 10 a.m., but the hen did not commence to sit tightly
until the fourth egg was laid.
The cock took no part in incubating the eggs. The hen would
come off the nest whenever I appeared--regularly at 8.30 a.m.,
1 p.m., and seveial times after 6 p.m.--in order to claim her share of
mealworms. Indeed, if no mealworms were forthcoming she seemed
not at all anxious to return. By now both birds were entirely insec-
tivorous, ignoring their usual food which I continued to offer fresh
daily, and eating very little fruit. If the hen spent too long off the
nest--and towards the end of the incubation period I had time to
notice that she frequently spent spells of five to ten minutes away--the
cock became very worried and would stretch out his head and neck
and run towards her, chattering at the same time, as if trying to
persuade her to return to the nest.
On 5th June, exactly fourteen days after the first egg had been
laid, one egg hatched, and the chick could be heard squeaking faintly,
by 8 a.m. The second hatched between 1 p.m. and 6.30 p.m. the
same day ; the third before 7 a.m. on 6th June, and the fourth between
that time and 7 a.m. 7th June. I looked at the nest once every day
in the early morning, when the hen's attention was occupied by
mealworms ; the young gaped strongly as soon as the lid of the nest
box was raised, but I resisted the temptation to handle them. Six
days after hatching all four appeared very healthy and there was
nothing to choose between them in size ; quill ridges were visible
undei the wing flesh. The female was still feeding them on maggots,
and had now commenced to feed large mealworms, ignoring the
smaller mealworms and Tribolium destructor larvae with which she had
been supplied at first. By this time I had put down for this one pair
of birds and their four young, about 6,000 Tribolium destructor larvae,
2 lb. of mealworms (about 7,000), and 3,500 blow-fly larvae. This
seems a staggering amount, but I have under- rather than over-
estimated the numbers. Some of the insects were wasted, as I found
the hen much keener on picking up insects off the ground than
sorting them out of a bowl and so, although the bowls of mealworms

and maggots were always present, five or six times a day I threw down
a handful of mixed larvae, quite a few of which no doubt escaped.
The hen was a very enthusiastic feeder, often gathering a dozen
maggots or mealworms in her bill at once, but the cock did not feel
the call of parental duty very strongly, and would visit the young
only occasionally, and then only with one mealworm. He would,
however, visit the hen when she was sitting on the eggs or brooding
the young, and give her much vocal encouragement.
The seventeenth night after the young had hatched was the last
night the hen roosted in the nest box ; from then onward she slept
on a perch beside the cock. The young looked ready to leave the
nest, with their flight feathers well grown and tail feathers about an
inch long. I now began to feed a lot of mealworm pupae as well as
large larvae and both birds showed a strong preference for feeding
their offspring on the pupae, and maggots were taken veiy seldom.
They began to use a harsh, rasping call that I had never heard before,
particularly in the early morning and at dusk. By 27th June, twenty-
two days after hatching, I was becoming worried as the young were
showing no interest in the outside world and their parents were
cutting down on food supplies, presumably in an attempt to entice the
young birds out. Also the weather had become intolerably hot and
the temperature inside the box was well over ioo* F. For the
first time I handled the young and found three quite big and strong
but one very thin and weak. At midday I hand-fed them on bread
and milk. At 6 p.m. one young bird was out of the nest and was able
to fly a little. He roosted that night on a low perch. The next day
was even hotter and I found the weakest Starling dead. I removed
the other two from the box and placed them on the shelter floor where
they ran around quite actively but were unable to fly ; by night,
however, they had managed to flutter on to a low perch.
The hen appeared to do all the feeding but often received no
response from the young birds. She would lightly tap the beak, and
if the bird did not gape immediately, tap its legs gently. If there was
still no response, she would go to another bird and repeat the per-
formance, but if, as seemed to happen very often, none of the young
would accept the insects in her bill, she would follow them round in
a very agitated manner.
By the evening of the next day one bird was very weak, and kept
falling on to its side, so I brought it into the house and gave it a dose
of brandy and water--a " cure all " for bird complaints, in my opinion.
The weather was still extremely hot and the next day, three days after
leaving the nest, the lustiest youngster--which had left the nest ol its
own accord and had begun to fly quite strongly--was found in the
evening huddled in a corner on the ground, although at midday it had
appeared perfectly well. That too was brought into the house, given

biandy, and caged with the other which now looked stronger, though
we had to resoit to forcible hand-feeding. The remaining bird looked
all light, and loosted beside its father on a high perch.
But alas, next morning the bird we had brought into the house the
pievious evening was dead and the one left in the aviary was lying on
the floor. It failed to respond to any treatment and died within
hall an hour. The first one to fall sick seemed much brighter but
se\eial times that day had bouts of lying on its side and " breathing
its last . Each time, however, w^e managed to revive it with brandy,
and it is now a stiong bird, having undergone its hrst moult during
October.
I sent one of the corpses for a post mortem examination, but owing
to the heat the body was too decomposed for the cause of death to be
asceitained. The pathologist did, however, suggest that the heat
may have had something to do with it, and yet it seems extraordinary
that a bird which comes from a tropical climate should succumb to an
English heat-wave.
The parent birds continued to visit the nest-box and to add bits
of nesting material ; feathers, dried grass, etc., and also fresh green
glass which I saw the cock pull up with his beak. Several times the
cock attempted to mate with the hen when they were picking up
mealworms that I had thrown on the ground, and this was the only
paning I witnessed. There was a minor domestic drama before the
ai rival of the next egg. The orange-eyed Starling in the adjoining
aviary had for some time been " making eyes " at the hen whenever
she left hei family, and when once they were gone he redoubled his
efforts to attiact her away from her husband. He would run back-
wards and forwards on the ground beside the wire separating them, then
fly to his nest-box, at the same time chattering and calling to her.
She seemed quite ready to follow if only the netting had not been in.
the way, and would run along the ground on her side while her
husband pursued her and did his best to get between her and the
other cock. But the purple-headed Starling at no time showed
interest in " the lady next door
On 12th July a soft-shelled egg was laid at noon and the hen roosted
in the nest-box at night. On 15th July I did not look into the nest
box until 6 o'clock in the evening and I then found one egg which
was misshapen, being very elongate and pointed. This egg was
incubated for sixteen days, but failed to hatch.
. On I0t h August the hen laid again, just one egg, and this hatched
in thirteen days. The young bird thrived and left the nest twenty-three
da\s alter hatching. It was out of the nest by 8 a.m. and scuttling
round the floor when I appeared, but it did not fly for three days,
sleeping on the floor in a corner of the shelter. On the fourth night
it roosted on a low perch and from then on made great progress.

The weather was cold with several sharp frosts at night, but the bird
seemed unperturbed. The survivor of the previous nest, however,
whom I had transferred to a cage in the other aviary shelter, was so
miserable, shivering with puffed-out plumage, that I decided to keep
him in a cage in the house for the winter.
Ten days after her offspring had left the nest it became obvious
that the hen was going to lay again. In feeding the cock had again
played only a small part and whereas the hen would gather a bill full
of mealworms and deliberately seek out the young bird and feed it,
the cock only fed the young bird if it was near him and actually
begging for food. Even then he would pick up only one mealworm
at a time. As the hen lost interest in him, so the young Starling
became weaker ; he sat near the mealworm bowl and asked for food
whenever one of his parents flew down, but they fed him in a per-
functory and unwilling fashion, and although he had begun to examine
food of his own accord and would, I think, have commenced to pick
up satisfactorily in another few days, his increasing weakness made it
difficult for him to balance when trying to pick up a mealworm. On
27th September an egg was in the nest by 12.30 p.m., and the young
bird was so much weaker that I forcibly fed it twice on bread and
milk and mealworms. The following day a second egg was laid by
11 a.m., and I removed the young Starling and caged him with the
other young one who had now commenced to moult and had become
very quiet, but was eating well.
Two days before this next lot of eggs were due to hatch the aviary
roof was repaired and the hen was off the nest for over three hours,
being replaced by a hot-water bottle. I hadn't much hope of the
eggs hatching, as the weather was extremely cold and the hen seemed
to spend even longer intervals away from the nest than she had done
previously, so I was greatly surprised to find a chick in the nest at
8.30 a.m. on nth October. The second chick was just out of the
shell when I looked in the nest at 10.30 a.m. the following day.
This egg shell was not removed until noon, when I saw the cock fly
out carrying half the shell which he proffered to the hen as though
offering a mealworm. She did not take it from him, however, and he
then flew down to the ground and ate some of it. This was the only
time I saw the shell removed and eaten, but as I never found any
traces of the other egg shells, I presume they must all have been
treated in the same way.
The day was overcast and cold, and my joy at the successful hatching
was somewhat tempered by the fact that the hen did not appear to
share my pleasure, and spent very little time with her offspring.
The following evening one had disappeared and the other felt cold,
but was still alive the next morning when I brought it into the house
to try to hand-rear it. Unfortunately I was not successful.

At the time of writing (December) the two young birds that did
survive are spending the winter in a large cage in our kitchen, and
judging by the amount of their " singing " are both cocks. The last-
hatched has only just commenced to warble properly, but for some
weeks has been emitting the most awful, harsh, nerve-racking squawks
in an effort to find his voice. Like budgerigars they appear to be
stimulated by certain noises such as a kettle boiling and food frying.
It is at times quite difficult to make oneself heard.
A brief note on the general feeding of the Starlings may be of
interest. Their staple diet consists of Sluis' Universal food, Rudd's
Anteggo, bread and milk, and fruit, pear being the favourite. A handful
of mealworms or maggots is thrown down twice a day. The birds also
relish scrambled egg, cake crumbs and other odds and ends from the
household table. They were outside all last winter with only slight
heat supplied by an electric tubular heater on the very coldest nights.
This year they have had no heat at all and appear quite fit, although
we have had some extremely cold weather.
The insects offered to the pair when rearing young were all species
that infest various foodstuffs and of which I am able to obtain fairly
large quantities through my work. Larvae of the following species

temperature of 25 0 C. (77 0 F.) will produce large numbers of soft-
bodied white larvae, about 5 mm. long, in two to three weeks. I
imagine they would be extremely suitable for small, delicate, insec-

Cockroaches were offered on several occasions, but never accepted.

THE BIRDS OF LAKE MYVATN, ICELAND
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.989958512195122" page_id="58090803"  page_num="Page 54" year="" vol="">
By John Yealland (London, England)
Lake Myvatn is situated in north-eastern Iceland, some 55 miles by
road from the town of Akureyri and at about 1,000 feet above sea-level.
The lake is indeed a beautiful place in a country of much scenic
grandeur and there can be few comparable places in the world where
waterfowl of thirteen species breed in such numbers or in such a
concentration.
The main reasons for this would seem to be the abundance of food,
the comparative scarcity of natural enemies, and the suitability of the
nesting terrain on the shores, on the islands and about the surrounding
streams. The ducks are never shot but are carefully preserved for the
egg harvest.
All the land around the lake and every island, however small, belongs
to one farm or another, and the ducks' nests are robbed of all but four
eggs, though great care is taken that no bird deserts because of the
belief that it will re-nest on someone else's land. The eggs are a
considerable source of income to the farmers, who must make a return
of the numbers taken to the Inland Revenue authorities for the
purpose of income tax.
Thus it would be impossible to ascertain exactly how many eggs are
taken annually because no doubt the official returns err on the side of
modesty, but it must amount to some thousands.
It might be thought that this egg-collecting must be disastrous for
the birds, but evidently that is not so, for the mortality among the
ducklings is very high, mainly, it would appear, for the reason that
many of them lose sight of their mothers, so that unless they are able
to join on to another family--and most ducklings are, of course, often
hostile to newcomers--they soon perish from the cold. If, therefore,
the mothers are unable to care for four it is unlikely that they would
be appreciably more successful with a normal brood.
Also, of course, the taking of eggs has been going on for many years,
yet it would seem that the area could scarcely support a much greater
population than the present one.
The chief natural enemies are the Raven (Corvus c. corax) and the
Greater Black-backed Gull (Larus mannus ), neither of them common.
I once saw a pair of these gulls attacking a duck far out on the lake.
The duck was trying to escape by diving, but its course under the very
clear water was easily followed by the gulls which pounced upon it
whenever it came to the surface. At length they caught it and then set
about trying to drown it--and dreadful it was to see the unhappy bird
striving to get its head up for air.

JOHN \ EALLAND THE BIRDS OF LAKE MYVATN, ICELAND
The Ravens sometimes take sitting birds, but the remains of ducks
and their eggs are not a common sight.
I think it is correct to say that the birds of prey (the Iceland Falcon,
Snowy Owl, etc.) which seem to be rare round about the lake, for
I did not see one, and the Arctic Fox, which is shot by the farmers,
feed more on the Ptarmigan than on the ducks. The name Myvatn
means the lake ol gnats or midges--and very appropriate the name is,
foi these and small flies are present in the summer in many millions.
Mercifully they do not bite, but on a sunny day they swarm in such
clouds that it is sometimes difficult to see where to step. While I was
there in June a 24-hour blizzard killed off many of these insects so that
life for the ensuing week became more agreeable.
These insects with their larvae and pupae must form a large part
of the diet of the birds ; there is also a species of caddis-fly, the larvae
ol which are attached to the submerged lava boulders, and some
water-snails.
Reykjahlid on the northern side of the lake is perhaps the best place
for seeing the nesting birds. A mile or so off shore is the pretty island
of Slutness, a favourite nesting place, as is a tip of land on the further
side wherever the ground is carpeted by the dwarf birch with moss
growing up between its foot high twiggy branches.
The lake in this area is no more than five or six feet deep, and here
it seemed that the Long-tailed Duck ( Clangula hyemalis) was more
common than elsewhere, and at another place a few miles off Barrow's
Golden-eye ( Bucephala islandica) was more plentiful ; another was more
favoured by the Common Scoter ( Melanitta n. nigra) and in another
there seemed to be more Tufted (Ay thy a fuligula ) than anywhere else.
The most common duck of all was the Scaup (Aythya m. marila) and
it may be that these preferences for certain localities is determined by
the nesting terrain rather than by any food factor.
Red-breasted Merganser (Mergus senator ), Wigeon (Anas penelope ),
Pintail (A. a. acuta), Gadwall (A. s. strepera) --said to have become more
common within the past 40 years--Teal (A. c. crecca), and Mallard
(A. p. platyrhyncha) also nest here.
A certain amount of indiscriminate laying of eggs seems to take place,
single ones being laid far from any nest, and once I found a nest with
nineteen Scaup eggs in it and a Long-tailed Duck stting on four of its
own and four Scoter eggs. Barrow's Golden-eye normally nests in holes
or crevices in the lava rocks but on Slutness one was sitting under the
bushes, the nest being rendered very conspicuous by the heap of pale
grey down. I was shown a cavern with perpendicular sides in which
a Barrow's once nested on a ledge, the young being unable to get out
until rescued by a kindly farmer.
Contrary to the impression conveyed by a drawing of Myvatn in
Millais' British Diving Ducks, the Harlequin Duck [Histrionicus h.

histrionicus) is rarely if ever present on the lake itself, but, like the
Goosander ( Mergus m. merganser ), inhabits the fast running streams and
rivers, particularly those with islands in them, which flow in or out of
the lake. At one place on the southern side Harlequin Ducks may be
seen from the road. These strikingly handsome birds are tame, allow-
ing one to approach quite near and then not taking flight but swimming
off downstream.
It is strange that they possess such quiet voices, for they must scarcely
be able to hear one another amid the rushing waters of their favourite
nesting places.
Within a few feet of the shore at Reykjahlid were two nests ol the
pretty Slavonian Grebe (Podiceps auritus) and on Slutness in a crevasse
in the lava was a nest of the Iceland Redwing (Turdus musicus coburm)
with newly hatched young, while in a loose stone wall a White Wagtail
(Motacilla a. alba) had its nest. Here the Red-necked Phalarope
(Phalaropus lobatus ) was a common bird and one nest with the husband
dutifully sitting was found. The Arctic Tern (. Sterna macrura) is also
common and the nest, always placed in conspicuous position, would yet
be difficult to find because of the coloration of the eggs if the parent
birds did not betray their presence by mobbing the intruder. The
Northern Golden Plover (Pluvialis apricaria altifrons) is quite common,
small flocks often being accompanied by Dunlins--the form inter-
mediate between Calidris a. alpina and C. a. schinzii * The Faroe Snipe
(Capella gallingo faroeensis) and the Whimbrel (.Numenius p. phaeopus) are
sometimes to be seen round about the lake ; also a few Black-headed
Gulls (Larus r. ridibundus). #
In rocky places the Snow Buntings ( Plectrophenax n. nivalis) were
nesting and the males performing the pretty display flight ; the
Wheatear--intermediate between (Enanthe ee. cenanthe and CE. (#.
leucorrhoa-- seemed quite rare, as was the Meadow Pipit (Anthus
pratensis).
One Red-throated Diver (Colymbus stellatus) was seen and another
heard ; a single specimen of the Kentish Plover ( Leucopolius a. alexan-
drinus) was also seen, but perhaps the rarest of the summer visitors to
Myvatn was a single drake American Wigeon (Anas amencana) flying
in company with two females which may or may not have been this
or the Common Wigeon.
In Reykjavik the Mallard is common on the small lakes within the
city and very tame ; the graceful Arctic Tern is also common. On an
island in the bay there is a colony of Eiders, not seen, but presumed to
be Somateria m. mollissima , nesting as elsewhere in artificial nests
provided for the purpose of collecting the down. The journey by road
from Reykjavik to Akureyri (285 miles) is of great interest. Whooper
Swans ( Cygnus c. cygnus), Grey Lag-Geese (Anser a. anser ), a few Whim

By Edward Boosey (Keston, Kent, England)
For some years we had a cock Alexandrine Parrakeet mated to a hen
lutino Ringneck, and they produced several broods of rather hand-
some hybrids which were about intermediate in size between their
two parents, and had light biscuit-brown wing-patches instead of the
maroon-red ones of an Alexandrine.
Last year I decided to mate their mother to a cock lutino Ringneck
and their father to a hen Alexandrine bred by Captain Veitch, and the
latter mating produced a brood of three excellent young Alexandrines.
The cock Alexandrine, however, recently died, and I decided to mate
the hen to one of the male hybrids ; a mating which (if the inheritance
is a sex-linked one) ought to produce a percentage of lutino hen
hybrids which would be three-quarter Alexandrines.
After allowing the Alexandrine hen a decent interval in which to
mourn her late husband, I introduced the male hybrid into her aviary
which is of our cockatoo type, without an enclosed shelter, but with
the back and third of the top and sides boarded over. The meeting
was, on the hen's part, frigid in the extreme, and she regarded the
unfortunate cock with a glassy stare worthy of a disapproving Duchess
in a novel by Ouida. Although she did not actually pursue him about
t e aviary, as a Broadtail would have, she lunged at him if he ventured
anyw lere near her, and would not allow him under the sheltered part
of the aviary at all.
I then moved them both into an aviary of quite a different type
with an enclosed shelter, and at once the hen was perfectly amicable
with him, even when shut in the shelter at night. After three weeks
or so, thinking they had got quite used to each other, and that the hen
might breed better in her old aviary, I put them back in it, and
immediately the hen became as hostile to him as before, glaring at him
as though he were a complete and highly undesirable stranger Once
more I transferred them to the other aviary and once more peace
reigned, this time with her actually making advances to him !
One may say that the hen's behaviour was strange--and so it was_
but I suppose it is only on a par with the widow who marries again
and doesn't mind living with her new husband in a new house, but
couldn't bear the thought of doing the same thing in the old one--
which would " have associations " for her !

This matter of association is very strong in birds ; it is clear that the
hen Alexandrine associated her old aviary so strongly with her former
husband, and the covered part of it with where her last year s brood
was reared that, while the new cock was permitted to sit unmolested
in the open part of the aviary, he must on no account be allowed under
the covered part where the nest-box used to hang. Taken away from
these familiar surroundings her hostile attitude towards him ceased
immediately. . c ..
It is for this reason that it is so important in the case ol really
aggressive parrakeets such as Broadtails never to put a newly acquired
hen into a cock's aviary, particularly of course if he has recently lost
his wife. Even if he has not been previously mated he will be apt to
resent the sudden appearance of a hen in his aviary, and will be quite
capable of scalping her unless a careful watch is kept to see that they
a&amp; The best plan is to put the hen in an aviary by herself for several
weeks-- preferably in sight of the cock--and then put him in her aviary,
where he will feel like a new boy at school and will be too busy ex-
ploring his unfamiliar surroundings to attack the hen.
Of the Broadtails I have kept I have found Brown's Parrakeets by
far the most difficult to re-mate, and one of the most deadly aggressors
if they happen to disapprove of the partner you offer them, so anyone
possessing these rare and beautiful parrakeets would be wise to take
every precaution when re-mating them, or even when mating them i or
the first time. Before the war we had at Keston a wonderful breeding
pair of Brown's who reared a large number of young ones during the
vears we had them, and when eventually the hen died, the cock was
very pathetic and quite inconsolable and indeed did not long survive
his wife. Any hope of re-mating him was quite out of the question as
he savagely attacked any hen that was put with him. Such constancy
among parrakeets must be rare.
At the other end of the scale, Stanleys, as well as being the smallest
and one of the most attractive of the Broadtails are by far the easiest
to re-mate. ,
Grass parrakeets usually are quite easy to mate or to re-mate, though
Turquoisines are, as they are at all times, the most inclined to squabble.
Redrump Parrakeets may be " faithful unto death but that, I fear,
is as far as their faithfulness goes, as I have found that members of either
sex are only too willing to clasp to their bosoms, with almost indecent
haste, any reasonably presentable partner that is offered to them !.
I would say that most Cockatoos are quite easy to re-mate, and m
my experience Lesser Sulphur-crested, and Citron-crested, and
perhaps to a lesser extent Leadbeater's, usually regard a new
partner without any great show of interest. Roseates, on the other
hand, are more demonstrative and therefore more amusing, and, it

measuring 75 feet long, 50 feet wide, 10 feet high, in which are built

flowering trees and shrubs, with a miniature rivulet winding t roug
* U The breeding season in this part of the country takes place from
SeDtember to February ; some of the Australian species continue
breeding up to June. In this aviary, I keep quite a large selection
of both soft bills and hard bills, which include approximately 120
different species. The following species have been bred and success-
fully reared during the period mentioned above, i.e. September, 195 ,
to Tanuary, 1953 : Blue-breasted Waxbills, Little Ruddies, Scathy-
headed Weavers, Melba Finches, Grey Java Sparrows, Gol en
Sparrow, Spice Birds, Tricolour Nuns, Cuban Finches, Long-tailed
Grass Finches, Silver-eared Mesia, and Silver-blue Tanagers.
A pair of Pekin Robins nested and hatched two chicks but, unfor u-

is at present sitting on two eggs. * tt j

these birds went to nest no less than three times and on each oc*
two eggs were laid and the young successfully hatched, but it was
found that after five to six days, the chicks died. Then last breeding
season this pair of Silver-eared Mesias went to nest in September
in a " Morning Glory " creeper. The chicks were hatched and the
parents neglected them after three days.
P In October they went to nest again in a Loquat tree where again
the chicks were hatched and died after seven days. In December
1052, they again went to nest and built a deep cup-shape nest o
bread leaves lined with coir in the fork of a peach tree situated
5 feet from the ground ; two eggs of a pale blue colour, Notched at
the thick end with brown, were laid, and were successfully hatched
(Incubation period uncertain.) After three days one of the chicb
was found dead on the ground under the nest and had evidently been
removed by the parents. The remaining chick was well catered
by the parents and was fed on mealworms which were placed m a small
box attached to one of the branches of the peach tree, into which a do^en
mealworms were placed five times a day. On the tenth day, the chick

Silver-blue Tanagers went to nest on approximately 18th
November, laying three eggs of a very faint blue texture blotched
with brown at the thick end. They built a shallow-cupped nest of
tw.gs lined with coir in a dry bush, which was fixed t^one of the
aviary supports and about 5 feet from the ground. The incubation
period is uncertain, but I would say approximately , 7 days Three
chicks were hatched, which left the nest after fifteen da/s. The chick
were fed by the parents on mealworms and termites. Some difficulty

conclusions, I think the results sufficiently suggestive to be of some
value. Of these six birds, four are cured, one probably cured, but still
under observation, and one still under treatment at the time of writing^
The clinical appearance of affected birds is fairly constant. T
disease begins as a slight thickening of the margin of the eyehds, some-
times with some beading of the smooth edge of the hd, so that the
lid margin, almost invisible in health, becomes an obvious thickened
rim round the open eye. There is slight, usually ivaterv.discharge,
sometimes so little as to be hardly noticeable. The bird blinks
frequently and rubs its eyes on the perches. After a time the eyehds
and tissues of the orbit exhibit a watery swelling which displaces the
feathers from the margin of the eye, and leaves a ring of bare puffy
skin round the eye. Finally the swelling becomes gross, the eye canno
fully be opened, the lids are often stuck together in the mornings by
dried discharge, which tends to become more abundant and purulent,
and is frequently rubbed off on to the perches or the plumage of the
bird's shoulders. The unfortunate bird may linger on in this state tor
several weeks before death ensues.
Of the various remedies now available, sulphonamides such as
sulphonilimide are effective against a number of bacteria which may
infect the eye. Penicillin is effective against a considerably larger
number and the new drugs aureomycin and Chloromycetin are effective
against nearly all the organisms causing conjunctivitis m man, with a
few exceptions. Antiseptics such as \ per cent zinc sulphate, i/ioooo
perchloride of mercury, or 5 per cent silver protienate may be employed
with some effect in cases which do not respond to the new remedies
If the germ responsible can be cultured from the infected eye, the
bacteriologist will report on its sensitivity to the antibiotic drugs, and
so one knows at once which to select, and what prospect of success
one has. Failing such a culture, one can try one after another unti
one finds a remedy to which the particular infection is sensitive.
The eyes of the birds I treated were swabbed with dry sterile cotton
wool, using an ordinary medical throat swab, and the swabs sent to a
pathology laboratory for culture. Partly I think, because of t e
technical difficulty of getting a good smear of a small bird s eye, and
partly because I was obliged to send my specimens by post m only
two cases was a pathogenic organism isolated. These rather sur-
prisingly grew a penicillin-resistant strain of staphlococcus aureus.
Staph, aureus is a common septic organism of world wide distribution,
causing a variety of septic infections in man and animals. Most
strains are highly sensitive to penicillin, a few (such as this one) are
penicillin-resistant, and these usually respond to aureomycin or
Chloromycetin. Staphlococci are not usually affected by sulphona-
mides, and a case cured by sulphonilimide must have been infect(c)
with some other organism.

To consider my cases in detail :
(i) Hen Barraband. Advanced disease in one eye ; the other
normal. Culture failed to grow. Various antibiotics tried successively
.--at first as a spray applied several times daily. With penicillin the
condition became worse. With # per cent zinc sulphate no improve-
ment. Suspension of aureomycin produced temporary improvement,
but failed to make further progress after three weeks. Chloromycetin,
i per cent spray showed no change, and the disease appeared in t e
other eye. . ,
The bird was then, after three months of experiments, rather worse
than when she arrived. The disease had been somewhat checked m
the bad eye, but had started in the originally healthy one. I then,
almost in despair, tried a new and improved preparation of Chloro-
mycetin which had just come on to the market. This was far too
expensive to apply as a spray and I was forced to catch the bird daily
and put the preparation directly into the eyes with a dropper. This
proved to be the secret. With the much more effective concentration
of the drug obtained, and the mechanical washing out of the pus by
repeating the dropping every minute for five minutes, once daily, a
rapid improvement occurred and the bird was well in a fortnight.
I had at first been obsessed with the idea that I must avoid daily
catching, for fear that the bird's general health would not stand so
much handling. When I eventually had to do it, I found this fear
quite groundless, providing one used a very small cage into which one
could put one's hand and take the bird without fuss and with no
room for the bird to hurt itself trying to evade capture.
Cases (2) (3) (4) treated together. Another hen Barraband and
two Crimson-wings. All had moderately severe disease of both eyes.
From the Barraband and one of the Crimson-wings a germ was
successfully cultured and reported as " Staphlococcus aureus ,
resistant to sulphonamides and penicillin, sensitive to chloromycetm,
and very sensitive to aureomycin. From this report aureomycin was
obviously the treatment of choice, and was applied by dropping the
eves once daily with a suspension of aureomycin powder in distilled
water, 40 milligrammes in 5 c.c. All responded well. The Crimson-
wings were cured in three weeks. The Barraband, however, twice
developed a severe enteritis (she had loose droppings on arrival), and
her treatment had to be suspended whilst she was given heat, an p
sulphamezathine in her drinking water for the enteritis. She is
probably cured now, but has not been under observation long enough
after cessation of treatment to be sure. .
: Cases (5) (6) Bourkes Parrakeets. Both had been treated before arrival
with sulphonilimide, without improvement. Cultures failed to grow,
(5) had slight thickening of the eyelids and hardly any discharge
It was cured after two weeks daily dropping with aureomycin.

(6) had mild disease in one eye, and fairly severe disease in the other.
It improved very very slowly, and after three weeks had made so little
progress that (in the absence of any bacteriological report to help) it
was thought penicillin might be worth a trial, and in three days
penicillin drops produced definite improvement. The bird then
unfortunately became severely ill and had to spend two weeks in the
hospital cage, with suspension of treatment, and both eyes relapsed.
It is now under treatment again and improving slowly, but had a great
deal of lost ground to make up. The large parrakeets were held in the
hand and a drop put in each eye, each minute for five minutes. The
Bourkes proved too frail to endure this and I was obliged to be content
with one drop in each eye and immediate return to the cage. This,
I think, was the reason for the relative failure ofaureomycin in case (6).
In all cases cure was only assumed if the bird had been observed for
at least two weeks without treatment and showed no sign of recurrence
of thickening of the eyelids in that time.
Although most of my cases were infected with penicillin-resistant
organisms, I think it improbable that this represents the usual state of
affairs. Penicillin is highly effective against most strains of staphlo-
cocci and against most germs that sulphonamides will kill, although
not quite all. Aureomycin is the antibiotic of widest range and is
effective against nearly all bacteria likely to cause conjunctivitis. It is,
however, in short supply in the United Kingdom * Chloromycetin,
available here, is nearly as good. Penicillin, being non-irritant and
very freely soluble, would be best for penicillin-sensitive cases--as
probably the majority are. Sulphonamides would be effective in a fair
number of cases, but not against staphlococci, so that there seems little
to be gained by trying them before proceeding to penicillin or the
' mycins '* In conclusion, it seems established, that parrakeet eye
disease is a septic conjunctivitis which can be caused by staphlococcus
aureus, and probably by a number of other septic organisms as well.
Why it should be confined to a few species of Australasian parrakeets,
is difficult to explain. It may perhaps be due to inherent lack of
resistance in these birds rather than a species--specific infection.
It should be curable in most cases by systematic dropping with a
suitable antibiotic. I think it would be best to try penicillin first, and
if no improvement is noticed in, say, one week, to proceed to aureo-
mycin or Chloromycetin--one or the other of these drugs is likely to
prove effective.
I am most grateful to those members who have entrusted me with
their sick birds for this investigation and hope that the results may
be of some help in the future management of this disease. Of course
more cases need to be investigated before final conclusions can be
drawn.

(.Lorius roratus pectoralis)
By H. J. Indge (Thorpe, Surrey, England)
A batch of twelve Eclectus Parrots arrived on the 13th April, 1952 ;
ten Red-sided and two Grand. The latter were taken by one of our
lady members, and within a few days I transferred all the Red-sided
to various outdoor enclosures. I took them out each morning and
brought them back to the bird-room each evening. It may be
interesting to know that I took each on my finger for these trips.
One day, one of the cocks took wing, and although he made no
elevation, he flew quite a hundred feet, with beautiful outstretched
wings. I believe he was the only full-winged bird among them, so I
transferred him, together with the most promising-looking hen, to an
aviary to themselves and left them out altogether. This must have
been very early in May, and although we had several frosts that
month, the birds were not any the worse for it, even though they had
no artificial heat.
By the middle of June the hen had taken to the nest-box, coming out
occasionally, and by the end of June she stayed in the whole time,
coming out only for a few minutes a day. How many visits were
made to the box, to look through the inspection hole, I don't know ;
each time the hen came off, I should say, until we nearly tired of
looking and believed the hen was just pretending. However, just
once more--that was the 29th July--lo ! and behold! an egg ! The
next day another !
Immediately the hen sat tight, coming off only for the bare necessities
about twice a day, when she moved no further than a foot from the
entrance. Each time we had the chance to inspect, we did, and know
for a positive fact that one egg hatched on the 24th August and the
second the next day. We had a chance to watch the chicks for a few
days, and then one disappeared ; probably died and was flattened out.
The inspection hole was such that we could see into the nest through
a tiny aperture, but could not, nor would not, interfere further.
They were born devoid of down, just like budgerigars, and at
thirteen days we noticed a light grey fluff, darkening to the darkest
grey and appearing to have the texture of the coat of a woolly monkey.
At five weeks a feather, like an emerald, could be seen on the back,
and from then on he feathered quickly ; well, as fai as quickly goes
with Eclectus Parrots.
On the 20th November, he left the nest, after having spent three or
four days in contemplation. I wanted to go to the National Show
and as a severe frost seemed likely, I took him and his parents, and

placed them in a flight in the birdroom. A risk, I know, but all went
well, and a fortnight later, he was picking up food for himself.
The aviary in which the parents lived was 12 feet by 6 feet by 7 feet
high The cock spent most of his day in the shelter, indulging in a
couple of flights around the aviary daily, but always ready to answer
the hen s call for food. This was a strange, high-pitched affair, which
could be heard 500 yards away, and she started calling right from the
time she first went into the box, until I took them into the birdroom--
some 5 months.
During the whole of that time, the cock was seen to go into the box
only twice, once for about two minutes, and the other time for as
many seconds. The hen always came to the entrance hole to be fed.
She seemed to have the parental love of a mammal rather than of a
bird but then, there is something so very different about an Eclectus.
She never flew, as her flights were clipped, and even now that the
new feathers have grown, she has never taken wing. About a fortnight
ago I decided to separate them, but the family seemed so dejected
that they were united again.
During the time the youngster was being fed, I gave a quantity of
green food, but I never particularized, just picked whatever came to
my hand in the garden, in the way of weeds, and also marigold and
orget-me-nots, both leaves and flowers. I was reluctant to give fruit
although just occasionally I gave a grape or piece of apple. The seed
mixture consisted of sunflower and canary.
The youngster was slightly darker than his father, with a horn-
coloured bill. Now, except for the tip of the bill still having a smudge
there is no difference. &amp; '

The Chairman, opening the meeting, said she had very great
pleasure in welcoming Professor Berlioz, of the Paris Natural History
Museum, who was the world's foremost authority on Humming
Birds. Professor Berlioz, in response, said he was delighted to have
the opportunity of attending a Club meeting.
On intioducing Viscount Alanbrooke, the Chairman said the Club
greatly appieciated that amidst his many official duties he had found
time to pay a second visit. The appreciation was the more obvious
by virtue of the fact that the attendance was easily a record.
Viscount Alanbrooke showed his two new colour films, " Waders "
and " The Flamingoes of the Camargue ". The former, taken on
Hilbie Island, Dee Estuary, showed a large variety of wading birds.
The sequence of a Curlew preening with salt water was of special
inteiest. Viscount Alanbrooke gave an amusing account of the
difficulty experienced in locating the Flamingoes. Due to disturbance,
possibly by low flying aircraft, they had moved to new breeding
grounds. The Camargue is apparently threatened by various reclama^
tion schemes, but French ornithologists will, of course, make every
possible effort to preserve this exceptionally interesting area.
There were some good slow-motion pictures of Flamingoes in
flight ; and in the close-ups it was interesting to note the striking
variation in the size of nesting birds. There were also some good
shots of the Bee-eater.
The excellence of the films was only matched by the commentary,
and at the end the large audience showed by its sustained applause
that it had indeed appreciated Viscount Alanbrooke's efforts.
The next meeting of the Club is on 13th May, 1953.

The Ministry of Agriculture and Fisheries (Animal Health Division)
has decided to reimpose the ban on the importation of Parrots. The
Order, " Parrots and Miscellaneous Birds (Prohibition of Importa-
tion) Order, 1953," came into force on 16th February, 1953. Copies
of the Order, price 2 d., may be obtained from H.M. Stationery Office,
York House, Kingsway, W.C. 2.
Until further notice " No person shall import into Great Britain from
any other country or part of a country any bird to which this Order
applies ", namely, " live birds of any of the following descriptions,
that is to say--birds of the species Psittaciformes, including any
of the birds commonly called parrots, parrakeets, budgerigars, love-
birds, macaws, cockatoos, cockatiels, conures, lories, and lorikeets."
In addition to preventing the spread of ornithosis (sometimes called
psittacosis), the regulations are aimed at safeguarding the country's
poultry flocks against the introduction of fowl pest from abroad.

W. H. Turner writes : "Sir Edward Hallstrom now has eight
hybrids from Hooded cocks and Many-coloured hens : the result being
so much like the Paradise Parrot it is hard to tell the difference between
these and a mounted skin of the Paradise. At present they are only
young, but by appearance there seems to be male and female in them.
It is, of course, not yet possible to tell whether they will be fertile and
it will be interesting to follow on with the breeding."

The host of birdkeepers to whom Lovebirds and Parrotlets have
recently become available for the first time will find much to interest
and instruct them in the proper care and management of these
delightful subjects in captivity in Mr. Luke's new book.
It is somewhat confusing, however, when the author points out the
well nigh impossibility of sexing certain species and then paradoxically
proceeds to enumerate eight features to enable one to determine the

sexes, some of which have proved quite unreliable. Similarly, he quite
correctly states that the Peachfaced has no eye-ring, yet the colour
plate shows a distinct white area round the eye. On this plate the
Redfaced appears to be an undersized Peachface and the eye-rings of
the Blackcheek and Masked are comparatively too small.
Several historical facts are not correct. The Blue Masked first
appeared in this country some four or five years prior to its arrival in
the United States. The Lutino Nyasa has never been bred in this
country. The Blackcheek, far from being the most commonly met with
to-day, is along with the Madagascar and Nyasa, practically unob-
tainable owing to export restrictions in its country of origin, no
importer secured a consignment during the raising of the ban.
Such inaccuracies must lead to confusion among beginners and
irritation to more knowledgeable readers ; a great pity in view of the
invaluable worth of the chapters on management, aviary construction,
and behaviour in captivity.

Barbary Doves
Mr. Derek Goodwin's interesting article on the Barbary Dove brought to mind
</figure>
<bodyText confidence="0.993747033333333" page_id="58090820"  page_num="Page 71" year="" vol="">
my early and pleasant experiences with this species.
In California they are very frequently sold under the name of Ring-neck Dove.
As they are very cheap to buy they are often the species the novice first under-
takes. They were among the first birds I purchased as a very young boy--and I can
well remember my first pair costing the sum of a dollar--a rather sizeable sum for
an eleven-year-old.
My one pair bred well and in a short period of time I had many more Barbary
Doves than I could possibly use. Because most pet stores were already filled to over-
flowing with them (what price must dealers have paid for them to sell a pair for a
dollar ?) it was virtually impossible to get rid of one's surplus.
We used to let a few out in the garden--and they stayed very well. Unfortunately
for the Barbary Dove the cats would invariably reduce their numbers. The Barbary
Doves aided and abetted the cats in their destruction by conveniently sitting on
garage and aviary roofs--" sitting ducks " for their enemy.
One fall, when we had about eight youngsters to dispose of, we caught them
up and released them on a ranch some six miles away. This ranch was in a locality
where California Quail and the California Mourning Dove abounded, and so it
was felt that the Barbary Doves would have a good chance to succeed. Their homing
instinct was nil for none of the eight returned to their home aviaries. Whether any
of the released birds lived and/or bred I am unable to say.
Occasionally one sees a Barbary or two in with groups of other pigeons or doves.
At the San Juan Capistrano Mission (some seventy miles from Los Angeles) the
Barbary Dove apparently breeds right at the Mission. The Mission gardens abound
pige * ns anc ^ also a few Barbary Doves--all very tame as they are constantly
fed by visitors. In downtown Los Angeles' Pershing Square I have seen Barbary
Doves associating with common pigeons--and apparently thriving.
I might add that we formerly raised many hybrids between a male Barbary
and a female California Mourning Dove. The Mourning Dove we inherited from a
friend who had found it with a damaged wing. The wing healed, and the bird
(which had been kept in an outside aviary) refused to leave when it was released.

Instead it brought back a mate and we trapped the pair and subsequently reared
many young. The youngsters were usually released and they would generally
stay for a few days and then wander away. When the male Mourning Dove died we
replaced him with a male Barbary Dove, and this arrangement certainly suited the
hen for they instantly began family operations. .
It might be of interest to note that this female California Mourning Dove was
a known eleven years old when she finally died. She bred right up to her death,
though in her last years sometimes only a single chick would be raised.
The Chinese Necklace Dove is firmly established around the Los Angeles area.
I see it very frequently--and it certainly appears to be as common as the local
California Mourning Dove, at least in our locality. It not infrequently associates
with the Mourning Dove, small mixed groups of four, five, or six being seen feeding
in vacant lots, etc. The Chinese Dove appears rather intelligent for pairs around
frequently fly into our garage for spilled grains--a feat the local Mourning Dove
has never accomplished. ,
The Chinese Necklace Dove is a very desirable addition and doubtless a good
sporting bird. There is a pair which nests in a pear tree in our yard--and they
usually nest several times a year. . ,
From memory I believe a rather detailed history of this bird in California has
recently appeared in the Condor , Journal of the Cooper Ornithological Club.

THE PROBLEM OF THIRD BROODS OF PARRAKEETS
</equation>
<bodyText confidence="0.99936846875" page_id="58090821"  page_num="Page 72" year="" vol="">
In regard to Mr. Boosey's letter about Turquoisines, I certainly should not attempt
to haul a nest-box out of the aviary when the young are at their wildest stage.
There are however, methods of avoiding undue damage to the young and at the
same time of preventing the hen from rearing a third brood. . .
With the rarer and more timid Grass Parrakeets I am coming back to my original
view that the roof of the aviary should have an inner lining of string netting and, in
addition, before the young of even the first brood have left the nest, a good thick
screen of branches should be tacked on to the wire-netting over the whole end of the
flight to prevent them crashing against that.
Coming now to the problem of the third brood, when the second brood are still
in the nest and the hen has not yet started to lay her third clutch, you can remove
the cock and also, if you like, the second nest-box. In order to encourage the hen
to make a good job of finishing feeding the second brood single-handed, she should
be given more hemp than it is usually safe to give Turquoisines and also an abundant
supply of the choicest seeding grass. The cock should be placed in a cage in the
bird-room and fed on very plain seed and green food, a combination of circum-
stances which will encourage him to go out of breeding condition and start moulting.
He should not be put in another aviary as he will be more restless there and call
continually to the hen and he may also, very likely, pick up some deadly microbe,
as late summer is the time when these pests are most virulent. When the right time
is thought to have arrived to take the young birds away from their mother (they
have got to be moved some time), you can also remove the nest-box and put the cock
back with his mate and she, too, will not be long in dropping into moult while the
weather is still good.
An alternative plan is to leave both parents in the aviary and, when the last young
one of the second brood has left the nest a few days, go in and net the whole brood
as quickly as you can before they have time to do themselves serious damage. Put
them in a cage in the bird-room and cover the whole floor of the cage with seed and
seeding grass and keep the bird-room at a comfortably warm temperature. There is
little doubt, if they are healthy and well-reared, that they will start feeding adequately
as soon as they begin to get hungry but, if you like, you can put with them a young
Budgerigar which has started to feed itself freely, in order to give them a lead. When

they are feeding freely and have steadied down a bit they can be put back in an
a&amp;apos; iar &amp;gt;S first confined to the shelter for a day or two so that they grow accustomed
to it and know where to find the food. It is, of course, necessary that their new
aV !j ar r ui- " av 5,, the same arrangements with regard to protection of the roof and
end of the flight. There they can remain happily until they moult into adult plumage
and begin to quarrel ; or (as is much more likely, as Mr. Boosey is as well aware as I)
u . n . the yj |ie 1 of Pneumonia or nephritis ; get clawed by a sparrowhawk ; or fall a
victim to X s latest practical joke ! When the young are out of the parents' aviary
you can, of course, remove the nest, and the third clutch of eggs which Lovebirds
may take if you have any.
Mr. Boosey mentions a hen he has had for several years which has reared three
broods each season, but can he tell us how many hens he has lost before they have
put up this satisfactory record and how many young of the third broods have matured
into good breeding stock ?
There are, no doubt, hundreds of hen Budgerigars which have reared three or
more broods in a season and survived for a reasonable period, but that does not
alter the tact that it is the almost universal practice of breeders who want to produce
stock of the highest quality to limit the number of nests to two.

FOOD OF PARRAKEETS
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.997913842105263" page_id="58090822"  page_num="Page 73" year="" vol="">
I was very interested in what Mr. E. J. Boosey had to say about sweetened rice
and milk as a food for his Plum-headed Parrakeet as this corresponds with my own
experience in India. 7
When 1 was at Karwar, a very lovely place on the west coast of India, I had some
young Malabar Parrakeets brought to me which had been fed on the usual diet of
parched gram flour, moistened with water. They seemed too far gone to help, but
I remembered an article by Dr. Amsler in which he described how he had fed his
breeding Swamson s Lorikeets on boiled rice and milk and honey sugar. I, therefore
got ernandes, our cook, who was very interested in birds, to make me some rice
mould sweetened with brown sugar. I do not think the fact that the sugar was
rown made any difference. Two of the little things were too far gone to save, but
the two stronger ones ate this new food avidly and grew into fine birds. I used this
food a Is* for some tiny Hanging Lorikeets and they throve upon it.
I have often thought the diet of hard grain inadequate for Parrakeets. The Malabar
rarrakeet, so far as my experience goes, is a forest lover, and I should think that
its diet consists far more of soft wild fruits than hard grain. Incidentally, I think I am
the person to whom Mr. Boosey refers in one of his articles, who told him about the
breeding of the Grey Parrot in India. It only shows what an unbelieving fellow
xYLr. Boosey is and what a bad judge of character he was, in this particular case.

Ihese are once more being offered for sale in this country,
leanwhile the spread of the wild species through Europe continues ; it has now
bred in bweden and has reached the Ardennes in Northern France. If any reach

with escaped or released imported birds.
In Germany quite a number of wild Collared Turtle Doves have already been
ringed, and two have been recovered (both show that first-year birds can travel long
distances) ; so may I suggest that all those who purchase Collared Turtle Doves

{Nectarinia j. johnstoni)
By John Yealland (London, England)
The Scarlet-tufted Malachite Sunbird was first obtained by
Sir Harry Johnston on Kilimanjaro in 1884. An account of the
species together with a coloured plate of an adult male appear in
Sir Frederick J. Jackson's Birds of Kenya Colony and the Uganda Pro-
tectorate, vol. 3.
* / _ 1 * t-v . . . 1 ble paper " Nectarinia
johnstoni : a Revision of the Species, together with Data on Plumages
Moults and Habits," {Ibis, 93 1951, pp . 579-595) in which he
demonstrates (m agreement with Sclater) that there are three races :
A. johnstoni is therefore se P arable into N. j. johnstoni, a long-winged,
long-billed form with green metallic P lumage in the males : JV. 7.
salvadorn, a short-winged, short-billed race, also with green metallic
p umage, and N. j. dartmouthi, a long-winged, short-billed race with
bluish-green metallic plumage in the males and dark brown females."
S&amp;apos;, j. johnstoni is most common on the alpine moorlands of Mount
Kenya from about 11,000-14,000 feet on the western side and from
10,000 to 10,500 feet on the eastern slopes--wherever the Giant
Lobelia ( Lobelia keniensis) is in bloom.
Of the diet, Mr. Williams says, " The main food of the typical
race is Diptera, small flies forming the bulk (ca. 85 %) of the contents
. the 28 stomachs examined. Also included in the stomach contents
m Older of frequency, are the following: minute Coleoptera *
spi ers, unidentified insect (?) fragments ; yellow vegetable matter (?) *
poffen (once recorded). Nectar was almost certainly present, but was
difficult to detect."
Of the roosting habits he says, " On several occasions old birds were

Mountain Chat ( Pinarochroa sordida ) in the matted dead leaf clusters
of the Tree Groundsel ( Senecio keniodendron). These holes, which must
give much protection to this sunbird during the bitterly cold nights,
are sometimes, perhaps as a rule, used communally, as on one occasion
two females and a male were seen to enter a cavity within a few
minutes of one another. Immature birds were seen to enter disused
nests for resting and warmth."
It appears that the normal clutch is one egg only. There is an
eclipse plumage in N. j. johnstoni and N. j. salvadorii , but it appears
doubtful whether this occurs in JV. j. dartmouthi.
Some of the JV. j. johnstoni (which is new to aviculture) were collected
on Mount Kenya by Mr. R. Bloom, and those kept at the London
Zoo have been thriving on the usual Sunbird food together with
house flies. One male which has spent the past winter in an outdoor
aviary (with a heated shelter) was often outside and singing in quite
cold weather.

By Reginald T. Bloom (Ludham, Norfolk, England)
The idea of catching the Sunbird, Nectarinia johnstoni johnstoni , first
came into being when talking with Lord Chaplin one evening. As
a result of modern travel the comfort of an English fireside was soon
exchanged for the lower slopes of Mount Kenya, on whose high moor-
lands this bird makes its home, and my small mule safari was moving
ahead of me, following one of the many game trails which lead upwards
into the dim shadowy depths of the Giant Cedar forest.
Thousands of Parrakeets screeched high in the trees overhead ;
a Hartlaub's Touracou was flushed off a low branch, showing its
crimson wings ; Hornbills hooted in the higher branches, whilst
dragonflies and butterflies hovered over the thick beds of nettles. It
was an eerie journey, the Podo trees creaked and groaned and the
breeze rustled through the high branches, admitting rays of sunlight
which formed strange moving patterns on the green below.
Gradually the way became steeper, ridges and deep valleys formed,
some with little streams running down them, but the game tracks
followed the ridges closely, making a track for us. Although there were

many signs of game, five elephants were the only big game we saw.
Soon the larger trees thinned and small glades bathed in sunlight were
a warm and cheerful change from the darkness, and a suitable place
suggested rest and food before entering the thick bamboo forest which
would engulf the remainder of the trail.
The bamboo forest commenced at about 9,000 feet and seemed to
swallow us and shut its mouth behind us, so sudden was the change.
It was darker and colder, with a damp, penetrating cold which chills to
the bones, and because of the stillness it was at times almost frightening.
It seemed as if the ground had sprouted a whole forest of organ pipes
which, draped in soft green lichen, rose about 40 feet, to interlace
gi otesquely and form a series of arches resembling some vast witches'
kitchen. These trees were placed so thickly that game trails formed the
only means of passage, and even then a way often had to be cleared
before the mules could pass. Their bulky loads suffered hard treatment,
and when they became entangled with the bamboo it snapped with a
sound like a shot which would echo through the forest.
It was a long four hours before the highest edge was finally reached
but, as suddenly as it had begun, this dense forest ended, the silence
and the darkness were behind, and they were replaced by the evening
sunlight and bird-song. The altitude was now about 10,000 feet and
the ground became more level, the country resembling an English
woodland scene with large oak-like trees draped with creepers. There
were bushes of feathery bamboos and clumps of brightly flowering
salvia ( Leonotis ) on which hundreds of Goldenwings, Bronzy, and
Malachite Sunbirds were feeding.
These birds were fighting and squabbling, and there was a continual
noise of angry chattering. Their nests were hanging like large cocoons
both from the young bamboos and from the Leonotis , which grew to a
height of about 15 feet.
Now it was possible to look down over the green forest belt to the
golden plains below, rising and falling in broad undulating curves
until they joined the Aberdare Mountains, 50 miles away. The tent
was pitched snugly in an elbow of the forest before the sun sank behind
the near-by hills. As supper was cooked in the embers raked from an
enormous log fire the frost fell and the wind blew bitterly cold, so that
one froze on one side and roasted on the other. In the morning the
small tent was frozen like a board and the trees and ground were
covered with a thick hoar frost which crunched underfoot.
The camp was kept in the shelter of the forest edge, which ended
abruptly and gave way to open moorland. This moorland continued
from about 11,000 feet until it reached the snows at 15,000 feet, and it
was crossed by rugged ridges and steep, stony valleys, leading upwards
towards the massive glaciers and snowy peaks. The snow gleamed
brightly in the morning sunlight which, creeping over the mountain's

northern shoulder, lit the high ground in the plains below, until
eventually all was flooded with a soft golden light.
The tops of the ridges were covered in tree heather, Protea bushes,
and hundreds of brightly coloured flowers. On a Protea bloom the
first Nectariniajohnstoni was seen. It was a cock in full breeding plumage ,
its metallic green glistened, while its long, ribbon-like tail waved in the
breeze. It appeared to be less fidgety than other Sunbirds, feeding
quite unconcernedly, digging its bill into the petals of the flower in
search of the minute green beetles found on this plant, and occasionally
whistling to its mate. These birds showed a fondness for bathing and
could often be seen washing themselves as the top of the ice began to
melt from the puddles, or even breaking the ice on water which had
collected in the lobelia leaves so as to splash in that.
Suddenly a hen flew off a small egg-shaped nest built in the fork of a
near-by heather bush about 4 feet from the ground. The nest was
entered through a small hole in the end, the hole was facing away from
the prevailing northerly wind, and investigation proved that it was
lined with the furry down of the Protea seed pod.
During the next few days twenty nests were found, of which one
contained a single egg, seventeen a single chick, and two were empty.
All the nests were built in sheltered places, usually in heather bushes,
but there was no attempt to camouflage or conceal them. The single
egg was pink in colour and covered with dull red spots, these spots
being grouped more thickly at the broader end ; in size the egg was
similar to that of a sparrow.
Each pair of Nectar inia johnstoni appeared to have their own territory ,
this seemed to extend for about 200 square yards, and the birds
defended it vigorously. Should a territory be invaded by another cock
a terrific fight ensued, the two chasing each other at a truly amazing
speed, at times flying straight upwards until completely out of sight.
After this had happened the victor would glide slowly back, his breast
puffed out and his tail trailing high behind.
Both cock and hen fed the chick, which left the nest as soon as it was
able and fluttered from flower to flower, squatting from time to time
with its wings drooped and quivering.
On the higher moorlands, where the giant lobelia and giant groundsel
grew to a height of approximately 9 feet and resembled fields of
gigantic brussel sprout stalks, the birds were found in large numbers,
even as high as the permanent snows. The sunshine at this height was
quite warm, but as soon as the sun was covered by cloud it became
bitterly cold. These moorlands resemble those of Cumberland, having
the same windswept bleakness, and they are often blanketed in heavy
cloud, so that at times all is grey and dull. When the clouds pass over,
brilliant sunlight lights up the flowers and bushes, and the snow of
the mountain peaks gleams white against a deep blue sky.

The Kenya Malachite was the only other Sunbird seen on the moor-
land and it was quite easily distinguished because of its lighter colour
and its moie slender body. It was never allowed to stay for very long,
being immediately chased off by the Nectarinia johnstoni.
It was noticed that the birds left the higher moorland near the snows
in the later afternoon and were seen in quantities on the lower slopes
just above the forest about four o'clock, whereas during the day only
the pairs were seen here. A number of fights seemed to take place on
the arrival of these daily migrations to the lower slopes.
Once captuied, these birds could be examined more closely, but a
detailed description of them has already been published by John G.
Williams ( Ibis , 93, 195 0 * They were found to accept captivity readily,
and in three days would take food from the hand. The return journey
was so arranged that the bird boxes were carried by hand and not by
mule. Frequent stops had to be made so as to rest and feed the birds.
Aftei a short stay at the base camp the birds commenced their air
journey to London, where all arrived safely.

By The Duke of Bedford (Woburn, Beds, England)
Psychological abnormalities in birds which involve a profound
departure from the usual instincts of their species are always in-
teresting. This year for the first time I have had a case of two hen
Budgerigars not only sharing the same mate, which is fairly common,
but also the same nest box, which is much less so. As a rule a hen
Budgerigar is violently jealous of another hen approaching her nest,
and any friendship which two hens may have formed prior to matri-
mony rapidly dissolves when the boxes are put in. When the nests
went into an aviary containing about nine pairs of homers, lively,
though not dangerous, squabbles were for a time the order of the
day. To my surprise, however, I noticed that in the midst of the
turmoil of female conflict a white-blue and a cobalt hen were
remaining the best of friends, rubbing noses and examining two
adjacent boxes with the most complete good will. The cobalt gave
way at times to the white-blue, but there was always civility on both
sides. Any other hen, however, who approached their boxes was
promptly attacked by one or both of the friends. That it was not
a simple case of two birds of the same sex achieving a " pair forma-
tion " relationship was, however, shown by the fact that both hens
accepted a yellow cock as their mate, and were as friendly towards
him as towards each other. For a time I thought that the cobalt

and the white-blue, in spite of their friendship, would end by each
taking one of the two boxes to which they had staked out a claim,
but suddenly they decided they could not be parted ; allowed a
weaker hen to take possession of one of their boxes ; and laid and
incubated side by side in the other one. The yellow cock obviously
enjoys having two wives, but if they present him with twelve children
he will learn that after supper comes the bill !
While this odd domestic problem was developing inside the aviary
a different one was being staged on a pond outside. Two full-winged
Carolina drakes had for many months enjoyed a bachelor friendship
which they found completely satisfying. In March, however, two
spinster ducks arrived on the scene and strove earnestly to persuade
the drakes to modify their views on matrimony. As far as I can
make out, they are not making much headway. Though not actively
hostile, the gentlemen are not a bit interested. They are perfectly
content to remain as they are, thank you !

A. GENERAL.
Doubtless this form is very close to Lampronessa, but it is not so close
as one might think at first. Still, the separation of the two genera
Aix and Lampronessa seems to me to be inconsistent with classifying
together such different birds as the Mallard and the Wigeon in the
genus Anas.
B. THE NON-SEXUAL REACTIONS AND CALLS.
These correspond in general to those of the Carolina Duck. The
drake's call-note, however, is not separated from the burp as in the
drake Carolina. A very nasal " Pfrrriub " takes the place of both calls.
When this sound is uttered the hood is ruffled to its greatest extent
(Fig. 50). The go-away and nest-hunting call of the duck is very like
that of the Carolina, but the drake has, in contrast to the drake
Carolina, no corresponding call, at least not so far as I know.

<bodyText confidence="0.9455655" page_id="58090836"  page_num="Page 81" year="" vol="">
The Mandarin drake takes less interest in the presence of the female
at the performance of his display
than any of the Anatidce that I
know. Even more than with the
Mallard the social display is an
affair of the males. The males
place themselves on show quite
passively without being the least
bit concerned about the presence
of females, almost like Black-
cocks, Ruffs, and other birds lack-
ing true pair-formation. Corre-
spondingly, in the social play of
Aix those orientation-reactions in
Fig. 48. --The position taken by the Man-
darin drake, Aix galericulata, at the begin-
ning of the social-play. Compare with
Figs. 9 and 19.
which other drakes, even the Mallard, give attention to the ducks
which are present, are lacking, namely the turning of the head and of
the back of the head. Only in the mock-preening is the drake oriented
toward the duck, but this behaviour occurs very seldom in the social
display. In the social play proper, the Mandarin drakes do not
court one particular female, just as Peacocks, Turkey Gobblers,
Black Game, or Ruffs never do. It is also surely no coincidence that
this very species, where the active role in choosing a mate falls so
entirely to the female, is at the same time the one with the most highly
differentiated showy male plumage.

These have become, in Aix, an absolutely linked behaviour-sequence
but in the reverse order in which we saw them in the Gadwall. After
an exaggerated drinking there follows a mock-preening (Fig. 49 a-c)
which is more formalized and marked by stronger morphological
differentiation than is the case in any other duck. That is to say,

the Mandarin drake touches the large rust-red tertiaries which are
held up like a sail during every outburst of display from the inner side.
The drake performs the drinking-and-mock-preening act very often
when he is standing on the shore beside his duck. Then both mates
drink at the same time, and thereupon the drake touches his beautiful
plume, invariably the one on the side next to the duck. As he drinks
his hood moves so that the movement is emphasized thereby (Fig. 49).

with the corresponding movements of the plumage, result in a most
grotesque spectacle. It looks almost as if the bird must put his neck
out 01 joint.
5. Display-Shaking.
The Mandarin drake has no real grunt-whistle but he displays
not less than three different behaviour patterns which have come from
mimic-exaggeration of shaking. The first reminds one of the male
Tadorna r display-shaking. First the head is lowered and then thrust
up very high, while a whirring sound is uttered. We can symbolize
One ,h,uld , y
pronounce the " w " and the " r " at the same time. It is voiced
with this head movement. The hood is very much ruffled.

</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.985418848484849" page_id="58090838"  page_num="Page 83" year="" vol="">
This is a behaviour sequence peculiar to
It consists of two separate movements both
derived from a displacement shaking. After
an ordinary introductory shaking, often
even without it, the drake dips his bill into
the water about 5 cm. from his breast, shaking
and squirting and then, continuing to shake,
he thrusts it up again. This behaviour differs
fiom an ordinary very hard shaking, such as
we have seen in the females of Aix and
Lampronessa, only by the movement being
so exaggerated that the bill is actually
dipped into the water in a way recalling
the grunt-whistle of the Anatince and never
occurring in the case of autochthonous shaking. Besides this, in
t is movement the drake utters a sound which I have designated in
my diary as " Gnk-zit ", which expresses its similarity with a half-
repressed sneeze fairly well. Immediately after this action and always
linked to it, there now follows a second, which by its greater differentia-
tion is still farther separated from shaking. With a sharp bend of
the head, the bill is lowered vertically so that it dips into the water
right in front of the drake's breast. The tendency to lower the head,
which we have seen in the ordinary shaking of Aix and Lampronessa '
ls ^ re m i m i c &quot; exa ggerated much more than in the previous movement.
W ith a very brief shaking, the very curved neck is now thrust upwards,
with which a short sneezing whistle is heard. I suspect that as a matter
ol lact only one right-left movement takes place, as in the true grunt-
whistle of the Mallard and Pintail drakes. The body is not straightened

up afterwards. One can say that of these two linked shaking ceremonies
the first is barely differentiated from the ordinary introductory
substitute-shaking. The second is more differentiated but it has
remained, so to speak, half-way to the grunt-whistle. Therefore,
both are clearly intermediate forms between a displacement shaking
almost unaltered so far as the autochthonous shaking is concerned,
and the grunt-whistle of the Anatina. Thus the derivation of the
grunt-whistle from the shaking behaviour is made almost certain by
the two connecting links formed by the movements of the Mandarin
drake's " double grunt-whistle ".
7. The Combat of the Drakes.
This forms a very interesting chapter in the ethology of Aix. Like
the males of many birds that have an extreme social display and
extremely fine plumage, the drakes do not fight seriously. The shooting
along beside each other, which is so distinctive of the combat behaviour
of the drake Carolina and already tends with this species towards
ritualization, exists in Aix only as a much more purely symbolic
activity. As such, however, it plays an important role in social play.
Heinroth is right in comparing this behaviour pattern of the drakes,
as they shoot wildly around each other in this ceremony, with that of a
crowd of whirligigs ( Gy rims ).
8. The Post-Coital Play.
This consists only of non-specific gestures of excitement, among which
burping, display-shaking, and aiming movements of the head can be
named.
Summary
If one wants to formulate a classification of a group with any
real success one must rid oneself once and for all of the idea that a
linear arrangement of the forms can really represent the relationship
existing between them. Naturally, this is true, too, when we spoke
previously of the ducks " about in a line All animals living to-day
are growing branch tips of a " family tree , and can, ipso facto ,
not be derived from " one another The comparison of their char-
acteristics results, therefore, in an arrangement which can be repre-
sented freely by the likeness of a family tree with branch tips like those
of a small round-clipped beech or yew tree. They lie all together
in one surface, which represents a cross-section through a bush growing
outwards at one point in time. Just as we can only tell by guessing
and judging appearances, because of the thick foliage of the tree
which we cannot see through, as to which ends belong to a common
branch and how far down they branch from the main stem, so the best
systematic arrangement can only give us reasonable speculations about
true evolutionary relationships.

I am now going to try to represent graphically, in a tabular diagram,
what we have gained through that kind of systematic intuition which
I tried to describe in the Introduction as a simultaneous review of as
many chaiacters as possible. Only by evaluating all accessible char-
acters simultaneously can we achieve a proper judgment as to the
lelative value of individual characters. First of all we must make a
biief deliberation of a fundamental nature. The similarity of a series of
forms, even if the series structure arises ever so clearly from a separa-
tion according to characters, must not be considered as establishing
a series of development stages. Let one imagine that, out of one
common root, a number of forms have grown out, all equally old
B
Fig. 51. --Diagram of a series of
similarities in recent animal forms
whose neighbouring members are
not joined by close genetic relation-
ship. When part of the lines of
descent fall out, the rest of the
forms, lying in the row A-B, can be
mistaken for phylogenetic series.

tionship. Every two neighbouring

larities to the part of the path of de-

and equally differentiated from the root. We shall represent this family
tree structure in Fig. 51 as a kind of shaving brush. Now let us imagine
further that, as represented in one half of the brush, part of the hairs
have fallen out in such a manner that the rest remain somewhat
in the form of a fan. The tips then represent a step ladder leading from
A to B, which would seem convincing evidence that the forms have
descended " from one another ", especially if the degree of differentia-
tion is less on one edge of the fan than on the other. Doubtless the end-
points of such a " family tree " have already often been taken for
P }logenetical series, which unfortunately, places ever more welcome
weapons in the hands of the opponents of the theory of descent. On
the other hand, we must not fall into the opposite error to this too
ready formation of series and generalize in the view, that all similarity
a lecent organisms might be explained from the principle of

fan-shaped classified lines of descent, as an over-generalization of
Kleinschmidt's theory would imply. Doubtless there are very many
cases in which not only a monophyletic development of large groups
of animals has taken place, with many individual forms not splitting
off till later, but also the further differentiation of the single forms, at
least in respect to single characters, took place at such different rates
that similarity lines arose as represented in the diagram in Fig. 52.
However in observing these similarities which correspond to a
phylogenetical staircase one must not forget for an instant that the term
" primitive " may be used only for one or several characteristics of a recent animal
form , never for the form as a whole. Even Sphenodon , or Ornithorhynchus,
is not a " primitive animal The circumstance that some or even very
many characteristics of such a form are quite certainly phylogenetically
primitive, does not justify us in the presumption that, all the rest of
their characteristics are also primitive. The stopping of further
differentiation of one character means nothing in respect to the course
of differentiation of the others.
The " intuitive feeling " of the professional systematist, which we
discussed in the Introduction, is generally well enough developed to
decide between similarity series which rest upon a common descent,
as has just been described, and such as arise through the previously
discussed phenomenon of classified descent-lines arranged in a fan
shape. In order to have a more objective criterion for this separation
I suggest the following consideration of probability. If one grants
that all the representatives of an animal group come from one source,
independent and diverging, without nearer connections with each
other, as represented in Fig. 51, then one would expect that the
similarities of characters which determine the arrangement as to which
lines of descent were to be placed side by side, would be divided
rather equally over the whole brush. If, for the sake of simplifying
the graphical representation we take a longitudinal section of the
brush, getting thus a number of fan-shaped, diverging lines of descent,
the similarities which bind each form to its systematic neighbour,
would have to go through the whole sheaf of lines homogeneously,
and especially from every point to both sides, hence, in the threje
dimensional sheaf diagram, to all sides ; binding species with species
in like manner.
This type of distribution of characters actually occurs : in all so-
called " circles of forms " (Formenkreise) this holds true and Klein-
schmidt's theory of family-bushes (instead of family trees) is indubitably
correct if applied to these cases. A Formenkreis is nothing else than
a " shaving brush " in which the middle part has worn away, leaving
a circle of hairs, representing the single forms.
Now if one represents characters held in common as cross connec-

common to the larger divisions of the group toward the base and the
otheis more and more towards the periphery in proportion to the
narrowness of their distribution and their degree of specialization
and, consequently, their phylogenetic youth, there would be, in the
ideal case of the diverging sheaf-like type of species-formation, a
classification such as is represented in the diagram in Fig. 53.
Now we shall try to represent graphically, in the manner described,
the group Anatirue, using as many of their systematically useful
characters as possible, in order thus to form an opinion as to how far
theii 1 epiesentatives can be put together in groups according to true
phylogenetic relationship, and to what extent the evolution of their

of characters one would expect

the variabilities and similarities
are explained only by greater or
lesser divergence, the distribution of
most characters overlaps.

straight lines m Fig. 5 i. Although the sheaf of the lines of descent
can be symbolized only in three dimensions we shall have to use

may draw them thus and then glue them together so that they fit
I confess that I myself used, for the arrangement of the species, a bundle
ol stiff wires with thin wires representing " common characters "
joining them together into sub-groups.
If one grants that not every species of a group of forms has de-
veloped quite by itself, independently from all others, a very different
distribution of characters is to be expected. If several forms have

of them has developed since the time of its branching-off. If two
branches grew away from each other very far down we are not surprised
if they are connected only by very old characters common to larger
group categories. Cross-connections in character distribution, as
we have represented in Fig. 53, are not to be expected if, for the time
being we ignore the possibility of convergence. Fig. 54 shows the type
of character distribution which is to be expected in a family tree as
opposed to the family " bush " represented in Fig. 53.
In species where there is reason to believe that the lack of a character
is not primitive but of secondary occurrence, this has been shown by
a little cross at the intersection of the character connection and the
line of descent. As is clear from the Table, the placing together into
groups of common origin becomes more probable the nearer we move
to the base of the sheaf of lines of descent, while for very many char-
acteristics of more recent date clear cross-connections m the distribu-
tion of characters after the manner of Fig. 53 have yet to be found.
Notice, for example, the distribution of the grunt-whistle, head-up-
tail-up, and turning-of-the-back-of-the-head.
The few morphological characters, interspersed in the Table are to
show how similar their distribution is, in many cases, to that ot
behaviour traits. After filling in those gaps, which are especially
obvious in the list of species investigated, I plan to construct a muc
larger diagram, built upon the same principle, in which will be entered
all or nearly all the available morphological and behaviour characters,
such as the fertility of hybrids. The publication of this Table must
above all await the result of comparative studies of the drake s bone-
drum, which is so very rich in characters that can be compared.
Heinroth has left some unpublished material on this subject, as well as
a very complete collection of bone drums. .
Even in its preliminary incomplete state our grouping shows
clearly the possibility of using the phylogenetic homology concept for
characters of inherited behaviour. This fact, which it has been the
principal task of my investigation to prove, is of the very greatest
significance in comparative psychology.
Editor's Note. --Dr. Konrad Lorenz has made a number of
alterations and additions to the translation in view of his subsequent
work on this subject since the publication of the original German
text. The Table which concludes the paper has been re-drawn.

By H. Murray (Brentwood, Essex, England)
From an avicultural point of view, the spring of 1952 opened for
me in considerable gloom if not absolute disaster. Indeed, it was
not until the autumn that my affairs began to assume a more rosy hue.
Over the years I had noticed that my strain of aviary bred British
birds had nested earlier every year, but in 1952 for some reason they
began earlier than ever before, and the middle of March saw both
Lesser Redpolls and Siskins with nests and the former with eggs.
These nests were a good eight weeks before their usual time.
As many people will remember, the end of March was accompanied
by a very heavy snowfall which caused the destruction, or brought
about the desertion, of many nests of Thrushes and Blackbirds and
other early nesting birds. I should imagine that many of the parent
birds died as well. It is certainly true that in the area in which I live,
a district in which both Thrushes and Blackbirds abound, only two
young Thrushes survived from the first round of nests.
In the aviary things were even worse, and all the Lesser Redpolls
and Siskins died, both cocks and hens, presumably killed by the cold
striking them when they were in breeding condition. By the time
I was able to catch them up and bring them in it was too late.
Curiously enough the Bourke's Parrakeets, which are generally
regarded as not completely hardy, but which had also gone to nest
early, sat closely all through the snow and hatched and reaied their
young. I am fairly sure that the cock slept out in the open all through
that bitter week-end. My old hen Cockatiel also died about this
time, and the cock bird was forced to spend the summer as a very
unwillng bachelor ; but a hen seemed quite unobtainable at that
time.
By chance I had obtained a fine hen Orange-headed Ground Thrush,
and I thought that I would have a chance to breed these lovely birds,
as I already had a good cock bird, but here again my hopes were
dashed. The hen by some means best known to herself, wedged
herself into a corner of the top of the aviary, and presumably could
not get out again, and died there. I brought the cock bird in, but of
course another pair of birds had come adrift.
To crown it all, the very night that I released the small birds in the
large aviary I had a visit from owls, and lost one or two birds in night
frights. Once birds are really familiar with their surroundings owls
do not seem to disturb them, but when birds are freshly turned out
they are much more prone to panic.
Among the birds injured that night was a very fine cock Yellow-
billed Cardinal, one of a pair with which I had great hopes of breeding

this species. He damaged the top of his head, but recovered later
although he made no attempt to breed. I had taken a corner from
my large aviary to make a quiet spot for them. Perhaps 1953 will be
more fortunate. Before leaving the subject of these Cardinals I would
like to mention that these birds have the very un-Cardinal-like habit
of hanging upside down on the roof of the aviary in the same manner
as tits.
I must confess that by the time the breeding season came round I
was strongly inclined to go in for stamp collecting or knitting, or one
of the less hazardous pastimes.
About the beginning of May I was in a dealer's shop, endeavouring
to make up my pairs of birds, when I noticed an extremely handsome
paii of small parrakeets of a kind quite unknown to me, and was
immediately keen to own them. As they were rather expensive and
I had seemed to spend a lot of money recently on birds, I decided
not to buy them but, as any aviculturist will realize, I went back a
day or so later and bought them. They were White-eared Conures,
and, I should say, a true pair.
I thought a lot of these birds, as they were bright and not too
noisy. After a few days I turned them into an aviary containing a
nest-box, and was soon very pleased to see them enter. The hen
started to sit and the cock slept in the box with her. When after six
weeks nothing had been seen or heard of the hen I became very
bothered about her, but as the cock still slept in the box I thought
that things must be going on satisfactorily. Then the cock sickened,
and I went in and looked in the box. The hen was dead and had
been for weeks, and the cock, probably owing to sleeping with the
dead bird, also passed away.
I feel that having given such a long description of my troubles, it is
only right to show a little of the other side of the balance sheet.
The Bourke's Parrakeets, as mentioned earlier in this article, had
sat throughout the snowfall. They reared three young successfully in
the first round and one in the second. These were all reared without
any bother. In my opinion the Bourke's Parrakeet is one of the most
charming and attractive of the birds known to the aviculturist. The
young are so delightfully tame and will allow themselves to be stroked
at feeding time. Also I like the way that the cock bird comes to
meet you when he has young birds to feed, and the lovely soft colourings
he shows as he flies. Their call too is quiet, and in many ways they
work their way into one's affections. I have not kept a very laro- e
number of parrot-like birds, but one would have to go a long way
to beat a Bourke's as a friendly little pet. Unlike other people, I have
not found Grass Parrakeets safe with other birds.
In the summer of 1952 I also had considerable success with Guiana
Parrotlets. This little parrot carries no blue except on and under

the wing, the general colour being a medium green. This colour
varies over the bird and turns it into an attractive little fellow.
The hen is more yellow, particularly on the face. In the eyes of these
birds, their greatest glory seems to be the blue on the underside of
the wing. When displaying the wings are held away from the body
and the blue well displayed. It seems to be a fairly general rule
with birds that they show off their more unusual colours when courting,
even though in many cases these are not so spectacular as their
ordinary markings. The display of the white in the wing and tail of
a Chaffinch and the white rump of a Bullfinch are two cases in point.
I obtained the parent birds in the summer of 195 1 an&lt; ^ no attempt
at breeding was made in the first season. Wlien first arrived these
birds were very wild. During the winter they were kept in a cage
in the birdroom and wintered with no bother. Their cage was
actually in the large aviary in which the small birds were wintered,
and it was a most amusing sight to watch the behaviour of an odd
cock Greenfinch that was in the flight. As the spring advanced he
came into full breeding condition, and being without a mate of his
own kind decided that the hen Parrotlet would have to do as a sub-
stitute. He spent hours against the cage trying to feed the Parrotlet
with both the cock and hen Parrotlet screaming with rage at him and
trying to grip some portion of his anatomy. Like a wise bird he kept
his feet outside or his toes would soon have paid forfeit. Mh. Enehjelm
keeps his Parrotlets with his Waxbills and other small fry, and even
breeds them in his mixed flights, but my birds seemed very warlike,
and with their powerful beaks they seem more than a match for any
normal finch.
In May the Parrotlets were let out into an aviary about 6 feet by
4 feet, containing a Budgerigar nest-box partially hidden by
a branch of gorse, and it was not long before they went to nest. The
first egg was laid about the 11th May, and the hen sat very closely.
Apparently the cock fed the hen bird on the nest. Young were
heard on the 6th June and, as was to be expected, sounded very like
young Budgerigars. The hen continued to sit very closely, with the cock
feeding his complete family. Indeed, it was not until just before the
young flew on the 1st July that I saw the hen again.
The first brood consisted of three cocks and one hen. The young
were easily sexed as there is no immature plumage. The colours
brighten as the bird gets older.
The young Parrotlets flew on the following dates, indicating a
rather long interval between eggs for so small a bird 1st July, 3 r( ^
July, 6th July, 9th July. All the young were perfect and differed very
little from their parents. As always with a brood of birds that one
has succeeded in rearing, the family made a pretty picture. The
whole family, both parents and youngsters, slept in a clump under

a piece of wood near the roof. The young birds commenced feeding
themselves soon after leaving the nest, and seemed particularly fond
of timothy grass thrown on the ground. I have yet to find a seed-
eating bird that does not relish this food.
Feeding the biids while the young were in the nest was fairly
straightforward. The birds staple food of a mixture of groats, canary
seed, hemp, sunflower, and millet was given with the addition of
soaked seed and spinach stalk. The birds were really as easy to rear
as Budgerigars. Green food was a bit of a problem at first. The only
kind that the cock bird would look at at the beginning was seeding
forget-me-not. Later he ate spinach.
The hen Parrotlet started sitting again about a week after the
young left the nest, and reared another nest of young ones--two pairs
this time. I was very pleased at my success with these birds, as it
seems to be some years since they were bred, but as appears to be
the case with many parrot-like birds, once the pair decides to nest
they usually make a good job of it. The main difficulty seems to be
to get a true pair of birds in the right condition and frame of mind.
Hawfinches proved a disappointment again this year. They nested
but the hen died with laying her first egg.
Shamas also nested without result. The hen had bad egg-binding
every time she laid, and never managed to lay her eggs in the box.
The cock sang beautifully all the summer and would very willingly
ha\e murdered any bird he could have reached. During the previous
winter the hen Shama had been given a large flight and a heated
shelter, but I am inclined to think that the trouble with egg-binding
may have been caused through her having become cold at times in the
winter. It must, however, be said that she showed no signs of distress
at all, but was always in the best of health and spirits.
An attempt was made to breed three species of Cardinals--Green,
Scarlet, and Yellow-billed, but none advanced further than nest
building. The little Pygmy Cardinal or Black-crested Finch which
I bred in 1951 would, I think, have bred again, but I only had a hen
bird. She nested and laid, but of course the eggs were clear.
Green Avadavats reared two good youngsters.
A cock Cordon-bleu paired with a hen Blue-breasted Waxbill and
reared four fine youngsters, three in the first nest and one in the
second. After their moult one of the cocks showed a faint touch of
red on the ear, but the birds undoubtedly favour the Blue-breast.
It is generally believed that a young bird obtains most of his
colouring from the cock bird, but in these youngsters the Blue-breast
is undoubtedly the dominant bird for colour. Gan this mean that
the Blue-breast is the parent stock and the Cordon-bleu a later
variation ?
These young birds were reared mainly on seed, but the parents

also ate considerable numbers of mealworms and black fly. The nests
were built in a branch of gorse and were simply a small bag of finely
woven grass. The nest was practically unlined, and appeared to be
built by the cock. He also took his turn at incubation and feeding
the youngsters, and was in fact a model parent.
Black-cheeked Waxbills also nested, and one bird sat very closely
although no eggs were laid. The nest was very similar to the Gordon
Bleu, and it seemed a pity that they did not rear youngsters as they
are such attractive birds. This particular pair have now been wintered
three times and it is hoped that in 1953 they will breed.
Live food seems to be essential for Black-cheeks, and soaked seed
is also relished, but one of the greatest treats that can be given to any
seed-eater in the winter is a seed box planted with annual grass
and chickweed and brought into the warm until it has grown up fresh
and green. All seed-eaters like this, and it cannot be otherwise than
highly beneficial to them. This particular pair of birds was exhibited
at the 1952 National Show, and I was very perturbed to see that the
hen looked very sick after the three days' show. The birds were
immediately released into the indoor aviary after their return, and
both flew at once to a pot containing cut up dates, which they ate
greedily. I am a great believer in dates for softbills and fruit-eaters
generally. Cuban Finches and Diamond Sparrows are very fond
of them also. It may be that the Black-cheeked Waxbill needs a sweet
fruit of this nature to keep it in condition. My experience with these
birds has been similar to the general run ; very easy to keep in the
summer out of doors, but prone to enteritis and sudden death when
brought in for the winter.
Nests were built on the ground within a few feet of one another by
both Red-eared Waxbills and St. Helena Waxbills. As the nests were
on the edge of a tiny bank near the side of the aviary it was reasonably
easy to keep them under observation. It is well known that the
St. Helena is one of the more easily bred Waxbills, while the number
of successful rearings of Red-ears can be counted on one's fingers.
Why this should be I cannot see, as Red-ears have nested and
laid with me every year, but they seem to desert before the eggs hatch.
I have always considered that this is due to having more than one pair
of the birds together. When one considers the hundreds of thousands
of these birds that have been imported and kept under all sorts of
conditions over the last century this lack of breeding success becomes
even more curious. I was therefore very interested in watching the
activities of these birds. The nest was the usual rough ball of woven
grass with the entrance at ground level and covered with a tiny porch.
The cock built his little half open nest on the top, and the whole edifice
was covered by a clump of milk thistle. Several of the large leaves
of this plant were either hanging down over the nest or lying on the

ground. It was pretty to watch them go to roost at night. The hen
had a special route that she always followed. This track started about
two feet from the nest and led through the stems of the milk thistle,
reaching the ground about a foot from the nest. She then crawled
and wriggled her way under the leaves lying on the ground until she
could slip into her nest. The cock did not bother so much about con-
cealment, but flew down to his nest. I was both interested and
surpiised to see that the cock and hen did not sleep together in the
proper nest, the cock keeping to his upstair bedroom.
The nest of Red-ears went the usual way, but with the St. Helenas
things were more satisfactory. Their nest was a few feet from the
other one, but appeared to be the same except for the cock's nest on
top. As usual with Waxbills, I had no certain knowledge that there
were any young, until after about six weeks from first sitting a fine
youngster flew. He was a cock with ear patches and a rosy tint on
the abdomen. He was a fine large bird. Greatly to my surprise two
other youngsters flew at the same time and apparently from the same
brood. They were small brown birds with no trace of any red about
them. The parent St. Helenas fed all three birds, so presumably
they flew together. It was the wide difference in the birds that
surpiised me one bird a true St. Helena in full colour, and these two
much smaller birds with no red at all. No colours appeared at all
until the moult, and then the birds, after appearing to be Red-ears,
turned into a sort of cross between a Red-ear and a St. Helena. I still
have these birds and shall try and breed with them this year. At the
beginning I thought that the Red-ears had laid in the other nest,
were in fact partly parasitic. This would account in part for the small
number of successful breedings of this species, but I now think that
the youngsters were hybrids. I had proof last year that this can
happen when from one nest of Linnets I reared two Linnets and two
Redpoll-Linnet hybrids. This time I think I have one true St. Helena
and two hybrids. Perhaps someone who has bred St. Helenas before
may be persuaded to give details of immature plumage. It may be
that hen birds do not assume adult colour until the moult, while the
cock birds fly from the nest with full colours. I find this hard to
believe, but would be pleased to hear more about it.
Black-chinned Yuhinas provided another near miss. I had had
these birds for two years and had never considered them a true pair.
No sign of any display was ever seen, although the birds were always
together and seemed very fond of one another. Even a separation of
a few feet was sufficient to make them call constantly. They com-
menced nesting in early May, and constructed a half-roofed nest in
a wire cylinder. Four eggs were laid of a dull browny-green colour
with darker markings. The nest was built with strands of opened
string and lined with wool. The birds certainly behaved like a true

pair, and relieved one another regularly at the nest. Also I believe
that one bird slept in the shelter. After about a week both birds
were seen to be sitting together, and I became convinced that they
were both hens. After a time I took the old nest away and both
birds built separate nests, but no more eggs were laid. It was a pity
that they did not breed, as I understand that they have never been
bred in England so far.
Ruficauda Finches started the season badly, but finished a little
better. In the spring I had two of these birds that I thought were a
true pair, but the " cock " turned out to be a hen, and the two birds
then built a joint nest, laid ten eggs between them, and spent some
months happily brooding clear eggs. About the beginning of August
I learned that Mr. Vane had some spare cock birds, of which I procured
two and turned them into the large aviary with the hens, first taking
away their old nest. Although the cock birds seemed interested
enough in the hens, the two old ladies, doubtless considering that
they got along very comfortably without the complications arising
from marriage, decided to stick together and built another nest in
which they laid seven eggs which they commenced to brood. A cock
bird approaching the nest was a signal that brought an amazon forth
to drive him away. The male birds looked rather foolish having to
sing and display at a safe distance.
I myself took a rather dim view of this ultra-militant feminism, as
I naturally thought that all the eggs would be clear, but the birds
did not take the matter to extremes, and in due course all seven eggs
hatched. Even when the young were in the nest the cock birds were
never allowed near them or to feed them. Owing to the very wet
weather only two young birds were reared. It may perhaps be
as well to mention that I have proved that both of the hens are in
fact true hens. Both have been egg-bound !
In conclusion I would like to put on record a very unusual occurrence ;
in fact it comes nearer to thought as we understand it than anything
else that I have observed myself. The interpretation of the facts will
probably differ, but the truth and accuracy of them are absolutely
guaranteed.
Many of our members have bred Cuban Finches, indeed these
pretty little birds are nearly as easy to breed as Zebra Finches as long
as they have an aviary with no other birds of their species with them.
The cocks fight furiously among themselves, sometimes to the death,
but with other birds they are peaceful and friendly.
As their name implies, they come from a very warm climate ; indeed
so little do they bother about the weather that their nest, a small
bottle affair usually fixed to the outside of a gorse branch, and not
built in its shelter, is so thin that the sky can be seen through the roof
and the sitting birds and eggs through the base. As another instance

of their being accustomed to extreme heat, they do not brood the
eggs in the same way that a normal bird does, but only return to
the nest for about five minutes in the hour. Indeed the only way that
one can be sure of eggs, apart from an examination, is to notice that
the adult Cubans keep a very close watch on the nest, any other bird
going near being immediately driven off.
My pair of Cubans consisted of a cock bird that I had bred the year
be ore and a newly imported hen. No attempt was made to nest
until well into August, and it was not until the 31st that I heard the
youngsters being fed.
As some of my readers may remember, the week-end of the 6th~7th
September was accompanied by a very heavy frost. On the mornino-
of Saturday the 6th I went to the aviary expecting to find the parent
birds had deserted the nest and the youngsters dead. This is the usual
happening with all birds, both British and foreign, when struck by an
unexpected frost. To my surprise when I approached the aviary I found
both of the parent Cubans frantically pulling wool out of old nests
and carrying it back to their own. This was then taken inside, roughly
placed in position by the beak, and the bird then stood under it and
placing its shoulders under the wool it stood up on its toes and forced
it into position with its back. All Saturday the birds worked furiously,
and all Sunday as well. The young were fed at odd times and screamed
constantly for food, but the parents paid little attention to them, but
earned on with their work. By Sunday evening the nest, which on
f nday had been the size of a man's first, was as large as a football
A great mass of loosely held together wool with the sides about three
inches thick. On Monday night it rained and the nest was washed
hall away from the branch. On Tuesday and Wednesday the young
flew, and more rain on Thursday brought the whole nest to the
ground. Two out of the three young were reared, and I still have
them.
This incident raises several interesting queries. How did these tiny
birds, with no possible race memory of frost, know how to react
correctly to the danger ? Perhaps some of our members have had
similar experiences or have noticed the behaviour of these birds in the
West Indies. Being in the wool trade I prefer to think that even
Cubans can read advertisements, and that they believe " that there is
no substitute ..."

By David M. Johnson (Washington, D.G., U.S.A.)
The article contributed by me about a year ago to the Magazine
appears to have aroused great interest, and I have received many
letters of inquiry. It gives me great pleasure to share with my fellow
members of the Society the results of my further research into this most
interesting subject. I have even had a Kodacolour print made of a
painting I have done of some of these hybrids.
It would seem that this question of Sonnerat hybrids has not
hitherto received the attention it deserves. I have seen a list of at least
seven books in which reference has been made to the contribution made
by Sonnerat's Jungle Fowl to any breed of domestic poultry and all
deny any such contribution or any relationship. One of these books
goes so far as to say : " The resemblance between this Giey Jungle
Fowl and the domestic is great, and it was believed that this would
prove to be the ancestor of the domestic fowl. This is not the case,
however * the two species do not cross, or if they did interbreed, the
hybrids of this cross are sterile." I may say that it is not my opinion
that the Grey Jungle Fowl resembles the domestic fowl in appeal ance,
and my own researches show that hybrids are not always sterile.
There is another reference in an old British book. Dr. Danforth, of
Stanford University, who has done extensive pheasant research in
genetics and intergeneric as well as interspecies crosses in pheasants,
has kindly sent me his papers and a reference in an old British book to
a Grey Jungle Fowl running free with bantams in England, crossing
with them, but the offspring were finally absorbed in the bantams.
This was in the year 1870.
It seems strange that Man has treated so lightly, even indifferently,
a subject which is so related to Game Birds and also to poultry, in its
many phases of interest and study.
The records of our Society seem brief and incomplete in this
particular subject, and I am happy to be able to contribute my
findings. By autumn I hope to report my findings in my research on
three-quarter Sonnerat's cockerels and Cornish Indian Game Bantams.
I have referred to a picture I painted of Sonnerat s hybrids, and if it
is not possible to publish it in the Magazine perhaps it could be
retained in the records of the Society, so that any member who wished
to see it could do so. At the time I painted this picture the cockerels
were under a year old and the feet and legs were then yellow. But at
a year old the feet and legs turned red, as in their sire, the cock sonneratii,
and while the cock bird superficially resembles the Red Jungle Fowl
{Gallus gallus ), the chest would indicate sonneratii , as well as the under-
glow. The shape of the feathers, too, resembles sonneratii , but the comb

takes aftei the mother s side, the Gallus gallus. The hen hybrids are,
however, so like the Grey Jungle Fowl hens that it would take an
expert to distinguish them. In their voices and calls the hybrids more
lesemble sonneratii , which differs from Gallus gallus in this respect. The
hybrids do not seem to prefer domestication as do the Red Jungle Fowl.
I will now comment briefly on the three-quarter Sonneratii hybrids,
with which I propose to deal more thoroughly at a later date.
These biids weie the produce of five-month-old cockerel sonneratii
hybrids and an old hen sonneratii. They were hatched in September
and the clutch were ioo per cent fertile. They grew up in adverse
weathei conditions and during a winter of almost continuous rain and
frost. Theii hardihood was astounding. One three-quarter hybrid
pullet refused to be weaned but is nevertheless this year assisting its
mother in incubating. She looks exactly like a sonneratii. The two
brothers, three-quarter sonneratii , resemble a Grey Jungle cock in
appearance, especially one of them which has almost no comb. I have
provided these with a Cornish Game Bantam as mate and they are
compatible. I have chosen the Cornish Bantam for two reasons. One
reason is they have no superfluous comb and wattles and the other
reason is that some experts believe that the Indian Game Fowl itself
is something other than Gallus gallus , which prompts me to research
along these lines. I have found the three-quarter sonneratii hybrid to
be inherently wild. They seem to think of nothing but eventual escape,
even more than the pure wild Grey Jungle Fowl, which will settle down
somewhat. These hybrids are highly prolific, producing an abundance
of eggs, as in poultry, and the maternal instinct is strong. Egg-laying
is not strictly seasonal, as in sonneratii , and the cock bird is in
season at all times. This is not so in the sonneratii cock, at least, as its
breeding season is strictly in spring and again in autumn. Its repro-
ductive qualities go into eclipse with the summer moult.
I have been impressed with the apparent potentialities of the hybrids,
in their varying degrees, as offering possibilities as a game bird if a
suitable habitat can be worked out. This, of course, should be done by
a system of trial and error by the younger generation of aviculturists.
There seems much promise here for the covert. The food of sonneratii
and its hybrids should be easily found. It seems to consist more of
living creatures, such as insects and worms, and its demands on a grain
diet are less than the other species of Gallus. Its alertness, virility, and
intelligence seem remarkable.
It is to be hoped that others will carry on this work, so that this bird
of unlimited energy and virility may be established in parks, estates,
and preserves.

By Professor E. Sprawson (Kenley, Surrey, England)
I was very much interested in the final paragraph of C# News and
Views " on page 70 of the March-April issue of the Avicultural
Magazine, concerning the breeding of hybrids from Hooded cock and
Many-colour hen Parrakeets, and their great likeness to the Paradise
Parrakeet.
Though neither a prophet nor the son of a prophet, I have for many
years thought that this would be so, and there were several reasons
which led me to think so, as follows :--
The areas occupied by the Hooded and Many-colour (illustrated in
Neville Cayley's Australian Parrots) might well, on occasion, overlap on
the western border of Queensland ; and that occupied by the Paradise
Parrakeet actually does overlap that of the Many-colour in Southern
Queensland, so that opportunity for the occurrence of natural
hybridization may be said to be present. (It also seems well within the
range of possibility for the Golden-shouldered to overlap and hybridize
with the Many-colour.)
The differing nesting sites do not, I think, count for a great deal.
I have had Hooded Parrakeets dig a hole and nest in an ant-hill here
in Surrey (Mr. Boosey published the photograph), I have also had them
nest in the ordinary parrakeet nest-box, such as was used by Many-
colours ; and did not Canon Dutton record that his Paradise Parrakeets
attempted to burrow into the wall of a room--presumably to nest ?--
though he did not say how high above the floor level they burrowed,
but only that had they gone in they would have got into a loft--and
yet it is also known as the " Ant-hill " Parrakeet. Cayley also records
the wild Paradise as occasionally nesting in holes in trees and stumps.
Colour and colour distribution. It is In old saying concerning
hybrids--and with some truth in it--that they are " coloured like
father and shaped like mother ". Shape hardly comes into account
here, as both Hooded and Many-colour are very graceful birds and of
not dissimilar shape, though the Hooded is rather slimmer. The
Paradise, which I have never seen alive, appears to be slim also in the
photograph in Cayley's book.
The Hooded father would give the black cap to the hybrid--but
lessened in area (as in the Paradise).
The crimson patch on the wing I would expect in such a hybrid ;
the Many-colour hen has a small red wing patch and the wing patches
of the young males as they leave the nest are considerably redder than
are those of adult males--which looks as if the yellow patches of the
adult males were a later evolutionary production ; the red wing-

The Hooded father would also give the turquoise blue to the rump
and upper tai coverts, and the brown to the back. The red colour of
e patch on the cock Many-colour's nape might well be transferred to
the fiontal band on the forehead of the hybrid (as in the Paradise) *
besides, the frontal band in the hen Many-colour is often reddish, and

by Mr. Boosey: Red Rump x Hooded, and Brown's x Red (Eastern)
Rosella, and which were of great interest, tended to confirm these
views, and I then put forward my view that the Hooded cock x Many-
co our hen hybrid ought to be almost exactly like the Paradise-
oping that Mr. Boosey would be able to produce it if I could not
myself we both had Hoodeds and Many-colours in those days.
One thing, however puzzled me extremely : the Brown's x Red
(Eastern) Rosella hybrid was at first sight a Brown's with a deep blood-
ie cap instead of a black one--and a very beautiful bird ; now Gould
lecords of Brown s : " I have one specimen also with the whole of the
crown of the head a deep blood-red and others with more or less of this
colour, though he regarded it as unusual, but he does mention the
occasional occurrence of a band across the forehead--which Cavlev
also mentions. I believe no one since has ever seen such a specimen
as Gouid here records, yet Mr. Boosey produces an exact replica by
ybridization, and the distribution areas of Brown's and the Red
( astern) Rosella are almost at the opposite ends of Australia !
Presumably Gould's bird could not have been a hybrid--or at anv
late a recent one, though perhaps a throw-back to one in a very remote
past when their areas of distribution were not so widely separated

Apart from producing imitations of known species by means of
hybridization I have often thought that the hens of the more colourfxi
varieties of Bluebonnet might give wonderful potentialities for the
production of new colour schemes with male Hoodeds and Many-
colours, but so far I do not think many hybrids have been bred with
the Bluebonnet. I am not really fond of hybrids but think we may
have a lot to learn from them, particularly if they turn out to be fertile.
I hope Mr. Turner will keep us fully informed as to the progress of
these hybrids and if they prove fertile, and may I suggest that Sir
Edward Hallstrom try the Golden-shoulder cock X Many-colour hen
hybrid also, and tell us all about both sets of hybrids from time to
time, ultimately perhaps with coloured illustrations. Please dcx bir
Edward--they are all such beautiful creations and we should be so
grateful to know if another species (?), namely the Paradise, could ave
been produced by natural hybridization in the past--as well as by
artificial hybridization in the present.

The whole of one side of the Tropical House has been furnished with
tropical plants, including orchids, and is now devoted to Humming
birds of which twenty-two specimens of six forms arrived some
w The^Golden-throated ( Polytmus guainumbi thaumantias) and the
Red-throated Sapphire (Hylocharis sapphirina) are new to the collec-
tion * the remainder consist of Waterton's Wood Nymph (Thalurama
watertoni) ; Pucheran's Emerald (Chlorostilbon aureoventm P uc ^ nl ^ '
Blue-breasted Sapphire ( Chlorestes notatus), an ano
identified which might be immature Amaziha leucogaster.
These birds are being fed on the liquid diet recommended by
M Cordier anl plenty&quot; of fruit flies. The fateful forty days of
which M. Cordier writes have almost passed and there have ^ een (TM)
losses so far. This happy state could be attributed as much to th
nerfect condition of the birds on arrival--due to some excellent
packing and to air travel--and to the amount of exercise they are
able to* take in this large flight as to the food they have received here.
Two Sunbirds new to the collection have been received from
Messrs. Seago and Bloom; they are the Nandi D * ub J^ 0 ^^
(Cinnvris reichenowi ) and the Uganda Olive-bellied (C. chloropygius
orbhosaster) * also four of the Sudan Beautiful Sunbird (. Nectanma

three Silver Pheasants ; a Tropical Seed Finch ; aGutriW,
a Nepal Hill Myna ; a Festive Parrot ; a Pennant s, a Black-ta ,

A number of the Owls have laid, but unfortunately many of them
are without mates and only the Great Eagle-Owls have young one .
The other Eagle-Owls that have laid are the Turkestan, the Fraser s,
the Cape, and the Abyssinian Spotted. Both the Spectacled
eggs, and the Ceylon Fish Owls have laid a second clutch.

Miss Katharine Tousey, of the Massachusetts Audubon Society,
show ed the film Audubon s America. While, perhaps primarily intended
for showing to ornithologists, it nevertheless contained much of very
considerable interest to aviculturists generally. The film, the joint
effort of a dozen or so photographers, gives a very good idea of the
country through which Audubon made his journeys, pioneer from
the ornithological point, and shows many of the birds he depicted in
his monumental The Birds of America.
Miss Tousey not only gave a running commentary, but showed her
versatility by imitating the call of many of the birds shown. Members
are indebted to Miss Tousey for the opportunity of seeing a very
informative film.

1894-1954 :
The year 1954 marks the Diamond Jubilee of the Avicultural
Society. The Society's Golden Jubilee in 1944 could not, unfortu-
nately, be celebrated owing to the war ; the occasion was, however,
marked by a special Jubilee Supplement of the Avicultural
Magazine.
The President and Council feel that the forthcoming Jubilee should
be commemorated in a manner worthy of the Society. It has, there-
fore, been decided to hold an Avicultural Congress in London,
16th-19th June, 1954.
Invitations to attend are being sent to prominent aviculturists
throughout the world.
During the four days of the Congress there will be visits to the
principal collections, papers will be read, and lunches and dinners
arranged.
This preliminary notice is being given at such an early date in the
hope that as many members as possible will arrange to be present and
give their support to an event certain to add greatly to the Society s
prestige.

Preliminary reports indicate that this will prove to be a bad season
for breeders, of parrakeets at least. The most interesting birth so far
is of a young Moustache Parrakeet, now five weeks old, in the
aviaries of E. N. T. Vane.
The American Pheasant Society has bestowed its greatest distinc-
tion, the title of Master Breeder, on John Willis Steinbeck, of Concord,
California, " for outstanding accomplishment in the field of pheasant
propagation."
Dr. D. S. Newill, Connellsville, Pennsylvania, whose work was also
outstanding, received Honourable Mention.

The smuggling of birds into the United States appears to be greatly
on the increase.
A U.S. attorney has expressed the belief that bird smugglers are
now doing a larger business than narcotics smugglers. A member of
the federal legal staff has said that virtually all the " quality " parrots
and parrakeets are smuggled into the U.S. through Mexico.
The ai rest has recently been announced of three persons said to be
members of an international smuggling ring, "in a million dollar
operation handling 70,000 birds annually." The three were released
on $5,000 bail each at their appearance before the U.S. Commissioner
on charges of conspiring to smuggle tropical birds.
The authorities are determined to prevent illegal importations.
Considerable prominence is given in the Press to prosecutions and a
few recent captions are : " Customs Agents seize 1,100 Birds" from
two smugglers ; " Smuggler sentenced to 6 months for smuggling
304 birds from Mexico " ; " Parrot-smuggler draws $500.00 fine
on charges of smuggling more than 600 parrots into the United
States."
There is a total commercial ban on psittacines, and legally only
not-for-sale pets are allowed to be imported. Persons who have been
outside the U.S. for more than four months are allowed to take in two
such birds each year, provided they have been in their possession the
whole of that time.

Since the second edition of Les Oiseaux by J. Delacour and
M. Legendre, which was published in 1934 and quickly sold out, no
book on aviculture has been published in France. The manual
under review is therefore long overdue and will be greatly welcomed,
particularly by French-speaking aviculturists. As the author states
in his preface, in order that the book may be included in the special
series published by Messrs. N. Boubee, and space is limited, only the
Passeriformes and some families belonging to nearly related orders are
dealt with. Parrots and Doves are not included and the author states
that he hopes to deal with them in a later volume. The collection,
which forms a very diverse group from the avicultural point of view,
contains the species most popular as cage or aviary birds and those
which are of particular interest to aviculturists rather than those
which are rarely imported.
The book is divided into sections, the first containing general remarks
on keeping birds in captivity, and this is followed by chapters on
cages, food, rearing of young birds taken from the nest, mutations,
and illnesses and diseases. After this various species are dealt wiD
individually, a short description of plumage, etc., being given, with
notes on the birds' adaptability to captivity. The book concludes with
a summary of the most important points which must be regarded
when keeping birds in captivity, a full bibliography and an index to
all species under both the popular and scientific names. . .
The book is profusely illustrated with 12 colour plates, depicting
79 species, 53 black and white drawings, and 7 tail pieces by
L. Delapchier. In addition there are 12 half-tone plates which
include some very interesting photographs of cages varying from
the " cages de luxe " of Japan to a cage for a blinded Chaffinch.
Monsieur Legendre has a vast and detailed experience in keeping
birds and the book is full of most valuable information. A foreword
is contributed by Professor J. Berlioz.

. Whilst th e title to this book is most apt it is inclined to give the
impression that this is a re-hash of a very old work, which it most
certainly is not. It may be fairly stated, without fear of contradiction,
that no treatise on this subject has previously dealt with the matter so
concisely, clearly, and in such an interesting manner.
Every reader should peruse the preface carefully, 'it contains some
very useful axioms. Many experienced bird-keepers may well differ
S ,? me s remarks, but if they apply common sense
and allow for individuality in birds, as suggested in his preface, they
will find no cause for real disagreement. It is a book for all bird-
keepers and should be in every aviculturist's collection.
The coloured plates are most helpful to identification, if not of great
artistic worth, but they fulfil their immediate purpose admirably. It is
unfortunate that the wrapper portrays non-existent gems of aviculture,
as this may well result in more knowledgeable bird-keepers jumping to
the conclusion that it is written by someone not well acquainted with
the subject. To those people therefore may I say : " Don't be put off."

BREEDING OF GREY PARROTS IN INDIA

It must be a meat many years ago now that I was told about the Grey Parrots in
India and I am very interested to hear that it was Sir Godfrey Davis who told me
All'l remembered-and I must confess that as I get older my memory gets worse
and worse &amp;apos;--was that a gentleman who had spent some years in India came to
visit our farm, and said that he had been told of someone m India who had such a
prolific pair of Greys that he, as it were, hardly knew what to do with the young ones.
P As I knew from experience how difficult it is even to mate a pair of Greys success-
fully let alone to breed from them, I was naturally sceptical--the more so because,
in mv experience Greys go in for very small clutches of two or three eggs and the
;o U 7g spend a7ry^longtime indeed&quot; in the nest, so one would be most unlikely
noTsure to which article of mine Sir Godfrey refers, but if, in it, I gave the
impression that I thought the story was simply an invention on his P^ I must have
expressed myself very badly, and hasten to apologize for--as the newspapers say
anv inconvenience it m#ty hs-ve censed him * , . r*i &lt; __
Incidentally, I should not have said that being a bad judge of character was
among my many failings, and if I have become a particularly disbelieving fellow,
it may well be because my credulity has been sometimes strained to breaking point
by----to give but one example-some visitor or other to our farm who solemnly assured
me that they had heard of someone who had high hopes of breeding red Canaries
as they had recently bred a brood of Firefinch X Canary hybrids ! Naturally I
assumed that I was intended to treat this as a great joke, until I realized that my
informant took it quite seriously ! Edward

THE PROBLEM OF THIRD BROODS OF PARRAKEETS
My objection to the Duke of Bedford's two suggested methods of preventing a hen
Turauoisine from having three nests is that both tend to risk the second brood,
order to make sure that there shall not be a third. There is, for instance, aiways the
chance that a hen, suddenly left to finish off the rearing of her brood single-handed,
may tire of her task and either give them insufficient food or stop feeding the

can _namely taking away the young ones before they are fully independent of their
parents. Occasionally, if the parents start moulting and neglect them, one is forced
to do this and the young have to learn to feed themselves as best they can, but I
would n5er do it unless(R) was left with no alternative Then, too, they have firs,
to be caught up, and to do this the Duke recommends that one should go in and
net the whole brood as quickly as you can before they have time to do themselves
serious damage " to which--knowing how wildly young Turquoisines batter about
if one so much as approaches their aviary--I can only say, with the late Dr. Joad,
it all depends what you mean by serious damage . t i j
The Duke asks if I can say how many hens I have lost before they P ut
hen's satisfactory record, and if he means, as presumably h " do "',^&quot; |v m ^ e haV f f
I lost through letting them over-breed--the answer is quite definitely no ,
only because all the other hen Turqoisines I have kept were apparently staunc
believers in a particularly rigid form of birth-control . . ,
b I cannot say how many of the young of the third broods have matured into good
breeding stock, because those we kept for breeding purposes were among the fi
young ones the old pair ever reared here, but I can truthfully say that, not in one
single instance was there any sign whatever of weakness or degeneracy among the
third broods. Edward Boosey.

By J. Delacour (Los Angeles, California, U.S.A.)
After nearly twelve years of life in New York City, on the 16th floor
of a Fifth Avenue building, I have moved to California as Director
of the Department of History, Science and Art of the County of Los
Angeles. A main change in my life has resulted from the mildness of
the climate and the consequent possibility of keeping outdoors, with
little trouble, a number of semi-tropical, or tropical, plants and birds.
Last summer I bought a small house in one of the many charming
residential sections of this unusual city, which is really a collection
of suburban towns. Its tree-lined avenues and gardens make it
country-like and attractive. The rare advantage of my new house
is that the garden at the back (the back-yard, as it is called in America)
is crossed by a small natural stream, running all the year round at the
same speed, notwithstanding the six months of dry weather which
Southern California enjoys (more or less !) between May and October.
Such permanent streams are as rare here as they are on the Riviera.
The garden, 300 feet deep, is cut by a deep ravine which has been
skilfully laid out as a rock garden, with a long Japanese bridge crossing
it. Near the house I have made a pond for lotus and blue water-lilies,
and the sunny far end of the garden has been reserved for cacti and
succulents. The rest is nicely shaded by trees, full of camellias and
azaleas. I have added many species of forest palms, ferns, aroids,
bromiliads, orchids, and other interesting plants. It looks like a large
conservatory.
I had, of course, to keep birds. Possibilities, however, were limited.
I did not want to spoil the garden, and in town, noisy things, which
might bother neighbours, are not allowed. At the north side of the
garden, by the house, is a garage which I promptly turned into a
bird house. Nearby, a large window of the sitting-room looked on to
a narrow (10 feet) passage of drab bricks. This was transformed into

an aviary, partly covered with transparent plastic, partly with a
half-inch wire netting roof. It is 12 feet high, 24 feet long, and
including the slice of the garage used as a shelter, 20 feet wide.
Properly laid out and planted it looks really charming, and birds do
well in it. Along the fence, on the north side, there is a full partition
up to 6 feet, and a shelter is provided at the top by a vertical 18 inch
wide strip of plastic with another one of the same width on the roof
of the aviary. No heating is necessary, as frost does not occur there.
This first aviary has a population of finches, one or two pairs each of
most of the Australian species ; Lavenders, Ruddies, and Cordon-
bleus ; Avadavats ; Auroras ; Rainbow Buntings ; Red Hooded
Siskins ; Pintail Nonpareils, etc., about sixty altogether. There are
also pairs of Painted Quails, Mountain Witch, Bartlett's, Silver
Diamond, Talpacoti, and Pigmy Doves ; a Shama ; Giant Whydahs ;
a pair of Bourke's Parrakeets, and a few Sugar Birds. When the
housekeeper, who takes my place in the care of the birds when I travel,
has sufficient experience, more difficult birds will be added, such as
small Tanagers and Sunbirds. As the garden is usually occupied by
wild Humming-birds, it is not necessary to keep any in confinement
where space is very limited. It is a constant delight to watch the birds
from the window which constitutes a useful observation post.
Along the fence following this first aviary is a similar one, 28 feet
long, 10 feet wide. It contains a pair of Palawan Peacock-Pheasants ,
pairs of Harlequin Quails, Bleeding-heart, Ashy and Diamond Doves,
Diamond Sparrows, Australian Crimson Finches, several varieties of
Zebra Finches, Red-crested Finches, Cuban Finches, Indian White-
eyes, and a European Song Thrush.
There was an obvious location for another aviary between the
bridge and the solid fence on the south side of the garden. It was only
a question of roofing over the space between the wall and the bridge,
and of building wire partitions under the bridge and on the sides.
The result is a large flight, 50 feet and 20 feet, very high in the centre
over the stream which flows in a deep gully. I keep there a few small
ducks and teal, Mandarins, Puna and Sharp-winged Teal, Maned
Geese, Lesser Indian Whistling-Ducks ; some doves : Brush Bronze-
wings, Cassin's, Peruvian Ground, Green-winged, Ghiriqui Ground-
Pigeons, and a few other birds such as Pekin Robins, Orange-headed
Thrush, Spectacled Jay-Thrushes, a European Blackbird, Dyal Bird,
Tricoloured Spreos, and Purple-headed Glossy Starlings.
These Californian aviaries are few in number and small in size
compared to those at Cleres and, in the long past, at Villers. But they
are suited to the present circumstances and very attractive, giving
me much pleasure. At past sixty I am just as thrilled as ever by
watching my birds, and I still enjoy caring for them as I did when I
was ten years old. Bird lovers are incorrigible, I am afraid.

BUDGERIGARS AT LIBERTY IN DEVON

<bodyText confidence="0.989177285714286" page_id="58090880"  page_num="Page 117" year="" vol="">
By The Duke of Bedford (Woburn, Bedfordshire, England)
The homing budgerigars at Endsleigh, near Tavistock, have now
entered on their second season and are doing well, losses during the
winter having been few. The foundation stock consisted of a few pairs
of homers from Woburn and purchased untrained birds from two or
three different sources. Of the purchased birds five cocks and three
hens still remain, the rest of the flock, about sixty altogether, being
made up of homing birds from Woburn and young bred in the aviary.
As is usual, the non-homing foundation birds have not given a par-
ticulai ly good account of themselves and of those that remain only
a cock and a hen go in and out of the aviary with any regularity,
the remainder behaving as " non-exits ", i.e. birds which do not go
out at all. I am finding also that for flying at liberty the modern
show type of budgerigar is not so good as a more slender, active, long-
winged bird which would not satisfy the judges. The show budgerigar
is not only apt to be slow-witted, but also slow in flight and, if it should
go out, is more liable to fall a prey to Sparrowhawks which in this
district are very abundant.
As at the beginning of the season I had more cocks than hens in the
aviary, I sent down some spare homing hens from Woburn, intending
to have two breeding teams in succession. The reason for this was that
I had discovered that on no account must the breeding atmosphere "
of an aviary be upset by returning to the " resting " aviary, in the
middle of the summer, all hens that have reared two broods, in order
to prevent overbreeding. I had hoped to turn half the hens from the
resting aviary into the liberty aviary about 15th February, and the
remainder at the end of June when the first lot were returned to the
resting aviary after rearing two broods. The plan, however, did not
work out very satisfactorily either here or at Woburn as, although
the majority of the unmated cocks did not interfere unduly with the
breeding pairs, a few were very troublesome. In order to secure the
double aim of maintaining the breeding atmosphere in the aviary until
autumn while at the same time preventing individual pairs from
overworking themselves, I have now limited, in the case of the adult
birds, not the number of broods but the number of eggs they are
allowed to hatch, and this plan promises to work extremely well.
Those pairs which have reared two full broods are only allowed
to hatch a couple of eggs in any subsequent clutches they may lay
before the end of the season. The rearing of two young is not a serious
strain on any hen budgerigar who has a mate to help her. Indeed,
I think she keeps just as healthy and happy when so engaged as when
condemned to a life of unnatural boredom in the hens' resting aviary.

I 1 8 DUKE OF BEDFORD BUDGERIGARS AT LIBERTY IN DEVON
Seeing that things were not going too well on the double-shift
plan, I decided to take the risk, in mid-May, of adding to the breeding
and liberty aviary nearly all the hens left in the resting aviary. Usually
it is inadvisable to introduce new hens where others are breeding, as
fighting and disturbance are very likely, but in this case fortunately
the new hens, most of which were in heavy moult when put in caused
no serious trouble. This, however, can hardly be said to have been
due to the fact that, being in moult, they were not in breeding condition
for, as always happens if you put moulting, albeit healthy hens in an
aviary where breeding is going on, they immediately stopped moulting
and started to take an interest in the nest-boxes, laying but very
little later than those which are not in moult. It is, of course, well
known that budgerigars, like other birds which nest in colonies, are,
for some strange reason quite unconnected with physical health,
much stimulated to nest by the presence of companions. .My own
view is that a hen budgerigar who would be slow to nest if kept in
an aviary alone with her mate, goes to nest readily in an aviary con-
taining other hens, not because she likes her female companions, but
rather for the opposite reason. Her greatest joy in life is to own a nest
which she knows another hen wants or, failing that, one so near to the
nest of the other hen that she is aware that her proximity will cause
the latter acute annoyance ! This spirit in hen budgerigars is indeed
somewhat akin to that of members of the British public who will
always co-operate together much more loyally and effectively if
inspired by hatred to a common enemy than they can ever be persuaded
to do from the more Christian motive of love of their fellows !
When I first came to Devonshire in the middle of May the actual
display of birds at liberty was a little disappointing. This was partly
due to the fact that this year, like last, the first round of eggs had
hatched rather badly, eight pairs producing only sixteen young birds.
A further cause of trouble was a particularly objectionable Sparrow-
hawk which had been visiting the aviary very regularly and might
have taken one or two of the young birds and driven others away.
Normally a Sparrowhawk has considerable difficulty in capturing
an adult budgerigar, which is too swift and wary, but it will take
young ones not long out of the nest in addition to upsetting the nerves
of the whole aviary. In this particular instance the hawk's visits
had turned practically all the old breeding birds into non-exits as,
discovering that the aviary and its shelter were a safe refuge, they made
up their minds not to leave them, only the venturesome young birds
continuing to fly in and out freely. Although we were never able to
shoot it, the hawk discontinued its visits from the time I arrived and
I set myself to making preparations for discouraging it or ending
its career should it feel tempted to return. One quite useful method of
discouragement is an effective scarecrow properly clothed, constructed,

<bodyText confidence="0.999218955555555" page_id="58090882"  page_num="Page 119" year="" vol="">
and managed. The usual coat and hat on a stick left always in the same
place are quite useless and even the shyest birds soon ignore them.
To be of any real value a scarecrow must be decently dressed (!) ;
its raiment, preferably showy, should be changed from time to time,
as also, at fairly frequent intervals, should be its location, so that
birds never come to accept it as an unvarying feature in the landscape.
Most important of all is it that its face should have a pleasingly or
unpleasingly human expression, for it is this particular feature which,
more than any other, attracts the attention of birds and creates
alarm.
With regard to methods of destroying the hawk, the gun is, of
course, useful if the hawk's visits will only coincide with the periods
which someone can devote to waiting for it. The only two effective
hawk traps I know of are the pole-trap which is illegal, cruel, and
likely to catch the wrong bird ; and the box-trap, on the model of
what used to be known as Black's hawk-trap. This consists of a kind of
large box of wire netting on a wooden frame. It has a false bottom
divided from the upper part with wire netting and an open lid or top
connected with a strong spring and a kind of perch inside the trap.
In the bottom of the trap live sparrows are placed, in endeavouring
to reach which by jumping on to an interior perch the hawk dislodges
it and causes the spring to operate, bringing down the roof of the trap
and leaving it a prisoner. The chief objection to a trap of this kind
is that it is rather hard on the " bait ", for Passer domesticus resents
confinement so much more than other finch-like species that even I,
who dislike him intensely, do not care to subject him to it for any length
of time. In order to retain the advantages of the box-type of hawk-
trap while eliminating the objections, I have invented an arrange-
ment which, for its upper portion, has all the normal features, while the
lower one consists of a roomy flight cage, or miniature aviary flight
communicating with a comfortable shelter. In this small aviary
I have put some Roller canaries which are very happy and contented
in what are, for their kind, palatial quarters and which, should the
hawk attempt an assault upon them cannot, of course, receive any
injury.
The second round of young budgerigars which have now been
flying for some weeks have provided an extremely lovely show as
among them are some very attractive colours--opaline blues, lutinos,
lemons, and rainbows. A lady visitor seeing them described it as
"just like fairyland", a rather apt simile, for there is something
close to Nature and yet unique and " unnatural " in its dainty beauty,
in the spectacle at liberty of a small flock of graceful little birds, all
of the same species yet of quite different and brilliant colours.
Budgerigars, especially young birds a few weeks out of the nest, are
particularly delightful in flight as they circle round and round like

contribution but, being less frisky and playful than the young and
much taken up with domestic duties, they fly less frequently and
continually, indulging for the most part in an early morning con-
stitutional before returning to the aviary for the family duties of the
day.

THE CAUSE AND CURE OF EYE-DISEASE
By P. H. Hastings (Portsmouth, England)
Having recently rejoined the Avicultural Society, I was very
interested in the article by Dr. F. B. Lake on the Parrakeet Eye Disease.
It appears to me by the description of the symptoms and drawings,
identical with the condition found in a great number of freshly imported
birds, especially insectivorous species.
For over thirty years I have been an importer of livestock from the
tropics, specializing more in the insectivorous species than seed-
eaters. During this period I would say that probably several thousands
of birds have arrived with the disease in various stages. The Starling
group appears to have a very large percentage with this complaint and
another species in which it seems prevalent is the Pekin Robin.
In my early days it was my general practice, and I believe of other
importers, painlessly to destroy the badly affected birds as no cure was
known. However, about 1928 the manufacturing chemists with whom I
was dealing for essential food ingredients, forwarded to me a copy of the
book entitled The Survey of Vitamins , published by H.M. Medical
Research Council in which there was an illustration of a rat suffering
from this eye complaint and described as follows :--
The first symptom observed is a swelling of the eyelids which is
followed by an inflamed condition of the conjunctiva. Haemorrhagic
and purulent discharges follow : the cornea becomes affected and
ultimately blindness results. This seemed to me to be identical with
the conditions I had observed in birds, and in this and subsequent
publications, the disease is called Xerohthalmia and is proved beyond
doubt to be the result of malnutrition, particularly and most conclu-
sively in the lack of Vitamin A in the diet.
On the very day I read this paragraph, I received a rather large
consignment of Starlings, and in the Spreo species particularly there were
several very bad cases, and others with a more mild condition. I
decided to put the information to a practical test. I isolated three
cases which had very swollen eyes, almost as large as garden peas,

birds which in the normal way I would have destroyed at once.
At about 4 p.m. I gave each bird three drops of best cod liver oil
direct into the throat, and by about 8 p.m. there was a marked improve-
ment in that the irritation seemed to have subsided, the birds dis-
continuing to rub their heads on the perch. I gave another three
drops to each bird at about io p.m. that evening. The next morning,
being very anxious to note improvement if any, I got up at 7 a.m., and
went straight to the birdhouse. I was simply astounded at the result,
all swelling had disappeared, the eyes were bright and full and there
was no sign of the complaint other than the bareness around the
eyes, caused by the continual rubbing.
Since then, as stated, I have had innumerable cases and in one
particular consignment of Pekins I had about a hundred suffering
with the complaint in various degrees, the worst I treated with a few
drops into the beak, and the more mild cases were rapidly cured by
normal feeding. In my whole experience since that first example
of the cure, I cannot recall a single failure. In more recent years
I have used Halibut Oil, as it is more potent, and a couple of drops into
the beak will cure or rapidly cause a change for the better, the com-
plete cure following with normal feeding with nutritious food. The
rapid recovery of serious cases after the treatment has never failed to
intrigue me.
In 1932 I wrote about this disease in the Avicultural Magazine
and as a result of my article I was called in to the Hundridge
Game Farm, at Hambledon, to treat seven pheasants which had the
complaint. I gave a pen-filler to each bird direct into the beak. I
was phoned the next day and informed that all birds were normal
again and was thanked profusely.
I have also found this disease in mammals and quite recently I was
asked to call at a neighbours to treat a young greyhound of fourteen
weeks. It was explained to me that the dog had, it seemed, knocked
its head and there was a great swelling ; it had been taken to a vet
and some lotion was given for bathing the swelling. I went along
and directly I saw the condition I said, malnutrition. They looked
askance, being kindly folk, and said they were feeding as instructed
by the breeder. The left eye was completely closed, the head on that
side being twice as large as it should be, the right eye was not so badly
affected, and the skin around the left eye bare of fur by continual
rubbing. I gave the dog three Halibut Oil capsules at 8 p.m., and
left two more for the owner to give before retiring. As in the case of
the birds, recovery was phenomenal, the next morning there being no
sign of any disease, swelling wholly disappeared and the puppy lively
and skipping about in play. Other than the general thinness of the
puppy and the bareness around the eye, no one would have ever
believed it was in such a state the previous evening.

It does not appear that Dr. Lake has treated this condition in
parrakeets as a vitamin deficiency disease. Should he have the oppor-
tunity of experimenting further, perhaps he will consider the treatment
I have described. If any of our members have birds with such con-
ditions, I would be pleased to endeavour to cure them, but I feel sure
that if the treatment given above is carried out by any fancier, a cure
will be effected and the chance of prolonged and painful suffering
prevented.
I trust the information given will be instrumental in saving many
birds the painful suffering caused by this affliction.

By Derek Goodwin (Virginia Water, Surrey, England)
It was by merest chance that I first acquired this most delightful
species. I was visiting a bird-dealer's in order to purchase some
Glossy Starlings on behalf of a friend and whilst there could not
refrain from looking round at his wares. Three Lanceolated Jays
(Garrulus lanceolatus ) at once attracted my attention. Two were
sharing a cage and looking rather dejected, the third, caged alone, was
in still worse plight, having one foot swollen to the size of a small
crab-apple. On inquiry I was told that the latter would be sold to
street traders who, so I gathered, make a weekly round of animal
dealers and buy up cheap all the birds, puppies, etc., that are likely
to die, for sale in the street markets on Sunday. As the dealer honestly
admitted that he would only get a pound for the sick bird I paid over
this sum and took it away, thinking that at least it would now be able
to die unharassed.
Arrived home the crippled Jay ate mealworms eagerly and its death
appeared less certain. I at once became the prey of conflicting impulses.
On the one hand I had little cash and little spare aviary space (although
shortly the loss of two young Magpies which joined up with a wild
family and went off with them partly solved the latter problem),
and so it would be folly to get more birds. On the other hand, would
it not be cruel to keep the one Jay in solitude ? and how much could
I expect to learn of its behaviour from a solitary bird ? Personal
inclination thus rallied both science and sentiment to its aid, as it so
often does, and the result was a foregone conclusion. The dealer
agreed to sell the other two Jays for six pounds, in view of their poor
condition, and even threw in a very excellent wicker travelling cage
in which he dispatched them to me.

I was pleased to find that although somewhat thin, and in very
scruffy plumage the two sound Jays did not appear to be sick in
any way. I gave them plenty of mealworms, dug up a few cockchafer
grubs foi them on most days, added vitamin supplements to their soft-
food (wholemeal sop), and gave them rather more meat than I would
otheiwise give a Jay. On this regime they soon showed vast improve-
ment, although it was not until after the moult that they came into
their full beauty of perfect plumage. It was early May when I got
these birds. The crippled specimen became dominant over the other
two and soon showed much improvement and its swollen foot went
back to normal size, although incapable of use except as a " peg-leg ",
Actually, however, this would appear to have been just a dormant
stage of the trouble afflicting it, as it died only fifteen months later.
In August, when the Jays were in moult, I acquired two more.
These weie picked out from six that a dealer had in a small outdoor
aviary. Until that time I had had only a vague idea of the sex of my
three birds but when the two newcomers were put in the aviary they
at once took precedence over the original occupants, thus leading
me to suspect, as later proved correct, that they were two cocks and
the others all hens. They were colour-ringed and afterwards became
known thereby : Green male, Yellow male, Red female, White female,
and the Crippled hen. In December I acquired a sixth bird, which
was given a blue ring and also turned out to be a hen.
Since nothing very exciting happened in the winter months I may
here digress to give a brief description of this splendid bird for the
benefit of those who do not know it. It is a smaller and more slightly
built bird than our common Jay (Garrulus glandarius) with a pro-
poitionately longer tail and crest. It is a little larger than a Blue
Jay (Cyanocitta cristata ) and with rather similar pattern on wings
and tail. The general body colour is a soft pinkish grey. The head and
crest are black, the lanceolate throat feathers are white with black
bases, those of the lower throat being black with white shaft-streaks,
and those of the upper breast steel grey with white shaft-streaks.
The wings and tail (when at rest) show mainly a soft, delicate blue,
barred with black, the tail feathers and secondaries have black sub-
terminal bands and broad white tips, and there is a white patch on the
wing coveits. The bill is an odd greenish grey and the eyes dark
brown. In its gait and skilful flight among branches this bird possibly
excels our Common Jay in agility. When in good condition its
plumage has a wonderful bloom comparable to that on a ripe plum
or a leally fit Java Sparrow (Padda origivora ). It may indeed be said
of it, as Goldsmith said of the Swan, that " The eye wanders over it
with insatiable pleasure and every part takes on a new grace with each
new movement ".
In its call-notes this species clearly shows its close relationship

to the Common Jay, the majority of its utterances being similar in
sound and meaning. It is also an excellent and habitual mimic,
and its soft warbling sub-song is composed largely of copied notes,
as is the case with our bird. I have dealt elsewhere (Goodwin, 1952)
more fully with a comparison of the voice and display of the two species.
By March the two male Jays, Green and Yellow, were giving their
soft warbling sub-songs very frequently, and beginning also to indulge
in somewhat louder mimicry. They uttered all sorts of bubbling,
whistling, and mewing notes, some of them possibly imitations of various
wild birds in their native Himalayas, although some, such as the calls
of the Golden Pheasant, human whistling, and the whining bark of the
next-door spaniel, had clearly been learnt since their capture. The
females gave some whispering sub-song, but no loud and definite
mimicry was established as coming from them. On 2nd March
Green escaped, dashed off between the house and an outbuilding,
and vanished somewhere in the front garden. I spent a fruitless and
despairing few minutes vainly looking for him in near-by trees, but on
returning to the aviary I found he had preceded me and was flying
round trying to get back in. Needless to say I co-operated with his
endeavours and he was soon safely under lock and key again.
Courtship-feeding was first seen on 23rd March, when Yellow fed
the Crippled hen and Green fed White. From then on it was frequent
and usually initiated by the male. He would take some food, prepare
it for swallowing, then, holding it in his throat, would commence to
give the food-offering note--a long-drawn, husky version of the usual
mewing appeal-call--and approach the female. She would usually
respond before taking the food, by displaying with head held up and
making little sideways movements, uttering soft " chip-chip-chip "
notes. This display, which is also often given by the male before or
after courtship-feeding, is essentially of a placatory or appeasing nature.
It can be considered as, in a sense, the opposite of the male's typical
display, in which he erects his crest and most of the body-feathers and
presents himself laterally, reaching forward on his perch and uttering
a " display-phrase " which may consist of copied sounds. This display
is used both towards the mate and towards rivals, and in the latter
context is threatening in character. In the Common Jay both sexes
use this display, but in the Lanceolated Jay I have only rarely seen it---
at low intensity--given by a female.
From the end of March on the two male birds displayed extremely
frequently, chiefly to each other, perching a foot apart and each
making himself look as imposing as possible in an unsuccessful attempt
to overawe his rival. It was noticeable that although Green still
gave way to the dominant male Yellow at bath or food dish, yet
when they were both in displaying mood he refused to be intimidated by
him. When displaying the males usually uttered a soft, piping,

sibilant " Tsee-tsee-tsee-up ! " sometimes a loud, husky mewing note
(probably homologous with the hissing sounds that male Common
Jays usually incorporate in their display-phrases), and occasionally
the " Kraah " note, or copied sounds. On one occasion when Yellow
was in a state of intense angry excitement he displayed at Green
screeching out a loud imitation of the " crow " of a cock Golden
Pheasant. Green, as if not to be outdone, displayed back at him,
barking loudly (imitation of a dog) as he did so.
On 17th April I separated the two pairs (the odd hens had been
removed previously) and placed Green and White in an open aviary
about 40 feet by 20, leaving Yellow and the Crippled hen in a smaller
aviary about 28 by 9, with a shelter shed about 5 by 5 attached.
Once the birds were separated the males displayed much less often
and less intensely.
Within a couple of days I noticed that Green and his mate were
taking much interest in the upper branches of a small apple tree which
had been cut off and placed in a slanting position in one corner of
the aviary. At 7 p.m. I fixed some wire netting in a fork about 7 feet
high in such a way that a bowl-shaped support was formed. The male
soon came back to the tree. Hopping about the branches he came on
the artificial nest-site. He at once entered it, turning round and
giving the soft chirruping notes. The hen flew to him, and perched
on the edge, they chirruped and gave the " chin-up " display together.
Green picked up and dropped nesting material shortly after, but he
did not carry any to the nest-site till the following day. Thereafter
he did some building each day. He appeared to have great difficulty
in selecting suitable material. In a wild state this species is said to line
its nest with the long black rhizoids of a fungus (Whistler, 1928) and
although my birds finally achieved a beautiful nest from twigs, heather
stems, rootlets, and coconut fibre the male at any rate would discard
numberless pieces of material before finding one that suited him. For
a long time little tangible result seemed to accrue from his efforts,
but on the 30th April much more solid work was evidently done on
the nest and it looked near completion. I suspect that the female did
some building, as on the morning of 3rd May I found her on the nest
at 7-4* a *m. She soon flew off, collected some fibres from the ground,
flew to the nest-site, but seeing me looking flew off again. Otherwise
she was never seen either with building material or at the nest during
its construction. She gave the impression of being utterly disinterested
in the male's building efforts, but if I went near the nest and looked
at it she would " give the game away " by flying up to perch a foot or
so away and screaming angrily at me. It was noticeable that when not
building the male also kept away from the nest, although previous to its
commencement both birds had been constantly in the tree that held it.
From 3rd May the hen began to beg like a young bird, uttering the

juvenile version of the appeal call and (sometimes) fluttering her
wings. She begged constantly, giving her pleading " childish "
cry every twenty seconds or so, even continuing to do so when she was
actually eating. Her mate was not thereby moved to feed her any more
frequently than he had been doing for the past three weeks.
She went on the nest at about 6.15 a.m. on 5th May, and was
still sitting when I left home at 7.45, but when I got back in the evening
she was off the nest, which was empty. Next morning she again went
on the nest. No eggs had been laid at 7.45 that morning when, unable
to bear the suspense, I put her off the nest and felt in it. Presumably
she laid later that morning, however, as she was sitting when I got
home that evening and at 7 p.m. on 7th May there were two eggs in
nest. Two more followed at daily intervals. The eggs were of no par-
ticularly beauty, being merely small editions of the eggs of the Common
Jay in appearance.
For some days I was torn between a rational assumption that " the
Powers that be " would never vouchsafe to me the luck to be the first
person to breed this species, and an irrational optimism that I should
in fact succeed in so doing. As day followed day and all seemed well,
wild hopes began to get the upper hand of cold reason as, luckily
for human peace of mind, they commonly do. The female sat on the
nest continuously from the time the first egg was laid. She came off
several times daily for periods of up to ten minutes--but usually
much less--to exercise, bathe, and preen herself. The male fed her
both on and off the nest, she received the food with juvenile notes and
wing-flutterings. Often she would leave the nest immediately after
having taken food from the male and whilst he was still at the nest.
When this happened he never stayed to guard, much less to cover the
eggs, but at once flew off after his mate.
On the fourteenth morning from the laying of the last egg I felt
it must be a case of " any moment now ". I was well prepared for the
hoped-for happy events. I had a large stock of mealworms that had
been fed, if not on the fat of the land at least in part on the fat of
the sea (food treated with C.L.O.), and had also bought a supply of
Kentish Glory caterpillars, the entomological dealers having had no
cheaper and more mundane species for sale at that time. I may
say I am well aware of the danger of presuming on the kindness of
Fate, but when young birds are on the way one cannot abide by the
wise adage " not to fill one's jar with water till one has caught a fish ".
On that morning I gave Green some insects and watched carefully when
he fed White with them. She accepted them as usual, and did not look
beneath her before swallowing them, so I gathered that even though the
eggs might be chipped it was not likely that any were yet hatched.
When I returned that evening the first thing I noticed was White
off the nest. My heart sank. I guessed instantly what had happened.

Then I tried to believe that she was only off for exercise, she would
soon go back. Needless to say she did nothing of the kind, and the
nest, on inspection, proved to be empty, and clean as the proverbia
Presumably the birds, or more probably only the female, had eaten
the hatching eggs, or new-hatched young. This behaviour is known
to happen not rarely with insect-eating birds in captivity and I have
strong grounds for suspecting that it may occasionally occur in the wild.
It is due not I think to the bird's reproductive urge suddenly dying
away (which would result in the nestlings being treated as any other
small creature), but rather to a hypertrophy or perversion of the
strong instinct which such birds show to keep the nest clean by eating
all extraneous objects (eggshells, faeces, fallen leaves, etc.), that appear
in it Probably this only happens when some disturbing influence has
upset the sitting bird. In the case of these Jays there was a loud and
noisy party in the adjoining garden on the fateful day and this may have
disturbed them.
The behaviour of the pair that evening showed that they were m
some mental stress. Both, but especially the male, kept returning to
the nest and looking into it as if they could not convince themselves
that it was really empty. When I went near the nest the female came
dashing up and scolded at me just as she had before. Quite clearly she
did not in any way correlate her eating of the eggs with their mysterious
disappearance ! She begged constantly to her mate, but Green,
instead of feeding her, snapped at her angrily and sometimes even
attacked her. This was not, of course, because he thought that she was
responsible for the loss of the eggs (as no doubt she was) but simply
that his bereavement had put him in an aggressive mood, and it needed
only slight stimulus for him to vent his feelings on his mate in default
of any other victim. Homologous behaviour in other bipeds is, of
course, not uncommon.
Next morning the pair had got over their loss and the male was once
more feeding his mate solicitously. He was still in breeding condition
and within a few days was building a second nest in a basket fixed in a
tree at the opposite end of the aviary. White, to my dismay, showed
no interest whatever in the new nest. She ceased to beg in juvemle
manner and showed less enthusiasm for courtship-feeding. A day or
two later, as she was preening, a tail feather came away in her bill.
She held it for a second or two with that puzzled " Good God ! am
I falling to pieces ? " expression which Jays often show when this
happens, and I knew that all chance of her breeding again that year
was gone. . . ,
Whilst all this had been going on Yellow and his mate the Gripple
hen had, up to a point, shown similar behaviour. This female never
showed the slightest signs of wishing to nest but she had commenced

to beg in juvenile manner at the same time as White had done. Although
this begging coincided with the breeding season I think it may not
have been caused by the reproductive drive. This bird gradually
wasted away until she died in August and it seems possible that her
illness induced in her a similar psychological mood of " dependence "
to that normally aroused in an incubating female. Infantile behaviour
(or perhaps one should rather say behaviour that is normally shown
most strongly in infancy) by adult animals that are in a weak state
through hunger or sickness is not infrequent, one need look no further
than man and the domestic Pigeon to see examples of it. The male
Yellow frequently carried nesting material about the aviary and
deposited some of it in an artificial site inside the shelter, where
perhaps he would have nested had his mate shown a reciprocal interest.
I must confess that I made very few observations on the two females
Blue and Red during this time, so I am not sure if they showed any
breeding behaviour. They certainly did not pair together.
On 10th June, in the early evening, I put the other four birds into
the large aviary with Green and White. These two showed some
aggression towards the newcomers, displaying at them and attacking
them, but they were not systematic or persistent about it and soon
ceased to do so. Next morning Yellow displayed near Green's first
nest-site, and the female Blue, who was near, at once responded
with the chin-up display. Green, observing this, flew up, drove off
Yellow, and went into display himself. Blue, acting on the proverb
about the brave and the fair, then displayed submissively to him. He
hopped into the nest site and pecked (? low-intensity building move-
ment) at a twig. Blue at once showed great excitement, she hopped
to the edge of the site, gave most intense versions of the chin-up
display and quivered her tail violently. Green did not respond, how-
ever, but remained " true " to his old mate. Within a few weeks
all were in moult and all hopes of breeding from them that year
were over. They are now (12th February, 1953) showing signs of
awakening sexual activity once more, and I live in hope, though
hardly in expectation, that I shall have better luck with them in 1953.
So far as one can judge from what has been written about this bird
its habits in freedom (Ali, 1949 ; Whistler, 1928) would appear to be
very similar to those of the Common Jay. Its movements are very
similar and it has the same manner of commonly hopping about with
the tail slightly raised and the tips of both wings lying on the same side
of the tail, which gives it a very jaunty appearance. It hides surplus
food--especially nuts and acorns--in the same way, pushing it into
the ground and then carefully covering it up or else sticking it into
some crevice or hole above the ground. It remembers where it has
hidden its booty and in a wild state probably relies largely on previously
hidden acorns for its winter food.

My Lanceolated Jays are fond of sun-bathing which they do--
usually on the ground--in the typical passerine manner. The bird
leans over to one side with feathers fluffed out, crest erect, and com-
monly with wing and tail on side nearest the sun somewhat spread.
Bathing, preening, and scratching are also performed in the typical
passerine manner. At night my birds roost well hidden in the foliage
of Cupressus trees, or in conifer branches fixed in the aviary. They go
to roost early (unless some alarm or excitement at the normal roosting
time inhibits them from so doing) whilst it is still perfectly light and
once on their roosting perches do not come off again that evening
unless greatly disturbed. Even giving mealworms to a companion
still up will seldom induce a roosting bird to come out, although
if in such a case it is deliberately driven out it will at once commence to
feed readily. Doubtless this behaviour has protective value in the wild
state by rendering the roosting bird less liable to be discovered by owls
or other crepuscular or nocturnal enemies.
In captivity I have found this bird as hardy and easy to cater for
as the Common Jay. Many bird-keepers, scientists and laymen alike,
seem to find difficulty in keeping Jays in good condition. Primarily
I think this is because they often try to feed them on horrible mixtures
of ground-up dog biscuit, eked out with lumps of horsemeat, and with
the addition of chopped-up root vegetables more suitable for cows
than for corvids. Such a diet may suit Crows and Ravens (at any rate
in zoos where they obtain all sorts of extras from the public) fairly well,
but I have never known a Jay to thrive on such a regime. For these
birds a variety of foods is necessary (though no doubt if their exact
food requirements were fully known a suitable artificial food could be
concocted). Acorns, which are appreciated just as much when
sprouting as when fresh, form an excellent staple as long as they can be
obtained, and with a little trouble the Jay-keeper should be able to lay
in a stock in autumn to last him till February or March. At other times
wholemeal sop, dry wholemeal bread, chestnuts, peanuts, etc., can
make up the bulk of the food (and should be used to vary it even
when acorns are plentiful). This should be varied with any insects
obtainable, small pieces of meat (horse or otherwise, cooked or raw),
cooked (scrambled) egg, and cheese. These extras are best fed by hand
and only as much as the birds will swallow on the spot, as owing to the
amount of dirt that will adhere to them it is not desirable that they
should be hidden for future consumption which they otherwise will
be. For the oft maligned mealworm I have nothing but praise.
Doubtless if they are inadequately fed they do not contain sufficient
vitamins, but I cannot help thinking that much of the objection to
them arises from that puritan streak that makes some people think
that anything that a creature--be it man or bird--obviously delights
in must be bad for it. I try to give all my Jays a feed of mealworms

at least once or twice a week--more often when they are moulting--
and if I were wealthier I would certainly give them a larger supply of
these insects. Among the many wild insects that Jays relish may be
mentioned cockchafers which, during the few May-days that they are
on the wing, may be caught in numbers clinging about the street
lamps after dark. Lay observers of the aviculturist capturing them
are, however, apt to think that he is either mad, drunk, or attempting
to sabotage the lighting system. Jays are fond of fruit, oranges and
apples are best liked and cheapest, they do not like soft fruits enough
to warrant the price, although if one grows one's own they can be
given. Elderberries are the only wild fruit they seem keen on. Needless
to say one must use one's intelligence in feeding, add vitamin supple-
ments to the soft food if considered necessary and allow plenty of
animal food to growing young birds (these cannot at first digest nuts or
acorns) and recently purchased adults that are thin and run down.
Leafmould (the top surface layer from woodland) makes an excellent
floor covering for Jays and gives them ample scope for food burying.
In large aviaries natural turf looks nice, but is apt to grow so long that
the Jays will seldom descend into it. I sprinkle plenty of powdered lime
about before putting down fresh leafmould, and put lime frequently
under roosting perches and elsewhere where the ground is likely to be
much fouled.
Plenty of fresh water for bathing and drinking must always be
available. Anting is another instinctive impulse which should be
catered for, though few aviculturists give their birds the opportunity
to indulge it. A sack of wood-ants (just shovel nest, ants, and all into
a sack) tipped out on the floor of the aviary every three weeks or so in
summer will provide a most interesting spectacle for their owner as
well as gratifying the birds. It is of interest that the Lanceolated Jay
acts in the usual manner, picking up the ants in its bill and bringing
forward one wing at a time, whereas the Common Jay brings forward
both wings at a time with a peculiar shuddering movement, spreads
them widely with the primaries brushing the ground and does not pick
up ants in its bill, although it makes head movements that look at a
distance as if it is doing so.
Note .--The sketches illustrating this article are only intended to
give a general idea of some characteristic postures. No attempt has
been made at accuracy of fine detail. The discerning will, for instance,
note a regrettable discrepancy in the number of tail bars in the
different drawings, and if they want to know how many the bird in
fact possesses I fear they must visit their nearest museum and look
at a stuffed one !

<bodyText confidence="0.9768863" page_id="58090897"  page_num="Page 134" year="" vol="">
By Stanton Phillips (Long Beach, California, U.S.A.)
A correct interpretation of the actions of any waterfowl as little
known as the Peruvian Torrent Duck is difficult. This is particularly
true when the bird involved demonstrates an apparently large variety
of behaviour patterns. With this in mind I submit the following
observation :--
It was originally my intention in going to Peru to capture and keep
in captivity the Peruvian Torrent Duck. In pursuit of this end a group
was formed in Lima consisting of Dr. Ortiz de la Puente, Director of
the birds and mammals section of the Javier Prado Museum of Natural
History; Mr. Luis Riva, engineer and amateur ornithologist ;
and myself.
Reaching Yacca, a hacienda at 2,500 metres on the Rio Canete,
we established camp. The river was swollen as are most Andean
streams during the month of January and, since this made the use of
our nets impracticable, we contented ourselves with whatever observa-
tions were possible. Mr. Riva and I were walking on a small hill
downstream when, at a distance of approximately 500 feet before us,
we saw a mature drake poised motionless on a jutting midstream
rock. We seated ourselves, focused binoculars, and waited. With
great dignity it bowed deeply, at the same time pushing the tip
of its tail upward to a height exceeding that of its vertically extended
neck and head. The entire action appeared to be pendulum-like
with the feet serving as inverted fulcrums. After each such four
or five second performance, it would resume its usual stance which
was marked only by an occasional turn of the head. It would then
advance 6 to 12 inches and perform again. With about fifteen of these
completed it had reached the end of the rock and abruptly flew cross-
stream into the less torrential side waters. Here it disappeared.
Our temptation to believe that we were the objects of the display
was somewhat dispelled when, after arriving within 50 feet of the rock,
we discovered a mature female standing on a portion of the rock
where our original point of observation made such discovery impossible.
We observed her for about ten minutes and, although she could see
our every movement, she gave no sign of fear. She finally and leisurely
slipped into the water and floated downstream.
The stimulating agent for the drake's conduct could be anything,
of course, including the aforementioned female, ourselves, a twig
in the throat, or maybe another female. It was probably the
latter.

In the January-February number of the Avicultural Magazine
I was already able to lift the edge of the curtain concerning the
Louise Hall, the new birdhouse of Wassenaar Zoo. When this article
appears the Louise Hall will be open and I would like to take my
readers for a walk through this new building.
When entering the birdhouse we are at once confronted with the
large centre aviaries which are approximately 3* feet long and wide
and about 14 feet high. All of them are planted with various types
of vegetation which is gradually changing. The first aviary contains a
marvellous pair of Lesser Birds of Paradise which in this large enclosure
can freely use their power of flight. It is a very beautiful sight indeed
to see these birds, but imagine the sight of half a dozen fully feathered
Quetzals flying in all their beauty in the tree-tops of the next aviary !
Dierenpark " Wassenaar " was one of the first zoos that ever had
Quetzals in its collection, but one must see these beautiful birds here
in quite natural surroundings fully to grasp their beauty.
The next centre aviary contains quite a number of species of
Touracos, among which there are a Senegal Violet Plantain-eater
(Musophaga violacea ), some White-breasted Touracos ( Corythaixoides
leucogaster ) (labelled Touraco Gymnoschizorhis personata), and Guinea
Touracos ( Turacus persa). Victoria Crowned Pigeons, together with
Indian Blue Rollers and Cotton Teal inhabit the next enclosure.
Knot-willows are the favourite resting-place of the Rollers, in
their beautiful flight range above the Pigeons and Teal, which are
chiefly confined to the lower part. A small pond extends into a creek
in the next aviary, where the vegetation gives the impression of a
swamp and where various species of Plover-like birds and Rallidae are
to be seen with various Fruit Pigeons and other colourful birds in the
tree-tops. Trumpeters, Red-billed Curassows, Piping Grows, and
various smaller Hornbills are found in the aviaries. Stretching along
both sides of the birdhouse are forty-eight smaller aviaries, generally
about 5 feet wide and 10 feet long, in which we find a great number of
very rare species. There are both the Scarlet Cock-of-the-Rock and
the normal Cock-of-the-Rock, both in splendid condition, Red ( Para-
disea rubra), Wilson's ( Schlegelia wilsonii ), King, and Magnificent Birds
of Paradise, European Bee-eaters, various Toucans and Toucanets,
Indian Sunbirds, Humming Birds, numerous Tanagers, and an
impressive collection of Lories and Lorikeets as well as Australian
parrakeets.
It would be too much to give separately the names of all these
species, but I cannot remember ever having seen a more complete

collection. Needless to say that these smaller aviaries are planted
with various bushes and flowers (except, of course, those that contain
parrot-like birds), and in doing so the utmost care was taken to
consider the biological needs of the birds.
In addition to these larger enclosures approximately forty smaller
cages are reserved for single birds, most of them parrots. Among them
Golden Conures, Hawk-headed Parrots, Crimson-breasted Gonures
(.Pyrrhura rhodogaster ), and Levaillant's Barbets.
At the farthest side of the birdhouse the vegetation of the central
aviaries is gradually replaced by towering rocks containing some large
aquaria for cold water fish and at the same time concealing a bird
kitchen and food store. There is also a modern hospital room with
laboratory.
The former birdhouse is now being rebuilt and will chiefly contain
the larger species of parrots, such as the rare Kea (Nestor

By Major H. R. Hendy (Mbabana, Swaziland, S. Africa)
I have travelled in most parts of the world, but in my opinion
Swaziland surpasses them all in climate and scenic beauty. Frost is
very rare indeed, and though in the summer it inclines to be warm,
the evenings are always cool. The climate is most suitable for the
rearing of birds, especially Pheasants. Of these I have a large collec-
tion, amounting at the present time to twenty species. These include
Monals, Brown and Blue Eared Manchurians, Versicolors, Germain's
Peacocks, Blacknecks, Mongolians, Chinese, Melanistic Mutants,
Whites, Goldens, Silvers, Lady Amherst's, Elliot's, Cheers, Nepal
Kaleegs, Swinhoes, Siamese Firebacks, and Reeves's. I should very
much like to have Tragopans and other species of Firebacks.
To look after my Pheasants and other birds which I shall mention
later, I have five native boys under an Induna or headboy, and it is
a constant daily task to supervise them and keep things clean and
sanitary. I must, however, go at least once a month to Johannesburg
which is 235 miles away where is my business and where I must stay
for periods ranging from a few days to two weeks. On account of
these necessary absences I have at times lost valuable stock. Without
my business, however, I could not afford what in South Africa is an
expensive hobby. It has the added advantage that it prevents me
growing old too quickly. I do not know what I would do without it,
and one of my greatest joys is to receive letters from different parts
of the world where I have written to for rare birds, from Singapore,

for instance, whence may come the fabulous Argus Pheasant. Yet
when I return from Johannesburg I invariably find I have lost birds
due to the inability of the native boys ever to discern signs of sickness
or that a bird is off its feed.
Once a week every pen and house, and I have over a hundred, is
sprayed with D.D.T., and every day without exception every pen
is raked and cleaned of all manure and stale food. During the breeding
season I employ a small boy or Unfaam to do nothing else but walk
round all the pens and collect the eggs, for egg-eating can become
a serious habit, and this is the only way I know to prevent it. Every
egg is marked with the number of the pen and the date, and is then
stamped with the name of the species of Pheasant. To hatch these
eggs I have built two large circular pens, each containing twelve
smaller pens, each consisting of a small house and run. I put the
broodies in these smaller pens for a couple of nights to make sure
they want to sit, and I then place the Pheasant eggs under them.
I use as broodies White Silkies, Light Sussex, and good old Kaffir
hens, which are always going broody, and which are of all colours,
shapes, and sizes, having been bred by the natives for many genera-
tions. I make sure they are free of any disease.
A complete record is kept of all the eggs under each hen, and the
day they are due to hatch out. The moment the chicks are hatched,
they are whisked away to brooders, all of which have an enclosed
outdoor run. These brooders are paraffin-heated, as the electric
supply here is uncertain, especially during the severe lightning storms
which we have. At the height of the breeding season I have as many
as forty or fifty hens sitting at one time. The overflow from the
round pens is accommodated in nests specially built in a large room.
Feeding presents a problem. We have no balanced ration especially
made by manufacturers for Pheasants. We can obtain a balanced
ration for poultry, but it does not contain ingredients essential for
Pheasants. Fortunately, however, my property is surrounded by
hundreds of ant heaps, so I can give my newly-born chicks plenty
of ants and their eggs. They just eat these by the thousand, and
thrive wonderfully, and this is all they eat for the first few days. They
always have biscuit meal mixed with raw liver, calcium, Vetemul
(Vitamin A and D), egg custard, and the yolk of hard boiled egg.
In addition they get finely-chopped lettuce. After four weeks I give
them the balanced poultry chick mash to which I add buck wheat,
Kaffir corn, wheat, millet, and barley. The ants, however, seem to
remain their favourite food until they are weaned and placed in the
larger outdoor pens.
I pinion most birds at about six weeks old.
This last season I tried the experiment of selling some Pheasant eggs
to encourage other breeders in South Africa. Unfortunately it was

not an outstanding success due to the rough handling of the packages
by the postal authorities. The eggs arrived intact, but the airsacs
seem to have been damaged and consequently few eggs hatched.
The question might be asked whether in view of the ideal weather
conditions, birds could not be bred on a large scale for shooting, but
this has been tried on several occasions only to end in dismal failure.
This was due for the most part to the many vermin we have in South
Africa. Meercats, leopards and hawks kill off the young stock before
they have a chance to become acclimatized. There is also the difficulty
of obtaining sufficient cover for the birds when they are released.
The experiment has been tried in the Cape, Natal, and elsewhere
without success.
Besides the Pheasants I have a varied collection of other larger
birds. I have Kenya Crested Cranes, Stanley Cranes, Sarus Cranes,
Demoiselle and Lilford Cranes, White, Black, and Black-necked
Swans, Flamingoes, Curassows, and Toucans from Brazil. I have all
types of Guinea-fowl, including the beautiful Vulturine, which is
breeding well. Then there is the Secretary Bird which is fed every
morning with a large juicy rat. The Australian Brush Turkey and
the Chukar Partridge are also included in my collection, but I have
not been successful with the latter, and need some new blood.
I also have African Spurwing, Egyptian, Barnicle, Siberian, Red-
Breasted, Australian Cereopsis and White-fronted Geese, and I have
among ducks the European Sheld, the South African Sheld, the rare
South African Black Duck, Mallards, and, of course, the lovely
Carolinas and Mandarins. I have, too, Peacocks and a recently
imported pair of White Peacocks which have already bred. I have
thus a varied assortment, and undoubtedly the largest and most
comprehensive collection in South Africa. I cannot say I am
successful in breeding them all.
All the birds, with the exception of those in the Pheasant breeding
pens, are kept in large paddocks which I have landscaped with trees,
green grass, and where necessary small ponds or dams with running
water. The many paddocks are so arranged as to harmonize with the
gardens around my house. There are not a lot of unsightly fences,
except where absolutely necessary and then these are covered with
the prolific Grenadilla Vine. Our rainfall is 56 inches, so gardens are
possible the year round.
At times, however, when I want to sit quietly and think over my
past misdeeds, I can sit in a large greenhouse which I recently
imported from England and look at my begonias and gloxinias, and
other beautiful hothouse flowers, and through the doorway I can see
the Cranes dancing their afternoon dances, and when the Sarus
Cranes start the same antics, one cannot but be amused at the ungainly
way in which they imitate the graceful Stanley.

THE MARQUESS HACHISUKA
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.997225142857143" page_id="58090904"  page_num="Page 139" year="" vol="">
Masauji, eighteenth Marquess Hachisuka, Ph.D., Sc.D., died
suddenly of a heart ailment on 14th May, 1953? at his home at Atami,
Japan, at the age of 50. He appeared to be in such good health that
his untimely demise was quite unexpected.
Marquess Hachisuka will be greatly missed all over the woild. e
was born and first educated in Japan until, at the age of 19, he came to
Europe to complete his training in the Western way. The writer can
remember when he first met him, in Paris in 1922. Prince N. Taka-
Tsukasa, then staying in France, was to dine at our house on a certain
day, when he asked if he could bring a young relative of his just
arrived from Japan. He then introduced Masauji Hachisuka. Under
the guidance of Baron Hayashi, the Japanese Ambassador in London
and a friend of his father, Vice-President of the Japanese House of
Peers, he pursued zoological studies at Cambridge University duiing
the next five years, finally graduating before he returned to Japan,
through America in 1927, in company with the writer. The colourful
welcome given to him by the aristocracy and the officials of Japan,
headed by his father and his uncle, Prince Tokugawa, the last Shogun,
still remains vivid in my memory. We later travelled together to Korea
and China; he conducted an expedition to the Philippines in ! 9 2 *-9
but he soon returned to Europe, where he stayed until 1934. He had
previously travelled a good deal in Europe and North Africa, and went
to the Belgian Congo with the late Jean-Marie Derscheid ; he also paid
a lengthy visit to the King and Queen of Bulgaria. . .
During all these years Hachisuka was one of our inner circle ol
European bird-friends. He attended meetings and conventions
regularly in England, France, and elsewhere. Whilst travelling back
to Japan through the United States he fell seriously ill at Los Angeles
and remained there for four years, during which he completely
recovered. The writer spent several months with him in 1 93^-7 at
Pasadena and has never seen him again since. In the course of these
years spent in California, he had made many close friends there
Hachisuka returned to Japan in 1938, on his father's death, and he
soon married Chiye Nagamini, of Los Angeles. They had a daug iter,
now being educated in California.
The war period was difficult for him because of his Western ways
and friendships. After peace was restored, his wealth greatly diminished,
he lived quietly at Atami, where he had built a Moonsh-styled house
to his own liking, again surrounded himself with birds, resumed his
studies, and carried on an assiduous correspondence with his old
friends in America and in Europe. His unexpectedly early death is
a great shock to them.

Hachisuka was a true lover of birds, live birds in freedom and
captivity, as well as museum specimens. As an aviculturist he kept
and raised many species in Japan, particularly pheasants. He collected
bird skins extensively in the Philippines and elsewhere, and also
acquired private collections. Most of his early work on birds was done
in the museum at Tring and in London.
His publications were very numerous. Besides many articles and
notes in the Avicultural Magazine , UOiseau , the Ibis, the B.O.C. Bulletin ,
Tori , and other periodicals, he had written books on the birds of Egypt,
Iceland, the Philippines, Hainan, Formosa, and a treatise on bird
variation. His splendid book on The Dodo and Kindred Birds has just
come out, but he never saw it. He had been working lately on a book
of birds of China.
Although Marquess Hachisuka had been unwillingly separated from
his Western friends during the last fifteen years his memory has
remained vivid in their minds, as well as their affection for him.

Mme. E. Lecallier has recently died in Brittany in her 74th year.
Many of our members will remember her and her huge collection
of birds which she kept at Chateau de la Villette and in other gardens
around Elbeuf, in Normandy, between 1920 and 1940. Besides a
number of park animals (Blackbucks, Muntjacs, Wallabies, etc.) and
birds (Cranes, Rheas, Emus, waterfowl and screamers, game-birds),
she possessed hundreds of rare parrakeets, doves, and small birds of all
sorts in row upon row of roomy and practical aviaries, and in several
large bird rooms. She was exceedingly successful in breeding many
rare species, a number for the first time in captivity, as well as more
ordinary ones. Accounts of her achievements are found in our
Magazine and in UOiseau. The remnants of her collection were wiped
out by the 1940 invasion and she had since lived with one or the other
of her numerous children in Normandy and in Brittany. She had
missed her birds greatly.
The writer had long been a close friend and neighbour of hers and
we passed many happy hours discussing birds and visiting each other's
aviaries.
With Mme. Lecallier one of the great bird collectors of the between-
war era has disappeared and her friends feel her loss deeply.

Upland Goose have been bred, together with a number of the more
common pheasants.
The Lesser Black-backed and the Herring Gulls are considered
by some ornithologists to be colour phases of the same bird, so two
chicks of this " cross " bred here in the Southern Aviary are being
ringed and it will be interesting to see their adult coloration.
The mother of last year's King Penguin chick has laid again and the
Snowy Owls have eight eggs. The female Alpine Chough laid one
egg and then died as a result of an egg broken in the oviduct ; the
eggs of the Common or Cornish Choughs were again infertile, as were
those of the Rheas.
A Gang-gang Cockatoo has died, from senility, after being in the
collection for twenty-six years ; a Bengal Red-vented Bulbul after
fifteen years ; and a Purple-headed Glossy Starling after twelve
years. These longevity records are interesting, but it is not often that
one knows the age of a bird at the time of its arrival.

Dr. Alan Lendon writes that he now expects to arrive in England
by air about 10th August. Part of his letter makes melancholy reading.
Owing to the fact that his leisure is constantly shrinking he has found
it necessary to dispose of the major portion of his superb collection of
parrots and parrakeets, and the Doctor very much doubts that he will
be able to indulge in aviculture to anything like the same extent in
the future. This is certainly a sad thought after such a long session
of bird-keeping on the grand scale.

their subscriptions by money order. It is, however, most important to
notify him of such payments. In many cases the name of remitter does
not appear on the money order, with the result that there is usually
a number of " unidentified " orders in hand. It thus sometimes
happens that a request for payment of subscription is sent to a member
who has already paid by this method but omitted to notify the Hon.

A. Prestwich. London, 1950-1952. Price 35^.
The series of six parts which have been published during the last
two years have now been brought together into one volume. The
value of these breeding records has already been stressed in the reviews
of the various parts, and the whole volume is a publication with
which no aviculturist should be without. The book, presented in a
practical and useful form, is printed on one side of the paper
only, making the addition of personal notes an easy matter. In his
acknowledgments of the help he has received from various sources,
in particular that of Miss Kay Bonner, Mr. Prestwich concludes by
saying " I am conscious of extensive gaps in the records of some of
the more popular species. I know perfectly well that there are sources
of information I have been unable to tap and that there have been
many unrecorded successes of which I know nothing. I hope this
present work will open up these sources so that the results may be
embodied in a seventh part--of additions and omissions--now in
preparation."
It is to be hoped that all who read these pages will assist
Mr. Prestwich by sending in any as yet unpublished information
they may have or be able to obtain.

RARE AND EXTINCT BIRDS OF BRITAIN. By Ralph

Whitlock. Phoenix House, Ltd., London. 21 s.
Despite its title this book deals with a large majority of the birds on
the British list. In many cases, where no stretch of imagination could
label a species as either rare or extinct, its Continental or Irish race is
considered to qualify for inclusion. The author very properly points
out that sub-species can seldom be identified in the field, but his
separate treatment of them may well mislead the novice. The author
acknowledges his debt to various authorities, and in the reviewer's
opinion the results might have been happier had he followed them
more closely. Many of the author's opinions are worthy of considera-
tion, but two at least, that the Greater Spotted Cuckoo is " a smallish
bird about the size of Skylark ", and that in the Rock Pigeon (Columba
livid) we have " a species of very similar requirements " to the Fulmar,
are ridiculous if intended seriously and most inappropriate in such
a book if they are meant to be funny.
The book is illustrated with excellent photographs, many of which
have appeared in other publications.

THE MANDARIN DUCK. By Christopher Savage. Messrs.
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.996868883720931" page_id="58090911"  page_num="Page 146" year="" vol="">
Adam and Charles Black. London, 1952. Price 25*. net.
That most beautiful of ducks, the Mandrin, has always proved of
great attraction and interest to aviculturists and Christopher Savage's
monograph on this species should make a wide appeal. Mr. Savage
has taken infinite pains to amass a large amount of information about
the Mandarin Duck and to this he has added his personal observations
and studies of the bird in the wild state in Britain. The opening
chapter deals with the history and characteristics of the bird and the
author then continues with an informative account of the Mandarin
Duck in literature and art. In the chapter " The Home of the Mandarin
Duck " he discusses its distribution with great care and marshalls all
the available facts regarding the range of this species, quoting exten-
sively from that great authority on asiatic fauna and flora,
A. C. Sowerby.
Though originally escapes from collections of waterfowl, the
Mandarins have for many years been living in an entirely wild state
in parts of Surrey and Berkshire, where, the author points out, the
country has all the essentials of their natural habitat in the Far East.
Here Mr. Savage has been able to make a close and extensive study of
the birds as is evidenced in his chapters on their autumn and winter
haunts and habits in Britain, spring display, and nesting, and the
brood. Mr. Savage devotes one chapter to discussing the resemblances
and differences in appearance, behaviour, and character of the
Mandarin and Carolina and gives his opinion that the Mandarin
is the most highly developed of all the duck tribe.
In his concluding chapter on the Mandarin Duck in Britain the author
refers to the notable collections in which these birds have been bred
and been kept in large numbers, such as those of the Duke of Bedford,
Mr. Ezra, Messrs. McLean and Wormald, and Lord Grey of Fallodon.
He mentions that the earliest imported was probably by Sir Matthew
Decker, Bt., about the middle of the eighteenth century, and that
in 1834 two were acquired by the London Zoo, since when they have
been kept there almost continuously, and have bred fifty-one times.
An appendix gives a detailed description of the breeding and eclipse
plumage of the adult male, winter and summer plumage of the adult
female, and down of the nestling.
The book is excellently presented with a large number of first-class
half-tone illustrations, a coloured frontispiece by Peter Scott, and
numerous convincing black and white drawings by the author.
Two good maps are included, one showing the distribution (so far
as can be determined) of the Mandarin in the Far East, and the other
showing the breeding colonies, records of winter visitors, and isolated
records of the Mandarin in Great Britain, together with the places

It is a pity that in a book on which so much care and thought
has been expended the Selected Bibliography should contain two
mistakes in the German title of Dr. Lorenz's paper on the behaviour
of the Anatinae, and that the journal quoted for W. de W. Miller's
paper should be a travesty of its proper title.

A WANDERER IN THE WIND--THE ODYSSEY OF AN
ANIMAL COLLECTOR. By Cecil S. Webb. Hutchinson's,
London, 1953. Price 21s. net.
Mr. Webb has had a most adventurous life and to those who have
not been so fortunate in this respect he makes it possible at least to
share these adventures for so graphically written is his book that
the reader is held enthralled for close on 300 pages. Mr. Webb has
visited all the continents of the world and his vivid descriptions
of travels in South Africa, Portuguese East Africa, Indo-China,
Madagascar, British Guiana, Kenya, Tanganyika, Australia, French
Cameroons, India, Gold Coast, Ecuador, and the British Cameroons
are an education in themselves. As Dr. Geoffrey Vevers writes in the
foreword : " His book is packed with solid facts and achievements
and contains many new and original observations on the habits and
physiology of animals. But do not imagine for a moment that it is a
book for zoologists only--it is a book which the general reader will
find intensely interesting and instructive."
Mr. Webb is famous as a naturalist and collector of animals but
in addition to a vast amount of information on natural history and
methods of catching, transporting, and the care of animals, he includes
in his book a great deal of fascinating description of natives' customs,
witch doctors, supersititions, and local tradition. Mr. Webb writes
in a lively and humorous style and all through the book the modesty
of his own achievements is evident. He possesses all the qualities needed
for those who travel in wild places and have to deal with animals,
patience, good humour, initiative, and a quick brain--it is typical of
him that when he was being charged by a mad cow, without a moment's
hesitation he decided to charge the cow !
Mr. Webb's book is of special interest to aviculturists, and he
emphasizes the important part aviculturists can play in the study
of bird life, but he has no use for anyone who does not take proper
care of captive birds and writes : " If the keeping of birds is under-
taken it should be done at the highest level of efficiency or not at all."
Mr. Webb's knowledge of birds of all kinds is quite amazing and
much can be learnt from his book.

BIRDS OF MEXICO. By Emmet Reid Blake, Associate Curator
of Birds at the Chicago Natural History Museum. With numerous
line-drawings by Douglas E. Tibbitts, Staff Artist at the same
institution. 644 pages. Chicago : University of Chicago Press,
1952. $6.00.
For a very long time have we aviculturists felt a dire need for a
practical guide to Mexican birds. While there have been published
now and then books on this very pertinent subject, they have always
been more or less fragmentary, purposely so.
Now comes Curator Blake and gives us almost exactly what we have
been wishing for so very long. His comprehensive work is largely
meant as a guide to identification of birds in the field. As such it may
readily be carried in one's coat pocket, for the 644 pages are very
compactly printed on not very heavy paper.
Aviculturists have, of course, known for a good many years that our
neighbour Mexico boasts of many hundreds of species of birds which
they have never seen in the flesh, and few of them in illustration.
According to the author, no fewer than a thousand species of birds
representing eighty-nine families have been located in Mexico ]
and if subspecies are included in the counting, then the number
of birds totals nearly two thousand. Surely such wealth of bird-
life is found in but few countries, whatever their size and location.
Highly favourable climatic conditions are very conducive to the well-
being of birds in Mexico.
Author Blake writes concerning each of the 967 species in a concise,
informative style that is readily understandable. He begins each account
with a terse description of the bird, gives its distribution, and con-
cludes with remarks regarding females, related species, or whatever
else is needful to complete the data gathered. No information is given
concerning the food requirements of the birds, their nesting, and other
habits, no doubt because the book is meant solely for purposes of
identification in the field.
The line-drawings are well done as a whole, usually portraying
only that particular portion or aspect of the bird likely to be typical
and therefore especially useful for quick and sure identification.
All in all, Author Blake is to be highly commended for the pains-
taking and resultful research which has given us this worthy addition
to the literature of Mexican ornithology. Birds of Mexico is without
question one of the most comprehensive and dependable guides on
the subject yet published.

Bernard Poe. Illustrated. 120 pages, 1953. New York City :
G. P. Putnam's Sons. $2.50.
One of Putnam's nature field books, this very handy little volume
is meant to aid the amateur birdkeeper in maintaining his feathered
charges in good health for many years. To this end the author, a
zoology professor, has made it his business to touch--rather lightly
and often neither expertly nor completely--on varied phases of bird-
keeping. There are sections giving advice on how to buy a bird, how
to keep it healthy, how to sex it, how to feed it, how to train it, etc.
While the advice is for the most part sound, it is frequently very
fragmentary and therefore not a reliable or comprehensive guide to
cage-bird keeping. Some of the " facts " given in the book are obsolete,
as, for instance, the reference to Bird Haven, which firm many years
ago discontinued selling birds. There is a helpful though incomplete
bibliography. There are some line-drawings which help the beginner
to identify certain species. However, their number is very small.
It is quite obvious that any bird enthusiast using this book will, if
he delves into the subject at all thoroughly, very soon find himself
in need of a more comprehensive, detailed, and complete guide to
keeping cage birds. Mr. Poe's work is quite uneven in the treatment of
various subjects, as well as incomplete.

THE BIOLOGY OF BIRDS. By Harry W. Hann, Assistant Pro-

Illustrated. Ann Arbor, Michigan : Ulrich's Book Store. $2.50.
This is a very concise volume into which have been compressed
highly informative, relevant, and factual data concerning every
essential phase of a bird's life and activity. Written in non-technical
language, apparently the outgrowth of a course in ornithology con-
ducted by the author at the University of Michigan, this readable book
is worth the time and effort of every serious bird student, for it provides
him with factual, up-to-date information, the sort of which he is not
likely to obtain in such convenient and concise form in the average
so-called bird book, especially the popular one.
The author opens his treatise with a chapter devoted to the
morphology and physiology of birds, which in turn is followed by other
chapters dealing with bird flight, migration (homing), breeding,
anting, longevity, banding, distribution, conservation, and other
relevant aspects of the subject. Each one is treated very compactly
and quite thoroughly. Frequent references to authentic sources of
information are given in the text, and there are more detailed ones

With reference to Mr. Boosey's criticism of my methods for preventing third nests
of Turquoisines, I have never myself known a healthy hen, properly fed, neglect
the feeding of her well-grown brood simply because the cock had been taken away.
With regard to the risk of young birds damaging themselves seriously when being
caught up, I have also not found this to be great if, as should always be done, a
proper supply of leafy branches has been laid on, or tied to, the dangerous areas of
wire netting in the flight before the brood has flown. Young birds do not crash very
hard against wire netting unless there is an unimpeded view through it.

With reference to my letter in the May-June number of the Magazine, Sir Godfrey
Davis has written to me to say that my recollection of the conversation I had with
him some years ago about the Grey Parrots breeding in India is wrong.
He says that it was not a secondhand account, and that he told me that he had
actually seen the birds himself.

HYBRID SONNERAT'S JUNGLE FOWL

Mr. Johnson's interesting article on the hybrids between the Grey or Sonnerat's
Jungle Fowl and domestic bantams reminds me of having seen this year, in the
Zoological Gardens of Cologne, some birds of this cross.
The females bore a slight resemblance to hen Sonnerat's, but the males showed no
trace of Sonnerat parentage except for the voice, which was exactly that of Gallus
sonnerati, and it was this distinctive call that drew my attention to the birds.
It would be interesting to know to what extent the call is hereditary and whether
it is the same in Sonnerat's X Domestic as in Domestic X Sonnerat's ; also whether
there is any sign of the eclipse plumage on the neck, characteristic of male Sonnerat's.

(Psittacula alexandri fasciata)
By E. N. T. Vane (Ballinger, Bucks, England)
Generally speaking the Asiatic parrakeets are not as popular with
aviculturists as their Australian counterparts. They compare favour-
ably in colour, shape, and plumage, indeed they excel in the latter,
but they have the disadvantage of being more difficult to sex on the
whole, until the third moult, not so ready to go to nest, and possibly
somewhat noisier.
To all these features there are exceptions, some Australians are
never easy to sex at any age, some can hold their own in vocal power
with almost any living thing on earth, and there are still several yet
to be persuaded to breed in captivity. On the other hand some Asiatics
are readily sexed at a year old, some breed without difficulty, and
some are reasonably quiet in their behaviour. The Moustache is
one of the most attractive birds I have ever kept. Most people probably
think of these birds as the miserable little half-dead creatures that were
at one time freely imported under most unfavourable conditions.
Poor little wretches caught raiding the crops and only saved from
immediate execution because some half-witted European was piepaied
to pay money for the thieving little pests. These were nearly all
immature youngsters of the year of an almost uniform green coloui
with an absurd caricature of a handlebar moustache, which name
has been appended to them as a permanent reminder ot their infirmity.
During the relaxation of the parrot ban comparatively few of these
birds were brought over, and they were evidently not a paying proposi-
tion to the dealer, adults seemed to travel well considering all things,
but young birds died easily.
The appearance of a fully adult pair is really magnificent. One
dealer advertised them as " miniature Derbyans and evoked many
caustic comments from certain people who were indignant that such a

comparison could even be suggested, but it is in fact quite a justifiable
one. In view of the inaccuracy of some descriptions given in the past
I give a fairly full one of each sex here. These are taken carefully
from living specimens so that allowances must be made for individual
variations, as I can only refer to my own pair and a very few other
specimens I have been able to inspect. In the cock, the head above the
moustachial streak right over the crown is a lovely lavender grey.
There is a black streak from eye to eye along the lores, and over the
nostrils also the characteristic black moustache. The eye has a very
light grey iris which at times appears to be quite yellow. The upper
mandible is red and the lower black. The chest is a pinkish lilac
merging into a pale green belly and abdomen. The nape is an intense
bright green, the remainder of the mantle, back, and wings being
green with a golden yellowish-green patch on the wing. The tail
is green, the central feathers being blue on top and the underside of
the tail being yellowish. The feet are grey.
In the hen the head above the moustache is a pale bluish grey,
much more pale blue than the cock. The iris of the eye is again
yellowish-grey and appears to vary with the light. Mandibles are both
black and she has the same moustachial and eye to eye streaks of black
as the male. The chest is pink and noticeably curls up behind the
black moustache towards the top of the head. Nape bright green.
Mantle, back, and wings green, abdomen pale bluish-green. There
is a faint suggestion of a lighter wing patch but not so pronounced as in
the cock. In size the birds are slightly smaller than the common Ring-
neck, but are not nearly so powerful in flight as the wings are noticeably
shorter and their flight recalls that of a lorikeet.
The young bird is an almost uniform green except for the moustache
and eye streaks, the area between these streaks being grey. There is
no visible wing patch, but the primaries are edged with light yellow
which appears to fade, possibly by attrition. On leaving the nest the
mandibles were both paler red than the cock's upper one, but both
soon darkened and became completely black in a few weeks.
My birds were imported in 1952 shortly after the ban was lifted ;
during that year they were housed in an aviary of modest size and went
to nest, the hen laid eggs and sat, but there was no result owing to the
fact that they were interfered with and she deserted. It was not
surprising, therefore, that when the opportunity to acquire a pair of
birds that had already shown their willingness to breed was offered
to me, I eagerly took advantage of it. As they had been kept indoors
for part of the winter I turned them into an indoor flight of only
about 8 feet in length, where there was no heat. The hen was a
perfect shrew where the cock was concerned, he was not allowed on
the same perch and whatever perch he chose that was the perch on
which she wanted to be. All the time they were indoors they were

remarkably silent, scarcely ever making any noise or uttering any call-
notes ; even when swearing at her partner, the hen only ordered him
off by shoving him with her head and opening her beak at him.
Early in the year, during a mild spell of weather, they were turned
out into an aviary 15 feet long, 3 feet wide, and 6 feet high, con-
structed entirely of steel and facing south. The only shelter was of
asbestos sheet 3 feet square and with its floor 4 feet above ground-
level. It was one of a block of eight flights and their only neighbours
were a pair of Bourkes, whom they entirely ignored throughout the
season. Their flight was at the end of the block, which enabled me to
have one or two very surreptitious inspections during the course of
events. By sliding back an inspection trap with a long stick whilst
the hen was feeding I was able to see the first egg, the young shortly
after hatching, and once or twice whilst growing. The nest box was
an old campaigner, a grandfather clock box of thick timber which
would cost an impossible sum to-day and would most probably have
infringed the timber control regulations then in force. It was filled
from ground level for about 2 feet with earth and topped with some

9 inches of damp peat mould, so that there was a drop inside of some

The food supplied consisted of sunflower, oats, canary, buckwheat,
millet, and hemp. They always selected the sunflower first, though
they were very partial to apples and pears, and were supplied also with
brown bread rusked up and fed crumbly moist. As I have frequently
mentioned previously, all my parrakeets have this addition to their
diet ; almost without exception they relish it immensely, and the
great advantage I find is that through this medium they can be
persuaded to take all kinds of extras such as mineral salts, wheat germ
oil, cod liver oil, or any other tonic it is desired to administer, without
the use of force. Green food consisted of chickweed, poa annua,
dandelion seed, leaf spinach, and later on sow thistle, all supplied
liberally and varied according to season. They also had access to old
mortar grit and cuttle bone. After breeding operations had been com-
pleted successfully, we found that the hen was a most engaging per-
sonality with human beings. She will come right up and accept
titbits from one's fingers, indeed she will soon remind one that she
expects something every time she sees one coming. She is very fond
of green peas, apple, pear, or banana, but she will not allow the cock
to share these delicacies and as he is more stand-offish it is difficult to
give a fair distribution to them because she takes one piece from one's
fingers and whilst one is fixing another on the wire for the cock and
youngster, she consumes her own with indecent haste and then
purloins the other pieces before one can get far enough away to give the
others a chance.

Almost as soon as they were released into this flight a change in
attitude to each other was noticeable. The hen became quite tolerant
and the cock began to assert himself. For the first time too it became
apparent that they had quite powerful voices and a talent for mimicry,
as they can imitate the calls of the Noble Macaws which are the most
frequently heard in great volume well enough to make one wonder
which bird is creating a disturbance. In the middle of March the
cock was always displaying, and whilst doing so he is a magnificent
bird. He stands on the perch beside the hen, draws his head back-
wards and upwards and keeps bowing to her whilst uttering a song
which can hardly be called a warble, indeed it can hardly be called a
song. But it is perfectly obvious to anyone what he is saying, that is
anyone but the hen ; she is so bored that she nearly dozes off in the
early days, though not for long, and they quite evidently are thoroughly
happy in each other's company.
From the frequency and length of endurance of copulation, I should
say that it was a triumph of achievement on the part of " X " (the
evil spirit of aviculture created by the Duke of Bedford), to succeed
in arranging that two out of the three eggs laid were infertile. However,
that was the result. The hen was first observed to use the box on
23rd March. In early April she began to stay in the box for quite
lengthy periods and the first egg was laid on the 4th, some time
in the evening I believe. From then on she was left very much on
her own, and it was not until the 17th that another chance to look
in was presented, when she had three eggs. Incubation appeared to
start with the first egg, as from the 4th onwards she spent all her time
in the box, although it is impossible to say whether she was generating
sufficient heat to start incubation. She was very suspicious of one s
actions at this time, and if she heard anyone about whilst feeding
she immediately dashed back into the box. Just after sunset on the
3rd May a youngster was definitely heard being fed, which puts
the period of incubation at approximately twenty-eight days. She
brooded the youngster pretty closely, which was just as well seeing
that it was a single bird, but it appeared to thrive without incident.
The progress appeared to be slow, as with other Psittacula , but the
young one could usually be heard making a lusty noise when being
fed. At twenty-five days old it was still downy and without any proper
feathers, and had large black eyes. On the 17th June it was seen
at the nest hole looking out, but it was still frightfully shy and with-
drew immediately it saw anything move. On the 20th it came out
on the platform to be fed whilst it thought it was unobserved, and
it could then be seen that the bill was a pale red. It finally flew on
the 23rd June, fifty-one days after hatching. It roosted out under
cover the first night but the hen went back into the box and I thought
she might go to nest again. The cock also appeared to take this view,

but she soon disillusioned us both on this point and relations between
the pair soon degenerated by degrees back to the old hen-pecked days.
During the whole of the incubation period I did not see the cock
enter the nest, he looked in and called the hen off to feed or be fed,
but that was all. Neither does he feed the young bird, although he
may do so, because I have only very seldom seen either parent actually
pumping food into the youngster, and on each occasion I have done
so it has been the hen, and as soon as they realized they were being
watched they have broken off immediately.
About ten days after leaving the nest, it was noticed that the young
bird's bill was darkening and it was almost entirely black in a month.
The cock was seen to feed the hen occasionally, but he was never given
an opportunity to mate although he seemed to wish to do so. From
the behaviour of the parents I am inclined to think the young bird
is a cock ; the hen always feeds it, and if the youngster worries the cock
for food he promptly drives it away although there is no spite in his
action such as one finds in the Broadtails.
We now have a happy family of Moustache or Banded Parrakeets,
albeit a small one. The hen is delightfully tame, the cock does not
count for much, and the youngster is a lovely little bird. It is most
amusing to watch him try and take a particular tit-bit from one of his
parents ; they both drive him off, but nothing daunts him and he
never fails to secure at least a part of the feast. It is sincerely to be
hoped that it will be possible to establish these delightful birds in
English aviaries as there are quite a few still about.
Although this appears to be a first breeding, it can only be because
there has never been sufficient effort to breed them previously. There
was nothing very difficult in the whole process and I am sure plenty
of others can repeat the performance. If anyone wants to know my
secret for success I am not averse to telling them how it may be done.
It is just like the young man who started out in business on his own
with ten pounds, and recently retired worth a hundred thousand
pounds. He attributed his success in life to hard work and diligence,
perseverance and determination in the face of many difficulties and
the death of a rich uncle who left him #99&amp;gt;99*- My rich uncle was
getting the right pair of birds and then giving them the benefit of all
my care, attention, and experience. Anyone else can do the same.

As described above E. N. T. Vane has bred a Moustache, or
Banded Parrakeet (Psittacula alexandri fasciata). It is believed that this
may be a first success.
Any member or reader knowing of a previous breeding of this
species in Great Britain or Northern Ireland is requested to com-
municate at once with the Hon. Secretary.

By F. J. Appelman (Rotterdam, Holland)
Until a few years ago the splendid hothouse adjoining the big
Riviera-Hall in the Rotterdam Zoo, contained plants only. However
splendid the collection of tropical and subtropical plants was, only
a comparatively small part of " Blijdorp's " visitors showed much
interest, and most of them " did " the hothouse in a few minutes.
Then the Director had an idea : " Why exhibit plants and flowers
without birds, and why exhibit birds without plants and flowers ?
Those gems of Nature, magnificent flowers and beautiful birds, belong
together, and to do them both justice they should be exhibited
together ! "
So a number of smaller and bigger aviaries were built amongst the
orchids, palms, ferns, and many other plants, and when possible the
aviaries themselves were also planted with plants and flowers, the
colours of which were carefully chosen to blend with the colours of
the birds.
The success was overwhelming ; after the birds were taken into their
new surroundings, the hothouse, formerly only visited by few people,
was always crowded with visitors, who proved they appreciated this
splendid combination of exotic birds amidst exotic plants which up
till then had been rarely seen. And how did the birds do? We can
only say : extremely well !
It is pointed out that before the new arrangement, it had already
been observed that tropical birds moult much easier, faster, and
better in hot and humid surroundings than in colder and drier places.
Never were our Macaws finer in spring than after wintering in the
hothouse. Moreover, we installed combined self-registering ther-
mometer-hygrometers, and made sure that we arranged in the hot-
house the same, or about the same, climatic conditions that prevail
in the rain-forests in the tropics.
To check the hothouse " climate " we have the average daily
temperature and moisture curves of certain places in Indonesia on the
registration-strip and try to keep our hothouse-curves as closely as
possible to this curve.
It is our opinion that a little difference in the temperature and
humidity does not matter so much, but that the course of the curves
is most essential. Therefore we are content if the course of our hot-
house-curves runs more or less parallel and not too far away from the
standard-curves (see illustration).* Amongst the birds successfully
* It should be understood that for our control we use the average daily tempera-
ture- and moisture-curve that prevails during the year ; so we do not take in account
the different seasons (monsoons).

kept in this way are : Ibises, Birds of Paradise (six species), Jacanas,
Nicobar Pigeons, Gouras, Ocellated Turkeys, Radjah Sheld-Duck,
Brazilian Teal, Toucans, Tanagers, and many smaller birds.
Of course, at this moment we cannot sav that we have solved the
problem entirely, as our experiment has only been in operation for one
and a half years. All we can say is that until now we have suffered
only minor losses, and that the birds are doing extremely well. They
are in fine condition and very lively, loudly calling and signalling to
each other. Some even started breeding, e.g. the Crowned Wood-
partridge (Rollulus roulroul), from Sumatra, known as a bird that is
not too easy to keep in captivity.
It should be understood, however, that this way of keeping and
showing birds is rather expensive. It is, of course, hardly possible
to keep parrakeets in this way, as they will ruin all plants in a few
hours. But even small seed-eating birds do a lot of harm to the plants.
Best fitted to live in harmony with flowers are insect-eating birds
and, to a certain degree, fruit-eating birds, but even these soil flowers
and leaves with their droppings, so that the planting of the aviaries
has to be changed at least every two weeks or even more often. This
necessitates keeping in stock a large number of plants, shrubs, and
trees, which also means a lot of work for the gardeners !
But in any event we are sure that our idea : " Show your animals
in beautiful surroundings ; keep birds and flowers together " is
highly appreciated by the visitors, and cannot fail to teach the public
the sense of beauty, harmony, and love for Nature's inexhaustible
treasures, which is one of the first aims and duties of a modern Zoo.

By The Duke of Bedford (Woburn, Bucks, England)
" Nothing very remarkable about that," I can hear you say. " Lots
of people have bred them " ! That, however, Reader, is just where
you are mistaken for no one, not even Dame Nature herself, has
bred this particular kind of Green Ringneck !
Sexing immature Ringnecks by their appearance is always a bit
difficult, for although hens show slightly more yellow in the iris of the
eye than cocks, the difference is not very great, and the more closely
you examine a lot of young birds the more confused are you likely
to become. It came about, therefore, that what I had for some time
believed to be a pair of two-year-old blue Ringnecks turned out to
be two cocks, judging by their behaviour as the breeding season
approached. As I already had a certain hen, this left me with a
spare cock and I decided, if possible, to mate him to a lutino in the
hope of breeding something which might even be split for white.
By rather unusual good fortune I did get hold of a lutino hen which
was said to have bred--quite a good bird, save that the ends of some
of her toes were missing, doubtless because her owner had not taken
the precaution to avoid exposing her feet to severe frost.
When I introduced the two birds to one another, although the
blue cock had shown signs of being in breeding condition, their
attitude of surprise and alarm was not exactly promising. As on a
previous occasion when I had put a blue and a lutino Ringneck together,
the reaction of each bird seemed to be " Good heavens ! I never saw
such an extraordinary-looking object ! " As, however, they did not
seem disposed actually to fight, I decided to leave them together and
see what happened. After a while the blue cock showed some desire
to make advances to the hen, but for a time he met with a very chilly
reception. When he walked up to her in the consequential manner
which is part of a Ringneck's display, she simply ignored him, gazing
into the distance as though he did not exist. Only if he actually
touched her and offered to feed her did she open her beak at him in an
ill-natured way. In the past she had doubtless had a mature green or
lutino husband with a well-developed ring and the ringless, two-
year-old &lt;c Little Boy Blue " seemed to her a most inferior substitute.
Some time later I noticed the blue cock examining the nest-box, but
as the hen's attitude towards him remained chilly and distant, it was
with some surprise that one morning, finding no sign of her, either in
the aviary shelter or in the flight, I realized that she must be in the
nest itself. After that things began to look more promising, and in
due course it became apparent that the lutino was sitting. Some

weeks later I saw the cock emerging from the box--an almost certain
sign that the young had hatched. How is it, I wonder, that parrakeet
fathers are made aware so quickly of the birth of their children when
the latter are still so tiny and feeble that they can hardly make any
audible noise ? Do their wives manage to tell them and, if so, how
is it done ? I remember some time ago reading a charming account
of observations made at the nest of a pair of breeding partridges,
which included a description of the way in which the hen drew her
mate's attention to the arrival of their first-born child, with the result
that he became so wild with excitement and delight and cut such
capers that he could not even see where he was going and ran into
a tree ! Thereafter things progressed in an uneventful and satisfactory
manner in the Ringneck family. Judging by the amount of food
consumed, however, the brood was not a large one, and in due course
when two nice young ones left the nest, this proved to be the case.
As I rather expected, they are green, but I imagine, if they are sex-
linked, that both cocks and hens are split for blue and the young
cocks, if mated to blues, might even produce some albino daughters.

By David M. West (Montebello, California, U.S.A.)
The current breeding season has had its high and low points.
Certainly there were times when one wondered about " birds
inhumanity to man " for some pairs only tantalized us with
expectations.
Our famed (unusual) California weather stayed with us the entire
season. From January to March it was summer--with day after day
of sunshine and clear skies. It turned out that this was our mildest
winter in many years and also one of the driest, as we had very little
rain. As a result many birds came into fine breeding condition by
March, when dull grey skies and cool damp weather became the
order of the day. This seemed to cause indecision in our feathered
friends, leaving them wondering whether they should nest, moult, or
drop dead. In the end they did just that--some moulted in March,
some nested, and some just gave up and died.
The failures and sad news department we'll cover first. Stanley
Rosellas, always my favourite Rosella, proved again a disappointment.
Though I have had Stanleys for twelve years, I have never been
very successful with them. The season started with three pairs, and
the hen to one of the pairs gave up, forever, the idea of increasing
California's Stanley population, for she was found dead one morning
for no apparent cause. The other two hens immediately started to

make up for her demise by starting large families. One hen laid eight
eggs and the other hen laid a clutch of nine. After this strenuous
effort one hen sat very half-heartedly for about ten days, and then
deserted, and the other hen never did decide to incubate, though
I will say, in her defence, she faithfully checked her eggs daily and
would sit on them for a half hour or so each day. It was most unfortu-
nate that we had nothing to transfer the eggs to--and so the result
was a large nothing for the Stanleys. Better luck next year ?
Crimson-wings, always rare in California, were very tiresome.
A young male disapproved of his mate and luckily we were able to
provide another one that he immediately accepted. Though she
looked in the nest and even sat in the nest for a few days, nothing
eventuated. As he was just a two-year-old cock this was rather to be
expected. This pair took great interest in the matrimonial affairs
of all the other birds, even to looking in the nest of a pair of Silver
Zebras housed with them. As the Zebras did not seem to object, it
made little difference, and the Zebras just kept right on raising large
families carefully supervised by the Crimson-wings. A second pair
of Crimson-wings scrapped all fall and winter, but became very
friendly during April. With none of the usual nest-box inspection
you find in the Rosellas, she laid two eggs quite suddenly, and then
never visited the nest again. I placed the eggs under some Cockatiels
who successfully hatched the one fertile egg, but would not feed the
chick. We hand-fed it for ten days and then found the youngster
dead one morning for no apparent reason. Quite to our surprise the
female laid again (two eggs) and though she sat faithfully the eggs
were clear. The San Diego Zoo is quite successful with this species.
Red Lories visited the nest-box and mated, but nothing further
eventuated. The female is probably too young, for she was in juvenile
plumage when obtained. This pair were raised in Arizona by
Mr. Sheffler. These Lories are always particularly annoyed when the
lawns are mowed. They very noisily object, hanging by the wire
and scolding. This pair are permanently frustrated by their futile
attempts to kill a neighbouring pair of Pileated--whom they especially
seem to resent.
A pair of Black-winged Lories also mated, but no nest was provided
for them as the hen was in a very bad moult and we rather wondered
if raising a family would help her tacky appearance. The Black-wings
are certainly much more quiet than the Red Lories. This pair also
is from Arizona.
Turquoisines had three clutches of clear eggs. This is a surprise
as they are in a large portable aviary and are a handsome three-
year-old pair. Turquoisines have the unhappy habit of being very
scrappy--a fault the other Neophema happily lack.
Brown's Rosellas showed great interest, but this pair were intro-

duced very late and they fell into an early moult. This pair fortu-
nately seem well-disposed towards each other which has not been
the case with most of the Brown's Rosellas here in Galifoi nia.
A male Stanley mated to a female Blue Rosella did not even display
to her, and both birds seemed quite contented just to sit the season out.
Blue-bonnets laid and sat very well, but all six eggs were clear.
Of the four pairs, only one laid, and the other thiee pairs just visited
the box and looked interested. A male Manycolour mated to a female
Blue-bonnet did nothing and was found dead one morning with
a broken neck.
Blue India Ringnecks proved interesting. Although I should have
known better, I had rather expected this mutation to be a cobalt blue.
I was tremendously surprised to find they are an unusually lovely
light blue--what we here in California call a " sky-blue " or " powder
blue ". The sex of the first two birds posed an interesting problem,
and one that was difficult to solve, since they were very nervous, and
upon seeing anyone watching them would immediately retreat into
their shelter--not to reappear for some time. Finally, during March,
they did some displaying, and when a nest-box was hung their actions
left no doubt they were a pair. The nest-box was removed after
we were sure of their sex, for they began a very heavy moult which
lasted an unusually long time. They eat a tremendous amount of
fruit daily, and each day a large apple and orange are given, and by
the following morning nothing is left. They also proved tremendously
fond of the young buds and flower buds of fruit trees of plum, peach,
and apricot, and as they grew more confiding would fly down (while
we watched) to their daily branch of peach and apricot. They made
a very fine display as they crawled about among the pink and white
blossoms. For Ringnecks they are quiet--at least in comparison to
some I had years ago.
A second pair of blue Ringnecks were an obvious pair from the
first and were always confiding and steady. They are all very fond
of ripe corn (on the cob) and will easily eat an ear a day.
It might be interesting to note that prior to 1950 there were no
lutino Ringnecks in the United States. However, in that year a zoo
imported a small breeding nucleus of eight lutino and lutino-bred
Ringnecks for study. These have prospered and as a result some
lutino Ringnecks are being raised every year. Even so they are still
very scarce in this country and are still too rarely seen.
Many California breeders have told me quite definitely that, in
their experience, the young male Ringnecks will obtain their ring at
from sixteen to eighteen months. This is not the case with European
birds, judging from the printed references.
Barraband's did nothing, though they always looked like they
intended to raise a family. Both pairs displayed, fed, and mated,

and looked into their nest-boxes, but eventually did nothing. They
are great favourites of mine, and their friendly and comical ways
are a joy.
Yellow Rosellas also looked at their box but got no further. They
are surprisingly tame and friendly, and ever ready to fly to the wire
for a piece of grass or a nut. One male appears to have sore feet
and the ankles seem to be swollen. Does anyone have suggestions on
what should be done to help this bird ?
On the sunny side of the account the really outstanding numerical
success of the season was 16 young Bourkes from three breeding
pairs. The first pair deserted two fertile clutches of eggs and then
started a third clutch. When the third clutch also was deserted (why,
I don't know) I was able to save the fertile eggs, and these were given
to a spinster Nyasa Lovebird who raised one young Bourke for about
three weeks when the Bourke was removed and hand-fed. A second
pair showed no signs of nesting until very late in the season, when the
hen suddenly retreated to her nest-box and reared a fine brood of
four. The third pair really did themselves proud, and from three
nests they reared eleven (5, 4, 2) without any trouble or fuss. They
actually would have started a fourth clutch if the nest-box had not
been removed. This pair was in a large cage with the pair of Barra-
band's and the male Bourke never hesitated to do battle with the
Barraband's who always obligingly retreated before his determined
attacks ! These battles were always short, and the Bourkes made no
objection to the Barraband's sitting on top of their nest-box. I was
especially interested to note that the Bourkes would eat the (cracked)
sunflower seed that the wasteful Barraband's would drop in the sun-
flower bowl. This doubtless helped the young Bourkes to be the really
fine specimens they are.
Manycolours were successful again this year. One pair raised
seven (4, 3) in two nests, while a second pair, composed of a fine
male and a very nervous hen, did not fare so well. Their first nest
of four fertile eggs was given to a very trustworthy Red rump hen,
who duly hatched them and let them all die ! A second nest of three
youngsters was deserted--and though they were hand-fed they never
prospered, and died one by one. A third pair did not nest.
A very lovely pair of Pileated (with a long five year record of
failures and desertions) hatched a single youngster which was success-
fully hand-raised. It is a very tame and confiding bird--as most
hand-raised Pileated are. A second pair of Pileated were too young
to nest, although the year-old cock did display and call to the hen.
All the African Lovebirds did well. Peachface, Fischer's, Nyasas,
Black and Blue Masked, all raised good numbers of fine youngsters.
Of especial interest were the lutino Nyasas. 1 hese are really
extremely beautiful with their golden bodies and pink heads. \\ e had

a single lutino male and one (purported) split cock to start the season.
These two males were placed with three known young females early
in the season. The split (?) cock raised five young (3, 2), and the
lutino male and his mate raised seven (1, 6). All the twelve young
were greens, but they have been carefully segregated and some of them
at least must be splits, so it does give us some good stock for next year.
The second nest of six the male lutino had, was considered too large,
and so the extra hen Nyasa was given two of his fertile eggs and duly
reared them. This spinster situation was interesting because at
various times both males entered her nest, but none of the many eggs
she laid proved fertile. Nyasas are very fond of greens and ours also
eat large quantities of apples and oranges, along with soaked bread
while rearing young. At the time of these notes (July) both pairs of
the Nyasas again have eggs, so the total number of young for the
season is still uncertain. I have not observed the cock helping to build
the nest--the female doing all the work by carrying the nesting
material in her beak. I put in a fresh palm frond each week for them
--and this has proven most satisfactory for nesting material.
Scarlet-chested did very poorly. Of four pairs one was too young,
one had two sets of clear eggs, one pair raised two, and the other three.
Rather disappointing as they are usually very dependable.
Princess Alexandras also did very poorly. We started the season
with five pairs, but one of the females died early in the season and
we could not replace her. Of the remaining four pairs, one pair did
not nest at all ; one pair reared a single but very fine only child ; one
pair had four fertile eggs that failed to pip and a second nest of clear
eggs ; and the fourth pair reared two very fine youngsters. The
father of the two youngsters just mentioned is a blue sport, and is
one of the loveliest birds I have ever seen. The pink throat and tail
in the normal bird are replaced with white, while the body is blue-
grey and the wings the loveliest sky-blue. This is a very fine large
male, very vigorous and tame. Last year he was mated to a good
hen, and though they were actually observed to mate, she did not
nest. This year he mated to a proven hen who immediately laid
five eggs. Of the five one was clear, two failed to pip, and two were
hatched and raised. These two youngsters are normally coloured,
but are split for the blue factor. The two young are thought to be
a pair.
Cockatiels did exceptionally well, five pairs raising over fifty
youngsters without any trouble. A few (seven) lutino Budgies were
raised from an albino cock and a female lutino.
For many years I have been an increasingly strong advocate of
feeding fruit to all the birds we keep. In addition to the various
standard grains (hemp, oats, sunflower, millet, canary) mixed in
varying proportions depending upon the season and the bird, I

find that every bird we have seems to look forward to the daily
fruit ration.
A most satisfactory and economical method of providing fruit is
this method which we have evolved over a period of time. Since
most of the smaller birds will only eat a quarter of an apple and
orange a day, I cut the fruit into quarters (first being sure to wash the
fruit carefully to remove any sprays, etc., growers might have used),
and then impale the fruit on a nail in the aviary. This holds the fruit
firmly in place and prevents it from being dropped on the floor and
being wasted. It is easiest to impale the fruit if you drive the nail
in upside down--so that the fruit does not have to pass over the
head of the nail. In short--instead of driving the nail from the top
of the wood downwards, place the nail so that the point of the nail
comes up through the wood, thus giving you a sharp point. This
will hold the fruit firmly in place and makes it easy for the birds to eat.
For each cage I drive four nails. Because some pairs fight over
food, I drive them in sets of two, placing the two sets a few feet apart.
This prevents squabbles--also when the pair has young, more fruit
may be desirable, and the added nails make it easy to provide the
additional fruit. We have found that when the fruit is cut into
quarters the birds find it easier to eat than if it were halved.
The large birds as Kings, Barraband's, and the like, all get one-
half of an orange and one-half of an apple each day. The smaller
Neophema , Agapornis, Psephotus will do nicely with the quarters.
During the entire year I feed apples and oranges as part of the daily
feeding routine. During the summer all the birds receive fresh corn
on the cob. With corn it is very important to start out gradually
with only small sections of the cob for this precaution will avoid any
possible bowel upsets. I have seen such small birds as the finches
and the Budgies work very diligently on the corn in order to get the
kernels. Summer brings figs and most birds enjoy the figs which I
secure from our tree when they are very ripe. The lories will eat
the melons as cantaloupe, water melon, and most of the seed-eating
birds will like the seeds from cantaloupe, etc., when dried. All the
psittacine birds love with a wild passion pomegranates. In the fall
these are readily obtainable at very reasonable prices, and I split
these open, and the birds will fly all about one when this treat is
brought to their aviary. As the tree bears profusely here in California,
one could easily grow one's own supply. The one drawback with this
fruit is that it is very likely to stain the bird's plumage--and so in no
time at all your Barrabands have a reddish breast and some might
object to this fruit for that reason.
So many people say to me that they tried fruit and the birds didn't
touch it. This is doubtless true--the Agapornis will sometimes
take a month before they will start to eat the fruit and Bourkes

and Budgies even longer. I just continue to give it until they start to
utilize the fruit.
A second complaint one frequently hears is that only a small
portion is eaten. One should consider the small capacity a pair of
Elegants or Bourkes will have. For example, in one aviary this
season there were five Nyasas, and they would just barely finish
their daily ration of a quarter of an apple and orange. It is quite
true that they " wasted " some by not eating all of the apple and
orange--but the important thing is not that they did not eat all of it,
but instead that their diet was enriched by the addition of apple and
orange. Anyone who keeps birds has a duty to see to it that they are
kept under the most desirable conditions possible--and possibly the
addition of fruit will enrich their life.
At any rate I firmly believe that the aviculturist's chances of rearing
young are greatly increased when the pair has had access to fruit
during the year. I believe that the use of fruit results in better plumage
and healthier adult birds and youngsters--end of sermon !
Greens are a problem too. Branches of trees such as the fruit trees,
apricots, peaches, plum, and elm are always appreciated, but it
would take a small forest to do this very frequently. I have found
that a most satisfactory shrub is the pyracantha, a member of the
cotoneaster family. Besides being a mass of bloom in the spring, the
red berries are lovely during the fall and winter. Best of all is the
fact that all the birds will eat the berries at any time during the year.
Here in California the native birds are so fond of them that it is
a task to keep enough of them for your aviary birds.
Another green that is very satisfactory is chard. The stalks are
relished by all the birds, and it now comes in a very nice cherry red
colour, so the plant is not unsightly. When the plants bolt to seed,
the birds are very fond of the seeds when still green. This plant is
easily grown and quite long lasting.
Bread. Although the staff of life for man, many here consider it of
doubtful value for birds. Personally I feel that it is a very good weekly
addition to the diet--and a necessity when parents are with young.
I use a dark whole-wheat bread which has first been dried in the suni
t
Over this I pour water (some use milk) and give to the birds with
families. It must be a great help to the parents, for they are always
there waiting for it when there is a hungry family under hand.
If one is not satisfied with bakery bread it would be a relatively
easy task to bake one's own bread using some of the specially prepared
health flours now on the market. At least a few people I have talked
to are doing this very thing and are quite satisfied with the results.

In July, 1948 ,1 got a lovely pair of Green-rumped Parrotlets (Forpus
passerinus passerinus) from Holland. I put them into a small indoor
aviary in my birdroom, together with Parrot Finches (Red-headed
and Three-coloured) and some Waxbills. They went to nest im-
mediately and reared three youngsters, and after this the Green-
rumped bred regularly every year, with two or three broods.
In 1949 I got a pair of Blue-rumped (Forpus passerinus flavissimus ),
but unfortunately they turned out to be two males. I had them for
a year and constantly tried to find females, but it was impossible to get
any. Then I--in spite of disliking parrot hybrids--mated each of
them to a Green-rumped hen. Both pairs were placed in single cages
with a nest-box outside, entrance-hole towards the window. They
paired up willingly, and a fortnight later both hens were sitting, each
on six eggs. All the eggs were fertile, one hatched five, the other
four chicks, and all nine were fledged.
The hybrids were all nice and fully feathered birds, the young hens
were exactly like their mothers, and the young cocks were less blue
on the rump than their fathers, but after their first moult most of
them turned out quite as blue. I, and other aviculturists, have picked
them up and looked at them side by side with the old cocks and
we could not see any difference between them. It is curious, as the
pure Green-rumped cocks are easy to distinguish, with the lack of
blue on the rump, less blue on the wings, and they are smaller.
Last year we imported some pure Blue-rumped Parrotlets to this
country, but it seems to me that the hens of both pure species and the
hybrids are all alike. I have discussed this with Mr. C. af Enehjelm,
and he is of the same opinion. I should be very glad to hear if anyone
in England can see any difference.
After their first broods the two " mixed " pairs had two and three
broods with respectively three and three, and three, two, and four
youngsters.
Now this year (1953) both pairs are again rearing families, this time
they have big clutches--six and seven young ones, and I have heard
from some of the aviculturists, who got young " hybrid " pairs here
last year, that they have bred too, and their offspring are just as
" blue-rumped " as their parents.
Incubation time for both pure Green-rumped and Green-rumped X
Blue-rumped Parrotlets is 21-23 days, the young ones are fledged in
about thirty days and can be separated from the parents a fortnight
later.
It may interest readers to hear about two other breeding attempts in

The first was with a pair of Red-faced Lovebirds (Agapornis pullaria )
that dug a nesthole in an horizontal parrakeet box (completely filled
with peatmoss for the purpose) and laid three eggs, which were all
fertile, but the young were dead in the shell. It seems to me, that the
hen's sitting was not steady enough, she was too often outside the
box with the cock, who very seldom went into the nest. But never-
theless, I have not been so near success with this species before.
The other pair, who made an attempt to breed, was a pair of Red-
bellied Conures (Pyrrhura frontalis). I got them in May, and as I was
short of aviaries I placed them in an empty lovebird cage, not more
than 60 cm. long, and with a nest-box outside. The birds immediately
occupied the nest-box and enlarged the entrance hole with their
strong beaks. The birds were very nervous and jumped into the
box at the faintest noise in the birdroom, and therefore I saw them
very seldom. After a month or so, I thought of transferring them to
a better and larger cage, and was indeed very astonished to find the
hen sitting. In the nest were four eggs placed on a support of wood-
shavings. Two of the eggs were hatched, one young one died nearly
at once, but the other one lived for three weeks, but was then killed
by one of the parents. Perhaps the cause was the too small nest-box
in conjunction with their great nervousness.
As usual with our fascinating hobby, we must say, better luck
next time.

A TUDOR BIRD-CAGE
By A. A. Prestwich (Southgate, England)
Our member Martin Luther, the well-known collector of antiques
and bygones, has recently unearthed the bird-cage illustrated, and it
has now been added to my collection.
The base measures 17^ inches by 11 inches, and the overall height
is 17 inches. The panels on either side of the " balcony" are not
glass, as one might expect, but mirrors. Consequently, while inside
any bird would have been in very subdued light as, apart from
openings in the sides, presumably intended for food and water
receptacles, there is no other means of lighting the interior.
Nothing is known of the history of this cage. We assume the period
is Tudor, and I would be grateful if any reader could determine the
approximate date. I would also like to have suggestions regarding
the species most likely to have been kept in it.

By Edward Boosey (Keston, Kent)
As it seemed to me that there has been quite enough of E. J.
Boosey in the magazine of late, I intended to have given this number
a miss. However, I recently received such an urgent plea for copy
from our Editor, saying she was really worried about the next number,
that I felt I must try and concoct an article of some kind.
Incidentally, may I add my plea that more of our members would
contribute to the Magazine, thereby greatly lightening our Editor's
load, as well as increasing the general interest of the Magazine ? It
may be that some people who only keep the commoner species think
that members would not be interested in articles about these. In this,
however, I believe they are entirely wrong, for while I think people
like reading about rarities, I think many probably like even more
reading and mentally comparing notes about birds which they
themselves keep.
As I could think of nothing else to write about at the moment,
I am giving a short account of a new colour-variety of the Zebra
Finch, and also of two other recent arrivals at Keston.
A few weeks ago we received a consignment from Australia con-
sisting of ten pairs of a new colour variety of the Zebra Finch, which
were sent over as " Marked White Zebra Finches " which describes
them tolerably well, but we have called them Chestnut-flanked White
Zebra Finches.
They are quite distinct and most attractive, being pure white with
the normal form's black markings dark slate-grey, and the white-
spotted chestnut patches on the sides of the breast clearly visible, though
much paler ; in fact they are rather like a Silver Zebra Finch with the
silver areas replaced by white. Quite a good idea of their appearance
can be obtained from the accompanying photograph of one of our
breeding pairs at Keston.
We sold six pairs, and of the four we retained, one hen died and was
replaced by a White to find out which is dominant. The latter are
sitting, and, of the three pairs of Chestnut-flanked Whites, one pair
is sitting ; the second pair have young in the nest ; and the third
pair have a brood of two just fledged ; the third young one having
fallen, or been thrown, out of the nest at a tender age.
The newly-fledged young are white with greyish heads, which will
presumably fade to white when they come into adult colour. As
far as we are aware, these are the first Chestnut-flanked Whites to be
bred in this country.
Other new arrivals of interest are about a dozen specimens of the

E. BOOSEY-RECENT ARRIVALS AT KESTON
Javan race ( Munia ferruginosa ) of the much better-known White-
headed Mannikin or " Maja Finch " ( Munia maja ).
These are the first of the Javan race we have ever had, and they
are prettier as well as rather smaller than their better-known relative.
The ordinary White-headed Mannikin is, of course, merely deep
chocolate-brown with a whitish head and neck and silvery beak,
but the Javan race has a silver-grey head and neck, and its appearance
is much enhanced by the fact that it has a large bib on the throat and
upper breast, of so deep a brown as to appear almost black, which
adds contrast, and makes it considerably the more beautiful bird of
the two.
We also recently received two specimens of the Speckled-fronted
Weaver (\0x25A0 Sporopipes frontalis) --again a bird we have never had before--
although we have often imported its near relative the Scaly-crowned
Weaver (S. squamifrons ).
In Aviculture, Vol. I, we read of the Sporopipinae : " This group is
composed of two little birds, often kept in captivity, which slightly
resemble the Waxbills." They are described as follows :
The Speckled-fronted Weaver (S. frontalis) : " The forehead and top
of the black head are finely dotted with white, as well as the slight
moustache. The nape and sides of the neck are cinnamon ; the body
above ashy brown, the cheeks and underparts pale beige, beak and
legs whitish. It is about the same size as an Orange Bishop, only
with a longer tail."
The Scaly-crowned Weaver {S. squamifrons) : "Is considerably
smaller than the preceding, which it resembles, the only difference
being that the general colour is less tawny, the wing coverts and
black-brown tail are bordered with white, the crown and the
moustache have white lines instead of dots. The habits are the same.
This species is more frequently imported than the other and has
nested in captivity."
I should have said myself that squamifrons is far more often imported
tha n frontalis, and that the former has little if any tawny in its plumage,
being mainly a white, black, and grey bird.
The better-known of the two, the Scaly-crowned Weaver, is found
in the Union of South Africa, while the Speckled-fronted Weaver
is a bird of Western and Equatorial Africa, and is found as far north
as Timbuctoo in the Sahara Desert country.
Both are lovers of dry conditions, the Scaly-crowned being found
particularly in the region of the Kalahari Desert.
Nobody, seeing these birds for the first time, would imagine for one
moment that they were Weavers, as their shape and general appear-
ance is entirely finch-like. Yet that they are true Weavers is obvious
from the fact that they construct a spherical nest typical of the family,
woven of fine grasses and with a short pointed tunnel-shaped entrance.

In conclusion, I thought it would be of interest to recoid some of
the things Alan Lendon, over here from Australia, told me when he
recently paid a very welcome visit to our farm.
The trouble is that he is such a mine of information on the subject
of Australian birds, that it is difficult mentally to digest all he tells
one during a visit consisting of a single afternoon and evening, so
if any of my facts are not entirely accurate that must be my excuse.
Apparently--as perhaps one would only expect--we in this country
are far behind in the way of colour varieties of Austialian biids.
One of the most interesting things he told me was that he had seen
a blue Princess of Wales Parrakeet, which has since been sold for a
very large sum to an American. I gather that there is a good deal
of fawn-colour in the plumage, the greener parts of which are bluish,
while the pink areas on the cheeks and throat are whitish. The
bird, however, must be very beautiful, as the large light green patches
on the wings are replaced by bright sky blue.
Then there are both lutino and cinnamon Rosellas, of which
Lendon told me he had only seen the former. These must be
very beautiful, retaining, I think I am right in saying, the led
areas as is usually the case with the lutino editions of birds that
have red in the plumage. I gather that these are not just isolated
specimens, but that both lutino and cinnamon Rosellas are being-
bred in aviaries in Australia.
Then, too, there are yellow Gouldian Finches (quite distinct, of
course, from the rare yellow-headed bird), as well as white Diamond
Doves. The former sound rather attractive, as it appears that they
retain, to a certain degree, the red of the head, and also the puiple
of the upper breast in contrast to their yellow body-colour. The
latter may also be attractive, but I personally have never been able
to appreciate an all-white edition of any bird that is so beautifully
marked as the Diamond Dove.

DARENTH-HULME, 1953

A few notes on our birds may prove of interest, perhaps more
especially to members overseas, as indicative of the psittacines available
to English aviculturists.
The main aviaries consist of a range of eighteen houses 4 feet wide,
3 feet deep, with a sloping roof 4 feet high in front and 3 feet at the
back, standing on legs, the floor being raised 3 feet from the ground ;
attached are 30-feet flights, 6 ft. 6 in. high. The occupants of these
aviaries are :--

unfortunately, apparently struck its head and through lying
in wet grass for some hours developed an enteritis. It was
taken over to E. N. T. Vane, and he, with his usual diligence,
succeeded in hand-rearing it, and it is now quite a nice bird.

18. A pair of Cissas.
Running along the back of the shelters there is a service passage
and wilderness aviary, giving a flight 72 feet long and 10 feet wide.
The occupants are three pairs of Purple-headed Glossy Starlings
and a pair of Crested Bronze-winged Pigeons. The Starlings have
shown not the slightest inclination to breed. The Pigeons, on the
other hand, were only too anxious to do so. In spite of continual
interference on the part of the Starlings they eventually managed to
rear two young.
An escape passage and planted aviary, 7 ft. 6 in. wide, stretches
along the front of the flights. The sole tenants of this are, at present,
an aged and somewhat decrepit pair of Peach-faced Lovebirds.
An adjoining aviary, 24 feet by 18 feet, contains a colony of about
two dozen Red-faced Lovebirds. I would have liked to describe
it as a breeding colony, but such is far from being the case. There
has been a certain amount of excavation, but not a single egg.
The chalet-type bird-room houses a pair of Vane's 1951 Noble
Macaws ; two pairs of Golden-winged Parrakeets ( Brotogeris chrysop-
terus) ; a pair of Canary-winged Parrakeets ; a pair of Maximilian's
Parrots ; an Orange-bellied Senegal Parrot ( Poicephalus senegalus
versteri ) ; and half-a-dozen Red-faced Lovebirds, mostly with clipped
wings. A house, 10 feet wide by 6 feet, with flight attached, contains
a pair of White-bellied Caiques.
We keep a number of pairs of the commoner Pheasants--Golden,
Silver, Amherst, Chinese, Reeves'. The nine pens are mostly 22 feet
wide by 17 feet, but there is one 22 feet by 42 feet. The shelters
are made of wattle hurdles and look quite attractive. Pigeons share
most of the enclosures and live in perfect amity with the pheasants,
if not with themselves. We have Bronze-winged, Brush Bronze-winged,
1 riangular-spotted, and, of course, Java and Barbary Doves. All
these have bred successfully with the exception of the Triangular-
spotted, whose chief delight appears to be fighting. When, having
wintered together, two pairs were not separated sufficiently early in
the spring a battle-royal ensued during which one was killed and
another severely injured. A pair, however, now has two young ones
ten days old.
Having suffered depredation by semi-feral cats we had Wolseley
Electric Fencing installed round the entire grounds and this has
proved a very satisfactory deterrent.
Finally, the house parrots consist of a pair of Greys, three Senegals,
a Ruppell's, and a Brown-headed ( Poicephalus cryptoxanthus ).

Of the birds received during the past two months, three are new
to the collection. They are a White-breasted Warbling Finch ( Poospiza
melanoleuca ) ; a Sunda Islands Myna ( Gracula venerata), and the Uganda
Green-headed Sunbird ( Cyanomitra verticalis viridisplendens).
The first is an interesting bird with rather the appearance of a tiny
Shrike and of an inquisitive disposition. The Myna is of the genus
formerly known as Eulabes and quite closely related to the familiar
Nepal and Southern Hill Mynas. The Sunbird is the eastern form
of the Green-headed of tropical West Africa. This specimen was
presented, together with five Red-chested Sunbirds ( Nectarinia
erythroceria) , by Mr. D. Roberts of the East African Fisheries Reseaich
Organization in Uganda. A Kingfisher ( Alcedo atthis ispida) has also
been presented.
A Malayan (or Malaccan) Peacock Pheasant ( Polyplectron malac -
censis) and a Malayan Argus (. Argusianus argus ) have been presented
by the Chief Game Warden of Malaya. A Funereal Cockatoo ( Calypto -
rhynchus funereus) , the first to be exhibited since 193 1 5 a pair of the
pretty Cuban Blue-headed Pigeons, or Quail-doves (Starnoenas cyano-
cephala) , and a Pink-headed or Jambu Fruit Pigeon (Ptilonopus jambu)
have been received in exchange.
The King Penguin hatched in July continues to thrive ; the 1952
bird is now like the other adults except for being paler orange on the
bill, throat, and sides of the head. At the Quarterly General Meeting
in July Head Keeper Jones was presented with the Society's bronze
medal for his skilful work in the rearing of this Penguin. He is the first
Keeper of birds to receive this award.
A second Schlegel's Dove ; two Lesser Black-backed and a Herring
Gull ; two Quaker Parrakeets ; three Chukor Partridges ; three
Vieillot's Fireback Pheasants ; three Bahama Pintails ; six Carolina
and what is believed to be a Chiloe Wigeon X Carolina have been
bred in the Gardens.
The Snowy Owls hatched one quite strong chick, but it did not
long survive. The Gaboon Forest Robin collected in British Cameroon
during 1948 by Mr. Webb has laid a further two eggs, so it may
be that two is the normal clutch. This bird is fairly common in the
Cameroon forest, but practically nothing is known about its nesting.

parrot is still alive and doing well. It is now seven weeks old and
fully feathered, and quite as large as its mother. It is all green except
for a blue forehead ; its cheeks are a lime green, and its body the true
Amazon green. I am just wondering how much longer it will stay
in the nest ".

the hen sat and has reared so far on her own. I realize that the birds

Murray has also bred the common Grey Waxbill. He writes : " Only

GREEN GLOSSY STARLINGS
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.96985868" page_id="58090952"  page_num="Page 177" year="" vol="">
I was interested in an article in the March-April Magazine on African Green
Glossy Starlings. As I have kept and bred them since 1932, I can confirm that the
orange-eyed birds and the yellow-eyed birds are the same--as my original pair
both had orange eyes. Of eight that I have reared to maturity, seven have yellow
eyes and only one has orange eyes. I found these birds extremely easy to breed,
and rear up to the time of leaving the nest, and extremely hard to rear to maturity.
Over the years I must have had upward of fifty leave the nest strong and well,
and I have only reared eight to maturity. The story is always the same--about a
week after leaving the nest the young ones refuse all food. The parents frantically
try to feed them, thrusting the food at their beaks, bodies, and even legs. In three
or four days all such young are dead. On one occasion I had five magnificent young
leave the nest, looking extremely strong, and flying and perching strongly ; in
three days they were feeding themselves--on white ants, grasshoppers, and meal-
worms. In a fortnight all were dead. In exactly the same manner as all the others.
I have always thought that this extremely distressing sequence was due to some
food lack. But what it is, I have no idea. My Starlings are fed on a good soft mixture
with fresh grated hard-boiled egg. They have a good supply of insects, especially
when breeding--white ants, mealworms, grasshoppers, crickets, cicades, etc. They
only give the young live food. They have access to fruit of several kinds, but I have
never seen them eat it. Of course they also have access to grit and calcium.
Once I get them through the first moult they are extremely hardy. In fact, I still
have my original cock, and he was mature in 1932.
Another curious fact is that I have never lost a young one in the nest--but always
about a week after leaving.
I would be very grateful if anyone could suggest what is wrong.

PARRAKEET EYE DISEASE
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.998990928571429" page_id="58090953"  page_num="Page 178" year="" vol="">
Mr. Hastings' account of his experience of diseased eyes in newly-imported
insectivorous birds was most interesting. The extraordinary promptitude with
which he effected cures by dosing them with cod liver oil well exemplifies the amazing
effect of giving adequate doses of Vitamins A and D to vertebrates which have
passed through a period of hardship and malnutrition such as I fear newly-imported
birds very often have.
With regard to the application of this principle to " parrakeet eye disease " however,
the case is somewhat different. Doubtless shortage of Vitamin A in newly-imported
stock renders them more susceptible, and I did make this point in a letter to the
Avicultural Magazine published in the September-October issue of 1952. I was
at first particularly inclined to suspect Vitamin A deficiency, as Xerophalmia is
known to occur in poultry in some parts of Australia--probably due to some local
peculiarity in their feeding. I was soon convinced, however, that it is at the most
a secondary factor. In the first place--the first bird I treated, a hen Barraband, i;
was given very large doses of Vitamin A when she first came under my care, with
some improvement in her general health but none in her eyes. Secondly, all the
others received a Vitamin supplement (containing Vitamins A, B-complex, C, and D)
in the drinking water, which is a routine measure in my bird room for all newly-
imported stock, and all birds kept indoors in winter. Their eyes, nevertheless, only
improved when treated with the antibiotics aureomycin and Chloromycetin, and
relapses occurred if I stopped this treatment too soon.
Xerophalmia can be rapidly cured by large doses of Vitamin A. It cannot be
cured by any other means whatsoever. The birds under my care were not improved
with the Vitamin A they had, but were cured by other means. I think these facts
eliminate Xerophalmia fairly conclusively.
The opportunity of treating more cases is unlikely to arise in future because of
the parrot ban, but I am looking after at present two lovely cock Barrabands, one
English aviary-bred, which contracted the disease in an aviary by contact with a
newly-imported diseased bird. One, the worst case I have ever seen, had a pan-
ophalmitis on arrival ; that is, infection of the globe of the eye itself as well as the
tissues of the orbit. The eyeball actually burst shortly after I received it, and I
expected the bird to die. It did not, however, and seems likely to recover, albeit
with one blind eye. The other bird which had gross disease of both eyes is cured.
As they came from an aviary, I gave neither any Vitamin supplement, but fed
them on seed and green food only.
" Parrakeet eye disease " differs from the ordinary septic conjunctivitis of other
birds in its slow and insidious onset, its long duration, and its extreme resistance
to treatment. The other odd thing is its restriction to a few species of Australasian
Parrakeets. I have only seen or heard of it in Crimson-Wings, Kings, the Polytelines,
Bourkes, and the green Grass Parrakeets. Broadtails appear to be immune, and
I have never heard of it in the Asiatic, African, or South American parrots.

I visited Wassenaar early in June and Mr. Louwman kindly took me to see

in Rotterdam Zoological Gardens. The cumbrous common name of this handsome
Touraco is the Brown-faced Goaway-bird. Sclater considers that there are three

(Turacus hartlaubi)
By Cecil S. Webb (Dublin, Eire)
Hartlaub's Touraco is confined mainly to the Kenya Highlands but
extends into Tanganyika Territory on Mt. Kilimanjaro and Mt. Meru.
In Kenya its chief haunts are the forested slopes of Mt. Kenya, Mt.
Elgon, and the Aberdare Mts. up to 10,000 feet, and it is also not un-
common in the wooded ravines that extend from these mountains into
the highland plains. It was in one of the latter that the writer first
saw this Touraco in the Aberdare range at an altitude of 8,500 feet.
This was in 1933 at which time Hartlaub's Touraco was unknown to
aviculture.
This bird is so beautifully portrayed in the accompanying plate that
it needs no description but those familiar with the Purple-crested
Touraco (Gallirex porphyriolophus) will notice a marked resemblance if
the white facial markings are excluded.
To capture the atmosphere in which Hartlaub's Touraco lives it is
as well to take a glance at the Kenya Highlands, its inhabitants, and
climate. Here, on the lower slopes of the Aberdares, the equator is
near by ; the days are hot but the nights, owing to the high altitude,
become very cold, frequently showing white frost by the early morning.
The air is dry and invigorating and so the daily extremes in tempera-
ture cause little or no discomfort. However, in the rainy season (June
and July) when the highlands are shrouded in mist for days on end,
it is said to be distinctly gloomy and miserable.
The forested ravines, which descend to a considerable depth below
the level of the surrounding country, were brought into being, as was
the Great Rift Valley, by a shrinkage in the earth's crust. To descend
into one of these from the surrounding grassland is a strange experience,
for one is suddenly plunged into a totally different faunal and floral

zone. When I was first there, from early January to the end of April,
the highland plains were alive with migrants, the most noticeable being
Wheatears and Yellow Wagtails (. Budytes flams), there being several
distinct races of the latter from widely separated localities but mingled
together here on common ground. Male Jackson's Whydahs ( Drepano -
plectes jacksoni) could be seen bobbing up and down in the grass like
black balls of fluff doing their nuptial dance, and here and there, where
there was a patch of flowering leonotis in an open situation, one might
get a glimpse of the exquisite Kenya Malachite Sunbird {Nectarinia
famosa aneigularis ).
On approaching the ravine more leonotis, near cover, was in
evidence and here were seen two gems of the sunbird world--the
Golden-winged (. Drepanorhynchus reichenowi) and the Tacazze Sunbird
{Nectar inia tacazze) --both looking indescribably beautiful in the
tropical sunlight.
On entering the forest a remarkable drop in temperature was
evident and before proceeding very far magnificent specimens of wild
olive and podocarpus trees, their branches festooned with masses of
long pendant usnea, came into view. A rustle in the branches indicated
a troop of Golobus Monkeys ( Colobus poly homos matschiei) feeding quietly
on leaves or berries or even on the usnea with which their long-haired
robes harmonized so perfectly. Occasionally one would see a small
party of White-headed Wood Hoopoes ( Phosniculus bollei jacksoni) busily
probing in crevices in the bark for insects, and more rarely a Narina
Trogon (. Apaloderma narina) flitting silently past to some branch, there
to remain like a statue until the spirit moved it on again.
If one were quiet enough the sprightly and gay-coloured White-
starred Bush Robin {Pogonocichla stellata) would almost certainly be seen
hopping in the undergrowth. In more open situations were clumps of
Balsam ( Impatiens) with large Shield-bugs piercing their stems for plant
juices.
Frequently when I was enjoying all these things the comparative
calm of the ravine was broken by the loud croaking call-notes of
Hartlaub's Touraco. This challenge was answered by another bird of
the same species some distance away and yet another more distant
until the whole ravine was echoing with their calls. After a minute or
two of this outburst the strange forest atmosphere suddenly would
return to normal.
Touracos, like most fruit-eating birds in the tropics, travel consider-
able distances in search of food, visiting certain fruit-bearing and
berry-bearing trees scattered far and wide. They travel usually in
pairs (though several pairs may be seen feeding together in one large
tree) doing a regular daily round. One tree that I watched was
visited regularly by two pairs of Hartlaub's which used to arrive
on the scene by sunrise, remain about fifteen minutes feeding, and

then disappear for the day, returning to the same tree towards
5 p.m. for a final feed, presumably on the way back to their roosting-
place. I have noticed these regular visiting hours with other Touracos,
but here in the Aberdares they are upset during the olive season. In
February and March food suddenly becomes so plentiful that there
must be tons to the acre, and search for it becomes unnecessary. As
if by magic there is a sudden invasion of Masai Red-headed Parrots
(\0x25A0Poicephalus gulielmi massaicus ), Olive Pigeons (Columba arquatrix ), and
Sharpe s Starlings (Pholia sharpei ) so that the olive trees are alive with
birds all feasting on the oily berries so lavishly supplied by nature.
The Touracos could be seen to regurgitate the stones once the fruit
had been digested. When the olive season was nearing its end the
pigeons, parrots, and starlings disappeared as quickly as they came,
leaving the Colobus Monkeys and the Touracos in peace.
Hartlaub's Touraco, like all the other members of the family, is
perfectly adapted for an arboreal existence, its partly zygodactyl feet
enabling it to run along branches with the greatest of ease. Also it
bounds from branch to branch more like a monkey than a bird. If
temporarily deprived of the power of flight through loss of its primaries
it will not be greatly handicapped if in forest. It will run through the
branches and jump from tree to tree with great agility and will never
panic and fall if chased.
The tail feathers come out remarkably easily (but grow again
rapidly) which is surely a means of protection. It is by no means easy
to catch hold of a Hartlaub's Touraco by the body for it instantly
arches its wings and bounds strongly forward deflecting the hands to
its rear end and so one is left holding merely a bunch of tail-feathers !
This could easily happen to predators.
By setting a flue net with large pockets in a wild olive tree I was
able to capture six Hartlaub's Touracos. These I kept in a small
aviary until two days before my departure, when a native boy left the
aviary door open allowing four to escape. However the remaining two
were introduced to England in May, 1933.
Since the second world war a number have been sent overseas from
Kenya by certain animal catchers, and a pair found its way to the
London Zoo where they have been much admired. The call of the
Hartlaub's Touraco does not differ greatly from that of the other
Touracos of the same genus. Those who have become familiar with
this sound in the wilds of Africa will be carried back there body and
soul on hearing it in some Zoological Gardens.

By The Late Duke of Bedford (Woburn, Beds, England)
It seems to have been the rather general experience that the past
winter which, while not abnormally cold, certainly began abnormally
early, and was very long and unpleasant, has had an adverse effect
on breeding results this summer.
Rheas apparently found the winter so depressing that neither the
three white birds which are now getting very old, nor the three grey
ones which are young adults, succeeded in producing a single egg.
Indeed the grey cock showed much less sign of being in breeding
condition this season than he did last, when he was only two years old.
With waterfowl the season has been a rather poor one, but not
so bad as 1952, which is the worst I ever remember. Ten Red-breasted
Geese were reared and one young Emperor Goose. The latter was
killed by a mysterious enemy which pecked out its eyes, without doing
it any other injury, twenty-four hours after it was released as an almost
fully-fledged bird among peaceful, moulting companions. The
strange thing is that a similar fate overtook a young Magellan gander
at the same stage of development about the same time last year, and
a few years ago some adult Barnacle Geese suffered a similar fate.
The Barnacles, when they were attacked, were far from the water,
but the Emperor and Magellan were on the ponds. There seem to
be no Crows or Magpies about at the present time, nor are there any
predaceous fish which, if they injured one bird nearly adult, would
also have inflicted injury on others which were adult but were not
noticeably larger.
Of Barred-breasted Magellan Geese I now have only a single female
left. She apparently nested away from the Park, and as usual had her
eggs or young destroyed by vermin. In old days, with no more
efficient keepering, it was extremely rare for broods of this family to
come to grief. Now, however, it is quite the exception for any young
to survive, the only Ashy-headed goslings reared being a few that
were caught up and put under hens as soon as their parents had
brought them to the water.
Snow Geese, Lesser Snow Geese, and Lesser White-fronted Geese,
which for some years have not nested in the fox-proof enclosure in
which they had been placed, were turned out in the Park for the
summer as it is rare for foxes to cause trouble except during the
winter months. None of the birds, however, nested, and spent most
of the time wandering about trying to reach an Arctic breeding
ground on foot !
A fair number of Carolina Ducks and Cinnamon Teal have been
hand-reared. It is unfortunate that the latter pretty little bird usually
falls a victim to coccidiosis when kept in the only enclosure which is

reasonably safe from vermin and that the males, when in breeding
condition, appear to be so spiteful towards their own kind. Full-
winged, they do not appear to stay.
Coming now to the members of the Parrot family, neither pair of
Roseate Cockatoos made any serious attempt to nest, and I have
heard of other reliable breeding pairs in other hands behaving this
year in a similar fashion. The Gang-Gang Cockatoos reared one
young male instead of their usual two children.
The old pair of Brown's Parrakeets, which reared a good brood of
five the first year I had them, but lost their young at ten days the two
following years, this season got no further than inspection of nest-
boxes. A short while ago I found the hen Brown's on the floor of the
aviary shelter holding her head on one side, and evidently seriously
injured as a result of some fright she had sustained during the night.
I expected to lose her, but after some days she fortunately recovered.
For a second hen imported last year who proved an extremely
difficult bird to acclimatize, I managed to secure a mate in late
summer. Although she appeared to be very much in breeding condition
at the time, and the pair took to one another at once, she too, got
no further than occasionally examining a nest-box until it was too
late in the year for it to be any use to encourage a breeding venture.
The new cock had been mated to another hen before I received him,
and in order to avoid complications due to the fidelity common in this
species and some other Broadtails, I took precautions before intro-
ducing him to his new mate to induce in the cock's mind the conviction
that his former marriage was a thing of the past with no possibility
of any renewal. After being kept by himself for a few days before he
was sent to me, I kept him also by himself for some days in a cage
in the strange bird-room. After giving him ample time to become
rather bored and lonely, and to forget his former home and associa-
tions, I had him brought out in his cage to the hen's aviary and put
down quietly just outside it. The introduction went off perfectly.
She greeted him with enthusiasm, but also with the modesty which a
cock Broadtail expects of his prospective mate, and when it was
obvious that he too was favourably impressed we turned him out in
the aviary as quietly as possible.
The old breeding pair of Rock Peplars hatched five of their six
eggs and reared a very healthy family--not a bad performance in view
of the fact that the cock nearly died of coccidiosis last autumn and
was extremely ill for a long period.
One of the two young birds I trained to fly at liberty was lost
through a curious and unlucky accident. I had three odd hens
untrained as liberty birds and, having sold one of them, told the
aviary attendant to catch her up. This he did, but failed to notice
that the catching net had a hole in it. She discovered it while being

carried down to the bird-room, and shortly afterwards picked up one
of the two liberty birds and went away with him, neither being heard
of again. It was fortunate that I did not lose both youngsters.
The old pair of blue Indian Ringnecks again did well, rearing
four young ones. This season the cock, always a rather queer-tempered
individual, got bored with his entire family soon after the young had
left the nest, and had to be removed to prevent him doing them an
injury. A young pair of two-year-old blues seemed to be on the point
of nesting when, through the agency of " X " or some mysterious and
unlucky accident, the little inspection door in the side of the nest-box
got open which so upset and alarmed the hen that she lost all interest
in further operations. The third two-year-old young cock, as recorded
elsewhere, produced two green young when mated to a lutino hen.
The young I am rather afraid are both hens so that, while they would
be split for blue, they cannot, unfortunately, carry any factor for albinism.
A pair of Leadbeater's Cockatoos, three years old, were obtained
too late in the season to give them much chance of settling down to
nest, and the pair of imported Citron-crested Cockatoos are so terribly
nervous that it is not surprising that they also did nothing.
The hen of the pair of Princess of Wales Parrakeets began by
behaving in a tiresome way which is too often characteristic of her
sex and species. She occasionally went into the nest-box, but instead
of depositing her eggs there she laid several from the perch until
I put some soft material under the latter to deprive her of the pleasure
of hearing them fall with a plop on the cement floor of the aviary flight
when she decided to place a few in the nest itself, and even sit on them.
When her young were half-grown she made a hearty meal of their
plumage, so that they left the nest with little more than tail and flight
feathers, but in the end they recovered and showed no sign of the
bad treatment they had received. The cock, unlike many cock Princess
of Wales proved a most devoted husband and father, not only feeding
the hen regularly, but also feeding the young when they left the nest
long after their mother had ceased to take any interest in them.
The Barrabands did not seem a very promising pair as the hen,
imported the previous summer, was extremely badly affected with
eye disease, and was only cured with great difficulty by the skill and
patience of Dr. Lake. When the nest-box was put in, for some time
she took only a very casual interest in it. This, however, did not
please the cock as I was made aware, not so much by the evidence of
my eyes, as of my ears. With Barrabands, the cocks are the weaker
sex so unlike Broadtails they cannot beat up their wives when they
feel the latter are neglecting their domestic duties. What they cannot
accomplish by force, however, they can sometimes bring about by
continual nagging. The cock Barraband, when he is annoyed about
anything, shows it, not only by ruffling his feathers and flapping his

wings, but also by making a peculiar peevish, whining noise. In this
form of complaint the cock Barraband began to indulge from morning
till night until it so got on his wife's nerves that she went into the
nest-box and laid six eggs. Five young birds were hatched and
reared, but one or two of them were somewhat rickety, though others
were good specimens.
Manycolours reared two broods, four cocks and a hen in the first
and a cock and two hens in the second. I kept one of the hens as a
mate to a single cock Hooded to find out how near the hybrids would
resemble Paradise, but unfortunately she has just died. The old hen,
also, became ill with coccidiosis, but eventually made a good recovery.
The first sign of illness was that she appeared to experience a slight
difficulty in flying and when she was at her worst, she was not only
unable to fly, but quite unable even to open her wings. The power
of flight was regained quite suddenly after she had been improving
for some time. On the whole, however, coccidiosis has not been quite
so troublesome this year as it usually is, possibly because I have been
giving all susceptible birds a course of " Embazin " at three-weekly
periods during the dangerous period, i.e. July to October. It is said
that no drug will prevent coccidiosis, but that a bird may be cured
if it has already been infected but the microbes have not yet reached
the stage at which they begin to affect the health of their victims.
Two pairs of Elegant Grass Parrakeets, one consisting of an imported
cock and an English-bred hen and the other of two young birds I,
myself, bred last summer, laid three lots of eggs each, but not a single
one proved fertile.
Turquosines did equally badly. The first lot of eggs from my old
pair were all clear, and the second lot had young dead in the shell.
The third lot produced more young dead in the shell and one chick
that died as soon as it was hatched. The fourth lot I gave to a pair
of Elegants, but the hen gave up sitting just before the Turquosine
eggs were due to hatch.
Bourkes did rather better. My old pair reared two young in their
first brood and two in their second. The cock, just as he did last
year, started to bully the hen when the young of the first brood were
still quite small, wanting her to go to nest again, so I removed him and
disposed of him at the end of the season, as this stupid behaviour is
not normal with Bourkes. In fairness to him I ought perhaps to add
that when I returned him to the aviary for the second! round he was
perfectly well behaved with his two fully-fledged children, although
he had not seen them since they were quite tiny. The second pair
reared three young in their first round and two in the second, a third
dying in the nest. The young cock in the second round is a par-
ticularly beautiful specimen, large and richly coloured, so that I am
keeping him as a mate for the hen with the unsatisfactory husband.

A second pair of Turquoisines only produced two lots of infertile
eggs. I bred the cock myself last year, and had some difficulty in
mating him. The hen, which I got for him last autumn, who was a
few weeks older than he, started to bully him, so that I had to keep
them separate during the winter. When they were in breeding
condition in the spring, I tried them together again, but the cock had
neither forgiven nor forgotten the treatment he had received and
attacked the hen most savagely. I managed to get him another hen
who at first he found attractive but rather alarming. Before long
they became good friends, but as I have already said, have so far
produced no offspring.
The hen Splendid Grass Parrakeet was alone all winter and came
into breeding condition rather early in the spring. After calling
unavailingly for a mate for some time she apparently gave up all
hopes of matrimony and consoled herself by indulging, not wisely,
but too well, in the pleasures of the table, becoming exceedingly fat.
I greatly feared that there might be trouble if she started laying
when I managed to get her a mate later in the year, and my fears
proved, unfortunately, only too justified, for she died egg-bound with
her sixth egg without ever giving us a chance of seeing that she was ill.
Another pair which I acquired in the spring did better, rearing five
young ones.
With some difficulty I succeeded in obtaining two hen Nyasa
Lovebirds. I have a lutino cock imported from Australia some years
ago. In case the cock proved strictly monogamous and ignored one
of the ladies, causing her to feel frustrated and bad-tempered, I
included in the aviary an odd cock Budgerigar together with a violet
cock and rainbow hen of the same species. Both hen Lovebirds went
to nest, and both ignored the Budgerigar but, although the cock was
friendly with both ladies his friendship with one has been I think,
purely platonic, and none of her eggs has hatched. The other
produced three green young ones which, after the custom of most
Lovebirds, she well and truly plucked in the nest, although they have
now grown their feathers perfectly. It would seem that some lutino
Nyasas, if not all, are not sex-linked as an American aviculturist
has bred quite a lot from a lutino cock and a green hen and all the
young, like mine, have been green indicating that the non-sex-linked
cross is recessive. The pair of Budgerigars reared a large brood--
a yellow-faced violet, a yellow-faced cobalt, two ordinary violets, a
cobalt and a sky-blue, and the Lovebirds did not interfere with them ;
indeed the hen Budgerigar was master.
Fischer's and Masked Lovebirds, let alone, of course, Peachfaces,
are most unsafe companions for Budgerigars, but the small Nyasa
and Black-cheeked are often, I think, reliable.

By E. B. Tanner (Finchley, London, England)
Following upon the recent articles on the above subject by Dr. Lake
and Mr. Hastings, I should like to utter a warning to make sure that
the complaint is not due to a simpler cause, namely dirt and germs
introduced through the eye and leading to death by septicaemia, as
the post-mortems have revealed. The same symptoms apply in every
respect. If taken in time, however, four or five applications of boracic
lotion are sufficient to effect a cure, especially if the patient is kept in
a cage alone, with scrupulously clean perches and with clean paper
(not sand) on the floor. It is, perhaps, unnecessary to remind one
that the bird's beak should be held downwards whilst douching the eye,
thus preventing the lotion from being swallowed. Of course, once the
eye becomes swollen and sealed, as described by Dr. Lake, this treat-
ment is of no avail, and my experience in this case has been death
due to the cause as stated above. Perhaps the remedies he mentions
may avail in these cases. During my many years in charge of the
Bird House at the London Zoo I have found that eye troubles could
usually be traced to this source, being undoubtedly contracted from
dirt and germs deposited on the perch by the bird's feet, etc., being
then picked up when the bird follows its usual habit of rubbing
its face on the perch. I am practically certain that the use oi natural
tree branches inside the aviary is one of the chief reasons why birds
pick this up. The rough surface and crevices form ideal lurking
places for dirt and germs, and it is almost impossible to clean them
properly in spite of every care. In outside aviaries where they are
exposed to rain, they are not so bad, but even there I would prefer
planed perches for a high margin of safety, though I know that it is said
that branches are more natural and, with their varying thick-
nesses, are better for the birds' feet. As to the former, it must be remem-
bered that birds do not congregate on one or two branches con-
tinuously, but have an immense selection. I do not think the latter of
very great importance, but planed perches can be of several diameters
if preferred. Of course, they should not be thick enough to catch
droppings when the birds are upon them. I may say that I cannot
remember a case of this sort amongst the birds kept in the small cages at
the Bird House, where they have planed round perches, and cases
always occurred in aviaries where tree branches were used. Eye disease
used to be common amongst birds sent to dealers by sea when the
perches were in a filthy condition on arrival, either due to neglect, or, in
some cases, wrongly constructed travelling cases which did not permit
of the perches or even the water tins being cleaned. I would
advise that a bird should receive treatment as stated directly an eye

shows signs of weakness. The weakness may, of course, be due to the
bird colliding with some object--this often happens--but the bathing
will be of the same service, and will be a safeguard while the eye is
weak and apt to get infected. But perches that can be properly
cleaned are the best of all--a preventative.
I should like to add that I was induced to submit this suggestion on
remembering a number of small private aviaries and also public
collections where tree branches have been left without cleaning or
renewing for long periods, by their appearance. Infected birds could
be seen at times, their owners or custodians being innocently unaware
that prevention was in their own hands.

year, has removed one of the oldest members of the Avicultural
Society, which she joined in July, 1899, and one whom the Society
honoured by making her a life member after she had been a subscriber
for fifty years.
As an aviculturist she was first known for successes in keeping and
breeding owls when she lived at Lyndhurst in the New Forest. For
her as well as for everyone at Jxckford it was great luck that she
should have written a charming article in the Magazine about these
owls, because after reading it Mr. Spedan Lewis got in touch with
her through Miss Knobel, and asked her if she would come and take
charge of a big collection of birds he was forming in the Thames valley.
There she had charge of a collection ranging from Macaws to Sun-
birds and including about three hundred owls, a number of which bred.
Later Mr. Lewis disposed of that collection when he moved to
Leckford, but after getting the estate in good order, he built one of the
finest ranges of aviaries and waterfowl enclosures, and started to
form another collection. Here he and Miss Chawner assembled a
magnificent collection of pheasants, owls, touracous, cranes, and
waterfowl, as well as a number of odds and ends.
Miss Chawner was Editor of the Avicultural Magazine from
1935 to x 938, when she was succeeded by the present Editor.
In 1938 Miss Chawner was also beginning to wish to retire from
her other work and, once again through Miss Knobel, Mr. Lewis
appointed a curator, this time me. I came to Leckford to succeed
Miss Chawner in 1939.

I shall always be grateful that I had the luck to come to know
Miss Chawner really well. She was a highly cultivated woman with
a delightful sense of humour, and was also a shrewd judge of people.
She was an entomologist of distinction and discovered and described
the life cycle of two species of sawfly previously unknown in this
country. When Miss Chawner decided to give up serious collecting,
the Keeper of Entomology of the British Museum (Natural History)
came to see her collection, and took a number of specimens to add to
the national collection. Miss Chawner was also a great botanist,
and would go miles to see a rare plant. Like a number of aviculturists,
she was a really knowledgeable gardener, and it is primarily to her
that I owe the great pleasure I get from growing rare plants, and
indeed for a good number of the plants I grow.
I think Miss Chawner's most striking qualities were her serenity
and her lively interest. She always remained what she was, a cultivated
Victorian countrywoman. She was not only a very good all-round
naturalist, she was also a unique friend to all who knew her well.

THE DUKE OF BEDFORD

<bodyText confidence="0.996500708333333" page_id="58090970"  page_num="Page 189" year="" vol="">
The tragic death of the twelfth Duke of Bedford, which occurred
on 9th October, has been a severe blow to the Avicultural Society
and its Magazine, to the Zoological Society, and to all who are
interested in the keeping of wild animals, including birds, in captivity
under the best conditions. The collection at Woburn was in the
past the finest in the world, thanks to the skill of the late Duke's
father, and much of it has been fully maintained and even improved
by the Duke whose death we now mourn, for he inherited a love of
animals from both of his parents. His father's interest was, perhaps,
chiefly in the larger mammals, the deer, bison, and so forth, but he
also maintained a fine collection of birds such as waterfowl, pheasants,
and cranes, while flocks of Crested Pigeons might be seen in the trees
or on the lawns. His mother was a very good ornithologist, bird-
watcher, and bird protectionist, one of the very first lady members to
be elected to the British Ornithologists' Union, and for many years
Vice-President of the Avicultural Society.
The only child of these animal-lovers grew up to love the rare
creatures around him, and persuaded his parents to let him keep some
himself. He was chiefly fond of birds, and soon had a good collection
of foreign finches, waxbills, and weavers which he accustomed to fly
loose and make their nests in the gardens around Woburn Abbey.
Among the greatest of the Woburn treasures is the herd of Pere
David's Deer which the eleventh Duke started from a very few
specimens collected from various Continental zoological gardens, the

only remnants of the herd that formerly occupied the Imperial Park
in Pekin. Under the care of his son the herd has increased to more
than three hundred magnificent animals, the only ones in the world
except the few the late Duke gave to Whipsnade, Bronx Park, and a
few other places. A very similar story might be told of the almost
extinct European Bison which has probably been saved from extinction
by the Duke and his father.
The war destroyed much of the Woburn collection, but it was
being built up again by the Duke. Only a few weeks before his death
he told me he was going to try to replace the flock of Australian
Crested Pigeons for which Woburn was formerly famous ; but for
many years past the Duke's favourites among the birds have been
parrakeets, of which he had a collection with few equals in the world.
Many very rare species were represented, as well as rare varieties such
as the famous blue Ringnecks. Members of the Avicultural Society
are familiar with his experiments in evolving a strain of Homing
Budgerigars which has proved quite successful, both at Woburn and
in Devonshire, and as recently as last September he invited me to
spend a night at Woburn so as to be able to see the release of the
Budgerigars in the early morning.
In a large outdoor aviary amongst wooded surroundings were some
hundred or so birds, mostly from early broods this year, and at
7.30 a.m. a door at the top was opened and out flew a crowd of various
colours which had apparently been waiting for this moment. They
flew around in evident enjoyment, some settling upon the high trees,
while others made straight for a bunch of millet sprays, but many
circled around showing off to perfection their arrow-like flight which
can never be seen properly inside an aviary. None of them seemed
to want to go far away from the aviary which they regarded as their
home, and to which they kept on returning through funnel-shaped
openings in the sides. It was a wonderful sight, never to be forgotten.
Under the title of Marquess of Tavistock the Duke (who succeeded
to the full title in 1940), has written many very excellent articles for
the Avicultural Magazine, of which he was for a time Editor, while
his Parrots and Parrot-like Birds has proved of great value to many
aviculturists. He had never lost his early love of wild creatures and
had kept up as far as possible, the wonderful collection established
by his father. He was a thoroughly good man, and besides his great
love of birds and beasts, was very kind to those of his fellow human
beings whom he considered needed his help.

Introduction
Before 1938, when the first known nesting took place at Tring in
Hertfordshire, there were probably less than twenty authentic records of
vagrant Little Ringed Plovers ( Charadrius dubius) in Britain. Since
then the bird has invaded our country in earnest, finding a habitat
mainly unexploited by other species, and now in 1953 is well established
as a regular summer resident (probably about 100 pairs at a very
rough estimate) in south England--from Berkshire in the west (with an
outpost in Gloucestershire), to Kent in the east, Sussex in the south,
and Northants and Cambridgeshire in the north--with the main
population centred in the London area. Yorkshire and Stafford also
have some pairs, but in Wales and Scotland the bird is still only an
irregular visitor. I do not propose to deal further with spread and dis-
tribution here, for this has been fully treated by E. R. Parrinder in the
pages of British Birds, Bird Notes, and the London Bird Report, but rather
place emphasis on behaviour, some aspects of which I aim to describe in
fair detail, basing my remarks mainly on personal observations on
several pairs in Berkshire since 1949. As a background for this descrip-
tion I have given a " potted " life-history account in the next section.
Now that many observers are Little Ringed Plover conscious, I
doubt that the birds are overlooked to any extent, but prior to the
later war years this was certainly not so. Confusion is possible with
the larger Ringed Plover ( Charadrius hiaticula ) and I wonder how many
Little Ringed were formerly written off as the common species. The
two birds are readily distinguished though very alike in plumage. The
best distinction is that while the Ringed has a clear white line on the
upper wing surface the adult Little Ringed has none at all (but
beware, for the juvenile Little Ringed has the very faintest suggestion
of one). Additionally, I find that the orange-yellow eye-rim of the
Little Ringed is a good field-mark which the Ringed lacks ; even
unfledged young have lemon-yellow eye-rims visible at very close
quarters. There is also a marked difference in the adult's bill colour ;
the Ringed has a conspicuous yellowish bill base while for field purposes
the Little Ringed's is more or less entirely dark. A less satisfactory
character of the Little Ringed is the thin white line over the forecrown
behind the black forehead band. The usual call-notes heard (which
are in fact the alarm-notes) at once separate the two species : the
Ringed's is a liquid " too-ee " (with emphasis on the last syllable), the
Little Ringed's a more incisive " pee-00 " (with stress on the first).

Their habitat preference, though there is occasionally slight overlap,
is generally distinct, the Ringed being the sea-shore species, the other
the inland fresh-water one. Of course, both species may occur on the
other's habitat on migration.

It is probably still too soon to attempt an accurate survey of the
main arrival period of Little Ringed Plovers in this country from their
winter quarters abroad. Our records are not sufficient and there seems
to be a great deal of wandering by, presumably, first-year birds which
may turn up at a site for the first time quite late in the season, as may
other individuals which have bred unsuccessfully elsewhere in the
country. However, April is probably the month in which most birds
arrive, but in the last few years March records have increased (earliest
local one, 25th March). Male and female may reach the breeding-
ground at about the same time and, while it is not certain, or even
likely, that they travel together, they do at times form pairs very soon
after arrival. Often, however, the male comes first and is joined by a
female later, nineteen days being my longest record of the interval
between the two arrivals. It is possible that lone females settle for only
a relatively short time, sufficient to rest and feed, at sites unoccupied by
males.
While on the Continent Little Ringed Plovers are mainly river
birds, where they nest on shingle-banks, etc., in England gravel-pits
and the like are the main habitat. Some of these pits are much
frequented by humans, but the birds are very tolerant. What the
plovers need most are not peace and quiet (though very desirable) but
some mud or marshy spot on which to feed, and a stretch of not too
overgrown gravel on which to nest. In this country man would seem
to be the species' main enemy--in the form of gravel-pit workers and
their machinery, over-keen bird-watchers, heavy-footed trampers,
egg-collectors, etc.
On the breeding-ground, soon after arrival until departure, the male
Little Ringed Plovers, especially, show a variety of aggressive
behaviour-patterns towards other individuals of their own species
(aerial and ground display, call-notes, and, occasionally, fighting),
particularly in the area of the nest-site. They do not, however, confine
themselves to their territory but wander locally, learning to avoid
neighbouring territories, and feed at " neutral " spots which no one
pair owns, though aggressive behaviour may be shown there.
Sexual behaviour may appear soon after the arrival of the birds ;
in fact the very fact that male and female are paired is by itself a sign
that sexual relations have already commenced, at least at low-intensity
for pair-formation is no doubt effected by attempts at the coitional-
ceremony (see below). Copulations and scrape-ceremonies may be

seen almost at once and early arrivals can have eggs by the third week
of April, though May seems to be the month when most eggs are laid.
The clutch of four takes just over three weeks to hatch and the young fly
about three weeks after that. Both parents incubate and tend the young
but sometimes the male plover is left " holding the baby " while the
female at least prepares for a second brood, or, in the case of later
nestings (June-July), actually leaves the breeding-ground. Genuine
second broods (i.e. not repeats after failure) have not commonly been
recorded (Bruce Campbell gives no instances in his recent book
Finding Nests (1953)) ; in fact my own records of local birds in 1952,
when two pairs laid second clutches, seem to be the only British ones.
Some adults leave the breeding-ground as early as July (when others
are still engaged with repeat or second-brood clutches) but August is
the main departure month, birds being less frequently noted in
September. There are as yet no foreign ringing recoveries of British
Little Ringed Plovers (only a comparatively few have been ringed) to
give us even a pointer as to the wintering area of our birds, but this
undoubtedly is the Mediterranean region and northern Africa.
Sexual- and Aggressive-Behaviour
Much recent work on birds and fish by comparative-ethologists has
demonstrated an important fact about the display of animals : when
an individual displays the main drive behind its behaviour at the
moment is in some way stopped from fully expressing itself. To expand,
a male performing its courtship-display is urged on by its sex-drive.
This drive has, as its basic objective, copulation with the female but
display appears instead, perhaps when the sex-drive is low in intensity
or when the female is not fully responsive, but most commonly when it
comes into conflict with one or both of two other drives aroused at the
same time--aggression and escape (" fear "). Both of these are a very
usual response to close contact with fellow members of the species, and
the male just cannot help feeling towards the female in the same way.
Similarly, when a male performs threat-display, this is a sign that the
aggressive-drive, which has attack as its basic aim, is inhibited--
usually by an escape tendency. Thus, while the distinction between
sexual- and aggressive-behaviour in the Little Ringed Plover is clear
enough, it is not absolute. In this species too, there is a strong element
*f aggressive feeling in the courtship reactions, and both sexual- and
aggressive-behaviour are mixed with an element of escape. This link
is well demonstrated by the male's 14 upright " display and associated
activities, which usually precede copulation, the whole sequence of
which it will be convenient to describe next.
The male plover approaches the female in an initial posture very
similar to the horizontal threat-display (see below), his gait a smooth,
gliding run [glide-run). Often she shows pure escape-reaction by

K. E. L. SIMMONS-THE LITTLE RINGED PLOVER
running away and " bobbing ", i.e. standing and jerking the head,
neck, and forebody upwards a number of times, a typical response of
alarmed waders. Sometimes she flies off with the male in chase, but
usually she allows him eventually to catch up with her on the ground
without flying away. The female being relatively still, the male's
display can continue. As he nears her, his footsteps get progressively
shorter, his speed diminishing, until he stands alongside the female
with a deliberate marking-time movement on the spot, sometimes with
such vigour that he strikes his breast with the alternately raised feet,
the body however remaining steady all the while. During this approach
he raises his body from the horizontal to the vertical plane with chest
expanded, black band conspicuous, and head held high (upright
posture ). The female meanwhile has crouched down and the male soon
mounts. Copulation proper does not always follow immediately, the
male squatting down on bent tarsi, perhaps continuing to mark time
on her back for a few seconds, sometimes as long as half a minute.
Coition itself is effected very rapidly as the male flutters off backwards,
his tail bending under the female's which may tilt to facilitate the union
of the cloacas. Once, a nondescript high-pitched note was heard.
Both birds then glide-run away from each other (escape) and com-
mence displacement-feeding (see last section for a note on " displace-
ment-activities "). Occasionally the male may show the same sequence
of display (approach, upright-posture, marking-time) to rivals and
undoubtedly this is the mechanism of pair-formation, as the German
ornithologist Laven found to be the case in the Ringed Plover. If the
approached bird crouches it is accepted as a female and display,
mainly aggressive till then, switches over to a fully sexual response.
If, however, it shows male behaviour, threatens back, etc., the responses
continue on their aggressive course, a fight perhaps resulting. A further
interesting fact supporting the view that the pre-coition display is
partly an aggressive one, is that the whole copulation ritual may
follow a territorial encounter in the Little Ringed. I have noted a very
similar state of affairs in the Great Crested Grebe (Podiceps cristatus),
a species I have been studying since 1948. The courtship-display,
which is however not a pre-coitional one, often follows aggressive tiffs
between rival pairs ; on analysis, the aggressive elements of the display
can be seen clearly. Another link between sex and aggression is
provided by the displacement-feeding that occurs after coition in
Little Ringed Plovers. This is a common component of normal threat
behaviour when escape is the main tendency. Sometimes a newly
formed pair will give alarm-calls when the two birds approach each
other closely.
The scrape-ceremony, a beautiful display pattern connected with the
nest-site, is best dealt with under sexual-behaviour. Though it is not
a pre-coitional display, the male quite obviously has the female in

mind when performing, indeed the presence of a second bird is
essential, and the normal copulation behaviour may follow or precede.
The course of events is initiated by the male who begins to form, or
enlarge, a hollow in the ground {scraping) by leaning forward and
rotating on his breast, body and tail slanting up, feet scratching
backwards. At the same time he opens his tail feathers, showing the
conspicuous pattern of brown, black, and white, and as he rotates his
movements cause the tail to wave about conspicuously ( tail-flagging ),
this probably functioning to attract the female's attention. She may
then approach the scraping male and, if so, he gets out of the hollow,
stands on the rim with his back to the female and now fans his beautiful
tail right open over the scrape ( tail-spreading ). She slips under and
into the shallow pit and he moves slowly away, tail still spread, at the
same time picking up little pieces of stone and jerking them over his
shoulder towards the nest (. stone-tossing ). As he gets further away his
tail gradually relaxes. The female meanwhile may remain still in the
scrape, rotate in it or move away. The male may then return and
repeat his pattern or follow the female and scrape elsewhere, but
sometimes the activities merely die down or copulation follows. Over
the course of days, several scrapes may be formed, but eventually the
female chooses one and lays her eggs in it. That part of the scrape-
ceremony from the approach by the female onwards, has been termed
the symbolic-nest-relief by Continental writers.
I have already spoken of the horizontal threat-display , a version of which

precedes the upright-posture and marking-time activities of pre-coition.
Both sexes use this against rivals, holding the body horizontally,
normally with the head sunk well into the shoulders, thus mainly
hiding the black bib, and with the feathers of the underparts smoothly
expanded, the flank ones pointing up over the closed wings. (In the
pre-coition version, the under feathers are not so fully emphasized.)
The aggressive bird glide-runs in this squat looking posture towards
the opponent, a sure sign that real attack is not immediately imminent,
for when it is the bird relaxes its display, the black chest-band coming
into prominence, and runs purposefully forward, at high-intensity
raising the back feathers a little and fanning the tail. Fighting may
follow this, launched with the wings, and bill and claw are used if the
birds get to grips, but this comparatively rarely occurs. Only occasion-
ally will the attacked bird stay to argue the point. If it does the two
birds perhaps even then only jump up breast to breast and separate
again to threaten each other. At times, during more intense threat-
display, the head may be less tightly sunk into the body and then the
black bib shows up well. At lower intensities, the bird may stand or
walk slowly about, with little or no orientation towards the rival, with
the head held back, but not deeply sunk into the body, to meet the
back feathers which are smoothly mounded up to a moderate extent
[hunched-posture ). The white under-feathers too are only slightly

expanded, the flank ones not pointing up over the wings, and the bib
is not hidden. The tail may be spread and lowered, and at times the
plover may stand up a little from the horizontal. In all display the
orange eye-rim shows up conspicuously. A special threat-note (termed
the hostility-cry by the Dutch ornithologist Sluiters) occurs during
aggressive encounters (but not prior to copulation). This is a fast,
mechanically ringing and rather musical " gree-gree-gree ..." which
becomes more slurred and higher pitched as it increases in speed.
Less commonly, a series of low rolling rattles may be heard. At very
low intensity the birds cease to display and displacement-feed or
preen ; here we seem to have to do with a weak escape-drive.
Apart from ground threat, the male also has a fight-threat-display used

against flying intruders or from the air to birds on the ground. On
seeing a trespasser in such circumstances (and at times the male
plover is very unselective, reacting to his own mate and a variety of
innocent birds of several species), the attacker moves towards it, in
fast flight if the other is airborne, giving the hostility-cry. This may
develop into display on close approach, the male stalling with rapidly
quivering primaries raised in a medium V and describing a narrow
arc. The tail is often fanned and, if the intruder is on the ground,
perhaps elevated while the feet are slightly lowered. At the same time
as the bird goes into display, the call changes to a very fast buzzing-note.
This may sometimes be given in flight without the display. No real
attack occurs in the air, but any of the ground activities may follow
when the bird alights.
Butterfly-display-flight is another aggressive pattern. It commonly
follows ground encounters with rivals, often when these have left the
point of conflict, but sometimes occurring when no rival is involved
at all, as for example when the male returns to the territory from
outside. In this display the plover flies round the territory, curving
backwards and forwards with the wings slowly beating, well extended,
causing an illusion of a short tailed bird, and describing a com-
paratively small arc. Sometimes the bird tilts more from side to side
with the wings flicking rather quicker, emphasizing the pale under-
surface. A monotonous rusty-call, the " song " of the plover, accom-
panies this slow-motion flight, a deliberate " cree-ah(k)-cree-ah(k)-
cree-ah(k) . . .". Some authors have called this display-flight a nuptial
one but this interpretation is extremely doubtful. I have never seen it
obviously given to the female and even if it is on occasions, we probably
have to do with a case of the female releasing aggressive-behaviour in
her mate.
On 22nd May, 1953, I saw an apparently unusual and interesting
encounter between two males (A and G) at a feeding spot used by A
for well over a month, but which now was presumably claimed by G
as territory for a short while. When I began watching at 06.50, male A
was scraping at moderate intensity and tail-flagging for a short while,
more often merely standing and stone-tossing. His mate was incubating
well-sat eggs about 300 yards away over the water. Male C was
standing, facing away from A, a half-dozen or so yards from him, in
the hunched-posture. At the same time he dipped his head and bill
down towards and ground and back again several times, with the rest
of the body quite still. Later observation showed that this was incipient
stone-tossing. This male then glide-ran in the hunched-posture,
finally turning towards A, tail fanned and lowered, and uttering a long
series of hostility-cries. Both males then moved about in the hunched-
posture, neither really facing the other, giving intermittent hostility-
cries while A (apparently) also uttered several alarm-notes (" pee-00 ").

Both also performed the head dipping movement which developed into
stone-tossing and scraping, and displacement-fed occasionally on
reaching softer mud. Finally, C flew up in low-level flight-threat-
display at A and then circled about in butterfly-display-flight with
hostility-cries from time to time, sometimes when flying just above A.
Observations ended soon after at 07.30. I do not pretend to understand
this encounter but it suggests a further link between sexual- and
aggressive-behaviour.

Copulation and scrape-making being achieved successfully, the
breeding-cycle continues. No material is brought to the nest-scrape
by the plovers which reach out from it and pick up items such as flakes
of mud, dry bents, and the stones that tend to collect about because 01
the stone-tossing activity. These are added to the cup, which some-
times becomes quite substantial. It is interesting to note that the very
large nest of the Mute Swan (Cygnus olor) accumulates in a similar way,
by the raking-in of material by the sitting bird. Stone-tossing in the
Little Ringed Plover is not confined to the scrape-ceremony, but may
occur during incubation, when the clutch is incomplete and also when
the parents change over at the nest.
Eggs are laid on alternate days and four make up the usual clutch,
though later ones may be of three only. Incubation of sorts may start
with the first egg but it probably becomes most sustained some time
between the laying of the third and fourth. Both sexes incubate and
the eggs hatch out in just over three weeks.
The first signs of hatching may show several days before the tiny
chicks escape from the shell. The eggs first fracture at the point in the
large end where the chick's bill, equipped with a whitish " egg-tooth "
on the end of the upper mandible, taps at the shell from within. Such
cracking may appear as many as five days before hatching though
sometimes the fracture is still not obvious only a day or so before the
emergence. At about the same time as fracturing, the youngster may
be heard faintly calling " chip " or " cheep " if the egg is held up to
the observer's ear. Doubtlessly the brooding parents can also hear
this. As the tapping inside the egg continues, the shell is pushed
outwards until a hole appears and the bill of the chick is visible.
Finally the shell splits open into two main parts and the chick has
hatched. The broken pieces are carried away from the nest and, so
strong is the urge to do this, that I have seen a parent, calling its
young after disturbance, chance upon a fragment of shell from the
hatching one or two days previous and carry it away immediately to
the water's edge. The chicks often hatch within a few hours of one
another, apparently usually overnight. Sometimes one may be as
much as twenty-four hours behind the others, but a more or less

synchronous hatching would seem to be desirable. The young soon
leave the scrape, especially if disturbed, and a late egg may be left
behind unbrooded. At one nest an egg had only a small hole in the shell
some twelve hours after the others had hatched. The three chicks had
left the nest so I acted as midwife by enlarging the hole with my thumb
nail. Even so I was worried lest no adult returned to the nest, but in the
evening one of the parents was seen to go to the scrape, call the chicks
to it, and brood them and the egg together. The latter had hatched
out by next morning and all four youngsters successfully reached the
free-flying stage.
The chicks are damp on coming out of the egg and need brooding,
indeed brooding is the main task of the parents during the first week or
so of their youngsters' lives. The adults do not usually sit fully on top

r
of the chicks, like they do on eggs, but rather half stand, with fluffed
underparts, and allow them to creep in underneath. Generally one
parent is on duty at a time while the other waits " on guard " near by
or goes off to feed. The young are not fed, though one popular writer
has stated that they are. They find their own nourishment in the form
of minute invertebrates (mainly insects) on the gravel or at the water's
edge. The stomach of one very small chick, not much more than
twenty-four hours old, contained the remains of many tiny beetles.
Apart from brooding, the parents' other important task is to warn the
chicks of danger and to deal with the would-be predator. The only pre-
dator of which I have had experience is man in the form of the observer
_myself. On being approached by a human the bird utter the alarm-
notes (" pee-00 " and " cloo "). When very young the chicks probably

always immediately crouch flat down at this and remain perfectly still,
but larger young are usually only put on guard on hearing the calls.
They show alarm by " bobbing " and displacement-feeding, only
crouching when they see the predator or when the parents fly up from
them, calling. Once down the chicks remain there until the observer
has gone and the parent has reappeared. Small chicks advertise their
position to the adult with a rather high-pitched piping. Larger young
are called up to the parent by a fast repeated " pip-pip-pip-pip . . . "
Fig. 5.--Chick crouching (drawn from life).
call. The best way of locating the chicks when unobserved approach
is impossible is to allow the parent to locate them for you. First flush
the adult, then retire to cover, or as far away as possible in the open,
and stay still. Almost invariably the parent will soon resettle and,
after initial alarm, go to or call up the chicks. Even if these are old and
require no brooding, the return of the adult will stimulate them to
move about again, but the older the chicks are, I find, the harder they
are to track down. The younger the chick, the stronger the parental
brooding-drive and the swifter the return to them. I once had the
wonderful experience of seeing a female come and brood her single
tiny chick only five feet from me as I lay perfectly still flat out on the
gravel. The call of the young on being persistently handled is a trilling
purr of a note. The chicks swim readily if needs be, even when not
disturbed.
Apart from the behaviour outlined above, the adults may exhibit
a very complex and elaborate set of reactions towards man, the potential
predator. My studies have mainly dealt with this form of behaviour
and it is worth outlining the whole gamut of reactions to man through-
out the annual cycle in order to put those occurring during the chick-
stage in their proper perspective. It is impossible, however, to give all

the intricate details and complex discussion of facts in the present
paper.
In the winter and early days after arrival at the breeding-ground the
main response to the close approach of man is escape. This takes the
form of " pee-oo " alarm-notes, bobbing, displacement-feeding, and
flight away. When the plovers have settled down in the breeding-
territory, but before eggs have been laid, they still show alarm but
seldom fly away unless really very closely approached. Instead they
run ahead of the observer, tending to adopt a crouching position with
legs bent, head in, and body more or less horizontal [crouch-run ). This
is often followed up by displacement-feeding. If the birds do fly they
seldom go far. Some factor is inhibiting the full expression of the
escape-drive, and we think that this is a tendency to attack, though the

birds dare not do this to such an immense upright predator as man.
Occasionally, however, the male will break into the territorial butterfly-
display-flight and even utter the buzzing-note towards the intruder--
a sure sign that he is feeling aggressive to him. Just before egg-laying
another pattern appears. At the end of a crouch-run away the bird
may stop and, instead of displacement-feeding and/or calling, it may
lean forward and crouch down on the ground, sometimes in a hollow,
and remain still there as if brooding eggs, perhaps for over a minute
at a stretch if the observer does not approach. It may perform this
displacement-brooding several times in succession. All the behaviour listed
so far continues to be shown during incubation, but then the birds tend
to do the brooding movement incompletely, crouching with the body
slanting forward sharply, stern in the air, vent showing, and the legs
only half bent [squatting ). They tend now to run in a similar posture on
occasions, in short dashes [high-tailed run) and the more incubated the

eggs become the more inclined are the birds to perform the most
complex of the reactions to man-- distraction-display. Until the hatching
time, however, the plovers do not draw attention to themselves in the
area of the protectively coloured eggs. They fly silently away with
perhaps the first signs of peculiar flicking wing action ( impeded-Jlight)
and show the more elaborate behaviour at some distance. Apart from

the usual alarm-note, " pee-00 ", another call with a hard edge to it is
common now, a fast repeated " cloo ". Near hatching time onwards,
and especially during the first few days of the chicks' lives, the parents
are liable to perform intense distraction-display if sufficiently stimu-
lated. Impeded-flight becomes very pronounced as the birds flit round
the observer and calling increases a great deal. As the chicks get
older the elements of reaction drop out one by one in the order in
which they appear, until when they are free-flying the adults are
showing the same reactions as in the pre-egg period.
Distraction-display is very intricate, varying much in intensity
depending on the age of the chicks and the degree of stimulation. High
intensity display is to be expected when the young are small, lower
intensity prior to hatching and when the chicks are older. However,
once when I was ringing two-week old young, one gave its purring
alarm-note and immediately one of the parents flew at my head,
swerved off, and broke into violent and totally unexpected display.
In the following description the full intensity sequence is outlined ;
at any one moment, of course, the behaviour may be at any stage in
this sequence and elements may be omitted. One so often reads that
simply such-and-such a wader runs off fluffing its feathers and trailing
a wing, that I may be forgiven for going into detail in order to show
how much more is usually involved.
Crouch-running is the first ground reaction, probably after the plover
has circled round in impeded-flight. This is succeeded by high-tailed
running, the bird pausing and then dashing off again. Soon, at the
end of a run, it may sidle to one side, sway its body round a little to
get a better view of the observer, and then squat, the wings being now

free of the flank feathers. The first element of true distraction-display
( wing-hinging ) may now appear. With ducked head, the plover starts
to move the closed wing outwards, at first with perhaps only a few
slight tremblings. Soon the wings are trembled jerkily with a rotating
action, the primary-tips moving out well from the sides. The bird
often tilts over, now to one side, now to the other, hinging the opposite
wing. The observer is soon conscious that much more white is visible

on the upperparts than is normally the case, especially in the rump area.
This is because the flank feathers are fluffed right up over the sides
and on to the back so that only a narrow band of brown shows down
the centre. The bird's conspicuousness is further stressed by the pale
under-tail and belly feathers. On increasing intensity the wing move-
ment speeds up into a rapid fluttering, still with the side-to-side tilting,
and the tail may be fanned into its striking pattern and depressed to
the ground. The position of the wing feathers is interesting all the
while. The secondaries remain folded over the primaries as when
normally closed at the side and the wing literally hinges outwards and
forwards with the carpal fixed still at the side of the bird's breast. The
pale undersurface of the wing is thus exhibited to the observer, who
always views the displaying plover from behind. Wing-hinging
develops into wing-rotating. The folded wing is now held out from the
side, the carpal being no longer fixed, the bird raises its body more
erect and rotates the wing rather like a schoolchild doing its elbow-
circling exercise. The tail is usually fanned and lowered. From this
the bird may switch to high-wing raising. The primaries of one wing
suddenly flick out from under their secondaries, both retaining the
same relative levels as when folded so that the wing is now curved.
The wing is held straight up and is usually tilted forward slightly,
showing the undersurface. The bird may rest thus, leaning on the side
away from the raised wing, or occasionally flick up the other wing as
well, lying with them both up and tilted forward. At still higher

intensity open-wing flapping occurs. With both wings partially or wholly
open, the bird vigorously beats now one several times, now the other,
against the ground, turning the body frequently as it does so. Some-
times the wings are merely flicked up and down one at a time,

occasionally both together. Although the plover usually high-tail runs
between bouts of static display, it may now and then run on while still
displaying and occasionally fly low over the ground or water with tail
still fanned and depressed and with very ungainly wing movements,
probably a compromise between display and impeded-flight. Even
more occasionally it may perform a display-run with the wings twitching
up and down alternately at the sides. I once saw a beautiful version
of this when a bird ran off twitching the wings under the fully expanded
and lowered tail. Displaying birds are often silent. The two alarm-
notes may be given during pauses or when the bird is merely squatting,
but a pecular chattering-call accompanies very high intensity display at
times. While performing the bird tends to make partial use of cover,
displaying in hollows, behind mounds, etc. The more worked up it
becomes the nearer it displays to the observer. Really close display
is not common, however, under usual conditions. 1 he best way of

effecting a near approach is for the watcher to lie down. Probably
when he destroys his outline and height he ceases to be a human as
far as the plover is concerned, and the bird becomes less afraid. Often
it stops displaying and then attempts to reach the chicks and brood
them.
Miscellaneous
In the broad details of its behaviour the Little Ringed Plover is very
similar to its near relations, the Ringed and Kentish Plovers. The
aggressive-behaviour of all three is much the same ; though the threat-
displays and notes differ in form, they all have more or less the same
butterfly-display-flight. The Little Ringed, however, alone has a well-
developed flight-threat-display though there are signs of this activity
in the Ringed Plover at least. Sexual-behaviour is more or less identical
in Little Ringed and Ringed but very little seems to be known about
the Kentish. General breeding-behaviour is closely similar in the three,
except that the Kentish regularly lays only three eggs and these are
often nearly covered over by the nest-scrape material. The distraction-
displays follow the same general trends, though there is much variation
in detail, but the Ringed and Kentish have commonly used display-
runs. So close is the behaviour of these ringed-type plovers that they
seem regularly to try to keep one another off their breeding-territories.
Avicultural evidence of interbreeding, which does not occur in the
wild, would be very interesting. I wonder if any aviculturist would
kindly advise me as to the possibility of keeping any of the three
plovers in captivity from an early age onwards. An opportunity of
such close study would be invaluable.
Male and female Little Ringed are practically impossible to dis-
tinguish in the field except at close quarters with the aid of binoculars.
Then it may be seen that some females are definitely browner than
their mates about the head markings, especially the patch through the
eye, and have the orange eye-rim less bright. I find the sexes of the
Ringed Plover easier to tell apart, again mainly on the intensity of the
black markings, while in the Kentish there is a well-marked sexual
dimorphism.
The Little Ringed Plover is a ground feeder, obtaining most of its
food near or at the water's edge, on gravel, short grass, mud, etc. Its
gait while hunting is a twinkling run, the bird stopping and dipping
its body forward to seize prey. It shares with the Lapwing (Vanellus
vanellus ) and the gulls ( Larus ), among others, one curious habit
apparently connected with food-seeking--that of making pattering
movements of the feet on mud. In the two plovers this is a trembling
action of one foot only while the gulls mark time with both feet. The
habit probably functions to bring prey to the surface of the damp mud.

Mention has often been made elsewhere in this paper of displace-
ment-activities, a concept which owes much for clear definition to
Tinbergen and his school. In general terms, a displacement-activity
may be described as a movement occurring when the internal drive
in action at the moment is not the one which normally produces that
movement. Thus, in the Little Ringed Plover it was seen that dis-
placement-feeding occurs during encounters between rivals, after
coition and in response to predators. Here we most probably have to
do with a blocked escape-drive in some way and it is worth noting that
on occasions the bird utters the alarm-note while doing the feeding
movements. These movements are usually performed incompletely,
the plover not really seizing and eating prey, but sometimes the full
pattern is enacted, especially in response to predators at a stage in the
breeding-cycle when distraction-display does not normally follow on
increased stimulation.
Finally, a word to would-be Little Ringed Plover watchers. A great
deal of work remains to be done on the behaviour and general biology
(and I hope the present paper doesn't show too much how true that
statement is !). For instance, we still need to know much more about
pair-formation and the only descriptive side of aggressive- and sexual-
behaviour has been touched upon in any detail, full analytic study
being needed. The breeding-biology requires to be worked out in
detail and measured. Among other questions are the following. Do
the parents ever call the young to food sources, as do many gallinaceous
birds which the plovers approach in so many of their behaviour
patterns ? What are the natural predators ? Does the male Little
Ringed bear the brunt of the incubation duty when the eggs are fresh,
as the male Kentish Plover (Charadrius alexandrinus ) seems certainly
to do ? The queries are numerous and the intending watcher is
guaranteed a busy and interesting time whatever his bent.

Icoturus komadori komadori (Temminck)
By A. H. Isenberg (Woodside, California, U.S.A.)
" Loochoo 55 Robins are among the most charming birds of the
world, and are native to the Riu Kiu Island chain south of Japan.
The species varying in coloration with their Island home. The species
here mentioned is from Amami Oshima in the north of the group.
In my forty-odd years of collecting soft-billed birds, I have seldom
long been without a male " Loochoo 55 Robin. The females are
extremely difficult to obtain, the reason being that a male call bird
is used in trapping, and females generally stay away. The males are
very aggressive fighters. Of the only two females I have had, one was
received in 1949, the other in early 1952.
The 1949 bird had two eggs, and sat for ten days, when a bowel
upset killed her. This story relates this year's success. When the
1952 bird arrived, I had two fine males, one I had had for more than
twelve years, the other about two years, and to this one my hen was
mated this year. Since the female was not in fit condition upon
arrival, I was compelled to keep her separate until April, 1953 *
The female was in a large cage inside the 50 feet by 25 feet aviary
where the male could see her for these many months. Early in March
the male built a nest in an old natural log nest-box, but the female was
not released until April. When released the male did not at once
display, but he did sing to her and kept going in and out of his log,
which is 18 inches from the ground, trying to interest her, but she
would have none of it. There was another log nest hung about 8 feet
up on a dead tree trunk, and to this one the female took a great interest,
and in three days she had put quite a few dry bamboo and old moist
leaves into it. The male was seen to look in once in a while, but he did
not assist in building. The hen filled the log nest to within about
3 inches from the hole, and then formed the nest with dry grasses and
horsehair. Now the male was seen to display and sing to his mate,
and a pretty sight it is. He struts, not unlike a Turkey, with lowered
wings, tail fanned out and held up over his back the while a torrent
of lovely song pouring forth. The actual mating is a violent affair,
so much so that I thought he would kill her with his fierce onslaughts.
The next day one egg was seen in the nest, and another the next, then
a third and sitting in earnest began. This log nest had a very large
hole which worried me, as any bird or mouse could get in, but all
went well for fourteen days, the male was a perfect guardian, and
chased every other bird that came within ten feet of the nest, small
or large ; Grey Thrush, Chestnut-bellied Rock Thrushes, Indian

The hen prepared small mealworms, flew to the nest with them in
her beak, and then ate them, which indicated something was wrong.
Upon looking in the nest I found it to be empty ! I blamed a number
of things, other birds, mice (of which there were a few), but no doubt
it was the male wanting to mate again, etc. I then caught the female
and caged her for a week, thinking the rest would do her some good ;
the male all the while went in and out of " his " nest. After again
releasing the female, the male tried and tried again to interest her
in his nest, but she chose a small square parrakeet nest-box which I had
nailed some nine feet up on the concrete block wall of the shelter to the
aviary. This nest-box has a platform under the ij in. diameter
hole which she usually used before entering. She almost invariably
approached the nest from the same direction. This box had been
used as a sleeping place for an Indian Nuthatch, which was promptly
killed by the male Loochoo before I could stop it. The female Loochoo
again built the nest, and laid her three pale buff-coloured eggs after
the usual pretty courtship. The male did not assist in incubation, but
made quite a nuisance of himself fighting with all other aviary inmates.
When the female had sat for a week, I caged the male so that he could
see the nest and sing to her.
On the fourteenth day one young hatched, and on the fifteenth day
there were three young in the nest. We were very lucky in having a
good supply of very small mealworms, and many in the soft grub stage,
also I had an old beehive with thousands of wax moth larva, to which
the female was partial. All went well until the fifth day (my wife
would feed her at regular intervals six or seven times a day, or approxi-
mately every hour when I was not home). We gave the hen two or
three worms or grubs and larva at a time, which " dose " she two
to four times took to the nest. Each time, for approximately the first
week, she waited to swallow the faeces of the young, after which
she carried the fecal sacas the length of the aviary, dropping them
into the water. On her third trip to the nest I could hear her jumping
up and down in the nest, and then she let out a Loochoo Robin shriek,
and emerged with a dead young in her beak. She flew the fifty feet
length of the aviary with the young one and I after her, she dropping
it in the water. My spirits sank after this, as I pictured the other two
young with the same fate, but luck was with me. On the seventh day
all was going along beautifully, when I discovered a place not far from
our house that had thousands of earwigs in old benches and tables,
which were easily collected by holding a large bowl under the earwigs'
hiding spots and pounding the spots with a hammer, upon which the
insects literally poured out. I rushed home with my find, and needless
to say '' Mamma " Loochoo recognized the earwigs at once. I gave
her only two at a time at first, after I had snipped off their pincers
with a fingernail clipper. The next day I increased the number, but

always alternating with small mealworms, grubs, and wax moth
larvae ; once in a while I had a 4 flying daddylonglegs and a moth
or two for her.
On the twelfth day my wife and I began discussing whether we
should take the young or not. I held off until the fifteenth day, which
was a bit late, as the young were ready to fly, and fly they tried when
I did take them. It was almost a full day before they would take
food from me, and one of them I did have to force a bit, but the next
day all was well, and they begged for food readily. At this stage the
tails hardly showed, and it was at least two weeks before they had
tails long enough to wag up and down in true Loochoo style. The
young were rusty brown and heavily speckled with lighter brown or
fawn. I was surprised to hear them tuning up quietly when two weeks
out of the nest. Now at approximately ten weeks, white and black
feathers are showing, and some of the reddish ones too. The face and
underparts up to now were greyish. As I write (8th August) the white
underparts are quite noticeable, and the black feathers too, also the
rich reddish-brown of the male is beginning to develop, but not the
black face as yet. I hoped that both would be females, but no such
luck. I feel certain the dead chick would have been a female. I am
most contented with this success, even though on ist August the female
and mother of these two succumbed to a bowel upset. I tried Aureo-
mycin and Enos Fruit Salts, but to no avail. Tragedies like this are
difficult to understand, especially when the aviary is ideal for Robin-
type birds, having much leafmould, lawn, bushes, rocks, moss, running
water, bamboo forest, logs, etc., etc., and the male was caged. The
female did not appear to be aged either. Oh, the patience of an
aviculturist !
I will not, however, wait another thirty-five years for another
female, but will go myself if friends in Japan can t get me one. If I
were down to my last bird I would want it to be a Loochoo Robin.
By i st September the two young males were in full colour and in
fine condition and singing quietly all day long.

" . . . the Ministry will be prepared to issue a licence for the im-
portation of five parrakeets from Holland on receipt of an under-
taking that your poultry have been removed from the premises and
that none will be kept in future. The undertaking must also state
that none of your collection of birds will be sold, either the progeny
of the imported birds or any surplus stock from the collection, and
that no birds will be given away or disposed of in any way other
than by destruction."
The quote is from the reply of the Ministry of Agriculture and
Fisheries to an application made last May for a licence to import five
Brown's Parrakeets from Holland, where they had been for some two
months and had been described to me as " perfect nice and healthy ;
5 pieces being 2 cocks and three hens " !
After some " negotiation " (if such is the right word to use in regard
to a Ministry Department) the restrictions were, in the particular
circumstances of this case, modified to allow the import of the birds on
my undertaking to remove all poultry from my premises and not to
keep any in future, to isolate any birds imported from the rest of the
collection for two months, not to sell, give away, or otherwise dispose
of them, and not to sell, give away, or dispose of any of their progeny
during the following two years. Negotiations had, however, lasted so
long that my Dutchman became impatient and disposed of some of
the five so eventually I only got a pair. In the meantime, however, a
fine cock Brown's had been obtained from Sir Crawford McCullagh as
a mate for another hen imported last year.
When, a couple of months later, I applied for, and obtained, a
licence for a cock Crimson-wing, also from Holland, though the restric-
tion as to poultry was rigidly adhered to the other provisions were
slightly modified so as to provide that " the birds will not be sold,
given away, or disposed of in any way other than by destruction or
re-export ". Allowing the restrictions to be necessary, and it rather
looks as though they have now come to stay, they must surely result
in the loss of all the rarer species of parrakeets through natural wastage
and in-breeding. But why pick on the parrots ; what of the finches,
weavers, and others still arriving ?

T. R. HOLMES WATKINS-IMPORTATION OF PARROTS
May-June, 1953) materialized then for myself it was never better. It
was also unique in that every adult mated hen nested and with one
exception reared their young and there were some remarkable egg
outputs. The collection now comprises exclusively Kings, Crimson-
wings, Princess of Wales', Pennant s, Brown's, Pileated, and Splendids.
Among individual results and deserving of mention were firstly
Pennant's. As most Princess are inveterate breakers so are most cock
Pennant's inveterate eaters of eggs which is a very good reason why
I think, so few are reared each year. I have at last devised a nest
which excludes all but the most venturesome cock with the result that
the two girls and I between us reared eight young.
Secondly Kings. The loss of the breeding hen last autumn after but
one successful season was a big disappointment. A second hen that for
the past four or five years had, with cocks that had failed to fertilize
her eggs, laid and incubated clutches of six or seven eggs was mated to
the widower. Instinct must this year have warned her what was about
to happen for she laid but three eggs all of which hatched and were
very well reared. Of all the parrakeets I keep, or have kept, Kings are
the favourite and what a joy it is to feed a breeding pair with young.
So soon as these chicks attained any size a pound of seed, half an
apple, and vast quantities of groundsel were eaten each day. The two
birds bred last year have turned out to be both cocks.
And, finally, a word about the Splendids. The season has con-
clusively proved that they are no more liable to sudden death than
any other parrakeet and are reasonably easy to breed. I have yet to
lose a bird from a broken skull or neck ; some broods are steady from
the first, others wild, though not excessively so, and these latter almost
invariably knock the feathers from the crown of the head and fracture
the skin immediately they come out of the nest, but for that matter so
do a good many other young parrakeets that are bred here. The type
of aviary you use and its seclusion or otherwise undoubtedly has a lot to do with
these " mysterious " deaths one hears so much about.
With the original hen, this season four of her 1951 hens were used for
the first time. The five produced in the first " round " forty-six eggs.
There were inevitable breakages amongst the eggs and loss of newly
hatched youngsters by the inexperienced hens (it was one of these
hens that was the breeding failure, she losing one by one her five young)
but the joint effort of the others resulted in twenty-two very good young
being reared. Second nests were almost a complete failure, for which the
weather was entirely to blame, and only one further young bird was
reared from four clutches. Two hens apparently thought they might
miss the boat if they sat, so decided to play safe by abandoning their
eleven eggs and falling into moult instead ; they were probably right,
as one of their sisters did lose her small brood when the weather
turned quite cold late in September.

By I. Baty (Ponteland, Newcastle-on-Tyne, Northumberland,
England)
Something over a year ago I sent in an account of my Elegants which,
judging by correspondence I have received, seems to have been read
by quite a number of members, so I am continuing the story in the
hope that it will be of interest.
To recapitulate, I started with one pair in the autumn of 1946
received from Dr. Alan Lendon. Breeding results were :--
1947. --Nil.
1948. --Three.
1949. --Three plus three from the young hen of 1948 paired to
one or other of her brothers. Total six.
!95*.--Three pairs of breeders--three each from the two older
pairs. Total six.
195 r ---Still three pairs--Pair No. 1, three young ; pair No. 2,
six young ; pair No. 3, nine young. Total eighteen.
1952.--As for 1951, except that pair No. 2 had seven young-
making the total nineteen.
And so to 1953 when the story is not so " elegant ", though it is
none the less interesting. We had a wonderful spring in the north,
which encouraged the birds to breed earlier than usual. Pair No. 1--
the original Australians--laid their first egg on 1st April, as did
pair No. 3, my most prolific pair. Pair No. 2's first egg appeared on
7th April--and the dates are significant because of what happened
later.
Pair No. 3's four eggs were all the eggs I was able to see while the
hens were brooding, because the other two hens always rushed back to
their logs whenever I entered their flights in the hope of getting a peep
at the eggs.
I did not record the date when I found that pair No. 3 had hatched
their four young, but they were not more than a day or two old.
Within another day or two I managed to look into the No. 2 nest and
found only one young one alive, another dead, and a clear egg.
Prepared to take a risk, I took out the young one, put a 1953 Budgie
ring on it, and put it into the No. 3 nest along with their four. I cleaned
out the No. 2 nest in the hope that they would go to nest again--which
they actually did.
Then I began to reckon up dates and decided that it was long past
time for pair No. 1. to have hatched. That evening I managed to get
a look into the No. 1 log and found five eggs. This was new from the
old Australians, which in the previous five years had never varied
from having three eggs. But the lapse of time made me certain that

they were not going to hatch. I took out an egg, broke it, and, as I
expected, there was a fully developed chick " dead in shell I reached
down, took out the remaining four eggs, and threw them in the dustbin.
Imagine my consternation when I saw that three of the broken eggs
contained live chicks, but the damage was done. Just too bad.
But worse was to follow. The next day I found hen No. 3 lying dead
in the flight. I blamed cats, which are my real bete noir. On looking
into the log I saw that all five young were alive, but would they survive
long ? They were little better than tiny pieces of meat covered with
down. To cut a long story short the cock has reared all five, and they
are as fine as any I have seen.
Pair No. 2 were slow in getting on with their second nest, but when
I went abroad at the end of July they had three fully-feathered young
almost ready to leave the nest. On my return towards the end of
August there were two fine young ones flying about, the third having
died after leaving the nest. Perhaps cats again. On looking into the
log I found the remains of a fourth young one which had died at an
early age.
I was not sure that the old pair No. 1 would attempt a second nest,
but they did, returning to their normal practice of three eggs. This
was new for them, because they had always been single brooded.
Again something went wrong. I found two of the eggs broken and the
third very dirty and " neglected " looking, so again I cleaned out the
nest. This must surely be the end--but it wasn't. Just before I went
away the old hen laid again !--a third attempt.
On my return I found this old hen a dreadful mess. She was plucking
herself. But she had three well-developed young ! Now comes a curious
part of the story. This hen had always plucked her young--sometimes
rather badly--so that they looked wretched when they left the nest
though they all fully recovered from the disfigurement. This time
when she has plucked herself she has scarcely touched the three young
which are now flying like hawks, and are actually the wildest I have
ever bred. That is a puzzle I have not solved--they are in the same
aviary, have the same nesting log, and the feeding is the same as it has
been since I got them seven years ago. But I prefer the hen to pluck
herself rather than the young--if there has to be plucking.
So in spite of tragedies 1953 has provided ten young Elegants, which
means that sixty-two have been bred here since 1948) which is not
a bad record. And what are they like ? I may be forgiven if I give
you the opinion of a real expert.
A week or two ago I had a surprise visit from Dr. Alan Lendon--
and I wish I had the space to enlarge upon the pleasure that visit
afforded me. I was able to show him the original pair he sent me in
1946 with their three young, and all the others except one which had
been sold, and he was kind enough to say that these birds are as fine

as any he has seen, even in the wild. I regard that as praise indeed,
coming from one whose knowledge of Australian parrakeets must be
second to none.
Dr. Lendon was not sure whether the birds he sent me were wild
caught or bred by him. If the former--and he has promised to let me
know when he returns to Australia and his records--it adds to the
interest because it may add a year or two to the age of the old pair
which have been so persistent this year. They are certainly seven
years old, and may be considerably more.

A Mantell's Kiwi ( Apteryx australis mantelli ), presented by the
Government of New Zealand, arrived by air at the end of September.
It travelled via Honolulu, San Francisco, and New York, receiving at
each stop kind hospitality and refreshment in the form of earthworms.
Mantell's is the only Kiwi inhabiting North Island ; three others
live in South Island and a fifth on Stewart Island. Since 1851 some
twelve Kiwis of four different forms have been kept in the Gardens,
one of them living for just over nineteen years and one or two laying
eggs.
Owing to its dislike of daylight, this present bird is being exhibited
for twenty minutes only each day at 2.45 p.m. ; it is, of course, very
active at night.

Members and guests stood in silence for a few moments as a tribute
to the memory of Miss Ethel Chawner and of the Duke of Bedford.
Before introducing the speaker for the evening the Chairman pre-
sented the Society's Medal to H. J. Indge, for breeding the Red-sided
Eclectus ; and to E. N. T. Vane for breeding the Moustache Parrakeet.
In his inimitable manner E. N. T. Vane gave a brief outline of the
trials and tribulations likely to be experienced by the would-be
bird photographer.
He then showed a selection from his collection of Kodachrome
transparencies to illustrate " Parrots in England To-day ". It is
probable that at present the Order Psittaciformes is represented in
English collections by about one hundred and forty species. Now that
the parrot ban has been reimposed it is highly improbable that some of
these will ever again be seen alive in England. It is Vane's intention
to build up as complete a photographic reference library as possible.
He would be glad to have information concerning the whereabouts of
rare species.
About seventy species and varieties were shown. Some of the more
interesting were the lutino Blue-fronted Amazon, Hooded, blue Indian
Ring-neck, and yellow Blossom-headed Parrakeet at Woburn ;

H. J. Indge has repeated his success of last year in breeding the

F. H. Rudkin, Sr., writes : " Have you noticed the colour change of
the beaks of young Derbyan Parrakeets ? When they first leave the
nest they all have red beaks. Then after about three weeks they all
turn black. But at or about their first moult the young males' beaks
turn red like their male parent, and the females' beaks remain black
like their mother's.
I had a pair of Valley Quail in an aviary. The hen laid about
twelve eggs and then died. The cock took over and sat for about
twenty days. He brought off eight chicks and has cared for and
brooded them well."

The trapping pool in St. James's Park is now being operated and
ringing is progressing in earnest. It is the aim to ring all the ornamental
wildfowl in the Park, including those which are pinioned. The birds
caught so far have been pinioned, but these are being ringed for
record purposes. The full-winged offspring of the pinioned stock
continues to elude capture but there is now a much better chance of
catching them. The Society's special blue rings are used by the Bird
Sanctuaries Committee, Ministry of Works. Ring size 4 is usually
recommended for Pintail, but the Birdkeeper, our member W. H.
Punter, has found size 3 a better fit, moving freely up and down the
tarsus.

C. af Enehjelm writes : " My young Black-crested Finch ( Lopho -
spingus pusillus) hatched 4th May died suddenly on 29th July, a big
disappointment. I still have a youngster hatched 6th July. A nest of
two hatched later died when six days old. The hen is sitting again,
for the fifth time, on two eggs. I have bred seven Red-headed Parrot
Finches, five and two. The hen is at present sitting on four eggs.
A pair of Bicheno's Finches had six youngsters in their first nest, and
now have four small young ones. I have bred about a dozen Cherry
Finches (A. modesta) from two pairs. Parrotlets ( F . passerinus ), one
pair has produced seven and seven, and another pair two and three.'

Captain R. W. Veitch sends news of his Alexandrine Parrakeets :
" My seven-year-old pair this year reared four very good young.
This is the first time I have had four in a nest. Most broods have
been twos with occasional threes and I have bred them almost without
a break for 18 years. The strain is a very good one and the birds
are much bigger than imported birds. They have never shown any
sign of attempting a second brood, and the young birds stay in the
nest until almost as large as the parents, but only grow the two long
central tail-feathers after they leave the nest. My twenty-two year
hen is still well but laid no eggs this year."

MENABONFS BIRDS. By Athos and Sara Menaboni. Michael
Joseph, Ltd., London, 1952. Price 84 s. net.
This book on American birds is beautifully presented and auto-
matically falls into the class of books suitable for handsome gifts.
There are no less than thirty-two plates in colour, thirteen in black and
white, and a large number of smaller black and white illustrations.
The originals of these have been loaned by the owners, private
collectors, the National Audubon Society, the American Museum of
Natural History, and the Kennedy Galleries, and were chosen as the
best examples of Menaboni's work.
The book opens with an introduction giving the life story of Athos
Menaboni and his wife Sara, both of whom, Italian born, migrated to
America where they met, and tells of their early struggles throughout
which a passionate love of birds predominated. The rest of the book
is written by Sara Menaboni, who relates in diary form the experiences
of herself and her husband with birds and beasts. Mrs. Menaboni
gives her impressions and opinions in a light conversational style, and
includes many personal details.
The majority of species depicted are not familiar to European
readers, but the Mallard, Pintail, and Ring-necked Pheasant are of
course similar to the European birds, and the Wood Duck, more
commonly known in Britain as the Carolina, and Canada Goose, are
both well known.
A brief description of the bird is given on the back of each colour
plate, and similar descriptions of the black and white plates are found
at the end of the book.
The reproductions of both colour and black and white plates have
achieved a beautiful softness of tone, but some are not so successful
as others.

Feathered Ones : the Beautiful Life of the Birds). By Richard
Gerlach. Illustrated. Fifth enlarged edition. 1953. 401 pages.
Hamburg : Claasen Verlag. DM. 16.80.
On rare, much too rare, occasions there comes to the desk of this
reviewer a book on birds whose author, very fortunately, combines
a keen knowledge of his subject-matter with an equally keen command
of language. The result is a piece of writing which at once brings the
reader not only much useful and often little-known information but
also information clothed in a style of writing which is a delight to read--
again and again.
Such book is the present volume--without question a work of art,
not likely ever to get out of date simply because it presents the truth
as the author sees it--accurately, spiritedly, charmingly. The book is
filled with highly individualized observations of bird life in all its
fascinating phases, mostly European birds, but also some foreigners.
There is nothing commonplace or trite about either Gerlach's observa-
tions or his writing. With special enthusiasm I read his fascinating
commentary on the songs of birds. I recall not a single bird book in
recent years which equals Gerlach's in point of piquancy and charm
of style. The American book which comes nearest to it in quality of
style and in keenness of observation and description is Dawson's The
Birds of California --a classic in its own right.
There are no dry-as-dust technical descriptions burdening Gerlach's
work ; every page in it sparkles with a delightful liveliness as it tells the
reader about habits, songs, and numerous other activities of birds.
Later sections in the book are devoted to bird migration ; and one of
the most informative, rarely found in bird books, is the one devoted to
biographical sketches of eminent bird students, such as Bechstein, the
Brehms, Heinroth, and others.
If you read German at all, be sure to add this book to your library.
It's the sort of thing you will want to read at least once a year, if not
more often.
Carl Naether.

Bengalee x Cordon Bleu Hybrids.
Although both Weaving Finches, Uroeginthus and Munia are well apart, never-
theless hybrids between birds of these two genera have been proved possible. A
Mr. G. Johnstone residing at Tenterden (Kent) had hybrids arise from the mating
of a male fawn and white Bengalee and a female Cordon Bleu. No birds, other
than Canaries and a pair of Zebra Finches were in the enclosure. As far as could
be observed the Bengalee appeared to undertake not only most of the feeding, but
a large share of the incubation. Five eggs were deposited, and four were hatched

apparently on consecutive days. One died at 11 days, and another at 4 2 days,
which was sent to me, and is still preserved in spirit. It is a small darkish brown bird
with white chin and a few white feathers at the edge of one wing, otherwise at this
period it resembled a very large dark brown juvenile Cordon Bleu without blue.
The form of mandibles and tarsi and elongated appearance favoured this bird rather
than its male parent. Regarding the two remaining birds, I understand that later
they became more like Bengalees and the male survivor showed a reddish-purple
patch on the cheek.

A TUDOR BIRD-CAGE

<bodyText confidence="0.992875363636364" page_id="58091005"  page_num="Page 222" year="" vol="">
Several readers have very kindly sent me suggestions regarding the bird most
likely to have been kept in this cage. In appearance it is said to bear a resemblance
to a West of Ireland lark cage, and this is probably the most likely species.
My special thanks are due to the editorial staff of Country Life who went to a great
deal of trouble in this matter. I am informed that there is a well-known picture
of a Goldfinch by Carel Fabritius, painted shortly before his death in 1654. The
bird is shown, not in a cage, but perched on a box to which it is attached by a long
chain from one of its legs. It is suggested that possibly the example under notice
was more in the nature of a bird-box, to which the bird retired at night, being let
out on a chain during the day. In the old days it was apparently not uncommon
for birds to be kept in this manner.

BREEDING PARROTLET HYBRIDS
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.9627084375" page_id="58091005"  page_num="Page 222" year="" vol="">
Referring to the article by J. Dalborg-Johansen entitled " Breeding Parrotlet
Hybrids ", which appeared in the September-October issue of the Avicultural
Magazine, he says : "It seems to me that the hens of both pure species and the
hybrids are all alike."
The differences (other than those of plumage) mentioned by Neunzig are as
follows :--
Blue-wing Parrotlet: Length, 120 mm.; beak, whitish; feet, blackish grey;
eyes, grey to dark brown.
Emerald-rumped Parrotlet : Length, 130 mm. ; beak, whitish ; feet, flesh-
coloured ; eyes, brown.
He further mentions a subspecies (Psittacula deliciosa Ridgw.) which is smaller
(120 mm.) and of a brighter green. The birds I bred (see Avicultural Magazine,
September, 1926) certainly were not larger than Blue-wings and must have belonged
to this subspecies. They came from Dutch Guiana and their pink legs definitely
enhanced their beauty.

BREEDING OF THE LINEOLATED PARRAKEET
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.976485" page_id="58091024"  page_num="Page 241" year="" vol="">
(Bolborhynchus lineola lineola)
By A. A. Prestwich (Southgate, England)
The Lineolated or Lineated Parrakeet--possibly Barred Parrakeet
is preferable--was first described and named Psittacula lineola by
Cassin in 1853.
It appears to be by no means a common species, though of wide
range : Peters gives its distribution as " Subtropical zone in the
mountains of Central America from southern Mexico to western
Panama ", but being such a inconspicuous little bird it might easily
be overlooked.
Very little seems to have been written about this parrakeet and
what little has tells us almost nothing respecting its habits in the
wild state.
O. Salvin (1871) writes : " Mr. Godman and I discovered a small
flock in the Volcan de Fuego [Guatemala] at an elevation of about
8,000 feet above the sea-level. We saw them in a tree overhanging the
track to Acatenango, above the Indian huts of Calderas, and succeeded
in securing three of four specimens before the rest took fright and
flew away."
Emmet Reid Blake (1953) in his recently published work, merely
says : "A rare bird in Mexico, this species occurs only in dense forests
at high altitudes."
This parrakeet has been imported spasmodically in small numbers.
The Zoological Society of London received its first example in 1886 ;
followed by two in 1889, and a fourth in 1895. Since then there have,
of course, been a few others, and a couple or so were added to the
collection during 1951-52.
Mr. D. Seth-Smith had a pair at one time, and writes : " It is
somewhat delicate, and should never be subjected to a lower tempera-
ture than 6o* Fahr." The Duke of Bedford says the same, but I believe

</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.943909311111111" page_id="58091025"  page_num="Page 2" year="" vol="">
he is merely repeating Mr. Seth-Smith's observation and that it was
not based on his own experience. The present writer wintered
(1926-27) a pair in an unheated, well-sheltered aviary in the New
Forest ; and last year two pairs were not taken in until mid-November,
by which time there had been two or three light frosts. All last winter
Mr. Vane kept a pair in an unheated bird-room and on several
occasions the drinking water was frozen--they suffered no ill-effects.
Mr. Norris, on the other hand, has two pairs that show signs of
extreme discomfort when subjected to even a slight reduction of
normal temperature. These experiences are somewhat inconsistent
and it is perhaps best to play for safety and to take them in at the first
sign of frost.
The plumage is not identical in the sexes, as is generally stated.
The female is slightly smaller than the male and appears to be stouter
in build. The rump is less strongly spotted with black ; all the black
edges to the feathers are narrower, especially of the lesser wing-
coverts ; the tail is wholly green, the feathers not being broadly tipped
with black as in the male ; the beak hardly differs in form.
The Lineolated is slightly crepuscular in habits. In daytime it is
usually quiescent, and " freezes " for long periods. It frequently
perches lengthways on branches, and one is irresistibly reminded of
a miniature Nightjar. It may be said to creep rather than walk : I do
not remember ever seeing this bird actually walking on the ground.
It is not generally realized how many psittacines prefer to sleep
hanging head downwards ; the Lineolated decidedly has this
preference.
During late 1951 and early 1952, possibly thirty pairs were im-
ported. I rather fear that only about five or six survive to-day. Three
pairs were secured for the " Darenth-Hulme " collection ; one pair died
within a few days, but the four survivors did well and were put in an
aviary from late spring until late autumn. Both pairs took possession
of lovebird nest-boxes, but I think merely for use as dormitories, at
any rate they made no attempt to breed.
On being returned to their aviary in 1953, both pairs immediately
re-occupied nest-boxes. On several evenings both pairs were seen to
indulge in what was apparently a form of courtship. A pair would
stand facing one another, stretch vertically to the fullest possible
extent, and with beaks interlocked remain in this position for a few
moments. On no occasion was coition observed. This display gave
cause to hope that one pair at least would nest in earnest. Owing to
the secretive nature of these birds it was decided that should they
nest it would be best to leave them entirely to their own devices, and
not to interfere with their nesting in any way whatsoever. Conse-
quently, it was not possible to determine the incubation period or to
note the colour of the nest down.

A. A. PRESTWICH-BREEDING OF THE LINEOLATED PARRAKEET
One pair had four eggs but only hatched one ; the other three
contained well-developed embryos. The parents, having only one
young one to look after, reared it remarkably well. The young one,
a male, is fully as large as its parents. The colour is rather paler than
in an adult, the markings are less distinct, and there is a slight bluish
tinge on the head.
The other pair had five eggs which they eventually deserted, when
it was found that three were fertile and two clear. The nest-boxes
had about an inch of peat moss placed in the bottom, otherwise the
nests consisted of nothing apart from a few feathers.
These charming little parrakeets do very well on a mixture of canary,
white millet, oats, and a little hemp. Soaked millet sprays are greatly
relished, and soft, sweet apple is an essential part of their diet.
It is believed that this is a first complete success. Miss M. E. Baker,
of Loughborough, had a young one leave the nest in 1913, but
it was accidentally drowned. It is a little doubtful that it was fully
independent of its parents and the event is usually considered an
incomplete success.
Any member or reader knowing of any other breeding of this species
in Great Britain or Northern Ireland is requested to communicate at
once with the Hon. Secretary.

One season has now elapsed since I gave an account of my Los
Angeles aviaries. Some birds have been reared and new ones have been
added. It was too early to expect anything from the ducks or the
Palawan Peacock Pheasants, but a few Harlequins and Painted
Quails have been reared by the parents. A pair of Diamond Doves
produced five pairs of young, while only one young of the silver
variety was raised ; there are also three young Mountain Witches,
one Bartlett's Bleeding-heart, eight Brush Bronze-wings, all from
one pair, and three Pigmy Doves. Interesting species have recently
been added : Blue-headed and Ruddy Mountain Pigeons, from
Cuba ; Moustache and Martinique Ruddy, the former never imported
before, I think, and very attractive, as well as scarce in the West
Indies, and some lovely Jobi Ground Pigeons from New Guinea,
which used to breed so well at Cleres.
Among the passerine birds, four Painted, three Bichenow's, and
eight Long-tailed Grassfinches, three Diamond Sparrows, and two
Cuban Finches were reared ; one pair each of grey, silver, and white
Zebra Finches raised over forty young.
I keep adding a number of species to my small collection, and
naturally I have had to build six more aviaries near the top of the
garden : a block of three, each 11X5 feet ; another one of three,
9 X 3 feet. These useful little pens have a good shelter open to the
south, and prove excellent. One contains various weavers, Parson, and
Zebra Finches, a pair of Ruddy Mountain Pigeons, one of Peruvian
Ground Doves, and Australian Swamp Quails. The next two are
inhabited by various Australian finches, a pair of Yellow-winged
Sugar Birds bred in a canary cage at the San Diego Zoo ; a pair of
silver Diamond Doves, Blue-headed Pigeons, and Painted Quails. The
three smaller compartments are dedicated to Gouldian Finches and
Plumed Ground Doves ; Budgerigars of uncommon varieties, most
of them from Cleres, Mearn's, and Harlequin Quails, and Bleeding-
heart Pigeons.
Some nine species have been added to the large flight over the
stream ; a trio of Imperial Pheasants, reared in 1953 by Mr. Macken-
sen, who keeps a breeding pair for me ; a pair of the rare Hawaiian
Ducks, kindly sent by Mr. Paul Breese, Director of Honolulu Zoo,

four South African Jacanas, a pair of Hartlaub's Touracous, a Long-
tailed Glossy Starling; Australian Zosterops, Japanese Varied Tits,
Australian Lapwings, Blue Scaly Quails, and a few other birds have
been placed into other aviaries.

IR F. J. APPELMAN-BREEDING OF THE CROWNED WOOD-PARTRIDGE 5
Circumstances have prevented this year my usual visit to Europe,
but according to Mr. Fooks's reports, the birds at Cleres are flourishing.
A number of new species have been added, including Ocellated
Turkeys presented by the San Diego Zoo, rare waterfowl, pheasants,
doves, parrakeets, and small birds. The collection there is now
reaching its old standard. All the birds which I rear in California, and
others presented by friends, are finding their way to Cleres, while
some have been purchased in Europe, in Africa, Australia, and in South
America. Quite a number of young have been reared at Cleres in
1952 and 1953, among which are Rheas, Spicifer, and other Pea-
fowl ; Siamese Firebacks, Mikado, Edwards', Swinhoe's, Horsfield's,
Cheer, Bel's, Blue and Brown Eared Pheasants, Red and Sonnerat's
Junglefowl ; Blue and Greater Snow, Cereopsis, Magellan, Ashy-
headed, Blue-winged, Egyptian, and Orinoco Geese ; South African
and Common Sheld-Ducks ; wild Muscovies ; Mandarin and Carolinas;
American and Chiloe Wigeons ; Shovelers, Pintails, Bahamas (includ-
ing a white one), Gadwall, Cinnamon and Chilean Teal, American
Black Ducks, Red-crested Pochards, Red-heads, etc. ; Wonga-
wonga Pigeons, Green-winged, Bronze-winged, Senegal, Peruvian
Ground, Bar-shouldered, Diamond Doves ; many Fischer s and some
Masked Lovebirds, and a large number of pied and other Budgerigars.
An imported pair of Black-necked Swans, after four years, nested
in August, but failed to rear the two cygnets hatched.
Considering the difficulties of the present time, the comparatively
small staff, and the disturbance caused by tens of thousands of visitors,
such results are quite satisfactory.

By Ir. F. J. Appelman (Rotterdam, Holland)
The hen of the pair that lives in one of the aviaries in the big Hothouse
at the Rotterdam Zoo " Blijdorp " (see Avicultural Magazine,
Vol. 59, No. 5--September-October, 1953), laid six eggs in a small
hole under some stones, four of which were fertile.
A small bantam foster-mother spoiled two eggs, but of the other
two which were brooded in the incubator, one chick was hatched,
which afterwards proved to be a cock.
From the beginning the little fellow was very vigorous and bullied
a much bigger bantam-chick that was given him as a companion. He
was fed in the same way as newly hatched pheasants and thrived.
He has become a very beautiful proud young cock, with a fine red
crest on his little head.

birds, but from notes made from the books when I was in Nigeria,
the description did not tally with my own observations of birds which
were found between Kaduna and Jos.
The description (it may not have been Bannerman) was that the
entire top of the head, back, and wings were black, while the birds
I saw had a red patch on the forehead and a thin bar of red on the
secondaries. These markings are, however, only supposed to apply
to the Saw-toothed Barbet. The latter lacks the amazing bristles
which decorate the base of the bill of the Bearded so that it would be
difficult to make an error in identification.
The impression of the bird in flight is red and black, very noticeable
against the green foliage of the trees, though occasionally they may
be seen making a brief visit to the ground. They do not seem to flock
and are normally seen in pairs or singly. From my hut I could some-
times see as many as half a dozen pairs, though they became scarce
directly the particular fruit on which they had been feeding ceased
to be available in fair quantities. I managed to obtain several young
from the nest and found them easy to rear on bread and milk and
Mellins Food mixed with an equal measure of mashed banana. As
soon as the feathers commenced to sprout a few termites were added
to their hourly feed, these were increased as the birds grew and the
bread was proportionately lessened. It was noticeable that as soon
as the termite ration was for any reason lessened, the young birds
showed signs of decline. Several old birds which I kept invariably
swallowed whatever was fed them without making any attempt
first to break it up, regardless of the size of the piece. Their con-
tortions in swallowing any outsize fruit was strangely reminiscent of
Charlie Chaplin swallowing a piece of dry bread or something he
did not much fancy. I frequently saw these birds searching the flowers
of the cotton trees though whether for insects or nectar could not be
determined. The crops of some birds contained a large proportion
of insects and included large beetles from which the wing cases had
not been detached. Judging by the size of these insects it would appear
that they had been taken deliberately.
The size and power of these birds' beaks is out of all proportion
to the use to which they could be put and I can assign no particular
use to the outsize bristles in spite of spending hours with both binoculars
and telescope watching them feeding. The sketch is from a live
bird which I had for some time and which I had to release as no
livestock was allowed on the plane.

By Gust. A. Gjessing (Drammen, Norway)
Everyone I talk to is surprised when they hear that I keep a fairly
large collection of birds, mainly Australian Parrakeets, in outside flights
in Norway, which, most people appear to think is the border to the
North Pole ! But, as many English aviculturists who have read Cage Birds
through the years know, I have now worked at the hobby in Norway
since 1934, and have had fairly good results. What losses I have had,
have never been because of the weather, but mostly have been caused
by my own inexperience and lack of knowledge as to what to do in
time of trouble. I have remedied this by bothering eminent avi-
culturists the world over with a lot of questions. I know to-day a lot
more than I knew, and have this year built new quarters for my
birds, and this is what I intend to tell my colleagues in the Avicultural
Society about.
The war put a stop to my bird-keeping for a while. I experienced
a lot of changes and ended up by buying the new property " Wood-
berry Hill " here in Drammen. As soon as I had moved I set about
planning a new aviary, and last October began to write to all the
aviculturists I knew in England, Australia, Germany, and U.S.A.,
in order to obtain suggestions and experiences from them, so that I
could get my new aviary as near the ideal as possible. I built a
structure 10 metres long and 3 metres wide from two layers of wood
panelling boards, and insulated with glass-wool, which was encased
in tarred paper. I used glass-wool because it is 100 per cent vermin
proof. Plenty of windows in the front of the house, and flights facing
south, the back wall facing north, and the whole very nicely located
inside small woods, which are a good protection against the weather.
The entrance holes to the flights I placed down by the ground---
against the advice of many aviculturists, but knowing that warm
air goes up and cold air stays down, I figured that the further down
the holes were the more warm air I would conserve in winter. I will
admit that it took a long time to train the birds to use these entrances
regularly, but I succeeded, and now they all do so without any trouble.
The flights were built in compartments, each compartment to accom-
modate one breeding pair of parrakeets.
In the middle of the #&lt; battery " of compartments, I built a large
one intended to hold possible young birds. The house, as I have stated,
was 10 metres long. At the end of this house I built a large open
flight without a connecting inside flight, 7 yards by 1.1 yards, where
this summer I have had a pair of Roseate Cockatoos. The inside
flights are 1.1 yard by 1.7 yard, and all compartments, inside and
outside, are about 3 yards high. For netting I have used the strongest

one can buy in half-inch mesh. All compartment walls are double
to avoid biting of feet and beaks through the netting. Outside netting
walls are double to keep out cats and other animals, only the front
is single to allow a good view.
The aviary is so placed that I can see it from all the important
windows in the main house. I use fluorescent lighting, two lamps each
of 40 watts. This can be turned on and off from the main house.
Around the bird aviary I have planted many hundreds of beautiful
and strange mosses and other plants, collected in the woods of Norway
and moved into my place. I wanted the whole thing to be original
and beautiful, and have so far been more than lucky. From the road
there is a special entrance into the rockery where the aviary is located.
This has been planted with nice small junipers so as to look like
cypresses. Between the junipers I have nice young heather, and
between the heather lots and lots of field flowers, the names of which
I do not know in English. There are bluebells, red, white, yellow,
and lilac flowers and some dwarf ferns. A basin I have made in front
of the aviaries out of granite blocks, surrounded by nature-stonework,
is also planted with strange rare mosses which bloom crimson, white,
yellow, and blue. Surrounding the basin are the only cultivated
plants in the whole garden, some Kamus lilies, tall ferns, and flowers
in various colours, spirea and water-swordgrasses. In midsummer
the whole thing looks like a colourful painting. I must here admit--I
have not done this by myself, a friend, artist and sculptor, planned the
whole thing, and we have done the work together. I did not want
to employ strangers to do it, because the real art would then not be
the same as when you do it with your own hands. A lot of love for
God's nature lies in this arrangement.
Above the aviaries I have built a large stone terrace from loose
stones and planted colourful flowers among the stones. The top of
the terrace, which is about 25 yards square, is a lawn. In the corner,
right up against the house, I have planted an aviary, made from
rustic birch, with colourful berberis bushes. There the Australian
finches belonging to my wife will go in summer. This aviary is
3 ! by 3I yards and 3 yards high. There is a window into the
cellar (my cellar lies above ground), and inside in the cellar I have
partitioned off and made a bird-room where I have two flights.
One is connected with the finch aviary, 2 \ by 2J yards by 2^ yards
high, and the other somewhat smaller is intended to house a pair
of Ara sever a during winter. In the summer I will keep it for
eventualities.
In this bird-room I have my feed, a work-bench, shelves with my
mealworm boxes, and a battery of cages of the type in England
called " Budgie breeding-cages ". I use them for quarantine for new
arrivals and possible young ones, should I get more than I can

accommodate in other places. It is always good to have some reserve
place.
With the kind help of many of our members in the Avicultural
Society, and with special thanks to the Hon. Secretary, Mr. Prestwich,
for his helpful assistance, I have been able to buy quite a collection
this year. Most birds came from England, some from Denmark,
and one pair from Australia. I now have the following species housed
in my aviary :--
2/3 Rosella, 1/2 Stanley, 1/1 Princess of Wales, 5/3 Bourkes,
1/1 Roseate Cockatoo, 1/1 Ara sever a, 1/1 Rock Peplar, 10/10
Budgies (all unusual types), and twenty different finches, Red Cardinals
(with three young in the nest at present), orange Canaries, white and
grey Java Sparrows, Bengalese, Cordon Bleu, Grass Finches, Zebras.
These include this year's young.
I did not get the aviary finished before the middle of May, 1953. The
birds were practically all young ones from the previous season (1952),
but still I had the fortune of breeding eight young Bourkes, one young
Rosella, and a number of Zebras and Budgerigers. I have three
young Virginian Cardinals in the nest, and am trying to bring them
up on mealworms and egg food mixed with raw meat. I have little
hope, but will try anyhow. It is too late in the season. Had this
occurred in the summer, I would have let the grown birds out to catch
insects, they do not leave home when they have young ones ; I have
tried this once before with success.
I am very anxious to see how the whole collection comes through the
severe winter in the high altitude of Konnerud ; I live at 300 metres
above sea level, the air is thin and clear and dry. The birds seem to
thrive on the climate so far, and they have come into as good a condition
as can be expected.
I imagine space in the Magazine is limited, so will let this be enough.
At some later date I will relate something about the other bird-people
we have here ; they are few, but there are some that are very interested.

By C. af Enehjelm (Helsingfors, Finland)
The Black-crested Finch --Lophospingus pusillus --from the interior
of Argentine, was, as far as I know, first imported into Europe about
twenty years ago. In a consignment of South American birds I got
four birds, apparently two pairs, of a species new to me, and the
name was not known by the Dutch importer. I sent a description to
Mr. Karl Neunzig in Berlin, who gave me their name and particulars.
At that time I had no further results with them, and gave them to a
friend, who is specially interested in South American birds.
On a trip to the Continent in 1950 I was happy again to secure
five birds, two cocks and three hens. In an indoor-flight in my bird-
room in my house the birds behaved quite peaceably all the winter.
I should mention that one pair of the birds was obtained from a
private aviculturist, who had kept them in his somewhat roomy
birdhouse with an adjoining outside flight, in the company of various
small birds--Weaverfinches mainly--but parted with them because
they were rather aggressive towards other birds. The other three
birds were freshly imported.
In the spring of 1951 I put the first-named pair in an outdoor
flight with an adjoining closed-in room in the company of various
small finches and weavers, about ten pairs in all. The flight was
approximately 20 by 7 by 7 feet, the indoor compartment about
7 by 7 by 7 feet. I had no opportunity to follow the birds very closely,
but never observed that they were aggressive to other inmates. In
July I observed an open nest, cup-shaped and very deep, made of
coconut-fibres and lined with white dog hair. The nest was built
in a Harzer wicker cage and contained three eggs. As a pair of Canaries
also shared the flight I first thought that the nest belonged to those
birds, but later on observed that the Crested Finches visited the nest.
Two youngsters were duly hatched and reared. They left the nest when
about fourteen days old, but were fed by the cock for a long time, I think
about a month. The hen eventually settled down for another clutch
of three eggs from which two youngsters were hatched and left the
nest in due course. As far as I could see nothing but fresh ants' eggs
were used for feeding. I had a lot also frozen for later use, but when
the fresh ants' eggs, through some disturbance in the freezing-room,
were spoilt the fate of my four young Lophospingus was sealed, and
they all died, still apparently being dependent on this food.
In 1952 no attempts at breeding were made, and the old cock
died. In the spring, 1953, I got a new cock and mated him to
the old hen. As I was anxious to make some closer observations

I put the pair in a flight in the bird-room in the house situated close
to my office, so I had time to look at the birds at frequent intervals.
The flight is approximately 8 by 6 feet and about 7J feet high. The
room also contained five or six pairs of other small birds, Red-headed
Parrot Finches, Zebra Finches, Cherry Finches, Cordon Bleus,
Avadavats, Green Avadavats, and Bichenow Finches. As nests,
Harzer wicker cages and small plywood boxes 5 by 5 by 5 inches, with
half-open fronts were used. There were not very many branches,
but they were sufficient. There was a big window facing south and a
smaller one facing east. All feeding receptacles, open shallow glass
feeders, were placed on a zinc plate on the floor, with the bathing
facilities as well.
The Lophospingus settled down quite quickly and started nest-
building in a Harzer cage. The nest was again mainly built of coconut-
fibres and lined with white hair from a wire-haired terrier (a very
good and highly treasured lining material easily obtained from every
dog trimmer). I am sorry I cannot give the exact date of the first egg,
two only were laid. One youngster was hatched on 4th May and
left the nest on 18th May, two weeks old. The youngster was not able
to fly up, but sat in a corner most of the time on the first day and
was regularly fed by the cock. Already on 20th May I observed the
youngster in one of the feeders, but am not quite sure if it took any
seed. Already the next day, 21st, the youngster sat on a rather high
branch, and on the following day, 22nd, it flew very well. Two days
later some bird, I did not know which, started to pluck the youngster
badly on the breast. Later on I observed it was the cock. This plucking
grew so bad that I had to separate the young on 1st June, by which
time it seemed quite able to fend for himself. I put him alone in a
box cage 30 by 14 by 18 inches, in which he soon regained his plumage.
He was feeding mainly on fresh ants' eggs and milksop, which also
had been used by the parents for feeding, also some sprouted seed,
millet and canary, and possibly some egg food was taken. Lots of
chickweed had been at the birds' disposal all the time, and probably
also used for feeding the youngsters. As far as I could observe the
young one was fed mainly by the hen for the first week, after which
time the cock also took part in the feeding. After leaving the nest
the youngster was fed only by the cock and ignored by the hen,
except that she also plucked it. As to the colour of the young bird,
this was rather similar to the hen, only with some irregular, not
very defined stripes down the breast. The crest was already clearly
visible before it left the nest. On the 29th July the youngster seemed
ill and died on the same day, as far as I could see, from enteritis.
Further mating was observed on 26th May and two eggs were
laid on 31st May and 1st June, but the hen refused to sit. Nest-building
was started again in the same Harzer cage and a new nest placed at

the side of the earlier one. On 25th June again two eggs were observed
and two young hatched on 5th and 6th July. One of these died on
12th July and the other left the nest on 17th July. This youngster
was not plucked, but had to be transferred to an adjoining flight on
8th August. This young bird--probably a hen--is still living at the
time of writing (22nd November), and is exactly like the old hen.
On 19th July a fourth clutch of two eggs was observed and two
youngsters hatched about 31st July, but died on 5th and 7th August.
The pair had usually behaved quite peaceably, but sometimes the
cock started to chase some bird--usually a Zebra Finch up and down
the flight. At length I had to transfer the Zebra Finches, as I wished
to observe the Lophospingus and would not disturb them. After the
fourth unsuccessful clutch the cock apparently thought it would be
better to have the room for himself and his wife, so he started in a
typical Cardinal-manner to chase now one bird, now another. As
the victims happened to be Red-headed Parrot Finches, Plum-headed
Finches, and Bichenows, which all had young I decided to catch the
pair and put them alone in a smaller compartment about 6 by 3 feet,
but of the same height as the previous one. This flight they shared only
with a pair of Painted Quail, in which they took no interest. In this
compartment they started to build a new nest in a Harzer cage and on
15th August two eggs were in the nest. Two youngsters hatched on
27th and 28th August, one of which died on 7th September, the other
leaving the nest on 9th September, apparently a bit too early. On
the same date the nest was transferred. As I had to go abroad on the
same day, my wife took over the care of that special pair and reported
to me that the young was plucked for a couple of days, but that
the plucking then stopped. Apparently the lack of opportunity for
further nest-building was the reason. On my return home on 26th
October all three birds were in good condition, but a fortnight later
the cock started to pluck and chase the young one, so I transferred
it to the adjoining larger compartment already mentioned. The young
bird had been damaged by the plucking of some of the primaries,
so that he could not fly very well and used to climb up the netting
to a branch. On these occasions the cock furiously attacked the young
one through the wires and still plucked its breast. I had now to
transfer it to the cage already mentioned, where it seemed to settle
down quite satisfactorily and the feathers were soon in order.
I now wonder whether the reason for plucking is that the parents
wish to nest again or that the cock feels that the young one is possibly
a cock. As stated earlier the other young one, now about five months
old, has not shown any signs of changing plumage, so it is probably
a hen. I should of course be very interested to have a young cock,
as there are, as far as I know, no data about the time the cocks moulting
out to adult plumage. I should also mention that it is certainly not

my custom to take five clutches in succession from one pair as a
general rule, but I was interested to see how many clutches this some-
what rare species would lay and I also was anxious to obtain more
youngsters in order to observe their development.
The description of the egg is as follows : slightly pointed, greenish-
grey, marked with streaks and spots of two darker shades, more
pronounced towards the larger end. Size 19-20 by 15 mm.
As stated earlier, the bird was first imported alive to Europe about
twenty years ago, again after the last war in 1949 * n larger numbers
and probably from time to time since then, as it is sometimes advertised
in the fancy press.
As far as I know the Black-crested Finch was first bred by the late
Dr. Maurice Amsler in 1939 and later by Mr. Allen Silver, and in
1949 and 1951 in Switzerland by Professor Hans Steiner, who gives
a very interesting account of the breeding in Vol. 8 of Die Gefiederte
Welt , 1953. I do not think it is an easy bird to rear, it is just the same
thing as with many other species, that you must be lucky even to get a
pair which wishes to breed. For instance, my other cock has been
paired with both my other hens under exactly the same conditions,
but they have never made any attempts to breed. This shows the
wisdom of always getting several specimens of a species you are
anxious to breed.
The species was first discovered by Burmeister on his expedition to
the La Plata States in 1856, and later, in 1863, described in Journal
fur Ornithologie as Gubernatrix pusilla. In the Checklist, Vol. 12, Dr. R.
Bowdler Sharpe describes the bird as Lophospingus pusillus but says
that the female is similar to the male. This, however, is wrong.
The sexes of adult birds are easily distinguished. The cock has a black
throat spot which is lacking in the female, and the stripes are more
clearly defined in the cock, also the breast colour is a trifle deeper. In
his large book, Die fremdlandischen Stubenvogel , Part I, 1879, Dr. Karl
Russ describes the bird as a Lesser Green Cardinal. In spite of the
fact that there is no green colour in the Lophospingus , there is a certain
resemblance between the two species, especially the female of the Green
Cardinal. There is, however, a very remarkable difference in size,
the L. pusillus being only 4.8 inches long and the Green Cardinal
7.5 inches.
Further notes written on 3rd January , 1954.
On 1 st December I noted the older chick--born on 5th July
warbling with a very loud voice, and in a few days it was singing
loudly as the old cock. The chick started serious battles through the
wire-netting with his father in the adjoining flight, both plucking each
other on the breast. I had to transfer the bird to a box cage. At the
same time I observed a grey spot on the throat, growing each day, so

that a month later the bird had a patch almost as big as that of the old
cock. At the same time the grey stripes on the sides of the head have
grown darker, and are now almost black. Contrary to my earlier
belief, this bird is a cock, the moulting out into adult plumage seems
to start when the bird is about five months old and will be finished in
about six weeks.

By David M. Johnson (Port Orchard, Washington State, U.S.A.)
It is now a year since I made a report to the Avicultural Society on
facts observed in the breeding of my birds for the season. Fourteen
husky youngsters still survive in their juvenile plumage.
I will first, however, describe the eclipse in the hybrid cock which
took place in June, 1953 ; it would seem that the hybrid changes
more towards sonnerati with age. This cock lost his hackles,
and they have been replaced with short, rounded, flat black feathers.
The shoulders, formerly maroon red, are now showing the waxy webbed
character of sonnerati , but the shanks are still pink. Strangest of
all, one wattle has receded completely, while the opposite one has
moved towards the centre of the throat. This is most interesting.
It would not surprise me, if when this cock blooms again, perhaps in
August, the spotted hackles returned.
I have raised a few second-generation hybrids this season, only to
prove conclusively that the hybrid is fertile. Having to use a sister
hen and not having any fresh blood of a non-related stock, I have not
been anxious to breed from them. The eggs, though of the highest
fertility, did not hatch well.
The chicks were unable to break through the shell, and were at first
tiny and delicate. They were, however, strong enough after a week.
I have had reports from other States of poor hatches from pure
sonnerati , which causes me to wonder if lack of new blood is not a
strong factor in this case.
Now for the report of what I am pleased to call " Gallus johnsoni."
These are the super birds derived from a three-quarter sonnerati cock
and a Cornish bantam hen. The pencilling is dark, the eggs were 100
per cent fertile, and all the chicks hatched out and lived. These chicks
were robust from the egg, docile and tractable yet with a certain
reserve, and with a hearty dislike of being touched or handled.
They were suspicious of danger and ever alert. The blend of these
two species is indeed harmonious. Half-grown pullets show many
of the attributes of sonnerati , including whitish breasts and throats,
tails carried low, as in both species, wings proportionately larger than
in the Cornish bantam, but with bones somewhat larger than in

the sonnerati. The length of leg gives a graceful carriage, and the
body is round and compact. The juvenile plumage resembles certain
grouse of the same age ; the feathering of all is perfectly uniform, the
heads are round, and there is no visible comb or wattle. None of the
females of any of these hybrids has the facial skin. The colour is rather
brown with the exception that just before a hen is laying there may be
a slight rosy tint at the tip of her very small pea comb.
At present the juvenile plumage of birds of the year is not like either
of the species from which they are derived ; it is rather distinctly its
own yet withal a pleasant blend of both. In some future issue of the
Avicultural Magazine I may be able to give a description of the
adult plumage of these birds. The cockerels have yellow legs and the
pullets green.
When considering the general characteristics of these birds it may
be of interest to mention that they are quite playful, but in sham
battles do not seem to hurt one another at all, and they are, in rapidity
of movement, not to be compared with the comparatively slow-moving
domestic fowl.
The three-quarter sonnerati cock would give one the impression,
in the early morning especially, that he had turned vicious, as he
delights in scaring the pullets of the year, frightening them until they
seek cover, when he promptly finds them and affectionately tugs their
neck and breast feathers, indicating that no harm is intended.
Our worst predators here are racoons which have become quite
bold, and the so-called civets or little spotted skunks, which steal eggs
and sometimes chicks, so that everything must be kept under wire.

By A. H. Isenberg (Woodside, California, U.S.A.)
On our first trip by motor to Mexico in 1945 I saw for the first time
live Ptilogonys at about 8,000 feet elevation between Mexico City
and Taxco. It was a wonderful sight to see these lovely, graceful
birds in their native habitat. There were about seven of them, and
they were feeding on some sort of berries on a tree with reddish bark,
not unlike our Madrone trees in California. Their pleasant call notes
were constantly uttered as they flew from the food tree to another,
back and forth. The time of year was April, so that the country was
extremely dry.
Upon arrival at Taxco my wife and I were wandering about the
fascinating old streets when we passed a seamstress shop, and there, to
my great joy, was a fine pair of Ptilogonys in a very small cage.
No amount of persuasion and begging on my part would persuade

the lady who owned the birds to part with them, even though 1
offered her ioo pesos (about $8.00). I was so excited and so dis-
appointed. We thanked the lady for letting us see her birds, and
asked where we might get some, and she said in the Mercados of
Mexico City. It was many days until I could test the lady's advice,
as we were on our way to Acapulco.
To make a long story short, I did finally manage to collect seven
Ptilogonys among other nice Mexican birds. The back of our car
was loaded with cages and birds on our home stretch. Two Ptilo-
gonys died on the way, leaving five upon arriving home. After a
week or more rest in a large cage in the " Loochoo Robin " aviary,
the Ptilogonys were released into the aviary.
The next year saw one pair carrying nesting material, but the
only result that year was that the male of the mated pair killed the
odd male, and eventually in 1947 I had only three left, a male and
two females. This was the year of my first near success, as I reported
in my article on the hybrid Clarin-Jilgearo, when one Ptilogony was
reared to the flying stage, but it died in the nest. No further attempt
to nest was made until this year, which is a peculiar thing.
In April, 1952, my wife and I again were on our way home from
Mexico, this time with another seven Ptilogonys and other birds.
Three of these were given to friends, and I kept two pairs which were
released in due course with my old pair. Ptilogonys evidently are
gregarious in nesting habits, as this year all three pairs had nests
and hatched young, but only one pair was successful in rearing one
young. As I write (8th August) the young bird is quite on its own, is
mostly grey, and does not show any yellow on its under tail-coverts.
Ptilogonys are rather late nesters, June being the month nest building
starts, and the nest is constructed mainly of Spanish moss plus rootlets
and grasses and some hair and string, but without the Spanish moss
I don't think they would nest. Two to three eggs are laid (eggs are
bluish-grey, heavily peppered and speckled with dark brown) in the
open cup-shaped nest. The nesting sites varied in my case. One
pair built in a branch of Ceonotus (California wild lilac bush) about
seven feet up and right next to the aviary netting in full sun ; this
later proved the death of the young from sunstroke. Another pair
nested about nine feet up in a thick and well shaded trumpet vine ;
this young one simply disappeared. The third, and successful pair,
nested in a fork of a top branch of a long-needled pine tree about
nine feet up. This last nest was partially shaded. Two young hatched
here after approximately 14 days of incubation, the male took his
turn, and when not incubating would guard the nest quite well.
Territories were set up by each male, and not too belligerently
enforced, but I did feed them in four or five different places.
Ptilogonys, like Phainopeplas, feed their young on berries very soon

after hatching. I only gave mealworms two or three times a day, the
parents hawked quite a few insects, but fed the young mostly on
canned blueberries from which the syrup had been washed ; fresh
blueberries were also cherished when available, also soaked currants,
Philadelphia cream cheese also was taken. The giving of mealworms
presented a problem in such a mixed aviary. A pair of Indian Brown
Robins were particularly annoying, both in stealing the worms and
chasing the Ptilogonys away. The Robins built three nests in three
different nest-boxes, laid three eggs each time, but did not hatch any.
An Aztec Thrush was also a nuisance, but by quickly placing a few
worms in different places the Ptilogonys got enough. Ptilogonys are
not aggressive, and almost any smaller bird can frighten them off,
such as a Scarlet Tanager, the Robins, etc. Fresh figs are greatly
cherished by Ptilogonys, and, of course, elderberries. Apples and
bananas, hard boiled egg, and my Pablum mixture are also taken.
In our climate Ptilogonys are quite hardy, and seldom use the
shelter, even in rain and stormy weather. One year the temperature
got down to 11* F. but the days were sunny ; such extreme temperature
change, however, is fortunately rare here, 30-32* being the usual
extremes in winter, and not often.
Other near successes were : Grey-winged Blackbirds, one young out
of nest, but injured in its first flight, and later died at about three
weeks old ; one young Red-vented Bulbul almost reared, but died of
sunstroke during a very hot spell (these birds now have another
young about twelve days old) ; Blue-winged Sivas had young ; also
Silver-eared Mesias, Shamas, White Eyes, and Satin Bower Birds
had one egg ; also Spectacle Thrushes and Indian Rock Thrushes.
I just do not have enough aviaries for breeding. Next year I plan to
have a series of breeding aviaries where one pair of birds can be by
themselves.
Now (nth September) the one young Ptilogony is doing very well,

By Kenneth Smith (Paignton, Devon, England)
The avian collection at Paignton Zoo has been increased consider-
ably during the past few years, particularly in 1953. It is still small,
however, if compared with the exceedingly rich and representative
collection maintained here by Mr. Whitley before the last war.
There are no comprehensive family exhibits here now, such as that of
the Birds of Paradise of bygone days. We have, nevertheless, many
interesting specimens, and we aim to increase the avicultural side
of the Zoo as far as circumstances will allow.
New arrivals are accommodated alongside old inhabitants. These
older birds are living reminders of former days when the Primley
collection could vie with any other avicultural establishment in the
world--of days, indeed, when in many respects it could not be excelled !
A pair of Great Condors have been at the Zoo for about twenty
years. At the end of last January and in early February mating
was observed, and on 26th February an egg was laid. The birds
were most attentive, seeming to share incubation duties fairly, and
my hopes were high. Maximum privacy had been ensured by fencing
off the whole range of birds of prey cages from the public, and only
the keepers directly concerned with the Condors' welfare were allowed
in the area. But, alas ! these precautions were of no avail, for on
3rd April the egg had gone ; taking into account the full circum-
stances I was forced to the conclusion that it had been destroyed,
most likely by the male. The day was Good Friday, and the noise
of the first holiday crowds, although not close, was disturbing.
Mr. Whitley told me that these Condors had succeeded in hatching
a chick some years previously, and all went well for a while ; then
the cock killed the youngster--though not intentionally--when he was
upset by visitors.
Caged next to the Condors is a pair of Chilean Sea Eagles, and on
the other side are three Brazilian Caracaras. There is also a very
tame Hooded Vulture, one of a number I brought from West Africa
in 1951. Probably the most unusual exhibit among our raptorial
birds is a Swainson's Buzzard (Buteo swainsoni ), sent to us last winter
by Mr. Tom Baines, of Calgary Zoo. I know of no record of this
species being shown in Britain before. It is a choice feeder, and it is
stated that in the wild state it subsists largely on gophers ; our bird
takes freshly killed mice, young rats, and rabbit flesh.
Four fine American Eagle-Owls, also received from the Calgary
Zoo, are shown next to the British Little Owl, forming an amusing
contrast in size. A pair of Barn Owls reared a chick this summer, and

in the previous season two young were raised by the same pair of
birds.
The natural beauty of the Zoo, enhanced by subtropical trees and
shrubs, provides an ideal setting for Cranes. They do well in spacious
grass enclosures, where palms, bamboos, and other trees and plants
ornament the scene and offer shade and shelter. A mixed group
of Sarus and Demoiselle share the largest enclosure ; other Cranes
shown are Grey-necked Crowned, Japanese White-necked, and
Stanley. Geese, too, roam the enclosures, our stock including Cape
Barren, Egyptian, Canadian, and Abyssinian Blue-winged.
In January, 1953, we imported Black-necked Storks from India.
They are handsome dandyish creatures, much more elegant than the
Jabiru (the Jabiru I knew in the small Zoo attached to the old George-
town Museum was very dignified, but hardly elegant !), and in the
sunlight their darker plumage appears almost glossy. Black-necked
Storks, I think, need a good deal of care in an English winter, even
here in Devonshire. For extra protection against draughts and extreme
cold we have built straw-padded fencing around their winter sleeping
quarters. A notable eye difference, presumably of sex, occurs in these
Storks ; the larger bird, which I believe is the male, has an all-black
eye, while the smaller bird, presumed female, has a yellow iris and
black pupil.
Other large birds of note are Adjutant Storks, White Pelicans,
Black-footed or Jackass Penguins, and an Emu. In the aviaries
opposite the Storks' compound is a Spoonbill, which was found with an
injured wing near Teignmouth. I may say that during the past two
years I have had several reliable reports of Spoonbills observed in this
district, sometimes of twelve to fifteen birds flying together. One
of our keepers was fortunate enough to see a Spoonbill from the train
window when travelling along the coastal railway between Paignton
and Teignmouth.
The Sacred Ibis, Cattle Egret, and Vulturine Guineafowl are
other interesting species represented. The Cattle Egrets came from
the collection I made in the Sierra Leone Protectorate. In summer
they strut through the long grass in the aviary, arching and stretching
their necks as they search for insects, just as they did back in Africa.
The Vulturine Guineafowl were brought from Kenya by Messrs.
J. Seago and R. Bloom in November, 1952. They are now fully
acclimatized. At times they cavort around the aviary in quite a mad
manner, expressing it seems just the sheer joy of living ; their concerted
calls of excitement can be heard a long way off.
Oiled and injured sea birds are often brought to the Zoo for atten-
tion, some of them, of course, quite beyond recovery. We do what
we can to save them, but it is an exacting business if the injuries are
serious. Three Manx Shearwaters, which were washed ashore at

Bude and offered to London Zoo, were sent here recently on the advice
of Mr. John Yealland. We supplemented the fish diet with halibut
liver oil capsules. On moonlight nights I watched their shuffling
and scrambling gait, and now and again heard their wild penetrating
call.
The largest aviary in the Zoo, the Cottage Aviary, 50 feet by
44 feet, contains seed-eating birds. It gives splendid opportunity
for flight, while bushes and plant life provide a naturalistic touch.
Silverbills, Zebra Finches, Rose Finches, Bengalese, Red-headed
Buntings, Avadavats, Java Sparrows, and Canaries, as well as native
species, nest freely. In spring and summer the floral effect is delightful
and the activity among the birds causes great interest among visitors.
In adjoining aviaries are four kinds of Myna : Black-headed, Grey-
headed, Bank, and Pied.
The Parrot House collection is under the supervision of Miss Gladys
Salter. Macaws are well represented and include Spix's, Illiger's,
Severe, and Hahn's ; Conures include Blue-crowned and Golden-
crowned ; Parrots include Salvin's, Red-throated, and Maximilian's ;
and among the Parrakeets is the Green-winged King. Rarest bird
in the Parrot House is the beautiful Blue-eyed Cockatoo (Kakatoe
ophthalmica ), the survivor of a pair specially secured in New Britain
for Mr. Whitley by Mr. Shaw-Mayer. Elsewhere in the Zoo there
are Ring-necked Parrakeets which bred during 1953. A pair of richly-
hued hybrid Parrakeets (Barnard's X Rosella), which came from
Mrs. G. T. Clark's aviaries at Bromsgrove last May, is kept in the
Pheasantries. Here, too, are Indian Gallinules, also a fine Hunting
Crow, or Hunting Magpie, (Cissa chinensis ), a gift from Mr. A. A.
Prestwich.
Wild birds find the Zoo a virtual sanctuary. Buzzards soar or fly in
languid fashion overhead, often several in view together. Teal, Shoveler,
Pochard, Wigeon, and Mallard come to the lakes to join our water-
fowl (Carolinas, Bahama Ducks, Pintail, and Sheld-Ducks, in addition
to Mallard and some hybrids). Herons drop down to fish the shallows
of the lakes, Moorhens abound, and Water Rails skulk in the reed-
beds. Woodpeckers, Magpies, and Jays are common, and Gold-
crests flit unobtrusively through copses and plantations.
It is probably correct to say that there are more Peafowl at Primley
than anywhere else in Europe. Like the wild birds they enjoy complete
freedom here, roaming as they wish through the Zoo grounds and over
Mr. Whitley's private estates. They are left entirely to themselves at
nesting time and bring up their own young, no attempt being made
at hand-rearing. In springtime it sometimes seems as if one meets a
Peacock in display at every turn, each bird attracting a circle of
admiring visitors. The Peafowl roost in groups, and I often count
twenty to thirty birds in a single tree. The report of a gun or the

careless banging of a door in the still of a summer night often starts
them calling ; the raucous cries come from all directions, from every
roosting place it seems,some quite distant. It is a remarkable experience
to stand alone in the darkness in the centre of the Zoo, listening to the
tremendous volume of sound coming from the near-by trees and from
the wooded slopes beyond.
I have not, of course, mentioned all the birds in our collection.
To do so would have given this article a catalogue complexion even
more than it bears now. I have attempted to avoid this as far as
possible, and I hope I have not fallen too far short of that aim. In
conclusion, I would like to acknowledge the enthusiasm and meticulous
care shown by Mr. R. Travers, and by Major D. Willis-Fleming,
members of the staff; they are responsible, day by day, for the
welfare of the birds.

By Dr. George A. Allen (Salt Lake City, Utah, U.S.A.)
As the civilization of a country becomes more mature its inhabitants
seem increasingly to recognize the importance that bird life plays in
the economy of their land. This is evidently more true of older lands
where the need for conservation is so great. Farmer and urban dweller
alike recognize that abundant bird life means fewer insect pests and
consequently better crops. Too, they appreciate more fully the
esthetic value of birds, and take steps to ensure preservation and
propagation. There is apparently a direct relationship between the
knowledge and care of bird life, and the degree of culture in a nation.
When the older civilizations were at their peak, protective laws
were often enforced by the death penalty. Some birds, such as the
rare and beautiful varieties of pheasants, could be owned and held
captive only by royalty, and were therefore named the " Royal
Birds ". Feathers from those of rare beauty were only for the plumes
of the ruling class, and a violation of this law meant the most severe
punishment.
Evidence of esteem and admiration of avian life is to be found in
our museums, where the designs show birds woven into the most
delicate and costly fabrics. These, together with the rare paintings
which once could be possessed only by the wealthy, now come down
to us through the centuries as proof of the high appraisement these
feathered aristocrats enjoyed in those elegant days.
But nowadays in Europe birds are taken for granted as almost a
necessary part of most households. The city dweller with his small
backyard plot keeps some ducks, bantams, or pheasants for the
aesthetic value and animation which they lend to the oft-times drab

surroundings ... as well as for a possible treat for his Sunday appetite.
The home's interior is cheered by the presence of a multi-coloured
pet, or the voice of a captive songster. As the standard of living goes
up, the individual naturally has a wider selection of birds to choose
from. Those whose pocket books permit purchase the rare and exotic
types. However, those of less affluence equally share the desire for
better birds, and sometimes acquire them at the sacrifice of more
essential items. Though we human beings are often divided into
economic classes, there is little or no distinction between the artistic
judgments of bird lovers. The visual pleasure of an ornamental bird
reacts about the same on all human retinas, the world over.
In some oriental countries the birds are for sale in cages
of exquisite workmanship. American tourists delight in finding the
Mediterranean market places virtually alive with gay finches, warblers,
and canaries.
When Europeans settled the North American continent, wild life
was richly abundant. But the basic problem of survival demanded
people's full attention. Not until after the twentieth century began
did we realize the tragic rate at which we had dissipated our wildlife
resources, or the urgent necessity of restrictive controls. The years
1900 through 1920, witnessed the extinction and near extinction of
several species of American birds. It was then, by the heroic efforts
on the part of enlightened citizens, that protective legislation was
passed to stem this growing calamity. The nation and the forty-eight
component states are all now fully cognizant of the need for stringent
protection, and are banded together in a great restorative movement.
The Federal Wildlife Agency protects the migratory birds. The
game commission of each state protects its upland game inhabitants.
These, together with the Audubon Society, the American Pheasant
Society, and numerous other groups, have created a public conscious-
ness of our feathered friends' place in our daily living. The few
ripples started by the breeze of protest against waste has by now
developed into a considerable wave of constructive action whose
crest rises higher year by year.
This surge of interest has now attained very noticeable proportions.
It is no longer considered a pastime for the effeminate. Lectures and
pictures on this subject are filling our auditoriums. Bookstores every-
where have new departments for ornithological literature. Even the
layman often buys the excellent new books of whose scholarly content
and artistic appeal America may be proud.
An interesting example is the magazine with which your author is
connected, the Pheasant Fancier's , Game Breeder's , and Aviculturist's
Gazette. We began a little over a year ago with a mere bulletin ;
to-day it circulates in every state and territory of the Union. Other
journals are also well received.

G. A. ALLEN-IT's A " NEW WORLD "... FOR BIRDS
All this has resulted in a public demand for the unusual species.
This is being met partially by domestic breeders, but to a large extent
by importations from the corners of the earth. Europe's exports to
the Western Hemisphere are increasing : but Africa, the Near East,
the Orient, New Guinea, Australia, and South America, are also
supplying an ever-growing number.
The Budgerigar is at present enjoying great popularity in the Ameri-
can home. Because of its friendly nature, ability to talk and ease in
propagation, it has made a market for itself comparable to any new
fashion fad. But, fashions change, and other species will gain equal
popularity. The exotic species of parrots are in ascendancy, and
rightly so, because of their brilliant colours and adaptability to
household training. And, of course, the canary is a classic pet.
Thirty-two years ago, my oriental pheasants took nearly every
prize ribbon the fairs here had to offer. But I must confess that they
were almost the only birds of their kind to be seen in this part of
America ! To-day oriental pheasants are familiar members of most
amateur collections, and certainly basic to every aviary. Any school
child knows them.
But even more remarkable is the new crop of organizations in this
field. In the past five years alone, over forty-five new groups have
organized with serious motives. Nor are we any longer considered
hobbyists. Congress must now reckon with bird enthusiasts as a first-
class pressure group ! Rightly or wrongly, one large society recently
has actually been a force in delaying the construction of a large
federal power dam project because its members feared this would
destroy a wildlife area !
Like their forerunners in Europe, the American scientific organiza-
tions and societies stimulate interest in the preservation of unusual
species, and keep the public informed on their care.
Yes, birds have achieved their place on the American scene. They
have come out of the laboratories and museums into our homes and
hearts. Breeding is now a recognized industry. Conservation is an
accepted responsibility. Collecting is almost a national habit. These
little feathered promoters put our best publicity experts to shame.
For, once properly introduced, they are a product which really
" speak for themselves ".
It will be some time before birds on this continent have the popular
understanding and respect which they enjoy in Europe. But there can
be no doubt that they now have entered a " new world ", and before
long will become equally endeared to the American people.

Some time ago my Fischer's Lovebirds (Agapornis fischeri) had five
babies. Usually I finger tame these funny little creatures much the
same as the young Budgies. There was one in the nest which seemed to
me to be particularly brighter than the others and I named him
Scampy. We spent a great deal of time together--he liked to cuddle
close to my neck and would run in and out of a paper bag retrieving
buttons and bottle caps I would throw in.
At the time I happened to be training two young Budgies and had
them with me the greater part of the day, sitting on my shoulder and
running around my neck from one shoulder to the other. Scampy
chose a place right under my chin to cuddle.
As he grew older he enjoyed perching on the play pen and became
unusually friendly with Buddy, our famous talking Budgie. Usually
Buddy enjoys the company of other birds, but being somewhat un-
certain how he would welcome Scampy, I watched very closely.
Unlike most lovebirds Scampy made no pretence of biting
Buddy's toes and apparently all was well for they got along beautifully
and were always together. This probably being the reason that
Scampy has learned to talk.
One day recently Scampy was on my desk where I was writing and
I was sure I heard him say a few words. Continuing with my work as
before and paying not the least bit of attention to him I watched him
closely. On my desk is a shiny brass calendar which intrigues him
immensely. Soon I heard him say " Pretty Boy " as plain as day. You
may well imagine my astonishment when I heard him utter his first
words.
He since has added " sweet " to this and I am anxiously waiting for
the rest of the sentence for I am almost sure he is trying to say " sweet-
heart 55 .
This has convinced me that birds taken from the nest early are far
superior as talkers. They have complete confidence in us at this early
age and show such devotion.
To my knowledge there is but one other lovebird that talked.
I believe he was a Peach-faced {Agapornis rosicollis ) and owned,
if I remember correctly, by someone in England. I understand
this little fellow would sit on his master's shoulder, nip his ear, and
say " naughty boy ".

By Marvin L. Jones (U.S. Army, Germany)
Of the eight major zoos of Western Germany to-day, the finest
collection of birds is at Cologne. The zoo, having made the greatest
change from war destruction to modernness, also has an admirable
mammal and a small reptile collection. Not having the money of
some of its sisters in Germany, it has, through skilful bargaining and
business acumen, made a name for itself in the post-war zoo world.
Its Director since May, 1952, Dr. Wilhelm Windecker, has added
over 200 species of animals to the colony since his arrival, many of
which are not to be seen elsewhere in the Federal Republic. The
initial impression given to a foreign visitor is of a zoo that has suffered
very much, but is trying very hard to make good once again. The
buildings are for the most part very old and rather decrepit, but must
serve till funds will permit replacement. The Monkey House in par-
ticular is in the same style as i860, when it was opened, and some of
the cages seem older. Paint is needed as are new bars and retaining
walls, but the outside has been repaired quite well, and helps the
overall picture. Only the Bird House can be called new, even though
the shell of it was built in 1890. The interior is new, opened in the
summer of 1952, in the style of Bronx Park, minus the balconies.
The cages along one wall are for the larger birds such as toucans and
hornbills, while the opposite side has smaller cages for the weavers and
finches. All are wired in front and on the sides, and serviced from a
rear alleyway ; the wire and walls are painted cream colour and
help cheer up the place somewhat. At one end of the building is a
very large swamp type cage, with peat moss and a pool for the waders,
and at the other two cages for monkeys, with smaller glass covered
ones for the humming birds and sunbirds. These have plants and
limbs, while the larger ones have perches and leaves on the floor. In
one corner of the finch side are a series of glass-covered cages in tier
fashion, the bottom for mammals and the top for the parrakeets and
lories. The centre of the building has palms and benches for the
visitors. A very interesting exhibit of winter shelters for the wild birds
of the region is now being held in this space at the same time. The
other two exhibition buildings are the Elephant House, a very old
structure also, and the old Ostrich House made new as a combined
Reptile and Winter House for the birds. The entire collection of
reptiles is to be seen here in aquariums of varying size and varieties.
Some of these are home-made and are very nice, featuring growing
plants and dirt floors ; some have pools, but others no water. The
cages for the birds are of wire (reinforced) with connecting doors to

outdoor pens ; all are without tops, as are the pens. The centre cage
has a large pool and is for the flamingoes. Pools flank the wall and
create a more or less natural barrier to the cages for the crocodilians.
Scattered throughout the zoo are cages for birds, in temporary
fashion, as a new run for the pheasants and related forms is under
construction, and will be ready for occupancy by the end of December,
r 953-
For the waterfowl are provided two large lakes with adequate
breeding quarters ; these contain running water, so no danger of
possible stagnation exists. The cranes and the swans are in a very large
open lake area just near the main gate and about two blocks square.
Several of the animals and birds are afforded complete liberty, such
as the guans, tapir, and macaws. The latter have so far (the tempera-
ture has fallen below freezing on two occasions) been left out to seek
shelter wherever they wish. The macaws prefer an open branch while
the guans and tapir like thickets. None has so far proved of any
trouble, and no bites have been reported, despite large numbers of
children in the summer. Those in the zoo line can well understand
the tension that these little devils can create in liberty animals.
On clear days a parrot school is held on the lawn just outside the
Bird House and has proved a big hit with the visitors. It is very
surprising what the Amazons can be taught with a little patience.
In all fairness to the Frankfurt Zoo, which also has a very large
collection, Cologne has a better representation of the birds normally
kept in a bird house, while Frankfurt leads in Accipitriformes, flightless
birds, owls, and the herons. This zoo, however, lacks a good grouping
of waterfowl despite a very large lake, and smaller cage birds. Like-
wise its Bird House is very old fashioned in keeping many of its inmates
in cages similar to those used in pet stores, or very crowded. Both have
their merits and rarities, but in my opinion Cologne takes the lead
and has the finest specimens in plumage and colour. Taking therq in
order seen and not scientifically, we have in the new Tropical
House a very nice male Eastern Cock of the Rock in full plumage,
sharing a rocky, tropical planted cage with a number of sunbirds
recently received from Africa, and as yet unidentified. This is the
only Cock of the Rock in Germany and one of few in Europe. Antwerp
has a female but no male. Sharing quarters in the same house are a
single specimen of the rarely seen Indian Adjutant and a pair of
Marabous, as well as a Saddle-bill, and one Secretary Bird. Pro-
ceeding along the walk toward the Bird House the next exhibit to
catch our eyes is the large cranes' enclosure, filled with East and
Western Crowns and Demoiselle, with a family of Mute Swans for
company. The usually unruly Andean Geese are also to be seen here
in the form of a pair, another pair are in the main waterfowl pond.
Both get along very well with the other birds in contrast to all published

reports on this rare form of Magellan Goose. Just beyond the old
bear dens and Lampeshausen, the village of rabbits, is the well-filled
main waterfowl pond or Teich as it is called in German. A well-
represented grouping is to be seen with many specimens which are
newcomers from the Tilburg Zoo. The rarest are the Ashy-headed
Geese, a young pair, and the typical Magellan Geese. A quartet
of Spot-billed Ducks, two of the Black-backed Comb Ducks, and all
the other waterfowl in the zoo are kept here, with the exception of the
Goscorobas, which are on a small pond with the Bahama Pintails
and the colourful Mandarins, Wood Ducks, and the Formosan Teal,
with their equally rare cousins, the Maned Geese of Australia which
are kept on a waterfall-made pond just in the rear of the main pool.
Now within view is the main Bird House, a strange-looking structure
reopened in 1952, and almost overcrowded with a well-rounded
collection. The outdoor flying cage contains the Trumpeters, rare
Orange-naped Imperial Pigeon, and Red-billed Green Fruit Pigeon,
as well as the Illiger's Macaw, Pileated Jay, and a fine Magpie
Jay of Central America. Flanking the two entrances are cages for
the birds of prey, wire fronted with gravel flooring, and providing
adequate room for all but the Condors. This trio came from Tilburg
in the spring shipment, as did many of the collection. It is made up
of a mature male and two immature specimens, a male and a female ;
all get along very well so far. The Red Kite shares a cage with the
Kestrels, and the fine Bateleur, a male just coming into colour, is their
neighbour.
Once indoors the first sight is a mass exhibition of bill posters of
zoos from other parts of Europe ; several are from the Eastern Zone
and Holland. It is a very unusual thing to see a zoo boosting others
in such a manner. The main building is very large, about equal to
the London Zoo main building, and in the same style, except for the
lack of cages in the centre. All but four are wire-fronted and have
adequate skylighting, providing plenty of light even on rainy days.
The light-coloured walls and cage fronts (in contrast to the dark
greens and greys of many zoo bird houses) help this a great deal.
The collection is arranged in no definite manner, but according to
the neighbourliness of its occupants. Due to the limited number of
cages some, such as the finch and tanager cages, are so filled that it is
almost impossible to count the number seen.
Just right of the main door and proceeding in this manner, we first
come to four little picture cages for the humming bird, sunbird
(Tacazze), whiteeyes, and the sugar-bird. These are about
3x2x2 feet, and have painted backbrounds. They are serviced, as
are all cages, from the rear. That they agree with the inmates is proved
by only three deaths since their opening, and these were delicate
humming birds. A fluorescent lamp gives adequate light and shows

off the brilliant colours of the sunbird and humming bird very
effectively. The next series of cages are large enough for all to get
a good flight, and are for the larger types of birds. The fine collection
of Rhamphastines are kept here, as well as the hornbills. They are well
mixed, but agree with one another. The one toucan named ? is
a semi-adult bird called vitellinus by Windecker, but which appears to
be the same as ariel but with less red in the breast. I recall vitellinus has
a yellow and white breast, so until further checking will leave as it is.
The Ariels are very good and in fine colour, as is the young Toco. The
Concave-casqued Hornbills are a true pair without a doubt, and next
year plans are set to attempt to get them to build a nest and breed.
The formerly rare Hartlaub's Touraco, now seen in zoos all over the
world, share their cage with a fine Buttner's, another rara avis. Farther
down the line is one cage just full of pigeons and doves. Amongst
the rarer species are the Amethyst Pigeon of Jobi, the Brown Witch
Dove, and the Blue-headed Dove. All are great buddies and perch
together very well. One cage in this grouping is filled with the fine
myna collection, including the Lesser Hill, Bank, and Golden-crowned.
The latter has never been seen before by me in any zoo and I would
appreciate any comments on its previous exhibition. The end of the
building has a large swamp cage with planted trees and shrubs pro-
viding cover and perches for its many inhabitants. The Burmeister's
Gariama, never common, is here along with the Tiger Bittern and
Ypecaha Wood Rail, the not too often seen (not in Europe that is)
Florida Heron and Snowy Egret, and some Australian Grows (I don't
know the real common name), likewise never seen before by me. The
Red Bird of Paradise shares the next cage with the colies and the jays.
It is a male and is now in full plumage, the wire-like tail feathers a very
nice length. Among the many inhabitants of the crowded finch cages
are Versicolor Buntings, Blue-backed Manakin, Mountain Cardinal.
Green Cardinal, Diuca Finch, and Blue Thrush.
In the tanager cage the collection is comprised mostly of the smaller
species, such as Three-coloured Calliste and Violet Euphonia, with a
nice full-coloured Brazilian and a Black Tanager. The tier-arranged
cages which provide space for the small mammals on the lower level,
and birds on the upper, are the quarters of a pair of the Queen
Alexandra's Parrakeet, not seen elsewhere in Germany, two Orange-
fronted Gonures, and an excellent specimen of the Red-backed Lory.
The building has many more rarely seen forms and most of the
commoner ones. Just outside the Bird House is the Parrot School,
already mentioned, and the favourite tree of the at liberty Macaws.
A grand and unusual sight is the full plumaged Red and Blue Macaw
in full flight from this tree to another a full block away. The birds have
now been at liberty since early spring, and have never attempted to
stray from the zoo. Directly behind this open area are the new quarters

for the flamingoes, a natural swamp, which they seem to enjoy
immensely. In the winter they will be brought in, as ice is the mam
danger, and usually forms overnight, when no one is around to
break it up. At the rear end of the zoo in an area, still showing the
ravages of war by bombing, are temporary cages for the pheasants,
and a range for the Emus and Ground Hornbills. The Leadbeater s
Ground Hornbill is one of the forms uncommonly seen. Returning to
the main zoo area are passed the cages for common European birds,
such as the Partridge and Tawny Owl. The majority of the rare
birds have been listed, but many others, such as the Baillon's Aracan,
Spot-billed Toucanet, Red-banded Aracari, Great Barbet, and the
Sonnerat's Junglefowl, could be described as such also.

THE NATIONAL CAGE BIRDS EXHIBITION
OF 1954

certainly as good as any of the great shows that I can remember, and
I have not missed many, in fact we are told that it was a record,
a word I seem to remember hearing after every show I have attended.
No doubt it was so, chiefly from the enormous and ever-growing
popularity of the Budgerigar. Canaries and Budgerigars occupied
practically the whole of the body of the hall, and for the foreign and
more interesting of the British birds one had to ascend to the spacious
gallery.
I am not particularly interested in Canaries nor, to any great
extent, in Budgerigars, since they have become as domesticated as
Canaries or poultry, but there is one particularly interesting point
about them, namely the extreme rapidity with which they have
become domesticated. I remember very well the first pair of blues
(or I think it was a trio) exhibited at the Royal Horticultural Hall
in November, 1910, by Mr. Pauvvels, of Belgium. They caused quite
a sensation as they also did when, with their owner s permission,
I showed them at a meeting of the Zoological Society. This was at
that time the only variety, except the yellow, to appear in the
Budgerigar, and now, forty-four years later, we see the bird changed
in size and present in a great variety of colours and combinations of
colour, and in this one show, numbering some 2,600 birds. This
shows what can be done in a very free-breeding species by careful
selective breeding. The Budgerigar is surely quite unique in the
way it has taken to a domestic life.
The class for Lovebirds and Parrotlets was well filled, mostly by

Fischer's Lovebirds. This is a fine species which I hope will not be
allowed to dwindle and die out, as has been the case with some of
the Lovebirds such as the Black-cheeks and the once common
Madagascar. There were some excellent Masked, Peach-faced, and
Red-faced, as well as Blue-winged Parrotlets.
d here was a beautiful Golden-mantled Rosella which quite put
the Common Rosellas in the shade, a fine pair of the now very rare
Derbyan Parrakeet, some very good Stanleys, Plumheads, and Cocka-
tiels, as well as a grand pair of Queen Alexandras. I wish they would
not persist in calling this bird the "Princess of Wales' Parrakeet".
There has been only one Queen Alexandra, and it was in honour of
this great lady that Gould named the bird, although she was Princess
of Wales at the time.
Amongst the Lories and Lorikeets was a beautiful pair of the very
rare and pretty Musschenbroek's Lorikeets, as well as several of the
typical Lories. Hanging Parrots were represented by Blue-crowned
and Vernal. There was a good Hawk-head, two female Eclectus,
and a lovely Lear's Macaw.
There were two classes for the commoner Waxbills which were well
filled, while that for the rarer Waxbills and their allies contained
some such gems as Violet-ears, Dufresnes, Painted Finches, and others
not often seen. Parrot Finches, Gouldians, and other Grass Finches
were well represented.
Amongst other seed-eaters one noticed several species of Cardinal
and the American Evening Grosbeak, Yarrell's Siskin, Golden
Sparrows, and the rare Green Twinspot. I was interested to see a
pair of the charming Painted Quails, delightful birds for a grassed
aviary, but not suitable as cage birds.
The Zebra Finch seems to be becoming as much a domestic bird
as the Budgerigar. There were no less than four classes for it, one
for the normal type, one for " Cinnamon and Fawn," one for " White,
Cream, Silver, and Albino ", and the fourth for " Pied and any
other colour I must say the Zebra in the form and colour in which
Nature made it is beautiful enough for me.
The foreign soft-bills formed a grand collection. The humming
birds of which some half-dozen species were shown, appeared to be in
excellent condition, and seemed to be enjoying themselves in spite
of the comparatively low temperature prevailing, though the manage-
ment had done everything possible to warm that part of the hall.
Sunbirds, too, were well represented by such showy species as the
Amethyst, Malachite, Tacazze, and Amethyst-rumped, a lovely
group which did not in the least find fault with their conditions.
Sugar-birds and Zosterops too looked very good, while the Tanagers,
both large and small, were in great force and of many species. They
are amongst the world's most colourful birds, but not more beautiful

than others we were still to see 5 Niltavas in black and. blue take a lot
of beating, and the pair shown had as their neighbours the Natal and
Cape Robin, both most attractive species. The Thrushes and Fruit-
suckers were also a nice lot with the very handsome Blue and so-called
Common Rock-Thrush, the Orange-headed, and Olive-backed
Thrushes.
Some of the Starlings are amongst the most showy of birds, and
here were nearly a score of these from the brilliant Long-tailed and
Purple-headed Glossy and the Spreos to the more sombre-hued
Pagoda Starlings ; and of their near relations, the Mynahs, we were
introduced to several that were expert talkers.
There were some good Toucans, Blue Pies, and Jays, and a class
of only two entries for Doves contained a pair of Barred and a pair
of the very pretty and rare Plumed Doves from the dry parts of
Australia, very desirable in an aviary where desert conditions can be
maintained, but not looking their best in a cage.
The last classes in a show of this kind are generally the most
interesting, and may produce some thrills, because they generally
contain birds that are quite out of the ordinary run. The three classes
concerned were for " All other " softbills (i) not larger than a Pekin
Robin, ( 2 ) Larger than a Pekin Robin, but not larger than a Glossy
Starling, and (3) Larger than a Glossy Starling. In (1) there were
Red-headed Manakins, delicate little black birds with bright red
heads, Blue-backed Manakin and Coppersmith Barbet. In (2) were
a pair of the rare African Jacana or Lily-trotters, birds only suited
to an aviary containing water-lilies, a Wilson's Bird of Paradise in
very good condition, a Blue-winged Pitta, Green-winged Malkoha
(a species of Cuckoo), Brown Thrasher, Babblers, and Barbets ; all
very rare birds. The last of these three classes contained the most
spectacular birds of all, namely three species of the larger Birds ol
Paradise, a Greater, a Red, and a Twelve-wired, all in lovely condition,
though the last had broken off the delicate tail-wires from which the
species derives its name. The judges awarded to the Greater Bird
the prize for the best Foreign Bird in the show.
British Birds were well represented, with no less than six well-filled
classes for those bred in cages or aviaries. The breeding of British
birds in captivity has progressed steadily since foreign birds became
more difficult to obtain than formerly, and much can be learnt of the
breeding habits of even our commoner birds by this means, as was
proved by Dr. David Lack when he bred the common Robin in an
aviary.
British soft-bills were a lovely lot, such mites as Wrens, Willow
Warblers, and Tree-Creepers being in perfect condition, and proving
the great skill of their owners. This section was of great educational
value to all who wished to see, in the flesh, some of our least common

native species such as the Black and Common Redstarts, Shorelark,
Fieldfare, Ring Ouzel, Golden Oriole, or Great Grey Shrike. The
Waxwings were, as usual, looking sleek and beautiful. They are the
most contented of birds so long as they can gorge themselves on the
food they like. I used to find that soaked currants suited them very
well and did not make them too fat, which Waxwings are very inclined
to become.
On the whole, the birds were shown in suitable cages, though there
were some exceptions, but I would like to protest against the present
fashion of painting the bars of the cages white. If we painted the
wire-netting of our aviaries white, the birds would be practically
invisible, so we paint them black, and the birds show to perfection.
These white cage-fronts only dazzle the eyes and spoil the view of the
occupant.
From this brief and incomplete review it will be gathered that the
National Exhibition has been a grand show, splendidly organized by
the proprietors of Cage Birds , to whom all interested in aviculture owe
a deep debt of gratitude. It has been a great undertaking and we
are told that any profits are to be handed over to charity.

Lieut.-Col. C. L. Boyle showed the Carling Conservation Club
coloured sound film " Ring-neck Pheasant This film depicts the
life history of the Ring-neck, introduced into Canada mainly for
sport, so it is perhaps not altogether surprising that it commences with
the shooting of several pheasants and ends in the same way. It, never-
theless, is of great interest and contains some really excellent close-ups.
J. C. Garratt showed his coloured film " Humming Birds ". The
title inadequately describes the contents of the film as, in addition to
Humming Birds, it shows many other birds in the aviaries at " Wych-
wood ". No particular sequence is followed and we are shown indis-

have bred eleven young, making thirty-three in three seasons. The
most interesting event has been one young Crimson-wing which I
hand-reared from three days old. The Crimson-wing egg was incu-
bated for two weeks under a big split-fallow Budgerigar hen, and
then completed by my Stanley hen, who refused to feed the youngster.
Hand-rearing has taken four months before the youngster was entirely
independent. However, it was well worth it as the youngster is strong
and healthy and, of course, very tame."

In the last [1953, 176] I stated that Sir Edward Hallstrom had bred
the Red-eared Conure (Pyrrhura cruentata ) last year. I have recently
seen the true P. cruentata (a very lovely bird) at Wassenaar, and it
is certainly not the bird Sir Edward bred. I rather think now that
it was the Red-bellied that he bred, but I will try and confirm this

Dr. E. Beraut writes from Rio de Janeiro : " My collection of
Humming Birds is still doing well. I possess one Heliactin cornutus in
wonderful plumage, a young bird which has moulted in my aviary,
and my best bird. I believe I now know the best way to keep the
more difficult species : Heliactin, Heliothrix, and particularly Pygmornis ,
which live and moult perfectly, mostly thanks to a massive production
of fruit flies ( Drossophila ).
" I also use a new way of transportation ; instead of putting the
Humming Birds in a cage, which creates difficulties in airplanes,
I place each of them in a small bag of cloth with a small hole for the
head to stick out. They are thus obliged to keep quiet and do not
become exhausted. Every hour, I take them out of the box where
I keep them during the trip and make them drink. They can travel
for twenty-four hours under such conditions without being tired."

years, both at first-hand and through the experience of his trusted
aviary attendants in France.
The encouraging tone of the book, as evidenced by such sentences
as " All the pheasants, with very few exceptions, live and breed well
in captivity ", should go far to make recruits for the hobby and sport
of pheasant-keeping. Moreover, the suggestions for keeping these
handsome birds are of such a useful and practical nature as to enable
almost anyone to apply them with satisfactory results.
The descriptions of the various species are very compact and to the
point--sufficient to enable the reader to recognize and identify them.
The accompanying black-and-white illustrations are excellent close-up
photographs of birds in typical poses ; they enhance the practical
value of the text measurably.
Detailed suggestions for the construction of runs, shelters, etc., are
given, all based on actual and successful experience. The sections
devoted to breeding and to feeding are especially good--two phases of
pheasant-keeping which must be mastered to make a success of this
fascinating pastime or business. Of special interest and value is the
chapter entitled " Pheasant Health and Disease Control ", con-
tributed by Dr. Jungherr, who heads the Department of Animal
Diseases at the University of Connecticut. One of the most valuable
aspects of this handy up-to-date book is the excellent bibliography
printed at the end. It enables the reader to delve more deeply into
whatever phase of pheasant-keeping happens to intrigue him.

The numerous species of birds occurring in Saxony are given separate
and detailed listings in this comprehensive book. Each listing explains
the frequency of occurrence as well as the distribution of the bird or
birds in question, supported by references. Anyone seeking dependable
information regarding the many species of birds occurring in Saxony
will find this book a rich source.
A detailed alphabetical index of places--towns and villages--where
certain birds occur as well as an alphabetical index of the scientific
names of the birds of Saxony round out this practical work.

PARROTS EXCLUSIVELY. By Karl Plath, Curator of Birds,
Chicago Zoological Park, Cessa Feyerabend, and Dr. Irving
E. Altman. Illustrated. Fond du Lac, Wisconsin : All-Pets
Books, Inc., 1953. 54 pages. $1.25. (Exclusive British Dis-
tributor : Bailey Bros, and Swinfen, Ltd., 46 St. Giles High
Street, London, W.C. 2.)
This well-illustrated book, with colourful paper cover, is repre-
sentative of the practical guide-books which All-Pets, Inc., is issuing
in increasing numbers. Three authorities, each one thoroughly
conversant with his or her subject, have pooled their experience and
their knowledge to produce this handy and highly informative book
on parrots, which are now in their hey-day of popularity both in
Europe and in the United States.
Following his introductory comments on feeding, caging, and
breeding, Karl Plath describes in pithy, specific language the different
species of parrotlike birds, beginning with the Amazons, followed
by the Macaws, Gonures and other American parrakeets, Lovebirds,
Cockatoos, and, finally, Cockatiels. Some excellent black-and-white
illustrations enhance the text noticeably.
The section devoted to " Personality and Training " is indeed
interesting, dealing as it does with the remarkable ability of parrotlike
birds to respond to human training, and citing many fascinating and
some unique instances of unusually well-trained birds. The reader
is given practical suggestions as to which species of parrotlike birds
are likely to become good talkers, when they should be purchased,
and how they should be taught.
The final portion of this handy book presents practical hints on
how to keep your parrotlike birds in good health for many years. It
is therefore one of the most important in the book ; it was written
by Mr. Altman, a veterinary doctor.
The illustrations were done by Karl Plath and also by Douglas
Tibbitts, staff illustrators for the Chicago Natural History Museum.

Breeding Ocellated Turkeys at the Rotterdam Zoo
With reference to my information in this Magazine, No. 5, Vol. 58, September-
October, 1952, it may be of interest to mention the breeding results obtained in 1953.
The hen (of the same pair) laid from 13th May until 18th June (rather late in the
season) 14 eggs, all fertile. Ten chicks hatched, five of which had bad (crooked) toes.
Eight chicks were raised, the two that died were faultless. The sex-ratio was about
fifty-fifty.

THE MASKED F INFOOT ( Heliopais per sonata)
</equation>
<bodyText confidence="0.928801228571428" page_id="58091064"  page_num="Page 39" year="" vol="">
I write to inquire if any member of the Society can give any information as to the
above bird. Has the Finfoot ever been bred in captivity, and for that matter has it
ever been shown in a U.K. zoo ? I think, am not too certain, I once saw a Finfoot
fly across a stream in Upper Assam. But I have never seen it in captivity.

[We have no information regarding the importation of this bird, and regard it as
unlikely.--E d.]
MOUSTACHE OR BANDED PARRAKEET {Psittacula a. fasciata)
This bird is very common in India. In captivity it seems difficult to breed, at
least not many definite successes have been recorded. I put this down to the fact
it does not stand captivity very well.
I have lost, I suppose, nearly a dozen birds in the last two years. Only one did
I manage to keep alive for any length of time, a female which I had for nearly that
period. All the rest died during the quarantine period I always give to new birds
on arrival, or within the next three to four months.
And always the same complaint--pneumonia--save one killed in a hailstorm.
At least the symptoms are those of pneumonia. I have no post-mortem facilities here.
The bird is in rude health one minute, sick the next, and dead within 6-8 hours.
All the pneumonia symptoms as set out in Tavistock's Parrots and Parrot-like Birds.
My last two casualties were quite recent. As soon as the birds showed signs of illness,
I treated them with Sulphamethazine, but to no effect. The disease is so rapid the
drug seems to have no time to take effect.
But what causes the disease ?
I was and am anxious to breed Moustache Parrakeets. I like the birds. But they
have beaten me. I just cannot keep them alive, and I think I am not alone in this.
A certain zoo in India seems to have the same trouble, at least I have noted a succession
of these birds, following on casualties presumably. And it cannot be the climate,
chills etc. ; P. a. fasciata is indigenous.
Can any member of the Society throw any light on how to keep the Moustache
Parrakeet in good health in captivity ?

BREEDING PARROTLET HYBRIDS

<bodyText confidence="0.886895818181818" page_id="58091065"  page_num="Page 40" year="" vol="">
I have read the letter from H. Wildeboer in the Avicultural Magazine, Novem-
ber-December, 1953, referring to my Parrotlet article. Of course I have read
Neunzig several times, but I can only say that perhaps he is speaking about another
sub-species of the Parrotlet family. The legs of all my birds are of nearly the same
colour, differing only a little from flesh-coloured to greyish flesh-coloured, but not
according to species. My Green-rumped Parrotlets are not bigger than my Blue-
rumped ; if two old cocks perch side by side, the Blue-rumped looks definitely the
bigger.

BREEDING RED-BELLIED CONURES
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.97529175" page_id="58091065"  page_num="Page 40" year="" vol="">
I have been successful with my Red-bellied Conures (Pyrrhura frontalis ) this year.
The hen laid in June, and after incubating for approximately 30 days, hatched
out two young in the first part of July, which left the nest 45 days later. The hen
incubated alone, but the young ones were fed by both parents. They used dry seed,
sprouted seed, and mostly ripe apple and pear as rearing food.
When the youngsters left the nest they were fully feathered, nice birds very much
like their parents, but a little duller in colour and with shorter tails. The parents,
especially the cock, fed them for nearly a fortnight after they had left the nest. The
old birds did not feel inclined to start a second brood, but after a month or two the
hen became very bored with the youngsters, and I transferred them to another cage.
The breeding cage, only 80 cm. long, was placed in my bird-room with a nest-box
(formerly used for Bourke's) placed outside.

The Medal may be awarded at the discretion of the Council to any
Member who shall succeed in breeding, in the United Kingdom, any species of
bird which shall not be known to have been previously bred in captivity in Great
Britain or Northern Ireland. Any Member wishing to obtain the Medal must send
a detailed account for publication in the Magazine within about eight weeks from
the date of hatching of the young, and furnish such evidence of the facts as the
Council may require. The Medal will be awarded only in cases where the
young shall live to be old enough to feed themselves, and to be wholly independent
of their parents. The question of awarding a Medal for the breeding of local
races or sub-species of species that have already been bred shall be at the discretion
of the Council. No Medal can be given for the breeding of hybrids.
The account of the breeding must be reasonably full so as to afford
instruction to our Members, and must appear in the Avicultural Magazine
before it is published or notified elsewhere. It should describe the plumage of
the young, and be of value as a permanent record of the nesting and general habits of the
species. These points will have great weight when the question of awarding the
Medal is under consideration.
In every case the decision of the Council shall be final.
The Medal will be forwarded to each Member as soon after it shall have
been awarded as possible.
The Medal is struck in bronze (but the Council reserve the right to issue
it in silver in very special cases) and measures 2^ inches in diameter. It bears on
the obverse a representation of two birds with a nest containing eggs, and the
words " The Avicultural Society--founded 1894 "* On the reverse is the following
inscription : " Awarded to [ name of recipient] for rearing the young of [ name of
species ], a species not previously bred in captivity in the United Kingdom."
The Council may grant a special medal to any member who shall succeed
in breeding any species of bird that has not previously been bred in captivity in
Europe.

THE BREEDING OF THE MOUNTAIN
BLUE ROBIN
(1 Sialia currucoides)

By Kenneth A. Norris (Purley, Surrey, England)
Owing to the very strict protection of the Blue Robins in their
native countries of Canada and North America, these birds are
familiar only to the few aviculturists in England who have been
fortunate enough to procure the few specimens which have so rarely
been imported during recent years. Of the three species, Sialia sialis,
S. mexicana , and S. currucoides , the latter is probably the least known.
Its range includes Western North America and Canada, from the
West Coast east to Manitoba and north to the Yukon and Mackenzie
Valley. During the past few years it has been extending its range
eastward and is said now to be more or less well established as far as
central Manitoba.
According to Taverner's Birds of Canada, its choice of nesting sites
is very varied and it is equally at home in the hollow cornices of
buildings, dead tree stumps, old Woodpecker holes in telegraph posts,
or in nest-boxes hung about the buildings and trees of the prairie
homesteads. In wild barren country it is found nesting in crannies in
the rocks and cliffs--in fact, its only requirement seems to be a suitable
hole to shelter the nest, irrespective of where it may be.
Mr. Reid-Henry's excellent portrayal of a pair of adult birds and
one of their young renders a detailed description of their plumage
unnecessary. It will be seen that they have much longer flight feathers
and tail than our own familiar Robin, the legs being comparatively
short and set well back on the body. As a result, their movements on
the ground are awkward and the wings are used constantly to assist
progress.
When resting on some favourite post or branch they assume an
upright posture, the legs and feet being completely covered by the
lower breast feathers, and in this position they more closely resemble

K. A. NORRIS-THE BREEDING OF THE MOUNTAIN BLUE ROBIN
the Flycatchers in appearance. They will " hawk " after any flying
insect which may come within range and seldom fail to catch a meal-
worm thrown into the aviary. Their remarkable agility on the wing,
combined with their general structure and rather flattened beaks,
suggests that, in a natural state, they must subsist largely on insects
taken on the wing.
I was fortunate enough to receive an adult pair of these very lovely
birds in June, 1952, and, as is my usual practice with new arrivals,
they were housed in a large cage in the bird-room for the first month.
They settled down quickly and took readily to insectivorous food
with the addition of a few gentles and six mealworms each, per day.
As weed seeds and soft fruit are said to form an important part of
their diet in a wild state, these were also supplied at first, but the birds
have shown no inclination even to sample them and they have since
been discontinued.
In July they were moved to an outdoor, unheated aviary, measuring
9 feet by 5 feet, of which 3 feet is entirely enclosed to form sheltered
sleeping quarters, the remainder being open wire flight, fitted only
with artificial perching. This aviary they shared with Cedar Waxwings,
an American Crossbill, and a pair of Golden Pheasants, but as the
latter soon formed the habit of flying up to the various food dishes,
either upsetting them or consuming all the food before the smaller
birds had fed, they were subsequently removed.
The Robins remained in this aviary throughout the autumn and
winter. Early in the following April the hen commenced to carry
nesting material to an open-fronted nest-box measuring 6 inches by
4 inches by 6 inches, which was hung in the open flight, beneath the
overhanging eaves of the sleeping quarters.
From past experience I have found it important, if success is to be
achieved under artificial conditions, not only to provide suitable
nesting sites but also the actual materials with which a species is
accustomed to build, especially for the lining of the nest. A striking
example of this had been provided by the Cedar Waxwings, which
had nested in the same aviary the previous year. These birds, which
had arrived in immature plumage, proved to be inexperienced in the
art of nest construction, even failing to bind the materials successfully
in a shallow woven cradle that had been provided as a foundation.
As the hen was obviously on the point of laying, I decided to assist by
supplying a " pre-fab ", using for this purpose a very substantial
Robin's nest from which the young had recently flown.
This the Waxwings accepted with every sign of satisfaction until they
discovered the hair lining which was evidently not according to
Waxwing specification, for together they stood on the edge of the nest
and literally ripped it out. They then quickly collected a quantity of
small scarlet feathers shed by the Golden Pheasant and with these

formed a new lining to the nest in a remarkably short time, the first
egg being deposited on the following day.
I was unable to find any description of the Blue Robin's nest in the
books I had available and as soon as it became apparent that the hen
intended to build, I supplied a variety of materials, including dead
leaves, moss, fine roots, strips of birch bark, partly dry grass, small
twigs, short lengths of soft hemp string, hair, and feathers. From this
assortment she selected only the grass with which she formed a flimsy
nest, lining it with finer grass.
She laid four days after commencing to build and incubated steadily
for sixteen days, after which she left the nest and on investigation I
found it to contain only one pale blue, unmarked egg, which was
infertile.
This was no surprise as the cock had completely ignored the whole
proceedings and had, in fact, displayed some hostility to any close
approach of the hen during the early stages of building.
During the second week of May, however, he started to display,
perching near the hen, in a crouching position with wings held partly
extended and fluttering, thus showing to full advantage the brilliant
blue of his upper parts, or hovering before her, with a blade of grass
in his beak. Between displays, he constantly sang, or perhaps it would
be more accurate to say " warbled ", for so soft and sibilant were his
notes that often only the movement of his throat revealed that he was
singing.
Whenever mealworms were thrown into the aviary, he dexterously
caught them in the air as a Flycatcher would take gnats or other
winged insects and then, hovering directly above the hen, would offer
them to her. Should she fail immediately to accept, he would gently
tap her on the back with his feet. If she still failed to respond, he would
then alight beside her and thrust the insect towards her until she took
it in her beak. Even then it would sometimes be passed backwards and
forwards several times before the hen finally swallowed it, and it was
not until she had accepted three or four insects in this way that the
cock would himself feed. Thus encouraged, the hen again commenced
building, assisted occasionally by the cock who, however, did little
more than carry nesting material which he passed to her at the entrance
to the box, never himself entering or attempting to take part in the
actual construction of the nest.
On 19th May she commenced incubation and although she usually
left the nest when I visited with mealworms, she invariably returned
almost immediately, nor did she ever appear when anyone else
approached the aviary.
On 2nd June it became evident that young had hatched and both
birds started carrying mealworms and gentles to the nest, having first
prepared them by well chewing them between their mandibles until

they were limp and lifeless. Up to six were carried in the beak at a time
and were very quickly distributed.
Dr. A. G. Butler, describing his success in breeding the Eastern Blue
Robin, S. sialia , states that his birds never gave the young food which
was not partially digested, feeding them from the crop, on a mixture
of insects, vegetable, prepared insectivorous food, and also half digested
and softened seed (.Foreign Birds for Cage and Aviary , Part I, p. 25).
My birds never swallowed the insects and although they took prepared
food readily before the young hatched, this was completely ignored
when feeding commenced. Only live food was then taken and was fed
by the beak and not by regurgitation.
Feeding continued for ten days and then suddenly ceased and the
parent birds appeared to lose all interest in the nest. Examination of
the nest-box and a thorough search of the aviary failed to reveal any
signs of the young birds. On the following morning I noticed that the
box was almost completely filled with hay and found that mice had
taken possession, no doubt having dragged out the young birds and
carried them below ground during the previous night.
Towards the end of June the cock again started to display and within
a day or so the hen was building in a similar box, hung in the sleeping
quarters, in a position which was fortunately inaccessible to mice.
On 2nd July she commenced incubation for the third time and on
the 17th July both birds were again carrying food to the nest.
Until now the Robins had taken little notice of the other inmates
of the aviary but possibly due to the loss of their previous brood, they
suddenly became aggressive, particularly towards the American
Crossbill. They continually drove it from perch to perch until the
cock finally succeeded in pinning this unfortunate little bird to the
ground where it commenced systematically to tear the feathers from
its back, and would undoubtedly have killed it had I not been in time
to separate them.
Having removed the Crossbill to another aviary, I thought it
advisable also to remove the pheasants in order to ensure that the
Robins should have all the food they required but the Waxwings were
allowed to remain as, strangely enough, these birds were still com-
pletely ignored by the Robins nor did they ever attempt to approach
the nest or interfere in any way.
After the birds had been feeding for a week, I ventured to look into
the nest when the parents were out in the flight collecting insects, and
found it to contain three small young, clothed in dense black down,
relieved only by the conspicuous yellow line of the gape.
At this stage, the hen began to display resentment towards the cock
if he approached the nest and although he made desperate, and
occasionally successful, attempts to reach the young, she finally refused
to allow him even to enter the sleeping quarters.

K. A. NORRIS-THE BREEDING OF THE MOUNTAIN BLUE ROBIN
During the second week I again looked in the nest, to discover that
the young had made quite remarkable progress and were well fledged,
the colouring being very similar to that of the adult hen except that
the breast was heavily spotted.
On 7th August I noticed the three young sitting, crowded together,
in the entrance to the nest box. As soon as they saw me they slipped
back and crouched in the bottom of the nest, but on the following
morning one was on a low perch in the open flight and in the early
afternoon it was joined by the other two.
As soon as the young left the nest, the hen again allowed the cock to
approach them and both birds fed them at frequent intervals, no longer
troubling to prepare the food but thrusting the wriggling insects well
down the youngsters' throats. If an insect was inadvertently dropped,
it was immediately retrieved by one of the parents and again thrust
into an open beak and it was particularly interesting to note with what
care each young bird was fed in turn. On no occasion did I see one
bird receive a double dose, however clamorous or persistent it might be.
Just a week after the young appeared in the open, they commenced
themselves to pick up insects, deliberately dropped in front of them by
the parents and very soon afterwards became quite independent
although the old birds continued to shepherd them into a sheltered
position each night.
On 12th September and without any perceptible moult, intense blue
began to appear on the wing butts of two of the young birds, and on
15th September I noticed blue also appearing on the crown of the
head, immediately above the beak, followed a few days later by odd
blue feathers on the breast.
The third bird remained unchanged in colour but the spotting of the
breast began to fade and it was now obvious that there were two cocks
and a hen. At this stage fighting commenced between the old and the
young cocks and although I imagine that the adult bird was the
aggressor in the first instance, the young soon became equally ready to
start trouble, especially at feeding time. The old birds were already
moulting heavily and I therefore caught up the young and placed
them in a large cage in the bird room.
As soon as the young had been removed the parents resumed their
normal daily consumption of prepared food and the live insect supply
was reduced again to a small number of gentles and six mealworms
each.
I subsequently disposed of one young cock but the remaining pair
are still together and are doing remarkably well. The plumage of the
cock has changed little since he was transferred from the aviary and it

food except live insects, but are now taking a certain amount of
insectivorous mixture and occasionally a very little finely chopped date.
During the whole period of nesting and rearing, nest sanitation was
strictly observed, the excreta being removed by the parents and all
deposited on a cross-bar of the flight door, the most distant point
from the nest to which the birds had access. Even when the young
left the nest, this habit of " clearing up after a meal " persisted for
a few days, the old birds collecting and removing the excreta from below
the perch on which the young were sitting.
Gentles and mealworms, in equal proportions, were the only live
food supplied from the time of hatching until the young were removed
from the aviary and were consumed at the rate of four ounces per day,
an average of 1,020 insects a day continuously for nearly eight weeks
and this by an abnormally small brood !
Under natural conditions, a brood probably consists of four to six
young and I imagine the birds would be double brooded and might
even produce three broods in a favourable season.
There can be no doubt, therefore, that the benefit derived from the
presence of these and other small insectivorous birds in agricultural
and fruit growing areas is inestimable and the strict protection afforded
them by the Governments of Canada and America is more than fully

NOTES ON THE CYANISTIC PHASE OF THE
INDIAN RINGNECK PARRAKEET
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.9850341875" page_id="58091111"  page_num="Page 46" year="" vol="">
By David West (Montebello, California, U.S.A.)
Colour variations among normally green birds do not seem to be of
a too rare occurrence. The amazing little Budgerigar occurs in dozens
of colours, and other birds with large areas of green plumage which
appear subject to variation are Masked and Nyasa Lovebirds and,
in addition, there are Plumheads, lutino and blue phases of the Alexan-
drine, and lutino and blue phases of the Indian Ringneck Parrakeet.
The earliest references to this colour phase appear in the i92o's in
the Avicultural Magazine and Hachisuka's Variations Among Birds.
From published information it appears that at least one, and more
likely two, blue examples of the Indian Ringneck Parrakeet were kept
by a Mr. M. G. Mallick, of Calcutta, during the 1920's. From conversa-
tions with people who saw these birds in India it would appear that
both birds were cocks, were kept in individual cages, and that no
attempt was made to breed from them in order to perpetuate this
colour phase.

Continuing chronologically, the next reference to blue Ringnecks is
the 194 1 record of the example which Mr. Sheffler raised in his
Arizona aviary. This bird was reared from normal parents, and it was
a great tragedy that it was killed when only a few weeks old when
Mr. Sheffler tried to catch it for removal to other quarters. Although
the parents of this bird were kept for twelve years they never again
repeated their 1941 success. Mr. Sheffler recently told me that this
bird, like those currently in England and in California, was powder-
blue in colour.
After the end of World War II there is a notation in the Avicultural
Magazine of an English soldier seeing a blue Ringneck among a flock
of green ones while on duty in India. An American dealer also told
me that during a 1949 trip to India he saw a tame and talking blue
Ringneck which belonged to a poor Indian farmer. Although repeated
attempts were made to secure the bird nothing eventuated and the
dealer was forced to give up the idea of securing this bird. There is
always the possibility that this bird might have been useless for breeding
purposes if it were too tame.
During 1950 two blue Ringnecks were offered by an Indian dealer
to a Californian fancier for the sum of $1,000. At this time it was
believed that they were the only pair in captivity anywhere in the
world. As if the price were not enough of a drawback American
importation regulations would have made it virtually impossible to
secure the birds anyway, so rather regretfully a negative answer was
sent back to India.
Although I have no valid information from the late Duke of Bedford
it would appear logical that the pair of blue Ringnecks he secured
from India through the efforts of Mr. A. Ezra in 1950 were this same
pair offered to the Californian fancier. The Duke mentions in an
article that this pair consisted of an adult male and a young female
and that neither bird appeared to have been in captivity very long.
One cannot help but wonder if these birds were wild caught, or is
there someone in India breeding blue Ringnecks ?
Certainly the pair sent to Woburn did very well for they reared
a total of eleven young in three seasons. The actual numbers were as
follows ; in 1950 an interest was shown in the nest but the female was
too young and nothing eventuated ; in 1951 three were reared ; in
r 95 2 f* ur were reared ; and in 1953 another four were reared. In the
! 953 season a blue cock mated to a lutino hen also reared two green
youngsters.
The possible colour variations made possible by correctly mating
the lutino and blue phases will certainly open a new field of endeavour
for the aviculturist. An albino Ringneck is now a distinct possibility
and should be a really lovely bird if it retains the red bill and the pink
ring about the neck. Now that the Keston Foreign Bird Farm has

succeeded in breeding a nearly pure lutino Alexandrine (by mating
a female lutino Ringneck to a cock Alexandrine and then mating the
split sons back) the same method could be used to produce a blue
Alexandrine and then with these lutino and blue Alexandrines an
albino Alexandrine could be anticipated.
At the present time there are just thirteen blue Ringnecks in
captivity. Of this number four birds are here in California, eight are
in England, and one on the Continent. One can only hope that they
will all continue to prosper and that soon their present " unlucky "
number will be a much higher figure.

Supplementing Mr. West's notes, there are nine blue Ringnecks in
this country. If his information regarding one being on the conti-
nent " is correct there are therefore more than the unlucky thirteen
in captivity.
When the late Duke of Bedford's collection was so lamentably
dispersed, the original breeding pair passed into Mr. Boosey's care.
The 1950 trio, one hen and two cocks together with the two 1953 green
young bred from a blue cock and lutino hen were acquired by Mrs.
Clark, of Bromsgrove, and the four remaining immature birds came to
Ballinger.
It is hardly necessary to say that every effort is being made to
establish this magnificent colour variation. This desirable goal will
take time to achieve in view of the lengthy period taken to attain
maturity and the difficulty of sexing birds in the meantime. There is
also the desirability of introducing unrelated blood which of necessity
must either be normal or lutino strain since there are no other blue
birds available so far as is known.
One other point is worthy of mention, namely that in 1934 our
president, Mr. Ezra, successfully reared a blue Alexandrine. The
parents were a blue cock mated to one of his daughters by a normal
hen.

Although, like most bird-watchers, I had long admired the beauty
of the Red-legged Partridge, Alectoris rufa, it was by a pure accident
that I first started keeping these birds. Wandering with a friend
along an overgrown bank at a local sewage farm one morning in late
July, 1952, I nearly stepped on an incubating Red-leg. As it flew
off it became entangled in some weeds and struggled frantically for
some seconds before it succeeded in tearing itself free. On our return
at 6 p.m. we were, therefore, hardly surprised to find it had not
returned. We decided to give it another 24 hours, and in the mean-
time I inquired frantically, but in vain, for a broody bantam, and
I had to use a large black hen, the only broody obtainable. The
following evening the Partridge's nest was obviously deserted. One
of the eggs had been removed, and was lying--unharmed--several

yards away. I took all eight, and put them under the hen, and after
four days they started to chip. Soon two had " caved in " with the
weight of the hen, and all would doubtless have been crushed, but by
good luck a broody Cochin bantam was procured just in time. This
bantam had only begun to sit some eight hours before, but she reacted
appropriately to the hatching eggs, sitting " lightly " and " talking "
tenderly to the unhatched chicks. Of the eight eggs, five hatched,
and the two somewhat flattened ones--from which, of course, the
chicks could not extricate themselves--I successfully opened at the
correct time. The eighth egg contained a dead chick. The net result
was seven strong and healthy chicks, which, as the well-developed
eggs had been left deserted and cold for some thirty-six hours, was
rather remarkable. The newly hatched chicks were the most
delightful objects, in soft buff and brown down, their rather short and
sturdy legs being dull yellow, spotted with blackish, a rather unusual
colour scheme. I had feared that the chicks might be as hard to
rear as Common Partridges, which are said to be even more difficult
than the pheasants of the Phasianus group. Luckily this was not the
case, and the young Red-legs proved as easy to rear as Golden
Pheasants.
They were kept on the lawn in a pen, which was moved daily. At
first the young Partridges could slip in and out through the one-inch
mesh, and two vanished at this stage, doubtless carried off by some
predator. At about five weeks old the young birds had begun to find
the narrow confines of the pen irksome. They were liable to panic
at a sudden approach (especially if one's lower garments or footwear
was at all unusual)--and spent much time running up and down the
wire. They were then moved to a large aviary (about 20 feet by 40
feet) together with their foster-mother, and within a few days became
exceedingly tame and unafraid. A few weeks later the bantam was
taken away. The Partridges, although for some time they had
appeared to have little regard for her, or she for them, were much
demoralized by her disappearance, and ran about trying to get out,
stopping every few minutes to give the rally call. After a couple of
days, however, they appeared to have quite forgotten her.
In mid-November three of the five became ill, their faces swelled up
and frothy mucous ran from their eyes and nostrils. This would
appear to have been similar to, and probably homologous with, the
eye-disease described by Hastings (1953)* At all events it seemed to
have been due to lack of Vitamin A, and giving the birds halibut oil
speedily cured them. The whole question of feeding I will deal
with later on.
From the fact that three of the birds were noticeably bigger and
heavier than the others, I rightly guessed that they were three cocks
and four hens. I gave away a pair and kept the other five together

in a large aviary, intending to separate them in early spring, when
I expected they would start to form pairs and to quarrel among
themselves.
From February, and increasingly onwards, the Partridges showed
considerable unrest. They ran restlessly up and down the wire,
stopping every few minutes to give the flight-intention call, a throaty
" Tschrech ! Tschrech ! " similar to the alarm call (for ground
predator), often intensifying it to a tern-like " Tschree-ach ! " as they
made the preparatory movements for flying away, and often did in
fact fly up on to some perch or ledge. I saw, indeed, some low
intensity forms of behaviour associated commonly with pairing
display, displacement-feeding, etc., but did not then recognize the
import of such signs. Even by the 8th April, no pairs had
formed, and there had been no fights (wild Red-legs normally pair
in February or the first half of March). With Red-legged Partridge--
as with many other birds--individuals that have been brought up
together do not easily form pairs among themselves. This indecisive
state of affairs continued until about mid-April, when I went away
for four days. During my absence one of those " accidents " such as
so often happen when one leaves one's birds in well-meaning but
incompetent hands occurred. The aviary door was left open, and
all the Partridges (and worse my old cock Jay " P ") escaped, and
were lost, shot in all probability, I fear.
I thought that was the end of my Partridge-keeping, but it was not.
A friend on holiday in Norfolk a month later happened to mention
my loss to a gamekeeper, and the latter very kindly gave him eight
Red-legs' eggs as a gift for me. These were put under a borrowed
bantam hen, and all hatched. Three of the chicks were lost to
predators, but the others throve, including one that was crippled at
an early age owing to a heavy piece of wood falling on it. These
chicks were kept for some time in the moveable pen on the lawn.
Theoretically this should have been better for them, but except
perhaps from a sanitary point of view it was not. At about five weeks
old one or two of the chicks began to get rather wild. This wildness
increased until at about seven weeks all would show some alarm, and
a sudden approach or, more particularly, anything new in my appear-
ance, would set them madly beating at the wire. In desperation
I moved them to a large aviary. It then became evident that their
fears had been aggravated by the lack of cover in the pen on the
open lawn, and the fact of being unable to move to some distance from
the alarming object. At first they ran away whenever I moved in the
aviary, but soon returned to my vicinity. Within three days they
were feeding freely from the hand, and only walking off a short
distance when I moved, and within a week they were extremely
tame, hardly bothering to get out of my way when I walked about.

Resting. c? Feeding $.
In the late autumn I received back the pair of 1950 birds which
I had given away, as their owner was disposing of her game birds.
This pair had always been tame, but were evidently upset by being
caught up and conveyed in a box on the back of a motor-cycle. They
were released together into a large aviary and showed considerable
timidity. Within twenty-four hours the cock had completely retamed,
but his sister remained extremely wild. For several weeks a close
approach would send her crashing madly about. Indeed, in fear of
her injuring herself, I released her, but she returned persistently to
the garden. So I caught her up again and returned her to captivity
after cutting off every other primary and a few secondaries in each
wing. This does not prevent a game bird from flying, but does make
it unlikely to achieve sufficient velocity to injure itself seriously when

it rises in sudden alarm. She gradually became somewhat tamer,
but would never again feed from the hand, and always fled at the
approach of strangers.
After a short time I introduced this pair to the other birds. These
latter received them with the " Who's that ? " "A stranger ! " " Then
chuck a brick at him ! " attitude not uncommon among allegedly
more rational bipeds. The timid hen Partridge, scared of the human
beings present, ran wildly to the far end of the aviary, but her brother
stood his ground. The original inhabitants approached in a stealthy
manner, aggressiveness being obviously tempered by caution. They
went into aggressive display, but the newcomer (hereafter to be
called " P ") was not intimidated, and he displayed back. A fight
soon ensued, the two males pecking at each other's head, and trying
to jump up and beat each other with their legs ; when they failed in
this endeavour--which they usually did--they would seize a billful
of their opponent's neck feathers and tug doggedly. The three females
crowded around displaying, their aggressiveness being evidently not
sufficiently aroused to stimulate them to fight. During a lull in the
battle the lame hen, perhaps overestimating her abilities as we all
so often do, suddenly attacked the strange cock. She soon had cause
to regret her temerity, for he at once counter-attacked. She was
seized, thrown down, and beaten severely, and as soon as she could
tear herself free she fled precipitately into the depths of a rhododendron
bush with all the aggressive drive knocked out of her. Since the two
males " P " and Red--so-called from his ring colour--showed no
signs of ceasing hostilities, and had begun to show signs of exhaustion,
I separated them and shut the former in a small wire pen inside the
aviary, thinking that within a day or two they would have got recon-
ciled to each other's presence. This plan was successful, although
a day's close confinement had an almost too-depressing effect on the
male " P ", who on release showed very mild and timorous behaviour
for some time.
Nothing very interesting happened, or rather was observed, for
some time, except that one night some unknown predator dug in under
the wire and took one of the Partridges, fortunately a hen. At some
trouble and expense wire netting was sunk all round the aviaries to
forestall any repetition of such feats. In late winter, and increasingly
as the days got lighter, the Red-legs showed the same unrest as their
predecessors had done, and likewise gave no signs of pairing. I noticed
that if the male Red started to display, as he often did when
approaching other birds after having been at a distance, " P " would
tend to walk up to him, and sometimes go right up to him and " false-
feed " at his feet. This I suspect was behaviour of an appeasing or
submissive nature, as false-feeding (of which I shall have more to say
later) appears to be essentially a peaceable gesture. I did not then

know the submissive posture, so cannot be sure if " P " showed it
at low intensity on these occasions, but I think it probable that he did.
As by late March no pairing appeared to have taken place, I
decided to try to expedite things. I left Red and one of his sisters--
who was the tamest of all the females--in the original aviary, and
moved " P " and his mate of the previous year (who it will be recalled
was his sister) to another aviary a few yards away, and put the lame
hen in with them. " P," within a few minutes of finding himself
separated from Red, regained all his original self-confidence, and gave
vocal expression to his altered feelings. Red was not slow in answering
his challenges, and for some considerable time thereafter much of
each day was enlivened by the two male Partridges singing against
each other. The song of the Red-legged Partridge, although not
lacking in vigour or persistence, is calculated rather to intimidate
the conspecific rival than to charm the human listener.
After about a week it became quite clear that the male " P " and the
crippled hen had paired. The two birds in the other aviary were,
however, merely carrying on a wholesome platonic friendship, and
had no deeper interest in each other, whilst the timid hen ran un-
ceasingly up and down the wire opposite as if she wished to return to
their aviary. Since it seemed unlikely that Red and his sister would
pair, I put the timid hen in their aviary, and watched events. She
at first fled, terrified at having been handled, but in a few seconds
she came out of cover and made a " dead set " at the male. Within
five minutes they had displayed mutually to each other, copulated,
and prospected a possible nest-site. Her matrimonial ambitions and
status thus having been consolidated the timid hen turned her atten-
tion to her sister-in-law, attacking her with that irresistible, self-
righteous fury that Partridges--like some other bipeds--are apt to
show when they suppose their sexual interests threatened. The victim
showed no resistance, but only extreme fear--in my experience the
usual, though not invariable, reaction of a female Red-leg to actual
physical aggression--fleeing wildly about the aviary, and when
cornered submitting without resistance to the other's attacks. Needless
to say I soon rescued her, feeling a wholly unreasonable aversion for
the timid hen because of her very human-like behaviour in continuing
to ill-treat an unresisting enemy. The rescued bird was placed in
the other aviary. Here the crippled hen, as " lawful wife " of the
male, received her in a similar spirit, but owing to her physical dis-
ability, was unable to translate her feelings into effective action.
After a few days she began to tolerate her rival, and soon they settled
down to a " menage a trois " with at least no overt signs of hostility.
It seems tolerably certain that such a trio could never form or hold
together in a wild state.
The hen of the pair by themselves soon started to lay. The cock

had already made two nests, one under some brushwood in a corner,
and one under the edge of a rhododendron bush. The first egg was
deposited in the latter, but to my surprise no more appeared in the
next few days. I could see no other nest from a casual inspection,
but when some ten days or so later I made a thorough search, I found
a nest with eight eggs well hidden on the ground in the middle of the
small rhododendron bush. Doubtless the first nest had been deserted
owing to my paying too much attention to it.
When this nest contained nineteen eggs--which were laid at the rate
of about four per week, but I regret I kept no exact count--the cock
scraped out a fresh nest in a far corner under some conifer branches.
The hen then continued laying in this second nest until eighteen eggs
had been deposited in it. I began to fear that the birds did not intend
to sit, but a few mornings after laying her last egg, I found the hen on
the second nest. That day the cock bird showed a remarkable pro-
gressive change in behaviour, becoming hourly more silent and self-
effacing. His air of aggressive masculinity changed in twelve hours to
one of cowed and conscience-stricken femininity. Next day he com-
menced to incubate on the first nest.
That night there was heavy rain, and both Partridges came off
the nest at dawn, and three hours later showed no signs of returning.
I feared they had deserted, but about 11 a.m. both went back on their
respective nests. At first they came off each morning and evening
for some ten to twenty minutes or more, but as incubation progressed
the off-duty spells became shorter, and the evening one dropped out.
For the last four days I saw neither bird off the nest at all, and am
fairly certain they did not come off. I had left them each about a
dozen eggs, but some did not hatch, and were found on examination
to have small " hair-cracks " in them. Possibly the Lanceolated
Jays in the same aviary had pecked inquisitively at them, though
they had not actually broken any. When the first of the twenty chicks
that did hatch poked its head from under the mother, the lame hen
Jay at once hopped up, seized and flew away with it. The Partridge
did not seem to grasp the significance of this incident, and showed
no signs of resentment. I was in a quandary since the Jays were then
(mid July) in full moult, and the last thing I wished to do was to
handle them. With acumen rare to me, I thought of the solution,
cut a large hole in the side of the aviary and another in that of one
near by, connected the two with a wire funnel, and easily drove the
Jays into exile.
When the young Partridges were led from the nest it became
abundantly clear that their parents had no interest in each other, but
were solely concerned with the young. They did not quarrel, but
the male would give his note of protest if the female came near when
he was brooding. Owing to the chicks not distinguishing father

from mother, the broods were often unequally divided, and one saw
the ludicrous spectacle of one parent uncomfortably brooding sixteen
or seventeen, whilst the other had only one or two chicks beneath it.
Adult Brooding Month-old Chicks.
As with other game birds, the parent Red-leg reacts violently
to the sound of a chick in distress or to the sight of some innately
recognized enemy, but it is a case of " out of sound, out of mind ".
So long as there are no overt reminders of the rest of the family, it is
quite " happy " with even a single chick. Stupid though this behaviour
may seem to the minds of animals capable of conceiving the Atomic
Bomb and the Inquisition, it is, nevertheless, obviously adaptive.
When irrevocable disaster has overtaken the majority of the brood it
is clearly of great biological advantage that the parent should be able
to concern itself wholeheartedly with the welfare of the survivors,
instead of vainly fretting over the dead which no power on earth can
bring to life again.
After the first week the chicks' mobility increased ; they were
constantly roaming the whole aviary, and had learnt that my appear-
ance meant food. Their timid mother usually ran to the far end of
the aviary, especially if any stranger appeared, and tried to call the
chicks away. They, however, soon learned to ignore her under these
circumstances, and would come running up to me with their father,
who was perfectly tame.
More surprising than the chicks failing to be influenced by their
mother's wildness was her lack of response to their tameness. Two
of the chicks died when three weeks old, but the remaining seventeen
were reared. Despite the fact that she was now in company of eighteen
other Red-legs, all of whom were extremely tame, the old hen still
remained wild. It is often thought that birds are greatly influenced
by the behaviour of their companions, but in my experience this is
usually only so if they have no " preconceived ideas " on the object
evoking their companion's behaviour. A bird that is afraid of a person

seldom shows any less fear because a fellow-captive greets his appear-
ance with eagerness. Nor, on the other hand, does a tame bird often
become wild if associated with a timid comrade.
When moulted out into their adult plumage the seventeen young
Partridges made a delightful picture. They were very tame, and
some of them would even perch on my arms and shoulders to be fed.
The food bill was, however, considerable, and I had not sufficient
space, so I reluctantly decided to part with the majority. I thought
that the best chance of their getting to good homes was to give them
away. In this I may have been wrong, as many people value more
something they have paid a high price for than something that has
cost little or nothing. Accordingly, I put a note to the effect that
I had some Red-legs to spare in our Magazine. The result was over-
whelming, and I was not able to reply to all the letters I received,
though I read them all more than once. Finally, the spare birds were
all sent off to their new homes with sundry members of the Avicultural
Society. One of the latter neither acknowledged receipt of the birds
nor--in spite of repeated requests--did he ever return my travelling-
cage to me. The four other members sent me nice letters of thanks,
and promised to let me know how the birds fared. None of them
did so and when, a year later, I made inquiries I learned that in two
cases the birds had been killed by stoats or foxes. The other two did
not bother to reply at all to my letters, so I rather fear their Partridges
had also come to grief by some accident, or else been sold or eaten !
The " trio " of Red-legs in the other aviary laid three nests of eggs.
Both hens laid in the same nest. The impulse to lay in a nest already
containing an egg or eggs, rather than an empty one, is very strong
in game birds, and has of course long been utilized by keepers of
domestic fowls to induce their birds to lay in nest-boxes where the eggs
can be gathered. In a wild state this impulse is biologically useful,
since it ensures that the bird will lay her later eggs in the same place
as the first and not in one of the innumerable other sites that are
in other respects just as good ". Like many other innate impulses--
and not only those of the class Aves, this one can prove harmful where
man has altered the natural state of things. If the gravid female game
bird finds a nest already containing eggs, she will lay in it rather than
make one for herself elsewhere. This happens very rarely where wild
game birds are at a normal density, but often in areas where game-
preservation holds sway. Everyone knows how common an occurrence
are nests containing the eggs of two or more females--often of different
species--in English game preserves. In the case of the captive Red-legs
the fact that the male usually takes the initiative in selecting the nest
site also probably affected the issue, since the male scratches out
another nest, to which he calls the female when the first is full
of eggs.

In this aviary only one female (the sound one) incubated, on the
last of the three nests. Unfortunately, she became ill and died quite
suddenly after sitting for twelve days. Neither the male nor the
crippled female went broody. I thought at the time the male's failure
to do so was because the female was still with him, but later observa-
tions changed my opinion. I now suspect that his failure to incubate
(which he has shown also in 1953) is due to the fact that incubation
in the male is accompanied by a psychological change to a furtive and
non-aggressive mood. This would presumably be more " difficult "
for an individual whose aggressive drive is extremely strong, as is the
case with this male. Of course it is probable that some factors of
captive life may also tend to inhibit incubation.
Having given away my surplus Partridges, I still retained six birds,
thinking this an ample number for future study in view of my restricted
time, space, and money. Unfortunately various disasters happened,
culminating in an infestation of gapes that wiped out in 1953 all the
remaining birds, except the two old males and two juveniles, one of
which latter subsequently escaped and was lost. I am now left with
three males, and all efforts to purchase some tame females have proved
unavailing.
Some notes on the care of these birds may prove of interest.
Food.
I have found that Red-legs do well on a diet of grain (wheat and/or
millet), with a little bread and milk (to which bemax and glucodin
are added) about twice a week. This can be varied with dry whole-
meal bread, and a few peanuts or small bits of cheese given by hand
frequently, will help to keep the birds tame. Plenty of fresh green food
is important. No matter how well fed otherwise Partridges like to eat
quantities of green food. Cabbages and lettuces, especially such as
have run to seed, brussels sprouts, etc., are all acceptable, but par-
ticularly fresh turves of grass and clover. From a turf they can pluck
the grass-blades, clover leaves, seeding weed-heads, and so forth, in a
natural manner, but such things as lettuces must be firmly tied or
fixed between two bricks so the birds can peck at them. When breeding
the hens especially often relish beetles, mealworms, and other insects,
though in general they care little for them once adult. Probably if
the diet were otherwise poor in protein they would eat them at all
times. In the domestic fowl and Golden Pheasant the inclination to
eat earthworms--which is usually only shown by growing young and
laying females--can be stimulated by putting them on a low-protein
diet. If the floor of the aviary is covered in parts to a depth of several
inches with leaf-mould or similar litter, and millet thrown into this, the
birds will take a lot of exercise scratching for the seed.
I expect any regime on which young pheasants are successfully

reared would suit young Red-legs. If mine are being reared by a
bantam, I place them on the lawn in a pen, which is moved daily.
If they can be obtained, I feed largely on the cocoons and grubs of the
small ants (one reddish and one black) whose earth-heap nests are
common in fields and roadside grass strips. The chicks also eat the
winged male and queen ants, and sometimes--with less avidity--the
workers also. In addition to this I give milk-sop to which a little
bemax and glucodin has been added, a few mealworms or mealworm
pupae, and any other small insects that come to hand. After a week
or two I add a little seed to the diet, and gradually get them on to the
same diet as the adults. Growing young may be given the cocoons of
the large wood-ant, but I do not like these for baby chicks as the
fiercely fighting worker ants might do them some harm in the early
stages.
At first the chicks are ravenously fond of mealworms, but in every
brood I have reared they have " lost the taste " for them between
four and six weeks of age, although still continuing to eat ant cocoons,
cheese, broken peanuts, and other rich but non-motile food. When the
Partridge chicks are reared by their own parents the same regime will
suffice. So long as they are getting plenty of ant pupae and green food,
they take no harm from eating a certain amount of grain from an
early age. Grit, clean water, and dust-bathing facilities must, of
course, be provided for both young and old.
Diseases.
My first brood of Red-legs developed swollen faces, with running
eyes and noses, in late November. This would appear to have been a
form of Xerothalmia, or something akin to it (Hastings, 1953). The
birds were quickly cured by giving each a few peanuts slightly coated
with halibut liver oil daily until they improved. Since then I have
given my Partridges a feed of grain treated with halibut oil, about
once a week from October to May and have had no further trouble.
Gape-worm infestation, as I have narrated, wiped out most of my
Partridges in 1953. The adding of T.C.P., permanganate of potash,
and so forth to the drinking water has, in my experience, proved
futile. Mechanical removal of gapeworms although often successful
with Jays, proved no use with the Partridges. I have since found
Barintar--a powder manufactured and sold by I.C.I.--effective in
curing afflicted Jays, and hope that it will prove equally so for
Partridges if mine are so unlucky as to be again attacked with this
scourge. I may say that I found Aniodol Interne had no apparent
adverse effect on gapeworms in Jays and Partridges. This is strange
when so many members appear to have found it a certain cure for
gapeworms in Starlings. Gapeworms are said to be often picked up
through eating insects or worms that contain their eggs. This seems

likely to have been the case with my Partridges where the two laying
females, and most of the young were infected, but not the two non-
insectivorous adult males. Where young Partridges are reared by
their own parents in aviaries, where the ground and its insect life are
likely to be infected with gape-worm eggs, it is probable that the
method suggested by Wilford Smith (1947) would prove a remedy.
This consisted of thickly covering the floor of the aviary with dead
bracken, so that the chicks did not come into contact with the earth.
Pros and Cons.
As aviary birds Red-legs can be recommended for their beauty,
tameness (in most cases), and the ease with which they can be kept
and bred. They are not, however, suitable for small aviaries. On the
regime often accorded to gallinaceous birds in public aviaries (whose
proprietors are sometimes, I suspect, in league with anti-bird-keeping
circles) of corn ad lib and a lump of stale cabbage once a week, they
most certainly will soon cease to be of any beauty or interest.
Their faults are those common to most largish ground birds. They
foul the ground considerably (removing the droppings from and/or
liming the roosting places will help to obviate this), and may cause
considerable disturbance if they panic at night. Although not usually
aggressive to weaker birds, they may be so at times, birds with young,
and males in breeding condition whose aggressive drive is very strong,
being the most likely offenders in this respect.
Voice and Display.
I shall only briefly mention these, as I have dealt rather fully
with them in a recent paper (Goodwin, 1953) elsewhere, to which
readers are referred. Einbeck (1834) also mentions this subject, and
gives many interesting details about his captive specimens.
The most familiar note is the " rally call "--the loud, rather harsh
" Chuk, chuk, chukuk, chukar ! " This is used to indicate the bird's
whereabouts to its young, mate, or companions when, for any reason,
it has become separated from them. In spring the male utters a loud
harsh rhythmical " song " which suggests a laboured steam-engine.
At a little distance it is hard to believe that a bird, and not a loco-
motive, is responsible. These two calls are loud and far carrying, but
the bird also utters a great many other notes, most of which are rather
quiet, and hence not often known to sportsmen and others who are
only familiar with the species at gun-shot range or further.
The commonest display is one in which the bird draws back its
uplifted head at the same time " twisting round " the face and neck
markings in a peculiar manner, so that they are displayed almost fully
to one side. The barred flank feathers come up high over the wing
on the " displaying side ". The other wing is often drooped, so that

the primaries drag the ground. This display is primarily threatening,
but it is shown between male and female--interspersed with food-
calling and other appeasing gestures--during pair-formation. When
feeling " inferior " and wishing to avoid fighting, a bird usually
responds to any signs of aggressiveness by walking in a somewhat
crouching " guilty-looking " posture. At a highter intensity of this
feeling it will raise one or both wings above the line of the back, and
at the same time spread out the primaries. In this movement the
yellow-buff on the outer ends of the primaries and some of the
secondaries become much more conspicuous than when the wing is
folded normally.

By A. A. Clarence (Nunton, Nr. Salisbury, Wilts, England)
I have long been impressed by the loneliness of single birds and the
friendships that ensue. Also by the cruelty of birds to their kind.
Among them the Orange-headed Ground Thrush is a good example.
He seems to reserve his spleen for the hens of his own race. For the
last three years I have had a pair of these birds in a 40-foot aviary.
On Christmas Day the cock slew his hen with evident pleasure, and left
her corpse without feather on head, neck, and back.
I arrived on the scene just after he had committed the murder,
and found him perched above preening his feathers, and obviously
saying "well, good-bye to all that". Possibly the reason for his action
was that for two seasons he had carefully built perfect nests which had
been ignored by the hen. Last spring he built two, one of them in
a circular tin about 8 inches in diameter and 2 inches high. This tin
was used for seed and is fixed to the top of a 4-foot drainpipe with a
hood over it against rain.
After some weeks of waiting, a Brown-eared Bulbul decided that
it was her s for the taking and took possession. She laid three eggs of
a beautiful mottled strawberry tint, which were inspected daily by the
Orange-head. He would stand on the edge of the tin, and look at the

little hen with his head cocked on one side with an expression of
astonishment which clearly indicated " well I'm hanged ! ". She
would look back at him and chatter in a most friendly way.
After nearly three weeks she gave up trying to hatch infertile eggs,
to my disappointment and that of her spouse. A Red-vented Bulbul
immediately took over the nest and added one solitary egg to the
clutch. The Orange-head took no interest whatever in her or her
doings, even when, in due course, the chick was hatched.
For no particular reason this baby was called " Georgie " and now
George or Georgina whichever sex it is, is flying strong and full grown
with its parents, and three other brothers and sisters of the previous
year's hatch. The year before that the old pair had two young ones,
both of which they killed, as soon as they were full grown, which all
goes to show how sweet they are.
With regard to curious friendships, a pair of Canary-winged Parrakeets
also inhabit this aviary. In the spring I introduced a Golden-crowned
Conure cock. Immediately the hen Canary-wing left her husband,
and became the inseparable companion of the Conure, who likewise
is devoted to her. The Canary-wing is very tame and flies to my
shoulder as soon as I enter the aviary. The Conure eventually over-
came his fear and now sits on the other shoulder, but is off at the
smallest sign of intimacy on my part. I have to keep an eye on him,
as he would like to bite my ear hard, and has done so once or twice.
No doubt he thinks he is getting his own back for past grievances.
Unexpected things happen in aviculture, as we all know. The most
interesting in my experience happened last summer and concerned a
pair of Cockatiels. These birds had a second nest. The eggs were about
to hatch when the hen became ill and died. In the aviary with the
parents were four young Cockatiels from the first nest, which they had
left about six weeks before.
I was lamenting the loss of the hen, and had just removed her warm
corpse from the corner into which she had fallen, when to my astonish-
ment one of her daughters, showing concern, flew to the nest and
inspected the contents. She did this several times and within half
an hour was in the box sitting on the four eggs, all of which she
hatched in the next few days and brought up successfully.
Although I watched carefully, I could never decide if any of the
other children helped to feed their younger brothers and sisters.
I think not, judging by their bibs, which were always clean whereas
the little foster-mother became wet-bibbed and bedraggled.

By Frances E. Matthews (Cranleigh, Surrey, England)
I have been asked to give a few particulars about my foreign birds.
Some years ago they were housed in aviaries, and then there was much
moi e of intei est to tell about them. Owing to the changeable seasons,
the birds now in great request are the species which can stand up to
all rapid changes of temperature. The birds I have now are all
indoors in a laige room. This gets all the sun and the windows can
open without draught.
I have Violet-ears, Red-headed Gouldians, Cordon Bleus, and Zebra
Finches--all in large cages.
The pair of Violet-ears have been very busy making their nest.
They aie very tame. The nest is made from plaited rushes. It is
cone-like in shape and now it is filled with grass. I find these birds
very attractive. They never quarrel ! Both birds can sing before it is
daylight ! The cock's note is like that of the Reed Warbler. The hen
in her nest joins in " to cheer him up " !
Presently the cock calls her out for their morning drill. This consists
of a very graceful type of flying--in which each bird takes part--each
bird rising and bending as they fly across the cage. But they time it
so that they never touch. I think this exercise is unique and interesting.
The Gouldians, two pairs, are not as energetic as the Violet-ears.
One pair inhabits an indoor aviary, on the lines of the one illustrated
in Mr. D. H. Risdon's book, which I think is very good. The birds
enjoy ample space and sunshine. They have a good box nest which
they are preparing. In the same enclosure are a small pair of Cordon
Bleus in a rush nest at the other end. The four birds get on well,
though the Cordons are not allowed to know which nest they may be
allowed to occupy !
Last year, in another place, the Cordon hen laid two eggs but they
were not hatched as the birds were disturbed. The second pair of
Gouldians, though they have filled their large nest-box with grass, don't
seem anxious to nest. Two pairs of Zebra Finches, in separate cages,
spend their time talking and making a lot of noise, filling their nest
with grass and removing it. It delights them to make a noise. They
can do this when they make a root of grass really hard and then drop
it. If the hen lays eggs she disregards them. The cock thinks otherwise.
Now I must tell you about Julie, our African Grey Parrot. She lives
by herself, and is very strong and not afraid of cold. Her voice can be
heard very early, when she hears my daughter moving about. Polly
lets her know she is alive. She is told she is " making too much noise
and must wait ". Her loneliness must find expression, however, and
her want to be uncovered is attended to. The seed first, then the bread

She knows my step and connects it with one or two grapes.
My daughter speaks to me in my room (Polly's hearing is very
good) so she joins in the conversation, and says " Yes mother " !
She does not talk when she comes to my room and climbs up on my
knee to be stroked, but it is difficult to persuade her to go back to her
cage. I think one of her best remarks was when told that " The
gardener might be late coming to clean her cage . Julie said,
" What a shame ! ".

By the death, at the ripe age of 93, of George Edward Lodge, the
world has lost one of the greatest bird artists of all times, for his
paintings of birds and of their natural surroundings were not excelled
by any.
Lodge was perhaps primarily interested in the birds of prey, of
which he was an authority, and his pictures of these are amongst his
best known. He had, in his younger days, done a great deal of falconry
and the falcons were his great favourites, though the game birds
ran them closely. He dearly loved the Highlands, and his pictures of
grouse and ptarmigan, with perhaps a falcon attacking them, are
amongst his finest works. When he took a holiday it was generally
to visit his Scottish friends who were always glad to have him in their
shooting or stalking parties, for he was an excellent shot. But his
travels were not confined to the British Isles 5 he had visited the
United States, West Indies and Scandinavia in his studies of birds
and beasts.
As well as being an artist, Lodge was a very keen naturalist, and il
was always a delight to talk with him on birds and other British
creatures, for he knew them all and had studied their minutest habits
I have known him well for the past half century, our first meetings
being at the Ornithologists' Club, when those early meetings werejj
held in Frascati's Restaurant in Oxford Street. I have talked with
him and admired his work in his studio in South Kensington, when
a lot of his pictures were made, and later when he had retired to
Camberley. Well do I remember (it must be close on fifty years ago
when the Zoo had acquired a fine Lesser Bird of Paradise which wa:
housed in the old Insect House on the north bank of the canal. Fev
had, up to that time, seen the full display of this species, but we hearc
that this bird was beginning to show off in the early mornings. Ogilvie
Grant, of the British Museum, was anxious that Lodge should mak&lt;
sketches of the display, so Grant, Lodge, and myself arranged to mee

there at eight o'clock on a given morning. It was a bright morning,
perhaps too bright for the bird's liking, for he refused to display,
though Lodge was able to obtain sketches of various attitudes.
Lodge's pictures have been reproduced in most of the best ornitho-
logical books of the last half century or more, and they are particularly
pleasing as being both excellent drawings of the birds themselves
and beautiful pictures of their surroundings, whether woodlands,
lakes, or mountains. His latest work, only completed shortly before
his death, has been the illustration of David Bannerman's Birds of the
British Isles , a colossal undertaking for which he painted no less
than 435 species comprised in 377 plates. These depict not only the
well-known species, but the occasional immigrants that have obtained
a place on the British List. He only wrote one book himself, Memoirs
of an Artist Naturalist , an excellent book containing a number of his
pictures, both in colour and monochrome, though the reproduction
in some cases is not quite up to the mark.
When I saw him last in his house in Camberley he had grown a
beard which well suited his handsome face. He had practically lost
the sight of one eye, but could still paint as well as ever, though he
told me that it took him much longer than formerly, and to put in
a bird's eye which formerly took but a few minutes, now took the
best part of half an hour.
His house was quite a museum as well as a gallery of pictures,
wings, tails, and skeletons of birds to show the arrangement of the
feathers, the joints, and so on, for as he said, the bird artist has to
know precisely how every feather lies and the exact position of every
joint. He was also a skilled taxidermist.
George Lodge was a younger son of Canon Samuel Lodge, Rector
of Scrivelsby, iri Lincolnshire, and cousin of the late Sir Oliver Lodge.
He never married, his sister keeping house for him until a few years
ago, when she died. Archibald Thorburn, that other great bird
artist, who died several years ago, was one of Lodge s great friends.
Now both are gone, the last of the Old School of Bird Painters. Will
the younger generation produce any quite so good ?

By J. M. Spence (Cape Town, S. Africa)
On gth February I was given a Cape Robin (Caffrornis caffra caffra ).
I have had them many times before, but had never succeeded in
keeping them very long as we are unable to get prepared food for
softbills, and no one could tell me much about them. To cut a long
story short I tried him on egg and biscuit (one mashed egg to two
biscuits) ; it worked and he thrived on it and gradually I enlarged his
diet (boiled potato, fish meal, bread and milk, grated carrot and
cheese). The general colour of the bird is dark grey with a rusty-
coloured breast and tail and it has a white eye-strip. The most
attractive thing about these birds is that they are forever flicking their
tails, to show the two dark feathers in the middle. They are mainly
terrestrial in habits although they spend much of their time in low
bushes searching for insects.
On 21 st February I turned my bird into one of my aviaries, 18 feet
by 11 feet by 8 feet high, containing about sixty other birds of various
kinds, including some Sunbirds.
I obtained a hen on 22nd February. She was meated-off in the
birdioom for a week and then turned into the aviary with the cock.
This paii got along quite agreeably as long as the hen kept a respectful
distance, but at times he would chase her round quite unmercifully.
I have, incidentally, had cocks which would tolerate neither cocks nor
hens and if the bird was not removed in time a particularly horrible
death was liable to follow.
I got another pair on 12th April and turned them into a smaller
aviary, 10 feet by 6 feet by 8 feet high. This pair as it happened got on
very well together. They were housed with a pair of Cape Bulbuls and
three Bokmakieries (Telophorus zeylonus zeylonus). There was no trouble
and all went well until the 22 nd April when one of the hens died
quite suddenly, but I was given another on 19th May.
As the summer got closer the cocks started to show signs of wanting
to mate, and on 13th August the cock in the big aviary suddenly
grabbed the hen and before anything could be done she was dead
with a broken neck.
On 29th September the cock in the smaller aviary was noticed to
be having trouble with his eyes. He was caught up and treated with
bicarbonate of soda solution and Vaseline E.T.C., but of no avail *
he died on 5th October.
I then introduced the remaining cock to the hen and on 26th October
I suspected them to be nesting, as I could only see one of them at a
time, so they were left severely alone.
After a few days I noticed that the bread and milk was disappearing

faster than usual. They had the same diet previously described, and no
live food whatsoever because I was afraid a sudden change of diet
might affect them adversely.
On Thursday, 12th November, I saw a youngster running amongst
the long grass in the aviary, and on the 13th I found it dead near the
door.
Then on Sunday the 15th when I opened the door to feed the birds
there on a perch straight in front of me was a second youngster, this
time very far advanced, in fact so much so that before I knew what had
happened it flew past me into the garden. I managed to catch it again
and it was returned to its aviary within an hour. On the Monday
evening I had to remove the cock because he was constantly chasing
the youngster round and round the aviary.
The youngster was somewhat smaller than its parents, and the body
was grey-brown, streaked with black. The tail was the exact copy of
its parents except that it was shorter.
On 27th November the hen had sore eyes, so I put her into the
birdroom and tried to cure her eyes but of no avail; she died on 13th
December. Incidentally, this eye disease is a queer thing, the lids of the
eye go hard with some secretion from the eyeball. It looks very much
like pus from a festered sore, so that when the eye is closed the bird is
unable to open it and also when opened it is unable to close it. When,
and if, you are able to stop the secretion of the fluid by constantly
washing with bicarbonate of soda and boracic solution then the
feathers round the eyes and beak start to come away, until finally the
eyes start watering again and the bird just wastes away. I have been
unable to cure this disease and would be glad to hear if any fellow
members have come across the same thing, or could recommend some
cure, or better still some preventive. At the time of writing I am
battling to save the two remaining Robins from the same horrible and
slow death. I have managed to stop the eyes secreting the liquid by
using a powerful solution of boracic acid powder.
I am sorry that I am unable to give more detail as to the colour,
size, and shape of the eggs, period of incubation, growth and feeding
of the offspring but as I say I was loth to interfere with their nesting
activities in any way in case they deserted the nest.
The only thing I was able to get any information on was the nest :
it was (internal measurements) three inches in diameter and one and
a half to two inches deep, and constructed of rootlets, coir, feathers,
and hair in the form of a cup. The nest was well placed as far as
protection from the weather was concerned because it was placed
under a tuft of long grass which in turn was under a Pittosporum tree
about four feet high.
As far as I can deduce from studying their nesting habits in the wild

MR. RUDKIN, Sr., CARRIES ON AT 92 !
By Carl Naether (Sherman Oaks, Calif., U.S.A.)
One of California's ablest and most successful aviculturists, Francis
H. Rudkin, Sr., is to-day making active plans for the 1954 breeding
season. Though 92 years old, this indefatigable birdlover is remodelling
some of his aviaries at his cosy citrus ranch in Fillmore, California,
for more convenient and effective birdkeeping.
Almost ever since the vear 1912, when the Rudkin family forsook
their homeland, England, to build a new home and a new life among
strange surroundings and people in California, birds of various kinds
have been in the minds and hearts of both Mr. and Mrs. Rudkin, Sr.
Their special attention for years has been devoted to the breeding
of parrot-like birds, in which phase of aviculture they have been
eminently successful.
Since the passing of his wife, Mr. Rudkin, Sr. has carried on his
great hobby with double devotion. Perhaps the most fruitful results
of his labours in the field of aviculture are not the raising of many
and often rare parrot-like birds in the numerous aviaries he keeps
going year in and year out, but the encouragement, the inspiration,
and the helpful advice he has been giving all these many years to
the visitors who almost daily throng his home-place to view his birds
and to catch some of this great man's enthusiasm for his feathered
friends. Unquestionably, Francis H. Rudkin, Sr., has the satisfaction
of having been responsible for starting many men and women on the
long road to successful birdkeeping. Always genial, always eager to
help solve a bird problem, he has given unstintingly of his time and
effort every day in the year, including Sunday, to furthering the
most constructive and wholesome interests of aviculture. Not only
grown-ups have thus benefited from association with this eminent
bird fancier, but youngsters of all ages, brought by their elders or
teachers in small and large groups to view the Rudkin bird collection,
have been thrilled by the colourful display of so many and so varied
species of parrots, cockatoos, cockatiels, parrakeets, lovebirds, and
other showy feathered creatures. And all of them, youngsters as well
as grown-ups, have taken away with them not only the memory of
beautiful birds, happy in their spacious surroundings, but of a man's
loyal devotion to their everyday welfare and their happiness. Though
Francis H. Rudkin, Sr., keeps hundreds of birds, as he takes his visitors

from aviary to aviary, he spiritedly relates stories of what this bird
or that biid has done, or has not done, thus keeping his visitors on the
alert during every joyous moment of their visit. If he had made
written note of the innumerable questions he has been asked about
the care and breeding of parrotlike birds--and has valiantly
endeavoured to answer fully and satisfactorily--they would indeed fill
a very sizeable volume.
This modest tribute to a great and venerable aviculturist is written
in the hope that it will in some measure inspire other birdlovers to
follow his fine example. It is one thing to keep birds for one's very
own pleasure and self-satisfaction ; it is quite another thing to ride
one s hobby successfully and at the same time share its successes and
its joys with like-minded men and women, not only in one's immediate
neighbourhood, not only in one's state or even country, but even
abroad as Mr. Rudkin has demonstrated for so many years to so
many people.
In closing, I am confident that the members of the Avicultural

By Roland W. Hawkins (Pittsburgh, Penn., U.S.A.)
Down through the ages mankind has derived endless hours of
pleasure from keeping birds as pets. Some species are valued for their
songs or ability to mimic the human voice, and others for their
beautiful plumage. To-day there are many bird fanciers whose entire
enthusiasm and interest in birds is directed towards breeding certain
species to obtain purer strains and specific colour patterns. The
methods of keeping birds has unfortunately shown little imagination
and the conventional types of cages constructed of wood or metal
having either screen, wire, or glass sides does little to promote the
happiness of its inmates. Of all the animal kingdom, birds, due to their
powers of flight, are perhaps the most freedom-loving creatures on the
face of the earth. To capture and confine them within the cages as we
know them to-day produces results that are all too apparent in the
birds condition. Certain species that have been domesticated by man,
such as the canary, thrive and appear perfectly happy within the
confines of a small cage. A great many of the larger public and private
aviaries where collections of local and foreign birds are housed, consist
of row after row of cages containing nothing more than perches, food,

and water vessels. Regardless of how well the birds are cared for, they
cannot reflect happiness in such an environment, for it is nothing more
than a jail bearing with it a sentence for life-time solitary confinement.
In recent years there has been a decided trend towards larger flight
cages containing running water and some plant life. This is a highly
commendable improvement as the birds have more area to exercise
and do not feel so badly shut in.
In keeping with the progressive march of the City of Pittsburgh is
the new Conservatory-Aviary located in West Park on the city's North
Side. Here is a success story of a building unique in design and
principle, where the method of exhibiting birds in captivity has entered
upon a new era that makes the old-fashioned cage methods seem
completely antiquated.
In two large glass-domed conservatory rooms constructed of steel
and aluminium, tropical birds and plants thrive in complete harmony.
Without the intervention of physical barriers of screen, wire, or glass,
visitors are permitted to walk in the rooms with the birds and plants,
to see and study them in a natural environment. The many species of
lush tropical plants, including bamboo, rubber trees, avocado, papaya,
coffee, mango, and various palms, etc., along with a myriad of interest-
ing smaller plants sets the stage for the many species of tropical birds
selected for their beauty, character, and song. A running stream,
complete with cascading waterfalls and pools, adds natural beauty as
well as providing a home for numerous species of fish, aquatic fresh-
water animals and water plants. It does not require an experienced
eye to see that the birds are completely happy in this environment,
a condition easy to judge through their actions and appearance.
Sleek in their full plumage they are active bright-eyed birds reflecting
their boundless energy and health with their songs and calls, echoing
and re-echoing throughout the rooms. Where the species are repre-
sented by both male and female birds, breeding and nesting activities
have been carried out successfully within the rooms. When birds
mate, build nests, and rear young it seems right to assume they are not
feeling remorseful at being held in confinement.
The overwhelming success of this new combination Conservatory-
Aviary will undoubtedly stimulate interest in vivariums throughout
the world. Now it has been conclusively proved that birds, plants,
flowers, and fish will all thrive and propagate themselves under the
same glass roof, aviaries and conservatories can unite and present
a continuous cultural showplace of far-reaching educational values to
young and old alike.
There were a few sceptical critics who believed a venture of this type
would be doomed to failure from the beginning, their reasoning being
that the birds would destroy the plant life and mess up the exhibit
areas to such an extent it would become unsightly. The rule of success

governing this problem was through the control of population, both
as to numbers and to species. Birds known for their destructive ten-
dencies towards succulent plants were either omitted from the rooms
entirely, or represented by a few individuals. By controlling the
population in this way, plant destruction is of no significance. Once
established the plant life grows so profusely it has to be cut back from
time to time, otherwise it would completely take over the rooms.
Insect pests pose a more serious problem as poisonous insecticides
cannot be used, being fatally disastrous to the birds. The insectivorous
birds keep the plants clean of mealy bugs and aphid, but the scale
insects have to be controlled manually. The foliage is kept clean by
the morning and afternoon syringing of the plants and any bird
droppings that may have spotted the leaves washes off readily.
With no need for far-reaching vision it is now possible to predict
the progress of new aviaries in the future. Large conservatory-type
structures will be built and planned along ecological lines by scientists
representing all the fields of our natural sciences. Together they will be
able to plan authentic ecological controlled rooms, of the various life
zones, complete with the dominant plants and birds endemic of the
different areas chosen. These displays will undoubtedly take the place
of existing bird and plant exhibits as we know them in our zoological
gardens, aviaries, and museums of to-day. In such buildings, where
birds and plants can be kept under continuous surveillance, ecological
studies of their inter-relationship will advance rapidly. The educational
and scientific prospects for such buildings will have tremendous
influence on the studies of natural history in the future.
Few people have an opportunity during their lifetime to visit
tropical countries, where in their leisure hours, they can make trips into
remote areas to observe and study the flora and fauna. With such
buildings as the Conservatory-Aviary within the limits of our modern
cities, many of the most interesting exotic birds and plants can be
studied in comparative comfort, without being subjected to the rigours
of tropical exploration. Jungle entanglements, biting insects, poisonous
snakes, are far away when one enjoys the thrill of watching a flame-
coloured " Cock of the Rock 33 fly from tree to tree in the new Con-
servatory-Aviary. Toucans with their large colourful bills, the piercing
calls of the Naked-throated Bell Birds, the pendulum tail movements
of the Motmot, the cordial greeting of the Javan Hill Mynah are
but a few of the many interesting and colourful tropical birds you will
encounter. Many visitors are thrilled to see how bananas grow while
others are amazed at the phenomenal growth rate of the bamboo shoots,
growing twelve inches a day. Flora and fauna, the combination of
the two makes an impressive exhibition.
Although many of us have dreamed of such a place the credit for
seeing these dreams realized belongs to Mr. Howard B. Stewart,

In response to numerous requests it has been decided to launch an
appeal for funds for a Memorial to the late Duke&amp;apos; of Bedford. The
memorial will take the form of an aviary to be erected in the Zoological
Gardens at Regent's Park, London, where the Zoological Society
will maintain a collection of homing Budgerigars at semi-liberty. In
addition, it is proposed to provide a Challenge Cup to be known as
the " Duke of Bedford Memorial Trophy " for the best Parrot-like
bird, to be competed for annually at the National Cage Bird Exhibi-
tion. The appeal committee consists of Mr. Alfred Ezra, President of
the Avicultural Society, Miss E. Maud Knobel, Messrs. E. J. Boosey,
B. H. Dulanty, S. Porter, A. A. Prestwich, D. Seth-Smith, J. J. Yealland,
and R. C. J. Sawyer (Hon. Treasurer).
The Council of the Avicultural Society have decided to give the
appeal every support, and it is hoped members of the Society will send
donations, however small, to the fund for a Memorial to this great
aviculturist, to whom aviculture in general and the Society in
particular, owe so much.
Cheques, postal orders, etc., should be sent to :--

BIRD-RINGING. The Art of Bird Study by Individual Marking.
By R. M. Lockley and Rosemary Russell. Messrs. Crosby
Lockwood and Son, Ltd., London. 1953. Price 9 d. 6 d. net.
This is an attractively presented little book, and contains chapters
on " The History of Bird Ringing ", " The Value of Bird Ringing ",
" The Technique of Bird Ringing ", " Trapping Birds and Rings ",
and " Records and Field Equipment ". It is written in an interesting
and readable style, but it is unfortunate that the authors have not
been more careful in checking their dates and other precise informa-
tion. On page 6, for instance, the establishment of the Royal
Hungarian Central Bureau for Ornithology is given as 1903, whereas
this should have been 1908, and the date of the establishment of the
Heligoland station as 1904 instead of 1909. Further, on the same
page, reference is made to work done in Spain which is no doubt a
mistake for work done in Portugal, and a distinguished Civil Servant
is designated " Professor ", a title he has never possessed.
Moreover, it is rather surprising that though the authors acknow-
ledge the " bibliographical assistance " given by Dr. W. Rydzewski,
no acknowledgment is made to the extracts which have been taken
from that author's paper " A historical review of bird marking "

have made it obvious that this was very probably a misnomer--it being most unlikely
that so many Conures could have come from an island the small size (32 square miles)
of St. Thomas, one of the Virgin Islands.
While in England during the summer, Dr. Lendon saw specimens at the London
Zoo, " Darenth-Hulme ," and elsewhere, and immediately expressed his disagreement
with the identification. The Doctor gave it as his opinion that this co-called " St.
Thomas's " was really the Yellow-cheeked Conure, Aratinga pertinax chrysophrys , of
British Guiana, Surinam, and Cayenne : this identification has since been confirmed
by reference to the skins at the British Museum (Natural History).
Dr. Lendon informs me that when on a recent visit to the Brookfield Zoo, Chicago,
he saw a real St. Thomas Conure (A. p. pertinax ). According to Karl Plath this bird,
the survivor of four, is considered really rare.
Other vernacular names for A. p. chrysophrys are Golden-eyebrowed and Guiana

SUSCEPTIBILITY OF MOUSTACHE PARRAKEETS TO PNEUMONIA
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.9857445625" page_id="58091146"  page_num="Page 75" year="" vol="">
Further experience with the Moustache Parrakeet tends to confirm their
susceptibility to pneumonia as discussed by Mr. Buckingham-Jones.
My birds were kept in unheated outdoor flights all the year round and appeared to
be perfectly fit and happy at all times. They were not shut in at night, but I was
always somewhat concerned for them in very cold weather as all Psittacula are
vulnerable to frostbitten feet. I am afraid that at that time I felt it worth risking a
loss as they were readily replaceable whilst the ban was raised on Parrot importation.
In the autumn, however, three birds were lost in cold, wet, changeable weather.
The first was a hen found dead on the floor of the flight, but as a considerable dis-
turbance had been heard during the night with owls, it was assumed that this was
a result and no post-mortem was made. The second and third were both cocks
and had precisely the same symptoms and result. Neither bird was thought to be
ill but just doubtful about nine o'clock in the morning, they were both watched almost
continuously for a couple of hours when it was decided to bring them in as a precau-
tion. One bird sat on the perch all day, ate nothing, looked better late at night,
and was dead early the next morning. The other bird seemed to collapse whilst
his cage was being warmed up and although he was only a doubtful bird when
I went for the cage, ten minutes later he was on the floor of the flight in a pretty
bad way and died in about four hours.
It would appear, therefore, that these birds are susceptible to pneumonia, but
are also extremely resistant to it in displaying any symptoms thus making diagnosis
almost impossible. The only remedy would appear to be prevention, as a cure is
almost out of the question at so short notice. Pneumonia in birds is almost always
incurable. I have tried penicillin, but this is useless if administered orally, it may
have a chance if injected into the blood by hypodermic. Recently, however, I have
heard of cures being effected with aureomycin on the continent (administered orally),
I have also tried it myself on two cases and both have been successfully saved. It
must be admitted that the steps were taken on suspicion rather than diagnosis, so that
although my birds recovered I cannot guarantee that they ever actually had
pneumonia. Perhaps some of our medical members can give further authentic
information on these possibilities.

PRINCESS OF WALES OR QUEEN ALEXANDRA PARRAKEETS
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.893769684210526" page_id="58091146"  page_num="Page 75" year="" vol="">
I notice that in his interesting account of the National Show, Mr. Seth-Smith
deplores the fact that people will persist in referring to what he prefers to call the
Queen Alexandra Parrakeet, as the Princess of Wales Parrakeet, since, as he rightly
points out, England has had more than one Princess of Wales, but only one Queen
Alexandra.
Unfortunately, however, were his suggestion adopted, and taking into account
people's incurable habit of abbreviating names (Budgerigar . . . Budgie . . .
Budge !), I am afraid it would be no time at all befcre the Queen Alexandra Parrakeet
became simply the Alexandra Parrakeet.
This, in turn, would lead to endless confusion between the Alexandra Parrakeet
and the much commoner Alexandrine Parrakeet, and one can well imagine the
acrimonious correspondence that would ensue if somebody--possibly in all innocence--
sold one of the latter as one of the former !
I have sometimes heard Princess of Wales Parrakeets referred to as Princess Parra-
keets, but this does not matter so much, as there is no other Princess Parrakeet,
nor any with a name at all resembling it.

Mr. Seth-Smith, in his National Show report, says : "I wish they would not persist
in calling this bird the ' Princess of Wales Parrakeet
To be logical and correct one must call a bird by the name originally given to it.
This bird was named in 1862 and was therefore known by no other name until this
lady became Queen some forty years later. The fact that the title persists as the most
commonly used name for this bird to-day speaks for itself.
Surely it is not suggested that every time a title of address is altered for an individual,
the name given to anything as a mark of respect to that individual must also be
changed in scientific records. Otherwise we should now have to call the Stanley
Parrakeet the Derbyan, since it was named after the Earl of Derby who was then
Stanley, and what would happen to the other Derbyan Parrakeet. The Mrs. Johnstone
Lorikeet might have to become an entirely different bird if that lady had happened
to re-marry. A newly discovered species might be called the Cornwall Parrakeet,
later on this might be changed to the Prince of Wales Parrakeet, and even still later
to the King Charles Parrakeet. Let us be reasonable and stick to the most popular
and proper name, " Princess of Wales," in any case the scientific record retains
the essential dedication " alexandriae ".

BREEDING OF RED-BELLIED CONURES ( Pyrrhura vittata)
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.948637405405405" page_id="58091147"  page_num="Page 76" year="" vol="">
I am requested by Sir Edward Hallstrom to inform you that the birds he bred were
Red-bellied Conures ( Pyrrhura vittata) as described on page 133 of Parrots and
Parrot-like Birds, by the Marquess of Tavistock.
The following notes, as dictated by Sir Edward on 8th February, 1954, no doubt
will be of interest to you and the Society members :--
These Conures were bred in an aviary approximately 3 feet wide, 6 feet high, and
16 feet long, with one end covered, back, sides, and top, for about 3 feet, and a cover
over the front of the aviary for about 3 feet to protect the food and water containers.
The nest used was an upright one of the grandfather clock type. Three eggs were
laid but only one chick was reared and this is now about twelve months old.
You may also be interested to know that during the last twelve months Sir Edward
has bred the following : 2 Musschenbroek's Parrots, 1 Double-eyed Dwarf Parrot,
8 Eclectus, 1 Alexandrine X Indian-Ringneck hybrid, 10 Hooded X Many-
coloured hybrids, 6 Hooded Parrots, 1 Lesser Sulphur-crested Cockatoo, 1 Blue-eyed
Cockatoo (New Britain), 60 to 70 African Lovebirds, such as the Peach-faced,
Masked, Black-cheeked, Fischers, as well as quite a number of lutino Nyassas, and
in addition to these, of course, Sir Edward has bred quite a number of the
commoner species such as Rosellas, Pennants, Scarlet-chested, Turquoisines, Red-
collared Lorikeets, etc.
Many of the young cock Hooded-Many-coloured hybrids are almost identical with
the Paradise Parrakeet, but unfortunately there has only been one female, which is at
present mated to an unrelated cock bird, and it will be very interesting to see the
results--if any.
The African Grey Parrots have had chicks and have reared them almost to maturity.
These birds nested in a vertical hollow log about 2 ft. 6 in. down from the top,
with wire netting on the side to enable the birds to get down easily, but it would almost
appear that the birds had jumped down on the young birds and killed them.
The Lesser Sulphur-crested Cockatoos also damaged the wing of one of their
youngsters by jumping on them, but all nests are now on a slope to ensure that the
birds walk down and do not jump down on the youngsters.
At the present time there is a Yellow-tailed Black Cockatoo sitting on an egg
and Sir Edward hopes that the young bird will appear within the next few days.
The Blue-eyed New Britain Cockatoos have bred in a heavy box-type nest and have
only had one chick at a time, although two eggs were laid on several occasions. It
was noted that the male sat on the egg most of the time, but occasionally both birds
were in the nest, but on the majority of occasions the hen was the only one seen
flying in the aviary.

between them , unfortunately these were all spoilt at various times during incubation
by cats getting on top of the flights and disturbing the hens. Bourkes reared five very

both being infertile likewise the Princess of Wales had eight eggs, found to be infertile
after sitting the full time. A yellow Redrump also had four eggs but was disturbed
whilst sitting. Stanleys, Barrabands, and Rock Peplars all spent a great deal of time
in their nest-boxes but did not lay.

As planned, it is up to two pairs of Plumheads, two pairs of Many-colours, two pairs

(\0x25A0Cyanomitra verticalis verticalis)
By Gerald T. Iles (Belle Vue Zoo, Manchester, England)
The Green-headed Olive Sunbird, or, as it is also known, the
Olive-backed Sunbird, is not one of the most brilliantly coloured of
the family, but it is quite pleasingly marked and is of special interest
because the hen has a cap of metallic green. A detailed description
of the birds is hardly necessary in view of Mr. Reid Henry's exquisite
plate accompanying this article. I feel I should mention, however,
that because of the hen's unusual possession of the metallic cap she
was once considered to be a distinct species. Shelley, in his Monograph
of the Nectarinida, shows both sexes with pectoral tufts, the cock's being
very pale yellow while the hen's are shown as white. Bannerman, in
his Birds of West Africa , says that the hen does not possess pectoral
tufts, while Jackson, in his Birds of Kenya and Uganda , states that in the
sub-species Cyanomitra verticalis viridisplendens the hen's pectoral tufts
are white but not so well developed as in the cock. While the pectoral
tufts on our cock bird are visible at all times I am not certain about
the hen. She appears to have a few pale yellow feathers at the shoulder
tips.
Our pair of Sunbirds were caught by natives in the Kissy coastal
area near Freetown, Sierra Leone, for Mr. Kenneth Smith during
the early part of 1951, and he brought them to England and subse-
quently to the Zoo in May of that year. Where they were found this
species is fairly common and the birds were seen feeding from flowers
on several occasions. Ours were sent to us as a mature and an
immature cock, but with the aid of Shelley's Monograph I quickly
identified them as a true pair. The two birds have always been kept
in separate cages, as I have had unhappy experiences with fights.
The cock bird is exhibited in the range of Sunbirds in our Hall of
Living Jewels, while the hen has always been kept in the Stock Room
where she has become quite a pet.
Each evening I feed all the Sunbirds myself, and through doing so

D. M. WEST-FACTORS IN MIXING PSITTACINES
The following is a list of some of the birds that I have kept under
mixed conditions, and the general results of such a piactice.
Queen Alexandra's. This species is very easy to mix with other
birds that are not too aggressive. I have kept pairs of Alexandras
with Bourke's, Turquoisines, Elegants, and Scarlets, with perfect
results. They will also agree with budgies, single pairs of African
Agapornis (except Peach-face), and with Gockatiels, Plum-heads,
and Javan Parrakeets. In very large pens I would have no hesitancy
in mixing them with Kings, Crimson-wings, or small American Parrots
as Lineolated, etc.
Barraband's. This is another species that is most charming in
mixed company. They will agree with practically all birds, indeed
one must be careful not to put them with smaller but more active
and aggressive birds, for they are not really capable of protecting
themselves. Besides the PlcophcTna^ they are safe with even some of
the larger birds as Indian Rock Parrots. I have not seen them ever
become aggressive even to very small birds such as Zebra Finches.
Crimson-wings. Individual pairs differ greatly in disposition.
One pair I have will agree with anything I place with them, while a
second pair agreed with Barraband's for a while and then the male
Crimson-wing became increasingly aggressive, and they were finally
separated. With birds of this individual variation it would be best to
try them out on a day when the owner is around to watch. A single
pair of Red-rumps kept for a short time with a pair of the Crimson-
wings proved to be absolutely impossible, for the Red-rumps literally
drove the Crimson-wings to distraction, chasing them and making
their lives miserable. It has always been my experience that Red-
rumps are totally impossible to keep with others birds--regardless
of the size of the birds they are to have as " room-mates
Kings. These rather phlegmatic birds are of a peaceful disposition.
They seem to like to sit on a perch alone--and the only time my pair
would get upset was when some Neophema would fly to the perch the
King would be dozing upon. Then, with great effort, the King would
walk towards the bird and scold it off that perch to another and
then resume his nap where he had been interrupted. Kings will
agree with Indian birds such as Plum-heads and Ring-necks, and
related Indian birds. The one difficulty in keeping other birds in
with Kings is that a King takes so much space while flying that it not
infrequently alarms the other pair of birds. For this reason a steady
pair of birds would be the best choice. In very large aviaries Kings
are most desirable, for they will not bother anyone, and there is little
chance for a quarrel over a nest, for most California Kings delight in
dropping their eggs from the perch--or at best in just laying them
hither and thither about the aviary.

Barraband's are equally applicable here. Indeed, the Rock is such
a lazy bird that it would appear nearly impossible to upset its placid
disposition.
Neophema. These birds are quite easy to mix in with other species
that are not too aggressive. They are clever flyers, and so are not easily
frightened by some larger, clumsy bird. They require a small nest-
box that can be placed up very close to the roof of the cage, so that
there is just enough room for them to perch on top of the nest--and
very few of the larger birds will try to inspect more than once the small
box required for the Grass Parrots. Their steady habits, once used to
the aviary, make them ideal for keeping under mixed conditions.
Rosellas. These birds are extremely difficult to keep in with
other birds at any time of the year--and during the spring nearly
impossible. Individual pairs differ greatly in their temperament.
In a large mixed collection some years ago we had a pair of Red
Rosellas that raised young each year, and never bothered the other
birds ( Agapornis and Neophema) at any time. In smaller breeding
cages I would not try to mix any of the Platycercus with anything else
during the breeding season. Of the group the Red and the Blue seem
to be the most aggressive--even to budgies and Zebras, etc. The
Pennant's and the Stanley seem to be a little more amenable to group
life--but I have never actually tried them with any other bird.
Possibly some other reader could shed additional light on this matter.
Barnard grouping. Like their near allies, the Platycercus , all the
Barnardius are inclined to be bullying and aggressive during the Spring
season. For this reason I have never kept adult Barnard's in with
other birds. Birds of the year are perfectly safe, though Barnard's
work in pairs when it comes to bullying other inmates of an aviary.
Psephotus. This group contains some birds that I personally
consider absolutely impossible subjects for communal living--and
other members that are ideal subjects. The Red-rump I have already
commented upon--and I have had Red-rumps (working in pairs)
actually murder Zebra Finches, budgies, and Button Quail. The
Blue-bonnets are reputed to be very dangerous and aggressive with
other birds--though this has not been our experience. In a large mixed
collection consisting mostly of odd birds (and the majority males at
that), a pair of Blue-bonnets have lived peacefully for over a year.
In another cage where a budgie had entered through an error, no
attempt was made to murder the budgie. They also appear to be
happy with Queen Alexandras and Cockatiels. One thing is sure
though--one male Blue-bonnet couldn't be happier than when he
is engaged in combat with another of his own species. It is a very
poor policy to keep this bird near other Blue-bonnets, for the owner
will eventually end up with a number of toeless birds from fights
taking place on the wire. Hooded are perfect in every respect and

are never aggressive to other birds. Because the Hooded generally
nest at a period in the year when any other bird in its right mind
is moulting or resting, there is very little occasion to worry over fights
concerning nesting sites. Many-colours are variable in their disposi-
tions. One breeding pair will not tolerate any living thing in their
aviary while they are nesting--and even hate and fight the English
Sparrows that sometimes alight on their aviary. Another pair is
never upset, and though I have not kept birds with this pair during
the spring breeding season, the pair were not upset when a year ago
a young Bourke got into their aviary when a door accidentally came
open. Not wanting to frighten the Many-colours who had young in
the nest, I did not catch the Bourke, and he stayed in with the Many-
colours for over a month with no bad results.
Asiatic Parrakeets. The only Asiatic psittacines kept in California
are the Plum-head, Derbyan, Ring-neck, Alexandrine, and Javan and
Moustache. They all seem quite well disposed to company in their
aviary, and are not over aggressive. Of the birds mentioned, possibly
the most problematical are the Ring-necks. Individual pairs will
differ greatly in their behaviour towards other birds--some pairs
agreeing and others bullying other birds. I think that the answer
here is space--for Ring-necks do agree well in an aviary that is
spacious. Moustache and Javan are both peaceful and the large and
fierce looking Alexandrine seems the most peaceful of the entire lot.
The Derbyan is another bird that does not resent companions--
agreeing very well even with budgies. As all the Asiatic Parrakeets
nest very early in the year (as compared to the average Australian),
there is not much likelihood of any serious disagreement over nesting
sites.
African species. Apart from the Senegal Parrot, which seems
another perfect aviary inmate, the only commonly kept Africans
(here in California) are the various Agapornis. I have found that
single pairs of the Agapornis will agree well with any of the larger
birds--both living and nesting well with them. Peach-faces are
certainly the most aggressive and I feel the least reliable in mixed
collections.
I would not trust the various African Lovebirds with small budgies
and finches, but with larger birds they are perfectly safe. As they are
very clever about tumbling quickly into their nests, there is little
chance that a larger pair of birds would want the Lovebird's nest,
filled with straw and leaves, as is generally the case. By hanging the
Lovebird nest up close to the roof and leaving just enough space for
the Lovebirds to sit on the nest top, all should be calm and peaceful.
I frequently allow no perch outside the nesting entrance to stop or at
least help prevent the larger and curious birds from looking in with
such great ease. Last year a female Barraband made regular visits

8 5
to a young family of Bourke's by sitting on the perch outside the
entrance hole and looking in at the mother Bourke feeding her babies.
As the Bourke's did not object all was well--but this year the Barraband
will have a hard time because the perch has been removed. This
makes the entrance to the nest a little more difficult for the smaller
birds too--but they do not seem to mind, and are certainly not
discouraged by this.
American species. The beauty of some of the American psittacine
species is undeniably great, but this is quite eclipsed by their voices,
for this reason they have not been extensively kept even here in
California. Some of the species appear to be not too aggressive, while
others may be considered as too aggressive for mixed company. The
only collection containing many American species here in California
is that of Mr. G. Rayson Brown in Arcadia. On visits to his aviaries
I have noticed that some Conures are being kept in with other birds--
but generally they are just unmated odds and ends. Possibly he would
let us know his observations on these American species. Mr. J.
Buteyn, at San Luis Rey, also keeps some excellent American species,
and at least two of the Conures in his collection have not been
identified.
Lories. The Lories are so very aggressive that they cannot be
kept with other birds. Mr. G. R. Brown once told me that a cock
Ring-neck accidentally got into a pen containing a pair of Dusky
Lories, and that by the time he discovered this, all that was left of the
Ring-neck was a pile of green feathers on the floor. It does appear
quite possible to mix Lories together, for Mr. Sheffler has done this
in Arizona, keeping a number of different kinds together, but in
aviaries, with no nesting facilities.
Eclectus. These large and beautiful Parrots do not seem to object
to having companions. A pair in my father's collection have a pair of
Cockatiels in their pen, and both the Eclectus and the Cockatiels get
along fine. A second pair do not object to some lutino budgies that
are housed with them. Some of the larger Parrots are slow moving, and
so not likely to cause any trouble with any companions that are swift
on the wing.
In a large pen (some 15 feet wide, 20 feet long, and about 12 feet
high) the possibilities of keeping a variety of odds and ends is enormous.
At the present time in this pen there are a large number of birds
that are either too young to breed or a mate is not available for them.
The following birds are all living in a state of contentment and agree-
ment : a cock Blue Rosella, a cock Stanley, female Yellow Rosella,
a cock Barraband, female Crimson-wing, three Ring-necks, a young
Pileated, a pair of young Many-colours, a Lineolated, a pair of Eclectus,
a Cockatiel, and a Blue-bonnet. In addition to this there were (prior
to their being mated up) a King, a Red Rosella, and a Pennant's.

D. H. S. RISDON-NOTES ON HARTLAUB's TOURACOS
Although this cage contains birds that doubtless would fight one
another in smaller aviaries, their present home appears large enough
for all to live in peace. The precautions of double feeding stations
and drinking fountains are doubtless no hindrance to the present
happy state.
I think that the most important points in mixing psittacines are the
double feeding and drinking stations, the provisions of nesting sites
that are as far apart as is possible, and the provision of suitable
perching facilities. It would be most interesting to have other members'
experiences in mixing various birds. Who knows--maybe I'll find
some place to put one more pair of birds without building a new

By D. H. S. Risdon (Dudley, Worcs., England)
Cecil Webb's very interesting article in a recent issue of the
Magazine concerning the wild life of these birds prompts me to write
the following notes on observations I have made of their habits in
captivity.
In 1950 there was an adult pair of Hartlaub's Touracos at Dudley
Zoo. They were housed in one of the large flight cages in the Bird
House on their own, and that being my first summer at Dudley I was
bitten with the desire to try and breed them.
I had no idea whether or not they were a true pair. There was
certainly no obvious difference between them as far as appearance
went, but they got on well together so we fixed up a bunch of twigs
in a corner of the flight. The middle of this was flattened out and a
shallow dish-shaped piece of wire netting was fixed to form a platform.
On this some coarse hay was shaped to form a foundation for a nest.
Needless to say this corner of the cage was screened from the public
to give the birds as much privacy as possible.
Much to our delight the birds took to this nesting site almost at
once. They spent a good deal of each day sitting on the platform
side by side and I think they roosted there at night. I did not know
then, as I discovered later, that these Touracos much prefer to roost
on a platform of this nature rather than a perch, and in subsequent
years, when I had them in an outdoor aviary containing several
open-fronted nest-boxes, they invariably used them to sleep in.
In spite, however, of taking so well to the site we made for them
the birds made no obvious attempt to build a nest. They did, however,
show other signs of breeding condition. One bird, presumably the
male, fed the other one with food regurgitated from the crop and

frequently displayed by tilting its head right back till its crest touched
its back, exposing the throat, meanwhile uttering a low growling note.
A form of threat display is to depress the crest which has the effect
of enhancing the white patches in front of the eyes. At such times
these patches appear dazzlingly white and are obviously intended to
intimidate a rival. These are the only displays I have ever seen them
do which is surprising considering the lovely colouring of Hartlaub's
Touracos. Somehow I would have expected them to show the beautiful
carmine of the flight feathers, but this never seems to be seen except
when the birds are flying.
Matters continued in this sort of stalemate for some weeks and
I began to think our efforts had been in vain and that the birds were
just spoofing us, when suddenly one died. To our intense disappoint-
ment the post-mortem examination revealed an impacted egg in the
oviduct, so that was that. Subsequent events, of which more anon,
have more or less proved the other bird to be a cock and I am afraid
that, although we imported some more the next year, the bird that
died was the only hen we had.
The newly imported birds consisted of four obviously hand-reared
specimens in immature plumage. This was like that of the adult,
but all the colours were duller. Of these one died soon after arrival
and we placed the other three with the single old bird in the Bird
House where they passed the winter.
By the following spring the young ones had moulted into adult
plumage and then trouble started. First one died suddenly and
mysteriously, and some weeks later two of the remainder set about the
third. Fortunately it was discovered what was happening in time
and the odd bird was removed. Naturally I thought the two
aggressors were a true pair which had come into breeding condition,
and that summer (1952) I removed them to my garden aviary which
is planted and not being directly accessible to the public has some
degree of privacy.
Here the birds spent the summer and did absolutely nothing in
spite of being given a variety of nesting sites in the shape of open-
fronted boxes, closed boxes with only a hole entrance, and wire plat-
forms fixed both in the growing bushes, as well as in bunches of twigs
fixed up on the walls. They did, however, use the boxes for sleeping
in, but never together as did the original pair. Each bird slept in a
separate box. They never went to them until dusk when, having
carefully looked about them, to see if the coast was clear, they made
a sudden dive into their respective boxes and settled down for the
night.
Although they didn't breed they did, however, give me a lot of
joy in watching them in a really big aviary where they could show
their graceful flight with the flash of brilliant carmine as they glided

D. H. S. RISDON-NOTES ON HARTLAUB's TOURACOS
from perch to perch. I think if I were only allowed to keep one sort
of bird I should plump for Touracos. They seem to me to combine
all the best qualities of the pigeon, parrot and pheasant families
rolled into one. Their colouring is exquisite, and their movements
the essence of gracefulness whether in flight or hopping, skipping and
jumping along their perches. Moreover, they have delightful voices
which, calling across the garden on a summer's day, make you feel
they really have brought a bit of their native jungle with them.
It might be as well to record here the various noises they can make.
Besides the well-known Touraco call " wowk wowk wowk " which
both sexes seem to use when they are feeling pleased with themselves,
there is the growling display note described above, which is also
used as a note of aggression. The alarm note is a high pitched " chip
chip " and anger aroused say at the sight of a cat is expressed in a
kind of chatter which cannot be imitated in writing.
As my garden aviary is only a summer one and has no proper
shelter, the Touracos were transferred to one of the Zoo aviaries for
the winter where, apart from being shut in at night, they had no
extra protection in the way of heat. They came through the Dudley
winter, which can be extremely bleak, in fine fettle, which I think
proves them to be a hardy species.
When the spring of 1953 came round I again transferred them to
my garden aviary and as they still showed no sign of attempting to
nest I thought I would see what a little jealousy would do. So I
caught up the odd remaining bird which all this time had been
living in the Bird House, and put him in with them. I stood by,
half expecting there to be a frightful row, remembering how they had
attacked him eighteen months before, but not a bit of it. Both birds
jumped up one on each side of the newcomer and there ensued what
I can only describe as a lot of billing and cooing between all three.
So far from fighting they all seemed frightfully pleased to see each other
and began feeding each other indiscriminately !
I felt justified, therefore, in leaving all three together to see what
would happen. All this time, remember, I had been assuming that
the original two were a pair. I had watched them and noted what
I thought were differences in their appearance--more white on the
facial markings of the cock and so on, but that's where I tripped up
and my experience only goes to show how easily one can jump to
conclusions. After some weeks of living in harmony the bird which
I always supposed to have been the hen became somewhat aggressive
towards the other two, then the position would be reversed and one
of the others would seem to be top dog for a while.
No serious quarrelling took place, however, and I was content to
let well alone, thinking that perhaps they were at last being stimulated
into breeding condition.

Alas for my hopes. One morning after a period of tranquility in
the aviary I noticed the newly introduced bird was missing. With
a sinking heart I searched the aviary and eventually found its corpse
crammed in a corner completely scalped. This made me think more
than ever that the survivors were a true pair, but this winter, for
accommodation reasons they were put back in the Bird House in
one of the large built-in cages. They had not been there long before
one set about the other and, but for the timely intervention of one
of the keepers, would undoubtedly have met the fate of the other bird.
As it was the feathers were scalped from the back of its head.
We are now left with two Hartlaub's Touracos living apart and
I am reluctantly driven to the conclusion after three years' trying,
that all our birds except the first one which died of egg trouble,
must have been males--hence no efforts to nest.
Hartlaub's Touracos appear to be perfectly hardy. They stayed
each year in an open aviary with only a bit of overhead shelter till
well into October when night ground frosts were experienced. Even
then they showed no discomfort and were only moved into more
sheltered conditions because they are too rare and valuable to be
trifled with.
They seem to be entirely fruit eaters and provided plenty of this
is supplied, will eat little else. They will take boiled carrot, boiled
potato, soaked bread and insectile food under protest, but never
touch it if there is plenty of fruit. Grapes and cherries are favourites
and privet berries are liked. They have large gapes and swallow
grapes and cherries whole, disgorging the stones later. After
swallowing a large cherry they sit still with a fatuous expression
looking extremely uncomfortable for a few moments while it slips
down.
They are keen bathers and although I have examined their bath
water most carefully on many occasions, I have never seen any sign
of the red colouring matter from their flight feathers being dissolved
in the water.

A splendid collection of mammals, birds, and reptiles presented to
the Zoological Society in commemoration of the Coronation and the
Royal tour of Australia and Tasmania, arrived in London on the
8th April.
Sir Edward Hallstrom was instrumental in arranging this
magnificent gift, and sent two of his staff, Mr. W. Turner and Mr. E.
Hargreaves, to care for the collection on the long sea voyage. Due to
first-class packing and expert care, the specimens arrived in excellent
condition.
Taronga Zoological Park Trust ; Sir Edward Hallstrom ;
Mr. David Fleay, the Zoological Society of Southern Australia ; the
Animals' and Birds' Protection Board, Hobart ; the Agent-General
for Tasmania ; the Zoological Board of Victoria, and the Zoological
Gardens of Perth all contributed generously to the collection, which
totalled some 190 specimens.
The rarest of the birds are two Baudin's or White-tailed Black
Cockatoos ( Calyptorhynchus baudini ), the first to be brought alive to this
country for many years. A pair of Greater Palm Cockatoos ( Probosciger
aterrimus ) of Cape York peninsula and the opposite coastal areas of
New Guinea makes another attractive exhibit and an interesting com-
parison with two of the very closely allied Aru Island form that have
been in the Parrot House since 1927 and 1946 respectively.
Other exhibits of especial interest that have not been in the collec-
tion since before the war are Tawny Frogmouths ( Podargus strigoides ),
three of them hand-reared by Mr. Fleay ; Australian Cranes {Grus
rubicunda) ; White-backed and Black-backed Piping Crows ( Gymnor -
hina hypoleuca leuconota and G. tibicen ) ; Cereopsis Geese ( Cereopsis
novae-hollandiae) , and Maned Geese (Chenonetta jubata).

A BRIEF ACCOUNT OF A WONDERFUL DAY
SPENT IN SEEING SIR EDWARD HALLSTROM'S
COLLECTION OF PARRAKEETS IN SYDNEY,
N.S.W., DECEMBER, 1953

By R. G. Kirkham (Clonskeagh, Go. Dublin, Eire)
I had come to Australia for a health trip, and to get away from the
Irish winter, and was armed with a letter of introduction to that fairy
godfather of Australian Aviculture, Sir Edward J. Hallstrom. Im-
mediately on my arrival in Sydney I sent off my letter to him, and
then sailed away for a short visit to Fiji and New Caledonia. Within
twenty-four hours of sailing I received a Marconigram on board
which read : " Delighted to see you on your return to Sydney," and
Sir Edward was indeed as good as his word. I called at his office by
appointment, and was cordially received and introduced to his chief
collector and zoologist, Walter H. Turner, with the instruction to
" show him everything ", and that is just what he did.
We started out the following morning at 8.30 a.m., and went first
to Sir Edward's beautiful home at Northbridge, which is situated on
a narrow neck of land overlooking Sydney Harbour. There the
principal collection is housed, in all about 860 birds. The aviaries are
built on three sides of the house, and take up, I would say at a guess,
about two acres or perhaps a little more. Sir Edward has a great
fondness for Macaws and Cockatoos, and where in the past I have
seen perhaps five or six in a zoo collection, Sir Edward keeps no less
than 67 Macaws of all the well-known species, including several pairs
of the giant " Hyacinth " looking very beautiful and in tip-top condi-
tion, with not a feather astray. One pair in particular were obviously
in breeding condition, making a great fuss of each other. The cock
sitting close up beside his wife with " one arm around her neck "
as Sir Edward put it. After visiting the Macaws, and feeling a little
overwhelmed by them, I asked about Lovebirds, as these are great
favourites of mine, and was taken to a range of aviaries each measuring
about 10 feet by 6 and 7 feet high. There I was truly amazed to see
in each compartment a flock of Lovebirds, nothing less. Sir Edward
told me that at the start of each season he puts six or eight pairs of
birds in each compartment, with plenty of nest-boxes, and allows
them to go ahead without let or hindrance. At the end of the breeding
season he usually finishes up with 35 or 40 youngsters in each division,
and this goes for Peach-faced (Agapornis roseicollis ) as well as the
other less pugnacious species. I discussed this phenomenon with Walt
Turner, and it is his considered opinion that if only a couple of pairs
are kept together they usually fight for want of something better to

do, but if four or five pairs share the same compartment, they are so
busy increasing the Lovebird population they haven't the time, or the
inclination, to fight, and large and happier families are the result.
This is something which will be only of purely academic interest to
most Lovebird breeders at home, as very few of us have more than one
or two pairs of any but Fischer's or Masked, and are too scared ol
losing any by fighting to risk more than one pair to a compartment.
It gave me a great thrill to see about 40 Black-cheeked and 20 or
30 Nyasas, but the biggest surprise of all was to see ten of the lovely
little lutino Nyasas looking, as Ted Vane so aptly put it on one
occasion, like " little irate Colonels ", their orange-red cheeks giving
them a really fiery appearance ! Last, but by no means least, about
40 Peach-faced sitting in a row, and living in harmony together.
They reminded me of the words of a popular song : " And never is
heard a discouraging word," etc.
Having seen and marvelled at the Lovebirds, I mentioned " Princess
of Wales " Parrakeets. I liked them so much, and was the proud
possessor of an excellent pair. Sir Edward quietly took me to an
enclosure near the Macaws, and there I saw them rise in a cloud
from the ground where they had been feeding. I just could not guess
how many there were, but there seemed to be at least a couple of
dozen pairs. They all lived happily with a pair of Blue-bonnets, several
pairs of Hooded and Many-colours, and one or two odd birds, and
what a picture they made !
After leaving the " Princess of Wales " with reluctance, we made
our way to another range of aviaries constructed of concrete, coloured
and shaped to look like logs, and of very attractive appearance. These
housed a very large and varied collection of Cockatoos, numbering
about sixty-five in all, which included the Yellow-tailed Black, the
Red-tailed Black, and the White-tailed Black. There were also
several pairs of the Palm Cockatoo (Probosciger aterrimus) very Black !
very Beautiful, and, I should say, very hard to handle ! I might
mention in passing I also saw a lone specimen of the Lesser Vasa
Parrot, also known as the Pigeon Parrot of Madagascar. This is a most
unusual looking slim bird, washy black in colour, with a small head,
and light-coloured horn beak, about the size of a Rock Pebbler,
but with a very long neck, which to my mind, quite spoils its appear-
ance. The lovely little Musschenbroek's from New Guinea, a small
dwarf parrot, green shading to yellow, with a crimsom breast, is a very
friendly little bird which Sir Edward has recently been successful in
breeding. In a nearby enclosure was a whole flock of little Fig Parrots
(the Double-eyed Dwarf), little bigger than a Lovebird, the cocks
with dark red heads and the hens with grey heads. Noisy and
chattering, never still, always on the move, they made a most attractive
sight.

I also had a very good look at seven Glossy Black Cockatoos, but as
there is quite a story attached to them, they must be the subject of
some further notes.
After a cup of morning tea with Sir Edward, I was whisked away
to his week-end retreat at Mona Vale, about 25 miles outside Sydney,
where a small collection of about 100 of the most prized specimens are
housed, and there I saw three of the most rare and wonderful Parrakeets
in Australia, which I believe nobody else possesses at the moment.
Four pairs of Paradise Parrakeets ", two cock Golden-shouldered
Parrakeets and a Ground Parrakeet, and all in the same collection,
virtually rubbing shoulders together. If I say it was worth travelling
from Ireland to see the " Paradise Parrakeets " alone, I know my
readers will understand and forgive my enthusiasm. How can I
describe them ? The cock is a long, slim bird with the forehead and
under tail-coverts red ; the crown of the head black, the face and
breast bright green shading to a blue which reminds one of shining
butterfly wings, and the whole bird looking a most graceful and
enchanting sight, enough to delight the heart and, whisper it, arouse
a little touch of envy in every true bird keeper. My description of this
beautiful bird (I'm liable to run out of adjectives when talking about
it) is perhaps a little sketchy, but as Sir Edward kindly allowed me
to take a colour film of the birds, and they were most co-operative,
I am looking forward to seeing, for the first time on any screen, " The
Paiadise Parrakeet." It should, of course, be explained that they
are really Hooded X Many-coloured Parrakeet hybrids.
The Golden-shouldered Parrakeets, also very rare, and to be found only
in one or two places in Australia, was believed by many to be extinct, but
was rediscovered by Walt Turner to take their place in Sir Edward's
collection. The cock has a black head with a bright golden-yellow
frontal band and golden-yellow patches on the wings and shoulders,
and the body is bluish-green. The hen is a pale edition of the cock'
with the body yellowish-green instead of blue. I might add that the
colours of both cock and hen appear to change in different lights.
The Ground Parrakeet is stated in all the best books to be found
in the coastal areas in New South Wales, Victoria, South Australia,
and Tasmania, but I'm told on very good authority, that less than
half a dozen are known to exist in aviaries throughout Australia, in
fact very few bird keepers have ever seen one, let alone kept it.
Mr. Turner told me they have had great difficulty in keeping theirs.
The bird is very nervous and shy, hiding in the grass on the floor of the
aviary, and then at the slightest noise or disturbance, hurling itself at
the wire netting. It will be interesting to know if a mate can be
found and if it can be persuaded to go to nest in an aviary. Time
alone will tell.
Sir Edward also possesses the largest collection of Birds of Paradise

in the world, and he is coming to Switzerland in M!ay to lecture on
them, their habits and nuptial display, and as I am sure, complete and
comprehensive reports will appear in the Magazine, I propose to
refrain from comment !
In concluding these notes, I should like to express my thanks and
pay tribute to the generosity of Sir Edward Hallstrom. He has done
more than any man alive to save many beautiful species of Australian
birds from extinction, to preserve them for posterity, and to make it
possible for aviculturists in many lands to enjoy their beauty, by
sending them to zoos all over the world.
After my visit to Mona Vale, I felt I had seen everything that
mattered in the avian world, but not so. Walt Turner took me to
Taronga Park, and there I saw many of the treasures presented to
Taronga by Sir Edward. Having spent a few hours there, I came to
the conclusion that Taronga was misnamed. It really should have
been called Hallstrom Park, because Sir Edward, more than anyone
else, is responsible for Taronga Park being the finest zoo in the southern
hemisphere.
About the birds in Taronga I shall try to tell you a little later !

Three species new to the collection have recently been received.
They are the Baudin's Cockatoos, on which a note appears elsewhere
in this issue ; a pair of Philippine Ducks (Anas luzonica ), purchased,
and a Swainson's Buzzard (. Buteo swainsoni ), presented by the Paignton
Zoological and Botanical Gardens.
Other presentations include a Short-toed Eagle (Circaitus gallicus ) ,
a Crossbill (Loxia curvirostra ) ; a Stone Curlew (Burhinus cedicnemus),
picked up at Biggin Hill during the severe weather of February ; a
Gannet ( Sula bassana) ; six Jobi Island Doves (Gallicolumba jobiensis) ,
a Fieldfare (Tuydus pilcLYis) \ a Hawfinch ( Coccothvaustes coccothydustes&amp;apos;) ,
a Regal Sunbird ( Cinnyyis Yegius ) ; a Bronzy Sunbird ( Nectayinia
kiliYnensis) ; a Kenya Malachite Sunbird (jV. famosa anigularis ) ; and
four Uganda Buff-breasted Sunbirds (Cinnyyis venustus igneiventyis ).
The common name of this Sunbird is a poor one, for the area of buff
is small and occurs only where the violet of the upper breast meets the
orange of the under parts. The Orange-bellied or, as the scientific
name suggests, the Fire-bellied would be a better name.

Duke ol Bedford, this is the only parrot of which the female is more
brightly coloured than the male.
An African Ring-necked Parrakeet ( Psittacula krameri) ; four Peach-
faced or Rosy-faced Lovebirds ( Agapornis roseicollis) ; a Broad-tailed
or Eastern Paradise Whydah ( Steganura paradisea nilotica) ; a Shiny
Black Whydah (Vidua hypocherina) ; and a Thick-billed Weaver
(Amblyospiza albifrons ) have also been received in exchange.
Ihe King Penguin hatched last summer has completed its moult,
shedding its down more quickly than did the previous year's young one.
The Great Condors laid an egg during March, but somehow
managed to push it off the nesting ledge on to the unsympathetic
concrete below.
Of the four Vieillot's Fire-back Pheasants hatched late last summer
one has survived and could now be regarded as being fully reared.
Hopkinson records successes in France, but so far as I know this is
the first breeding of this pheasant in Great Britain.

Parrot-like Birds in Aviculture , page 150, we read : " Young birds of this
species were imported by Mr. Frostick many years ago, and fed by
hand on sponge-cake and hard-boiled egg. He had difficulty in
inducing them to take to seed and they unfortunately succumbed to
fits, no doubt by reason of the too-stimulating properties of the egg."
In addition, Dr. and Mrs. Anningson, of Cambridge, had one in
their collection in October, 1908. Wesley T. Page ( B.N. } 1908--9,

In my view the common names of birds should, where practicable, be descriptive
of their form, plumage, voice, habits, habitat, or distribution, and they should
never be named after persons.
In the case of the Queen Alexandra's or Princess of Wales' Parrakeet, a far better
name would be the Pink-throated (or even the Racquet-winged), while the
Alexandrine (presumably named after Alexander the Great) should be the Greater
Indian Ring-necked.
Terms like splendid, beautiful, superb, and so on, should not be used. The Blue-
backed Manakin is a better name than the Superb for this member of a family
containing many superb birds, while there are plenty of Sunbirds other than those
so named that are beautiful, splendid, and superb.
The Many-coloured Parrakeet is well named, but Paradise Parrakeet, Tanager,
Whydah, or Shelduck are meaningless. The Elegant Grass Parrakeet is not more
elegant than others of the genus, all of which, by the way, are blue-winged.
Names like Festive Amazon, Mercenary Amazon, and Sordid Parrot are unsuitable,
but not more absurd than those given to " Amazons " coming from districts as far
from the Amazon valley as the West Indies or the forms of " Senegal " Parrot living
far from Senegal.
There used to be a story of a London dealer who, finding that trade in Avadavats
was poor, advertised them as Tiger Finches, whereupon they sold like hot cakes.
If Avadavats bore the slightest resemblance to tigers, he would have been justified
in changing this corruption of Ahmadabad.

SPLENDID X TURQUOISINE GRASS PARRAKEET HYBRIDS
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.9943949375" page_id="58091172"  page_num="Page 97" year="" vol="">
In the past Turquoisine Grass Parrakeets have bred well for me, and, perhaps due
to the climate, Splendids have not done so well. I thought a hybrid between the
two might perhaps be more hardy, and in this I may possibly be right, because
during the last two seasons I have bred fourteen hybrids--eight in 1952 and six
in x 953-
The cock hybrid is very pretty and looks like the cock Splendid, except that the
red on the breast is not so extensive and it has the small red patch of the Turquoisine
on the shoulder. Without the latter it would be difficult to distinguish it from the
pure Splendid. Apart from the fact that the blue is not so deep on the face of the
hen hybrid she looks exactly like a pure Splendid. This lighter colour is so slight
that it might not even be noticed. I tried to breed with two pairs of the hybrids
last season, but had only clear eggs. Edward Boosey suggests that they may be
fertile in the second year.
Last season I also bred nineteen Bourkes--from two pairs, one Brown's X Mealy,
four green Indian Ring-necks and two lutino, two Barraband's, one Crimson-wing,
twelve Masked Lovebirds, two Turquoisines, two Elegants, one Barnard's, eight

During the course of Mr. Stuart's Exploratory Expedition into Central Australia
in 1862 Mr. Frederick G. Waterhouse made an ornithological collection. The
Board of Governors of the South Australian Institute forwarded a selection to John
Gould for his inspection. Included were specimens of what Gould describes as
" a new and very beautiful species of Parrakeet pertaining to the genus Poly teles, ..."
It is perhaps worth recalling Gould's naming of this species. He writes : " The
specific appellation I would propose for this novelty is alexandrae , in honour of that
Princess who, we may reasonably hope, is destined at some future time to be the
Queen of these realms and their dependencies, of which Australia is by no means
the most inconspicuous " {P.^.S., 1863, 232). Here Gould does not give a vernacular
name, but in his Handbook to the Birds of Australia, vol. ii, p. 32 (1865) and his Birds of

Who first changed the name to Queen Alexandra's Parrakeet cannot be determined
after this lapse of time. Possibly it was almost automatically adopted after the
accession. How has this species been called in Australian modern ornithological
literature ? It would seem that almost every possible variation has been used :

COLOUR CHANGE IN THE BEAKS OF YOUNG DERBYAN PARRAKEETS

red in young males being first apparent on the lower mandible and gradually spreading
over the upper. The change was completed in those I have bred in 15-18 months.
There is, however, a slow and very gradual colour change in plumage which
commences earlier than the " beak change ", and I have found it possible to determine
the sex from this change at a much earlier stage--certainly less than twelve months.
In the adult female there is a very distinct pale pink ring round the neck forming
a border to the grey hood. This ring is absent in the male at any age, but begins
to develop on the young hens with the partial moult, which occurs not long after
the birds leave the nest, and is followed by the appearance of a pink suffusion on
the upper breast feathers.
The appearance of these changes would, of course, depend to some extent on the
general development of the young birds, and would doubtless be delayed if they
were backward or ill-nourished.

RECORDS OF PARROTS BRED IN CAPTIVITY (ADDITIONS).
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.992635" page_id="58091173"  page_num="Page 98" year="" vol="">
By Arthur A. Prestwich. London, 1954. Price 10s. net.
This volume contains 121 additions to the records already published,
largely obtained by the author's careful search through various
Australian periodicals, notably Australian Aviculture and Bird World.
As Mr. Prestwich states in his preface, much of interest has come to
light as a result of this search, and thus made the Australian records
less incomplete. The present volume is a valuable addition to its
predecessors, and one that no aviculturist interested in Parrots should
be without.
The author makes an appeal for further information, particularly
relating to Germany to be embodied in " Further additions ", and it
is hoped all aviculturists will respond to this request to the best
of their ability.

THE OVERLOADED ARK. By Gerald M. Durrell. Faber
and Faber, Ltd., London, 1953. Price 15^. net.
The collection of wild animals rarely fails to arouse interest, and
this account of a six months' collecting trip to the little known British
Camei oons will appeal to a wide public. The author's main interest
was in mammals and reptiles, but he was accompanied by Mr. J. J.
Yealland, whose special concern is birds.
^hhe greater part of the book deals with the capture of mammals
in the great rain forests in the neighbourhood of Eshobi, and subse-
quently with collecting around Bakebe where Mr. Yealland had made
his headquarters. The author gives a very entertaining account of his
various experiences with native hunters and the trials and disappoint-
ments of hand-rearing young animals and keeping alive a very assorted
collection with their different food requirements. The rare Angwan-
tibo, Aictocebus , the Black-legged Mongoose, and the curious Giant
Water Shiew, Potomogale , were among the more interesting captures,
but many visitors to the London Zoo will find a special appeal in the
story of the life and death of Cholmondeley, the famous chimpanzee
who, after being brought back from the Cameroons, twice escaped
from Regent's Park.
There are relatively few references to birds, but every aviculturist
will sympathize with the account of the heavy-footed hen foster parent,
who after successfully hatching a brood of Crested Guinea-fowl'
equally successfully exterminated them by walking over the young-
chicks with complete unconcern and a bland expression on her face.

DIE UNZERTRENNLICHEN [LOVEBIRDS]. By Helmut
Hampe. Published by Verlag Gottfried Helene. Pfungstadt j
Darmstadt. 1953.
Helmut Hampe was a great aviculturist, and a great authority on
Parrakeets, particularly love-birds, or Agapornis, and a debt of gratitude
is due to Dr. J. Steinbacher for arranging the production of a second
edition of this book. Published in 1934, Die Unzertrennlichen was
immediately in great demand for it was a comprehensive and infor-
mative book and became out of print; hortly before the war. As
Dr. Steinbacher states in his preface to: he new edition, 44 Everything
that was known about Lovebirds is to be found in that book."
Helmut Hampe was wounded in the first world war, and during the
last ten years of his life, before his early death at the age of 42, in
! 939 &amp;gt; he had to remain in an invalid chair, but despite these draw-
backs he carried on his avicultural studies with an ardour and attention
to detail that has seldom been surpassed. His articles on his breeding
experiments with Red-faced Lovebirds and with Hooded Parrakeets

and on Brotogeris Parrakeets published in the Avicultural Magazine
in 1939, were outstanding, and the cessation of his valuable studies
was a severe loss to aviculture.
Die Unzertrennlichen opens with a chapter of general information
about Lovebirds in which the author explains how the Greek word
agapein = love, combined with ornis = bird, was given to these birds
by J. O. Selby in 1826, and how this was translated into the vernacular
name of Inseparable in French, Lovebird in English, and Unzertrennlich
= Inseparable, in German. A map showing the. distribution is
included, together with a table of the points of similarity in coloration
of the six species and of the four races of personata. Detailed descrip-
tions of the birds then follow and the Latin, German, and English
names are given, with full information regarding breeding, rearing,
and behaviour of the birds in captivity.
In his preface, Dr. Steinbacher deplores the fact that it has not
been possible to include all the illustrations which appeared in the
original book as these were destroyed during the war, but nevertheless
there are a number of most interesting photographs ol various species.
Whilst the text is in German, all those who are interested in these
attractive birds will wish to possess this book, even without knowing
the language, and with a dictionary they will be able to obtain much
information of value.

(.Aratinga pertinax chrysophrys)
By A. A. Prestwich (Southgate, England)
Swainson (1837) was the first to describe this Parrakeet and give
it full specific status under the name Conurus chrysophrys. De Souance
(1856) also recognized it as a species, compared it with the Brown-
throated ( aeruginosa ) and the Cactus ( cactorum ) and figured it (1857),
giving it the vernacular name " Perruche des Cactus a joues brunes ".
Various other authors recognized it, but Salvadori (1891, 1906),
owing to limited material, considered there were only four species--
cactorum , aeruginosus, ocularis , and pertinax --in this group, regarding
chrysophrys as synonymous with aeruginous. Later (1912), having had
an opportunity of examining a large series of specimens, loaned by
the Hon. W. Rothschild, he admitted eight species--" C. cactorum,
from S.E. Brazil, C. xanthogenius, from Bonaire, C. pertinax , from
Curasao and Saint Thomas, C. ocularis, from Panama, C. aeruginosus,
from British Guiana and Venezuela, C. aruhensis, from Aruba,
C. tortugensis, from Tortuga Island, and C. chrysophrys, from Colombia."
Peters (1937) has rearranged this group, and recognizes eight

Peters gives the habitat of chrysophrys as British Guiana, Surinam,
and Cayenne, whereas Salvadori gives Colombia. The Colombian
bird is, however, the true aeruginosa.
Nothing appears to have been written about the life of this Conure
in the wild state : and until the recent importations of the so-called
" St. Thomas's " it was unknown to English aviculture--at least there
are no records of its arrival in this country.

The Diamond Jubilee of the Avicultural Society was celebrated
by an Avicultural Conference held in London from 17th-i9th June,
1954. The meetings were held in the Meeting Room of the Zoological
Society of London, Regent's Park, London, N.W. i, by kind permission
of the Council.
In opening the proceedings at 10.30 a.m. on Thursday, 17th June,
1954, the President of the Conference, Miss Phyllis Barclay-Smith,
said that the Diamond Jubilee was a most important occasion in the
history of the Society. At the time of the 50th Anniversary the only
means of marking that important milestone in the Society's history
had been by the publication of a Jubilee Supplement of the Avi-
cultural Magazine. In that Supplement it had been stated that
in the ordinary course of events the attainment of the Avicultural
Society's 50th Anniversary would have been celebrated with due
festivity--scientific and social ; it had been the Hon. Secretaries'
happy idea to celebrate the 60th Anniversary with the scientific and
social activity which had not been possible ten years ago, in the middle
of a world war. It was most encouraging that so many members of
the Society and guests had travelled, some of them very great distances,
from different countries to take part in these celebrations, and they
were warmly welcome.
The Avicultural Society was founded in October, 1894, when there
were 52 members, to-day they numbered 982, and perhaps at the end

of this Jubilee year they might reach the thousand mark. In the
early days of the Society the membership had been chiefly concen-
trated round Brighton, where the Hon. Secretary, Dr. C. S. Simpson,
lived, but now there were members in Africa, Australia, Austria,
Belgium, Bermuda, Canada, Ceylon, Denmark, Dutch Guiana, Fin-
land, France, Germany, Holland, Hongkong, Hawaii, Iceland, Italy,
India, Japan, New Zealand, Norway, Portugal, Sweden, Sarawak,
United States, and the West Indies. Though none of the founder
members were still living, she was particularly glad that Mr. Seth-
Smith, who joined the Society in December, 1894, and therefore only
missed being a founder member by two months, was here to-day.
Mr. Seth-Smith had always played a leading part in the affairs of the
Society, and rendered great service both to it and to aviculture, par-
ticularly during the time when he had edited the Avicultural
Magazine.
The Society had only had four Presidents, the first the Countess
of Bective had been President for one year, she was followed by the
Hon. and Rev. Canon Dutton who was President from 1896 to
1920, being succeeded by Mr. H. D. Astley in 1921, who remained
in office till 1925* Since 1926 Mr. Alfred Ezra had been President
and under his wise guidance the society had grown and prospered---
he had been President for nearly thirty years, and the Council had
decided that the Diamond Jubilee celebrations would be a suitable
occasion on which to present the President with a small token of the
esteem and affection in which he was held. Miss Barclay-Smith then
presented Mr. Ezra with an illuminated scroll, and read to the meeting
the wording upon it :--
Presented to Alfred Ezra, O.B.E., President of the Avicultural
Society on the occasion of the Diamond Jubilee of the Society by
the Members of the Council as a token of their affection and
appreciation of his many years of office and notable contributions
to Aviculture."
1 he scroll, painted by Mr. D. M. Reid-Henry, contained vignettes
of Pink-headed Duck, Crowned Crane, Humming Bird, and blue
Alexandrine Parrakeet--symbolic of Mr. Ezra's main avicultural
interests.
Miss Barclay-Smith formally declared the Conference open, and
then gave details of the letters and telegrams of congratulations and
good wishes which had been received from members throughout the
world, as follows :--

THE FOUNDATION AND EARLY DAYS OF THE AVICULTURAL SOCIETY
" The Avicultural Society may be said to have commenced its life
in Brighton in 1894, thanks mainly to two gentlemen, interested in
the keeping and breeding of foreign birds, Dr. C. S. Simpson, a
medical practitioner, and Mr. Horatio R. Fillmer, a solicitor. But

these were supported by several others. There was Mr. Reginald
Phillipps, a retired Civil Servant and very experienced aviculturist,
living in London ; Dr. Arthur G. Butler, of the Entomological
Department of the British Museum, who lived at Beckenham ;
Mr. J. B. Housden, a retired business man, living at Sydenham ;
the Hon. and Rev. F. G. Dutton, of Bibury Rectory, and Mr. H. T. T.
Camps, the two chief authorities of their day on Parrots. And
there was Mr. John Frostick, who most of those present will remember
to have met at the great bird shows, and Mr. W. H. St. Quintin, who
I shall mention again later. The first President was the Countess
of Bective.
Dr. Simpson was Honorary Secretary, and Mr. Fillmer Treasurer,
and these two together edited the Magazine. The printers and
publishers were Messrs. W. T. Moulton, of Brighton, and they served
the Society very well for many years.
It was considered desirable to invent a name to denote 4 a person
interested in the keeping and breeding of birds '. Such persons had
previously been known as 4 Bird Fanciers ', a term which included
those who kept any kind of bird, domestic or otherwise. The term
' Aviculturist ' being analogous to 4 Horticulturist ', seemed to fill the
bill, and we read, 4 Unless any one will suggest a better name we
beg to subscribe ourselves 44 Aviculturists " \
There were several societies connected with birds and bird-keeping
which existed for the purpose of holding meetings to discuss their
problems, but there was also a large number of persons scattered
about the country, though too far separated to meet often. It was
therefore felt that a magazine managed by experts on the subject
who would be prepared to advise members both in print and by
means of the post, would be a great help. So it was decided to start
the first number of what was to be called the 4 Avicultural
Magazine ', although with a membership of only 52, but the funds
for the first year were generously guaranteed by Mr. Fillmer. He
wrote that the Society must be self-supporting after October, 1895,
and he would not be satisfied until the membership was up to 200.
Queries were answered by what was then the penny post, and the
more interesting of these published with the answers in the Magazine.
The object of the Society was the study of Foreign and British
Birds ; poultry, pigeons, and Canaries being outside its scope. The
subscription for the first year was five shillings with an entrance fee
of two-and-sixpence, but in 1899 this had to be raised to seven shillings
and sixpence, and in 1900 to ten shillings. Even this was cheap
enough, considering the Magazine was published every month.
Although the holding of shows was never an object of the Society
and not encouraged, reports of the more important of these were
regularly published in the Magazine, and very good reports they

generally were, written by such authorities as Reginald Phillipps,
H. R. Fillmer, C. S. Simpson, and others.
By the end of its second year the membership had increased to 173,
and included such names as J. L. Bonhote, O. E. Cresswell, Rev. C. D.
Farrar, Frank Finn, E. G. B. Meade-Waldo and W. Swaysland.
At the end of his second year of Secretaryship, Dr. Simpson found
the time occupied by his medical work made it impossible for him
to continue and relinquished the post. He had successfully seen
the Society through its teething troubles, and now handed it over
to his friend and colleague, H. R. Fillmer, who also became Editor
of the Magazine. He certainly carried out the work well, and to him
must go most of the credit of having made the Society.
Volume III (Nov., 1896-Oct., 1897) was considerably enlarged,
the number of members having risen to well over the 200 mark, and
four coloured plates from original drawings by F. W. Frohawk were
issued. These were hand-coloured, a very usual process in coloured
illustrations of birds in those days. And there were two very nice
drawings, in monochrome, by H. D. Astley.
From now on the Magazine went ahead, increasing in size with every
volume, and the quality of the articles and illustrations was excellent.
In 1899, Mr. Fillmer resigned from his post of Honorary Secretary,
for which most at least of the members were very sorry as he had done
so much for the Society. He had put forward a plan for the enlarge-
ment of the scope of the Magazine by including domestic birds such
as canaries, but his proposal met with very strong opposition and no
support, which apparently distressed him considerably. Many years
later he was made an Honorary Member and Vice-President of the
Society.
And now a few words about some of the principal aviculturists of
those days, most of whom I could claim as valued friends.
I think the first I met, and it was in November, 1894, was J. B.
Housden, who lived in Sydenham. He possessed some large aviaries,
and used to breed a number of Australian Crested Doves, a species
I was greatly taken with at the time, as well as some of the Australian
parrakeets, while in a small aviary in one corner I well remember a
very fine pair of Great Eagle-Owls with two young almost as large
as themselves. After showing me his birds, Mr. Housden took from
his pocket what looked like a small pamphlet which he said he thought
would interest me, as it was the first number of a new publication
called the Avicultural Magazine, published by a new Society he
thought I might like to join. I was much interested, and asked him
to propose me as a member, which he did, though I just missed being
actually an Original Member.
Housden lived almost outside the gates of the Crystal Palace where,
at the great shows held there, he won many prizes for his birds.

Not far from him lived Dr. A. G. Butler, who was on the staff of
the Natural History Museum, though in the Entomological Depart-
ment. His hobby was aviculture, and he kept a fairly large number
of foreign birds in cages and loose in a bird room, though later he
built a large open-air aviary in his garden. His book, Foreign Finches
in Captivity , illustrated by Frohawk, is now long out of print, but he
wrote several other books and many articles in the Magazine.
Reginald Phillipps, at the time an elderly, white-bearded and
charming man, lived in a small house in the Hammersmith district,
and it was always a pleasure to visit him and his very charming wife,
as he was very keen and knowledgeable on all matters avicultural.
He kept a large number of foreign birds, mostly rare species, and was
very successful in breeding them. His back garden was not very
large, but the whole of it was completely wired over, the garden walls
forming the sides of the aviary which was divided into two parts,
the further half grown into a dense jungle. The half nearest to the
house was connected with one of the rooms, probably originally the
drawing-room, now forming the covered part of the aviary. It contained
also several cages where new arrivals would rest until considered fit
to be let out. Amongst his outstanding successes were the breeding
of the Australian Blue Wren and Regent Bower Bird, neither of
which had been bred elsewhere in captivity.
Phillipps was a very fruitful contributor to the Magazine, his articles
being complete and explicit in every detail. He later took over the
Secretaryship of the Society.
On the retirement of Fillmer from the Secretaryship in 1899, the
post was taken by J. L. Bonhote, while O. E. Cresswell became Editor.
Bonhote when he joined the Society soon after its foundation, was
an undergraduate at Cambridge and a student of Professor Alfred
Newton from whom he, no doubt, acquired much of his keenness for
British birds. He later kept many, especially concentrating upon
waterfowl, in the hybridizing of which he obtained much valuable
information as to their affinity towards one another. He wrote a very
good book on British birds.
O. E. Cresswell, of Morney Cross, Hereford, specialized chiefly in
foreign doves and parrakeets, though keeping many other birds as well.
E. G. B. Meade-Waldo and W. H. St. Quintin were, I think, cousins,
the one living at one time in Hampshire, later at his family seat,
Stonewall Park, Edenbridge, the other at Scampston Hall, York-
shire. Both were excellent all-round naturalists as well as keen
aviculturists. Meade-Waldo kept rather unusual birds such as Sand
Grouse, Trumpeter Bullfinches, and Teydean Chaffinches, which he
had himself captured in his travels in North Africa and the Canary
Islands ; and he kept also a number of owls of various kinds as well
as other predatory birds. He introduced Mandarin Ducks to some

ponds in his woods where they bred and increased as wild birds ;
and he was partly responsible for the introduction of the Little Owl,
and showed me with much pride a nest of young in an apple tree
stump in his orchard.
St. Quintin kept in his park a large collection of rare waterfowl,
Great Bustards, and Cranes, as well as, in large aviaries, Ravens,
Little Bustards, and Waxwings, while under more protection there
were the smaller foreigners, Gouldians, Parrot Finches, and Painted
Quails. These two naturalists were fast friends, keeping careful diaries
of all country happenings, and exchanging their experiences by almost
daily correspondence. I wish their diaries could have been published
as they would have been worthy successors to that of Gilbert White.
The Rev. C. D. Farrar was Vicar of Micklefield, in Yorkshire, and
possessed a very large garden aviary in which he seems to have bred
almost everything he tried, and he managed to winter even the smallest
successfully without artificial warmth. He was a prolific writer, but
his articles often led to heated controversies, to the distraction of the
Editor. When I was Editor later on, I had trouble with Mr. Farrar, and
he wrote asking if he might call and see me, to which I readily agreed.
From his previous writing one might have thought that this burly
Yorkshireman, standing over six feet tall, might be quite dangerous,
but, on the contrary, he was as gentle as a lamb and, in fact, quite
charming. We parted the best of friends.
Then there was Frank Finn, at that time Deputy Superintendent of
the Indian Museum at Calcutta, a man with a great knowledge of
birds in general and Indian birds in particular. He wrote several
books on birds, and possessed the most remarkable memory. And I
must not forget Miss Rosie Alderson, an authority on foreign doves,
who helped much in those early days of the Society.
Such is a brief outline of the foundation and early years of the
Society. The last years of the nineteenth century. Fifty-four years
ago. There were certainly some excellent aviculturists in those years,
perhaps more who actually kept birds in any numbers than now, but
I think there are probably more now who are interested in birds, even
if they are too busy to keep them. In those days the Society held no
meetings, not even of the Council, so it was difficult for the members
to get to know one another. Now the Society holds regular meetings
of Council, and we have the Aviculturists' Club which is a wonderful
means of bringing the members together, as well as adding to their
numbers."

ban on importation imposed in 1930. The raising, for nearly a year,
of this embargo in 1953, permitted the influx of a number of Asiatic,
South American and African species, but very few Australians came in.
The least said about the manner in which these birds were imported
the better. Thus, apart from these importations, the majority of the
birds in our aviaries and zoological collections originate from well
established home-bred stock. In all there are at least a hundred and
fifty species or more represented, of which I have been able to obtain
coloured photographs of a hundred or so and now propose to show
you a selection from these.
Following Peters' Classification, of the six Sub-families of Parrots,
three can be dealt with instantly, as we have only one representative,
namely the Kea of the second Sub-family, the Nestors. The first,
the Owl Parrots or Strigopinae are no longer in the country, and the
third, the Pygmy Parrots or Micropsittime, have never reached our
shores alive : I believe the nearest success was by Goodfellow as long-
ago as 1908. Returning to the Kea, a specimen is exhibited in the
London Zoo, and of course, Mr. Sidney Porter, who made avicultural
history by breeding these birds in 1947, still has some of them, and I
believe is still hopeful of repeating his success. He is most emphatic
that these are most intelligent and endearing birds, in spite of all that
has been attributed to them.
The Loriinae, which scientifically should be between the Nestors
and the Pygmy Parrots, are mostly only found as single birds, or at
least without any real breeding facilities. This picture is of a
Chattering Lory, but there are also several Purple-capped, Black-
capped, Black, Yellow-backed, Violet-necked, and possibly others.
Among the Lorikeets are Swainson's and Forsten's, both of which
have potentialities as breeders. Also there are Red-collared, Ornate
and Scaly-breasted pairs. At Whipsnade is an exhibit labelled Green-
naped, but I believe this is really Mitchell's or Edwards's. Well known,
too, on the show bench are a pair of rare Musschenbroek's which
were once in the Duke of Bedford's collection, but apparently
unsatisfactory as breeders.
The next sub-family of Cockatoos is well represented, although few
are accorded breeding conditions. The first picture is of a Banksian
cock who has a hen in the Parrot House, but no aviary and nest
box to try with. There are also examples of the Palm Cockatoo,
Funereal or Yellow-tailed Black, and in the Coronation Collection
are a pair of Baudiivs or White-tailed Black Cockatoos which have
only been in this country once before, about forty years ago, and a
point should be made to see these birds whilst here.
There are at least two pairs of Gang-Gangs which are regular
breeders. I believe Mrs. Clark has two pairs now. There are several
Roseates, the picture shows an albino hen and her normal mate,

taken last year at Woburn. There are also a number of these in the
Coronation Collection.
Among the white Cockatoos we have specimens of the Moluccan,
or Salmon-crested, Triton, Blue-eyed, Slender-billed, and Bare-eyed ;
there is at least one true pair of Great White Cockatoos belonging to
Pat Maxwell at Whipsnade, but their skill and ability as wire cutters
make them a difficult subject to be kept in large breeding quarters.
There are many Sulphur-crests of the Greater, Lesser, and a few of
the Timor species, but few people can provide the space or a sufficiently
strong aviary to permit breeding ; some however do. There are quite a
few good breeding pairs of Leadbeater's which is probably the loveliest
of them all. During the relaxation of the ban some Citron-crested or
Orange-crested pairs were imported, and efforts are being made to
induce these to breed. Of the smaller species we have some Goffin's
and Ducorp's, but so far as I know none of these are potential breeding
pairs.
The prolific Cockatiel has maintained its numbers by being bred
in aviaries for generations. Our established stock compared very
favourably with the few imported specimens I saw.
Macaws again are large birds which few can accommodate in
strong breeding quarters, and most specimens are zoological exhibits,
such as the Scarlet or Red and Yellow, the Greenwing or Red and
Blue, Blue and Yellow, Hyacinthine, Lear's. Attempts are made
annually to rear some of these birds, but success is seldom attained ;
it is peculiar that whenever a large Macaw does succeed, it is nearly
always a hybrid youngster. Apart from the birds illustrated, we have
specimens also of Military, Severe, and Spix. Among the smaller
species there are pairs of Illiger's and Nobles which are being given
breeding opportunities. My own Nobles have bred every year since
their initial effort, and there must be a number of potential breeders
about.
The position over Conures is rather indefinite. With the exception
of Mrs. Clark's Queen of Bavaria's, breeding stocks as such are still
non-existent. A number were imported, but seem to have almost
disappeared without gaining any footing. Although there are a
number of old specimens still surviving in zoos such as Blue-crowned,
Red-masked, Black-masked, etc., a few of the latter were imported
along with some Jendayas, Half-moon or Golden-crowned. Then
a number of St. Thomas were imported which were in fact not the rare
species from that island, but the Yellow-cheeked from Guiana. These
have not been bred, but efforts are being made to start them. There
are also a few Cactus and related species. A few of the delightful
little Pyrrhura Conures were also sent over, and it will be a great
misfortune if we cannot establish the Red-bellied and White-eared.
Mr. Prestwich has a small nucleus of the former which reared three

young last year, and in my own aviaries last year the latter hatched
two young, which died when about five weeks old, and were still
rather under-developed. This year they have also been disturbed
by uninvited visitors, but they are trying again.
The few Patagonian Conures seem to have been unfortunate, and
one definite pair at Whipsnade made a neat little hole in the roof of
their flight and were never seen or heard of again. Possibly only
two or three pairs are left, and so far they have not been reared.
I have no photograph yet of the Lineolated Parrakeet bred last
season for the first time by Mr. Prestwich, who now has a small stud
of these delightful little birds and hopes to repeat his success.
Three species of Parrotlet were imported, the Blue-wing, Guiana
and the Turquoise-rumped. These birds do not breed readily here,
and we have never been able to start strains such as Mr. Enehjelm
has done in Finland. A few pairs actually reared families, but there
seems little likelihood of strains being firmly founded. The cock
illustrated nested twice indoors with a hen in my aviaries, but no
young were hatched, and the hen died on eggs before she was turned
out into an outdoor flight as originally intended.
The Brotogerys genus came over in quite good numbers, par-
ticularly Can ary-wings. Odd White-wings and All Green turned up,
and one consignment contained four Gold-wings which are probably
the first and only importation of these birds into England. Mr. Prest-
wich is trying out these birds this year.
Pionus Parrots were also among the birds brought over as single
specimens, and included Maximilian's, Red-vented, Sordid, but none
of them took kindly to captivity, and few are still living. The only
record of these birds breeding here is of the White-capped hand-reared
by Mr. Yealland some years ago.
Amazon Parrots also arrived, but so far only the Blue-fronted have
been bred and a hybrid Blue-front X Yellow-cheek. Breeding pairs
(potential) are at present being kept in Blue-fronts, Yellow-cheek,
Cuban and Yellow-fronts. There are several odd specimens of other
species kept as pets which might one day be bred from. There are,
for instance, several Orange-winged, Salvins, Salles, Red-topped,
Green-cheeked, Festive, Mealy, to name a few.
Of the delightful little Caiques, pairs of both White-bellied and
Black-headed came in. Whether these will eventually breed is of
course highly speculative, but they are being given the chance to do
so, as also are a pair of Hawk-headed.
From Africa we have a number of Senegal Parrots, including
one or two of the Red-bellied variety. In the Zoo is a very nice

possibly the only one ever imported. The Meyer's and Riippell's are
also represented in zoos.
Although there are many African Greys, probably there are less
than a half dozen pairs from which serious attempts are being made
to breed. Of course a few Timneh are also here, although their fond
owners are possibly quite unaware that it is any different to the
hundreds of other Greys.
At Whipsnade, Pat Maxwell has kept the only specimen of Pesquet's
Parrot in good health and condition for nearly two years. Quite a
friendly bird if unusual.
There is at least one pair of Red-sided Eclectus which gained for
Mr. Indge the medal last ye.ar for being a first breeding. These birds
have now changed ownership, but I understand they are still trying
to breed again. I was only able to get the hen to pose for me.
The Asiatic Psittacula are well represented, mostly with well
established breeding strains in the Ringneck of which I have only one
photo of the normal bird, a hen, here shown with a lutino cock.
A better illustration of the lutino cock follows. Then there are the
blue birds which the late Duke had gone far to establishing. This
pair are still immature, being only two years old, but the following
illustration is of an adult cock taken last year at Woburn. Here I
was also able to get a picture of a yellow plumhead cock, not a lutino,
although there is one of these at Keston. There are quite a number
of possible breeders, although they are not very reliable regularly in
this direction.
My own success with the Moustache last year has unhappily
not been repeated. Experience has proved they are exceedingly
prone to pneumonia and the original pair have died. Others are still
trying to breed from good pairs, however. There are also a few
Alexandrine's and Layard's, and at least one Long-tailed and a hen
Malabar. One or two pairs of Derbyans, too.
Princess of Wales' are well established, and we were able to
reinforce our stock with a few imported specimens. Only a few pairs
of Rock Peplars and Barraband's are still here, but at least some of
these breed regularly.
We still have a few pairs of Crimson-wings, and there are two cocks
at least of the Timor Island variety, this one is in the Zoo here.
I believe there are only two pairs of the lovely Green-wing Kings *
left. One breeds fairly regularly at the Zoo, and our President has
a pair : my own died over a year ago of old age. Most of the Kings
are old birds, but again we were able to get a few of these magnificent
birds over recently.
* On the visit to Foxwarren on Saturday, 19th June, we were able to see two pairs
of Green-wing Kings at the President's Garden Party, one of which had two youngsters
on the point of fledging.

Ihere are two of the Malay Blue-rumped Parrots in the country,
unfortunately both are males. This bird seldom is imported, and
appears to be difficult to acclimatize yet easy to keep once accustomed
to captivity.
The Lo\ ebirds ought to be safely established considering the
numbers of Fischer's and Masked that were brought in. I wonder if
they are. The Red-faced, of course, has not yet been bred in captivity
in spite of near successes. This is a colony of some thirty birds with
which Mr. Prestwich is trying to accomplish this difficult task. There
are not a lot of Peach-faced, but several pairs are now rearing
regularly. Several Fischer's have been bred, but not as many as
should have been, when one considers the numbers that came in.
The same lemark applies to Masked, and we now have quite a few of
the blue variety, although these do not appear to relish this climate,
and who can blame them after this year's effort at summer. The
Duke had a few Nyasas, including a lutino cock. Only green birds
have been reared so far here, but we are still trying. A few Abyssinian
pairs exist, there are no M^adagascars or Black-cheek. Swindern's have
never been imported.
The Hanging Parrots are not very popular as aviary subjects. The
Vernal came in in quite considerable numbers, but were not good
sellers, and the dealers soon dropped them, besides which they are
not likely to breed. The lovely little Blue-crowned also reached us,
but only cocks.
This brings us to the Australian Broadtails, which have been well
established as home bred stock for many years. Fresh blood has been
acquired recently, and we have pretty good stocks. Unfortunately,
when the ban was lifted, I concentrated on the rarer species, and
disposed of many of my old Rosellas, now difficult to replace with
birds of the same reliable standard. However, we have several fine
Pennant's, Golden-mantles, Stanley's, and Mealies. Brown's
are rare, and seldom reliable breeders. There are also one or two
pairs of Bauer's and several good Barnard's.
The Red-capped or Pileated Parrot, called Western King in
Australia, seems to be on the way to developing a strain at Keston,
one pair having reared almost twenty young. Others are now trying
their hand with this lovely bird.
Blue-bonnets are almost non-existent now. I had a pair of Yellow-
vented, but the hen died soon after importation, and these two
Narethas from the Duke's collection are both hens and probably
the only ones ever imported.
The Red-rumps are pretty well established, and many good birds
are reared annually. The yellow variety does not seem to be doing so
well lately. Many-colours breed fairly well here, and again their

blood has been reinforced. There is a pair of Hooded, but unfortu-
nately they are not together.
Of the Grass Parrakeets, Bourkes have been well established for
years. These also have had a few newly imported specimens. Elegants
are also well established with a limited number of breeders. Turquoi-
sines have been re-established, and given reasonable good fortune
these should be on the increase soon. The same applies to Splendids,
although I would like to see more of these birds in the country, as our
stocks are exceedingly low.
That I think records the position of the Parrot-like birds in England
to-day, and it goes without saying that the Budgerigar, the last
of the family to be mentioned, will most probably manage to hold
its own as an aviary bred species ! "

" At the invitation of the Board of Commissioners of Agriculture and
Forestry of the Territory of Hawaii, the Wildfowl Trust agreed to
take an active part in the attempt to save the Ne-ne or Hawaiian
Goose, Branta sandvicencis, from imminent extinction. In 1951, only
thirty-two individuals were known to be surviving. Up to this time
the Hawaiian Goose in the wild state had occurred, so far as is known,
only on the island of Hawaii, with the exception of a few isolated records
on neighbouring islands. Less than a century ago 25,000 of these birds
are believed to have existed, and the diminution is thought to be due to !
several causes, besides their destruction by the islanders for food, during
the flightless moulting period. In addition to feral cats, dogs, and pigs,
the mongoose, which was introduced to kill the rats that were damaging
the sugar cane, helped to decrease the numbers of all ground nesting
birds by destroying nests, eggs, and young. The few remaining geese
which are still in the wild state have been seen on the slopes of the
13,700 feet volcano Mauna Loa and its neighbour Hualalai. These
lava slopes are in general character a kind of moorland--moss and
lichen covered rocks, a few trees, various grasses and other plants,
some of them bearing berries which are eaten by the geese, a favourite
being the Ohelo --Vaccinium reticulatum. Here and there the lava is
impervious enough to hold water, so that there are some shallow pools,
but no large areas of water.
In 1950 the Trust sent its Curator, Mr. John Yealland, to Hawaii
in order to advise and assist in the establishment of a breeding station
for propagating Ne-nes at Pohakuloa in Hawaii. Mr. Yealland

successfully raised a brood. On his return to England he brought
a couple of Ne-nes as a gift from Mr. Herbert Shipman, of Hfio,
to whose interest the species owes its existence to-day. Both of these
laid eggs in March, 1951. A gander was at once flown from Hawaii,
and during the breeding season of 1952, nine young Ne-ne goslings
hatched, all of which survived. In the same year three were raised
at Pohakuloa, and the total number of birds known to exist was
foit\-six. In 1953 a further four goslings hatched at Slimbridge,
and were successfully reared. This year, 1954, five goslings hatched,
but only four have survived. Unfortunately one adult died, and
two young birds which were lent to another breeder were poisoned
by a disastrous accident, so the present total at the Wildfowl Trust
is se\ enteen, a quarter of the world population of these birds, which
is at present believed to be sixty-eight.
THE HIGH ANDES
(.Illustrated by colour film)
Early in 1953, my wife and I made an ornithological expedition
to South America. The first part of it was spent in the extreme south
of Chile and the Argentine--the southern tip of Patagonia, and the
island of Tierra del Fuego. The second half was spent on the Andean
Plateau of Bolivia, not far south of the equator. Before leaving Buenos
Aires we were able, in the nearby marshes, to study and film that
obscure but interesting bird the Black-headed Duck, Heteronetta
atricapilla, which is parasitic, laying its eggs in the nests of Coots,
Night Herons, and Ibises. From Argentina we flew up into Bolivia,
whose capital La Paz is 13,000 feet above sea-level, and from here we
went by rail past the famous pre-Inca ruins of Tiahuanaco, to the
port of Guaqui on Lake Titicaca.
The bird life of this lake is especially rich and interesting, because
many of the forms are confined to the puna district or altiplano , although
closely related to lowland species. These subspecies tend to be
larger than their counterparts. The commonest ducks on the lake
are the Puna Teal, the Sharp-winged Teal, and the Peruvian Stifftail.
M e also saw the Giant Coot, many Grebes, Cormorants, Night Herons,
and waders, including Wilson's Phalarope on migration from North
America. Some of the ducks were moulting and flightless, and we
were able to catch a small number of Puna Teal and Sharpwings
from a boat by dipping them out of the clear water with a home-made
aet when they dived. These birds are now established in the Trust's
enclosures in Gloucestershire, and the Sharpwings have nested.
I he main objective of this journey in Bolivia, however, was to see
the beautiful Torrent Duck, Merganetta armata, which lives in the
waterfalls of the Andean streams. For this purpose we travelled
aver a high pass near the great mountain Huaina Potosi (where on

a lake at 16,000 feet we saw a flock of Andean Geese), and down into
the Valley of the Zongo, which finally drains into the Amazon.
This valley is accessible because of a hydro-electric scheme, and it
was in the River Zongo that we finally came upon a group of five
Bolivian Torrent Ducks, M. armata garleppi. Although they could
not be filmed at very close range, their behaviour was carefully studied,
and hitherto unrecorded details of display and voice were noted.
The films show the swimming capacities of these birds in the white
water of the torrents, and some features of the display. They are
believed to be the first colour films ever taken of this little known
and fascinating bird."

" In this very short lecture I intend to give you a general idea of how
Bird Protection has developed in Belgium in the last few years.
But allow me first of all to thank you for your kind invitation to
address the Avicultural Society on the occasion of its Diamond
Jubilee. Please do not consider it as a mere complimentary phrase,
when I tell you that your invitation made me feel very much flattered.
I am glad to be here among friends who are in full support of an
ideal, for which we still have to fight the first battle in my country.
The celebration by your Avicultural Society of an imposing Diamond
Jubilee proves that the subject of Bird Protection is not new in Britain.
In Belgium it is only a growing idea and a very topical question at
this very moment. This is the reason why I have chosen Bird
Protection in Belgium 5 as subject for the speech I was asked to
deliver here.
On Sunday, 13th July, just a few days ago, the ' Belgian Society
for Bird Sanctuaries 5 inaugurated its very first bird sanctuary.
This took place with a certain solemnity in the presence of repre-
sentatives of several Ministers, the Lord-Lieutenant, many prominent
people, and an attendance of more than one thousand enthusiasts.
This was the second year that the ' Union of Societies for Nature
Conservation ' succeeded in organizing what we call ' The National
Nature Conservation Day ', and we were glad to be able to offer the
public a new nature reserve rather than words and speeches.
Members of the Press and of broadcast and the film journals were
present, and have helped enormously in the promotion of nature
reserves all over the country.
An intensive propaganda campaign has been launched during these
last months. We cherish the hope that this will improve public
opinion and will result in a better protection of nature, a protection
of the animal habitats, and an increase of bird sanctuaries.

I expect you are wondering at the excitement in Belgium over so
simple a thing as the very first small bird sanctuary, purchased by
a Society.
I have a map of Britain, nicely dotted to mark the numerous and
well managed bird sanctuaries, and I know we are shamefully behind
in Belgium. This explains the stir over the event.
The idea of ' bird protection ' has been successfully realized in
/our country for many years, and whenever a new bird sanctuary
is added to your long list, it is quite a normal thing, a familiar event
Df little account !
However, conditions are quite different in Belgium, and it may
be of some interest to you to sketch in rough outline the struggle for
nature conservation in Belgium. First I will try to show you what
the situation was three years ago, when the Belgian Society for Bird
Sanctuaries was founded ; next I will do my best to give you an idea
Df the present state of affairs and a glimpse of our prospects for the
near future.
There has always been a great number of ornithologists all over
Belgium : amateurs, bird watchers, semi-scientific workers, reporting
npon migration and nesting, and ringing birds. Some of them
:o-operated with the Royal Institute of Natural History, others with
Dur bird journals, De Wielewaal and Le Gerfaut , two publications that
tre evidence of their enthusiasm. There were also a considerable
lumber of unambitious individual bird-watchers for whom wild
nird life was just a thing of interest and who never decided to tackle a
;pecial problem.
These ornithologists recorded a steady decrease in both number
md variety of many Belgian birds, and noticed the disappearance
)f several species from our country. They constantly called public
ittention to the urgent necessity of improving the actual Bird Pro-
ection Acts, and of supporting the conservation of wild animals and
ilants by protecting the very last natural wood-, marsh-, moor-, and
:oastland in our overpopulated land.
On the other hand, bird-catching has always been a deplorable
lobby of the lower classes in Belgium, and too many politicians, who
tick to their mandate, are afraid of alienating their electors by voting
my new Bird Protection Bill.
iNot one of our successive governments ever made a serious attempt
o vote any funds for nature conservation nor for the protection of wild
*lants and animals in their natural habitat, and owners of natural
andscapes can still spoil them as much as they like, for there is no
ct to put a stop to such vandalism.
In the meantime private societies for the protection of nature and
lonuments were created, and did their utmost to call attention
d the urgent necessity for action, but they were voices crying in the

wilderness. Local authorities and ministers pretended to listen kindly !
and attentively, promised to do their utmost, but never took any action.
The government never considered the purchase of nature reserves.
Eventually these societies came to the conclusion that there remained
only one, but rather expensive, solution : to try to collect the money
and purchase the menaced natural landscapes !
These societies for protection of nature deserve our warmest grati-
tude. Their sphere of action, however, is very large, and moreover
they are so much pressed for money that they have had to limit their
activities. They really did their very best to promote nature protection,
but it only resulted in unsuccessful protests in the papers and in
government circles.
The International Congress of Ornithology of 1950, in Upsala,
indirectly brought a change for the better in this sad situation. Those
Belgian ornithologists present suggested the foundation of a special
society for the protection of nature, which would concentrate all
activities on bird protection.
Architect Jan Jacobs actively pushed on the work, and he was
assisted by Leon Lippens, an all-round experienced man, a first-rate
ornithologist and a man whose voice carries weight. In 1951 the
' Belgian Society for Bird Sanctuaries 5 was founded. Through the
kind offices of Dr. Rene Verheyen, the Society was invited by Dr. Van
Straelen, president of the National Parks in the Belgian Congo, to
establish the seat of the young society under the same roof.
This brought a sudden rise in prestige. A few weeks later,
H.M. Queen Elisabeth of Belgium granted her high protection to
the Society. Her Majesty invited Dr. Koch, who is well known in
Britain, to make gramophone records of the bird-song in the Royal
Park of Laeken, near Brussels. A copy of this beautiful collection
of records, accompanied by a well illustrated handbook, has been
sent by Her Majesty to many schools, and the remaining records are
sold for the profit of a charitable institution.
So the new society started with good prospects and high hopes.
It may be of some interest to relate the experience gained since 1951
and the results obtained.
Three years ago the Society still laboured under the delusion that
a nice pamphlet could do wonders, that it would be able to draw
government attention upon the shameful state of affairs, that print
could awake public opinion, and that automatically thousands of
enthusiasts would join and pay a small contribution to defray the
costs of administration.
The pamphlet looked nice. It was a cry of alarm from end to end,
and especially drew attention to the fact:--
--that in the moorlands : Ruff, Tawny Pipit, Black Grouse, Curlew,

--that in the polderlands, along the low rivers : Black-winged Stilt,
Avocet, and Oyster-catcher were becoming scarce ;
--that in the marshes : the Bittern, and the Little Bittern were in
danger;

disappeared.
Twenty thousand of these pamphlets were distributed throughout
the country in 1951. They were sent to friends, teachers, doctors,
lawyers, readers of ornithological journals, etc. The result was
disheartening. Public opinion was not ripe, and the total amount
of subscriptions collected hardly paid the expenses of printing and
postal charges !
In the meantime we grew aware of the fact that the little group of
active members did not increase. Six people had to carry the load,
and among the members not even a seventh bird-lover could be
found to spare time to help the Society by practical co-operation.
At this very critical moment the Society by chance secured the
valuable help of Mr. Herberigs, a very active ornithologist, who is at
present the delegate of the Society. He was not afraid of paying an
endless number of annoying visits to people all over the country who
might possibly join. These interviews proved to be a success, and in
1952 a change to another method of collecting subscriptions was made.
Instead of trying to gain a vast number of ordinary members, efforts
were concentrated upon securing an increase of protecting members,
who pay annually 1,000 F. and up.
This new method succeeded wonderfully with the help of
Mr. Herberigs' persuasive power, and soon a considerable number
of protecting members joined.
About that time circumstances were such as to be favourable to
the idea of nature reserves ; one of those psychological moments
which are very difficult to explain, but which could be expected just
then, as the papers had done their very utmost to support and push
the idea. The leading part was taken in the country by the ' Friends
of the River Ourthe ' who tried to prevent the construction of a
barrage, that would spoil the most beautiful valley of the Ardennes
(a battle, which I regret to say, they lost !)--by ' The Friends of the
Foret de Soignes, south of Brussels, through which the government
planned to build an autostrade or main motor-road--by Mr. Leon
Lippens, who drew the attention upon the beautiful coastal area
' Het Zwin ' after the inundation of 1953--and by the 4 Society
for the Protection of Nature and Historical Monuments ' which
supported the conservation of a large moorland north of Antwerp.
The stream of preservation propaganda was given enough force to
arouse public opinion from apathy, and in two years the Belgian

<bodyText confidence="0.999182088888889" page_id="58091203"  page_num="Page 120" year="" vol="">
public became interested in the question as a result of all the publicity
that had been given.
I do not know how politicians behave in Britain, but the leaders
of the people in Belgium often prefer to follow the track of their voters
instead of guiding them. But as things are at present, politicians can no
longer ignore such ideas as protection of nature and bird sanctuaries.
There is good hope that they will soon show their voters that they
are still following the crowd, and that they will prove to the govern-
ment that they can keep abreast with general opinion.
All this contributed to create a favourable atmosphere in 1953 for
the activity of the Belgian Society for Bird Sanctuaries. About that
time a marshland called ' Snepkensvijver ', beautifully situated
along a main road, was going to be parcelled out for building summer
houses. This splendid natural breeding place for many birds would
disappear for ever, and once again the authorities did not move.
The Society forced the issue. Within a few weeks, 1,000,000 F.
(about #7,15*) was collected by means of a very few subscriptions,
ranging between 1,000 and 100,000 F. This put the Society in a
position to buy the land, and so become owner of its first bird sanctuary.
We still very much regret that the new Bird Protection Bill to
restrict bird catching, which was brought in by the three political
parties, was rejected in 1952* If the same bill had been introduced
a few years later, the same assembly would certainly have voted for it,
because public opinion is at present much more in favour of the
question.
The actual problem of bird protection in Belgium can be summarized
as follows :--
During the last two years a successful attempt has been made to
influence and educate public opinion about nature preservation and
the protection of wild animals. The population now expects some
practical results.
The Belgian Society for Bird Sanctuaries by chance started its
activities at the right moment. In three years 800 members joined
the Society, and the total annual contributions amount to 200,000 F.
(more than #1,300).
The first bird sanctuary in Belgium was ' De Zegge ', a marshland
of 35 Ha. The Royal Zoological Society of Antwerp purchased the
land for the purpose of establishing it as a bird sanctuary, and acted
in close co-operation with the Belgian Society for Bird Sanctuaries,
which manages this natural reserve.
Thanks to the zeal of Mr. Leon Lippens, who collected nearly all
the money, the Belgian Society for Bird Sanctuaries was able to
purchase 4 Snepkensvijver ', a marshland of 50 acres.
About sixty private estates have been declared as bird sanctuaries,
and the owners co-operate fully with the Society.

All these quick and rather spectacular successes, however, do not
produce the results that ornithologists might expect. The sanctuaries
are badly managed, and there is still a serious lack of supervision,
and too few investigations are made. This is because the number of
our members, who really do co-operate and take an interest in practical
field work is far too small.
It therefore has been decided to put a stop to declaring new estates
as bird sanctuaries, till we shall have a larger staff of trained co-
operators.
The actual private bird sanctuaries are still badly organized, but
we want to follow the British example, and hope to be able to attack
the problem squarely and well. We started with the protection of
nesting areas of rare species, and we are advising landowners and
training gamekeepers ; we give information to bird watchers on
useful subjects for research and investigation, and publish an annual
Bulletin, etc.
I fear the very short film I am going to show you will not come up
to your expectations. It has all been done in a hurry. We even had
no time to complete the film with some pictures of real interest to
ornithologists. This year spring was very late in Belgium, as was
perhaps the case in Britain too. We had to wait till last week to film
a few interesting nests, and I regret to say that the copies arrived too
late to be inserted in this film. A film which claims to be about bird
protection ought at least to show some rare nesting breeding birds,
and I offer my apologies.
Please remember too, that we were pressed to produce a film on
bird protection for the Belgian public. We know that our own
people are critical on the subject of films, and we would rather show
them high standard films, but as these require much time and money,
we think it is better policy in Belgium at the moment to produce
something that is not perfect, rather than nothing at all.
We must go on beating the drum every day, even when there is
a hole in the drum and the drumsticks are broken. It is the big
push that people expect now.
This method would not be suitable for Britain, so please try to
understand this, and excuse the gaps in the film. "
Mr. Van den bergh then showed the film which included pictures
of the bird sanctuary " De Zegge ", a marsh owned by the Royal
Zoological Society of Antwerp, in winter. The water was quite
overgrown with vegetation, and the film showed how some open water
was obtained and so the territory made more suitable for water-birds.
Nest-boxes were made in schools, and the boys offered them in
May to the Director of the County Park, which was declared a bird
sanctuary.

was purchased by the Belgian Society for Bird Sanctuaries, were taken
in winter, others in spring. Attempts were successfully made here
to improve the conditions for the very large breeding population of
birds in this rather small area. More than one thousand Black-
headed Gulls are breeding here this year. The white cloud of birds
circling over their breeding-place is a very impressive sight. Besides
this great number of breeding gulls, forty-eight other species of birds
were breeding in the same habitat, and Mr. Van den bergh said he
regretted that he could not show some of them. The Bittern and its
nest was filmed, but this was not ready in time to be included.
Mr. Van den bergh then said :--
" From all this we may conclude, that Bird Protection in Belgium
has not passed its teething troubles.
The first obstacles, and most heavy ones, have been removed.
New members join every day.
No doubt, many of them will grow to active co-operators, who
will turn bird protection into a reality.
Britain showed the way. We follow in her footsteps."
The meeting adjourned at 4 p.m. for tea in the Library of the
Zoological Society, and later a sherry party was given by the Editor
of the Avicultural Magazine, Miss Barclay-Smith, at her house.
The meetings were resumed on Friday morning, 18th June, at
10.30 a.m., when Mr. G. T. lies , Superintendent, Belle Vue (Man-
chester) Zoological Gardens, showed a colour film entitled " Fine
Feathers ". Mr. lies gave a running commentary as he showed his
film, which depicted beautifully plumaged birds in the Belle Vue Zoo,
with other bird scenes from Cleres and Vincennes. The film ended
with a sequence in lighter vein, which showed the various ways in
which feathers are utilized, beginning with the wonderful head-
dress of the Red Indian.
The following papers were then contributed, illustrated with
lantern slides :--

We have been able to place a number of the birds in American
and European Zoos as well as the Agricultural Department of the
University of California. We feel especially hopeful of saving this
rare bird, by placing any large surplus of these birds in the collections
of some of the most successful game bird breeders of California and
south-western United States where they are removed from the public
contacts and other difficulties which face those who maintain public
exhibits.
I am happy to report that those we sent to European collections,
especially at Cleres and Rotterdam, are doing well and promise to
provide specimens for European Zoos and breeders, and we feel that
we have been more than justified in resorting to the expediency of
artificial insemination in our efforts to insure the continuance of this
magnificent bird, at least in captivity."
Mrs. Benchley showed slides of the adult birds, the egg, chick just
hatching, and a series of the chick at 4 days, 14 days, and 28 days old
respectively.
Mr. Kenton Lint, Curator of Birds, Zoological Society of San
Diego, wrote a full account of the successful breeding of the Ocellated
Turkeys in Captivity, which appeared in Bulletin No. 27 of that
Society. His paper contained the following summary in tabulated
form of the experiences at San Diego Zoological Garden from four
successive successful years, the first two of which depended entirely
upon artificial insemination, the last two being the recordings of the
success with only natural matings from two year old, zoo bred cocks.

" Breeding of the Andean Condor has occurred in several instances
in Zoos displaying a mature pair. Therefore, the story of mating
them at the San Diego Zoo is of importance only because of our
experiments in increasing the breeding rate of these magnificent birds.
These experiments have been carried on during a ten-year period
with the hope that if we succeeded in fulfilling our calculations we
might be able to change the dismal and hopeless destiny of a bird
dear to the heart of every " Californian ", the California Condor.
Unfortunately, a pair of these birds has never been housed in any
Zoo, all those in captivity most unfortunately having been females.
The breeding pattern of both species of Condor is one young bird
at two-year intervals, for a yearling bird is still dependent upon the
parents for food and protection, due to slow physical development.
In addition to this is a discouraging rate of reproduction, for the

Andean Condor requires eight years to reach productive age, and
while it has not positively been established, it is agreed by most
authorities that it is the same with the California Condor. Practical
conservationists have established that the likelihood of survival of
rare species depends greatly upon very definite facts in the pattern
of reproduction. First, the balance between the sexes in existing
specimens and their mating pattern, whether monogamous or poly-
gamous ; second, an important feature is the age at which they reach
productive maturity ; third, the number of offspring produced
annually and fourth, length of intervals between breeding periods.
On each of these the California Condor, like its next of kin the Andean
bird, has a poor success ratio. The breeding age is accepted as
seven or eight years. The California birds have no identifying sex
marks. Therefore, the ratio between sexes is completely unknown,
and the number of known breeding pairs among the estimated number
of birds is ridiculously low. Finally, the breeding speed is one egg
laid at intervals of two years. This stimulated our interest in making
a systematic study of the Andean Condors breeding in a huge flying
cage among a mixed group of eagles, kites, and small vultures.
The first egg laid, after a rather long and very spectacular courting
display, was misshapen and rough and was broken by the hen about
the sixth day. But fortunately she laid another within a few months.
From this there hatched out a fine, sooty-coloured chick, which could
be sexed the day it was hatched because of the small comb which is
present only in the male of this species.
The baby developed very slowly. Feeding and other forms of care
were shared by the parents, as the incubation had been. The baby
did not emerge from the nest until it had grown to be almost as large
as its parents, though still somewhat shaggy and a dull dark grey
instead of the shiny black of the adult. The care of the young bird
continued until it was a year old. A normal mating season was
skipped. In fact, it demanded attention until well into the second
year, as it did not fly, but used its wings only to aid it in hopping
about the imitation cliffs and ledges of its huge cage. The spring
before it was two years old, however, the parents began their mating
display, and on almost the same day as before the egg was deposited
and the second incubation period ensued. The Zoo decided that we
could afford to make an experimental study of this second bird,
feeling sure that our pair of Condors would not be disturbed by our
activities. And so, when the bird was ten months old it was removed
from the cage. At first he sulked, but soon began to eat greedily
whatever food he was offered.
The pair of adult birds, relieved of its care, almost at once began
their mating display and laid an egg in due time which, upon hatching,
turned out to be a female. The parents raised this second baby.

We had doubled normal production of Condors by raising two in two
years. However, we felt that perhaps even greater speed in raising
Condors might be necessary, for more and more discouraging reports
regarding California Condor scarcity were brought to the Zoo by
men actively concerned with wildlife preservation. Therefore, when
the Condors laid their first egg in the following May, we took the
egg away to be hatched in the incubator. In about thirty days after
the first egg was laid, a second egg was deposited in the nest. This
we left with the parents for incubation. Both eggs hatched and we
raised two Andean Condors in one year, one without any aid from the
parents.
The hand-feeding of a baby bird of prey, normally fed by regurgita-
tion, is difficult, requiring much time, study, and real imagination,
but we felt a good deal of pride in having produced four young which
normally would have been the product of four pairs of birds in two
years under normal wild conditions.
When we were able to repeat this performance for one more year
we made no further efforts and the pair returned to their normal
breeding pattern.
We wrote to the authorities in charge of wildlife in California,
setting forth the results of our experiments with the Andean Condors,
and calling to their attention that the few breeding California Condors
in a sanctuary surrounded by thickly populated areas had little chance
of survival through the mere setting aside of a proscribed area in
which the birds could nest without interference of man.
We offered to turn our enormous cage over to the project of
increasing the numbers of the California Condors. We did not ask
for a permit to trap, but offered to take and care for any Condors the
State could furnish. This came before the Fish and Game Com-
mission, a non-political body concerned with such projects, and they
told us they would prefer to give us a permit to trap a pair of Condors.
Immediately, to our amazement, those organizations supposed to be
:oncerned with preservation of wildlife, while admitting that the birds
apparently were decreasing under their programme, violently opposed
:his permit or the caging of any Condors, and refused any request
;ven for us to enter the sanctuary which had been set up in the area
af the five or six known pairs of nesting Condors.
In spite of this opposition we asked for and received the permit to
rap a pair of Condors outside the sanctuary any time except during
he mating season. Opposition continued from these organized
groups, but during several months in which our permit was in
ixistence, weather conditions and scarcity of birds in areas to which
ve could have access prevented successful trapping. Finally, the
Uidubon Society which has for its object preservation of wild birds,

squeeze through, during the closing hours of the session, a bill
cancelling all permits to capture California Condors, and so we and
those who share our desire to find a solution to the problem of real
wildlife preservation, were stopped without any opportunity to make
an active, positive approach to one of the most tragic and discouraging
chapters on preservation of a rare species that is taking place in the
world."

t# European collections of pheasants were at a low ebb just at the end
of the last war. Only a small stock of some rare species remained in
England, at Leckford, and in Belgium, at Beez. Mr. Spedan Lewis,
with the help of the late Miss Chawner and of Mr. Milligan, had
saved a few pairs of Temminck's Tragopans, Mikado Pheasants, Grey
Peacock Pheasants, and a few others, while Mme. Malisoux had
Satyrs and Blyth's, Tragopans, Greys, and Palawan Peacock-Pheasants.
Prof. Ghigi still had birds at Bologna, and a number of pairs of the
commoner species were to be found here and there. In America,
however, pheasants were still plentiful and soon many found their way
to Europe. The pheasantry at Cleres was replenished by consignments
from England and from America and so were several other continental
collections.
The situation after nearly ten years has greatly improved, although
importations of wild caught birds have been few. Several species
however have come on several occasions : Palawan Peacock-Pheasants
and Japanese Copper Pheasants have reached California ; also a few
Malay Argus and Crested Firebacks. From India came Satyr Trago-
pans, Koklass and Impeyan Monals. But the number of birds bred in
captivity both in America and in Europe is constantly increasing. They
sell readily and there is no doubt that the taste for pheasant keeping is
also increasing, particularly in America and in Continental Europe.
This is not the case in England where practically only two collections
exist at the present time, at Leckford, at Whipsnade and in London
(Zoological Society).
It is a curious fact that pheasant breeding has always been
a neglected branch of aviculture in Great Britain while bird-keeping
generally has long been more popular and more successful there than
perhaps anywhere else, although one must remember that more species

have been reared in captivity for the first time at the London Zoo, over
a hundred years ago, than at any other place.
Belgium and Holland have very fine collections at present, mostly
private ; but the excellent Rotterdam Zoo has greatly contributed to
the promotion of pheasant keeping by importing several rare species
and by rearing them in special secluded quarters, an example that
other zoological gardens should follow.
There still are a number of private pheasant breeders in France,
where the market for birds is excellent. The fairly large numbers reared
at Cleres every year fall, by a long way, short of the demand. The
same is true of Italy.
Pheasant keeping in America is continually progressing. Not only
the American Pheasant Society, national in scope, but several local
dubs and groups, are active, and the number of birds reared each year
s considerable throughout the country. The largest and finest collec-
:ion to-day is that of Mr. R. H. Gibson at St. Helena, California, but
; here are many others, some very rich. The rarer species now reared
n the United States include Malay Argus, Palawan, Gray and
Germain's Peacock-Pheasants, Imperial, Edwards, Bel's (Berlioz),
Mikado, Elliot's, Cheer Pheasants, Malay and Siamese Firebacks,
jreen and Sonnerat's Junglefowls, Satyr and Temminck's Tragopans.
Hue Eared-Pheasants are plentiful and there is a fair number of
Irown, which unfortunately are not breeding so freely as in the old
lays. Spicifer Peafowl are common in the west. White Eared-
Hieasants are raised each year in small numbers, but their situation is
irecarious. Some have been crossed with Blue and the three-quarter
)red birds are very similar to pure white. Perhaps this introduction of
lew blood may save the stock, which is not likely now to be soon
enovated by imports from Western China. A few Bornean Crested
firebacks remain, but none has been reared in some years. No Copper
Peasants have so far been bred from the stock of birds recently
mported.
There are just a few Cabot's Tragopans now in the United States,
a England, and in Holland, and it is hoped that this beautiful species
aay soon be re-established, as it was one of the commonest in captivity.

Species shown were Robin, Redstart, Whinchat, Wheatear, Spotted
and Pied Flycatchers, Tree-Pipit, Reed-Bunting, Redbacked Shrike,
Treecreeper, Green Woodpecker, Nuthatch, at an unusual nesting
site in a stone wall, Dipper, Cuckoo with Hedge Sparrow foster-parent,

change of expression of which this bird is capable, Kestrel, Merlin,
Peregrine Falcon at the eyrie, and also of a trained bird pluming
and tearing its prey, and the Common Buzzard at both tree and cliff
eyries.
The waders depicted were Avocet, recently re-established as a British
nesting species after a lapse of 125 years, Redshank, Curlew, Common
Sandpiper, Snipe, Common Plover, Ringed Plover, Kentish Plover
(now extremely rare as a nesting species), and Oystercatcher.
All the British nesting species of gulls were shown, Great Black-
backed, Lesser Black-backed, Herring, Common, Kittiwake, and
Blackheaded ; Common and Lesser Tern, Razorbill, Guillemot, and
Puffin, and finally several illustrations of the Gannet colony on Grass-
holm, with an estimated population of 15-20,000 birds.
All the slides were of a very high standard and of perfection in

material and for much of the season the sun's heat is of secondary

temperature of the egg chamber. Mr. Frith stated that this process
usually results in a loss of heat and cooling of the egg chamber, which
is contrary to the usually accepted theory that it causes an increase
in temperature by means of solar heat. Only towards the end of the
breeding season does it become necessary for the birds to make use of
the heat of the sun, and they achieve this by removing the soil cover to
within an inch or so of the eggs during the day. Mr. Frith then
showed a colour film, the first ever to be taken of this subject, of the
Mallee Fowl and their mound, the hen laying eggs, the position of
the eggs when laid, and the birds attending to the mound. One-
amusing incident showed, at a moment when the actions of the
birds were not completely synchronized, one of the pair scratching
away the earth from the mound while the other was carefully scratching
it in.

With the experience of many years as director of the Zoological
Park, Edinburgh, Gillespie (1932) writes, "of all the animals in a
zoological park or garden, there is none more popular than the
penguins." Yet these birds are almost unknown outside zoos because
they are difficult to procure, expensive to keep, and more prone than
any others to disease. Moreover, only a few hardy species breed
successfully in captivity. The aim of every zoo would, no doubt, be
to build up a healthy and contented community of breeding penguins
under conditions as near as possible to their natural environment.
Can a knowledge of the natural history of these birds studied in the
wild in any way benefit them in captivity ? I believe it can in many
practical ways. In this paper I propose to give a very brief resume of
some conclusions made from a study in the wild, and then to discuss
the possible practical applications of this knowledge to those in
captivity.
A STUDY IN THE WILD
My knowledge of penguins in their natural environment is limited
to seven species that breed in the Antarctic and Falkland Islands.
The three Pygoscelid Penguins, the Adelie, Pygoscelis adeliae, Chin-
strap,* P. antarctica , and the Gentoo, P. papua, were studied closely
between 1948 and 1951 * Aluch of what follows concerns these, and
particularly the Adelie.f The principles discussed, which are in very
general terms, can I feel be applied to other species.
Individual variation , familiar to all who keep animals in captivity or
study large samples in the wild, needs re-emphasizing. Penguins are
gregarious birds, and differences in temperament play an important
part in captivity.
Age and breeding experience do not appear to have been stressed
enough in previous literature. An Adelie community can be divided
into three main groups according to age and breeding experience ;
the " experienced " (or established) breeders ; the " inexperienced "
(or unestablished) breeders, and the non-breeders. On the whole,
the " experienced " breeders return to the same nests and keep the
* Often called the Ringed, Bearded, or Antarctic Penguin. I agree with Murphy
(1936) that the South American name " Pinguin de Barbijo ", equivalent to Chin-
strap Penguin ", is the best vernacular name for this species.

same mates from year to year. " Inexperienced " birds, breeding for
the first or possibly second time when two to four years old, first have
to obtain nest sites and mates. To start with they may have to choose
inferior sites such as the edge of the colony where the snow melts last
and Skuas, Stercorarius skua, and Sheathbills, Chionis alba, can rob their
nests more readily. Their behaviour differs from that of the ex-
penenced bleeders. Couitship is more prolonged, fighting more
frequent, breeding efficiency lower. The birds in Photo 2 were
found on the edge of a colony. The female, while arranging herself
more comfortably on her poorly built nest (compare with Photo 5)
has inadvertently scraped away the egg with her feet. The Sheath-
bills behind are waiting for an opportunity to get at the egg, perforate
it with their bill, and suck the contents. These little white birds,
which do very well in captivity, know all about the penguins in their
territory, and it is to nests such as these that they pay most attention.
The non-breeders having no permanent attachments to territory, are
seen in small parties walking around the rookery, or wandering far
away inspecting rocky outcrops as much as 1,000 feet above sea level.
A lone male might temporarily occupy territory, build a large nest,
and keep company with a female. Next season this pair might
come together again and breed for the first time. It is these
" wanderers " and some of the unestablished " inexperienced "
breeders which, under favourable conditions, will extend the range
of the species by establishing colonies in new situations. They are
also an important reserve population, ever ready to fill gaps. There
is, of course, considerable overlap in these age groups due to individual
variation. The only really satisfactory way to study these complexities
is by long term research on marked birds of known age ; a lead
which has been given by Richdale (1951).
Sex differences .--The birds appear to be able to tell each others'
sex, though to a human observer this is almost impossible. True,
females are usually smaller and shier than males, but measurements
and the temperaments of both sexes overlap to a considerable degree.
One of the most reliable methods of sexing breeding birds is the one
used by Richdale (1951), in which he compares the dilated, and
maybe blood-stained, cloaca of the female soon after egg laying with
that of her mate. Two birds seen copulating is another reliable
indication of the sexes, though the possibility of homosexual and
abnormal heterosexual relationships (especially in captivity) must
not be ignored. In the Adelie additional evidence can be gleaned
from breeding routine and courtship behaviour. For example, the
male is always the first to incubate the newly-laid eggs, while his
mate goes off to sea to feed. The ecstatic display (Photo 3) is confined
to males during the early part of the season before egg laying and
during incubation. These sex differences, though unreliable in other

species, do however suggest that an intimate knowledge of the breeding
routine in the wild would help in many ways. The only certain way to
sex penguins (other than by dissection) would thus be to mark them
early in the breeding season and observe their breeding behaviour
closely. By the time the eggs have been laid, it should be possible
to tell in most cases which is male and which is female.
Affinity, a word understood in human social structures, but little
mentioned in works on birds, has been emphasized by Richdale (1951)
in his ten year study of marked Yellow-eyed Penguins, Megadyptes
antipodes. One interesting example given concerns a female (A)
who had an affinity for male (B), when (B) was already mated to
another female (C) and she, (A), already mated to male (D). In
September, 1939, just before the eggs were laid, (A) and (B) were
seen " keeping company " at (B's) nest when the rightful female (G)
returned to the nest and ousted (A). For this season and the next,
both (B) and (G), and (A) and (D), remained together at their
respective nests, but in the autumn of 1941, after her chicks had been
reared successfully, (G) disappeared. (A) forthwith deserted (D) and
joined (B) at his nest. But the story does not end here, for (A) and
(B) remained together and bred successfully for the next three seasons,
their union only being broken when (A) was unhappily killed in a ;
rabbit trap. Also interesting is the fact that (A's) former mate (D)
remained without a partner the season after (A) had deserted him.
Moreover, during the six consecutive seasons that Richdale followed
the intimacies of their lives, this male (D) had three different mates,
and twice remained unmated. He was perhaps an " odd man out !
The Adelie, though generally more faithful to its territory and
partners (Andrew and Roberts, 195 1 ) than the Yellow-eyed Penguin,
shows these discerning qualities as well. They not only take in their
surroundings, but are most aware of the temperaments of other birds
around them. The affinity of one bird towards another plays an
important part in pair formation and in other social relationships in
the breeding area.
Breeding routine varies much from species to species. Only a few
points which have practical application in captivity will be mentioned.
(1) Fasting periods. --Probably all Penguins fast during the moult,j
and may lose as much as 40 per cent of their body weight. The
Antarctic species seem to be the only ones that fast for really long
periods during the breeding season. The male Emperor, Aptenodytes
forsteri, fasts the longest, eating nothing for at least sixty days (Stone-
house, 1953) and probably longer, during incubation. The Adelie
comes 5 next. Once arrived at the beginning of the season, it will not
return to sea to feed until the eggs have been laid, and then it is the
female that departs first, leaving the male alone. It is only when the

female returns recuperated that the male can break his fast. The
duration averages forty days (Figure i), and his weight, starting at
about 6-5 Kgm., will drop to about 3*5 Kgm. A fortnight at sea,
however, is long enough for this bird to regain most of its lost weight.

Magellanic, Spheniscus magellanicus , and Black-footed, S. demersus, build
their nests in burrows. Of the majority that lay their eggs above
ground, the King, Aptenodytes patagonica , and Emperor are the only
species that do not build a nest. The others build with the materials
most easily available. Thus, in the Falkland Islands the Gentoo builds
its nest of grass and twigs of " Diddle-dee ", Empetrum rubrum , whereas
in the Antarctic, where there is almost no vegetation, nest material is
confined to stones (Photo 6) and the occasional bone of their dead
companions.

guarding the chick (Photo 4) and feeding, while the other returns to
sea to collect more food. Feeding is at intervals of one or two
days, the chicks' stomachs having a great capacity for holding the food
regurgitated to them. When the chicks are too large for guarding, the
parents leave them to look after themselves and are both away at the
same time collecting food. Visits then become more irregular. Most
of the species that breed close together in big colonies, such as the
Adelie, Chin-strap, Emperor, and King, have what is known as the
creche system where the chicks group together in large numbers up to
two hundred or even more. I believe this is chiefly for protection from
predators, and in particular from the Skua. This bird will attack and
kill any chicks that are isolated from the creche and alone. Another
factor is protection from the cold, the importance of which has been
emphasized in the Emperor by Stonehouse (1953). When Adelie
chicks begin to moult their down and show their first year plumage,

</page>
<bodyText confidence="0.996931795454545" page_id="58091225"  page_num="Page 136" year="" vol="">
they no longer seek the protection of the creches and disperse back to
their nest sites. Skuas can now be seen walking among the chicks
which do not show fright, for the chicks quickly repel those that
approach too close. The Skuas thus respect penguins that show a bold
front. During my studies on the Pygoscelid Penguins I was constantly
impressed by the fact that these predators, almost without exception,
attacked the weak or stupid chicks only.
Individual recognition .---Richdale has shown that Yellow-eyed Penguins
recognize others in the community, and parents recognize
their own chicks. Unlike the Adelie, whose chicks group together in
creches, the Yellow-eyed Penguins' nests are scattered among rough
and wooded country. Previous literature on the Adelie summed up
by Murphy (1936) suggests that parents do not recognize their chicks
in the creche and that they feed indiscriminately. In 1948-49 ,1 placed
coloured rings round the flippers of chicks of marked parents before
they went into the creches and discovered that the parents found and
fed their own offspring, and only under exceptional circumstances
ted strangers. A substantial amount of evidence was also collected
to support the fact that the pair-bond between two Adelies was
maintained more as a result of the individuals recognizing each other
from year to year (even after separation during the winter months)
than by their return to the same nest sites. Penguins recognize each
others' features, gait, movements and voice. The mutual display
seen so frequently between two of a pair and between parents and
chicks at the nest, and later when a parent comes back to feed its
young in the creche, has an important function in the Adelie, for I
believe the noise and movements confirm as well as re-enforce
recognition.
Individual recognition thus plays a very much more important
part in a penguin community than has generally been supposed. The
more one studies these interesting birds by marking them, the more
is one impressed by the orderliness of their social structure, a structure
based on many attributes which are taken for granted in human
behaviour, but which might be thought incredible in such a lowly
animal.
Porpoising is the normal swimming movement of penguins and is
used by no other birds. Adelies porpoising at high speed is a
truly magnificent sight. Swimming for several yards under water
they surface, and, barely rising as much as a foot, vanish under
the surface again a few feet ahead. They no doubt breathe each time
they surface, and can travel at ten knots or more. When landing,
an Adelie (Photo 7) or Gentoo will pop out of the water like a jack-
in-the-box, clearing up to six feet of ice-cliff in an almost vertical
leap. Sometimes they land erect and, balanced by their tails, run

eet, they will fall on to their bellies and toboggan along the snow
surface in a most enchanting and amusing manner.
Pathological conditions in the Adelie, Chin-strap , a?id Gentoo Penguins .--
Infestation with intestinal parasites was the only constant patho-
logical condition found in wild penguins. The amount of infestation
varied according to the species, and in the case of the Gentoos also
according to their breeding distribution. For example, the Falkland
Islands breeding Gentoos were almost free, whereas the ones breeding
n Graham Land and the South Orkneys were riddled with a cyst-
forming cestode.
Many wild birds were dissected,* but in none was found any macro-
scopic evidence of the fungal infection which causes mycosis. More-
over, forty-one cultures taken from throats of healthy Penguins at
their breeding places or within six days of capture, though they grew
a variety of moulds, did not demonstrate any that were potentially
oathogenic. These cultures, collected by swabbing the part of the
.hroat around the nasal passages and epiglottic region, were grown on
oabouraud's media, and brought back to the London School of
Hygiene and Tropical Medicine for identification. More work of this,
lature is required, for evidence that the spores of pathogenic moulds
io not occur as normal inhabitants of the upper respiratory tracts of
Mid birds is still fragmentary. Nor is there sufficient evidence that
he spores reach the birds via infected foodstuffs (Sladen, 1952).
W ild penguins are therefore remarkably free from disease and it is
m\y when they are brought into captivity that they become
iusceptible.

How can our knowledge of penguins in the wild be used to build
ip a healthy and contented community of breeding birds in captivity ?
vVe have seen that they know each other as individuals, usually keep
he same partners from year to year, and come back to the same
irea, and often to the exact nest-site, to breed. Affinity draws some
ogether ; lack of affinity repels others. Disease appears to be
iccelerated when a bird is unhappy and lonely ; morale higher when
heir gregarious nature is satisfied. In the light of such knowledge,
he capture of penguins becomes a job which should not be under-
aken indiscriminately, as is so often the case, but in a careful and
horoughly scientific manner. I believe the best way to do this would
)e to collect a complete section of a penguin colony. This section
hould include peripheral nests as well as central ones for, as already
* It was necessary to feed our sledge-dogs on seal and penguin meat. Maximum
*iological use was made from all collected for this purpose, and particular care was
aken to cause no unnecessary waste of life.

explained, the inexperienced younger birds are more likely to be on
the edge than inside. In theory, this sounds excellent, but it may be
difficult to put into practice. For example, at what time of the
season should they be collected ? This can only be answered according
to knowledge of the breeding routine and habits of the individual
species, a knowledge which is still incomplete for most, and is thus
quite out of the scope of this paper. A few general principles should,
however, be discussed.
First, the birds should not be incubating or rearing chicks, for
one of the pair is likely to be away at sea. Second, though most
species return to their breeding place to moult, after recuperating
from the breeding season at sea, and during this period fast for
about a fortnight, the physiological upset at this time would make
travelling (especially through the tropics) undesirable and probably
dangerous for the birds. Thus the only good time to collect
birds, as a community, may prove to be during the short period after
most of the colony have settled down into pairs at their nest sites and
before eggs are laid. The Antarctic is still ice-bound when the Adelies
are at this stage. The Chin-strap colonies might be more accessible
for their breeding cycle starts roughly one month later, and the first
eggs are laid at the end of November or early December. Penguins
that breed in the Sub-Antarctic and more temperate zones, and
particularly the non-migratory species, should present fewer problems,
and I would suggest that this method of collecting a section of the
community should be tried first on these.
It is now generally accepted by zoos that the expense of transporting
penguins by air is worth while. In my own experience, they travel
best if standing on half-inch mesh wire netting in a box of similar
design to that recommended in the Third Annual Report (1949-50)
of the Severn Wildfowl Trust. A slatted front with sack curtain is
much safer than a wire netting front, through which they thrust and
often damage their bills.

Two, often conflicting, points of view must be considered : the
birds', and the zoo's.
From the Birds&amp;apos; point of view.
(1) A community of the same species .--Many zoos are justifiabl)
anxious to exhibit as big a variety of animals as possible. For penguins,
however, there should be a different approach, an approach whicl
concentrates on building up reasonable sized communities of at leasi
ten pairs each of, say, two or three individual species. Zoos in differenl
parts of Britain and America will eventually discover which of thi
eighteen possible species of penguin are most suited to their climati
and conditions. How much more interesting and instructive will i 1

then be to visit different places boasting successful breeding colonies
of their own specialities.
(2) Acclimatization .--The first year in captivity usually takes the
greatest toll of wild birds. More attention paid to acclimatization
during this period, for example, by transporting them direct to a
spacious quarantine station in the country, might save money in the
long run. The upkeep of a lake and enclosures would be prohibitive
for one zoo, but could be shared by several. A station like this could
solve many problems of quarantine in zoos, and also prove of immense
value as a centre for investigating avian disease, and especially mycosis,
in captivity. Unfit birds could be sent there for observation and would,
no doubt, stand a better chance of recovery than if left in unfavourable
and cramped conditions in zoos. Gillespie (1932) stresses the fact that
King Penguins, once recovered from the strain of their voyage to
Europe, become indifferent to conditions of weather and temperature,
and if anything, prefer the sunshine. Thus the most important
functions of acclimatization would be (i) to build the birds up to the
health they enjoyed before capture, (ii) to allow them to adapt them-
selves to different food and a new fresh water environment and,
probably the most important, (iii) to give them a chance to adjust
themselves to a very much less active life in captivity.
( 3 ) Space and nesting sites .--From the birds' point of view, obviously
the larger the enclosure and the deeper and bigger the lake the
happier they will be. There must be limits, but the limits set by many
zoos are too severe. Penguins in captivity are very rarely seen por-
poising because the ponds are too small and shallow. They are
sometimes even deprived of their natural nest material. If they build
nests of stones or grass they should be given stones, or typical grasses
planted in their enclosures (as is most successfully done at Edinburgh
Zoo). If they nest underground in burrows, they should have a
suitable place for this. Due to lack of appreciation of their habits and
behaviour in the wild, these very simple but fundamental require-
ments are often overlooked; yet one or two small points rectified might
tip the balance in favour of breeding.
(4) Human interference is a difficult and controversial topic. Should
oirds that refuse food be force-fed ? Should a bird that scratches
iway its new laid egg from the nest, or tramples its young chick, be
nterfered with ? These questions I cannot answer with any authority
or birds in captivity, but in the wild this kind of behaviour is seen
requently where certain species normally fast for long periods, and
-vhere many apparent inconsistencies in behaviour and temperament
:an be attributed to age and breeding experience (Photo 2) as well
is to variation among individuals. The establishment of a reasonable
ized community of one species would minimize the need for human

<bodyText confidence="0.993590302325581" page_id="58091231"  page_num="Page 140" year="" vol="">
interference because the birds would be happier and breeding, and i
would not matter losing the odd egg or young chick.
(5) " Occupational therapy ."--No better example can be given thai
the King Penguin parade to the post-box at Edinburgh. This kinc
of activity has public appeal, and gives the birds something else to lool
forward to as well as their food. The exercise keeps them in condition!
while all the time they are becoming more familiar with humans a
close quarters. If this sort of therapy is not practicable, they should a
least be given their natural nest material to " play " with, or suitabh
breeding burrows to excavate.
From the Zoo&amp;apos;s point of view.
A balanced view must, of course, be taken, for penguins are no
the only animals in a zoo ! Much will depend on the size of th
zoo, its situation, and financial commitments. A large zoo coul&lt;
probably afford the upkeep of a large enclosure with communitie
of two or three species. There is no reason why species should not b
mixed, in fact the contrast in behaviour between one kind and anothe
is most entertaining. In the Antarctic, the Adelies, Chin-straps, an&lt;
Gentoos breed in the same rookeries, and often side by side. Oi
Deception Island, South Shetlands, a small colony of Macaron
Penguins, Eudyptes chrysolphus , nest amidst a community of hundred
of thousands of Chin-straps. A small crowded zoo would sav
unnecessary expense and disappointment by purchasing captive brei
penguins, and concentrating on one species only. If enclosure
must, of necessity, be small, some form of " occupational therapy
will help to keep them happier.
Acclimatization for a year, although ideal for the penguins, wi.
be an additional financial burden for a zoo whose aim is naturall
to have the birds on show as soon as possible. This approach, aj
already explained, should save money in the long run. Hygiene i
another controversial subject, though the zoos that worry least abov
this appear to have the best breeding results. Penguins live in squalc
in the wild, and I therefore believe it more important that they hav
adequate nesting material and surroundings than a barren an
uninteresting enclosure designed for frequent ablutions. Surely visitoi
to a zoo have to be prepared for a few strange smells. A communit
of penguins would, however, find it difficult to compete with th
odours that come from the elephants, seals, or a wallowing hippc
potamus. Moreover, incubating penguins are often fasting, and thei
excreta quite innocuous. Carefully designed enclosures could di:
courage the accumulation of too much guano, and still allow the birc
plenty of scope for breeding in as near a natural environment #
possible.

A STUDY IN CAPTIVITY

<bodyText confidence="0.9095565" page_id="58091232"  page_num="Page 141" year="" vol="">
A study in captivity cannot take the place of a study in the wild,
for three important reasons :--
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.7094585">
(i) The birds are in confined and abnormal surroundings.
(ii) A large enough sample cannot be studied to make allowances
for variation among individuals.
(iii) Those in authority in zoos are naturally reluctant to allow
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.99572932" page_id="58091232"  page_num="Page 141" year="" vol="">
birds or their young to be handled.
There is, however, an almost unexplored field for research on many
practical aspects of life in captivity, and these, correlated with a
knowledge of the same species' behaviour in the wild would ultimately
help to solve many problems such as breeding efficiency, the moult,
mycosis, and some aspects of behaviour. So many ideas and
" hunches " are founded on isolated examples, and it is only by
systematic and well planned research on a small community that&amp;apos; our
knowledge can be really furthered.
As in the wild, one of the most important aids to a study in captivity
is to mark the birds. I do not wish to refute the fact that the keepers
and those who spend a long time with their birds recognize them
as individuals. They no doubt do if the number is small enough,
but research workers come and go, and valuable material is sure to
be lost during the penguin's life span of ten to twenty years. They
should therefore be marked with metal rings as soon as they arrive in
the collection. These rings, bearing a large reference number (or
popular name for each individual if preferred for public enjoyment),
are best attached round the flipper (Photo 8), in the axilla so that the
number can be plainly read from a distance. These flipper-rings
(Sladen, 1952a), must be put on very carefully, otherwise they will
injure the bird. Richdale (1951a) marked his wild birds with tarsus
rings. These also require skill and care, and though successful with
the New Zealand penguins, are unsuitable for the Antarctic species
which nested on rocky ground.

Dr. Edward Hindle, Mr. G. S. Mottershead, Chester Zoo,
Mr. D. H. S. Ridson, Dudley Zoo, and Miss Phyllis Barclay-Smith,
took part in the discussion on penguins in captivity which followed.
The President of the Conference then moved a vote of thanks to
the President and Council of the Zoological Society of London for
the loan of their meeting room and many other facilities, and this was
agreed with acclamation.
Miss Barclay-Smith then said she would like to move a particularly
warm vote of thanks to Mr. L. Ellis, Library Assistant of the Zoological
Society, who had been in charge of all the projection of films and slides,
during the Conference, and to whom a great deal of the success of
the meetings was due. This was received with prolonged applause.
A vote of thanks to Miss Barclay-Smith for presiding over the
meetings was moved by Miss E. M. Knobel, Vice-President of the
Society, and the proceedings then terminated.
On Saturday afternoon a Garden Party was held at Foxwarren
Park, Cobham, Surrey, at the invitation of the President of the
Avicultural Society and Mrs. Ezra, and was attended by 150 guests.
In the evening the closing dinner was held at the Rembrandt
Hotel, at which one hundred members and guests were present.

Mr. and Mrs. G. M. Durrell have recently returned from Argentina
and Paraguay, bringing a small collection of birds, mammals, and
amphibians. Some of these were presented to the Society, and the
remainder to the Paignton Zoo. Among the birds were a Brown
Cachalote [Pseudoseisura lophotes ), the first of this genus to be exhibited
here ; a Southern White-breasted Crake (Creciscus leucopyrrhus), also
known as the Red and White Crake, and two d Orbigny s Pectoral
Sparrows (. Arremon orhignii), new to the collection.
Two Guira Guckoos (Guira guira) ; an Argentine Lapwing (. Belonop -
terus cayennensis grisescens ) ; two Jendaya Gonures (. Eupsittula jendaya ) ;
a Scarlet-headed Marsh Bird ( Anhlyrhamphus holosericeus) ; a Green
Cardinal ( Gubernatrix cristata) ; two Yellow-billed Cardinals ( Paroaria
capitata) ; a Brazilian Blue Grosbeak ( Cyanocompsa cyanea) ; three
Striated Tanagers [Thraupis honariensis) ; two Violet Tanagers (Tanagra
violacea) , and a Blue Sugar-bird ( Dacnis cayana) complete this
interesting presentation.
It will be seen that not all these birds were collected in Argentina
and Paraguay ; some were obtained in Rio de Janeiro on the way
home.
The Daily Mail Himalayan Expedition has presented two Satyr
Tragopans ( Tragopan satyra ) ; a Himalayan Monal ( Lophophorus

Geese, two Upland Geese, a Silver Gull, a Black-footed Penguin, five
Red-rumped Parrakeets, and three Greenfinches have been bred,
d he King Penguins, Rheas, Snowy Owls, and Green-winged King
Parrakeets have eggs ; the Canada, Greenland White-fronted, and
Emperor Geese all laid infertile clutches.
The Maiabou Storks and Indian Wood Ibises showed signs of
nesting, and carried twigs about, but nothing came of it. The Choughs
got as far as hatching a chick, but it did not long survive.
It is hoped that the aviary for homing Budgerigars will be finished
by mid-July.

G. af Enehjelm, Helsingfors, reports one Black-crested Finch fully
reared ; two left the nest, but one was weakly and soon died. The
parents are again on three eggs. Also reared : one Red-headed Parrot
Finch, five Cherry Finches, one Fire Finch, three Ruficaudas, three
Bichenows, and five Cordon Bleus. It has been a bad year so far
for Parrot Finches ; many clear eggs and one young one from one
pair ; three other pairs have done nothing at all.

D. Bowles, Director-Secretary, Royal Zoological Society of Scotland,
reports on the breeding of King Penguins in the Edinburgh Zoo, 1953 :
" Thirteen King Penguin eggs were laid, of which five proved to be
infertile. Of the remaining eight, three chicks hatched, but one died
a few days afterwards. This meant that five birds were found dead in
the shell, and it appears almost certain that the reason for this was
some violent electric storms which occurred a few days before the
eggs were due to hatch, causing the parents to desert the eggs, which
were thus allowed to chill resulting in the death of the inmates."
Altogether, a total of 23 Penguin eggs were laid, from which seven

chicks were reared--two King, two Gentoo, one Ringed, and two
Macaroni.
A nest of four blue Ring-necked Parrakeets, not three as previously
reported were hatched at Keston. Misfortune, however, overtook this
brood. Vice-President Boosey writes : " My heart sank as each day
became colder and colder about the middle of May, as I knew the
young Rmgnecks would be in that critical stage when they are too
big for their mother to brood them, but they are only just starting
to feathei. Finally, when the parents had started to eat less and less,
I decided to look in the nest-box, and found three well-grown young
ones in the quill stage, dead ; only the fourth and eldest, which was

by a marauding Magpie. ;

A tragedy of another kind has occurred at a well-known zoo. A pair
of Lesser Sulphur-crested Cockatoos showed great interest in a nest-
box, and when they disappeared it was assumed they were nesting
m earnest. When, after several days, the box was inspected, the two
Cockatoos were found to be dead, having been unable to climb out.
Since then we have heard of a Leadbeater's Cockatoo suffering a
similar fate. These events are cited as a warning to breeders to make
doubly sure that their birds have an easy means of climbing up to the

Kathleen Deery de Phelps. Published by the Creole Petroleum
Corporation, Caracas, Venezuela.
This attractive book, the first illustrated book on the birds of
Venezuela to be published, does great credit to its author, who is also
responsible for the coloured plates. It contains a hundred coloured
illustrations of the best known birds in Venezuela with a descriptive
text about the bird, its nest, eggs, and other details, together with a
map showing its distribution. The distribution maps are coloured
ditterently, each colour indicating a different zone according to the
a l tltu de for instance the tropical zone o m. to 1,500 metres is depicted
m red, the sub-tropical zone, or 1,500 to 2,500 metres, in yellow, the
temperate zone from 2,500 to 3,500 in blue, and the heights above this
in g r ey. By this method it can be seen at a glance at what altitudes the
bird is found. Hints are given as to the food to be put out for birds,

Advice on photographing birds is added and also ideas for noting
observations. A section deals with the protection of birds pointing out
that they have many enemies and drawing attention to their
usefulness in destroying harmful insects.
The book, which is primarily intended for distribution among the
schools of Venezuela, is one that all those interested in the colourful
birds of the South American continent will wish to possess. The Creole
Petroleum Corporation are to be congratulated on their far-sightedness
in making the publication of this book possible for it will undoubtedly
do much to arouse an interest in the birds of Venezuela both in that
country and other parts of the world. Anyone wishing to obtain the
book should write to the Creole Petroleum Corporation, Caracas,

You may be interested to hear that I have another pair of African Greys with
young. After one abortive attempt--due I think to interference, unintentional, on
my part--the hen went to nest again in March. I have not dared--after my first
experience--to disturb the birds, so do not really know what has happened. I am
satisfied, however, that at this date there must be young as one or other of the birds
is always on the nest.
Incidentally, amongst my " run of the aviary" breeding successes this year, I have
managed to rear two lots--each of two--of Crested Barbets and one of Magpie Robins

(Horn India). A third brood of Crested Barbets was lost--again because of inter-
ference. The more breeding I have the good fortune to supervise, the more I am
convinced that losses are to a very large extent caused by the intentional or unim
tentional interference of the over-curious and impatient owner.
I recently procured, in very damaged condition, a Little or Pigmy Bee-eater.
I ha\ e now had it a month or so, and it is very nearly back to normal. 1 have force-fed
it on meat, which it still does not always take willingly, and on grasshoppers, meal-
woims, etc., and I now see no reason why it should not make the grade. P I am quite
proud of this achievement, for which I must thank my wife who struggled manfully
vvlule I was away at office, as this is the first Bee-eater I have ever tried to keep &amp;gt;
Contrary to what I have read, this Bee-eater is far from silent--in fact on a warm
day it keeps up a constant chattering, and has a very pretty little song.

Breeding Golden-shouldered X Hooded Parrakeet PIybrids
The Golden-shouldered is exceptionally rare. For the last twenty-five years 1 have
made many attempts to procure them, without success, until this year when two
birds came into my hands. As these were both males, I had no alternative but to
gut them females of their closest relative--the Hooded Parrakeet. One male
immediately commenced driving the female, and proceeded to dig a large hole
undei their bath trough. I he female, however, preferred a nesting box, which the
rnmnWl 1 y , 1 grC u d t0 - ^ OUr e f gs were P rocluccd and four youngsters are now
completely reared- three males and one female. It was most interesting that this
small, cheeky bird would immediately attack me on entering the aviary, and on
several occasions it nipped my ear, or the back of my hand. Another point of great
leave&amp;apos; 8 .&amp;apos; he ne" ,h &amp;apos; 00 &lt;h&lt;= hybrid can be sexed as^oon as(R),hey
leave the nest. The female is quite plain, but the male is very much brighter.
i U dr . e f din S season commencing May of 1955, I am proud to say that fex-
duding hybrids) at least four pairs of Golden-shouldered are already in my aviaries.

" MARKED WHITE " ZEBRA FINCH
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.963705230769231" page_id="58091247"  page_num="Page 150" year="" vol="">
In the September-October issue of the Avicultural Journal there appears an article
on the recent arrival at Keston of the Marked White Zebra Finch.
In his article Mr. Boosey has changed the name of the Australian bred Marked
White Zebra Finch to the Chestnut-Banked Zebra Finch, yet he states that the
name " Marked White " describes them tolerably well.
So as to keep names uniform it is suggested that the country of origin should be
consulted as to the desirability of a change of name.
As this variety is well established in Australia, and is known throughout as the
" Marked White ", a change of name now would only add to the confusion that
already exists through the multiple naming of birds.
Wishing the Avicultural Magazine every success.

Hon. Secretary, Avicultural Society of Australia.

One very interesting bird which Sir Edward has bred, and that came out of the
nest while I was away, is a hen Eclectus with a yellow and orange head. The wings
and side feathers have the appearance of a patchwork quilt, some of the feathers
having a normal maroon colour, whilst the other feathers have the appearance of
being yellow mixed with maroon. The head of the bird, though mainly yellow and
orange, also has a few flecks of red feathers in it. The hen Eclectus usually has a
black bill, but with this bird it is noticed that there is quite a lot of yellow in the bill.
The bird is strong and vigorous, although a little more timid than the usual young
Eclectus.
Sir Edward hopes to photograph this bird in colour to enable him to check the
colours as each moult takes place.

&amp;apos;Fhe Blue Robins had five eggs in the first nest, and young hatched on 22nd June
--cannot say how many, but judging by the vast quantity of live insects carried to
the nest, and the excreta brought out by the old birds and " dumped " on the door
frame (the same spot as used last year for this purpose), I should say there must be
at least four lusty youngsters.
Although both parents are kept well occupied feeding this family, the cock has
found time recently to encourage the hen to build a second nest, which she has now
completed in a box in the flight, and I think she will be laying again in a day or so.
I am a little disturbed by these " rush tactics " in case the second nest hatch before
the first lot are independent. It would be amazing if the cock continued to feed the
older family and the newly-hatched young at the same time.

THE CEYLON BLUE MAGPIE
Cissa ornata (Wagler)
By G. M. Henry (Church Enstone, Oxon, England)

This bird is confined to Ceylon, its relatives of the same genus being
found no nearer than the Himalayas and Indo-Malayan countries ; it
is therefore an interesting example of discontinuous distribution. In
the pear-shaped island of Ceylon a great mountain massif, rising to
8,000 feet, occupies the centre of the southern half. Owing to the
action of the monsoon winds, the southern and western aspects of these
mountains and their foothills receive a heavy and well-distributed
rainfall (80 to 250 inches annually), and it is this wet zone which
constitutes the habitat of the Blue Magpie ; it is found from a few
hundred feet up to nearly the highest point in the Island. Unfortu-
nately, during the last century, the demands of tea and rubber cultiva-
tion have depleted the once-extensive forests of this region, restricting
the bird's range very severely.
A forest-loving bird, it usually dwells in small flocks of less than a
dozen except in the breeding season, when pairs or solitary birds are
frequently met with. It moves about a good deal, a flock seldom
being found for many consecutive days in the same area. They keep
in touch with each other by a great variety of loud calls, most of which
have a harsh or rasping quality. Some of these are described in my
notes as follows : " a ringing, metallic crink, crink-rink suggestive of
jingling a gigantic bunch of keys " ; " crak crak rak rak rak --a loud,
rasping sound " ; "a sharp, harsh qui qui " ; " crikrak " ; " twiwi-craa
---a as in hat ". Besides these calls, low conversational notes--squeaks,
croaks, chatterings, and sucking noises--are uttered by members of
a feeding flock, and a solitary individual will express its feelings in
a quaint subsong into which it introduces excellent imitations of the
notes of other birds--the scream of the Serpent Eagle, rattle of the
Scimitar Babbler, etc.--all in subdued tones.
The Blue Magpie feeds on both fruit and animal food, but much
prefers the latter. It partakes of the fruit of Freycinetia, a small screw-

pine which clothes the tree-trunks in its haunts. Small vertebrates,
such as lizards and tree-frogs, are eagerly sought, and many insects, of
which beetles, tree-crickets, and caterpillars appear to be the favourites.
Hairy caterpillars are methodically rubbed on mossy branches--
piesumably to divest them of stinging hairs--before being swallowed.
In hunting it is very active and agile, searching foliage most thoroughly,
and often adopting attitudes worthy of a tit in the process. All levels
of the forest, from ground to tree-canopy, come within its purview.
I he flight is rather weak and laboured ; the beautiful, graduated
tail is carried closed and strap-like, except in vol-planing when it is
widely spread. In flying any distance, the bird tends to drop from its
perch to within a few feet of the ground, rising again at the end of
its flight.
Moulting takes place in August and September. The breeding
reason is in the early part of the year. The nest--which has seldom
been found is built in a well-concealed site among foliage near the
top of a tree in jungle. It is built of twigs in the shape of a crow's nest,
with a deep cavity lined with soft roots or " old man's beard " lichen ;
the latter abundantly festoons the trees of the mountain forests. The
three to five eggs are described as pale greenish-blue or whitish,
heavily mottled with grey and brown.
So far as I am aware, the only Ceylon Blue Magpie that has been
kept in captivity was one given to me in September, 1943, by Mr.
Ralph West with whom I was staying. His tea-estate in the mountains,
4"55 00 * f ee b was in the best area for Cissa ornata known to me. It was
paitly surrounded by virgin forest, and a stream--rapid and bouldery
tiaversing the estate was bordered on both sides by a strip of jungle.
1 his belt of trees was a favourite resort of a flock of Blue Magpies and
offered exceptionally favourable opportunities for watching them.
Coolies working in the neighbouring tea-field found one amongst the
tea bushes and managed to capture it by throwing a " cumbly " (coarse
woollen blanket carried by every estate labourer) over it. In the
pi ocess the bird lost its tail completely ; it was in heavy moult about
the head, thin, and generally in poor condition, but seemed uninjured
and worth taking some trouble over. A tea-plucker's basket was soon
fitted with a perch and sacking cover, and in it" Cissy " spent the next
few days until she could be taken to Colombo where more spacious
quarters were available. Her feeding presented some difficulties, and
much time had to be devoted to hunting frogs and lizards, beetles and
giasshoppers for her appetite proved to be quite unimpaired by her
adventures. Once installed in a large cage in Colombo she throve,
tamed quickly, grew a new tail, and became a delightful pet. She lived
in captivity for three years, the last one in the Colombo Zoo at Dehi-
wela. The greater part of her domesticated life was spent at Jaffna in
the north of the Island, in a climate very different from her natural

abode--hot, dry except for two or three months of the year, and at
sea-level ; in spite of this she maintained, in general, excellent health.
A holiday upcountry, however--contrary to expectations--gave her
little pleasure ; she lost condition, and on returning to Jaffna, fell ill
and got so low that her life was despaired of. Brandy and milk, ad-
ministered at frequent intervals in tiny sips, eventually restored her to
health. Normally her diet consisted of bread and milk, scraps of raw
meat, lizards, grasshoppers, and fruit such as bananas and pawpaw.
On one occasion, when she was sharing a large aviary with a peacock
and a pair of Great Stone Plovers, her predatory nature revealed
itself ; a Spotted Dove was unthinkingly introduced into the company
and Cissy lost no time in pouncing on it ; only the promptest of action
saving its life. Although, in the absence of companions of her own kind,
she refrained from uttering the noisy calls above-mentioned, she
indulged in the subsong during her afternoon siesta, including in it
a beautiful imitation of the chok chaw-choyik of a distant Jungle-Cock,
which she must have learnt in her native forests in her youth. She was
fond of bathing, and always became lively and talkative in rainy
weather which seemed to have a tonic effect.
Although known as " Cissy ", and hereinbefore treated as of the sex
appropriate to that name, no proof exists that " she " was indeed a
hen ; the sexes are practically indistinguishable in this bird.
Regarding the " expectation of life " of the Ceylon Blue Magpie as
a species, I am pessimistic. As already mentioned, the beautiful
indigenous forests of the mountains and wet zone foothills are steadily
being whittled away on one pretext or another, and are now but a
pitiful fragment of their former extent. Protective laws exist for certain
rare and beautiful birds, Cissa among them, but will and power to
enforce them are absent, no real public opinion on such matters exists,
and protective laws will be useless if the bird's essential habitat be
destroyed. Reafforestation in the hills consists mostly of the replace-
ment of primeval forest with plantations of exotic trees--eucalypts,
acacias, and conifers--which offer no harbourage to any of the more
interesting of Ceylon's endemic species. It is true that " Wild-life
Sanctuaries " and ' k Strict Natural Reserves " exist--and look very
well on paper--but they are neither sufficiently extensive nor sacro-
sanct to ensure the survival of a relict fauna. Unless the remains of
the natural hill forests are rigorously preserved, both from official
exploitation and the insidious process of illicit sapling-cutting and
firewood stealing, I have personally no doubt that a very few genera-
tions hence will see this beautiful bird--and several other species which
inhabit the same area--added to the sorry list of birds lost to our
posterity by man's greed, lack of foresight, and thoughtlessness.

By Derek Goodwin (Virginia Water, Surrey, England)
These notes are, in part, a continuation of my previous articl
(Goodwin, 1953) to which readers are referred for descriptions of th
appearance, behaviour, and display of the species. The Spring of 195&amp;apos;
found me with only four Lanceolated Jays, the males Green an(
\ ellow (birds are named according to colour of their rings), and th&lt;
females Blue and White. The female Red got out in February anc
soon vanished, probably having been killed by some predator. O
the four remaining, the male Green is, and was, the tamest ; he i
veiy steady, has little fear of strange people, and will freely perforn
all his innate behaviour patterns within a few feet of me. At on&lt;
time he was subordinate to Yellow, but since he gained dominance
over him in June, I 95 2 ? has retained it. Yellow is less tame anc
lather more jumpy and nervous. The female White is the shyes
of all, but even she will behave quite normally within a couple o
yards of me il I am still or moving quietly. Blue, in contrast to the
others, who are all splendid specimens of their kind, is rather smal
and dingy in colour. She has what seems to be the garrulinc
equivalent of that captious self-assertiveness that is apt to be correlated
with sub-average stature in another species of vertebrate. She is
quite as tame as Green, in the sense that she will come as near to me.
but is very prone to take alarm, or offence, and to start scolding.
She invariably does this if I look into any bush or tree in the aviary,
and even to glance towards a possible nesting site or to search the
ground vegetation for Partridges' nests will often elicit her harsh
screams of disapproval. The others usually ignore this hysterical
behaviour, although if she is particularly excited her cries and gestures

will sometimes evoke a similar, but less intense, response in them.
I can only assume that she does this because such behaviour on my
part " suggests " a nest- or roost-seeking predator to her, although
if so it is rather strange that it should extend even to ground vegetation
in which the species would be most unlikely ever to breed or sleep.
All four biids spent the winter of i 95^ -- 53 fo &lt;aia outdoor aviary
about 30 feet by 20 feet by 8 feet high. The only shelter consisted
of roofing felt, covering certain parts of the roof under which were
strategically arranged perches, but although freely availing themselves
ol these by day the Jays all preferred to roost among the foliage of
two Cupressus trees. In early March it became apparent that Blue,
instead of pairing with Yellow, had set her cap at the " married "
male Green. He showed no Macheathian embarrassment at the
piesence ol two rivals lor his favours, and when in courtship-feeding
mood bestowed his gifts on whichever hen happened to be nearest.
As soon as I realized the state of affairs I moved Yellow and Blue
to a slightly smaller aviary some way--but not far enough--away.
Green and White displayed and indulged in courtship-feeding
throughout the Spring, but showed no serious nesting behaviour.
This I think was White's fault, as her mate began a nest, which never
?ot beyond the foundation stage, and I feel sure he would have built
properly had the female shown interest.
\ellow also started a west which was never completed. So far
as I could see he and Blue were never really paired. At odd times
ane of them would make sexual advances towards the other, some-
.imes very fervently, but they never seemed to reach any sort of
nutual rapport ". I think this was probably due to Blue's matri-
nonial ambitions still being centred on Green, whom she could,
anfortunately, both see and hear.
When they started to moult the four were reunited in the large
iviary, where they remained until early April, 1954. Once again the
wo hens had both bestowed their favours on Green. Blue was the
lominant female, and had begun to make occasional attacks on her
ival. This she was most prone to do, not when White was being
)aid attentions by the male, but immediately after she herself had
&amp;gt;een fed by him. In view of White's record, I decided to leave Blue
vith the favoured male, thinking that, poorish specimen though she
vas by comparison, she could hardly prove worse than White had
lone so far as reproduction was concerned.
On 18th April I moved Yellow and White to an aviary only a few
set away. This was done in the expectation that if the birds were
airly close the display of any one would be seen by, and perhaps
telp to give reproductive stimulation to, those in the adjoining aviary.
will be seen, these expectations were fulfilled, though not in the
nanner hoped for. Blue and Green left together continued to indulge

in much courtship-feeding. Prior to this Green had carried odd
twigs and fibres to various possible nest-sites and in one--a smallish
wire-netting " nest-bowl " fixed high up (but lopsided) under the
roof--had constructed a slight and very rough nest-foundation. Both
birds, however, spent much time flying restlessly to and fro, due I
feared rather to a desire to get out and seek a more congenial nesting
place than to any innate urge to exercise their wings. On the 23rd
I noticed to my great joy that a lot more sticks had been added to the
nest. Progress on it evidently continued on the 24th, and on the
25th (a Sunday when I was at home) the birds spent most of the
morning selecting fibrous roots and taking them to line the nest.
To my surprise they both did this freely in my presence. Blue--
who was then quite prepared to tolerate me in the aviary so long
as I did not look at any " forbidden areas "--coming eagerly near
to my feet to sort over the roots I threw down, in great contrast to the
shyness which White had shown when nesting two years before.
Some more work was done on the nest that afternoon, but no further
building was observed, and I think the nest was finished on the 25th.
On the 26th and 27th Blue spent much time sitting on the nest, and
Green frequently fed her there. On 29th April, Blue went on the
nest at dawn, and sat for most of the day, coming off for a long period
in the afternoon and several shorter spells. I thought she must have
laid but when I felt in the nest at 9 a.m. on the 30th, it was empty.
The horrible idea occurred to me that she might be laying an egg
each morning, and then eating or hiding it. After some indecision,
I decided to try to remove the next egg so as to save at least one of
the clutch if my fears were justified. Next morning I flushed Blue
at 8 a.m. (she sat very tight and once off mobbed me more vehemently
than she ever had before) and took a fresh-laid egg from the nest.
This I placed under my old hen Common Jay, who was then incubating
her own eggs, replacing Blue's egg with a Common Jay's. Needless
to say, all this created a great deal of " alarm and despondency " so
far as Blue was concerned, but she returned to her nest and proved
my suspicions of her false by having two intact eggs in her nest the
following morning. It is interesting that she had had a sort of " dress
rehearsal " for the laying of her eggs from at least two days before
the first was in fact laid. It will be recalled, however, by those who
read my previous article that the female White behaved in this way
on the day prior to that on which she laid, as Common Jays also
sometimes do.
Blue sat very tightly, coming off the nest to bathe, preen, and exercise
just before dusk and also, usually for shorter spells, at other times
during the day. Green fed her attentively both on and off the nest.
Their behaviour was similar to that previously described (Goodwin,
] 953 ) f* r Green and White, except that Blue, both before and during

D. GOODWIN-LANCEOLATED JAYS BREEDING IN CAPTIVITY I 57
incubation often received or solicited food with appeal calls, or the
chirruping notes, and when she used the juvenile begging note she
did so much less intensely. Green now showed the same animosity
towards wild Jackdaws that my Common Jays always do when they
have eggs or young, attacking them furiously through the wire when-
e\ er they alighted on the aviary. He spent much of his spare time
in communication ' with the exiled White, reinforcing her con-
\ iction that she was his and his alone, to my great annoyance. But
of this more anon.
lo my sorrow the egg put under the Common Jay proved infertile
as, presumably, were two of the three under Blue. On the evening of
10th May there were still three eggs in the nest, but at 7 a.m. on the
19th, one young one had just hatched. It was naked and hideous
and so far as I could see in a very hurried look, it seemed slightly
deeper pink in colour than a newly-hatched Common Jay. But this
may have been imagination, since I did not risk a close inspection.
With Blue s hysterical curses ringing in my ears, I beat a hasty retreat,
fearing that I might already have done enough to cause disaster.
If, as seems likely, the only fertile egg was the last of the clutch, then
the incubation period is 16 days, about the same as in our native
species. In this connection it might be mentioned that although the
Lanceolated Jay is much smaller than the Common Jay, its egg is
only slightly so. Indeed, only by closely comparing size plus the
slight (individual) colour differences when the eggs were lying side
by side on my hand, could I be sure " which was which " of the eggs
in the mixed clutch I had manufactured. Blue sat very tight for
several days after the young bird hatched. I only risked occasional
quick glances, with the aid of a mirror, at the young bird when she
was off the nest. This invariably aroused her to a frenzy of mobbing.
Finally, on 1st June, she screwed her courage up to the point of actual
physical attack, swooping from behind and striking the back of my
head. I his she repeated on most subsequent occasions when I entered
the aviary. lo my surprise Green showed no overt resentment of
my presence. Particularly amusing was the way in which he would
calmly continue gathering, preparing, and engorging food for the
young one without the slightest sign of anxiety, whilst his mate was
yelling her head off". As is the case with the Common Jay (Good-
win, 1951) the male bird at first prepared all largish or hard-bodied
insects (such as mealworms) by carefully pulling them to pieces and
discarding the harder parts before engorging them, when he was
feeding the young one, although he had taken no such trouble when
merely feeding the hen on the nest. He took ant pupae and meal-
worms readily, also cockchafers and some lean meat when the young
one was a few days old (they were not offered before), but refused to
take greenfly, small beetles, or centipedes. When given leafy branches,

he would at once fly to them and search eagerly for caterpillars. Since
caterpillars were few but greenfly many, I had thought and hoped
the latter might prove acceptable, but no matter how thick they were
on the branches, he ignored them. On reflection it occurred to me
that the only birds I have ever seen eating these insects--which,
unlike most others, could be procured in any number without search
or trouble--are the House Sparrow and the phylloscopine warblers.

at the young one. On 3rd June it was about half-feathered and lay
in the nest, crouched immobile and gaping in fear in response to its
mother s alarm cries. By this time my visits to the nest had resulted
in Blue usually beginning to screech at me and to attack as soon as
I enteicd the aviary. On 8th June the young one was fully feathered
and was peiched on the edge of the nest. For about a week previously
Blue had spent much time off the nest, although still brooding the
big \oungster for about 50 per cent of the time and roosting on the
nest at night. I think the young one first left the immediate vicinity
of the nest on the morning of nth June, when it was 23 days old.
At 7 a.m. that morning it was hopping and scrambling about among
some branches at the opposite end of the aviary. Green, like some
anxious but rather incompetent human father in charge of a toddler,
fussed nervously around it, oblivious of me, but Blue's only concern
was the danger I represented and she mobbed me vehemently and
unceasingly. Her behaviour was very similar to that recorded of the
Beechey Jay (Cyanolyca beecheyi ) when breeding in captivity (Sutcliffe,
1926). On the 12th the young bird was seen to be able to fly (with
the usual lathei fluttering and awkward flight of fledgeling passerines)
from branch to branch without losing height. It returned to the
nest edge to roost that night, and has done so since. This no doubt
is due to its being a high and sheltered perch rather than to any innate
tendency to use the nest for roosting after having once left it. At the
moment of writing (15th June, 1954) the young bird is still spending
most of its time in cover, although it can and does fly quite com-
petently about the aviary. I think both parents are feeding it,
although, owing no doubt to Blue's mistrust of me, I have only seen
the male doing so. Unfortunately it is more influenced by its mother's
warnings than by its father's indifference where I am concerned.
It freezes as soon as Blue starts to screech, and when I approach it
closely it hops and flutters away through the branches, using every
time it pauses the same jerking " flight-intention " movements that
an adult Jay does when mobbing. I am hoping that its present con-
viction that mother knows best " will be ousted by experience to
the contrary, as usually happens with juvenile Homo sapiens. Its
hunger call is harsher, but at the same time higher-pitched than that
of a young Common Jay, and as it is fed subsides into a similar eager
gabble which is, I suppose, caused by the bird trying to call out and
swallow at the same time.
I he young one is a pale and rather dull edition of its parents, with
shorter crest and the black and white markings on the secondaries
less distinct. In one respect it differs from the specimens of juvenile
G. lanceolatus in the British Museum. These all have the blue parts
of the wings and tail of a pale bluish-grey, but in my bird they are
of a similai azure blue as the adult. 1 he skins in question are,

however, all of older juveniles, and it is possible that the blue on my
bird will fade to greyish later. On the other hand the food may affect
the colouring. In the Common Jay unsuitable food may result in
abnormal colouring of the juvenile plumage which is, however, in
such cases always duller than the normal. Brightness of the blue
parts seems to be a certain sign that food is suitable and feathering
will be normal. My juvenile Lanceolated Jay shows every sign of
being fit, and I take the brightness of its blue parts as a hopeful rather
than a warning sign. Its bill and legs are a pale pinkish or fleshy
grey instead of the grey of the adult. Its eyes appear a similar colour
(dark brown), but I have not examined them at very close quarters.
The skin of the eye-rims is paler and more conspicuous than in the
adult, in which it is hardly visible.
Since the young one left the nest the pair have indulged in a good
deal of courtship-feeding--although this never entirely dropped out--
and Green displays a lot to his mate. He has shown signs of wishing
to copulate, and has made frequent sudden attacks on Blue, which
I think are caused by anger at his sexual impulses being thwarted.

barriers of wire netting and the constant sight and sound of her loved
one bestowing his affections elsewhere, she remained

Although it be not shined upon "
to her first love and ignored or evaded Yellow's early tentative
advances. Whenever she heard Green offering to feed Blue she would
fly to the nearest point of her aviary, cling to the wire, and call
imploringly to him. Often at the same time Yellow, prepared food
m his gullet would be flying back and forth vainly giving the food-
offering call. Had White ever " asked " him to feed her, I have
httle doubt he would have responded gladly, but she never did.
Green, as has been hinted, was largely responsible for this state of
aflams. Although when Blue was with him he had time for no one
e se, whilst she was on the nest he did not scruple to seek feminine
company elsewhere. In fact he spent the greater part of his ample
*spare time on the perch nearest to White's aviary, his notes and
actions leaving neither her nor I in any doubt about his feelings
towards her I he birds have now (17th June) begun to moult, so it is

and Yellow.
This breeding season has certainly been a case of " third time
ucky , although as Green and Blue have proved such exemplars
parents, it is the more annoying that three of their four eggs should
have been sterile. This was undoubtedly Blue's fault, as I repeatedly
saw her sidle or fly away when Green wished to copulate. Presumably
her physical reproductive processes were a little ahead of the psycho-
logical ones that should have kept time with them. The two pre-
sumably infertile eggs remained in the nest for at least five days but
had gone on the ninth day. Evidently this bird, like the Common

Food Given to the Young
Since my feeding methods seem to have been successful, I give them
for what they are worth. This could no doubt be improved upon by
anyone with more cash or leisure. For the first two days after hatching

mealworms or caterpillars, but mostly ant pupae, every hour or so.
I hereafter I had to be away from home most of the day, and the
regime was as follows :--

After the first three days cockchafers were sometimes substituted
for ant pupae at the early morning feed. Three or four times during
the period that the young bird was in the nest I gave the male shreds
of lean beef which he fed to it. He probably caught some insects
for himself in the aviary, and at least once he caught a mouse. The
non-insect foods on the adult Jays' menu--wholemeal bread, peanuts,
sop, etc.--were also given to some extent, but they were not, I think,
used for the young one, except perhaps as a stop-gap, at least up to
the time of its leaving the nest.
Note. --The diagrammatic sketches are merely intended to give a
general impression of the birds, and have no pretensions to accuracy
of detail. Nor are they quite to scale.
PS. --Those with experience of the ill fortune that so often dogs the
aviculturist will not be surprised to learn that the above story has
an chappy ending. On 21st June, the young bird seeming now past
all likely mishap, I ventured to go away on a short holiday. When
I returned on ist July, I learned to my horror that the kind neighbour
who looked after the Jays in my absence had found it dead that very
morning. It had been fit and well the evening before, and when found
had severe wounds on its head which had cracked the skull. Pre-
sumably an Owl or some other predator must somehow have managed
to seize it through the wire. The only slight consolation is that it
did not die of any illness that I might have forestalled had I been at
home, and since the bird was in every way fit and active previously,
there is no reason to think the regime was at fault.
As the old Norse saying has it :
One's enemies one can overcome,
God one can bribe,
But against bad luck no man can do anything.

therefore, that this was a real problem. As previously stated, in my

fresh nuts. Two separate aviaries were set up with a nice pair in each
and suitable hollow logs were provided. One pair were noticed
mating, but the other pair, although friendly, did not appear interested.
Suddenly the latter pair produced one egg. Several days later another.
The female sat closely, and in twenty-nine days hatched one chick.
It was then noticed that the male was losing condition, and I am
convinced that he had been starving himself in the feeding of the
female who rarely emerged from the log. This really was a desperate
position. After very careful observations, I decided to remove the
male, and found he had really lost a lot of condition. It was necessary
to recommence feeding him by injecting canary seed flour plus peanut
oil directly into the crop. In a few days he was showing good progress,
and was returned intermittently to the mother and youngster. It
again appeared as though the double feeding was too much for him
and although, at this stage, he had an ample supply of Casuarina
cones, I found it necessary to remove him again.
At the moment of writing (1st June, 1954), the baby is over two
weeks old and is being well cared for by the mother. The father,
who is still separated from the female and the youngster, is now doing-
well again. A peep into the nest hollow this morning revealed a
fluffy cream-coloured youngster about the size ol one's closed fist.
I am sure that this is the first time ever that one has been hatched in
captivity. They are really a lovely bird, and I think it will be
remembered in my talk in Sweden I described them as a Cockatoo
which does not have a gizzard, similar to the other Black Cockatoos.
As feeding is so highly specialized and consists of a great amount
of oil, it makes it most difficult to solve the problem of keeping them
in captivity, let alone the successful nesting and producing of a
youngster. From all appearances, the youngster is doing so well I
am sure it will be successfully reared.
Additional note, 25th June.--The young Glossy Black Cockatoo is
doing exceptionally well. It is in faultless condition (the mother
having done all the feeding) and is now almost fully feathered and
shows itself at the entrance to the nest. I did not return the male
to his mate for fear of disturbing the progress the mother had made
with the rearing of this singularly glorious youngster.
Further additional note, 20th August.--The Glossy Black Cockatoo
has now left the nest, and is accompanying its mother to the food
containers, and I should say has been successfully reared by the mother
alone. The youngster has a considerable amount of down protruding-
through the now matured feathers on the head. The down is quite
long and gives the bird an attractive appearance.

By YV. C. Osman Hill (London, England)
&amp;apos;951 (Avicultural Magazine, 57, p. 37), I recorded an
*&amp;apos; j- -j C * ngC y itV 111 a Blue-fronted Amazon (Amazona aestiva). This
individual, a male, had an authentic life of at least 50 years. Since
then two other instances of aged Blue-fronts have come to my notice
and in one of them the history is as well evidenced as one ever hopes to
g&lt; j th _ 1 far exceed my previous record. I give the protocols here-
1. No. BP 269, male, received from owner 7th April, 1954 * weight
292 gm. Last owner had kept the bird for 14 years and had published
a note in The Star (1944) giving its age at that date as 87 years. Stated
to have been in possession of immediate past owner for 42 years and
m the same family before that for 37 years. Total 97 years Post-
mortem revealed the usual senile degenerative features.
2. No. BP 275, female, received from owner 21st July, iqni :
wdght 450 gm. Last owner had known the bird personally for 2^
years, but it had been in his possession for only 9-J- years. It had
previously been in the possession of his wife's aunt, who had kept it
for 19 \ ears. This lady had received it originally from an old ladv of
80 to whom it had been given as a present when she was 10 years old.
lotal age of bird, if the history is reliable--98J years
The owner had subjected the bird to euthanasia on account of its
pi ogressive weakness and loss of appetite. Post-mortem revealed the
usua cardio-vascular degenerations, together with an abscess in the
basal lobe of the right lung.
It is interesting to note the close correspondence in the total period
3f captivity in these two birds. This possiblv represents, within a year
so, the potential longevity for this species. If this is the case, then
\0x25A0 lowers (,925) statement to the effect that " a parrot, under favour-
1 e cii cumstances, may live to 20 years, though certain individuals
lave been known to live for over 50 years " needs revision.

Among the birds which generally cause a lot of trouble as far as the
food is concerned, the Woodpeckers can certainly be mentioned first.
Many aviculturists have indeed tried to keep these birds in good
condition in captivity but, apart from a few exceptions, with very
poor results. Although some fanciers have managed to keep one or
more of these birds for some time, it cannot be said that they did so
with entire success.
Now chance has brought us a way of feeding these birds, which up
to the present has given us complete satisfaction, and therefore we
wish to communicate this to our fellow-aviculturists, trusting that it
will be of some use to them in taking care of their feathered pets.
Early last year, we were informed that a sailor had brought from
abroad a very beautiful, finely coloured bird, of which he knew neither
the name nor the country of origin. It lived mainly on fruit (oranges
and bananas), and some insects.
We hastened to have a look at the bird, and found that we had to
do with a Melanerpes Jiavifrons (Vieillot), i.e. a Golden-fronted Wood-
pecker from Southern Brazil and Paraguay.
It was a rather lively bird, which did not seem to have suffered
very much from the long voyage. We soon struck a bargain, and we
were able to add this new species to our collection. The bird having
come into our possession quite unexpectedly, we had not been able
to prepare a suitable cage. So we were forced to house it provision-
ally in the cage of a couple of Nectarinia famosa (Lin.), in which we
had quickly erected a fragment of a tree trunk, so that the bird could
perch at ease.
After the arrival of the new guest, both it and the Sunbirds
fluttered anxiously around the cage for a short while, but they very
quickly settled down, and were visibly satisfied that each of them
could go its own way without caring too much about its companions.
After having observed the Woodpecker for a couple of hours, during
which time it swallowed some fifteen mealworms and pecked greedily
at the orange, we left the birds to themselves, fully convinced that
things were going as smoothly as could be expected. Next day every \
thing was going on just as perfectly, but in the afternoon the keeper
informed us that our Woodpecker was drinking the liquid food of
the Sunbirds, i.e. the food of the Nectaridae. We were of course
surprised, but the news pleased us enormously, because we hoped
that this would be a way to give our new acquisition more varied food.
We placed a few more drinking troughs in the cage, and awaited
further developments with interest. After one week we were quite

sure that the liquid food, intended for our Nectaridae, had also
become the main food of the M. flavifrons. The bird is always quite
ready to swallow some ten mealworms, but it completely disregards
all fruit since it has tasted the Nectaridae food.
We have also tried this liquid food with a Hoopoe, and found
that this species accepts it quite willingly as well, but does not consider
it as its main food. Since we have given it our liquid mixture, the
health of the bird has, however, considerably improved.
The birds are still in excellent health, and we should be glad to
learn from other aviculturists whether they have already had some
experience with liquid food.
Our liquid food for Nectaridae consists of:--Water, 1 litre ;
glucose, 75 grams ; liquid honey, 120 grams ; condensed milk,

CUBAN AMAZON PARROT

ban, the most frequently imported of the small group of Amazons
having white or pink on the face and throat, and a rather dark green
body colour is, nevertheless, a rare species in captivity.
It is a very handsome bird of a rich darkish green, yellowish on the
tail-coverts. The forehead is white, while the cheeks, and a large but
somewhat irregular patch on the throat, are of a beautiful deep coral
pink. The feathers of the forepart of the body are bordered with black,
the width of the borders increasing in the region of the head and neck
and upper part of the breast. Behind the pink cheeks is an area of very
dark slate grey. There is some wine colour on the abdomen and the
tail is yellowish-green, the outer feathers having a large red patch near
the base. The outer webs of the flights are rich Prussian blue. The bill
is whitish and the legs oatmeal colour. Total length twelve inches or
a little over. The bird has the appearance of being slightly smaller
and slimmer than a Blue-front.
I do not find them particularly easy to sex, but I should say that
hens have a slightly smaller and more irregular area of pink on the
throat, but a rather larger and more extensive area of vinous on the
abdomen.
During the brief period of the lifting of the parrot ban, we received
six of these Amazons at the Keston Foreign Bird Farm. Two of them
died--one from a fit, and the other through an accident--but the
remaining four have done extremely well.

As I believe they have the reputation of being somewhat delicate,
their aviary shelter was heated during their first winter. Since then,
however, they have wintered successfully without heat, though it should
perhaps be added that their aviary is in a very sheltered position,
facing due south. Only during the winter months, however, are they
shut into the shelter each night.
They are delightful aviary birds, being strong fliers, and altogether
very lively and active. They are also very vocal, uttering both morning
and evening a wonderful medley of typically Amazonian cries.
These, however, while very attractive when heard from a distance
out of doors, might prove rather deafening indoors, and this is one
reason why I think these Amazons more suited to aviary than cage life.
If they have a disadvantage, it is that they are so terribly shy and
wild.
For weeks they became completely panic-stricken if one went
anywhere near their aviary, but now at last they have calmed down
a bit, and one bold spirit--a male I think--will actually take a slice
of apple from my fingers, watched apprehensively in the background
by what I take to be his wife, who obviously considers it a most risky
proceeding ! The other two think it more prudent to retreat at once
into the shelter, until all danger is past.
Cuban Amazons have a curious display which consists of the male
thrusting forward and slightly lowering his wings, thus bringing into
prominence the wonderful blue in the flights and, at the same time,
making a sort of mock-serious token lunge at the female.
Their seed mixture should consist mainly of sunflower, with a few
monkey nuts, and a little canary, groats, and hemp. Twice a week
we give ours a few cubes of stale bread, previously soaked in sweetened,
slightly watered milk. As to fruit and green food, Cubans are very fond
of apple, and also of spinach beet, particularly the fleshy stalks of the
Seacale variety.
They have the reputation of possessing but little aptitude for
learning to talk.
As far as I know Cuban Amazons have never been bred in captivity,
but there is a Continental record of the breeding of a hybrid between
this species and a Blue-fronted Amazon.
The accompanying photograph of two of our Cubans at Keston was
taken by my partner Mr. Brooksbank only with the greatest difficulty.
At first, alarmed by the appearance of a camera in their aviary, none
of them would stay still for a second. Eventually, however, after con-
siderable patience on the part of the photographer, two of them
remained still just long enough for this photograph to be taken.

In the past birds have been classified largely on the basis of their
structures and colours, but recently there has been a growing tendency
to analyse the relationships between bird species by also making
particular use of the specific behaviour patterns exhibited by them.
The best conditions for behaviour studies of this sort are undoubtedly
those in which large numbers of closely related species are kept in
captivity in cages or, preferably, aviaries. For, as Konrad Lorenz
( J 954) h as pointed out, when one is making a detailed inventory of
all the specific behaviour actions of a number of species of birds, one
has to live with them day after day over a long period of time. Lorenz
has even gone so far as to say that " it is really impossible to gain the
necessary knowledge by observing animals in the wild state ". Many
field ornithologists will disagree with this, but I feel that it depends
an the type of study one is making. If, as Lorenz was doing with his
ducks, you are studying a large number of closely related species,
then the possibility of slight distortions of behaviour resulting from the
conditions of captivity will only be a small disadvantage, for the
time and labour involved in travelling all over the world to observe
the many species in the group under investigation, would make such
1 study exceedingly difficult. If, on the other hand, you are making a
detailed study of one species, then it is probably better to study it in
ts natural habitat, as Niko Tinbergen (1953) has done with the
Herring Gull.
The earlier investigators, who were interested in classifying bird
species, were able to carry out most of their work in museums, with
lundreds of skins of birds arrayed on their desks. But they overlooked
she fact that to classify living things on the basis of dead objects
nvolves a serious omission !--namely, of course, behaviour. Now-
idays, as the result of the work of such pioneers as Heinroth, Whitman,
ind Lorenz, specific behaviour characters are treated with the same
espect as structural characters, from this point of view. But although
behaviour characters are thought of with respect to-day, there are,
'ven so, too few actual investigations of this type made. This is
probably because it is more difficult to observe, measure, and record
1 behaviour pattern than, say, a colour pattern. For this reason, a
combined investigation has been planned, and already begun, to
inalyse the relationships of a group of birds using information obtained

from recording their structures, behaviour, genetics, and geographical
and ecological distributions. When all this information is pieced
together, the result, it is hoped, will give as clear a picture of their
evolution as is possible.
Because the study of the behaviour of a large number of closely
related bird species necessitates the use of a large number of aviaries,
the choice of species for such a study is narrowed down immediately
to very small birds--for spacial economy--and to species that are
easily available. This leads inevitably to the Mannikins and Grass-
finches, which breed readily in captivity and which have simple food
requirements. The work that has been done so far has been concen-
trated on a few species, and now that this initial reconnaissance has
proved successful, a much wider range of species is being obtained and
investigated.
The Cutthroat Finch
One of the first species studied in the present investigation was the
Cutthroat Finch. This species has been bred in captivity as long
ago as the eighteenth century, and is particularly hardy. It occurs
in East, West, and Central Africa, and is replaced in South Africa
by a very closely related species, the Red-headed Finch (Amadina
erythrocephala ). Although these two species are at present classified
with the Mannikin tribe (Amadinae), they are rather different from
the typical Mannikins. The male is very distinctly different from
the female, whereas in all the typical Mannikins, the sexes are alike.
Also the mottling of the light brown plumage is rather unlike that of
other Mannikin species. A third difference is that the nestlings of the
Cutthroat Finch do not exhibit the characteristic horseshoe-shaped
marking inside the mouth. All Mannikins, in which nestling mouth-
markings are known, possess the typical horseshoe-shape, but the
Cutthroat nestling shows large blotches inside its mouth instead.
These and other facts make the Cutthroat a particularly interesting
species to study ; for, since it does not fit any too easily into its present
taxonomic position, any new data concerning it may help to improve
the way in which it is classified. In the present paper, however, I will
confine myself more to a discussion of the displays which this species
uses in its courtship behaviour, because until we know more about the
behaviour of many of the Mannikin species, it will be impossible to
make any statements about the possible evolution of the group. This
stage has yet to be reached. In the meantime, it is very profitable
to look at the courtship displays for their own sake.
The Song-and-Dance of the Male
The male Cutthroat differs from the female in appearance by
having, not only the famous " cut-throat ", but also a dark brown

patch over the belly region. However, owing to the startling sex-
difference provided by the red throat-patch, the brown belly-patch is
seldom referred to. It is nevertheless important, in the display of
the male to the female, immediately before copulation.
The male birds, when in full sexual condition, sing almost in-
cessantly. During most of their singing, they pay no attention to the
females, and do not orient themselves towards them. Throughout
this singing, the heads of the males are swung smartly and distinctly
from side to side.
In this species, as in several related ones, it has become quite clear
that this song does not have the same function, nor, apparently, the
same causation, as in many other kinds of birds. Typical song has
the effect of intimidating rivals--warning them off a territory, or
disputing a boundary--and of attracting females. It is primarily
aggressive. In the Cutthroat, the song appears to have not the slightest
threatening effect on other males, but, if anything, rather attracts them
to the singer. Also variations in aggressiveness and singing seem to
bear no relation to one another. This may be due to the distortion
of life in captivity, or it may be due to the fact that all this group of
birds have become semi-social and may nest together in close
proximity under circumstances that would make ordinary song and
territorial behaviour a hindrance.
Although song may be given by Cutthroats when several birds are
sitting together in one part of an aviary, it is more likely to occur
when a male is left alone, for example, when all the other birds are
down on the ground feeding. In the case of the Java Sparrow (Padda
oryzivora), which is also a member of the Amadinae, I only ever heard
a male sing when it was left alone by its mate. The Java Sparrow
song was very infrequent, however, and it appears that as the
frequency of singing increases, so the males may sing even when their
mates are sitting next to them on a branch, although even under these
circumstances it is still possible to detect that the song is more likely
to occur when no other bird is close at hand.
In the case of the Cutthroat and its relatives, the song is also included
as an almost non-stop accompaniment of the courtship dance of the
male. This courtship singing differs from the type described above
mainly in that the male now orients himself towards the female and
specially directs the singing at her, instead of into space. As he
sings, so he advances along the branch towards her. If she is
unresponsive and does not intend to be mated with, she hops or flies
away at this point. If she is moderately responsive, she remains
still on the branch as the male advances, her feathers sleeked, ready
for a quick take-off if necessary. If she is very responsive, she reacts
to the song and dance of the male with an invitation display. If she
gives this, it acts as a signal to the male that she is ready to copulate

with him. He responds by mounting her, their cloacae are brought
into contact, and insemination takes place. The male then dismounts
and usually both birds shake and preen themselves.
But what is the precise nature of the movements made by the
displaying male as he dances to the female, and what exactly is the
significance of the invitation display of the female ? All too often,
such displays are described simply as " comical antics They are,
however, much more than this to the birds concerned, being specific
signals which indicate the mood of the individual performing them.
Just as man-made signals, such as traffic-lights, must be quite precise
and rigid, so that their meaning cannot be misconstrued, so it is
found that animal signals are also quite fixed and rigid in form.
In the evolution of a species, a particular display movement becomes
uniquely associated with a special mood of the performer. Just as
the green light of a traffic indicator means exclusively go to the
motorist, so the invitation display of the female means mount to the
male. Just as the green light signifies that the cross-roads are clear
for the motorist to continue, so the invitation display of the female
bird signifies that she is ready to be mounted and will not flee. The
question remains as to why one type of display, rather than another,
should be performed by any one species in any one instance. Before
answering this it is necessary to describe the display of the Cutthroat
in some detail.
The Inverted Curtsey
As the male advances towards the female, he assumes an upright
posture, which is much more vertical than his normal stationary
pose. Also, his feathers are raised in a special way. Most of his
feathers are somewhat raised, but his ventral feathers are not all
raised to the same degree. Careful observation shows that the feathers
in the ventral region are differentially raised in such a way as to
exa SS era ^ e an d enlarge the brown belly-patch to a maximum. This
has the effect, viewing the bird frontally (as does the female Cut-
throat), of displaying the brown patch efficiently during the advance.
It is so swollen that the lower belly feathers reach down beyond the
branch on which the male is standing. Seen sideways, the bird appears
to have grossly over-eaten, there being a large brown swelling in the
belly region ! As the male advances in this posture down the branch
towards the female, it gives a rapid series of dance movements every
few hops it takes. It advances a little way, then, pausing, stretches
and bends its legs very rapidly a number of times in quick succession.
The body is held at the same, rather vertical, angle as it is raised
and lowered, and the general effect has been likened, by certain
authors, to the human curtsey. But a correction is necessary here,
for the first element of a human curtsey is a downward one. The legs
</bodyText>

D. MORRIS--THE COURTSHIP BEHAVIOUR OF THE CUTTHROAT FINCH I 73
start stretched and then bend and then straighten again. But the
reverse is the case with the Cutthroat. It begins with its legs bent,
straightens them, and then bends them again. Then, without pausing,
it repeats this action a number of times in rapid succession. Then it
stops dancing and hops nearer to the female, only to repeat the whole
performance over again. Each little dance is therefore a series of
inverted curtseys. But why should the dance take this particular form ?
By studying many such displays and movements, the general con-
clusion that has been arrived at is this. Animals often perform low
intensity versions of activities which do not lead to the completed
act, but which one can nevertheless recognize as being its first stage.
For example, when a man gets up from an armchair he leans forward
and places his hands on the arms of the chair and then rises. If one
watches the whole action take place a number of times, it soon
becomes clear, even if one only sees the man lean forward in the
characteristic manner, that he intends to get up. Thus the first
sign that he is going to get up is not actually seeing him rise, but
seeing the intention movements of rising. Footballers and boxers, for
example, make great use of the fact that human beings react very
keenly to intention movements. For instance, a footballer pretends
to kick the ball to the left and then, while his opponent is reacting to
that intention movement, he kicks it to the right. Reactions to
intention movements are very common in birds, and, in evolution,
it appears that certain intention movements and the appropriate
responses to them have become " fixed " as special inborn signals.
Not only that, but they have also become modified--usually exagger-
ated in some way--and now have the quality of rituals. During this
process of ritualization, the original intention movement, from which
a signal has been formalized, is often obscured by the now wildly
exaggerated version in which it is seen. But in the case of the Cut-
throat, and in a number of other cases, ritualization has not gone
so far as completely to mask the derivation of the display. For, if the
dancing male Cutthroat is observed closely, it will be seen that the
upward movement of each inverted curtsey is sharper, quicker, and
more forceful than the downward movement. This can only
mean one thing, namely that each series of inverted curtseys is a
series of intention movements of jumping up, and as the male is facing
the female, and, further, as the courtship ends with the male jumping
on to the back of the female, the jumping up in this case must mean
mounting. Therefore I interpret the dance of the male Cutthroat
as a series of intention movements of mounting the female.
But why, in the first place, should the male have been making
only intention movements to mount ? There are two possible answers
here. The first is that the sexual tendencies of the male may have been
thwarted by the female refusing to give any indication of readiness
</bodyText>

<bodyText confidence="0.994067386363637" page_id="58091279"  page_num="Page 174" year="" vol="">
to be mounted. In his sexually aroused, but thwarted, condition,
the male may then have kept on starting off the mounting action, but
never quite completing it, until finally the female gave the invitation
signal. It is easy to see how this situation could have evolved into
the present one. Alternatively, there is considerable evidence that
the male is afraid of approaching close to the female when he is courting
her. His upright posture and his hesitant advance, for example, lead
one to think of his mood as being basically a conflict between a sexual
tendency to mount the female and at the same time a tendency to
flee from her. The reason for the intention movements could, there-
fore, be that the male has to overcome his inclination to flee from
the female.
This second explanation applies more clearly in a related species,
the Zebra Finch, which I have studied in rather more detail. In this
species, the male also performs a song and dance as he approaches
the female, but, unlike the Cutthroat, he does not give the inverted
curtsey dance, but a lateral pivoting dance instead. He swings his
body from left to right as he advances, and as he does so, swings his
tail round even farther than his body, so that it is displayed to the
female. The male Zebra Finch also holds himself in an upright
posture and shows signs of being hesitant in his advance towards the
female. Each of the lateral swings of his body can be thought of as
intention movements of turning away from the female to flee from
her. The male turns away to the left as if to flee and then, his sexual
tendency getting the upper hand, he swings back towards the female
again. But this brings him closer to the female, and his tendency
to flee increases again and he turns away to the right, and so on.
Specific differences, such as the one described above, between the
dance-types of the male Cutthroat and the male Zebra Finch are very
helpful indeed in determining the relationships between species.
Work is going on at present to ascertain the dance-types of as many
species of Mannikin and Grassfinch as possible. It must be stressed
that a difference or similarity in such a behaviour character as dance-
type is just as reliable for classifying the species concerned, as is the
colour or marking of their plumage. In fact the two types of character
are often related, as I hope to show below.
The Invitation Display
Returning for a moment to the display of the female Cutthroat ;
when the male has danced to her for some time, she may give the
invitation display which consists of placing herself in a horizontal
posture, couching low over the perch. She then proceeds to quiver
her tail in a series of immensely rapid vibrations. They are so rapid
that, until they have been filmed in slow motion, it will be impossible
to analyse them fully. The main path of the vibrations, however,

appears to be a vertical one, but it is by no means as simple as that.
I said earlier that sometimes movements become ritualized to such
an extent that they are difficult, if not impossible, to relate to their
origins. This female display is just such a case. It is, in fact, the
most completely ritualized movement I have ever observed, and I can
only guess at its origin. Tentatively, it can be suggested that this
is a very rapid series of ritualized intention movements of fleeing,
presumably prevented from developing into actual fleeing by the
conflicting sexual tendency to remain near the male. In support of
this, the female is in the horizontal posture typical of the take-off
before leaving a branch. Also, flicking of the tail is often seen as
part of the usual take-off intention movement.
Again, here is a problem which will probably best be solved by a
wide comparative study of a number of related species, for there is
quite a chance that some species will not have ritualized the action
to such a degree and that its origin will then become clearer. Lorenz
found this in many cases with his ducks. Unfortunately, all species
of Mannikin and Grassfmch, in which I have observed the female
invitation display so far, appear to be equally ritualized. (But there
are many more species to be observed yet !)
The Display Markings
Finally, something must be said about the nature of the bright
colours and vivid markings which are used in display.
It is dangerous for animals to be too conspicuous because it renders
them too vulnerable to predation. Many animals are completely
cryptic and show no bright colours or markings at all, but a number
arrive at a compromise, d hey can be cryptic or conspicuous as the
occasion demands. 1 he one way of doing this is to possess a trans-
formation display of some sort, such as the inflation of pouches,
air-sacs, and the like, or to change colour during the breeding season,
risking the danger of attracting predators only during that time of
the year, in order to be conspicuous in display. The other way of
compromising is to be cryptic over that area which the predator
normally sees, and conspicuous over that area which the mate, or
rival, normally sees. This latter method is the one adopted by all
the Grassfinches and Mannikins. They are all cryptic from above,
so that when a flying predator looks down at them from above, say,
feeding on the ground, he cannot see them too clearly. All the
Grassfinches and Mannikins, as far as I know, without exception
possess back and wing plumage colour which merges with their
natural environments. Their ventral surfaces, however, are a different
question altogether. Here one finds bars, spots, bands, and patches
of colour and intense contrast. These are displayed to the female
by the courting males, and it is remarkable to note how frequently

1 /6 D. MORRIS-THE COURTSHIP BEHAVIOUR OF THE CUTTHROAT FINCH
the particular patch of colour or contrast, possessed by a particular
species, is displayed so well by the special dance movements and
posturings of that species. I will use the Cutthroat and the Zebra
Finch as two excellent examples of this. The former has a frontal
brown patch on its belly, and a frontal red patch on its throat. Its
display is performed facing the female, and the male fluffs out its
brown patch to the full, and then proceeds to shake it up and down
at the female. In the case of the Zebra Finch, the male keeps on
turning its sides to the female, and thus displays its white-spotted,
chestnut-coloured, flank feathers, which, although normally carried
inconspicuously inside its wings, are now fluffed outside them for the
occasion. Also, the male displays its chestnut ear-patches, one after
the other, as it pivots in front of the female. The twisting of its tail,
through an angle which makes it clearer for the female to see, also
displays a special marking, for the tail of the Zebra Finch is banded,
with intense contrast, in black and white.
A study of many such correlations, between bright markings and
display movements, has revealed that it is a general rule with animals ;
and further, that it seems likely that the movement has preceded the
colour in evolution. This is borne out by the fact that many species
of a group often show a particular movement, but not all have
developed a bright marking which can be displayed by it. It seems
that when a particular organ, such as the tail, is moved about in
display, any mutations which occur which make the tail of that species
more conspicuous, will be strongly favoured, since they will draw,
even more, the attention of the opposite sex to the displaying individual.
It is unnecessary to mention in detail the bizarre extremes to which
some species have taken this principle (Birds of Paradise, Pheasants,
etc.). Most species do not go too far because, as stated above,
predators as well as mates are likely to be attracted !
Conclusion
I have attempted to give some idea of the type of bird behaviour
analysis that can and is being carried out using some of the commonest
of aviary birds. This work is expanding rapidly at the moment and,
as a result, it is hoped that when a greater number of species has been
studied, both the interrelationships between the various species,
and the organization of their reproductive behaviour systems, will
be more clearly understood.
From the point of view of the classification of the group, the produc-
tion of hybrids is of the utmost importance, in order to obtain some
idea of their genetical make-up. Many Mannikin and/or Grassfinch
hybrids are reported in the literature, but photographs of them are]
rare, and descriptions are often too brief to be of much use. It is
hoped that, in the next few years, it will be possible to produce a large

variety of hybrids, with the aid of artificially increased day-lengths
and, if necessary, injections of sex hormones. However, this will
undoubtedly be a slow process, and it is also hoped to obtain valuable
information from some of the many private breeders of these birds,
who may already possess just those hybrids in which we are most
interested.

The sadly neglected dove family contains many a bird of great
beauty and loveliness. From the humble Barbary, with its laughing
call, gentle coo, and sober Quaker-like dress, to the more exotically
clad Green-wing with ruby bill and sparkling, vividly green plumage.
The dainty little Harlequin's moth-like flight has a charm which
must be seen to be believed--misty grey above and gleaming cinnamon
beneath, and in the cock, the orange and red bill foiled by its black
mask. The blue-grey, brown-flecked English Turtle-Dove's almost
purring note harmonizing so wonderfully with the sharp pheasant-like
call of the Vinaceous Turtle-Dove and the treble coos of the dainty
little rosy pink Senegal and the Necklace Doves. The latter with its
deep checkered collar and crimson ringed eye. How can anyone
say that the dove's song is monotonous ? Why, no two birds--even
of the same species--coo exactly alike.
Last year, two of the fawn Barbarys gave me a little white nestling
as a fellow to a fawn one. Also I believe I have an albino Barbary.
The difference between them is that the first bird has the space-collar
and yellow eye-ring of the "Java ", while the second has no suspicion
of a collar and a cream eye-ring with eyes that flash red in the sun's
light. Also I was lucky enough to breed two Barbary x English
Turtle hybrids.
Though perhaps few doves are brilliantly coloured (those which
are, are outstandingly so), all have a soft harmony of colour that
would be the envy of any dress designer and quite vies description
with their soft merging and mingling.
All the above-mentioned birds live quite happily in eight unheated,
grassed aviaries in a shrub planted plum orchard. The whole garden
is very well sheltered by pines, rhododendrons, a privet hedge, and
a gorse-topped turf bank, which does much to keep at bay keen winds.

There is also a largish goldfish pool, with pink and white water lilies,
and tiny artificial stream.
The houses of the aviaries are made of tongued and grooved wood
with heavy roofing felt on the roof, and on their north and east sides
for extra protection.
The birds are mainly fed upon split maize, paddy rice, and millet,
with sugar sprinkled bread and milk for all nesting Doves.
Rock salt somehow seems to increase the bloom on the bird's
plumage, and tends to intensify the colour, and we feel it is absolutely
necessary for the Green-wings. In their native home, I am told, they
frequent the salt-licks and it is believed there they die if they are denied
access to them for more than twenty-four hours.
As the doves are gathered from many countries, so are the trees
and flowering shrubs which surround them, and do so much to provide
a beautiful setting. The Bird Cherry blossoms beside the Indian
Catalpa Bean, Canadian and Japanese Maples, are backed by the
evergreens of Northern Europe, and the Liquidambers of America
glow among the silver birches and oaks of England. Rhododendrons
of many colours blossom in their appointed season. The wisteria of
distant China clings and rambles among the branches of our native
apple trees, one of which has mistletoe " in its hair ".
Goldcrests nest in the cedars, Sparrows in the ivy and tits--of
various kinds--in specially set-up nest boxes. Robins and Hedge-
Sparrows are housekeeping in the gorse bank. A vent pipe has made
a rather odd home for a pair of Starlings. Thrushes have reared a
family high up on the rhododendrons. Blackbirds and the Green
Woodpeckers, too, have nests somewhere in the garden. Brown
squirrels gambol among the Scots pines where the Wood-Pigeons are
nesting. A Nightingale, in summer, often sings in the apple tree
beside the window, but they have not nested in the garden. We do
wish they would !
The other day, when the doves were softly cooing, we were much
amused to hear that a little girl visitor--staying in a nearby house--
ran indoors calling out, " Auntie, Auntie, the lady over the hedge
has a garden that's simply full of Cuckoos ! "

An interesting and curiously coloured Plantain-eater, the Uganda
Black-faced ( Crinifer per sonata leopoldi), was brought back by Mr. Seago
during July. It belongs to the sub-genus Gymnoschizorhis of which, as
pointed out in recent correspondence, there are two forms. The body
colour is of soft pale shades of grey and brownish-grey, the neck is
white, and there is an incongruous looking patch of green on the breast.
A Varied Thrush ( Hesperocichla navia) has been deposited. This
and the Plantain-eater are new to the collection.

Perhaps the most interesting nesting event was that of a pair of the
Tawny Frogmouths in the Australian Collection. One egg was laid
and it contained a chick which had died when nearly ready to hatch.
1 he breeding pair of King Penguins' egg was infertile. As is well
known, these birds moult just before the breeding season and choice of
mates is dependent upon the time that the individual birds moult.
The breeding female preferred her old mate, though he did not
moult until some time later than she, and it may have been that he
was not ready to breed at the time the egg was laid. One of the
new females also laid and the husband appeared to be the bird

egg, but after a few days it was somehow broken. It could scarcely
have been fertile, for observations at Edinburgh show that these
Penguins do not breed until the fifth year.
The report that a young Green-winged King Parrakeet hatched at
the Parrot House had been destroyed by vermin is incorrect. Mice
have been exterminated, and the very few rats in the Gardens do not
get into the parrakeet aviaries. The old breeding pair of Green-
winged Kings have a fine young one which has just left the nest.
The " homing " Budgerigar aviary is now completed and contains
some fifty birds.

1 he most important part of the film, however, deals with the
Golden Eagle. For many years Walter Higham visited the Highlands
m search of eyries suitable for filming. At last, after fourteen years,
he succeeded in finding two of very different types. One was built in
a tree near the head of a glen, the other amidst rocks, high up on a
mountain side. The result of this perseverance is a fine series of
photographs of family life.
In thanking Walter Higham for showing his absorbingly interesting
film the Chairman said the technical quality was well in keeping
with the very high standard associated with this famous photographer.
The audience showed by its sustained applause that it was in full
agreement with this tribute.
The next meeting of the Club is on ioth November, 1954.

parts of Asia. Some twenty years ago it appeared suddenly in South
America. Just how it made the transatlantic flight and when is not
known. The birds flourished and within twenty years the flocks have
increased and spread, with the result that the species has now
been seen in Florida, where as many as 152 have been counted,
Virginia, Maryland, and other Atlantic Coast States ; also in New-
foundland. This is a bird migration unprecedented in history.

The Avicultural Magazine has now reached the venerable age
of three score years. While rejoicing in this fact, we must not overlook
a milestone in the existence of a journal with somewhat similar objects,
namely Foreign Birds , formerly the News Bulletin of the Foreign Bird
Exhibitors' League, now the magazine of the Foreign Bird League.
The League was founded in March, 1 933 ? an d has thus " come of
age ". The prime mover in its foundation, Harold King, is still the
guiding genius, being both Hon. Secretary and Editor, and it is due
mainly to his efforts that it is in such a strong position. It is worthy
of record that the President, Chairman, the majority of the principal
officers, together with some three hundred members, are also members
of the Avicultural Society.

L. Delapchier. Editions N. Boubee &amp; Cie. Paris, 1954.
Price 500 francs.
In the preface to his book Oiseaux de Cage , which was reviewed in the
May-June number, 1953, of the Avicultural Magazine, Monsieur
Legendre stated that he hoped to deal with the Parrots and Doves,
-vhich were not included in that book, in later volumes. The book
ander review follows the same lines as its forerunner, and the first
ind larger half is devoted to Budgerigars. The opening chapter is an
iccount of the original Budgerigar in Australia, and this is followed
)y chapters on the first importations, acclimatization in Europe,
:olour varieties, aviaries, bird-rooms and cages, feeding, breeding,
aming, and illnesses.
d he second part of the book, which deals with Lovebirds, opens
vith a description of the various species, after which there is a chapter
;ontaining general information. It is stated that the information
pven concerning the keeping of Budgerigars also applies very largely
o Lovebirds, so the various points are not dealt with so fully as in

(The experiences of a bird-lover between two ages and in two
worlds). By Wilhelm Kracht. Verlag Gottfried Helene,
Pfungstadt-Darmstadt. Price 5.90 DM.
As Dr. J. Steinbacher says in his Introduction, this book is the
story of the varied life of a man who is both an expert at bird keeping
and a great bird-lover.
In the first chapter Wilhelm Kracht describes his early efforts at
keeping and rearing birds in a small village in Westfahlen where no
one had any knowledge of this art, and relates that the first bird he
kept was a Blackbird. He gives a vivid description of the countryside
and the life at that time--the last part of the nineteenth century--
and concludes the chapter by giving a list of the different species of
birds he kept. The author then describes his experiences in Paris
where he had a post, and his first visit to the Paris bird market. His
journeys then took him to Madrid where he again paints a word
picture of the life and country, with particular attention to the birds
he kept there. This is followed by an account of the time he spent
in Berlin, his friendship with the Heinroths, and the many species of
birds he kept in captivity. In 1913 he went to Odessa, where he states
he reached the peak of bird keeping ; he remained in Russia for six
years and returned to Germany in 1918, where he lived in various
towns, always keeping birds or maintaining his interest in some way,
and finally settled in Freiburg. Wilhelm Kracht has lived during
a period of great change and visited widely differing countries, and
he writes vividly of his impressions, the life of the countries he has
lived in, the interesting people he has met, and the many different
species of birds he has kept, varying from small passerine birds to
various species of Eagles. His book contains much interesting informa-
tion gained from his own practical experiences.

The Effect of Climatic Conditions on Breeding Results
It has long been the custom to associate inclement weather occurring in Spring
and early Summer with low fertility in foreign birds' eggs--probably rightly, but is
it as simple as that ?
Naturally warmth and sunlight will have a more cheering effect on tropical and
sub-tropical birds than will dull cool weather, but what is the extent of the physio-
logical effect ?
Bad weather seems a likely cause of a falling off of interest in nesting after early
promise that so often happens, but in these cases no eggs are laid. The causes of
infertility in birds' eggs must be many : there may be a lower concentration of
sperms in cold weather, or, though fertilization might be adequate, activation of the
germ does not take place or ceases at an early stage.
Spermatogenesis in domestic poultry is thought to be partly related to the length
of daylight and by early April there are more than twelve hours of daylight.
Climatic conditions appear not to have any effect on the nesting of some birds.
Black-footed Penguins breed in winter here ; Cereopsis Geese usually nest in January ;
Hooded and Brown's Parrakeets in October, and Indian Ringnecks in March, so in
these cases, at least, there seems to be some cyclical influence.
Then there are so often the exceptions. This year, for instance, Mikado Pheasants
and Cape Teal have bred exceptionally well at Leckford and Turquoisine Parrakeets,
the most delicate of the Grass Parrakeets, have bred well at Keston.
Controlled experiments would be very difficult and expensive, but it would be
interesting to see whether another ten degrees of warmth and some artificial sunlight
supplied where practicable during the Spring made any appreciable difference.

When I first came in contact with the Avicultural Magazine, I read that it was
a magazine for British and Foreign Birds. So far, I have only read of the higher
priced foreign birds (with the exception of once, when Mr. Boosey gave an article
on Zebra Finches). Would it not be possible to have more notes on the more common
birds ; we are not all millionaires, and while the more exotic birds make interesting
reading for the richer people, they do not interest the common everyday working
class. I would like to read more about the British biids and cheaper foreign finches,
etc. There is very little in the Magazine to interest me at the present time, and
I believe it would be of more interest to a lot of subscribers if articles such as I have
just mentioned were more frequent. No offence now please ; I'm just writing what
I think.

I entirely agree with the sentiments expressed in this letter, and am only too anxious
to receive articles on the more common birds. It is quite a mistaken idea that because
a bird is commonly kept in captivity there is nothing more of interest to write about it.
When Mr. Delacour came to write his monumental work on Pheasants, he found a
great lack of information regarding the Golden Pheasant, one of the most popular
species kept in captivity. And with regard to ornithology in general, it is significant
that though there have been monographs written on many of the rarer species,
knowledge regarding the House Sparrow is lamentably small.-- Editor.

MAGPIES AND SQUIRRELS AS MENACES TO AVICULTURE
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.99598915625" page_id="58091291"  page_num="Page 186" year="" vol="">
Although they are pests, I had never thought of either the Magpie or the Grey
Squirrel as actual avicultural menaces. Both, it is true, will frighten birds by running
about on top of their aviary, but so will an innocent stray homing-pigeon that alights
upon it.
I now know, however, that the presence of Magpies and Grey Squirrels gives cause
for far greater anxiety.
The late Duke of Bedford's breeding pair of Blue Ringnecks hatched every egg and
had four young ones in the nest. In the middle of May, however, when they were at
the stage when they are only just starting to feather, but are too big to be brooded,
the weather became more and more arctic every day, so, on looking in the nest-box,
I was hardly surprised to find that the three youngest had died of cold. The fourth
was better-clothed and eventually fledged successfully. It had, however, a habit of
clinging on to the wire netting, and a few days later was found dead with a chest
wound. The Magpies had been taking a great interest in it, and I have little doubt
it was they who killed it by jabbing at it through the wire netting. Had it been
murdered by its parents they would almost certainly have scalped it.
A pair of Roseate Cockatoos reared a fine brood of three, and not long after they
fledged the feeding door was mysteriously found wide open, the birds, fortunately,
being still in the aviary.
The button closing the feeding door was somewhat loose, and through a chink, the
sunflower and monkey nuts could be seen from outside. A Grey Squirrel had fre-
quently been seen in the vicinity and inspection of the aviary disclosed a mass of
scrabblings of its toe-nails on the woodwork, particularly round the feeding door.
I think there is little doubt it had discovered that by turning the loose button, it could
get inside and feed, particularly as on the day of the discovery of the open door not
a scrap of food of any kind was left in the food vessel.
The door is now secured by a small bolt, and there has been no further trouble.

Since writing this I have actually seen the squirrel carefully examining the new
door fastening so there is no doubt whatever that he was the culprit.

We thought Chestnut-flanked White Zebra Finch a better name for the new
variety, as ordinary Whites usually throw a proportion of young that are ticked or
marked with grey. These, at any rate in this country, are quite often referred to as
marked White Zebra Finches, and this might well cause confusion between them

As usual, very little has been written about this Conure in the wild
state. One of very few writers, J. F. Hamilton (1871), describing a
small collection of birds made in the south of Brazil in the spring of
1869, says : "Very common. I met them frequently in the neigh-
bourhood of maize-plantations, on which they commit great havoc.
Along the Sao-Paulo railroad flocks were frequently seen flying over-
head." Not very enlightening ! But then field-collectors rarely are.
Possibly the first of this species to arrive in this country were the two
purchased for the London Zoological Gardens in May, 1869 ; five
were purchased in June, 1883, since when there have, of course, been
others in the Collection.
D. Seth-Smith (1926) says : "I am informed that some of these
Conures were offered for sale in London in 1898 ; and three speci-
mens, two males and one female, were obtained by the writer on
August 24th, 1903."
During the past fifty years just a few have been imported from time
to time, wars and parrot ban permitting, and in 1924 a pair owned by
W. Shore-Baily successfully reared a nest of four young ones, for which
event the Society's Medal was awarded.

A REMEDY FOR AIRPLANE WING

In the summer of 1954, at the Delta Waterfowl Research Station,
Delta, Manitoba, where my mother and I have spent several seasons
raising young marsh birds from the egg to study their behaviour and
development, I was asked by Dr. Martin Moynihan to look at one
of his young Franklin's Gulls, because its right primary joint had
started to turn out.
On examining both wings I discovered that the primary pin
feathers were just starting to develop, and that the affected bone was
noticeably more flexible than the normal one.
I told him what I had been told by Peter Ward, the head of the
duck hatchery, and by two zoo men, that the underlying cause of the
weakened condition of the developing bones was some unknown
deficiency in the diet. I thought, however, that the immediate
cause of the twisting of the joint was the weight of the developing
primaries, and suggested that if the joint were taped into the correct
position it might grow normally.
(The year before, when the wings of one of our hand-raised Franklin's
Gulls were constantly slipping down, I had put them in the wing
pockets several times, telling the young bird kindly but firmly to keep
them there. The next day and from then on the gull carried her
wings properly. I had been equally successful this summer with the
only hatchery raised Blue gosling, although it was not particularly

tame. I think that these young birds, without close association witli
adults of theii species, had never happened to discover the proper
and comfoi table adult method of holding their wings, but almost
immediately adopted it when shown.)
Dr.. Moynihan taped the joint into position with ordinary Scotch
tape, just before putting all the young gulls to bed in the dark. Starting
the next day, the joint was held in the correct position. He found this
method completely successful on his two or three gulls whose primary
joints had turned out.
It did not matter whether they were taped as soon as he noticed the
condition or two or three days later, or whether the bird was able
to 1 emo\ e the tape very quickly, or whether it stayed on for several
hours. Sometimes he had to apply the tape for two or three nights
ovei a period of several days before the bird held its wings normally.
In the case of our hand-raised Sora Rail, whose primaries were
ahead) at least half an inch long, I taped both her wings off and on
over a period of a week. However, it was not till the last time that
I obseived her brothers and sisters carefully and tucked her growing
primaries as far under her secondaries as they were holding theirs.
The next day and thenceforward the Sora held her wings correctly.
Also on Peter Ward's advice, Dr. Moynihan immediately bought
a vitamin-mineral supplement, Polynutrin, and sprinkled it on the
birds' food. . None of the younger birds showed any indication of
developing airplane wings.
We never taped the wing to the body, but just the primary in the
proper position under the secondaries, and always removed the
Scotch tape some time the next day, holding on to the feathers under
the tape to try to keep from pulling them out or tweaking them.
The birds often lost a few small feathers, but this did not spoil their
appearance.
\\ hether taping the wings of a bird whose primaries had developed
further would bend the joint into its proper position, and whether the
bird would then hold it so, I have no idea.
In September, 1954, Dr. Konrad Lorenz told me that he treated
airplane wing by making a roll of Scotch tape with the sticky side out,
and putting the upper side under the secondaries and sticking the
sheathes of the developing primary pinfeathers on to the lower side
of the roll, so the primaries were held in the correct position. The tape
was left in place until it dropped off with the feather sheathes.
This method should be less annoying to the birds than having the
tape wrapped around the outside of their wings, and it certainly
would be less trouble to have to tape the wing only once.

By Derek Goodwin (Virginia Water, Surrey, England)
The Pigeon ( Columba livid) is among the commonest of birds in
British towns, as well as elsewhere throughout most of the temperate
and tropical regions of the world. Ornithologists have, however,
tended to ignore this species wherever its populations were derived
from or interbred with domestic stock. Finn (1921) in his book on
London's birds, included it under the name " Common Pigeon ",
a very apt one, as this bird is the Pigeon of the layman. Unfortunately,
Fitter (1945) used the name " London Pigeon " and later he and
Richardson (1952) misleadingly applied it to all feral pigeons,
irrespective of locality or origin. Naumann (1833) gave a most
interesting and detailed account of the status and habits of feral,
dovecote, and domestic pigeons in Germany, and Darwin (1859 and
1868) dealt with the appearance and distribution of dovecote and
domestic pigeons throughout the world. The present paper deals
chiefly with observations on feral birds, but some notes on wild birds
are included, and most of the behaviour patterns described are, of
course, common to all members of the species.
The following terms will be used to designate different categories
of Columba livia :--
Rock-Pigeons-- wild populations of C. livia.
Dovecote Pigeons --pigeons nesting or roosting in dovecotes, pigeon-
towers, barns, etc., exploited by their " owners " for food (young-
pigeons) or dung, but not selectively bred or confined in any way, and
not usually fed by their owners.
Feral Pigeons --pigeons living in a free and ownerless state, but which
have originated from Dovecote or Domestic Pigeons.
Domestic Pigeons. --Pigeons kept under a greater degree of control
subject to selective breeding by man and fed by him.
Homing Pigeons. --Any domestic pigeons kept and bred for their
ability to return home when released at a distance. Such birds are
usually subjected to rigid control and selection by man, and regularly
fed. The breed now used for this purpose in Britain (and elsewhere)
is known as the Racing Pigeon or Racing Homer. The Carrier
Pigeon is a purely fancy breed, and has been so for at least two
centuries.
Flying Pigeons. --Any domestic pigeons kept for the entertainment
they afford their owners by their flying when liberated. This may
consist of height and duration of flight (tipplers, cumulets), or
aberrant forms of flight (tumblers, rollers, sharpshooters). Many
fancy breeds have been derived from Flying Pigeons, and still bear the
same names. (For example : Long-faced and Short-faced Tumblers,

I Exhibition Flying Homers, and Show Homers.) These breeds are
subject to control and selection, and are usually kept closely confined
except when liberated to perform.
Fancy Pigeons. Domestic Pigeons of any of the numerous breeds and
sub-breeds that are kept and bred solely for their appearance and to
conform with some artificial " standard of excellence ". Many of
these birds are monstrosities, incapable of feeding their own young-
owing to their abnormal skull and bill structure.
1 igeon. The species C. livia, where the remarks made apply equally
to wild, feral, or non-monstrous domestic birds.
The Origin of Feral Pigeons.
That all Domestic and Dovecote Pigeons owe their origin to the
Rock Pigeon ( Columba livid) and to no other species is fully established
(Darwin, 1868). I have met many ornithologists and pigeon-fanciers
who doubted this fact, but none has any valid evidence to the contrary.
Fertile hybrids have been produced between C. livia and some other
species of Columba (notably and rather surprisingly, the Woodpigeon
(C. palumbus) among them), but the domestic breeds show no trace
of such hybrid ancestry. Where they differ most from the Rock-
Pigeon they differ equally from all other wild species. That the
markings or structural developments of some Domestic Pigeons show
similarity to those of certain wild species not even con-generic with
them is of no significance in this respect (see Darwin, 1868).
The existence of clearly differentiated breeds of Domestic Pigeons
dates back at least to Roman times (Darwin, 1868), but the practice of
keeping, or rather exploiting, Dovecote Pigeons has, at any rate until
recently, been practised on a far larger scale than the breeding of
domestic varieties. Such Dovecote Pigeons were (and usually still
are) very similar to Rock-Pigeons in type. In England and Western
Euiope (and doubtless elsewhere) they were mostly either of the
natuial blue colour or blue chequers ", " dark blue chequers ", or
velvets , that is birds showing varying degrees of melanism resulting
in the wing-coverts being spotted with black on a grey ground, pre-
dominantly black with some blue-grey spotting or completely black.
Theie is some likelihood that 4 4 chequered " birds may occur among
wild Rock-Pigeons (Darwin, 1868, Petersen a Botni and Williamson^
1 949 )&amp;gt; but no proof, as such birds have always been observed in areas
vvheie it is possible that feral or domestic birds could, at some time,
have interbred with the wild ones. Conversely, of course, it is only
in such places that the occurrence of aberrant specimens is likely to
be noticed.
The Feral Pigeons of most parts of the old world appear to have
been derived originally from Dovecote Pigeons that strayed to find
homes for themselves, with a slight admixture of strayed or lost

Domestic Pigeons. Of the latter, only such as approximated to a
Wild Pigeon in form and ability would have survived and successfully
reared progeny. Hence the general similarity of Feral Pigeons to Rock
Pigeons rather than to the various Fancy Pigeons is because, for the
most part, they are descended from birds equally like the wild stock.
There is no need to postulate some hypothetical and semi-mystical
" reversion to the wild type ". In the past century, and more especially
in the last fifty years or so, the widespread popularity of pigeon-racing
has had an enormous effect on the feral population of Britain. Homing
Pigeons get lost in large numbers during training and racing. Most of
them are physically capable of getting their own living and many
which appear psychologically incapable of fending for themselves in
the fields are able to adapt to the more directly parasitic role of " town
pigeon In Britain (as in many other parts of western Europe), the
resultant constant influx of lost Homing Pigeons has coincided with a
widespread elimination of Dovecote Pigeons by man, and with con-
tinued periodic destruction by him of large sections of the feral
population. Because of this the Feral Pigeons in many places are now
predominantly of Homing Pigeon type.
As was pointed out by Darwin (1868), Dovecote Pigeons normally
show characteristics in common with the Rock Pigeons of the same
geographical area, particularly as to the colour (white or grey) of the
rump. Hartert (1912-1921) considered Domestic Pigeons to have
originated separately in various places from different sub-species of
Rock-Pigeon. This is doubtful. It is known that many of our Flying,
Homing, and Fancy Pigeons were first brought to Europe from the
Middle East or India, and it is likely that such breeds as were " made "
in the west were derived from these already domesticated birds rather
than from pristine wild stock. Dovecote Pigeons may have been
derived independently from local wild stock. On the other hand,
their resemblances to the local Rock-Pigeons might be due to inter-
breeding with them, or to similar environmental influences being at
work on the Dovecote Pigeons as on the wild ones.
Sociability arid Segregation of Populations.
In all its activities that are not purely reproductive, the Pigeon
is gregarious. It does, however, like most social birds, defend its
roosting perch and an area around the nest which varies in size
according to circumstances. For a detailed account of sexual and
aggressive behaviour see Heinroth (1943). This sociability is not
simply a matter of many birds wishing to exploit good feeding, bathing,
or resting places at the same time. The lone Pigeon will actively seek
a companion to rest near. A good example was given by a female in
my possession, which I hand-reared after it had fallen from its nest.
When it began to fly about it soon discovered some Barbary Doves

(Streptopelia nsoria) in one of my aviaries. Previously it had spent
most of its spare time in a shed where it roosted, or in an adjacent
garage. After finding the doves it did all its day-time resting and
preening perched above them on the wire roof of their aviary. If they
were not in the open part, but in the shelter, the Pigeon rested on a
ledge outs^e their shelter window, through which it could see them.
Ihis Pigeon is blue, its parents were a blue and a blue chequer. It
had never in its life seen a Pigeon of similar colour to these doves, yet
it evidently recognized them (? by shape and movement) as " the
nearest thing It was not at that period reacting sexually to the
doves, but regarded me as its mate, and left them to seek my companv
whenever I appeared.
Tha * Feral . and Domestic Pigeons interbreed in many cases with
Rock-Pigeons is familiar to all, since it is mentioned, often emphasized,
in most accounts of the species. The far more interesting fact that in
many places there is very little interbreeding--relative to the apparent
opportunities for it--between Feral, Dovecote, and Rock-Pigeons on
one hand and Domestic Pigeons on the other has received little
attention, although it was remarked upon (Adams, 1864) brieflv
nearly a century ago. This is very noticeable in the Nile Delta, where
the Dovecote and Feral Pigeons are very similar to the local Rock-
Pigeons (C. livia schimperi ), but the Domestic Pigeons are mostly much
larger and white, pied, or red in colour. Such relative segregation
may arise, partly through birds tending to pair with those in the same
colony (though I know no proof of any such tendency), partly through
uman interference, but also partly, I think, through the preferences
o the birds themselves. It is known that in many species of pigeons
and other birds, recognition of their own kind is not innate, but occurs
through the young bird identifying itself with the creature which has
reared it and/or with which it has been reared. This is probably
true for C. livia. It is certainly a fact that the young Pigeon will often
show a strong preference to pair with another similar in appearance to
those which reared it, or among which it spent its early days. Such
preference may be most striking in members of the more unusually
coloured domestic breeds and is generally thought to be due to
their being " instinctively " drawn to their own aberrant kind.
It is, however, a result of " imprinting " ; such birds only show this
trait if they have been reared by, and spent their youth with, pigeons
like themselves.
Th us whenever the majority of Domestic Pigeons differ appreciably
in appearance from the majority of Feral (or Rock or Dovecote)
l Pigeons it is likely that barriers to interbreeding arising from
differences in ecology will be reinforced by the acquired mating
preferences of the birds. In countries, such as Britain, where the
keeping and racing of Homing Pigeons is practised on a large scale,

the situation is very different. Here thousands of lost Homing Pigeons
are scattered widely throughout the country every spring and summer.
The vast majority of those which survive join other Domestic Pigeons
or Feral Pigeons in towns, but presumably some join cliff-dwelling
Feral or Rock-Pigeons. A lost Homing Pigeon that joined a flock
of Rock-Pigeons would perforce have to accept one of these as a mate.

Since it would be used to seeing companions of this colour--among
others--it would have no aversions to so doing. Apart from colour
(which in many is identical with or similar to that of the Rock-
Pigeon), a Racing Homer differs from the wild form being larger,
having a proportionately heavier bill, larger cere (called " wattle " by
pigeon-fanciers) and more bare skin (" cere " of pigeon-fanciers) round
the eyes. It is unlikely that these differences would deter a Rock-
Pigeon from pairing with a Homing Pigeon, at least if the latter
were blue or blue-chequer in colour. Indeed, it is conceivable that
if the Rock-Pigeon were the female and the Homing Pigeon the male,
their differences in size and head proportions might be mutually
attractive rather than otherwise. The difference between them being,
in effect, an exaggeration of the normal sexual dimorphism, which is
slight in the Rock Pigeon but more pronounced in most strains of
Homing Pigeons.

Despite its theoretical probability, however, there seem to be few
actual records of mixed pairs of Rock and Feral Pigeons. In a brief
trip to the Shetlands last June, I saw apparently pure Rock-Pigeons
within a mile of Feral Pigeons that showed no trace of wild inter-
mixture. Mr. W. B. Alexander informs me that he suspects that small
groups of Rock-Pigeons still exist in some of the Yorkshire and Welsh
cliffs, maintaining their purity in spite of the large Feral Pigeon
populations in the same areas. It is quite possible that where Rock-
Pigeons have been replaced by Feral Pigeons this has been achieved
through their " going under " in competition with the latter rather
than extensive interbreeding between them. For example, safe rain-
proof nest-sites may often be scarce. Where this is the case a pair
that can obtain and hold such a site will, in the course of a very few
years, rear many more young to independence than will a dozen
other pairs that are forced to " make do " with inferior nesting places.
Some Local British Populations.
In some instances these observations are little more than impressions
based on brief visits of only a day or two. They are in such cases
offeied very tentatively rather to stimulate further investigation than
for any other reason. The dates and duration for which such popula-
tions have been under intermittent observations are given in brackets.
Inner&amp;apos; London (1936-1940 and 1947-1934). --Here the Pigeons show
every mtergradation between a small minority almost if not quite
identical in type with the wild form and a much larger minority
which, although unringed, are to all appearances pure Homing-
Pigeons. The majority are about mid-way between these two
extremes, but inclining to Homing Pigeon rather than otherwise.
On the whole the smaller Dovecote Pigeon types are more numerous
in the most central districts, suggesting that the influx or establishment
of lost Homing Pigeons has been greatest in the peripheral areas.
I have never seen a ringed bird (" first generation homer ") among
the small parties, pairs or singletons that one finds busily searching
for food in back streets, railway stations, etc., and hardly ever failed
to spot one or more in any flock waiting to be fed in a park or square.
I have dealt elsewhere (Goodwin, 1952) with the colour-varieties
of London's pigeons, but must emphasize here that there is no correla-
tion between colour and type. Homing Pigeons, or for that matter
Fantails, may be identical in colour with wild birds.
H indsor. Most, if not all are of Homing Pigeon type, some indi-
viduals are, however, rather neater and smaller than most Homing
Pigeons, and may represent Dovecote Pigeon origin.

had increased to at least two hundred, probably many more. These
birds fed inland during the day and returned during the afternoon
and evening to roost on the cliff ledges. Most of the roosting places
offered little shelter and I saw no pigeons entering any of the holes
or crevices, all of which seemed to be owned and defended by Jack-
daws. All the pigeons seen at close quarters were Homing Pigeons
or their immediate descendants.
Bristol {September , 1933, and May , 1953, two days only). --Here, as in
London, I got the impression of stocks derived from a Dovecote Pigeon
nucleus, now in process of being swamped out by Homing Pigeons.
A small colony near the station were largely of Dovecote Pigeon type,
had they been a little smaller one or two of the blues could have
passed for Rock Pigeons. Most other birds seen were, however,
close or identical to Homing Pigeons, and ringed birds were plentiful.
Lerwick {June, 1934, two days). --The many Pigeons I saw in the
streets and about the dock were of Homing Pigeon type. About half
were racers bearing rings. Most of these appeared to be having a
hard time, and their tails had been pulled out. About a dozen pairs
of Pigeons were nesting in some boxes fixed to an old barge not far
from the harbour. These were of mixed Dovecote Pigeon and Homing
Pigeon type. None of the birds showed any signs of inter-breeding
with wild stock, and there were no aberrant birds among the Rock
Pigeons I saw on Noss and Bressay near by. I did, however, see a blue
Pigeon and a black pied flying together below the cliffs a short distance
from Lerwick, but was not close enough to see whether the former
was a Rock Pigeon or a blue Homing Pigeon. Lerwick is a major
liberation point for pigeon-fanciers who fly " the north road ", so
that there is likely to be a constant addition of Homing Pigeons to the
local population.
Predators and Competitors.
There can be little doubt that the most important non-human
predators of adult Rock-Pigeons are falcons, particularly or perhaps
mainly the Peregrine {Falco perignnus). I have never seen Rock or
Feral Pigeons attacked by falcons, but I have seen a good many
pursuits of Homing Pigeons by the Lanner {Falco biarmicus) in Egypt.
The Lanners are hardly so swift or strong as Peregrines, and I think J
they were usually attracted because the circling of our " nomad " I
Pigeons, about a basket in the desert, suggested an exhausted or |
injured bird to them. When pursued the Pigeon would usually fly j
low and swift, jinking slightly sideways or downwards at the moment I
that the Falcon struck or attempted to seize it. The Lanner invariably j
missed at its initial stoop, and then would sometimes rise for another
attempt, but more often would chase the Pigeon in swift, low flight.
Often the Lanner on overtaking the Pigeon would appear to fly right

over it. . I his, I think, was due to the Pigeon swerving downwards at
the critical moment. The Lanners seemed unable or unwilling to
keep hold of the Pigeon, as often the latter would be knocked to earth
two or three times, yet finally escape. The chase commonly ended
with the Pigeon managing to return and dive under the army truck
or between our feet. When chased by a falcon, Homing Pigeons--
which are usually very hesitant about entering any strange enclosed
place--will dive headlong into any hole or shelter that offers. A few
would dodge the stoops and circle upwards, trying to gain height.
I imagine these tactics would prove fatal with a Peregrine, and they
perhaps represent an abnormal response by domesticated birds It is
however, amazing how stereotyped and perfect the escaping tactics
usually are. I remember well my astonishment on seeing a young
oming Pigeon that had only been on the wing a few weeks and had
never seen a falcon before, fleeing and dodging in typical manner
as though it had practised escaping from falcons every day of its life
I hese escaping movements are also used by the Pigeon when
pursued by Sparrows.. Both the House and Spanish Sparrows (Passer
domesticus and P. hispamolensis ) have a habit of chasing pigeons and other
large birds. The sparrow flies surprisingly fast close at the Pigeon's
side as if trying to peck it under the wing. The Pigeon behaves
similarly to when chased by a falcon except that it does not go into
shelter, thereby indicating that it is not so frightened as it appears to be.
Gats, owls, Snapping Turtles, and various other creatures have been
recorded as taking Rock or Feral Pigeons, but I have little or no
personal experience of these predators in relation to them.
In towns, such as London, where they rely largely on bread given
oy the public, Feral Pigeons suffer much from the competition of
Dther birds. They cannot carry off bread as a passerine or gull will
io, nor can they swallow large lumps like a gull or duck, or easily
Deck them to pieces like a crow. The annual influx of wintering
31ack-headed Gulls greatly reduces the amount of food available to
^ondon s pigeons.
To what extent Feral Pigeons living in the country--and Rock-
_igeons--suffer from food competition from other species is unknown
*fj would think that both the Rook (Corvus frugilegus) and the
ackdaw ( Corvus monedula) might exercise a considerable influence as
hese species also feed largely on grain. The Wood Pigeon {Columba
&amp;apos;alumbus) is probably not a serious competitor since although fond of
,rain and weed-seeds when these are available in quantity, at other
imes it relies largely on acorns, nuts, berries, and greenstuff. The
\0x25A0tock-Dove ( Columba oenas), however, appears to feed not only on the
f me fields, but actually on the same foodstuffs as country-living
eral Pigeons do. Much detailed and careful work will have to be
one before it can be ascertained if&amp;apos;, and to what extent, the two

species compete, but it seems at least possible that the remarkable
increase of the Stock-Dove in Britain and western Europe during the
past hundred years is not unconnected with the contemporary decrease
in the numbers of Rock and Dovecote Pigeons. It would be interesting
to know if there is any region where Rock-Pigeons and Stock-Doves
are both plentiful, and if so whether they there share the same feeding
grounds and compete for the same foods.
Relationship with Man.
Most Feral Pigeons are dependent on man-made buildings for their
nesting and roosting sites. Man's reaction to their presence ranges
from welcoming them as guests or even as sacred birds, as in many
Buddhist and Muslem communities, to active dislike and attempts
to destroy them in many western countries. In Britain and America
the slight disfigurement of buildings by the birds nests and droppings
is considered to justify their destruction.* Such destruction is usually
of a sporadic or haphazard nature, undertaken by officialdom against
the wishes of the majority of people. In London, at any rate, it has
no permanent effect, the periodic mass destruction merely encouraging
a higher breeding success in the survivors. As with man, so with the
Pigeon, it usually happens that the fewer the number of individuals
in any given area, the higher the standard of living which each enjoys.
In country districts Feral Pigeons (and Domestic ones too !) may be
shot for sport or to protect crops. They are, however, often spared
by sportsmen who do not wish to risk shooting domestic birds. Most
unfortunately Rock-Pigeons breeding in natural sites do not share
this relative immunity. Many British pigeon-fanciers have a great
dislike of Feral Pigeons, particularly if they approach Rock-Pigeons
in appearance. Such men kill every ownerless Pigeon that comes into
their lofts, and often deliberately decoy them down for this purpose.
Man destroys many of the Pigeon's natural enemies in his own
interests, real or supposed. It seems likely, however, that even if
he gave such enemies a free hand, the Feral Pigeons would show only
slight diminution of numbers, and this would consist for the most part
of inexperienced juveniles and birds suffering from disease, malnutri-
tion, or injury. These latter often drag out a miserable existence
for months or even years in districts--such as inner London--where
predators are rare.
Much of the food of town " Pigeons is deliberately given to them
by man. Thus the subjective feelings of pity, friendliness, or com-
passion which they evoke in man (or woman) is of the utmost biological
importance to them. The relative slowness of peristalsis in this species,

and the resultant posturings as the hungry bird with gullet over-full

result of this, and perhaps also of official anti-pigeon propaganda,

some of the people who feed the birds in London's parks make every
endeavour to prevent the Pigeons obtaining any of their bounty.
Even in country districts, Feral Pigeons are largely dependent, albeit
indirectly, on man, since most of their feeding grounds are produced
by his activities. The same is true to some extent of Rock-Pigeons.
A study of the feeding ecology of Rock-Pigeons in areas where they
do not use man-made feeding grounds would be of utmost interest.
Feeding Ecology.
From this aspect Feral Pigeons can be roughly grouped into two
main classes ; those feeding in the countryside and those feeding-
inside towns. In their feeding habits the first group do not differ
from such Dovecote Pigeons or Rock-Pigeons as may be getting their
living in the same area. Feral Pigeons dwelling in cliffs, ruined
buildings (in the country), old barns, quarries, and similar places get
their food outside the towns, but the converse is not always true.
In some towns all or part of the Pigeon population may fly out into
the surrounding country to feed, returning to roost and nest on the
buildings. The same individuals may--though not very commonly--
feed both inside the town's streets and in the surrounding fields.
Food is sought on the ground. Pigeons normally alight to look for
food only where the earth is either bare or covered only with short or
scanty vegetation. Cultivated land, particularly arable fields and
stubbles, is usually chosen where available. Fields of hay and corn
are visited as soon as they have been cut, but the birds do not often
settle among standing corn, as does the Wood-Pigeon (Columba
palumbus). They may come into stackyards and about farm buildings,
particularly if Domestic Pigeons are kept there. They may even under
certain circumstances (Naumann, 1833) feed in woodlands on the
fallen seeds of conifers and other trees. Exceptionally they may feed

in trees on growing buds or berries. This I have only seen in Kensing-
ton Gardens, but it has also (Szemere, 1948) been recorded in Hungary.
This is probably an acquired habit which perhaps originated by a
bird which had perched in a tree to rest, observing a Wood-Pigeon
or some other bird feeding.
Besides seeds of many kinds, some of the more quiescent forms of
animal life are also taken, particularly small snails. Cultivated grain
(especially wheat) and pulse and the seeds of vetches are favourite
foods. In Kensington Gardens they habitually search for and eat
such acorns as are, or can be, broken up. Naumann (1833) observed
Pigeons swallowing whole acorns. This I have never seen, and all
my efforts to get the Kensington Garden birds to do so have been
in vain. That they are perfectly capable, physically, of swallowing
and digesting small whole acorns I have proved by feeding them to
a young one that I was hand-rearing, whilst it was still at the stage
when it would blindly swallow anything I put into its mouth. For
a comprehensive list of foods taken by Feral and Dovecote Pigeons in
Germany and by Rock-Pigeons in Scotland, the reader is referred to
Naumann (1833) and Macgillivray (1837).
Feral Pigeons living in towns often, and in England usually, feed
inside the town itself. Some natural food is obtained from exposed
earth or grass plots in parks and gardens, but the greater part consists,
as a rule, of bread or other artificial food which is given to them by the
public, or obtained by scavenging. Large numbers congregate in
parks and squares where they are regularly fed. Others seek food
in the roads, railway stations, dockyards, and so forth. Grain spilled
from horses' nose-bags once constituted an important food source,
but owing to the decline in horse-traffic it is now a negligible one in
most places. Bread is usually the staple food, since being cheaper it is
given in greater quantity than any other, but grain, pulse, peanuts,
or cheese are always taken in preference except by individuals that
have not learnt that these substances are edible. Cooked meat, fat,
bacon rind, apple, potato, chocolate, and other sweetmeats are also
eaten, at least by some individuals. The need for lime, especially
by breeding birds, prompts them to eat the mortar from buildings.
This they can only do where it is already sufficiently loose and crumbled
for their weak bills to detach pieces of suitable size. The popular
idea, largely spread by professional pigeon-killers with an axe to grind,
that they are capable of harming sound buildings in this way is, of
course, ludicrous.
Feeding Behaviour and Recognition of Food.
It would be of great interest to know to what extent (1) likely feeding
grounds, and (2) food, are recognized innately. Normally the young
Pigeon follows older birds to the feeding areas. Similarly adult birds

are often attracted to new feeding grounds by seeing other pigeons
flying to or alighting on them. In any flock there are usually
experienced birds who will probably " recollect " previous experience
at sight of a new-cut stubble, new-sown cornfield, or other man-made
feeding ground A pigeon usually remembers any place where it has
found food and returns to it again next time it is hungry. It seems
that, in the absence of the greater stimulus of experienced birds going
e sewhere, 1 lgeons instinctively alight on relatively bare ground and
away from the immediate vicinity of trees when seeking food. It seems
certain that they have an innate tendency to go to the ground when
hungry, for hand-reared young ones that have never been fed at ground level
will do so if left without food. Probably nobody would have thought
o putting food for pigeons in the many barren town squares where
they are fed, had not hungry birds first alighted in them to search
for food.
Pigeons feeding in open country commonly set off for their feedino-
. grounds in flocks, although they may do so singly or in the company

at the feeding ground alight either at once or after some preliminary
are mg. is latter hesitation is due to the birds being somewhat
afraid to alight or undecided exactly where to do so. It is not a
e iberate attempt to make sure that no enemy is concealed near by.
Such hesitation is seldom shown if the birds are very familiar with
the feeding place, or if there are other Pigeons already feeding there.
Once on the ground the birds walk about rapidly with heads down
peering closely as they go, and stopping or turning aside to pick up
anything edible they see. In loose friable earth, leaf-mould, chaff,
etc., pigeons (all species of Columba and Streptopelia whose feeding
e aviour is known as well as the present species) will search for
buried seeds by turning over the substrate with their bills. The bird
uses a quick sideways flicking movement of the head, whereby some
oi the loose earth is thrown to one side. Although less like the normal
movement of picking up food, and hence one might suppose more
specialized, this movement does not seem any more efficient than
the &amp;apos; pecking with closed bill " of gallinaceous birds. Pigeons do not
oiten dig m this manner except where they have already found some
grains or have been accustomed to find them.
Homing Pigeons and Flying Pigeons that are allowed their liberty
frequently go into the fields to feed in spite of regular and plentiful
supplies of food. This habit most often starts when they are feedin*-
young. They are generally believed--probably correctly--to do so in
search of snails and other animal food. If this is so, it suggests an
innate urge to seek such foods--which are not normally sought after_
even though the diet supplied is sufficient to rear apparently perfect
young. Any reader who keeps Homing Pigeons which have not

hitherto " gone fielding 55 could make valuable observations by
noting full details about its first occurrence, where the birds first alight,
and what appeared to induce them to do so.
Pigeons feed by preference mostly on seeds, which are swallowed
whole. There would seem to be no possibility of a sense of taste in
any way similar to our own, giving the bird clues as to the edibility
of new objects. Adult pigeons make no attempt to " show " food to
their offspring at any stage. The method of parental feeding does
not enable the young one to see the food it swallows, and under normal
conditions the young pigeon does not appear actively to seek food
until the parents have ceased to feed it.
A young Pigeon will, if hungry, and if no creature from whom it
is accustomed to be fed is within sight, commence to peck at all sorts

of small objects that contrast to some degree with the substrate.
These are picked up, held a moment in the tip of the bill, and dropped
again. If some edible seeds, such as grains of wheat or dari, are found,
the bird will almost invariably eat them. The first grain to be eaten
will, however, be picked up and dropped again many times before it is
finally swallowed. The second will be taken with much less hesitation,
and the third--if the young Pigeon is really very hungry--probably
with none at all. Whatever items are first swallowed will, at this first
meal, be taken exclusively until they are all gone. This behaviour
does not seem to be on quite the same plane of trial and error as the
feeding of young game-bird chicks, since the young Pigeon does not
usually swallow inedible substances. It may indeed refuse--even
though starving--to eat many palatable foods at this stage.
If other Pigeons are present when the young one first starts to
feed itself, its behaviour is somewhat different. It shows interest the
moment it sees another Pigeon pick up food. The young bird at once
runs to it, looks eagerly when it pecks again, and tries--always

unsuccessfully--to take the morsel from the other's bill tip at the
moment it is picked up. This will be repeated again and again
(perhaps interspersed with vain but frantic outbursts of food-begging),
and one has the impression that the young one " knows " that the
morsel actually taken by the old bird must be edible, but does not
realize that other similar grains, over which it may be treading as it
tnes to seize the one in its unwitting mentor's bill, are equally so.
Suddenly (perhaps as a result of clearly seeing the actual morsel the
ot lcr picked up) realization comes, and the young Pigeon starts to eat,
usually with much less hesitation over the first grain than it would
have shown had it been " learning to feed " alone. None of the
hesitation shown by the young Pigeon at this stage is due to insufficient
maturation of the innate feeding movements. In a natural or feral
state the young one does not feed itself until after it can fly well, and
has left the nest. It can, however, as every pigeon-keeper knows, be
taught to eat freely long before it can fly, by placing a supply of corn
eside the nest, so that it constantly sees its parents feeding themselves.
Also adult Pigeons confronted with some food new to them behave in
the same manner except that they are--other things being equal--
usually quicker on the uptake ". There is much individual variation
in the speed of both adults and young when " learning " new foods
Pigeons do not learn to eat bread so readily as they will seeds!
Nevertheless, they soon do so if they are famishing and other Pigeons
are eating it. Ghopped-up cooked meat, another unnatural food like
bread, but one that is given very little by the public, has been learnt
by very few Pigeons (in London, at any rate) which will leave bread
to scramble for it whilst the majority ignore meat if there are known
foods, such as bread, available. Pigeons always " learn " more quickly
to take strange seeds of small size--millet, dari, wheat, canary seed,
emp, etc. than larger ones such as maize, tic beans, or shelled
peanuts. This bears no relation to their choice when " experienced ".
It is difficult to see the utility of this behaviour. It can hardly be to
guard against the ingestion of unsuitable food, since once it has
convinced itself of the edibility of some new food and swallowed the
first morsel, the Pigeon will always continue to eat. Thus it will--if
there is enough available--consume as great a bulk of a food consisting
of small particles as of larger.
Since the war the Pigeons in inner London have been fed chiefly
with bread. Knowing that Pigeons that have once learned to eat
them usually take peanuts in preference to other foods, I experimented
y giving peanuts and millet to many different groups of London's
Pigeons. It was obvious that the birds had no previous experience
of millet. Its unfamiliar appearance when thrown to them often
made them fly up in alarm and show fear when approaching the
millet-strewn ground. Most have, however, eaten the millet after

only the briefest hesitant " picking up and dropping " and with two
exceptions (out of very many hundreds tried), all the individuals
to whom it was offered ate it within a few moments of the first birds
to do so commencing. With peanuts (shelled but whole) the results
have been otherwise. Of the birds which obviously did not " know "
peanuts, many have refused them, often after picking them up several
times. The majority of Wood-Pigeons to which I offered peanuts
would not even pick them up, although the very few that " knew "
them took them eagerly in preference to anything else. To my
astonishment, a starving young Wood-Pigeon, so weakened by hunger
that it tottered and stumbled repeatedly and showed no escape
reactions, repeatedly refused to swallow even broken-up peanuts
(which inexperienced pigeons take at first more readily than whole
ones, because of size), although repeatedly seizing them eagerly when
thrown to it and lifting and dropping them. This bird could not have
been flying more than three weeks, it had learnt to eat bread, but had
evidently not succeeded in finding sufficient food.
A young Feral Pigeon which fell from its nest (in South Kensington)
when about three weeks old, was hand-reared, chiefly on milk-sop,
wheat, peanuts, and millet, although it was also fed small amounts
of meat, cheese, crushed egg-shell, grit, and acorns. After it had
reached the age when it would normally have been fully independent
(I had deliberately made no attempts to encourage or coerce it into
feeding itself) it would no longer let itself be fed sop (which nestling
pigeons take more eagerly than dry grain), closing and withdrawing
its bill if it felt sop in my hand, but opening it and gulping eagerly if
it felt grain or peanuts. At this period it began to pick up and swallow
wheat or millet grains that were spilled during feeding. When I
" pecked " at a peanut with my finger the bird immediately showed
interest, but I had to repeat the process for several days running
before it at last swallowed one of its own accord. Thereafter they
became its favourite food. It did not eat bread--in spite of attempts
to make it do so extending over several weeks--until I had kept it
without food for some thirty hours. During this time bread, suitably
broken up, had been available in dishes from which it habitually fed,
but had been untouched. The bird was by then very hungry, but by
no means near starvation point, and after a great deal of finger tapping
and proffering bread in my hand, I at last persuaded it to eat a little.
This specimen had come from a bread-fed population and the relative
slowness with which it learned to eat this food suggests--as does
observation of their condition--that the majority of " squeakers " in
London are actually starving when they first learn to feed themselves.
The same may be true for wild pigeons.
The above examples (and many similar ones that might be quoted)
suggest that seeds from about millet to pea size present C. lima with

innately recognized visual and possibly also tactile stimuli. Such
foods as bread seem to supply no such stimuli. Most Pigeons first
begin to eat them through the example of others. Some individuals
may learn to eat such foods either through extreme hunger inducing
them to sample it or because it is offered by a human being from
whom they are conditioned to expect edible gifts. Initially some bird
or birds in each area must have learnt to eat bread in some such
manner. Nevertheless, Pigeons that are starving may, in the absence
of others which take them , refuse such foods as bread and peanuts if they
have never seen them before. This they may do after repeatedly
picking them up, holding them in the tip of the bill, and dropping
them, thus showing that this behaviour pattern is not--as it often
appears to be--a means by which a Pigeon can deduce the edibility
of any object. It is true that Pigeons often discard bad grains (of a
species they are accustomed to eat) after such treatment, but this may
be due to the bird appreciating the difference between the visual and
the tactile stimuli after it has learnt what " good " grains look and
feel like. Jays ( Garrulus sp.) and Wood-Pigeons will at once discard
a bad acorn after similar treatment.
The eating of and apparently deliberate searching for invertebrate
life sometimes shown by Pigeons that are feeding young, suggests an
innate impulse to find such food and to be able to recognize it when
found. It would be interesting to know whether this is a result of
the birds being in a certain phase of the reproductive cycle or whether
it depends on the diet being deficient, to some degree at least, of food
elements needed at this period. I have noticed that captive Pigeons
of many species are eager for such foods as cheese, cooked egg, and
milk-sop when they have young. A pair of Turtle Doves (, Streptopelia
turtur) which I kept many years ago, and on which I made no precise
or written observation, fed chiefly if not entirely on seeds except when
feeding young, at which time they ate quantities of milk sop. A pair
of Palm Doves (caught as adults) which I kept in Egypt (Goodwin,
J 947) fed entirely on maize until they hatched their young, when
they commenced to take broken-up peanuts and lentils--both foods
of high protein content--as well. Whitman (1919) found that most
of his pigeons would eat earthworms at this period, possibly their diet
was somewhat faulty and the many weaknesses which he ascribed to
hybrid ancestry may not always have had this as a sole cause. I have
never known pigeons eat earthworms--though I have offered them to
many species--but I strongly suspect that the London Wood-Pigeons
do so.
The eating of greenfood (leaves and shoots of various plants) may
pei haps often be due to an otherwise deficient diet. I have never seen
Pigeons in the country eating greenstuff and none of the Domestic
Pigeons I have kept have eaten it except in very small quantities.

On the other hand I have seen Domestic Pigeons that would devour
cabbage, lettuce, and other greenstuff avidly. Some in the Cairo
Zoo during the war years appeared to be fed on nothing but white
maize, and these poor birds would fly madly to the wire to devour
anything green offered to them, swallowing leaves, stalks of dandelions,
and so on, in a manner unlike anything I have seen before or since.
Roosting , Nesting , and Related Behaviour.
Rock-Pigeons nest and roost in caves. Where available sea-caves
appear to be preferred, probably a result of selection through survival,
because persecution by man has fallen less heavily on populations in
such sites. The nest is placed either on a ledge in a cave, or, less
often, in a hole or crevice in the cliff-face. The nest-site is often in
semi-darkness and usually well inside the cave. Little detailed
evidence about roosting is available. On Fetlar, in the Shetland
Isles, I was shown a very large, almost cathedral-like cave, from the
roof of which depended large sloping ledges of rock. There was no
place in this cave where a Pigeon could have nested, yet large numbers
had evidently used it as a roosting place for many years. None were
" at home " when I visited it (on an afternoon in late June, 1954),
and it is possible that it was only used by non-breeding birds. In a
small dark sea-cave occupied by an incubating pair, the cock roosted
on a ledge near the nest. Much remains to be found out about the
behaviour of the truly wild Pigeon, and a comparative study of feral
populations is equally desirable. In some parts of the world Rock-
Pigeons have taken to living in buildings. Where doing so their
habitat preferences do not seem to differ from those of Feral Pigeons.
The roosting and nesting places chosen by Feral Pigeons are, in
effect, the nearest artificial equivalents of natural sites. The girders
under bridges, church belfries, ruined buildings, large railway stations,
and old castles are commonly favourite haunts. Any sort of suitably
sized hole, nook, or sheltered ledge may be used for nesting. If they
fail to find any better place, a pair will sometimes nest on an exposed
ledge, usually without success. Although the favourite roosting
perch would seem to be the equivalent of " a ledge in a big cave " the
birds often roost regularly on ledges or roofs with no shelter from
above. They never roost " on the skyline " (although lost Homing
Pigeons may, exceptionally, do so), but always with a solid wall of
some sort on one side of them.
What are the essential " sign stimuli " that guide a Pigeon in its
selection of a nesting or roosting site ? That remains a question that
perhaps some of our members will be stimulated to solve, and I can
only offer some tentative suggestions. Pairs of Pigeons seeking a
nesting site seem strongly attracted to any conspicuous " dark
opening ". I have often noticed in London that when new blocks of

Places Th &amp; ,&amp;apos; g T r SCem '* lack initiative over roosting
places The many birds that one sees roosting night after niriit
exposed to wind and rain could in most cases find better places, but
once having established the habit of roosting in a particular place,
ne\er seems to occur to them to seek for a better one. They will'
however, often desert their roosting place if they are frightened at it by
or some other predator. What causes apparently unsuitable
roosting places to be initially chosen is difficult to understand. Roosting
on exposed ledges seems to be rather more general with Feral Pigeons
of Homing Pigeon type and ancestry, but this may merely be because
these tend to be more numerous in smaller, newer, towns wfth relatively
few buildings that offer shelter. The disinclination to seek a fresh
roosting place except under the stimulus of fear, is easily explicable
So long as the bird remains alive and fit for reproduction, there will be
no selection against individuals that stick to an accustomed roost in
&lt;P of dls "mfort. Indeed, since such a roost has for some time
proved safe &amp;apos; there may well be selection in their favour.
n the other hand there will be selection in favour of pairs that
show initiative in seeking a suitable nest site, since the apparent optimal
site for the adult--sheltered and in semi-darkness--is that where the

at although m a pigeon-loft pairing often or usually takes place
through a hen being attracted by a cock " calling to nest ", yet it is
evident that in a feral state many pairs form prior to either partner

eaung them free outside the loft together by themselves as by shutting
them in the male's nest-box. &amp;

The nesting behaviour of Pigeons is well-known and has been
described in some detail by many authors, correctly by Heinroth
(1948), and with varying degrees of inaccuracy by most others.
One point about the parental feeding, that so far as I recall is not
mentioned by Heinroth, should be discussed, as it applies equally to
other species of Columbidae, and is of importance to aviculturists.
The parent at first feeds the squabs with pigeon's milk that forms in
the upper part of the crop. When they are a few days old it begins

also to regurgitate the food in its crop, of which the young can at this
age swallow only small or soft morsels. If one watches the parent
feeding one will see that after each regurgitation it re-swallows some
food in its gullet. At about four to five days old the squab s crop will
contain pigeon's milk plus some small seeds (if these have been
available to the adult), and perhaps some soft food or animal matter.
A little later the young one can and does swallow anything the parent
regurgitates.

The Pigeon&amp;apos;s milk, I suppose because it lies above the food in the
am1 part of the crop, is fed off first at each feed. If both squabs are
equally vigorous, both will get a share. Indeed, the parent often feeds
both at once (see sketch). But if one of the yoting /older or stronge

Unfortunately, in some parts, and in America, different terms are
used for some colours.

birds the grey of the rest of the plumage is also darker, and the black

Velvets. The " Red " colours are usually rather infrequent in Feral
Pigeons, except where these have been derived largely from Homing
Pigeons, in which these colours are frequent.
Git^zle. A pattern, difficult to describe, in which all the feathers
are curiously streaked and intermixed with white. They vary from
the " light print " which is predominantly white with dark-tipped
primaries, and some dark feathers in its head and neck, through
various shades of grizzled grey (with darker wing bars), and the same
in the " red " colours.. In juvenile plumage grizzles are usually
much paler than they will be after moulting.
Black. The deep solid black found in some fancy Pigeons is rare
in feral birds. But specimens of a uniform slaty-black are not
uncommon.
Pieds .--.Any of the colours mentioned may be pied, that is, marked
with white, the underparts, rump, primaries, and head being the
parts most often affected. Such birds are common among Feral
Pigeons in English towns. Gay-pieds--that is birds with more white
than coloured plumage, are rarer. Pure white birds--other than first
geneiation escapes are most uncommon, although Gay-pieds coloured
only on tail and scapulars are much less so.
Silvers. A dilute form of blue, ground colour silvery cream, with
grey-brown instead of black markings. Rather rare and, when they
occur in feral population, almost always females.
Barless Mealies.--The term is sufficient description. Not uncommon
(perhaps one in 2,000) in London.
Some other colours, such as mosaics occur very rarely (in feral
populations). Most of the colour varieties described are subject to
some variation. Thus blues may be " smoky ", a dull dark grey
ground colour on wing coverts ; " silver blue ", of a bright pale,
silvery hue ; " plummy " with pinkish eye-rims, a peculiar dulling of
the plumage and much non-iridescent wine-red colour on the upper
breast .; or pencilled " with slight black marks along the vanes of
the wing-coverts. But it would have taken up too much space to
describe fully such minor variants of each colour phase.
Sexual Dimorphism and Juvenile Plumage.
In the Rock-Pigeon the visible sexual differences are slight, and the
biids are difficult to sex accurately from their appearance. Generally
the male has a slightly bolder head, and the iridescence on the neck
is more intense and often more extensive. In Homing Pigeons and
Feral Pigeons that approach them in type the male usually shows a
larger cere (" wattle " of pigeon-fanciers) at the base of the bill, and
his bill and head are altogether bolder and coarser-looking. But unless
one knows, one is dealing with related birds this is often of little value.
Some strains of Homing Pigeons have much larger bills and wattles

Pigeons of any of the " red " colours (I am talking now of Feral
and Homing Pigeons, not of fancy varieties specially bred for colour),
generally show a difference in colour by which they can be at once
correctly sexed if in adult plumage. Most males show small blue-grey
or black marks--like little streaks or splashes of ink in appearance--
on the webbing of the tail and wing quills. In the females these marks
if present at all, are brownish in colour. All the sons of a red "
hen Pigeon are always reds (mealies, red-pieds, red grizzles, red
chequers, etc.), unless they are albinos, no matter what colour male
she is paired to.
Juvenile Pigeons are generally duller than the adults, and have only
a very little iridescence on the neck feathers, which are not bifurcated
like the adults'. If they are going to have rich purplish colour or wine
colour on the upper breast, the feathers of these parts are tipped with
rusty brown. The " reds " are browner and more gingery than they

will be after moulting, the " blues " duller and often darker, the
chequers have their wing markings less distinct. Grizzles are usually
much paler and are often almost entirely white, it is surprising to see
the near-white juvenile moult into quite a dark bird, as it often does.
Young blues sometimes have the wing-coverts edged with dull whitish.
Sometimes a juvenile will show beautifully laced blackish or reddish
edges to the feathers of its wing-coverts. Such birds moult out, as a
rule, into very ordinary and unattractive " blue-pencils " or " straw-
berry mealies " (a sort of clouded pattern between a light red chequer
and a mealy).
The juvenile usually shows two areas on the wing (see sketch) where
the feathers--before it commences to moult--show the adult colour and
pattern. The feathers in these areas are indeed not exactly the colour
they will be, or rather will be replaced by after moulting, but they
are very close to it, and in the more deceptively-coloured juveniles
they enable one to guess pretty accurately what the bird will in fact
look like when adult.

By Dorothy A. Jakobsson (Ferndown, Dorset, England)
The best and least expensive way, in our opinion, for safeguarding
one's birds from little wild creatures is to maintain a bodyguard
of well-fed neuter cats. I stress well fed, as no weary, ill-nourished
animal will delight in the sport of the chase. It may catch a stray
mouse for food--if spry enough--and there the matter ends. My cats
bring me in rats, stoats, weasels, mice, or young rabbits daily, and take
no notice whatsoever of the doves when prowling around the aviaries.
I am afraid they occasionally catch a wild bird, then what right have
we to say them nay, who breed birds merely for food, or box hens in
tiny cages that they may produce more eggs for our pleasure !
Lewes, Muezza, and I angy Tim are real pets, and while always
having access to the house and a cosy corner beside the fire in which
to sleep, frequently toil out through rain or snow and bring home
their catch in due season.

My aviaries are merely raised--on a foundadon--a couple of bricks
high, never once have I lost a bird through rats and the like. I must
mention though that the actual sleeping quarters--where the doves
are fed--are three feet up from the ground. All the aviaries are
surrounded thickly with flowering shrubs, and the grass during
flowering time is hay-high, giving perfect cover to any wild creature
seeking such protection. Water also abounds in the vicinity--pools,
a small stream, and boggy land near-by.
Perhaps it is not generally known that an old law--never repealed--
still exists whereby anyone can be fined y. for not keeping a cat if
a near-by householder can prove the vermin doing the damage came
from the former's premises. Of course, in this age of high sounding
phrases, the offence is termed " for not taking proper care in the
destruction of obnoxious vermin ". In days agone, it was so judged
that a person might not have the money with which to buy mouse
traps, but a cat could always be kept, and as it could be maintained,
in the main, from table scraps there was absolutely no excuse for not
having one.
Is this the real reason, I wonder, why cats are still untaxed when
almost everything else upon the earth is ?

SOME REFLECTIONS OF A SOFTBILL

For nearly twenty years I have kept quite a number of softbills
year in and year out without interruption. So much effort, time,
money, and above all, regard for the birds, have gone into this pastime
that I should like to pass on a few of my reflections and reminiscences
to other interested persons, in the hope that they may prove interesting
as well as informative, and perhaps even helpful in some way.
Prior to moving into the beautiful San Fernando Valley in 1 93 2 ?
I had never kept softbills or, in fact, any kind of birds, except pigeons,
which usually do not come under this classification. I well remember
my modest beginnings : I started off with, of all creatures, foreign
doves, getting a pair of Diamond Doves and other small varieties from
the late Mr. Eighmey, of Costa Mesa, a dealer and a birdlover. Soon
after, I obtained a variety of small finches, whose behaviour, however,
seemed rather stereotyped to furnish continuous and lively interest for
me over a period of years. Soon my attention was directed to singing
softbills advertised in various domestic and foreign bird and pet
journals. Then the fun--and also some work--began.
Happily do I recall my first softbill, a beautiful Shama fl hrush,

with forcing a bird to drink, but it was effective, foi the biid began
slowly to take an interest in his surroundings, but still he would not
touch the soft-food mixture I had prepared for him. So, having read
that Clarinos are fond of flies, I got busy at once and caught flies,
numbers of them, till it got too dark--and I was greatly encouraged
by the bird's taking them at first gingerly, then eagerly. By evening
the Solitaire's plumage was almost smooth, and he did not bury his
head in his wing-feathers any longer. I felt I had won the battle--with,
of course, the bird's co-operation. Next morning, I looked after the
Solitaire the very first thing, finding him quite well and willing to take
mealworms and other food. Day after day this luminous-eyed bird
improved, and it was not a week before he began to sing his flute-like
melody which somehow carried me back to the stillness of the High
Sierras, where I had journeyed in my younger days and where
Solitaires usually build their nests in the shadow of waterfalls. So
utterly different from any other bird's song was the Solitaire s that
I could hardly trust my ears, for I did not know that any bird was
capable of making such exquisite music. Though not as active as the
Shama, and certainly not as nervous, this Solitaire, being easily cared
for, became tame quickly. He especially relished freshly caught flies
and moths, but he would also take mealworms.
These two good songsters constituted the beginning of my softbill
venture, which to date has brought me many, many joys and occasional
disappointments. Twenty years ago I was pretty ignorant of such birds
food requirements, even though I had made it my business right from
the beginning to purchase and consult English and German authorities
writings on this subject. It seemed that in Europe during the greater
part of the year, live ant-eggs constituted the principal food of captive:
softbills. It was asserted that they were so complete and effective in
nutritive values as to satisfy almost any softbill s requirements com-
pletely--no additional foods being needed. But here in America live
ant-eggs were not available. Of course, I eagerly read advertisements,
concerning various softbill food mixtures, purchasing this and that
mixture in order to determine its merits. Always it was maintained
that the food was 44 complete "--meaning that the bird fed with it
required no other food, except perhaps a few live mealworms once or
twice a day. Soon, however, I learned that my softbills did not like the
commercial Mockingbird food, that they ate but very little of it, and
that their general condition was not noticeably improved by it.
Moreover, the birds would sing but little or not at all on this mono-
tonous diet--to me a sure sign that their daily food lacked something
quite essential.
So gradually I began to experiment by adding certain items to the
soft-food, such as moistening it thoroughly with freshly grated raw
carrot or sweet apple, enriching it with finely chopped hard-boiled

I learned also that tastes of softbills differ widely, and that at times it
requires considerable time and patience to accustom any softbill to
a food he has not eaten before. I had often read in various foreign
books that milksop was relished by certain species of softbills. However

and a subsequent visit to his aviaries, proved quite enlightening, as did
a visit also to Alex Isenberg's avian establishment
It was inevitable that in the beginning of my softbill hobby I should
make blunders, resulting largely from giving the wrong foods. Thus,
a disastrous blunder I made was to feed a delicate, wren-like bird quite
a number of mealworms on the advice of a Japanese bird-dealer m
Los Angeles from whom I had purchased the lively creature.
I remember correctly, the bird was a Japanese Wren. At any rate, it
was modestly coloured--brown all over, tiny, and very, very live y.
A lapanese woman who was in the store at the time of my purchase,
wave an imitation of the bird's call which, to the best of my recollection
was something like " Uguisu, Uguisu ! " Sorry to relate, the bird did
not utter these--or any other--notes while he was m my possession,
where he lived but three or four days. Had I cut the mealworms into
small pieces or had I soaked them in warm water to soften the hard
shells, this charming, vivacious wren might have been mine to enjoy
and to care for a long time. It could not, of course, digest the hard-
shelled worms. For days the loss of this rare little bird saddened me
Hard as I tried to obtain another specimen--they cost $15 ^ hlc ^ at
that time was a good price--such was not to be had since but few had
been imported from the Orient. The loss of this bird taught me an
important lesson-carefully to adapt the kind and the texture of the
food be it in natural or in commercial form, to the needs of eac
individual bird. Different softbills have different tastes and these
manifest themselves in a variety of preferred foods. It is up to their
keeper to determine as best he can, what foods keep certain birds in
sound condition year in and year out. If he is genuinely concerned
about the welfare of his feathered charges--wants to see them healthy
and happy day in and day out-he will constantly endeavour to find
new items of food and new food combinations, trying them out very
carefully and gradually so that his birds' digestive mechanisms may
adjust themselves readily to them, and without any ill after-effects. In
other words, the new food or foods are given in addition to the regular
daily menu and the birds are left to try them out themselves. It was
in this manner that I learned that most of my softbills like peanu
butter very much. Now I keep jars of this nutritious item in every
aviary the year round. Even my foreign doves take peanut butter wit
o-usto. But Indian flycatchers, Yuhinas, and shrike, added recently to
my little collection, have not touched the peanut butter as yet. I hey
no doubt will in due course of time. I never thought that softbil s
such as, for instance, Golden-fronted Fruitsuckers would eat fresh
lettuce. Nevertheless, such is the case with mine--as well as with othei
softbills. It must be quite tasty to these birds because they have beer
in my aviaries for many years, a number of them for fifteen years, an
quite a few over ten years. Recently I " discovered " pecan-meal a:

making an excellent addition to the softbill mixture. Finely ground it
is easily mixed with the other items. The birds eat it readily and
apparently it does them good. Not long ago I read an advertisement
ottering wingless fruit flies (drosophila) to fish fanciers. I purchased
several cultures of these small flies in glass bottles some weeks ago, and
I have been feeding the flies daily to a pair of jaunty Yuhinas. They
make a lot of musical fuss " the moment I place a dish with fifty or
more of the tiny flies in their cage and they eat them in a hurry. I am
convinced that these flies would serve as an excellent live food also for
wrens, sunbirds, and humming birds, even though the two last
mentioned might prefer flies that can fly. But my Canyon Wren takes
them avidly. Since these wingless flies, feeding on decaying fruit,
multiply fast, they are easily and quickly raised in numbers. In all
softbill feeding, it is self-evident that the more natural we can constitute
the daily diet, the more conducive it is likely to be to the birds' health
and general well-being. Live food being the most important item in
most softbills' natural diet, I make it my business to take every spider,
moth, butterfly, angleworm, beetle, etc., to my birds the moment
I catch it take it, mind you, with a sort of boyish triumph as if I were
bringing them an unusual delicacy--and maybe I am ! Always I find
certain birds requiring some extra attention, extra care, extra food.
Softbills exude individuality. My business is to cater to this charming
trait in every possible way. Years ago I learned that giving my birds
extra attention pays large dividends--in improved health of the birds,
in more and better singing, in greater tameness and friendliness. Over
the years certain birds, such as a Solitaire, a fruitsucker, a Shama,
and a wren, simply expect extra service from me. They fly to me the
moment I approach their cage or enter their abode, begging for titbits,
which usually they get. I try never to forget that my birds are my
responsibility--my very deserving responsibility !
But to return briefly to one of my main topics--initial blunders.
Another blunder, one that I made several times, caused me consider-
able chagrin. A fellow birdlover (?), calling at my aviaries, would
persuade me to let him have this or that bird, which he wanted
" oh, so terribly much ! " Twice I have given in to such pleas, only to
be very much disappointed some weeks later by the report that this
person, not finding the birds to his liking, disposed of them on short
notice and without making any sincere effort to learn their good
qualities and to fit them into his collection. In this connection my
many years of keeping softbills have made me sensitive to the birds'
feelings and reactions, perhaps.too much so. Softbills' feelings, it seems
to me, are very easily upset. Being captive, they must endure so much
fear from man, so much cruelty--directly and indirectly.

distances, then caught again, only to be again transferred from cage
to cage and aviary to aviary. Its whole life pattern is being changed
by this process, changed suddenly, often ruthlessly. The bird has to
change many of his habits to conform to his keeper s whims and
wishes. It is in constant fear of being caught up, dashing against
cage-bars or aviary wire in a mad attempt to escape the grasping hand
or enveloping net. No wonder that many softbills (and hardbills, too)
require months, if indeed not years, to recover from such maltreatment.
Some of them never recover, shown partly by the fact that they simply
will not sing or breed in captivity, not only because they are wholly out
of their accustomed milieu , but because they are mentally and physically
shocked. Other softbills regain, after a time, their ability to sing,
provided they are given humane treatment and patient care.
When one considers the fear which captive birds are subjected to,
especially when caught up and transported, one finds it difficult indeed
to justify the hobby of keeping such live birds as softbills. Many birds
simply die from the effects of fear--the strain is too much for
their delicate constitutions. Assuredly, the hobby of keeping softbills
is in most cases nothing more than just that--a hobby, a personal
pastime. It has practically no so-called scientific aspects or values.
To be sure, occasionally this or that, more or less rare, species of softbill
is successfully raised in captivity, and a general account of its breeding
is reported and published in the avian press. But in many instances
this account is far too general, too superficial to disclose essential habits
of either parent birds or youngsters, or both. A report of such habits
to have even the semblance of scientific character and value, would
have to be based on continuous, day-in and day-out, very thorough
observation of certain birds' behaviour. But such thorough-going
observations are foreign to most keepers of softbills since, apparently,
their recording would entail too much concentrated effort and writing.
If, then, a species of foreign softbill has been induced to breed in
captivity, and does so successfully, by all means let its owner report
this success--but as a personal achievement more or less, not as a
scientific one. And let such report be written from the standpoint of
the hobbyist so that other hobbyists may benefit from it. It is regret-
table that so many keepers of softbills cannot or will not communicate
their observations and experiences through the printed word to other
like-minded men and women. Go through the issues of this magazine,
for example, and count the number of articles devoted to softbill-
keeping and you will find few of them, not because softbills are
not kept by many people and often in considerable numbers, but
because their owners are reluctant to report on their collections, often
greatly underestimating the value of their observations and their
experience.
I have kept softbills for nearly twenty years--and I keep them to-day

-lor one principal reason-their ability to sing. So I more or less
confine my hobby to obtaining male birds of singing species and try
o induce them by means of good care to entertain and inspire me with
tien songs. o me it is a never-failing, joyous surprise to hear a
leccntly acquired bird sing for the first time. Shama and Dhyal
Thrushes have, on the whole, proved my finest songsters, followed by
European Nightingales, White-Cheeked Jay-Thrushes (really whistlers)
European Elackbirds, and many other species. Freshly imported
softbills, if not frightened out of their wits by frequent and rough
handling in transport, will sometimes sing soon after arrival in my
aviaries. Some, however, will require a season or two of acclimatizing
and adjusting to new surroundings and of freeing themselves, so to
speak, from shock before they will sing at all. In captivity some soft-
bills ability to sing will improve from year to year. The exact reason
or this condition I do not know, unless it be due to a more nutritious
and eminently regular diet than that obtained by birds which are at
hbeity and on their own, and perhaps also to an increased feeling of
at-homeness . Anyhow, I have learned that it pays to give a bird
ample time--a year or more--in which to prove his singing ability.
!n certain instances he may need that much time to recover from the
effects of fright induced by having been caught, boxed up, and shipped
to him thoroughly fearful and wholly unnatural experiences.
Whether to keep softbills in cages or in aviaries is assuredly a
ebatable matter. It depends largely, so it would seem to me, on the
specific purpose for which the birds have been acquired and for which
they are meant to be kept. If that purpose is to tame a softbill quickly
and convert him into a pet or to observe his habits at close range over
a period of time, then the cage is by all odds the proper enclosure for
the bird. If, on the other hand, a softbill is to lend avian atmosphere
to a piece of wired-in outdoors, or to breed, then the aviary is the
proper place for him. Planted aviaries are best for most softbills since
they afford them the most natural environment and protection in
captivity. By nature shy, most softbills will hide in bush or shrub
especially when they see strange persons or animals approaching!
UsuaHy, therefore, an aviary is not as effective a means of showing
oil birds as is a cage. Even those birds which ordinarily are so tame as
to take mealworms from their keeper's hand will, when sighting
strangers, go into hiding. Here I recall the enterprising birdman who
ed his spacious, partially planted aviaries with numerous softbills
only to discover that, as a rule, they would stay out of sight, so that
most of the time neither he nor members of his family, nor friends
:ou d see and enjoy his colourful collection. For a time he vowed
1 11 cut out the shrubbery. I want to see my birds. I'll soon fix
-hings . However, he soon found that among members of a large
ollection of softbills, such as he maintained for a time, frequent fights,

often resulting in serious injury to smaller or weaker birds, occur,
unless the birds have close at hand a ready avenue of escape, such as the
leafage of shrubs and trees planted in the aviary. When, more or less
frequently, this same hobbyist found valuable birds dead on the floors
of his aviaries, he became convinced of the birds need for shelter, for
hiding places, which he then supplied promptly. Since most softbills
do not damage living plants, their aviaries may be thickly planted to
suit their needs for protection and also their keeper s needs for attrac-
tive landscaping. Except for the birds, assuredly nothing gives to an
aviary a more pleasing and a more natural setting than various living
plants, deciduous as well as evergreens. They lend it that indispensable
out-of-door atmosphere, which invites favourable attention from its
owner and often favourable comments from his friends and visitors.
In conclusion, my keeping of softbills has afforded me hours upon
hours of quiet relaxation. The work of caring for and feeding my birds
has been--and is--pleasant and not time-consuming. Now, with
between fifty and sixty softbills, largely in aviaries, the preparation of
the various foods as well as the actual feeding requires only an hour
or so --and a very pleasant hour it is, this fairly close association with
my feathered friends which, given reasonably good and regular care,
repay me handsomely in so many ways, not the least of which is their
fine singing. By some persons the hobby of keeping softbills is con-
sidered expensive, but I have not found it so. What if I pay, say, fifty
dollars for a Shama Thrush or a European Nightingale ! Assuming
that I can maintain such a bird in sound health for at least ten y ears,
the initial purchase price thus spread over the bird s life-span in my
aviaries is quite reasonable. The major drawback to this hobby, in my
opinion, is that it tends to keep its followers too much at home, for it
is usually difficult to find a reliable man or woman, or one sufficiently
interested, to care for one's softbills during a prolonged absence.
Moreover, one is usually reluctant to entrust one s precious birds into
the hands of a stranger for fear he or she might neglect them, since such
neglect, whether intended or not, can easily prove fatal with more or
less delicate birds accustomed to being given precise care.
All in all, I believe that softbills make remarkably interesting and
intelligent subjects for a stimulating hobby, owing largely to their
unique character. And they repay their keeper variously and gener-
ously for whatever attention and care he devotes to them day in and
day out the whole year through.

By David M. Johnson (Port Orchard, Washington State, U.S.A.)
Since my report of a year ago we have learned a considerable amount
Dy trial and error m propagating our birds.
rh,Vt C fw that , bl&lt; ?? d * S 3 m * St im P* rtant factor in producing
chicks that are biologically proficient, with the will to hatch well and
with constitutions for good stamina or low mortality. The question
arises from time to time, why cross Grey Jungle Fowl with any fowl
o another species regardless of what breed of that species it may be ?
e answer to that is that Grey Jungles or sonnerati are limited in
number in this country and in need of new imported blood to re-
juvenate them. Sonnerati are not too prolific in the first place, laying from
four to seven eggs per clutch in a brief spring season, their autumn
bloom after eclipse being too late in a northern latitude when the sun
is rapidly leaving us, while hybrid birds and back crosses are so
prolific, producing an abundance of eggs comparable to poultry.
Birds produced from hybrid cocks and sonnerati hens, which we
may refer to here as f Sonnerat's, all have the general appearance of
pure sonnerati including the inherent wildness if not more wild.
We have learned that our best birds from all standpoints are those
o jtained from cock } sonnerati J Bankaiva crossed on Cornish Indian
Game hens. Tnese are the chicks so much in demand this season
which we call " Johnsoni " 2.
They come as much alike as peas in a pod in uniformity of shape
and colouring with all the qualities one would wish to obtain in a bird
lovely to behold.
It is birds of this type we are exporting now to southern States and
overseas^ some 30 odd in number, which will be tried out in re-
abihtation projects, habitats believed suitable to it as birds potentially
lor the coverts. 7
We believe there is much future for it as a wild bird as it retains
ail the wild and sharp-witted instincts of sonnerati and its distaste for
captivity. Its powers and willingness for flight are all one could wish
lor, comparable to pheasant in flight.
We find that Cornish, or any of the true games, are the best medium
lor crossing as it makes a harmonious blend of no offshoots or muta-
tions, no erect tails or surplus combs and wattles indicating the stigma
ol domestic degeneracy of most fowls.
It has been our hope that more aviculturists would experiment on
the establishing of their own birds from original crosses so that we could
exchange birds of different blood lines of no relation to one another

and who could introduce new Sonnerat's Grey Jungle Fowl blood to
their flocks from time to time as the need shows itself.
A strain almost identical to pure sonnerati could be established with
strong constitutions and a potential to abundance ot egg production
and prolific aptitude. Our J cocks inherit the beautiful cape or hackle
with the waxy dots as in sonnerati except the spots are slightly narrower.
Our experience in the rearing of chicks is that they do not thrive
well in confinement and under artificial conditions. They are birds, of
energy, lovers of freedom, work hard for a living and seem to derive
things 5 from the earth essential to their welfare and good health.
Free range or semi-enclosure seems to be essential, and they are more
carnivorous and less granivorous than domestic fowl.
There has been no mortality from illness or disease in spite of our
cold overcast sky and altogether reluctant summer.to date.
Our parent birds are already going into eclipse for the season

Baudin's, or the White-tailed Black Cockatoo, originally described
and figured by Lear in 1832, is a native of forested areas of south-
western Australia.
Gould says of it *. ## Like other members of the genus, it frequents
the large forests of Eucalypti and the belts of Banksiae , upon the seeds
of which it mainly subsists ; occasionally it seeks its food on the
ground, when insects, fallen seeds, etc., are equally partaken of; the
larvae of moths and other insects are extracted by it from the trunks
and limbs of such trees as are infested by them."
Mathews {Birds of Australia, vol. vi) quotes Tom Carter as having
observed that : " This is the common Cockatoo of south-west
Australia and is found as far north as the Murchison River. They
associate in flocks when the breeding season is over ... At times
a flock will settle in an orchard, and do great damage in a very short
time to the buds and young shoots of the trees . . . The breeding
season about Broome Hill seemed to commence in August and continue
until November. Two eggs appear to be the full clutch, and very
frequently one egg is not hatched . . . The fledged young birds are
fed by the parents for many weeks after leaving the nest ; thus^on
10th February, 1914, I noted young birds being fed by adults . . .
The nest is situated in a hollow tree, usually at a considerable
height from the ground. At what age breeding commences is, so far as
I am aware, not known.

In 1938 Adelaide Zoological Gardens acquired a solitary hen
Common Rhea (Rhea rothschildi), and it was not until thirteen years
later that a mate was obtained for her. In the meantime she regularly
produced eggs which, incidentally, proved excellent for culinary
purposes such as omelettes and scrambled egg, these being not too
strong in flavour as might have been expected.
Late in 1951 it was arranged with Taronga Park Zoo, Sydney
t at we should have a male on loan for mating purposes. This bird
arrived by air on 22nd November, 195,, and the two were placed
together soon afterwards.
. The . first . was laid on 5 th December and others at irregular
intervals, eight having been laid by 13th January. In the meantime
three eggs had been broken by the birds and all were then removed
irom the yard as they appeared and held until the male showed signs
of commencing incubation. In anticipation of this a nest had been
thereiii * Ut ** Sr * Und underne ath a tree and an egg placed
e male sat on this for a short time on 13 th January and the other
remaining four eggs were then placed under him. Subsequent to this
the hen laid a further seven eggs, the male ultimately covering a
*ta c,utch of twelve. It followed, therefore, that he had been sittime
a considerable time before the last egg was laid and that the first
cluck would make its appearance long before the last eggs were
expected to hatch. &amp;
Incubation period is about forty days and the first chick appeared
on schedule on 21st February. There was something abnormal
about the arrival of this little stranger, as it was found early in the
day at a considerable distance from the nest, together with the remains
ot the egg from which it emerged. This chick was placed in a box
and kept in warm sunlight until later in the day when an attempt was
made to place it under the brooding male. However, he gave it
several vicious pecks and it was therefore placed in a warm brooder
o\ ermght. Next morning a second chick was found in circumstances

similar to the arrival of the first, and the two were placed in the
brooder out in the sunlight which was nice and mild at the time.
At this stage they were too young to be in need of food, but both
showed an interest in shell-grit and swallowed a few pieces. Instinct
was already prompting them to take in this necessary adjunct to
assist in digestion of food.
Late in the second day three more chicks had hatched and the
male was by then looking upon them with a more kindly eye , the
opportunity was therefore taken to return to him the first two arrivals.
The score was now five. On the third day a sixth chick hatched and
the proud father came off the nest the following day, leaving six
unhatched eggs. This eventuality had been foreseen, owing to seven
eggs being laid some days after incubation had commenced, and an
incubator had been warmed up in advance in readiness to carry on
with the job. Two of the eggs were obviously no good, but the other
four were placed in the incubator although hopes were not high of
getting more chicks. However, much to our delight, about a week
later three more new arrivals appeared at odd intervals. These were
kept in the brooder for several days till they gained strength, then
being transferred to father's care. He accepted them readily enough
but there was a very noticeable disparity in their size compared with
their elder brethren, this difference persisting for several months
when it became more difficult to differentiate between them.
At no stage after the eggs were laid did the hen evince any interest
in the proceedings and, after the arrival of the chicks, it was deemed
advisable to remove her from the yard as her attentions were inclined
to be hostile rather than maternal. Early every evening and when the
weather was cool, father would sit down and fluff out his wings
and the chicks would snuggle underneath just as domestic poultry
chicks do. He proved a good parent and not one chick was lost.
When about four months old, five chicks were sent by air to Taronga
Park Zoo, one in exchange for " father 55 who was retained and
four as Taronga's share of the " dividend " resulting from the satis-
factory arrangement entered into earlier.

E. N. T. VANE--BREEDING THE CANARY-W;
INGED PARRAKEET 22 7
It might be thought that undue importance was attached to the
breeding of this species which has since proved very easy to rear
It is pointed out, however, that Australian Zoological Gardens are
subject to very restrictive quarantine regulations, and several years
prior to the first breeding referred to, a complete ban was placed
on the importation of all birds from anywhere in the world except
New Zealand, where quarantine regulations are equally restrictive.
The reader wi 1 readily understand, therefore, the importance that
Australiani Zoological Gardens place on the breeding of foreign birds
which, unfortunately, can no longer be imported. Unless we can breed
rom the stock of exotic birds in our possession the species gradually
becomes extinct m our Zoological Gardens as individuals die out
W e hopefully look forward to the day when perhaps the severe
restrictions might be somewhat ameliorated, but in the meantime
must do the best we can in the circumstances. We envy Zoological
Gardens in other parts of the world which operate under much more
liberal quarantine regulations and which, with certain reservations
can make a choice from the birds of the world.

By E. N. T. Vane (Ballinger, Bucks, England)
Records of the breeding of Brotogeris parrakeets are few, probably
because they are such delightfully finger-tame pets that the oppor-
tunity to reproduce is seldom given them. Peters lists three sub-
species of versicolurus , regarding the Canary-wing as only subspecifically
different from the Whitewing, yet the All-green he considers as a
different species. When the Parrot ban was raised recently a number of
anary-wings came over and among the consignments it was not
unusual to find an occasional odd specimen of either of the above-
mentioned birds.
Some specimens appear to be considerably larger than others, but as
all the birds in each consignment are generally of the same size, this
feature is possibly only due to a local race variation. The distribution
is rather wide, ranging from Eastern Bolivia to Argentine, Eastern
Brazil, and Paraguay.
In setting out to breed them, the first obstacle is to sex them correctly.
Ihere is no external sexual distinction ; South American parrakeets
ire very difficult to sex by the pelvic bone test, as these are much more
&amp;apos;lose set and elongated than African or Australian birds, but when in
breeding condition there is a noticeable variation in the opening in the
exes. This definitely disappears when breeding is over and it was quite
mpossible to tell my breeding pair when they were eventually brought

in, although I knew perfectly well which was which as the male had a
slightly upturned toenail on one foot. They had been in my possession
over a year before all doubts on this point were removed. According
to some old writers the hen has a less deeply notched and narrower
bill and her head is rounder and smaller than the cock's. If anything,
my hen is larger than her mate, but they are practically indistinguish-
able. Her bill is less notched on one side than the other, in other
words it is impossible to sex them by sight.
For the first year they were kept in a cage indoors as they were
pinioned and unable to fly at all. They were absolutely fearless of
human beings and appeared fully conscious of their superiority. They
chattered incessantly and made a great noise when certain programmes
were on the radio or one attempted to speak on the telephone. When
they were fed they always came down to wait for the fresh food and
used to bite my fingers impatiently ; it would have been perfectly
easy to tame them to sit on one's finger, but I always hoped to breed
them so did not encourage them to become over-familiar.
During the winter of 1953-4 they moulted out and grew their flight
feathers, the cock being the first to do so. It now became possible to
distinguish their sex as the cock sometimes fed the hen and it was then
noted that he had one upturned toenail. At the end of April they were
moved to a small aviary facing south, 6 feet long, 6 feet high, and
3 feet wide, with half of the roof covered in and the whole of the back
protected on the north with asbestos sheet. There was no completely
enclosed shelter, but 2 feet from the rear a sheet of windowlite afforded
protection from wind and rain, and behind this screen their food was
supplied through a service door. A large, solid nest-box about 18
inches deep and 9 inches square, with 3 inches of peat mould in the
bottom, was fixed to the rear of the flight. To start with they did
not use the box for roosting, but were sensible enough to get right
at the rear high up under cover, which was just as well as mid-winter
returned early in May and they had to be brought in once more.
When roosting they like to hang upside down on the wires both in
cage and aviary. A second attempt was started on the 8th May,
and by the 21st they began to roost in the box, and a week later the
cock was feeding the hen regularly.
Their demeanour in the flight did not change, they were still
perfectly fearless and friendly though when they came nibbling at my
fingers the cock began to scold rather badly and sometimes bit rather
hard. It was plain that with the approach of breeding operations he
was going to be somewhat vicious and it would be unwise to associate
more than one pair in a flight at this time. They made much less
noise in the aviary, only chattering when they saw anyone coming
round to see them. They ignored some lovebirds in an adjoining
flight unless they hung on the wire, but as this was double and spaced

one inch apart no harm could result, though without this precaution
I fear there would have been many toes missing by the end of the
season.
On the 1 oth June they were seen mating. This was accomplished
standing side by side on the perch gripping their left and right feet
together as if they were "hand-in-hand". The box being hung
outside the flight I was able to inspect it without their having any
idea that I was doing so. As soon as their food was supplied in the
morning they were so busy examining it and scolding me through the
service door that I could safely look in. The box was perfectly clean
a certain amount of whittling had been done and a hollow made in
the peat mould in one corner. No materials were taken in
The first egg was laid on nth June. There were two on the 13 th
and the hen began to spend more time in the box. On the 20th
she was off feeding and there were five eggs a little larger than a
. U S eia S&amp;apos; ar f and more elongated. She had been almost continually
in the box since the 13th, and I assumed she had been sitting from the
second egg and they would probably hatch about 1st July though
the eggs appeared so light in colour that I hardly expected them to be
fertile.
This fear mounted when I was next able to inspect the nest on
1st July. Still five eggs and not very fertile-looking. The box was right
tTT t U &amp;apos; ,cerl &amp;apos; n S tra P and the hen sat close every morning until
I had moved two or three flights away, when she immediately came
oil and started feeding ravenously. I did not wish to disturb her
unnecessarily so did not go back and interfere.
On the nth July I looked once more and was very disappointed
to find still five eggs which did not look particularly "heavy".
I decided in desperation to give them three more days. On the 14th
when I went to remove them two looked as though they had some-
thing inside, so I left them and was most thankful the next morning
I had done so as three eggs had hatched on the 1 5 th within the twenty-
four hours. On the 16th all five had hatched. The period of incuba-
tion is, therefore, a lengthy one of about twenty-six days at least.
e young were entirely naked, just like Budgerigars, which might
therefore, be used as fosters if the long incubation period is allowed
for by moving the eggs. They were slow in developing, being com-
pletely naked until ten days old. On the 30th (fifteen days) the
leather tracts could be seen forming, there was no down, their eyes were

23O E. N. T. VANE-BREEDING THE CANARY-WINGED PARRAKEET
the eggs had hatched, but they were never interfered with beyond
the unsuspected inspections from the back, all that one could see was a
tangled bunch of young birds and possibly the last to hatch did not
get its fair share and was lost.
The hen did all the incubating, the cock joining her at night in the
box when he may have assisted in these duties, but she only came off at
short regular intervals to feed and exercise. Both birds remained
perfectly fearless and literally finger tame, yet aggressive and a little
vicious, especially the cock, who was a model parent, spending the
whole day preparing the family meals ; he scarcely left the food bowl
which was filled twice daily. Enormous amounts of greenfood were
consumed.
The first young one to leave the nest made the effort on 3rd Septem-
ber, just eight weeks from the date of hatching. It was exactly like
its parents but a little smaller and the bill was obviously immature.
It stayed out all day, but as it was cold in the evening he was put back
into the nest at nightfall. Two came out on the 5th and again were
replaced at night. On the 6th all four fledged and made a very pleasant
sight on the perch together in a row with mother and father on the
outsides. One was rather less steady on the wing than the others. On
8th September they all stayed out as I neglected them by attending
the B.A.C. dinner, but the night was fine and they appeared none the
worse.
On the 9th it rained and rained, just like an English summer, and
I was very sad to find the youngest one lying on its back with its feet
in the air in a pool of water an inch deep. I picked him up and was
about to throw his body away when I discovered he still had a spark of
life left. I brought him in and held him in front of an electric fire
fully convinced that I was wasting my time, but in an astonishingly
short time he recovered and within two hours he was sitting on my
finger quite dry and preening himself. To cut a long story short,
he was hand-reared and was feeding himself in ten days. He was
given soaked bread rusks with a little oatmeal and peanut butter and
Virol. He also had a little apple, a daily dose of abidec, and in a
few weeks he had caught up his brothers, with whom he is now reunited
although he is much steadier than they.
The other young stayed out in the aviary until the end of October.
They did not go back into the nest to roost, but sat side by side on a
perch, the parents hanging from the wire overhead. On one occasion
the temperature dropped to 25 degrees before they were brought in.
Their food is mainly canary (mazagan), with a quarter part of
white millet, one-eighth part sunflower, a few oats, and a small ration
of hemp whilst being reared. They are very fond of fruit and had a
slice of apple or pear daily each, occasionally a piece of banana as
I understand that most South American Indians feed them on this

day they had moistened brown bread rusks and sprouted canary
seed. They consume a large quantity of greenfood, starting in the

Given a true pair and the right accommodation, which is very
modest, I believe there is every hope that these delightful little birds
would establish themselves in our aviaries, but I do think that each
breeding pair requires separate quarters.

DARENTH-HULME, 1954
By Kay Bonner (Southgate, England)
The past breeding season has been very poor, in fact it is really
remarkable how few young ones have been reared. It is fortunate
therefore that, in spite of the atrocious weather, even including the
near arctic conditions early in the year, the mortality has, for a
comparatively large collection, been extraordinarily low.
It will perhaps be easiest to list the various aviaries and their inmates.
The main range has housed the following :--
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.915119523809524">
1. Stanley Parrakeets, a well-tried breeding pair produced only one
good young one. Diamond Doves.
2. Queen Alexandra's Parrakeets laid, but did not hatch.
3. Stanley Parrakeets, and two cock Yellow-naped Whydahs.
4. Cockatiels produced one very undersized young one that died
soon after leaving the nest. Fischer's Lovebirds, a small
colony that just holds its own. One young one was hatched
and reared by a pair of Budgerigars. A cock Peach-faced
Lovebird.
5. Lineolated Parrakeets, the breeding colony has increased but to
what extent is not known exactly.
6. Pennant's Parrakeets, the pair that reared four good ones last
year, reared only two this season.
7. Abyssinian Lovebirds, the three pairs again failed to reproduce.
8. Golden-winged Parrakeets, the two pairs made no attempt to
nest, not even inspecting nest-boxes.
9. Moustache Parrakeets, most dreadfully noisy and definitely not
recommended to any aviculturist likely to suffer from neighbour
trouble.
10. Cactus Gonures and a single Weddell's Conure. Painted Quail.
11. Two pairs of Yellow-cheeked Conures, both nested unsuccessfully :

another pair died during the arctic weather, feet badly frost-
bitten.
12. Two pairs of Canary-winged Parrakeets occupied this aviary
early in the season. This species has the reputation of being
very quarrelsome, and this was confirmed by the fact that one
of the quartet was severely maltreated and rescued only just
in time to save its life.

13. Golden-mantled Rosellas reared one only.

By Alan Lendon (Adelaide, S. Australia)
This article records the results achieved in my collection from the
time of publication of my articles in the Avicultural Magazine
(Vols. 55 and 56, 1949-50), until my cessation of avicultural activities
after the 1952 breeding season.
Barraband's Parrakeet (Polytelis swainsonii ).--The three young in the
nest at the time of writing (November, 1948) were successfully reared,
leaving the nest early in December. The same pair of birds reared five
young in November, 1949, and the same number again in November,
1950. In 1951 the old cock died just as the clutch was hatching, but
the hen successfully reared all four young single-handed, and they were
perfect specimens when they left the nest in November.
For the 1952 season the same hen, one of my own breeding in 19465
was mated to a young wild-caught cock. He proved to be possessed
of the nature of a Crimson-wing, and drove her mercilessly long before
she was ready to nest, but she eventually hatched four young and
reared three.
Rock Pebbler Parrakeet (P. anthopeplus )The hen that successfully
reared six young in 1948, died in September, 194D5 and her mate died
in September, 1950, just after a newly obtained hen had started

she laid two eggs, but did not incubate.

Queen Alexandra's Parrakeet (P. alexandrae).- Three of the four
young previously referred to were satisfactorily reared in January
1949. In the 1949 season four young were reared in November from

was hatched and reared. In t 95 o four young were reared from the
rst nest, but a second clutch was deserted. In 1951 three were
hatched, and two reared from the first clutch, and two hatched
and reared from a very large second clutch.
The old hen failed to moult satisfactorily before the 1952 season
and her first clutch of five were all infertile ; she died after laying
fout more eggs. A second pair kept that year laid a clutch of six late

King Parrakeet (Aprosmictus scapdaris) .--In 1940 the old pair did
absolutely nothing, although the hen had raised my hopes by laying

the hen, but she got no further than visiting the log occasionally.

regularly for Mr. H. Bradley, but the hen did nothing beyond lay
wo eggs on the ground in mid-November. In 1952, although I
obtained their original massive log, they did not even lay, and a
second pair did likewise.
in Parrakeet ( A - ei ythropterus) .--A new pair obtained
' I94 t 9 dld nothing and began their moult in the first week of Decem-
ber. In 1950 this pair came into breeding condition in mid-September
The first egg of a clutch of three was laid in mid-October; all were

two d&amp;gt;ed quite early, the survivor was reared and left the nest in the
middle oi December.

Pileated Parrakeet (Purpureicephalus spurius ).--In 1949, a clutch of
seven was commenced on the last day of September, six were fertile,
five were hatched, and four reared, leaving the nest in early December.
In 1950, for some unexplained reason, no eggs were laid, but in
1951, although the first egg was laid from the perch in mid-October,
six more were suitably placed and all were fertile and had hatched by
mid-November. Of these five survived to leave the nest about
Christmas time, but the smallest only lived a few days.
In 1952 the clutch of six was not commenced until the end of
October, four out of six were hatched, and three left the nest late in
December.
Crimson Rosella (Platycercus elegans ).--This species was not repre-
sented in my collection in either 1949 or 1950, and a pair obtained
before the 1951 season did nothing, as did another pair in 1952*
Adelaide Rosella (P. adelaida)-- The pair that I had had for several
years laid a clutch of six in the middle of September, 1949 ; four of
these were fertile, but they were deserted when about due to hatch,
and disappeared a couple of days later. A second clutch of four was
laid early in November, and three dead young were found late that
month. In 1950 the same pair had four eggs by the end of Sep-
tember, but had broken them a few days later, and several more eggs
were subsequently laid and broken.
For the 1951 season I obtained a new hen, and she completed a
clutch of six eggs, all of which were fertile, by 25th October. Three
newly hatched young were observed on 17th November, and four
days later there were three young living and one was dead ; the two
remaining eggs were given to a sitting pair of Western Rosellas, who
hatched them, but allowed them to die. The three young Adelaides
flourished and the first, a cock, left the nest on 20th December, and
the other two, a pair, two days later. This constituted my first
success with this species.
In 1952 the hen started to lay early in September, but the eggs
were broken almost as soon as they appeared. I thereupon removed
the log for a few weeks, and on replacing it, the next egg was laid
about the middle of October, and promptly broken ; five more
followed and were incubated, but only one was fertile, so two Golden-
mantled eggs were substituted for the clear ones. The young Adelaide
hatched first and the two Golden-mantleds about a week later ; the
Adelaide died nearly a month after hatching, and the smaller Golden-
mantled a week later, the other left the nest prematurely next day, and
was obviously being neglected, so was given to a pair of Pale-headed
Rosellas who were successful in rearing it.

the previous season commenced a clutch of six eggs in the middle of
October, 1949. These were all fertile and young were seen early in

November, and lour were later counted ; these were all reared and
lelt the nest between nth and 22nd of December.
In 1950 a clutch of six was started early in October, five were
fertile, and young were seen by the end of the month ; all of these
were reared, and left the nest early in December.
In 1951 the clutch of five was started a little later in October, and
a were hatched ; four were reared in early December, but one must
have injured a wing, as it was never able to fly. The following year
six fertile eggs were produced towards the end of October ; five were
hatched and left the nest from mid-December onwards
Green Rosella (P. caledonicus) .-No results were obtained in either
1949 01 1950, but in 1951 the hen of the previous season was given a
new mate and she laid the first egg of a clutch of six on 3rd November.
All proved fertile, and the first had hatched by 1st December, and
four could be counted two days later. One of these died quite earlv
and two left the nest prematurely on 27th December, an extremely hot
nnf'l t Cre repIace , d &amp;apos; The first Y oun g bird did not leave finally
until 8th January, and the other two followed two days later. All
were successfully reared ; they were a cock and two hens, and this
was my initial success with this infrequently bred species
In 1952 the same pair laid a clutch of seven fertile eggs at exactly
e same ime o the year, all hatched and five survived, leaving the
nest in mid-January. s
Pale-headed Rosella (P. adscitus).-- The pair which had reared two
young the previous year, started the 1949 season with an infertile
clutch and only reared one out of three hatched in the second nest.
I he following year the same hen, with a new mate, did not even lay
in ,951 I acquired a new pair which had been regular breeders for
Th 7 lald their first Clutch of six late in August,
hatched the lot, and reared five of them. The second round of five
was laid in the middle of November, and were all reared by early
January Carrying on in 1952, the same pair reared four out of five
hatched from their August clutch, and only one out of the two hatched
from the November clutch, in addition to the Golden-mantled
previously mentioned.
Northern Rosella (P. venuslus).-- In 1949 the pair that had been
mated up the year before started with an infertile clutch in July, and
followed with four more eggs in September, all of which were hatched
and reared. This was the precursor of three remarkably successful
seasons, for in 1950 they reared five young from the first clutch
aid early m July, and five more from the end-of-September clutch
1951 saw a very similar result, four being obtained from a clutch
laid late in June and four more from a mid-September laying. For
1952 the results were three from the early clutch and a further four

from the later one ; thus the total works out at twenty-nine hatched
and all reared from seven clutches in four seasons.
Eastern Rosella (P. eximius ).--In 1949 the hen that had been
successful in the previous year was mated to one of her sons. She
laid a clutch of five eggs towards the end of October and incubated
steadily, but all proved infertile. In August of the following year the
son, having fallen in love with a Golden-mantled hen in a near-by
aviary, proceeded to commit matricide, since when the common race
has not been kept. , ,
Golden-mantled Rosella (P. splendidus) .--The cock which had bred
in 1948 was mated to one of his daughters the following season, and
although she laid three eggs in November, she did not incubate. In
1950 she was given an unrelated mate, and she started to lay early in
October. Although most of the early eggs were broken, I removed
eleven from the nest early in November ! Undeterred, she recom-
menced laying late in the month, and when I removed seven eggs
at the end of December I was amazed to find one contained a chick
on the point of hatching !
In 1951 the same pair had a clutch of six, laid late in September, pi
which three were hatched and reared. In 1952 bad habits were again
in evidence, for many of the early eggs were broken, ten were removed
in November, and two of these were hatched by Adelaides and one
eventually reared with the help of the Pale-headeds.
Western Rosella (P. icterotis ).--No results were obtained either in
1949 or 1950 from the pair which had laid and hatched young in
1948. A new hen was obtained for 1951, and although she laid a
clutch of five early in November, all the eggs were broken. She was
given a new mate for 1952 and laid a clutch of six in mid-October ;
three were fertile, but only one was hatched, and it promptly died.
Three more infertile eggs were laid in November, and another two
in December, which were not incubated. A second pair of immature
birds laid five eggs early in November of that year, but did not incubate.
Red-rumped Parrakeet (Psephotus fuematonotus ). This species was
not kept in either 1949 or 1950. A pair obtained in 1951 had an
infertile clutch of six early, then started non-stop laying early in
October, and had a clutch of four in December, three of which were
found to be fertile when deserted. In 1952 a different pair did nothing.
Many-coloured Parrakeet ( Ps . vanus ).--Not kept in 1949 or in 1950.
In 1951 a wild-caught hen mated to an aviary-bred cock did nothing,
and a different pair obtained in 1952 were no improvement.
Red-vented Blue Bonnet Parrakeet (Ps. hamatorrhous) .--The old
male did nothing with either of the mates provided in 1949 and 1950.
A pair of young birds bred in my collection during the war were
bought back, but they did nothing in either 1950 or in 1951, and both
died in May, 1952.

\ ellow-vented Blue Bonnet Parrakeet (Ps. xanthorrhous ).--The old
breeding cock was given a tame hand-reared hen as a mate in 1040
and she laid a clutch of six towards the end of August. Five were
&quot; &amp;apos;'J 1 ' and tllree were hatched and reared, leaving the nest at the end
ot October. In 1950 the same pair hatched three and reared two at
the same time of the year, and in 1951 four were hatched and reared
again at exactly the same time. In 1952 the old cock failed to induce
a new mate to lay, even though she spent some time in the lo&lt;* in
.November. &amp;
Little Blue Bonnet Parrakeet (Ps. narethe) .--The old breeding hen
with a new mate, had five clear eggs early in September, 1949. In
1950 the same pair had six eggs late in September ; only one was
fertile, but it was hatched and reared. In 1951 three were fertile out
oi lour laid early in September, and two hatched and were reared
In 1952 a new hen was obtained, but she did not lay, although the
cock seemed more vigorous than in previous seasons.
Hooded Parrakeet (Psephotellus dissimilis ).--No results were obtained
although three different pairs were tried during the four years.
Bourke Grass Parrakeet (Neophema bourki ).--In 1950 the first pair
was the old cock with a new mate. They hatched and reared four in
the first clutch, but only reared three out of five hatched in the second
try. A second pair reared only three out of six hatched in their first
attempt, then laid eleven eggs without incubating, and finally only
reared two of six hatched at the third try. In 1951 the first pair
only brought off two out of five hatched the first time, but reared
all lour that hatched in the second attempt. The second pair laid
ten eggs, of which I left them seven, all of which they hatched and
five of which they reared. The hen then laid a further ten eggs, of
which I left her six, all of which hatched, but only three survived
In 1952 the results were not as good. The first pair started by
hatching five and letting them all die, and followed with two hatched
and reared. The other pair also let die all five that they hatched in
the first nest, but reared four from eight hatched at the second attempt.
Blue-winged Grass Parrakeet (jV*. chrysostoma ).--In 1950 the hen of
the P ai j that had hatched young in the previous season broke a wing
and did not lay. The other hen ran true to form, and again laid a
number of eggs without incubating. In 1951 the profuse egg-layer
was mated to the by then bereaved husband of the broken-winged
hen ; her first clutch of seven were laid in October, which is unusually
early for this species, but all proved clear. Five out of a second lot
ol seven were fertile, only three hatched, and all died quite soon.
I he other cock of the previous year was given a new mate, and she had
lour hatched from five fertile eggs, but only succeeded in rearing two
ol them in mid-January. In 1952 this pair hatched all of four fertile
eggs laid early in November, and had reared three by mid-December.

Elegant Grass Parrakeet (JV. elegans).-- The old breeding pair raised
three out of three and one out of four hatched in 195*- -^ n * 95 *
first clutch was clear, only one was fertile in the second, and it was
reared, and four Bourke eggs were substituted for an infertile third
clutch, and two of four hatched were reared. For 1952 a new cock
was obtained, and though the first clutch was again clear, two were
reared from three hatched in a second try.
Rock Grass Parrakeet (JV. petrophila )In 1950 the old hen had a
new mate, and she laid three eggs in October, hatched two of them,
but allowed them to die when a fortnight old. The same pair had
two clear eggs in 1951, and a new pair in 1952 did not lay, although
the hen was in the log a great deal.
Orange-bellied Grass Parrakeet (JV. chrysogastra )In 1950 the hen
became interested in the log early in December, and laid her first egg on
the 30th of that month. The clutch consisted of four, which she incu-
bated steadily, but unfortunately all were clear. Early in 1951 Sir
Edward Hallstrom was kind enough to let me have a new cock to
replace the old one, known to have been in captivity since 1938 ! This
year the hen was seen in the nest, and feeding was observed late in
December. On 4th January the cock was dead, and three days later the
hen laid an egg ! However, she did not incubate, but produced another
egg early in February. Early in 1952 ^ was 1 UC ^Y enough to obtain yet
another cock, the best specimen that I have ever possessed, but
unfortunately the hen died in September. The only pair that I know
of in captivity nowadays is at the Adelaide Zoo, and though the hen
lays and incubates most years the eggs have always been clear.
Turquoise Grass Parrakeet (JV. pulchella ).--In 1950 one pair did not
lay ; the other pair did not sit on the first clutch, and reared the
only one hatched in the second. The following year this latter pair
again did not sit on the first clutch, the second were all clear, and the
third again were not incubated. A new hen provided for the cock
of the other pair had an infertile first clutch, and reared only one of
the three hatched in the second. In 1952 a single pair laid eleven
eggs late in the season, but did not sit.
Scarlet-chested Grass Parrakeet (JV. splendida) .--Recent results with
this usually easy species were appalling. In 1950 a very fine cock
had two eggs laid by his first mate, and they promptly vanished ; he
was then given another hen who hatched three and four in successive
clutches, but reared none of them. Another cock had an early clutch
of seven from this hen, and when mated with the other did no more.
In 1951 both hens broke their eggs, and one ultimately died egg-
bound, and in 1952 one pair did not lay while the hen of a second
pair also died egg-bound, and a new hen then hatched two young
and they promptly died.

By J. Yealland
A very attractive little collection of birds, a present from Sq./Ldr.
K. C. Searle, was brought back from Singapore by Head Keeper
Akhurst of the Aquarium.
It consisted of a Blue-rumped Parrot ( Psittinus cyanurus), a Long-
tailed Parrakeet (Psiltacula longicauda), the most beautiful of the
genus ; six Blue-crowned Hanging Parrakeets (Loriculus galgulus)
and two Malayan Yellow-breasted Sunbirds ( Leptocoma jugularis
microleuca) , new to the collection.
Other presentations include a Gannet (Sula bassana ), a Yellow-
casque Hornbill (Ceratogymna elata ), and two Red-eared Bulbuls
(Otocompsa emeria).
Two Abyssinian Ground Hornbills ( Bucorvus abyssinicus) , two of the
handsome Goliath Herons (Ardea goliath ), and two Black Pies or
Piapiacs ( Ptilostomus afer) have been purchased. It used to be thought
that red-billed specimens of this Pie were females, but it is now known
.at only immature birds have red bills. On arrival from the Gambia
it was found that one of the Ground Hornbills had some of the common
African ticks, Rhipicephalus sanguineus , on its head.
Twelve young Budgerigars of the Woburn homing strain have been
sent from Whipsnade and a few young ones have left the nests in the
new aviary. Two more Crested Pigeons have been bred ; also a
Bronze-wing, five Quaker Parrakeets, three Masked Lovebirds (blue-
bred green), a Rosy-faced Lovebird, two Lesser Black-backed Gulls
a Herring Gull, and two Night Herons.

Bananas as a Food for Birds
In the tropics the banana is the chief food given to many caged fruit-eaters. Some
o t le smaller sorts thrive solely on banana. There are many very fine and also many
interior varieties of this fruit. The latter are very indigestible even when fully ripened.
ne finer sorts do not last long enough to reach our shores, as the period of edibility
lasts tor but a day or two. It is these sorts on which tropical birds thrive best. Even
the larger parrots will not thrive on inferior kinds yet I have known of a Macaw
to thrive on sound banana as its chief food

The banana of commerce is of a more lasting nature than some of the fancy kinds,
keeping as it does for several days in an edible state. Nevertheless not until it is
thoroughly ripe is it safe for many birds. Under-ripe it causes colic, frequently
followed by deaths. Over-ripe it causes looseness, being then of no value.
Greenish-yellow bananas, whether with or without dark patches on the skin
are unwholesome food for the smaller birds, and for that matter the larger parrots.
A good test is that the skin peels off easily, neither breaking nor leaving any of it
adhering to the fruit. Should any skin adhere to the fruit it should not be fed, as it
is still undigestible in such a state. A thoroughly ripened banana has a golden yellow
skin covered sparsely with light brown spots.

THE USE OF NECTAR IN FEEDING BIRDS
</equation>
<bodyText confidence="0.989753333333333" page_id="58091359"  page_num="Page 244" year="" vol="">
I was very intrigued by the article and illustration of the Golden-fronted Wood-
pecker partaking of nectar food by J. Carpentier of the Antwerp Zoo.
Whilst I have not had experience of this particular species, the fact that it is
a fruit-eating bird explains why it has taken the nectar, mainly, I think, because the
sweetness compares with fruit juices. Old-standing members of the Avicultural
Society and foreign bird enthusiasts will know me in the trade as specializing, over
the last thirty-five years or so in Tanagers, Manakins, Fruitsuckers, and all the
nectar-eating species, and will know that I have always advised feeding fruit-eating
birds with sponge-cake or brown bread moistened with nectar, in addition to fruit.
I have always fed so and I am certain that it must have saved me many thousands of
pounds in preventing losses in fresh consignments.
Tanagers and Sugar Birds are generally packed with banana, which I consider
a bad food. I find that fresh arrivals after taking the sponge-cake or bread, which
they do straight away, will seldom touch banana again and my sole method for these
birds is to give only orange in the way of fruit and for the Sugar Birds ajar of nectar.
I have never tried Tanagers with nectar itself, but no doubt they would drink it ;
I like the cake and bread for roughage. I have, however, on occasions given pots of
nectar to the larger birds arriving in very poor condition. I recently received some
Greater Himalayan Barbets in very poor condition and in addition to the food
mentioned above I gave a 2 oz. jar of nectar to each bird. They consumed two jars
each day, and in a week, unless seen, one would never believe the difference in the
condition. At the moment I have a female Cock-of-the-Rock which drinks about 2 oz.
each day and a Red-crested Manakin which takes a similar amount.
I give nectar to all my stock, for finches and softbills I add it to the drinking
water ; my food, however, differs from that used by Mr. Carpentier. Many years
ago I cut out honey, condensed milk, and prepared invalid foods as they all turn sour
overnight ; I use only Dextrine-Maltose ingredients which even in hot weather will
not turn sour in 24 hours. My birds, from Humming Birds to Cock-of-the-Rock,
do excellently on it. I trust these few notes will be of interest to our members.

I11 his article (Sept.-Oct., 1954, issue) on " Woodpeckers in Captivity", Mr. J.
Carpentier seeks information on the use of nectar for birds other than those for which
this preparation is normally provided.
This is a very intriguing subject, because when feeding Sugar Birds on this diet
I always have on hand each day a surplus which is placed before my Superb Tanager,
Golden-fronted Fruitsucker, and Black-headed Sibia. As these three birds proved
extremely partial to this liquid food I gave a little to my Scarlet Tanager who likewise
displayed a marked liking for it.

As a result of these experiments, which I carried out some time ago and from which
the above-mentioned birds derived much benefit, I decided to put about half a
teacupful in the mam aviary to discover whether any other birds in my very mixed
collection would be attracted by it. Imagine my surprise and delight when I found
that not only did my Blue-throated Barbet and Indian Mynah regard it as a special
treat but that they had to reckon with competition from Bulbuls, Pekin Robins
Ground Thrushes, Dyal Birds, and many kinds of seed-eating Finches. My pair of
tiny Grey Singers, for example, drank it eagerly as did also Orange-cheeked Waxbills
Zebra finches, and Tri-coloured Mannikins.
I have little doubt that, especially as a final evening feed in cold weather, nectar
is a valuable supplementary diet for many birds for which it has, perhaps, been
considered unsuitable. It is, I am sure, a very nourishing medium for any bird that
can be induced to take it.
There are, we all know, many varieties of nectar preparations based on the general
pi maple of honey, Swiss milk, and baby food. In respect of choice of components
I have found that much depends upon the individual bird. One Blue Honey Creeper
I have will not touch his mixture if a meat extract has been added. Nor have
I found it desirable, except about once a week, to make use of any of the infant
foods. I have a notion that too frequent use of them tends to produce fatness, particu-
larly when birds (as not infrequently happens) are confined in cages where exercise
is necessarily somewhat limited.
The whole question of bird nutrition, it seems to me, is one that should be studied
\eiy caiefully, not merely in relation to species, but specifically (and this is of cardinal

Woodpecker living in the Antwerp Zoo.
I lecently bought a Cuban Black-browed Woodpecker (Melanerpes superciliaris)
and 1 find that it, too, is fond of the liquid Sunbird food. It also eats grapes, apple,
and occasionally a little minced raw beef, but will not touch insectile mixture or
mealworms, though these are offered daily. So far the bird is thriving ; it is very
active and calls a good deal, but it never pecks at the tree trunk in its aviary. Unlike
the Antwerp bird, my Woodpecker is very aggressive towards other birds and an
unfortunate White-eye that got into the aviary was quickly killed.
I have not been able to discover anything about the natural food of the Black-
browed Woodpecker, but Gosse, writing about the Radiolated Woodpecker of
Jamaica, says that it eats various fruits as well as wood-boring larvae and ants. It
also damages the stalks of sugar cane and sucks out the juice, so I wonder whether
any of the Cuban birds have similar tastes.

high. Eggs laid, as far as knowledge serves, numbered three. First indication of
any chicks w r as when about tw&amp;apos;o-three weeks old ; this was on Saturday, 20th
February, 1954, when both my good friend Mr. Rough and myself inspected them
at the request of the owner. They were then very well developed but still covered
with grey dowm and showing hardly any feather.

These three chicks left the nest about four weeks ago (18th May, 1954). In all
appearances they are very healthy birds and the characteristics of both parents
can be seen. So far it is difficult to do any sexing as they are so very much alike but
there appears to be two and one. The one carrying more yellow colouring about the
head. However, all show yellow feathering amongst the head which, like the Black-
headed Conure, is all black. Wings similar to the same--black beaks and black feet,
all show yellowing on breast and abdomen.
The three chicks were acquired by me on 15th May, 1954, and the parents by
Mr. Rough. The three chicks are now fully feathered and independent of their
parents.

Whilst judging at a bird show at Southall in October of this year I was surprised to
find among the exhibits two Oxpeckers or Tick Birds (Buphagus africanus africanus).
If my memory is correct this is the first occasion that they have been exhibited alive
here* and I do not recollect having ever seen them represented at the London Zoological
Gardens. They were quiet when examined and in good health and plumage. Sitting
partly upright on their perch they peered at one curiously. Their strong feet which
enables them to clamber about the hides of herbivorous animals seemed fitted more
for this purpose than, perching, although they perch on trees and on native cattle-
sheds. They were entered as " Blood Birds ", not altogether an unsuitable name.
Ornithologists at one time differed as to what they actually ate. It seems, however,
that not only are ticks eaten in quantity but stomach oxaminations include diptera,
lice blood, tissue, and hair. Animals in bad condition with open saddle and gall
wounds have such afflicted parts kept open by the birds pecking at flesh and sipping
the blood. Much information on the habits of these curious birds has been contributed
by Mr. Moreau and Major Cheeseman and others and requoted.

On behalf of the Committee of the Duke of Bedford Memorial Fund, I write to
say how gratifying the response, particularly from members of the Avicultural Society,
has been.
Photographs of the aviary, the plaque, and the Memorial Trophy will be pub-
lished in the Avicultural Magazine in due course, together with a final statement
of the total amount of the Fund.
It is hoped that the present Duke will perform the ceremony of unveiling the
plaque early next spring, and when the date is announced, donors wishing to attend
the ceremony will be invited to communicate with me.

EAST AFRICAN BROWN-HEADED PARROT

A. A. Prestwich (Southgate, England)
The East African Brown-headed Parrot was first described and
named Pionus fuscicapillus by Verreaux and Des Murs in 1849. And
fuscicapillus it remained until 1924 when Dr. Hartert called attention
to the fact that " the African Parrot now called Poicephalus fuscicapillus
(Pionus fuscicapillus Verr. et Des Murs, 1849) cannot be called by this
name, because of Pionus fuscicapillus Wagler, 1832, which is a new
name for Psittacus spadiocephalus Kuhl, 1820, and refers apparently to
a female of a Geoffroyus, but it is not possible to say which form
The next available name for the species, Poicephalus cryptoxatithus
Peters, 1854, was duly adopted.
The range of this parrot is quite extensive--the East African coastal
region from Mombasa to northern Mozambique, Zanzibar Island,
and Southern Nyasaland south to the Transvaal and Natal. Bowen
(J93*&amp;gt; J 93 2 ) examined a number of skins and was struck by the
difference, both in size and colouring, between specimens from the
mainland and from Zanzibar. He writes : " not only are the main-
land and island birds subspecifically distinct, but the mainland
specimens are themselves divisible into a northern and a southern race."
The three geographical forms recognized are :--
P. cryptoxanthus tanganyikae Bowen,
P. c. zanziharicus Bowen,
P. c. cryptoxanthus (Peters).
During the past ninety years there has been a number of references
to this parrot in the Ibis-- by Kirk (1864), Ayres (1887), Finn (1893),
Swynnerton (1907, 1908), Sclater (1911), Vaughan (1930), Vincent
^934)5 Fuggles-Couchman (1939), and several others. The authors
do not, however, throw much light on its habits in the wild state,

merely stating with monotonous uniformity that it is usually found in
small flocks or in pairs, is swift of flight, its harsh cries can be heard at a
considerable distance, it feeds on fruit, such as figs, etc., that the
natives say it does much damage to their millet and maize, and that it
nests in holes in decayed trees, the eggs being white and nearly round
--all of which could, of course, apply to many of the psittacine species.
But there is really little else the field observer or collector can record.
Paget-Wilkes (1928) does, however, describe the finding of two nests,
and writes that one " containing two young birds newly hatched was
found on 6 June, 1924, not far from the first. The entrance-hole was
facing downwards on the horizontal branch of a dead tree, and a large
twig 4 x J in. had been taken into the hole by the birds for some
unknown purpose. The young birds were thirty-six inches down the
hole, and uttered a continuous rasping alarm-note as the wood was
cut away with a hammer and chisel. They were covered with grey
down except for the head and bill, which were white."
Although apparently quite a common bird in the wild only very few
seem to have been brought alive to England. Dr. (later Sir) John Kirk
presented two to the London Zoo, 7th May, 1870 : and one was in
Herbert Whitley's world-famous collection at Primley in 1929. The
only other recorded example, owned by Miss Kay Bonner, is the subject
of the present coloured plate. This bird, so ably painted by David
Reid-Henry, was obtained in 1947 from a well-known London dealer
who insisted that it was a Quaker Parrakeet--readily identified, he
said, by reason of its grey head !
The former specific name fuscicapillus refers to the dusky colour of
the head ; the vernacular brown-headed is hardly a fair description,
the colour of the head and neck really being olivaceous greyish-brown :
cryptoxanthus, concealed yellow, refers to the under wing-coverts.
This species, like all the members of the genus, thrives on the usual

i. Introductory and Some General Aspects
A good glass, a note book, some patience, and a spare fortnight in the
spring--with these I not only managed to discover many unknown facts
about the Crested Grebe, but also had one of the pleasantest of holidays.
" Go thou and do likewise ."
Julian Huxley, 1914 : 492.
In the spring of 1948, having those simple requirements listed by
Dr. Huxley, I followed his advice with no more ambition than a hope
to see some of the fantastic displays of the Great Crested Grebe ( Podiceps
cristatus), so ably and intricately detailed by him long ago. The
experience both interested me and stimulated me to try and learn
more. Since then, and in spite of strong counter-attractions from other
species and bird topics (for I have always been something of an ornitho-
logical butterfly), the grebe has firmly remained my favourite bird, one
whose life-history, though so well explored in some avenues, has many
ill-lit lanes worth illuminating.
The present series will outline some aspects of grebe biology that
I have studied, presented against a background of modern research
especially into behaviour. It represents not the final report, but a
pause for stock-taking along the line. This first, introductory section is
concerned not always so much with observations of a strictly original
nature but with some general aspects, as I see them, to set the scene.
Why does a person spend much of an all too meagre leisure seriously
watching grebes or any other bird species, wild or captive, for that
matter ? There can be no general answer to this question for much
depends on the nature of the individual himself. Besides genuine
scientific interests, which we proud keen amateurs firmly believe we
have, there must be other more personal reasons and rewards to ease
what might well become in time a tedious task. For me, a certain
leaning towards the sensational and the unknown in my bird-watching
is catered for by grebe work. Above all Great Crested Grebes are
spectacular birds. Not only are they themselves conspicuous and
striking but much of their behaviour is involved and elaborate, especi-
ally the multiform displays. In studying grebes, I have derived con-
siderable pleasure and, let it be admitted, self-satisfaction in dis-
covering new facts and forming new theories about the behaviour of
a species already well covered in the literature. Then there are subtler
attractions hard to explain clearly. When in a suitable mood, I some-
times find that the setting in which I am watching my grebes makes my
day not just mentally interesting but full of an unreasoned enjoyment

too. How relaxing it is, for instance, in lethargic August to laze
on the grass bank of the pool in the warm sun, observing the domestic
routine of a grebe family and the comings and goings of neighbouring
species. The mood changed, I am invigorated by those blustering
winter days when the grey waters swirl at the bank and the hunting
grebe is lost to sight in the troughs of the waves. For better or worse,
some of us tend to lose that early simple joy in bird-watching that once
was ours, because of an unremittingly serious approach to our study.
I believe that an occasional return to that former frame of mind levens
the present sterner work.
Great Crested Grebes are almost ideally suited for general study.
Locally common, they have a long reproductive-cycle (which may be
investigated for ten months of the year) with a fascinating, almost
totally unanalysed set of elaborate displays. These last pose many
intriguing and challenging problems as does the whole question of the
species' intimate integration with its aquatic habitat. Large and
conspicuous too, grebes are usually indifferent to the unobtrusive
observer on the bank. The resulting relative ease of watching Great
Cresteds is never so forcibly brought home to me than when I occasion-
ally attempt to observe the quite shy and elusive Dabchick or Little
Grebe (Podiceps rujicollis) which is not common locally. I come away
thankful that I chose its bigger, tamer cousin for my main work.
However, others have succeeded and important field accounts of
Dabchick behaviour are to be found in the papers of Huxley (1919)
and Hartley (1937), while some fascinating and overlooked fragments
on display are given by Lorenz (1935), who kept two in captivity.
One serious drawback in studying the Great Crested Grebe is that
it is practically impossible to catch and mark. Such marking would
enable us to study intimately individuals of known age and status, and
would tell us much of what needs to be discovered--at what age
grebes first nest, the effect of age and experience on territorial be-
haviour, and so on.
With their dagger-like bills and slim necks, dark crown-crest, white
underparts and almost tailless bodies, adult Great Crested Grebes are
distinctive birds at all times of the year. In flight, during some displays
and when the birds stretch and flap on the water, the pure white wing-
patch shows up conspicuously. In their so-called summer or breeding
plumage (which may be assumed in mid-winter !), both male and
female develop the long chestnut, black-fringed " tippits " on the side
of the head. From these frills the species gets its former, conveniently
short and attractive name Tippit Grebe which is in some ways a better
one than that in current use. Also, it completes a trilogy, for the
modern trend is to revert to older names for both the Slavonian and
Black-necked Grebes (Podiceps auritus and caspicus) and to call them
Horned and Eared Grebe respectively.

Great Crested Grebe and Black-throated Diver (Gavia arctica ) in breeding plumage
showing some of the external differences between the two groups. P S *
The grebes are quite primitive birds possibly fairly closely related to
the divers. These replace them in more northern latitudes. Grebes
resemble divers in several details of structure, including the position
ot the legs far back on the body, and in their general way of life. On
the other hand, they differ from them in a variety of characters
including their lobed (not webbed) feet, relatively longer and slimmer
necks and bills, head ornamentation and the pattern and texture of
the plumage ; their larger clutch size, unspotted eggs, striped young-
and manner of courtship ; the kind of feather-lice and tapeworms
which infest them. Because of these many differences, the two o-roups
are now usually separated as distinct Orders, the Podicipitiformes
(grebes) and the Gaviiformes (divers). The similarities are usually
attributed to convergence and not to any close relationship. However
both apparently are the direct descendents of the prehistoric, Eocene
grebe/diver Colymboides of some 40-60 million years ago. To-day the
strange Western Grebe ( Mchmophorus occidentals), which James Fisher
tells me seems the N. American (ecological) counterpart of the Great
Crested, is probably the connecting link between the two groups.
Structurally and in most of its behaviour a grebe, JSchmophorus has
unstriped chicks (see Plate 3 in Bent, 1919) and a distinctly diver-like
display, as those who saw Walt Disney's colour-film " Water Birds "
will recall. This particular display is a fantastic, upright mutual dash
over the water with only the birds' rears submerged.
My studies on Great Crested Grebes have been centred at Burghfield
gravel-pit, near Reading (Berkshire), which is just over two miles from
my home and within easy reach of my motor-scooter. Since 1948 the
grebe summer population at this flooded pit has increased from about
nine pairs to a maximum of eighteen pairs in 1954. During this period,
the total water surface has more than doubled from about 60 to 130
acres, while two small adjoining pools of some two acres each have
been colonized by single pairs. Other breeding waterfowl at Burgh-
field include several pairs of Coot ( Fulica air a), and a few Moorhens
(Galhnula chloropus) and Mute Swans ( Cygnus olor). Dabchicks turn up
now and then in early spring and winter but seldom stay long, the

Great Cresteds driving them off if the opportunity comes. The latter
have no regular avian fish-competitors to contend with--Herons
(.Ardea cinerea) do not visit the pits frequently and Cormorants ( Phola -
crocorax carbo ) less often still, while the two commonest species of
wintering diving-duck, the Pochard and Tufted Duck {Ay thy a ferina
and fuligula ), take fish but occasionally and only very small ones at
that. Fishermen frequent the gravel-pit in some numbers in season,
and, like the grebes, do their fishing near the bank. Of the two, the
grebe seems the more efficient piscatorian. The arch-enemy of the
Great Crested, the large pike {Esox), is present in fair numbers and
takes its toll of young. On average, less than one grebe chick a pair
reaches the flying stage and the pike is probably mainly responsible,
as pointed out by Tucker (1934). An intriguing problem that needs
tackling is the question of how much good fishermen do for the grebe
by reducing the stock of full-grown carnivorous pike. The bird's own
food supply would not be affected directly by the human catching of
fish over about six inches in size.
The Development of our Knowledge of the Great Crested Grebe
Serious work on the grebe is a twentieth-century affair. Over forty
years ago Huxley, then an undergraduate, spent his spring vacation
at the Tring Reservoirs in Hertfordshire watching the bird. The
result was a classic pioneer paper remarkably in advance of its time
and still to be read with considerable profit to-day. In it Huxley
described in detail, recorded the circumstances of performance, and
named all the major courtship displays of the species. Much less
completely, he outlined the true sexual behaviour at the nest, usefully
summarizing the long, diary observations of Selous (1901), the father
of grebe watching. Further papers followed, by Selous in 1920-21 and
Huxley in 1924. The last work was based on the observations of several
watchers at Oxford, and can lay claims to be one of the first of those
co-operative studies which have become such a feature of British
ornithology. In 1932 and 1936 came the reports of Harrisson and
Hollom on their inquiries into population trends in the United King-
dom (except Northern Ireland) and into general biology. These were
based on the joint observations of many members of the recently
formed British Trust for Ornithology. In a very useful paper, Tucker
(1934) expanded the information obtained for Berkshire, Oxfordshire,
and Buckinghamshire. Since the earlier studies of Huxley and Selous,
individual watchers, with one exception, seem to have left Great
Crested Grebe behaviour alone, perhaps because of the apparent
completeness of the first work. In 1934 and 1936, however, Venables
and Lack published two papers on territorial behaviour which Venables
had investigated over five breeding-seasons--the first really long-term
study on the grebe by a single observer. Useful summaries of our

pre-war knowledge of grebe biology are given in the Handbook of
British Birds (vol. 4). Recently there has been a revival in grebe
watching. Hanzak (1952) in Czechoslovakia has written a long
account in English, dealing mainly with ecology, though there are
some interesting remarks on behaviour. My own observations are now
nearly in their eighth year, with one published paper (Simmons, 1954).
At Oxford, which may truly be considered the centre of past grebe
research, L. McCarton of the Edward Grey Institute has started a
short-term study on the ecology and breeding biology. The latter
subject especially deserves attention, for it is still one of the less well-
known topics of grebe life-history. Meanwhile since 1946 a further
census of the grebe population of a sample area (of some twenty
counties in England) has been organized annually for the B.T.O. by
P. A. D. Hollom and an interim report issued (1951). The ten-vear
run of this inquiry ends in 1955.
Some Characteiistics and Problems of Grebe Behaviour and Biology
The Grebe as a Waterbird
The world of a Great Crested Grebe is essentially an aquatic one
and the bird's structure, general habits, and behaviour have all been
a apted for and influenced by it. Really no birds, apart from other
grebe species, are more aquatic, for even the penguins breed on a solid
surface, albeit ice, and walk easily on it. Grebes on the other hand
very rarely come to land and can only progress clumsily. In a grebe
versus penguin argument, however, it must be admitted that whereas
penguins spend much time in the open sea far away from land, grebes
usually stay very close to it. This is not due to any tie with terra firma
but to the grebes' shallow-water feeding habits.
Great Crested Grebes spend most of their life on or below the water.
They not only get most of their food under the surface but also often
prefer an underwater route from point to point. They fight and start
some of their courtship displays too from the deep, which is also their
escape lane. For this submarine existence the powerful keeled
propelling legs with lobed feet lie far back on the body so that they can
give maximum thrust. The body itself, with the relatively small wings
(not used in swimming) and long neck, is well streamlined and water-
proof. The white under-feathers, the " grebe-fur " of commerce, come
into closest continual contact with the water and are therefore very
dense. All the contour feathers are well oiled, especially the thick
underpad which shows up conspicuously as the bird rolls over in the
water and strops it with the bill. In fact, grebes spend a great deal
of their time in preening with a liberal employment of the oil-gland
on the base of the back.

K. E. L. SIMMONS-STUDIES ON GREAT CRESTED GREBES
The whole of the breeding-biology is related to this aquatic existence.
A few points may be mentioned briefly here. The nest is sited in or
near the water, sometimes even floating in it. Wet materials are used
in its construction and many brought up from underwater. As a
protection against damp, the eggs have a chalky surface. The covering-
over with weed of the nest-stained eggs, by the adult grebe, guards
against aerial predators (crows, harriers) which could easily spot
unhidden white eggs in the exposed situations where grebes build.
Lastly, the small young are carried on their parents' backs as a foil
to the underwater attacks of the pike.
To a species so intimately linked with the water ice is a serious
menace, especially if the shallower parts near the bank, where the
grebe gets most of its food, are affected. Unlike surface-feeding ducks,
which can rest on the frozen layer and get some food away on land,
grebes have no local answer to serious icing-over and must move off
to larger, clearer lakes or to the sea. In the south of England especially,
grebes regularly winter inland, but usually sooner or later have to
migrate in very cold spells, soon returning when the thaw comes.
This normal tendency to move out in bad weather probably helped
the grebe in the terrible winter of 1946-47 when other aquatic birds,
notably the Heron, suffered more severe losses.
The Role of the Sexes
The life of Great Crested Grebes is one of true sex equality. As with
many species in which male and female are identically plumaged, the
two sexes play an almost equal part in the various reproductive
activities. The differences that exist, apart from the absolute functions
of fertilization and egg-production, are mainly slight ones of degree.
Evolution has brought about a two-way equality of the sexes more
extreme than in many other animals, man not excepted, for in humans
the term " sex-equality " mainly indicates the acquisition of masculine
social privileges by the female. Not only has the male grebe acquired
many female attributes but the female has many masculine ones. Thus,
it is often very difficult for us to sex a grebe on its behaviour. For
example, both sexes have similar roles in courtship, search for nest-sites,
and help to build. Both defend the territory, solicit copulation with
identical postures, incubate, carry the small chicks, and feed the young.
However, the male is the one that usually mounts in coition and is
more aggressive in dealing with intruders, while the female has a
special call and posture (advertising behaviour) when unpaired and
desiring a mate, or when out of contact with her partner. This adver-
tising may assist males to recognize the opposite sex but they can
probably do this in any case by sight. Even we undiscerning humans
can usually tell a female grebe by her slightly smaller proportions,
especially of the head ornaments. For instance, the female of one

grebe pair, A52, that I knew well (having watched the two birds
for, on average, six hours a day right through their month-long
incubation period), differed from her husband by much the same facial
characters that we associate with human females. She was much more
delicately moulded and had a nice angle between bill and forehead
that the male, with his unenviable " droop-snoot ", lacked.
Courtship.
The social life of the Great Crested Grebe is one of marked formality
and few species spend more time in display. Their elaborate and
multiform courtship displays are outstanding features. As would be
expected, full use is made of the display plumage : tippits and crest.

common form of courtship.

K. E. L. SIMMONS-STUDIES ON GREAT CRESTED GREBES
The chief courtship display, the mutual head-shaking as male and
female face each other with elongated necks, may be seen regularly
from grebe couples from late December (weather permitting) until
early November. Indeed the display of few other species can be seen
so often and with as little trouble. Head-shaking, like the other court-
ship activities, is not directly concerned with coition, which takes
place after distinct pre-copulatory displays on the nest. Because of this
Huxley termed the courtship-displays " self-exhausting " ones, func-
tioning to keep male and female firmly together through the arduous
joint task of rearing the brood. As I hope to show in a later section, the
problem goes deeper than this, head-shaking, at least, probably being
also a sexual appeasing display, functioning directly to inhibit hostile
reactions in the mate.
The Question of Age.
Do Great Crested Grebes breed in their first season after birth or
later ? We just do not know and a correct answer would help a lot in
the understanding of some of the many problems of grebe life. Un-
fortunately, the first year birds cannot be distinguished from older ones.
If only they retained some traces of their juvenile characters when they
have moulted into first winter and then first summer plumage, there
would be no puzzle.
On many waters each year there is a varying proportion of
apparently non-breeding pairs which idle away a good deal of their
time in courtship, but never seem to progress far past that stage. It
is reasonable to think that at least some of these are young birds
incapable of breeding. This would imply that, while first-year grebes
may pair-up and display like young geese and penguins do, they do
not actually breed until their second year. However, at least one
reason may favour a different opinion. As Hollom (1951) shows, in
the breeding-season immediately after the severe winter of early 1947,
the grebe population in those counties covered by his sample census
went down by about 300 birds but had recovered fully by 1948. On
the other side of the picture, in the case of the Heron, in which species
the young birds definitely do not breed until their second year, a
similar recovery after the blows of that hard winter did not take place
until 1949 (Alexander, 1949, 1950), a year later than the grebes.
This suggests that at least some Great Cresteds (those mated to older
birds ?) do, unlike young Herons, breed in their first year.
I believe that age and relative experience affect the behaviour of
grebes appreciably. There are noticeable individual differences in the
intensity and persistence of hostile behaviour, for instance, as several
writers have stressed. My most consistently aggressive birds are those
occupying the traditional territories in a certain pool very suitable for
nesting. The whole bearing of these grebes, together with the fact that

they may establish themselves early in the year, indicate that they are
old-stagers.

Some Aspects of Population

<bodyText confidence="0.99772224" page_id="58091394"  page_num="Page 11" year="" vol="">
The grebe population of England, Scotland, and Wales is un-
doubtedly higher now than ever it has been. Commercial slaughter
(for the sake of ladies' hats) had reduced it to about forty pairs in i860.
Protective legislation, for once in time, saved the species so that by
1 93 1 3 when a careful co-operative census was made, numbers had gone
up by over 3,000 per cent. Judging from the sample counts, numbers
have since increased still further. It seems likely though that the upper
limits of population are now being reached, for the rate of increase
has levelled off appreciably. The most marked rise in numbers since
1931 has taken place in the Thames Valley region mainly (an increase

chicks.
of over 20 per cent) while in the Midlands and further north the
population has gone down somewhat. In the south-east, the increase
has been helped by a host of new, artificial lakes in the form of flooded
gravel-pits. Were it not for these new waters, we might very well have
witnessed a marked overall decline, as has happened on parts of the
Continent. However, I think another factor besides the godsend of
fresh suitable waters may have helped to further the good day of the
grebe. These recently available sites are at first free of the bird's worst
foe, predacious pike. Until the numbers and, more important, the
size of these fish increase, the toll on the young will be very much
reduced. Related to this there is a tendency for grebes to forsake
long colonized waters. It seems quite likely that such desertion is at
least partly effected by too great a predation by large pike. There is an

urgent need for actual figures of brood survival from both old and new
waters to test this supposed relationship between bird and fish. In
any case, I am not suggesting that the pike is the only controlling
factor of the grebe population. There is the food supply (which
includes small pike !) to be considered among many other aspects.

The Great Crested Grebe will not live on any pool and the small
pond which accommodates a pair of Dabchicks and some Moorhens
will not suit the larger bird. It usually breeds on more extensive fresh-
water lakes, gravel-pits, meres, flashes, and the like which must
generally be at least five acres in extent to hold any grebes at all.
Occupied waters of three to four acres are considered exceptional,
though locally a couple of small pits of some two acres each have been
colonized recently (one pair of grebes on each) and young successfully
reared there. As Tucker (1934) points out, however, it is uncertain if
such waters are capable of supporting a breeding pair indefinitely. To
be really suitable, all grebe pools must be shallow enough in places
for the birds to fish in. A depth of between five and ten feet seems best
for this. These waters must have sufficient cover too to house the
nests. Locally, flooded clumps of willow ( Salix ) and great reed-mace
( Typha ) as well as trailing willow branches fill this role mainly, while
patches of giant reed (. Phragmites ) also serve.
I think that grebes are often first attracted to a water by its size,
staying if the feeding is satisfactory. Only when they get into breeding
condition do they start to look around for suitable nesting sites. If the
place lacks such cover, those pairs that really want to nest must leave
and search elsewhere. Other, less intense and probably younger pairs
will often remain where they can get plenty of food but cannot breed,
going through the summer in the early phases of reproductive be-
haviour. This seems the set-up on most of the large London reservoirs.
The Annual Cycle
In August and September some grebes, including most of the
surviving independent young of the year (the stripe-heads), start to
move away from their summer haunts. Very probably some of the
adults involved are relatively young ones, for those older birds in the
traditional territories generally remain. With the onset of colder
weather, however, further birds leave the smaller inland waters,
especially more northerly ones, and move to the larger reservoirs or to
inshore salt water. Some pools, especially in the south of England, are
seldom deserted entirely in winter unless iced over. Many of those
grebes thus forced away often return soon after conditions improve
though they may be banished again by further cold spells. Some
waters are thus occupied early in the year, weather permitting, and

breeding may begin in March if the vegetation is sufficiently grown-up
to anchor the nest, as it always is at the Burghfield pits. Elsewhere, if
the cover is unsuitable, the first eggs are postponed until May and

not generally double-brooded. The breeding-season of many other
species is usually far more restricted because sufficient food for the
young is only available for a comparatively limited period (Lack,
* 95 ^)* Natural selection has not favoured such a limitation in the
grebe and has allowed " the breeding season on any one water to
be largely determined by the state of the littoral growth. This suggests
that food for the chicks is more or less abundant during six months of
the year.
Locally at the Burghfield pits, the annual cycle of events proceeds
something like this. If the weather is mild the grebes that are already
paired may start courting in late December, select a nest-site and
defend a territory. Building and true sexual behaviour follows. Other
unpaired birds are meanwhile finding partners and courting. Usually
this early reproductive behaviour is interrupted, disrupted, and
generally disorganized by bad weather which may even send the birds
away. However, the population builds up during the next few months,
birds arriving singly or in pairs. Nesting is usually well under way by
late March and early April with the very first young appearing in the
middle of the latter month. Birds arriving later nest in May and June.
In these months the early birds may sometimes undertake second
broods though often they have to replace lost eggs and chicks. The
late birds themselves are doing this in July and August. Hence some
stiipe-heads may still be begging for food from their parents in October
and even early November. The population tends to go down gradually
through emigration during these two months until any very bad spell
dismisses all the grebes.
For the sake of the descriptions and discussions on aspects of re-
productive behaviour which will come in later sections, it is necessary
now to give a formal list of the various patterns which follow one
another in time sequence and which make up the reproductive cycle.
This will be useful for reference.

By Tom Spence (Newburgh, Fife, Scotland)
The Purple-capped Lory is perhaps the most beautiful of all birds
although its form may be too stocky and its colours too gaudy for some
tastes. Since few have been imported in recent years and some readers
may not be familiar with the species, a description seems in place.
This lory comes from the Indonesian islands of Ceram and Amboina.
It is pigeon-sized and about the build of the better known Yellow-
backed Lory, Domicella garrula flavopalliata. It differs in its more
massive bill and the longer erectile neck feathers. The general body
colour is more deeply crimson than that of the Yellow-back, but lacks
the purplish tint of the Black-capped Lory. This crimson is deeper
and darker on the mantle while the upper surface of the tail-tip is
deep ox-blood colour and a fluorescent orange, shot red, below. A
variable yellow crescent spans the crop region : the extent of this may
be related to age for this patch has greatly decreased in my birds and
is now scarcely to be discerned in the $ ; she in turn developed two
small purple patches on the outer horns of the crescent, recalling the
similar ornamentation in Gould's Lory, D. chlorocercus. The cap is
black but its distal third is of a variable purple, washed and streaky
in some, in others a deep imperial tint. The wings are of brilliant
iridescent green, free of any olive tinge ; the leading edge of the wing,
the lesser under coverts and the thighs are light blue washed with a
paler shade in some, while the inner webs of the secondaries and the
inner primaries are bright yellow. The bill is deep orange, the cere
dark grey, the iris dark greyish brown with a faint light grey inner
ring in the $ and a more brilliant light ring in the The plumage is
identical in both sexes but the more massive head of the makes
sexing easy.
My pair were imported for me under licence by Mr. Frost and along
with three other individuals appear to be the only specimens brought
to Britain for many years. The birds were not united for many months
and during this period the female became exceedingly tame and
quite fantastically attached to me, caressing me, grooming my eye-
lashes with her papillated tongue and regurgitating food into my
mouth or ears quite promiscuously. After some premonitory pumping
she would seize the commissure and, pulling my mouth round towards
the shoulder she sat on, regurgitate macerated banana and condensed
milk into me. Indeed I even developed a taste for this strange pabulum
for I felt her too sensitive a creature to offend by spitting out her gift !
The male too became very, very tame and when he moulted into adult
plumage and the pair were brought together the two would sit, one on

each shoulder, fondling my ears and murmuring love-words to me or
as often deafening me with their incontinent shrieking.
This state of psittacine felicity was not to last long, however, for the
two had more or less the liberty of the farm office and one day, after
being called away, I returned to find them making confetti of a small
fortune in National Insurance stamps. When I seized the male some-
what roughly to leturn him to his cage, he bit me savagely and has
sought to do so ever since. Thereafter, though his liberty was not
curbed I always armed myself before I dared address him. When
they were breeding, entry into the flight was a real hazard though,
when the male was shut in the shelter, the female was as loving as ever.
Purple-caps seem to be the most tolerant of the lories with regard to
feeding. Mine have, in the morning, a condensed milk/honey nectar
into which is broken white or malt bread, or occasionally sponge cake.
This nectar is less dilute than that for my other lories and is reinforced
with halibut liver oil, wheat germ oil, the whole B complex, B 12 ,
liver extract, red bone marrow extract, and the like from time to time.
The evening nectar is a dilute honey mixture with vitamin C added.
They drink but little of this, but they are great fruit eaters with banana
as the staple. While rearing they were given egg custard of which they
are inordinately fond and consumed the equivalent of one egg in two
days.
While still caged the $ laid several clutches of eggs before the pair
were united. When I first felt the brood-patch preparing, and could
palpate the developing egg in her abdomen my concern for her was as
unbounded as any primiparous father ! Apart from a single egg all
other clutches were of two. The first egg to be laid after introducing
the male was eaten by him * the second egg was promptly removed
when laid and a china pigeon egg substituted. This seemed to con-
vince him, for his behaviour since has been beyond reproach. She
incubated her early clutches, six in all I recall, in a pie-dish half-filled
with peat litter. Of course they were all infertile.
The pair was turned out in early June into a small aviary with a
cosy refuge in a quiet part of the garden sheltered by yew hedges and
walls from disturbance. In the rare sunshine of the time their constant
play was a delight of brilliant colours ; much of this was conducted
hanging from the roof of the flight where their wing-flapping showed
the great yellow wing patch to advantage. The nest-box was attached
in the shelter and was investigated immediately, the pair roosting in it
the first night.
The first egg was laid on the 23rd June, and the second on the 25th.
She did not begin to incubate till the second egg and even then seemed
to be but little inclined for the first few days, coming off to play with
the male at any opportunity. I admit to taking ridiculous liberties
with this pair for I examined the eggs almost daily, taking them out to

-wash them and test for fertility, even floating them (albeit in water
of carefully controlled temperature) to observe with delight the bob-
bings and early stirrings of life in them. The first egg starred and
chipped on the 24th day and hatched within four hours of chipping.
The second egg hatched on the 26th day. I believe this was due to
careless incubation in the early days when she seemed to be happy
with only one egg under her. The hen did all the brooding, keeping
up a constant begging call during the later stages. Her brooding
position was of interest ; the phalanges were clenched and raised
while she rested on the angle of the flexed tibiotarsal-tarsometatarsal
joint.
The young were invested with long soft, almost white, down on the
back and humeral region. This was soon lost, probably through
contamination with regurgitated food. When about three weeks old
the dark second down follicles and the red true feather follicles showed
through the skin and by the fourth week the chick was covered in a
dense dark grey short down with a whitish pattern on the neck and
shoulders recalling a game-chick. About this time the eyes opened
and the egg-tooth was shed. The first feathers showed through on
the flanks about the 60th day and the young bird left the nest on the
95th day after a few days timid peeping out. It began to feed itself
soon after.
The first juvenile plumage resembles that of the parents but is
dingier and duller. The purple of the nape is deeper in this individual
and more extensive than in its parents, while the yellow chest patch
is widespread and diffuse. The feathers of the mantle differ in having
dull green bases to their red tips, while the tail has a faint bluish tip
with the two central feathers drawn out like a pintailed snipe. The
greatest difference is in the under wing-coverts, the posterior row of
which is black tipped and not wholly blue as in the adult. It seems
likely that all juvenile lories of the genus Domicella exhibit this character.
The young bird's bill remained black till it was about four months
old when it gradually assumed an orange colour.
As may be seen, only one young bird survived. At last the parents
began to resent my constant interference and chopped off some toes.
The more mutilated of the two I removed and attempted to rear from
the age of three weeks. All went well till I gave it some banana when
mercifully it soon died, for I fear the task of rearing it would have
been beyond my patience and leisure. The survivor is intact but
for one missing phalanx. This must be an exceptionally tolerant pair
of lories for they have now hatched a second clutch, indoors, with
their first young one still beside them, unmolested.
Although this species has been bred in Belgium by Bruyneel and in
the U.S. by Mrs. Bonestell, there appears to be no record of previous
success in Britain. That this success should fall to me must be one of

the most fortunate chances of beginner's luck, for not only did I
acquire my first lories little more than a year ago but I have never
bred any species ol psittacine before, not even a budgerigar !
Postscriptum
The second clutch alluded to above did not hatch successfully. At
the time of writing both eggs had chipped but the young birds did not
succeed in breaking from the egg-shell, so dried-up had they become.
One chick had died before I had realized the trouble and the other
was adhering to the shell membranes. The umbilicus was dried up
with a piece of shell attached to it that I was unable to remove. It
seemed unlikely to survive but I returned it to the nest-box. It did
pull round and is now four weeks old and just beginning to sprout
its dark grey down. The first young one thrives but is a rather timid
unfriendly creature.

MY BIRDS IN NORMANDY AND IN CALIFORNIA

park looked lovely to me after a two-years' absence. I am glad to say
that, thanks to Mr. F. E. Fook's efficiency and devotion, it is an
unqualified success as a show place. Visitors are extremely numerous,
increasing in numbers each year. This makes possible not only a high
standard of upkeep, as in the past, but also a good deal of improve-
ments. The collection is now quite good again. When I think of other
country places familiar to me in France, in England, and elsewhere,
which have either disappeared or deteriorated so much since the last
war, I congratulate myself to have transformed Cleres from a home
with private collections into a public park enjoyed by hundreds of
thousands each year. In the present circumstances, it was the only
way to maintain the grounds and the collections of birds, park animals,
and plants.
Several notable improvements have been brought in during the last
two years. The most important has been the building of very practical
breeding quarters. They consist of a double row of eleven pens on
either side of a central concrete building. Each compartment includes

Bartlett's Bleeding-heart Pigeons, which had reared young last year
only dropped a few eggs this past season.
In the aviary close to the house, which contains a mixture of many
finches and doves, a Shama, a Japanese Ouzel, a Golden-fronted
ruit-sucker Painted Quails, Cuban Trogons, etc., I was astonished
to find seven Yellow-winged Sugar-birds instead of five, three males and
two females, which I had put there last year. Two are evidently young
birds, but I had never been aware that a pair had successfully nested
in such inadequate conditions ! There had been a lot of pursuit and
quarrelling among the Sugar-birds during the summer, but I failed to
detect a nest among the thick vegetation of the aviary. Besides fruit,
eggs and cake, and some chopped meat, Sugar-birds eat finely cut-up
cheese. I never give any mealworms to my birds. Therefore the
young Sugar-birds have been mostly reared on fruit, egg, and cheese
and whatever flies and other insects the parents could catch.
A few pairs of ducks (Carolinas and Red-billed Whistling Ducks)
were liberated in the garden and did very well, but the damage they
caused to water plants obliged me to remove them. I have now a few
Flamingoes and Trumpeters. Ring-neck Doves and California Quails
were also liberated, but they disappeared after some time.
Chinese Tigrine Doves are very numerous in Los Angeles gardens
where they have become very well established. The native Mourning
Dove is also abundant.

By D. H. S. Risdon (Dudley, Worcs, England)
These bold, cheerful birds are great favourites of mine. I can
thoroughly recommend them to anyone who wants a softbilled bird
which is hardy, attractively coloured without being gaudy, easy to
teed, and has most amusing ways. White-crested Jay-Thrushes are
birds of character. They quickly learn to recognize their owner
and greet his arrival with peals of maniacal laughter reminiscent of
the voice of the Kookaburra. Admittedly, they can be somewhat
deafening indoors, but echoing cheerfully across a garden from an
outdoor aviary, their voices are delightful.

D, H. S* RISDON-WHITE-CRESTED JAY-THRUSHES
For those who don't know this bird it is somewhat smaller than a
Common Jay in size. It has a tail Of average length and a cone-shaped
white crest which is normally carried erect, but can be depressed at
will. The wings are rounded and short, and the flight rather weak.
The beak is straight and pointed ; the legs and feet are strong and
well developed. In fact the Jay-Thrush's favourite method of pro-
gression is by long hops whether on the ground or from branch to
branch.
The colour scheme is brown, white, and black. This does not
sound very exciting, but actually is most attractive. The throat and
head, including the crest, are snow white, slightly darker at the nape.
The beak is jet black, and there is a black streak running from the
beak to well behind the eye. The rest of the plumage is olive-brown,
with chestnut shading on the upper breast just below where the
white ends.
The bird has a bold, swaggering demeanour, and is ever on the
move, poking and prying into everything, and taking an intelligent
interest in all that is going on.
The sexes are alike, but in the pair I have at present, which I am
pretty certain from their behaviour are a true pair, one, I think the
hen, has eyes of a lighter shade of brown than the other.
A mated pair of these birds show great affection for one another.
They are never far apart and seem to enjoy doing everything together.
They always call simultaneously and stimulate each other into greater
efforts as they pour forth their cackling laughter with wide open beaks,
their whole bodies quivering with their efforts.
They enjoy feeding, drinking, and bathing together, and invariably
sleep tucked up close to one another side by side. They also have an
amusing habit of preening each other's feathers, assuming the most
idiotic expressions whilst this is being done.
My pair were certainly the star turns of my garden aviary this
summer, and I have had many a laugh at their antics. When they
first arrived they were in very rough importation plumage, and I
never expected them to attempt breeding, but once I was watching
them foraging about among the undergrowth in their aviary when
one picked up a twig, held it in its beak for a moment, and then
passed it to the other. The significance of this act obviously struck
their minds at the same moment, for they burst into shrieks of
laughter as if the whole idea were just too absurd for words !
A good point in their favour is that they do not skulk--even in a
large aviary. They are always on show and look remarkably con-
spicuous in spite of their lack of brilliant colours.
In a large aviary I have found them quite harmless with birds as
small as Cardinals. Admittedly there was plenty of room for other
birds to get away from them, but never once did I see them chase or

attempt to molest any other bird in the aviary. I would not, however,
recommend that they be associated with anything weaker than
themselves in small enclosures or cages. They have strong claws
and beaks and could do serious harm to a weaker companion. Whilst
pairs adore each other, birds of the same sex fight savagely, and I
have known one nearly scalp another when confined in the same cage.
\\ hite-crested Jay-Thrushes are quite hardy and in my experience
will winter outdoors in an unheated aviary provided with a decent
shelter. I think they come from fairly high up in the Himalayan
mountains, so probably are used to a temperate climate.
They do well on a medium grade insectile mixture as provided
for thrushes and starlings, and like plenty of fruit, particularly orange,
apple, and pear. They will, of course, eat all kinds of insects, and I
give mine 6-10 mealworms per bird daily. These birds are great
batheis, and should have an opportunity to indulge in this every day.
They do equally well in aviaries or large cages. One has occupied a
cage in the Bird House at Dudley Zoo for several years.
For some reason they are not often entered at shows. Why is
difficult to understand, as a pair in good condition would make a
most attractive exhibit. I suppose the reason is that they have to
compete with species which are rarer and more difficult to keep in
condition which doesn't give them a fair chance of winning on their
own merits.
I know nothing of their breeding habits, but I understand that
they make a cup-shaped nest in thick vegetation, and if any young
hatched, unlimited supplies of live insects would almost certainly be
required if they were to be reared successfully.

ANTING

Although much has been written on this habit of passerine birds,
I have met several aviculturists who were unaware of it, and never gave
their birds opportunity to indulge it. And there is the less excuse
for this, seeing that some of the most important observations on anting
have been made by an aviculturist, Mr. H. R. Ivor, who has con-
tributed to our Magazine.
This habit of deliberately applying ants to their plumage is confined
so far as we know--to the passerines. Among them it is very wide-
spread, and may perhaps be universal. The few records of other
groups of birds anting require confirmation, those relating to game-
birds are certainly due to the actions of individuals dust-bathing in
ant heaps being misinterpreted. Most birds use worker ants (which
contain a good deal of formic acid) for this activity, but there are

records of various other materials, usually of an apparently irritant
nature such as tobacco ash, lighted cigarettes, mothballs, small limes,
and various insects, being used.

side of its primaries. While so doing one wing is brought forward and
held away from the body. The tail is usually brought forward, often
to such a degree that it comes between the bird's legs. Indeed, if the
bird is anting on the ground, it often trips up over its own tail, and
falls backwards or sideways. Some species discard the ants, others
eat them after use. Some use one ant at a time, others like our Starlings
[Sturms vulgaris ) pick up a second ant without dropping the one first
used until they have a large ball of crushed ants held in the bill. In some
species the ants may be applied to the tail, rump, or ventral regions,

as well as to the underside of the wing-quills. Some foreign birds--
such as the troupials (Icterus sp.) and Beechey's Jay ( Cissolopha beecheyi ),
show great caution when approaching the ants, and carry the insect
they pick up a little way from the mass of ants. Perhaps in the wild,
such species use soldier ants or other species that could damage the
bird if it hopped down among them, as many of our native species do
w r hen anting.

In addition to the typical anting movements described above, the
Crow (Conus cor one) and the Rook (C. frugilegus) also flop prone on to
the ground with wings outspread, as if they had lost the use of their
legs and were vainly trying to rise. Obviously this will serve to let
many of the ants swarm into the plumage of their own accord.
The Jay (Garrulus glandarius ), Red-billed Blue Magpie ( Urocissa
erythrorhyncha) , and Green Magpie (Cissa chinensis), use rather different
Jay in characteristic anting posture.

movements. Both wings are thrust forward at once, the primaries
brushing the ground, and (at high intensity) almost fully spread, so
that they form a tent around and in front of the bird. This bringing
forward of the wings is accompanied by a shuddering movement.
The tail movements are the same as in other birds. These three
species do not pick up ants in the bill when anting, although at a little
distance they appear to do so as they make similar head-movements
to other birds. They even make incipient movements of picking up
ants, but the bill is always empty, as it is stroked along the underside
of the primaries. They do, however, often pick an odd ant off their
legs or plumage and throw it away whilst anting is in progress. The
Azure-winged Magpie (Cyanopica cyaneus ) shows an intermediate form.
It picks up the ants in its bill in the usual way, but uses the same wing
movements as the Jay and the Green and Blue Magpies.
The possible biological use of anting has been the cause of much
speculation, and as yet no satisfactory definite answer can be given.
My own opinion is that it is most likely to be of some use in the
destruction or discouragement of ecto-parasites. It seems possible
that the formic acid from the ants might render them more easily
removed by the bathing and vigorous preening which usually follow
anting. It has been suggested, and recently announced as a proved
fact by some leading ornithologists, that the anting movements come
about solely through the bird attempting to remove formic acid from
its face by wiping it off on to the wing and tail quills. That it is in fact
nothing more than a necessary precaution or " first aid " when the
bird is feeding upon ants. To me this appears very wide of the mark.
Admittedly the contact with formic acid may be the immediate
stimulus that elicits the anting movements in hitherto inexperienced
birds, or even perhaps in experienced ones. It is even conceivable
that this behaviour might have evolved from such acid-removing by
birds eating ants. But the following facts seem to me to prove that it
is no longer--if it ever was--a mere by-product of feeding behaviour.
Many birds that ant eagerly do not eat the worker ants, but discard
them after use, some, as we have seen, do not even pick them up when
anting. When any irritating substance gets on (? or near) its eye, a
passerine bird immediately turns its head and rubs the eye on its
shoulder. This is not an anting movement (it is shown in identical
form by birds that do not ant, such as pigeons and game-birds), yet
it will be made (as an interruption) during anting if the bird gets some
formic acid in its eye, as often happens. Whereas captive insectivorous
birds are nearly always eager for live insects, including winged male and
female ants and ant pupae, it may be weeks before they are eager to
ant again after having indulged. When not in an " anting mood "
they will come down among a pile of ants in order to pick out the
winged reproductive forms and pupae, but endeavour to avoid the

workers. At such times they show the typical " eye wiping " if they
get squirted in the face with formic acid, but never show the anting
movements. Nor, of course, do the many game-birds and wood-
peckers that eat worker ants freely show anting movements when
feeding.
Aviculturists are in a good position to try to solve some of the
problems connected with anting. But even those who have neither
time nor inclination to concern themselves with experimentation in
the matter can, and should, give their birds the opportunity to indulge
in this habit. All that is needed is to put a few spadefuls of wood-ants'
nest into a sack, and tip it out on the aviary floor. Possibly some of
the smaller species of ants might be better for small birds, but such
species as Pekin Robins (Leiothrix luted), Chaffinches (Fringilla coelebs ),
and Silver-eared Mesias (Mesia argentigula) will use wood ants readily.
The getting of the ants is an irksome task but can, in summer at any
rate, be combined with the collection of fresh ant pupae, a most
valuable food for all captive insectivorous birds. There seem to be
many factors--as yet unknown--controlling the amount of anting in
which individual birds indulge. My Jays almost always ant eagerly
if more than two or three weeks have elapsed since they last had
opportunity. My Lanceolated Jays anted when first given ants in
*95*5 but have not done so since. Yet at the London Zoo--where
Mr. Yealland has kindly permitted me to make observations--I
obtained intense anting behaviour from all three Lanceolated Jays
on both occasions when I gave them wood ants. Similarly, a tame
Magpie I had never anted during its three years of life, whereas
three out of four specimens at the Zoo anted eagerly. Among wild
birds, Starlings usually seem eager to ant. A sack of wood ants put
on a lawn where Starlings come to feed will be sure to afford the
watcher excellent views of anting behaviour. Wild Jays, Chaffinches,
Blackbirds, and Song Thrushes (and probably many other species),
will also freely avail themselves of this adjunct to the bird table.

JENDAYA (OR YELLOW-HEADED) CONURE
(.Aratinga jandaya)

My Jendayas are housed in an outside enclosure about 17 ft. long,

7 ft. 6 in. high, and 4 ft. 6 in. wide. It is a new aviary which was
only completed in May, 1954, and I did not really expect the Gonures
to go to nest; but when fitting up the aviary with perches, etc.,
I put in a nesting log by way of completing the equipment, rather
than with any hope of breeding. The nesting log is an imitation tree
trunk (covered with bark strips) about 5 ft. high, and filled with
earth to about 2 ft. 6 in. and having an entrance hole facing north,
with the usual inside wire netting " ladder ".
During the reconstruction of my aviaries I had to crowd my birds,
and with the Conures I put a spare Golden-mantled Rosella cock
and about twenty hen budgies.
Early in June I noticed the Conures inspecting the log, and I
immediately nailed a stout perch to the outside, giving easy access
to the entrance hole. Within a few days both birds were freely entering
the log, and soon they began to sleep there at night. Two or three
weeks went by and my hopes sank, as I thought the log was only
being used as sleeping quarters. I glanced into the log occasionally
and on the 16th July I saw that an egg had been laid. It was creamy
white in colour and about the same size as that of a Stanley but rather
more pointed at the smaller end. Two days later another egg appeared,
and then a third.
The hen did not commence serious incubation for two or three
days after the last egg had been laid. In fact, one day I saw the
eggs were scattered apart, and I thought she had deserted the nest ;
however, she did settle down eventually, and sat quite closely. The
cock did not assist with the incubation, but entered frequently and
slept in the log most nights.
About the beginning of August I tried several times to catch the
hen off the nest, but, even if she was feeding, immediately I entered
the aviary she flew straight back to the log. On the morning of the
14th August, however, I managed a " peep ", and was delighted to
see that two chicks had hatched. I had no opportunity of inspecting
again until 23rd August, when I found that the third egg had hatched,
and all three chicks seemed strong and healthy. They appeared very
much like big baby budgies--rather skinny and ugly. Later they
became covered with fine down, and it was quite a long time before
they began feathering.
Both parents assisted in the feeding of the chicks, and as the days went
by the hen came off for longer periods, so that I had plenty of oppor-

tunity of observing the growth of the young birds. Each time I lifted
the lid-like cover of the log, the cock bird flew towards me in quite a
threatening manner. He knows me very well, and before he com-
menced his parental duties, he was quite tame and would take a monkey
nut from my fingers.
After the chicks had hatched, however, he kept a watchful eye
on the log, and always flew at me if I laid a hand on it. At that stage
I think his threat was a token one, but when the first two chicks left
the log on ioth October, he really went for me when next I peeped into
the log to ascertain the whereabouts of the third youngster. My wife
was watching and was very amused when he landed on my old
garden hat and attacked it quite savagely. The third chick left the
log four days later.
All three are doing very well as I pen these lines (November, 1954).
In appearance they closely resemble the hen, but the head and upper
part of the breast is pale yellow, and the orange-red tinting on the
lower part of the breast is also paler than that of the parents. Their
heads are slightly flecked with green (as is the head of my hen, although
I believe many hens have a completely yellow-orangish head).
Immediately they came out of the nesting log the youngsters were
able to fly strongly, and were able to perch accurately. I had none of
the nerve-racking experience one so often gets when young parrakeets
emerge and fly around wildly clinging to the wire at the top of the
aviary, and floundering about generally. All three young Jendayas
were composed and quaintly sedate even on their first day.
My pair of Jendayas have proved excellent parents, as even to-day,
nearly five weeks after the young left the nesting log, they are still
being fed occasionally by both adult birds.
The three young Gonures have grown splendidly, and are now
nearly as large as their parents, and they are rapidly becoming as
noisy as the latter.
One youngster is more highly coloured than the others and is
probably a cock bird. Another of the youngsters has a very thin
margin of yellow on some of the green feathers on the upper part of
its back which give in a small degree the mantled appearance which is
seen in opaline Budgerigars. This yellow edging will probably moult
out, but it is just possible that it may be some form of mutation--
time alone will show.
It is still too early to sex the youngsters with any degree of certainty,
but from their present appearance my guess is that they are a cock
and two hens.
The Conures have been fed on sunflower, buckwheat, hemp, millet,
and canary with monkey nuts, seeding grasses, and green food of
various kinds. In addition when the young were being fed soaked oats
and soaked bread were supplied and these were eaten greedily.

By S. T. Johnstone (Slimbridge, Glos., England)
During the last eight years we have, through the indefatigable
enthusiasm of our Director, Peter Scott, gathered together the most
representative collection of waterfowl in the world. In the twenty-five
acres enclosed for the purpose, there are, at the time of writing, about
1,200 birds of some 140 kinds, and we have kept during that time
more than 150 out of a total of about 220 forms of Anatidae now known
to science.
We have three specimens of the strange and primitive Magpie
Goose ( Anseranas semipalmata) , and although the males have gone so
far as to build a nest of twigs and straw, the female, unfortunately,
has shown no sign of co-operation.
We have kept eight species of Whistling Ducks (Dendrocygnini).
Three of the rare Spotted species ( Dendrocygna guttata) came to us in
the spring, thriving in our orchard pen until the arrival of the cold
weather, when they became restive and sought every opportunity
to escape. In consequence they were shut up in our aviary but
although these huts were heated with oil lamps, they succumbed during
a spell of bitter weather. We have found that the White-faced
Whistling Duck (. Dendrocygna viduata ) is also very susceptible to the
cold. In the spring of 1954 we obtained a mains electricity supply
and hope, when funds permit, to construct a properly heated aviary
which will enable us to keep the more delicate species successfully.
The Plumed Whistling Duck (. Dendrocygna eytoni) from Australia seems
to be perfectly hardy, but unfortunately all our four specimens are
males.
Among the swans, all species of which are represented, there are
four fine Trumpeters ( Cygnus cygnus buccinator ), the property of the
Queen, and presented to Her Majesty during the Canadian tour.
We also have in our care a male Black Swan ( Cygnus atratus) belonging
to Sir Winston Churchill. We are particularly pleased to have bred
the Goscoroba Swan ( Coscoroba coscoroba ) twice in the last three years,
and two cygnets have been reared. This, so far as we know, is only
the second occasion that the species has been bred in this country.
The collection of geese includes members of all species with the
exception of the Kelp Goose ( Chloephaga hybrida). A pair of Falkland
Kelp Geese ( Chloephaga hybrida malvinarum ) were presented to the
Trust by Dr. W. Sladen on his return from the Falkland Island Depen-
dencies. These beautiful birds fed well and were very tame, but
unfortunately contracted aspergillosis ; one died four months, and

the other six months after arrival. Undoubtedly the most interesting
and valuable birds are the flock of seventeen Hawaiian Geese ( Branta
sanvicensis). Through the great kindness of Mr. Herbert Shipman,
of Hilo, Hawaii, we were presented with two females and a male'
and from these we have, during the last three years, bred seventeen
fine healthy geese. One of the original females died this year from
atrophy of the adrenal glands, and a pair of young birds that were
sent to another collection for stock purposes were accidentally
poisoned. 7
. * ther interesting geese in the collection include a specimen of the
pink-legged and pink-billed variant of the Bean Goose, which has
been described as Sushkin's Goose ( Anser arvensis neglectus ), though
there is some doubt whether it is a true subspecies, and the Perry River
race of the White-fronted Goose, collected by Mr. Scott on his Canadian
expedition, which is intermediate between the large Tule Goose
(Anser albifrons gambeli) and the typical American form (Anser albifrons
frontalis). The Hawaiian Duck (Anas platyrhynchos wyvilliana ),
Kerguelen Pintail (Anas acuta eatoni), and New Zealand Brown Duck
(Anas aucklandica chlorotis ) are the rarest of our dabbling ducks. A New
Zealand Scaup (Aythya novae-seelandiae) is perhaps the most interesting
of our divers. &amp;
What is believed to be the first Hartlaub's Duck (Cairina hartlaubi)
brought to Europe, has been in the collection for three years. It is
extraordinary that this bird of the equatorial forests of West Africa
can survive an English winter out of doors. We have made several
attempts to keep the Indian Pygmy Goose (Nettapus coromandelianus
coromandelianus) , and indeed a female lived for two years, but the other
specimens died as a result of the cold weather.
The European Eider (Somateria mollissima mollissima) and the British
Saw-bills thrive at the New Grounds on a diet of live eels imported
weekly from Denmark. The Eiders breed well, and young Red-
breasted Mergansers (Mergus senator) and hybrid Goosander-
Mergansers ha.ve been hatched. We have not had the same success
with Harlequins ( Histrionicus histrionicus histrionicus) and Longtails
(Clangula hyemalis), neither of which has lived for longer than six
months. The North American Ruddy Duck (Oxyura jamaicensis
jamaicensis) , however, lives well and breeds freely ; its delightful display
is a source of great amusement to our visitors. A few species have bred
at the New Grounds, of which we have not been able to find any
previous breeding record in captivity in this country. These include

smithi), and Red-breasted Merganser ( Mergus senator). In addition, the
South African Pochard ( Netta erythriphthalma brunnea) was bred this year
from eggs laid in August, but the species had been successfuly bred by
Terry Jones at Leckford earlier in the season.
One of the enclosures is devoted to hybrid waterfowl. A study of
the behaviour and voice of these hybrids, as well as their appearance,
casts important light on their relationships, and is of considerable
assistance in establishing the course of evolution in this group of birds.
For the most part hybrid waterfowl are not handsome, but one or two
are exceptions. A male Chiloe Wigeon X Carolina ( Anas sibilatrix X
Aix sponsa) is startlingly beautiful and only slightly less colourful is a
male Chilean Teal X Carolina (Anas flavirostris x Aix sponsa ). The
most interesting hybrids are perhaps those between one genus and
another. Among others we have the following unexpected crosses :
Mallard X Shelduck (Anas platyrhynchos platyrhynchos X Tadorna
tadorna), Mallard X Red-crested Pochard (Anas platyrhynchos platy-
rhynchos X Netta rufina) , Yellowbill X Scaup (Anas undulata undulata x
Aythya marila marila), Cape Teal X Tufted Duck (Anas capensis X
Aythya fuligula) as well as the two hybrids between Dabbling and
Perching Ducks mentioned above, and a number of hybrids between
the goose genera Anser and Branta. So far all these hybrids have
occurred accidentally and no attempt has yet been made to produce
hybrids by deliberate cross pairing. The Trust is very much interested
in waterfowl hybrids, and we should like to know of any particularly
interesting examples, provided that the parentage is known for
certain.
It is the Trust's policy to keep as many birds fully winged as is
practicable and we have, at the moment, some thirty-nine species
flying. Among these are a flock of twenty Southern Red-billed
Whistling Duck. These birds take a keen interest in all the other
occupants of the enclosures as well as the staff, and when this enter-
tainment palls, they divide into two forces and hold a pitched battle
between themselves.
One of our headaches has been the water supply to our many ponds.
This has been obtained from the irrigation ditch which bounds our
paddocks and is known locally as a " rhine " (pronounced reen). The
amount has varied a great deal, and the flow has been almost negligible,
resulting in muddy, unattractive water in the ponds and bare expanses
of mud in summer. The aforementioned electricity supply has
enabled us to instal two pumping systems. One pump takes water
from the rhine at the rate of 20,000 gallons per hour. The other, by
means of the " well-point system " produces 5,000 gallons hourly from
the water-bearing sand 12 feet below the clay soil of our pens. The
result has been most satisfactory. The water in the ponds is now
comparatively clear and the levels remain constant.

It was sad to hear of the death of my old friend, Walter Goodfellow
a great traveller, collector, and naturalist, who I had known for the
past fifty years though I had seen or heard little of him for many years
past. I hear he died in July, 1953, and it is fitting that something of his
work for aviculture and ornithology generally should be recorded in
our Magazine.
I think my first meeting with him was in 1904, at Mrs. Johnstone's
house, ' Burrswood," Groombridge, where he had arrived with a
collection of birds from New Guinea. Mrs. Johnstone was a very keen
aviculturist, possessing the ambition and means to secure some of the
most wonderful birds for her collection, and she had specially engaged
Goodfellow to collect some of the treasures to be found in New Guinea.
I was very pleased to be invited to meet him and see his first New
Guinea collection, which included the Greater, Lesser, and Kino- Bird
of Paradise, Manucodes, and many others. He was of the typical
explorer type, dark and handsome, with moustache and imperial
reminding me of Buffalo Bill, who I had seen as a child. Even in those
days he had travelled extensively and there were not many tropical
countries that he had not visited. As early as 1900 he contributed an
excellent series of articles to the Magazine entitled " A Naturalist's
Notes on Ecuador " of which he considered there was no other country
in the world where birds abound in such numbers and varieties. These
artides are very well worth reading again. Here is a quotation which
shows the kind of travelling he undertook. " Myself and Mr. Claud
Hamilton travelled from the Pacific coast and, after crossing all the
mountain ranges, journeyed for weeks on foot down through the damp,
uninhabited, virgin forests on the eastern side until we reached the
eadwaters of the Amazon. After staying for months among the wild
ndian tribes there, we descended the Napo in dugouts, and so reached
the Maramon where we took boats for the remaining 4,000 miles down
the Para, having thus crossed the entire continent."
Goodfellow did a great deal of collecting for the British and Tring
Museums in the remote parts of the world, but besides this, proved
himself to be an extremely good collector of living birds for avi-
cultunsts, bringing home, always in wonderfully good condition,
numbers of rare specimens for such well-known aviculturists of those
days as Mrs. Johnstone and Mr. E. J. Brook, of Hoddam Castle. By
Uie year 1910 he had imported alive no less than twenty species of
aradise birds alone, and those of us who generally saw the arrival
of these collections were impressed by their cleanliness which was
evidence of the great care and attention that had been bestowed upon
them.

In 1910 Goodfellow made an expedition to Formosa and while there
noticed a native wearing in his hair the tail-feather of a Pheasant of
striking appearance. The friendly native readily gave up his adorn-
ment which he said came from the region of Mount Arizan. Believing
the species to be something very rare if not new, Goodfellow proceeded
to the mountain and managed to obtain an adult female only, the skin
of which he brought home. The species was undoubtedly new to science
and was named Calophasis mikado , though the male was still unknown
except by one tail-feather. The following year, however, Lord Roths-
child sent out collectors and obtained specimens of both sexes. In 1912
Goodfellow set out again for Formosa with the express purpose of
obtaining living specimens of the Mikado Pheasant for Mrs. Johnstone.
He found the birds scarce, but succeeded in bringing home eleven birds
which proved to be good breeders. The stock in this country increased,
but with the outbreak of the first World War most of the pheasant
keepers, like other aviculturists, had to give up their birds, and, I fear,
most of the Mikados in Britain went to America.
Another of Goodfellow's discoveries was a handsome Lorikeet, found
only in the mountains of Mindanao in the Southern Philippines. He
was again on a collecting expedition for Mrs. Johnstone and brought
home living examples, as well as skins, of this hitherto unknown bird.
The skins were sent to Tring where Dr. Hartert named the species
Trichoglossus Johns tonics.
In 1911 Goodfellow was selected as leader of a collecting expedition
to Dutch New Guinea sponsored by the B.O.U. and the British
Museum. Many papers on the collection were contributed to the Ibis
by W. R. Ogilvie-Grant, and in 1912 the B.O.U. presented Good-
fellow with their Gold Medal.
Mr. E. J. Brook, of Hoddam Castle, was a very keen aviculturist
who possessed all the requirements for maintaining a fine collection of
rare tropical birds, and commissioned Goodfellow to collect for him
in Western Ecuador. He spent two years there, eventually arriving
home with a superb collection consisting principally of Tanagers,
most of which were of species never before seen in Europe, as well as
a number of other birds such as Sugar-birds, Grosbeaks and others.
Again in 1925 we find Goodfellow returning home from another trip
to New Guinea with over a score of Paradise Birds and others and
I well remember on one occasion being invited to " Burrswood " to
see a number of Chinchillas for which Goodfellow had made a special
expedition to the Andes on behalf of Mrs. Johnstone.
And so we bid farewell to a great naturalist and wonderful collector.

NOTES ON THE NATIONAL SHOW
OF CAGE-BIRDS

was, as usual, a very wonderful exhibition, especially of Budgerigars
in every known variety, and Canaries. There were close on a hundred
classes for the former alone and all were well filled ; a quite
bewildering array. British birds also formed a fine display with
over forty well-filled classes, and it was interesting to note the large
number in the classes for cage or aviary-bred specimens. In fact, the
successful breeding of British species appears to have been carried
out by many enthusiasts who should have acquired considerable
nowledge of their habits, difficult to obtain otherwise. One learns
that the British Bird Breeders' Association now numbers its members
in hundreds. Besides the more ordinary species one noted Tree
Creepers, Goldcrests, Wrens, Pied Flycatchers, Tits, Shorelarks,
lpits, Redstarts, Wagtails of all the British species, Waxwings, and
all the Thrushes, Shrikes, Woodpeckers, and Nuthatch. The condition
of the birds left nothing to be desired and showed great skill on the
part of their owners. Foreign birds were, as usual, a most interesting
section and one saw birds seldom, if ever, seen before in this country.
There was a very good entry of Lovebirds of which Fischer's were
the most numerous. These seem to have taken to captivity extremely
well, while the true Black-cheeked has apparently died out. The
Red-faced seems to hold its own, though very difficult to breed, and
a pair of these secured first prize. Mr. Sawyer's Salawati King was
a fine specimen of a rare species, and there were many other good
Parrakeets including Golden-mantled Rosella, Blossom-headed, and
Gonures of various species.
Mi. Sawyers fine Lear's Macaw kept up its reputation as a prize-
winner in a class of two, the other being a very good example of the
Derbyan Parrakeet belonging to Mr. J. E. Williams.
Of the small ornamental finches, Waxbills and the like, there was a
grand show in which one noted the Cuban Finch, Olive Finch,
Blue-breasted Waxbill, Gouldian and Parrot-finch, Pin-tail Non-
pareil, Diamond Sparrow, Long-tailed Grassfinch, and the delightful
\iolet-eaied Waxbill. Zebra Finches have become so popular that
they required four classes, three of which were for the various colour
varieties that have now appeared. It is proving such an adaptable
creature that it, like the Budgerigar and Canary, is becoming a
domestic species.
There were several species of Weavers and Whydahs, amongst the

latter being Jackson's, Long-tailed, Paradise, and Queen, of which
the last two are said to place their eggs in the nests of some of the
Waxbills. Amongst the Cardinals and Grosbeaks was a pair of
so-called Pygmy Cardinals which struck me as being extremely
attractive, like bantam Green Cardinals, though less green. I have
never seen this species before and do not know its correct name.
There was also a Chinese Hawfinch and an Evening Grosbeak, both
rare species. In the " Other Species " class there was a Spotted
Towhee and a Fox Sparrow, two rare and attractive birds.
The class for Birds of Paradise and Bower Birds was disappointing
because, owing no doubt to the very bad weather before the show,
the owners of five Birds of Paradise had, probably very wisely, decided
to keep them at home. The two entries that did appear were an
extremely fine Satin Bower Bird in full adult plumage and an adult
cock Regent Bird, both sent by Mr. J. E. Williams, who had also
entered most of the Paradise Birds.
There was one solitary Humming Bird, a Pucheron's Emerald,
exhibited in a very suitable large cage, by Mrs. D. K. Draper. It
certainly seemed to be enjoying life in the temperature of the hall,
which was fairly well warmed.
The Sunbirds made a fine show with the Malachite, Lesser Double-
collared, Amethyst-rumped, Scarlet-chested, and Orange-breasted,
and it was with the last of these that Mrs. D. K. Draper won the
award for the best foreign bird in the show. It was a truly grand class.
Sugar-birds, too, were good with several species, and so were Zosterops
and Pekin Robins, while the Tanagers, both small and large, were
very fine, including the Yellow (first prize), Blue and Black, Pretre's,
Superb Striated, and a good many more. The classes for Flycatchers,
Redstarts, Thrushes, etc., were well filled and contained several
striking varieties. Mrs. S. J. Williams sent a grand pair of Niltavas,
Natal and Cape Robin Chats ; Mr. Sawyer a Mountain Blue Bird,
Plumbeous Redstart and Natal Robin. He also obtained a first prize
for a pair of rare Varied Thrushes, while other good birds in these
classes were Silver-eared Mesias, Orange-gorgeted Flycatcher, Hermit
Thrush, and Rufous-chinned Laughing Thrush.
There were some nice Starlings, Glossy and otherwise, the first
prize going to Mr. Sawyer's very fine Amethyst.
Mrs. D. K. Draper took first prize for a very lovely Hartlaub's
Touracou, and in the class for small Insect and Fruit-eaters Mr.
Sawyer scored first and second prizes for his Red-headed Manakin
and Coppersmith Barbet.
The last two classes in the Foreign section contained some of the
most unusual birds in the show. Mr. J. E. Williams sent a pair of
what he called " Blood Birds ", which I took to be Ox Peckers
(*Buphaga africana), birds that like to remove ticks from the hides of

cattle and then to suck the blood oozing from the wound. They did
not look very happy on ordinary perches and would probably have
preferred the hide of a cow ! There were also an Orange Minivet
Clarmo Red-faced Mouse Bird, Cedar Waxwing, Sibias, and a very
iaie Cuban Black-browed Woodpecker.
TJis has certainly been an extremely fine show, splendidly organized
by Cage Birds, who gave the proceeds to charity. Great credit is due
to all concerned.

Early in September Messrs. J. W. Lester and A. J. Woods, Curator
o eptiles and Head Keeper of the Bird House respectively, went to
Sierra Leone with two members of the B.B.C. Television Service who
took films, photographs, and recordings of a great variety of the lesser
known fauna, both vertebrate and invertebrate. A collection of live
specimens was, of course, made, and these arrived in London on 16th
December. Of the mammals brought back, four were new to the
collection ; of the birds, fourteen species and subspecies had not
previously been exhibited here, and at least two species are new to
aviculture.
The rarest prize was, naturally, a White-necked Picathartes (Pica-
thartes gymnocephalus) which makes a particularly interesting com-
parison with the Grey-necked (P. oreas) brought from British Cameroon
by Mr. Webb in 1948, and still living in the middle aviary at the Bird
House. Neither species has ever been given a really satisfactory
common name. They were originally known as Bald Crows and
placed among the Corvidze, but are now thought to be more nearly
related to the Starlings, though their general deportment rather
suggests affinities to the Babblers, while there is some superficial
resemblance to Sarcops calvus, the Bald-headed Starling of south-
eastern Asia. Bannerman's name, the Bare-headed Rock Fowl
suggesting some gallinaceous bird, is hardly appropriate. White-
necked and grey-necked are poor descriptive names, for in neither
case is the colour confined to the neck feathers. A really good common
name would not be easy to find, but something describing the bare and
curiously coloured skin of the head would seem to be desirable. The
eastern form is confined to the Cameroons ; the western one inhabits
rocky forest areas of Sierra Leone, the Gold Coast, and Togoland.
The nesting and other habits of the two species appear to be similar *
the nest is composed of mud and is built on the face of an overhanging

rock. The coloured plate of P. gymnocephalus in vol. 6 of Bannerman's
Birds of Tropical West Africa, is good, except that the legs are not accu-
rately drawn, the tarsus, which is actually between 62 and 68 mm. in
length, being shown as much too short. A coloured plate of the
Cameroon bird accompanies Mr. Webb's very interesting account in
the Avicultural Magazine, Vol. 55, No. 5.
Twenty-six Emerald Starlings ( Coccycolius iris), most of them in
immature plumage, are also of special interest. The adult plumage
is of a beautiful metallic golden green with purple on the belly and on
either side of the head. A very good coloured plate of this Starling
appears in vol. 6 of Bannerman's Birds of Tropical West Africa. Other
birds new to the Collection were two Forbes' Blue-breasted Kingfishers

shown side by side in the Bird House. The White-throated Green
Bulbul seems the best name for Pyrrhurus simplex, though White-
throated Olive Bulbul might be rather better. Bannerman's name,
" Simple Leaf-love " sounds too much like a Shakespearean village
idiot, and Sclater's " Simple Bulbul " is not much better. The French
" Bulbul modeste " is all very well, but so many other Bulbuls are
unassuming in colour, and this one is not more shy and retiring than
other closely related forms. The Dusky Bulbuls reminded me of the
related Pycnonotus barbatus nigerire that are so conspicuous about the
Cameroon villages, and whose rather discordant inconsequential song
was always the first to be heard at dawn.
There were forty Sunbirds in the collection. Of them twenty were
the Kemp's Olive-bellied ( Cinnyris chloropygius kempi) ; four Coppery
(C. cupreus) ; three Superb (C. superbus ) ; eight Yellow-bellied (C.

hoped that this owl will make a mate for the bird, also presented by
Mr. von Michaelis some two years ago, and which lays eggs every
spring. Some twenty Budgerigars have been bred in the new aviary ;
two of them 1 egularly find their way out through the inward pointing
wire netting funnel, and return after a flight, so they, at any rate, are
good homers . Two Gockatiels and one Black-footed Penguin have
also been bred in the Gardens, and the Emus are laying.

Gerald Durrell showed his colour film " Grand Chaco ", a pictorial
record of his recent collecting expedition in Paraguay.
The film opens with views of the Chaco, a great level plain which
stretches across half of Paraguay. It is really a continuation of the
flat Argentine pampas. The flora is an odd mixture of temperate
subtropical and tropical : thorn scrub overgrown with tropical
flowers and woodland, side by side with open patches of savannah
land dotted with palm trees and a great variety of cacti. Shots of
scenery, birds, and the extraordinary Leaf-cutting or Parasol Ant
are shown.
The film proceeds to show how Durrell and his wife organized the
camp site, and then went on their first trip into the interior : first
travelling on the Chaco Railway (Ford Eights mounted on narrow
gauge rails) and then, on reaching the end of the line, continuing
the journey in bullock carts. We are shown the collectors hunting
for the small fauna and there are pictures of the Horned Toad and
the very rare Budgetts Frog, which were the first live examples ever
to be brought back to this country.
The local inhabitants helped in the hunting, and the next sequence
shows a Paraguayan searching for and capturing the little Three-
banded Armadillo. This species had not been seen in London since
the 1800's.
On return to camp it is seen how the collection grows day by day ;
then we see what an average day's work was like, starting with the
cleaning out of cages and the preparation of food. There are shots
of Crab-eating Racoons, Douroucouli, the rare nocturnal monkey,
Black-faced Ibis, various parrots and parrakeets, Seriema, the Pygmy
Owl, and of bottle-feeding a baby Giant Anteater.
The next sequence shows how a local farmer, having had his chicken
run robbed by an Anaconda, asks Durrell if he would like to capture
it, as it is lying up in a swamp behind his house. They go out on
horseback, and ride through the swamp, find the snake, and after a
short chase succeed in capturing it. Back in camp, the birds' and
animals' reaction to the reptile are shown.
The remainder of the film is devoted to the capture of a Rhea.
It is hunted and captured in the old style, by men mounted on horses
armed with boleadoras, the deadly South American weapon
which consists of three balls on strings that are whirled round and
thrown so that they entangle the quarry's legs.
The final scenes are of the departure. This was of a very hurried
nature, caused by a local revolution. It must have been very dis-
heartening to the Durrells, after going to so much trouble to get
together a representative collection, to have to leave behind all but
the more precious and smaller specimens, all there was room for in
the aeroplane lent to fly them out.

The jS h f irman ' thankin g Gerald Durrell and his wife on behalf
ol the Club, and congratulating them on the excellency of the film
said it was almost incredible that this was a first attempt at film-
making, and that the Club would look forward to seeing any future
films. The members and guests signified in the usual manner that
they were in complete agreement with these observations.
The next meeting of the Club is on 9th March, 1955.

J&quot; Anderson, of Durban, Natal, has been very successful in
breeding Grey Parrots. Since September, 1951, his breeding pair has
reared lour young in three nests--a first record for South Africa.

In 1911 Mark Armstein, of Cork, had the unique experience of a
pair of Hoopoes hatching and fully rearing a nest of five young in his
aviaries. He is now over eighty years old, but is well, active, and
still retains an interest in birds.

D. F. Castle writes : "I am sorry to say I did not rear the two
young Guiana Parrotlets. They came out of the nest fully feathered,
a cock and a hen, but were not very strong on the wing, and could not
fly upwards. I put them back in the nest-box each evening, but they
seemed to spend most of the day on the ground. When they had
been out of the nest-box about ten days the weather was very cold
and damp, and I thought they would do better in a cage in my bird-
room. I put them with their parents in a four foot cage, and they were
all right for a couple of days, but on the third morning I found the young
cock bird dead on the cage floor--it had been completely scalped by
one or both of the parents. I took the young hen away and put it in
a Budgie show cage with plenty of seed on the floor, but it died about
a day later--it had always been the weaker bird. I would have said
the young cock was feeding itself at the time it was killed."

An increase in the number of members means an increase in the
status of the Society, so that its voice will be heard the more in the
furtherance of its object of popularizing the study of British and
foreign birds in freedom and in captivity.
Support is desired from all members, especially in the enrolment
of new members.

The Waterfowl of the World. By Jean Delacour, with illustra-
tions by Peter Scott. Country Life, London, i 954 . p ric e
#5 5 s - net.
This is the first of three volumes which will cover the waterfowl
swans, geese and ducks, of the world. It is particularly welcome fo^
no general work on swans and geese is in existence, and J. C. Phillips'
A Natural History of Ducks is almost unobtainable and in any event
its price is far beyond the reach of most aviculturists. This volume
deals with the Magpie Goose, the Whistling Ducks, Swans, the true
Geese and Brents ; the Cereopsis, Sheldgeese, Shelducks, South
American Crested Ducks, and Steamer Ducks.
In the introduction the author gives a short survey of the classifica-
tmn of waterfowl and quotes part of the paper " The family Anatidae ",
w ich he published in collaboration with Ernst Mayr in the Wilson
Bulletin (1945), and which contained a proposal for "more natural
grouping of species with a better understanding of their affinities
expressed by a simpler taxonomy This classification is followed
in the present volume with the exception, as a result of research effected
since 1945, *f two important points, Anseranas being considered as
constituting a separate and highly differentiated sub-family, and the
tribe Merganettim being merged with the Anatini.
The principal characteristics of each of the birds dealt with are
described, together with its distribution and general habits, both in
the wild and in captivity. The sections on captivity will naturally
be of greatest interest to readers of the Avicultural Magazine, and these
lave been done with the care, thoroughness, and wide knowledge
that would be expected from such an experienced and world-famous
avicultunst as Monsieur Delacour.
The book contains sixteen colour plates by that great painter of
wildfowl, Mr. Peter Scott. These depict the adults and young of all
the birds treated in the text, and facing the colour plates are useful
outline drawings of the same subjects. The plates of the chicks are
particularly useful. Not all the colour plates reach the same high
standard, a case m point being those of the Swans.
There are thirty-three distribution maps and a full systematic list
and indexes of scientific and English names. No one interested in
waterfowl should be without this book and the two subsequent
volumes are awaited with interest.

I am writing this note in the hope that a reader may be able to inform me of the
whereabouts of the above-named picture, which is by Henry Stacy Marks, who died
in 1898. I have an excellent reproduction in colour of this painting, which depicts
most accurately a Hyacinthine Macaw, a Blue-eyed Cockatoo, a Greater Sulphur-
crested Cockatoo, a Salmon-crested Cockatoo, a Western Slender-billed Cockatoo,
a Lead beater's Cockatoo, a Blue and Yellow Macaw, and a hen Red-tailed Black
Cockatoo. There is also a black-and-white reproduction of the same painting in
The Children's Encyclopedia , vol. v, p. 3503.
I should be most grateful for information about the picture or regarding the source
of the coloured reproduction.

AIRPLANE WING
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.996610454545454" page_id="58091427"  page_num="Page 44" year="" vol="">
The account of the affliction known by the comical name of " airplane wing "--
generally called by the waterfowl breeders " slipped wing "--was very interesting.
I had not seen this in any birds other than ducks, geese, and swans, and I believe
that it is due to the too rapid growth of the flight feathers which, in the blood-quill
stage, may be so heavy that, once they begin to fall outwards, the bird has not the
stiength to keep them in place. One often sees goslings when growing their first
flight feathers, lepeatedly hitching up the wing as it were. This condition does not
last for many days, and provided that the tip of the wing remains in position all is well.
Affected birds are often apparently strong, well-grown specimens. Keeping the
wing tip in place for a few days by means of a sticking-plaster sling corrects the
deformity, but care must be taken not to hinder the rapid growth of the flight feathers.

WOOD PIGEONS AND STOCK DOVES
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.975886176470588" page_id="58091427"  page_num="Page 44" year="" vol="">
I have decided to write some comment, as a member, in appreciation of Mr. Derek
Goodwin's notes on Feral Pigeons, an article highly informative and comprehensively
presented. The knowledge we Americans have of what you Europeans sometimes refer
to as the Common Wood Pigeon is remote and obscure and as for Stock Doves we
know nothing either. Our books have failed us miserably.
Therefore there is a crying need in this country for knowledge on both the Wood
Pigeon and the Stock Dove, and I have taken upon myself, on behalf of our North-
West Avicultural Society, to make every effort to indicate our thirst for knowledge
on the subject.
I have mailed you photos of a painting by myself of our Band-tailed Pigeon which
may be a close relative of the European Wood Pigeon--we do not know as yet.
For some unknown reason the habitat of our Band-tails is limited to part of our
Pacific coast only, which seems strange in so vast a country as ours.
Having delved in aviculture and libraries for half a century I find that my efforts
in the search for comprehensive pictures of either Stock Doves or European Wood
Pigeons have been futile. Mr. Derek Goodwin could render us a great service by
contributing an article in the Avicultural Magazine.

The Medal may be awarded at the discretion of the Council to any
Member who shall succeed in breeding, in the United Kingdom, any species of
bird which shall not be known to have been previously bred in captivity in Great
Britain or Northern Ireland. Any Member wishing to obtain the Medal must send
a detailed account for publication in the Magazine within about eight weeks from
the date of hatching of the young, and furnish such evidence of the facts as the
Council may require. The Medal will be awarded only in cases where the
young shall live to be old enough to feed themselves, and to be wholly independent
of their parents. The question of awarding a Medal for the breeding of local
races or sub-species of species that have already been bred shall be at the discretion
of the Council. No Medal can be given for the breeding of hybrids.
The account of the breeding must be reasonably full so as to afford
instruction to our Members, and must appear in the Avicultural Magazine
before it is published or notified elsewhere. It should describe the plumage of
the young, and be of value as a permanent record of the nesting and general habits of the
species. These points will have great weight when the question of awarding the
Medal is under consideration.
In every case the decision of the Council shall be final.
The Medal will be forwarded to each Member as soon after it shall have
been awarded as possible.
The Medal is struck in bronze (but the Council reserve the right to issue
it in silver in very special cases) and measures i\ inches in diameter. It bears on
the obverse a representation of two birds with a nest containing eggs, and the
words " The Avicultural Society--founded 1894 ". On the reverse is the following
inscription : " Awarded to \name of recipient ] for rearing the young of [name of
species ], a species not previously bred in captivity in the United Kingdom."
The Council may grant a special medal to any member who shall succeed
in breeding any species of bird that has not previously been bred in captivity in
Europe.

BREEDING RESULTS AT THE KESTON FOREIGN
BIRD FARM, SEASON 1954, AND SOME RECENT
ACQUISITIONS

By Edward J. Boosey (Keston, Kent, England)
Despite a summer which, for sheer vileness, beat all records even
lor our climate, our breeding results at Keston were not nearlv as bad
as I had feared they might be.
The arctic cold of mid-May caused, as I have already recorded, the
death in the nest of three young blue Ringnecks, while Magpies dealt
successfully with the fourth, after it was fledged, by pecking it as it
clung to the wire netting and inflicting a chest wound from which it
subsequently died.
For the first time for many years our old pair of lutino Ringnecks
not only reared no young ones, but did not go to nest at all. If this
was because of the weather, one can hardly blame them, but I suspect
that a contributory cause may have been the fact that they had only
just been moved into a new aviary. This unfortunately was necessary
in the case of many of our breeding pairs of parrakeets as all our
aviaries are in process of being completely reconstructed, with enlarged
flights, having metal instead of wooden framework, and many of those
to house breeding pairs were not ready for occupation until March.
Two nice young lutino Ringnecks were reared, however, by a new
green hen mated to a lutino-bred cock bred here a few years ago,
and they reared two green young ones in the same nest.
An Alexandrine mated to a cock Alexandrine X lutino Rino-neck
hybrid had infertile eggs.
. * ne P air of Layard's had clear eggs, while the other pair hatched a
single young one which, when about half grown, succumbed to the
cold at the same time as the three young blue Ringnecks. Both pairs
are very young, however, and I hope may do better next season.
These attractive little members of the Ringneck family have always

46 E. J. BOOSEY-THE KESTON FOREIGN BIRD FARM, SEASON 1954
been avicultural rarities, partly, no doubt, because of their restricted
range, which is confined solely to Ceylon. As far as I know, they have
only once been bred in this country.
The " hen " of a " pair 55 of Plumheads eventually turned out, as
so often happens with these birds, to be a cock. Another one, however,
obtained at the same time, is definitely a hen, and this is fortunate,
as she is mated to our matchless little cock lutino Plumhead. With
his particularly rich yellow body colour ; head like deep rose velvet ;
and small bright scarlet wing-patches, I think I have never seen a
lovelier little bird of any kind, nor a more perfect specimen, and I
only wish that Plumheads were not at the best of times such very shy
breeders.
The lutino three-quarter Alexandrine, whose grandparents were
a cock Alexandrine mated to a hen lutino Ringneck, has improved
out of all knowledge after her last moult, and is mated to a particularly
fine young normal green Alexandrine, bred by one of our members,
Captain Veitch, in whose aviaries I think her grandfather was also
bred. Originally she did not seem to make the progress she should,
and I eventually discovered that she was being badly bullied by her
brother who, not being a lutino, doubtless has better sight than hers.
I cannot ever recall a similar case of bullying among parrakeets, still
immature, that were members of the same brood--in this case, too,
just a single brother and sister.
A few Bourkes were bred, and Elegants, but the most satisfactory
Grass Parrakeet result was the rearing of nineteen young Turquoisines.
The building up of a breeding stock of these beautiful little parrakeets
has been a rather long and laborious process, as we started a few
years ago with an imported nucleus consisting only of one pair and
an odd cock. This, however, is much better than just a single pair,
as one can at any rate hope to breed a mate for the odd cock, and as
their progeny can then be mated back to those of the original pair
one does not have to resort to direct brother to sister in-breeding.
A cock Elegant mated to a hen Turquoisine reared three young
ones, a hen and two cocks. Like most hybrids they are fine specimens
and the cocks are distinctly handsome, being like very brightly
coloured Elegants with a quite vivid orange patch on the belly and
the suggestion of a red shoulder patch.
Two pairs of Splendids, obtained from a Welsh breeder, failed to
propagate their kind owing to an excess rather than a lack of zeal.
Both hens took at once to their nest-boxes, and were only seen again
when they had been practically crowded out by their own eggs--the
two boxes being found to contain no fewer than thirty-one eggs
between them !
Our old breeding pair of Pileated Parrakeets had a brood of three,
making twenty-two young reared since they have been at Keston.

A brother and sister pair of their progeny reared a brood of four
of excellent size, but they were badly plucked in the nest. Another
couple of the old pair's young ones I had kept, hoping they would prove
a pair, turned out to be two cocks. 8 y prove

48 E. J. BOOSEY-THE KESTON FOREIGN BIRD FARM, SEASON 1 954
A loss which caused me the maximum amount of regret was the
escape of a particularly fine and certain cock African Grey Parrot.
He and the hen were obtained as grey-eyed young ones during the
brief lifting of the parrot ban, and had developed into a really splendid
and very devoted pair which, incidentally, should have been about
ready to breed next season. The great thing about them was that
they were young, and had never been spoiled for breeding purposes by
caging, and they were consequently the most promising couple.
They had been moved into a new and longer aviary, and,
unobserved, had bitten two holes in the roof of the flight, although
it was made of brand-new half-inch mesh netting. Both were in the
aviary one afternoon at 3.30, but by 4.30 the cock had completely
vanished and has never been seen or heard of from that day to this,
despite the offer of a substantial reward to anyone returning him alive.
It is, of course, almost unheard-of for a mated cock parrot at liberty
to desert his hen if she is still in the aviary, and this bird's complete
disappearance will always remain to me an unsolved mystery.
I was afraid that we should be left with a hen Grey in breeding
condition, and nothing to mate her to, but by a great stroke of luck
we were recently offered two cock Greys.
This seemed altogether too good to be true, and we wondered if
they would really turn out to be cocks. However, as soon as they
were out of their travelling boxes it was obvious at once, from their
large heads and massive legs and feet, that they were indeed two
cocks.
They are promising specimens for breeding purposes, as they are
not tame, have certainly not been caged for long, and I should say
are wild-caught adults.
Late last autumn we obtained two more Greys that proved to be
the typical tame hand-reared grey-eyed youngsters which it is a
great temptation to make pets of!
They were sold as a pair, but although one is slightly larger and
more masculine-looking than the other, I have an idea that they are
really both hens. If they are our stock of African Greys now consists
of two pairs and a spare hen.
A pair of Roseate Cockatoos, the hen of which was bred here some
years ago, reared their usual annual brood of three--two hens and a
cock, and we kept the young pair to increase our stock, and hope to
obtain unrelated mates for them.
A fine male Citron-crested Cockatoo remains unmated. I doubt if
we shall ever get a hen of his own kind for him, which is a pity, as
they have never been bred, but failing that, a hen Lesser Sulphur-
crested would be the next best thing, and I should be very glad to
hear from anybody who has one for disposal. They can be sexed by
the eye-colour ; the cock's being almost black, and the hen's brown.

E. J. BOOSEY THE KESTON FOREIGN BIRD FARM, SEASON 1 954 49
A fair number of Cockatiels were bred.
As to lovebirds, we have Fischer's and both green and blue Masked,
and as usual with the spectacled lovebirds, they proved difficult to
sex with cei tainty. Broods of both species were reared, however, as well
as some young from a blue Masked mated to a green. Pairs of
Peachfaced were obtained too late to breed.
Many thousands of Budgerigars of all colours were bred, and the de-
mand for rainbows a very beautiful colour variety which originated
here during the war, proved to be world-wide. In addition to the
Continent, they were exported to India, Japan, South Africa, Canada,
and America , in the case of the last two countries, of course, in small
quantities, as only a few can be taken in personally by aviculturists.
The only Grass Finches we put up to breed were Gouldians, and a
small stock of these did quite well, rearing about a dozen young ones.
Other finches 1 eared included normal white, silver, fawn, and
chestnut-flanked Zebra Finches, as well as a few Saffron Finches
and white Java Sparrows.
Several of the very handsome Australian Crested Bronze-winged
Pigeons were bred and also some Necklace Doves.
Two pairs of the pretty little Cape or Namaqua Dove which, except
for its longer tail, is scarcely larger than a Diamond Dove, although
in excellent feather, failed to come into breeding condition which,
considering the vile summer, was hardly to be wondered at. I have an
idea that a really prolonged spell of hot weather would be necessary
to bring these attractive little doves into breeding condition. They
have the reputation of being lethargic aviary inhabitants, but I noticed
that they became considerably livelier on the rare occasions when we
had a few fine sunny days.
Recent additions of the dove population include a pair of Triangular-
spotted Pigeons, a pair of Indian Green-winged Doves--beautiful but
desperately wild--and also a pair of the very lovely little Australian
Plumed Ground-Doves. These doves belong to the genus Lophophaps,
and I think I am right in saying that there are only three species,
namely plumifera,ferruginea, and leucogaster.
Our pair are of the latter race or species--the White-bellied Plumed
Ground-Dove and I am not certain whether plumifera and fetruginea
have ever been imported. In any case, even the White-bellied, which
has the widest range of the three, is seldom obtainable, and always
expensive to buy.
They are being wintered in a large cage in a heated birdroom. As
one would expect from their purely terrestrial habit, they never perch,
but spend all their time on the floor of the cage, which has a thick
layer of peatmoss upon which they are periodically given a small
square of turf. We shall try and give them an aviary in which they
are the only ground birds, because although they look so small and

harmless, they are said to bully other ground birds such as quail, etc.,
and also to persecute their own wives.
They inhabit rather barren and very hot parts of Australia, and
delight in sun-bathing on rocky ledges. We propose to let them share
an enclosure with a pair of Elegants which are in one of our terrace
aviaries facing due south in a very sheltered position. As they hardly
ever fly, they will not interfere with the Elegants at all, and we propose
to put a layer of sand over half the flight and at the back of it construct
a miniature rockery of flat slabs of stone on which they can sunbathe--
provided there is any sun to bathe in ! It will not be necessary to
supply any nesting receptacle as they are so truly terrestrial that their
nest merely consists of a shallow grass-lined depression in the ground.
During the spring we received two birds which we have never
previously had at the farm. They were sold as Yellow-headed
Troupials and Military Starlings, but on arrival turned out to be
two kinds of Marsh Bird, namely the Yellow-headed ( Agelaius
icterocephalus) and the Red-breasted ( Leistes superciliaris) . Both have a
simple but striking colour scheme, the former being jet-black with a
lemon-yellow head and a small black area round the eye, while the
latter are dusky black with the upper half of the breast bright crimson.
Temperamentally, however, they are very different, the Yellow-
headed being an extremely active aviary inhabitant with a cheerful
ringing " Plink . . . plink . . . plink-plonk-plink " call-note which is
frequently uttered, while the Red-breasted proved silent and lethargic,
though possibly they would liven up a bit in a spell of really hot
weather. Also they spend most of their time on or near the ground,
so that one sees little of the bright crimson of their underparts. Both
species proved partly insectivorous and partly seed-eating.
A pre-war enclosure containing a pond has recently been roofed
over, and is now a really large aviary about 70 feet long by 20 feet wide,
by 12 feet high. During the past summer this contained among
others Scarlet Tanagers, Giant and Jackson's Whydahs, Shamas,
Red-breasted Marsh Birds, Black-headed Orioles, Spreo and Purple-
headed Glossy Starlings, Necklace Doves, and Australian Grested
Bronze-winged Pigeons. Both the last named successfully reared young.
Most of these birds are spending the winter in a smaller aviary with a
heated shelter, and will be put out again next spring, when we hope
some of them will breed. Most of them were newly imported, and,
of course, the more difficult breeders seldom make any attempt to go
to nest until they have been in the country for at least a year.
The Spreo Starlings are of considerable interest. They were obtained
from the Continent simply as " Spreos ", which we naturally assumed
to be the most beautiful and at the same time most freely imported
species--namely the Superb Spreo ( Spreo superbus). On arrival they
were very dull-coloured, being simple dark bluish-green, with a

greyish crown of the head ; the lower breast and belly dark chestnut
some creamy-white on the inner webs of the flights and hardly any
metallic gloss on the plumage. They looked, in fact, like young birds
not yet moulted into adult plumage ; and this is what we assumed
them to be.
We have now, however, had them for the best part of nine months,
and although they have done a complete moult, their appearance has
not changed at all, so it seems certain that they are actually not
superbus , but the Beautiful or Chestnut-bellied Spreo (Spreo pulcher )_
ranging across Africa from Eritrea to Senegal, as they tally exactly
with Bannerman's description of this race in vol. 2 of his The Birds of
l\ estern and^ Equatorial Africa. He describes their nesting arrange-
ments, and it is interesting to note that they construct a sort of outsize
\\ eaver s nest spherical and made of grasses with the entrance near
the top, and placed in a bush--as I had imagined that all starlings
nested in a hole of some kind, either in a tree or building.
Ouis aie, judging by their behaviour, an obvious pair, and have
been seen carrying nesting material, and as I doubt if this race has
ever been bred, we hope to have a shot at it next season. Although
they have the intelligent attractiveness of all the Starling family, it^is
difficult to see why they were called " The Beautiful " since, judging
by descriptions of the others I have read, I should say that they are
probably the least beautiful of all the Spreo group.
Perhaps the Purple-headed Glossy Starlings were the most
spectacular, as they made full use of the great size of the aviary and
looked really magnificent in flight with the sun--on the few occasions
when it. consented to shine--glittering on the ever-changing hues of
their brilliantly-metallic plumage ranging through green and blue to
purple. Their flight in a really large aviary was interesting, starting
with powerful wing-beats and ending in a glide before alighting.
So, too, was the flight of the Crested Bronze-winged Pigeons which is
swift and powerful, with the tail momentarily raised high over the
back on alighting. Their wings make a quite loud whistling sound
in flight.
Among permanent residents in the aviary are Mandarin and
Carolina Ducks, Oystercatchers, and Ringed Plover--the latter a trio
of doubtful sex, though probably all cocks.
The Mandarins and Carolinas came from Woburn, and were very
kindly given to me by the late Duke of Bedford shortly before his
death. Although they are full-winged, they hardly ever fly except
when having fun and games in the spring. Then they sometimes take
off, and after flying low for a short distance, land on the pond with
a splash.
T. he Oystercatchers are particularly beautiful in flight with their
black wings so strikingly barred with white. In addition to their

attractive appearance they are lively and interesting aviary inhabitants,
forever examining and probing into everything with their long slender
bills, and they make full use of the miniature shingly paddling beach
which our General Manager, Mr. W. D. Cummings, under whose
care they are, has fixed up for them at the shallow end of the pond.
Here they probe and bathe to their hearts' content, as do the Plover,
though these are chiefly interesting in bathing. The Oystercatchers'
lovely wild whistling call is sometimes heard during the day, but
chiefly at night when the moon is up.
When they first arrived they were somewhat lame, and their
normally orange-yellow beaks were almost black, and rather brittle.
Now they are in lovely condition with the colour back in their beaks,
and have fully repaid Mr. Cummings for the care he has lavished
upon them.
They seem to like a varied diet, including insectivorous mixture,
bread and milk, and, much to my surprise, groats and wheat, as they
are about the last birds I would have expected to eat hard corn.
Perhaps their favourite food is live gentles, of which they have a
generous daily allowance. They also eat snails, and are very fond of
shrimps and cockles, which they are given every other day. Cockles
are, of course, one of their chief items of diet in a wild state, and I have
often wondered why these birds were given a name which suggests
that they spend their time rushing madly about trying to catch the
nimble oyster !
The Ringed Plover are most attractive and dainty little waders to
have in a suitable aviary, and require the same diet as Oystercatchers,
with the exception, of course, of corn, and I have never seen them
tackle shrimps, though they will eat cockles.
Our two other large planted aviaries contained a rather miscel-
laneous collection of birds, including Crested Bronze-winged Pigeons,
Necklaced and Cape or Namaqua Doves, a couple of cock Short-billed
Minivets, Napoleon Weavers, Grenadier Weavers, Goldfinches, two
cock Yellow-headed Marsh Birds, Saffron Finches, Giant Whydahs,
Lavender Finches, and finally a couple of Grey Singing Finch X
Canary hybrids--most beautiful songsters. Young were reared by
the Crested Pigeons, Necklace Doves, and Saffron Finches.
One of these aviaries contained a pair of pure-bred Amherst
Pheasants, and the other a trio of Goldens, the cock of which was
still in immature plumage. The Amherst's eggs were placed under
one of the Golden hens, and several chicks hatched, which she
successfully reared without any trouble in the same aviary as her sister
and the immature cock, just brooding them at night in whatever part
of the aviary she fancied--usually under a thick elder bush.
Perhaps the most rarely imported birds on our farm are four
species of South African Warbling Finches of the genus Poospiza,
</bodyText>

namely : The White-throated (Poospiza melanoleuca ), the Chestnut-
and-Black (P. Mgro-rufa), the Pretty ( P. ornata), and the Ringed
(P. torquata).
Only the Pretty is at all finch-like, resembling a miniature Chaffinch
of rather cinnamon colouring, while the White-throated and the
Ringed remind one respectively of a small Cole Tit and a miniature
Pied Wagtail. The handsomest of the four and also the best songster
is the Chestnut-and-Black, which in addition to these colours has
areas of pure white and dark slate-grey in its plumage.
Mr. Yealland tells me that the London Zoo has never had a specimen
of the Ringed, so it seems probable that ours are the first ever to be
imported into this country.
Although the birds of this genus have been called finches, it is a
rather misleading name, and I doubt if any of them would live for
long on the normal finch diet of seeds and green foods. It is true that
ours eat a ceitain amount of seed, but they are also given insectivorous
mixture, bread-and-milk, and gentles, all of which they eat with
relish, and some appreciate a thin slice of apple pushed through the
wire netting close to a perch.
We only ever had one White-throated Warbling Finch, which we
eventually parted with as there seemed no chance of ever getting-
a mate for it.
Of the other thi ee species, the pair of Ringed were given an aviary
to themselves. This faced due south, and had a tangle of wild clematis
growing up the back, in addition to which a bundle of gorse was
nailed up under overhead cover in a secluded corner. The birds
themselves were in perfect condition, and I am sure the fact that
they made no attempt to go to nest was due to the wretchedly cold
and sunless summer.
The Pretties and the Chestnut-and-Blacks shared a large planted
aviary with various other birds, including the pair of Amherst
Pheasants.
The hen Chestnut-and-Black, although she had a perfectly good
husband of her own, perversely mated herself to one of the three
Pretties (of whose sexes we were uncertain), and constructed a typical
cup-shaped finch nest high up in a bush. This, however, was later
found destroyed, possibly having been crash-landed upon by the hen
Amherst, who was rather inclined to fly up wildly when she was
being too hotly pursued by her husband. This, incidentally, is a
isadvantage with pheasants in an aviary containing small nesting
birds.
The three Pretty Warbling Finches were then transferred to another
planted aviary and nested, and I think the hen started to sit. Here
again, however, the nest came to grief--this time possibly destroyed by
a pair of Saffron Finches who became very aggressive to all and

sundry when they had young in the nest, or else again by a pheasant
landing on top of it, as there was a trio of Goldens in the aviary.
However, we still have the Ringed, the Pretties, and the Chestnut-
and-Blacks, all wintering together in an aviary with a heated shelter,
and shall try next season to give them all aviaries to themselves, as--
except for the odd stroke of luck now and again--I never think much
in the way of breeding results can usually be expected in a mixed
collection.

By Dep^ek Goodwin (Virginia Water, Surrey, England)
This article has been written in response to a request for some
information on European wild pigeons.* With these as the central
theme, I have also ventured to deal with some aspects of general
interest to pigeon-watchers or pigeon-keepers, and to a large extent
equally applicable to birds of this group elsewhere. I have not
discussed the feeding-behaviour at any length, since so far as I know
it does not differ in any essentials from that of the Feral Pigeon
(Goodwin, 1954) except in the case of the Woodpigeon. This species
has a special movement (Heinroths, 1926-7) for plucking berries,
buds, etc., and probably also has innate reactions enabling it to
recognize certain tree-foods.
There is much difference of opinion as to whether such names as
Stock Dove should be written thus, or as Stock-dove, or Stockdove.
I have no strong opinion on this matter, and if in this paper I have
used the last form most often, it is simply due to the greater ease of
typing it so.
I have used the now popular English names, but it should be
mentioned that in bygone days the Woodpigeon was known as Ring-
dove and still is in some bird-books. It is the Cushat of the Scots.
In many poems by different authors, the term " Stockdove " almost
certainly refers to this species. The Stockdove itself is locally known
as Rock Dove or Blue Rock Pigeon, causing confusion with Columba
livia which is properly so-called.
Some behaviour patterns of breeding pigeons
In this section I propose to describe, and where necessary, briefly
discuss, some characteristic forms of behaviour that are--with the
possible exception of driving--common to all the European species
* I have used capitals for species names. Where I have used the word " pigeon "
or " dove " uncapitalized, it is used as a general term to cover any or all of the
Columbidae.
The line sketches are merely to give a general impression of the subject and have
no pretention to art or detailed accuracy.

and to most other pigeons as well. 1 hese behaviour patterns are all
characteristic of some stage of the breeding cycle, although in the
case of display flight and the bowing display by no means rigidly
confined to it. Specific differences in the bowing display and display
flights are described briefly under the species headings, and will not
be discussed here.
The Bowing Display
In this the displaying bird, facing (or walking around) the object
of its display, lowers its head, utters a characteristic cooing, and by
special movements or erection of feathers exhibits the display markings
on neck, wings, or tail. Contraction of the pupil usually takes place.
This display differs greatly in detail from species to species, the bow
may be lapidly repeated as in the Turtledove, slow and deliberate
as in the Stockdove, it may or may not involve the presentation of
wings or tail. Always it is frontal when at full intensity, although a
tendency to flee fiom the object displayed at, or the latter's moving
away from the displaying bird, may at times prevent this from being
immediately obvious. The bowing display is always self-assertive in
chaiacter, but is usually only shown when the bird is, to some degree,
sexually motivated. In doves of the genus Streptopelia it seems to be
mainly sexual. In the Rock Pigeon and the Speckled Pigeon (Columba
guinea&amp;apos;) low intensity forms of this display may be purely threatening
or defensive.
Nest-calling
This is the term commonly used for cooing given by a pigeon,
eager to begin nesting, at a potential nest-site. When such a bird has
discovered a suitable place it adopts a crouching posture with tail and
rump somewhat raised, lowers its head, and utters a characteristic
cooing which is, in many species, very similar to the ordinary advertise-
ment song", dwitching of the folded wings and nodding of the
head usually accompany this. Both sexes nest-call, but commonly the
male initiates such behaviour and shows it at higher intensity than the
female. Lone pigeons--especially solitary confined birds in full
reproductive condition--may nest-call, but usually this behaviour
is only indulged in when the mate is near by, and the latter normally
soon joins the nest-calling partner. Mutual fondling and calling on
the nest-site then follow, at any rate if the female approves of her
mate s choice, as she usually does. Whilst thus on the site together,
the pair seem to be in an absolute ecstasy of mutual affection, and
this behaviour probably functions to forge a strong emotional bond
between newly paired birds, as well as reinforcing such a bond in
older pairs. It is repeated at subsequent visits to the nest-site, but the
nest-calling and mutual ecstasies soon largely give way to nest-building.

In the Rock Pigeon (and its domestic descendants) and the Stock-
dove this is commonly seen for several days prior to the female laying

quite gently, at the top of her head. The intensity of driving varies
greatly. Some male Domestic Pigeons give neither their mates nor
themselves any rest at this period, others only drive intermittently and
in a half-hearted manner. The male Stockdove is said (the Heinroths,
1927-8) to strike his mate fiercely with his wings when driving. This
I have not yet seen, and I suspect the statement--which the Heinroths
give second-hand--is based on the aggressive encounters of cock and
hen Stockdoves in the early part of the nesting-cycle being mistaken for
true driving. If the driven female goes to the nest-site she is chivvied
no further.
It is commonly supposed that the driving male is deliberately trying
to force the female to go to the nest-site. The Heinroths (1949) on the
grounds of their long experience with Domestic and Rock Pigeons,
consider this so. I am inclined to doubt it. Although the male stops

driving if the hen goes to the nest, his driving does not appear to induce
her to go thither. So far as I have seen, the male never drives when
the pair are isolated from others of their kind, even if they are at full
liberty. The stance adopted by the driving male and his apparent
visual fixation on the female's head are suspiciously suggestive of his
normal behaviour immediately prior to and during copulation,
furthermore, it sometimes happens (the Heinroths, 1949) that the
driven female will suddenly stop dead still and the mating ceremonial
lollows. These facts make one suspect that the causation of the male's
driving might be in a desire for coition. But such a theory is difficult
to reconcile with the lack of driving in isolated pairs. That, as Whitman
(1919) suggested, the sight of other pigeons near by arouses in the male
a feeling of jealous possessiveness towards his mate, and this emotion
elicits the driving, would fit the observed facts, but it is difficult to
prove or disprove. I have not seen driving in other species, with the
possible exception of the Barbary Dove, and in this species too I have
only seen it when others were about. The male Barbary Dove shows
more aggressiveness, or at least shows it more obviously, and I am not
at all sure his behaviour is really homologous with that of the Rock
Pigeon and Stockdove. Still less am I convinced that this is the case
with various reports of driving in other species that I have heard and
read. In some, at least, the observer may have been mistaken, as I
now think I was over my Laughing Doves (Goodwin, 1947), and
misinterpreted aggressiveness for true driving.
Turning now from the motives activating the driving male to the
biological function--if any--I can only think of two that seem even
laintly plausible. Driving might prevent the hen from being fertilized
by another male. That the hen at this stage shows no sexual interest
in strangers if her mate is present does not absolutely nullify this
ypothesis, since such indifference on her part might have co-evolved
with masculine jealousy. Secondly, if such behaviour on the part
of the male actually does make the female spend more time at the
nest-site, then it might be of use in connection with nest-building
(q.v.) or protection of the nest from strangers. The Heinroths (1949)
show that driving occurs most intensely in young pairs or in birds
nesting at a new site, and conclude that its function is to impress
(presumably on the female) the whereabouts of the nest-site " dass ein
Einpragen des Nistortes bedeudet ". This I find difficult to reconcile
with the fact that a lone pair of Domestic Pigeons do not drive even
under such conditions. Also it seems unlikely that the hen needs
*reminding" of the nest's whereabouts. The excellent memory
of a hen pigeon for any place whither she has gone in company
with her mate and indulged in nest-calling with him, is easily proved
y means a hand-reared hen Domestic Pigeon " paired " to her
owner.

58 D. GOODWIN-NOTES ON EUROPEAN WILD PIGEONS
Nest-building
In the European species--and all other pigeons for which nest-
building has been described--the male collects the material and the
female builds the nest. In the Domestic Pigeon (the Heinroths, 1949)
and perhaps in other species, the female may bring a few twigs, but her
contribution in this way, presuming her to be heterosexually paired,
is negligible. The chief stimulus eliciting the collection of nest-
material in pigeons is the mate sitting on the nest-site ready to build.
In normal pairs the builder is always the female and the collector the
male. If, however, a hen pigeon receives the appropriate stimulus,
as she will do if she is paired to another female, then she will show
the otherwise masculine behaviour-pattern and seek for and carry
material to the sitting bird. As with gulls and some other birds, nest-
building in pigeons appears not to be fully emancipated from its
(presumed) origin as a displacement-activity. If during incubation
the female is at all reluctant to quit the nest when the male comes to
take his turn, he will often go and gather a twig for the nest. My
friend Mr. Bertram Stone, pointed out to me that this is particularly
liable to happen--at any rate with Domestic Pigeons--at the moment
that the young are actually hatching, when the female is often reluctant
to leave them.
Male Pigeon (any branch-nesting species) giving building material to female. (For
explanation see text.)
In tree-nesting pigeons the male always walks over, or alights on,
the female's back, and presents the twig to her over her shoulder (see
sketch). Leaving aside possible psychological implications, this
behaviour may be of use in testing the strength of the growing structure
which will later have to support the weight of both young and adult.
Also in branch-nesting pigeons the siting of the nest might at times
make a frontal approach difficult. The Rock Pigeon, Stockdove,
and Speckled Pigeon also show a strong tendency to present nesting
material to the female from behind, even although this is often difficult

to achieve if the hole or nook used is on the small side. This is an
additional reason to those given by the Heinroths (1949) for supposing
branch-nesting to be the primitive condition in the Columbidae and
hole-nesting a recent development so far shown only in a very few
species. 7
Most pigeons use twigs, dead roots, stems, and so on, for their nests.
1 ey avoid soft substances and choose twigs of a tough and wiry
nature if possible. Hence if by chance it comes upon pieces of wire
of suitable length these supply a " super-normal " stimulus to the
material-seeking bird, and are taken eagerly. Hardly a year goes by
without someone finding a pigeon's nest built entirely of wire, and
announcing the fact in the press with many foolish comments about
the bird s "abnormal " choice of material. The Woodpigeon gathers
much of its nesting twigs from the tree, seizing the bare twigs and
breaking them (if it is lucky) with a similar movement to that used
when plucking berries or acorns. At times, however, it forages for
material on the ground, as do all the other European species. *
The European Species
The Woodpigeon (Columba palumbus) is the largest, and in Britain
the commonest, of the European wild pigeons. It is about the size
ol tne average Homing Pigeon, with a proportionately heavier body,
larger tad and shorter wings and legs. It is larger than most of the
feral Pigeons in British towns, but a good deal smaller than " show "
specimens of most domestic breeds. In appearance few birds can
surpass it. The general colour of the upper parts is soft grey, strongly
tinged with bluish on rump and head, but less so on the wings. The
breast is a soft mauve-pink (one of the many different colours for
which most bird books use the term " vinaceous ") shading to near
white on the belly and creamy-grey on the flanks. There is a white
patch on the wing which is conspicuous in flight. A white patch on
either side of the neck is set off by an area of iridescent green just
above it (see sketch). The bill is golden-yellow, with a white cere
and pmk gape-edges. The irides are pale silvery lemon or greenish-
white, and together with the " spilt " appearance of the pupil (said
m f.T 16 . t0 * tS pear-shaped, but looking as if due to a spot of
blackish pigment adjacent to a spherical pupil) rather detract from
its charms. Juveniles are duller and browner, with rusty fawn breasts,
dark eyes, and no white on the neck. Most females have slightly
smaller neck-patches and paler pink breasts than most males.
^ oodpigeon is found throughout much of Europe, western
Asia, N.W. Africa, and some of the Atlantic Islands. These forms
differ only slightly from that described. The other wood pigeons of the
Atlantic islands, undoubtedly derived from the same stock, have
now become sufficiently differentiated to rank as good species.

D. GOODWIN-NOTES ON EUROPEAN WILD PIGEONS
In some northern parts of its range the Woodpigeon is mainly or
entirely a summer resident. Elsewhere it is sedentary or nearly so.
It seems likely that most of the " extra " Woodpigeons coming into
southern England in winter are from Scotland and northern Britain
rather than overseas (see Colquhoun, 1951). Sportsmen often maintain
that these " foreign " Woodpigeons differ from the English ones,
oblivious of the fact that unless they had come from Asia or Africa
they would not show any difference. Some of the descriptions of these
" foreign Woodpigeons " that have appeared in the sporting press
do not fit any species known to ornithology !
The Woodpigeon was undoubtedly a bird of the primeval European
forests. It has, however, adapted itself well to the changes wrought
by man, and is now common in wooded agricultural country, park-
land, and even some towns, such as London and Paris. Colquhoun
(1951) considers it as a bird of open country that nests and roosts
in trees. In my opinion every detail of its form, deportment, and
behaviour betray it as primarily a woodland bird. Heinroth (1926-27)
remarks on its similarity of posture and movement to the Imperial
Fruit Pigeons (Carpophaga sp.). Particularly revealing is the fact
that when Woodpigeons feeding on the ground are disturbed (in open
country) they almost invariably fly to the nearest trees (provided that
these are at a safe distance from the enemy), whereas Stockdoves or
Rock Pigeons feeding with them usually fly a short distance, or circle,
and then drop at once to earth again. In the Orkneys the Woodpigeon
has even adapted itself to nesting on the ground, but in most parts of
Scotland it is noticeable that where there are few trees there are no
Woodpigeons.
Although taking much of its food from the ground in the form of
grain and seeds, fallen nuts and acorns, greenstuff and, I suspect,
many forms of invertebrate life, the Woodpigeon feeds a great deal
in trees and seems to do so by preference. It can cling and clamber
among slender twigs with an agility surprising in one of its bulk. When
feeding on growing acorns and berries it will often--when it can
reach no more from branches that will bear its weight--hang head
downwards, bracing itself with outspread wings against the foliage, in
order to reach further supplies. Its arboreal habits tend in one way
to increase its destructiveness since it will settle among and cling to
growing grain, and after harvest prefers to alight on and feed from the
stooks to gleaning from the ground. It is, however, probable that the
damage it does has been somewhat exaggerated. A peculiar " anti-
pigeon " cult has grown up in Britain, and as a result it is considered
by many not quite " comme il faut " even to show an interest in
pigeons, much less suggest that they may not be so black as they are
painted. One of our leading ornithologists is never tired of declaiming
that " A Woodpigeon is not a bird ". " The only beautiful thing

Attitudes adopted by Woodpigeons feeding on acorns or berries when all the easily-
reached ones have been eaten.
In any case it is extremely doubtful if the amount of corn that the
persecuted and black-listed pigeons take from our fields exceeds the
amount given--in the form of bread--to the favoured and legally
protected garden passerines. The latter are therefore just as harmful
to the national economy. It might also be mentioned that at times of
caterpillar abundance, Woodpigeons often feed eagerly on these
larvae.
The Woodpigeon feeds a great deal on greenstuff, taking the buds,
young leaves, and flowers of many trees, as well as leaves of clover
cabbage, dandelion, and other plants. Such foods, perhaps particu-
larly the leaves of cabbage and kale, are relatively low in food value,
and seeds and berries are usually preferred if available. Kale in
particular seems to be a stop-gap if all else fails, and it is usually only
in heavy snow or after a very bad acorn and beechmast crop that
Woodpigeons damage it seriously. Some country Woodpigeons, and
most London ones, rely to a great extent on greenfood even in the

W oodpigeons, when feeding on tree buds, usually have a near empty
crop most of the day, and then eagerly search for bread (and, I think

or evening fill their crops to capacity with the easily obtained but
probably less valuable tree-food. A pair of Woodpigeons that visited

my garden last summer fed first on young cabbage leaves, then
completely stripped three blackcurrant bushes of the ripe fruit, but
did not sample the wheat I put down for them. This suggested that
they had never eaten grain before, and had no strong tendency to
investigate seeds of such size.
In inner London many of the young Woodpigeons get into a
pitiable state of starvation when first cast off by their parents. At
such times their first food seems to be greenstuff taken from the
ground. I have often seen them so weak that they tottered and
stumbled when they moved, yet able to fly up to the shelter of a tree
when alarmed. Young Woodpigeons at this stage do not seem usually
to follow and " copy " adults as do young Feral Pigeons (Goodwin,
1954) or at least not to the same extent. One often sees them by
themselves feeding, both in town and country, even when many
adults are near by and at more productive feeding grounds. Perhaps
the severance of family ties is accompanied by such aggression from
the parents that the young are for some while chary of approaching
adults of their kind ?
Certainly the breeding adult Woodpigeon is territorial and fiercely
aggressive to others of its species. This aggression does not prevent
many pairs from nesting quite near to each other, but as can be seen
in the London parks it causes constant chasing and quarrelling. Often
the birds appear to be trying to drive others away from food, but this
is almost certainly not the primary cause of their anger, as when
not in reproductive condition they do not do this, even though food
may then be scarce. Also, although the aggressive (presumed)
territory owner flies furiously at other Woodpigeons that are trying
to share the food some person is giving them, it ignores the Feral
Pigeons which are meanwhile getting the lion's share of the food.
The very great concentration of Woodpigeons' nests in some conifer
plantations may imply a lessening of aggressive and territorial

The Woodpigeon normally nests in trees, although in towns quite
often on ledges of buildings. Some horizontal, or nearly horizontal
support, preferably also with some support to one or more sides and
well screened by vegetation, is the kind of site typically chosen. EarU
nests are thus most frequently placed in conifers, or other evergreens 7

The advertisement song " of the Woodpigeon is a musical " eoo-
coo, coo-coo, cuk ". Usually the phrase is repeated from two to five
times but usually ends on an abrupt " cuk ". A hurried, jumbled
indistinct version of this is given when bowing in display, and when
nest-calling a deep, strained groaning note, usually disyllabic, is
uttered (Goodwin, 1948c). When bowing in display the Woodpigeon
ill ates its neck increasing the extent of white and green. If perched
or standing still, the bow is accompanied by a raising of the tail, but if
va ing after another bird on the ground, the bowing position is
adopted without tail raising. This latter is probably in origin a
balancing movement, and is usually shown after alighting (see sketch).

then sets them at or somewhat below the horizontal, glides forward
and then somewhat downwards, often to rise and repeat the per-
formance several times before re-alighting. This description sounds
very commonplace, but the writer at least can never see the bird, just
after the wing clap, appear to hang motionless for a second in the air
and then shoot smoothly forward without feeling he has witnessed
" something rich and strange ", frequent though the sight may be.
In low intensity versions no audible wing clap is made.
Young Woodpigeons are easy to hand rear, and if really tame make
delightful birds in a large aviary. If young Woodpigeons are hatched
and reared under domestic pigeons they are said often to die at about
six days old (Heinroth, 1927) due, it is thought, to the hard grain fed
them by their foster parents. I have myself twice so reared broods
of Woodpigeons successfully, but in each case the parents were at full
liberty, and fed largely on wheat, not on the peas and beans usually
(riven. 5 Through a variety of mishaps, and mainly through neglecting
opportunities, I have never had a tame breeding pair of Woodpigeons,
so cannot speak personally of them in this respect. But the species
has often been bred, and hybrids with Domestic Pigeons, and at least,
once with the Stockdove, have been produced. Some Woodpigeons
stay quite well if given liberty. I have lost many that I reared as a
boy, but chiefly, I think, due to my own folly rather than the birds'.
Three that at different times were staying well were all killed by
Sparrow Hawks. In each case the hawk took the Woodpigeon,
although dozens of Domestic Pigeons were in its immediate vicinity.
One bird that was " imprinted " on Domestic Pigeons (Goodwin,
19480), stayed for several years until in the end he met the inevitable
sportsman, the ultimate fate of almost every large or brightly coloured
bird allowed its liberty.
A pleasant little story that I have heard apropos of the tameness
of the London Woodpigeons seems worth repeating here. An old
Scottish keeper who had never travelled far from his home was for
some reason or other--taken by a well-wisher on a visit to the
Metropolis, and shown all the sights. On his return he was asked
what he thought the most wonderful thing in London. Without
hesitation he replied, "To see a Cushat feeding out of a man s hand !
The Stockdove (Columba osnas) is smaller than the Woodpigeon
and most Domestic Pigeons, but larger than the Turtledove. It is
plumper and more compact in outline than the other species. It has
two short inconspicuous black wing bars (sometimes a vestige of a
third) and the blackish ends of its wing quills are conspicuous in flight,
when the slightly paler central area of the wing (see sketch) may appear
almost white in bright sunlight at some distance. On either side of the
neck there is a patch of iridescent green, shot with amethyst, this patch
usually extends more or less round the back of the neck also. The

The irides are dark brown, giving the eyes a melting, gentle expression
that belies their owner's character. The young are duller, with dark
bills and feet, little or no gloss on the neck, and rusty fawn breasts.
Most female Stockdoves are a duller blue-grey than the males, and
often have a dusky tip to the bill and less clearly red feet. The young
in first plumage show a similar sexual difference, and the young cock's
feet and bill start to change colour before his sister's.
The Stockdove is found throughout much of temperate Europe and
Western Asia, and locally in north-west Africa. It is difficult to imagine
what sort of country the Stockdove originally inhabited. Possibly it
was a bird of the forest-edge or of large forest clearings. It has almost
certainly spread as a result of man's activities, and has in the past
century increased its range and numbers in Britain and other parts
of western Europe. Where circumstances permit the adult birds, at
least, are resident, but in some of its breeding haunts it is a spring and
summer visitor. Judging by ringing returns (Witherby, et al., 1940,
Delmee, 1954) the young are more prone to wander, or to migrate.
In Britain the Stockdove seems to thrive wherever a fair amount of
arable cultivation subsists and it can find a hole, preferably in a tree,
cliff, or old building, but at a pinch even in the ground, to nest in.
Parkland with old timber, inland cliffs, and derelict quarries near to
cultivation usually support substantial numbers of breeding Stock-
doves. Feeding is done almost entirely on the ground, usually in open
fields, although the bird will sometimes feed (presumably on fallen
tree seeds) on the ground in woods, and on the roadsides. The Stock-
doves nesting in the Inner London Parks seem to fly right outside
Inner London to feed. I have once or twice seen one or two on the
ground looking for food in early morning, but this seems to be most
unusual, and they do not come down when one feeds the Woodpigeons
and Feral Pigeons in their sight. The Stockdove feeds on seeds,
including those of vetches and many other harmful weeds, grain,
pulse, small snails (probably also other invertebrate life), and green-
stuff, the last not extensively except in time of dearth.
As has been said, the Stockdove prefers to nest in holes, but when
these are not available, it will use the old nests of other species, or even
nest on the ground among thick bushes. Records of Stockdoves
building on branches are doubtless really cases of the bird using old
Woodpigeon nests. Often hardly any nest is built, at other times a
considerable amount of nesting material may be used. The Stockdove
will use dead leaves as well as twigs, roots, etc., for this purpose. Two
white eggs are laid, which take about 16 days to hatch.
The advertisement u song " of the Stockdove is a soft, musical, but
emphatic " Oo-er-oo " with some variation of tone and modulation.
The nest-call is similar. When bowing in display, with inflated neck
and feathers of the green neck-patch erected, it raises and fans its tail

&lt; d utters a very soft droning coo, interspersed with a double click
of the mandibles. The male Stockdove " drives " his mate when she
is about to lay, in exactly the same manner as does C. livia
11 1S east to the extent that several pairs will nest in the
same old budding (see Campbell, 1951), quarry, or belt of trees, if
lore are sufficient nesting holes. Over these latter there are often
fierce and bitter fights. Stockdoves fighting over nest-holes go com-
p etely berserk. I once saw such a fight start between two pairs. For
the first five minutes or so each bird fought both members of the other
pair according to expectations, but thereafter they became so enraged
that each fought whichever of the others was nearest to it, without
discrimination. It seems that once it gets really " worked up " a
fighting Stockdove is no longer capable of individual recognition but
reacts with aggression to the sight of any other of its kind. Often in

hen, but are actually paired. I suspect such incidents result from a
two pair fight, the victors being left fighting each other after the
" vanquished " have departed. That at least was the end of the fight
mentioned above, the only one of which I have been fortunate enough
to witness the actual start of hostilities.
Young Stockdoves are easily reared by hand. They will breed
freely in captivity, but of the two breeding pairs I have kept one were
apt to neglect their young in their eagerness to go to nest again. Most
tame Stockdoves are good stayers when allowed their liberty. As
they will nest in semi-darkness in boxes with a hole for entrance, it is
possible to breed them in the same aviary as such birds as Jays, which
is quite impossible with any branch-nesting species.
The display flight of the Stockdove consists of clapping and then
gliding forward, much in the same manner as the Rock and Domestic
Pigeons do, but less spiritedly. The wing claps are less loud, the wings
do not seem to smite so vigorously or through such a wide arc, and
the gliding is usually less prolonged.
The Rock Pigeon or Rock Dove (Columba livia) is the species from
which all our Domestic and Dovecote Pigeons have originated.
As a wild bird it is found from the Faeroes, Shetlands, Scottish and
Irish coasts and the Atlantic Islands, east through the Mediterranean
regions to Persia and India, and south to Senegambia, the Sudan, and
southern Arabia. The form found in the European parts of its range
is about the size of a Stockdove, or a shade larger, but appreciably
smaller than most Domestic Pigeons. Its general colour is bluish-
grey, palest on the wings which are crossed by two conspicuous black
bars. The rump, or rather the upper part of it, is white, contrasting
strongly in flight with the dark grey upper tail-coverts. The neck

and upper breast are iridescent green and purple, the feet and legs
red or purplish red, the bill blackish, with a white cere, and the irides
orange. The young are duller (see Goodwin, 1954, f* r details). The
other forms of this species differ mainly in size (most are smaller),
proportionate length of bill, and colour. This latter is darkest in
those from India and Ceylon, the Sudan, and west Africa, and palest
in the form found in Dhakla and Kharga oases, whose ground colour
is silvery. The more southerly races--the dark Senegambian one
excepted--have grey instead of white rumps. Occasional chequered

birds occur (see Goodwin, 1954). In the Azores and in China most
of the Rock Pigeons are chequered, but are suspected of having
originated liom Dovecote or Domestic Pigeons. For notes on feeding
and nesting behaviour of this species readers are also referred to my
previous paper.
The Rock Pigeon appears to be primarily a bird of open, relatively
treeless country, with cliffs or rocky escarpments in whose caves it
can roost or nest. In many parts it is a bird of steppe-desert, and this
may perhaps be its original biotope whence it has spread into other
regions following deforestation and opening up of the country by
man. On my first visits to the bird's haunts in north-west Scotland
and the Shetlands, I was immediately struck by the general similarity
in appearance of the landscape--in spite of different temperature,
humidity, and plant species--with that of the Libyan coastal semi-
desert wheie I first saw the bird in a wild state. One wonders if
long ago the Rock Pigeon followed man across the face of the earth,
much as the Collared Dove has done in recent years ?
So far as is known, Rock Pigeons are sedentary. There is, however,
reason to suspect that some movements--perhaps by young birds and
analagous to the dreaded " Fly-away " of the pigeon-fancier--take
place. Fair Isle has been recolonized after the species apparently
became extinct there (Clarke, 1912) and recent observations (Guichard,

Germany can hardly be dismissed as pure imagination and if, as has
been suggested, the birds concerned were Feral or Domestic Pigeons,
then the occurrence was even more surprising.
The voice and displays of the Rock Pigeon do not differ from those
of its domestic descendants, except in so far as some of these latter
may be incapable of normal flight or movement. Those few that
I have heard cooing (in Egypt and Libya only) had a similar musical
rather high-pitched tone to that of most small " dove-headed " breeds
of domestic pigeons, less deep and gruff in tone than those of larger
breeds.
The Rock Pigeon is a bird well worthy of the attentions of the
aviculturist. It is hardy, beautiful, and according to both Macgillivray
( 1 837) and Heinroth (1927), hand-reared specimens can be kept in
the same manner as domestic pigeons. As one would expect they are,
according to Macgillivray, more sensitive than their coarsened
domestic descendants, and if kept short of food (and probably also if
subjected to any distress such as losing a mate, or being severely
frightened) will desert their home and go wild. At one time blue
Domestic or Dovecote Pigeons similar to the wild form were plentiful
but now, at least in England, such birds seem to be nearly, if not quite,
extinct. A few remain in some towns, where the authorities often

D. GOODWIN-NOTES ON EUROPEAN WILD PIGEONS
" protect " them from anyone who wishes to procure two or three
alive for breeding or scientific study, but permit or encourage their
slaughter for profit by professional pigeon-killers. A similar outlook
unfortunately prevails regarding the wild Rock Pigeon, which is black-
listed in Scotland under the new Bird Protection Act, so that the
sportsmen may kill it as much as he likes. Yet when I wished to
procure a single pair of squabs for my behaviour observations, some
bird-protectionists were " horrified " at my depravity.
All the evidence suggests that in Britain at least, and probably
elsewhere, the Rock Pigeon is decreasing. Whether this is due to
alteration of climate and biotope (certainly the depopulation of
St. Kilda appears to have been the cause for the once numerous
Rock Pigeons of that Island becoming extinct), competition with the
Stockdove or other birds, interbreeding with Feral Pigeons, or destruc-
tion by man is uncertain. Probably more than one factor is at work,
and an elucidation of the problem would make an interesting study.
The Rock Pigeon's breeding habits certainly make it particularly
vulnerable to modern man, since although the nests are often in-
accessible, the parents must go in and out of the cave, and then sports-
men sitting at the entrance have them at their mercy--or lack of it.
Probably the Scottish Rock Pigeons, near the northern limit of the
species' range, are more vulnerable to the " extra " predation imposed
by man than are their kind elsewhere. Our latest British bird pro-
tection Act has, deplorably in my opinion, a special clause to legalize
the use of motor boats for Rock Pigeon shooting so that those nesting
in otherwise inaccessible sea-caves shall not escape the sportsman.
Since this method can, or so it was said during debates on the subject,
only be undertaken successfully in summer and late spring, it is
evident that many of the birds shot will have young which will be left
to starve.
The keeping and breeding of Rock Pigeons of pure strain, not only
of the European form, but also other races, would surely be just as
interesting as the perpetuation of the many monstrous Domestic
Pigeons that in their countless thousands are now eating corn that
might be put to better purpose ? The danger of degeneration would
not be great provided photographs, measurements, and notes on
behaviour of the first birds were made in order that any young that
did not come up to their parents in form, colour, or behaviour could
be eliminated from this breeding stock.
From the point of view of beauty, well, compare the photographs
of Rock Pigeons in Heinroth (1926--7) with those of any domestic
breed. I will readily concede that some breeds of Domestic Pigeons--
such as the Ice, the Gimpel, the Archangel--are creatures of great
beauty, but none of them, in my opinion, equal the wild form in this
respect.

The Turtledove (. Streptopelia turtur) is one of the loveliest of its genus
Slightly smaller than the Barbary or Blonde Ringdove {S. risoria), and
slightly larger (in bulk not in length) than the Mourning Dove
{Zcnaidura macroura) its small size and white-patterned tail at once
distinguish it from other British pigeons. Its head is blue-grey, shading
to sepia brown on the back, and pale mauve-pink on the breast. The
wmg-coverts are orange-buff, mottled with black, with some blue-grey
on the outer coverts. On each side of the neck there is a patch of
black, silver tipped feathers, that are erected in display. The primaries
and central tail feathers are dusky. The outer tail feathers are boldly
patterned in dark grey and white, as is the underside of the tail. The
iris is golden, and the eye is set in an area of bare wine-purple skin.
1 are ^ u ^ er J anc * of a general sepia and greyish with tawny-
buu edges to the wing coverts. Many, but not all, hen Turtledoves
aie somewhat duller and paler in colour than cocks.
The Turtledove is a summer visitor to temperate Europe, breeding
commonly in many parts of England, especially in the south-east
It breeds also in northern Africa, the Saharan oases, and east to
Persia and western Turkestan. The Persian form is paler and the
Saharan forms are sandier and with less grey than the European bird
described above. The various forms of the Eastern Turtledove
(o. onentalis) and the dark turtledoves found in parts of Africa south of
the Sahara and in Arabia (S. lugens and S. hypopyrrhus) are considered
by some authorities ( Meinertzhagen , 1954) as all geographical races of
the one species ( S . turtur ).
In Britain the Turtledove likes fairly open woodland, arable country
well supplied with thorn scrub, tall hedges, or copses and especially
lstncts at the stage when agriculture is fighting a slowly losing battle
with gravel extraction, building, and other forms of human " progress "
and woodlands are destroyed and have reburgeoned into scrub. The
Turtledove needs ground that is bare or covered only with sparse
scattered, or very short vegetation, where it can walk about unhindered
in its search for food. This consists principally of seeds, but some
greenfood and, probably, some quiescent forms of animal life are also
taken. Hence most of its feeding is done in fallow or arable fields, on
roadsides, dried-out gravel pits, and similar places. In open wood-
ands it will feed on the fallen seeds of conifers and perhaps also of the
birch, as does the domestic Barbary Dove when at liberty. It often
comes into stockyards and poultry runs to search for scattered grain.
It breeds in small copses, orchards, patches of scrub, tall hedges, and
open woodland. Deep woods are usually shunned, but dense thickets
of thorn, hazel, crab-apple, etc., may have a large breeding popula-
tion. Each nest is then, however, adjacent to an open space or larger
tree that gives the parents ready ingress and exit to the thicket. The
nest is built in a bush or tree, usually from four to twenty feet above

ground. The type of site chosen is very similar--on a smaller scale--
to that described for the Woodpigeon, a horizontal branch of a haw-
thorn or crab-apple bush being a common site. Two white eggs are
laid and hatch in about thirteen days. The young grow even more
quickly than most doves, and can fly when fifteen days old.
The Turtledove has a distinctive purring coo, a sort of " Coorr-
coorr " or " Turr-turr ", a rather different version is used when
calling on the nest site " Coorr-crr-coorr " and when displaying it
utters a hurried emphatic &lt;c Grurr(wa), crurr(wa), crurr(wa) in
time with its quick bobbing bows. It has a short, popping, ex-
plosive cry of anger or excitement that corresponds to the laughing
cry of the Barbary Dove (see Goodwin, 1952), but is less freely used.
In the display flight the bird flies up, claps its wings, and then glides,
rather steeply as a rule, down with tail and wings widely spread.
Hand-reared Turtledoves make delightful birds for a large aviary.
If carefully managed they stay very tame, and even if allowed to lose
their first tameness they do not become distressingly timid. They
breed freely, indeed almost too freely as a fine spell in January or
February may set them nesting, with resultant egg-binding should
the weather turn cold when the hen is about to lay. They should,

therefore, on no account be allowed to nest before April. Hand-
reared birds show no distress at not being allowed to migrate, and
are extremely hardy, but should not be allowed to roost outside in
cold weather. W ild-caught adult birds soon become relatively tame
and steady, and would doubtless breed quite freely under suitable
conditions. I cannot, however, give any personal observations on this
point, as the only wild-caught Turtledoves I have observed were in
Malta and Egypt, and kept under conditions where it was most
unlikely that they would ever come into breeding condition. The
fact that they survived at all speaks volumes for their hardiness.
Still, there is something unpleasant about confining a bird that has
become accustomed to making a long migration, as every adult
Turtledove has. The question is rather academic for British avi-
cultunsts, as the Turtledove is now protected here at all seasons, and
it is illegal to take either eggs, young, or adults. Whilst no one can
cavil at the protection of this harmless and beautiful bird from the
kind of exploitation to which it is elsewhere exposed, yet in view of the
vast numbers of English-bred Turtledoves that are shot in France,
Spain, and Portugal on migration, it is rather vexing that an English-
man interested in keeping and studying pigeons is not allowed even
to take a single pair of squabs for observation and study at close
quarters.
Unlike the Barbary Dove, the Turtledove has a very strongly
developed " homing instinct " and captive birds that escape, even
under the most unfavourable circumstances, almost invariably return
home within a day or so, except during the migration period. As aviary
birds they have one fault. They are very easily alarmed at night, and
if roosting in an open aviary they will then flutter madly against the
wire, injuring themselves and alarming any other birds. I suppose
the fluttering of a bird against wire suggests the wild struggling of a
bird seized by a predator, since it seems to act as a " releaser " to
induce similar panic in other birds. Even the Barbary Dove, which
hardly any amount of other disturbance in the least perturbs, will
often dash madly from its roost and batter against the wire if it hears
this sound. This has nothing to do with wildness or tameness, the
hand-reared Turtledove that flies on to your shoulder and lets itself
be handled freely is just as liable to panic at night as a wild and timid
one. There is only one possible way of dealing with this, unless, like
the proprietors of some Zoological Gardens, you do not mind seeing
your Turtledoves with scalped heads half the time. Each evening
either lure or drive the birds into a shelter to roost or else pick them
up one by one and put them for the night into a pigeon basket or
similar receptacle. Beneath a shelter roof they will seldom get
alarmed, but if they do then the pigeon basket must be used for them.
Turtledoves very soon get used to this procedure--tame ones may be

lifted on the finger to avoid handling them, which soils their plumage
and will breed and behave quite normally when it is carried out.
They must of course be liberated at dawn or near it, not left in the
basket for hours after daylight.
The Collared Dove or Indian Ringdove ( Streptopelia decaocto) has
of recent years caused great excitement in the ornithological world
by its rapid extension of range (see Fisher, 1953). It is now a common
bird in many parts of Germany and Holland, and has occurred once
in Britain, though this bird may have been an escape. In size it is a
little larger than the domestic Barbary Dove, and has a proportion-
ately longer tail than most specimens of the latter. Its colour is a
general pale greyish fawn (not creamy-buff as in the domestic bird),
with blackish primaries and a mauve-pink tinge on head and breast.
It has the same red eyes and black, silver-edged half collar as the
Barbary Dove. The young are duller, with light edgings to the covert
feathers, and have only an obscure dark marking on the sides of the
neck. It has a wide distribution throughout much of Asia, the
Burmese form (see Newman, 1906) being darker and with con-
spicuous yellow skin around the eye. The Rose-grey Dove ( S . roseo-
grisea) which I have discussed before (Goodwin, 1952) in reference
to its almost certainly being the ancestor of the Barbary Dove is
considered by many to be conspecific with S. decaocto. With this
opinion I am inclined to agree, since (see Hofstetter, 1954), the
behaviour of the Collared Dove and the Barbary Dove are virtually
identical, in spite of the difference in sound of their calls. Anyone
visiting the London Zoo where both Collared Doves and Barbary
Doves are confined in the same aviary cannot, I think, help coming to
the conclusion that they are watching birds of the same species.
Taibel (1953)5 considers S. decaocto and S. roseogrisea to be. distinct
species, chiefly because of their difference in voice. The difference
in tail markings (see Hartert, 19^) between S. roseogrisea and
S. decaocto is not constant. I have seen a skin of S. roseogrisea in which
the tail marking is as in the larger bird.
In Europe the Collared Dove is very definitely a symbiote, or
parasite, of man. It frequents gardens, park and scrubland, and towns,
and subsists very largely on grain fed to poultry and other livestock.
Its tameness tends to disarm human annoyance, and so its pilferings .
do not meet with the same disfavour as those of other pigeons. This
immunity from harm by man and his supplying it with food probably
account for the bird's phenomenal success and rapid increase. Possibly
also the recent large-scale killing of sparrows in Germany has helped
it in that country by relieving it of competition for man s bounty.
In addition to grain, it also takes elderberries, seeds of various weeds,
and some greenstuffs. Probably also some forms of invertebrate life,
though these have not been recorded. It nests usually in trees, but

soft and gentle in tone. Some birds caught wild in Egypt (Goodwin,
1947) bred at once in captivity, and it is well known to breed freely
in aviaries in Britain. It is said to stay well when given its liberty, and
no doubt does so until a Tawny Owl finds its roosting place. Anybody
thinking of trying this bird at liberty would, I imagine, be well advised
to catch it up as soon as the leaves fall, and confine it for the winter.
Whilst Laughing Doves are just as easy to hand-rear as any others,
and such hand-reared birds are in every way preferable, still the
objections to using wild-caught specimens are much less with this
than with most other species. Naturally inclined to be tame
they soon become more so, and if properly looked after will at once
settle down in captivity.
Tail Patterns and Display Flights
The markings on the tails of pigeons are worth considering in some
detail, but here I will confine myself to the species dealt with in this
article. The Rock Pigeon's tail is bluish-grey with a broad but ill-
defined black terminal band. The narrow outer webbing of the two
outermost tail feathers is white for the basal two-thirds (approxi-
mately) of their length. The underside of the tail is darker, with the
markings indistinct or virtually absent. The Stockdove s tail is very
similar, but shows an ill-defined narrow bar of slightly paler grey
across the middle. This is almost, if not quite, equally evident on the
underside of the tail, and in life is actually more noticeable from
below if--as is commonly the case--the flying bird is seen against
the light.
Under tail patterns of Turtle Dove, Collared Dove, Woodpigeon. (These are not
to scale.)
In the Woodpigeon's tail we find the light grey central band well
developed on the upper side of the tail (except on the two central
feathers) and conspicuous when the bird spreads its tail in flight.
The underside of the tail however, is even more clearly marked in
very pale and very dark grey, and is most conspicuous when the bird
is viewed from below.
The three Streptopelia species have the uppersides of most of their
tail feathers (the central ones, which alone are visible from above

c 1 or uilding, inclining its flight horizontally or even slightly
downwards. (Domestic Pigeons starting from the ground or a pigeom
ouse roof must often fly upwards to clear immediately surrounding
obstacles, but otherwise they do not do so.) Other Rock Pigeons
near by are therefore likely to see the displaying bird from above or
on a level rather than from below. The above instances suggest that
conspicuous markings on the underside of the tail have probably
evolved m correlation with a display flight in which the bird is usually
seen from below by other members of the species. The white markings

as it is raised. Though I doubt if it is at most more than of minor
importance in this display. #
It would be most interesting in this connection to have an accurate
description of the display flight of as many species of pigeons as
possible Perhaps some of our American readers could tell us it the
Band-tailed Pigeon {Columba fasciatd) and the Mourning . Dove
(Zenaidura macroura) with their striking tail patterns, differ m the
form of their display flights from the Red-billed and White-crowned
Pigeons ( Columba flavirostris and C. leucocephala ) with their unmarked
tails ?
Hand-rearing , imprinting , settling , etc.
No birds are less trouble to hand-rear than young pigeons. In most
species a morning and evening feed are quite sufficient owing to their
large crop capacity. If it is desired to have the birds really tame it
is best to take them as soon as the feathers of back and wings are just
breaking from their sheaths. If they are left till well-fledged--at any
rate in the case of the Woodpigeon and Stockdove they nearly
always become wild and afraid of their keeper as soon as they can
feed themselves. This may not apply to the Laughing Dove, Collared
Dove, and Turtledove, of which I have never hand-reared late-taken
fledglings. It would be interesting to know if the young of the tame
London Woodpigeons would behave differently in this respect from
their country-bred relatives. The latter, if taken when well fledged,
or even if caught after leaving the nest (but before beginning to feed
themselves) soon co-operate in artificial feeding, but in my experience
become timid on reaching independence if taken after about the
tenth or twelfth day. Colquhoun (195 1 ) working with larger numbers
found the same. #
Young pigeons taken prior to fledging may miss parental brooding
at first. One should not therefore try to " copy Nature by dumping
them on a platform of twigs, but construct a snug artificial nest for
them. If they show signs of discomfort through cold covering them
with a loose cloth or putting beside them a slightly older young
Domestic Pigeon may be resorted to. Once they are well feathered
a pigeon-basket with a thick layer of peat moss or similar material
on the floor is ideal. They can see through the slats, and thus get
used to strange sights and people if the basket is often moved about.
They should also be handled, and carried about on the hand, as
much as possible. The more this is done at an early age, the less
nervous of strangers and novel scenes will they be in after life.
Some people find it difficult to feed young pigeons, but nothing is
more easy. Wait till the young bird's crop is empty (but do not let a
young pigeon remain any length of time in this condition) before
starting, as if it is hungry it will be more co-operative. Grasp the

food is put in their mouths. One will of course be easily able to
avoid over-filling the crop, presuming one has some experience of
naturally reared pigeons. After feeding give the bird a drink, and
some five minutes later let it drink again if it will. To do this, hold
its bill as described, and insert it into a cup of warm water (or other
liquid). As soon as it feels liquid over its nostrils the squab will drink
eagerly if thirsty, and withdraw its head if it is not. . -
An alternative method of feeding is to fill one's, mouth with food
and insert the young pigeon's bill between one's lips. This method
is very spectacular in the later stages when the " dear pretty birds
trying to kiss their kind master " can be relied on to send a certain
tvpe of bird-lover fairly into ecstasy. It is, however, in my opinion less
efficient than the way suggested. One is liable to finish with one s
own oesophagus full of soaked peas and the squab's crop full of:human
saliva. Still, I must admit I have met one or two people who could
feed young pigeons quickly and efficiently by way of mouth.
All the species in this article can be reared on soaked wheat and
maple peas (the latter broken up at first for Turtledoves or Laughing
Doves) together with a little bread and milk (wholemeal bread cut
into suitable sized cubes and dipped in milk just prior to feeding),
cooked egg, peanuts (broken up for the smaller doves), and greenfoo ,
not much of the latter except for Woodpigeons. Being now very
vitamin and mineral conscious, I should give a drop or two of halibut
oil every week or so, and a pinch of the minerals sold for Domestic
Pigeons every few days. Also a little grit. But I have in the past
reared them without these extras. Colquhoun (1951) successfully
reared young Woodpigeons on nothing but maple peas and a litt e
milk, and I have known a Stockdove to be reared and kept for eighteen
months (but then it died) on nothing but wheat. This latter bird was,
however, in an outdoor aviary where it could no doubt get some
minerals and so on, from the soil. Once the young are about three
weeks old it will be unnecessary to soak the grain, and one can then
fill one's half-clenched fist with corn and let the squeaker thrust its
bill between thumb and finger, and literally pour the grain into its
mouth. , _
When the young start to feed themselves (for methods of retarding
or hastening this, see my previous paper), it is advisable to get them
accustomed to a wide range of foods. . This will obviate difficulties
later should some grains become unobtainable. It is a very good idea
to start them feeding on soft food, large seeds such as peas and peanuts,
and so on. If they start thus it will be quite easy to get them to
take smaller seeds later, but the converse is not always true.. If t ey
are taught to eat a wide range of foods it will also increase their chances
of survival should they escape and fly away, or have to be cast adn t
owing to war breaking out.

about the same size, for the smaller Turtle and Laughing Doves the
omestic Barbary Dove is better, though many Domestic Pigeons will
rear such small young. It is necessary that the eggs or young ex-
changed are about the same age, as if the young hatch too soon they will
die of malnutrition if the fosterers have no pigeon's milk for them. Young
that have begun to feather may not be readily accepted, though some
cock Domestic Pigeons will feed any young pigeon, be it black, white,
O! piebald, so long as they are in the parental phase of breeding cycle.
lere are two disadvantages in rearing wild pigeons by this
seemingly easy manner Firstly the young seldom show any tameness,
ut m spite of their foster parents' example, become wilder and
wilder, and finally fly away to return no more. At least this has been
he ease with three nest-pairs of Woodpigeons and one of Stockdoves
that I have known to be reared by this method. Perhaps had the
young been handled, fed, and carried about for an hour or so each
day by their owner, things would have been otherwise. At least a
young Speckled Pigeon (Columba g. guinea X C. g. phaenota) which is
now (3rd February 1955) 7 weeks old, seems to have been successfully
tamed by this method, despite the wildness of its parents
The second danger is that the young birds may grow up completely
fixated on the foster species, so that they will not in adult life react
sexually to their own kind. Such birds are of course useless for
reeding, unless one wishes to produce hybrids with the Domestic
lgeon. This imprinting " may occur even if the young are hand-
reared in association with Domestic Pigeons (or any other species)
and m company of another of their own kind, as happened with a
cock Woodpigeon I once had (Goodwin, 194811). Such birds are of
course likely to be good " stayers " provided Domestic Pigeons are
kept. But to provide them with a mate would probably necessitate
imprinting a Domestic Pigeon of the opposite sex on their species.
Most often, however, young brought up with both their own and
another species as companions (having been fed first by their own
parents and then by man) will later react socially to both species
and often to humans as well. They will generally pair most readily
with their own kind, owing to mutual " understanding " of the specific
notes and displays Thus they are quite valid for breeding purposes
or behaviour studies, and a positive reaction to Domestic Pi*eons
or Barbary Doves (supposing one of these to be the other species*thev
are reacting to) is an advantage if they escape, or are to be kept at

life, it is a great advantage to make the young pigeons familiar with
the neighbourhood of their home at an early age by carrying them
about on the hand before they can fly. Young birds are more likely
to stray than old ones,&amp;apos;but they seldom go for good on their first

outing, so that it is a very good idea to let them out a few times at an
early *age. This will obviate the likelihood of their flying so far off
when first liberated that they are unable to find their way back. After
the first few flights it would probably be expedient to keep the bird
confined until it has matured and paired. Much will depend on local
circumstances and the individual bird, and the owner should be best
able to judge when the time is ripe to liberate it. A few very general
suggestions may be given, however, as follows.
(1) The bird should have been able to see all around outside its
enclosure for at least a week prior to liberation.
(2) If it is reacting socially to Domestic Pigeons or Barbary Doves
the owner should have some of these at liberty and accustomed to
feed near the aviary to which (it is hoped) the wild pigeon will return.
(3) Failing the above, or additionally thereto some of the bird's
own species should be in a near-by enclosure and readily visible.
(4) The bird should have been trained to respond to a particular

<bodyText confidence="0.99891488" page_id="58091505"  page_num="Page 82" year="" vol="">
call or whistle for food, and if possible to go voluntarily into a shelter
to roost. This last because birds accustomed to do this--even when
of species like the Woodpigeon and Domestic Fowl that would other-
wise go into a tree--will usually try to come into a building or under
a roof to sleep, which greatly adds both to then safety and their
owner's control over them.
Even if the above council of perfection can be complied with, one
will still have losses. Birds at liberty meet violent ends, and sooner
or later the sportsman's gun, some predatory bird or mammal, or
some vexatious accident will write 4 finis to the cieature that has
given you such interest and enjoyment. But provided one takes all
possible precautions and the bird is fit , one should not feel any moral
qualms against liberating it to a fuller if more hazardous existence.
The above remark does not of course apply to such species of exotic
pigeons--or any other birds--as would be quite unable to survive
if lost for only a few days in our climate and environment. It goes
without saying that anyone who values their birds at all will ring
them with name and address rings whether they intend to liberate
them or not. Such rings cost less than a shilling each, and often prove
of utmost help, as with a Barbary Dove of mine which flew to Ireland
and was subsequently returned safe and sound. There may be reasons
why one hesitates to label as one's own a tame Raven, Eagle, or other
creature liable to pull off one's neighbour's ear or eat his baby, but
there can be no possible reason, other than slackness and incompetence,
for not so ringing pigeons.

Comparison of European and North American Species
North America has more species of wild pigeons than Europe.
Ot these, however, many are found only in some of the southernmost
states of the U.S.A., and are primarily Mexican and Central American
species. I propose here to mention only the species that are (were in
one case) found more widely in the United States and in those areas
that are to some extent comparable to Europe in climate and vegeta-
tion. These are the Band-tailed Pigeon (Columba fasciata), the
Heads and display plumage of Wood Pigeon and Band-tailed Pigeon.
Passenger Pigeon ( Ectopistes migratorius) , and the Mourning Dove
{/^enaidura macroura ).
The Band-tailed Pigeon of western North America shows some
resemblance to our YYoodpigeon. When living birds, or even museum
skins, are compared, however, it will be seen that the two are much
less alike than some coloured plates make them appear. The Band-
tail is smaller, its grey and mauve-pink colours are darker and different
in tone, its yellow legs and black and yellow bill are strikingly unlike
die greyish-mauve legs and yellow-orange bill of the Woodpigeon.
The white and green display markings on the neck are differently
arranged (see sketch) and the glossy green feathers differ in both
stiucture and colour. The Band-tail is certainly more closely related
to most, pei haps, all of the South and Central American species of

Columba (a genus composed of a rather heterogeneous collection of
large or medium-sized pigeons with more or less square-ended tails)
than to any old-world species.
In its feeding habits the Band-tail appears to be very close to the
Woodpigeon, and therefore shows, as would be expected, a similar
ability to cling and clamber in the branches. It seems to have been
less successful at adapting itself to co-existence with modern man, no
doubt because human civilization has burgeoned more rapidly in the
new than in the old world. It is, however, already learning to take
advantage of man's activities, and often feeds largely on cultivated
grains (Glover, 1953). A detailed study of the innate behaviour
patterns--especially those not directly connected with food-getting--
of the American species of Columba would be of utmost importance in
reference to their relationships with each other and with old-world
species.
The extinct Passenger Pigeon appears to have filled the " Wood-
pigeon niche ", or its equivalent, in eastern north America, although
it had developed its adaptation to its environment on rather different
lines to any other species. Chief of these was its extreme gregarious-
ness which enabled it, when nesting, to succeed, in spite of furred and
feathered predators, by sheer weight of numbers (see Scherger, 1955),
but which proved its undoing once civilized man got to work on it.
It ill-becomes us, however, to adopt a " holier than thou " attitude
towards Americans in this matter. That our Woodpigeon has not
shared the same fate as Ectopistes is due to its own greater adaptability
and more solitary nesting habits, not to any lack of greed or cruelty in
ourselves.
The Mourning Dove, now the most abundant and widespread
pigeon in North America, seems to fill a rather similar niche to our
Turtledove. The two are probably, however, not very closely related.
Like the Turtle- and Stockdove in Europe, the Mourning Dove has
almost certainly benefited from agricultural man's activities. Possibly
also the elimination of the Passenger Pigeon enabled it to widen its
niche a little.
One other point of interest may be mentioned. Whereas all the
European species of pigeons lay two eggs, the larger North American
species lay only one. This suggests either their fairly recent derivation
from tropical forms--for many tropical pigeons lay only one egg--or
a poorer food supply. The fact that most frugiverous pigeons lay
only one egg suggests that a fruit diet might not enable the parents to
produce crop-milk sufficient for a brood of two. On the other hand,
the Passenger Pigeon with its relatively rich diet of beechmast, worms,
and so on, laid only one egg. Here, however, it might have been
biologically advantageous to have one young one fledge as quickly as
possible, rather than two taking even a little longer, in view of the

(Calyptorhynchus banksi)
By Kenton G. Lint (Curator of Birds, Zoological Gardens of San
Diego, California, U.S.A.)
The first successful breeding in captivity of this species in the United
States was achieved last year in the Zoological Gardens in San Diego,
when a baby was hatched on the 22nd November, 1954.
The single white egg was laid 25th October, 1954. We recorded an
incubation period of twenty-nine days.
The Red-tailed Black Cockatoo is also known as the Banksian
Cockatoo because of its fondness for banksia scrublands. At one time
these magnificent Cockatoos were found throughout Australia with
the exception of Cape York, and were plentiful even quite close to the
great city of Sydney.
Unfortunately they are fast disappearing due to the lumbering off
of the forests of eucalyptus, Casuarina, and banksia, the seeds of which
form their staple food, and to the fact that thousands have been shot
to be eaten as food.
The Zoological Gardens of San Diego first acquired this species on
21 st June, 1950, through the kindness and generosity of Sir Edward
Hallstrom, Sydney, Australia, who was willing to send us birds raised
in his private aviaries, and who believed we would be able to propagate
this rare species in captivity in the United States.
Red-tailed Black Cockatoos assume their adult plumage in the
fourth year and are very long lived.
In Arthur A. Prestwich's Records of Parrots Bred in Captivity , Part II,
1951, p. 33, the late Marquess of Tavistock is given the credit for the
first breeding of this species. u Mr. Gorman, who had charge of the
famous collection of Parrots and Parrot-like birds belonging to the
Marquess of Tavistock was forced to remove the baby from its nest
and hand-rear it " (A.M., 194*? I 3 ^)* AlanLendon (A.M., 1943 ? i ^ 4 j
describing a visit to Hallstrom, Sydney, Australia, says : &lt;c Successfully
bred by E. Hallstrom in 1943." And Hallstrom, in litt., 8th December,
1948, writes : " I am breeding regularly Black Cockatoos (Banksian) "
(recorded in A.M., 1949? 30 * Alan Lendon (Parrot Records , Adelaide
Zoo Gardens) records that two young ones were successfully reared in
the Adelaide Zoological Gardens in 1945.
The Red-tailed Black Cockatoo is one of the most interesting of all
Australian species of birds. The general colour above and below is
black with a greenish gloss. Many of the feathers have a wavy appear-
ance. The tail, with the exception of the two central feathers, is crossed
by a broad crimson belt or band. The bill is slate-grey in colour. The

(Paroaria cucullata)
By D. H. S. Risdon (Dudley, Worcs., England)
The beginner in foreign bird keeping who wants some showy, hardy
birds could not do better than invest in a pair of Red-crested
Cardinals. They have much to recommend them, being as hard as
nails, beautifully coloured, reasonably priced, and easy to feed and
manage. The only snag about them is that they are not easy to
breed, requiring unlimited supplies of live insects when rearing young.
I think a Red-crested Cardinal could be described as being some-
what smaller than a Starling and slimmer in shape. It is blue-grey
above, snow-white below, with a bright red head and crest.
One of the things I like about this bird is its bold swaggering
demeanour. It is very active and somewhat restless in a cage, although
it will do perfectly well when kept under such conditions, provided
the cage is not less than, say, 3 feet long, to give it plenty of room to
take exercise. However, the Red-crested Cardinal looks its best in
an outdoor aviary, and when this is large enough for it to find a certain
amount of insect life it will be found that its head and crest maintain
a much brighter red than when it is kept indoors.
These Cardinals are difficult to sex, both cocks and hens having
exactly the same colouring and markings. If you are at all observant,
however, you can after a while pick out a true pair. If you watch your
birds carefully when they are not on the alert, it will be found that a
cock keeps his crest lowered and only puts it up when excited, while
a hen seems to keep her crest more or less permanently erect. This is
not an infallible guide, but in practice I have found it a very good
indication as to sex. You need several birds together to be able to
make the comparison. Unless, however, you are intent on trying to
breed Red-crested Cardinals, it does not really matter whether you
have a true pair or two of the same sex, as either way they seem to
agree quite well.
Personally I have never heard a Red-crested Cardinal sing in a
cage, but in a garden aviary it does so quite well, the song having
some pleasant mellow notes reminiscent of that of a Song Thrush.
These birds have a reputation for being destructive to growing
vegetation, but in an aviary of sufficient size their depredations will
not be noticeable. In any case, I think it a mistake to try and plant
small aviaries as the bushes quickly get soiled and nibbled by almost
any birds.
A good seed mixture for Red-crested Cardinals is three parts canary
to one part white millet, with just a trace of sunflower and hemp ; but
do not overdo the latter if the birds are kept in cages, as it is too

a cmng for them. It will be found in practice that they eat far
more canary than millet. Greenfood is eaten in moderation, such as
lettuce dandelion, and duckweed, and seeding grasses are liked, and
I have found that in a mixed aviary along with fruit-eating birds they
vu sample orange and apple as well. Although Cardinals will live
for y ears on a diet of seed and greenfood alone, I am quite sure that
hve insects are good for their health, and they most ceminly improve
their colour If your birds are kept outside in a fair-sized aviary thly
probably find all they need for themselves, but kept indoorl they
should have a regular supply of maggots, mealworms, or any other
insects you can find for them. Maggots can be given ad lib, but meal-
worms should be strictly rationed, as the birds like them so much

,/7 1 Stated above &amp;gt; Red-crested Cardinals are not easy to breed
although there are a number of records. A friend of mine told me
quite recently that he bred a lot of young Cardinals one year but that
most of the young birds died off before they started the autumn moult
n a wild state they build an open cup-shaped nest in a bush, so if you

provided you have no trigger-happy neighbours with guns and your
district is not unduly infested with cats. The technique is to allow
the birds loose when young hatch, and to confine them again to the
aviary when they are due to fledge, otherwise you are liable to lose
the whole family. In this way you will save yourself a great deal of
time and work, as the birds find their own live food and, incidentally,
will probably rear far healthier young.
A pair of Red-crested Cardinals in my garden aviary last spring had
nearly completed a very nice nest in a privet bush when one of them
was picked up dead one morning, and that was that. The nest was
made of fine twigs and lined with dry grass roots.

By The Rev. J. R. Lowe (Coin St. Aldwyns, Glos., England)
Early last May a very rough but healthy specimen of Siphia strophiata
(the Orange Georgetted Flycatcher) arrived at this vicarage. He had
no tail, very few flight feathers, many body feathers missing, but a most
lovely orange-crimson spot under his chin, and a prominent white eye
stripe. His head and back were gun-metal grey, upper breast black,
lower breast and belly dirty white, legs and beak greyish-brown
colour. That was all that there was to see in May.
After two days in a cage to recover from the journey he was put into
a small garden aviary with a good deal of cover and allowed to vegetate
for the summer. The whole demeanour of this bird is robin-like ;
about the size of a stoutish Robin, it has the same bold dark eye, the
flick of the Robin's tail, and that bird's endearing friendliness.
Through the summer the Orange Throat did well, and on enriched
softbill mixture, gentles, and a lot of natural food produced a wonderful
moult, so that by September quite a transformation had occurred.
The tail had the two centre feathers longest, and these from above were
gun-metal grey, the rest of the tail made up of feathers with a white
tip, then a portion of black, and the rest of the feathers white. The
tail when opened in excitement or anger shows up the black and
white, and is slightly fan-shaped. The upper black breast was now
liberally frosted, this being true also of the orange spot, the bird
looking highly polished all over. He is a great one for baths, and
loves a spray each day when he is indoors.
So far the song has been little but good, a very sweet, silvery warble,
reminiscent of Tickle's Blue Flycatcher, sometimes a few guttural
interjections.

will breed at large. Our visitors have been slightly shaken by Barbary
cocks cooing at all hours of the night. The consensus of opinion at first
was that it was owls.
The cock Turtle, having been reared by Barbarys, two months after
leaving the nest displayed slightly to a hen Barbary, but did not coo.
The cock Necklace, though shy with humans, manages all the other
doves.
On 2nd September a young Bullfinch, with no visible means of
support and barely out of its pram, was picked up in the drive. The
vicarage high chair had been out of commission for some ten years,
but the baby was successfully reared and to-day, 29th December, the
house revolves round Bullie. No attempt has been made so far to
change into adult plumage, whether from financial reasons or sheer
ignorance we don't know, but it is difficult to have a Christening if
you don't know the sex of the baby. It spends a great deal of time
sitting on us all, and still sways with its mouth open when spoken
to. It loves sitting with a talking Budgie in his cage, but the Budgie
is never allowed in Bullie's cage, which is really not fair.
Two Tree Sparrows were hand reared in August. While being hand
reared they became delightfully tame, but after becoming self-
supporting, became wild as hawks, and were turned into an aviary.
The cock is now looking very smart and the hen is a slightly paler
edition of her brother. They sleep in a nest-box every night ; it is
hoped they will breed in control.

resting, preening, and digesting. Most feeding is now done in the
early morning and late afternoon. When the mcubation-period is
reached much leisure is again available. Male and female usually
meet now only at the nest, and display virtually ceases. _ When the
young appear, there is a second period of increased activity, mainly
in hunting, which is, however, not nearly so marked as in the pre-
parental stages, and still leaves much time for the traditional resting
and preening.
Swimming , Flying, and Walking
Great Crested Grebes swim well on the surface, but really come
into their element below the water, as I shall outline in the next
section. When moving unhurriedly, they seem to glide effortlessly
along with little or no visible action of head or leg to disturb the
water, and with the neck held vertically. The body lies rather low
in the water, not high like a gull, and the white underparts are usually
invisible. Unless engaged in preening or carrying young, for example,
grebes tuck their wings well away, tightly pressed to the flanks where
thev are covered over by the feathers, and against the back so that
they do not protrude and break the smooth contour. When swimming
quickly, the grebe inclines its neck forward to an angle of about
45 degrees, and may jerk the head a little. The surface-speed is from
o_7 kilometres an hour (Hanzak), that is approximately 1*8-4 *3
miles per hour. However, as Coward (1920). points out, if a grebe
wants to make real speed from place to place it will dive.
Grebes do not fly far once they have settled down on a home water.
Short excursions, low down over the surface are not really infrequent,
especially when birds are attacked by others. In this respect, most
grebe species differ from the divers which spend a good deal of time on
the wing. Great Crested Grebes must periodically fly from water to
water, when migrating or performing weather-movements away from
ice. They are good fliers when fully airborne. Their relatively small
wings give them a high loading which demands a very rapid beat.
According to Meinertzhagen (1955), this is somewhere in the region
of 360-400 beats a minute (over 6 a second), approximately twice
as many as a Mute Swan makes, and over three times as many as the
Heron. In flight, the Great Crested Grebe's pattern and silhouette
are unmistakable : the double white wing-patch is conspicuous, the
legs extend backwards and slightly below the general level of the
body, while at the other end the long neck sticks out with a slight
droop in it.
Because of its small wings, the grebe does not find it easy to take off
from the water. It has to patter some distance over the surface, legs
moving alternately and wings waving, before it gets enough lift to

of following them underwater only when threatened from beyond a
certain critical distance. Thus they fly and skid over the surface,
and do not submerge if attack is imminent at close quarters, especially
from underwater. They do, however, dive away from close approach-
ing surface-bound predators such as gulls and man. Gulls will
sometimes hover above hunting grebes in the hope of snatching a meal.
Whether the latter have fish or not, they usually crash-dive suddenly
if a gull comes too near. One grebe dived in this way when a Heron
flew low over it. The simultaneous disappearance below the water
of a whole grebe family in such circumstances is a striking sight.
When about to dive of its own will, a Great Crested Grebe usually
stops swimming, sinks low in the water so that the neck is often awash,
and depresses the tippits. Then with a forward swing of the neck it
disappears smoothly below. This easylooking action obscures the
power behind the dive. Because, in normal circumstances, there is
no marked surface disturbance, the legs obviously do not kick back
powerfully to play an important part in sending the grebe into the
depths. Most of the initial impetus is obtained by the downward
swing of the head, and probably also by a springing jerk of the body.
This last is obscured because the bird's body lies so low in the water
as the grebe reduces its buoyancy before diving. Sometimes, when
the dive is made from a more buoyant floating or swimming position,
the forward spring can be seen. When a grebe crash-dives in an
emergency, it may then give a strong kick backwards and raise quite
a spurt of water.
With the wing-feathers tightly folded and neck extended, the grebe
is transformed underwater into an elongated, torpedo-like creature of
great efficiency. The legs strike backwards together with force,
maximum push being obtained by the expanded lobes and the
flattened hind edge of the tarsi. Drag is reduced to a minimum in
the forward movement : the toes are pressed together, lobes folded
away, and the keeled front edge of the tarsi cuts through the water
keenly. The length of time spent without surfacing varies and depends
on many factors. The depth of the water itself is unimportant, as
Hanzak points out. Generally, grebes spend less than half a minute
underwater at a stretch, though some dives last nearly a minute.
Hanzak, and Harrisson and Hollom give 24 and 26 seconds respectively
as the average duration of a dive, with ranges of 12--56 seconds. In
some circumstances, Great Crested Grebes can survive underwater
for much longer periods : I once saw a bird held under the surface
for at least three minutes by an aggressive rival, with no apparent
ill-effects.
After emerging from a dive, a grebe may shake its head a few times,
presumably to get rid of water droplets on the bill.
The Great Crested Grebe is essentially a fish-eater, and several

macabre sight of a slowly beating fish-tail protruding from the
wide gape and greatly distended throat. After swallowing slimy
food, the grebe washes its bill. Because its staple diet is so bulky,
the Great Crested Grebe can quite quickly eat its fill. It has no crop,
of course, and fish pass straight to the stomach where they take some
time to digest. Hence the long inactive periods. Hanzak states that
the remains of one or two fish are normally found in the stomach of
shot grebes, and cites the Czech record of one bird found to contain
" one Perea fluviatilis, 12 cm. long, two Acerina cernua of 7 and 8 cm.,
two Lucioperca lucioperca 6 and 9 cm. long."

raising its head, though often it remains dipping and turning on the
spot. Hanzak says that this head-under-water hunting method is used
only on windy days when the surface is rippled. I have seen it on
calm days in summer as well when, I think, the grebes are looking for
small, swimming aquatic invertebrates and also for tiny fish to give
the young. Insects, etc., may be picked up on the surface and,
occasionally, flying gnats snatched from the air, the grebe jumping up
partly out of the water to do so, as first noted by my friend R. W.
Crowe (1951). I once saw a moth taken in this way. When hunting
in very shallow water, the bird may " up-end " rather clumsily, with
only a small part of its rear visible.
Great Crested Grebes drink in the same way as most birds, scooping
up water in the bill and then tipping back the head to allow the liquid
to trickle down the throat. A minor point may be made about such
ordinary actions as drinking and bathing. It might seem unnecessary
for such an aquatic species to have to make deliberate efforts to do
these two things. Yet, it is absolutely essential for grebes not to swallow
water or to get wet except deliberately at selected times.
Feather-eating
T his curious habit of the Great Crested Grebe, which it shares,
apparently, only with other fish-eating grebe species, although well
known, has not been properly understood until quite recently. Smaller
contour-feathers are eaten, usually those that have come out during
preening bouts. Adults will give feathers to their young, sometimes

after deliberately soaking them, and the chicks later learn to eat their
own feathers and to pick up others floating on the water.
Various theories have been suggested to explain this behaviour, but

Resting, Preening, and other Comfort-Movements
r It / S /^ t s ^ rp f lsin S that a species with so much leisure as the Great
Crested Grebe has developed quite a variety of comfort-movements,
many of which have been modified to suit its aquatic way of life.
Resting.
When m the famous " pork-pie " attitude, with its head settled on
its back and bill tucked away at the side of the neck, a resting grebe
transforms itself into a compact bird quite unlike an active one with
long, hosepipe neck. This relaxed position is assumed both in the
water, where the grebe may sometimes swim forward without lifting
its head, and on the nest. In the winter, and also in summer if they
are not attached to a nest-site, the birds rest by day and roost at night
in the open, deeper water. When nesting, they spend much of their
mst-time in or near cover by the platform. A lone grebe, resting near
a likely breeding place, is often an off-duty bird " on station " while
its mate incubates out of sight in the vegetation.
The preening movements do not differ in any&amp;apos;essentials from those
of many other aquatic birds. The Great Crested Grebe has both the
mbbhng and the smoothing (or stropping) bill actions, the former for
carefully dealing with individual feathers, the latter for the more
general treatment of larger tracts. Special care is taken of the white
underparts as previously mentioned (p. 7). The grebe rolls over on
its side in the water, bends its neck round and down, and strops awa V

and common activity is the preening of the upper throat : the grebe
stretches up its neck to the full, tucks its bill down without bending
the neck, and makes rather uncomfortable-looking up and down
preening movements.
Intermittently during preening a grebe will shake its head to detach
feathers, etc., from the bill.
Preening the throat.
While occasionally a bird dips its bill into the water before making
preening movements, usually it squeezes the gland on the base of
the back every now and then to obtain preen-oil. This is distributed
by the bill to the various accessible feather tracts. The head itself
is oiled by rubbing the nape and sides of the face on the gland, and
these in turn may be smoothed against other parts of the body, par-
ticularly the flanks. Often when a grebe is oiling itself, the small
bunch of feathers, which is its apology for a tail, sticks up almost
vertically. Probably this has something to do with the opening of
the gland itself.
It is very significant that two activities connected with preening
--tail elevation, and the shaking of the head are also found in the
head-shaking courtship display. Further, habit-preening . a
ritualized displacement-preening movement in which the bird jerkily
bends its head back and symbolically raises some of the wing feathers,
is a common accompaniment of the display. All this suggests that
the head-shaking courtship is partly derived from functional preening.
This will be discussed more fully in a later section.
In scratching the head the Great Crested Grebe rather reminds
me of a dog as it bends its head down and brings the leg straight up
without lowering the wing. There are several stretching movements.
When performing the familiar simultaneous extension of foot and
wing, the grebe sees to it that the wing does not enter the water. The
wing-gliding movement shows the white secondary patches up con-
spicuously as the wings are held out horizontally over the water, still
or gently waving, perhaps for several seconds at a time before being
flicked to a close. The forward stretching of the neck right out along
the water, with only the head raised, is quite a bizarre sight, while the

powerful use of the feet, and with the body upright, almost vertical
in the water, rear-end fully submerged. The tippits are expanded,
unlike in normal bathing when they are relaxed. The head may stay
still, neck curved, or be stretched down the back doing rubbing, oiling
movements of a particularly rapid kind. I have only rarely seen the
start of this strange performance which no words of mine can describe
convincingly. Three times it has followed aggressive encounters with
other grebes, and twice crash-dives--once definitely after the close
approach of a Black-headed Gull (Larus ridibundus). Once the
behaviour has been initiated, however, no diving occurs , and sometimes
the grebe submerges its head, obviously looking below the surface for
something. All this suggests a type of " escape " bathing, vaguely
resembling that recorded in ducks (Lebret, 1948). The latter, how-
ever, perform the definite actions of escaping from a flying hawk,
though no such enemy is actually present. Lorenz (1954), speaking
generally of this sort of behaviour, emphasizes that the emotion
normally responsible for it is absent in the " play " version. The
behaviour of the Great Crested Grebe seems psychologically different:
I believe that it actually feels afraid in an indefinite way, and has
some underwater predator " in mind ", probably the pike.
Voice
Though not so weird as the wails and moans of the divers on their
breeding pools, the voice of the Great Crested Grebe is certainly
strange to human ears, being chiefly made up of barking, throaty,
and rolling sounds. As would be expected in a species of no great
intelligence, the grebe has a stereotyped vocabulary, each call being
the expression, more or less, of a definite mood. An experienced
observer can thus tell quite easily what a hidden bird is doing by the
sound of its voice. The more important of these calls will be described
in the appropriate sections dealing with the behaviour associated
with them.
Great Crested Grebes are most vocal when in reproductive mood,
their notes then being mainly expressions of hostile, self-assertive or
sexual tendencies. Because it is very specialized for visual display, the
Great Crested Grebe has not a very elaborate vocabulary. On the
other hand, the Dabchick, that relative plain-jane of grebes, partly
makes up in its voice for what it lacks in display structure. I believe
that the " trilling " of Dabchicks, often performed in duet, largely
takes the place of the usual head-shaking display of the bigger bird.

the toast-master brought in a birthday cake blazing with eighty
candles, and the company rendered a somewhat unmusical vocal
birthday refrain.
Dr. D. W. Seth-Smith said he most sincerely thanked the Club for
the honour it had done his father. And, being in reminiscent mood
le went on to say that some of his earliest boyhood recollections were
of aviaries, birds, and their breeding ; and later, of a mysterious
pu ication, the production of which seemed to clutter up most of
the house, and, on certain days of the month, necessitated complete
quiet, as lather was busy with his magazine ".
Mr. Seth-Smith then said how delighted he was to be the recipient
o so many good wishes, and he greatly appreciated the great welcome
the Club had given him. His long association with the Society had
given him much real pleasure. He had watched it grow from its very
modest beginning with little more than a pamphlet of only a few
pages, mto a Society with a world-wide membership and a Magazine
m the forefront of ornithological journals. And, he was delighted to
say, in the whole of its history it had never been in a more flourishing
nVu in J 1 * Sm f i 1 measure due to the eff orts of the members of the
Dlub. He could wish nothing better than that both should eniov
even greater success in the future. &amp;apos;

The speaker for the evening, Sir Philip Manson-Bahr, really needed
no introduction, being one of the Club's favourite guests. Sir Philip
and Lady Manson-Bahr have but recently returned from East Africa
where they visited four of the big Game Reserves. Sir Philip showed
a collection of his paintings, Kodachrome slides, and coloured films
combined to illustrate " African Adventure ", and gave a running
commentary in his own inimitable manner. The most remarkable
part of die showing was a series of surely unique photographs of
Kilimanjaro at sunrise. We were also shown excellent pictures of

hippopotami, and various deer ; also of pelicans, cormorants, ibises,
storks, crowned cranes, bustards, white-headed eagles, peregrine

At the conclusion the large audience showed by its applause, which
without exaggeration could be described as vociferous, that it had
fully appreciated Sir Philip's efforts to instruct and entertain it.
The next meeting of the Club is on 11th May, 1955.

P. W. Teague still manages to hatch and rear a few Gouldians, just
to keep his record intact-since 1926. A really outstanding
nesting record was put up by a pair in the autumn of 1950. They
had three nests in quick succession--in fact the second nest of eggs
was laid in the same nest before the first youngsters had left it. First
nest, 8 eggs, all hatched and reared ; second nest, 8 eggs, again all
hatched and reared ; third nest, another 8 eggs, 7 hatched and reared
but two young died later on. Twenty-one of the 23 young hatched
were fully reared and passed safely through their first moult !

Vogel in Kafig und Voliere (Gage and Aviary Birds). By Dr.
JOACHIN Steinbacher and H. E. Wolters, with the collabora-
tion of numerous other ornithologists. 1st Part : Die Pracht-
finken (Waxbills). In approximately 22 sections. H. Limberg
Aachen, I 954 ~ 55 * Price DM. 2.80 per section.
This is a most valuable work of great interest to aviculturists. A
short description is given of each species, with details of its distribu-
te 011 ' f nd . account of the son g, calls, nesting, and behaviour in
the wdd. This is followed by full information on the bird in captivity
with details of. importations, its reactions to captivity, conditions
necessary to maintain it in good health, food, breeding, etc.
The text is illustrated with black and white drawings of the birds
which are unfortunately not of very high standard, and maps showing
distribution. In addition are coloured plates depicting several species
for instance them is one of the Waxbills of Senegal and another of
those of East Africa. The names of the birds are given in Latin
German, English, French, and Dutch.
. Each Section contains about twelve pages, and it is somewhat
irritating that they sometimes end in the middle of a sentence. So
iar, Sections 1-9 have appeared, and deal with forty-four species.
Dr. Steinbacher is well known to all readers of the Avicultural
Magazine, and all those interested in this group of birds should certainly
take advantage of his wide knowledge and experience, by obtaining
this work. A loose-leaf binder to hold the Sections is issued, and can
be purchased from the publishers, price DM. 3.40.

Sula Island King Parrakeet
At some time between 1930 and 1936, the late Duke of Bedford received a newly-
imported Sula Island King Parrakeet. It was in poor plumage, and as it showed

no sign of improvement, it was given during 1936 to a lady at Merton Park, Surrey.
This bird is still living, and in 1954 it laid an egg. It appears to be in good health
with no sign of senility, but its plumage is still in a poor condition in spite of years
of good treatment and a largely outdoor life during summer.

CORRESPONDENCE
PROFESSOR CARL NAETHER'S ARTICLE : " SOME REFLECTIONS OF
A SOFTBILL ENTHUSIAST"
I do not write this as a condemnation of a great softbill keeper, who I fully realize
</figure>
<bodyText confidence="0.978095333333333" page_id="58091533"  page_num="Page 108" year="" vol="">
is worthy of my respect, and has done much for the softbill fancy in general. On
the whole, I thoroughly enjoyed his article, and certainly learnt a few points from
it, but was extremely disappointed at his attitude towards breeding. To my mind,
the establishing of aviary strains by breeding is the highest attainment possible in
aviculture, and I say this as a keen exhibitor and judge, with an interest in all phases
of aviculture. A casual, disinterested attitude by experienced and respected fanciers
must of necessity do harm by discouraging others of less experience from trying
their hand at achieving results as breeders. I feel deeply on this subject as practically
all the few foreign softbills left in Australia are the result of one fancier's efforts; the
same interest by other fanciers who had breeding pairs would have meant a far
larger and varied foreign softbill population than there now is in Australia.
Fanciers everywhere must realize an import ban or misguided protection bill could
easily put them in a similar position. It is up to all keepers of softbills to try to
breed them, and for all who have done so to place their experiences in the hands
of the Editor. Then others like myself, who are keen to become successful breeders,
can use their experiences as guidance and this will also encourage others to try
their hand at breeding, when I'm sure they will find the most pleasing song of all
comes from a nest of lusty young calling for food.

B\ David Seth-Smith (Guildford, Surrey, England)
The various foreign pigeons and doves are not, perhaps, amongst
the mos popular of aviary birds, but they are certainly very attractive
and, although not so gaudy in plumage as some of the aviculturist's
favourites, are by no means lacking in beauty. For my part, I was
always very attracted by some of the Australian species, especially
those belonging to the group known as the Bronzewings, a name
derived from the patch of lustrous, iridescent feathers carried to a
greater or lesser extent, on the wings of all of them. In none is this
more pronounced than in the so-called Common Bronzewing (Phabs
chalcoptera ), call it pigeon or dove as you please, which is the largest
and to be found in almost all parts of the Australian continent'
inhabiting mostly the scrub country.
Although the chief colour of this bird is brownish-grey, the forehead
of the male is buff, the breast pinkish, and the secondaries and wing-
coverts glistening bronze, changing in varying lights to purple, green
and coppery red. When viewing a cock Bronzewing as it reposes on
the ground in brilliant sunlight, one is struck by its dazzling beauty.
I he sexes are easily distinguished as the hen is not so brightly coloured
.is species, which is about the size of a common pigeon, does well
m * n ^door aviary so long as it has adequate shelter from the winter
cold. The nest, composed of a few small twigs or bents, is built at no
great distance from the ground, and there are generally two pairs of
young reared in a season. All the Bronzewings feed chiefly or entirely
upon the ground, upon various small seeds. In captivity they eat
canary, millet, wheat, and dari, and I have seen a Common Bronze-
wing devouring with gusto a large earthworm, which shows that
a certain amount of animal food is sometimes taken.
The Brush Bronzewing (Phaps elegans) is somewhat smaller than the
last-named, and less widely distributed in the wild state, being more
or less confined to the southern parts of Australia and Tasmania.

I 12 D. SETH-SMITH-THE BRONZE WING DOVES OF AUSTRALIA
recognizing their notes when the birds themselves were not visible.
The smaller species has a good deal of chestnut in its coloration, and
the sexes of the adult birds are easily distinguishable by the hen being
the duller of the two. It is a delightful aviary bird, tame and gentle
in disposition. The first I had, now many years ago, were received
during the winter months, but went to nest at once in a moderately
warmed aviary, building the usual frail type of pigeon's nest on some
brushwood about five feet from the ground. The first pair of young
were somewhat weakly, a common fault with winter-reared birds, but
later broods in the spring and summer were quite a success. As is
common to the pigeon tribe, the cock bird did most of the sitting and
brooding during the daytime, the hen taking over at night.
The Crested Bronzewing, Crested Dove, or Crested Pigeon
(Ocyphaps lophotes), is another very attractive species of elegant shape
and form, its beauty enhanced by its upstanding crest and rather long
tail. It is slightly smaller than those already mentioned, mostly grey
in colour, with the usual iridescent colours on the wings and blackish
bars on the smaller wing-coverts. I found Crested Doves very
attractive aviary birds, breeding freely and producing two or three
couples of young in the year. Their only drawback is that the sexes
are so very much alike that it is not easy to be sure of a true pair,
though the cock is perhaps slightly the larger.
All of the Bronzewings have a very rapid flight, but I think the
Crested would beat any of the others in a speed contest, and the flight
is accompanied by a distinctive whistling sound. As the bird perches
on a branch it bows its body forward and throws up its tail in a very
engaging gesture.
Before the first world war Crested Doves were kept at liberty by
the Duke of Bedford, at Woburn Park, where they thrived and
multiplied, but I fear they entirely died out during the war, no doubt
owing to the attention of hawks and owls in the absence of keepers.
We once tried to establish them at liberty in the London Zoo, several
members of the Avicultural Society forming a committee to raise
funds for their purchase. The Duke of Bedford, grandfather of the
present Duke, took a great interest in the scheme, and presented us
with ten pairs, and we were able to collect in all about twice that
number, as well as a few of other species of doves. They were for the
time being kept in the pheasantry near the present Bird House ; the
first lot liberated on the ist May, 1907, and the remainder a week or
so later. They remained very happily in the Gardens, where they
were regularly fed, becoming very tame and greatly admired, and the
first summer many of them nested in the trees, some taking up their
abode in the Botanical Gardens. I spent the winter in Australia,
and on my return the following summer found the number of Doves
had been sadly reduced. The opinion of the keepers was that they

Another species that I always hoped, but was unable, to obtain
was the Harlequin Bronzewing or Flock Pigeon (Histriophaps histrionica ),
which is one of the most brilliantly coloured of the Bronzewings, and
at one time was to be met with in immense flocks in the hotter parts
of Northern and Central Australia. Its habits are somewhat akin
to those of Sandgrouse, but from all accounts, since the introduction
of sheep-farming, the species has become scarce. I have never seen a
ivmg example, but perhaps some of our Australian members may
tave kept it, and be able to let us know about it as an aviary bird.

or three races. Probably the only one that has been imported is
L. leucogaster , the White-bellied Plumed Ground Dove, a bird of the
hot desert country of Northern and Central Australia. Plump and
quail-like in shape, its head carries an upstanding crest, its eyes are
surrounded by a large patch of bare red skm, bounded above and
below by a line of black. The prevailing colour of the plumage, is
reddish sand-colour, relieved by bars of black and grey, a pure white
abdomen and band across the chest, while the wings are decorated
with iridescent purple-bronze.
This is a lovely little dove, a pair of which I regarded as one of the
greatest prizes in my aviary. They were very tame and the cock
would bow and coo to the hen close to my feet. She made a nest of
a few pieces of dry grass beneath a tuft of grass, and laid two white
eggs, but declined to sit properly. The English climate is, no doubt,
too damp for these birds, which delight in the hot sun and desert-like
conditions of their native land ; but no birds were more charming
while they lived with me.

By Evelyn Wicks (St. Leonards-on-Sea, Sussex, England)
Some fifteen years ago I bought a pair each of Mandarins and
Carolinas. These adult birds were never friendly, and always remained
shy and extremely nervous and eventually escaped.
Two years ago I decided to start from scratch, and after great
difficulty procured some eggs, which duly hatched out. I opened the
incubator to remove the ducklings, and had my first surprise. The
Carolina ducklings jumped fully 3 feet, and continued jumping these
long distances, until I managed to gather them up. The Mandarins
stayed quite quietly in the drawer. I placed the ducklings in quite a
small container, heated with a Putnam lamp, and also gave them a
small wire run, water to drink, grit, and food. After twenty-four
hours, I placed a shallow container about 2 inches deep and 15 inches
diameter, for them to bath in, and they loved it, but quickly returned
to the warmth of the heater, between baths. I had to increase the
size of the water bath frequently as the birds grew. They had long,
very fluffy tails, and I was interested to note that as the tails grew into
quills the fluff remained at the tip of the quills until they were fully
grown, and then dropped off.

Always the Mandarins were friendly and extremely curious of
everything going on, but the Carolinas remained timid. As the birds
grew&amp;apos;, I needed more space and made a small cement pond about
o eet by 3 feet, very shallow at one end for easy exit. I placed 2-foot
wire netting around a space some 42 feet long by 14 feet wide (but they
could well do with less space). All went well until one day a cat
sat outside the wire watching them, and they became frantic, dashing
against the opposite side, endeavouring to escape, and causing their
beaks to bleed. I now decided to cover in the pen completely with
6-foot half-inch wire netting at the side, and also a two-inch netting
overhead. The extreme intelligence of these little birds was immediately
apparent. The next time the cat appeared they ignored her. This
I think, is truly amazing, and it does seem incredible that they could
reaize their secure position, when the security was only man-made.
had a small shelter in the pen, and shut the ducks in at night.
However, as soon as they grew their flights and could fly, they refused
to be shut up any longer. Whenever I sat in the pen watching them,
they would nibble at my shoelaces and were quite friendly.
The next stage was when the drakes assumed their glorious winter
plumage. The Mandarins were intensely proud ; so much so that
they now jumped on to my lap and it was a delight to have three
Mandarins puffing out their chests in such pride and vanity, at such
close quarters and to be able to examine them so minutely. Sometimes
two would fly on my shoulders and proceed to battle across
my lace. In their battles they never hurt each other, and the only
way they seem to be able to do any real harm is on the water. I once
rescued the Carolina drake from being drowned by three Mandarin
drakes, but that s another story in itself, which I will later tell at length.
One little Carolina duck has been most friendly, perhaps because
o my persistance. I did love her so, and always picked her up from the
day she was hatched. She got more or less used to it ; at least to the
extent that if she decided I might fondle her, she perched in a par-
ticular place on an old tree stump, and called out with a special
note, which she keeps only for me. It's loud and full. I could then
pick her up, and she would run her beak through my hair most
affectionately. I could not pick her up from any other place.
s soon as the birds were in full plumage they paired ofT. Two
landarm drakes chose two Mandarin ducks (or was it vice versa ?),
and the third Mandarin drake (whom 1 will call " No. 3 ") decided
he wanted the Carolina duck, and then the fun, or should I say
troubJe, started. The Carolina drake wanted his legitimate mate,
and so the three birds were always together, the two drakes always
ic ering e odd Mandarin duck was quite prepared to mate with
the Carolina drake, but he just did not want her. The two correctly
paired Mandarin drakes were on the side of law and order, and

I 16 E. WICKS-DISPOSITIONS OF MANDARIN AND CAROLINA DUCKS
refused to allow the oddly matched pair to get on to the water,
although they did manage to get the pond to themselves when the
rest of the birds were out preening, and mating took place.
This state of affairs persisted for nearly two months, when the
Carolina drake at last decided to put up with second best and mate
with the Mandarin duck. Now fresh trouble occurred. The two
respectable Mandarin drakes were as much opposed to this odd match
as to the other one. They turned against the Carolina drake (with
whom they had always been most friendly) and decided to drown
him, " No. 3 " helping. When I rescued him, he was quite exhausted,
and* I held him for about ten minutes before he recovered.
It was at this period that I discovered something most interesting,
and something I had not noticed before, although I have been a
life-long bird lover. The Carolina drake was now nervous of getting
on the water and, in fact, the three Mandarins would not allow him
on. I therefore stood at the water's edge, kept the Mandarins off, and
allowed the Carolina to get his fair share. My discovery was, that if
you looked directly at the bird you were talking to, he knew, and also
all the other birds knew. This led to a new joy in my birds. " No. 3 "
is a great pet, and will nearly always fly to my shoulder when I enter
the pen, and if I put my hand up, will step daintily on to it. Some-
times, if he felt like it, he would ignore me, and then I would look
directly at his rival, the Carolina drake, talking affectionately to him.
Immediately 44 No. 3 ,5 would fly to my shoulder, pecking at me in
great fury, and puffing out his chest in great indignation, whereupon
I could not help laughing, and this only added to his fury.
Mandarins are not fertile in their first year, and the ducks usually
lay only one infertile egg. The Carolina duck laid three clutches of
eggs (thirty in all). These were all infertile owing to the immaturity
of the Mandarin drake (" No. 3 ") who mated her. When the duck
was on the nest, 44 No. 3 " would rush the length of the pen, attacking
me with great fury.
The last stage is the only one that is not agreeable. The drakes
started to lose their fine feathers, and looked ragged and miserable.
They were no longer friendly, but moped as all moulting birds do.
However, this did not last long, and soon the new feathers arrived,
which are much the same colour as those of the ducks 5 but quite
quickly one can see the colour starting to come back, and the day the
first Mandarin flew to my shoulder once again, was another red letter
day.
Once again the 44 Eternal Triangle " has appeared, and I am now
waiting to see which drake wins the affections of the Carolina duck
this year. I don't think she minds much either way, if only the
drakes could settle their dispute. If she is too nice to the Carolina

By Alan Lendon (Adelaide, S. Australia)
Ill the course of a trip around the world, extending from August
to December, 1953, I was privileged to see many collections, both
public and private, and I felt that a record of the various parrot-like
birds that I saw would not only be of interest, but might assist members
in the mating up of rarities. My records of Australian species
especially the more common ones, are relatively sketchy, as they
naturally did not impress themselves on my mind as much as
unfamiliar ones did.
Keas (Nestor notabihs) were seen in several collections, but I was
disappointed not to see a Kaka (jV. meridionalis) anywhere, as it is
a bnd that I have never seen in life.
I saw many Lories that were new to me, some of them most
&quot;T The , Str D an f Black Lor y ( Chalcopsitta ater) was on exhibition
at both Regent s Park and Wassenaar, whilst of the genus Eos, both
the Ceram (E. semdarvata) and Wallace's (E. squamata) were in the
Rotterdam Zoo the Violet-necked (E. variegata) and the Red (E
bornea) were at Wassenaar, whilst David West, jr., and Rayson Brown
also had the last-named in Los Angeles. Rayson Brown also had
several of the very unusual-looking White-rumped Lories ( E.fuscata ),
ail ^r\ eSt ' Jr ' a S * laC t le Black-winged (E. cyanogenia).
fLp he i SenUS Do , m l c * lla ' the Black-capped (D.lory) was at Rotterdam
the Purple-capped (D. domicella), the Chattering (D. garrula), and the
Yellow-backed {D. flavo-palliatus) at Wassenaar, and R. C. T. Sawyer
also had a nice pair of the last-named.
Turning to the Lorikeets, the two common Australian species, the
Kambow ( Tnchoglossus moluccanus ) and the Red-collared (T rubri-
torquis) were at Wassenaar, as well as at many other places, 'other
members of the same genus noticed were the Blue-faced (T. haematodus),
oisten s ( T. for stem) , and the Ornate (T. ornatus), all at Wassenaar,
nd the last-mentioned was seen by me for the first time in a Singapore
dealers possession. Karl Plath had the delightful little Goldie's
Lorikeet (Glossopsitta goldiei) breeding at the Brookfield Zoo, Chicago
and the Scaly-breasted (. Eutelipsitta chlorolepidota) was noted
Yvassenaar and elsewhere.
The only long-tailed Lories seen were both colour phases of Stella's

I 1 8 ALAN LENDON-PSITTACINES THE WORLD OVER
(Charmosyna stellae) in Taronga Park Zoo, Sydney, and Sir Edward
Hallstrom had several Musschenbroek's ( Neopsittacus musschenbroekii)
and a single Alpine Lorikeet (jV. pullicauda). Rayson Brown had
several remarkable looking birds which I judged to be hybrids between
the Violet-necked (E. variegata) and the Rainbow (T. moluccanus).
The only Fig Parrots seen were at Sir Edward Hallstrom's, where
there were a large number of the Double-eyed ( Opopsitta diophthalma ),
and a few Edwards' ( 0 . edwardsii).
Of the Macaws, the Hyacinthine ( Arodorhynchus hyacinthinus) was
fairly common, Edinburgh Zoo having four particularly fine specimens.
The only Glaucous ( A . glaucus) that I saw were three in the Antwerp
Zoo and one at Wassenaar, while R. C. J. Sawyer's Lear's (A. leari )
was the only one seen in Europe, although three were exhibited in the
Brookfield Zoo. Spix's Macaw ( Cyanopsitta spixii) was represented by
a very elderly bird at Regent's Park, a lovely specimen in the Antwerp
Zoo, and two shockingly plucked birds in the Boston Zoo. Blue and
Yellow Macaws (. Ara ararauna ) were common, and Rayson Brown had
a breeding pair ; Scarlets (A. macao ) and Maroons [A. chloroptera)
were also well distributed, Rayson Brown also having a breeding
pair of the latter. The Military [A. militaris ) was also fairly plentiful,
and I saw the Severe (A. sever a) for the first time on the Continent, it
being represented in the collections at Antwerp, Rotterdam, and
Wassenaar. Illiger's (A. maracana) was at Wassenaar, and the bird at
Antwerp that I took to be this species, was said not to be so, and was
presumably therefore Coulon's (A. couloni). E. N. T. Vane's Noble
Macaws ( Diopsitta nobilis ) were a new species to me, and their progeny
were to be seen in several other English collections.
The Conures were, in many instances, new to me, and provided
many headaches in regard to identification. The Red-masked (Ara-
tinga rubrolarvata) was only seen at Regent's Park, and big green ones
with red flecks were called Gundlach's in Antwerp, Green-shouldered
at Wassenaar, and Mona Island by Rayson Brown and if, as I think,
they were all the same species, they were probably Mauge's (A. maugei).
A similarly marked, smaller bird was also labelled Green-shouldered
by Wassenaar (whose identifications were frequently faulty), and
I regarded it as the Cuban ( A . euops ). A. A. Prestwich and Wassenaar
both had the Cactus (. A . cactorum). The Blue-crowned ( Thectocercus
haemorrhous ) were in Regent's Park and Antwerp Zoos, and in Sir Edward
Hallstrom's collection, and Rayson Brown was breeding them under
the impression that they were Noble Macaws.
Queen of Bavaria's Conures ( Eupsittula guarouba ) were commoner
than I had expected, Mrs. Clark of Bromsgrove having bred several, I
think. The attractive Yellow-headed (E. jendaya ) was very plentiful
in England, was also at Wassenaar and Antwerp, and was being bred
by Rayson Brown in Los Angeles, and the even nicer Golden-headed

(E. auricapillus ) of which I am unable to discover an adequate coloured
plate, was represented by four specimens in Antwerp and two more at
W assenaar.
The true St. Thomas (E. pertinax) was represented by a single bird
at Brookfield, and Karl Plath believes it to be very rare, whilst the
buds thought at that time by Regent's Park and A. A. Prestwich to be
the St. Ihomas were, I feel sure, the Yellow-cheeked (E. chiysophtys ).
The Brown-throated (E. aeruginosas) was in the Wassenaar collection
and at the San Diego Zoo, and I think Mrs. Clark may have had them
also; Rayson Brown had Petz's (E. canicularis) and was breeding the
Golden-crowned (E. aureus) ; there was a solitary Aztec (E. as tec)

were not very uncommon, being at Regent's Park and Rotterdam
and m Rayson Brown's collection, whilst the Patagonian Conures
which I saw at Whipsnade, Alfred Ezra's, and Wassenaar (where they
were labelled Rock Parrakeet-- Neophema petrophila /) were, I think,
the Lesser (Cyanoliseus patagonus) as opposed to the Greater (C. byroni )
of whtch Sir Edward Hallstrom had two. Sir Edward also had a
single Slight-billed Parrot ( Enicognathus leptorhynchus), and several
Chilian Conures (. Microsittace ferruginea), neither of which I saw
elsewhere.
Of the attractive genus Pyrrhura, there were three of the very
lovely Red-eared (P. cruentata) at Wassenaar, where there was also
a single specimen of the delightful little Crimson-bellied (P. rhodogastra).
t&amp;gt;j i .A Prestwich and Sir Edward Hallstrom were breeding the
Red-bellied (P. vittata), which E. N. T. Vane also had. The White-
eared ( p. leucotis ) Vane also had, as did Antwerp and Wassenaar, and
it was being bred by Rayson Brown. Wassenaar also exhibited what
they called the Brown-eared, which I think was Lucian's (P. lucianii ).
bhiaker Parrots ( Myiopsitta monacha ) were not uncommon, and
Wassenaar had one and J. Bruyneel of Regie, near Brussels, two of an
attractive blue mutation. Lineolated Parrakeets {Bolborhynchus
lineolatus) were at W assenaar, were later bred by A. A. Prestwich and
were also being bred by Rayson Brown.

of which I was unfamiliar and of some of the identifications of
which I felt suspicious. There was a lovely pair of Vinaceous ( Amazona
vinacea) in Boston, and another in the Bronx ; the large Guatemalan
(A. guatemalae) was at San Diego and the Mealy (. A.farinosa ) was seen
at Bellevue, Rotterdam, Antwerp, and San Diego. The Orange-
winged (A. amazonica) was at Regent's Park and Clifton ; the Blue-
fronted was plentiful and included the Duke of Bedford's aged and
nearly blind lutino ; the Yellow-shouldered (A. ochroptera) was at
Clifton ; the Yellow-headed (A. ochrocephala) at Regent's Park and
Keston and the Yellow-naped [A. auropalliata ) also at Regent's Park.
Levaillant's (A. levaillantii) was noted at Boston and Regent's Park,
the rare Dufresne's ( A. dufresniana ) only at Clifton, and the variously
designated Red-crowned, Red-fronted, or Red-topped (. A . rhodo-
corytha) was at Regent's Park, Antwerp, Wassenaar, Edinburgh, and
Rayson Brown's. Green-cheeked (A. viridigena ) were seen at Bellevue
and Brookfield ; Finsch's {A. Jins chi) in San Diego ; Yellow-cheeked
(A. autumnalis) at E. N. T. Vane's and Regent's Park, where there
was also the closely related Salvin's (A. salvini). Festives [A. festiva )
were at Regent's Park, Clifton, and Antwerp ; two pairs of the very
attractive White-browed (A. albifrons) were in Rayson Brown's
collection, and the rare Salle's (A. centralis) was at Regent's Park.
Sir Edward Hallstrom had Cubans {A. leucocephala) , as also did Keston
and Boston, and Regent's Park had both the Red-throated (A. collaria)
and the Active {A. agilis), and Rayson Brown also had the latter.
I found the genus Pionus an attractive one. Sir Edward Hallstrom
had a Red-vented (P. menstruus ), and this species was also in the
Clifton, Antwerp, and San Diego Zoos. The nice Little Dusky or
Violet (. P.fuscus ) was at Regent's Park and Clifton, and A. A. Prestwich
and Antwerp had Maximilian's (P. maximiliani) . The closely allied
Hawk-headed Parrot ( Deroptyus accipitrinus) was at Regent's Park,
Edinburgh, Antwerp, Wassenaar, and R. C. J. Sawyer's. A single
rather decrepit Red-capped ( Pionopsitla pileata) was in the Antwerp
Zoo, and A. A. Prestwich had White-bellied Caiques ( Pionites
leucogaster ).
Dealing next with the African parrots of the genus Poicephalus,
J. Bruyneel had Jardine's (P. gulielmi ), and A. A. Prestwich had
the Brown-headed (P. fuscicapillus) . Senegals (P. senegalus) and the
closely-allied Orange-bellied (P. versteri) were also in A. A. Prestwich's
collection and at Regent's Park. The only Meyer's (P. meyeri ) noticed
were at Sir Edward Hallstrom's, and A. A. Prestwich's collection.
Grey Parrots ( Psittacus erithacus) were numerous everywhere, and I
was delighted to see specimens of the Timneh (P. timneh) at Antwerp,
Regent's Park, and in Wilfred Frost's possession. The only Coracopsis
that I saw was an example of the Lesser Vasa (C. nigra) at Sir Edward
Hallstrom's. Examples of the extraordinary Pesquet's Parrot

{Psittnchaspesqueti) were to be seen at Taronga Park and at Wassenaar
A fair number of Red-sided Eclectus (E. pecioralis) and a few Grand
\b. roratus) were seen.
The p nUS Psittacula was widely spread. Alexandrine Parrakeets
[P. mpalensis) were not very numerous, the almost pure-bred yellow
at keston was very striking. Ring-necked Parrakeets (P. torquata)
were ubiquitous and yellows were well distributed, whilst the only
blues were those ol the Duke of Bedford and David West, jr. The only
ncan Ringneck (P. krameri) that I saw was a cock at Regent's Park.
Blossom-heads (P. cyanocephala ) must have been imported into England
in large numbers during the brief lifting of the parrot ban, as they
were in most English collections, and both the Duke of Bedford and
keston had yellow cocks ; Rayson Brown had the only Plum-heads
{P. rosa) that I saw. The only Layard's (P. calthropae) were a few
immatures at keston, and the Duke of Bedford had a solitary hen
Malabar (P. pensterodes) . I saw only two Derbyans (P. derby and)
both cocks, in England ; they were at Regent's Park and at
Mrs. Clarks; however, Rayson Brown had five in Los Angeles
and they were breeding. I saw E. N. T. Vane's Moustache Parrakeets
(P. fasciata) with their recently fledged young one, and there were
a lew at Wassenaar ; the only Javan (P. alexandri) was at Regent's
Park It was quite a thrill to see my first Long-tailed Parrakeet
[P. longicauda ) at the Bellevue Zoo, Manchester.
Banabands Parrakeet ( Polytelis swainsonii) was plentiful in UK
but few were seen in U.S.A. ; Rock Pebblers (P. anthopeplus) did not
seem numerous anywhere, whilst Queen Alexandra's ( P . alexandrae )
were widely represented. I did not notice many Australian Kings
(Aprosmictus cyanofiygius) , but Alfred Ezra had several New Guinea
Kings (A. chloropterus) , and Regent's Park had a pair. Australian
Crimson-wings were widespread, but I only saw three, all cocks, of
the iimor species (A. jonqutllaceus) , two at Regent's Park, and one at
Manchester.
As regards Lovebirds, A. A. Prestwich had a large number of Red-
laced (. Agapomis pullarid) and six Abyssinian (A. taranta ), and
Rotterdam had at least forty of the latter species. I did not keep
particular note of the five formerly free-breeding species, but I formed
the opnnon that at least two of them were now quite uncommon, and
id not see a Madagascar (A. cana) anywhere. The blue mutation
of the Masked [A. per sonata) was fairly plentiful in U.R., and numerous
in L.b.A. ; I saw only a few yellow Nyasas (A. lilianae) and David
West semor, had a blue Fischer's (A. fischeri). Hanging Parrots
(C oryllis) I found impossible to identify ; there was one at Wassenaar
and two at Chessington.
A *A f R " ellas &amp;gt; the Crimson ( Plalycercus elegans) was plentiful, and
A. A. 1 restwich had a pair with newly-fledged young in semi-mature

(red) plumage. Only a few Adelaides (P. adelaidae) were seen, and the
only Yellows (P.flaveolus) were at Wassenaar, and those of D. West, jr.
Green Rosellas (P. caledonicus) were seen only at Regent's Park and at
Wassenaar. Pale-headed (P. adscitus ) were common both in Europe
and in America, as were Eastern (P. eximius) and Golden-mantled
(P. splendidus). I saw a few Northern Rosellas (P. venustus ) both in
Europe and in the States, whilst Western (P. icterotis) seemed very
plentiful in England, and relatively rare in U.S.A.
The Pileated Parrakeet ( Purpureicephalus spurius ) was surprisingly
common in England and rare in America. Of the Ringnecks ( Bar -
nardius ), the Mallee (B. barnardi ) was more plentiful in U.S.A. than
in Europe, and the only Cloncurry Ringnecks ( B . macgillivrayi ) seen
were at Sir Edward Hallstrom's. Twenty-eights (B. semitorquatus)
were only seen at Wassenaar and San Diego and Port Lincolns,
(B. zonarius ) were also quite scarce ; I thought one bird in the Parrot
House at Regent's Park was probably the north-western form of the
latter (B. occidentalis).
As regards Blue-bonnets, I noticed the Yellow-vented ( Psephotus
xanthorrhous) at E. N. T. Vane's, J. Bruyneel's, and at several places
in U.S.A., while the only Red-vented ( Ps . haematorrhous ) was at San
Diego, and the Duke of Bedford had two hens of the rare Little
(Ps. narethae). Extremely few Hoodeds (Ps. dissimilis ) were seen,
I remember noticing a cock at Wassenaar, but both Many-colours
(Ps. varius) and Red-rumps (Ps. haematonotus) were common, especially
in Europe. I did not see as many yellow Red-rumps as I had
anticipated.
Turning now to the Grass Parrakeets, Bourkes (Neophema bourkii)
were common everywhere, as also were Elegants ( JV. elegans) . The only
pair of Blue-winged (JV. chrysostoma) that I saw were in Mrs. Clark's
collection at Bromsgrove, and there was a solitary Rock (JV. petrophila)
at Wassenaar. Turquoisines (JV. pulchella) surprised me by their
abundance, and were breeding at Wassenaar, and Splendids
(JV. splendida) were fairly numerous in U.S.A. and increasing in U.K.
A solitary Swift Parrot (Lathamus discolor) was seen at Wassenaar,
and Budgerigars (Melopsittacus undulatus) were ubiquitous, with their
mutations becoming progressively less attractive, at any rate to my
untrained eyes !
As a result of my tour, I have now seen all but one of the recognized
species of Cockatoos in life. Palm Cockatoos (Microglossus aterrimus )
were at Taronga Park, Regent's Park, San Diego, and in the possession
of David West, senior, in Los Angeles. Red-tailed Blacks (Calypto-
rhynchus banksii ) were at Wassenaar, Regent's Park, and San Diego, as
well as at Sir Edward Hallstrom's in large numbers and in this collec-
tion also were seven examples of the rare Glossy Black (C. lathami).
Sir Edward also had numerous White-tailed Black ( C . baudinii) and

Yellow-tailed Black (C. funereus ) and the latter were also at Regent's
lark and Wassenaar. Gang-Gangs ( Callocephalon fimbnalum) were
breeding at the Duke of Bedford's, and were also at Mrs. Clark's
and J. Bruyneel's.
T h&lt; L &lt;; , rcatei Sul P llur - cres ted (. Kakaloe galerita) was everywhere
and the Triton ( K. triton) was in Taronga Park and Regent's Park
and, I think, at Rotterdam, although these seemed rather small
Citron-crested (K. atnno-cristata) were at Keston, Wassenaar, and
Regents Park Lesser Sulphur-crested (AT. sulphured) at Keston,
Regent s Park, Clifton, and the Bronx, and Dwarf Sulphur-crested
(A. parvula) at Regent's Park and Dudley. Leadbeater's (K lead-
beaten) were in most collections, White-crested (AT. alba) at Regent's
Park, and J. Bruyneel's, Salmon-crested (AT. moluccensis) at Regent's
Park, Wassenaar R. C. J. Sawyer's, and J. Bruyneel's, and the Blue-
eyed (A. ophthalmica) was represented at Regent's Park and was
breeding at Sir Edward Hallstrom's.
The Bare-eyed (if. sanguine a) was not uncommon, Rayson Brown
avmg a breeding pair; Ducorps' (if. ducorpsii) was at Taronga Park
and at Whipsnade, and I saw Coffin's (if. goffini), new to me, at
W hipsnade, Dudley, Wassenaar, and the Bronx. I had expected to
see the Red-vented (if. haematuropygia ) in U.S.A., but did not meet it
anywhere though Wassenaar's Goffin's was labelled thus. The
Slender-billed Cockatoo (if. tenuirostris) was at Regent's Park and at
San Diego, and the Western Slender-billed (if. pastinator) was also at
Kegent s Park, though here the two labels were reversed. Galahs (if
roseicapilla) were numerous, as also were Cockatiels ( Leptolophus hollan-
dicus), but I missed the white mutation of the latter in California

By D. H. S. Risdon (Dudley, Worcs., England)
Many people, when they start keeping birds, have visions of huge
aviaries containing mixed collections of species all flying happilv
together, to the great delight of their owner. This is a dream which
can seldom be realized in practice, as most of the bigger kinds of
birds are too pugnacious to agree together. One can, however, go
quite a long way towards realizing this dream, first bv sticking to
males only or, secondly, mixing only those species which are so
dinerent from each other that there is no rivalry.
This is not an article for the systematic breeder of birds. There is
no doubt whatever that where good breeding results are required, the
best rule is one pair per aviary. I am thinking now in terms of birds
o the size of Cardinals and upwards, most of which get very aggressive
when in breeding condition. 7 ^

D. H. S. RISDON-MIXING THE LARGER BIRDS
I am a great lover of really large aviaries. In my opinion they are
the only ones which are really an ornamental adjunct to a garden,
especially if the framework is of larch poles with the bark left on, which
to my mind blends so much more with the surroundings than sawn
timber or metal.
With these ideas in mind, I built myself an aviary 50 feet long and
15 feet wide, with a larch pole framework, and as I intended to keep
the larger kinds of birds I used one-inch mesh wire netting instead of
the usual half-inch. I have discovered, in practice, that birds of the
size of a House Sparrow and upwards cannot get through one-inch mesh.
Moreover, once the bright galvanizing has toned down, the wire is
hardly noticeable, and your view of the birds is almost uninterrupted.
One-inch mesh will exclude rats but not, of course, mice, nor such
marauders as weasels, but it has been my experience that it is almost
impossible to keep mice out of very big aviaries anyway. The solution
to that problem is to make your nest-boxes and feeding arrangements
mouse-proof inside the enclosure. As the aviary was only intended
for use during the summer months, the usual closed-in shelter was
dispensed with. The whole structure is built against a brick wall,
and along that side I have provided a 2 foot overhang of asbestos sheet,
which gives ample shelter from wind and rain. The aviary is, of
course, planted and turfed. A great advantage in constructing the
framework of natural larch poles is that besides being ornamental they
require no maintenance. They will stand for many years without any
attention, and when they do rot can be easily and cheaply replaced.
As a matter of interest to those who contemplate erecting such a
structure, the total cost of this aviary, including materials and labour,
was approximately #40, a price which, I think, compares very
favourably with much smaller aviaries made of more expensive
materials.
This aviary has given me a great deal of pleasure, as the space
gives the birds plenty of room in which to fly about and disport
themselves in a way they can never do in small enclosures. In other
words, one has the opportunity of seeing what birds can do and
studying their behaviour, besides just seeing what they look like.
Personally, I would rather have a few pairs kept under these conditions
than a larger collection housed in rows and rows of small, unattractive
aviaries, but that, of course, is entirely a matter of personal inclination.

trying to murder a Cardinal. I also tried a Blue-cheeked Barbet but
for some curious reason the Pennant's took a violent exception to this
bird, chasing it to the ground and pouncing on it like a couple of
hawks, so this had to be removed also.
I introduced the Pennant's and Ring-necks with some trepidation
knowing the aggressive nature of parrakeets towards each other but
they settled down very well and, apart from minor bickering there
was no serious trouble.
The Pennant s went to nest and reared two very fine youngsters.
It is interesting to note that this same pair for the previous two
breeding seasons, when they were housed in one of the Zoo aviaries
in their own compartment, on both occasions hatched young, but
let them die at about a week old. One thing was very noticeable.
Whilst they were prospecting for a nesting site and during the time
that the hen was preparing the nest, both birds were more aggressive
than at any time throughout the rest of the season. Once the hen
started to incubate the cock became extremely quiet, sitting up under
one of the overhead shelters near his wife's nest-box. When the hen
came off for exercise, both birds would fly from end to end of the
aviary, and it was a beautiful sight to see this lovely parrakeet really
get going on the wing.
The Ring-necks were very quiet to start with, but I think this was
argely due to the fact that the cock was a young bird and had only just
acquired his pink ring. Later on in the summer he began to throw
his weight about a bit more, and so did the hen who, by the way, is
a lutino. They both spent the early part of the summer moulting,
and came into breeding condition in August, when the hen took to a
nest-box. By this time the Pennant's had reared their family, and
I thought would have had no further interest in breeding. There
were four or five nest-boxes at different points in the aviary, and
although things had been quiet enough throughout the summer,
as soon as the hen Ring-neck decided to set up house the Pennant's
seemed to think they had the prerogative of all the nest-boxes. Although
they did not want one themselves, they took exception to the hen
ing-neck s right of entry. There was then a good deal of bickering
between both pairs, but as it was too late in the season for serious
breeding, I did not bother much, and there was no serious fighting.
I had rather expected that the parrakeets would do a lot of damage
to the growing bushes and plants, but they did surprisingly little,
possibly because in a large aviary they were able to take more exercise
and had other things to occupy their minds. The parrakeets took
absolutely no notice of the other birds, nor they of them.
I think one of the advantages of a mixed aviary is that all the birds
get a greater variety of food which their owner would not normally
think of giving them. For instance, the parrakeets often ate oranges

and bananas put in for the softbills, and I frequently saw them at the
pot containing insectivorous mixture. We have a mixed aviary in the
Birdhouse at Dudley Zoo, and I have actually seen a Virginian
Cardinal eating chopped-up raw meat put in for a Sun Bittern, to
give an example of the different and unlikely foods which birds will
eat given the chance.
The White-crested Jay-Thrushes I have already written about in
a previous article. They certainly provided the comic element in the
aviary, both with their amusing antics and laughing calls.
The Cardinals were no trouble at all. Being the smallest birds in
the aviary they could hardly be otherwise, but the bigger birds
ignored them.
The Cockatiel is a tame pet who spends his summer in the aviary
and the winter in a cage indoors. I gave him a mate to see if he
wanted to breed, but he obviously did not recognize her as such, and
much preferred human company when anyone was about. Oddly
enough, he took to a nest-box and spent many hours therein, furiously
guarding it against all comers including, even, the Pennant's who
retreated somewhat nonplussed from his onslaughts if they came too
near. I eventually removed the hen, as she looked somewhat dis-
consolate, poor thing! All she ever got from "Joey" was "Pop
goes the Weasel ", which is his favourite tune. "Joey " also used to
infuriate the Ringnecks by playing " Peeping Tom" when they were
courting, leaning over the edge of the roof of one of the shelters and
watching them intently, while the cock was stamping the perch and
feeding the hen.
The Long-tailed Glossy Starlings proved to be very harmless birds,
and looked most lovely in the sunshine, flying the full length of the
aviary with their long tails trailing behind them.
The Bleeding-heart Pigeons, of course, gave no trouble. In any
case, it is generally recognized that birds of the dove and pigeon family
are good mixers with other genera.
To those interested in trying a mixed collection of the larger birds
on the above lines, I would say there are two rules to be observed.
The first is to supply a really large aviary. I would not have attempted
to mix, for instance, Jay-Thrushes with Cardinals in an aviary of less
dimensions than this one. I think that provided there is sufficient space
for the birds to get away from each other there is no cornering and
bullying. The second rule is, of course, to mix species from entirely
different genera. Most fighting occurs through rivalry, but there is
no competition between birds whose habits and temperament and
requirements in the way of nesting sites are different. If you have
alternate indoor accommodation for use during the winter, there is
a lot to be said for a summer aviary of this type. For one thing, you
can bring your birds inside during the cold weather which makes it

By W. G. Baird (Palmerston North, New Zealand)
This is an account of my breeding of the Red-sided Edectus. it
is the first time it has been bred here, in fact my pair, apart from
two cock birds in one of the Zoos, are the only Eclectus in New Zealand,
procured a pair in January, 1954, whilst on a visit to Australia,
ley were both bred late in 1953, having been not long out of the
nest when I got them. I arrived back in New Zealand in February
wit the birds, and they soon settled down in their new quarters, but
within a month I lost the hen. It died for no apparent reason,
showing none of the usual signs of sickness. That put me in a fix.
coud not get a replacement from overseas as our authorities had
seen fit to reimpose the parrot ban in N.Z, and at the time of writing
there does not seem to be any prospect of it being lifted.
Here I must digress slightly. I knew of a hen Eclectus which a
lady m my city had as a pet-she bought the bird for #50 from a naval
sai 01 during the war years. He could not tell her the name of the
bird, ana she had no way of finding out. It was only through my
visiting her neighbour in 1948 and hearing the bird call out that
discovered it It was quite tame and would say a couple of words *
she had named it Bill, but when she found an egg in the bottom of its
cage she promptly changed its name to Whillemena. At that time
I had never seen an Eclectus, so told the lady that I would see if I
"f: o(TM)? what the Species was, which I duly found in Caley's
hat Bad is That ?. Well, when my bird died, I thought I would see
the lady would sell me her bird, which she did, and it enabled me
to have a pair again. I put them together, but they did not take
any notice of each other. The hen had been kept in a cage, with the
consequence it was wing stiff. I then put in a nest-box, four feet high,
with the inside lined with wire netting. The box has an extension
ol a foot on the bottom, making it L-shaped, the extension being
inged to facilitate inspection. I put a layer of decayed wood on the
ottom and it was no time before the hen was in the box. Next thing
ere were two eggs in the box. She sat tight, and after she had been
SI mg for a couple of weeks I managed to get the eggs out for testing
with a strong torch ; they both proved clear, so my hopes were
somewhat dashed. I removed the eggs and she immediately laid
two more. This time one was fertile, which she hatched out, only to

let it die after three weeks, so my hopes were again dashed. She duly
laid again, two more eggs, this time both were fertile, and the first
chick hatched on 2nd February, followed by the second on 4th
February, both eggs taking twenty-eight days to hatch. She sat
tight on the chicks, only coming off for short periods to be fed by the
cock. At this time she developed a very shrill call, and she used the
same call all the time the chicks were in the nest. The cock bird
made no attempt to go in the nest ; he seemed to maintain a very
indifferent attitude, as if to say : " well, I've done my part, the rest
is up to you, old girl," but he was always ready to feed when she
called him. I maintained a daily inspection and the hen did not
object to my intrusion. Maybe it was on account of her being so
tame through being a pet. The elder chick was in the box for 74
days before coming out, the second bird was 82 days, but they spent
a few days looking out of the hole before deciding to come out into
the world. The first chick was flying three days after coming out,
the second came out on 25th April, and has not flown at the time
of writing. Both chicks are cock birds, and nearly as large as their
father.
The hen is now getting ready for another brood, as she is in the
nest-box practically all the time. All I need to find out now to make
the cycle complete, is whether the cock bird takes over the feeding of
the young once they are out of the nest. To date I have not seen
either parent feeding the young. The cock never went into the nest-
box, but when I lifted the lid for inspection he was always close, and
had a look in when I did. Neither parent objected to my regular
visits to the nest. For feeding, I gave the birds a staple diet of sun-
flower seed, wheat, and plain canary seed, plus any suitable green
food. Whilst feeding the young, in addition to the above, they were
given peanuts, soaked raisins, banana, ripe pears, apples, silver
beet, thistle, all kinds of seeding grasses, lettuce leaves, seeding dock,
dock leaves, and the hen had a liking for the roots, and a weed
known as " fat hen ". I gave the birds as big a variety as I could
procure, as I do not think that they would have reared the chicks
without it.
The Eclectus always arouse interest in visitors to my aviaries on
account of the contrasting colours of the sexes.

The Duke of Bedford then replied : " Thank you for your kind
welcome, and in particular thank you for the praise you have given to
my father's contributions to aviculture. The unveiling of a memorial
is, inevitably, a sad occasion, bringing back memories of someone
to whom we all wish to pay tribute, but who is no longer with us.
However, to-day, we not only have the fine plaque which I am about
to unveil, but also the aviary, a happy living reminder of my father's
work in the interests of bird-lovers. I am sure, were it possible for
him to be with us, he would be deeply moved, as indeed I am, by
your kindness and that of his friends and admirers from all over
the world, who have so generously contributed to this memorial.
It is the embodiment of one of his principal interests, and certainly
one that brought him the greatest happiness in all his life ...
" if one walked with him through his aviaries, and he got over his
shyness, he would tell one things about birds and their individual
characteristics, just as you and I might talk about our friends.. I have
never met anyone else who had that extraordinary insight into the
minds of animals, fishes, or birds, or such a capacity for being able
to transmit that knowledge to others. I imagine it was this deep
feeling and understanding that made it possible for him to contribute
so much for the benefit of bird-lovers. For example, we have here
this original discovery that a bird need no longer regard its cage as
a prison, but as its home. It was discoveries like this which made my
father one of the most distinguished and best-loved aviculturists of his
generation. That is why you have given so generously and why I,
his son, have been invited to unveil this memorial plaque, and why
I have such pleasure and pride in doing so."
The Duke then unveiled the plaque, and immediately afterwards
a trap-door in the roof of the enclosure was opened to enable the
Budgerigars to fly out at will.
The aviary was stocked with birds from the late Duke of Bedford's
collection at Woburn, and from a number of Budgerigar enthusiasts
who had followed the Duke's example and raised homing strains.
The " Duke of Bedford Memorial Trophy " is shown in an illustra-
tion to this article.
Great credit is due to Mr. R. C. J. Sawyer, Hon. Treasurer of the
Duke of Bedford Memorial Appeal, not only for all the hard work he
put into raising the necessary funds, but for his thought and care in
the organization of the unveiling ceremony.

3. Threat and Fighting and their Relation to Sexual Rivalry
Territory, the Defence of the Young, and Courtship
There may be hostility between members of one pair and members of another
. . . the only reason I can discover for it is the trespassing of one or both birds
0] a strange pair upon the territory of another. It is much more interesting
however, to find in these birds what we had best call flirtation . . . a bout of
shaking ensues between two birds who are not mated. If the rightful mate
sees what is going on, it is always roused to action. ... It drives the odd
bird away (often by a subaqueous attack with the beak) and then almost
always has a strong bout of shaking with its mate.
Huxley, 1914: 521 and 558.
Now that the more general side of the Great Crested Grebe's life-
history has been briefly outlined in the preceding parts, the rest of
the paper will be largely concerned with various intriguing and often
spectacular aspects of its reproductive-cycle. Emphasis will lie mainly
upon behaviour rather than the more numerical details of the breeding
biology, though these will not be entirely neglected
Writing as recently as 1943, David Lack was able to say, in his
The Life of the Robin, that " the study of bird behaviour is at so early
a stage that it can be described in simple language without loss in
precision . Now, in 1955, the first part of this remark is fortunately
no longer true. The objective study of bird behaviour has made
rapid progress in this country, thanks mainly to the work of Dr. N.
,&amp;apos;. nF ; j er f n an f hl f colleagues. Tinbergen's book on The Herring Gull's
II arid shows clearly, however, that the last part of Dr. Lack's comment
can be as true to-day as ever it was, in spite of the great increase in
knowledge. The description and analysis of behaviour can still be made
interesting and readable to a wide public without any real loss in
scientific value. Unfortunately many writers in recent years, myself
included have tended to forget this. The increase in complexity of
bird behaviour studies has driven the amateur observer away into
other branches of ornithology to a very large extent. This is to be
deplored for the non-professional worker considerably helped to lav
the foundations of the modern objective approach in the pre-war
years.
Questions of threat and fighting will be the subject of the present
section. This has not been nearly so adequately dealt with in the
literature as the courtship has, although an understanding of the

132 K. E. L. SIMMONS-STUDIES ON GREAT CRESTED GREBES
aggressive behaviour is essential for an appreciation of the nature and
origin of the courtship itself.
Brief but valuable information is to be found in Huxley's great
paper: he outlined the general territorial set-up in the species (at
a time before this concept had fully penetrated ornithological thought
to the extent it was to do subsequently) and also recorded, in more
detail, that many quarrels between grebes had nothing to do with any
territory but were due to sexual rivalry. Huxley's observations on
the territorial side of aggressive behaviour were later extended by
Venables and Lack, who concentrated mainly on the possible function
of territory and did not discuss the many non-territorial aspects.
Aggressive Behaviour and the Annual-cycle
While some bird species, such as House-sparrows (. Passer domesticus)
and Great Tits ( Parus major), will squabble over food in winter and
others, such as the Robin ( Erithacus rubecula ), keep up a winter
territory, aggressive behaviour is usually best developed when the
birds are in a reproductive mood. The Great Crested Grebe belongs
to this last class.
During the winter, between the usual October-end and late
January-beginning of noticeable reproductive activity, some grebes
may occasionally " bark " and threaten others in open water. This has
nothing to do with disputes over food, and is unrelated to any territory.
It seems to be due to some sort of weak reproductive tendency, for
the grebe is one of those species in which such a tendency is never
absolutely dormant. With the inception of the first stage of the
reproductive cycle (see p. 13), hostilities develop more intensely.
Quite a deal of threatening, some attacking and occasional fighting
take place in the open water which is now the scene of very much
activity, particularly of head-shaking courtship between mated birds
and those in the process of pairing-up. This aggressiveness is due to
sexual rivalry, as described by Huxley, in circumstances often much
the same as those in the quotation cited at the head of this section.
This kind of sexual fighting goes on throughout the cycle, both in the
open water and in the area of the nest.
The clash of interests in the " free " ownerless water is nothing in
comparison with what happens in the vicinity of cover, when the
grebe pairs start to search round for nest sites. Now the birds
may have two reasons to set an edge to their tempers--their
aggressiveness may be both sexual and territorial at one and the same
time. The situation is started in motion by a few (assumed) older and
more experienced birds which visit their former territories of the
previous season on fine days in winter itself, especially after December
has had its run. These territories are defended with increasing
intensity as the season progresses. Many pairs, however, go through

their period of initial courtship in the open water and only then start
to look round for likely nest sites. Once they have settled down at a
. suitable spot this site becomes the focus point of their territory and they
drive intruders away from it and also from the water surrounding it
he chances of finding unoccupied areas are reasonably good earlier
in the season, or on lightly populated waters. But at places with hi*h
numbers, however, such as at Burghfield, or at those with a relatively
poor amount of cover, this becomes increasingly difficult later As

near the mate. This flirtation (or the displaying together of a male
and female that are not paired) is otherwise a little recorded aspect
of bird life. As the male Great Crested Grebe is the most likely of the
two to show such behaviour, much of this sexual aggressiveness is
between females--I have in fact no records myself of a mated female
flirting and it is obvious from Huxley's observations that such a thing
is rare. Sexual antagonism of this sort is most intense during the
pre-parental stages of the cycle. While the male grebe is the more
intense of the two in territorial aggression, when his mate is occasion-
ally as persistent as he in threat and attack, even at times more so,
then this is because her attentions are directed at the intruding female
with which her mate is flirting. Once a paired female went almost
berserk in the nesting territory. The male had approached an in-
truding female first in threat-display and then with an increasing
tendency to head-shake, mixing his aggressive calls with the ticking
courtship note. Previously, as is normally the case, his own female
had stayed behind him in his dealings with the strange pair, but now
she dashed at the other female and harried her back and forth across
(and under) the territory. She even pecked at her mate in passing!
Such recriminations against the " faithless " husband are rare though,
as Huxley points out, and marital appeasement is usually effected
through head-shaking. On another occasion a mated female was
incubating when an intruding female came near. The male was not
at all inclined to see the latter away and finally the first female jumped
down from the nest and drove her off. Further examples of sexual
antagonism--in open water--are given by Huxley.
The Nest Site
The nesting territory of the Great Crested Grebe is built up round
the nest site. Unlike many typically territorial species, grebes do not
first set up a territory and then fix on a nest site later as the season
progresses. Most territories are established when the grebe pair has
" chosen " a site. This choosing involves entering likely cover,
commencing to build there, and displaying, resting and preening in
the immediate vicinity. The male grebe is the more aggressive of the
sexes in territorial defence. In those older pairs that have kept in
touch with their territories during the winter (see above), initial
courtship, the visiting of cover, nest building, and the defence of
territory all tend to develop together. Territories are never main-
tained in places where there are no nesting sites. This close link
between territory and the nest site is well illustrated by a pair of grebes
watched by Venables in 1936 at Frensham Little Pond (Surrey).
These birds had chosen nest sites in two widely separated places, both
of which they defended but not the intervening open water. At
Burghfield, early in the season, individual pairs have had as many as

three nest sites simultaneously, each defending all these and main-
taining one large continuous territory. While grebes are always
rather inclined to be pugnacious, it is in the vicinity of the nest itself
that the most intense aggression is liable to be seen. While invading
males will never risk combat over a flirtation they will fight bitterly
on occasions to win over a nest site.
Some remarks on the reason for all this trouble, that essential item
the nesting-platform, seem appropriate at this point. This is some-
t mg much more than a place for the eggs: without a platform (or
a substitute one) the birds cannot copulate, for this must be done, after
so lciting, on a raised site. In effect, aggression over sites could be
considered as a rather specialized form of sexual fighting.
The Toung
Any strange grebe, however innocent its intentions, is liable to be
t reatened if it comes near the young of another pair, both inside and
away from the territory. A typical example of a serious encounter
resulting from the defence of the young is as follows. A pair of grebes
leaves its nesting territory and wanders off with the brood to the
open water to feed. By chance the birds trespass in the territory of
another pair and are threatened. The other adult grebes then dive
at the young, which do not appreciate the situation, whereupon the
parents instead of making off as they would usually (having no
essential interests involved within the other territory), retaliate with
threat, actual fighting perhaps then resulting. If, as occasionally
happens, such a wandering family makes its temporary head-
quarters at a stretch of water away from the original nesting territory
d , th (R) P arent ? chase off intruders coming near the young, because of

I his should not be confused with a fixed territory centred on the nest
however, for it moves with the young. 5
The Type of Nesting Territory Maintained
All breeding pairs of Great Crested Grebes exert ownership over
a nest site at least, but the size of the defended water adjoining this
as well as the number of activities conducted there, varies con-
siderably Much depends on the density of the population and the
degree of competition for sites (and hence on the amount of cover
available). Another most important factor is the nature of topography *
whether the littoral cover is irregular, with a small frontage of water
(lor example), affording each grebe pair a good view of its neighbours;
or even, with a wide frontage of water, so that the birds are hidden
Irom one another when at the nest.
The territorial situation at Burghfield may be briefly outlined, using

Mrs. M. M. Nice's classification of the main types of nesting territory
as a convenient basis for discussion. These are:--
A. Mating, nesting, and feeding ground for the young; B. Mating
and nesting ground, but not feeding ground; C. Mating station only,
and D. Territory restricted to the narrow surroundings of the nest, as
found in both colonial and solitary species.
As pointed out by Huxley, most pairs of Great Crested Grebes
maintain a territory of Type B. Within this area (which may measure
from 300 to 900 square yards at a very rough approximation), the two
birds build their platform (or platforms), do some of their courtship,
all their intimate sexual behaviour, and incubate the eggs. Only an
unimportant amount of their food is captured there and they hunt most
in open water away from cover. They may desert the territory when
the young hatch out.
In addition, I have found that a few pairs have held a joint nesting
and feeding territory of Type A. At Burghfield, there is a small, land-
locked island-dotted pool of some 2 acres which has a narrow,
bottle-neck entrance leading from the open water. This " breeding-
pool ", as we call it locally, is a very popular nesting spot for the
grebes and in 1954 no less than nine pairs tried to breed there, though
usually it holds five or six pairs at the most. As in all the other years
from 1948 onwards, one pair established an early Type A territory of
about J acre while all the remaining territories, occupied by stages later,
were crowded into the other ij acres and their owners fed away
from the pool. Some of them had to dive under their neighbour's areas
to reach the open water. A small proportion of pairs (two in 1954)
sneak into a densely populated place like this after the others have
settled down, and are often very furtive except in the immediate
vicinity of the nest. Thus, such suppressed (and compressed) birds
really have a Type D territory of only a few square yards.
The normal Type B grebe territory can never provide enough food
for the adults and the chicks so that the parent birds must of necessity
leave it with their brood to hunt elsewhere. But often the territory
is not deserced entirely when the young have hatched, as Venables
found to be invariably the case at Frensham. The birds may keep in
touch with it and rest and roost there. The less fortunate pairs with
a Type D territory, on the other hand, probably invariably desert
their nest site entirely when the young have come off, as my friend
G. E. Douglas points out to me. The few pairs with the larger Type A
territories remain in them for the whole season, though individual
excursions are made by both male and female, sometimes with the
young. Those grebes owning such territories locally seem the most
likely to engage in genuine second-broods and often rear the most
offspring in a season. Thus in 1954, the pair (A54 in my numbering)
inhabiting the large, traditional nesting/feeding territory in the

one of the Type D birds had any surviving chicks at all in that year
which was not .however, a very good breeding year in general as h
happened (L. McCartan confirms for the Oxford area). All this
would suggest, perhaps, that the territorial set-up is still evolving
rathei than declining, in the Great Crested Grebe. The advantage
seems to be with the birds possessing the rare Type A territories
It may be remarked in passing that the Dabchick seems invariably
to establish territories of this kind (Hartley, 1937).
The Patterns of the Aggressive Behaviour Itself
So far only the reasons for, and the results of, the aggressive
behaviour of the Great Crested Grebe have been discussed. It is time
to deal with the actual patterns of behaviour involved in clashes
between rival grebes. No detailed study has yet appeared in the
literature, though Gunn (1928) wrote a useful short article on " The
fighting methods of the Great Crested Grebe " and brief notes are
scattered through the papers of Huxley, and of Venables and Lack.
lire principles involved in bird antagonisms are relatively com-
plicated and the whole problem is admirably discussed by Tinbergen
in a series of works published in 1953. A few general points may be
summarized here. Just as in individual (as opposed to factional)
hostility m human beings, actual physical fighting is comparatively
rare m birds, though rather less infrequent in grebes than in manv
other species. Strong aggressive inclinations are usually denied
uninhibited expression because of a counter tendency to escape.
ggressive birds are thus usually prevented from seriously hurting one
another because they are also, to a variable extent, afraid of each other
" &amp;apos; . f i S .* f ' m P ortance to the survival of the species that such
a state of affairs should be the general rule: apart from the fatalities
that unchecked fighting might inflict, too great an aggressive make-up
n the individual bird might seriously interfere with its sexual relations
with the opposite sex, unless some other pattern of behaviour is evolved to
counteract it. The conflict and compromise between attacking and fleeim
endencies, as well as the temporary supremacy of one or the other 5
is part of the causal basis of much of the hostile behaviour of birds and
accounts to a very large extent for the relative variability of possible
responses in hostile situations. In the Great Crested Grebe these
responses include attack and fighting (aggressive element dominant) :
threat, incipient _ attack and displacement-activity (attack impulse
inhibited by fleeing one), and actual escaping (urge to withdraw
strongest of all).

Threat: The Forward-display
This display (which Huxley called both the search- and Dundreary-
attitude) is the most common item of the grebe's hostile repertory.
In intense versions, when the bird is very nearly, but not quite, on the
point of attacking, it stretches the lowered neck well forward hori-
zontally so that it is often at least partially awash, though the head
itself is usually just clear of the water. The tippets are spread forward
(in " curtain-form " according to Huxley's classification) and what
appears to be the folded secondaries on the back, or at least their coverts,

are unevenly rucked up so that in extreme cases the white becomes
visible (in fact the wings start to unfold). In this posture the angry
grebe may often swim towards, or face, the rival directly, so that its
body is squarely behind the forward pointing bill. It may call loudly
and frequently. The threat-calls are rather variable but always
recognizable for what they are. The most common version is a harsh
repeated, barking " rraaah-rraaah ... ", broad vowelled (sound
) d rather coarse-sounding--obviously the call termed
the bark by Huxley. Coward's " discordant e gorr ' " refers to a
variant of the same note. At lower intensities this barking degenerates
into an undertoned, nasal and somewhat metallic " gang-gang-gang

plete is its display. The first component to disappear is the raising of
the feathers over the back. The neck becomes less fully extended and
more bent so that the head comes nearer to, and sometimes touches,
the shoulders. The tippets are not so noticeably spread or may even
be actually depressed. A bird in such a relatively low intensity
posture is obviously not very inclined to attack; it may approach the
rival laterally, cease advancing, or even swim at an angle away
with just the head turned towards it. Sometimes a grebe that has

approached another very purposefully in intense display may assume
the less complete posture as it gets nearer, especially if its opponent has
stood its ground and perhaps threatened back. Obvfously the
advancing bird's tendency to escape has been increased. On the
other hund, if the other grebe flees, this often tips the scale and turns
the threatening bird s display into active attack.
Threat: Token-diving
While it is obvious from simple observation that the forward-
display functions to stimulate withdrawal in other grebes, the sight
o an aggressive bird actually diving in its direction is a still stronger
inducement for an intruder to retreat. It is not surprising then to find
that a more formal kind of diving--token-diving, as I call it--functions
also as a close-range threat, often used in conjunction with intense
01 ward-display. This often occurs when two equally matched grebes
are opposed. Facing its rival, one of the birds (or both) may dive as
o attack the other from under water. But there is no force in the
spring and no progress made towards the opponent below the surface.

a little farther away from the other grebe than before. Such behaviour
&amp;gt;s typical of quarrels between neighbours on the border between
territories and seldom leads to fighting. The whole situation is in other
cases always volatile: a serious fight may break out and one-sided
at ack is ever imminent, especially if one of the contestants starts to
retreat, as often happens.
One-sided Attack
In many cases attack is not pressed home because the very sight of
an aggressive grebe approaching in a menacing way is enough to send
the less purposeful bird into retreat at full speed. Hence, attacks often
do not proceed past the initial diving advance. However, if the
attacking grebe can surprise its rival, or if the latter does not retire
u y rut remains on the surface, the former may spear or " torpedo "
it from under the water with its dagger-bill. Lunging attacks with the
bill are also made across the top of the water, often from the intense
forward-display position. The bird opens out its wings and, with neck
outstretched half-flies, half-patters over the surface It the adversary
often then submerging in pursuit, as the other crash-dives away from
e onslaught or going into the forward-display again. Should the
aggressor catch up with the fleeing grebe, either below or on top of the
water, it attempts to seize the other's head in the bill, rather like it deals
wi h a fish, and to force the unfortunate bird under the surface
getting on top of it and perhaps keeping balance with open wings.'
As I have already recorded on p. 96, I once saw a grebe held under
the water in this way for at least three minutes. The bill-grip needed

to do this must be most powerful and it is little wonder that fish
stand small chance of surviving after once being caught.
Now that the attacking methods have been briefly outlined, it is
possible to trace the origin of the forward-display : natural selection
has simply ritualized the grebe's preparation to attack. Clearly the
display is based upon the surface attacking movements. In intense
versions of this display, which are very likely to turn into attack, the
head is held forward for spearing with the bill and the wings held
partly open ready to unfold for the lunging flight at the opponent.
Indeed, at times the forward-display may develop into incipient, or
" token ", attack: the grebe briefly opens its wings, rushes across the
water for a very short way, subsides in the bow-wave, and again
displays.

Fighting

Fighting between two birds occurs occasionally when both are
extremely pugnacious and do not retreat. Usually something is at
stake--a nest site, for instance. A typical combat might develop like
this. Two rivals, usually males, face each other a few feet apart in full
forward-display. Token-diving may occur. Then suddenly, and
apparently simultaneously, both grebes leap at each other and clash
vertically breast to breast, stabbing and grappling with the bills, both
trying to get on top of its rival and hold it down, as described above.
The wings may be loosely held open but are not used as fighting organs.
Usually, if the fight continues, one bird does manage to force the other
under the water, where it struggles to surface and causes a turmoil of
water. Another serious encounter may proceed like this. Two pairs--

bird may begin to lose its nerve, as it were, and start to waggle its
head a little and also to habit-preen, both as in typical head-shaking
display, gradually relaxing its strained posture. If the rival makes no
movement, it will slowly withdraw, displacement-preening as it goes.
Then often the other grebe " comes to " and attacks. There is a
distinct resemblance between the upright pre-attack posture and the
one assumed during head-shaking courtship; perhaps this is by no
means merely coincidental.
I know of no certain case of death resulting from fights between
grebes, but have circumstantial evidence that it may occasionally
occur. At one of the two small pools near Burghfield, that was occupied
by a single breeding pair, I found the body of a freshly killed adult
grebe. This bird had a small but deep wound at the base of the neck
which could have been caused by a beak stab, for its own bill fitted
very well into the hole.
Withdrawal: Escape
I have just described how a bird in the upright, pre-attack posture
may behave as its tendency to withdraw overcomes that to fight. Very
often, in less serious circumstances, a grebe that has been threatening
will turn away, and, if not pursued, swim off preening various parts
of its body as it goes. Such " displacement-preening " is a sure sign

that the bird is now in no mood to attack. The behaviour is very
probably caused by the urge to escape from the adversary over-riding
that to attack it, for the bird retreats from trouble. John Field has
kindly told me his experience with a captured grebe brought to him
for release: when being held, this bird both pecked and struggled to
get away--and also preened its feathers.
An intruding grebe with a strong tendency to escape is unmis-
takable. It holds its neck right up into an almost pencil-like thinness,
probably to command a wide view, and tightly depresses its tippets
and crest so that the head seems unusually slender with little break in
its contours. I call this the furtive-posture. The wary bird dives
frequently and is always quick to move off if threatened. Though it is
obviously merely an elaboration of the normal pre-diving attitude
(see p. 96), the furtive-posture serves to reduce the grebe's con-
spicuousness by concealing the head-ornaments as much as possible,
achieving exactly the opposite effect to the threat and courtship
displays.
A frightened grebe's usual method of active escape is to dive away
from an advancing bird. It will also retreat across the surface. With
head up and the tippets flattened, it skids forward on the breast
with legs driving powerfully behind and wings waving. This skidding
is often followed by diving. Sometimes, however, the fleeing grebe may
pause, turn in its tracks and dip its head under the water to look for the
other bird, then diving or skidding on again, or relaxing as is necessary.
Which of the two ways of escape will be used at any one moment
depends, to a certain extent, on the behaviour and proximity of the
attacking grebe. If the latter dives while still some distance away, or
lunges across the surface at very close range, the other bird will often

lunge while still some way away, or spear from the depths, then a

Frightened grebe escaping over the surface.
Two less frequent aspects of escape behaviour remain to be
mentioned. I have a few records of individuals bathing in the
rantic way described on pp. 101-2 after aggressive encounters.
Bruce (1950) saw the weaker of two fighting grebes, after a combat
lasting several minutes and after it had been held under the water

round it, giving it occasional stabs with its bill but getting no response:
next, it suddenly dived from this position without any warning.

shaking display with its mate. From its subsequent appearance and
behaviour it did not appear to have been injured

The " Cat-attitude " in Hostile Situations
Instead of fleeing or going into the forward-display, some grebes
that are threatened by others, or at least are being approached by birds
whose motives are uncertain, may assume a version of the bizarre
display called the " cat-attitude " by Huxley. In this, the most
striking of all grebe postures, the wings are held half-open at right
angles to the body and tilted forward, the white markings showing up
conspicuously. The tippets are expanded and the head tucked back
so that it is framed by the wings. So far, when sure of the sex of the
displaying bird, it is only the female grebe that I have seen behaving
thus.
Cat-attitude (high intensity).
Sometimes the odd female involved in a flirtation may go into the
cat-attitude when being chivied by the mated pair, the male of which
has just been head-shaking with her. Females " advertising " for
a mate in open water will often go into the display when approached
by other birds (Simmons, 1954). Once such a female was the onlooker
in a fierce territorial skirmish between three pairs of grebes. Every
time that one of these birds came near her, she went into the " cat
A mated female, alone in the territory and advertising for her mate,
half-assumed this display when a pair of grebes started to head-shake
near by.
Strangely enough there seems to be only one record of this sort of
use of the cat-attitude in the literature, that of Hartley (1940). His
remark (on what he considered incorrectly to be unusual behaviour)
that " Variations in behaviour such as these may help to elucidate the
relationship between the sexual and aggressive displays of the Great
Crested Grebe " is very true indeed, as I hope to show later. Briefly,
I think that a bird goes into the cat-attitude when its tendency to
escape is influenced by a sexual impulse. The display aims to inhibit
attack in the other bird--is a " defensive " display.

Occasionally, during actual hostilities, a bird may head-shake at its
adversary of the same sex. Head-shaking may occur between unmated
birds of the opposite sex in cases of flirtation and during pair-formation.
But in the majority of instances that come under the observer's
notice, the display is a mutual affair of the mated pair of grebes. Very
often in the pre-parental stages of the cycle, this type of courtship is
*' spontaneous " or virtually uninfluenced by the activities of other
birds. It may also be " induced " by outside factors, however, and
most of the head-shaking performed during the parental stages is of
this nature. An almost invariable feature of aggressive encounters is
the induced head-shaking that takes place between the mated birds
concerned, during pauses in the skirmishing or afterwards. Thus
territory owners unite and display after driving away intruders. The
latter, when at a safe distance, may also link up and shake as also may
onlookers, not directly concerned in the affair. In view of the extreme
frequency of such behaviour, it is rather surprising that no previous
writer has stressed this aspect of head-shaking.
Actual and " Symbolic " Aggressiveness within the Grebe Pair
I hope that it is obvious from the account so far given that the Great
Ciested Grebe is potentially and actually a very pugnacious bird. It
is i athei surprising then to find that so little antagonism occurs between
the male and female of the pair, especially when one realizes that the
mate has all the external characteristics that otherwise, if it were an
outsider, might often stimulate intense aggression in the other partner.
Moreover, grebes are &quot; non-contact " birds--that is, except when
fighting,^ copulating, or performing one of the courtship displays (the
penguin-dance ), they do not voluntarily touch another member
of the species. (This contrasts with the behaviour of such a group as
the little Estrildine finches so well known to aviculturists.) One
would expect, therefore, to find overt hostility to be very conspicuous
between paired grebes. Even the renowned Lovebirds (. Agapornis ),
typical contact " birds which show every sign of affection to the
mate, will at times spar quite fiercely. But the grebes are hostile to
one another only occasionally and then quite mildly. Male and
female tend to assume lower-intensity forward-displays when approach-
ing each other and, rarely, one may surface under its mate in incipient

attack and give it a scare, the two birds head-shaking after. (Dabchicks
wiii trill in such circumstances.)
On the other hand, grebes do perform what might be considered
in other species an abnormally large amount of courtship display.
Spontaneous head-shaking is very common during the pre-parental
stages and induced display occurs throughout the whole reproductive
cycle. Also, during the first four stages of the cycle other courtship
activities are not infrequent, particularly what Huxley terms the
" discovery " and " display " ceremonies in which the cat-attitude
figures prominently. I believe that a large measure of aggression,
that might result in overt hostility between male and female, is
absorbed by courtship behaviour. Courtship in grebes is caused by a
mixture of sexual, aggressive and fleeing impulses, and functions, not
only to maintain and strengthen the pair-bond as Huxley suggests
(see p. 10), but also to inhibit and absorb aggression. There is much
evidence to support this theory, not least of all being the fact that the
display movements themselves seem to be very highly ritualized , or " symbolic "
fighting ones. The discovery-ceremony, for instance, seems obviously a
stylized one of attack and rebuff. Further discussion will be reserved
for the next section.

CARE AND FEEDING OF THE
COCK-OF-THE-ROCK

By H. A. Gerrits (Curator of Birds, Wassenaar Zoo, Holland)
In the Louise Hall of the Wassenaar Zoological Gardens we have
three specimens of the Cock-of-the-Rock, namely a couple of the
Orange Cock-of-the-Rock (Rupicola rupicola ) and a male of the very
rare Scarlet Cock-of-the-Rock (Rupicola sanquinolenta).
The third representative of this family, Rupicola peruviana, resembles
Rupicola rupicola , and has the same bright orange colour, but has no
filaments on the wing feathers.
Although the Cock-of-the-Rock is a rare bird, it will be known to
many, who have not seen living specimens, by illustrations which
have been published in various books and periodicals from time to
time. As the Cock-of-the-Rock lives in the humid, dense, mountain
jungles of Guiana, Cayenne, and a part of the Amazons, the installation
of the aviary when the bird is kept in captivity is equally important
as its diet.

H. A. GERRITS CARE AND FEEDING OF THE COCK-OF-THE-ROCK
J 47
Ihe diet of the Cock-of-the-Rock consists officially of fruit, but in
its natural habitat it spends a great part of its life on the ground
looking for all kinds of small insects.
Any one who tries to keep this bird in a cage or in a common aviary
with a sand bottom only, and who feeds it with fruit only, will within
a very short time have the bird out of condition, and if no alteration
is made the bird will very soon die.
Being fully aware of these facts the Zoological Gardens of Wassenaar
planned the living surroundings of the Cock-of-the-Rock quite
differently and with this and a very carefully composed diet we have
succeeded in keeping our three Cocks-of-the-Rock in perfect condition
for four years already.
In the first place it is absolutely necessary to keep the birds apart,
as these birds are very pugnacious, and although they may get on
very well together in the beginning, a disastrous quarrel will sooner
or later occur, resulting in the death of one of them. The planning
of the aviary was a very careful job. The ground was covered with
a thick layei of black mould about 30 inches high, already containing
numerous small living insects. Beneath this black mould is a 6 in.
layer of broken shells preventing the earth from going sour. The
earth is generously sprayed with water daily, giving it the necessary
humidity. This provides an excellent ground for the Cock-of-the-
Rock, preventing the bird from getting all sorts of foot troubles.
The aviary is about 12 feet by 7 and 8 feet high. The growth
of plants should be abundant; numerous and high-growing plants
provide the bird with its accustomed quiet surroundings, and to this
a few small rocks should be added. Besides their artistic value, these
rocks play a part in the feeding. We observed that this bird is very
fond of snails, so when obtainable we fed them some daily, and it
is most intei esting to see how they smash the snail shells on the rocks
in the aviary before eating the contents.
Coming back to the aviary, I forgot to mention that the earth on
the ground is grown over with grass, while a large shallow water-
basin enables the bird to take its beloved bath. Moreover, a few
nicely arranged thick branches are added for perching.
The Cock-of-the-Rock's sensibility to temperature gives us no
trouble. The temperature of the Louise Hall rises on hot summer
days to 35 0 C., and judging from its behaviour the Cock-of-the-Rock
finds this pretty hot too ; bathing takes place more frequently, and
the bird sits in the shadow for the greater part of the day. In winter,
however, when it is freezing, and the temperature falls back to + 5 0 C.
during the coldest part of the night, the Cock-of-the-Rock reacts quite
normally, and there are no signs whatsoever that the bird cannot
stand the cold. Of course, these extreme temperatures do not occur

148 H. A. GERRITS-CARE AND FEEDING OF THE COCK-OF-THE-ROCK
overnight. Between the 35 0 of August and the 5 0 of January four
months must pass in which the temperature is gradually falling.
Incidentally, I want to point out that the differences in day and
night temperature, which sometimes occur in hot summer days, and
may be 15 0 C. on a single night, act extremely favourably on the
general condition of the birds. On second thoughts, one has to admit
that this is not so remarkable, as in nature, and especially in the
tropical habitat, there is an even greater difference between the day
and night temperatures.
I shall now discuss the feeding of the Cock-of-the-Rock. In the
first place I want to state that the feeding is based on a morning and
an evening diet of quite different composition. The morning diet is
given at 9 o'clock, and consists of:
</bodyText>
<footnote confidence="0.881593166666667">
3 spoonfulls of boiled rice (the grains must be dry and not sticking
together at all) ;
1 grated carrot ;
1 spoonful of dextropur (glucose and fructose) ;
3 spoonfuls of very finely chopped hard-boiled egg ;
3 spoonfuls of a very good insectivorous food, to which dried ant
</footnote>
<bodyText confidence="0.9119178" page_id="58091585"  page_num="Page 148" year="" vol="">
eggs and dried insects are added.
These ingredients must be thoroughly mixed before giving them to
the birds.
In addition to this food, six small balls are given to each bird. These
balls are the size of a berry, and consist of:
</bodyText>
<figure confidence="0.9455805" page_id="58091585"  page_num="Page 148" year="" vol="">
1 chopped banana (this also holds the other dry ingredients
together) ;
1 spoonful of rennet ;
Several minerals and vitamins and wheat germ meal ;
1 grated carrot ;
4 teaspoonfuls of insectivorous food.
</figure>
<bodyText confidence="0.977311307692308" page_id="58091585"  page_num="Page 148" year="" vol="">
Each bird is provided with ten mealworms daily.
Finally, twice a week, each bird is given one very young naked
mouse.
This morning food, of which the grated carrot is very important
with regard to retaining the colour, is replaced at 3 o'clock in the
afternoon by a bowl of chopped grapes, banana, and other fruit,
as we found that the birds so greatly prefer grapes they should
never be omitted.
The left-overs of the morning food can be given the same day to
other insectivorous birds, but may under no circumstances again be
given to the Cock-of-the-Rock on the following day. The preparation
of this food is rather elaborate, but it must be done each day, so that
the bird has a fresh supply daily.

A number of rare and interesting birds have been received in the
Gardens during the past two months. Those new to the Collection
are a Bronze-winged Jacana (Metopidius indicus) and a Malaysian
Black-naped Onole ( Onolus chinensis maculatus ), both presented by
bqdr.-Ldr. K. C. Searle ; a pair of Southern Brown-headed Parrots
(roicephalus cryptoxanthus) presented by Mr. E. H. Hawke ; a Black-
throated Chukor ( Alectoris graeca philbyi) presented by Mrs. Drummond
and a Red-headed Manakin ( Pipra rubrocapilla ) purchased.
Unfortunately the Jacana arrived with a badly injured leg which
did not respond to treatment, and the bird had to be destroyed. The
race of Brown-headed Parrot that had previously been in the Gardens
is the Zanzibar one, P. c. Zanzibaricus or P. fuscicapillus as it used to
be called. The Black-throated Chukor was first described in 1934 :

A young Coucal, not yet identified, has been presented by Mr. E. T.

A fine male Masai Ostrich and two Maccaroni Penguins have
been received in exchange, and four Speckled Pigeons, or Triangular
Spotted Pigeons as they used to be called, and two Cape Doves have
been deposited.
Three Black-footed Penguins have been bred in the Gardens.
Many of the usual birds are nesting and two unusual ones--the
Cormorants and the Grey-headed Gallinules. The Cereopsis Goose
eggs were infertile as were, yet again, the Emus.
Some of the " homing Budgerigars have been coming out from

Captain Gustaf Lilliehook, formerly of Skansen Zoo, relates an
interesting experience. Some years ago, two young Eagle-Owls
(Bubo bubo ) about four or five weeks old, were found in a forest some
distance from Stockholm. Evidently they had been abandoned by
their parents, so they were taken to the Zoo. As soon as they were
put in the large owl aviary a number of the old owls gathered round
the chicks and soon began to feed them. They continued to care for
the young ones until they were able to fend for themselves.

The first edition of Records of Birds of Prey Bred in Captivity was publish-
ed in 1950, and exhausted by the end of 1951. The second edition, which
fills an urgent need, is revised and enlarged, and the records of each
species are given as far as possible in narrative form. The author
states that some of the quotations, which are given exactly as repro-
duced, may appear over-long. But as many of the works quoted are
scarce and difficult of access, this cannot in any way be considered
a drawback. Forty-six species are included, by far the greatest
majority being Owls, birds which have always been the most popular
among the birds of prey in captivity.
Mr. Prestwich has added another excellent and valuable work to
his volumes on birds in captivity, and this book will undoubtedly
meet with the same great success as the first edition.

Since my notes on the above appeared in the December, 1954, issue of the Magazine,

to members. Previous to this I had, as stated, not given nectar to Tanagers, etc.
other than with the use of sponge cake. I have now had further opportunity, and
have tried Tariagers with a small jar of nectar in addition to my normal food, orange
insectivoroiis food, sponge cake, etc., and I find that Scarlet Tanagers, Black Tanagers,

readily, I have had Golden-fronted, Hardwicke's, and Jerdon's, and they all relish
this tood. It appears from these and previous tests that the large majority of fruit-

hopes, having cured the CAT menace with the electric fencer, alas, from now on
the weather must take the blame for all failures, and in the case of last year's sample

Of the two pairs of Plum-heads, one pair reared one youngster to ten days, and
then unfortunately lost it, owing to a severe drop in temperature and the fact it was
on its own and not being brooded by then ; they had three eggs in their clutch, two
hatched, one being found in the flight soon after. The other pair, as in the previous
year, had a clutch of five eggs, all infertile. Of the two pairs of Many-colours, one
pair had three fertile eggs, which most disappointingly the hen deserted as they were
due to hatch ; the other pair, 1953-bred, the hen became eggbound, but recovered
on being brought indoors and subjected to heat, laid one egg, and ceased to have
any further interest in matrimony for the rest of the season.
Bairaband s produced one very fine youngster, a hen, sole survivor of a brood of
three ; the other two were lost owing to torrential rain and a drop in temperature
of 15 degrees, so much water had entered the nest-box the nest had to be changed,
but this had no ill-effect on the surviving youngster. Rock Peplars, one of the most
charming of Parrakeets, reared one youngster, a cock ; this was also rescued and
the nest changed, and at the same time three infertile eggs were disposed of. The
other pair, 1953-bred, were not given a nest-box, being too young for breeding
A few Cockatiels were bred. &amp; s
Bourke s were of particular interest inasmuch, as one youngster, of a number
bred, was of very bright colour, the back and wings being yellow and pink, the head
yellow, not pretty but should have great possibilities for breeding. E. N. T. Vane
had a similar coloured bird turn up in his aviaries, which he kindly allowed me to
have in the hope they would prove a pair, and thereby produce more unusual colours.
A few Gouldians were bred, but the results are not all they should be, owing to
squabbling between the pairs, despite numerous nest-boxes of the same type being
provided, in the hopes of avoiding just this, so there is evidently no answer but cage
breeding, which I do not favour.

CORRESPONDENCE
A RARE AMAZON
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.96242065" page_id="58091591"  page_num="Page 154" year="" vol="">
It is not often that one picks up a rare bird in one's local pet shop, but I had
this unexpected experience not long ago. I was passing the shop in question, when
I noticed in the window a small parrot which I could not quite place. It looked
as though it might possibly be a small and very immature Cuban Amazon, and as
we have several adult Cubans, and as it seemed so desperately timid, falling off its
perch if one approached its cage, I decided to buy it. It has now been at Keston
for about two years, and though it has come into lovely condition in an outdoor
aviary, it remains very dull-coloured for an Amazon.
From the description in Tavistock's Parrots and Parrot-like Birds, it would seem
that it is the Jamaican or Red-throated Amazon (Amazona collaria), although I should
have said that our bird, which is much smaller than a Blue-fronted, is more like
io than 12 inches in length. They are described as " rare in captivity ".
It is now an active little bird and a strong flier, with a distinctive medley of cries
quite unlike those of the larger Amazons, and is much steadier than it was, now it
has regained its powers of flight. Although I don't know its sex, I would like to try
and get it a mate, so should be interested to hear from any member of the Society
who might, by chance, have one of these Amazons for disposal.

MARKED WHITE ZEBRA FINCHES

<bodyText confidence="0.974618105263158" page_id="58091591"  page_num="Page 154" year="" vol="">
If Mr. N. V. Whitehouse had taken the trouble to refer to my article on the new
Zebra Finch mutation he would have seen that I did not call them Chestnut Flanked
Zebras ", but Chestnut-flanked White Zebra Finches ; and the obvious error in my
last article (in which ts White " was omitted) cannot have caused his concern, since
this article and his letter appeared simultaneously in the Magazine.
Furthermore, a glance at the photograph accompanying my original article, of
one of our pairs of these birds with the markings clearly shown, would have rendered
unnecessary his discourteous and quite uncalled-for remarks about " stock ... of
very poor quality ", and " When Mr. Boosey seees some good specimens ".
Incidentally, as Mr. Whitehouse claims to be the originator of this variety, and
as we were their original importers from Australia into this country, it is obvious
that our stock which he " must assume ... is of very poor quality " must either be
birds of his own breeding, or their direct descendants. Thus his derogatory remarks
about them bear a striking resemblance to another Australian invention the
boomerang !
As to the naming of this mutation, I should have thought that instead of merely
indulging in destructive criticism of other people's efforts in this direction, it would
have been more to the point if Mr. Whitehouse had found a suitable name for them
himself.

By A. A. Prestwich (Southgate, England)
The Caiques are a small group of short-tailed, South American
parrots of the genus Pionites. Some authorities, including Count
Salvadori (1891) who, however, later (1906) accepted, even if
grudgingly, the verdict of Dr. Sharpe and Hellmayr, persisted in using
the generic name Caica. Peters (193 7 ) gives a very concise explanation
why Caica cannot be used for this genus. He writes :
Pionites Heine is a substitute name for " Caica Lesson 1831 ",
which however was then employed only in the vernacular sense,
Les Caicas , for a group of four species viz--Psittacus pileatus
Gmelin, Psittacus vulturinus Kuhl, Psittacus melanocephalus Linne
and Psittacus leucogaster Kuhl. Lesson did not use Caica in a
nomenclatural sense until 1842, and when he did so it was for a
species quite different from any of the foregoing. Bonaparte
used Caica in 1850 as the generic name of Psittacus melanocephalus
Linne, but this action was of course invalid by reason of Caica

Narrative
The first notice of any bird in this group is in 1751, when George
Edwards, Library-Keeper to the Royal College of Physicians, gives
a very creditable coloured drawing of a parrot he describes as the
" White-breasted Parrot ". After a somewhat quaint, but neverthe-
less accurate, description, Edwards writes of his subject :
" I found this Bird in the Hands of a Dealer in Foreign Birds,
who kept a Publick House in White-Hart Yard , near the Strand ,
Lo?idon. He assur'd me it was brought from the Carraccos, on the
Continent of America, a Part of the Spanish Dominions. I have
examined all the Accounts I can find relating to Parrots in
different Authors, but can find none that agree with the above-
described. It is a very beautiful little Parrot, and being in all
Probability a Non-descript, I hope it will be thought worth
Publication."
Buffon describes (1779) and gives a painting (1783) of what he calls
" La petite Perruche Maypouri, de Cayenne ".
In explanation he tells us (a free translation) :
" This name suits this bird very well, because it whistles like
the tapir, which in Cayenne is called maipouri; and although there
is an enormous difference between this large quadruped and this
little bird, the whistle is so similar one could mistake it."
He goes on to say :
" it does not come near human habitations and usually keeps to
woods surrounded by water, and even the trees of flooded

savannas ; it makes no other sound than its shrill whistle which
if often lepeats in flight, and it never learns to talk.
As a rule they fly in small flocks, but often without attachment
or each other, for they fight frequently and unmercifully : when
some are caught while hunting, there is no means of keeping
them alive ; they stubbornly refuse to take food and rather
starve to death ; they are so stubborn that they cannot even be
made docile by blowing tobacco smoke, which is the usual way
of training even the most obstinate parrots. If they are to be
reared they must be caught young, and they would not be worth
the. trouble of rearing, if their plumage were not so beautiful and
their form so remarkable."
Various later writers include, with and without acknowledgment,
Buffon s field-notes , whole or in part. It would be of interest to
know the source of his information, as it is unlikely to have been
first-hand.
The majority of the great ornithologists of the late eighteenth
and early nineteenth centuries included this species in their works.
The principal are :
Linne.(i 758) responsible for the specific name when he describes
the species as Psittacus melanocephalus.
Bnsson (1760) calls it Psittacus Mexicanus pectore albo and Le
Perroquet a poitrine blanche du Mexique.
Latham (1781, 1790, 1822) refers to it as the White-breasted
Parrot, and repeats much of what Buffon has told us.
Miller and Shaw (1796) give a good coloured plate of Psittacus
atricapillus, .here said to be a variety of P. melanocephalus Linnaeus.
In this variety the hind-part of the neck . . . is of a pale crimson,
or rose-colour ". Then follows a summary of Buffon's " field-notes".
Levaillant (1805) deals exhaustively with Le Perroquet Maipouri ,
and gives two coloured plates, male and immature--in the latter
the feathers of the breast are shown as of a greyish-white with
orange scalloping to the edges ; the tail and vent, light brown
with greenish scalloping ; and the nape, crown, and throat, all
scalloped with green : and, of course, Buffon's observations are
given.
Brehm (1842) gives a condensed version of Buffon and

Reference should also be made to Shaw (1812) White-breastecl
Parrot ; Vieillot (1817) La Perriche maipouri ; Kuhl (1820) P. melano-

During the following fifty years there are, of course, many references
to this Caique but they are, in the main, just references and none is
very informative.

It is left to Sclater (1887), writing on British Guiana and its birds, to
express an opinion differing from Buffon's. He writes :
" The Caica [melanocephala ] is remarkable for its excessive
friendliness and sociability. I brought a specimen of it home
with me, which is certainly the tamest bird I have ever come
across."
And Lloyd (1895) concurs when he says :
" Caica melanocephala is one of our handsome little parrots that
takes readily to domestication, becoming very affectionate,
allowing itself to be handled and petted without the slightest
resentment. It is particularly plentiful on the Mazaruni and
Puruni Rivers, where it nests in holes high up the trunks of
trees. We have often tried to get at the eggs, but could never
succeed."
It does seem a little remarkable that American Museums of Natural
History are able to publish volumes of six or seven hundred pages on
the birds of various South American countries, and yet tell us little or
nothing of the habits of the birds catalogued. They are, in fact, mainly
just distributional lists of where specimens, often many, have been
procured.

Narrative
Psittacus leucogaster was first described by Kuhl (1820) after Illiger.
The first coloured plate is by Lear (1832) when he depicts Psittacus
badiceps , Bay-headed Parrot. There is no description but the plate
shows a White-bellied Caique with the forehead and crown chestnut-
brown.

Bourjot Saint-Hilaire (1837-38), in the third (supplementary)
volume of Levaillant's monograph of the parrots, gives a good plate by
M. \\erner of Le Penoquet a venire blanc (Psittacus leucogaster) which he
considers a mere variety of melanocephala.
von Pelzeln (1865) expresses the view that P. xanthomeria and
P. leucogaster are only varieties of P. melanocephala . Dr. Finsch (1868)
maintains they are independent species, stating that colourings make
it problematic whether they are varieties or birds of different ages.
ater, von Pelzeln (1871) admits that P. leucogaster may be considered
an independent species, but still considers it not improbable that
P. xanthomeria is only a variety of P. melanocephala or of P. leucogaster.
Yellow-thighed Caique Pionites leucogaster xanthomeria.
Characteristics
Adult.--Mery much like C. leucogaster, from which it differs in having
the thighs and flanks lemon-yellow instead of green (Salvadori).
Distribution
Eastern Ecuador and eastern Peru to the Rio Machados western
Brazil (Peters).
Narrative
Dr. Sclater (1857) c On a Collection of Birds transmitted by
Mr. H. W. Bates from the Upper Amazon " writes :
This apparently new species, of which the only two specimens
sent have passed into the collection of the British Museum, closely
resembles C. leucogastra , Kuhl ( badiceps , Lear), but has the flanks
and thighs yellow instead of green, and exhibits some minor
variations in shades of colouring."
But for brief notices which raised doubts as to the validity of the species
this Caique was virtually still unknown when (( Two specimens of the
rare Yellow-throated Parrot, Caica xanthomera (G. R. Gray), . . . along
with the Pygmy Marmoset, also quite new to the collection " of the
Zoological Society of London arrived on 27th April, 1877. Two years
later Dr. Sclater (1879) refers to these birds when he writes :
Of this beautiful Parrot \Caica xanthomera ] we received two
living examples from Yquitos, on the Peruvian Amazons, in 1877,
as already recorded. One of these is dead ; but the other is now
in fine plumage, as the accompanying sketch by Mr. Smit
(Plate xxviii) will show. Besides the type in the British Museum,
from the Rio Javari (Bates), and a single example obtained alive
by Natterer on the Madeira (Pelz. Orn. Bras. p. 264), our
specimens are, I believe, the only ones known of this species."

Pallid Caique Pionites melanocephala pallida.
Characteristics
Similar to C. melanocephala , but with the thighs, flanks, and also the
under tail-coverts paler, lemon-yellow, with no orange tinge
(Salvadori).
Distribution
Eastern Colombia to eastern Peru (Peters).
Narrative
von Berlepsch (1889) says (a free translation) :
" The birds of eastern Peru and eastern Ecuador differ from

those of Trinidad (which presumably are to be regarded as types)
and Guiana by the much brighter, almost citron-yellow colouring
of the hypochondria and tibia, which in the birds from Trinidad
and Guiana are more or less orange-red or salmon coloured. The
throats and sides of the head and subcaudal feathers are also more
brightly yellow in the birds of the upper Amazon. These should
perhaps be separated as C. melanocephala pallida Berl.".
Reference to Trinidad is, to say the least, a little puzzling.
Count Salvadori (1891) pronounces :
" As the differences pointed out by Graf von Berlepsch as
distinctive of the birds from E. Peru and E. Ecuador seem
constant, I have been induced to regard them as belonging to
a distinct species " [ Caica pallida ].
Between 1875 and 1880 Stolzmann explored very extensively in
Peru, and is responsible for many of the observations in Taczanowski's
Ornithologie du Pe&amp;apos;rou (1884-86). Of Caica melanocephala (actually
P. m. pallida ) he says (a free translation) :
" Not very numerous at Yurimaguas, keeping together in small
flocks composed of a few pairs. It appears that when eating on a
tree they place a sentinel, for on two occasions I have seen a single
bird perched on top of a tree in complete inactivity, while the
whole flock was occupied. On flying away they produce a loud
cry, tschirli-tschirli. While they are resting in the crown of a tree,
an individual can be heard to make strange, single sounds which
are not very harmonious. According to the inhabitants of the
district it nests in the holes of trees. At the end of April I have
seen young ones in full plumage.
Tn the sierra of northern Peru they are often reared in captivity
and are valued much more than all the other parrots. I must
confess that of the large number of domesticated parrots I have
seen during my travels, I have never seen any as pleasing or so

amusing. For several months I reared a pair and I brought one of
them to Europe ; these are my observations about these
individuals. They are as sociable as other parrots ; when they
have no companion of their own species in captivity they soon
attach themselves to some other parrot, even if it is much larger.
When one of mine was stolen before my departure for Europe,
the other became attached to a Chrysotis which it never left. As
soon as they weie separated, the Caica used to call his companion
by producing a plaintive sound, piou. Their movements are quick
and precise ; on the ground it runs more quickly than all the
other parrots, hopping to quicken its pace. It climbs on sloping
branches with great skill, without using its beak like the others.
It eats everything : rice, potatoes, flax seeds, bananas, cherries,
meat, etc., preferring above all meat and rice. Grasping the food
in one claw, it holds it far from its body and lifts it up much more
than other parrots, which gives it a steady and firm footing.
It had an antipathy to women and children which developed
during the voyage to Europe. As soon as it caught sight of
them it came down from its perch and approached in order to
bite the hated person. Once it bit a dwarf, mistaking him for
a child.. With men it lived on the best of terms and only used
its beak in exceptional cases. It was very fond of playing with the
other parrots, chasing them, seizing their feet, and hopping
round them in a most comical manner when this occurred on
the ground.
It hated all the small species of parrots and on the other
hand was afraid of the Aras. The Brotogerys which were reared
with it used to run away from it and at every opportunity it
used to bite and molest them.
They learn to whistle perfectly but are not capable of grasping
any melody ; the scale of their voice is fairly extensive and their
whistling is very pure. As soon as one begins to whistle at them,
they seize the notes, but interpret the melody in their own way j
they conclude without any discord the melodies started for them,
but always in their own style. It whistles in all positions, perched,
lying on its back, hanging head down from a branch, always with
the same ease and always with the same purity and intensity.
At Yui imaguas I noticed that they liked to whistle at the approach
of a storm ; sometimes it is difficult to persuade them to whistle.
They learn to pronounce piouitschou , but in a louder voice than
the Brotogerys.
I observed that they have a liking for passing through narrow
openings. When there is a wide entrance, an open door, and a
narrow opening at the side, they prefer to choose the latter, often
turning the body sideways and spreading out their wings to

reduce their circumference. The inhabitants of the country assert
that they spend the night in the holes of trees, which is likely,
since in captivity they do not like sleeping on a perch. Mine
used to sleep in a box or under a pot. When they are placed
there for the night they begin to whistle and chatter.
The inhabitants teach them to dance. In the evening they
put them on a table illuminated by a candle and sing or whistle
while clapping their hands ; the parrots hop to this noise. For
such a dancing parrot one pays there from 40 to 50 francs."
Pionites leucogaster xanthurus.
Characteristics
Pileum, sides of the head (down to and including the auriculars),
hind-neck, and sides of the neck dull apricot orange ; back, rump,
upper tail-coverts, upper wing-coverts, and secondaries externally
bright parrot green ; tail deep chrome to primuline yellow, some of
the rectrices with a basal area of parrot green, concealed except on
the middle pair ; primaries and their coverts with the inner webs
black, and the outer webs Berlin blue with a narrow outer margin of
green ; under wing-coverts parrot green, the carpal edge mixed with
yellow ; throat, cheeks, and sides of the neck below empire yellow ;
breast and abdomen soiled white, with a wash of pale yellow in fresh
plumage, the sides shaded with light salmon orange ; tibke and under
tail-coverts empire yellow ; " iris cadmium yellow ; eyelids white ;
feet flesh white ; bill bone white." Wing (type), 141 ; tail, 79 ;
bill, 25 ; tarsus, 16 (Todd).
Distribution
Rio Purus, Brazil (Todd).
Narrative
During the early ig2o's the Carnegie Museum received several
collections of Brazilian birds from Samuel M. Klages. Included were
three specimens of a Caique considered by Todd (1925) to be new,
and described and named by him Pionites xanthurus. No mention of
this sub-species is made by either Peters (1937) or Pinto (1938) and
one can but conclude that neither recognizes it.
Todd writes of xanthurus :
" This species is obviously the Rio Purus representative of
P. xanthomeria (Sclater), which it closely resembles in all respects
except for the color of the tail, which is mostly yellow instead of
green, the shafts of the feathers being white. We have three
specimens, a pair in worn plumage from Hyutanahan, and a
single female in fresh feather from Nova Olinda, which latter

has been selected as the type. The single male shows even less
green on the basal part of the tail than either of the females."
There is, as yet, no vernacular name for this sub-species.
In captivity
Importation .--Although the Caiques occur over a very wide area
they are seen seldom enough in captivity to fetch a relatively high
price. They have never been imported in any number, merely a
pair or an odd bird at very irregular intervals--this applies to
Great Britain, at least.
Black-headed Caique.-- The " White-breasted Parrot " found by
Edwards in about 175* in the hands of a publican-dealer was pre-
sumably a live bird, in which event it is by far the earliest recorded
importation of a Caique of any species.
The Zoological Society of London purchased an example in 1855
and two in 1866, and since then has owned a good many, mainly
single birds.
During the last thirty or forty years there have been pairs in most
of the larger private collections--H. D. Astley, H. Whitley, J. Spedan
Lewis, Mrs. G. T. Clark, and others.
This Caique is not uncommonly kept in the United States where,
in some regions, it is known by the not inappropriate name " Little
Breeches ", or as " Dirty Face ".
Pallid Caique. The Zoological Society of London purchased a
bird listed as Caica melanocephala (Pale variety) on 3rd November,
1891. This was presumably a specimen of pallida.
White-bellied Caique. This is the most commonly imported
species. A specimen was purchased by the Zoological Society of
London on 13th October, 1880, and a second on 4th April, 1883.
Since then there have, of course, been others in the Gardens.
Pairs have been in the collections of Mrs. Dalton Burgess, H. Whitley,
J. Spedan Lewis, etc. ; and Miss Kay Bonner has a pair at present.

collections, but there were fairly frequent, small importations in
the 1920's and early 1930's.
Character. Buffon did the whole genus a great injustice when he
implied its members were intractable. I think everyone who has ever
possessed a Caique will agree they are amongst the most desirable
of all species of parrots. They are very intelligent, even more playful
and amusing than some of the very playful lorikeets and, when tamed,
are most affectionate. Some, however, fail to advance beyond the
merely friendly stage, remaining very nervous, and refuse any undue
human familiarities.

A. A. PRESTWICH-CAIQUES
Being very active birds they should not be confined permanently in
parrot cages. They are best suited to aviary life, or at least have an
outside flight in which they can exercise.
Much could be written about their general behaviour : the dignified
manner, holding themselves very upright, in which they walk along a
branch ; the way they hang from a branch or wire-netting by their
beaks only and while thus suspended in the air box and spar ; how
they wrestle on the ground, rolling over and over and playing gener-
ally like a couple of kittens--all of which must be seen to be properly
appreciated.
The Caique would indeed be the perfect pet but for one very great
drawback--its voice. Its cry is loud and can perhaps best be described
as a shrill whistling-shriek. They delight in uttering it repeatedly
and often for minutes on end ; such is its shrillness that even their
greatest admirers must admit it is very trying indeed, so much so that
it is virtually impossible to keep a pair in a house, although a single
bird would naturally prove less noisy and there might even be an
occasional very tame specimen that has been taught to forget this
distressing form of vocal expression.
They are credited with being very sensitive to cold, but once fully
acclimatized they seem reasonably hardy. They should, however,
always be shut in their shelters at night and in the winter artificial
heat must be provided : we maintain a minimum temperature of
50* F. Naturally, they need warmth and plenty of care when newly
imported.
Food presents no difficulties. In theory they should be fed on a
varied seed mixture consisting of four parts sunflower seed, three
parts canary seed, two parts oats, two parts buckwheat, one part
white millet, one part hemp, and a few peanuts : but preferring
sunflower seed to all other they will most probably, in the usual
parrot manner, pick this out and scatter most of the rest. Actually,
we have not found that almost unlimited sunflower has had any
harmful effect. It is, however, very important that they have plenty
of good, sound fruit--soft, sweet apple and grapes being the favourites.
Garden peas in the pod are a welcome addition when in season and
an occasional soaked millet spray is appreciated.
Breeding .--Caiques pair readily in confinement but aviculturists
have had little success in breeding them. This is probably mainly due
to lack of effort, few having experimented in this direction. Sexing
presents a matter of considerable difficulty. The sexes are identical
as regards plumage and the only difference lies in the beak. When
compared the beak of the male is seen to be broader and rather
shorter than that of the female which has altogether a more " hennish "
appearance. But this comparison is not easy and requires experience
in such things.

The only recorded breeding success in Great Britain is Lady
Poltimore's hybrid, Black-headed x White-bellied Caique, reared in
1936. In this event four young were hatched ; two died within a few
days, one lived for six or seven weeks, and one was reared : " exactly
like the male in plumage, except that his thighs are green like the
female, and he has more of her salmon colour at the back of his neck.
At a distance, it is difficult to distinguish him from his male parent,
and his colour and plumage are as good as that of the adult pair "
(Poltimore, 1936). The young one proved to be a male and lived
for nearly two years.
. In the Umted States, Gilbert Lee, of Los Angeles, has been successful
in breeding the White-bellied Caique. He had three young ones
hatched on 1st, 2nd, and 5th April, 1932, and all three were fully
reared (Lee, 1935).
Expectation of life. The potential longevity of Psittacine birds is
well known to be high, although well-authenticated records are
considerably lower than the ages assigned by popular repute. Exact
records for P ionites are few, but it is certain the maximum age is con-
siderably in excess of any mentioned here.

Dr. Mitchell points out that, in the period covered, the examples
of the Psittaci group " were kept in a rather crowded house, well
warmed in cold weather. A certain number of them were placed out
of doors (chiefly Macaws and Cockatoos) in good weather, but were
chained to perches. The vast majority of them were in relatively small
cages, and never had access to open air, whilst none had the oppor-
tunity of flying ". The conditions under which the Caiques were
apparently kept cannot be said to have been conducive to health.
The wonder is that one Yellow-thighed managed to attain an age
of over twenty years in captivity.
Records for the period 1911 to 1926 are not readily accessible, but
search reveals that Black-headed died in 1917 and 1918 after 125
and 147 months respectively. The later records show that nine
examples died in the Gardens between 1934 and 1946. The present
Parrot House was opened in 1930 and no matter what one's opinion
of it there is no gainsaying the conditions are vastly superior to those
obtaining in the old. The later period shows an improvement of
approximately 20 per cent in the average for the whole genus, and

the improved conditions must in part be responsible for this. It
must be stressed that these figures refer only to the birds' life in the
Zoo. It is very difficult to draw any conclusions because almost
invariably little or nothing is known of their previous history : some
are undoubtedly newly-imported, whereas others have probably been
pets for a number of years. For instance, the Yellow-thighed listed
below is said to have been in the possession of W. W. Cobbett for
some thirty-five years prior to its being presented : if indeed, a fact,
this would make it at least forty-two years old at the time of its death.

10th June, 1923, after being in the Giza Zoological Gardens, Cairo,
for 13 years, 7 months, 8 days.
A Yellow-thighed lived in the Philadelphia Zoo Gardens for 9 years
and 8 months, dying in 1924 ; and another, in the National Zoo Park,
Washington, was still alive in 1929, after 6 years and 10 months.
The fully authenticated record, however, must surely be held by
the pair that successfully reared a young hybrid for Lady Poltimore in
1936. They are still alive and flourishing, after being in Lady Polti-
more's possession since the spring of 1931, prior to which Miss E. M.
Knobel had them for several years. They cannot therefore be far short
of thirty years of age.
Bibliography
In this review of the genus Pionites no attempt has been made to cite
every paper mentioning or discussing it. To do so would entail a
bibliography of very considerable length. Such were formerly thought
to reflect the learning of authors but nowadays are mainly a source
of annoyance ; in addition, their compilation may be considered a
waste of time and money. The literature has, however, been searched
very thoroughly and the following are the more important references.

OBSERVATIONS ON A BLACK WOODPECKER
IN CAPTIVITY, ITS PERCEPTION OF FOOD
THROUGH LAYERS OF WOOD
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.992502925" page_id="58091611"  page_num="Page 168" year="" vol="">
By Eugenio Callegari (Ravenna, Italy)
About the middle of June, 1954, I found the nest of a Black Wood-
pecker (Dryocopus martius , L.) in the valley of Genoa, about 1,600
metres above sea-level. It was in an old beech tree, not 4 metres
above the ground, and contained two fledglings. One was within the
hollow, the other was leaning out as far as its abdomen, and stood
as stiff as stiff could be, hoping to escape my notice. I lay in wait
behind a rock to identify, if possible, the food brought by their parents,
a matter of great difficulty, as they swallow most of it--only the last
morsels being visible stuck in their beaks.
As soon as the fledgling thought it was alone it drew back, and
twenty minutes afterwards one of the parents appeared. When it
noticed me it at once gave out its alarm note, but did not draw near,
thus making the identification of the food quite impossible.
Fearing that the young ones might abandon their nest (their
feathers being almost completely developed) I hastened to catch
them, and started back to Ravenna to try to bring them up.
My first care was to inspect their excrement with a view to finding
out what would be suitable food. This consisted partly of chitinous
remains of big, black ants, of the genus Camponotus Mayr., which
make their nests in old trees, and partly digested matter, probably
derived from larval stages of the same. I did not, however, deem it
necessary to feed them on their natural food, but I replaced it by
mole-crickets at first, and then by a mixture of dry ant-pupae, some
meal derived from silk-worm larvae, tiny bits of ox heart, bread, and
milk.
The two creatures, however, were shy and had to be fed artificially,
the food being forcibly thrust down their throats. They showed a
dislike for this food and also for living silkworms. Then I noticed
that one of them was suffering from bad diarrhoea and had got very
thin. I then made up my mind to catch wood-boring ants, my only
hope of saving the young birds from certain death. To begin with
I found this very difficult, but little by little I got into the way of it,
and was encouraged in this odd job of wood-cutter by the fact that
the youngsters began to welcome the ants and still more their pupae.
So in the long run they became tamer and even seemed inclined to
swallow the pincers with which I fed them.
In about a month the sick bird increased in weight, strength, and
liveliness and became quite normal. I placed them in a comfortable
aviary, with trunks for perching ; they recognized my step and my

brother s ; called to us when hungry, though inclined to be shy in
our presence, d hey gave a trill of joy at our entrance, but when we
stretched out our hands towards them often grew suspicious and
drew back without taking the food. They were even more suspicious
with strangers.
When they had completely recovered I fed them again on the
usual mixed food, but shortly afterwards the other bird had diarrhoea
trouble too. I hastened to gather Camponotus pupae, but it was no use ;
four days later it died. I felt very sorry, for Woodpeckers are more
charming than most birds.
As regards the diarrhoea troubles from which both birds suffered,
I ascribe them to food fermentations due to the heat of summer!
I therefore prepared fresh food twice a day, and the surviving Wood-
pecker is still in perfect health. I feared they might suffer from the
heat, but could not prove this.
Ginanni, in his work on Ravenna's pine woods, not only states
that these birds haunt this zone, but breed in it as well. Before
coming to the point, I want to state that I gave the two Woodpeckers
various kinds of Lamellicorne coleoptera larvae, Cetonia, Melolonta ,
and some others not yet identified, which they consistently refused.
On the other hand, they seemed to welcome either larvae or nymphae,
of Cerambycide coleoptera. They also refused either fresh or dried fruit!
When out for a walk one day towards the end of October I happened
to come across two small stumps, which I uprooted easily. The stumps
were intersected by a maze of burrows, containing the appetizing
ants, which I offered my captive bird. The Woodpecker approached,
rubbed its long verniform tongue over the burrows, and drew out its
favourite ants. A few days later it showed no further interest in the
two stumps, though many burrows had not been inspected. The only
thing I could do was to remove them from the cage. In order to
satisfy my curiosity, I then cut them to pieces with a hatchet, and
was surprised to find only one ant left.
. P n anot h er occasion I gave the bird a bigger stump to inspect, but
it behaved in just the same way. It started rubbing its tongue over it
just as before, and taking no heed of the burrows leading outside, and
cut holes exactly where the ants were to be found. But after a while
this stump too was no further use, and when I cut it to pieces not one
ant was found, in spite of the spaces left unexplored by the taps of the
Woodpecker.
I applied to Dr. Branzanti, delV Ufficio Agricolo Patrimoniale, who
indly ga\ e me permission to take from the pine woods as many
stumps and poles attacked by ants as I wanted. The results were
just the same. Even when I put stumps of about a hundredweight
each in the aviary, after a certain time the Woodpecker ceased to
e interested in them, and I could but realize that the supply of ants

had either disappeared or was reduced to a few specimens. Very
often the bird reached the hidden prey through layers of wood com-
pletely free from burrows, and still in a perfect state of preservation
on account of the resin permeating them.
I find no hint of this in the works on ornithology at my disposal,
as the various authors are of opinion that the bird locates the prey
by introducing its tongue into the burrows of the grubs. Only in the
work Birds of America , prepared under the auspices of the Audubon
Society, I came across these words : " They locate their hidden
prey with great accuracy, and often cut small holes directly to the
burrows of the grubs."
In short, the hidden prey is located perfectly in the stems of trees by
the tongue, no attention being paid to the outside holes. Woodpeckers
are actually never disappointed in their work.
Let us consider the big clefts bored in the stems of trees by Black
Woodpeckers to reach their prey, clefts often several centimetres deep.
To justify these phenomena we must acknowledge these creatures to
be gifted either with the power of reasoning or with a " sixth sense ".
I entirely reject the former hypothesis and accept the latter, based on
experience.
I cut three poles more or less alike out of a wooden fence, one of
which contained an ants' nest. I stopped the outside holes with beeswax
and placed them simultaneously in the cage. Eight minutes after-
wards the Woodpecker had swallowed its favourite grubs, leaving the
other two poles untouched. After some days, when the ant supply
had failed, it drew out of one of the other two poles some very tiny
xylophagous larvae. I made a small box of fir wood, the sides of which
were three centimetres thick. Inside, by means of partitions, I made
eighteen cells, of which eight contained sawdust, six ants, and four were
empty. The Black Woodpecker inspected the box by rubbing its
tongue over it, and cut directly to one of the cells containing the ants,
close to one of the inside wooden partitions. A short time afterwards
it left off and took no further interest in the box, and further efforts
on my part to get it to search again were useless. Also in vain was my
cutting two little holes with a nail directly to two cells containing
insects. There was nothing left for me to do but take the box out
and replace it with stumps which were at once exploited to the utmost.
I got a tree trunk hollowed out with a lathe, leaving an external thick-
ness of 3 centimetres ; then, with thin wooden partitions, I delimited
seven spaces of 3 centimetres thick each. The inmost space I called
Number 1, and that nearest the end Number 7. The numbers 1-3-6
contained ants, the others were empty or full of sawdust. The Wood-
pecker started cutting a hole directly to Number 4, but it scarcely cut
it, then it moved on to Number 3, cut a first hole, out of which it
seized the ants, then enlarging it, invaded Number 4. I must

emphasize that these spaces were 7 centimetres in diameter, through
which the bird had to thrust its head without spoiling its feathers.
Then it cut another hole in connection with Number 3, angled at
about 40 degrees in respect of the first. Before eating the ants it cut a
hole directly to Number 1, then another angled about 90 degrees in
respect of the hist. During this process it hopped every now and then
to the first hole to eat the ants that were coming out. This would
support the theory of some authors that Woodpeckers, to drive out
insects, tap the tree-stems, and then run to the holes to seize those
that come out.
On the morning of the second day it had located the third space,
Number 6, boring it twice. This time, however, to get at the ants
it cut also the next partitions, but the ants had moved on through
these holes to spaces previously empty. Late in the afternoon I
removed the stump, fearing the bird might hurt itself with the nails,
and detected a third hole in space Number 1, angled about 180 degrees
in respect of the first. Thus the Woodpecker bored eight holes through
sound wood, 3 centimetres thick, one hole being cut uselessly, while
the other seven were of the right size, showing its ability to locate food
with its tongue.
I again took the above-mentioned box, and to attract the attention
of the Woodpecker I enlarged the two holes I have already mentioned
with a big nail, and introduced two live ants. After a short time
the biid noticed, and swallowed one of them, then it started enlarging
the hole I had made. After boring down 2 centimetres it left off,
and resumed working in the direction of the same cell but to one side
of it where the two box sides joined together. After a short time,
however, it left off again. A few minutes later it caught sight of the
second ant and ate it up, then it bored the cell and swallowed the
food within. Afterwards it located a third cell supplied with ants,
and this time too it cut a hole near the inside wooden strip. Then
it left off again for good.
Its bewildei ment misled me too and suggested several hypotheses
to me, the most logical of which I think is that its bewilderment must
depend on the fact that the cells, wherein I had put the ants, were
not full and therefore the air between the ants and the lid acted as
insulator. I changed position in the box so that the ants might be in
contact with the outside walls.
I placed some ants as a bait in the cell it had cut the previous day ;
but the Woodpecker preferred basking in the sun, and the ants went
away. All at once it caught sight of one of them and ate it up. Then
it began to rub its tongue against the box at the point where the
wooden strips joined together, though the tongue was rubbed so
rapidly against the box the bird located the right spot, where it cut a
hole and gained the reward it deserved ; then, again bewildered, left

off for good. I could only replace the box with the usual stumps in
order to keep it in good health for further experiment.
I am thoroughly unacquainted with the nature of the phenomena
guiding the Woodpecker and with the reason for its bewilderment
when confronted with the box. If further experiment should lead me
to a logical hypothesis I will give this information in a further article.

By A. Clarence (Salisbury, Wilts, England)
It was once said that " to be wise too late is the exactest definition
of a fool ", and this, I fear, leaves me well in the running. At any rate
it is very expensive !
The Abyssinian Lovebird has not a pleasant character, but this is
made up for by its handsome appearance. To me it is the most
beautiful of the lovebird family--the cock bird particularly. It was a
master stroke of Nature to draw a line of black the full length of the
wing, and add a scarlet beak and forehead as foil to a viridian green
body.
As to character, woe betide any trusting simpleton. Quietly
sidling up with easy friendly movement, he will quickly bite through
the foot, or leg joint for preference. Even a gentle harmless little
Cayenne Rail did not escape the nastiness of a pair I own, and received
a bite at the main joint of one of its slender legs. I just missed seeing
the assault, but the flowing blood left its trail, and he was soon
caught up. It eventually recovered, but will always limp. On
another occasion, a second sufficed between a Bullfinch having two
legs and one. No wonder a young hen Abyssinian enjoyed scalping
its four defenceless brothers and sisters, while still in the nest, and
this at a carefully chosen moment.
The Abyssinian seems to prefer sunflower to other seed. It is a
fruit-eater, and will eat almost any fruit. It is particularly fond of
sweet apples, and failing anything better if will even eat that sour
horror so beloved of English cooks--the Bramley Seedling, which
not even the wild birds will touch if there is anything else to go for.
When I am obliged to leave my birds to underlings and the mentally
deficient, I thread a dozen apples on a wire and hang them so that
they are reached from below, hoping thereby to induce the birds to
eat the bottom one first. Also a wire of dried figs and another of
dates act as a reserve against lack of observation and forgetfulness.
Very large seed hoppers with glass fronts and an extra hidden water
supply which the birds can see is very essential, and are a relief to
one's mind. Abyssinians are particularly partial to sprouting sun-
flower and oats during the nesting season.

At my old home near Salisbury the Brown Owl is very numerous.
1 hese would plane over the aviaries on silent wing and then let out
a scieech, which has scared the wits out of many a poacher--and
myself. It is quite incredible what a shock that screech can be--
one s hair does stand on end ! This caused the death of one young
Abyssinian, while some years ago six young Splendids met with a
similar fate, flying in their panic against the far wire. There were
nine of them and six were picked up dead in a row at the end of the
aviary with broken skulls. They are, of course, noted for their thin
skulls. The speed with which these particular parrakeets can fly has
to be seen to be believed. On one occasion a cock Splendid escaped.
It was faster than the flash of a Kingfisher--and good-bye.
I had hoped that my Caller-up-in-Chief ", a cock Princess of
Wales, would lure him back, but he was too far off and the wind
unfavourable. The Princess of Wales' penetrating voice steered
home many a budgerigar lost for days and once brought back a
Meyer s Parrot. This Meyer s cut a round hole in strong half-inch mesh
wire, neatly turning over each point so that the exit was smooth and
then disappeared for two days into an orchard.
When obliged to leave birds to the care of other people, I find it
helpful to them to fix a funnel through the wire so that seed can be
poured into its receptacle without their entering the aviary. Par-
ticularly useful is this when dealing with Abyssinians, who are shy
and wild by nature and very secretive when nesting.
It is well to remember to use soft, loose fitting gloves when handling
them, for like bulldogs, when they bite they do not let go.
. A ^ ew Y ears ago I bought a cock Abyssinian and was lucky to be
given a hen. flhe pair were put into a 20 feet aviary, 12 feet high at
the apex. As a protection from the weather they had access to a
small conservatory, which was warmed during the winter. At the
end of the aviary grew a substantial elder bush, which shrub birds
dislike biting, possibly owing to its unpleasant smell when bruised.
Into the apex, and wedged among the branches, was fixed an
upright nesting-box, which was made of one-inch wood. It was
15 inches high and 7 inches square and was filled to a depth of
6 inches with a mixture of sawdust and dry earth compressed_
dryness being essential to warmth in cold, wet weather. Into this a
deep budgerigar nesting bowl of wood was securely embedded. The
box was put up in January for the reason that in the winter months
3. box of smaller and lighter make had been hung in the greenhouse.
The Abyssinians slept in the latter and eventually in December had
a clutch of eggs, which were fertile, but did not hatch, no doubt due
to the hard frosts and to there being insufficient warm material under
the eggs. It was obviously not to their liking, and as soon as the
box in the elder bush was put up they took possession. It was well

hidden and this appealed to their secretive nature. It was also
protected from winds and no rain could get to it. A bundle of hazel
saplings stood nearby in a bucket of water. These the birds chewed
off in small bits and carried into the nest, though so unobtrusively
that no one saw them do it.
The four eggs hatched in due course after a long incubation of
about a month, and eventually the young birds were strong on the
wing.
The same pair started a third nest in the autumn and all seemed
set fair (they seem to breed all the year round). Then I learned
a lesson !
A young hen of the first clutch, now about eight months old, entered
the nest and killed her four fully-fledged brothers and sisters. The
massacre took place no doubt while the parents were feeding in the
conservatory. She was covered with blood and thus stood self-
convicted.
I transferred her to a small aviary with a six-feet flight, where she
met with an unpleasant end, when a Brown Owl drove its long-
reaching talons into her body as she slept against the wire.
There is nothing so expensive as experience !

Among the seed-eaters the Gouldian Finch is one of the most
wonderful. If one, however, sees the great mortality of newly-imported
birds, a fancier feels somewhat uneasy at buying them. But being
lovers of birds and members of the Avicultural Society (Rules of the
Avicultural Society, No. i : ". . . the study of British and foreign
birds in freedom and in captivity "), it is our duty to do everything
possible to determine the causes of these losses and what can be done
to prevent them. Last year I bought a pair of Gouldian Finches out
of a very good-looking importation. As this pair was showing symptoms
of disease, the price was very low. My opinion was, that had the
dealer kept these birds they would have died in a couple of days.
I did everything that could be done to keep them alive. Though my
home is centrally heated, I placed an electric lamp in the cage and
I put honey and some drops of wine in their water to stimulate the
working of the heart. The food was a mixture of all kinds of seeds
(ripe and germinated), combined with cod-liver oil, milk powder,
etc. The result was astonishing, in a few weeks the birds recovered

completely. As they showed signs of broodiness, I placed a small box
and nesting materials in the cage, with the result that the hen laid
four eggs. Only birdlovers can understand my happiness at this
reward of all my trouble. Alas, I had shouted too soon. The same
day that the hen laid her last egg in the nest, the cock became ill and
died in a few days. There was no one particular symptom. One
or two days after the death of the cock, as the female also became
ill and showed all the signs of following the cock, I decided to try to
cure her by giving aureomycin. I had read an item in Die
gefiederte Welt in which the author told of his wonderful cures of birds
in a hopeless condition, by using aureomycin. The dose is i/iooo
gram per io gram body weight, three times a day, during two days.
I had ordered very small pills to be made, each containing i/iooo
gram, and during two days I gave these pills (totalling six). The
result was astonishing, the second day the bird showed signs of
recovery. At this moment the Gouldian is still alive and my friend
and I are trying to mate her with his cock. The eggs we put in the
nest of a pair of fawn Bengalese ; they hatched, but the Bengalese
didn't feed them and after one day this hope also belonged to the
past.
One or two days before my cock died, a cock belonging to my friend
also died. This cock was of the same importation, but was in first class
condition. With the aid of one of my veterinary friends, I sent both
birds to the veterinary school of the University for post-mortem
examination. A most thorough examination was carried out, even
blood cultures were made. The result was negative. It was very
remarkable that the organs of my bird seemed to be in a better
condition than those of the (? healthy) bird of my friend. There is
a possibility that an unknown virus caused the death of the birds.
But in this case the investigator must have some idea where to look
for the virus in order to prepare the right culture medium. I have
observed the wonderful action of aureomycin in the treatment of a
Parson's Finch in a hopeless condition, but I quite understand that
it is impossible to cure a bird suffering from avitaminosis by this
treatment, for in such cases only the correct vitamin is efficacious.
I believe, however, that in severe cases of illness of unknown cause,
aureomycin is worth trying. But in the case of the Gouldians it is
obviously more satisfactory to determine the cause of the illness and
losses.

Members foregathered at Liverpool Street Station on Friday
evening the 3rd June, 1955. Although the railway strike was on,
fortunately our train was running and we caught the night boat to
the Hook of Holland, entraining there for Antwerp, where we
eventually arrived during the morning. We were met at the station
by the Director of the Antwerp Zoo and his wife, Monsieur and
Madame Van den bergh, and conducted to the Zoological Gardens
where a most cordial welcome awaited us from the President,
Monsieur Louis Diercxsens. Replying to his speech of welcome,
Miss Phyllis Barclay-Smith said what great pleasure it gave us all to
be present and how honoured we felt to be the guests of the Societe
Royale de Zoologie d'Anvers.
After lunch we toured the Zoo, Monsieur Van den bergh and
Monsieur Carpentier, the Curator of Birds, acting as our guides.
Naturally, our first visit was to the new Bird House and we were
much impressed by this modern method of displaying birds. No wire
is to be seen, the birds being confined behind plate glass windows,
each cage or enclosure being artistically decorated with natural
perches and growing plants. The cages are lit from the top by daylight,
the visitors themselves being in a darkened hall lit only by the light
from the cages. The effect is quite remarkable and undoubtedly
brings out the full beauty and colouring of the birds. For the first
time I personally saw the operation of the principle of confining birds
by light only. One corridor in this house is completely blacked out,
the cages only being brilliantly lit by artificial means and without any
sort of barrier between the birds and the visitor. The darkened
corridor prevents the birds from leaving their lighted cages. Whilst
I am not quite sure whether this is good aviculture, it is certainly a
most spectacular method of displaying birds and the specimens we saw
appeared in good condition.
Exhibits which stamped themselves on my memory in this house
were a beautiful Quetzal, the first live one I have ever seen, and a
pair of Red Birds of Paradise in the most perfect condition. The house
included a fine collection of Macaws and Cockatoos on stands and
I particularly noticed a pair of White-backed Piping Grows, a species
I have not seen since pre-war days. The larger softbills were well
represented including Toucans, Jay-Thrushes, Touracos, and Glossy
Starlings. There were some nice Humming Birds and Sunbirds and
I noticed several species of Conure which I had not seen before.

One of the features I liked best about Antwerp Zoo was the birds
which were allowed loose about the grounds. We saw Crowned and
Demoiselle Cranes and numerous waterfowl walking unconcernedly
about the lawns, often crossing the pathways frequented by visitors.
A group of some twenty Flamingoes occupied a shallow pond just
inside the main entrance, surrounded by nothing more than a lawn
and a stone wall about 12 inches high. I was assured that they never
leave this enclosure.
The outdoor aviaries were, for the most part, spacious and well
planted and contained a huge variety of birds. A particularly
spectacular aviary must have measured well over 100 feet long by
40 feet wide and 30 feet high. It contained a mixed collection of
Egrets, Gulls, Storks, Gallinules, and even a pair of Occipital Blue
Pies and some Jackdaws. I happened to be passing just at feeding time
and the movement and colour in this aviary were really wonderful.
Another method of exhibiting the larger birds which impressed me
was in a series of outdoor enclosures separated from the public only
by a moat. One could thus see such species as Scarlet Ibis, Marabou
Storks, and other wading birds without any obstruction to the view.
To add to this attraction the moat itself was occupied by various species
of duck. The birds were, of course, pinioned or clipped winged, but
even so, I was surprised that they did not attempt to cross the moat,
which was scarcely more than about six feet in width. The reason is,
evidently, that once the birds have become settled in their enclosures
they do not try to escape.
I think, without doubt, we were all very much impressed with the
remarkably wide and varied bird collection at Antwerp. All the major
groups were represented and the excellent condition of the birds
spoke volumes for the care and attention lavished on them by Monsieur
Carpentier, the Curator of Birds. Our thanks are due to him for all
the time he spent showing us round and his kindness and patience
in answering the numerous questions we put to him.
On Saturday afternoon by the kind invitation of Monsieur Willy
Friling we visited his very fine collection of foreign birds and water-
fowl situated in the beautiful grounds of his estate at Braschaat.
Monsieur Friling and his friend Colonel John Dufour, who, I gather
is partly responsible for the collection, personally conducted us round
the grounds. First we visited the aviaries. The birds have separate
summer and winter quarters. In summer they inhabit outdoor aviaries,
provided only with overhead shelter ; in winter they are transferred
to a huge indoor birdroom which is most efficiently fitted out with
spacious cages. I must say there seems a lot to be said for this form of
aviculture. The birds don't require much shelter in the summer,
except from wind and rain, and in the winter they are probably better
off anyway inside, thanks to our inhospitable northern climate.

Moreover, it is far more pleasant and comfortable from the attendant's
point of view.
I was struck with the attractive way in which each aviary was
planted and decorated. Overhead shelters ran along the back walls
which were painted white, the floor being covered with clean silver
sand. The front and open part of the flights were turfed and planted.
The whole effect was light and pleasant and the birds showed up
extremely well. Monsieur Friling maintains a large collection in
beautiful condition. The number of species is far too great to
mention but the highlights I remember, were Bleeding Heart and
Bronze-winged Pigeons, Glossy Starlings, Occipital Blue Pies, Jay-
Thrushes, and one large aviary which was given over to waders,
including Ruffs, Curlews, and Plover. There were some nice
parrakeets, mainly of the Broadtail family, housed in a range of
aviaries on their own and one enclosure contained an interesting
collection of different species of Mynah.
After the aviaries we saw the waterfowl collection. These inhabit
a beautiful lake in the grounds and have free range over acres of
beautifully kept lawns and grassland. I remember seeing Cranes
dancing in the distance and was surprised to see Flamingoes walking
about the lawns quite a distance away from the water. Many species
of geese and swans were to be seen. The smaller ducks were kept
in a stream which eventually flowed into the lake. All the well-known
species were represented and I particularly noticed a fine pair of
Baikal Teal which I think were the envy of more than one member
of our party.
Afterwards we were entertained to tea by Monsieur Friling and his
daughter and son-in-law, Mr. and Mrs. Martin, who also acted as
hosts. Unfortunately it rained during the whole of our visit ; it was,
in fact, the only wet day we had, but the hospitality and kindness of
Monsieur Friling and his family and his truly wonderful collection of
birds made us forget the weather and we spent a most interesting
and enjoyable afternoon.
On Sunday we visited the " Snepkensvijver " Bird Reserve at
Lichtaart. This is a large stretch of mixed marsh and woodland and
ideal for its purpose, being just the sort of country which most birds
love. In the marsh we saw a breeding colony of Black-headed Gulls
and oui visit could not have been at a more interesting time, as newly
hatched and partly grown chicks could be seen everywhere among the
tufts of grass growing out of the water. Curlews and Lapwings were
abundant and I have never before seen so many Black-tailed Godwits.
A most interesting fact I did not know before was the ability of the
latter to perch in trees. Several times we saw a bird which had been
disturbed from its nest alight in the top of a low growing tree, giving
its alarm call remarkably like that of a Peewit--until we had passed

out of the danger zone. We then followed a path through the woods
and undoubtedly the highlight of the afternoon was seeing a hen
Golden Oriole on her nest slung from the end of a bough in an oak
tree. She never left the nest the whole time we were there and with
the aid of field glasses we had an exceedingly good view of her. Later
we saw a cock bird, but as it was in silhouette against the sky, it was
not possible to see its beautiful colouring although we did hear part
of its song.
Other birds I saw for the first time wild were Great Reed-Warblers
and White-spotted Blue-throats and we were also shown a Cuckoo's
egg in a Blackbird's nest--surely an unusual situation !
Monsieur J. Cuypers, who is the Honorary Warden for this Reserve,
kindly gave up the whole of the afternoon to conducting us round!
His kindness in answering our questions and showing us all the things
which we would never have seen by ourselves, made it far more
interesting than our visit would otherwise have been.
On Monday we went by train to Rotterdam where we were met
at the station by the Director of the Rotterdam Zoo, Mr. van Resema,
who took us straight along to the Zoo. I was impressed again by the
general layout of the Gardens. Rotterdam is an up-to-date Zoo,
having been largely built, I believe, since the war, consequently it
incorporates the modern idea of showing animals and birds in as
natural a setting as possible with the minimum of fencing. The
general idea is to confine the exhibits by means of ditches and low
walls over which the visitor has an uninterrupted view.
There is a remarkably fine collection of Cranes and waterfowl here--
regular flocks of them--and how much better they look when kept
thus, wandering free in large paddocks, than when seen in ones and
twos. Rotterdam Zoo has a fine breeding record and we were not
surprised when we saw the waterfowl breeding establishment. This
consists of a long range of really extensive pens with a canal running
right through the lot of them. Each pen, or enclosure, houses one pair
of ducks or geese, with the result that the maximum number of eggs
and young are obtained. The eggs are collected and hatched in an
incubator and the ducklings are reared in artificial brooders.
I envied Rotterdam Zoo its plentiful water supply from the canals
which meander through the grounds.
Finally, we were taken to the tropical Birdhouse. As a Zoo man I
had already been thrilled to see several species of mammal which I had
never seen before alive, but I was certainly unprepared for the
splendour and size of this house. Going in was just like entering a
tropical jungle and it is so extensive and so carefully laid out that the
visitor appears to wander indefinitely along pathways overhung with
every conceivable kind of tropical plant life. Situated here and there,
and cunningly concealed among the vegetation, are the aviaries con-

taining a magnificent show of birds. The condition of the exhibits
was marvellous. The floors of the cages were covered with silver sand
which seemed spotlessly clean. In fact, the whole atmosphere of the
place was of an extremely well-kept tropical garden.
On show were such rarities as Cock-of-the-Rock, Birds of Paradise,
Roul-roul Partridges, Crowned Pigeons, and some beautiful little
Crocodile Birds which took my fancy. This species is about the size
of a Golden Plover and similar in shape but most strikingly marked in
black, white, French-grey, and cinnamon.
The weather was really beautiful throughout the whole of Monday
and it was so warm in the evening that we actually sat down to dinner
out of doors with Mr. van Resema as our most entertaining and genial
host. This dinner was a wonderful ending to a wonderful week-end,
as that night we had to catch the boat back to England.
Looking back, it seems remarkable that we crowded so much into
three short days and I think it is here fitting to pay tribute and express
our grateful thanks to Monsieur and Madame Diercxsens, Monsieur
and Madame Van den bergh, Monsieur Friling, and Mr. van Resema
for all that they did to make our visit such an unqualified success.
I can only describe their hospitality as lavish and their kindness
unbounded. They did everything they could to make us feel welcome
and it was entirely due to their efforts that we had such a wonderful
time. Personally it was my first visit either to Antwerp or Rotterdam
and if this is an example of Belgian and Dutch hospitality, I am
certainly looking forward to the next.
One final tribute I would like to pay to our Editor, Miss Phyllis
Barclay-Smith, who was responsible for organizing the whole trip.
It was thanks to her that everything went like clockwork. She looked
after us extremely well and I am afraid we must have been a nightmare
to her at times ! Personally, I hate being organized, but Miss Barclay-
Smith did it so well and so pleasantly that we were not even aware
of it. It is no easy matter to get about twenty wayward aviculturists,
each with a mind of his own, to fall into line with a schedule and be
on time to catch 'buses and trains, but she never lost a single member
of her flock once.

4. The Significance of Courtship and Related Behaviour

By a combination of particular positions of ruff \ ears , and neck , and
sometimes wings and body too , the birds can assume a number of charac-
teristic , and often-recurring attitudes, which are the raw materials , so to
speak , of all the habits of courtship. Let us . . . define courtship as a
series of actions based immediately or remotely upon sexual excitement ,
and , to make ourselves clear , we must add that sexual excitement is not
merely sexual desire , but that whole emotional state into which a member
of one sex may be thrown by a member of the other. What is the good of
all these divings and posturings . . . ? To what end are colours and
structures developed solely to be used in them , and what return is got for
the time and energy spent in carrying them out?
Huxley, 1914: 495, 527, and 516.
Some millions of words, of greatly varying quality, have been written
on bird " courtship " since the early observations of such sound workers
as Howard, Huxley and Selous gave impetus to the subject in the
first two decades of this century. Huxley's notable paper on the
Great Crested Grebe was one of the very first to raise the standards
and has remained a most important contribution ever since. Until
recent years, however, a great deal of the subsequent work, both in
this country and in the United States, has been mainly descriptive.
Now we are beginning--if only just beginning--to acquire a deeper
understanding of the mating behaviour of birds, thanks mainly to the
disciplined methods of observation and analysis that the science of
comparative-ethology has given us.
The present section re-examines and extends in general terms the
information on the courtship of the grebe, against the background of
the modern advances in the objective study of bird behaviour. I have
already made brief mention of my views on the meaning of grebe
courtship in previous sections (pp. 10, 145-6), and here I would like
to deal with the " facts and fancies " of such behaviour in more detail,
hastening to add that I trust the " fancies " will not prove to be too
fanciful and to assure the reader that they do have a solid foundation
in fact. It is as well, therefore, to examine some indisputable facts
about the subject first of all. Anyone merely describing grebe court-
ship at the present time does so in a certain air of anti-climax, for it
is now well known, thanks to Huxley, and his own paper should be
read in full to get the thrill of original discovery at first hand. I do

hope, however, that the new theories on the significance of grebe
courtship presented later, as well as the many new facts, will fascinate
the reader as much as they have the writer.
I have used the term " courtship " only for those " sexual " displays
and ceremonies which are not directly to do with coition; after all we
use the word in the same sense when referring to human affairs of a
similar nature. The joint ceremonies of male and female are the
most conspicuous features of grebe courtship. By " ceremonies," I
mean the same as Huxley did by "habits of courtship": fixed,
conventional sets of displays. There are six main displays (Huxley's
" attitudes ") which are common to both sexes, and combinations of
these make up the four main ceremonies. Each display will be
described briefly immediately below, and the ceremonies afterwards.
Huxley's account was so detailed that I have included only those
descriptive facts necessary for interest, expansion, and subsequent
discussion. These have been taken from my own notes mainly, but I
have directly quoted relevant passages from Huxley's paper in certain
places.

The Courtship Displays
Head-shaking Display
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999215833333333" page_id="58091627"  page_num="Page 182" year="" vol="">
When head-shaking fully the grebe alternates between two types of
head movement. The main one, a vigorous sideways waggling
" some four or five times in quick succession, like a man nodding
emphatic dissent ", is followed by a much slower swing of greater
amplitude, " with a seemingly vague and enquiring action, as if the
bird were searching the horizon for it knew not what." The bill
usually points just slightly downwards at its normal angle, but some-
times, especially at the beginning of an intense display, is tucked well
down, and on other occasions is elevated at about 35 degrees. The
ornamental feathers of the head are raised characteristically during
sequences of these movements: the crest is elevated vertically and
sprayed out rather raggedly; the tippets are well spread so that they
stand away from the head and frame the white face patch in chestnut
and black. The neck, stretched fully upright, looks surprisingly thin
and long for most of its length, though there is a noticeable thickening
where the shoulders meet it. The whole attitude of neck resembles a
small white-wine bottle with its disproportionally elongated neck and
a fancy cork. When in this head-shaking posture, the grebe shows to
full advantage all its conspicuous frontal features. Apart from the
head feathers, more white now appears than normally, from the whole
length of the neck and from the upper breast which has been brought
out of the water by the stretching of the neck. A last, rather incon-
gruous, feature of the posture is that the tiny apologetic " tail " is
cocked right up, although it must be invisible from the front.

Normally, head-shaking display only appears at full intensity when
performed in a mutual ceremony with the mate, or potential mate.
In the case of flirtations (pp. 133-4), however, the relationship between
the birds may be casual. The display may also occur in other, &lt;# non-
ceremonial " circumstances, usually then at low intensity, without the
full posture and with only relatively slight head movement. For
instance, an unresponsive partner may shake its head at its mate when
the lattei is soliciting on the nest, and one-sided display may be seen
at nest-relief. As previously described on page 141, a bird in the
upright pre-attack posture may do head-shaking movements when
about to withdraw.

Habit-preening Display
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.9898088" page_id="58091628"  page_num="Page 183" year="" vol="">
" This action had obviously something to do with preening but had
an extraordinary look, as if of a stereotyped and meaningless relic." In
habit-preening, the grebe dips its head backwards and downwards to
one side, in a smooth, very precise movement, and raises a few of the
feathers of one of the folded wings on the back with its closed bill.
Then it brings the head back to its former position, usually the up-
right, head-shaking one. The habit-preening display is, in fact, very
often associated with head-shaking. It is obviously an extreme form
of displacement-preening which is more complete than this very
symbolic action.

Weed-trick Display
</equation>
<bodyText confidence="0.94227252631579" page_id="58091628"  page_num="Page 183" year="" vol="">
This is initiated by a dive to the bed where the grebe gathers a bill-
full of aquatic weed. Surfacing, it swims towards the mate with the
bunch of weed dangling, tippets fully expanded " to the extreme
elliptical, bringing down the ears (i.e. the crest) meanwhile from the
vertical to the lateral position, so that the whole crest (that is the tippets
and crest combined) now appeared like a large chestnut-and-black
Elizabethan ruflf". Head-shaking display may follow, but the pen-
guin-dance is the usual sequel.
Penguin-dance Display
Holding the weed, the grebe swims towards its mate, and when a
few feet away rears up out of the water suddenly so that most of its
body stands nearly vertically above the surface, with the legs paddling
powerfully out of sight to keep the bird up. Normally the partner
has done the same and a mutual ceremony results.
Ghostly-penguin Display
This display, which is certainly as strange as the penguin-dance,
and even more bizarre, is prefaced by a very shallow dive towards the
mate. When the approaching bird reaches the latter or, as often
happens, overshoots it, a slow emergence is made from the depths.

" He seemed to grow out of the water. First his head, the ruff nearly
circular, the bill pointing down along the neck in a stiff and peculiar
manner; then the neck, quite straight and vertical; then the body,
straight and vertical too ; until finally the whole bird, save for a few
inches, was standing erect in the water, and reminding me of nothing
so much as the hypnotized phantom of a rather slender penguin."
Huxley named the dive and the emergence, the " ghost-dive "; as it
is convenient to have a special name for the peculiar emergence itself,
I have adopted his incidental one, ghostly-penguin, for it.
Cat-display
This, the " cat-attitude " of Huxley, has already been briefly out-
lined and figured on page 144 in its connection with hostilities. " In
this position, the beautiful white bar formed by the marginal wing-
coverts, along the anterior margin of the wing, and the broad white
blaze formed by the secondaries, which are quite invisible when the
wings are closed, shone out vividly. The gap between the wings was
filled by the head; this from the front somewhat resembled an old-
fashioned picture of the sun, with the ruff rayed out considerably all
round, and the ears were erected laterally so as to fit on the top of the
ruff on either side. Below the head shone the white of the puffed-out
breast. The bird's whole appearance was wonderfully striking, and
as unlike as possible to that of its everyday self." The cat-display is
a regular item of courtship between the mated male and female and
figures prominently in two of the ceremonies. Like head-shaking and
habit-preening, however, and unlike the weed-trick, penguin-dance,
and ghostly-penguin displays, the cat-display may appear outside the
context of the formal courtship ceremonies. We have already seen its
use by unmated females when threatened, and these birds often adopt
it when merely approached by males that have answered their
" advertising call " (see later below).

Of the four main ceremonies, two (Head-shaking and Penguin-
dance Ceremonies) are strictly mutual with the male and females
playing identical roles. The remaining two (Discovery- and Display-
Ceremonies) are reciprocal, with the roles of each sex different but
interchangeable. None of the ceremonies are preludes to coition,
which is preceded by quite a different sequence of activities at the
nest-platform.
The Head-shaking Ceremony
u The bout of shaking is not only the commonest form of courtship-
action, but it also forms part of all the other more elaborate forms. It
always ends a series of actions and often begins them as well." Thus

it is the normal prelude to both the Penguin-dance and Display-
CeiemonieSj and the normal sequel to both these and the Discovery-
Ceremony as well.
A typical, full intensity, Head-shaking Ceremony proceeds something
like this. If separated, the male and female swim towards each
other, sometimes in a version of the forward-display, perhaps giving
the barking call, as described on pages 138--9. The mated grebes are
more inclined to approach each other thus, prior to courtship, in the
eaily days following the initiation of their cycle. As they near one
another, however, they gradually raise their heads until, when they
meet, they are in the upright head-shaking posture, just described
above, with tippets and crest displayed. During the last stages of
the appioach and at the beginning of the resulting ceremony, the
grebes utter a characteristic, fast ticking-call like small stones being
glanced together, a rapid alternation of two sounds on two notes:
a consonantal sound-- k'p or Vc --on the low note, and an indefinite
vowel sound about a tone higher." The barking (threat) call may
blend into this ticking one. If the two birds are already close to-
gether, they merely start ticking, rear up their heads in display and
link up without any more elaborate approach behaviour. Now
facing, perhaps only a few inches apart, male and female start the
ceiemony proper. Initially the bills may be sharply lowered at an
acute angle to the neck (which exaggerates the appearance of the
tippets by making more of their surface visible to the mate), especially,
as Huxley also notes, after aggressive dealings with other grebes.
Indeed, the display bout may not progress beyond this if the en-
~ountei is not yet fully over. Soon, however, the birds relax their
beads into the more normal, less strained, shaking position and the
asual alternation of waggling and swaying follows. The movements
af the two birds may not synchronize in any way--&amp;apos;" the violent shak-
es of the two neither coincided nor alternated, but each shook and
;wung without any apparent reference to the other's rhythm."
However, sometimes I have recorded a definite rhythmic form of
lead-shaking: one bird takes the lead and dictates the pace. It
.vaggles rapidly, often with the head pointing upwards, and its mate
loes likewise, and so on.
Huxley found that a typical bout of head-shaking lasted for about
en to a dozen shakes between both birds, but recorded one sequence
n which the two birds gave 84 shakes. After a variable number of
ast and slow head movements, first one and then the other grebe may
tart to habit-preen, perhaps incompletely at first with but a slight
backward turn of the head. Then this display may take command
&amp;gt;f the ceremony. The birds waggle, sway, and dip back to flick up the
ving feathers, or waggle and preen without swaying the head in
&amp;gt;etween. Once habit-preening has started the bout never regains its

former tempo again and either ends there and then or eventually
fades away.
" The bouts seem, to the casual onlooker, to start themselves--in
reality, I think, each bird excites the other. One bird gently shakes
its head under the force of rising emotional tension; the other bird
had not quite got to that stage, but the sight of its mate shaking acts
as a stimulus, and it too pricks up its head a little and gives a shake.
Mutual Head-shaking Ceremony--the sway of the head between the waggling
movements.
This reacts on the first bird, and so the excitement is mutually in-
creased and the process fulfils itself. ..." Many ceremonies start in
this way from previous inactivity. Often, too, and especially if male
and female are not side-by-side, either of them may more noticeably
initiate the bout by approaching its partner and ticking, the two birds
working up to a good intensity as they near and assume the display
posture. In the events that follow each grebe's behaviour acts to
intensify and keep up that of its mate. There can be no complete
Head-shaking Ceremony (or any other) without the equal participa-
tion of male and female. Often, instead of starting from scratch, as
it were, mutual head-shaking is initiated by one of the other cere-
monies, as will be described below. I have termed all this kind of
head-shaking, which has its origin only in the behaviour of the
individual pair itself as spontaneous. Much is also induced , however,
by outside influences. The sight and sound of grebes engaged in a
conspicuous Head-shaking Ceremony will often stimulate another

pair to do the same. A characteristic scene in the open water is the
simultaneous performance of several pairs, dotted here and there
within view of one another. Territorial neighbours may similarly
stimulate each other, and Head-shaking Ceremonies are further
frequently induced by aggressive encounters. For example, after
threatening other birds, or after actively driving out intruders, the
territory-owning pair may link up and display, often very vigorously.
Birds actually still engaged in hostilities with others, may intermittently
join up with the mate and head-shake, although usually such bouts
are broken-off in their early stages as the enemy is re-engaged.
Sometimes a pair of grebes may head-shake on the sight of intruders
instead of going to deal with them. After the abrupt, aggressive end
to many a flirtation, the truely mated birds head-shake together.
The forward-display is not an invariable approach attitude prior
to head-shaking. It may be entirely left out or merely indicated as
male and female sail towards one another with the head just held
forward and the neck tucked back in the shoulders. Sometimes the
low intensity threat-call (gang-gang-gang) may be heard. In any
case, the forward display is never given at absolute intensity to the
mate (with rucked-up feathers on the back); it is usually only made
at the start of the approach, when male and female are several yards
apart, and is only regular during the early days of the pair's display
relationship. It is also very likely to occur to the mate after an
encounter with rivals and prior to induced display.
There is much intensity variation in the Head-shaking Ceremony
itself. The amount of habit-preening ranges from nil upwards to
almost a hundred per cent frequency. " The more excitement, the
less preening, seems to be the rule; long bouts may degenerate into
practically undiluted preening, the head simply being brought more
ar less up, but not shaken between the ' preens There is every
degree of completeness in the posture and head movements themselves,
rom the full ritual already described right down to a few lazy-looking
;hakes of the head with no stretching of the neck (or even with the
lead tucked away in the pork-pie attitude !), and without any spread-
ng of tippets and crest at all. While some of this low intensity
lehaviour is due at times to a joint indifference, much of it results
rom a lack of response in one of the partners. Often, on the other
land, enthusiasm from one spreads to the other. Thus, sometimes
&amp;gt;ne grebe starts to display weakly but, getting no reaction at all from
he other, stops doing so; on other occasions, as we saw above, the
econd bird is stimulated to reply and then the bout mounts in
*xcitement.

no further display is to follow, the vestigial habit-preening may turi
into more complete preening. Often the birds rise in the water anc
body-shake (p. ioi). Any routine activity is likely to occur too, o:
the nest may be visited and built up. Often, however, another forn
of courtship ceremony may follow on directly, or very soon afterwards
and more head-shaking as well. Once a very excited sequence o
preening and oiling actions interspersed bouts of head-shaking, witf
much splashing of water. A very much more frequent sequel to ar
intense Head-shaking Ceremony which has contained little if an\
habit-preening, is the joint swimming-together of the paired grebes, side&amp;apos;

by-side as if going to a definite place. If they have not settled dowr
at a nest-site already, this swimming may soon be superseded by some
other activity, the birds going nowhere in particular. But if they
have reached the soliciting and copulatory stages of their cycle, it is
obvious that this purposive swimming is really directed towards the
nest site. When this is reached the more intimate sexual activities
may occur there. Other patterns which may less regularly succeed
head-shaking include the following. Huxley recorded that one pair
" almost always went into a formal back to back, or rather tail to tail,
attitude after each bout of shaking ", and, on one occasion, the two
birds of another pair dived suddenly away from each other. I have
seen a pair, when no other grebes were near to frighten it, in which the
male and female turned away after display and swam side-by-side
with their tippets tightly closed in the furtive-posture. At another
time, the female of an isolated pair backed away from her mate with
her head withdrawn and bill open, in the pre-attack posture in fact.
Sometimes, a Head-shaking Ceremony of sorts occurs at the nest,
with one bird on the platform itself and the other in the water along-
side. This is not, however, a pre-copulatory affair. What has
happened is that the soliciting of the grebe on the nest--male or
female it may be--has not had the desired effect on the one in the
water. The latter has poked about the base of the nest, perhaps added
weed and made spasmodic head-shaking movements to which the
other has finally responded and the bout received momentum from

</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.993759882352941" page_id="58091634"  page_num="Page 189" year="" vol="">
This ceremony, like the Head-shaking one, is a strictly mutual
affair, and is the least frequently performed of all the grebe's rituals.
Huxley saw the Penguin-dance only four times and Selous but once.
I have not seen it much more than a dozen times over seven seasons,
although observing hundreds of head-shaking bouts in the same period.
I do believe, however, that the behaviour is not quite so rare as these
records might suggest.
Mutual Penguin-dance Ceremony (adapted from a figure in Huxley's paper).
The Penguin-dance Ceremony, made up of the weed-trick and
penguin-dance displays, is the most elaborate of all the grebe's court-
ship. It seems always to be initiated by a very intense bout of head-
shaking, in which habit-preening is not frequent or, probably more
usually, not performed at all. The joint diving which heralds the
weed-trick follows and, on surfacing, the two birds swim to meet and
rear up together. " Coming up with the impetus of their motion, the
two birds came actually to touch each other with their breasts. From
the common fulcrum thus formed, bodies and neck alike sloped slightly

back--the birds would have fallen forwards had each not thus sup-
ported the other. Only the very tip of the body was in the water. ..."
In such a breath-taking union they sway together for a few moments,
still holding the weed, and start to head-shake. Still waggling their
heads, the grebes sink down slowly from the upright position and
another intense Head-shaking Ceremony occurs. In the meantime
the weed has disappeared, probably always merely dropped as the
couple subsides, though Huxley thought some of it might be eaten.
Sometimes the mutual weed-trick display is followed directly by
head-shaking, without the intervening penguin-dancing. Once
(27th January, 1951), a female dived, approached her mate with the
weed in her bill only to find him preparing for a good head-shaking
bout--raising his head, spreading his tippets and crest, and loudly
ticking. Ignoring the usual procedure in such cases, which demands
her to head-shake also, she reared up in penguin-dance display against
him. The male moved back slightly and the female lost her support,
a regular Head-shaking Ceremony following. A somewhat similar
and unusual sequence was seen on 22nd February, 1953. A pair was
adding weed to the platform when some intruding grebes came to view.
The male left the Typha clump, swam, towards them, and then turned
to head-shake with his mate. She meanwhile had left also, still hold-
ing the weed intended for the nest, and reared up in front of her mate
in the penguin-dance display, then dropped the weed and participated
in the Head-shaking Ceremony. In both these cases the one-sided
penguin-dancing was unusual. Also, unlike head-shaking, the penguin-
dance is not often induced by " outside " influences.
The Discovery-Ceremony
The Discovery-Ceremony is a regular form of courtship occurring
more frequently than the Penguin-dance but not nearly so often as
Head-shaking. It takes this reciprocal form. One of the pair, it may
be the male or the female, dives towards the other in a special way:
its underwater course lies only just under the surface and is marked by
a narrow but quite noticeable ripple as the grebe progresses. The
second bird, some yards away, on seeing the other dive goes into the
cat-display and watches the ripple intently as it approaches. The
submerged bird usually passes just beyond the one on the surface,
which turns about, still keeping the tell-tale disturbance on the water
in sight, and comes out of the water in the ghostly-penguin display.
"As it grew it gradually revolved on its long axis until at its fullest
height it came to face the hen. Though all this was done in an un-
hurried and uniform motion, yet of course, it took very little time.
Then from his stiff, erect position he sank slowly to the surface; the
hen meanwhile put down her wings and raised her neck; and the pair
settled down to a bout of head-shaking ", which is the almost invariable

sequel. Although in this quotation from Huxley it was the male that
performed the whole ghost-dive, and the female the cat-display, I
would emphasize that these two roles are definitely interchangeable, a
fact about which Huxley was uncertain. On the other hand in hostile
and other situations involving unpaired grebes in which the cat-
display has appeared, I have so far only recorded it from females.
But the male may perform it in a Discovery-Ceremony.
The reciprocal Discovery-Ceremony--the ghostly-penguin and the cat-display.
Huxley's observations showed that the Discovery-Ceremony most
often occurs when a mated male and female link up after being
totally separated. One of them " searches " for the other (in the for-
ward-display, uttering the barking call) which, when discovered,
dives and initiates the ritual. There are, however, not infrequent
departures from this pattern. Firstly, the couple need not be out of
touch altogether but may also at times be separated by as little as a
few yards and in full view of one another. Then, in either case, total
or partial separation, the ceremony may be initiated by the diving of
either the " searcher " or the " discovered ". Thirdly, the forward-
display approach, which is no more a regular feature of this ritual
than any other, may be present in all intensities from quite high to nil.
Also, as Huxley himself notes, the ceremony may be set-off, not by the
diving bird, but by one of the pair first assuming the cat-attitude.
Occasionally, too, both may display thus before one of them dives.

The Display-Ceremony
This not very elaborate ceremony, on grebe standards anyway, is
about as common as the last one. It can be described in relatively
few words. During a bout of mutual head-shaking either of the
birds, male or female, may quite suddenly break off, turn away and
half-fly, half-patter across the water for several yards. When it
settles it assumes the cat-display, often a very complete one indeed,
and revolves to face the mate which usually swims up to meet it,
Another Head-shaking Ceremony follows in which habit-preening
often figures prominently. Sometimes the first grebe will merely
swim back and rejoin the mate after flying away, without going into
the " cat Occasionally the other will dash away in turn after the
first Display-Ceremony and initiate a second.
A Record from Field-notes
The following field-notes on an actual sequence of observations were
made between 14.10 and 16.10 on 27th January, 1951, and give an
interesting first-hand example of how the displays and ceremonies take
place in nature. They give some idea, for instance, how frequent and
varied courtship can be on occasions. Pair A51 were the grebes con-
cerned mainly: they had established themselves in the large Type B
territory in the breeding-pool (see p. 136) by 20th January and be-
tween that date and the day of the present watching had laid the
foundations of a nest-platform. The territories of two other pairs
(E51 and B51) joined partly on to A's at two points. Head-shaking
is continually referred to below, so I have used the abbreviation
" H.S." for it, and also the conventional symbols for male C?) and
female ($).
When observations began the two Pair A birds were just finishing
a bout of H.S. Afterwards, they moved to the edge of the territory
and for the next 10 minutes or so called aggressively (etc.) out of sight
at a single member of Pair B. $ and $ became separated by several
yards meanwhile, and a Discovery-Ceremony followed (14.20) as they
came back to view, with the in the cat-display and the $ performing
the ghost-dive. After the rather incomplete H.S. Ceremony that
ensued, both grebes once more moved out of sight between the islands,
with their necks still stretched (14.23). A minute later the returned,
followed by the $; the two linked up and went into mutual H.S.
which the 5 initiated but the # terminated. The habit-preening of
the ceremony was done by the $ mainly. The pair separated again
and went behind the islands. At 14-3* th e reappeared, swimming
in the forward display and barking. The ^ too came in sight in the
same posture and then dived, slipping smoothly under the water. At
this the again went into the "cat ", his mate emerging on course and
diving again. A second Discovery-Ceremony took place, followed by

H.S. Two more bouts occurred within the next 5 minutes. At 14.38
the $ swam threateningly to the border of the territory. The $ came
along behind him, also in the forward-display, then dived and came
up in front of her mate and they H.S. briefly. Both moved out of
sight, presumably to deal with a third grebe. Soon after another
H.S. Ceremony occurred and when it ended the dived. The 2 went
into the cat-display but when her mate emerged he was not in the
ghostly-penguin, and a normal bout of H.S. took place.
This was at 14.45 an d observation on these grebes ceased until
15.25 while I counted the total number of grebes present at Burghfield
that day. When watching started again, Pair A was once more H.S.,
following this up with a Display-Ceremony. The 2 was the one to
turn and patter away. In the ensuing bout there was little true H.S.
but very much habit-preening. By 15.35 the 2 at last visited the
Salix clump containing the nest-platform, but the $ was in another
clump several yards away. Both barked in duet briefly before the
2 left her cover, swam towards the $ and dived. He cat-displayed
and another Discovery-Ceremony occurred, succeeded by a very long
and intense H.S. bout of some 2 minutes' duration. Then the led
the way to the more open part of the territory where yet another H.S.
Ceremony followed. The couple moved out of view for a minute or
two and after that there was a further bout of H.S., the birds swim-
ming together subsequently to the clump holding the nest. More H.S.
occurred and then the 2 dived, came up with weed which she soon
dropped and merely joined the to H.S. briefly. Within the next
3 minutes she added three loads of material to the nest and the $
poked at it once. They went away at 15.51 with the in the lead
and had a mild encounter with an intruding grebe, an induced H.S.
Ceremony resulting. The 2 swam away from her mate and then
turned and partially cat-displayed at him (mild Display-Ceremony).
He also started to posture in the same way but changed his mind and
folded away his wings. Upon this the 2 ghost-dived and a typical
Discovery-Ceremony took place, followed by a long H.S. bout. Soon
&amp;apos;after, at 16.01, both grebes dived, emerged from the depths, approached
each other in weed-trick display and capped it all with a fine penguin-
dance. After the inevitable H.S., the pair turned away towards their
platform, the 2 arriving there first. The then dived and another
Discovery-Ceremony followed, with the 2 taking the " cat " role this
time, and yet more H.S. A " mixed " ceremony occurred soon after-
wards with the 2 doing a weed-trick display and then a full penguin-
dance against her mate who was in the H.S. posture. The pair
briefly separated and was engaged in H.S. when I left the pool a few
minutes later.
In 80 minutes of repeated courtship the score was: H.S. Ceremonies,

covery-Ceremonies, 5 complete ones and one incomplete; Display-
Ceremonies, 1 full and 1 mild one; Penguin-dance Ceremony, 1
complete mutual one and a unilateral one by the # who also did a
lone weed-trick display. All this was in late January ; the pair com-
menced incubating during the third week of March and their young
first saw the light of day towards the middle of April. Their second
brood hatched out three parts of the way through June.
The Advertising-display of the Female
I have only recently (1954) outlined this more or less previously
neglected behaviour in the B.T.O. journal Bird Study , so there is no
need to go into full detail here although a more complete statement
can now be made. A grebe advertising at full intensity is unmistake-
able by reason of its characteristic pose and manner of calling. It
floats or swims very slowly with the neck moderately stretched and
vertical crest and tippets apparently relaxed. The bird calls inter-
mittently with a loud, far-reaching " grr-owp ", the throat distending
noticeably as it does so. This advertising-call is very throaty, drawn-
out, and resonant. A second, much quieter sound follows, almost
certainly caused by the effort of producing the main note--a moaning,
purring " row-ah " like a letting out of breath. The display is
essentially a vocal one, the posture merely being instrumental in
affording the grebe a good view and in manufacturing the call.
I have recorded this display from lone and apparently unmated birds in
the open water many times. On a few occasions when I have been
sure of the sex of such grebes they have always been females. Also
known mated females in the nesting-territory--and never the males--
have not infrequently been heard and seen advertising when their
mates were totally absent or at least well separated from them. All
females seem to display thus because they cannot perform joint court-
ship or other sexual activities owing to the lack of a partner.
In the 1954 paper I stated that I had never known a grebe definitely
recorded as a male to behave thus, though the chance of this being
merely a matter of coincidence was not rejected. In the 15 months
since that paper was submitted for publication, I have made further
observations and also discovered some previously overlooked notes.
In all cases where the sex of the bird was known, it was a female that
was advertising and so it seems safe to suggest, therefore, that this
behaviour is a specific feminine behaviour-pattern. If so, it is the
only activity that the male and female Great Crested Grebe do not
share, apart from the absolute sexual functions.
Huxley certainly saw this behaviour, but he did not draw any
special attention to it apart from christening the call the " double-
trumpet . He seems to give one definite and two probable cases in
his diary abstracts--all three rather nicely involved females.

Pair-formation
Practically no definite information is to be found in the literature on
how new grebe pairs are formed. Huxley himself doubted that
courtship played a part in this, and even stated in his 1924 paper in
British Birds that There is no courtship until after pairing up "
However, my own observations show that, as well as female advertising
some courtship does figure prominently, particularly head-shaking and
he ^l 1Sp ay - , 1 ca &quot; nt&amp;gt;t P retend &amp;gt; though, that our knowledge of this
most difficult subject is near complete enough; much more work is
needed, if possible on individually marked birds. Richdale's fascinat-
mgy exact studies on ringed Yellowed-eyed Penguins ( Megadvptes
antipodes) have shown that many more factors are involved in pair-
covCT atl0n tha &quot; an initial rOUnd * f courtshi P. which is all my notes
New pairs are established almost invariably in the open water and
not in the territory, mainly during the first five months of the year.
Unattached females drift about giving the advertising-call and this
sometimes attracts other grebes to them. Certainly at times, and
pi esumably always these last birds are males. Some are already
paired (but inclined to flirt); others have no mate. The unattached
ma es, m turn, seek a partner by approaching a female in the pre-
lminaries of head-shaking. In both cases, whichever sex initiates the
proceedings the female concerned often cat-displays when approached
and mutual head-shaking may occur, followed by Display and Dis-
covery-Ceremonies. The couple may then part, at least for the time
bdng, or continue to court.

As already mentioned (p. to), some head-shaking courtship may be
seen in many months of the year, though only at all regularly from
about January to September, depending initially on the weather.
The main courting months are from January to June, but the indi-
vidual grebe by no means displays with equal fervour or frequency
throughout its reproductive-cycle as has often been mistakenly assumed
in the literature.. This wholly wrong idea does not originate from any
direct statement in Huxley's paper. He was not rash enough to reach
such a definite conclusion on this point from observations which
though intensive, were also very limited in duration (some two weeks
or so in early spring). It was from his theory that the various cere-
monies served to maintain the bond between male and female during
. Clr J on S&amp;gt; J olnt task of rearing the brood, that later writers deduced

K. E. L. SIMMONS-STUDIES ON GREAT CRESTED GREBES
Huxley's work says that " the display which so obviously gives pleasure
to both partners serves as an emotional bond of a union in which
protraction till late in the season has a definite biological function
Richdale {Sexual Behavior in Penguins ), again referring to Huxley's
paper, makes an even more misleading statement (which may be true
of penguins but certainly not of grebes) when he.states that " the
function of love-habits ... is bond-holding, and is more noticeable
after coition has ceased " (italics mine).
Grebe courtship declines as the reproductive-cycle progresses, but
apart from this relationship, which will be traced in more detail below,
there is another. Courtship is most intense in the early days (1-2
weeks) after pair-formation, in the case of new pairs, or after the
beginning of the seasonal display of already formed pairs. This
relation cuts across that one to the stages of the cycle. For example,
a pair that has spent only a day or two courting in open water before
establishing itself at a nest site, will display more intensely during the
building phase than another couple that has taken 2 weeks over their
initial display period. One pair, therefore, may commence the
" platform-behaviour " stages (see p. 13) at an already lower court-
ship pitch than another but, in either case, display will decline both
in frequency and intensity as egg-laying approaches.
Relation to the Pre-parental Stages
The onset of courtship starts after the variable winter period of
much reduced reproductive activity has ended--when the head-
ornamentation, the " display-plumage ", develops again, perhaps as
many as three months before egg-laying. There is then much activity
in open water and the Head-shaking, Discovery- and Display-Cere-
monies are all conspicuous. The length of this first stage of initial
courtship varies considerably : some pairs revert immediately to the
old territory while others spend many weeks doing nothing after the
first big burst of display.
When the nest sites are chosen courting is still relatively common,
especially while the birds are still only building. However, when they
start to solicit on the platform as well it declines gradually. For
example, I watched Pair A51 again on 28th January for 30 minutes
longer than I had the day before, when their marathon sequence of
display occurred. They were now building quite industriously and
also soliciting on the platform, though not copulating. Only 14
Head-shaking Ceremonies and one Penquin-dance Ceremony were
recorded in 11 o minutes, and no Discovery- or Display- ones at all.
Much of the head-shaking was induced by intruders in any case.
When soliciting becomes frequent and coition regular, courtship
decreases even more noticeably until, when the eggs appear, it has
practically ceased.

Penguin-dancing is performed from the building stage onwards.
At Burghfield I have never seen it except in the territory at the time
when building is well under way, soliciting not infrequent but coition
as yet rare. At first it seemed hard to reconcile this with Huxley's
observations on the point, for he recorded Penguin-dance Ceremonies
in open water from birds to all appearances in the first stage of their
cycle. But he watched them on a water devoid of cover where breeding
was impossible. Some of his grebes were psychologically at the correct
stage but physically prevented from progressing with their cycle by
the unsuitable environment. 7
Advertising-display occurs regularly from mated females throughout
the pre-parental stages.
Relation to the Parental Stages
I have no records at all of advertising-display or of any courtship
proper, besides head-shaking, during the period of incubation (when
I once watched a pair for 170 hours all told) or while the young are
being reared. Huxley's statement, in a later article in The Country-
man (1944), that the sitting bird leaves the eggs, searches for its mate
and performs a Discovery-Ceremony with it, is almost certainly in-
correct. Very low intensity, often one-sided head-shaking display
may occur from time to time in such circumstances as when one
partner wishes to relieve the other on the nest. All the relatively
intense Head-shaking Ceremonies are induced and usually follow an
aggressive encounter.

When the young are well grown their parents may start to become
sexually inclined towards each other again, and occasionally start
another brood. This second pre-parental period, whether it culmin-
ates in egg-laying or not, is never accompanied by courtship to the
extent that the first one was. Head-shaking and, in its own special
circumstances, female advertising do occur but normally no other
form of courtship.
A Preliminary Discussion on the Nature and Meaning of Grebe Courtship
The main (known) facts about the courtship of the Great Crested
Grebe have now been presented and it remains to assess their signi-
ficance. A fully detailed discussion is not possible (considering space
md the present state of knowledge) but I hope this outline will give
. e general reader a brief insight into the fascination of the theoretical
ade of the behaviour student's work, and also some idea of the methods
employed by modern ethology in such analysis. The three major
problems are those of the origin, internal causation (see p. 137) and
unction of all this complicated behaviour.

! 9 8
The Probable Origins of the Courtship Displays
Displays are what have been called by Tinbergen (1952) " derived
activities ": that is, they have been adapted and modified (ritualized)
by natural selection from existing basic movements to serve a new
" signal " function between individuals of the same species. No one
has yet examined the possible derivation of the display movements
used by the Great Crested Grebe in courtship. The way to do this is
to compare these movements with those other of the bird's behaviour-
patterns which are not themselves displays , that is the movements used in
preening, feeding, comfort, etc. (pp. 93-102), in fleeing and attack
(pp. 139-14), in copulating (see next section) and so on. Any resem-
blances and connections should be noted.
The origin of two grebe postures have already been indicated, the
first having undergone some ritualization, the other not. Thus, the
forward- (threat) display is quite obviously derived from the " inten-
tion-movement " of attacking a rival across the surface of the water.
Then, the body attitude that the female assumes while advertising is
mainly a by-product of producing and projecting the special "double-
trumpet " call. These are relatively simple cases and the proper
courtship movements, with one notable and very happy exception, are
much more complicated and of older origin.
Let Us first look at those displays used in the mutual ceremonies.
The habit-preening display is the initial link in the chain of analysis.
There can be no doubt at all that this has its origin in real preening
movements. Habit-preening is the familiar companion of the head-
shaking display which comprises the two movements of the head
(waggle and sway), the upright posture of the neck and the cocking-up
of the " tail ". When these are examined in turn, first of all two
further elements " borrowed " from true preening reveal themselves.
These are the waggling action of the head (which has its basic counter-
part in the comfort-movement used to detach water and feathers from
the bill) and the cocking of the tail (functionally employed to open the
oil-gland, apparently)--see p. 100. I believe the slow swaying of the
head to be the " intention-movement " of dipping back to habit-
preen : this often follows or sometimes replaces it, and every gradient
between swaying and full habit-preening may be observed. This
leaves open the origin of the upright neck posture. There is another
situation besides head-shaking courtship, in which non-functional
preening appears. Both the more complete displacement-preening
and, rather less frequently, the abbreviated habit-preening itself,
occur during hostile encounters between rival grebes when the main
tendency is that of withdrawal (pp. 141-2). A strong connection
between preening and fighting is suggested, and the resemblance
between the upright head-shaking posture and the upright pre-attack
one cannot be easily dismissed as merely coincidental. It is but a

small step after this to theorize that the " clash " of the Penguin-dance
quite closely resembles the only other situation in which grebes meet
in this way, namely the clash of fighting birds. Just as the head-
shaking posture (modified from the upright pre-attack one) has had
displacement-preening elements superimposed on it, the penguin-
dance posture (modified from breast-to-breast fighting) has had dis-
placement-nesting elements similarly attached. The weed-trick is
quite clearly based on the collecting and carrying of nesting material :
the mutual Penguin-dance Ceremony is a characteristic of the building
stage of the cycle and I have already given the case of the female grebe
who used weed actually collected for the nest in her subsequent
unilateral dance.
An examination of those displays used in the reciprocal ceremonies
supports the analysis above. The ghost-dive seems obviously to be a
orm of symbolic " attack, with the ghostly-penguin emergence
based on the movements for attacking from under-water. I have
suggested (p. 144) that the cat-display is a defensive one and it is
fitting therefore that it is in fact the normal " reply " to the ghost-
dive in the Discovery-Ceremony, and follows the " escape " pattering-
away in the Display-Ceremony. I believe that the conspicuous show-
ing of the wing in the cat-display is, like the wing movement used in
intense forward-display (p. 138), a ritualized intention-movement of
flying. This has been suggested also by Daanje (1950) in a long review
of such activities: he points out that the land-bird tends to droop the
wings whereas the water-bird raises them because otherwise they would
dip in the water. While the forward-display is based on the inten-
tion-movement of flying at the adversary, the cat-display is based on
those of flying away from another grebe. It is in fact the " opposite "
of the forward-display, the bird withdrawing the head instead of
advancing it.
The Probable Causation of Grebe Courtship
Behaviour is caused by two main factors--objects in the external
environment and internal impulses or drives. We will deal here with
the latter. It seems very probably that, as the courtship displays are
based mainly on attack and escape movements, the birds actually feel
aggressive and frightened when in the presence of their mates. There
is good evidence for this, but it is not the whole story. Theoretically,
sexual tendencies are very likely to be present, and I believe that grebe
courtship is a very special result of the interplay of all three of these
drives, as I hope to show below in a brief investigation of " that whole
emotional state " mentioned by Huxley.
No one would deny that courting grebes are sexually inclined to-
wards each other; they must be or full courtship would not be the
strictly heterosexual affair that it is. Also, like soliciting and copu-

lation, it declines when the eggs appear and parental behaviour-
patterns take command. On the other hand, full courtship may occur
many weeks before coition, and declines when soliciting and copu-
lation become regular. Then, head-shaking may occasionally be
performed by stripe-headed juveniles (some as young as eight weeks
old) and their sexual inclinations can only be very mild at best. It
takes place also after adult coition when sexual impulses must similarly
be very weak. All this suggests that the sex-drive in courtship is a
relatively low intensity one. It is inconceivable, however, that the
complicated displays and ceremonies are merely the result of one
unenergetic drive. Affairs make sense if it can be shown that such an
impulse acts in conjunction with the aggressive and fleeing ones. The
combination of the three in varying strengths and dominations pro-
duces the courtship. Work on these relations is still in its very early
stages.
As I have shown in the descriptive sections, actual attack and escape
tendencies may appear from time to time, before, during, and after
both the mutual and reciprocal ceremonies. Also the forward-
display in some form often preludes these ceremonies, while head-
shaking is frequently (and penguin-dancing occasionally) induced by
aggressive encounters when bad feelings must be running high.
Courtship is more frequent and intense in those early days after the
onset of reproductive behaviour: birds are more inclined to feel
aggressive and frightened towards their partners at the very beginning
of their cycle, before they have had time to get used to close contact
with them, as I have recently (1955) shown to be the case with Little
Ringed Plovers (Charadrius dubius).
The interplay of the three drives may be indicated by the following
examples. Mutual head-shaking may be terminated in several ways.
The birds can do much habit-preening, which suggests that escape
tendencies are coming to the fore. If these assert themselves, one of
the grebes may patter away and turn round in the defensive cat-display
(the Display-Ceremony). Much habit-preening may be in evidence
in the renewed head-shaking bout. Otherwise the couple may break
off from a very intense Head-shaking Ceremony and swim-together to
the nest (if it has one), showing that a more complete sexual impulse
has taken command of the situation. Yet again, a full bout of head-
shaking may be followed by a Penguin-dance Ceremony when, I
think, both the aggressive and, to a lesser degree, the sexual drives are
well worked-up.
The Probable Function of Grebe Courtship
As stated above, displays are " social-signals ", that is they have been
evolved by natural-selection to release (or inhibit) an immediate
response from a fellow member of the species. One of the great

mysteries of bird behaviour has been the " missing " releaser function
of G ieat Crested Grebe courtship ! It seems to lead to nothing
definite, unlike the soliciting-displays which terminate in coition. The
answer is as simple as it is obvious : the immediate aim of courtship
display is to elicit courtship display in return from other grebe.
Courtship begets courtship--mutual or reciprocal--and in such a wav
do the ceremonies result. Thus, head-shaking bouts build up through
the mutual stimulation from both birds and may also be induced by
the sight and sound of other grebes behaving in a similar manner.
The ghost-dive releases the cat-display (and occasionally vice versa)
What purpose does this serve ? If the birds display together, and
they often just cannot " resist " so doing, they are unable to show more
unctional attacking and fleeing movements towards each other.
Courtship both inhibits these " pair-disrupting " impulses and absorbs
em at the same time. As already discussed (pp. 137 14^-6) if
the aggressive and escape drives were allowed uninhibited expression
in such a potentially hostile bird as the grebe, the reproductive-cycle
would be seriously interfered with. The origins of the display move-
ments themselves strongly suggests that once, a long time back in the
history of the species, actual hostilities between the male and the
female were more intense and frequent than they are at present. The
courtship has now replaced this (and also very probably acquired
ur her functions of a more long-term nature, such as sexual stimu-
lation and synchronization). In case it should be thought that I
ave stretched imagination too far, I would point out that one of the
more primitive of living grebes, the Pied-billed [Podilybus podicebs) of
America, does according to Glover (1953), actually force-copulate in
the water unlike any other species of grebe.
The question may be put: Isn't this a very complicated way of
soothing over the differences between the sexes ? It certainly is.
Orebes are primitive birds, ancestors very similar to the living forms
having been, found in the Oligocene deposits of 30-40 million years
ago. Their courtship belongs to the more complicated era of evo-
ution, being one of natural-selection's earlier answers to the aggressive/
escape set-up of pair relationship. Since then the tendency in
evolution has been towards the simplification of such processes, a
similar tendency to replace the symbolic by the more functional being
lound in man s customs, including religion. The development of an
e aboiate courtship system in the grebe was assisted, no doubt, by the
large amount of leisure that its feeding and digesting habits left it
(PP- 93 - 4 , 98 ).

By Kenneth Smith (Paignton, Devon, England)
The storks, like the cranes and herons, have always held a particular
interest for me. All birds add charm and interest to the natural
scene, but none excels these long-legged species in lending elegance
to panoramic beauty. Storks are distributed nearly throughout the
world, the White Stork ( Ciconia ciconia) being the familiar European
species. Britain has, as is well known, virtually no storks. The White
Stork does not breed here, and comes only occasionally as a very
rare visitor.
Few zoos, and fewer (if any) private aviculturists, go in for storks to
any extent. San Diego Zoo is, I believe, a happy exception, with a
fairly representative collection. Storks are highly carnivorous, there-
fore quite expensive to feed in numbers, and their very size makes
large aviaries or enclosures essential. It is little wonder, then, that
storks are almost only exhibited in zoological gardens where admittance
or gate money covers the cost of their housing and maintenance.
Nevertheless, I have often thought that a place for storks (and perhaps
cranes and herons too !) conducted on the Slimbridge style, would be
delightful.
Some pleasant days in the tropics were made more memorable to
me by the sight of storks. Around Keren I remember trees loaded
with nesting Abdim's Storks ( Sphenorynchus abdimii ), and I recollect
that later I descended to the hot Eritrean plain and on a small rock
mid-stream of the Setit River saw my first Hammer-headed Stork
(.Scopus umbretta). Abdim's Stork is fond of human habitations ; at
Keren many nests actually overhung native huts, and some could
almost be reached from the ground, but the Africans did not molest
the birds, as they believed their dead relatives entered the bodies of
the storks.
On Lake Mabesi, in the south of Sierra Leone, flocks of Open-bills

Mrs. Benchley informed me they were the first of the African race to
be shown there.
Along the Ireng River, which divides British Guiana from Brazil
south-west of the Pakaraima Mountains, I have seen handsome
Maguari Storks ( Euxenura maguari). They would not allow close
approach, so I watched from a hillside overlooking this valley in an
unpopulated wilderness. Their posture suggested contemplativeness,
like the herons standing by English willows on the banks of the
Evenlode I watched years before. I saw no wild Jabiru Storks {Jabiru
myctena) in Guiana, only a single tame specimen in the small Zoo in
Georgetown.
Two storks frequently exhibited in zoos are the African Marabou
(Leptoptilos crumeniferus ) and the Indian Adjutant (Leptaptilos dubius).
They have bare necks like vultures, and like those birds they scavange
at carcasses. Both species are fairly hardy and do well in confinement
Strangest of all storks is the Shoe-bill or Whale-headed Stork
(Balaemceps rex ) of the White Nile region. It is usually seen standing-
solitary in marsh or papyrus swamp, where it seeks fish and frogs.
Its grotesque bill makes the Shoe-bill a desirable and attractive Zoo
inmate, but it needs considerable care. It must have constant access
to a pond or pool ; Dr. Vevers told me this was proved vital in London
Zoo, otherwise the feet and legs were soon affected and disaster ensued.
As civilization spreads over wild lands, steadily and inexorably
year by year, storks, like many other large birds, will find living
conditions more and more difficult. Their age-old habitations are
being destroyed or spoilt by general development undertakings, and
especially by the drainage of marshes and pollution of rivers. Hydro-
electric schemes, like the Kariba and Kafue projects in the Federation
of Rhodesia and Nyasaland, are followed by widespread networks of
overhead power lines. Large birds like storks often collide with power
cables or sometimes meet death by electrocution. The modern
method of locust control involving the use of poisons is another menace.
In conclusion, to offset to some extent these melancholy thoughts,
one must acknowledge the increasing interest in wild life and fauna
preservation. This interest is stimulated by the press and cinema and
by sound radio and television. Our priceless animal life heritage,
storks included, can perhaps be saved for posterity if this great and
growing popular interest can be converted to channels of positive
and practical action towards conservation.

By David M. West (Montebello, California, U.S.A.)
A first breeding of any species or variety is probably an event worth
recording in the pages of the Avicultural Magazine, and for that
reason I send these notes on what is probably the first breeding of the
yellow variety of the common Red-rumped Parrakeet. Possibly, to
be on the safe side, I should say that the young female yellow Red-
rump I reared this year is the first to my knowledge. (In the U.S.A.)
The early history of the yellow variety has been given by the owners
of the Keston Foreign Bird Farm in the Jan.-Feb., 1949, issue of the
A.M ., page 12. Possibly the salient point is that the first and original
matriarch of this line was a wild-caught bird sent from Australia to
the late Duke of Bedford in 1935 and that her progeny provided the
basis for the yellow Red-rumps now in Europe and in many other
countries. It might be noted, however, that A. A. Prestwich, in
Records of Parrots Bred in Captivity, Part VI, mentions that other yellows
or " cinnamons 55 have been bred in Australia on several occasions.
Personally, I feel that the term " yellow " is quite an adequate descrip-
tion of the bird, where it would be quite inaccurate to term this
black-eyed, sex-linked mutation a " lutino I note that Mr. Brooks-
bank prefers " pastel " to " yellow ".
The first yellow of this variety I can recall seeing was at a dealer's
shop about 1950. This bird, a female, was sold to a local aviculturist,
but to date she has not reproduced, despite all efforts on the part of
her owner to provide her with a suitable husband and accommodation.
I obtained my first cock split yellow Red-rumps during the summer
of I953' My first efforts with these split cocks were very discouraging.
One bird had a slightly withered foot and never prospered and
eventually died. The remaining cock flourished and during the 1954
breeding season reared two young, both normal coloured, which
turned out to be a pair. A second nest in 1954 consisted of four clear
eggs and during the present breeding season they did not breed at all,
though mating was observed. I think it very odd, since this year they
were in a much larger and better breeding flight--but they never
really settled down, so possibly next year they will do better. Inci-
dentally, I might add that the young reared in 1954 themselves reared
three young cocks in 1955 and have a second nest at this time (May,
* 955 )-
In j 954 I was very fortunate in securing another split cock and his
mate--a yellow hen. These were really exceptionally fine birds, very
large and robust, and great hopes were entertained for them. However,
counting your chickens, or yellow Red-rumps, before they hatch is a

poor policy and the lovely yellow hen got stuck in the moult and died.
tC * S * nC t ^ le ^ nest coc ^ s I have ever seen and so it was
decided that the only alternative was to mate him to a young normal
female, especially chosen for her size and good colour. They were
placed together in the fall of 1954 and hit it off perfectly, with the male
i \ mg instantly to her side and display and feeding taking place within
a few minutes of their introduction.
Throughout the winter the pair continued to be devoted and
exhibited the devotion to each other that mated pairs of Red-rumps
characteristically show. It was a great disappointment, then, when
one morning in February the hen was found to be in a semi-paralysed
condition. This condition persisted, and each day she grew a little
weaker and more helpless and eventually died. A post-mortem
revealed a ruptured vessel in the brain and the probable cause was a
night fright caused by some cat.
As the breeding season was now fast approaching, every effort was
made to find a good breeding hen. Although a two-year-old hen
would have been preferred, the only available hen was a year-old bird
and so she was obtained.
The cock was now, in early March, in high breeding condition,
and for this reason I hesitated about releasing the hen directly into
his aviary. However, this plan was followed and the cock expressed
his immediate approval and satisfaction by displaying and calling
and attempting to feed the new arrival. For the first few days the
hen was a little skittish and did not accept his advances too readily,
ut fortunately the cock did not fly into a rage, and was reasonable
about the situation, so that at the end of the week the new hen was
quite ready to be courted. As March progressed, a nest was intro-
duced and the hen became quite steady and very much interested in
the nest-box. Within a few days after the introduction of the nest-
box, pairings were observed during the early morning and evening
ours. After this the hen began to spend an increasing amount of
time in the nest getting it ready for family use.
During the first few days of incubation the hen was nervous and sat
very lightly, coming off if anyone entered the aviary. Within a few
more days she settled down and was rarely seen out and away from
the nest. If she did observe anyone about when she was off feeding,
she would immediately fly to the box and tumble in it with great
rapidity. At the end of the second week of incubation a chance to
inspect the nest presented itself, and a very cursory glance revealed
seven eggs, the majority of which appeared fertile.
About the twenty-third day after incubation began, a broken egg-
shell was found on the floor of the aviary. With this favourable sign
the amounts of hemp, soaked bread, and greens such as j boa annua ,

206 d. m. west--breeding of yellow red-rumped parrakeet
nest-box was known to contain seven eggs, one could hardly resist
dreaming of seven youngsters--at least some of them yellows !
All continued to progress smoothly and after the end of the first
week the hen continued to spend more time away from the nest.
Both parents continued to eat large amounts of food, so it was felt
that the young were probably progressing satisfactorily. When the
babies were about seventeen days old, I weakened, and took a look.
There were five youngsters and one egg--but no sign of the seventh
egg. The examination revealed what had been secretly hoped for--
a lovely yellow chick, with just a few of the yellow feathers beginning
to appear.
From this point on, no further investigations were made. The
young began to leave the nest about the thirty-third day subsequent to
the estimated date of hatching and were easily seen to be three cocks
and two hens. Upon first leaving the nest the youngsters were a little
uncertain on the wing, but this condition improved very rapidly and
within the week they were very expert.
From past experience with Red-rumps and their close ally the
Many-coloured, it was realized that a careful watch would be necessary
to prevent the parents from turning on their young in their zeal for a
second nest. Beginning about the fifth day the male began to chase the
young males about and, so as to protect the youngsters, he was
caught and placed in an adjoining pen. He continued to feed the
young through the wire and at the end of the tenth day the five young
were caught up and placed in another aviary and the parents then
placed together again.
A few notes on the physical surroundings of this pair may be of
some value and interest. The breeding pen was 8 feet high, 3 feet wide,
and 15 feet long. A shelter at one end was provided, though the pair
used it only on rainy days, very seldom using it on a rainy night.
They like to roost in a corner against some of the wooden studs and in
one of the most exposed portions of the aviary.
The diet consisted of all the sunflower they wanted and another
bowl of mixed canary, millet, hemp, and oats. They are not very fond
of fruit, but will eat a little of their daily apple and orange. They like
fresh corn on the cob and will spend a great deal of time working on
an ear of it. Greens of all kinds are appreciated.
The nest-box itself was about 12 inches wide, 10 inches high, and
about 18 inches deep--a little larger than is usually used for Red-
rumps here in California. The nest was hung just under the edge of
the shelter, so as to provide maximum ventilation and light and still
not be in the rain or sun. Fine wood chips were used inside the box.
Young Red-rumps mature very rapidly and often will breed when
just a year old. My personal experience has been that they are never
safe with other birds during the breeding season. I have had extra

males that would not hesitate to attack Crimson-wings in the spring,
although they were agreeable enough together during the winter
months. A pair of Red-rumps will work together in a team (like
Blue-bonnets) in any fracas and, so to be on the safe side, it is best
to keep the Red-rumps apart from mixed collections of birds.
\ oung males colour rapidly and within a few short months
after leaving the nest are nearly in adult plumage. Males of the year
are almost never as bright as older males, but there are exceptions.
A young male raised two years ago was always a more brilliantly
coloured bird than the father and unusually highly coloured upon
leaving the nest.
As the yellow Red-rump is a sex-linked mutation, the next step is
to mate the yellow daughter back to her father, and from this union
yellows of both sexes might be anticipated. As I have never seen a
yellow cock, I am very hopeful that next year will produce at least one
yellow Red-rump cock.

By W. H. Payn (Hartest, Suffolk, England)
During the past few years a number of hybrid ducks of definite
parentage have been reared in my collection here in Suffolk. Whilst
I am aware that hybrids are not to everyone's liking, I nevertheless
feel that a description of them should be recorded in the Avicultural
Magazine for the benefit of those interested in the interbreeding of
species.
At least two of these hybrids have occurred before in captivity, one
fairly frequently. Pairs of the first two are now on view at the Wild-
fowl Trust, Slimbridge.
"
Common Sheld-duck (Tadorna tadorna) X Ruddy Sheld-dugk (Casarca
ferruginea ).
A brood of eight was reared, four males and four females.
Day-old Duckling .--Like Common Sheld-Duck, with pale spot in
centre of dark patch on shoulders.
Adult Male .--An extremely handsome bird, resembling the Common
rather than the Ruddy Sheld-Duck, in voice, build, shape of bill, and
general habits.
Body colour a very rich, deep chestnut ochre, much darker than the
Ruddy Sheld-Duck. Head deep chestnut-brown ; cheeks, paler;
traces of white collar. Belly deep brown ; rump, greyish-white, heavily
pencilled black. Tail and upper tail-coverts glossy black ; under
tail-coverts rich chestnut. Wings as in Common Sheld-Duck, but

scapulars pencilled black. Secondary wing-coverts have inner web
white, outer web chestnut. Feet and legs grey flesh ; bill pinkish,
mottled black.
Adult Female .--Greyish, heavily pencilled black, but with a bright
chestnut wash on breast and shoulders, and a pale chestnut wash on
wings and lower back. Belly dark brown. Head greyish-chestnut with
broad white collar. Eyelids and base of bill white. Bill grey with
slight pink tinge. Wings and feet as in male.
Pintail (Anas acuta ) X Mallard (Anas platyrhynchos).
Three reared, two drakes, one duck.
Day-old Duckling. --Exactly like Pintail, but more robust.
Adult Male. --Head deep bronze-green with broad white collar
extending up sides of neck. Mantle and flanks light grey finely
pencilled darker. Upper and under tail-coverts black. Breast
brownish-orange, darker at sides. Belly white. Tail black, centre
feathers elongated and slightly up-curled (much longer and less
curled than in Mallard). Wing mirror dark green with chestnut bar
above and black-and-white bars below. Bill as in Pintail drake. Feet
and legs yellow-ochre, webs darker.
Adult Female. --General plumage pattern follows female Mallard,
but colouring much greyer. Head like Pintail but greyer, fringes to
mantle pale and narrow. Lower breast white, less heavily streaked
than Pintail. Two central tail-feathers elongated. Upper wing-
coverts greyish. Wing mirror as in male. Feet and legs greyish-ochre,
webs darker. Bill dingy yellow. In general appearance these hybrids
resemble Pintail rather than Mallard, being slim and long-necked.
Tufted Duck (Ay thy a fuligula) X Mallard (Anas platyrhynchos).
Two hatched, one female reared.
Day-old Duckling. --As Mallard, but darker.
Adult Female. --Resembles a large, thickset Tufted Duck. Head
dark brown, cheeks paler, heavily freckled darker. Mantle, lower
back and upper tail-coverts rich dark brown, with paler fringes.
Tail grey, under tail-coverts whitish. Breast brownish, heavily barred
dark brown. Belly and flanks dirty white, mottled grey-brown.
Wing-mirror greyish with two white bars. Scapulars have greenish
sheen. Iris dark brown. Feet grey-green, webs black. Bill black with
grey band.
This bird began diving freely when about seven days old. In
general habits resembles Tufted Duck, but it is a noisy bird, with a
harsh quack.
In addition to the above, a hybrid Common Teal (Anas crecca) X
Shoveler (Spatula clypeata) was reared here in 1943, a full description
being published in the Ibis, October, 1943, and Bull. B.O.C., May, 1949.

By Derek Goodwin (Virginia Water, Surrey, England)
Those who read the previous accounts (Goodwin, 1953 and 1954)
of my Lanceolated Jays may perhaps be interested to learn how they
have fared (so far) this year.
Once again the male Yellow (birds are named after colour of their
leg rings) and the female White refused to pair with each other, even
though I had moved them to an aviary some way away from, but
unfortunately not out of sight and hearing, of the others. Green and
Blue nested early in the same site as in 1954. Blue laid the first of her
clutch of five eggs on 13th April. The previous two mornings having,
as previously, seen " dress rehearsals " of the laying.
On 30th April at least two young had hatched. On 5th May,
when I looked again the nest contained three young only, two of
which were somewhat larger than the third. On 7th May only two
young remained. Blue's belly feathers were stiff and clotted with
dried blood, so that she is very strongly suspected of having killed and
eaten one of her children. The young stayed rather long in the nest
or on its edge and it was not until 24th or 25th May that they definitely
left it. Next morning, after a wet night, one was found soaked and
dead among the grass. The other is so far (date of writing, 22nd June)
doing well. It has been feeding itself to some extent for about ten
days, but is still fed regularly by Green, although its mother, Blue, has
recently lost interest in it and attacks it when it begs from her.
The feeding regime differed from that of last year only in that, owing
to the lateness and scantiness of the local caterpillars and cockchafer
crops, I was unable to supplement the ration with these. Hence
mealworms and ant pupae were at least 99 per cent of the insect food
given the young. Perhaps as a result, the young developed rather
more slowly and the survivor showed a marked improvement after
leaving the nest, due, I think, to the parents then feeding milk-sop and
other artificial food to a greater extent. As with the 1954 young one,
the present biid, although showing all the other typical juvenile
plumage characters, has the blue on wings and tail as bright as in the
adults.
To my surprise Blue, in early June, laid three more eggs in the same
nest, which they had relined after removing the old lining. As I
contemplated leaving home for some weeks in late June, I was a bit
peiturbed at this development. Blue, however, solved the problem
by eating or hiding her eggs (I suspect the former) after having in-
cubated about a week. This may well have been due to my looking
at the nest too often. I think, however, the time of year and onset of
the moult may have been of more importance in causing this lapse.

I think the laying of a second clutch was an unnatural piece of be-
haviour caused by the birds not having to expend a great deal of
energy in seeking food for their young, as wild Jays do. Certainly
the male Green was in full sexual condition throughout the whole of
the incubation and rearing periods, constantly displaying to his mate
and often trying to copulate with her, whenever she came off the nest.
The behaviour of the birds was as in 1954, Blue protesting violently
whenever I went anywhere near the nest, but Green showing no signs
of alarm or anger. If, however, a stranger entered the aviary he
would at once scold as vehemently as his mate.

Each Section will have a Chairman, who will be an ornithologist
from Africa, having knowledge of the subject. Each Section will also
have a Recorder, whose primary duty will be to note the main points
raised in the discussions.
On the final day of the Congress, distinguished ornithologists
specializing in the subjects of each section will be invited to sum up the
contribution made by the papers in that section.
Hours. The hours for the sessions will be 9 to 12.30 in the mornings,
and 2.15 to 4.45 in the afternoons.
Excursions. There will probably be three excursions, one or two
before the Congress begins and one or two after it has ended. One of
these excursions will probably last a week and others two or three
days each.

The true wild Canary ( Serinus canarius) must be a rare bird in collec-
tions nowadays. These large Serins must originally have been kept
more for their song than for their appearance. They seem to have been
first imported into Europe early in the 16th century and evidently took
well to captivity, for it is of course from them that the many fancy
breeds have been evolved by selective breeding. Four of these wild
birds have been presented by Senor Martins of Madeira, where they
ai e apparently not uncommon, but I do not know whether they are
still plentiful in the remainder of their range--the Canary Islands and
the Azores. It will be interesting to see how their song compares
with that of the domesticated birds.
Other birds of interest received during the past two months include
eighteen Tovi Parrakeets {Brotogeris jugularis), two Petz's Conures
(Eupsittula canicularis) , and a young Amazon parrot not yet identified.
These were all sent from San Salvador by Mr. W. H. Chippendale,
who also sent a White-browed or Spectacled Parrot (. Amazona albi-
frons), but it was ill on arrival and died a few hours later.
Some waders--a Redshank, a Bar-tailed Godwit, a Turnstone,
an Oystei-catcher, a F)unlin and two Ringed Plovers--have been
piesented by the Copenhagen Zoo. Two Fraser's Eagle-Owls ( Bubo
pcensis ), a Common Quail ( Coturnix coturnix), and a Forest Senegal

Kingfisher ( Halcyon senegalensis fuscopileus) , new to the Collection, have
also been presented.
The most delightful of the newcomers are four Sun Gem Humming
Birds ( Heliactin cornutus) and a Frilled Coquette Humming Bird
(.Lophornis magnified), neither species having been in the Gardens before.
The Sun Gems are exquisite; they have black faces and black pointed
beards, the top of the head is a metallic blue and on either side of the
head is a horn-like tuft of golden-green feathers. The back is pale
golden-green and the underside is white, while the long tail is brown-
ish-green and white. The females are golden-green above and white
beneath. The Frilled Coquette must be one of the very smallest of
the Humming Birds and the wings are comparatively short, so that
the hum produced in flight is of a higher pitch than that of the
longer-winged birds. All these were presented by Mr. H. Randau.
A Brazilian Swallow-tailed Humming Bird ( Eupetomena macroura)
has been received in exchange.
The nesting birds include King Penguins, two pairs having eggs,
Snowy Owls, Grey-winged Trumpeters, Brush Turkeys, Red-
breasted Geese, Green-winged King Parrakeets, Quaker Parrakeets,
Masked Lovebirds, and Cockatiels. The Rheas have three eggs so far,
the Choughs nested but threw the eggs out, and the Stone Curlews
have laid two or three clutches, but do not sit on them, possibly be-
cause of the presence of other Stone Curlews in the aviary. Egyptian,
Upland and Canada Geese have some well-grown goslings.
Three Sunbirds have just arrived from Singapore as a present
from Squadron-Leader K. C. Searle. They are two male Malayan
Yellow-breasted--Yellow-bellied would be a more appropriate name
--and a Malaccan or Brown-throated ( Anthreptes malacensis ), a far
more beautiful bird than it appears from the coloured plate in The
Birds of the Malay Peninsula.

Edinburgh Zoo.--D. Bowles, Director-Secretary, reports of the
penguins in 1954 : " Several records were established in breeding
these birds. In the first place, a total of fifteen were hatched and
reared without loss ; this is the first occasion upon which no chick has
died before reaching maturity but it is only fair to say that the excep-
tionally wet summer may have contributed to this success. The
distribution of births among the species was seven Kings, four Gentoos,
three Maccaronis, and one Ringed."

its head more conspicuously adorned than its congener E. crestatus ,

Parrots in Sir Edward Hallstrom's Collection
I have just returned from a very brief visit to Sydney and took the opportunity
of seeing Sir Edward Hallstrom's collection and also Taronga Park. Sir Edward
now has ten of the true Golden-shouldered Parrakeet (Ps. chrysopterygius) which
I had never seen in life before, as well as several hybrids bred from the first two
cocks he obtained, mated with Hooded hens. He has a large number of the hybrids
from Many-coloured X Hooded and whilst the adult cocks are quite close to Paradise
Parrakeets (although having a yellow instead of a red frontal band), the adult hens
are not a bit like Paradise hens, but are intermediate between Hooded and Red-
rumped hens, without even as much colour as a Many-coloured hen. Another bird
new to me was the Blue-cheeked Rosella (PL amathusia) which is the extreme northern
race of the common Pale-headed or Mealy Rosella (PL adscitus ). They have more
blue on the cheeks, a creamy patch on the upper breast, and the lacing on the mantle
is not as golden as in the Pale-headed, but appears to be suffused with blue. In addition,
they are smaller. Sir Edward had three examples of these. He has a large number
of yellow Indian Ring-necks, breeding freely; almost certainly the only ones in
Australia. There were several pairs of Musschenbroek's Lorikeets ( Neopsittacus
musschenbroeki ) and two pairs had a recently fledged young one ; I am not sure whether
this breeding success of his has been recorded previously.
He now has ten fine examples of the Glossy Black Cockatoo and the young bird
that he bred last year is now independent. He still has quite a number of the Double-
eyed Dwarf Parrot ( 0 . diophthalma) which have hatched young but never reared
them ; he also has a single example of 0 . edwardsi (a hen).
Taronga Park is always interesting. New birds to me that were on exhibition
there were the White-headed Pigeon ( Columba norfolciensis) , which is commonly
known as the " Baldy ", and a Grey Goshawk ( Astur novaehollandiae ) which I had
once seen in the wild state, but never in captivity. They have nearly 150 Birds
of Paradise on exhibition.
I still have no birds of my own, but my elder son acquired a pair of Leadbeater's
Cockatoos last spring and they promptly reared a young one for him ! He is now
anxious to try out some of the other Cockatoos. He also has a pair of Red-collared
and a pair of Scaly-breasted Lorikeets.

To most of the members of the Avicultural Society the news of the
death of our President which occurred on 1st August, has come as
a great shock, and to the many who knew him well as the realization
of the loss of a dear friend.
Alfred Ezra was the son of Elias David Ezra, a prominent Jewish
merchant in Calcutta, his brother the late Sir David Ezra, several
times Mayor of Calcutta, being a frequent visitor to this country and
also a great aviculturist. Alfred took up his residence in England after
some extensive travelling in the Pamirs and Turkestan where he
collected many fine hunting trophies and became very interested in
the birds he encountered. Although he had a London house he always
preferred the country so, in 1919, he acquired the 300 acre estate of
Foxwarren Park, Cobham, Surrey, in which he was able to indulge
his ambition of keeping rare foreign birds and mammals under ideal
conditions. Strangely enough, a former owner had at one time kept
cockatoos and other parrots at liberty there.
Ranges of large aviaries were erected for the smaller birds as well
as for parrakeets, on a site ideal for the purpose where there was plenty
of sunshine, but protection from winds, while enclosures were made for
cranes and strong fences erected to enclose large areas for deer,
antelopes and wallabies. A stream running through the park was
enlarged in places to form ponds for ducks, and these proved so
successful that a number of the rarer species were kept successfully and
many bred. Geese of the rarer kinds enjoyed a large range in the park.
The collection grew rapidly, the aviaries becoming well stocked
with some of the greatest rarities such as, for instance, Renauld's
Ground Cuckoos, several kinds of plovers, Sun Bitterns, South African
Bee-eaters, Crowned Pigeons, and so on. And he had many successes
n breeding species never before bred in captivity.
Many of us remember the fine range of aviaries for parrakeets

Nearly forty years ago, during the first world war, I met Alfred
Ezra for the first time, through my old friend, the late Hubert Astley.
We had been corresponding for some years, of course. Ezra was a
pioneer in keeping nectar-feeding birds, and he had invented the
formula, still in use to-day, of a mixture of honey, milk, and Mellin's
food, to keep alive the lovely Sunbirds of India and, later on, those
of Africa, as well as American Humming Birds. The late Marquis
de Segur, who kept in Paris a splendid collection of Humming Birds
and Sunbirds and had let me have some in 1913--14, had then put me
in touch with Ezra. Having the same tastes and interests we very
soon became close friends, and this friendship grew up and became
closer through the years.
Between the two wars I used to spend a week or two in England
each month, when I was not travelling far from Europe. Most of
my time in England was spent with Ezra, and his houses in London
and at Foxwarren were almost as much home for me as was Cleres,
where he also often stayed. Together we used to visit friends and to
see bird collections all over England and France. We went to bird-
shows, we attended the meetings of zoological and ornithological
clubs and societies, year after year. We sat together on. the Council
of the London Zoo. We practically owned in common our animals
and birds, as we shared in the same collecting expeditions and we were
constantly giving each other specimens we obtained or reared. Ezra's
generosity and unselfishness were proverbial and I certainly have
benefited from them more than anybody else. We thus had twenty
years of delightful friendship and close association, including a
marvellous trip to India in 1933-34. His elder brother, Sir David
Ezra, then kept in his Calcutta house and garden an astonishing
number of animals and birds, many of which, every year, found
their way to Foxwarren and to Cleres. A large part of the birds
which I brought over from Indochina also went to Foxwarren. In
those happy days both our collections were incredibly rich and
interesting, full of rare species we had almost never dreamt to possess.
Excellent collectors such as Messrs. Webb, Cordier, Frost, and Shaw-
Mayer were constantly bringing us great rarities from all parts of
the earth, many imported for the first time, and it is probable that
never again will aviculture reach such a high level.

But the best things in this world come to an end. The 1939-1944
war entirely destroyed my collection in France, while that of Ezra
had to be curtailed to a depressing degree. He, however, kept a
number of birds and animals ; whatever he could feed. Even after
the war his collection never approached its past standard. Age and
illness, as well as other difficulties, had become an overwhelming
handicap, but there are still a number of interesting specimens
at Foxwarren to-day.
Until last year, the annual garden party he gave the Avicultural
Society at Foxwarren was the highlight of the activities of its members
The generous hospitality of Mr. and Mrs. Ezra has been well known
not only in England, but throughout the world. Many foreigners,
particularly American and French aviculturists, were welcomed
repeatedly in a way they will never forget.
With the passing away of Alfred Ezra, a happy, prosperous, and
delightful era has gone. I probably will miss him more than anyone
else, as he was my best friend. But my sorrow is shared by many
others, not only in England, but in France, in the United States, and
all over the world.

When I learned from the July-August number of the Avicultural
Magazine of the death of Mr. Alfred Ezra, President of the Avicultural
Society, I was both sadly surprised and profoundly grieved.
Surprised, because though I had known for some time that his
health was in a precarious state, all the more serious because of his
advanced age, I held this great authority on ornithology and
aviculture in such high esteem and admiration that I had come to
regard him as having acquired a halo of immortality.
Profoundly grieved, because the death of someone of such noble
character, endowed with great qualities of heart and mind, a great
willingness to help, charming courtesy and a wide knowledge
generously placed at the disposal of all, means for every ornithologist,
for every aviculturist, the loss of an experienced counsellor who was
also a good friend.
For all those who, throughout the world, are interested in breeding
and rearing birds in captivity, the name of Alfred Ezra is, and will
remain, as a symbol of what I should like to term " ornithological
humanism ", in the most noble sense of the word.
His memory will for ever remain in the hearts of those who, in
varying degrees, share his ideals.

A year ago, when representing the journal Die Gefierderte Welt , and
thereby as spokesman of the majority of German aviculturists, I was
able to attend the Diamond Jubilee of the Avicultural Society in
London, it was a special pleasure to me to be introduced to Mr. Ezra,
whose numerous important articles on aviculture had been known to
me for a long time. Above all I remember his articles, ranging over
thirty years, in which he clearly and concisely described, with expert
knowledge, so many first breeding successes and valuable observations
made in Foxwarren Park, and, in addition, accounts of his travels.
This information was a substantial contribution to aviculture and
thereby to the science of ornithology.
With feelings of sadness I now recall the Garden Party at Foxwarren
Park to which Mr. Ezra invited the 150 participants of the Diamond
Jubilee, on 19th June, 1954--the wonderful park with the distant view
over the rolling southern country--the beautifully situated and richly
filled aviaries--the generous hospitality of our host, and the way he
took part in everything in spite of his physical difficulties and ill health.
The German aviculturists unite in paying a high tribute to the
memory of Mr. Ezra and through me express to the Avicultural
Society, with whom they have always felt most cordially linked, their
heartfelt condolences.

I have learnt with the greatest regret of the loss of our President,
Alfred Ezra. The distance at which I live and the circumstances of
my life have prevented me from being in such close contact with him
and appreciating his high qualities and his great interest in aviculture
and birds as much as I should have liked. It is about thirty years since
I was first in communication with his brother, Sir David Ezra, at the

Indian birds, among which were Black-breasted Francolins, several
pairs of Jungle Bush Quail (Perdicula asiatica) which have bred in my
aviaries, and a female of the rare Malay Peacock Pheasant (.Polyplectron
malacense ).
Each time that I have been to London I have had the pleasure of
visiting the President of the Avicultural Society at his beautiful estate
at Cobham. I remember in 1934 when he invited the members of
the Vllth International Ornithological Congress, which was held at
Oxford, to visit his collection of birds, we all admired the yellow and
blue varieties of the Alexandrine Parrakeet and the Sarus Cranes
nesting. T. he last time that I had the opportunity of visiting him, in
x 95 2 j w hen he was already ill, he courteously accompanied me in his
electric chair to look at the Specifer Peafowl, and the Blue Eared
Pheasants which he kept at liberty in his park with the Mandarin
Ducks which flew about like wild birds. He derived much pleasure
from his two flocks ol Chukor Partridges which were bred in the park
and used to come up to the house for food, just like domestic fowls.
I pay a sad and respectful tribute to his memory, and express my
sincere condolences to Mrs. Ezra and his daughters, and also to his
niece who acted as a link between her uncle and me by visiting me
in Bologna whenever she was travelling on the Continent.

(.Aratinga pertinax chrysophrys)
By A. A. Prestwich (Southgate, England)
During May and June, 1952, the trade offered a large number of
parrakeets, wrongly described as " St. Thomas's Conures "--in
reality the Yellow-cheeked Gonure. As far as can be judged this
was a subspecies new to aviculture. A description is unnecessary as
there is a Reid-Henry coloured plate in the July-August, 1954, number
of the Magazine.
We obtained six birds in the hope that there would be at least
one pair amongst them. Conures generally seem particularly difficult
to sex as the colouring of both sexes is practically identical. I am sure
that out of the breeding season it is quite wrong to suppose that
because they sit in couples they are necessarily pairs. I have noticed this
repeatedly with our Red-faced Lovebirds ; two males or two females
are perfectly happy together, even when they could, if they wished,
find a companion of the opposite sex. So long as they have com-
panionship they do not appear to be particular about its source.
From time to time we were offered these Conures in ones and twos,
so that eventually we had no less than fifteen. Evidently this sub-
species did not prove a particularly welcome newcomer to the aviaries
of Great Britain. And probably with good reason. Our experience
is that it is one of the less desirable members of its group, being very
noisy, destructive, but boisterous rather than really quarrelsome--
although on several occasions we have effected rescues only just in
time after a sudden collective onslaught. Conure species appear to
be great believers in lynch law.
! 954 we had two couples in one of our 30 ft. flights and four
couples in another. Numerous converted ammunition-boxes, internal
measurements 15 inches high, base 9 inches by 6^- inches, containing
turf and peat, hung at an angle of about 30* from vertical, hole facing
north, were provided. We hoped the couples would resolve them-
selves into true pairs. The two couples did, in fact, prove to be
pairs and nested, producing four and five eggs respectively. They
failed to complete incubation ; due, I believe, to the fact that both
pairs regarded both nest-boxes as joint property and entered them
indiscriminately.
The eight birds in the second aviary made no attempt to nest, nor
did they evince any interest whatever in the nest-boxes. During the
winter two of the eight died as the result of frozen feet and a third
sustained a broken neck, possibly through a night fright. Thus hopes
for 1955 were centred on two pairs in one aviary and five birds in
the second.

Towards the middle of June one of the two proved hens appeared
to be taking more than usual interest in one of the boxes, and it soon
became evident that she really intended to nest. The first ego- was
ai on the iCth June, followed by four more on successive days *
sitting commenced with the second egg. We believe the first hatched
on 12th July an incubation period of 25-26 days, and a second the
next day ; the remaining eggs had dried up.
1 he first young one, a fine, strong flyer, an exact replica of its
parents, but a trifle less brightly coloured, left the nest on 30th August
-nearly eleven weeks after the laying of the first egg. The second, a
poor flyer with a marked shortage of feathers on its back, left the nest
the next day, possibly somewhat prematurely.
We were very surprised this nesting attempt reached such a
successful conclusion as the whole episode coincided with the three
months of heatwave and drought. The hen was very restless while
incubating ; she never appeared to be taking her duties seriously and
m the daytime spent frequent periods looking out of the nest-hole.
Tater, during the intensely hot weather she sat and literally gasped
How the young ones survived in what must have been an inferno is
little short of miraculous.
During the day the male spent most of the time warding off the
intrusions of the second pair, and this he succeeded in doing with
nothing worse than the loss of an occasional feather on one side or the
other. At night he retired into the nest-box. When they first emerged
the young ones were treated with a deal of hostility by the non-breeding
pair, but their parents always had the situation well in hand, and
within a day or so they were accepted.
The parents were not provided with any extras and only had their
routine foods--seed mixture, soaked millet sprays and almost unlimited
soit, sweet apple. Green food as available--chickweed, groundsel,
sow thistle,, spinach, etc.--was, as usual, supplied, but they did little
more than just pick it over.
The five in the other aviary have spent much time in the various
nest-boxes, but so far without result.
As described above, A. A. Prestwich has bred the Yellow-cheeked
Gonure (Aratinga pertinax chrysophrys ). It is believed that this may be
a first success.

subspecies in Great Britain or Northern Ireland is requested to

(.Pipilo maculatus oregonus)
By C. M. Payne (Barford, Warwick, England)
During the Autumn of 1953 a friend in Canada sent me two pairs
of Oregon Towhees (Pipilo maculatus oregonus) which arrived in
beautiful condition. They were quite tame and confiding and
quickly settled down to life in one of my aviaries. A description may
not come amiss, particularly as the birds, although not unknown, are
somewhat rare in this country.
Male .--Jet black above, including head, neck, and upper breast,
cutting sharply across chest against pure white underparts. A broad
bar of reddish-brown or bay along flanks. Wing-coverts and outer
scapulars conspicuously spotted with white.
Female. --Similar, but the black greyish.
The birds are found in western North America. In Canada from
south-eastern Manitoba and south Saskatchewan westward through
southern British Columbia to the coast. It is a resident on the coast
and migrant elsewhere.
The Towhees are very easy to feed, softbill mixture and seeds as given
in a mixed collection suits them admirably.
During 1954 I could not spare a separate aviary for the Towhees
and they had to share one with a pair of Nanday Conures which that
year reared two young, also quite an unusual breeding success. Unfortu-
nately, although the Towhees did not interfere with the Conures, the
same cannot be said of the Conures, although they allowed the Towhees
to build a nest and lay three eggs which appeared fertile, they one
day upset the nest and broke the eggs ; I don't think out of spite, but
rather from an inquisitive turn of mind.
During the early part of 1955 I moved my home and so had to
construct new aviaries, and although I have in fact built quite a few,
I still haven't enough--a common complaint. So the Towhees once
again had to share, this time with Ring Ouzels, American Robins,
Golden-crowned Sparrows, a Varied Thrush, and perhaps strangest
of all, three pairs of Fischer's Lovebirds.
During early May my aviary attendant told me he had seen the
hen Towhee carrying dried grasses about the aviary--these are
the reports which I await eagerly each year--the first sight of a bird
carrying nesting material about the aviary raises one's hopes, often
to be dashed to the ground later on. I watched and saw the hen
carrying some bents to a corner of the flight and on inspection I saw
the first stages of a nest under construction. It was built directly on
the floor and it may be noted that in 1954 the birds built about
18 inches from the ground in a clump of gorse. Both nests were built
of grasses and bents with no lining, reminding one very much of

the nest of the Yellow Hammer, in fact, the birds appear to have
quite a lot in common with Yellow Hammers--the same skulking
among the lower bushes and brambles, and occasionally being seen
on a dead branch, or other conspicuous perch. During the courtship
the cock Towhee spreads his tail and shows more clearly the white
and at the end. At the same time he puffs out his side feathers and
shows off his beautiful spots. No mating was witnessed. Three e^s
were laid at daily intervals and in due course, about fourteen days after
incubation seriously, began, there appeared one small Towhee which
although light in skin was covered in blackish down. The difficulty
then began ; how to feed live food without all the other inmates
devouring the gentles before the placid Towhees could get enough for
their baby. I took the risk of putting a tin of gentles quite near the
nest, hoping the Towhees would gain confidence and keep off the
others and, within limits, the arrangement worked. The Towhees
helped themselves for the youngster, and then the other birds, par-
ticularly the Varied Thrush, gorged on the remainder. After a few
days my man began to throw a few gentles near the nest every time
he passed the aviary--it can be said that the bird was reared entirely
on gentles with a few earth-worms as an appetizer. The baby left the
nest when fourteen days old and was self-supporting at one month *
however, whether due to the type of food given during the early
stages, or inherent in the birds, the chick's feet were imperfect in that
the back claw was pushed forward and accordingly the youngster,
although otherwise perfectly healthy, cannot perch properly.
There is really a second part to this breeding success. After this
youngster left the nest the parents immediately set about preparing
for another family. The original nest was repaired where necessary
and m due course four eggs were laid ; after fourteen days' incubation
three young Towhees appeared. As the method of feeding had been
successful when applied to the previous rearing we again placed a pot
of gentles near the nest so that the Towhees could have the first
helping. The young birds grew apace and indeed left the nest after
twelve days. By this time they had tails about half an inch long, but
were unable to fly any distance. However, this did not prove a handi-
cap because the old birds found them out, wherever they had managed
tD land and gam a foothold, and simply filled them with gentles.
Ihese three babies, like their elder brother, which I now know him
to be as he is already in the moult and the beautiful red sides with
its attendant white spots are increasing in area daily, look like very
dull baby Blackbirds ; they have the same mottled breast, their
overall colour being the same.
At the time of writing one youngster has passed on, having been
found with a serious head wound, no doubt caused by one of the
other inmates of the aviary. The remaining two are nearly self-

supporting, have quite long tails, and can get about the aviary without
the slightest trouble. They are very confiding and I am thankful
to say have no deformities like their elder brother.
Generally I find the birds most attractive, very placid, easy to
feed, mix extremely well, and indeed appear to have no faults in a
mixed aviary--something which cannot be said of many species.

BREEDING THE CITRON-CRESTED COCKATOO
(Kakatoe sulphurea citrino-cristata )
By S. Brian Kendall (Chertsey, Surrey, England)
</equation>
<bodyText confidence="0.98985252" page_id="58091675"  page_num="Page 226" year="" vol="">
The Citron-crested Cockatoo has always been a rare bird in captivity,
presumably as a result of its limited distribution (Sumba Island), but
during the temporary lifting of the ban on the importation of parrots
in 1952-1953 a number reached this country. There are at present
several odd males in different hands, but the hens are unfortunately
very few.
I bought my pair of birds separately in the early part of 1953, and
like Boosey (1953, 20) was very impressed by their extremely lovely
colour combination of orange, palest lemon-yellow, and snow-white.
In addition to their beautiful coloration they are also very attractive
in shape, being about intermediate in size between the Dwarf Sulphur-
crest (K. parvula) and the big Australian K. galerita, but without the
rather " over-beaked " appearance of the Dwarf. Adults are readily
sexed by the eye-colour, which is nearly black in the male and red-
brown in the female. In addition, the male is typically slightly larger,
has a considerably more massive bill and head, a markedly more richly
coloured crest and, in the examples I have seen, more yellow on the
breast and abdomen. Immatures probably always have dark eyes,
but can be sexed by the more massive head and bill. There is as yet
no information as to when the eye of the hen becomes red.
When first received my male was wing-clipped and wild. After a
time he became steady, but has always remained truculent and I do
not think he would ever have become really tame. By contrast the
hen, which arrived with a small leg-ring and chain, was a delightfully
tame and very lovable bird and it was a great temptation to keep

hei so. Very soon after being introduced to the male, however, she
lost all interest in her human friends and has remained as standoffish
as her mate ever since.
Fiom the beginning both birds displayed a great deal, the per-
formance being most elaborate after a temporary separation or when
danger was apprehended. The male usually commenced by hopping
movements towards the female, raising and lowering the wings, the
male often covering the female with his wings. This was followed
by a complicated bowing and head to tail display combined with
beak clicking. Mutual preening was never seen. Preening of any
description does not seem to be associated with sexual display.
During the summer of 1953, soon after they arrived, the pair took
some inteiest both in a grandfather clock and in a grape-barrel nest-
box, but nothing materialized. During the winter of 1953--54 they
remained in an open wire flight with an open fronted shelter. My
impression is that they are exceedingly hardy. In 1954 nesting
barrels were again cleaned out, starting at the end of March and
continuing until June or July. In August of 1954 the birds had a
moult which replaced all the clipped feathers, and they really began
to look like the lovely things they are.
In x 955 nest-boxes were put into the 35 ft. flight in the first
week of April : a grandfather clock facing north and a 15 gallon
barrel, on end, facing south. By 9th April the male was in the barrel,
the pair was seen copulating on 25th April, and during the week
ending 14th May both birds were in the barrel a good deal, sometimes
together. About this time there was a suggestion of the development
of an egg-pouch and after a day or so the hen looked definitely
pregnant. On the night of 18th May the hen remained in the barrel.
I believe this was the date of the first egg, and thereafter incubation
was evidently occurring. The hen seemed to do most of the serious
sitting, although the cock spent a good deal of the day in the barrel,
coming out, however, if anything interested him, and roosting out at
night. Food was occasionally taken into the box, and once or twice
green leaves, possibly for nest lining. On 16th June young were
heard, indicating an incubation period of about 28 days. Both
parents were in the box for the first time, on the night of the 18th,
a routine which was continued until the young fledged. Particularly
in the early days of rearing the young were very noisy ; a rapid
" Eek-eek-eek " presumably being the feeding note. In addition,
there were low grumbles and querulous whines.
The Citron-crests proved model parents, the young being very
rarely left by both parents even for the shortest period of time, and
even if the barrel had been accessible I do not think it would have
been possible to record progress without gross disturbance. I did
in fact manage to contain my interest until 28th July, when I was

able to look, with the aid of an electric torch, through the wires of
the aviary and into the nest hole. One young bird was fully feathered
and with a well developed orange crest. The parent in the barrel
appeared to be covering something else. On 3rd August I was able
to confirm that a second, considerably less mature young bird, was
alive.
The young were reported by members of my family to have com-
menced appearing at the nest hole from 28th July, but it was rarely
possible to obtain more than a fleeting glimpse of a bird in the shadows
of the barrel. One young one finally emerged on 22nd August and
both were out on the 26th. Within a day or so they were flying
strongly and they show every sign of developing into magnificent
specimens. Both have dark eyes, but they appear to be a true pair.
On 27th August all the birds roosted out in the open flight and the
young have never returned to the barrel.
Citron-crests are very easy to feed. Mine get a staple diet of
mixed chicken-corn which varies somewhat according to the whim
of the merchant, but essentially contains wheat, oats, barley, and
cracked maize. During the winter they receive sunflower seed two
or three times a week. During the breeding season they get unlimited
supplies of their usual seeds together with as much sunflower as they
want. In the morning they are given hard-boiled egg and bread-
crumbs, as supplied to canaries, and at night bread and milk and
assorted fruit (usually apple or plums). They are not very fond of
green food, which is, however, offered occasionally, but they adore
sweet-corn and hawthorn-berries in season. Sometimes I give small
quantities of other seeds, such as mixed canary seed, but it is difficult
to be sure just what they eat. I do not use cod-liver oil, but give
Vitamins A and D in another form during the dark months. I do not
use any of the extraordinary " aid " mixtures with which bird-keepers
are being bombarded nowadays.
At the time of writing (1st September), the young are still with
the parents. They are very strong on the wing, but I doubt if they
are feeding themselves. I was able to examine the nesting barrel
to-day for the first time and was unable to find any evidence of
infertile eggs or dead young, so it appears as if the record should read
laid--2, hatched--2, reared--2.
One year's breeding does not, of course, necessarily mean that the
species will be easy to establish in aviaries in Britain, but all the
evidence suggests that the Citron-crest should thrive at least as well
as the Leadbeater's Cockatoo. As the likelihood of further importations
seems remote, it is to be hoped that the very few hens which are
available will be used to the best advantage.

imported. Owing to its very sombre colour the bird would hardly
gain a great popularity among aviculturists. Colour description:
Entirely uniform blackish chocolate, somewhat obscurely mottled
with browner centres to the feathers, quills and tail feathers black,
iris brown. Total length 4-2 inches, culmen 0-45, wing 1-9, tail 1-43
tarsus 0*5. 5
In December, 1939, I obtained five birds of this species from Mr.
C. af Enehjelm, then living in Copenhagen. Early in 1939 Mr. W. R.
Partridge, of Southmore Foreign Bird Farm, had imported a small
consignment, and all were--as far as I know--secured by Mr.
Enehjelm. When joining the Forces in Finland in December, he
parted with his entire collection and, among other birds, I got the
Black Mannikins.
The birds, which were all ringed with coloured rings, were put in
a large cage for observation and sexing, and, after some time, they
turned out to be three cocks and two hens. One pair was put in a
box cage 30 inches long, with a basket nest. The result was, however,
very annoying, as the hen was chased by the cock so persistently that
I had to take her out of the cage, and later she died. The cock was
then mated to a hen Striated Mannikin and a young hybrid, some-
what lighter in colour than the Borneo Mannikin, was bred.
In January, 194** I put the other pair in an indoor flight, approxi-
mately 8 feet long, 5 feet high, and 3^ feet wide, with a window facing
south. No other birds were in the flight, which was provided with
large willow branches with leaves on, one Harzer wicker cage, and
three basket nests. One of the last-named, placed at a height of some
7 feet and with the open side facing the window, took their fancy and
a nest of coco-nut fibres and fine hay was built in a few days.

enter the flight, in order not to disturb the birds. At the beginning of
March, I heard a sound resembling that of young Bengalese being
fed. The sound became stronger day by day and I was sure there
were several young ones in the nest. On 17th March four fully
feathered youngsters left the nest. They resembled the parents,
except that the bill was entirely black. Already, after three to four
days, the youngsters started to feed and, after a fortnight, they were
independent. In the course of about a month the white rims of the
bill disappeared and the lower mandible got the light-grey colour of
the adult birds. Later on several youngsters were bred by the parents,
and eggs were also given to Bengalese, which brought up several
more.
The birds were fed on white and Indian millet, canary seed, and
condition seed. A soft food, consisting of hard-boiled egg and biscuit
and sprouted millet and canary seed, was also given regularly.

Since the opening of the new Conservatory-Aviary in Pittsburgh I
on 10th August, 1952? bird-nesting activities have been numerous, i
with young broods being successfully raised by several species. The
number of breeding successes has been severely curbed by the problem
of not having enough females for the predominantly male population.
This situation is being corrected at an exasperatingly slow pace, due
to the poor supply of female birds on the market. Among the species
that have leaied young successfully are: Rhamphocelus carbo, Maroon
Tanager, Molpastes cafer , Red-vented Bulbul; Copsychus malabaricus ,
Shama Thrush; Turdus migratorius, Eastern Robin; Richmondena
cardinalis , Eastern Cardinal; and Momotus momota, Motmot. Many
ol the unmated species have built nests, a good indication that, when
the aviary population is properly paired, our breeding results will
show a graphic rise. Other species which are nesting at this time are:
Pnotelus temnurus, Cuban Trogon; Dinemellia dinemelli, Dinemellis's
Weaver; and Garrulax leucolophus , White-crested Jay-Thrush.
Ed the present, we are most excited with the breeding success of
our Motmots. Both the male and female belong to the Momotus
momota group, but are distinctly subspecies. This gives us a hybrid
mating between two geographical races. It is most unfortunate that
we have no 1 eliable information concerning their place of origin,
as this would enable us to make accurate subspecific determination.

The fust indications of mating was observed on 1st February, when
the male bird was released into the room containing two females.
Within minutes the two females began vying for the attentions of the
larger male; first one, then the other, would perch alongside the
male, at which time their long tails began twitching rapidly from
side to side. Their throaty, flute-like notes were clearly audible as
conversation ensued between the birds. On 2nd February the male
[apparently favouied one of the arduous females, for together they
attacked with relentless savagery the other female, driving her to
seek shelter in areas where the vegetation was thick enough to afford
protection. Fearing for hei life, I removed the outcast bird and
placed her in another room. Before the male was introduced to the
room the two females were always friendly, never showing any signs
of hostility towards each other. This period of friendship lasted two
full years.
\\ ith the competition of the other female removed, courtship
activities began in earnest. The male became a most attentive suitor
showing his affections by carrying various choice food morsels to the
temale ; among these were mealworms, earthworms, fish, crayfish,
&amp;apos;oach, and pieces of raw ground meat At times he would approach
he female with a leaf or small stick in his bill. These visits were
requent and, when the two birds were perched near each other, a
Dendant tail-wagging party would take place. While the tails were
Deing switched the low, soft-syllabled, flute-like notes could be heard.
\t times these notes were barely audible, while at other times they
vere strong enough to be heard a distance of fifty feet. The main
lisplay performance of the male was the deliberate swinging movement
&amp;gt;f the tail being swung sharply from side to side. These movements
&amp;gt;f the tail were made for several minutes at a time and at a more
apid rate than is normally apparent.
t
Nesting
On 7th February the Motmots were observed attempting to tunnel
1 a bank where the tufa rock face had been removed to make room
)r a planting change in one corner of the room. Both male and
&amp;apos;male would take their turns at digging, although the male spent
)nger periods of time in the excavating work. As this bank was to be
2-walled with tufa rock at the completion of the planting, a new
esting site had to be provided. A pit was dug under the bridge
r hich runs through the centre of the room, resulting in a bank 4 feet
1 depth and 5 feet in width. To encourage the birds to adopt this

new site, I started two holes with the aid of a crowbar, digging them
back to a depth of i foot. On ioth February, both birds were seen
digging in one of the holes. As this provisional bank was shallow, I
removed the freshly dug earth at the bottom of the hole each day.
The digging was done entirely with the bill and the soil was pushed
out between the feet at a most remarkable rate. The excavation work
was sporadic and the digging was confined to the early morning
hours. On 2nd March the work was apparently finished for no fresh
earth was evident beneath the tunnel entrance. At this time all
courtship demonstrations on the part of the male had ceased. On
30th March the female was seen leaving the nesting tunnel. For the
next two weeks no activity was observed around the nest by either
bird. On 15th April the male was seen copulating with the female for
the first time. The female was seldom seen during the next seventeen
days and it was evident that incubation was under way. The male
never entered the nest to help with the incubation, but did carry food
to the female on the nest regularly.

The first evidence of young came on 3rd May, when both adults
were observed carrying food to the nest tunnel. Close observatior
was maintained over hourly periods taken at different times during
the day from 8 a.m. to 4 p.m. These observations showed the
male to be the main provider, making ten trips to the female's one
this was probably due to the female's shyness. The male, being finger
tame, was not alarmed at anyone watching his activities. Feeding
times showed an average of two trips an hour during the day, with 1
dozen trips or more when the birds were fed in the morning. On th&lt;
basis of two evening observations, the female brooded the youni
during the night. The food carried to the young was quite varied, and
outside of cockroaches and mice {Mus musculus), all their food wa
provided for them. This consisted of mealworms, earthworms, smelt
ground raw meat, shrimp, crayfish, minnows, and mixed foot
formulas.
All live food was beaten against a rock or tree limb and killec
before being fed to the young, with one exception, mealworms, whicl
were fed alive. The adults would not feed the young any one kind o
food over a period of time, but would purposely vary the afore
mentioned foods. One trip would be a mealworm, the next an earth
worm, then possibly a piece of meat or fish, etc. From observation
it was noted that the male bird never made more than three trip
with any one kind of food. This habit was consistent throughout th
entire feeding programme of the young ip the burrow. The mal
always left the nest-hole tail first, while the female always emerge*
head first. The female soon lost the racket tip of her tail from turnin

backing out. On the morning of 30th May, two bright-eyed
immaculately clean young Motmots put in their first aviary appear-
ance 1 he most striking part of the young birds was their short bills
and tails and, due to the short bill, their eyes seemed very large
The ta, rectnces showed the characteristic weakening of the barbules
at the shaft. In body, size, and colour they resemble the adults. The
wings were fully developed and they experienced no difficulty in
flying. Both young were exceedingly tame and permitted one to
approach within a few feet before taking alarm and flying.
Defence of Young
1 ,, 1 * 1 1 * * ate enough to witness the
male attacking and driving away from the nesting area a large wood
turtle. His attack would begin by flying down on the ground
confronting the advancing turtle with wings outspread and feathers
wn ? Ut &amp;apos;r .(TM) 1S &amp;apos;? s a PP arent &amp;gt;y to bluff the turtle into retreating.
W hen this failed to halt the advance, he quickly flew in and delivered
a hard thrust with his bill to the reptile's head. With two of these
blows the turtle wasted no time in beating a hasty retreat to the
sanctuary of the pool. Whenever the Cock-of-the-Rock (Rubicola
pemmam) appeared anywhere near the young, the male Motmot
attacked the larger bird with such determination that the Cock-of-the-
Rock would quickly leave the vicinity. The female Motmot was seen
chasing smaller birds away from the young on several occasions.
It had been the writer's intention to expose the nesting tunnel for
a cross-section photograph to include with this article. This decision
was changed when the male was observed copulating with the female
and renewing his mating performance on 2nd June. The female
was observed entering the nesting tunnel and, to all appearances, a
second nesting is in progress.
By 20th June the young were completely independent of their
parents for food. At this time the adults paid them no attention and
were proceeding with their second nesting.

Having enjoyed a garden decorated with Budgerigars for just over
hree years, I was delighted to know that at the London Zoo a liberty
wiary has been opened by the Duke of Bedford. It is a memorial to
Rs ather, the pioneer of homing budgerigars.

described by die late Duke of Bedford in his articles in the Avicultural
Magazine, and is all in the booklet Homing Budgevigavs , but it might
be of interest if I add just a little that I have learnt from my experience
with these liberty birds.
First, I know that one must aim at flying not less than two hundred
birds, and in the winter try and manage about three hundred. Half a
dozen birds here and there make no show at all; it is the flock of fifty
or more flying round which leaves people open-mouthed and speech-
less ! And to have a large number one must hang the nest-boxes in
three tiers, unless of course one intends building an aviary like a
miniature Albert Hall. Boxes placed at different levels do, however,
lead to differences of opinion between some birds. Amongst the
ladies there is the complete snob who cannot live in a basement flat,
but must have a top floor penthouse, and there is probably not one
of them vacant. Into battle she goes with beak and claws, and some
poor bird will be evicted unwillingly from her home. That trouble
maker must be caught and put into Holloway Prison, which is a small
aviary standing at some distance from the liberty one ; there she
must repent with other wicked women. The free-flying cock birds
will visit them and gurgle sweet nothings through the wire netting, (
which helps to reform them, and they are returned later to the big
aviary, only too willing to settle down to a peaceful married life.
Some birds breed in the winter, but I find fewer do so each year,
and this is obviously all to the good. Those that insist, I limit to two
eggs. During the summer, the clutches are not limited, and through
colour ringing a number of birds, I have proved that they do not breed
so young, as when kept in an enclosed aviary.
Every day the trap is taken out and the birds given their freedom,
though I do not do so, if there is a fog or a snowfall, but they have been
overtaken by both, at various times, with no ill-effects, but there was
an ugly rush for " Home ".
All millet and canary seed is dressed with cod liver oil in the winter,
and the birds have as many oats as they require. I never give frosted
green food, though they help themselves to plenty of frosted grass !
In very hard weather, the bowl of drinking water is stood over a tin
containing a night light. When grass seeds are plentiful in the summer,
the seed bill drops considerably, the birds will wander in flocks as far
away as half a mile in search of this food.
On the sides of the Woburn Aviary which is now at Whipsnade,
there were entrance funnels, to help young birds to find their way
home. I have never pampered them in this way, sooner or later the
one and only entrance will be discovered.
I only hope the liberty aviary at the Zoo is as successful as my own.
and one or two others I know of, as this great idea of giving Budgerigars
their freedom came from the late Duke of Bedford.

5. Platform-behaviour
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.993188931034483" page_id="58091688"  page_num="Page 235" year="" vol="">
From Selous s observations, the actions and ceremonies connected with
coition are quite elaborate--almost of the same order of elaboration as
the courtship-ceremonies , though the two rituals are completely independent
and appear to have developed along quite different lines.
Huxley, 1914 : 502.
In spite of their elaborateness, the courtship-ceremonies of the
Great Crested Grebe are not, strictly speaking, fundamental sexual
activities, unconnected as they are with the ritual surrounding copula-
tion. As was discussed previously, their primary function lies else-
where in the realm of appeasement rather than in that of sexual
stimulation. Now the picture may be completed, for those truly
fundamental activities of soliciting and copulation will in turn be
described and briefly discussed in this section, together with the other
aspect of the grebe s platform-behaviour--nest-building and the topics
connected with it. Treatment of the parental-behaviour (the long
routine of incubation and the raising of the young) will be the subject
of the final instalment.
No detailed description of what I have called the " platform-
behaviour " has yet appeared in the literature, and this account is based
mainly on my own material. At the turn of the century Selous published
some valuable observations in diary-form, which were later usefully&amp;apos;
summarized, clarified, analysed, and slightly amplified by Huxley in
I 9 I 4 * Further notes (and some Continental references) are given by
Hanzak whose paper, though extending our knowledge somewhat,
also contains some inaccuracies.
Narrative
Before the behaviour is described in more detail, a general picture
of the sequence of activities and of the routine at such times may be
traced.

Most pairs of Great Crested Grebes search for and select a nest site
after a variable period of courtship in open water (see p. 132 and
following). On well-populated lakes this site prospecting may lead
the birds into occupied territories from which they are driven, but

finally the pair usually manages to find an unclaimed spot or, more
rarely, to annexe part of an existing territory. While the two grebes
may begin to build a platform industriously on the very first day that
they have established themselves, often this initial work is of low
intensity only, especially if the couple is still courting well as is often
the case. Indeed, if relations with neighbours and intruders are
strained, and if the pair has had only a short courtship period
previously (see p. 196), the first days of the platform-cycle may be
largely taken up with such courtship and very little serious building
done. Soon, however, more purposive construction may begin. The
nest-platform can assume appreciable proportions in quite a short
time, as Huxley notes, and as soon as it does become solid enough to
support the weight of a grebe and lies not too far below the surface
of the water, soliciting may start, perhaps incompletely and irregularly
at first. Both male and female ascend the platform, one at a time, to
display. As soon as such soliciting becomes regular, the building tempo
slows down for the time being and a day or so later coition itself is
likely to commence. A period of intense sexual activity on the platform
follows and then declines as egg-laying nears. During this time of
reduced soliciting and copulation nest-building intensifies again.
Also, as in the first good period of building, the birds' attention may
not be confined to a single structure. For several days, too, before the
appearance of the eggs, male and female sit irregularly on the empty
nest-platform. At first this " premature-incubation " merely follows
periods of soliciting when sexual impulses are weak in at least one
of the partners. Later, during the period of declining sexual activity,
the grebes may definitely ascend the platform just to sit on it, extended
" spells-on " usually occurring when the mate is totally absent. There
is of course no regular alternation of the empty nest, as when true
incubation has started, and the shifts average much shorter, generally
not exceeding 10-15 minutes, though one female sat for as long as
70 minutes. Such behaviour is obviously an expression of the brooding
urge though grebes sitting on the empty nest perform none of those
activities done later in relation to the eggs--such as opening the
brood-patch, shuffling-down, and so on. Coition continues infrequently
during the laying period.
During these platform-stages, and it is especially noticeable in the
period just before egg-laying, the male and female take it in turns to
leave the Type B nesting-territory, that has no immediate access to
open water, to feed away from it, leaving one of them alone in the nest
area while the other is gone. A sexually responsive female grebe
sometimes advertises for her mate if he is overdue. Very occasionally
both partners are absent at the same time, but such a procedure has
obvious disadvantages, for it leaves the territory unguarded from
intruders and expanding neighbours. In those territories with

2 37
immediate access to free water, and in I ype A territories with their
defended feeding water, such a routine is less conspicuous of course.
Such, then, are the barebones of normal platform routine. The
shortest period known to me for the duration of these stages of the
cycle is about 8 days (Pair G in 194^) an d a week to a fortnight would
seem to be the lule in those pairs which start their cycles at the most
suitable time of the year from approximately April onwards. Some
pairs, however, start early. In 1949 one couple had already reached
the premature-incubation stage by the very beginning of January,
and in mild winters platform-behaviour is quite regular locally in a
minority of (? older) pairs from mid-January onwards. Gold spells,
and later wet ones, interfere with the cycles of such early birds and
prolong the platform-stages for as much as 2-3 months, the grebes
concerned even at times having to perform weather-movements to
ice-clear waters, perhaps the sea. 4 he first eggs never appear, locally,
earlier than mid-March.
Activity at " Substitute " Sites
From the regular to the irregular. The behaviour of those grebe
pairs that, although at a relatively high sexual pitch, do not manage
to establish themselves, at least initially, is full of interest. They
trespass furtively into the territories of other pairs and, if possible,
start to build or to use existing platforms for their brief, snatched
sessions of sexual behaviour, until observed and driven out by the
rightful owners. Such birds are the most likely of all grebes to employ
" substitute " platforms in places unoccupied by others and hardly
suitable for breeding. These substitute-sites are usually places such
as small hummocks of gravel, the overwashed and sloping sides of
banks, islets or sand-spits, and so on, all of which give support to the
soliciting grebe. One bird even ascended a floating plank of wood to
display. Occasional breeding is attempted at such places and young
sometimes reared. T he classical case was recorded at Burghfield in
* 949 - The pair in question (S 49) was first seen soliciting in the
shallow water of the sand-spit on 4th April, and platform-behaviour
continued until 13th April, except that no building of any sort occurred.
On the 14th of the month an egg was laid on the bare sand (premature-
incubation having started a week before) and only then did the grebes
start to gather weed and place it about the egg. The birds were robbed
by some unknown predator (probably louts) and deserted the site.
The year previous, at the old Theale gravel-pits (Berkshire), a pair of
grebes successfully reared three young from a clutch of eggs laid on
bare gravel on an islet. Again only a very small amount of weed
was present. A similar record of a very scanty nest on an islet comes
from W ilstone Reservoir (Report on Birds observed in Hertfordshire
in 1946). This, together with the others, seems to suggest that, where

these substitute-sites are sufficiently raised to form a pre-existing,
artificial platform, the birds do not build there, but are " content 55
to leave out the nest-building stage of their cycle prior to egg-laying,
if highly worked-up sexually.
The Nest-platform
Selous and Huxley drew a sharp distinction between the casually
built 44 pairing platform " (used more or less exclusively for soliciting
and copulation) and the 44 true nest " (used eventually for breeding).
Such a distinction, though useful, does not always exist. Some pairs
only build one structure which serves all purposes. Others may
construct as many as three and then employ any one of them to hold
the eggs. As Hartley (1937) says of the Dabchick : 44 That there is no
initial psychological difference between the true nest and the small
weed-platform is suggested by the fact that the 4 invitation pose ' and
copulation take place on both." Huxley himself states that 44 the birds
may build several incomplete nests or platforms before one finally
chosen to be the true nest is finished and laid in ". It all amounts
to the fact that a 44 pairing platform " is a potential nest that for
some reason has not been used eventually. At times the birds have
obviously not been selective enough in their first building spells and
have chosen an imperfect site which is suitable for mating, but not for
breeding. Such is the case with the occasional 44 free-floating "
platforms.
In this paper I have used the names 44 nest ", 44 platform ", and
44 nest-platform " rather indiscriminately, though tending to use the
first to denote a true nest. Of the three, 44 nest-platform " is the most
useful as a general term.
The Nest Site
Grebes build in a variety of places but 44 in general nests are placed
in sedges and reeds at the water's edge " ( The Great Crested Grebe
Inquiry , 1931). Most of the nests that I have found in Berkshire,
Hertfordshire, and Wiltshire have been tethered to waterside vegeta-
tion of some sort ( Phragmites , Typha , Persicaria , Salix, etc.), with at
least part of the structure awash, for the grebe likes to swim right up to
the base of its nest. The nest is often hidden in cover, more near the
open water than the bank if possible, but exposed ones are by no
means rare, some being supported by underwater vegetation or
built up from the bottom in very shallow water and so on. One very
memorable nest, found at Braydon Pond (Wiltshire) in 1944, was
partly fixed to a slim wooden stake and partly floating in a depth of
well over 5 feet. To reach it, I waded until the water was up to my
chin. At Burghfield, flooded willow clumps and trailing willow
branches are much favoured.

Grebes nests are liable to suffer from the opposite dangers of
flooding and stranding, but the birds do not readily desert in such
circumstances, flooding is most likely to be disastrous for the eggs
when the water level rises during rough weather, especially in the
laying period and early days of incubation when some nests tend to
be less raised above the surface than later. Like other aquatic species,
grebes build up the nest when their sitting routine has been upset by
water splashing up over the rim : they get 44 restless ", rearrange
material, and get down from the nest to add fresh cargoes of weed.
Locally, most grebes nests are situated not far from relatively deep
water, so that when stranded after spells of drought they are seldom
left so completely high and dry that the birds cannot manage to
clamber clumsily up to take turn on the eggs.
Selecting the Site
The male and female often investigate possible sites together,
swimming purposively from place to place, perhaps one bird leading
the way. Sometimes each goes its own way for a while and the female
is likely to advertise for her mate when separated from him. As
already stated on page 1345 the 44 choice " of a site 44 involves entering
likely cover, commencing to build there, and displaying, resting, and
preening in the immediate vicinity ". Either sex may initially
prospect a particular site but the presence and activity of both grebes
there ensures its final adoption. Once the pair has settled down in
the territory further platforms may appear, again usually the result
of joint participation of the two sexes. Sometimes the male, and
apparently only he, may start a platform on his own in addition (as
Selous also found). I am certain, however, that these so-called
" coc k platforms " are never entirely the sole affair of the male for
long, the female collaborating with him if he persists in building there,
and have no deep significance as indicated by Huxley -- 44 The
mysterious platforms of the cock remain as one of the few truly
secondary sexual characters of the species." Rather, multiple nest-
building of this sort is merely the result of the male's apparently
greater urge to build than his mate's, a difference of degree not of kind.
The nest-platform that will finally contain the eggs is that one which,
while not necessarily the last to be made, is the last to have joint
construction done at it by male and female before the onset of ovulation.
Building
Great Crested Grebes are efficient if not very elaborate nest-builders.
Their general scheme of construction, in spells of persistent building,
is to bring as much material as possible in a short time and to pile it
up for later arrangement. This results in the speedy appearance of a

platform for sexual purposes. Both sexes work hard, the male seeming,
in my experience, to take the larger overall share as is implied also by
the Grebe Inquiry. Reporting on Selous's observations, Huxley says
on this point : " As to the part played in nest-building by cock and
hen respectively, Selous says in regard to this pair : ' The interest
taken by the male in the nest has been very marked throughout, more
so even--in appearance, at any rate--than that of the female, though
in the actual building of it she has been yet more efficient than he.' "
Hanzak, however, states that the female does most of the work at
nest-platforms in cover and the male most on the free-floating ones,
which are never used as true nests. None of these totally untethered
nest-platforms have ever been made at Burghfield though the Grebe
Inquiry mentions that " At Stoke Newington Reservoir (Middlesex)
a nest was to be seen gently wandering all round the reservoir in 1929 ".
There are five main activities in nest-building : the collecting,
transporting, depositing, arranging, and trampling down of material.
Many nests are made predominantly of sodden and decayed sunken
weed, the same " dark ribbony " stuff used in the weed-trick display.
Fresher green leaves and stalks of aquatic plants are also employed,
and small dead waterlogged branches of up to about two feet in length
are chiefly, but not entirely, found in the base of the platform below
water. If the predominant material is anything else besides sodden
weed the nest still depends on that to bind the rest together. This
weed and many of the other items are obtained from below the surface
by diving, but some stuff, especially growing water-plants, is broken
off from the parent source if not too securely attached. One male grebe
was seen to pull grass from the bank and take that to the nest. Material
is collected as near to the site as possible, often mainly from within a
few feet of it. Some birds have to travel and bring it from as much as
50 yards or more away ; this is unusual unless the immediate nest area
is devoid of any suitable material. Only single branches are carried
at a time, held by the end and trailed, floating, behind the grebe as it
swims back to the platform. On the other hand, large cargoes of
decayed weed, so thick that the bill shape is obscured, may be brought
at once. After the initial foraging dives, the birds always journey
across the surface on their way to deposit the material, never diving
along en route as they may when bringing food for the young. Selous
recorded 74 visits in 40 minutes from the pair he watched in 1900,
the female then continuing a little on her own while the male, soon
after, took 28 loads of stuff to his " own " platform. Next day the two
birds brought 100 cargoes in 50 minutes. In my experience, at peaks
of building activity, a visiting rate of one load a minute by each grebe
may be maintained for some time. The birds are able to make this
speed because their building method is simple and rapid, as mentioned
above.

A large cargo of weed.
Depositing a load of weed.
When the grebe reaches the site, it immediately deposits its load
from the water, usually on to the slope of the platform. If very active
in collecting, it will then move quickly away to forage anew. There is
a special " pushing " movement used in laying down damp weed--
a slight, upward, shovelling quiver of the bill (rather like that of a dog
covering a bone with earth). This is analogous with the side-to-side

fixing movements of many other groups that build mainly with more
rigid materials, needing to be woven if fine (e.g. many small passerine
birds), or at least interlocked if coarser (e.g. doves, lovebirds, hawks).
Sometimes one of the pair will ascend the platform especially to
arrange the material there. However, this is usually done during
breaks in soliciting or during spells of premature-incubation, and
so on. Standing or sitting, the grebe picks up a piece of weed from

here and lays it there. It is in this way, mainly, that the structure
grows from a rather shapeless pile of weed into a more functional
nest, with a central depression for the eggs. This last is formed by the
bird piling up weed round itself as it sits. The platform is given
solidarity chiefly by the incidental movements of the heavy-tooted
birds but occasionally, before any eggs are present, deliberate trampling
is done with the large lobed toes. Huxley mentions this rather
graphically : " Lying in a punt in the reeds, I have heard this
trampling, first on one side, then on the other--squelch, squelch,
squelch--sounds of some creature trampling heavily with alternate
feet on something sodden."

one of the grebe couple is really sexually inclined, the birds begin
to solicit on it. Both sexes " invite " and " rear " (see below), at first

those pairs that start their cycle in the winter, the first copulations
may occur months before egg-laying, though in more normal spring
cycles it begins 1-2 weeks before. In at least the vast majority of
cases it is the male that actually mounts, but there is some evidence

that the female may occasionally do so also (see below), and she
certainly quite regularly shows the intention of it. Thus, as we cannot
speak of an essentially " male role " or of an essentially " female
role " in describing the fundamental sexual behaviour of the Great
Crested Grebe, it is convenient to have two neutral designations for
the bird displaying on the platform and for the bird in the water.
Huxley (and also Hartley) used " passive " and " active " respectively
but, as the soliciting Great Crested is often far from merely passive,
I have therefore modified this to " soliciting " and " active ". In the
descriptions given below, it should be remembered that the soliciting
bird may be either male or female as may the " active " one in all
stages of reaction up to actual mounting, when only the male absolutely
certainly is involved.
Soliciting
Soliciting does not depend on any fixed ritual or set of circumstances
for its elicitation, the presence of the mate in the immediate neighbour-
hood of the nest-platform being the major stimulus. The behaviour
often follows a joint swim to the weed pile, occasionally after one or
both birds have " invited " in the water, or more usually after a Head-
shaking Ceremony. Frequently, too, one of the pair may ascend the
platform to display during a spell of building or get up for some other
purpose and then solicit when the partner comes near. If the birds
have more than a single platform they may solicit on any one though
usually showing a preference, if only a temporary one, for a particular
structure.
There are two soliciting-displays. The first to appear during the
progress of the reproductive-cycle is what may formally be termed
the " invitation-display ", a posture that Huxley called the " passive
pairing attitude " to distinguish it from the " active pairing attitude "
or mounting. While a grebe may rarely " invite " in the water near
the nest-platform, sometimes with its head resting on the base, usually
it gets up on top of the weed pile to display. It jumps awkwardly up,
perhaps fiddles with material there, and then sits down. When
" inviting " at full intensity, the grebe stretches its neck well forward,
with the head ornaments depressed, and remains inactive. On a low-
lying platform, and in the water, the neck may normally be more or
less flush with the surface, but on well built-up structures, it inclines
downwards along the line of the slope. When the " inviting " bird is
not fully worked up, or when the " active " one is unresponsive or not
really near the platform, it raises its head a little with the neck curved.
If the " active " grebe should then approach the soliciting one, the
latter often then reassumes the more intense version of its invitation-
display.
Early on in the cycle bouts of soliciting may consist only of weak

" inviting ", but later this display increases in intensity and frequency.
In addition a more complex activity appears, the grotesque " rearing-
display The history of this " rearing " in the literature is very
puzzling. Few British ornithologists seem to have seen it, both Selous

and Huxley recording it only briefly and neither discuss its significance.
Yet on the very first day that I watched grebes at the platform, I saw
the display several times and subsequently found that it occurred
regularly. Two other grebe enthusiasts, G. E. Douglas and Miss L.
McCartan, have also often observed it, and Hanzak implies that he
has too, though he wrongly states it to be a " special epigamous
position " of the female only.
Huxley's account of " rearing " in his 1914 paper goes as follows
(he himself not having yet seen it). " To complete the description of
the mere attitudes, it remains to add that, before sinking down into the
passive pairing attitude ... the birds usually assume a curious fixed
and rigid pose. I will quote Selous's words : '. . . curling his neck over
and down, with the bill pointing at the ground [weeds], perhaps six
inches above it, he stood thus, fixed and rigid, for some moments
(as though making a point) before sinking down and lying all along.
There was no mistaking the entirely sexual character of this strange
performance, the peculiar fixed rigidity full of import and expression.' "
Later, in his 1924 paper, Huxley gives a second record. " Then the
hen got out on to the nest and assumed a remarkable attitude, the
body slightly inclined forward, the neck, with a slight curve in it,
sloped downwards at an angle of about 30*. There was a curious
rigid look about the bird, which was accentuated by the fact of her
remaining motionless in this position for several seconds. She then
sank down on to the nest . . . The male approached, but soon departed
again. The female then raised herself into the same rigid standing
position for some seconds, and a second time sank down from this into
the coition-attitude." Hanzak, in his turn, reports as follows : " At
the time of copulation the grebes use a special position, taken up
only by the female sitting in the nest ; ^ i n the presence of a
swimming round stands upright in the nest and bends its neck so that
it lays its head on its underside. The beak nearly touches the nest."
The only other record that I can trace of the rearing-display comes
from the 1931 Grebe Inquiry. " On 18th March, 1922, a pair on a

overlooked, The Handbook of British Birds not even mentioning it for
the Great Crested or for any other species of grebe. Hanzak states that
the Black-necked Grebe has a similar display as also, apparently, has
the Slavonian Grebe, judging from the photograph in Hosking and
Newberry's More Birds of the Day. On the other hand, Hartley did
not observe it from his Dabchicks.
All the descriptions cited above are incomplete and deal only with
the less intense form of the rearing-display. The full range of the
performance is as follows. The soliciting grebe gets up on to its
platform and usually " invites " first of all, though it may sometimes
do the rearing-display immediately instead. In any case, in the
majority of cases the bird suddenly rears up from the horizontal
" inviting " position so that its body stands almost vertical. At the
same time it quivers its closed wings in short spasms (a movement of
the primaries outwards), flashing the white areas which are otherwise
hidden. For a moment the neck curls up with upheaval of the body,
but then it is arched downwards sharply in a grotesquely rigid manner
at an angle of about 45 degrees to the body. The head with tippets
well spread is tucked under with the bill pointing just in front of the
feet, a few inches above the level of the platform. The grebe remains
thus briefly and may then relax a little, this being the less intense
moment of the display recorded by Selous, Huxley, and the others.
Afterwards the birds subside into the " inviting " position, to " rear "
again later, or first of all picks up and drops weed or preens its under-
side before so doing. Occasionally it performs a second rearing-
display without first unfolding into the less intense soliciting attitude.
Well developed bouts of soliciting consist of " inviting " interspersed
with " rearing ", the latter behaviour being particularly prone to
occur if the " active " bird is slow to respond. However, even during
the period of regular coition some sequences are made up entirely
of the inviting-display. During the decline in sexual activity (when
premature-incubation is in progress before egg-laying), the rearing-
display becomes infrequent again as it was before full soliciting
commenced.
Behaviour of the " Active " Bird
The response of the " active " bird in the water near to its soliciting
mate varies considerably, ranging from apparent indifference to the
full act of mounting. It may not approach the platform at all but drift
away from it, preening and so on. On the other hand, it may go off to
forage for nest-material, bringing weed and adding it to the platform,
or remain at the structure and fiddle about with stuff at its base.
In all these cases, the grebe's sexual feeling is just not strong enough,
or uninhibited enough, for it to mount and copulate. When the
tendency for the latter increases the " active " bird may start to

headshake spasmodically at its mate, sometimes habit-preening as well.
T e soliciting grebe may finally respond to this and a joint ceremony
results as previously described on page 188. If so, the soliciting
bout often ends soon after with copulation unachieved.
Sometimes the " active " bird will mount soon after its mate starts
to display^on the nest-platform; at others repeated alternations of

making aiming movements of the head as if about to jump up, only to
move away backwards again. While all this is going on, the bird's
tippets are usually depressed rather furtively but the crest is well
raised--a combination which gives it a rather surprised look. The

increasingly more confident " until finally, with tippets now markedly
spread out laterally, it mounts. As this is predominantly, if not
entirely a male activity, I shall refer to the " active " bird as a male
from this point. He leaps out of the water on to the female s back
with his closed wings quivering, as in the rearing-display, and uttering
a loud and harsh rattle, described by Hanzak as characteristically
throaty and " sounding like a creaking ee eee ". Standing there, with
body almost upright, neck arched forward with the tippets fully
spread and crest raised, he copulates for up to approximately 6 seconds
or so only, the rattling call, meanwhile, changing to the more common
ticking one. Then he waddles along the female s back, and over her
head, to land upright in the water with much splashing of water as he
remains where he alights, making paddling movements of the feet
to keep him up. From the vertical position with rear-end submerged,
he soon subsides into a normal floating one and begins to head-shake,
at times quite intensely, with his back to the female. She, meanwhile,
after remaining in the full 44 inviting " posture during coition, has
raised her head and, when her mate begins to head-shake, joins in.
This joint, post-copulatory, head-shaking ceremony is a regular
feature. It soon dies down and the male, gradually relaxing his
position, swims slowly away, perhaps preening. The female may also
preen spasmodically before getting off the platform or resettling to sit.
Selous and Huxley give little details about actual coition itself
and do not mention the activities that follow. Hanzak does record
that an 44 incomplete courting " once came after copulation but
implies that this is unusual. Also, while doubting, correctly, that the

sex-act (as maintained by Stanek and Hesse), he wrongly figures the
male more or less lying along the female's back when mounted.
It is of incidental interest to record that the bird which mated on
the sand in 1949 (see above), landed on firm ground after coition and
performed there quite typically before waddling back to the water.

The Evidence for Reversed Mounting
In 1901 Selous saw the smaller of the pair of grebes he was watching,
and therefore the presumed female, twice mount its larger mate. He
did not witness the converse of this, and one would have expected him
to do so if the larger grebe was behaving anything like a typical male.
However, I agree with Huxley that there is little likelihood of the
smaller bird being anything else but a female. Since Selous's time,
our knowledge on this point has hardly progressed at all and we are
in urgent need of really definite cases of reversed copulation in this
species. I can find no certain record in my own notes of a female
Great Crested Grebe mounting a soliciting male, though I have a
vague memory of seeing this in 1948 when under the impression
(falsely given to me from several standard works) that such behaviour
was regular. Likewise, Hanzak states that he has " not been able to
observe in the grebes the two-sided pairing which often occurs in
species with a small sex dimorphism and mentioned also in connection
with the Great Crested Grebe (Niethammer, 1942) While, therefore,

the evidence for reversed copulation is slight, I do feel that it is
in fact very likely to occur occasionally, judging from my own
observations on females showing the intention to mount and also from
an assessment of the " bi-sexual " nature of most of the grebe's
behaviour patterns.

While presenting several problems of its own, the platform-behaviour
of the Great Crested Grebe is much easier to understand than the
courtship activities, and a few points will now be dealt with very
briefly.
First of all, the derivation of the soliciting-displays. On grebe
standards, the invitation-display is a relatively simple one in which the
body position best suited for effective mating has been exaggerated
by the extension of the neck, a movement seemingly of no utilitarian
value so far as mounting is concerned. The probable original form
of this posture is shown by the Dabchick which does not stretch its
head forward when adopting its " invitation pose " (Hartley). In
contrast, the rearing-display is much more complicated. There are
two main components. The initial erection of the body with wings
quivering closely resembles the behaviour of the male immediately
on mounting the female. I would hazard the suggestion that, in actual
fact, this has its origin in mounting behaviour. The second part of the
display, the downward extension of the neck, may possibly be founded
on movements directed at the nest for some purpose. Hanzak points
out that " This is very reminiscent of the position in which the grebe
arranges the eggs under itself", and the similarity is stressed by the
angle of the bird's head. However it must be pointed out that, after
the main " rearing " action, the soliciting grebe may sometimes toy
with weed on the platform or preen its underside, so the neck move-
ment of the display is perhaps equally likely to be based on initial
nest-arranging or preening behaviour. More study is needed.
The chief internal drive which causes a grebe to ascend its nest-
platform and solicit is quite clearly a sexual one, using the term
" sexual " in a strict sense, that of " desire to copulate Investiga-
tions so far give little evidence that other impulses play an important
role (as they do in courtship), though possibly a weak escape tendency
is there because the " inviting " bird does depress its tippets and crest.
When " rearing " the grebe is obviously in a more intense sexual
mood than when merely " inviting "--many things point to this
conclusion, not least of all the fact that the rearing-display is probably
partly derived from actual copulating movements.
The " bi-sexual " nature of the Great Crested Grebe's sexual
behaviour may perhaps be best appreciated if we consider the sequence
" inviting -* rearing --\0x25BA mounting " as one in which the sexual

25 1
tendency is increasing in strength throughout, as all the evidence
suggests. Only the male regularly reaches the full limit of sexual feeling
and it is he, therefore, that usually performs the active role in coition
and not his mate. 1 he female, being at a relatively lower sexual pitch,
regularly only reaches a state of showing intention to mount, but
occasionally, when her feelings are exceptionally strong for one of her
sex, she too may actually mount in all probability. In normal copula-
tions the initiative is taken by the female. The " bi-sexual " arrange-
ment is of special value to the male, therefore, because, apart from
being able to express himself at times of relatively low sexual feeling,
he can also, if highly worked up, solicit when the female does not
take the initiative. The result is an overall increase in sexual efficiency.
Huxley has discussed this subject from a mainly different angle and
his argument is worth repeating here. Because of the need for a firm
support in copulating, the female grebe had to take the initiative by
assuming the invitation-display. Unlike the males of many other
species, the male grebe, therefore, had no means of expressing his
desire to mate. Hence, " the pairing attitude of the female was
transferred to the male to give him, too, a means of expressing his
readiness to pair--to enable him, should he wish it, as well as the
hen, to take the first step towards the performance of the act of copula-
tion by the pair." In addition this process of " reversal of the sexes "
went further and the female came to possess the mounting behaviour
of the male.
The soliciting-displays act as general sexual stimulants to both
sexes, much more so than courtship, the function of which lies mainly
elsewhere. " Inviting " is something more than a passive position for
mating. Together with " rearing " it is also a display in the strict
sense of the word, that is a signal-movement functioning to stimulate
sexual responses in the mate. Female soliciting helps to release
mounting in the male. Male soliciting, while only infrequently (if
at all) releasing actual mounting on the part of the female, does at
times raise her to such a pitch that she shows a desire to do so.
Copulation in grebes always has the appearance of efficiency and
success. There is none of the half-hearted standing on the female's
back on the part of the male, or any breaking away before consumma-
tion on the part of the female, that one finds with many other birds.
The reasons for this are : that the female must be sufficiently intense
in the first place to get up on the platform at all ; that the male will
not mount unless she is soliciting, and that he will not do so in any case
unless he himself is at a very high sexual pitch. I believe, partly from
observation, partly from an intuitive feeling, that the " active " grebe
understandably " dislikes " jumping up out of the water. His hesita-
tion, and the depressed, furtive tippets, suggest some fear. When this
is suppressed by his over-riding sexual urge, and only then, the male

252 K. E. L. SIMMONS--STUDIES ON GREAT CRESTED GREBES
will mount. All this results in his being really purposive when he does
finally copulate and makes for successful mating.
Actual copulation in the Great Crested Grebe lasts for quite a short
time, some six seconds or so. This supports my contention that the
male is very ardent indeed when he mounts, and also that grebes find
it physically easy to mate quickly. There is much variation in the
time birds take to copulate and many factors which determine this.
In Blackbirds ( Turdus merula ), for example, Dr. D. W. Snow tells me
that it takes " less than a few seconds ", apparently because other
males are liable to interfere. No such interference, or the possibility
for it, has been seen in grebes. On the other hand, Masked and Peach-
faced Lovebirds ( Agapornis personata and roseicollis ) in my aviaries
copulate for up to four minutes. There is no interference with mating
in these species and the males are able to work up to full intensity
during the sex-act itself.
Reversed mounting occurs in several species, notably pigeons. In
discussions of this phenomenon in the literature (for example, that of
Huxley himself and of E. A. Armstrong, in Bird Display and Behaviour),
it is assumed that such behaviour occurs regularly in the grebe and
that it is strictly comparable with the reversed mounting of the other
birds. Assuming for the moment that the female grebe does occasion-
ally mount the male, as I firmly believe she does, this activity comes
after a soliciting spell by the male and not after a mounting attempt
by him. The latter is the usual procedure in pigeons and other species,
as, I believe, my friend Derek Goodwin pointed out to me. Only
recently, after I started to type this discussion in fact, I saw such a
case in my aviary. A female Blue-winged Parrotlet ( Forpus passerinus
vividus) left her nest and joined the male. He attempted his usual
one-footed mounting with swaying head and body but, as I carefully
noted, his tail did not bend sufficiently under the female's, and he
soon stopped. The female immediately sidled up to him and in turn
placed her foot on his back and drew her body close. Afterwards they
both did the " screwing ", side-to-side regurgitating movement which
normally the male only does. In all species, grebes, pigeons, parrotlets,
etc., this " male " mounting behaviour on the part of the female is
due to a very intense sexual urge that is greater than that normally
experienced by the sex, and is often also the result of inadequate sexual
response of the part of the male.
After dismounting the male grebe usually initiates a post-copulatory
Head-shaking Ceremony. This is caused, I think, firstly by a slight
surplus of sexual feeling left over after the speedy copulation, and then
by escape and aggressive tendencies aroused by close bodily contact
with his mate, a situation known in other species to produce such a
set-up. The escape urge is indicated by his upright stance in the
water which is similar to the " escape-bathing " one. In several

stages of fighting. To give one example, already reported in the

displacement-feed and preen during tiffs with rivals and after copula-
tion when the mated hirds also run away from each other.
Finally, a brief word on the relationship between nest-building and
sexual behaviour which will be developed more fully elsewhere.
Initially, the nest-platform is built up until solid enough to hold a
soliciting grebe and then building behaviour declines as soliciting
intensifies. If, however, an already raised substitute-site is employed
there may be no nest-building during the period of marked sexual
activity. Often grebes forage and bring material when their other
behaviour shows that their desire to solicit, etc., is weak, and nest-
building intensifies once again after the copulatory stage has started to
decline. All this suggests that nest-building urges are subordinate to
and depend on the sex-drive for their intensity.

By W. G. Teagle (Ministry of Works, England)
The news that a pair of pinioned Pink-footed Geese had nested in
Kensington Gardens in 1954, and had managed to rear a gosling, was
greeted with surprise, for Pinkfeet do not nest very readily in captivity.
Now, in 1955, the same pair has nested again and has produced a
brood of three.
The parents are two of a flock originally obtained from Peter Scott,
who in 1947 presented the Ministry with eight Pinkfeet for the
St. James's Park wildfowl collection. Another twelve were received
from Mr. Scott in April, 1948, and were released on the Long Water
in Kensington Gardens.
On 29th May of the same year Tom Hinton, then Bird-keeper for
the Central Royal Parks, discovered that all but two of the St. James's
Park birds were missing. Visiting Hyde Park three days later, how-
ever, he was amazed to find them on the Serpentine, where they had
oined the flock of twelve. Since they were pinioned birds one can
Dnly conclude that they had walked all the way via the Green Park
md Hyde Park Corner--a distance of about three-quarters of a mile,
rhe migration could hardly have taken place in daylight, and one is
erupted to visualize the scene as the birds filed past the Duke of
Wellington s statue in the small hours, to the bewilderment of any
locturnal revellers who happened to be abroad !
During the early years of its stay on the Serpentine a few members
&amp;gt;f the flock were lost, but thirteen birds managed to accept the dogs.

the swimmers, and the rowing boats with which they had to share the
water and to tolerate the smaller craft on the Round Pond. There
may have been nesting attempts before 1954--breeding behaviour
was noted in 1952 by the two Official Bird Observers for Hyde Park
and Kensington Gardens, Charles Parsons and Christopher Hawes--
but it was on 19th July, 1954, that the appearance of a small downy
gosling proved that nesting had actually taken place. The young bird
was closely guarded by its parents and for some time the trio usually
kept a little apart from the main flock. The young bird survived
the unpleasant summer and is still with the flock, although left
unpinioned.
During the spring of 1955 the Official Observers could only account
for ten of the fourteen geese, and hopes that this time two pairs were
nesting in one of the enclosures began to rise. It was quite late in
June, however, that reports reached me via the Park-keepers that
Pinkfeet had in fact bred again, but apparently only one pair of them
did so. Three goslings, all belonging to the birds which bred in 1954,
were about a month old when they were seen by the Official Observers
on 28th June. The accompanying photograph was taken on 20th July,
by which time the goslings were almost as large as the adults. The
bird reared in 1954, recognizable because of its unpinioned wings,
was keeping company with the family.
The three new goslings bring the total number of Pinkfeet in Hyde
Park and Kensington Gardens up to seventeen, and one may hope
that a further increase can be expected next year. Meanwhile, there
remain two birds in St. James's Park, the two that stayed at home in
1948 while the others went walking.

The second of the joint London Zoo and B.B.C. expeditions set out
during March, this time to British Guiana, where films were taken
for showing on television and specimens of the fauna were collected.
As before, Mr. J. W. Lester led the expedition and he was accom-
panied by Mr. H. Vinall, the Overseer of Ungulates. Mr. David
Attenborough and Mr. Charles Lagus of the B.B.G., who returned
by air at the end of June, made up the party.
It was hoped to bring back the animals during June, but owing to
shipping delays it was not until 8th August that the collection was
landed in Liverpool. Unfortunately Mr. Lester became ill and had
to return to London by air. I went to Georgetown to help to bring
back the collection and a list of the birds is appended to these notes.

A stay of only two weeks in Georgetown scarcely qualifies one to
write of the bird-life of that crowded city, particularly when much
ol the time is taken up with the care of the collected specimens and
making arrangements for bringing them back. The collection was
kept in an outhouse at the residence of the Director of Agriculture
in the lovely Botanical Gardens and hereabouts there were more
birds than in any other part of Georgetown. No visitor to British
Guiana could fail to notice the Sulphury Tyrant, as it is called here,
but it is known there as the Kiskadee, or Kiskadee Flycatcher, a name
said to be a corruption of " Qu'est ce qu'il dit ? " and undoubtedly
derived from the bird's call. Like the night-long chorus of frog and
toad calls, the cry of the Kiskadee threatens at first to get on one's
nerves and then, after a day or two, one becomes accustomed to it
and no longer consciously hears it. This bird is certainly a tyrant,
but hardly a fly-catcher ; one of the main foods seemed to be grass-
hoppers and it is said to eat nestlings of other birds. Two came
regularly to eat food put out for cats at the nearby house and they
were especially fond of any boiled rice that might have been thrown
out. I once saw one on the rafters of the abbatoir, eyeing the bloody
scenes below, but whether it was a regular visitor in search of food or
whether it just wandered in there, I do not know.
Once or twice we caught sight of a grey-headed bird that looked
to be a near relative of the Kiskadee, but I have not discovered what
it was. There was one of the small Tody-Tyrants about in the trees ;
it seemed to feed on caterpillars that it snatched from the leaves.
Sometimes a Humming Bird would come to the flowers of hibiscus
bushes that formed hedges round about the outhouse, staying for no
more than a second or so at each flower. Once, while we were working
among the animals, one came and sat for quite half a minute on an
overhead wire, putting its head on one side and intently studying the
strange happenings beneath, and one afternoon in a very poor part
of the town, where the houses were no more than wooden shacks
crowded together, I saw one come to feed on the flowers of some
stunted zinnias in a tiny garden. It was strange to see so exquisite
a bird amid such squalor. The only Humming Birds that I saw in
Georgetown were the White-bellied and Lesson's Emerald. There
may, of course, be others at other times of the year. Quelch writes
of the Cayenne Hermit, Longuemare's Hermit, the Broad-shafted
Sabre-wing, the Violet-tailed and Green-throated Mango, Black-
eared Fairy, and others as being seen in Georgetown, some of them
" quite common ", but that was long ago. The American Egret,
Snowy Egrets, Little Blue Herons, and the Buff-backed were quite
common. The last is a self-introduced bird and seems now to be
well established. An island in the Botanical Gardens is a favourite
nesting place for the Egrets and Herons.

256 J. J. YEALLAND-LONDON ZOO NOTES
Small numbers of the Common Ani or Old Witch were sometimes
about the Gardens and Black Vultures occasionally passed over. The
Everglade Kite is common ; this bird lives largely, if not entirely,
on the large marsh snails. In the swampy fields outside the town
I saw one of these Kites swoop down and pick up a snail in its talons.
These birds must possess remarkably keen sight to see the snails from
a height.
A pair of Talpacoti Doves came regularly to the gravel drive and
occasionally there were one or two of what I feel sure were the Thick-
billed Seed-finches. A pair of Blue Tanagers had a nest, evidently
containing young, quite high up in a tree : it was pointed out to me
by a gardener who was engaged in what can only be described as
weeding the trees with a long-handled hook. There are epiphytic
plants with leaves like those of a pineapple which grow very commonly
on the bushes and trees and the gardeners spend a lot of time in
hooking them off--in fact they could be said to weed the trees more
often than they weed the gardens.
On some of the trees there were great clusters of a narrow-leaved
mistletoe : I only saw this on trees that were overhanging water and
the berries were a favourite food of some of the birds.
There is a small zoo in the Gardens where, except for some Peafowl,
indigenous specimens are shown. There is no bird market, but one
sometimes sees a bird-fancier in the streets carrying a pet bird in a
small cage--generally, I think, a Little Yellow Finch, or Little Saffron
Finch (Sicalis minor ), and a few people keep an Orange-winged
Amazon, locally and appropriately known as the Screecher. There
are one or two bird-catchers, but I believe they do not normally catch
anything but small seed-eaters.
The protection laws prohibit the export of birds and their plumage
except by an Order in Council, but there seems to be no prohibition
of bird-catching.
Two days before he started back I went with Lester to the Rose
Hall sugar estate on the southern side of the Berbice River, where
Hoatzins are common. There is first a drive of about three hours
over a rough road to Rossignol, thence by ferry across the muddy
river to New Amsterdam and then a short drive to the vast sugar
estate. The country is flat and marshy where a certain amount of
rice growing is done. It was interesting to see Surinam Jacanas
walking about in the fields, the yellow on the underside of their
wings being very conspicuous in flight. Here, too, were some of the
Cayenne Red-breasted Marsh-birds, locally known as Robins, and
some Yellow-headed Marsh-birds, while the Black Vultures, Ever-
glade Kites, and Egrets were quite common. A striking black and
white bird was seen, always singly, here and there along the road
and always near water. It was the White-shouldered Water Tyrant

or Cotton-bird. It was, perhaps, the contrast with the black of the
plumage that made the white appear of a remarkably glistening
quality. This is one of the many birds observed by J. J. Quelch in
Georgetown, and he writes of it : "A very small Tyrant, about
4~5 inches in length, known as Cotton-bird (Fluvicola pica ) is also
usually to be found about the grassy parts of the town, and more
especially by the trenches of the outskirts among grassy and bushy
wastes."
Quelch s observations were made some sixty years ago when, no
doubt, Georgetown was a very different place--at any rate, it was
several miles from the town that I saw the first of these W ater Tyrants.
The nest is said by Schomburgk to be composed chiefly of plant
cotton, so that accounts for the local name. At one place along the
road in a grove of coco-nut palms there were a number of nests hanging
from the tips of the palm fronds, but there was no sign of occupants.
Over the river were two or three Black-tailed Skimmers, but the
water was muddy and swiftly flowing, so evidently did not suit other
birds, for there were none but the Skimmers to be seen.
On arrival at the sugar estate, we found that some Hoatzins had
already been caught for us ,* we had planned to return by a ferry early
in the evening, but as the main object of our visit had been achieved
before we arrived, we decided to return by the first available ferry.
This just allowed time for me to go to see the Hoatzins in their natural
haunts on the outskirts of the plantation. The tangled bushes where
these strange birds live were separated from the track by a wide
ditch of muddy water, the abode of numerous crocodiles. As it was
around midday, all was quiet, for by all accounts the Hoatzins are
active early and late in the day and sleep in the shade of the bushes
during the hottest time. At a chosen spot my companion stopped the
truck and clapped his hands, whereupon a chorus of querulous squawks
came from the bushes and four or five Hoatzins scrambled into view.
They did not attempt to fly, but made their way in an awkward
fashion about the bushes and slowly disappeared. A little further on
we saw a nest in a very open, exposed position with a Hoatzin sitting
on it. These bushes were growing in water and mud, so the birds
were well protected except, perhaps, from birds of prey. One gets the
impression that Beebe (Our Search for a Wilderness ) is correct when he
writes : " Inexplicable though it may appear, the Hoatzin--though
evidently unchanged in many respects through long epochs--yet
is far from being perfectly adapted to its present environment. It has
a severe struggle for existence, and the least increase of any foe or
obstacle would result in its extinction."
The flight is very weak and the plumage appears too permeable
to withstand the heavy rains that sometimes fall in that area, but no
doubt the large leaves of Caladium arborescens, one of the Hoatzins'

food plants, provide shelter. Another food plant is the Pimpler thorn
(.Drepanocarpus lunatus), about which the birds would need to climb
with care to avoid injury, for the branches are covered with long
sharp thorns. Fruits are said to be eaten too, but it seems doubtful
whether these would be available throughout the year. The Mucka-
mucka, as the Caladium is locally called, was in bud during July ;
this plant looked to be related to the well-known Phyllodendron and had
the same climbing habit. It was common among bushes growing
near water and, except for the youngest growth, the leaves were
tough and bitter.
We gave two of the newly-caught Hoatzins to the zoo and another
with an eye injury was released in a big clump of bushes interspersed
with the Caladium growing on the banks of one of the lakes in the
Gardens. Lester brought back one established bird that he had
collected three or four weeks before and one that was newly caught.
The latter did not live long after arrival here, but the established
one is doing well--we hope--at the Bird House. It is always difficult
to judge whether Hoatzins are thriving and one can only go by the
amount of food they eat. I started back with two, but one died after
three days and the other after seven days, so I feel sure that it is very
important to get these birds well established before the journey.
Two or three days before starting back, I was brought a newly-
caught Black-capped Mocking-thrush and, unlike the Hoatzins, this
interesting bird took readily to captivity, was quite fearless from the
first, and ate mealworms at once. During the voyage I could not
induce it to eat any of the insectile food ; I mixed chopped mealworms
and grated hard-boiled egg with the food, but the Mocking-thrush
carefully picked out the fragments of mealworm and left the rest.
Now, in the Bird House, its diet is supplemented with moths, gentles,
and locusts, but it is still unwilling to touch the inanimate food.
A curious feature of this bird is a small patch of bright yellow skin on
either side of the throat.
Beebe refers to the calls of these Mocking-thrushes, describing how
a pair sat together uttering a rapid call " hour after hour " to be
answered by another pair in a neighbouring bush : "At each enuncia-
tion the half-spread tails of the respective pair of birds wagged violently
from side to side as if pulled with a string. As the utterances of each
of the two birds were synchronous, the wagging was always in perfect
time . . . These active interesting birds have in addition an elaborate
song uttered singly ..."
There are two species only in this genus, the other being D. albo-
vittatus of Bolivia.
The Rails and their relatives, in spite of their extreme nervousness,
seem generally to take well to captivity, provided, of course, that part
of the cage is covered so that they have somewhere to hide. I was

brought a small Rail or Crake only a few days before leaving and it
very quickly took to eating the insectile food with a few mealworms
mixed in. It seems to be an immature bird and is not yet identified.
Now, at the Bird House, it is already much steadier and often comes
out from its brushwood covered corner during the day. The Glossy
Cowbird is common in British Guiana and a pair of these already
at the Bird House were brought by Mr. Durrell in 1950, when they
were received as Silky Cowbirds or Argentine Cowbirds (A/, bonariensis).
This form is much larger than the Glossy (Af. b. minimus ) and has
a more southerly range. The Glossy used to be called Molothrus
atronitens, and those that came in 195(R) were the first of this race to
be in the Collection unless others previously acquired had also been
mistaken for the larger bird.
We returned on the S.S. Arakaka, a small ship that, in 1952, picked
up Dr. Bombard after he had been for fifty-three days in a rubber
dinghy sailing from the Canary Islands to Barbados, where he landed
after sixty-five days at sea. Dr. Bombard undertook this extremely
hazardous voyage to prove his belief that castaways could live " off
the sea . He took food with him in a sealed case, but he used none
of it ; instead he fed on raw fish that he caught and plankton, drinking
small amounts of sea water, water squeezed from fish, and rain water
collected when the chance occurred. As he says in his book, The
Bombard Story , as the translation is entitled, he would probably have
become insane had he not met the Arakaka , for owing to a navigational
error, he believed himself to be some six hundred miles nearer to land
than he actually was, a belief that was encouraged by the sight of a
number of Frigate Birds, Tropic Birds, and a Shearwater. This,
according to a publication brought out during the war for the benefit
of the shipwrecked, meant that land was near--three hundred miles at
the most--whereas he saw them more than a thousand miles further
out than this. After a short stay on the ship, he went back to his
dinghy and landed on Barbados twelve days later. The Arakaka
called at Port of Spain, anchoring off the harbour for a few hours to
take on oil fuel and other supplies. We could not spare the time to
go ashore, but Mr. Lau and Mr. Dickson, honorary curators of the
Trinidad Zoo, came out bringing with them a present of three Yellow-
winged, a Purple, and a Black-headed Sugar-bird. Near the islands
were a few Brown Pelicans resting on the sea and a number of gulls
could be seen close inshore.
Some very attractive birds have arrived at Regent's Park during
July and August : these include a pair of Macklot's Sun-birds
(Chalcostetha chalcostetha) ; two Little Green Herons ( Butorides striatus
javanicus), both of these new to the collection ; a Blue-breasted
Banded Rail ; a Burmese Slaty-headed Parrakeet (Psittacula himala-

Red-crested Wood Quail or Roulroul Partridges, all presented by
Sqdr.-Ldr. K. C. Searle. Another interesting and uncommon presenta-
tion was a Red-masked Gonure ( Aratinga rubrolarvatus, or A. erythrogenys
as it is now called). A Salle's Parrot has been received in exchange.
The breeding pair of Green-winged Kings had two young ones this
year and these have now left the nest, as have five Quaker Parrakeets
and four blue-bred green Masked Lovebirds.
The Herring Gulls have bred four young and the King Penguin
hatched during July is now quite large. The Grey-headed Gallinules
hatched two young in their first nest, but lost them : a second clutch
was laid and the resulting young one is now a large and apparently
thriving chick. It is still covered with black down and is still taking
food from the parents' beaks, but it now begins to feed itself. A Green-
backed Gallinule in the same aviary takes a great interest in the chick
and his attentions are well received by the parents, if indeed as we
sometimes wonder, they are both the actual parents. The Brush
Turkeys have been nesting and a chick that evidently emerged from
the mound unnoticed was found dead in the enclosure. An examina-
tion of the mound revealed four eggs, one of them apparently fertile.
Sonnerat's and Geylon Jungle Fowl have chicks and a number of
the common pheasants and geese have been reared.
Disaster overtook the flock of homing Budgerigars at the end of
July when one or two cases of psittacosis occurred among them and
all were destroyed, the perches and nesting boxes being burned. No
doubt this disease, which is, of course, by no means confined to parrot-
like birds, was contracted from the many pigeons and other wild
birds that frequent the Gardens and among which the Budgerigars
were often picking about on the lawns. This was particularly dis-
appointing, for the colony had been a thriving one and when I last
saw them at the beginning of July many of them were flying out and
making a fine show. When the boxes were inspected in June there were
thirty young ones nearly ready to come out, and at the time of the
destruction of the flock a further twenty-six young were in the nests.
Another serious loss was that of the Mantell's Kiwi from pericarditis
after only two years in the Gardens.
The young Amazon Parrot from Central America presented some
time ago by Mr. Chippendale is now identified as a White-browed
or Spectacled Amazon (. Amazona albifrons).

Members of the Club, 38 ; guests, 19 ; total, 57.
Before dinner, at the request of the Chairman, members and guests
stood in silence for a few moments as a tribute to the memory of the
Club's Patron, Mr. Alfred Ezra.
After the Loyal Toast the Chairman said she had very great pleasure
in announcing that at the Council Meeting in the afternoon Mr. David
Seth-Smith had been elected President of the Avicultural Society.
The new President's health, coupled with that of Mrs. Seth-Smith,
was then duly drunk with acclamation. Mr. Seth-Smith in his reply
said he felt greatly honoured to be elected to follow such great former
Presidents at Canon Dutton (Lord Sherborne), Mr. H. D. Astley, and,
of course, Mr. Ezra, who had been President for twenty-nine years.
The Chairman then welcomed Dr. F. H. Rayward, who was due
to return to Sydney the following morning. Unfortunately, owing to
indisposition Mrs. Rayward was unable to be present. Dr. Rayward
brought messages of greeting and good-will from aviculturists in
Australia which on our part are heartily reciprocated.

ANTING-LIKE BEHAVIOUR IN PSITTACINES
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.998182517241379" page_id="58091720"  page_num="Page 265" year="" vol="">
Mr. Derek Goodwin has in great detail described the processes of " anting " in
passerine birds. If the term " anting-like behaviour " could be used to describe the
application to the plumage of a bird of some irritant or volatile substance for
parasiticidal or stimulating purposes I would like to report on a definite process of
this nature observed in parrakeets.
A definite behaviour pattern has been observed here in three species of parrakeets
but I have reason to believe that most if not all of the Australian parrakeets will
tollow the same routine.
The substance used was the volatile Eucalyptus oil which is verv abundant in the
young suckers of the White Gum (.Eucalyptus redunca). Young suckers of this species
01 gum *were hung in the aviaries and the following behaviour, identical in every
respect, was observed in both members of pairs of the following species--Pennant's
Parrakeets, Blue Mountain Lorikeets, and Red-collared Lorikeets.
Oil was extracted by mascerating the bark in the region of the leaf nodes. The
leaves were not bitten ofl as is usually the case. After chewing the bark, the sides
oi the beak were rubbed on to the place until presumably some oil became adherent.
Irom here on the behaviour was completely stereotyped.
^i T1 r G * 1 1 WaS firSt , a PP lied to the preening gland with a circular motion of the beak.
Ihe feathers were then fully erected and the tail feathers preened. This was followed
by preening movements to the following parts in exactly this order--breast, then
tmghs and abdomen, under-surface of wings, back and mantle, then wing-coverts and
night leathers. The process was repeated several times, always in this order. The
feathers were fully erected throughout and the oil was usually applied first to the
preening gland, but on occasion directly to the part in question. The whole procedure
was carried on for from 15 to 20 minutes and was followed by several stretching
movements. &amp;
Apparently the Eucalyptus oil requires dilution with the normal oily preening
secretion, but the purpose of the full erection of the feathers could only be surmised
as to allow the oil to come in direct contact wfith the skin.

*. am ver Y sorry Mr. Boosey has taken exception to my letter regarding Marked
White Zebras. I intended to be informative rather than critical.
It was an error on my part in referring to his birds as being of " very poor quality "
and I hasten to apologize for this. What I intended to say was that they must be
P&lt;? orI # niarked " 35 nobody could ever dream of calling them " Chestnut Flanked
Whites " if they saw a really good specimen.
W'hilst on the subject of names I beg leave to ask by what right or rule does
Mr. Boosey assume the authority to name these or any other birds for that matter ?
These particular birds were originated and named in Australia and I feel sure all
fair minded fanciers will agree that this privilege should be ours.
It is of course quite possible Mr. Boosey's birds may be related to mine, but after
hlteen years I would say the relationship may be somewTat in the nature of our
relationship to Adam or Eve.
There is no need for further correspondence on this matter. I understand that
some really good specimens of the abcve variety have recently been sent to England
and Mr. Boosey is bound to see some of them.

BLUE RING-NECKED PARRAKEETS
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.962887875" page_id="58091721"  page_num="Page 266" year="" vol="">
I was very pleased to read in the current number of the Avicultural Magazine
that both Mrs. Clark and Mr. Vane have bred three young blue Ringnecks this
season and I think that--including our four--a total of ten of these beautiful
parrakeets reared in this country this season can be regarded as very satisfactory.
I was interested also to read that Mr. David West has bred two in America and
wonder if any were bred by other American aviculturists, or whether Mr. West's
two represents the total number reared in the U.S.A. this season. It would also be
of interest to know whether any blue-bred young have been reared there during
1955 an d how many blues there are at the present time in American aviaries.
Actually American aviculturists were in the favoured position of being able to
make an earlier start with this mutation than were their counterparts in this country,
as the late Duke of Bedford--possibly because he thought their climate better-- !
invariably sold to America any blue Ringnecks that he had for disposal.

I was very interested to read the article on Caiques in the current number of the
Avicultural Magazine, because my aunt, the late Mrs. Haynes, of Camberley,
had a Pionites melanocephala for many years. I cannot, I am afraid, now recall the
exact colouring of the under parts and therefore to which race it belonged. She
brought it over from Barbados about 1920 and had it for at least fifteen years.
What, however, has prompted me to write is that I well remember its antipathy
to me as a child, which you quote as characteristic of the Pallid Caique. On one
occasion when I was about 10 and approached my aunt, it leant forward from
her shoulder where it customarily perched and bit me just under the eye, and many
other times it came down from its perch just as Stolzmann described and chased me
round the room ! Later, when I grew up, it preserved a sort of neutrality, and
1 must say that I for my part was careful to keep well away from it.
It was of course devoted to my aunt and took seeds from her mouth. Incidentally,
she called it a Seven-coloured Caique.

I have read with interest the announcement of the breeding of Petronia dentata
by Mr. C. af Enehjelm, of Helsingfors.
It may interest you that the same species has been previously bred in the former
Rijswijk (Holland) aviaries of Mr. P. W. Louwman, owner of the Wassenaar Zoo.
The writer, who at that time personally took care for these birds, has looked up the
record, which says :
" Mid-May. 1933, the parent birds built a nest in a small nesting block high under
the roof of the garden aviary at Rijswijk.
" So shy were the parent birds that it was some time before we were able to identify
the species of the breeding birds, which shared a large aviary with many other small
birds.
" On inspection on 7th June, 1933, three half-feathered birds were found in the
nest. One was thrown out of the nest on 9th June.
" The other two left the nest on 12th June and lived to maturity."

THE EMERALD STARLING
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.981820166666667" page_id="58091730"  page_num="Page 275" year="" vol="">
(Coccycolius iris)
By J. J. Yealland (London, England)
The Emerald Starling was first described in 1879 by Oustalet,
who gave it the scientific name by which it is still known.
It is the only member of the genus Coccycolius and its known range is
French Guinea, northern and north-eastern parts of Sierra Leone,
and the hinterland of the Ivory Coast.
It is a bird of the open savanna country and is sometimes, at least,
to be found in flocks. The food appears to consist of insect life and small
fruits. Bannerman (Birds of Tropical West Africa , vol. vi) quotes
Mr. R. R. Glanville as saying : " I have seen this Starling on not
more than half a dozen occasions (in February and March) and only
at or near Yana and Kabala. Its distribution would appear to be
limited to the orchard bush north of 9 0 30&amp;apos;. Ants appear to be the
main food, and the stomachs of three birds examined by me were
distended with small black terrestrial ants. On the occasions on which
1 I saw this Starling it was in flocks of twenty to fifty, and was perched
either on tall trees near a stream or near a village or, if feeding, on the
bare ground in orchard bush recently burnt over by grass fires. I do
not know if this Starling is resident in the rainy season, but I am
inclined to think not."
Nothing is known of the nesting habits or the eggs of this bird.
The joint B.B.C. and Zoological Society expedition to Sierra Leone
in 1954 collected twenty-six Emerald Starlings which were then in
flocks. Most of the birds were in the immature plumage, not yet
showing the purple on the underside or on the sides of the head, this
colour being replaced by a dull light brown. There were, however,
one or two specimens in full colour. The sexes are alike in plumage
and, as the accompanying plate shows, the Emerald Starling is one
of the most beautiful of the family.

K. BONNER--DARENTH-HULME, I 955
DARENTH-HULME, 1955
By Kay Bonner (Southgate, England)
The present year has been remarkable for the breaking of records
of almost every description ; with us it has been the number of mice.
We have had literally hundreds and at one time it was not unusual
to catch twenty or so in a single night. We then started using " War-
farin No. 3 ", prepared specially for mice ; the standard strength for
rats is no use at all. We put down about three dozen baits and it was
not long before there was a very noticeable reduction in the number
of these very odoriferous visitors--actually this grade takes about
ten days to have effect. By persevering it should be possible to destroy
the whole of the resident mice but, unfortunately, there seem to be
numberless vagrants. In a large collection, with much waste seed
always available, one does not expect baits to be taken in preference
to canary seed, surely above all the favourite seed of mice. But the
addition of a little castor sugar acts like a charm. Incidentally, if
break-back traps are used, toast is by far the best bait for mice and
raw potato for rats. Against the latter we, of course, wage incessant
war, every conceivable type of trap is kept set--it is quite remarkable
how often an unsuspected marauder is caught--and baits are
replenished at frequent and regular intervals.
During the year there have been many matches, some hatches, and,
fortunately, but few dispatches. Our breeding results have not been
spectacular but we are, in the main, to blame in that we keep too
many birds, consequently there is a certain amount of interference.
The main range of aviaries has housed the following :
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.907785">
1. Stanley Parrakeets. We retained what we thought was the better
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.9524399" page_id="58091731"  page_num="Page 268" year="" vol="">
of our two pairs, but we were apparently mistaken. Whereas ours
failed to hatch their eggs the other pair, as seems to happen almost
as a matter of course on these occasions, reared four good young in
their new aviary at Whiteabbey--but possibly the air near the shore
of Belfast Lough is conducive to breeding.
2. Queen Alexandra's Parrakeets. By appearance one of the best
pairs in the country, by performance one of the worst. For the fourth
consecutive season they have failed to breed. The hen is a specialist
in laying here, there, and everywhere, also many of her eggs are
misshapen.
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.849268666666667">

of the year.

and a very ancient Peach-faced. The Cockatiels made several nesting
attempts, but they invariably came to nothing on account of intrusions
by the Lovebirds. The Jobi Island Pigeon bred last year also occupies
this aviary.

5. A dozen or so Lineolated Parrakeets. We now leave them
entirely to their own devices--their secretive nature prevents the
exact number being known.
6. Pennant s Parrakeets. Our most satisfactory pair of breeding
birds. This year they reared three good young, whereas last year
they reared two, and four in 1953 * The young all leave the nest in
near-adult plumage.
7. Abyssinian Lovebirds. For several years we have had three
pairs, but during the winter we lost a hen. They live in perfect amity,
but have made no serious attempts to nest. This species is essentially
one requiring an aviary to a single pair if success is to be achieved.
8. Bronze-winged Pigeons with young and a Jackson's Whydah.
9. Moustache Parrakeets.
10. Cactus Conures and a Weddell's Conure.
11. Six Yellow-cheeked Conures, four adults, and two young ones
bred this year.
12. A pair of Golden-winged Parrakeets, and Emerald-spotted and
Blue-spotted Wood Doves.
13. Golden-mantled Rosella and Jobi Island Pigeons. The latter
have hatched several young, but none has been fully reared this year.
14. Black-headed Conures reared a good nest of three young ; and
a Delamere's Whydah.
J 5 * Bronze-winged Pigeons have reared six young in four nests ;
and Masked Lovebirds.
16. Crimson-winged Parrakeets and Peaceful Doves.
17. Red-bellied Conures. We lost three during last winter and as no
eggs have been laid this year we rather fear we are left with four cocks.
18. Five Yellow-cheeked Conures made a great pretence of nesting,
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.984753058823529" page_id="58091732"  page_num="Page 269" year="" vol="">
but without result.
The Budgerigars in the escape passage in front of the aviaries have
again multiplied exceedingly. Many fine birds have been reared, but
there has also been quite a number which are very inferior. Some
pairs appear to consider quantity preferable to quality and, in their
anxiety to speed up production, encourage their offspring to leave the
nest prematurely, and then either feed them very half-heartedly or
leave them to fend for themselves. It is surprising at what an early
age the youngsters do succeed in fending for themselves. In this
flight there are also an odd Abyssinian Lovebird cock and a Peaceful
Dove.
The flock of Java and Barbary Doves now numbers over forty. Their
72 feet wilderness aviary is shared with two pairs of Crested Bronze-
winged Pigeons and several Purple-headed Glossy Starlings. Towards
the end of July we received eighteen Buffalo Weavers. These were
turned out straight away ; three rather rough ones soon died, but the
remainder are doing well. We had expected them to be quite noisy,

but so far they have been singularly silent. Naturally, we are hoping
that next year they will build one of their huge communal nests.
Our Red-faced Lovebird colony of twenty-seven still remains just a
colony. We really felt that if they were ever going to breed they
would do so during the past glorious summer when the weather was
so much in their favour, but such has not been the case, and we are
more than a little disappointed. The Diamond Doves in this aviary
also failed to breed, in fact the only young reared were several Chinese
Painted Quail.
Our main occupation during the past few months has been the
building of a range of seven 18 feet aviaries. They differ from any
aviaries previously erected in that the sides of the flights are con-
structed of wattle hurdles. Some Fruit Pigeons, especially Nutmeg,
remain very wild and scary, and are apt to injure themselves by flying
headlong into the netting. It is hoped that the use of wattles will not
only give much greater privacy, but also reduce the risk of collective
panicking.
Our Pied Imperials successfully wintered out and continue to
flourish, but owing to lack of suitable accommodation the Green
Imperial had to remain at the Zoo.
The nine outside pens still hold a miscellaneous assortment of
Pheasants--Golden, Silver and Amherst, domestic pigeons, bantams,
Triangular-spotted Pigeons, Bronze-winged Pigeons and their
numerous progeny.
Bird-room No. i houses a pair of Noble Macaws, one All-green, one
White-winged, and half a dozen Canary-winged Parrakeets, two
Senegal Parrots ; with Black-headed Conures, Rosellas, and Pennant's
Parrakeets in temporary residence.
Bird-room No. 2 is given over to what may be best-described as a
" Clowning of Caiques ". We are the very fortunate possessors of six
young White-bellied. It is rather remarkable but as far as we are
aware no one -has yet recorded the fact that in immature plumage the
head of leucogaster is so heavily mottled with black as to give the
appearance of a black cap. The mottling is gradually disappearing,
but it will be quite some time before they attain the full orange-
rufous of the adult. We still have our original pair of adults.
Finally, the house parrots consist of a pair of Greys, two Senegals,
a Meyer's, a Brown-headed, and a Black-headed Caique.

<bodyText confidence="0.999153761904762" page_id="58091734"  page_num="Page 271" year="" vol="">
It is standard avicultural practice to provide finches in cages and
aviaries with a basic diet consisting of three types of seeds : Canary
seed, white millet, and yellow millet. Other seeds, green food, and live
insects are usually given to supplement this basic diet, but such sub-
sidiary foodstuffs will not be considered in the present paper. Certain
finch species can survive and even complete successful breeding cycles
when supplied with a diet consisting solely of the two millets and
canary seed. The exact proportions consumed, of these three basic
seeds, varies, however, from species to species.
In the past, very general rules have been laid down as to the rough
proportions necessary for the various types of finches. These have been
based on the assumption that the smaller finches will prefer the smaller
seeds. In order to test this assumption more precisely, detailed analyses
of the exact seed preferences of twenty finch species have been carried
out and are reported below.
The results obtained are of interest both aviculturally and ecologic-
ally. Aviculturally, they provide indications concerning the most
efficient aviary feeding techniques. Ecologically, they provide
quantitative information concerning the relationship between seed
preference differences and the structural differences of the birds
concerned.

<bodyText confidence="0.986643928571429" page_id="58091734"  page_num="Page 271" year="" vol="">
Most of the birds used in the following tests are members of the
sub-family Estrildinas (waxbills, grassfinches, and mannikins) of the
family Ploceidae. A detailed comparative behaviour study of the birds
of this group is at present being made, which involves keeping a large
number of these species in aviaries. It was as a preliminary to this
study that the following experiments were carried out, in an attempt
to maintain the birds in the best possible conditions. Three non-
Estrildine species of finch were also available for testing and the
results for these are also included here.
Eighty-four birds, belonging to twenty different species, were tested.
Most of the birds w r ere housed in small indoor aviaries of dimensions
4 feet by 3 feet by 1^ feet, in heated birdrooms (temperature between
6o* and 70* F.) A few species were kept in larger, unheated, aviaries
(40* to 50* F.). Since the tests were carried out in the winter of

1 954-5, and the temperature difference between the heated and
the unheated aviaries was quite considerable, it is possible that this
difference influenced the seed preferences. As will be explained later,
this does not seem to have interfered with the results seriously. Never-
theless, when giving the results, it will be mentioned which species
were in the unheated enclosures.
Apart from the experimental seeds, the birds were allowed no other
foodstuffs during the testing periods. During non-testing periods,
however, they were provided with fresh green foods and live insects
as additions to their basic diet. During both testing and non-testing
periods all birds were given sand mixed with shell fragments and also
cuttlefish bone.
The experimental seeds themselves were of the best quality obtain-
able. The canary seed (Phalaris canariensis) was Moroccan. The white
millet (Panicum miliaceum) and the small yellow millet (almost certainly
Setaria italica ) were both grown in Australia. The canary seed is
larger than the millets and white millet is larger than yellow millet.
Full details of these and other differences between the seeds will,
however, be given later in the paper.
The standard experimental procedure was as follows : Four birds
of one species were introduced into one of the experimental aviaries.
These birds had previously been fed on a mixture of the experimental
seeds for a period of several months. They were now, for the first
time, presented with the three types of seeds separately, in three open
containers. The three containers were placed in a triangle on the
floor of the aviary and their positions were carefully randomized from
day to day to prevent any interference from " position effects The
circular containers were relatively large (diameter 7 inches, height
2} inches), and their walls turned inwards (1 inch) at the top, thus
preventing the scattering of the seed by the birds. This last point
is extremely important when testing finches, as they tend to flick their
beaks about in the seed. A smaller dish, or one with walls that sloped
outwards, would be useless for careful testing.
One hundred grams of each type of seed were given at the beginning
of a testing period. At approximately twenty-four-hour periods the
amount of seed remaining in each container was weighed (to an
accuracy of one-tenth of a gram). In a standard experiment seven
such daily tests were made. In some cases a second one-week experi-
ment was carried out, but no species was tested for less than one week.
If the weight of seed remaining in one container fell below the 50 gram
level during an experiment, all three containers were emptied and
refilled with 100 grams each. (This latter procedure was based on
information obtained from preliminary experiments, which revealed
that it was unnecessary to refill the containers each day, but that

preferences might be interfered with if one seed level fell to 30 grams.
The 50 gram level was therefore taken as being safe.)
The results of these weighings are given in the following section,
where the total amount ol each type of seed eaten per one-week
experiment is shown as a percentage of the total seed intake. The day-
to-day results are not given. The latter were taken only to ascertain
whether each species was showing a constant order of preference.
Whether this was so or not, is referred to in the report on each species.
It can be stated briefly here that most species did show a regular
daily order of preference, but that a few species were quite erratic in
some respects. Even the latter, however, were not variable in their
degrees of preference for all three seeds. Typically one seed would
always be strongly preferred, or strongly non-preferred, whilst the
other two would alternate in the preference order.
In some cases, four birds were not available for testing for a par-
ticular species. In these instances, experiments were run over longer
periods. For example, if only two birds were available, they were tested
every 48 hours instead of every 24 hours, and for 14 days instead of
7 days. All the birds used were adults ; birds which were breeding or
in moult (times when special differences in food preferences are
reported to occur) were not used.
The names of the birds, used in the following section, require some
explanation. Delacour (1943) recently revised the Estrildinae and, in
so doing, changed many of the scientific names. Since his revision has
not been adopted by certain recent authors (e.g. Bannerman, 1949 ;
Brooksbank, 1949 ; Risdon, 1953), but has been adopted by certain
others (e.g. Morris, 1954 ; Moynihan and Hall, 1954), both the old
and the new scientific names are given here with each species, in order
to avoid confusion. (The older name follows in brackets behind
Delacour's new name in each case where there is a difference.) There
is less difficulty with the popular names for, despite the fact that
almost every species mentioned possesses a number of such names,
there is usually one that is more widely recognized than its alternatives.

This species is not only one of the smallest used in these tests, but is
also one of the smallest of all finches. One pair of these birds was
tested. They were extremely constant in their seed preferences from
day to day. They ate practically nothing but yellow millet, as the
following percentages of seed eaten, calculated from the total figures,
reveal :

Four birds were tested. This minute waxbill is even smaller than
the last species, but its preference for yellow millet is less extreme :
Canary Seed, 5-1%. White Millet, 26-0%. Yellow Millet, 68-9%.
As above, there was very little difference in preferences from day
to day during the experiment.
B. GRASSFINCHES (Erythrune).
3. Bicheno Finch Paphila bichenovi (Stictoptera bichenovii)
Although this is one of the smallest grassfinches, it is not quite as
small as the previous species. Nevertheless, its seed preferences are
very similar, yellow millet being greatly preferred. Four of these birds
were tested and, although the results were very marked, there was one
complication. During the day-to-day testing of the seven-day experi-
ment, it was noticed that the strong preference for yellow millet
gradually became even stronger. The cause of this change was not
clear. It was thought that it might be the result of the birds becoming
more selective now that their different types of seed were presented
in different bowls, instead of as a mixture in one bowl. But this, if
true, should have applied to most of the species tested, which it did
not. In order to test whether this increased preference persisted a
second set of tests was made. This was done after a lapse of time of
thirty-four days, during which time the finches were always given their
seed in the separate bowls. 1 The results of the second experiment show
that the increased preference did persist. The results for both experi-
ments are given below :

testing. It was extremely constant in its preferences from day to day,
and ate practically nothing but yellow millet.

Eight birds were tested (four males and four females). Males and

preference was found between the sexes. Both the male experiment and
the female experiment were repeated and these second testings also
showed the same difference :

It will be seen from these results that the difference between the
sexes appears to be only one of degree, yellow millet being more
strongly preferred by the females. However, an examination of the
day-to-day preferences reveals that it was caused in a rather special
way. The females were fairly constant in their preferences, but the
males were not. Instead of showing slightly less preference for yellow
millet on each day, as the total figures might lead one to believe, the
males varied their preferences considerably from one day to the Aext.
On three out of seven days they showed a distinct preference for white
millet, while on the other four days they showed a preference for
yellow millet similar in extent to that of the females. This apparently
erratic behaviour had the general effect of reducing the level of their
overall consumption of yellow millet. Sudden day-to-day changes of
this sort were found in a number of species and their significance will
be discussed later.

This is one of the larger grassfinches, but despite its size it shows a
marked preference for yellow millet. One pair of these birds was
tested. They belonged to the red-billed race of this species, known as
Heck's Grassfinch. Two experiments were carried out because,
although the day-to-day results of the first were very constant, testing
was unavoidably cut short after only five days instead of the usual
seven. A typical seven-day experiment was then carried out after a
lapse of time of sixty days. Here are the results of both testings :

It is clear from these results that, although the strong preference
or yellow millet remains constant from experiment to experiment,
:he slight preference for canary seed over white millet, which exists
n the first, disappears in the second. Such a change as this, occurring
n a species with a constant daily preference, is of importance and will
)e discussed later.
7. Star Finch Paphila ruficauda (.Bathilda ruficauda)
Only one individual of this species was available for testing. Its
inferences were similar to those of the male Zebra Finches. It showed

varied considerably. Like the male Zebra Finches it preferred white
millet on three out of seven days and yellow millet on the other four.
As before, the amount of canary seed eaten was constant and rather
small :
Canary Seed, 14-0%. White Millet, 38-8%. Yellow Millet, 47-2%.
8. Red-browed Finch Estrilda temporalis (JEgintha temporalis )
The inclusion of this species amongst the grassfinches requires some
explanation, for it is normally thought of as a waxbill and often goe:
under the name of Sydney Waxbill. It is included in genus Estrilda
which contains most of the typical waxbills, by Delacour, and for the
sake of uniformity I have used his scientific name for the specie:
here, despite the fact that I do not agree with it. This, and other
related taxonomic problems, will be discussed fully in a later publica^
tion and for the present it must suffice to say that its affinities with the
grassfinches appear to be more fundamental, if not so immediately
obvious, than those with the waxbills.
Four birds of this species were tested. Two full experiments were
carried out with a gap of thirty-four days between the first and the
second. No seeds were strongly preferred or strongly non-preferred
but, within each experiment, the order of preference remained the
same on each day. Strangely, however, this order was not the same
in both experiments. In the first, yellow millet was preferred to canary
seed and canary seed was preferred to white millet on each of the
seven days. But in the second, canary seed was preferred to yellov
millet and yellow millet was preferred to white millet. Again, thi:
was so on every day of the experiment. As with the last species, these
birds showed a change, with a lapse of time, from one stable and regulai
preference to another equally stable and regular preference. The tota
figures are as follows :

On the whole the mannikins are larger birds than either of th&lt;
waxbills or the grassfinches. The Bronze Mannikin is an exception t&lt;
this, however, being little more than the size of a small waxbill. It i
not surprising therefore that it shows a marked preference for yellov
millet. Twenty birds were tested, in five groups of four. The result
of the first four experiments are as follows :

It will be seen from these results that the different birds, although
showing slight differences in the extent of their preferences, never-
theless always show the same order of preference. The difference in
degree of preference for white millet, however, between the four birds
in experiment a and those in d , is marked enough to indicate the
limitations of specific predictions concerning seed preferences.
A fifth group of four birds was tested in a large unheated aviary,
with the following results :

Although these birds also showed the same order of preference as
the other four, there is a shift in degree in the direction of the larger
seeds. Whether this was due to the temperature difference or not, is
not known.
These birds showed very regular preferences from day to day.
10. Black-breasted Mannikin Lonchura bicolor (Spermestes bicolor)
This species contains a number of races, some of which have been
considered as separate species in the past, but which have now been
lumped together by Delacour. The one pair of birds which was tested
here belong to the race (old species in this case) known as the Rufous-
backed Mannikin, Lepidopygia nigriceps. All the races of the Black-
breasted Mannikin are closely related to the previous species, the
Bronze Mannikin, and the following results show that the pair tested
here has similar seed preferences :
Canary Seed, 9-7%. White Millet, 33-3%. Yellow Millet, 57-0%.
This order of preference was stable from day to day.
11. Chestnut-breasted Mannikin Lonchura castaneothorax (Donacola
castaneothorax )
This species is a typical mannikin, being more heavily built. Despite
this, however, the four birds tested showed a seed preference similar
to the smaller Estrildine species, having a strong liking for yellow
millet :
Canary Seed, 8-6%. White Millet, 26-4%. Yellow Millet, 65-0%.
The order of preference for the three seeds was the same on each
of the seven days of the experimental period, but the preference for
yellow millet was more extreme on some days than others.

seed was, on each of the fourteen days, strongly non-preferred :

14. Bengalese Finch Lonchura dome Stic a ? (Munia domestica )
The origin of this domestic species is obscure and its ancestry will
be discussed more fully in a future paper. However, it is apparently
closely related to the last species and its seed preferences are very
similar to those in experiment b above :
Canary Seed, 6- 7%. White Millet, 48-9%. Yellow Millet, 44-4%.
Furthermore, the two birds tested showed exactly the same kind of
day-to-day variations, preferring one millet one day and the other the
next, but always taking very little canary seed.
15. Silverbill Lonchura malabarica (Euodice malabarica)
There are two races of Silverbill, the African and the Indian, which
used to be thought of as two species (called Euodice cantans and
malabarica respectively). The three birds used in the tests here belonged
to the African race. They were tested in unheated quarters. Their
day-to-day variations in seed preference were more erratic than those
of any other species tested. A second experiment was carried out,
which indicated a greater regularity between experiments as there
was within them.

are the Black-headed Nun and the Tri-coloured Nun (old names,
Muma atricapilla and malacca , respectively). The four birds tested here
were members of the Tri-coloured race. Their preferences were

This is even larger than the last species and is not only one of the
largest mannikins, but is also one of the largest of all the Estrildines.
Four birds were tested and they showed no marked preference or
non-preference :
Canary Seed, 30-6%. White Millet, 26-3%. Yellow Millet, 43-1%.
D. OTHER SPECIES (FringiUidae).
In addition to the seventeen species of Estrildine Ploceidae mentioned
above, three non-Ploceid species of finch were also tested for com-
parison and the results for these are given below. All three happened
to be members of the family FringiUidae and are therefore not closely
related to the Estrildines.
18. Cuban Finch Tiaris canora
This small South American finch is about the size and build of one
af the smaller waxbills and it is not surprising therefore that its seed
preferences are very similar to those of the small Estrildines. It is a
New World ecological counterpart of the smaller Estrildines, the latter
Deing confined to the warmer regions of the Old World. Its seed
Dreferences are extremely constant, both within and between experi-
ments, and show very large figures for yellow millet :

This species is a great deal larger than any of the foregoing and ii
was expected that the four birds which were tested would show #
marked preference for the larger canary seeds. This was far from the
truth, however, as the following results show :
Canary Seed, 2-5%. White Millet, 51 * 1%. Yellow Millet, 46-4%.
The results for canary seed were extremely constant, hardly an)
being eaten on any day of the experiment. No preference was showr
for one millet over the other, each making up about half the diet. Like
the last species, these birds were kept in unheated quarters.
20. Red-headed Bunting Emberiza icterica
This Indian Bunting, although not as large as the last species, is
much larger than most of the Estrildines. As in the case of the Iasi
species, it was expected that the pair of buntings tested would show 2
stronger preference for the larger canary seeds. Unlike the last species
they did so :
Canary Seed, 66-7%. White Millet, 21 -8%. Yellow Millet, ii -5%.
These birds, which were tested in an unheated aviary, showec
regular preferences from day to day.

For purely avicultural reasons, the seed preferences for each species
given above, are of interest in themselves. But zoologically, it if
worthwhile to ask why the different finch species should prefer differenl
proportions of the three types of seeds. The various possibilities wil
be considered one by one :
A. Food-variety Mechanism
r
It might be argued that such differences are simply the result of a 1
feeding behaviour mechanism that prevents a bird from feeding toe
long on the same kind of seed and which thus ensures a varied diet
To some extent this does seem to be true. There are in some casef
quite striking changes in certain preferences from day to day, or frorr
experiment to experiment, and changes such as these do not seen:
to be explicable in any other way. But over and above these there
are much more basic specific differences in feeding which coulc
certainly not be smoothed out by continued testing until all the birdf
had passed through all their supposed feeding moods. Also, most ol
the species tested showed rather constant preferences.
B. Seed Chemistry
It might be that chemical differences between the seeds are
important and that certain species have digestive systems suited to one

Although a scrutiny of these figures may give the impression that
here are considerable differences in the proportions of the contents
f the three seed types, such differences appear very slight when the
ontents of other kinds of seeds are studied. For example, maw seed
ontains 40 per cent fat and only 12 per cent carbohydrate ; red
ape also contains 40 per cent fat and only 10 per cent carbohydrate ;
nseed contains 25 per cent protein, and so on. In fact, if the contents
f a wide variety of seed types are studied, it emerges that no three
lore chemically similar seeds than canary seed and the two millets
ould have been selected. In view of the wide range of seed preference
ifferences found in the twenty species tested in the present investiga-
ion, it seems highly unlikely that the minor chemical differences
&amp;gt;etween the three seeds used could have played an important role. It
hould be stressed, however, that it would be most interesting to repeat
iich experiments, using a much wider range of seed types with greater
hemical differences.
1 . Seed Hardness
Since, in the present investigation, the seed preference differences
annot be explained in relation to the chemical properties of the seeds,
hie physical properties of the latter must next be considered. The
rst such property to be studied was the hardness of the three kinds
f seeds. Thirty individual seeds of each type were selected at random
nd each was crushed to find the pressure necessary for cracking it.

hardness in terms of pounds pressure required for breaking the seed.
The ordinate values show the numbers of seeds which were of each
particular hardness. It is clear from this that the yellow millet is
harder than the canary seed and that the latter is harder than the white
millet. Therefore, if seed hardness is an important factor, it must

follow that those species showing the strongest preference for yellow
millet must have the strongest jaw muscles. Unfortunately, no evidence
is available for the relative strengths of the jaw muscles of the twenty
species studied, but the fact that it is the most minute and apparently
the most frail species which show the strongest preference for the hardest
seed would seem to exclude this factor in the present investigation.
There is, it must be admitted, no a priori reason why a smaller finch
should necessarily be bound to have weaker jaw muscles, but, in view
of the next factor to be discussed, this last point does not seem to be
particularly relevant in the present case. Also the specific preference
orders are much less compatible with the order of hardness of the seeds
than with this next factor, which is seed size.
D. Seed Size
It has already been pointed out that the canary seeds are larger
than the white millet seeds and that the latter are larger than the yellow
millet seeds. It has also been mentioned that avicultural rules for
feeding different types of finches are based on the rough assumption
that the larger species will prefer the larger seeds. In order to test
this possible correlation more precisely, it was necessary to find some
single measure of seed-size preference for each species. Since the
weights of the individual seeds used reflect their sizes, and since it is

easier to measure weight than size in this case, the former measure
was selected. Five samples of each type of seed were selected at random
and one gram of each sample was weighed out. 1 The number of seeds
in each gram weighing was as follows :--

By taking average figures for each type of seed from the above, it is
possible to calculate, from the percentage preference figures given
earlier, exactly how many seeds each species had to eat to obtain one
gram of food. (Average preference figures were used where more than
one experiment had been carried out.) For example, if a very small
species was eating ioo per cent of the small yellow millet, it would
have to eat about 350 seeds in order to obtain one gram of food ;
but if a much larger species was eating 100 per cent of canary seed, it
would only have to eat about 120 seeds to get the same amount. In
fact, the species with the strongest preference for the smallest seeds,
which is the Avadavat, has to eat 336 seeds in order to obtain one
gram, while at the other end of the scale, the Red-headed Bunting,
which shows the strongest preference for the largest seeds, only has
to eat 166 seeds per gram. All the other eighteen species range some-
where in between these two extremes and the full data

284 D. MORRIS--SEED PREFERENCES OF CERTAIN FINCHES
The species are arranged in an order based on their preference for
" seed smallness " (= number of seeds eaten to obtain 1 gram of food).
Two measures have been selected to give information about " bird
size ", and the figures for these are also included in the above table.
They are, firstly beak size, and secondly, body weight. The former
(beak length) is given in millimeters and the latter in grams. Both
represent average values for each species and both are the result of
examinations of all the individuals used in the present study. The
average food intake in grams per bird per day is also given for each
species in the above table.
The correlations between the various columns of the table require
statistical analysis. If seed size is the important factor controlling
differences in seed preferences, then it would be expected that column A
would be inversely correlated with columns B and C. However,
despite the fact that it is body weight (G), rather than beak size (B),
that is probably more closely correlated with the intuitive concept
of " bird size ", it is nevertheless more reasonable to expect the beak
size to be more intimately connected with the seed preferences. Since
there is, in any case, bound to be a rough correlation between body and
beak size, the rough concept of bird size is undoubtedly valid enough
at a crude level. But with the aid of statistical analysis, the present
data can show the relative strengths of the inverse correlations between
A and B, on the one hand, and A and G on the other.
Furthermore, just as one would expect a better correlation between
A and B than between A and G, so one would expect a better correla-
tion between D and C than with A and G (i.e. one would expect
primary correlations between food intake and body weight on the
one hand and seed size preference and beak size on the other, but
only secondary correlations between other pairs of the four measures).
The following table shows the correlation coefficients obtained

conditions of the experiments, the size of the beak of each species was
correlated with its seed preferences.
Also, the correlation between seed preference and beak size is not
only much better than that between seed preference and body weight,
but the latter correlation is not itself even statistically significant.
The con elation between body weight and feeding rate is, however,
highly significant.
Finally, looking again at the specific preferences, it is noticeable that
a few species are markedly atypical as regards the relationship between
their beak size and their particular seed preferences. For example,
the Pope Cardinal and the Red-browed Finch show rather unusual
preferences and a skeletal examination of the palatal structure of
these two species might be rewarding.
Comparison with Other Species
A number of investigations have been made in the past into the
question of the possible relationship between differences in beak size
and their correlation with differences in food preference.
Lack (1947), in his study of the Galapagos Finches, noted the
existence of differences in beak size between closely related species
which ate the same general type of food. It was clear, however,
that the larger-beaked species preferred the larger fruits and seeds
and that the smaller-beaked species consumed mostly the smaller
seeds. For example, Lack states (p. 61) that u ... we observed that
the large, hard fruits of the manzanilla Hippomane mancinella are taken
freely by the large Geospiza magnirostris and the medium G. fortis,
but rarely if at all by the smaller G. fuliginosa ; on the other hand,
certain small seeds, notably of grasses, form a staple food of the small
G. fuliginosa , but are taken less commonly by the medium G. fortis ,
and rarely if at all by the large G. magnirostris ."
Here, as in the present investigation, an overlap exists between the
foods of the various species so that although the diets are qualita-
tively the same or similar, they nevertheless differ quantitatively.
More recently, Hartley (1953), Gibb (1954), and Snow (1954)
have shown that different species of tits may have similar diets but
that competition for food is reduced as a result of each species specializ-
ing in a different preferred type of food. These differences in preference,
like the ones recorded in the present paper, are correlated with
differences in beak size.
An experimental study of the pecking reactions of newly hatched
domestic chicks, turkeys, and Lapwings has been made by Curtius
( j 954)j i n which the young birds were offered seed-models of different
shapes and sizes. No preferences were discovered for any of the different
shapes used, but it was found that the Lapwings preferred to peck

at small models (i mm. size), the chickens at medium-sized models
(2*5 mm.), and the turkeys at large models (5 mm. size). The author
concludes that " there is consequently a proportion between the
dimensions of the bill and the size of the preferred object ", and also
that the different size preferences are inborn.-
Although this last study only deals with three species which are
quite unrelated, it is nevertheless very important since it reveals that
food size preferences can exist without any previous experience of the
different food objects. Also, since the birds only pecked at flat models
of food objects, instead of being allowed to eat real seeds, they could
not have been influenced in their preferences by such factors as seed
chemistry or seed hardness.
Conclusion
The present study reveals that, when twenty different species of
finch are offered qualitatively the same seed diet, they may nevertheless
show quantitatively different feeding preferences and that these differ-
ences are primarily correlated with differences in beak size, the birds
with the larger beaks preferring the larger seeds. This correlation
is far.from perfect, however, and other less important factors also
appear to be operating. Exactly what these latter are is not yet certain,
but seed hardness does not appear to be one of them.
Ecologically, these results are very suggestive, but the artificiality
of the circumstances in which they were carried out must not be over-
looked. In the wild, the birds would have a much wider variety of
both seeds and other types of food and only detailed and widespread
crop analyses would give the full ecological answer. Nevertheless, the
v present results reveal that finches with slightly different sized beaks
could live together in nature and eat qualitatively the same types of
seeds, but without seriously competing for food.
Aviculturally, the results show that beak size is a good rough guide
to the seed requirements of a species, but that it is not infallible. Also,
body weight (and therefore the intuitive impression of " bird size ")
is of little value in this respect, except at the very crudest level. Body,
weight is, however, a very good indication of the food intake of a.
species. In general, the rough seed proportions ^advocated for the
various species by previous authors are satisfactory, but in some
instances they do not compare at all well with the present findings.
To safeguard against inefficient feeding, a new species should either
always be given the different seed types in separate containers, or its
special preferences should be tested in the manner described here.
Use of the standard commercial seed mixtures may, in many cases,
not only involve the wastage of the non-preferred seeds, but may also
result in accidental preferred-seed deprivation.

By Professor J. H. Marchlewski (Krakow, Poland)
Experiments were started with eggs taken from nests found in the
wild. The eggs were transported to the laboratory by train or by
car, in a basket under a foster-mother. This way of transport was by
no means harmful to the developing embryos and the hatching of
the Capercaillie chicks was always normal. At the first sign of pecking
at the egg shells, the eggs were removed to a still-air incubator, for
in some cases the foster-mother (a domestic hen) will kill the newly-
hatched Capercaillie chicks. The chicks are always sturdy and lively
just after they get dry ; their down is yellow with brown markings,
and the tarsi and nostrils are thickly covered with down. The cocks
can be distinguished at once when carefully examined with a
magnifying glass, as they have a broad naked area above the eye,
whilst in the hens this area is narrower. In a single brood, which is
nearly always eight chicks, in some cases there are more cocks and in
others more hens. In one case a peculiar chick was hatched ; it had
grey down instead of yellow, and the colour was very like the grey
markings of the common European sparrow. Never before or since
have I seen a Caper chick like this.
The period of incubation of Capercaillie eggs is twenty-six days. This
fact was confirmed twice by my own experiments with the eggs of a
Capercaillie hen reared in captivity. The chicks when hatched were
kept in an electric brooder, some of them on soil taken from a wood,
and some on a wire-netting floor. The use of the foster-mother
(especially a domestic hen) proved to be unpractical and even
dangerous.
The chicks were fed from the first day with ant pupae, hard-boiled
egg, and crushed green peas. Some larvae of Tenebrio molitor and other
small insects were given occasionally. In some cases the food must
be held in forceps in front of the beak of the chick, until it learns to
eat from the tray. All sorts of fruit, such as cherries, etc., are highly
recommended. Quartz grit also should be supplied in quantities.
When the chicks are about four weeks old, they start to take a very
different kind of food ; chopped carrots and cabbage, unripe maize,
bread, wheat, delicate shoots of grass, etc., are taken very willingly.
When they are a hundred days old the cocks are nearly as big as the
adults, but their plumage is paler ; at this time they start to eat
conifer needles.
Mortality amongst the Capercaillie chicks reared in captivity is
very high, and it seems to be higher in cocks than in hens. Even the
cocks which survive about four months very often die after that time.

I observed this during three years of experiments. I do not real'y
know what may be the cause of this, for bacteriological and parasito-
logical investigation of the dead birds were entirely negative. Post-
mortem examination revealed symptoms very similar to those of
" blackhead ". In my latest experiment I used some arsenical com-
pounds as a preventive measure, and managed to raise a cock Caper-
caillie to the adult stage, and this cock started his display in April
of the following year. It was not, however, performed early in the
day as in the wild state, but as late as io or n a.m. The " song "
was quite normal, and its third part, which is described in Poland as
the " uncorking of the bottle " was very distinct. The mating with
a hen reared two years earlier was quite normal ; coition takes place
only when the hen crouches down and makes flapping movements
with her spread wings. Each hen which was reared in my aviary laid
five eggs in the third spring of her life. In the fourth spring, eight
eggs were laid. All the eggs were fertile, and all the chicks were
hatched, but not one of them was reared to maturity.
Rearing experiments with the Caper in England were carried out
in 1827. A pair of these birds was imported from Sweden, but the
hen died before the steamer Montrose Bay reached land. A domestic
hen was mated with the cock Capercaillie, and coition took place.
From several eggs laid by the hen, one hybrid was hatched, but died
the next day. In 1829 another pair of Capercaillie was imported into
England, and several young were hatched, but they all died in different
stages of growth. These experiments were described by the Polish
amateur naturalist, St. K. Pietruski, Jahresschrift d. Oesterr.-Gal.
Forstverems, Krakow, 1859, who was so interested that he made a
journey to England to see them. As is well known, the stock of the
Capercaillie now existing in Scotland is descended from a few adult
birds imported from Sweden in 1837 and 1838.
The Capercaillie in Poland is protected by the game law. Only the
cocks may be shot and only for a short period of the year, namely in
spring at the " leks The " leks " are carefully observed, and when
there are severe fights amongst cocks some of them may be shot.
This method has proved to be very beneficial for the preservation of
the species, the more so as the hens are absolutely protected, and the
collection of eggs is forbidden, with the exception of a few for scientific
purposes. In this way, the mating behaviour of the bird is fairly well
known, and his peculiar " song " has been described in detail. The
display actually begins in the evening ; the cocks fly to the " lek "
and roost on the trees for the night, and occasionally one or two utter
a few notes of the " song ". The hunter is present at the " lek "
in the evening, but is not allowed to shoot. He only obse ves, and tries
to remember the place where the birds roost. This is called the
" setting of the cock When it becomes quite dark, the hunter

withdraws for some two or three miles, and spends the rest of the
night beside a small fire. As early as 2 a.m. the display begins. The
hunter carefully approaches the " lek " and listens to the nearest
cock. He can tell from the intensity of the song whether the bird is
old, very old, or young. The old cocks, which are usually very
aggressive, must be removed from the " lek ". When the hunter
approaches so close that the " deaf note " can be heard distinctly, he
moves only while it lasts. In the few seconds during which the
" deaf note " can be heard, the bird is absolutely deaf, but he can see
very well. The hunter jumps towards the bird and the noise he makes
in cracking the ice or the dry branches never disturbs the " singing "
bird. The slightest noise made during other phases of the " song "
will put the bird up at once ; it will also take wing immediately when
it sees some strange shape. The hunter must get very close to the
bird, for shot guns only are allowed in this sport.

BREEDING BLUE RING-NECKED PARRAKEETS

season was the successful rearing of two young blue Ring-necked
Parrakeets. The parents were blues bred in 1952. During the 1954
season they were seen to mate several times and, although the hen
made a scrape in a large nest-box, she did not lay. At this time (1954)
the cock did not yet have his ring but he appeared fully mature
and quite capable of nesting.
During the 1955 season the pair began seriously displaying and
calling in early February. In March the pair did not seem nearly
so interested as they had been in February, and the cock made only
spasmodic attempts to feed the hen and display to her. During these
early weeks in March the hen continued to visit the nest-box and
ejected the greater part of the wood chips in it. The nest-box was a
large rectangular box about 4 feet high and 16 inches wide and
16 inches deep. Because the hen (during the 1954 season) appeared to
be a nervous sitter the box was hung slightly back in the shelter and
against a north wall of their aviary, which runs east and west and is
18 feet long, 4 feet wide, and 8 feet high. It was felt that this secluded
nest would give her some feeling of security although it frustrated me
since it was nearly impossible to see the nest without entering the
aviary.
About the middle of March I noticed that one of the primary flight

feathers had been dropped and estimated that this might indicate an
early moult and the end to any breeding attempts for the current
season. Also pointing to this conclusion was the steadily diminishing
attempts by the cock to feed or display to the hen.
On about 20th March I noticed the hen at the box entrance while
I was feeding in the early afternoon. I had not previously actually
seen her in the box, although the ejected wood chips indicated she had
been in the box at various times. Upon seeing me enter an adjoining
flight she flew away from the box but subsequently returned to the box
in about five minutes. That evening I believed she stayed on the nest
and during the next day sat steadily. To avoid any actions that might
discourage her the pair were left as nearly alone as possible from
this date on.
Following 20th March the hen sat steadily--if lightly. Unfortu-
nately the cock would warn her by calling of any unusual happening
with the result that she would immediately come out and survey the
situation for herself. Whenever it would be necessary for me to enter
their flight the hen would almost always come off--but as she always
returned to the nest within a few minutes I hoped for the best.
During these three weeks of incubation the cock was never observed
to enter the nest or even to alight on it. From a near-by perch he
would watch the nest, but apparently he was not allowed to enter
the nest or to approach the entrance. The hen would usually come
off early in the morning around 7.30 a.m., and again in the early
afternoon about 4 p.m. From my limited observations she appeared
to come off without being called by the cock. As soon as she was off
the cock began feeding the hen--or at least attempting to do so. This
was an interesting procedure as she appeared only to tolerate his
actions--and would allow him to feed her for a minute or so and then
would drive him away--only to permit his return in a few seconds for
another feeding when she would again chase him away. Fortunately
the cock appeared to tolerate and indulge these wifely vagaries and
all continued smoothly.
On 14th April the first sound of youngsters was heard. This was,
of course, an encouraging sound and it was now felt that half the
battle was won.
To encourage maximum feeding of the youngsters the following
items were included in the diet provided for the parents. The usual
grains, such as canary, millet, oats, and sunflower, were augmented
by as much hemp seed as the parents would eat. Past experience has
shown that many parent birds while feeding chicks will eat hemp in
preference to any other grain. Possibly it is easier to crack than
sunflower, canary, or millet. A large orange, apple, and a fresh
ear of corn and soaked bread were also given each day. Finally,
poa annua and pyracantha berries were given for greens, as the parents

were very fond of these berries. Unfortunately, here in Southern
California this grass (poa annua) only thrives in the winter months,
and by April it is pretty well gone. Because of this chard was also
given for greens, and an occasional branch of some deciduous fruit
tree such as peach or apricot.
Knowing that one can sometimes pretty well judge the number ol
young by the amounts of food consumed by the parents, I tried to
observe carefully how much time the cock was spending at the seed
dishes. His two preferences seemed to be the apple and the fresh
ear of corn for these were always the first eaten. After these the
greens were eaten and finally the various grains. Judging by the
amounts of food consumed it was felt that there were probably only
two or three youngsters in the nest. Although the cock ate quite a bit,
the hen during the first ten days was not seen any more frequently
than during incubation, which was not considered a particularly
encouraging sign. Of course, it was quite possible that she did come
off the nest earlier in the mornings and was not observed by me.
After the second week was over the hen began to spend some time
away from the nest during the day. She continued her old preference
for the fresh corn, and as usual wasted as much of it as she actually ate.
They both appear greatly to enjoy ripping the kernels apart and, as
with most psittacine birds, waste a great deal of the food. The cock
fed the hen very frequently and after the first week the cock began
to enter the box and by the tenth day the youngsters were easily heard
while being fed by the parents.
After the fourth week the cock no longer fed the hen very often
and instead entered the box to feed the young. At about this time
the hen caused some consternation because she again became very
short tempered with the cock. However, as this is apparently the
curse that all male Ringnecks must suffer, the blue male would
merely sidestep these temper tantrums and all continued to go well.
Young Ringnecks stay in the nest-box for a very long period--an
interminable one it seems when you are waiting to know how many
young are in the box ! I finally weakened and when the young were
seven weeks old took a quick peek ! The quick look revealed two well-
feathered youngsters and a single egg in a corner of the nest-box.
At this age the babies looked as if they might very well be able to fly,
although the tail was a little short. The parents did not seem to mind
the inspection--and shortly afterwards flew to the box and fed the
young. During these last few weeks in the nest the cock fed the young
every bit as much as the hen did. When either bird was in the nest
feeding the sounds were quite audible.
On the estimated fifty-fifth day subsequent to hatching one youngster
was observed looking at the world from the entrance to the box.
However, it was not until the sixty-second day that the first youngster

left the box, and the second bird left the nest the following day.
They were only slightly clumsy on the wing and appeared to be good
birds. The bills were more salmon in colour than red, but other than
this they resembled the parents in every detail. Quite needless to say
they certainly drew looks of admiration from their parents and
myself!
It is probably worth while noting that a second pair of blue Ring-
nccks, hatched in 1953, did get as far as a clutch of four eggs. Unfortu-
nately they were all clear--which is something of a disappointment.
With this pair the hen seemed more ready and capable of nesting than
the cock bird did--though he did display very energetically for quite
some time. His ring is just now coming in--and this bird is now about
twenty-five months old. With a two-year-old pair of lutino Ringnecks
the story was the same--great interest but they did not quite make
the grade and only got as far as readying the nest. Here again the
cock lutino is a two-year-old bird--and the red ring is just now begin-
ning to show as he is completing his moult.
That some two-year-old Ringnecks are capable of nesting is shown
by the fact that a split-lutino mated to a green hen nested and success-
fully hatched a single youngster from their clutch of three eggs. The
really unusual thing here is the fact that the hen did not approve of
any of the nest-boxes I provided and as a result she tunnelled under a
box and made her nest on the ground. She did a very good job, too,
for digging in our heavy adobe soil is no mean task. It was only bad
luck that prevented them from rearing the youngster, which lived long
enough to show that it would probably have been a lutino. Very
heavy late rains made the ground too damp, and probably caused a
chill, for the bird had a full crop when found dead. It will be
interesting to see if this hen persists in nesting on the ground in
preference to a box. The cock did not object, and on several occasions
he was observed sitting with her in their unusual nest.
I hope that these notes will be of some help to our members--for
although there are many references to the Ringneck and its colour
phases in the Magazine, not many of them give details. This species
is such a fine one for the collector that the details may be of some
help to members wishing to breed Ringnecks. I should add that the
breeding pair of blues did not pay the slightest attention to a young
male Bourke's that accidentally slipped into their aviary from an
adjoining flight one day while I was feeding. I could not use the net to
catch the Bourke's for fear of frightening the sitting blue hen--so
just decided to take a chance and leave the Bourke's in the pen with
the blues. It worked out just fine for the blues completely ignored
the Bourke's--even allowing him to eat in the same dish with them.

6 . Notes on some Aspects of Parental-behaviour
Both sexes assist in all the nesting processes . . . There is a definite
division of labour in feeding the young. At first the young are mostly
carried by one sex . . . and fed by the other, but after about a week the
male and female tend to feed different young. All the young may go about
together, they may all attempt to take food from the same adult; careful
observation shows, however, that nearly always each parent deliberately
feeds one or two young and no more, so that there is a definite distinction
between " male&amp;apos;s young &quot; and " female&amp;apos;s young "... Indeed, we
have seen the male attack and drive away " the female&amp;apos;s young &quot; and
vice versa.
Harrisson and Hollom,
The Great Crested Grebe Inquiry, iggi: 183-4
While threat, courtship, soliciting, and copulation individually have
their own special roles to play in the life of the Great Crested Grebe,
they also possess a collective ultimate function of enabling the species
to arrive at a state in which it can successfully reproduce its own kind.
The hatching and rearing of the young are the most vital activities
of all.
Comparatively little information is available in the literature, our
most important sources being the Grebe Inquiry, The Handbook, and
Hanzak's paper. Most of my own notes lie as yet undigested in field
notebooks and much work still needs to be done. Therefore the
present account is unfortunately only very brief and many points
must go entirely or partly untreated.

The female grebe lays her eggs at approximately 48-hour intervals.
In appearance these are at first a dull white, but later they become
stained by the damp nest material to varying shades of brown. Some
I have seen have been a beautiful russet tawny colour. It takes from
2-3 days for the eggs to change in this way. The grebe's egg has, in
fact, no less than three outer coverings : the original white surface
is a chalky layer over the real blue shell and probably helps to keep
out the damp, while the staining probably acts as camouflage. As
I have examined comparatively few clutches in situ, it is best to quote
the Grebe Inquiry on further points, as follows : " Of about one hundred
records sent in, clutches of four were in the majority, three being also

numerous, several fives, and two sixes noted ; also ones and twos.
Clutches of seven are very rare . . . The average of ioo eggs given
by Jourdain is 54-8 X 36-7. Maximum 62-7 X 37-8 and 46*5
X 39 ; minimum 46*5 X 39 and 55-3 X 34 mm."
Real incubation may start as soon as the first egg is laid ; then the
chicks hatch out at more or less regular 48-hour intervals. Often,
: however, the brooding of the first egg, and sometimes of the second,
1 too, is as spasmodic as the premature-incubation on the empty nest
(see p. 236). It is doubtful if this casual sitting has any real effect
on the development of the embryo. My own observations have added
nothing of importance to our knowledge on the actual incubation-
period which the Handbook gives as 27-29 days, usually 28. Hanzak
states that " In one case the fledglings hatched from the eggs already

on the 22nd day, which is less than the period recorded in the litera-
ture ". He gives no supporting details for this.
Both sexes sit in turn on the eggs, and at all the nests watched at
Burghfield, once true incubation had started they were brooded almost
continuously, except for a minute or two at nest-relief or if the birds
were disturbed. At the nest watched by Rankin (1947)--whose book
contains many interesting details of incubation routine, etc.--the
parents were not so attentive, possibly on account of the heat. The
posture of the incubating grebe varies. When used to all the different
activity around and not alarmed, it spends a great deal of time merely
resting in the pork-pie attitude on the nest. Otherwise, occasionally
or regularly, depending on its peace-of-mind, the grebe may brood

with its neck held straight up, head turning now this way, now that.
Much time is taken up, too, with preening and then the eggs have
to be turned quite regularly and the nest material arranged. In order
to turn its eggs the parent grebe stands up, curves its neck down and
tucks its bill under them, one at a time, using the under mandible.
Should an egg get misplaced on to the edge of the nest, it is retrieved
in the typical way : the grebe rolls it back by hooking the bill under
it. This habit obviously reduces loss through the birds' unavoidable
clumsiness. Occasionally, as would be expected, eggs are knocked
The grebe turns and recovers eggs with the same movement of the bill.
too far for recovery and I have found submerged ones below the
nest. Poulsen (1953) has studied this whole topic experimentally
and in the Disney him The Vanishing Prairie , there is a shot of a Pied-
billed Grebe retrieving an egg that had been carried away in the
feathers around the brood-patch.
It is unusual for the sitting Great Crested Grebe to get off the nest
to gather material, as did Rankin's pair. In fact, the incubating bird
normally leaves the nest only when relieved by the mate. It obtains
its own food during its off-duty periods and is not fed by the other.
With regard to this question of " connubial-feeding ", Miss Turner
once stated quite firmly, but almost certainly incorrectly, that
" When the hen was sitting her mate would swim to and fro during
the day, sometimes returning with food for her . . .". When an adult
does come to the nest with food or with a feather (see pp. 98-9)
it brings such items for the newly hatched young and not for the mate.
Often, of course, the chick may at first be inactive and hidden from

view and fails to respond to the offering. Thus, it is quite obvious
that Rankin's female grebe brought a feather for the youngster and not
for the male--" It was nearly half an hour before the female put in
an appearance . . . She hustled in through the rushes carrying a
small leather in her bill, which she proceeded to offer to her mate,
littering a gentle cooing noise meanwhile. What the purport of this
little gift may have been it is difficult to say but . . . she may well
have been seeking his approval of this small object. However, he
appeared quite oblivious of the frantic appeals she was making to
him, or even of her presence, and quietly busied himself with arranging
reeds around the nest--principally on the side farthest away from
her ! " Similarly, Jones's (1955) record of a fish being brought--
which he presumed was for the incubating bird which did not take
it, of course--may be explained in the same way. It seems quite
probable, also, that occasionally food is brought to the nest before the
time of hatching--in response to the peeping of the unborn chick inside
the egg.
The non-sitting grebe spends its time mainly in hunting for food
(for itself!), in preening, in resting, and in visiting the nest. When
hunting, it may have to leave the territory entirely, depending on
the latter's size and situation in relation to open water (see also
pp. 236-7). It rests in the territory, often not too far from the nest
site, sometimes in the same patch of cover (if this is relatively exten-
sive), but usually in full view in clear water, t# on station " as it were.
The nest is visited, on a roughly assessed average, about three times
an hour. The off-duty bird usually only stays for a few minutes at
most each time, often bringing, adding, or fiddling with nest material,
especially if it wants to brood. As its free period lengthens it comes
more frequently. If the mate does not get off the nest, the other
soon goes away again--obviously it is not in the species' interest for
both birds to advertise the position of the nest too much during the
incubation period by staying there together too long at a time.
Similarly, when the pair does change over, the relieved bird soon
leaves. There is no demonstrative ritual at the time of relief either,
though certain forms of behaviour do appear regularly, as will be
described in more detail in the section below.
V arious experiments on egg-retrieving, reaction to the moving of
the nest and to differently coloured eggs have been done by Hanzak
and Poulsen.
Nest-relief and Settling Down on the Eggs
In the majority of cases it is the off-duty grebe that initiates nest-
~elief by visiting the site. Only very occasionally does the incubating
)ne leave before the other comes to the nest, in fact Pair A did not
io this once during the whole of my long watch in 1952 (see below),

when over seventy reliefs were observed. However, the sitting grebe
does have the final word, for the other cannot take its turn on the eggs
until the nest is vacated.
During its later visits to the nest the free bird is obviously quite
prepared to incubate should the mate give way. As time goes on the
keener it becomes. Between spells of adding or arranging material,
preening, or even resting uneasily, it approaches the nest closely and
looks up intently, intermittently shaking its head and sometimes
habit-preening as well. The brooding bird may go through much
the same activities as its mate, preening when it does and head-
shaking with it. Occasionally quite an intense ceremony occurs.
However, if it still intends to go on brooding it often merely rests and
ignores the other.
Only a little time after the beginning of the final visit (about 1-4
minutes as a rule) the sitting grebe gets up, waddles down from the
nest, and flops off into the water. Female A in 1952 often quivered
her wings when she left but I never saw the male do this or any other
female from any of the other nests watched. She also had the habit
of following her mate for a few feet as he swam away, before she
returned to ascend for her spell. After being relieved the male and
female studied at the very same site in 1949 (Pair A49), each used
regularly to swim away from the nest in its own direction, one always
to the left, the other always to the right. The A52 pair had no such
routine. The relieved bird often preens, body-shakes, and flaps
as it goes. Sometimes it very soon returns to add material, and so on,
before leaving again.
The relieving grebe almost immediately gets up on to the nest,
usually in well less than a minute after this has been vacated. It
often has its tippets depressed as it " makes up its mind " to jump
aboard, which it finally does with a sudden leap. Some birds are better
than others in ascending, female A52 being much more clumsy than
her mate. Once up, the bird treads most carefully. Standing on the
near rim, it arranges the nest material and gradually advances,
with its feet well apart on the edge of the central depression out of
harm's way, until directly over the eggs. It may poke its bill down
among them. Finally, it heaves up its body, head resting back on
shoulders, remains thus very full-chested for a very brief second and
then, opening its brood-patch, settles down on the eggs. This whole
procedure always fascinates me even though I must have witnessed it
over a hundred times. The large brood-patch is exposed by the sudden
parting of the thick white under-feathers, reminding me of a wound
opening as the bare flesh comes to view. The grebe starts to shuffle
its body from side to side as it lowers itself and this movement reaches
its peak when the eggs are contacted. The bird settles breast first,
hind end raised a little with the feathers fluffed, and the wings droop

1949 I kept watch at several grebes' nests for a total of just over
40 hours. As I found that very few of the brooding-spells then recorded
lasted for anything near as long as the Handbook says, I decided to
make a more prolonged study of the whole problem later. This was
done in 1952 when I spent 136 hours in all, spread over 17 days,
observing at the nest of Pair A52 the two birds of which are figured
on page 9. All the information given below is based on this last work.
All together 54 completed brooding-spells were timed, 27 for each
sex and 27 for each half of the incubation-period--a very nice even
distribution.
Taking the records as a whole, first the individual spells ranged from
just less than half an hour up to just over 4 hours, with an average of
2 j hours. There were more long spells in the second half of the incuba-
tion period than in the first. During the first 14 days only nine spells
exceeded 2 hours, of which three just topped the 3-hour mark ;
during the second 14 days eighteen exceeded 2 hours, of which eight
passed 3 hours and two 4 hours. The female did slightly more work
than the male, her average " shift " lasting for 2-J hours as against
his 2, and during the 136 hours of observation she was on the nest
for a total of 53 per cent of the time and he for 47 per cent. Her
shortest spell lasted just over 40 minutes and her longest 4 hours

6 minutes. Corresponding figures for the male were 20 minutes and

found on the nest at any hour of the day and Hanzak's statement that
the female sits more frequently in the morning was not substantiated
by my records. So far as I could tell, the bird--male or female--that
happens to be sitting at nightfall spends the night on the eggs.
Covering over the Eggs
It is well known that the Great Crested Grebe covers over its eggs
with sodden weed so that they are completely hidden from view at
times. However, there are many misconceptions about this habit
and an attempt will now be made to clear some of these up. First
of all the eggs are not covered over when the grebe leaves the nest for
routine purposes but only after it has been alarmed by some enemy,
in the majority of cases man. The Grebe Inquiry is by no means definite
on this point. When disturbed the bird gets quickly up and, if it has
time, covers the eggs over with very rapid right and left movements
of the bill before flopping into the water. It may then dive right away,
to lurk furtively about with neck awash, displacement-preening
intermittently, or stay partly submerged in hiding near the nest--
depending on the proximity of the predator. If, for some reason, the
eggs have not been covered (for instance, the bird may have had
virtually no warning but found the foe almost on it), one of the grebes

will sometimes come back, if it can, specially to cover them before
leaving again. When danger is over the grebe returns and, first un-
covering the eggs with the usual movements of nest arranging, settles
down. Sometimes, if still rather alarmed, it will sit first and only
afterwards rise and move the weed ofT the clutch. Occasionally,
as has been noted by more than one observer, a grebe will go through
the actions of uncovering the eggs even though these have not been
previously hidden for some reason. Egg-concealing seems only to be
done once true incubation has started : incomplete clutches are often
left unhidden.
There has been more than one theory advanced to account for the
biological usefulness of this behaviour. However, there can be little
doubt that its primary function is to conceal the eggs--while the
parent is away--from aerial predators such as the Carrion Crow
(Corvus corone) that happen to be at hand when the disturbance occurs.
" The main reason for covering up the clutch seems to be protection
against an enemy from the air, crows, birds of prey of the genus
Circus, etc., which may attack the clutch from above ..." (Hanzak).
Cott has shown that the grebe's eggs are highly palatable. Great
Crested Grebes are very wary of Carrion Crows when nesting. On
27th May, 1954, Miss L. McCartan, Denis Owen and I were watching
a pair of grebes nesting on an exposed, isolated gravel islet at Burgh-
field. When a crow happened to fly innocently low overhead, the
incubating parent reacted by stretching up its head and spreading
out its wings in a cat-display-like posture, the wing pattern showing
up conspicuously. Later both grebes were in the water together when
the crow passed over again. Immediately one of them skidded over
the surface on its breast and jumped up on to the nest. It is interesting
to note that the grebe does not leave the nest when a crow comes near
and makes a strenuous effort to return and cover the eggs with its own
body if no other danger is imminent. On 8th May, 1955, I saw a
Carrion Crow raid a grebe's nest and carry away a fresh egg. This
all adds up to the conclusion that the concealing of the eggs with weed
is well worth doing if the birds are going to be away from the nest
for any length of time and unable to defend it from aerial enemies.
This happens, once full incubation has begun, only when the birds
are frightened off. However, it is very strange that, during the laying
period, the unstained white eggs may be left unhidden.
It is very doubtful whether the covering-over of the eggs with
rotting, and presumably fermenting weed actually helps to incubate
the eggs, as has so often been popularly supposed. Hanzak deals
with this point excellently. He shows among other evidence that the
nest itself is invariably cooler than the eggs, even when the bird
is sitting. He sums up as follows : " Thus we must conclude that the
temperature of the nest plays no role whatsoever in the development

of the clutch . . . the above conclusion is based on many measurings
which I undertook for this purpose." He wisely adds, however, that

cooling cannot be denied . . . Schiermann (1927) arrived by

Between the forehead and each eye is a bare patch of red skin and
another, strangely wrinkled on the crown. A white egg-tooth is
present on the distal quarter of the upper mandible. The wings are
rudimentary but the legs (slate-grey in colour with pink edges on the
lobes of the toes) are quite strong. The chick can soon clamber about--
on the nest and on the parent--and can even dive if necessary. It
does not, however, feed itself and is dependent on its parents for at
least the first six weeks or so of life, though it can, of course, both get
some food for itself a little earlier than this and still receive some after.
Some young remain with their parents for as long as 12 weeks, still
getting food occasionally though perfectly able to catch their own.
The Grebe Inquiry&amp;apos;&amp;apos;s statement that " The young begin to have some
idea of diving when about six weeks old, but do not feed themselves
until about nine weeks ", needs considerable modification. I have
known certain pairs to start second broods with first-brood young
only six weeks old--and these have survived although subsequently
only receiving very little food from their parents. Second broods are

not rare (as the Grebe Inquiry first showed), but can hardly be con-
sidered regular. At Burghfield only the birds occupying the large
feeding-territory in the breeding-pool regularly attempt one (see
p. 137), though all pairs usually replace lost clutches. Both parents
feed the brood as a rule but if they have only a single young one, either
may do so exclusively--sometimes the male, sometimes the female.
With Pair A in 1952 the female took the chick away from the large
territory for several days, leaving the male there alone. As already
stated on page 136, some territories are entirely deserted when all the
chicks have hatched, while others are only partly abandoned and
some not at all. In the case of broods consisting of two young ones,
both parents usually feed them indiscriminately but with larger
broods each adult may sometimes become responsible for certain ones
only. With these divided broods--of which more below--the two
family groups may separate but seldom for long, usually a few hours
at the most. After 6-7 weeks the adults often feed their brood less
attentively though the young may remain with them for as long as
12 weeks in all, as already mentioned. The juveniles become gradually
independent and often finally leave their parents peacefully though,
sometimes, they are more or less driven away by the increasing
aggressiveness of the adults.
Apart from the reactions directed at the parents, very little of the
behaviour of young grebes will be mentioned here, mainly for reasons
of space. At Burghfield independent young tend to form loose flocks
in the late summer and some courtship has been seen in such stripe-
head groups, generally low intensity Head-shaking Ceremonies. I have
known young of six weeks to head-shake at each other when still
dependent on the adults. The general striped pattern is characteristic
of the full-grown juvenile as well as the chick, though the three red
head-patches are eventually lost. Just when this happens I do not
know ; certainly not for many weeks after birth. Full-grown juveniles
have no tippets but possess a very short, dark, horn-like crest-patch
on each side of the crown.
For present purposes we may distinguish four main stages in the
development of the young : (1) the critical period of hatching ;
(2) the guard-stage ; (3) the later stage of dependence, and (4)
independence. The general names " young " and " stripe-head "
may be used for those grebes of any age that have not yet lost the striped
plumage. " Chick " denotes a young one that is still being carried
and guarded by its parents, and "juvenile" one that has passed
this latter stage.
Hatching and Brood-size
Hatching is spread over several days, especially if incubation really
did begin with the first egg laid, there then being two days between each

emergence. The question of hatching in the Great Crested Grebe
is one which still requires much determined study. For instance, it is
hard to understand the reason for the staggered hatching in a species
with precocious young and an apparently steady food supply. Then,
why is it that between the first hatching and final desertion of the
nest a few days later so few young survive ? The majority of broods
consist of one or two young ones, and only a minority of three or
more, and yet the normal clutch is of three to five eggs, usually four.
Is the loss due to infertility, desertion of the unhatched eggs, mortality
in the nest, or mortality as soon as the tiny chicks take to the water ?
These suggestions may each be considered in turn.
Infertile eggs do occur, but not in sufficiently large numbers to
account for the regular small brood-size. Besides, Hanzak did not
find a single clear egg in a whole colony of Black-necked Grebes
(Podiceps caspicus) with 20-25 nests. Yet this species, too, has small
broods like the larger species. Schiermann (1927) states that the
grebes regularly hatch out only two young at most because one parent
goes off with the first hatched chick and the other with the second,
deserting the remaining unhatched eggs. This is obviously far too
sweeping a generalization for a phenomenon which may sometimes
occur--just how regularly we do not know. While it is certain that
often only one or two chicks survive the period of hatching, broods
of three are not uncommon, those of four occur occasionally, and even
five rarely. For example, Rankin's pair hatched off three chicks
on 14th, 16th, and 18th May, and still continued to incubate the
fourth infertile egg for a while on the latter date. The species has a
safeguard against the premature abandonment of the clutch, which
though not 100 per cent effective, is better than nothing. This is the
loud peeping of the chick from inside the egg which obviously keeps
the parent attached to the nest for as long as possible. Rankin's
birds even continued to brood the infertile egg four days after the
hatching of the first chick. Pair A in 1952 went on sitting about
five days after the first birth and then only led away a single surviving
chick finally. This suggests that, in fact, some kind of mortality
after hatching limits the final brood-size. I have occasionally found
dead young in the nests of both Great Crested Grebe and Dabchick
(\0x25A0Podiceps rujicollis) that have obviously been crushed by a heavy-
footed parent. Even so, as with the other factors mentioned, this
could not be a major cause of small broods--none of them account
for the fact that on certain waters broods are regularly large (three or
more young) and on others regularly small. Hanzak states : " But
it is not rare that the grebes lead out the full number of fledglings (3--4).
On ponds of Bystrice, near Benesov, this is an almost normal pheno-
menon. In Bohemia a small number of fledglings is a local phenomenon
limited to certain populations only." This all goes to suggest that

predation on small young by large carnivorous Pike when they first
take to the water is the main reason for the reduction in the number of
young. It is the only explanation which takes into account the variation
in brood-size from water to water. The carrying of the young when they
are led away from the nest is a pattern aimed at reducing predation
by Pike. The Grebe Inquiry reported that Pike were responsible for
loss of chicks on 54 out of 74 lakes and were by far the greatest single
factor. Other causes of death were due to weed-cutting (at 4 lakes),
to Otters {Lutra lutra) (4), Foxes ( Vulpes vulpes ) (1), Herons (2), Trout
(1 Salmo sp.) (2), Eels (. Anguilla anguilla) (1), and to rain, etc. (4),
and other causes (4).
Soon after it has dried out, the chick clambers up on to the back
of the sitting parent, into the space between the folded wings. For it
to stay under the parent any longer than necessary would increase
the chance of its being squashed. The sight of an adult grebe with
one or more tiny striped heads protruding from the feathers of its
back, especially those near the neck, is one to arouse the parental
urges of the hardest of us ! During the hatching period, while the
parents are still attached to the nest, change-overs go on as usual.
The hatched chicks usually remain with the incubating bird but
are on occasions taken off by the non-sitting one, much depending
on chance. If the brooding bird is disturbed, it may cover the small
chick over with weed together with the remaining eggs. I once caught
a newly hatched stripe-head. It got off the nest and, as I approached
out of sight in the reeds, came towards me, giving a single, repeated
squeak (" queep "), obviously mistaking me for one of its parents.
When it did get a good view of me, it dived but I easily captured it
as it submerged. In my hand it at first kept doing swimming move-
ments with its legs, and called frequently. The adult grebe was obviously
attracted by this squeaking--which is the same as that from the
unhatched egg--and swam towards us as near as it dare. The chick
pecked at and held objects put near its bill : my fingers, a small white
stone, and a small grey one.
The Guard-stage
The nest is finally deserted when incubation ceases--apparently
when the last fertile egg has hatched. For the first ten days or so, one
parent carries the young on its back, usually remaining quietly at
one spot often near cover or the bank, while the other forages for and
brings food. This it normally gives directly to the young although
the other adult may sometimes take and pass the item to one of them.
The parents change over in these duties--as when incubating and
neither male nor female takes on one or other task exclusively, as the
literature has implied. Once incubation has ceased the nest is not
usually used as a resting-place or for other purposes. I have one record,

however, of a female grebe that got up on a disused platform and sat
there for several minutes with some young on her back and one in
the water. The chicks usually ascend the parent's back by their own
efforts by clambering up from the rear. They will attempt this even
when quite large and I once saw a 15-day-old one squatting ridiculously
on the adult's back. During the guard-stage the chicks are not carried
all the time but often get or fall into the water, especially when the
other parent comes with food. Towards the end of the period the
young spend less and less time on the back as they become too large
both for Pike to take and for the adult to carry. Rankin records
that the parent grebe will assist the chicks to ascend by placing its

leg along the water and literally giving them " a leg up " on to the
back. I have not yet seen this very interesting behaviour. The young
are dislodged by the adult's rising up in the water and body-shaking
(see p. 101) ; this may be the " special shuddering movement of
the old birds " mentioned by Hanzak. The Grebe Inquiry states that
" the adult gets tired of carrying the young and constantly jerks
the chicks off the back into the water ". If a parent does not wish a
chick to mount up, it swims away quickly before the youngster can get
impetus, sometimes rotating in the water also. Occasionally the adult
dives with young still on its back--these stay put or, more usually,
bob up to the surface like little corks. Hanzak also records that" once
a flying grebe was shot down in a duck-hunt ; it had a living fledgling
on its back
Feeding the Itoung , the Later Stages of Dependence and Brood-division

all of which are given alive. The adult carries only a single item of food
at a time in the tip of the bill, and swims towards the young, sometimes
diving en route. It holds a fish just behind the head and always presents
its head first. While the parent may raise its head to feed a chick
on the mate's back, it otherwise always holds the food right down so
that it is taken at water-level. The chick has to take it, too, for food is
never placed into its mouth never mind how young it is. At first
the young do not usually follow the hunting bird but remain at one
spot often, of course, with the other adult. Later, when they are
larger and the guard-stage over, they do tend to accompany their

parents more. Feathers are given from an early age--as early as the
very day of hatching at times, as both Hanzak and Rankin note.
The latter found that his first-hatched chick received only feathers
for most of its first day of life.
By the time the stripe-heads are a fortnight old both parents are
free to hunt food at the same time to satisfy the ever-increasing demands.
The young have a persistent piping or peeping " food-call " which they
utter frequently, especially on seeing an adult coming with food.
This call seems almost certainly a louder version of the " queep "
squeak already mentioned. The parent does not normally select a
young one to feed but is quite content to part with its load to the
first chick to reach it (providing, of course, in the case of divided-
broods, the youngster is one of its own charges). Hanzak states that
the young are fed on average about seven times an hour, but obviously
much depends on the size of the young, number in the brood, and on
whether one or both parents are foraging. I have not yet sorted out
my own notes, but the following cases come to hand and may be
given as examples. Thus, during the guard-stage Male A54 once fed
his three young eighteen times in 107 minutes. Then came a relief
and afterwards the female fed them twelve times in 75 minutes.
Once Pair X52 were observed for two 20-minute periods on the same
afternoon. The brood was divided, the male being in charge of two
young and the female of one. In the first period, the male dived for
food thirty-one times and was successful twelve times, each chick
receiving six feeds ; the female dived thirty times and was able to feed
her young one seven morsels. In the second period the male's young
received thirteen feeds between them from twenty-seven dives, and
the female's eight feeds from eighteen dives.

When the juveniles are older, from a month onwards according to
Hanzak, they may adopt a special posture when approaching a
parent. At extremes the body is mainly submerged with the head and
neck sticking sharply up out of the water, bill open showing the red
interior, and legs kicking out laterally to make a very noticeable
disturbance on the surface. In spite of the vigour of the leg actions, j
the stripe-head moves only slowly, as Hanzak also notes, all the while
peeping vociferously. It may snatch food very quickly from the adult,
turning away to make off at almost the same instance. Sometimes this
splashing posture follows a definite aggressive movement from the

parent and is often performed as the youngster swims away from
it. This all gives the impression that the young one is very apprehen-
sive of the adult. I believe that the posture--in which the red face-);
patches and mouth interior are presented frontally--is an appeasing
one. The parents not infrequently show aggressive behaviour to their
larger young and, though they never attack viciously, the value of the
stripe-heads possessing an appeasing display is obvious. I have seen
young grebes retreat before an aggressive Mute Swan (Cygnus olor )
in the same way and once recorded, in unknown circumstances
unfortunately, that an adult did so from its own mate.
As is well known, Great Crested Grebes, and also Dabchicks (Selous,
1905), may sometimes (definitely not always) divide larger broods,
the male parent taking sole charge of some, the female of the others.
This occurs once the guard-stage is over but exactly how we do not
know. At times the arrangement is a peaceful one but at others one
parent Great Crest may not only refuse to feed the other's young but
actually drive them off should they approach for food. Since this
extreme state of affairs was first recorded by Harrisson and Hollom, it
has largely been overlooked, The Handbook not even mentioning it.

pendently and I am very grateful to them for directing my attention
to the problem in 1952, in which year I also first recorded a case.

factions to Enemies
Great Crested Grebes and their young usually dive away from
nemies that threaten them from beyond a certain distance above
f ater, as previously mentioned (pp. 85--6, 142-3). Pike are the
lajor under-water danger to the young as outlined above and even
le adults are wary of them. I have never definitely seen a grebe
?act to a Pike and am very indebted to Derek Goodwin for sending
le the following record from Virginia Water Lake. " Adult grebe A
ras collecting food for two big young which were idling with adult B.
uddenly B seemed alert, stretching up its neck, apparently looking
r trying to see something under the water ahead of it. Then it
ffaxed and drifted back to the young. A little later A brought a
sh for the young. As it swam away to seek more, it passed through the
rea at which B had been looking. Suddenly with loud cries--I think
ather like the threat notes but very loud, startling and anguished--it
imped vertically out of the water, about 3 feet into the air, or so it
ppeared. It fell, or half fell, half flew back and as it hit the water it
iolently sped away, thrashing over the surface like a young duck
/hen chased. At the same moment as this began, the other three
eacted by fleeing in a similar manner, but with no initial jump,
way in a different direction. A eventually swam round in a wide
ircle to join them. The thing that most amazed me was that a grebe
hould jump or fly up as it did. I should have thought this quite
mpossible." He adds that both he and his companion " watched
arefully and saw no sign of another grebe or an Otter, so conclude
hat it must have been a Pike that was responsible ".
It is interesting to note also that when escaping from the Pike the
&amp;gt;irds did not dive and made a great disturbance on the surface.
During escape-bathing (see pp. 101-2) much the same occurs so
&amp;gt;erhaps the fish are put off when the water is splashed up. The
Dabchick calls when danger threatens and dives quickly raising a
loisy and noticeable spurt of water--thus alerting the young. I have
&amp;gt;nly seen this done as a reaction to humans but perhaps it is also
:mployed against Pike.
Other waterbirds do not usually directly harm young grebes though
derons take a very few (not at Burghfield). Mute Swans, especially
ndividual rogue ones, can be a nuisance. J. L. Fox tells me that at
bearwood (Berkshire), in this year, 1955, the parents of one grebe

Additional Notes
Page 4 : Display of the Dabchick. --Lorenz's notes on the courtship of th&lt;
Dabchick seem little known and are therefore quoted in full from the 193*
English digest of his original German paper. " . . . I would cite the
differentiation of the head plumage in grebes. In the smallest of the Europear
species, the Dabchick, a certain ceremony can be observed in which a mosi
singular shape of the head and neck is brought about by depressing the feathers
of the neck up to a sharply defined line just below the lower mandible, upward
from which the plumage of the head is erected. The sharp boundary between
the fluffed and depressed parts of the plumage in the Dabchick is purely
functional, no difference in feather length or color being visible in the quiescenl
or dead bird. Yet this line, in most other grebes, forms the boundary between
the short, plush-like plumage of the neck and the area covered with elongated
and brightly colored feathers on the bird's head." This survey provides us
with a good basis for a study of the evolution of display structures in grebes.
Page 5 : Display of the Western Grebe. --Since commenting briefly on the
courtship of this species, I have seen further cine shots of it in the Disney film
The Vanishing Prairie. In the mutual dash over the surface, each bird has the

back--as shown in the sketch by Gillmor who made it soon after seeing the
film. The two grebes terminate their dash with a sudden dive below the
water. The species has, also, a mutual Habit-preening Ceremony in which
male and female dip their heads repeatedly backwards to preen the back some-
where in the region of the scapulars. They do this side-by-side, and not when
facing as in the Great Crested Grebe.
Page 94 : Underwater Speed. --The Grebe Inquiry cites J. Vincent to the effect
that a Great Crested Grebe on a long straight dive could outpace him while
he was punting at 5 miles an hour.
Pages 94-5 : Flight. --The Grebe Inquiry gives one record of a timed flight
speed of 37 m.p.h. and quotes Vincent's opinion that the grebe can fly as
fast as the diving-ducks with a speed of 45 -- 5 * m.p.h. Two records are also
given of wing-beat rates, which worked out at 290 and 240 beats a minute,
lower than Meinertzhagen's 360-400 but still very fast.

Pages 97-8 : Eating a Fish. --When it is swallowing a large fish, a grebe may
ametimes push back with its feet during the head-jerking movements to give
tself more power in its difficult task. Also, besides washing the bill afterwards,
he bird often drinks as well, as noted by Hanzak.
Page 134 : The Flirtation of a Mated Female. --Soon after my statement that
had never seen a mated female " flirt " had been published, I found the
allowing record in my notebook for 1951 ! On 28th January (the day after
he events reported for Pair A, on pp. 192-4) the newly formed Pair B swam
owards its more dominant neighbours, Pair A, in forward-display threat.
&amp;apos;A became very aggressive and c?B retreated by diving. $B and cJA then linked
ip and H.S., both afterwards threatening JB together. $B afterwards dived
owards her mate, who went into the cat-display and a regular Discovery-
eremony resulted followed by H.S. The interesting points here are that
1) the B couple were only newly paired-up--which perhaps make the rare
vent of a mated female flirtation more understandable ; (2) a Discovery-
eremony occurred after the " unfaithfulness " and aggression of $B towards
ier own mate--this supports my theories on the causation of this form of
ourtship (see pp. 199-200).
Page 145 : Territorial Relationship with the Dabchick. --The Grebe Inquiry
mphatically states that " certainly there is no direct hostility or aggression"
ietween Great Crested and Little Grebes. This is incorrect. Dabchicks
ometimes turn up at Burghfield in the spring and those that are found in the
erritories of the larger species in the breeding-pool have little peace. They
re harried much as furtive, intruding Great Crests. It is a rather pathetic
ight to see the smaller bird being held by the neck and forced under the water,
.s occasionally happens. Tucker (1934) remarks that " it is observable that
)abchick are very often absent or scarce on waters where the larger species
lests. It is true that the Dabchick is in general more of a shallow-water
seder, but as the Great Crested Grebe will also sometimes breed on quite
hallow waters other factors must be involved as well ". These last probably
nclude territorial rivalry.
Pages 246-7 : Behaviour of the " Active " Bird. --Hartley (1937) reports that
vhen the " active " Dabchick is not inclined to mount the soliciting one,
! it may climb on to the nest beside the inviting bird and itself assume the
Touching pose ". On a normal weed platform there is no room for the
; active " Great Crested Grebe to do the same as this. Neither, however,
loes it regularly " invite " in the water when its mate is on the platform.
The pair that went through the platform stages on the sand-spit, were very
nteresting in this respect. The two birds were once seen performing the
nvitation-display side-by-side on their enormous artificial platform.
Conclusion : The Behaviour of other Species of Grebe
This paper has been concerned with the behaviour of the Great Crested
irebe ( Podiceps cristatus) and no attempt made to compare this fully with that
*f other grebe species, some seventeen in all according to Peter's Check-list
f the Birds of the World. In fact, however, very little seems to be known about
he behaviour of the majority of these and any competent observer that
indertakes to study one will be certain of a fascinating task. He will not have
tad the advantage, though, of a Huxley preparing the ground beforehand
s I have had. What is needed initially in a comparative study of grebe
&amp;gt;ehaviour is a really detailed objective inventory of the threat and courtship
lisplays of as many species as possible in order to trace the evolution of such
&amp;gt;ehaviour in the group as a whole. What a wonderfully exciting field of
esearch is crying out to be explored !

Of the other seventeen species, most is known about the Dabchick or
Little Grebe ( Podiceps ruficollis), but comparatively nothing about other
members of the same sub-genus (Poliocephalus), including the common Least
Grebe ( Podiceps dominicus) of the Americas. The strange, primitive Pied-billed
Grebe ( Podilymbus podiceps ) that force-copulates in the water is certainly well
worth serious study. Does it show normal platform-behaviour as well ?
And what of the Giant Pied-billed Grebe ( Podilymbus gigas ) of Lake Atitlain
in &amp;apos; Guatemala ? Then, I know of no ambitious work on another rather
mysterious species, the Western or Swan Grebe ( ASchmophorus occidentalis) of
North America, while the literature on its large relative, the Great Grebe
(As. major ) of South America, seems non-existent. Similarly, nothing at all is
known of the behaviour of other South American species such as the Short-
winged Grebe ( Centropelma micropterum) of Lake Titicaca, and the beautiful
Taczanowski's Grebe ( Podiceps taczanowskii ) of Peru. In truth, the American
literature on grebe behaviour is terribly disappointing. Of the species that
the New and Old Worlds share, most is known of the Black-necked Grebe
(Podiceps caspicus ), though even here we really only have a series of fragmentary
notes. Little is available on the Red-necked and Slavonian Grebes (Podiceps
griseigena and auritus ). This last species abounds on Lake Myvatn in Iceland
where it should be easy to study. What is known about all these birds is
summarized in volume 4 of The Handbook.

On 13th June, 1934 ? the North of England Zoological Society was
founded and took over the Chester Zoo, which had been established
in 1930 by Mr. George S. Mottershead. This important event was
celebrated by a Garden Party on 13th June, 1955, which was attended
by several hundred people representative both of the county and city
and from far afield. A further celebration was held on 18th October,

Cheshire, Viscount Leverhulme, and Viscountess Leverhulme, the
Mayor and Mayoress and Sheriff of Chester, the Chairman of the
Cheshire County Council, the Clerk to the County Council, the
Town Clerk of Chester, and many other local dignitaries. Also present
were Dr. Edward Hindle, F.R.S., Founder and first President of the
Glasgow Zoo, Mr. E. H. Tong, Superintendent of Whipsnade Zoo,
Mr. G. T. lies, Superintendent of Belle Vue Zoo, Manchester, and
Mr. D. H. S. Risdon, Superintendent of Dudley Zoo. The Avicultural
Society was represented by Miss Phyllis Barclay-Smith, Editor of the
Avicultural Magazine.
After the loyal toast, the Chairman proposed the toast of the
visitors, and this was replied to by Viscount Leverhulme, who paid
high tribute to the great progress made by the North of England
Zoological Society and to the excellence of the Chester Zoo. He
pointed out the unique character of the Zoo, and emphasized its
particular beauty in the wealth of flowers which was always to be
found in the gardens. In tracing the history and growth of the Society
Lord Leverhulme mentioned that in 1935 the total receipts for the
year had been #1,120, and there was a deficit of #213, whereas in
1954 there had been a profit of #10,000. The rules of the Society
stipulated that all surplus money should be used for the further
development of the Zoological Gardens, and therefore very rapid
strides had been possible. He referred enthusiastically to the great
achievements of the Society's Director-Secretary, Mr. G. S. Motters-
head, whose far-sightedness, initiative, and ingenuity had carried the
Zoological Gardens through critical periods and to whom so much of
its present outstanding success was due.
The toast of the North of England Zoological Society was then
proposed by Colonel F. Saxon, O.B.E., who also emphasized the
great progress that had been made. Mr. A. F. Holden replied on
behalf of the Society, and mentioned some of the difficult situations
they had had to face, including the shortage of funds, but in spite of
which they had won through ; he also, referred to the great part
played by Mr. Mottershead.
Miss Geraldine Russell Allen, who mentioned that she had been
a member of the Council for twenty-one- years, in a charming speech
paid special tribute to Mr. G. S. Mottershead. She told of his resource-
fulness, his hard work, and his unceasing determination never to
accept defeat--this characteristic of his had been of inestimable value
to the Society, and to this was owed the position the Zoo held to-day.
She understood the Mottersheads were a long-lived family, and she
hoped Mr. George Mottershead would be true to type in this respect.
She then presented to Mr. Mottershead, from the members of the
Society, an inscribed silver salver and ten Chinese carved ivory figures
representing ten trades, of which, as Miss Russell Allen aptly remarked,

Mr. Mottershead was master of all. The presentation was followed
by prolonged applause.
In his reply of thanks Mr. Mottershead said that ever since he was
a small boy it had always been his ambition to have a Zoo.
All members of the Avicultural Society will wish to join in good
wishes for the future of the Chester Zoo, and in congratulating
Mr. G. S. Mottershead on his great achievement.

OBITUARY
HERBERT WHITLEY
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.9989284375" page_id="58091783"  page_num="Page 318" year="" vol="">
Following the death of our President, Mr. Ezra, and our member,
Major Pam, our Society has suffered yet another grievous loss by the
death of Mr. Herbert Whitley, of Primley Hill, Paignton, on 15th
September. He died at the comparatively early age of 69 after many
months of illness and suffering.
He came of a Liverpool family which migrated to Devonshire and
was the youngest of three brothers and unmarried. He was a very
remarkable personality, entirely devoted to the world of natural history,
and fortunate to be able to follow his hobbies with very large, and
indeed unrivalled installations and collections of plants, birds, animals
of every description, tropical fish and reptiles, domestic pigeons by the
thousand, and a great variety of poultry. He became a member of our
Society in 1923, by which time many acres of his property on the other
side of the road from Primley Hill were rapidly developing into a
beautiful garden setting to house a zoological collection of the first
importance. Those of us who were privileged to visit him were amazed
each time we went to find more and more accommodation being built,
with bricklayers and carpenters at work on new houses till darkness
fell each day. At that time some of us were thinking in terms of tropical
greenhouses with birds flying loose in them--Mr. Whitley's response
was a vast house some 240 feet long, with a tropical water lily house
at one end and a central passage with eight large greenhouses on one
side and a number of smaller compartments on the other, all
magnificently planted and garnished with huge specimen plants
and tenanted by some of the choicest birds in glorious condition--
incidentally, this house, embracing also beneath its span a tropical
aquarium and reptile house, was planned on half a sheet of note-
paper : every detail of construction was thought out by the owner
and his workmen on the spot without the help of an architect.
It was followed by a new parrot house and other very numerous
indoor aviaries, until it was claimed that the visitor could walk half
a mile through bird houses without going out of doors.

In 1927 the garden was opened to visitors on payment of a small
admission charge and remained so till 1937, during which time many
hundreds of summer and winter visitors to Torquay, and very many
of our own members too, came to regard it as the Mecca of naturalists.
There were frequent articles in our Magazine praising the beauty
of it and enumerating the many species and their breeding. Dr. Hop-
kinson in 1931 wrote a series of four articles describing a tour of the
garden which took him a week to see in detail. These, and other
notes by Mr. Seth-Smith in 1925 and by Mr. Delacour in 1930 are
well worth reading again. It was a sad blow to aviculturists and
naturalists when in 1937 a disagreement arose between the owner
and the Inland Revenue authorities, who insisted on the payment of
an entertainment tax out of the small admission charge made, and took
Mr. Whitley to court. It was in vain that he argued that his private
collection was not an entertainment because nothing was specially
staged for the benefit of the public. I was instrumental in getting the
Council of our Society to take up the matter with the Revenue authori-
ties in the interest of our members, but without avail, and Mr. Whitley
closed the garden to visitors. The collection, however, continued to
grow ; almost every day something new arrived from the dealers,
and fresh accommodation was continually being provided until the
fateful year of 1939. With the outbreak of war, the fearful increase in
taxation, and the insoluble difficulties of finding food and labour
to nourish and care for such a host of creatures, Mr. Whitley dispensed
with a very large part of his collection and handed over the garden
on lease to a company.
One's impression of all the installations was the overriding concern
for the comfort and condition of the livestock rather than its attractive
presentation, although this was at its highest in the great tropical
house. No detail was too small to overlook : the placing of perches,
the covering of the floors, the feeding, the provision of privacy, and
in the case of temperamental birds the addition of inner flight cages,
in which the male of a pair, or sometimes the female, could be shut
apart to avoid jealous quarrels.
Heat was provided in very many of the houses and the inmates
of these were heavily syringed in the morning. The resulting condition
of the birds was wonderful : experienced parrot keepers frequently
told me they had never seen parrots in such perfect condition. In
consequence of all this many rare birds bred, some successfully, others

Pigeon (0 h dip haps), Kagu, Grey Struthidea, Red-wattled Guan,
Red-billed Gurassow, Giant Condor, Raven, Sun Bittern, and Stanley
Crane.
Mr. Whitley was very fond of producing hybrids ( #C you never know
what it may lead to ). There was a range of small flights known as
" China Town ", containing three " streets ", in which almost every
possible cross of Lovebirds was made.
He pioduced a hybrid Eclectus Parrot from the Grand crossed
with the Red-sided, a nestful of hybrid Amazon Parrots from the
Green-cheeked and the Spectacled, hybrid Pionus Parrots from the
Yellow-billed and the Blue-headed. He crossed the Royal Starling
with the Superb Spreo and Heck's Grassfinch with the Spice Bird.
His name is perpetuated in the Whitley's Conure, a large species of
which only one specimen ever arrived and was new to the British
Museum of Natural History.
Successes on the show bench were also very numerous : the first
time I ever saw Mr. Whitley (and the only time I ever saw him
wearing a collar and tie) was at a Crystal Palace show with a superb
team of winners. He had travelled overnight in the guard's van with
them.
It would be ungracious to conclude this article without mentioning
the name of the lady in charge of all the birds, Miss Gladys Salter,
for over thirty years the faithful friend and retainer. She was in
control of a staff of up to a score of assistants and working all hours of
the day and night.
Time was of no account at Primley : night was turned into day.
Mr. Whitley ate one meal a day and seldom went to bed before
five o'clock in the morning, and in his last years not at all. The nights
were spent perhaps potting plants in the greenhouse, or feeding giant
toads, or looking up books of reference, or playing snooker with the
staff (this became the custom twice weekly, ending with cups of cocoa
at 5 a.m.).
His vast knowledge, gathered from personal observation, was not
alas committed to paper for the benefit of us who follow him : he
scorned the reading or writing of chatty books or articles which he
always said were likely to hand on inaccurate statements to posterity.
He was not readily accessible except to true fanciers and enthusiasts,
but to these he would give unlimited time and be extremely generous.
He loved arguing with everybody and frequently confounded the
scientists. Withal he had a great sense of fun and of the ridiculous,

My association with Herbert Whitley began when I visited Primley
</equation>
<bodyText confidence="0.999195314285714" page_id="58091788"  page_num="Page 321" year="" vol="">
in 1949, during an interval between my zoological collecting trips to
the tropics. Thus I did not know him when the Primley avicultural
collection was at its best.
In the autumn of 1952 I came to Paignton Zoo to tend the reviving
post-war collection, and for three years I have been privileged to have
frequent access to Mr. Whitley in connection with the management
of the Zoo. Discussion often developed far beyond the immediate
matters of Zoo business, and I was able to benefit from his wide
knowledge and experience in various fields of zoology and natural
history. He gave very readily the fruits of his mind to those he con-
sidered genuinely or seriously interested.
Conversation with " H. W. ", as he was affectionately known to
some of us, often went far into the night, even into the small hours.
A zoological problem, more often than not, demanded research, when
reference would be made to the many fine books in his library for
checking and cross-checking. Whitley had a remarkable memory,
but he always wanted accuracy and so he usually preferred to verify
the facts from his books. He was a unique and wonderful tutor on
these occasions ; his knowledge on many subjects was, in my view,
unrivalled and based on profound wisdom.
Whitley's understanding of birds, both as an aviculturist and as a
fancier, was extraordinary. His enthusiasm was great too ; I remember,
for instance, his pleasure at seeing newly-arrived Guira Cuckoos
from Paraguay, his gratification on picking out a Blue-bearded Jay
from a group of Pileated Jays, and his expression of praise for our
Head Keeper when Occipital Blue Pies were reared this year.
One of the last discussions I had with him concerned Steamer
Ducks. He was too unwell to rise from his sofa to consult the large
lexicon in his study and I went for him to obtain knowledge of some
Greek derivatives. His interest in all such matters was sustained to
the end.
Herbert Whitley was a kind and sincere man. His methods, like his
opinions, were forthright. His ideas on the governing of zoos were
sound, and if the standards he set are followed to-day zoo science will
progress in the right direction.

Wreathed high with a glorious canopy of red, golden, and yellow
autumn flowers, Herbert Whitley was laid to rest in that beautiful old-
world churchyard of Buckland on the Moor, near Ashburton, Devon ;
looming in the rear was Buckland Beacon, alive with bird life on a
glorious autumn day.
The church of St. Peter was full to overflowing with people from
all walks of life, doctors and the ordinary farm-worker had all come to
pay their last respects to one of England's real old country gentlemen.
To me fell the honour of being organist for part of that simple but
impressive service.
Herbert Whitley will be for ever remembered for his love of all
living creatures, his knowledge and understanding of aviculture in
particular.

My first meeting with the late Alfred Ezra was on a Sunday after-
noon in July of the " Amazing Summer " (1940), and a more peaceful
afternoon could hardly be imagined in those troubled times. He
showed me every item of his then truly magnificent collection and
in the evening we talked for a very long time. My outstanding recollec-
tions of the collection in those days were the great variety of softbills,
the yellow Indian Ringneck, and blue Alexandrine Parrakeets,
neither of which I had seen before ; the cranes, ducks, pheasants,
and Guinea Fowl, all in delightful surroundings. Other exhibits
in the collection at that time were Guilding's Amazons and New
Guinea Green-winged King Parrots.
I visited Foxwarren Park again later that year in Mr. Seth-Smith's
company and again had a delightful day, but it was not till September,
r 953 &amp;gt; that I was able to pay a further visit. I found Mr. Ezra then
very old and very crippled but very alert mentally and as eager as
ever to talk about birds. The collection was then only a shadow of
what I had known it thirteen years before, due largely to the owner's
failing health, but I was delighted to find the New Guinea King
Parrots still there and breeding, and that some of the cranes were still
breeding as well. Another interesting exhibit was a pair of almost
pheasant-like Ground Pigeons ( Otidiphaps ) from New Guinea, with
a tail-flicking action reminiscent of a Rail. Mr. Ezra was a charming
host; avicultural visitors were always welcome and I remember that the
late Dr. W. Hamilton of Adelaide spent much time at Mr. Ezra's
home in the early 1930's and frequently mentioned his wonderful
hospitality to me.
He was, perhaps, the last of a generation able to indulge in aviculture
on the grand scale ; I fear we shall not see his like again.

Leader K. C. Searle, who also donated two Nicobar Parrakeets

Red-sided Titmouse ( Parus varius).

The Long-tailed, or Streamer-tailed Humming Bird, is common on
Jamaica where it is known as the " Doctor It is one of the larger
humming birds and one of the most beautiful. The crown and nape
are of a velvety black ; the front is bright metallic green with the
wings and back a more golden-green. The flights and tail are black
and the bill is coral-red with a black tip. The feathers of the hinder
part of the head are long, resulting in a tousled occipital crest, and the
two tail feathers from which the bird gets its name are some seven
inches in length.
Grauer's Sunbird is a sub-species of the Lesser Double-collared
and inhabits the mountainous regions of eastern Congo and south-
western Uganda. The Daurian Redstart breeds in eastern Asia
and winters in south-eastern China, Indo-China, and Formosa.
It must be many years since Nicobar Parrakeets (also known as
Red-cheeked Parrakeets) were previously imported. This bird is
confined to the Nicobar Islands and is obviously a near relative of the
Long-tailed, but has not the striking beauty of the latter, which is
perhaps the prettiest of all parrakeets.
The Red-sided Titmouse is sometimes trained by the Japanese to
pull up a small wooden bucket attached to a string. The bird is kept
in a specially made cage having a balcony where the performance
takes place. Some tit-bit is, of course, put into the bucket as a prize
and in order to get the reward the bird must make several pulls,
holding down the string with its foot to prevent the bucket slipping
back. Bucket-bird is another name for these talented performers.
A bird that has never before been in the collection is the Grey
Phalarope ( Phalaropus fulicarius). A specimen was found in the hold
of a ship in the London docks, but it was in a weak state and lived
for only a few hours after arrival at the Bird House.
Other interesting presentations are a Lesser Orange-breasted Green
Pigeon ( Treron bicinctus ) given, together with a Southern Hill Mynah,
by Mr. J. Frodsham, and a Blue-crowned Hanging Parrakeet ( Loriculus
galgulus ) given by Mrs. Denny. A pair of Tui Parrakeets (. Brotogeris st.

in exchange and two Cockatiels ; four Ceylon Jungle Fowl, two
Sonnerat's Jungle Fowl and a White-crested Kalij have been bred in the
Gardens, the Jungle Fowl being reared by the parents. One Brush
Turkey chick emerged from the mound of leaves at the end of
September, but owing perhaps to the lateness of the hatching it lived
only about a month.
The Gallinule chick is now fully grown and is very greenish on the
back, so looks more than ever like a hybrid between Green-backed and
Grey-headed.
The pair of Crested Screamers nested on the roof of a shelter in the
Great Aviary, but did not hatch any chicks.
The Great Indian Hornbill that has been in the Gardens since 1923
died recently.

Members of the Club, 54 ; guests, 34 ; total, 88.
There was also a number of visitors, including Sir Philip and Lady
Manson-Bahr and W. J. C. Frost, to see the films.
After the Loyal Toast the Chairman said he would like specially to
welcome Mrs. G. E. Glass, from South Africa, and Professor Jacques
Berlioz, of the Paris Museum of Natural History.
In introducing Mrs. Darnton and her husband the Chairman said
that Mrs. Darnton was perhaps best known to members of the Club
as an aviculturist. She had in the past bred some very good birds,
notably Layard's Parrakeet, for which she had been awarded the
Society's Medal. She was now rapidly gaining an enviable reputation
as a wild life photographer, and her articles in the Illustrated London
News were important contributions. Mr. Darnton could perhaps be
best described as the technician of the partnership.
Mrs. Darnton then showed her latest coloured film " From Hippos
to Sunbirds ", of which she has written the following synopsis :
" This film was taken on a 1,500 mile safari in Uganda last March

and April. We first visited the Queen Elizabeth Park where we took
various pictures of elephants, hippos, buffalos, waterbuck, and a
lovely chestnut-coloured Uganda Kob.
The Safari Lodge where we stayed, perched on an eminence between
the Kazinga Channel and Lake Edward, is most picturesque, the
cottages being built of palm logs, thatched with papyrus.
The Lake has several promontories where one can observe great
companies of birds--Pelicans, White-backed Storks, Sacred and Wood
Ibis, Egyptian Geese, etc., together with many small waders, while
perched aloft on the tall finger-like branches of the Euphorbias,
majestic Fish-Eagles survey the scene.
Moving on to Fort Portal on the foothills of Ruwenzori, we were
fortunate in being able to find and photograph, in the Mwamba
Valley, a tribe of pygmies dancing to the accompaniment of pipes and
drums in a clearing of the forest. These primitive people live entirely
on the produce of the Equatorial forest, such as wild roots, berries etc.,
which they collect as they move along, for they have no settled villages,
but merely erect a few palm fronds or branches to form rough shelters
wherever they happen to be. Their vegetarian diet is sometimes varied
by any small animals that they can drive into their nets which they
stretch between the trees. Occasionally they stalk, and manage to kill
an elephant, shooting at the animal's feet with their minute bows and
tiny arrows tipped with poison. When eventually the huge beast
succumbs the whole tribe gorge for many days on the mountainous
corpse--burrowing their way into the carcass--the entrails being a
particular delicacy ! The Murchison Falls were our next objective,
and here we lived in a tent on an escarpment overlooking the Victoria
Nile. It was just below the lip of this escarpment that I was lucky
enough to find a new race of the Swallow-tailed Bee-eater together
with their nest, and after waiting by the camera for nearly 3 hours--
in the boiling sun !--I managed to get a close-up of one of the parent
birds, with a beakful of insects, going into the nest hole.
From the camp to the Falls the banks of the river are the haunt of
huge crocodiles, and in the heat of the day many herds of elephant
come down to drink. Hippos too are much in evidence, while many
waders and other water birds can be seen, also a small island where the
trees are laden with nesting Sacred Ibis. The last part of the film is
devoted to birds ; Red-shouldered Cuckoo-Shrikes, Ross's Touracous,
Broad-billed Rollers, Hornbills, Double-toothed Barbets, several species
of Sunbirds, Crowned Cranes, and the gorgeous Red-breasted Shrike.
On 28th November we fly once more to Africa, where we plan to
visit the Belgian Congo, Uganda, Kenya, and Tanganyika armed with
two cine cameras, a 4 Paillard Bolex ' and a new and very fine
Arriflex.' both complete with a battery of lenses--and backed by
the spirit of adventure and boundless enthusiasm."

Everyone present must have been in complete agreement that this
was one of the very best films the Club has had the pleasure of seeing,
and the Chairman surely expressed the opinion of all when he said it
was of a very high standard indeed. Judging by the sustained applause
the audience fully appreciated the " camera craft " of Mr. and Mrs.
Darnton.
Mr. Vane said he would like to compliment the photographers. He
knew only too well the trials and tribulations experienced by the
would-be nature photographer. In the taking of this film many
difficulties had been encountered and successfully overcome and he
thought the result was really outstanding.
The next meeting of the Club is on 11th January, 1956.

birds into the U.S.A. in spite of controls and preventive measures
by the authorities. The following are offered at the moment : Salmon-
crested and Leadbeater's Cockatoos, $500 each ; Sulphur-crested
Cockatoos, $250 ; African Greys, $200 ; Macaws, $100 to $200 ;
Caiques, $100 ; and a short time ago Hyacinthine Macaws, $1,100
each.

On 9th May, 1955, four young Crowned Wood Partridges (.Rollulus
roulroul) were hatched at the Wassenaar Zoo. Two were fully reared,
which they believed to be the first bred in Europe. This, however,
is not the case. The late Herbert Whitley had two reared of four
hatched at Paignton in 1926. There is a coloured plate and a full
account of the event in the October, 1927, number of the Magazine.
This bird has also recently been bred in the Rotterdam Zoo " Blijdorp

Miss Vicki Batterson Young, of Portland, Oregon, has succeeded in
hand-rearing the Willow Ptarmigan. Twelve eggs were at her disposal,
being some brought from Alaska by her brother Wesley Batterson. All
twelve hatched, but the hen the chicks were placed with killed two
and crippled two others. A red heat lamp bulb was then used. After a
month four died, but the surviving four are now half-grown and doing
well.

CORRESPONDENCE
A REQUEST FOR ARTICLES ON SOFTBILLS
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.998052666666667" page_id="58091797"  page_num="Page 330" year="" vol="">
May I take this opportunity of making a suggestion ? The articles in your Magazine
are very interesting, particularly to members who specialize in the rare foreigners.
Here in Ireland, however, being unable to import Ornamental Pheasants, Parrots,
Lovebirds, etc., we are forced to confine ourselves to the more common type of
bird. Of these, our pet shops mainly concentrate on seedeaters, as I meet many
fanciers here who fear they would be unable to keep the softbill foreigners owing to
the difficulty of feeding them.
On this account I personally, and I believe most of those here who are becoming
interested in Foreign birds, would welcome articles on the more common type of
hardbill and softbill. I am sure that some of your experts could supply an article
which would be very interesting to us in Ireland. I would like to see an article on
soft food (ingredients and preparing of), and on birds such as Shama, Pekin Robin,
Spreo and Glossy Starlings, Quail, Mynahs for talking, etc.
I know that you recently had an article on Starlings, and that Cage Birds publish
articles similar to the above, but would you not think that notes something on the
line of the above would have a greater appeal to the number of beginners who are
interested in the hobby ? Considering that you have the " experts " among your
numbers, and so could get some of them to supply articles, I believe that an article
on Tanagers, Fruitsuckers, and the above-mentioned foreigners would be worth
considering, and I put it forward as a subject for your consideration.
The Pharmacy, J. p. Newell.

MARKED WHITE ZEBRA FINCHES
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.927346416666667" page_id="58091797"  page_num="Page 330" year="" vol="">
With regard to Marked or Chestnut-flanked White Zebra Finches, Mr. Whitehouse
has apologized for saying that our birds must be of very poor quality, but that he
persists in his totally unwarranted assumption that they are inferior specimens is
evident from the hope he expresses that I shall soon be able to see some really good
ones.
Although I have no desire to prolong this correspondence, I really must protest
at the utter unfairness of Mr. Whitehouse casting aspersions upon the quality of our
birds, when he has never even seen them.
As to the naming of this variety, which he claims to have originated, he owns that
the Australian name of Marked White Zebra Finch is not a good one, but completely
ignores the obvious solution I suggested in my last letter--i.e. that he should find a
really suitable name for them himself.
