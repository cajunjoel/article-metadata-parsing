Tricholaema lacrymosum
By M. D. England (Neatishead, Norfolk)
The Spotted-flanked, which is found in Central and East Africa* is one
of the smallest of the true barbets* even smaller than the Red-fronted
which is no larger than a Nuthatch. Both scientific and English names
refer to the drop-like spots on the flanks of the birds at all ages* although
it is perhaps straining the imagination rather far to suggest that they are
tear-drops!
Although charming and lively in its ways* it cannot be described as a
gaudy bird* since the plumage is almost entirely black and white* with the
faintest yellowish tinge in the wings and superciliary stripe. Unlike most
of its near relations, which are virtually unsexable except to another bird
of the same species* the sexes of adult Spotted-flanked Barbets may easily
be distinguished because the eye of the female has a red iris* that of the
male being bright yellow. Immature birds have a greyish iris for the first
few months. Males are exceedingly intolerant of other males of their own
species and their large bill can inflict rapid and serious damage if two males
are left together in the breeding season.
A pair which I imported privately from Mr. and Mrs. Barnley in Kenya
under licence in 1975 were put* by themselves* in a 20 foot aviary with a
heated shelter section 7x5 feet. They had access to the flight in all weathers
and, except when nesting, seemed to prefer being outside, however wet
and cold. They were fed on soaked sultanas, diced apple* chopped grapes*
mealworms, small crickets and locusts. Like most barbets* they relish
cuttlefish "bone"* especially when grated fairly small* and feed an amazing
amount to their young.
They are lively* friendly little birds* but have a monotonous call of a
single note repeated ad nauseam (one might almost say "ad distractum" y
except that it soon becomes part of the background bird noises). It is not
difficult to distinguish the sexes by the call because* although both use
repeated monosyllables* the male's is a sharp* urgent "chup", whereas the
female's is less abrupt, not so loud and more nasal.
I went to Trinidad in April 1976* having before I left put in their
shelter--not very optimistically--a rotten silver birch log with two

M. D. ENGLAND--BREEDING THE SPOTTED-FLANKED BARBET
ex-barbet holes in the higher part of it. On the day of my return, June 19th,
although my wife had exciting news about other species, she said the
Spotted-flanked must be moulting because they were not even calling.
Before entering the shelter, I glanced through a peephole just in time to
see one of them disappear into a tiny hole right at the base of the log.
After a moment, it emerged and its mate entered; they were feeding
young, probably very small ones since they stayed a further three weeks
in the hole. The entrance hole was so small that I should not have believed
it possible for them to squeeze through--at its widest it was only 1 x 6 -inch.
Regurgitation is a word which is used rather loosely ornithologically;
in the case of these birds the feeding of the young varied, according to age,
from the time when the regurgitated food was obviously considerably
digested by the parent to the post-fledging period when food was only
slightly mandibulated before being passed over. In the intervening period
it was swallowed but taken straight to the nest, so digestion must have
been minimal.
Two strong youngsters emerged--at two days' intervals, as is usual with
barbets--and very quickly they were able to feed themselves and to fly
the whole length of the flight.
Although there are many records of the young of a first brood "helping"
their parents to rear those of a second--including species differing as
widely as bee-eaters and gallinules--I can find no reference in the literature
which is available to me to a second (and third and fourth) clutch of eggs
being incubated by the chicks of a previous brood, however fortuitously,
and I confess that it took me a long time to realise that this was happening
with these barbets.
My wife was the first to notice that something mathematically unreason-
able was going on. One day she said to me, "Have you counted the
Spotted-flanked to-day ?", to which I pessimistically replied, "Oh, don't
say one's dead! I thought I saw four in the flight". "There are, but go and
count /" By the time I got there, three of them were in the shelter and a
fourth was poking its head out of the nest hole.
Now young barbets, especially those of the genera Lybius and Tricho -
laema , have a habit of returning to the nest after fledging, sometimes
remaining there for several days or coming and going until they eventually
only return to roost, so I thought little of the face at the hole . . . until
I looked out of the window: a fifth bird was in the flight!
To cut a not very long story short, these remarkable birds reared four
broods--of 2, 1, 2 and 2--between June and October (one of the young
later disappeared, but the small clutches are not unusual with barbets in
captivity). Rather unhappily, I believe they were incubating yet another
clutch when I had to remove them from the aviary, although I did not
cut open the log to see.
Whichever way one looks at it--and I am the last to claim to be a
mathematician--there must have been growing young plus eggs (or even

smaller young) in the nest together for much of the period of five months
or less. I obviously am not sure of either the incubation or fledging
periods, although those of related species are 16-20 and 28-plus days
respectively, but taking the shortest time from laying to fledging as
44 days, four times 44 just will not go into the number of days between
June and mid-October.
If a parent had been in the hole for long periods, and if the cavity had
been large enough for the parent to incubate eggs beside the growing
youngsters--which it certainly was not--it would not have been so very
surprising: I have known parrots do something rather similar in a spacious
nest box. But there is no doubt that (a) there is not room for this in a
barbet's very restricted hole and (b) both adults spent a considerable
amount of time in the flight with older youngsters while incubation and/or
brooding of small chicks was taking place in the nest by young which had
not themselves reached the fledging stage.
As described, Mr. M. D. England has bred the Spotted-flanked Barbet
Tricholaema lacrymosum and it is believed this may be a first success in
Britain. Anyone knowing of a previous breeding of this species in Great
Britain or Northern Ireland is requested to communicate with the Hon.
Secretary.

COMMENTS ON THE VIOLET-EARED WAXBILL,
ITS CLOSEST RELATIVES AND HYBRIDS
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.988777333333333" page_id="56386323"  page_num="3" year="" vol="">
By F. C. Barnicoat (Johannesburg, S. Africa)
This species has so often been described and depicted that a further
description is superfluous. No painting captures the wonderful lustre of its
plumage and its matchless beauty among the waxbills depends so much
upon its graceful movement, lovely slender form and surprising length of
tail, that it must be viewed in the flesh in sunlight to be fully appreciated.
The combination of mauve (light or Parma violet) and cobalt blue with
liver-brown, set off to such perfection by the brilliant red beak and eye
ring, is unusual and very striking. Not surprisingly, many fanciers have
fallen for its beauty and it has not proved an easy bird to keep in captivity,
let alone to breed, although under ideal conditions it sometimes does well.
Comparatively recently the Violetear (granatina) and what I would
regard as merely a geographical race, the Purple Grenadier (ianthinogaster)
from East Africa, long in a genus of their own-- Granatina , have been inclu-
ded with the blue waxbills in Uraeginthus. No doubt they have much in
common but, though both are fairly delicate in aviaries, the two "grena-
diers" are less willing to go to nest than the Cordon Bleu, Blue-breasted or
Blue-headed Waxbills.

F. C. BARNICOAT--THE VIOLET-EARED WAXBILL
The Violetear is a much sought after aviary bird in South Africa and
fortunately, like all the waxbills, it is deemed suitable for aviary life by the
Transvaal Provincial Administration's Department of Nature Conserva-
tion, which traps a limited number of pairs each winter for sale to bona fide
bird fanciers under licence and subject to aviary inspection. This is the
only legal means of acquiring any local wild bird and they cannot be sold,
exchanged or even moved without permission and departmental adjustment
to the relevant permits of the bird fanciers concerned. This governmental
control over bird keeping is not only regarded as justified but is welcomed
by sincere aviculturists because this legal source of birds mitigates the
unscrupulous trapping by individuals bent only on personal financial gain,
and uncontrolled trapping of a species as sparsely found as the Violetear
could in time have posed a serious threat to the species. Because the number
of Violetears trapped by the Department of Nature Conservation is strictly
limited, the token price asked for it is five rands, twice that of any of the
other species offered for aviculture. Thus most of our wild bird fanciers have
at least one pair of Violetears in their collection and it is usual for 10-20
specimens to be benched on our shows, where a good one is likely to go far,
as it is by nature a tight feathered bird and makes an extremely attractive
exhibit, although it is fairly difficult to stage one to perfection. They are
sometimes bred in captivity, though not as often as they should be, and it is
generally regarded as second only to the Black-cheeked Waxbill in difficulty
of breeding. There are many fanciers who have kept succeeding pairs over
many years and have never reared them to maturity. The successes go
undocumented for the most part, mainly because there is no avicultural
journal in this country, the south African feathered world only having
lasted from 1953-56. The Avicultural Society's medal for the first breeding
was awarded to Mrs. Drake (1936). The first South African breeding
(given by Parker 1961) was by Dave Bellack in 1942. Strachan (1957)
bred Violetears with repeated success and many others have reared it: I
bred the species myself in 1958. This year two fanciers in the Rand
Avicultural Society have been successful, Hennie Steyn and Johan Mare.
The Purple Grenadier entered the avicultural scene much later than the
Violetear and it was bred first by Boosey (1958). In South Africa a number
of people have been successful, notably Stuart Shillinglaw, whose con-
certed effort to found an aviary-bred strain will be mentioned later. My
own pair threw their young out of the nest on several occasions in 1962. The
Purple Grenadier is regarded as a foreign bird in South Africa and may
therefore be held and sold freely. It is still occasionally imported when it
fetches 40 rands or more, quite a high figure for a small and delicate bird. It
has extensive areas of deep violet on its breast and the female is a light fawn
attractively spotted and barred with white and with a white eye ring as well
as a small blue cheek patch. The colours of the Purple Grenadier would
perhaps make it potentially the more beautiful of the two, but it is inclined
to be looser in feathering and to lack the elegant form and sleek appearance

of the Violetear. Thus, while it is an extremely beautiful bird and worth-
while proposition in the aviary, it seldom does well on the show bench and
I have never seen it win a major award.
A very fine ecological study of the Violetear and three other estrildines,
dealing with the population, breeding and food of these birds in the wild
state was undertaken by David M. Skead from 1967 to 1970 and the collated
results were published in 1975. This fine publication elucidates many points
about the Violetear, Melba, Blue Waxbill and Blackcheek, and I make
frequent reference to it.
Housing
Most South African breedings of the Violetear occur in large garden
type aviaries, and the bigger the aviary the better, providing it is well
sheltered and warm and the birds have plenty of scope for getting out of the
wind, the cold and the wet, inveterate enemies of the Violetear. It is impor-
tant to remember that the Violetear hails from the western side of the
continent where it is hot and, most important, fairly dry; thus well shelter-
ed, warm, dry aviary conditions are essential. Cold, rainy weather very
soon has an adverse effect on these birds and they become puffed and
miserable.
Strachan {lx.) claimed that 4m x 2m x 2m was sufficient aviary space for
a breeding pair of Violetears. It was in an aviary of roughly those dimen-
sions that I was successful, but then they were the only occupants. If the
garden type aviary is large enough for different pairs of Violetears to take up
a territory, more than one pair can be kept in the one enclosure. It was under
such conditions that the 1976 successes by Steyn and Mare were achieved.

A point to emerge from Skead's study is that whereas the Melba and
blue waxbills are ground feeders, the Violetear is less so and frequently feeds
on a standing crop of grass seeds before the seeds fall to the ground,
hanging upside down to reach the seeds or leaning forward to take hold of a
seeding head, draw it up to its perch and tuck it under its foot before feed-
ing on the seeds. Thus it can be inferred that in captivity it would prefer
feeding off spray millet to eating seed out of a dish. Skead gives the
nestlings 5 diet as unripe grass seeds which are in the milky stage, and
termites. In the wild state the breeding peak occurs one or two months
after the peak rainfall when grass inflorescences are abundant in the veld and
termite foraging is at its peak. i.e. January to May. Is it not significant that
accounts of specific successes in breeding the Violetear and Purple Grena-
dier in the Magazine by Drake (1936), Boosey (1958) and Richards (1966)
all mention spray millet, seeding grass heads and termites (or live ant
cocoons in England). Strachan mentioned these items, though added that
his aviary-bred birds came to prefer mealworms. I used them exclusively

when I reared the Violetear and no doubt most other breedings occur
when grass seeds in the green, milky stage and termites or some substitute
live food are freely available.
These foods are not easy to provide all the year round, especially for the
city dweller, and so many substitute foods are brought into use. It is diffi-
cult to get Violetears onto them, but here the real skill of the aviculturist
comes into play. The advantage of the garden type aviary is that the birds
will be able to get a variety of insects from the natural vegetation. The
value of a well watered, frequently turned compost heap in an aviary has
often been apparent to me. Mealworms, maggots or fruit flies can be used
if the birds can be accustomed to take them. A regular vitamin additive to
the water is recommended. A nectar mixture is often popular with Violet-
ears and of inestimable value. A wide variety of the conventional seeds and
greenfoods, egg food, proprietary insectile and softfood mixtures, bread
and milk, wheat germ and the like can all be tried, the main problem being
as I say, to get the Violetears to accept these foods. The wider the diet the
better, and the perseverance and ingenuity of the keepers usually determine
success or failure. It has often been noted in South African aviaries that
certain Violetears come to depend on termites exclusively and that such
specimens die within a short time. I do not think termites should be slated
as a food, but rather that the importance of having Violetears on as varied a
diet as possible should be stressed.
Nesting
In the wilds the mean height of the nest above ground is given as a little
over a metre. This comparatively low nest-builder is in this respect fully at
home in our aviaries, and will readily go to nest in a bush or clump of
bracken or twigs fixed up under shelter. Steyn's Violetears nested on the
ground in a clump of grass and Strachan found that they preferred a
clipped privet bush to anything else. The nest is the usual globular
structure of grass and the softer pieces, particularly the inflorescences are
favoured for nest building. Skead saw the Violetear collecting feathers for
nest lining in the wild state, and my breeding pair made extensive use of
cotton wool for this purpose.
Most keepers of this species find that they are only too willing to go to
nest and lay a clutch of eggs, usually four. They seem very willing parents
and sit dutifully, their long tails becoming bent. It is when the babies
hatch that the process often breaks down, which indicates that an adequate
diet for rearing offspring is the major problem in captivity. Another point to
remember is that pair formation takes place when birds are still subadult
and the pair bond is strong and maintained for life. Thus it is necessary to
have a compatible pair and one does well to purchase several and try to
select a cock and a hen that fancy each other to form a breeding pair and
then never separate them. I have always found them difficult to remate and

often, when one of a pair died, the other soon followed suit.
Juvenile and subadult plumage
I kept detailed notes on the colouring up of a young male I bred, which
left the nest of 15th Feb., when its entire head and breast were a very light
biscuit colour (lighter than its mother's colour) and its wings and stumpy
tail a contrasting darker greyish-brown. The only adult colour on it was the
dull cobalt rump. The cheek patches seemed to be marked out in a lighter
shade of fawn than the head and breast. It was extremely steady and had a
dull black beak, small phosphorescent spots at the side of its mouth and
lovely large black eyes. The good photograph of two baby Purple Grena-
diers by Brooksbank (A.M. Vol. 64. p. 166) at once recalled my baby
Violetear to me, and I should imagine that the very young babies of the two
would probably be indistinguishable.
The colouring up of my nestling more or less followed the pattern
quoted by Skead. This process is obviously subject to variation: the first
development was the rapid lengthening of the tail. On the 12th day after
leaving the nest the baby was eating the fresh green seeds from grass
inflorescences, but was still begging its mother to be fed. By the 21st day
its tail was full length and the light fawn colour on the head and under-
parts seemed to be growing deeper in tone. On the 22nd day I noted that
the beak was turning red from the base and a black spot had appeared on
the chin. Steyn says that this black chin is always the first bit of adult
colour to appear on a Violetear and it did, of course, show that my nestling
was male. Two days later it showed the beginnings of the violet cheek
patches and a small spot of brown on the head. On the 27th day the outline
of the blue patch on the forehead was also clearly visible, the violet cheeks
well developed and the black chin most prominent of all. It also began to
produce the attractive song of the Violetear, which it did not learn by
imitation because its father had died by flying into a concrete block two
days after it left the nest. On the 41st day the cheek patches had gradually
darkened to a deeper tone than those of the mother and patches of brown
were just beginning to show on the breast. At three months nearly a half of
the adult brown colour had developed, but then the colouring process
seemed to become static, and remained so through the winter. Then quite
suddenly in September when the bird was about 10 months old it went into
a heavy moult and fully coloured up almost overnight. It is the idea of
Nicolai that the partial moult involving the violet, blue and black colour
areas of the adult has evolved in response to selection pressure toward
early pair formation and subsequent lifelong pair bond.
This young male seemed to pair up with its widowed mother when only
partly coloured. They produced several nests of eggs and he diligently
shared in the incubation, but the eggs were infertile, so possibly, they can-
not breed in juvenile plumage and commence breeding when about a year
old (i.e. in the following season to the one in which they are born).

Aggression

<bodyText confidence="0.987922558139535" page_id="56386328"  page_num="8" year="" vol="">
From as long ago as Reginald Phillipps (1906,1907), authors, in touching
upon the Violetear, if they know what they are talking about, warn about
the aggressive nature of the species. Phillipps found that even an odd cock
in a large aviary persecuted a wide variety of the other inmates and killed a
cock Cuban Finch. Later he experienced the brutal murder of one
Violetear cock by another. As I read his account too late, his is an experi-
ence I have shared. However, normally the pugnacity of the Violetear is
reserved for its own species, and it is courting disaster to house two pairs in
any moderately sized aviary. In the very large garden type aviary two or
even more pairs can be kept because each pair will be able to defend its own
territory. The pugnacity of these birds can be very deceptive: two pairs in
a small aviary will appear to get on perfectly for months, but then if one of
the cocks feels he has got the edge on the other in strength or perhaps one
pair feels like going to nest, there will be sudden fierce and often fatal
fighting.
It is usual here to see Violetears housed in mixed collections and I tried
keeping pairs of them and Purple Grenadiers in the same aviary, but had to
separate them because the males would have fought to the death. Shillinglaw
(pers. comm.) says that the Purple Grenadier is not as aggressive as the
Violetear in an aviary.
Longevity
Through the years I have kept eight pairs of Violetears and one pair of
Purple Grenadiers and have accurate records on them. The life spans of the
males average 15 months and of females only 9.3 months: thus it seems that
hens are more delicate than cocks. Shillinglaw says that with Purple
Grenadiers the hens are certainly the weaker sex. The longest life span of a
Violetear in my experience was a little over 2 J years, but Shillinglaw had a
male Purple Grenadier that lived for over ten years. Over half my birds
suffered some accidental death from night frights, several went into decline,
especially in cold wet weather; others contracted enteritis that I could not
cure and one hen died from egg-binding.
There seems to be evidence that Violetears are rather short-lived in the
wild state. The study of the Violet-eared WaxbilPs population dynamics
was the prime object of Skead's ecological studies and he carried out ex-
tensive ringing and trapping in mist nets, giving interesting tables of the
results, his "lapse rate" tables being particularly interesting. He found that
80 per cent of the juveniles disappear within the first year, 96 per cent have
disappeared by the end of the second year and the remaining 4 per cent by
the end of the third, but, of course, some may have strayed. He also found
that a higher percentage of males was re-trapped suggesting that either
they are more sedentary of that they suffer a lower mortality rate than the
females.
I would think the latter conclusion correct, though in the natural state

there must somehow come an evening up of the sexes, because Skead also
found an almost equal adult sex ratio of females to males.
The possibility of founding an aviary-bred strain
Until a species is bred so extensively that the stock is viable without the
constant addition of wild-caught specimens, it cannot be considered a real
success in aviculture. We shall have to concentrate far more on building up
aviary-bred stocks in the future. It is, of course, necessary for aviculturists
to concentrate on a few species in order to achieve this end, rather than
merely amass collections as has far too often been the approach in the past.
Can this idyllic state be achieved with the Violetear is the question.
In South Africa there is no one concentrating on this species at the
present time and, as it is freely available, there is hardly the incentive to do
so. The position with the Purple Grenadier is rather different and for many
years a concerted effort to build up an aviary-bred strain of this bird has
been made by Shillinglaw. From an excellent breeding pair he produced 11
offspring in 1966, but despite further minor successes, the stock virtually
died out. He summarises the reasons for his failure as follows :-(i) a
preponderance of cocks among the nestlings that reached adulthood and
the delicacy of hens; (2) the total lack of success in getting the original cock
to accept another mate after the death of his hen and (3) the unavoidable
necessity, because Grenadiers were unobtainable in South Africa, of
mating brother to sister, resulting in curiously weak youngsters of which
only one ever survived to maturity, indicating that the genetic pool avail-
able (subsequently only one unrelated hen was successfully introduced)
was just too limited for the successful establishment of the stock. On the
credit side Shillinglaw found the Purple Grenadier less dependent on
termites than the Violetear and reared nearly 20 of them on a diet of seed-
ing grass heads (Erigrostis spp.), termites and bread and water. The
youngsters appeared quite as good as the wild-caught birds. Recently
Shillinglaw has managed to acquire two newly imported pairs of Purple
Grenadiers and, the last surviving males from his previous breeding
experiment being still alive, he hopes to succeed and we wish him good
luck with the venture.
I would definitely say that the Violetear is marginally the more difficult
to handle, its only advantage being a wider natural distribution. In a country
like Australia, or perhaps parts of U.S.A., where avicultural expertise is
high, the warm climate very suitable for aviculture, the incentive to re-
produce the species very great and supplies of termites freely available, such
an experiment might work. It would be more difficult in Europe or most
parts of North America. Considering the difficulties facing such a venture, I
admit that if I were to hear of any person with a viable aviary-bred stock of
Violetears I should be very, very surprised, but I hope I am wrong in my
pessimism. Both still appear from time to time on the European market,
presumably emanating from the surrounding African territories and not

from South Africa, where restrictions have long been severe, but these
supplies may well cease in time to come.
Hybrids.
Not surprisingly, cross-breeding is seldom encountered with the
Violetear, the most likely cross being with the Purple Grenadier. In 1965
Canon J. R. Lowe bred the Purple Grenadier x Violetear cross and this was
well documented in the Magazine (Vol 71 p.172).
In South Africa hybridisation has occurred with two other species. The
Violetear x Blue-breasted Waxbill was bred by Page (1954) of Potchef-
stroom in 1952. He described how he noticed a Violetear cock chasing a
Blue-breasted Waxbill hen, whose mate he at once removed so as to
leave her to the Violetear, and after some setbacks produced four crosses,
three cocks and one hen. These were bought by two keen fanciers from the
Blyvooruitzicht Mine, 50 miles west of Johannesburg, and they exhibited
the males on all the Transvaal shows of 1954/553 repeatedly winning the
major award. These hybrids had more the size, shape and colour of the
Blue-breasted Waxbill mother, though their tails were markedly longer
and fuller like that of the Violet-eared father. Face, throat and rump were
a rich cobalt or royal blue, far deeper than the blue of the blue waxbills;
crown nape and wings were a very deep olive-brown and the tail almost
black. Personally I did not consider them quite as beautiful as either of the
parents, but they were always exhibited in such immaculate condition and
their feathering and colouring were always so smooth and solid that they
made an irresistible appeal to every judge under whom they came. I visited
the aviaries of Grant and viewed all four. The hen was generally paler,
rather like a Violetear hen with overspilled blue cheek patches.
These hybrids never bred and I doubt they were given much encourage-
ment. It would be valuable to know whether they were fertile or not, as
throwing light on the question of the proximity in relationship of the
Violetear to the blue waxbills and the wisdom of the decision to combine
Granatina and Uraeginthus in the single genus Uraeginthus.
Like the parent species, these hybrids proved not to be long lived: my
collection of show catalogues shows that in 1956 the famous hybrid had
disappeared from the bench.
I never thought to see such a hybrid again, but on the South African
National Championship Show held in Durban in 1967 K.W. Cross of
Pietermaritzburg won the medal for best hybrid with what he described as
a Blue-breasted Waxbill x Violeteared hybrid, so presumably the same
combination was obtained the other way round. The appearance of this
bird was virtually the same as the specimens I had seen over a decade
earlier, but I fancied that it was, if anything, a trifle more dusky in colour.
This hybrid certainly caused quite a stir again.
A far greater sensation was caused by the appearance of a Melba x Violet-
ear hybrid in 1958, when it was exhibited by Carl Ballack in the club show

of the Transvaal Avicultural Society. Presumably a male, it had reddish
facial markings half way between the cheek patches of the Violetear and the
red mask on the face of the Melba. Its body colour was fawnish-grey, very
lightly spangled as in the Melba: the wings and back were a sandy brown.
In shape it much resembled the Violetear, especially with regard to its
long tail and short, neat beak, although this did show a certain amount of
elongation. In general appearance it resembled nothing quite so much as a
Crimson Finch hen Neochmia phaeton, a sight most of us knew then, but
now, alas, practically unknown outside Australia. This very interesting and
attractive hybrid lived out its rather short life in Ballack's large garden
aviary. A coloured plate of a pair of Violet-eared Waxbills, by H. Gronvold,
appeared in the August 1906 number of the Magazine and the September-
October 1943 number contained one of a pair of Roosevelt's Purple
Grenadier Waxbills by Roland Green.

HAND-REARING MEYER'S AND IRIS LORIKEETS

By Rosemary Low (Barnet, Herts)
In 1973 we obtained nine newly imported Meyer's Lorikeets Tricho-
glossus (Fsitteuteles) flavoviridis meyeri which first attempted to nest at the
beginning of 1975. Their unsuccessful attempts were described in the
Magazine Jan-March 1976, p.n. This year, because my husband's
office moved to within a short distance of our home, hand-rearing was
possible for the first time and we decided to hand-rear any chicks which
the Meyer's might hatch.
In November 1975 a pair of Iris Lorikeets (a small and extremely pretty
species from Timor) which had been in an outdoor aviary for only two
months, hatched two chicks. They survived three weeks of cold weather,
including freezing fog, before succumbing. The pair nested again and
hatched two chicks at the beginning of February. We decided to try to
hand-rear them, as the weather was again very cold with below freezing
temperatures. On February 7th, when the chicks were, I believe, aged six
and eight days, I removed them from the nest. The incubator had been
plugged in and was set at 95*F. (35 *C.).
One soon becomes blase about hand-rearing but I must admit to a sink-
ing feeling and much apprehension when I robbed the Iris's nest of two
tiny, pink-skinned chicks, sparsely covered with longish white down.
Their eyes were closed and their beaks seemed minute. There was very
little food in their crops when they were placed straight into the incubator
in a small cardboard box on a bed of paper tissues.
At San Diego Zoo, where the breeding successes with lories far out-
number those of any other zoo or private individual, a spoon with the sides
bent inwards is used to feed the baby parrots, including lories, which are
hand-reared. K. C. Lint, former Curator of Birds, believes that the use of a
syringe introduces the danger of food entering the wind-pipe. My husband
had therefore bent the sides of a teaspoon towards its centre and it was
with this spoon that we attempted to give the first feed to the Iris chicks.
The food consisted of the nectar mixture fed to the parents, thickened
with additional baby cereal (Farex). The chicks refused to take it, but I
realised immediately that this was because the spoon was cold (subsequently
I used the spoon to stir the food while it was being heated) and the food was
not hot enough. These mistakes were rectified and the chicks were fed.
The younger, with egg-tooth still visible, did not feed quite so readily and
took air into its crop. Nevertheless, it was amazing to see such tiny chicks,
blind and naked, taking food from a spoon. I imagine that, in this respect,
lories must be the easiest of all parrots to hand-rear.
We soon discovered that the food needs to be extremely hot-- almost
boiling--and that as soon as it begins to cool, very young chicks refuse it. It

is therefore necessary to re-heat the food if there is more than one chick to
feed.
There was initial difficulty in regulating the incubator and the chicks
yelled their protest when the thermometer showed ioo*F. (3y.y*C). They
felt too hot to the touch and were panting: by late evening the incubator
had been adjusted at 91*F. (32.y*C). On the first day feeds were given at
approximately two hour intervals between 4 pm and 11 pm. On the
following day the first feed was at 3 am, then at y.30 am and then two
hourly or hourly until 1045 pm. In 24 hours the chicks had become much
stronger, pumping against the warm spoon and gulping vigorously. The
youngest was still slightly less easy to feed and would only take food readily
when it was very hot.
On the following day the elder chick still had food in its crop at 11 pm,
following the 9 pm feed: its skin was very dark red and its fluff looked dry.
When I got up at 6 am the following morning it was obvious that this chick
was dying; there was still food in its crop, but it died at 9 am and autopsy
showed that it had fatty degeneration of the liver, thus explaining the
reason for the full crop. It was a female and at the time of its death it
weighed yg. The surviving chick was active and noisy and seemed well. The
food was changed to Farex and glucose only. By February 13th, when
probably 12 days old, the egg-tooth had disappeared.
On Sunday February 15th I took from the nest box of a pair of Meyer's
Lorikeets two chicks which had hatched at about the same time as the Iris
Lorikeet chicks. Previously I had only heard them and was surprised by
their clean, compact, solid appearance in comparison with the surviving
Iris chick. However, they were so cold, hungry and weak that they could
not hold their heads up. It seemed that I had almost left their removal too
late, but in a short time they were very much stronger.
On the following day the second Iris chick died, after deteriorating
rapidly. Post mortem examination showed that it, too, had suffered fatty
degeneration of the liver. It was therefore necessary to think very carefully
about the diet if the Meyer's chicks were to survive. I searched all my
notes and correspondence on breeding small lories and, in a letter from
Kerry Muller, Curator at Taronga Zoo, Sydney (formerly of San Diego
Zoo), I came across something which I should have absorbed at the time of
receipt. He had written: a Our earlier diet included the cereal Farex, and
at the time no milk powder was added. We found that the birds developed
dry and frayed feathers and became easily overweight. This was caused by
a deficiency in sulphur-containing amino acids, which was rectified by
adding the milk powder."
I then realised that the carbohydrate content of Farex--72 per cent--was
far too high. Carbohydrate is stored by the liver until it can store no more,
when the liver ceases to function--thus the Iris chicks had died. It was
therefore vital to change the diet of the Meyer's chicks at once, and provide
one containing very much less carbohydrate. Thenceforth the nectar

consisted of approximately equal parts of Casilan (90 per cent protein milk
food), ordinary dried milk powder, Bemax wheat germ cereal and a smaller
amount of Gevral (used for feeding hummingbirds). The Bemax was placed
in a grinder to reduce it to a fine powder, water was added and the mixture
was heated. After heating, a small amount of Vionate (vitamin/mineral
additive) was added to the food once daily. They took this without hesita-
tion--I believe that they would take anything that was hot and of the
correct consistency (that of cream, not porridge). On the 16th I was worried
that their eyes had closed but by the evening they had reopened. I learned
later that chicks' eyes may close several times before they remain open.
When the chicks were removed from the nest, the feather development
was far more advanced in the elder one; the younger had no down at all. By
the 20th the younger showed a few rows of feather tracts and white rows of
feathers were appearing on the head; in the elder chick more rows of
feathers were apparent. On February 24th they were weighed in a rather
unscientific manner, using letter scales: if and 1 oz.
Feather growth continued at a remarkable rate and on the following day
green and yellow feathers were "opening" on the underparts of both
chicks. They were more noticeable on the younger chick which still had no
down but its contour feathers were at the same stage of development. By
this time their feet were perfect replicas of the adults' and almost as large.
On February 26th they weighed if and 1 oz.
On March 2nd the whole heads of both chicks were covered in pin
feathers, whereas two days previously only the forehead and front part of
the crown, like a dark cap, had pin feathers. By this time they squawked if
disturbed when sleeping. On February 29th they had been moved from the
incubator to a heated cage with a glass front which measured 18 in (46 cm) x
11 in (28 cm) x 15 in (38 cm) high. They were compulsive viewing--"More
interesting than the television", a friend remarked. Some of their sleeping
attitudes were amusing, especially that in which they lay down with their
legs stretched full out behind them. Sometimes they would sleep standing
up, gradually leaning forwards until they fell over!
A week previously, as soon as feathers had started to appear, they could
be seen preening themselves and by that age they were less noisy and had
ceased to call loudly. On March 2nd I saw the elder chick exercising his
wings. After a feed they would immediately clean each other's beaks;
sometimes we allowed them to feed from the spoon at the same time, but
such feeding sessions became chaotic and generally the chicks were fed in
turn. At that age the younger chick was more adventurous and cheeky.
On March 3rd the chicks weighed iff- and if oz. By the following day
the primary quills of the elder chick were nearly 1 in (2.5 cm) long. The
feathers of the abdomen were approximately J in (0.8 cm) long in both
chicks and the feathers of the underparts, including the thighs, were the
most developed, with dark green feathers of the upperparts just coming
through. By March 10th the chicks were completely covered and the

rectrices of the elder were about # in (6mm) long but were not apparent in
the younger chick: most of the head feathers were out of the quills. At this
age the chicks were becoming very aware of what was going on and if one
was left inside the cage while the other was being fed, it would run up and
down impatiently watching and waiting its turn. They weighed 2 oz and
i#f oz.
By March 14th the rectrices of the elder chick were about J in (1.9 cm)
long; those of the younger were slightly shorter, and the only pin feathers
remaining were those of the throat. It had become necessary to clean the
feathers at the sides of the beak with damp cotton wool to prevent food
drying hard on them. The chicks were gradually becoming vocal and
making their first attempts at short call notes. Their body size appeared to
be equal to that of an adult and on March tyth they weighed 2 \ oz and 2 oz.
Before they were a month old, we felt sure that the chicks were a male
and female; the elder one was noticeably broader in the upper mandible,
head and body; however, as they feathered it became apparent that there
was also a difference in the head coloration. The believed male had the
forehead and most of the crown golden-yellow, whereas in the believed
female the forehead was lemon-yellow and the rest of the top of the crown
was green. When I examined the parents I found that this also applied to
them, but the difference was far less pronounced. By March 27th they
would venture out of the cage when called which, I suppose, was the
equivalent to fledging as they were then eight weeks old, at which age
comparable small lories fledge. They differed from the adults, apart from
the point already mentioned, in the dark brown beaks and dark eyes,
typical of all young lories, also in the less well defined barring on the
underparts.
On March 27th they proved very difficult to feed, shaking their heads as
though in disgust after taking only a small amount of food. Previously the
elder chick had never refused food, even when its crop was bulging. By
the following day it was evident that they would no longer take the food on
which they had been reared. When I offered them some trifle sponge and
nectar, slightly heated, they took it greedily, not pausing for breath until I
removed them with bulging crops. On the following day the sponge cake
was omitted as they were only taking nectar. For several days they had been
attempting to feed themselves in an experimental fashion, just as they now
tasted every kind of surface with their brush-tipped tongues. A small
shallow dish of nectar was therefore left in the cage and they were occasion-
ally seen to lap at it. They became increasingly difficult to feed, yet their
crops never seemed to contain much food.
On April 3rd both chicks flew strongly about the room; they had dis-
covered the use of their wings after falling off the table, which exercise
they repeated several times--just for the fun of it! On April 6th they proved
impossible to feed; when removed from the cage they rushed about play-
fully, completely ignoring their food. However, later that day I saw them

feeding well. They were weaned at last--aged 9J weeks. Thenceforth they
were offered nectar and, on occasions, a more diluted form of the rearing
food. Date and apple were nibbled at; also spray millet.
After a few days their eye colour had changed to resemble that of the
adults. By mid-April the believed male had been seen making tentative
attempts to display. In June they moulted into adult plumage and the
difference in the head coloration was then less apparent. On August 22nd
they were moved from their cage indoors to a small outdoor aviary, where
they have proved to be the most active and playful birds imaginable.
They spent much time foraging on the floor of the aviary in the sunflower
seed which has sprouted during the wet weather. Their diet is almost the
same as that of the adults, but they ignore millet spray.
The adult pairs laid numerous clutches throughout the year, including
during September, after the moult. At the beginning of April, the parents
of the hand-reared chicks hatched two more chicks which lived for two to
three weeks. Unfortunately, we were unable to remove them for hand-
rearing as we went on holiday at the end of April. On more than one other
occasion a chick or chicks were hatched but died before they were old
enough to be removed. It seems probable that some of the eggs were
deserted before the end of the incubation period. Because of the small size
of their enclosures--only 3 ft (91 cm) square and 6 ft (1.8 m) high, nest
inspection causes some disturbance and is not usually carried out, thus the
fate of some of the clutches cannot be recorded. This is far from a desirable
state of affairs and arises, it must be admitted, from the fault common to
most aviculturists of keeping too many birds. In larger aviaries nest inspec-
tion would cause no problem.
I believe that the Meyer's Lorikeet has not previously been bred in
Britain: however, it would seem that these little birds nest as readily as
lovebirds, laying continuously.
The pair of Iris Lorikeets whose two chicks had died as a result of our
first attempt at hand-rearing, hatched another chick, which was first heard
on May 15th but it had hatched several days previously, while we were on
holiday, and was then a week old. There was no sign of a second egg, so
possibly a second chick had hatched and died. The chick had no food in its
crop and proved extremely difficult to feed for the first 24 hours. After this
initial difficulty it took food readily but feeding was not always easy; it was
far more active than the Meyer's chicks and was never still for a second
when removed for feeding. Its eyes opened on about May 22nd, had closed
again six days later and opened fully on May 31st. On the latter date small
green feathers were apparent on its breast.
It had been moved to the heated cage on May 29th because, in the space
of an hour.; it had climbed into the wires of the incubator roof on two occa-
sions, which could easily have led to its death. At this stage it was covered
with dense light grey down--in complete contrast to the Meyer's chicks
which had wispy white down. By June 4th the yellowish-green feathers on

the breast were almost \ in (13 mm) long and dark red quills were appear-
ing on the forehead: its beak was black. By June 8th the secondaries were
about in (8 mm) long and the upper breast was half-covered with
feathers. The red feathers on the forehead were just breaking through; also
the tail feathers.
On June 29th it was moved from the heated cage to a small cage. The
weather was very hot at the time, so the problem of gradually lowering the
temperature did not arise. On that day it drank nectar from a tube imme-
diately it was placed in the cage, although it had never previously seen
that type of drinker. Weaning was a far more gradual process than with
the Meyer's Lorikeets; I continued to feed it for a couple of weeks, yet
during this period it was feeding itself.
It had early been apparent by its build that this youngster was a male; in
immature plumage it showed the mauve crown of some male Iris Lorikeets.
Its father, however, has the crown green. On August 24th the first green
feather appeared on the crown and by mid-September the crown was
almost entirely green, tinged with mauve; thus adult plumage was attained
just after the age of four months. On September 12th it was seen hissing in
display for the first time.
This little bird possesses a will and determination out of all proportion to
its size. We often let it out and it delights in flying backwards and forwards
between my husband and me, our heads being its favourite perching place.
It careers around the room in excited zig-zag flight, diving low, just out of
reach of our dog. It is quite the most inquisitive, bold, excitable and lovable
bird imaginable, chattering and playing by itself for hours on end. When
housed with an adult male Iris Lorikeet for company, it bullied the adult
bird so badly that it had to be removed! A hand-reared lorikeet is indeed the
most delightful pet imaginable, but it is our intention to eventually use this
little character for breeding, especially as he will eat positively any item of
food offered!
Unlike the Meyer's Lorikeets, the Iris are not "continuous" layers, i.e.
an unsuccessful clutch is followed by the next clutch after an interval of
two months. The mother of the hand-reared youngster laid two more
clutches, the dates of the first eggs being approximately June 21st and
August 18th. None of these eggs hatched, yet all the eggs laid during the
coldest winter months hatched. Perhaps we can look forward to hand-
rearing some more chicks during the winter. It is a time-consuming task
but a most fascinating one.

SMALL OWLS IN AVIARIES

By Wolfgang Scherzinger (Waldhauser, West Germany)
After studying the European Pygmy Owl Glaucidium passerinum
thoroughly in the wild and having repeatedly bred this species in captivity.,
my next aim was to gain insight into the courtship and breeding behaviour
of further representatives of the genus Glaucidium" Up to the present,
I have kept five species of these small owls and G. passerinum, G. brasilianum
and G. perlatum have bred successfully, whereas of the larger species
G. cuculoides laid infertile eggs and G. radiatum got no further than
courtship and nest preparation.
Four factors appear to me to be of particular importance for successful
breeding:
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.964685153846154" page_id="56386340"  page_num="18" year="" vol="">
1. During the breeding season the small owls can be very aggressive and
will pursue each other, so they require relatively large aviaries. As far as
possible, I provided them with aviaries of 2 x 4 to 3 x 6 m. floor space.
2. It is advisable to offer a wide choice of nest boxes and hollow trees
so that, on the one hand the female has a variety to choose from, and on
the other the male can find refuge from attacks by his mate. Some species
have a clear preference for natural tree hollows or holes that have been
made by woodpeckers.
3. Breeding success is dependent on the quality of the diet. The smallest
owls appear to be the most sensitive, so it is best to feed them on freshly
killed mice. The larger species do accept day-old chicks, but deep frozen
food should never be given during the incubation period.
4. Light, sunshine and rain are essential for the owls* well-being, so that
</listItem>

breeding in open outdoor aviaries is the most successful.
As my aviaries are at an altitude of 1,000 m. above sea level, in the raw
climate of the Bavarian Forest, the owls, with the exception of passerinum,
must overwinter in light indoor accommodation with a minimum tempera-
ture of o degrees C. and the exotic species usually require one or two years
before their breeding cycle harmonises with our seasons. In all species
the courtship calls begin sporadically to be made in autumn, becoming
intensive in January and February. As soon as the owls are moved into
the outdoor aviaries in April they start inspecting and cleaning out the
nesting holes.
European pygmy owl Glaucidium passerinum is a native of the mountainous
parts of Central Europe and Scandinavia. My birds were first heard to
make the monotonous "dju dju** call in January and the first copulation
was observed in the middle of February, though more usually at the
beginning of March. Only woodpecker holes of the size made by Dendro -
copus major were accepted and egg-laying began on March 10th at the
earliest and the middle of April at the latest--that is a good month earlier

than in the wild state. The data of the most recent broods showed that the
clutches were of six, seven and eight eggs, and the eggs were laid at
intervals of two to three days. In extremely cold weather the female
remained on the eggs, but began proper incubation only after the last
was laid. After 28-30 days' incubation the young hatched at short intervals,
often more or less simultaneously and hatching took place at the earliest
on April 4th and at the latest on May 5th, the young leaving the nest a
month later.
Brazilian pygmy OWL Glaucidium brasilianum is a native of the forested
areas of Central and tropical South America. My birds uttered a series of
identical whistles, presumably territorial song, from mid-January and
even at this period began preparing the nest. Usually, both sexes could be
heard inside the nest box, scratching and flapping their wings noisily, and
the first observed mating was on March 24th. Although the birds had the
choice of different kinds of natural hollow logs, the female chose the nest
box that she knew from the winter quarters--horizontal with 30 x 15 cm.
floor area and 20 cm. high--and in this the first of five eggs was laid on
April 10th, but in spite of close incubation from the laying of the fourth
egg the embryos died during a cold spell at the beginning of May.
To my great pleasure, 20 days after the removal of the first clutch a
second of four eggs was begun, the first chick hatching after an incubation
period of 30 days on July 3rd and 28 days later three young birds left the
nest.
pearl-spotted owlet Glaucidium perlatum inhabits parts of Africa. The
song of my birds could be heard all through the winter. It consists of a
sequence of single fluting whistles, and when excited this owl also emits
a shrill rising glissando which ebbs away in a long sequence of low warning
calls. As a nesting place the birds chose a rotten tree trunk riddled with
holes and another time a pine trunk with a woodpecker's nesting hole in
it. The nest boxes made of boards were only used to conceal food.
Inspection of the nest and copulation were first seen on April 15th at the
earliest. The first egg in 1975 was laid on May nth; in 1976 on May 1st,
the clutches consisting of three and four eggs. In 1976 the female spent
a lot of time in the nest from the laying of the first egg, but in 1975 she
did not start to incubate until four days after the laying of the last one.
The chicks hatched at short intervals after approximately 29 days of
incubation--on June 22nd in 1975 and on May 30th in 1976--and they
remained for about 28 days in the nest.

forested parts of Southern Asia, and in my aviaries the courtship behaviour
has been more conspicuous and noisy in autumn than in spring. The

Little Owl, but more purling trills and rattling "xylophone" sequences
are to be heard. Against rivals it utters a barking "gu-kuck gu-kuck" from
which the scientific name is probably derived. These owls chose a hori-
zontally placed nest box of 40 x 20 cm. floor space and 25 cm. high in
which they had already scraped a nest hollow in autumn. The first mating
was observed on April 13th and the first egg was laid on April 28th, the
clutch consisting of five eggs. From the laying of the first egg the female
remained in the nest, sitting tightly, and the male brought food into her.
Unfortunately, all the eggs proved to be infertile, and I removed them after
37 days of incubation.
jungle owlet Glaucidium radiatum lives in the forests of India and is
very similar in appearance to the Cuckoo Owl. Its song consists of a
succession of vigorous trills which rise in a crescendo and fall. I was least
successful with this species, and this may have been due to the fact that
I was only temporarily able to keep them in an outdoor aviary. The owls
called continuously from the beginning of February. If a rival was imitated
by the playing back of their own recorded calls, the birds uttered a series
of harsh angry cries--"pi ju-ku kutt, ku kutt". They chose a roomy nest
box made of boards (25 cm. high and 50 x 20 cm. floor space) from which,
from February 20th, they tore the insulation sheets from the walls and
threw them, together with the litter, through the entrance hole. Copulation
took place from April nth occasionally, but no eggs were laid.
The three small species passerinum , brasilianum and perlatum are
outwardly very similar, in spite of their different origins. If the stages of
development of their young are compared, they will be found to differ
only in a few details. All owls are hatched with closed eyes; brasilianum
and perlatum open them to slits on the fourth or fifth day and completely
from the seventh; G. passerinum opens them slightly on the eighth day
and completely on the ninth. Begging cries of passerinum sound like "siit",
perlatum like "fietch", and brasilianum utters a hurried chirp. The nestling
plumage develops from the white down on the fifth day in brasilianum and
perlatum and the eighth day in the case of passerinum. In passerinum this
is chocolate-brown and relatively smooth; in brasilianum it is dull dark
brown and not very downy, and in perlatum it is light brown, thick and
fluffy. Further, the young of passerinum and perlatum have conspicuous
broad white markings on the face and perlatum has rows of white markings
on the shoulders. With the juvenile moult in the autumn the young develop
their typical spots and wavy bar markings on the head (2J months for
passerinum , three months for perlatum and four months for brasilianum).
If taken from the nest, the young of brasilianum will climb upwards
through branches with the help of beak, wings and feet. This behaviour
is less marked in perlatum , and the use of the beak when climbing is
completely lacking in young passerinum. The owls can perch from the
17th day ( brasilianum and perlatum) and the 25th day in the case of

passerinum . All these species leave the nesting hole after 28-30 days and
can fly strongly at this age. Whereas passerinum from then on sleeps out
of doors, the young of brasilianum and perlatum return to the nest every
evening.
From these comparisons it can be inferred that G. passerinum is the
most closely dependent on an intact woodpecker nest hole where the
young can grow well protected and with no need of complete locomotion
until they are ready to fly. As regards their physical capabilities, the
young of the other two species develop quicker. Their young are hatched
in very diversely protected nesting sites and they therefore require a
thicker downy plumage for warmth than does passerinum , although this
owl lives in considerably harsher climatic zones.

the Yellow-cheeked Conure that I bought in June 1976 is one of two that
were imported separately in 1965. Its history during the intervening eleven
years is quite unknown; although, from its reluctance to fly and because it
"talks", I suspect that it spent most of the time in a cage. I wonder whether
the other Yellow-cheeked Conure is still alive? Should anyone know, of the
whereabouts of a second example, I would be pleased to hear from them, as
I would very much like to make an attempt to breed such an avicultural
rarity.
It is rather a fearless bird and when I put it in the small sheltered aviary
that houses my Spix's Macaw, it soon came to lord it over the food dishes
and so now it is kept on its own. Next spring I shall, if a mate is not
forthcoming, try to pair it to an odd Yellow-naped Macaw Ara auricollis.
Description
The Yellow-cheeked is a very large conure, being somewhat bigger than
a Hawk-headed Parrot: this example weighs 285 grams. For those with a
copy of Forshaw's parrots of the world it does have some differences
from the illustration by W. Cooper. Firstly this bird is nowhere so elegant,
because of the heavy body, head and bill, the slightly ruffled feathers
(Cooper almost invariably makes his South American parrots sleek-
feathered, which few are) and the shortish tail. His subject may have been

an immature, because in the old bird the bill is entirely black. The outer
ring of the iris is reddish-brown while the inner ring is dark brown; also
the yellow feathers of the cheeks are not lengthened and therefore do not
project backwards beyond the contours of the head. The peri-orbital skin
is coal black. For those without the benefit of Cooper's illustration, it may
be imagined as a very large dull-green conure that has a sap-green belly and
chest with a dull red underside to the shortish tail. The face and cheeks are
bright yellow and the feathers above the bill are slightly lengthened and
"furry" as they are in, say, a Military Macaw Ara militaris. It differs from
macaws in that, instead of the cheeks, it is the base of the lower mandible
that is bare of feathers. Had it a tapered tip to one of its outer primary
feathers, for this seems to be the sole distinction, it would very likely be
classified as an Aratinga conure; and had it a bald face it would be an
Ara macaw. Unfortunately it is just as consistently noisy as these two
genera of parrot, although its calls are not too strident to the ear.

The drawing, taken from Bob Grantham's coloured photograph, shows
the Yellow-cheeked Conure signalling attention to itself by shrugging its
wings. I have seen similar wing-shrugging in the Scarlet Macaw Ara
macao 5 Blue and Yellow Macaw A. ararauna 3 Spectacled Amazon Parrot
Amazona albifrons and the Black-headed Caique Pionites melanocephala.
Because the wing-shrugging of the caique is most usually accompanied by a
piping toot, it has been called "crowing" (Smith 1972). Wing-shrugging is,
only too obviously, derived from wing-stretching and may be peculiar to
New World parrots. When they were breeding, the cock of a pair of
Scarlet Macaws always silently lifted his wings when someone approached
the aviary: I never saw his hen do so. During the incubation he always
slipped protectively into the nesting hole to glare out at whoever it was near
to the aviary, and before entering, he invariably shrugged his wings. In one
pair of non-breeding Blue and Yellow Macaws the (assumed) male always
signals by wing-lifting to anyone approaching the aviary: the (assumed)
hen does this less frequently. Both sexes of the Spectacled Amazon also lift
their wings: in this species, as the wings are shrugged, the outermost part
of the wing of the males is twisted "inside out" so that the otherwise
completely hidden scarlet-coloured primary wing-coverts fairly shine out.
The scarlet feathers are found only in the male and this wing-shrugging
display takes place far more frequently in the summer, when they are
interested in nesting. Male caiques (I have not seen females do so) use
wing-lifting to signal their presence to others within hearing and view.
This is very contagious and soon all the male caiques begin to "crow".
My impression, gained from these examples, is that the shrugging of the
wings is exactly analogous to the way in which we raise a hand to someone
we recognize when we see them a little way off and with whom we do not
wish to converse--just an acknowledgement of recognition, although there

may be a mild threat involved in the case of the parrots.
This Yellow-cheeked Comire is extremely arboreal and I have not yet
seen it come down to the ground. His huge and very distructive bill can
crack hawthorn stones with no effort whatsoever. He (I take it that this is its
sex) has the usual threat-walk of American parrots, but with his head
lowered he will sometimes sway it from side to side alternately displaying
his yellow ear-coverts. The bare skin next to the lower mandible frequently
blushes pink under emotion; as does the bare face of the macaws.
The Dusky Parrot Pionus fuscus
It was only very rarely that Dusky Parrots were imported into the U.K.:
those few that have been (and I doubt that more than a score have arrived
in the past 30 years) were all hand-reared nestlings and remain endearingly
tame. This complete confidence in humans, the very gentle behaviour to-
wards each other--except when defending their nesting territory, and
then they are merciless--and the most gentle-sounding conversational
grunts and whistles which accompany their feeding make them especially
attractive. I had three; two were imported by Mr Clifford about four years
ago from Brazil and for most of these years they were in the possession of
Mr. Frank Waite who, since his illness, has had to part with some of his
collection. The other bird was imported from Guyana by Mrs. Stephanie
Belford in May 1975.
Description
The Dusky Parrot used to have the more euphonious, and certainly far
more appropriate, English name of Violet, or Violaceous, Parrot. By
coincidence the lory Pseudeos fuscata and this species have been given the
same Latin specific name fuscus which means that they are of a dark, or
dusky, colour. Nothing could be further from the case, for these two--the
Dusky Parrot and the Dusky Lory--are among the most strangely beauti-
fully-coloured of parrots.
The Dusky Parrot is slightly smaller than an African Grey Parrot
Psittacus erithacus but has a far neater, smaller head and bill. The average
weight of my three was 185 grams (183-187 grams). The splodges of black on
the group of white feathers covering the ear makes the bluish-grey head
very reminiscent of that of a falcon. The general body colouring is a
complex mixture of blue- and violet-greys. The feathers of the wing-
coverts have rosy margins and the pink breast is washed with purple. In
flight the "ink-dipped" flight feathers are a most attractive deep blue.
I know of extremely few illustrations of this bird: that by Lydon
(Greene 1884) is just recognisable. By far the most successful is a superb
watercolour by Goodchild in Bird Notes (1908); Boosey's plate (Tavistock
1926) is a good attempt; that of Paul Barreul (Haverschmidt 1968) makes
the bird too blue and the iris which is very dark, indeed almost black, is
incorrectly shown as brown. Even Cooper (Forshaw 1972), who is other-

wise such a superlative painter of parrots, does not get the correct pinkish
violet on the belly and the skin around the eye, instead of being sky-blue,
is shown as white. Those illustrations by Walter Papenfuss (de Grahl
1969-73) and by J. L. Albrecht Moller (1971) appear to have been com-
posed from description rather than from observation of living or museum
material.
Distribution
The Dusky Parrot has a somewhat curious distribution, for it is found in
the tropical rain forest on both sides of the River Amazon as far north as
the Orinoco River and to Marenhao 400 miles to the south of the Amazon:
it margins the Amazon for a thousand miles inland. To the north-east, in
the Sierra de Perija, isolated from the main mass by a thousand miles, lies
another small group. As the colour and patterning of almost every species
of parrot is very susceptible to mutation, so that subspecific plumage
differences usually arise when populations become geographically separ-
ated, it is strange that these two groups have no subspecific differences.
General behaviour
The three hens roost apart from one another. (In my Bronze-wings
P. chalcoptera the pair sit near to and sometimes actually touching during
the day but at night roost separately). The three very seldom preen one
another and this is borne out by their attitude too towards humans, for,
although fearless, they do not like to be stroked and if one persists in
doing so they may well bite. I loaned a tame hen to Peter Paris and he
reported that it was very difficult to introduce this bird to another because,
although sociable in neutral territory, they will attack should a stranger
innocently approach their roosting site. It is strange that these of mine are
hens and so, it seems, are the three owned by Peter Paris. Although seem-
ingly such placid creatures, they sometimes panic, when they fly with the
speed of an arrow.
Breeding
Two boxes were hung up in the shade of the shelter and two of the
Dusky Parrots took a box each. In the neighbourhood of their box they
were aggressive and showed their aggression by parading up and down
the perch outside the box in the fluffed posture shown in the sketch. The
head is held low and the tail is flared to scrape along the perch.
One of the trio had never been able to fly and had some few primary
feathers missing and some feather discoloration. As they were very
heavily infested with Ascaridia intestinal worms on acquisition, this was
attributed to some dietary deficiency aggravated by their verminous
condition. This bird was seen pairing half-heartedly with another and a
week later this flightless bird became very week and died. On autopsy it was
found that she had been suffering from a long-standing toxic hepatitis. The

liver was enlarged and pale and on incision had the toughness of old boot
leather. It consisted of a mixture of fibrous tissue, bile ducts and a few
scattered cords of hepatocytes (liver cells): in fact I have never seen such a
splendid example of bile duct proliferation. This might have been caused by
aflatoxicosis (from eating mouldy peanuts) although it is equally consistent
with a variety of sublethal chronic poisons. It is not often realised by bird-
keepers that the peanuts they buy for their birds are, too frequently, dis-
carded for human consumption because they show evidence of being in-
fected with the highly poisonous mould Aspergillus flavus. Consequently it
is safer to buy peanuts sold for human consumption: liver damage by
chronic poisoning is too common an autopsy finding in captive parrots.
Then tragedy struck once more, in the space of a week, when one hen
killed the other. She entered the nest box of the rightful owner, who was in
process of laying an egg, and killed her with a few bites to the head. Until
this time I had never known, although I had been warned, that one would
directly attack another. After a week the murderess laid a clutch of three
eggs. And she has laid twice a year since. Like the other Pionus with
which I am experienced, the eggs are very large for the size of the bird.
During incubation, if the hen is caught off her eggs, she flies straight
back to the nest and, because she is so vicious in their defence, I have there-
fore been unable to foster her off with some fertile eggs. By good fortune I
have been promised the loan of a male bird for 1977.
When the hen is not laying, and she only lays in the summer, she never
roosts inside her nest box. As summer commences she starts her "parade"
walking up and down the perch near to her box. In high intensity the bill
actually touches the perch. A similar parade walk is found in Amazon
parrots, caiques, Hawkheads, Aratinga and Pyrrhura conures and in the
Yellow-cheeked Conure; I have not seen this in any Old World parrots.
She also shrugs her wings in recognition before flying over to be fed.

EXPERIENCES WITH FINCHES IN VENEZUELA

I. BRUSH-FINCHES
I have long been a student of those seed-eating birds that are generally
known as finches, and indeed have been keeping them almost continually
since 1947 when I bought my first pair of mannikins. Over the years,
I have managed to keep a large variety of species: indeed, on more than
one occasion, I have been tempted to conclude that I suffered from
"Butler's Disease" or, as my stepfather would say, my eyes were bigger
than my belly, by which I mean that my eagerness to keep new species
was such that my bird room and aviaries were almost always on the verge
of overcrowding. As the decades have passed by, I have become increas-
ingly saddened at the great gap which exists between the variety of species
that are imported into Europe and the range of species which are written
up in magazines and the text books. In the effort to bridge this gap (1975),
I went to inordinate lengths to find avicultural references for those species
with which I did not have any personal experience when I produced my
book on finches. The combination of research and personal experience
brought a total of some 350 species, but that still left another 350 species
about which nothing appeared to have been written--at least, in English,
to my knowledge.
When I transferred to our office in Venezuela, my heart leapt at the
thought of the South American finches that I would be able to find and
perhaps actually keep. Little did I realize how fortunate I would be, and
the pages of Rudolph Meyer de Schauensee's guide to the birds of
south America have since taken on a new meaning. I had not been here
very long when I was invited to spend the day with some new friends at
their home up in the hills above Caracas. I sat, sipping coffee, with my
field glasses ever at the ready, watching the Glossy Cowbirds and Blue-grey
Tanagers greedily gobbling the food that had been put out in the garden
for them. After the fifth or sixth Rufous-collared Sparrow appeared, I
began to calm down when I realized that each of these species was as
common as the House Sparrow back in England--at least, at that place
they were! Suddenly, an orange and olive bird popped up over the wall
and hopped forward to the scattered rice. "You're lucky," said my hostess,
"they don't come that often". The bird concerned was the Ochre-breasted
Brush-finch Atlapetes semirufus. This was my first really new finch in
South America. I turned to de Schauensee to find that he listed 23 species
of Brush-finch, and I noted that there are at least five more in Central
America that do not occur on the southern continent. I would not believe
that, in my efforts to write the standard avicultural handbook on the

finches, I could miss out an entire genus of 28 species; but as I looked at
that bird I knew that I had.
Atlapetes (Emberizinae) is an extraordinarily homogeneous genus: with
practically no exception, they are birds of the Andes and the spine of hills
that ranges up into Central America. They are birds of forest undergrowth
and are the antithesis of the open grass country finches that trappers
everywhere prefer. Since they are neither song-birds, not particularly
spectacular, and certainly not well known, there is no extra demand for
them to stimulate trappers or dealers. My check-list of species seen in
Venezuela now exceeds 500, but of the six members of the brush-finch
genus, I have seen only one in the wild and I have kept only two in
confinement. As far as I know, the only notes worth reading about any
member of this genus are those of Alexander Skutch. In his volume
central American highland birds (1967), the two species he deals with
are the Chestnut-capped Brush-finch Atlapetes brunneinucha and the
Yellow-throated Brush-finch Atlapetes gutturalis. In his earlier work on
Central American birds (1954), he contributes a chapter on Atlapetes
torquatus. Should the reader ever have the good fortune to obtain any of
these birds, I strongly recommend the effort to read what Skutch has
written; however, I must point out that there are virtually no comments

on the feeding behaviour of these birds. The entire genus is clearly a
virtually unknown group that really deserve study.
I soon returned to my friends' home in the hills armed with a trap cage.
My decoy was a Black-faced Grassquit, and I sat on the edge of the chair
excited and apprehensive for most of the day. During that time I caught
and released innumerable cowbirds and a few Rufous-collared Sparrows.
Eventually, a Rufous-breasted Brush-finch turned up and quite quickly
jumped into the trap compartment. This bird proved to be an immature,
for it was in a plumage presumably between that of the fledgling and the
adult. The fully adult bird has the entire head and breast an ochreous
rufous. The back, rump and upper tail-coverts are olive green, and the
flight feathers are blackish-brown edged with olive. The centre of the
lower breast, belly, under tail-coverts and under wing-coverts are yellow.
The axillaries are olive; the bill grey, paler at the base of the lower mandible,
and the eyes are a light orange-brown, closely matching that of the colour
of the head.
The sexes are impossible to tell apart in the field and, indeed, even in
a cage one has extreme difficulty in separating the birds until one becomes
familiar with their individual characteristics. Since catching that first
immature two years ago, I have caught many of these birds and kept
several of them at home for periods of up to a few months (I still suffer
from Butler's disease!). Adults invariably travel in pairs and seem to
keep to well defined territories. I have caught certain pairs on a couple of
occasions. The anal tuft of the male is usually well developed, as it would
be in a male canary, whilst that of the female is short and fluffy like that
of a female canary. Whilst the birds are of the same length from tip of
bill to tip of tail (it is virtually impossible to measure the full length of a
live bird accurately), the individual measurements of oilmen, wing and
tarsus seems to be all about 10 per cent longer in the case of the male bird.
I have seen several immatures and caught them. They have broader
olive margins on the flight feathers and the main body of the flights is less
black. The cinnamon part of the head and breast has been heavily varie-
gated with olive. I have never caught or seen an immature which is
completely olive on the head and breast, and I suspect that they begin to
show the brown feathers almost from the point of fledging. Incidentally,
this race is A. s. denisei , which ranges along the coastal hills of Venezuela
from Sucre and Monagas to Yaracuy.
According to the Phelps (1958) the species ranges from 4,500 feet (my
friends' house is at 5,000 feet) to 10,000 feet. It is a bird of thick hill
forests, preferring mixed woodland to the true rain forest, and is most
found in the dense underbrush of the better lighted parts of the woods
rather than in the darker areas. I have never seen it higher than a couple
of feet from the ground and it hunts for food, practically exclusively, on
the forest floor. The method of feeding that brush-finches have is to use
their rather stout bill to knock leaves and the floor debris aside, but what

they actually feed upon does not appear to be recorded in the literature.
However, those in the hills around Caracas are certainly attracted to feeding
areas where they will take broken rice and dry bird seed. The Ochre-
breasted Brush-finches that I have kept have never once given me the
slightest bit of trouble regarding diet. I have kept some birds exclusively
on mixed dry seeds and they have appeared to do just as well as those
which have also been given mealworms which were much appreciated.
I have tried them on different fruits and fresh seeding grass, but they have
shown little interest in either. They have taken a little "universal" soft
food. I suspect that they live mainly on fallen seeds and insects, mostly
obviously grubs and small beetles. In temperament, they have always
seemed to be very equable.
Some other friends live in a house at a similar altitude on the other side
of the Caracas valley and they have reported that the Stripe-crowned
Brush-finch Atlapetes torquatus occasionally comes to their birdtable to
feed. I have visited the garden and area, but never had the good fortune
to see it. Imagine my joy when this fellow telephoned me, at the office a
few weeks ago, to say that one of these birds had flown into his dining-room
window and had stunned itself. "Would you be prepared to look after the
bird for a while until it is well enough to be released ?" Within a few hours,
I was carefully examining an extremely healthy bird. From its anal tuft,
I judged it to be a male and placed it in a large cage with a cardinal and a
cowbird. It settled in immediately, was very steady, and behaved as
though it had lived in a cage all its life. I kept it for three weeks before
releasing it, carefully painting it in precise detail. It took all the dry seeds
that the other birds took, readily took a mealworm or two, but it did not
leap to the mealworm bowl with the alacrity of either the cardinal or the
cowbird. It certainly sampled the soft food that I provided, but I cannot
say whether it took much in quantity. This bird is also extremely secretive,
keeping very much to the dark undergrowth on the wooded hillsides.
A careful check of Phelps* records shows that this bird is A. t. phaeo-
pleurusy which ranges along the coastal hills of Venezuela, from Miranda
to Aragua to Carabobo. The top and sides of the head are black, with an
irregular grey stripe along the crown; there is a white superciliary stripe;
the nape and sides of neck are grey; the rest of the upperparts are olive,
and there is a thin ridge of bright yellow along the leading edge of the
shoulder. The chin and throat are pure white, divided from a huffish
breast by an irregular line of black; the flanks are somewhat olivaceous,
mixed with cinnamon; the under tail-coverts are cinnamon. The sexes
appear to be identical.
Alexander Skutch refers to this bird as the Striped Brush-finch. He
does not say which race it belongs to, but it is quite obviously distinct from
the one that occurs in the hills around Caracas, which is just one of three
races that occur in Venezuela. Skutch's bird has the... "head striped with
grey and black. A broad grey stripe extends from the forehead over the

centre of the crown and down the hind neck; on each side of this runs a
black band, which in turn is bordered by a grey stripe that arches above
the eye. The lores, cheeks and auriculars are black". In other respects, this
bird appears to be similar to the race from Caracas. Skutch describes the
nestling and new fledgling and it would appear that the grey stripes of the
head are olive, while the white of the throat is dull grey in the latter.
Another interesting point to note in this Skutch report is his comment
on food. And again I quote: "Its diet seems to be composed principally
of the small invertebrate creatures which it finds lurking beneath the
ground litter of the thickets. At times it eats decaying leaves, a taste
difficult to account for, unless it be that these leaves bear a fungus growth
which serves as food. Among mammals, the agouti sometimes consumes
such leaves". One does not have to look as far as mammals for a parallel,
however, for the Greyish Saltator may usually be seen eating leaves of all
types. Several other seed-eaters will eat leaves, including decaying leaves,
and I have seen three different species of Sporophila eat dead leaves in my
cages. I am sure that Skutch is right in his observations on these birds
eating invertebrates and leaves, but I must point out that the individual
in my care cheerfully and immediately took dry, hard seed, and I have
seen the Ochre-breasted Brush-finch take cracked rice and scattered millet
seed round feeding stations with complete lack of inhibition.

During the summers of 1975 and 1976 my husband and I attempted to
assess the survival status of the St. Vincent species of Amazon parrot,
Amazona guildingii. Together with two of its Lesser Antillean cousins--
St. Lucia's A. versicolor and Dominica's A. imperialis --it is listed as an
endangered species in the Red Data Sheets of the International Union for
the Conservation of Nature and Natural Resources. Shortly to be added to
this depressing catalogue is the third Lesser Antillean parrot, A. arausiaca 9
a denizen of Dominica's rain forest.
The field study on the St. Vincent Parrot was the primary directive of the
Durham University Expedition to St. Vincent, which we organised and
took part in as biologists.
Apart from brief notes in Forshaw's book (1973) and in the relevant Red
Data Sheet, next to nothing was known, at the time, of the biology of
A. guildingii. Even less adequate were data on the survival chances of the
species. Several population estimates (or rather, "guesstimates") had been
made off and on, but most of these conflicted and clearly suffered from the
lack of a quantitative approach. Thus the size of the entire population on
the island had been variously assessed at several hundred (Bond, 1929;
Forshaw, 1973), several thousand (Miller, pers. comm.) and "fairly
common" (Lack et al., 1973). Kirby, the government's Chief Veterinary
Officer in St. Vincent is the only local observer to have made his views
known. From life-long contact with the bird, he believed, and still does,
that except for natural dynamic fluctuations, the population should remain
stable, and that the species in itself appears viable (pers. comm, and
Forshaw 1973).
However, one cannot fail to appreciate the problems posed by a quanti-
tative assessment of any tree canopy-dwelling species of animal. The
usual methods of population estimation require the application of capture-
recapture techniques. But as we ourselves discovered, detection of the St.
Vincent Parrot is by no means easy (and even when visual contact is made,
it is often only transitory), far less capture. The difficulties are further
compounded when dealing with a species diagnosed as endangered; to
subject A. guildingii to the trauma of a capture--recapture procedure is
obviously inadvisable.
We therefore limited ourselves to the following:
(i) a distribution survey.
(ii) to determine whether or not there was any intervalley exchange of
parrot populations.
(iii) a census of captive birds on the island.

The above actually formed the second phase of our fieldwork. The first
phase was a preliminary familiarisation study in the headwaters of the
Buccament Valley (see map) which later helped us to detect the species in
the canopy. Many behavioural observations were also made during this
period, together with some nest measurement data.

FINDINGS
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999438432432432" page_id="56386359"  page_num="35" year="" vol="">
Calls: The parrots invariably announced their presence by loud
"quaa-quaas" when flying (usually in pairs) high overhead or immediately
upon taking wing. Feeding was accompanied by a variety of calls that
ranged from rasping squawks to softer squeals, trills and chirps.
Size and plumage: The adult bird is some 18 inches in length, both
sexes being of similar size. Plumage is not sexually dimorphic, which makes
it virtually impossible to tell male and female apart. The male's crown
feathers tend to be more ruffled than those of the female, but this is by
no means a reliable differentiating feature.
We saw a spectrum of variably coloured individuals, both captive and
wild. The plumage included green, blue, orange, gold, violet, black and
white in its array. However, with experience, we recognised that many of
these birds could be placed into two fairly distinct colour categories; one
with predominantly orange tail feathers and primaries and the other
predominantly green in these parts. Such polymorphism had previously
been described by Nichols and Nichols (1973). In a S.A.F.E. Newsletter
(No. 2, 1974) Nichols reaffirmed the existence of two identifiable morphs
and recorded--from museum specimens--that "about 85 per cent of the
parrots are predominantly yellow and brown ... the remaining 15 per cent
being the more typical Amazon green". We could not support these
statistics on account of the difficulty in discerning the plumage colour of
such high-fliers as parrots. As well, there was an inherent observer bias to
start with: orange morphs are easier to spot among green canopy than
green morphs. In the same article Mrs. Nichols tentatively opines that "the
green morph is controlled by a dominant gene". Her evidence--yet to be
published--stemmed from a pair of captive parrots at Houston Zoo in
Texas and from observations in the breeding season of 1975 (pers. comm.).
Apparently matings between orange morph and green morph parents
produced green morph progeny, while matings between green morphs
resulted in green morphs only i.e., green bred true.
If polymorphism is truly present in the species, then a third, black
"morph" may well be added. Several birds we saw in captivity were black,
or very dark black-green tipped with black, from their napes, down across
their mantles, to both primary coverts and lower back. The question,
though, of whether such well differentiated morphs exist must remain
speculation until a larger sample has been studied.
Feeding. Captured birds prove very catholic in their tastes. Guava, fresh

vegetables, weeds, seeds, banana, coconut, paw-paw and bread and milk
are all received with equal relish. Of course the diet in the wild is rather less
varied. Birds were observed feeding on fruit from the "palm-mist",
penny-piece Pouteria multiflora , bullet fruit Manikara bidentata and both
small- and broad-leafed fig.
The notable aggregations of A. guildingii may in part be due to their
congregation in a single food tree during times of food scarcity.
Breeding. The breeding season extends from the beginning of April (or
the middle of March in good years) to the middle of August. Activity is
greatest in the early months and tails off in the last two months.
Nests were confined largely to the tall gommier tree, Dacryodes excelsa.
The brittle nature of this species results in limb breakage at the forks of
branches and the holes thus formed enlarge through rot. Where necessary,
the parrots further excavate these cavities and use the chips as nest-bedding
material. Our guide, a local farmer-cum-forest hunter, and a keen parrot
observer, had discovered that the deeper the "cub" or hole, the greater the
likelihood of its being utilised every breeding season, and--not surprisingly
--holes prone to dampness were the least favoured.
Other trees in which nests are occasionally found are the waterwood, the
"jumby-tree" and the fine-leaf santinee. It appears that any tree with an
adequate-sized hole is used by the parrot for nesting, and this is confirmed
to some extent by Bond (i960) who reported nesting at sea-level where
primary forest types like the gommier no longer exist. As yet, it is not known
whether intraspecific competition for nest sites occurs, but there is certainly
occasional interspecific competition between the parrots and the wild bee,
colonies of which may overrun a "cub" for its hive, and in consequence deny
its use to A. guildingii.
Clutch size, both in captivity and the wild is usually two or three eggs
(Forshaw, 1973; Miller pers. comm.). Although, for some reason, the
third egg rarely hatches, it would be interesting to see if this hatches in
"good" years i.e. } when food is exceptionally plentiful. After hatching
(in the wild), the shells are said to be removed by the female parent and
deposited some distance from the nest, presumably as a decoy. Both parents
take responsibility for feeding the young by regurgitation.
Although 20 nest holes were seen during the survey (all but three of
which were in D. excelsa ) 3 only seven of these were climbable owing to
adverse weather conditions. Four parameters were measured: (i) hole
length--to the farthest point from the entrance; (ii) hole breadth--at the
entrance; (iii) hole height--at the entrance and (iv) height of hole entrance
from ground--taken as a directly vertical distance. The approximate means
of these measurements were as follows: (i) 2 feet; (ii) 1 foot 2 inches;
(iii) 1 foot 5 inches; (iv) 50 feet.
Predation. Predation is greatest among eggs and fledglings. The four
non-human predators largely responsible are: the Thrasher Margarops sp..
Broad-winged or Chicken Hawk Buteo platypterus , which preys on chicks

in the nest, and the Manacou (oppossum), which victimizes both eggs and
chicks, as does the Black Rat Rattus rattus. No quantitative assessment has
yet been made on the degree of egg/chick mortality.
Human predation remains by far the most significant facing the species.
Although hunting for the pot (Bond, 1961) has diminished considerably,
wing-shooting and nest-robbing for the pet market continues with alarm-
ing efficiency, and very likely accounts for more than a score of young birds
every year. When prices of $400-600 E.C. (#80-120) per bird are compared
with a local peasant's annual income of little more than this figure, it is
not surprising that such practices still flourish despite government legisla-
tion. So-called animal lovers from abroad pay far in excess of this figure
for the illegal export of parrots as pets, and this clearly exacerbates the
situation. The latter remonstration, I hasten to add, is not directed against
those conservationists who are genuinely interested in the plight of the
species and who are currently involved in captive breeding projects outside
St. Vincent. I refer to Houston Zoo in Texas and Jersey Zoo in the
British Isles.
Captive census. A census of captive parrots was carried out during the
1975 survey, and proved far larger than has been previously reported. A
total of 42 birds in 14 different locations on St. Vincent, Bequia and
Mustique (and including n in Barbados), were recorded, but the wide-
spread sale of young fresh from the nest every breeding season, made an
accurate, comprehensive survey virtually impossible. Indeed, several
privately owned parrots were discovered quite by chance.
The majority of cages (by no stretch of euphemism could they be called
aviaries) were built without any regard for the parrots' requirements for
exercise space, perches or nesting facilities. Cage layout appeared to depend
solely on the owner's personal whim, which explains the wide spectrum of
cage dimensions recorded. Only two owners were sufficiently interested in
the biology of the birds and their survival status to set up boxes or hollow
logs to encourage breeding. Most owners were not even concerned about
the sex of their birds, and this indifference to pair compatibility led, on
more than one occasion, to two males fighting within the confines of a cage,
until one or other was mortally wounded.
In Barbados, Bill Miller has recently (1976) succeeded in breeding and
rearing a St. Vincent Parrot, a noteworthy event insofar as it is but the
second time to date that A. guildingii has been bred in captivity. The first
occasion was at Houston Zoo, Texas, when one of two eggs hatched. Under
the care of Holly Nichols, the fledgling developed into adulthood. In
Miller's case three eggs were laid by an orange-morph female mated to
a green-morph male. Only one egg hatched to produce a healthy green
morph chick. Last year, the same pair produced two young (three eggs
laid), but unfortunately, just as they were about to fledge at 41 days, they
succumbed to a fungal infection in the bagasse used unwittingly by Miller
as bedding. Miller has plans to further enlarge his aviaries and to replace

Distribution in the wild-area surveyed . The second phase of our study
was an assessment of the distribution of A. guildingii in the wild, the first
phase--the above behavioural study in the Buccament Valley--having
served to familiarise us with parrot detection in the canopy and recognition
of the various calls.
The Rabacca Dry River serves as a convenient geographical marker
dividing the mountains of the south from Mt. Soufriere, the volcano in the
north. According to numerous local informants, including three forest
wardens, parrots were said to be plentiful in the montane forests to the
south of the Rabacca: the position in the north remained unclear.
Consequently phase two comprised a survey of three river valleys in the
southern half of the island, and the eastern, southern, western and north-
western slopes of the volcano, Mt. Soufriere (see map).
The three valleys covered in the southern two thirds of the island were
the (i) Buccament (ii) Richmond (iii) Colonarie. The choice was arbitrary,
but we attempted to cover as wide an area as possible by selecting valleys
approximately equidistant from one another. As previously mentioned, the
Buccament survey lasted just over one month, while the surveys in the
Richmond and Colonarie lasted three and four days respectively. For the
latter, we penetrated into the headwaters of the main river valley and noted
the number of parrots seen and the number of times their cries were
heard--a vocal plotting technique used only as an indicator of bird
numbers.
In the north, two areas were investigated: (i) the southern and south-
western slopes of Mt. Soufriere, that is, from i,ooo feet contour line in the
west to sea-level in the east (eight days), and (ii) the presumed forested
flanks of Somma Ridge--a remnant of the ancient crater rim--in the
north-west (three days). Observations in these two areas were used as an
indicator of the presence or absence of A. guildingii north of the Rabacca
Dry River. As the volcano last erupted in 1902, destroying forest cover on
the southern, western and eastern slopes, it was reasoned that any immigra-
tion from the south would show in colonisation of the area studied. The
Somma Ridge area was regarded as being potentially the more fruitful as it
had been said that this tall buttress probably protected the north-western
stands of primary forest from the ardent nuee of the 1902 eruption.
Results of the wild distribution survey: southern sector.
Richmond Valley. A single pair of parrots were seen flying on two occasions
in the headwaters of this valley, approximately 2\ miles from the coast.
Parrot calls were heard a total of five times (each call-count records a call
heard which apparently came from a new location to other calls recorded.
There is, of course, no guarantee that they did not originate from the same
individual).
Colonarie Valley. Likewise, only one pair of parrots were seen in this valley

flying high above the canopy. Parrots calls were heard on seven separate
occasions.
Buccament Valley. Sixteen parrot sightings were made during our stay in
the Buccament: 12 pairs, one lone bird and three flocks of four to five birds
per flock. Parrot calls were numerous and some 170 were recorded during
the month's stay.
Results of the wild distribution survey: northern sector.
(i) Six of the eight days on the southern and south-western slopes of Mt.
Soufriere were spent as follows: (a) three sorties on the eastern side of the
volcano, (b) one sortie on the west, to the 1,000 feet contour line, and (c) one
sortie down the southern slope.
In each area, native tracks were followed through the vegetation and
visual/auditory signs of A. guildingii looked for. Our search proved in
vain. This finding, coupled with the very telling dearth of mature, rain
forest tree species, particularly the gommier, indicated to us a true
absence of breeding parrots in this region. But, on the other hand, at least
one food species (the small-leafed fig) was in evidence, yet the parrots
seemed to be making no use of this available food source.
During the remaining two days we climbed to the top of the volcano and
skirted around the crater rim towards the base of Somma Ridge. Unfortun-
ately, however, we were forced to abandon the climb through lack of
water. An exceptionally dry September had caused the southern streams,
from which we had planned to replenish our reserves, to dry up. And, of
course, any trickle the northern streams might have provided was made
inaccessible by virtue of the presence of Somma Ridge itself.
(ii) The following year, Somma was approached from the north-west.
The ridge flanking Tucker Bay river valley was followed to the summit of
Somma. Use was again made of native tracks for about two-thirds of the
way, but the last third appeared quite untrodden. There was neither
sight nor sound of parrots, but this was hardly surprising in a habitat which
turned out--quite contrary to one expert's expectations---to be covered in
little more than scrub.
Frustratingly, time ran out on us before we could extend the north
island survey to the northern and north-eastern slopes of Soufriere, so the
occurrence of a detached parrot population in the north still remains an
intriguing speculation.
Concluding remarks.
Coupled with reports from Nichols (pers. comm.), local hunters and
forest wardens--people in constant first-hand contact with parrots--our
survey of A. guildingii in the southern two-thirds of St. Vincent's rain
forests seems to indicate fairly large numbers of birds (of the order of a few
thousand). It is generally considered that the size of this island population
is big enough to ensure species survival for the foreseeable future, providing
that the pet trade is curbed. Such a conclusion is, of course, based on data
which is incomplete in several respects, and further fieldwork would provide

a more complete and accurate picture of A. guildingii's status.
It would be interesting, for instance, to find an answer to the question:
what is the extent, if any, of parrot movement between adjacent valleys?
Being strong fliers, such movement might be expected, though whether
parrots venture over several valleys or, perhaps, even over the whole
south of the island during their lifetime, is quite unknown. A ringing
study could provide much information on this point. As a matter of fact,
the 1976 follow-up study was meant to include a ringing project, but
unfortunately, our guide had shortly to be operated on for a hernia, and so
was in no shape to climb some 80 feet to band young parrots. The bands
we intended to use were variously coloured and made of a tough plastic.
The design allowed for a limited increase in diameter. We had planned to
test them first on captive parrots.
Questions more pertinent to the conservation of the species are: (i) what
is the carrying capacity of St. Vincent's rain forest as it now stands? In
other words, what is the minimum area of rain forest that can permanently
accommodate a viable parrot population? (ii) for how many years can
the present rate of parrot hunting continue before numbers reach an
irrecoverable level?
In our report (Laidler and Laidler, 1975, 1976) we offer a number of
proposals for the protection of the St. Vincent Parrot. I have chosen to omit
them from this already lengthy article. Suffice it to say here that, clearly,
strong action must be taken against the hunters on the one hand and both
local and foreign pet traders on the other. Certainly the former could not
exist without the pecuniary incentives of the latter. There is a law in St.
Vincent against both practices but, of course, legislation in itself is no
guarantee against malpractice. Our captive census in 1975 of just local
birds bears witness to this sad reality of the law. The lack of stringent
control, though, is understandable when viewed in the light of the immense
difficulties faced by the St. Vincent Government in areas which, naturally,
they consider of greater priority, e.g ., schools, health facilities etc., for the
human population. Nevertheless, when one considers the inestimable
tourist revenue that wildlife can provide, especially with a bird as colourful
as the St. Vincent Parrot (known only from this island), then perhaps, in
the long term, the preservation of such a creature would substantially aid
the ability of the St. Vincent Government to further its social welfare
programme.
Still, the law permits any worthy conservationist to take a pair of parrots
out of the island provided they are used strictly for breeding purposes. The
parrots remain the property of the St. Vincent Government. Should the
breeding be a success, the conservationist is allowed another pair of
birds, while the fledgling(s) must be returned to the island (ideally) for
reintroduction into the forest. The danger here lies in the government
becoming complacent about the future of the parrot. Already, a "the-
problem-is-being-seen-to" attitude can be detected. The captive breeding

project abroad is commendable, but it should be treated only as a. stand-by.
Secondary to curbing the pet trade ring, more effort and money should be
channelled into a captive breeding project on the island itself where tropical
conditions need not be artificially (not to mention, expensively) maintained,
and where reintroduction would be far more practicable.

THE LAST DAYS OF THE CAROLINA PARRAKEET:
LIFE IN THE ZOOS
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.9498425" page_id="56386366"  page_num="42" year="" vol="">
By Daniel McKinley (State University of New York, Albany, N.Y.)
The Carolina Parrakeet Conuropsis carolinensis had "Last Days" both
in the wild and in captivity. Even in the latter state, in public view in
zoological gardens, the species gradually fell into a yawn of incomprehen-
sion and shallowness.
Several accounts will benefit from an airing, for their accuracy is question-
able : besides, no account of an extinct species is complete without reference
to its fortunes, if any, as a captive animal. It is also to be hoped that un-
published information may be found, once investigators learn where to
look.
This report covers zoo records mainly, although a few references to
avicultural accounts are noted. Pending a review of the latter (to be
published later), the valuable synthesis of A. A. Prestwich (1951) ought to
be consulted.
Max Schmidt, director of the Zoological Garden at Frankfurt-am-Main,
recorded of two Carolina Parrakeets that one had lived 12 years, 3 months
and 14 days. The second had lived 10 years, 5 months and 23 days in the
zoo and was still alive at the end of 1879 (1880: 310). Actually, the
Frankfurt Zoological Garden had had three Carolina Parrakeets die in
the period covered by Schmidt, for their skins were contributed to the
Senckenberg Museum in that city (1865,1869,1872); the survivor of 1879
seems not to have been salvaged as a specimen (unpublished correspon-
dence). As early as i860, the Frankfurt birds had laid four eggs; whether
they laid more, I cannot say. Furthermore, two eggs were laid in the

Hannover Zoo in 1868--again, there may have been no others, for my
unpublished survey of specimens in museums indicates that there may
never have been more than the single pair of birds there. The dates of
their deaths are not now known, although the Zoological Museum of
Hannover has two war-damaged specimens that may be those birds
(Prestwich 1951:79; Finsch 1867:67,486; Russ 1879:234).
Several European museums have specimens of the Carolina Parrakeet
marked "from the zoo," etc. Published information on them, however, is
scanty. For example, Lukaszewicz (1965) indicates that two parrakeets
lived in the Wroclaw (Breslau) Zoological Garden until 1884--but where
and when they were acquired and how long they lived is not clear. Again,
the Dresden Staatliches Museum has three lots of eggs (2, 2, 1) "from the
zoo", but as with information from Hannover, if anything was ever known,
records were destroyed in the disastrous air raids of World War II.
There are other hints: a specimen that died in the Botanic Garden men-
agerie in Paris in 1818 (specimen now in the Museum of Natural History);
three specimens (died 1862, 1862, 1886) from the Zoological Gardens of
Amsterdam (skins in Amsterdam Zoological Museum and the Natural
History Museum at Leiden); specimens from the Schonbrunn Zoo,
Vienna, now in the Natural History Museum, with dates of 1877, 1881; a
male and female that died in the Sofia Zoological Garden in 1901 and are
now skins in the Museum of the Academy of Sciences there; and, finally,
two skins and skeletons--probably the eggs mentioned above were their
productions--that were destroyed completely in Dresden during World
War II. Local archivists may be able to provide additional information on
some of these specimens and others still undocumented.
Summarizing data available to him from offices of the Zoological
Society of London, P. Chalmers Mitchell found that in the years 1870-
1902, the average duration of life in the zoo for 90 individuals of the genus
Conurus (which originally included the Carolina Parrakeet) was 56 months
--the maximum duration being 248 months (1911: 495-496). For
Conuropsis alone (this was the genus erected by Salvadori for that single
species in 1891), records on six individuals were known; the average dura-
tion of life was 81 months, the maximum duration 114 months. The first
showing of the species in the London Zoo was in i860 (A. G. Butler 1890:
162). Various additional dates of acquisition of this species are recorded in
Sclater's faithful lists: 1867, 1869-a, 1877, 1894. Five of these birds were
among the species present or recently present in the Zoo in 1883; two
were added in 1894, one of which survived just long enough to be listed in
Sclater's account of 1902.
"Zoological Garden" it may have been called but it was really little more
than a menagerie: in the 20 years previous to 1869 the London Zoological
Garden had succeeded in breeding only five species of parrot (Sclater

increasing sense of urgency in breeding Carolina Parrakeets as extinction

approached. By the 1890s, the picture of approaching doom was pretty
clear to ornithologists in America (which is not to say that their reactions
were very helpful). In Germany, the great Hartlaub sounded the warning
(1895: 10-ix). But even the sneers of plume hunters and their urban
profiteers could not have matched the smugness with which his account
was met in ultraofficial quarters of British ornithology. A reviewer in
the ibis doubted if things were quite as bad as Hartlaub painted them:
after all, "There are even now examples of Conurus carolinensis to be seen
alive in the Zoological Society's Gardens ..." (Anon. 1895).
Parrakeets were in the Zoo; all was well with the world!
The Hartlaub work was issued in a second edition--and still painfully
near the truth as far as the Carolina Parrakeet was concerned. But the
editors-reviewers in the ibis were not to be misled by less than a complete
extinction: "It is certain that a number of Carolina Parrakeets (Conurus
carolinensis) have lately been imported into Europe and sold by the
dealers at a few shillings each" (and the editors ought to have known: one
of them was P. L. Sclater, author of the 1894 list indicating the purchase of
two parrakeets). A footnote adds: "A correspondent writing from
Kissimmee, Florida, says:--'There have been some men here from the
Smithsonian Institution, who have carried back several hundred skins of
the Parrakeet with them.' EDD." And again, the clincher: "Examples of
this bird are in the Zoological Society's Parrot-house" (Anon. 1896).
"Several hundred skins" . . . ! (It was extravagant prevarication, even
though in truth the hunters had not returned empty-handed to Washing-
ton). No wonder Charles Dixon should have confidently told his readers
that the end had not yet come to the Carolina Parrakeet (1898: 237-238).
And, not content to let bad enough alone, the editor of the ibis twisted the
knife a bit: "The Parrot-House (overfull, as usual) contains ... a pair of
Carolina conures (Conuropsis carolinensis ), sometimes supposed to be
extinct" (Anon. 1899).
There is comfort in language and our most idiotic illusions are support-
ed and nurtured by it. Because a few parrakeets were isolated in aviaries,
the species was not extinct; just, as in the wild, the last individuals clinging
together to the end generated hare-brained reports that flocks of par-
rakeets still roamed the wilderness.
Well, it was not extinct. Yet. An anonymous contributor to English
avicultural literature even reported a rather unenlightening anecdote that a
Captain Nicholl had had "another unsuccessful nesting" of the Carolina
Parrakeet (Anon. 1903-1904). Perhaps his birds did not try again or it may
be, as with the alleged previous attempts, nobody bothered to relate the
fact to an ill-informed world. (We have it on authority of Dr. E. Hopkinson
that the species never bred in the United Kingdom (1938: 302).)
The record is perhaps more deplorable in America than in Europe, for
American owners knew of concern for the birds' status. There were at
least two female birds in Washington (whether in the U.S. National

Zoological Garden or in Robert Ridgway's private collection of live birds,
I do not know) in the years 1877, 1878 and 1883 (egg records prove this).
Whether there were males and how long the females lived is not clear.
Meanwhile, the Philadelphia Zoological Garden acquired two Carolina
Parrakeets, evidently a pair (Anon. 1884), for one of their eggs hatched in
1885 (Anon. 1885). The Garden exhibited as many as 11 birds between
1874 and 1900. Ledgers have been lost and there is no record of the arrival
of the first seven birds. "Bird number eight, a male, was presented by
Robert Ridgway of Washington, D.C., on the 25th of October 1884 and
died on the 9th of August 1898. Birds number nine, ten and eleven were
captured in the winter of 1884 to 1885 east of Kissimmee City in central
Florida by N. Nietz of Lansdale, Pa., who presented them to the Society on
the 30th of December 1897. The sexes of these birds are not recorded.
Number nine bird died on the 29th of May 1898, number ten bird died on
the 10th of June 1899 and number eleven bird died on the 20th of August
1900 s ' (John A. Griswold, letter 1959).
Mr. Griswold also cites the Thirteenth Annual Report of the Board of
Directors for 1884 (printed in 1885), where the receipt of the "splendid
pair" of parrakeets is recorded, a species they had not had in the collection
"for some years". The Fourteenth Annual Report for 1885 (printed 1886)
records the hatching of the one young, previously mentioned: presumably
offspring of the pair, unless Ridgway's bird had something to do with it.
There is no record of how long--or if--the young bird lived. That there
were more eggs laid that year (whether incubated unsuccessfully or simply
sold to collectors is not known) is indicated by the fact that the Bayard
Cutting Arboretum (Oakdale, N.Y.) has four parrakeet eggs claimed to be
from the Philadelphia Zoo in 1885.
Bird skin collectors returned from the fast-disappearing Florida back-
woods regions and brought with them birds that had survived the shot-
gunning but had not been turned into specimens and were not fit for
ogling by the public in zoos. W. J. Hoxie brought a crippled parrakeet from
Florida to South Carolina about 1889 (see my Florida account, as yet
unpublished). How long it lived is not known. Likewise, I am told that
Arthur T. Wayne returned from a Florida collecting trip with an injured
bird to Charleston about 1893, giving rise to what must be one of the most
definitive last records of the species in any state. It fell off its perch into the
yard and was eaten by a wandering pig (Jay Shuler, letter 1961).
In 1896, Robert Ridgway--a member of the Smithsonian group!--
brought back from Florida, with the considerably less than "hundreds" of
skins, three parrakeets that were injured but had recovered from wounds.
These he housed at his home at Brookland, District of Columbia (Butler
1931: 439). Two of them were parents of a brood whose misfortunes I
shall chronicle elsewhere. The female of the pair died November 1902,
after having laid, largely in vain, a good many eggs; the male died in
February 1903. Two more birds, displayed at the National Zoological

Park, were acquired in May 1896; both died in 1913.
Almost the only intelligent contemporary summary ever made on the
Carolina Parrakeet in captivity in the United States was written by Lee S.
Crandall in 1912. The occasion was acquisition of a "pair" of parrakeets by
the New York Zoological Society from the Zoological Society of Cincin-
nati. That was the first time the species had been exhibited in New York.
These two birds, with six more then remaining at Cincinnati, had been
bought in 1889 (I suspect the date is approximate) and were, thus, about
22 years old. The original purchase price, Crandell had been told, was
$3 each.
This spreading out of superannuated parrakeets was an exercise in
futility. At Crandall's time of writing, there were still three specimens in
the U.S. National Zoological Park: the two just mentioned and the famous
"Doodles," hatched in 1902 in that Ridgway clutch referred to above and
long cared for by Paul Rartsch. No doubt he had been put with the other
two in a belated hope of fomenting fertility.
Crandall had been assured by the fire-breathing Dr. Hornaday that
"there is not at this time even one colony alive in Florida, or elsewhere." In
the European zoos, he had been informed by David Seth-Smith, Curator
of Birds at the Zoological Gardens of London, not a single specimen re-
mained; the last of the London Zoo birds had died in 1902 and Crandall
supposed that a parrakeet that died in Berlin in 1904 "was probably the
last of the thousands shipped to Europe from America."
However, the end was not so uncomplicated. Otto Widmann wrote in
1907 that "On a recent tour through Europe, Dr. Eimbeck ... found only
one individual in the zoological gardens he visited (in Hamburg) . . ."
(1907: 115). There was indeed one at Hamburg; and it lived there for an
unknown number of years afterwards. Its existence is further proved by
the fact that Crandall himself saw it there, "living out of doors in very
cold weather," in November 1912--after his article was published
(Crandall, letter 1959).
Bent listed several observations on the fortunes of parrakeets kept in
captivity in Cincinnati, relayed to him by Dr. William C. Herman of Ohio
(1940: 6). They were thus known to the ornithological world. In spite of
this and despite the fact that the whole world had come to believe (correctly
and yet incorrectly, as will be seen) that the very last parrakeet in the
world had died in the Cincinnati Zoo, a letter of inquiry to their officials in
1959 elicited only a postal card in reply. It came from their public relations
department, the gist of its message being: "I have a report of the Zoological
Society dating back to 1875 and there is no mention of the Carolina
parrakeet. No one now employed here has any record of this bird's being on
exhibition here, although no doubt many were at one time, along with
other American species."
There can be no doubt that Hornaday (1913:16) was justified in writing
the species oft&amp;apos; as lost, even though there were then a few doomed birds in

captivity. One of the New York birds had already died. The birds in the
National Zoological Park, too, died, with the year 1913 claiming the two
old birds. Bartsch himself did not give the date of the death of Doodles
(1952). It was apparently August 1914: almost exactly the time, of course
that "Martha," the last Passenger Pigeon, died in Cincinnati (September
1st 1914). The skin of Doodles, without date , is deposited in the National
Museum collection and the trunk is preserved in the spirit collection there
also, with the date of "August(?) 1914" on the label.
But note well that Doodles was a Washington bird. Ornithologists have
long had it that the last parrakeet died in September 1914 in Cincinnati (see,
for example, Greenway 195S: 322). This probably was a confusion of the
death of Doodles with the date and place of Martha's death.
There it might easily have remained but for the informed snooping of
George Laycock (1969). That is his story and he tells it well. However, for
the record, here are summaries of three newspaper clippings, dug out by
Laycock and shown to me by Les Line, National Audubon Society.
Doodles was indeed the last of the Washington parrakeets. But a short
notice in a Cincinnati newspaper in 1916 (Anon. 1916) reported that the
Cincinnati Zoo still had parrakeets--the two remaining individuals in the
world. The zoo director, Sol Stephan, reported that they had been in
captivity for 30 years, having been purchased for $2.50 each. (One of the
blessings of captivity, the journalist pointed out, obviously not meaning to
be funny, was that if the birds had been left in the wild they would have
been dead long ago; another blessing, obviously, is that captors begin to
round off dates of capture and costs.)
A second note later that year (Anon. 1916) reported that the Zoo had
refused to sell the two birds for $400. The London Zoo--evidently no
longer the keeper of more parrakeets than they could house--wanted to
buy them!
The refusal of that princely offer seems to have been the last newspaper
copy merited by the parrakeets, except for a third notice in February 1918
that the male (or so assumed, anyway, and named "Incas") had just died,
the last of his race. Quite in passing, it was noted that "Lady Jane" had
died the previous summer (Anon. 1918).
Except for the obituaries, that is it. Casey A. Wood thought that aviaries
might save the parrakeet, should breeding stock ever come to light (1926).
California, he thought, would make a good region to try it, a safe enough
speculation, as it turned out. Leon Patrick damned "the bureaucratic
protectionists" and held that only the aviary could have saved parrakeets or
could save other such birds (1928). The Marquis of Tavistock was more
temperate in his judgment: the species could have been saved if "avicul-
turists had not been too lazy and unenterprising to make the effort"
(1929:132)-
Tavistock about hit the mark, if one considers zoo keepers and avicul-
turists together. It is not likely that so many stupidities would be committed

by zoos and bird-keepers today. And there is no doubt that they could do
much better now, if society gives them the encouragement (Conway
1969). But a better eye than mine is required to discern that commitment,
for I do not think that society has yet given zoos an enlightened and sus-
tained mandate in terms of facilities, guaranteed financial support and
intelligent and trained keepers. Furthermore, keepering must be a means
and not an end. It is not acceptable unless it enables the species to survive
in the wild. Nor can the aim be production of genetic monsters in a state
of domestication.
In fact, "survival" in the zoo alone is only one step from "survival" in a
glass dome of stuffed birds. In the latter condition, the Carolina Parrakeet
can already be said to have fared well! The late Paul Hahn (1963) discover-
ed that there are about 720 skins and mounted specimens of the parrakeet;
and I have increased this number to over 740 mounts and skins, plus a
scattering of skeletal material and eggs (McKinley, unpublished). The
obituary of the Carolina Parrakeet actually was once written in just these
academic terms, even shortly before the various "last sightings" had gone
the way of most claims that never materialize: "At one time it was very
common in the aviaries of amateurs, but can now be seen only in museums,
where it is fairly common..." (Delacour and Berlioz 1926:182).

TWO COLLECTIONS OF BIRDS IN MEXICO

By J. Delacour (Cleres, Seine Maritime)
I had long been aware of the existence of two great collections, parti-
cularly of game birds, in Mexico, one near the capital city and the other at
Tuxpan, farther west in the State of Jalisco. I knew that their enthusiastic
owners had met with outstanding success in breeding the rarest species of
pheasant and cracids (curassows and guans), but I had not had a chance
to visit them until last November, when I found them absolutely remark-
able, and although they have been mentioned before in American maga-
zines, particularly by Mr C. Sivelle (gazette, April and May 1975),
I feel that my experience should be recorded in the avicultural magazine
where I have for so many years described bird collections in the various
parts of the world.
These two Mexican collections are probably the largest, best installed
and cared for of their kind in existence at present. Senor Jose G. Zuno
Arce, a graduate economist, owns and manages an extensive estate at
Tuxpan which includes a vast cattle ranch, a large bee farm, besides his
collection of living wild birds. He also has various industrial, educational
and political interests in the State of Jalisco. At heart he is a bird-lover,
and the grounds where he has his home (and a beautiful guest house) as
well as his aviaries are situated in a high valley surrounded by wooded
hills and mountains, with a distant view of the Colima volcano, at an
altitude of 1,300 m. It enjoys a moderate climate, warm enough for
tropical plants and birds.
There are some 200 aviaries elaborately and elegantly built of steel and
slender concrete supports on solid vermin-proof foundations, with brick
walls and tiled-roof shelters at the back. They are good sized, a number
very large and high, containing tall avocado and other trees. They are all
adequately planted, landscaped and perfectly equipped for the comfort
of the various birds, and are set in a large well-kept garden where extensive
paddocks and waterfowl ponds are also to be found. Practical accommoda-
tion such as rooms for incubators, brooders, food storage and hospital are
modern and excellent. Gamebirds form the most important part of the
collection, but there are many other birds: several pairs of South African
Ostriches, one male semi-albinistic; grey and white Common Rheas,
Emus, different cranes, flamingos; Black, Black-necked and Coscoroba
Swans; several species of geese and ducks (Orinoco Geese and whistling
ducks do particularly well). Roomy aviaries are inhabited by crowned
pigeons of three species. Nutmeg and other pigeons and doves, parrots,
toucans, quetzals and trogons show themselves here and there among the
trees. A few hummingbirds are kept in cages and a tame pair live free in
the dining-room--an exquisite sight. All species of pheasant available at
present are kept and reared in numbers: I particularly noticed Argus,

peacock pheasants, firebacks, very tame Bulwer's Pheasants and Ocellated
Turkeys. There are also Roulroul and Bhutan Wood Partridges Arborophila
torqueola and the very rare tree partridges (Dendrortyx) of southern Mexico
and Central America, one species, D . macroura } breeding.
Curassows, guans and chachalacas, however, form perhaps the most
interesting part of the collection. The climate of Tuxpan suits them well,
as do the large high tree-planted flights in which they can fly up and down,
clamber among the branches and nest in the foliage. All species of curassow
with the exception of the very rare Blumenbach's and Southern Helmeted
are present; also many guans, some of which I had never before seen alive.
Among the most unusual are the two species of Sickle-winged Chamaepetes
gondoti and C . unicolor , the Wattled Aburria aburri and the Highland Guan
Penelopides nigra . The last named is peculiar among the guans in its
plumage: the male is entirely glossy black with very bright red legs, bill,
eyelids and gular wattle, and the female, slightly larger (a very curious and
unique difference among cracids), is brown barred with black, much as in
some female pheasants. These birds have been breeding well at Tuxpan
during the past three years, and I was able to observe immature males
with a barred brown juvenile plumage--a peculiar case in the family
where otherwise no distinctive juvenile plumage exists, the chicks assuming
immediately the adult plumage.
Perhaps the most sensational birds in the collection are three huge,
strange and beautiful Horned Guans Oreophasis derbianus from the high
volcanos of Southern Mexico and Guatemala, a striking and very rare
species. As big as curassows, thick-set but with shorter legs, their black
and pearl-grey colours, red horn, white eyes and curious bill give them an
extraordinary aspect. These three fine birds, tame and in perfect condition,
have been hand-reared from wild collected eggs. They are thought to be
two males and one female, but the sexes are alike in appearance.
Most species are represented by several pairs and are breeding, the
greatest success having been achieved with the Venezuelan Helmeted
Crax p . pauxiy of which a good number have been reared during the past
few years. Senor Zuno possesses one of the very rare buff-barred females,
an unusual colour phase, but she has so far produced only black young,
and he has recorded this in the gazette (June 1975). The climate of
Tuxpan has proved a little too warm for the more alpine and northern
pheasants, and Senor Zuno has recently built a series of aviaries a few
miles away at the altitude of i,8oo m. where he now keeps tragopans,
Koklas, the eared and copper pheasants under good conditions. All those
who have had the luck to visit Tuxpan will agree with me that Senor Zuno's
collection is well worth the trip, which is made a delight by the perfect
hospitality of the host.

enormous poultry farm and a laboratory., supplying most of the vaccines
used in the Mexican poultry industry. Dr. Estudillo lives in the neighbour-
hood of the capital city at an altitude of 2,200 m. where the weather is
never too hot, nor in winter cold enough to injure tropical birds. His 120
aviaries are very well and carefully built with walls and shelters of solid
materials, thickly planted and supplied with bushes and other nesting
places. They are disposed in several rows facing one another and separated
by large pens for pinioned and non-flying birds such as cranes, rheas and
cassowaries (Bennett's). Farther away is a large enclosure with ponds, the
home of flamingos, swans and other waterfowl, bustards, Andean Giant
Coots, three species of screamer and trumpeters. The smaller aviaries
measure 25 x 15 x 8 feet, while the larger ones are 60 x 20 x 12 feet and
contain fairly large trees, so necessary for arboreal birds such as curassows
and guans. There are many crowned pigeons, rare toucans, hornbills,
parrots, including four pairs of Hyacinthine Macaws living happily
together, other macaws and many cockatoos. Gamebirds, of course,
particularly cracids, are very numerous: there are two trios of Bulwer's
Wattled Pheasants, a species reared there for the first time in captivity in
1974, the parents having been brought from Borneo by Dr. Estudillo
himself. All the tragopans, firebacks and other species of pheasant now
available are well represented and breed regularly, as do Green Peafowl
and Ocellated Turkeys. Curassows and guans are, of course, a special
feature of the collection, all the curassows being represented except for the
Southern Helmeted Crax unicornis of which the Antwerp Zoo possesses
a pair sent by Charles Cordier from Bolivia and the very rare C. blumenbachi
from south-eastern Brazil that is on the verge of extinction, but was found
again by Dr. A. Ruschi in the State of Espirito Santo. I had recently the
opportunity of observing a live pair in the Sao Paulo Zoo, for the first time.
The male resembles that of the Wattled Curassow C. carunculata , but the
shape of the bill and the crest are more like that of the Blue-billed C.
alberti.
Most species of curassow have bred in Dr. Estudillo's aviaries--the
Great {rubra) since 1965, Wattled 1966, Blue-billed 1971, Razor-billed
1972, Crestless ( tomentosa ), Yellow-knobbed {daubentoni\ Venezuelan and
Colombian Helmeted (p. pauxi and p. gilliardi) Nocturnal Nothocrax
urumutum all since 1974. There is in the collection a very puzzling male
collected in Bolivia. It resembles in the general shape of the bill and crest
the Great Curassow, but it is a little smaller, has white tips to the tail
feathers and its bill knob is pale greenish-blue, quite unlike other species
in colour. It no doubt represents a still unknown form.
Guans and chachalacas are very numerous: Aburria aburri has been
breeding there since 1974 an d Chamaepetes goudoti since 1972, both for
the first time in captivity. Among the more unusual species, I noticed a
Pipile cumanensis , Penelope montagnii , P. superciliaris, P . obscura, P.

By A. J. Mobbs (Walsall, West Midlands)
To many aviculturists the Ruby-topaz Chrysolampis mosquitus is all that
a hummingbird should be; it is fairly small (approximately 3.1 inches
overall length) and the male has areas of highly iridescent plumage. Over
the years I have owned five of these birds, three males and two females,
but until I purchased my present male I had never witnessed any display,
although all the males I owned had sung regularly.
There is little doubt that, under the correct conditions, the Ruby-topaz
can prove extremely long-lived in confinement. In the past, I have quickly
grown tired of those I have owned and because of this have always parted
with them after a few months. The reason for this is that, even when
housed in a large communal flight with other hummingbirds, the Ruby-
topaz have usually spent most of their waking hours flying aimlessly to
and fro in one particular area, this usually being at one end of the flight,
with their flight path being only a matter of some 2 feet in length. One
male in particular would keep up this aimless flying for hours upon end
and eventually developed the habit of touching the polythene sheeting
(which makes up the end wall of the flight) with the tip of its beak each
time it reached the end of its flight. I have known a number of species to
indulge this seemingly aimless flying to and fro, especially those from the
genera Phaethornis , Glaucis 3 Coeligena and Urosticte. However, these birds
have always used the full length of the flight and the actual time spent in
this activity has usually been for a period of one hour or less first thing in
a morning. I have always considered these birds to be using up excess
energy, but cannot say whether or not this is so with the Ruby-topaz
as its aimless flying appears to be somewhat akin to the almost tireless
pacing of certain mammals in confinement.
The adult male Ruby-topaz in my collection at the present time was
well used to captivity when it came to me, having been in the country
some six years. The bird was released into my communal hummingbird

flight immediately and setttled in without problems. After a few days the
bird began the flying to and fro described earlier; however, within a
fortnight the bird had ceased this activity and had begun to show traits
never before seen by me in the species, for not only did the bird begin to
display regularly but was also seen attempting to mate with other birds
with which it was housed and to perform false mating actions on the leaves
of plants growing in the flight.
In the past, large numbers of Ruby-topaz have been brought into
Britain and there cannot be many aviculturists (or zoos and bird gardens)
interested in hummingbirds who have not owned at least one male at
some time, yet never have I seen details of the display published.
Admittedly, articles on the Trochilidae are few and far between, as few
aviculturists appear to write on the hummingbirds they have owned;
however, had the display of this species been witnessed, I feel certain
I would have heard about it either directly or indirectly.
In my opinion, the reason my present male displays regularly is solely
because plant pollen has been added to its diet (for details of how to add
pollen to the diet of hummingbirds, see Mobbs 1974). For a hummingbird
to perform the mating display, it needs to be in breeding condition, and
although many species can be brought into such condition without the aid
of pollen, from the experiments I have carried out over the years it is
obvious that if certain species are to be brought into breeding condition
they require the extra nutriments pollen provides. I have mentioned in an
earlier article (Mobbs 1974) that pollen is a definite help when attempting
to establish the more delicate hummingbird species. A species which is
far from delicate, yet was not seen to display (in captivity) until pollen
was added to its diet, is the Stripe-breasted Starthroat Heliomaster
squamosus. Over the years I have owned two male Stripe-breasted, yet
not until pollen was added to my birds' diet did I witness the fantastic
mating display of this species. As further proof, I obtained for a friend a
fully established male Stripe-breasted which was in superb condition. This
bird had not been given pollen in its diet and had never been seen to dis-
play, although as with all the Heliomaster , it had proved a most persistent
songster. Within a week or so of being given pollen, it was seen to display
and has since done so regularly except when in the moult.
When displaying, the male Ruby-topaz hovers in front of the object of
display, with the body held in the horizontal position; the head is drawn
into the shoulders slightly and is held a little lower than the body. All the
iridescent feathers (i.e. those of the crown, chin, throat and upper breast)
are held very tighdy against the body, giving the appearance of glowing
metal. The tail feathers are fanned slightly and the bird moves from side
to side pendulum fashion. After repeating the movement for approxi-
mately 20 seconds, drawing closer to the object of display as it does so,
should the bird to which the display is directed remain placid, the
Ruby-topaz will fly to the rear of the bird and attempt to mate. Should the

<bodyText confidence="0.998862022222222" page_id="56386379"  page_num="55" year="" vol="">
Ruby-topaz direct its display to a leaf, then it will attempt to alight directly
on to the latter and go through the actions of mating. Should the bird to
which the display has been directed leave the perch, the Ruby-topaz will
give chase, still holding the iridescent feathering tightly against the body.
After being pursued by the Ruby-topaz, should the bird alight on a perch
again the former will again go through the display procedure already
described.
As already mentioned, males of Ruby-topaz can be heard to sing
regularly whether or not pollen is added to their diet; however, a bird
which has been given pollen appears to display a more aggressive attitude
when singing in that it always directs the song toward another humming-
bird. These attitudes are most noticeable, especially when the Ruby-topaz
directs its song toward a bird which is perched anywhere but directly in
front. To give an example: when a bird to which the song is being directed
is perched to one side of the Ruby-topaz, the latter will turn the head so
as to look directly toward the perched bird. Usually, a singing humming-
bird holds the head directly to the front, as it would when resting. The
whole time the Ruby-topaz is singing, the iridescent feathers are held
tightly against the body. The song of the Ruby-topaz, although relatively
simple, is somewhat difficult to describe in words, ffrench (1973) states
that the "voice" of C. mosquitus is "A light, rather high-pitched single
note, tsip". This, however, is a description of the call-note only, which is
used mainly when the bird is agitated-- e.g. 3 after a skirmish with another
hummingbird or upon sighting a predator. The actual song comprises
four drawn-out notes (with emphasis made on the fourth), which have a
somewhat insect-like quality about them.
Under captive conditions. Ruby-topaz Hummingbirds appear to have
an aversion to water and rarely can one be persuaded to take a bath in a
saucer of water. Some will perch on the edge of a receptacle and dip the
head and breast feathers in, but I have never witnessed one enter the
water as most hummingbirds do. My present male appears to be a little
more adventurous than others I have owned and will in fact hover above
the water, dipping the head and tail feathers in as it does so. This bird
will also allow me to hand-spray it occasionally. Because of this apparent
dislike to water, the Ruby-topaz housed with other hummingbirds often
become soiled with the latter's droppings and may look a sorry sight by
the time the annual moult draws near.
Although Ruby-topaz can be moulted without difficulty, for a humming-
bird the period of the moult is somewhat lengthy. Most species take on
average some ten weeks to complete a moult (the Horned Sungem
Heliactin cornuta being an exception as it can take as long as 34 weeks
(Mobbs 1973)), whereas the Ruby-topaz takes on average some 19 weeks
to complete the process. Ruby-topaz will shed large areas of feathers
and the new feathers come in before a further patch is shed. This does
appear to be a most unusual way for a hummingbird to moult and C.

mosquitus could be unique in this respect. Perhaps I should point out that
it is the body feathers only which are moulted in this way, those of the
secondaries, primaries and rectrices being moulted in the usual manner.
The Ruby-topaz has a vast range and can be found in Trinidad and
Tobago, Colombia, Venezuela, the islands of the coast, the Guianas and
Brazil. Peters (1945) lists no subspecies; however, I have found that birds
taken from different areas can differ greatly, both in size and intensity of
colouring. Certain males can be found to have elongated head feathers
(hence their other common name. Red-crested Hummingbird), whereas
others will have feathers so short they give the appearance of being more
like velvet than feathers.
Adult males have the entire crown and nape glittering ruby-red; chin,
throat and upper breast glittering golden-yellow; the hind-neck and
upper back velvety black and the remainder of the upperparts dark
bronze-olive. Underparts are greyish-brown with the under tail-coverts
orange-rufous; tail feathers chestnut, tipped black.
Females are coppery green above with the entire underparts greyish-
white; central tail feathers are bronzy green; remainder chestnut with a
subterminal black band and a white tip. Immature males are very much
like the females but have the outer feathers violet, tipped white. An even
greater aid to identification is the thin line of glittering golden-yellow
which often appears on the throat soon after fledging.

The emphasis that was placed on the breeding programme in 1976
yielded some pleasing results. Ratites such as Greater Rhea, Ostrich and
Emu continued to propagate in fair numbers, as did waterfowl and
gamebirds. Successes with these two groups included 6 Nenes, 2 Garganey,

continued to be prolific. Unfortunately, infertile eggs were produced by
our pairs of Great Indian Hornbills and Red-billed Ground Cuckoos.
Specimens of Sams, Stanley and East African Crowned Crane were once
again reared. Even though 20 Crowned Crane eggs were produced in
1976, fertility was low and chicks were often extremely weak and listless.
Several Caribbean Flamingo eggs were artificially incubated and hatched;
however, attempts at hand rearing 10 young proved futile. We hope that
the experience gained by us in these attempts can be applied to future
efforts of this type. We will no doubt be faced with this problem again, as
it is necessary to collect flamingo eggs from nests in order to avoid predation
by cage mates. The most noteworthy event for the bird department in
1976 was the successful hatching and rearing of a Bateleur Eagle Tera-
thopius ecaudatus. This no doubt constitutes an avicultural first.
Major construction for the year consisted of a complete remodelling of
the two penguin exhibits that are located in the zoo's Aquatic House. The
sterile looking ceramic tile was covered with styrofoam and fibreglass in
an effort to simulate typical Antarctic terrain. Misting devices and timed
lighting systems were also installed. Minor projects such as the completion
of three new crane exhibits were also undertaken. These are constructed
merely of chain-link fencing, but they do provide adequate breeding areas.
The usual redecorating of interior Bird House exhibits was occasionally
undertaken to accommodate particular new specimens such as Tawny
Frogmouths, Green Wood Hoopoes, Andean Cocks of the Rock and
Black-necked Aracaris.

species have.
Unlike our other breeding pairs of cranes, the specimens of B. r.
gibbericeps are maintained as a group, eight to be exact, in a large outdoor
mixed aviary that measures 69.5 m. long, 25.6 wide and 15.2 m. high.
There are numerous visual barriers within the exhibit, such as a large
rock waterfall, various types of foliage and a public walkway, that offer
each breeding pair enough seclusion to form a territory. The diets that the
cranes receive varies between seasons. From October ist-March 31st
they are offered a composition of 50 per cent (pelleted) Gamebird
Maintenance Chow and 50 per cent (pelleted) Gamebird Layena, as well
as supplemental chopped greens. From April ist-September 30th the diet
is changed to 75 per cent (pelleted) Gamebird Layena and 25 per cent
(pelleted) Trout Chow. The greens are then omitted and replaced with a
commercial bird of prey diet. Experience has shown us that the cranes
utilize the chows more efficiently when they are offered in pelleted forms
of the same size, in this case No. 4. This prevents one product from being
consumed more than another, thus preventing a nutritional imbalance.
All of the East African Crowned Cranes are hatched and reared artificially.
Eggs of this species have traditionally been produced during July, August
and September. Eggs are removed from the meagre nest of sticks and
gravel as soon as possible for two reasons: it increases egg production
from the pairs and it minimizes losses due to predation or breakage by
cage mates. After each egg is collected it is weighed, measured, numbered
and placed in a Humidaire Model 50 forced air incubator. Since our
pheasant and crane chicks had been plagued in the past with crooked toes
and feet, it was felt that hand turning the eggs 180 degrees four times daily
would eliminate the problem (even though this unit is capable of automatic
rotation, it only rotates 90 degrees). Crooked feet or toes in crane chicks
are now encountered only rarely and for unknown reasons.
The dry bulb temperature of the incubation unit is maintained at
99J to 99f degrees Fahrenheit, while the wet bulb temperature is kept
between 86-88 degrees F. and this produces a relative humidity of 58 to
64 per cent within the unit. Eggs are candled periodically to check fertility
and to monitor air cell development. Within two to three days of the due
date the egg is transferred to the hatching shelves of a Humidaire Model 14
"Gooser". The dry bulb temperature here is the same; however, the wet
bulb fluctuates between 86 and 90 degrees F., thus producing a relative
humidity of 54 to 70 per cent.
In the past, chicks of this species would peck into the air cell, weaken
and die, possibly from suffocation. This problem is now overcome by
drilling a small hole, approximately .32 cm. in diameter, into the air
cell after the chick has made its entry from 8 to 12 hours. This provides
adequate air for the young crane while it finishes the job of pecking out
or until it goes through the process of being manually broken from the
shell. Chicks remain in the hatching unit until their plumage is dry and

they appear alert. An antiseptic is then sprayed on the lower belly at the
location where the yolk sac has withdrawn into the body. This serves as a
protective against possible bacterial infections. From the hatching area,
the chick is transferred to a cubicle-like structure that measures .97 m.
long, .5 wide and .38 m. in depth. The front .13 m. of the cubicle is
taken up by a floor-level gutter that is covered by removable .64 cm.
screening.
The water dish is placed on this, so that any spillage falls into the gutter
rather than into the brooding area. The remaining floor space is covered
by indoor-outdoor carpeting (non-rubber backed). Two pieces of carpeting
are available for each cubicle, and since these are changed daily, one is in
use while the other is being cleaned. The carpet has proved to be an
excellent medium upon which to raise cranes. It provides good footing, a
warm substrate and a satisfactory surface on which to offer both live and
inanimate food objects. An adjustable overhead infra-red lamp provides
the main source of heat.
Young crowned cranes are not fed for the first 36-48 hours of their
lives. Instead, they are offered a 5 per cent solution of penicillin/
streptomycin (Flox-aid) and water. A diet of mealworms, crickets, chick
startena, grated hard-boiled egg, chopped greens and pieces of the
commercial bird of prey diet is then presented. Supplements of two No. 4
gelatin capsules of Theralin (a multi-vitamin) and one No. 4 gelatin
capsule of dicalcium phosphate are also given daily. These are offered to
assist the prevention of calcium-phosphorus deficiencies that often inhibit
proper bone growth in birds of this type. Hand-feeding is discouraged;
however, it has often been found necessary in stimulating this species to
accept food. Weight gain and loss is monitored on a daily basis. Chicks of
this subspecies weigh an average of 85 grams at time of hatching and usually
lose 10-15 grams for the first two or three days. Assuming there are no
complications, weight gains should be evident by the fifth or sixth day.
The amount of weight gain per day will vary; however, it is very important
to prevent overfeeding and excessive gain, as this will usually result in
irreversible leg problems.
After approximately four weeks, the hard-boiled egg is omitted from
the diet. The Theralin capsules are increased to four per day and the
dicalcium phosphate to two.
The crane will remain on this diet for roughly the next five months.
When the young bird attains a size at which it can no longer be safely
confined to the brooding cubicle, it is transferred to a much larger walk-in
cage. In time, mineral supplements are decreased to one No. 00 gelatin
capsule of each product per day until it is no longer warranted.

both societies, including a mounted specimen of a tragopan and a valuable
book on pheasants. Thanks are due to members who so generously donated
items in aid of the funds of the Avicultural Society. The auction was
followed by the showing of three Anglia TV "Survival" films including a
fascinating look at the life of the Blue Tit with sequences filmed inside
the nest where a large brood was being reared. As usual a wide range of
avicultural books and magazines were on sale.

BREEDING THE MALAY PEACOCK PHEASANT AT THE
NEW YORK ZOOLOGICAL PARK
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.990386818181818" page_id="56386393"  page_num="" year="" vol="">
By Donald Bruning (Curator of Birds)
The beautiful Malay Peacock Pheasant Polyplectron malacense malacense
was first imported to Europe around 1870 and a pair bred at Beaujardin,
France between 1884-1886. Pairs of these peacock pheasants were kept
at Cleres between 1925 and 1940, but they never bred and Jean Delacour
stated in the pheasants of the world, published in 1951, that: "they are
beautiful birds but no doubt difficult to keep."
In September 1969 the New York Zoological Society acquired two pairs
from the Siam Wildlife Company and initially both pairs were kept in
planted aviaries approximately three metres wide and seven metres deep,
a small attached shelter serving as a winter holding area for the wire mesh
aviary. One pair produced two infertile eggs and one fertile egg in 1971.
The fertile egg developed fully but the chick died while hatching: in 1972
only one infertile egg was produced.
During 1973 the breeding pair was moved into a large planted aviary at
the new World of Birds building. The first egg produced in this large
exhibit proved fertile and it hatched on December nth: unfortunately the
chick only lived two days. Within two weeks the female had produced
another egg which hatched on January nth, 1974. The female seemed to
be caring for the chick, so a decision was made to leave it with its parents.
The parents fed and brooded the chick regularly and it grew rapidly.
Three additional young were reared in 1974 and four were reared in
1975. Up to this point all the birds produced were from the one original
pair and all except two chicks were males. 1976 turned out to be a banner
year for the Malayans, as the second adult pair started producing fertile
eggs and one young pair of birds produced their first egg which unfortu-
nately was infertile. Ten young were produced during the year from the
two breeding pairs, while in addition to the success at the New York
Zoological Park, a young male reared here in 1974 and sent to Iain Grahame
in England successfully mated with his female and produced two chicks.
Malayan Peacock Pheasants produce only one egg in each clutch. Each
egg averages 40.4 grams but may vary from 30 g for young birds to a
maximum of 42 g. Adult females produce eggs weighing between 39 and

42 g, and normal incubation varies between 22-23 days.
Young Malay Peacock Pheasants weigh between 24 and 28 g at hatching.
When hand-rearing the chicks, they must be fed from forceps, tiny meal-
worms (Tenehrio larvae) being ideal for the first few days. By the second
or third day the chicks will readily pick up mealworms dropped in front
of them. By dropping mealworms into small food pans the chicks rapidly
start picking at other food, and within a day or two the chicks should be
eating prepared poultry feed and chopped greens along with a few meal-
worms. Chicks lose 2 to 4 g. during their first 24-48 hours, but should be
back to original hatching weight by the third or fourth day. Healthy
chicks then gain from 2-4 g. daily for the next week or two. Growth slows
to 1-2 g. daily during the next two or three weeks.
Determining the sexes of young birds is quite difficult; however the
more rounded shape of the "eyes" on feathers of the back, longer tail and
more obvious crest are all indications of a male. Males also walk about
holding their heads and bodies in a more upright posture. Spurs do not
start developing on young males until they are ten to twelve months old.
One young female produced her first egg when she was only eight months
old, but unfortunately the egg was broken.
Both Delacour (1951) and Beebe (1921) state that "the cock has a full
frontal display." The two adult pairs and their offspring here at the New
York Zoological Park regularly display laterally. This lateral display is
very similar to that seen in the Palawan Peacock Pheasant Polyplectron
emphanum. During this display the Malay Peacock Pheasants spread their
tail feathers into a large fan while erecting the crest as well as neck feathers.
The spread tail is tilted to either side depending on the location of the
female. At the same time the wings are partially opened and tilted to greatly
enlarge the area of the display pattern on the tail, wings and back.
Crest feathers are erected to such an extent that the foremost feathers
of the crest point forward over the bird&amp;apos;s bill. The rest of the crest forms
a uniform arch from the longer forward pointing feathers to the shorter
feathers of the neck. Feathers of the head and neck are maintained in an
erect posture, which makes the head and neck appear to be much larger
than they really are. The male may even take a few steps while displaying.
Display usually lasts anywhere from a few seconds to a few minutes.

Balearica pavonina
By Newton R. Steel (Stoke Fleming, Devon)
It was in March 1965 that I paid my first visit to Kenya and, whilst
camping in the Serengeti, saw my first pair of Grey-necked Crowned
Cranes, known out there as Kavirondo, on account of their migrating and
being in such large numbers around the gulf of that name.
This particular visit of only a fortnight was so taken up with visiting
the game reserves that I had no time to pursue my desire to have a pair
of these beautiful birds. Little did I imagine that only five months later
I would be out there again--this time at the invitation of the East African
Guernsey Breeders' Association to judge the cattle at the Nairobi Show
and to be the Association's guest for a month. The kindness and hospitality
of the eight farms at which I stayed during my three weeks' tour of the
country has to be experienced to be believed by an ordinary Englishman.
Everyone seemed to know that I was extremely interested in bird life and
went out of their way to show me as much of it as possible during my
short stays with them. I let it be known that I was most interested in obtain-
ing some of the cranes, and various enquiries were made. Mr David
Roberts had none available at that time, but word got through that a lady
close to the Ugandan border, whose husband was manager of one of
Brooke Bond tea plantations, had three young cranes. When my host told
me that it was about 90 miles away, I said, "Oh, it is much too far to go",
but he replied, "Nonsense! we will go tomorrow morning!" So we set
off with a sandwich lunch, but when we arrived we found that the good
people had gone for a shopping expedition to Kitale, but would be back
for lunch. In the meantime we ate our sandwiches and were very interested
in dozens of nests of Black Weavers, suspended from a tree over our heads.
Unfortunately, there were no fledglings available, which was ascertained
by one of the boys climbing the tree to investigate. When our hosts re-
turned, they were so thrilled to meet some new Europeans that a second
lunch had to be eaten! During the conversation, I enquired of my hosts
whether it was true that they had three young cranes, was told it was and
was shown these three, living with the domestic fowl in a run. At that time
they were some 15 in. high and I was told they were about five weeks old.
I now know this to be correct, as at about that age my own young cranes
were at the same stage of feathering or just showing a little, almost pin-
cushion-like topknot in place of the golden crown.
I still had two or three farms to visit and so these three young cranes
had to be transported around in a tea chest and at each stay were best
accommodated in the bathroom, where the night's mess was easily disposed
of. The only food I was able to offer them was dog-meal, not even biscuits.

and a little raw meat. At the last stay before flying home they were able
to have two days in a pen on some good grass, which helped to freshen
and get them clean.
The next problem to be solved was how I would manage to get them
aboard. By personal introduction to the particular airline manager and a
telephone call by him to the airport, to expect a crazy European with a
consignment of birds destined for Gatwick, I was duly rushed through
Customs. Unfortunately, all this has come to an end now and one is beset
by forms and regulations and quarantine, which will impede considerably
the importation of new stock. Perhaps very necessary, but very disappoint-
ing for the casual importer.
Having arrived back in Sussex with my precious load, I had previously
taken the precaution to send detailed instructions to instal four infra-red
lamps-- i.e. 1,000 watts--in the ceiling of a nice warm cow-calving box
in readiness for their arrival because, remember, they were coming from
a lovely warm climate to a period of at least four months of our winter
weather.
I continued to feed them on puppy-meal, softened with boiling water,
to which was also added minced meat. They consumed vast quantities
and the next problem was that their body weight outgrew their leg strength
and they went down on their hocks, but with the addition of cod liver oil
and the reduction in the raw meat they were very soon up and about again.
I would add here that I find this a common fault with such heavy birds
as Brown Eared Pheasants and the rather weaker bird, the Siamese
Fireback, and I am convinced that with certain birds that do not acquire
or absorb sufficient vitamin D and minerals from their staple diet, their
bodies grow faster than their legs can support. The easiest cure for phea-
sants is the administering of halibut oil capsules. One a week for a month
seems to be right, provided they are noticed early enough.
The cranes continued to grow apace out of their fawn, rather fluffy
attire, and the white wing feathers started to appear, their topknots chang-
ing from what had looked like a cut-off shaving brush into their long
golden crowns, by about the age of three months. They continued to be
housed in the shed, thermostatically controlled, until well into the spring,
when they were moved for the summer into a small orchard, with a shelter
into which they were driven at night, until such time as they had their
full adult plumage, but even then they were shut in at night through the
winter months, because of the danger of frost-bitten feet.
It was not until the late autumn of 1967 that I moved from Sussex to
Devonshire. The three cranes continued to live their life in a half-acre
paddock, surrounded on three sides by pheasant aviaries and from about
the end of October, when there was a possibility of frost, they were driven
in each night between the pheasant aviaries, along a garden path and into
an open-fronted shed, the front of which had an 18 x 4 ft. passageway.
They had become so accustomed to this routine that one now only needed

to drive them out of the first gate to the paddock and they found their
own way! Only when the weather is at its most severe is the door of the
shed ever closed, but it is interesting to note from their droppings that
quite obviously they both stand close side by side inside this small shed,
a matter of 4 x 3 ft.
Their diet has consisted of turkey breeders' pellets, or ordinary laying
pellets, with half wheat, but from January onwards they receive only the
layers' pellets. They consume a large volume of water and like to have an
earthenware sink to bathe and stand in. And, of course, they consume a
large amount of wild insect life in the rough grass of the paddock.
During the intervening years, they have done their ritual of dancing with
wings wide open, picking up bits of grass and straw, dropping them down,
and dancing around them. It was not until some time in July 1974 that
they were seen mating and they then commenced building a nest of dried
grasses and straws. The nest was some 2\ to 3 ft. in diameter, but of no
real thickness, and three weeks to the day from mating an egg appeared,
not on the nest but some 4 or 5 yds. distant. I then had to decide whether
to put the egg on the nest or whether to leave well alone. I reckoned that
a nest was not built for nothing, so placed it on the nest in the early even-
ing; to my horror, the next morning a large hole had been bashed in it
and the contents were missing, so feeling that another egg should be laid
in another day, I filled the broken egg with sand, which stuck nicely to
the inside, and returned the egg to the nest, with the hole downwards.
The following morning no sign of it, not even of shell chippings, but no
further egg was laid that year. However, at least I had the satisfaction of
knowing one must be a hen, because visually there is absolutely no
distinction whatsoever to the ordinary onlooker, other than the fact that
the male, as we know him to be, is that much bolder and thicker in the
neck. We know him, because when you approach and tease them and make
him a little angry, he blushes in the lovely white skin of his face, whereas
the hen does not.
We contentedly waited for the next summer--1975--when to our delight
on July 19th, an egg appeared, this time laid a matter of about 6 ft. from
the remains of the previous year's nest (which, incidentally, had been
added to and renovated slightly--I might say that on each occasion their
nest site has been in amongst thistles, docks and long grass, a patch that
we left for them after their first nest-building started).
Having learnt my lesson from moving the egg the previous year, I
left well alone and on the 21st a second egg appeared at 7.00 p.m. The
parents seemed particularly restless: however, the following day, the
22nd, they commenced to form a nest around the two eggs, sitting over
them and pulling bits of straw and dead grass around. My diary on the
23rd states "Cranes sitting at last" and on the 24th I have a note: "Third
egg laid 23rd; sitting all day; off feeding at 7.45 p.m.", thus revealing the
third egg. From then until the 28th they were never off the nest, so which

precise day the fourth egg was laid we have no certain knowledge, but it
was seen on the 28th, when she rose at our approach. Their diet from now
on continued as before. They added somewhat to their nest, which was
never more than 4 in. high and nicely dished to the centre.
Reckoning from the second egg, I expected the hatching to be due on
August 21 st, but nothing was visible and no approach was made, but on
Saturday, 23rd at 8,00 a.m. one egg had gone and no chick visible, but two
of the remaining three had holes in and cheeping could be heard. At
7.00 p.m. the same day, two little reddy-brown chicks and one egg were
in the middle of the nest, but no sign of any broken shells. The third egg
hatched on the 25th but it was not until about a week later that we found
the dead body of the first chick that hatched. My own idea is that one of
the parents was so excited and delighted that it picked the chick up and
threw it in the air, because it was some ten or fifteen yards from the nest
and could by no stretch of the imagination have walked there. The day
it hatched, I am quite certain no predator would have dared go near; the
parents are much too vicious at this time and it is not even safe for us to
approach them.
The three chicks continued on the nest for a couple of days, by which
time No. 3 had started to move and all were then taken on a foraging
expedition in the long grass outside the immediate clump. Their heads
and beaks seemed out of proportion to their bodies and of course their
legs rather long. They follow either parent, both being most attentive to
the chicks. They take them always in the long grass and trample it down
in a most interesting fashion with their shoulders half raised, but the
wings not extended and stamp round and round until they see some
insect. It is then picked up and fed beak to beak to the chick or chicks.
They sometimes walk right down to the bottom of the paddock and back
again even at this early stage. The next interesting occasion was teaching
the chick to feed, going through the same motions and treading to disturb
the insects and, on seeing one, not picking it up immediately, but pointing
with its beak two or three times at the insect and at the same time emitting
a grunting "Ugh, ugh, ugh", the insect then being picked up by either
parent or chick. This form of feeding continues for three weeks and it is
not until then that the young are brought up to feed at the dish which
has throughout this period been supplied with turkey starter crumbs, and
rearing pellets for the benefit of the adults. At age three weeks, at the
evening feed, a few gentles rolled in a vitamin powder are added. It is
quite useless putting gentles there in the morning, because they are
always devoured by wild birds, but after about 7.00 p.m. the Starlings
have gone.
I think perhaps the next most interesting stage is when they are about a
month to six weeks old, then they really start to move around the paddock
with their parents every two hours. It is interesting to note that right up
to a month old they return to the nest every night between 7.00 and 7.30

p.m. and are brooded. At three weeks old they were caught and pinioned,
their wings being rather like those of waterfowl, more full of blood quills
than are the pheasant family, so there is naturally a little bit of bleeding,
which we endeavour to safeguard by a puff of sulphonamide powder, this
helping to keep the flies at bay. I like to leave two of the inner primaries,
otherwise the wing looks so stunted when it grows later. It is vitally
necessary to have the pinioning done before the chicks are eight weeks
old, as the body is so light and wings so large as to enable the birds to
fly off*. I learnt my lesson the hard way with the first Demoiselle I bred--it
flew away at nine weeks old!
To this day, in February 19773 these three chicks are now completing
their adult plumage moult and grace my front lawn, despite the damage to
some flower beds. For some reason or other, they seem to have lost some
of their toenails, how I really do not know, and one has had a very swollen
foot, which, although with injections and antibiotics it has gone down,
appears to be completely dead, but no-one would suspect it if they saw it
walking around.
What sex they are I have no idea, but I am certain there is one pair.
Here I should perhaps add that whilst I was in hospital in 1968, the first
summer down here, two of the birds I brought back from Kenya set about
the third, which those in charge at the time did the right thing to remove
in the first instance, but the wrong thing in the second, a few days later,
when it had recovered from this assault, they returned it to the fold,
whereupon it was killed by the other two.
1976 augured well for another breeding, especially with such an
unusually good summer. It was therefore not surprising when the cranes
laid their first egg on June 30th, between 5.00 and 8.00 p.m., not on the
nest, which had apparently been prepared, but some yards away by the
water trough. The second egg was laid on July 2nd, this time on the nest,
so I put the first egg with it. A third egg was laid on the 4th and on the
6th a fourth egg was laid by the gate to the paddock, which was some
12 to 15 yds. away from the nest. I put it on the nest: on the 8th I noted
that the cranes were easily disturbed and I noticed only three eggs on the
nest, but later that day they were sitting quietly. From this day on an
egg disappeared each day with no sign whatsoever of any shells, until
there was only one left. This I removed and put under a bantam. It was
fertile and developed to within about a week of hatching; I suspect the
broody was not able to give it sufficient heat for its final hatching. A further
two weeks later, on 25th July, the first egg of the second clutch appeared,
this time on the nest. The 27th saw the second laid, between 5.00 and
10.00 p.m. The third egg was laid on the 29th and one must assume the
fourth was on the 31st as on 1st August the cranes were brooding closely.
All went according to plan and two chicks hatched on the 28th, so an
incubation period of four weeks is the rule. In the evening of Monday,
30th all four eggs had hatched. The last, however, remained on the nest

for the whole of the next day, whilst the first three were taken on their
first foraging, all, of course, returning to the nest after a little while to be
brooded.
From then on the routine of the previous year was followed; however the
poor little chick that was the last to hatch always seemed to be that much
behind the others and, I am sorry to say that it died at about ten days old.
It had never seemed able to keep up with the others and I think it might
have survived had we restricted the area over which they were able to
roam during the first few days, but with the hot dry summer there was
also, no doubt, a lack of the right food. However, the others developed
apace, as their brothers and sisters had done the year before. They were
pinioned at three weeks old and finally weaned in late November, thus
making what I believe to be only the second successful breeding in cap-
tivity (breeding as in nature as distinct from artificial incubation and rear-
ing) of these very elegant and interesting birds. The dark form was bred
by Dr Amadei in Italy during 1968 (see avicultural magazine 1969,
vol. 75, no. 2).
My birds are presumably of the race gibbericeps , also known as the East
African Crowned Crane.
As described, the Grey-necked Crowned Crane Balearica pavonina has
been bred by Mr Newton Steel and this is believed to be a first success,
but anyone knowing of a previous breeding of this species in Great Britain
or Northern Ireland is asked to inform the Hon. Secretary.

THE BREEDING AND BEHAVIOUR OF THE BUSH PETRONIA
Petronia dentata
By Jeffrey Trollope (Hounslow, Middlesex)

Bush Petronias, like their congenerics, are rather drab members of the
Ploceidae, although their behaviour in an aviary is lively and interesting.
This paper describes the breeding and behaviour of captive P. dentata;
some comparisons are made with Passer domesticus referring to the
excellent study of this species made by Summers-Smith (1963).
It would appear the only record of a breeding for the genus Petronia in
the U.K. is that of Meade-Waldo (1896-97) who bred P. petronia. P.
dentata was bred in Finland by Enehjelm (1956)3 recording the species as
the Lesser Rock Sparrow and giving the generic name of Gymnoris. Gruson
(1976) records six species for the genus Petronia:
Pale Rock Sparrow P. brachydactyla.
Bush Petronia P. dentata.
Yellow-spotted Petronia P. pyrgita.
P. xanthocollis.
P. superciliaris.
P. petronia.
In Peters' Check-list (1962)3 pyrgita^ super ciliaris, dentata and xantho-
collis are considered as a superspecies, superciliaris (Yellow-throated

winter, Irides dark brown; a very small white stripe immediately
above eye, over this is a well defined gingery-brown stripe, extending
behind eye. The forehead, crown, nape and cheeks are grey; neck
gingery-brown. Chin and throat greyish-white with a yellow spot
at the base of the white area. Wings and back dark brown with a few

the Sudan (south of about 14 deg. north), western Eritrea, south-west
Arabia (near Hodeida and north of Aden [Peters 1962]). Mackworth-
Praed and Grant (i960) record that in eastern Africa it is a lowland species,
always a tree bird and not settling on rocks for choice. The species feeds
on the ground but also searches tree branches for insects.
Birds and housing
One pair of dentata and one cock were purchased in June 1972 ; a further
pair and one cock were purchased in October. The birds were rung with
coloured identification rings and housed in box cages measuring: 1.5 x
0.5 x 0.75 m. high. These cages were in an outside garden bird room,
heated at approx. 50* F. (io* C.) and artificial light until 20:30 hrs. was
provided from October until March. From these birds one pair (pair A)
were released into an aviary (No. 2) (which measured 3.25 x 1.5 x 2.25 m.
high) in April 1974. These birds showed no breeding activity and were
housed in a box cage during the winter of 1974/75.
Food and feeding
The birds are fed on a mixture of brown, yellow and panicum millets,
canary mixture and live food, mainly maggots. Sprouting soaked seed
and other greenfood such as chickweed and seeding grasses are offered in
season. Cuttlefish (crushed), fine grit and oystershell are always available.
The birds will eat most live foods offered but not white worms: seeding
grasses are always received with interest.
Breeding
Pair A were housed in a box cage in the outside birdroom during the
spring and summer of 1975. This cage which measured 1.75 x 0.5 x
0.80 m. high had a built-in Budgerigar nest box at one end. Apple twig
perches were fixed at each end of the cage. The birds were rather nervous
and although they rarely roosted in the box, they would fly into it if
frightened. On 19th May, the hen was observed flying into the box carrying
grass stems which had been given as food. On the 21st more material had
been taken into the box and a crude cup-shaped nest had been made. I
placed a handful of chicken breast feathers into the cage and later in the
day the nest was nearly covered in these feathers. The nest was examined
at 20:30 hrs. on the 22nd and no eggs had been laid. At 08:3c hrs. on the
23rd the hen was on the nest, nearly covered in feathers; she flew out
and there was an egg in the nest: a second egg was laid on the 24th. The
cock shared incubation but it would appear that his share was less than
that of the hen. The cock was seen carrying material to the nest (feathers
and grass stems) during this period.
No further eggs were laid and two chicks were hatched in the morning
of 6th June. I had been offering maggots and white worms before the
young hatched; after hatching, greenfly and other various insects were

provided. The chicks when gaping for food displayed a yellow edged
pinkish gape. One bird was dead and thrown out of the nest on the 8th;
the second chick was also found out of the nest and dead on the 9th. These
mortalities were due to the lack of suitable live food as the birds would
not take white worms and showed little interest in maggots. The pair
displayed no further breeding activity in 1975 and were released into an
aviary (No. 2) in 1976. This aviary had an earth floor and clumps of gorse
were hung up on the sides and roof for cover. Various nesting receptacles
were provided; these included wire cups and boxes, half-open wooden
nest boxes, large waxbill-type baskets and nest boxes. The birds shared
the aviary with a pair of Masked Hawfinches Coccothraustes personatus
and a pair of Gold-billed Ground Doves Columbina cruziana.

On 31st March both the male and female were seen taking grass stems
into a nest box, 1.5 m. from the floor. The first egg was laid on April 5th;
three eggs were laid and it appeared that incubation commenced with the
first. The cock and hen were observed taking feathers into the box after
the first egg was laid. The birds were very wary of entering the box as if
they thought they were being watched, even if the observer was 4 m. away,
so binoculars were used to observe them.
Three chicks hatched on April 22nd; both parents were seen taking
live food into the box on this day. A wide variety of live food was provided
by forking over a pile of rotting vegetation which had been placed in the
aviary in preparation. Maggots were also provided, but the parents were
not observed taking these into the box. Insects and spiders were also
collected from nettle beds and the collection was tipped into the aviary
twice daily. The cock was seen removing faecal sacs from the nest box
and on some occasions the female was seen carrying a faecal sac from the
nest.
At 09:00 hrs. on May 5th two chicks were seen to leave the box: both
birds fluttered to the floor, but later were seen perching and moving with
co-ordination. The third chick left the box at 15:00 hrs. the same day.
On May 6th I rung the chicks with coloured rings: the parents were very
bold when I caught the chicks, flying right up to my face and head. They
were very vocal and excited: one chick gave a high pitched cry when being
rung. A crowd of House Sparrows flew to the aviary roof and joined with
the parents in the clamour and mobbing display.
An egg was laid in the same nest on May nth and altogether six were
laid; it would appear that the hen began incubation with the first. The
chicks roosted in the box with both parents with the exception of the first

night they were out of the nest when they roosted on perches. During this
period the male was seen feeding the chicks with maggots and seed. The
hawfinches had ignored the petronias up to this time, but from May 14th
the cock hawfinch began to chase the cock petronia and chicks from the
feeding station. This aggression became very marked on the 16th when
the chicks were observed to be feeding themselves. On May 17th I
removed the parents and chicks to another aviary and six eggs from the
nest box.
The following notes are a summary of reproductive activity with some
comparative P. domesticus data from Summers-Smith (1963).
Eggs: Heavily marked with brown and ash grey so that the whitish ground
colour is almost obscured, very similar to "normal" P. domesticus
eggs in appearance. The mean of six eggs measured was 22.11 mm. by
14.03 mm. the mean egg size for P. domesticus in Great Britain is
22.5 x 15.7 mm. (Summers-Smith).
Nest: A crude cup made of dried and green grass stems; this is covered
with feathers so that the sitting bird is almost obscured. Small
pieces of paper and wood wool were added to the second nest when
the third clutch was laid. It would appear that captive petronias like
House Sparrows, use feathers extensively in nest-lining. Summers-
Smith writes of House Sparrow traps being successfully baited with
feathers and House Sparrows plucking feathers from Wood Pigeons
and feral pigeons for their nests.
It is interesting to note that when Pair A were housed in an aviary in
1974 without completely enclosed nesting receptacles such as boxes, they
showed no breeding activity, although the range of potential nesting sites
and receptacles was very varied.
Mackworth-Praed and Grant (i960) record P. dentata as breeding in
small holes in trees in eastern Africa.
Although the most popular nest sites for P. domesticus are usually
buildings, the choice of site can vary from the old nests of other birds to
domed nests in open tree sites. Summers-Smith found that House Spar-
rows deserted open tree sites when he provided nest boxes in the area.
Chicks: The three chicks hatched from clutch 2 left the nest 13 days
after hatching, two in the morning and one in the afternoon. House
Sparrow chicks usually leave the nest in the morning, although Sum-
mers-Smith records that in one brood one chick fledged two days
before the remainder. The mean nesting period for the House Spar-
row in the U.K. is 14-4 days with a range of 11 to 19 days. The patterns
of behaviour of petronias after fledging seem to be very similar to
House Sparrows, the chicks roosting in the nesting box after the
first day of fledging and the main feeding of the chicks being carried
out by the cock bird.

Voice
The vocalisations of Bush Petronias appear to be similar to those of the
House Sparrow but toned down and less harsh. The advertising call or
song is given by the male in many situations but most often at the nest
site before nesting has commenced. This can be written as "Chic-chic",
"Cher-Chic", "Chirrick", with some variation. A low "Churr-Churr" and
sometimes "Cher-Chik" is given when aggression is displayed to other
birds. When I handled the chicks for ringing, a note given by one of the
chicks, a shrill "Chee-Chee" evoked the mobbing display from House
Sparrows previously described.
It is tempting to suggest that taxonomic relationship is close enough for
a "common base" of vocalisations.
Displays
The sexual display of the cock bird to the hen (Fig.) consists of the
cock adopting a very upright posture with the head lifted, thus displaying
the yellow throat spot to her. This upright posture is accompanied by a
bouncing movement up and down with alternate straightening and bending
of the legs as described for Uraeginthus cyanocephala (Blue-headed
Waxbill) by Goodwin (1962). In the Bush Petronia's display, however, the
head is maintained in the same position and I have not seen the cock bird
pick up any stems before or after display. The display is accompanied by
vocalisations which appear to be similar to advertising calls. The hen
usually sits facing the cock without giving any vocalisation or apparent

reaction; on one occasion the cock approached the hen after a display and
an apparently successful copulation took place. Summers-Smith describes
a House Sparrow's sexual display in which "The head is held up with the
chest thrust forward 55 , showing off the black bib. Apart from this exposure
of the bib, or in the petronias 5 case, yellow throat spot, the displays are
very different. In the very upright almost "rigid 55 display of the petronia,
there is no wing or tail movement.
The threat display is a head forward movement in which the bill is
usually open, Bush Petronias are not particularly aggressive birds, but
this posture is often seen if a dove or other bird approaches a feeding
petronia. I have kept three cocks and two hens in the same aviary, and
have found interspecific aggression is high during the breeding season if
more than one pair is housed together.
Enehjelm (1956) found Bush Petronias "As peaceful as a pair of Ben-
galese or Parrot Finches 55 .
Bush Petronias frequently flick their tails as observed in House Sparrows
by Summers-Smith: in both species tail-flicking occurs usually when the
birds are nervous or anxious. Pair A would tail-flick more often when
housed in a bird room box cage than when in an outside aviary.
I have kept two pairs of congenerics, the Yellow-throated Sparrow
P. xanthocollis for just over two years, and tail-flicking has not been ob-
served in this species or in P. petronia seen in Spain.
Summary
The breeding and behaviour of captive Petronia dentata is described
with some comparative notes on Passer domesticus.
It would appear from the limited observations on P. dentata that the
general breeding biology and certain behaviour patterns e.g. tail-flicking
are common to both species.

A SIMPLE DIET FOR CAPTIVE RUBY-THROATED
HUMMINGBIRDS
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.948079975" page_id="56386407"  page_num="75" year="" vol="">
Archilochus colubris
By Edwin C. Franks and Elizabeth T. Faries
(Western Illinois University, Macomb, Illinois)
Keeping hummingbirds healthy in captivity naturally requires a food that
is acceptable to the birds, as well as being fully-balanced nutritionally. In
the wild, the diet of most hummingbirds includes nectar as the major
carbohydrate source, and arthropods as the major protein source (Wagner,
1946; Greenewalt, i960; Snow and Snow, 1972).
The food that seems to be most attractive to many species of humming-
birds outdoors is sucrose syrup. Recommended concentrations vary from a
very dilute one part sugar in 23 parts water (Martin, 1963) to a very
concentrated two parts sugar in one part water (Hydes of Waltham,
Waltham, Massachusetts). More typical recommendations vary from 22
per cent to 50 per cent sugar in water (Van Riper, 1953; Miller and Miller,
1971). Dilute honey is acceptable and may furnish a slightly more balanced
diet, but also ferments more rapidly (Grant, i960). The attractiveness of
syrups is evident from the unusually large concentrations of wild humming-
birds that gather around outdoor feeders (Hammond, 1966). While syrups
attract hummingbirds, protein and other essential foods must be available
or the birds rapidly lose vigour.
Some species of hummingbirds in aviaries stay healthy on a diet com-
posed solely of honey water, vitamins and fruit flies ( Drosophila ) which they
capture in flight or pick off the cage surfaces (Scheithauer, 1967; Elgar,
1975). Unfortunately, some hummingbird species do not adapt readily to
accepting food in captivity (Mobbs, 1974, 1976), and there is a degree of
inconvenience in supplying live fruit flies at all seasons.
Therefore, balanced hummingbird diets of non-living foods are
desirable for aviaries. Scheithauer (1967) reviewed the hummingbird foods
used in many zoos, finding a number of somewhat complex variations that
provide an assortment of protein and vitamin sources. In his own aviary, he
used a food based on Nektar-Mil II baby food in dilute honey. For the
hard-to-keep Eriocnemis hummingbirds, Mobbs (1974) used plant pollen
as an additive to dilute sucrose syrup with success, but found the pollen not
to be universally available, and did not state what other foods were given.
In this paper, we describe a simple formula based on a human pabulum.
A fledged juvenile (or female) Ruby-throated Hummingbird Archilochus
colubris was found near death and with a broken wing. A sugar-water
solution was sufficient to revive the bird, but its vigour declined again
within 24 hours.
The diet that was both acceptable and sustaining to the bird was a

mixture of 150 ml water, 15 ml honey, 6 grams of Gerber High Protein
Cereal For Baby (Gerber Products Co., Fremont, Michigan), and 0.5 gram
of sucrose, which we believe could be omitted. The cereal is based on
fortified soybean, oat and wheat flours, and is 35 per cent protein when dry.
Although not fully soluble, the cereal remained in suspension well after
blending. It was eagerly accepted by the injured hummingbird when
offered from a medicine dropper at 30-minute intervals. In addition to the
cereal mixture, a 10 per cent sugar, 1 per cent honey solution was available
ad libitum.
The bird was maintained on this diet for two weeks. Flight was still
impossible due to the broken wing, but the bird was otherwise vigorous
and alert when it was given to a zoo for continued care.
We find that the ingredients for this diet are readily available at all
seasons, and believe that the diet is sufficient to maintain the health of a
Ruby-throated Hummingbird for a long time.

Whilst employed as a keeper on the Bird Section of the Adelaide Zoo
in South Australia from October 1973 to November 19743 I was in the
fortunate position of having under my charge a small group of Apostle
Birds Struthidea cinerea, and was thus able to learn something of their
behaviour under conditions of captivity. This article is a summary of the
observations I made on this species during that period. The delay in
publication of this material, while regrettable, was unavoidable for a
number of reasons, but I apologise none the less to those aviculturists who
include this species in their collections and might have found these notes
of value at an earlier date. I hope they will still be of some interest and
value now.
Description and classification
The Apostle Bird is an indigenous Australian species some 30 cm. in
length, half of which is tail. It is a bird of predominantly grey plumage
with light brown flight feathers and a greenish sheen to its black tail. The
feet, tarsi and bill are black. The bill is a short, stout structure some
2 cm. long surrounded at its base by short black bristles which, combined
with the slight down curve of the upper mandible, give the bird a some-
what corvid appearance. There is no sexual dimorphism, but the adult
differs from the juvenile in eye colour and plumage of the head and breast.
In the juvenile these are brown and grey respectively, while in the adult,
the iris is grey with a white outer ring of varying width and the head and
breast feathers are grey tipped with white.
Apostle Birds are the only members of the genus Struthidea but taxono-
mists vary in their classification of the species into the next higher primary
taxon, the family. Three species of Australian birds (and one in New
Guinea) are known to build cup-shaped nests using mud as the major
structural component. They are the Torrent Lark Grallina bruijni , the
Magpie Lark or Mudlark Grallina cyanoleuca , the White-winged Chough
Cor cor ax melanorhamphos and the Apostle Bird. Taking this similarity in
nest-building behaviour as sufficient evidence for a family relationship, the
four birds comprise the family Grallinidae. A second view reserves this
group for Grallina (which nests in pairs) and places Corcorax and Struthidea
with the scimitar-billed babblers (genus Pomatostomus ) in the subfamily
Timaliinae on the grounds that they all share the interesting habit of
living a communal existence, each bird of a group sharing in the building
of a single nest into which several females may lay their eggs; incubation,
brooding and rearing of young are, similarly, activities which involve the
entire group.

The normal range of the Apostle Bird is inland eastern Australia extend-
ing from the Gulf of Carpentaria to the south-east of South Australia
although Adelaide may be the species 5 western limit in the south of the
continent. The birds inhabit open woodland comprising Acacia , Cupressus
and Eucalyptus species where these occur along the inland water courses.

</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.979446194444444" page_id="56386410"  page_num="78" year="" vol="">
At the beginning of the study period the group consisted of four adults
and a three-week old nestling, all of unknown sex. Their previous history
is unknown (by me) but, at the time of my arrival, they had established
their position in the aviary hierarchy and this did not alter during my stay.
Housing
The birds were housed in an approximately square aviary with sides
measuring iomxnm. A roof sloping from the centre gave a maximum
height of 5.5 m. and a minimum of 3.6 m. at the perimeter. The tubular
framework was enclosed by 1.1 cm. (J in.) wire netting and access
was by a single, inwardly swinging gate. Only two sides of the aviary were
exposed to public walkways and the aviary furniture was dominated by
three mature trees of the species Acacia saligna (golden wreath wattle)
Pittosporum undulatum (sweet pittosporum) and Harpulia pendula (tulip-
wood). Dead logs and branches were distributed in various strategic places
either as sunning posts or for easy access to the feeding trays, one of which
was secured at a low fork in the Pittosporum and the other, covered by a
metal roof, was suspended among the branches of the Harpulia. In the
corner opposite the entrance, a shallow concrete pool served for drinking
and bathing while in the centre of the aviary, surrounded by the three
trees, the otherwise bare earth floor was covered by a Brush Turkey
Alectura lathami mound of assorted grass and leaf litter. This had a
diameter of 3 m. and a height of about 1.5 m.
Apart from the pair of Brush Turkeys, the Apostle Birds shared this
aviary with the following species: one pair Maned Geese Chenonetta
juhata , two (later one) Pied Currawong Strepera graculina , one Grey
Butcherbird Cracticus torquatus , one pair (later one) Nankeen Kestrels
Falco cenchroides , one White-winged Chough Corcorax melanorhamphos
and one (later two) Laughing Kookaburras Dacelo novaeguineae.
The only shelter from sun and rain was that afforded by the tree canopy
and this was quite adequate. A small concrete wall about the base of the
aviary provided a wind break for the ground birds while the tree canopy,
which was quite dense as well as extensive, also served this function for
the arboreal species. All the aviary occupants remained outdoors through-
out the year.

fed once a day. The meal comprised a seed mixture (including some wheat),
a little diced apple, mealworms and mincemeat, the latter being offered in
the lower dish where it was easily accessible to other meat-eaters including
the Brush Turkeys. When available, cockroaches and small garden snails
were also given. Any seed remaining from the previous day was scattered
on the earth floor where it provided some occupational stimulus for the
Apostle Birds. Seeding grasses, in the form of turfs, were also provided
from time to time for the same purpose. When chicks were being fed, the
diet remained essentially the same except that the live food was increased
and varied to a greater extent. At this time we included locusts and crickets,
beginning with the small "hoppers" and increasing the size as the young
grew larger. The regimen followed was to offer these insects four times
per day (at roughly equal intervals between 8.00 a.m. and 5.00 p.m.) for
the first ten days after hatching, three times per day thereafter until fledg-
ing and then twice per day until independence was attained. Normal,
once-daily feeding was reimplemented at this stage unless a second clutch
had hatched. Water, obtained from the pool, was changed daily and used
frequently by the Apostle Birds both for drinking and bathing.
Courting
This may be a crepuscular activity as little of it and no mating was
observed during working hours (8.00 a.m. to 5.00 p.m.). Only two instances
were recorded of behaviour involving only two birds and which could
reasonably be interpreted as courting behaviour. The first of these was the
feeding of one adult by another on the day preceding the laying of the
first egg of a clutch. The second instance was noted while young chicks
were in the nest and involved a more elaborate display: the two birds stood
some 12 cm. apart on a branch partially hidden by the tree foliage and
facing in the same direction with their feathers slightly ruffled and head
held high, both called in unison in a monosyllable for some 30 seconds.
During this display and on many other occasions when the birds were in
a state of excitement, the white eye ring was observed to expand and
contract.
Nest-building
This is a fascinating activity to observe. I first noted it whilst cleaning
the aviary pool when the water which was sluiced onto the aviary floor
inevitably formed a muddy patch--thus providing the birds with the basic
ingredient for nest-building. The earth of the aviary floor was of a fairly
heavy type and this is extremely important for the successful construction
of nests, as it forms a mud which is both pliable and binding when in-
tegrated with the other nesting materials of fine grasses, pine needles and
other leaf litter. A soil of a loose, sandy texture has been found at the
Perth Zoo, Western Australia, to be inadequate in this capacity. During
drought periods when mud is scarce, wild Apostle Birds are reported to

improvise with, among other things. Emu dung.
I recorded the building procedure as follows: "A bird, having collected
a sufficient mixture of mud, pine needles and dead leaf particles, would
fly up to the nest site and, placing itself in the centre of the platform, work
the material into the structure with its bill while turning round in a
crouched posture, thus moulding the nest to the shape of its body. This,
like the feeding of the infants, was done by all four adults in sequence--
one bird relieving the other after it had disposed of its material. The nest
site was approximately 3.5 m. from the ground .. As with all the others,
this nest was built on a horizontal branch 4-6 cm. in diameter. Sometimes
the point of attachment was at a fork in the branch and at other times it
was placed at the centre of a straight, horizontal branch with no other
support. The nest sites were always well covered by the tree canopy,
usually difficult to see from the outside and never less than 2 m. from the
ground. A new nest was usually built at a different site for each clutch, the
previous nest being completely destroyed a day or so before building
recommenced. Only once during the study period were the birds found to
repair and re-use a nest for a second clutch.
Laying , incubation and rearing
Table 1 summarises the breeding results recorded during the study
period. It can be seen that breeding occurred between August and
February, a period which spans the Australian spring and summer seasons.
Incubation for five clutches was 16-17 days commencing with the first
or second egg laid and young left the nest at 25 days of age. Eggs (which
were not measured but were about the same size and shape as those of the
Starling Sturnus vulgaris had a creamy white ground colour with brown
"teardrop" markings about the broad end. As seen in Table 1, they were
laid at daily intervals. This observation and the general small size of each
clutch (4-5 eggs) would seem to indicate that only one hen was laying
each clutch.

over procedure initiated by two shorty sharp calls followed by the "flock
call ,, from the sitting bird, whereupon it would fly from the nest to rouse
and preen its feathers while a second bird settled itself on the eggs.
Sometimes an incubating bird was fed by one of the group without stirring
from the nest, but without a means of individual recognition, it was im-
possible to note which bird was sitting at any time and thus determine if
all birds were involved. One attempt was made to band the birds with
coloured bands of the plastic coil type but these were soon removed by the
birds' strong beaks. Some type of sealed aluminium band would seem to
be required but I had no opportunity to attempt this as the birds had
recommenced nesting activities and it was thought that subjecting them
to the trauma of recapture would adversely affect the nesting. However,
there is no doubt that much valuable information on the social activities of
these birds could be gained with the help of an effective means of individual
recognition.
Despite these difficulties, it was easy to note that all four adults were
involved in the feeding of young both in the nest and for some time sub-
sequently. Like nest-building, this was performed in relay, each bird
feeding the young with a beak full of mealworms or young crickets and
returning to the feeding tray for more while the next in line continued to
feed the chicks and so on. This was performed with amazing rapidity,
each bird apparently using a different route to and from the nest so that
a smooth flow of traffic was maintained between nest and feeding tray.
Initially a single mealworm or insect was picked up by each adult, taken
to the ground and, holding it down with the feet, pulled to bits with the
beak before being taken to the nest and fed to the chicks. As the chicks
grew and their demand for food increased, all but the larger insects were
fed without pulling apart and often up to five or six mealworms would be
taken to the nest at one time. While at the nest, adults were observed to
remove and swallow the faecal sacs produced by the chicks despite the
habit of the young birds to protrude their posterior over the lip of the nest
when relieving themselves.
Development of the young was quite slow; 25 days were usually required
before chicks left the nest. One chick then took 13 days before picking
up food for the first time and a further 11 days before attaining indepen-
dence from parental feeding. Remarkably, at the time of leaving the nest
the young birds are little more than half the size of their parents and bear a
disproportionately small tail. Until the tail feathers are fully grown,
flying from one branch to another is a precarious business, the small surface
area of the tail being insufficient to effect the necessary retardation of
momentum required for a smooth landing and a wild balancing act is
required at the point of impact. Despite this, flying was mastered quite
quickly and the growing juveniles were active through much of the day,
spending a good deal of their time mimicking the actions of the adults.
A brief perusal of Table 1 reveals that observations which involved

interference with the nest became less frequent with later clutches. This
is a reflection of my increasing experience in the husbandry of these birds;
I found that such interference caused considerable distress to the adult
birds and it may have contributed to the frequent loss of young shortly
after hatching. A summary of the criteria I believe are essential for success-
ful breeding of this species is given at the end of this article.

BEHAVIOUR
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.9848775" page_id="56386416"  page_num="82" year="" vol="">
Intra-specific behaviour
The Apostle Bird group is a very closely knit community which main-
tains constant contact between its members, either physically, visually or
vocally. Much of the cooler part of the day is spent walking (rarely
hopping) about the aviary floor scratching the surface and picking out
seeds and insects. Often this is done as a group but, when foraging
individually, contact is maintained by frequent utterances of what I
have termed the "flock call" for obvious reasons. This is merely the call
that is uttered most frequently when the birds are in a relaxed state, but
it is also combined in other calls under special circumstances. The species'
vocabulary is quite large, although only a few calls are recorded in my
notes. A detailed collection of these correlated with the behaviour would
be a worthwhile enterprise for an interested individual who finds her/
himself in the right circumstances. Other than the begging call which I
assume is innate, the entire vocabulary appears to be learnt through
mimicry of the adults and I was amused to find, on several occasions, a
juvenile close to independence standing in a secluded spot in the aviary
reciting a continuous stream of calls in a quiet voice as though attempting
to commit them to memory!
Physical contact between group members was established by sitting in a
very tight group upon a branch and preening both themselves and each
other. These "shoulder-to-shoulder" sessions were observed almost
daily and often included the sub-adults for short periods. Until young
birds are able to fly strongly and thus avoid harassment by the other aviary
birds, at least one of the adults is in constant close attendance and drives
off any birds who venture too close (see below). At this time, the guardian
and any other adult in sight is constantly begged from by the juvenile.
When food is available, such begging initially receives a positive response
and the food is either passively allowed to be taken from the adult's beak
or placed directly into the juvenile's mouth. As the infant's ability to fly
and clamber through the trees improves, so the response to its begging
diminishes and a lengthy chase may be necessary before an adult is
cornered and gives up its morsel of food to the young bird. It was noted
that, about this stage, the adults would repeatedly drop food at the
juvenile's feet rather than handing it over directly. Only when this had
received a negative response several times was the morsel picked up and

</page>
<bodyText confidence="0.993778431818182" page_id="56386417"  page_num="83" year="" vol="">
fed in the normal way. It is not long after this that the young bird is seen
to pick up small objects (blades of grass, seeds, etc.) from the ground and
manipulate them in its beak. If mealworms are thrown near the bird's
feet at this time, one may be picked up. This stimulates the bobbing
actions of the head which accompany begging and, almost by accident,
the mealworm is swallowed. Although active pursuit and begging from
the adults continues for some time, the juvenile increasingly supplements
its diet with food picked up from the ground or feeding trays and is self-
sufficient some three-and-a-half weeks after fledging.
When one juvenile (clutch two) fractured a wing at 36 days of age (and
therefore still substantially dependent on the adults for food) it was decided
not to remove it from the aviary where it might require force-feeding and
a subsequent reintroduction to the group which was very unlikely to be
successful. After first immobilising the fractured wing with a cloth brail
(the design of which can be found in any comprehensive book on falconry)
the bird was placed in a small parrot cage which had been firmly secured
off the ground in the shade of the trees in the aviary. This confinement was
mainly necessary to protect the (now vulnerable) bird from undue harass-
ment and further injury from the other aviary birds, in particular the male
Brush Turkey. This arrangement worked well with the adult Apostle
Birds feeding the injured youngster through the bars of its cage. Ten days
later the brail was removed and the juvenile released into the aviary. The
injured wing took some time to lose its stiffness, but after a week the bird
was flying with some skill.
Interspecific behaviour
That the social life of the Apostle Birds was an advantage in deterring
the other aviary birds from predation or competition was evident in the
clear dominance of the study group over all other aviary occupants. Of
these, both the Maned Geese and the Brush Turkeys successfully fledged
young and there were periods, therefore, when these birds were at their
most belligerent. However, at no time were they any match against the
combined attack of the four adult Apostle Birds and were always forced
to retreat from the vicinity of the nest or fledgling, the approach to which
would bring on an attack. When the subject of attack was below the
Apostle Birds, their method was to fly repeatedly to and fro between
one branch and another in rapid succession, often striking the victim in
flight. Having personally experienced such an onslaught for my repeated
interference with the nest, I can testify to its effectiveness! At ground
level an adversary is attacked by flying at it feet first, accompanied by
loud screeches.
There was an unusual relationship between the Apostle Birds and the
single White-winged Chough. As mentioned at the beginning of this
article, these birds have a number of behavioural similarities as a con-
sequence of which they are placed by some in the family Timaliidae. In

</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.984214866666667" page_id="56386418"  page_num="84" year="" vol="">
view of this, the partial acceptance of the chough into the Apostle Bird's
social life may not be so surprising.
I discovered at an early date that it was one of this chough's idio-
syncracies to offer food to the various birds in the aviary. He (she ?) did
this with apparent randomness, offering the food to whoever was closest,
and so it was not significant that occasionally an Apostle Bird was solicited
in this way (as was I). It was significant and indicative of a special relation-
ship, however, that this chough was often included in the &amp;apos;'shoulder-to-
shoulder" sessions mentioned above. It was a most extraordinary sight
to see this relatively enormous bird squashed between its diminutive
companions preening and being preened as if this difference did not
exist! This bird was never observed to participate in the building of an
Apostle Bird nest as might have been anticipated, but, unless it approached
unbearably close to a nest actually in use, it was also never subjected to
the harassment meted out to the other aviary occupants.

CONCLUSIONS
</sectionHeader>
<listItem confidence="0.858283692307692" page_id="56386418"  page_num="84" year="" vol="">
My observations on Apostle Birds have led me to formulate a number
of criteria which I believe are essential if this species is to be bred with
some regularity in captivity. They are as follows:
1. Mud of a suitable texture must be available at all times during the
breeding season, along with pine needles, grasses, etc.
2. Nesting sites in the form of horizontal branches 4-6 cm. in diameter
must be provided in a part of the aviary not exposed to view from the
outside. In an outdoor enclosure this position should naturally be well
protected from the elements.
3. Human interference with the nest during incubation and rearing should
be kept to an absolute minimum--this being gauged by the birds'
reaction to such interference.
4. Live food in the form of mealworms and insects should be given as
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.990017666666667" page_id="56386418"  page_num="84" year="" vol="">
frequently as possible. Though not essential outside the breeding
season, I believe it is imperative for the successful rearing of young.
Even at the earliest stages of rearing, however, live food is supplemented
by mincemeat and this has led me to believe that it is more the frequency
with which food is offered than the amount given at each feed. I was
able to induce the adults to take insects from my hand while they were
rearing young and this was useful because it meant none of this precious
food escaped and that it was distributed evenly among the birds ensur-
ing that they were all able to feed the chicks at regular intervals.
5. Four adult birds appears to be the minimum viable breeding unit. My
reason for believing this is based on observations made on a group of
three at the same time as this study was pursued. This group regularly
built nests, laid highly fertile clutches which invariably hatched, but
no young were reared beyond a few days of age. In the Perth Zoo, W.A.,
an isolated pair have only gone so far as to build the foundations of a

nest although, admittedly, other factors could reasonably account for
this. However, in view of the social nature of this species, and particu-
larly its unusual nesting behaviour, it seems likely that the minimum
size of a breeding group is greater than one pair. The present study
has shown that four birds can constitute such a viable unit.

In the latter part of August 1974, during a two weeks' stay at the Centre
Spatial Guyanais near Kourou (French Guiana), I visited several times
the Degrad Saramaka which is situated approximately 45 km. upstream
the Kourou river, where a pumping station supplying the Centre and the
village itself with water is installed.
The Degrad is also a place of departure used by the Kourou inhabitants
for hunting expeditions into the forests of the interior and for boating on
the upstream section of the river. Both river banks are covered with humid
primary forest, disturbed only around the station, where the Route du
Degrad Saramaka reaches the river. There secondary forest typified by
Cecropia trees invades the bulldozer cleared area around the station
buildings and the borders of the Route. Further changes to the initial
vegetation are small pineapple and banana plantations surrounding a
native inhabitant's shelter on the right of the Route-river point, and three
or four clearings on the left river bank, at a distance of approximately
1 km. from the Degrad. In the clearings situated along the same forest
path, the undergrowth is completely cut down, only tall trees remaining.
All are quite near the riverside, and have a small landing-stage and a
so-called "carbet" (primitive shelter). These forest clearings are used only
during week-end and holiday outings.
Silver-beaked Tanagers Ramphocelus carbo are common around the
Degrad Saramaka. Single birds, pairs or family groups were seen usually
in secondary vegetation along the river bank and forest edges and in the
poorly kept plantations, more than in the clearings.

use on the left bank, I flushed a female Silver-beaked Tanager from a
4 m. high thicket of saplings. Answering her sharp alarm calls, a male
joined her in the vegetation at the clearing's edge.
In the clearing, which was bordered on one side by the Kourou river,
about 20 x 30 m. of undergrowth and small trees had been carefully cut
down, leaving only larger trees as shade and a few bromeliads and philo-
dendrons as ornamental green plants. The three to four main thumb-thick
saplings and a few smaller twigs forming the thicket, grew on a stump with
a diameter of approximately 20 cm., this being the remains of a large tree
which had been felled. The undergrowth being very sparse, these saplings
formed the only vegetation in and around the clearing thus offering a
suitable nesting site. In the centre of the clearing next to the stump stood
a carbet. The group of saplings had a total diameter of approximately
50 cm.; the main ones were forked near the top. A closer examination of the
dense, small-leaved foliage revealed that no less than four nests of a
Silver-beaked Tanager were present: two close to each other at a height
of approximately 1.80 to 2 m. in the inner part of the thicket (nest A and
B); one in a fork near the top of a 3 m. high sapling (nest C) and a further
nest near the top of the main sapling at a height of approximately 4 m.
(nest D). The relative distances between the four nests varied between
approximately 0.25 to 2 m.
Nest D was completed and contained two brooded eggs. It was attached
to the main stem of the tallest sapling by fine fibrous material and spiders'
web. Nest C was supported by a four twig fork, but was obviously not
completed, as the usual inner lining of wiry rootlets and strands with
spiders' web on the outside was almost non-existent. Nests A and B were
only partially built, nest B consisting of the outer foundations only:
fibrous rootlets, fragments of dead leaves, etc. Nest A, the lowest one, was
abandoned in a state between that of nests B and C, with only the rim and
inner lining missing. Nests A and B were built between the main stem and
some side shoots, but in two different saplings. All four nests were very
similar in construction, not only in the materials used but also in the way
in which they were attached to the supporting twigs. They were obviously
of recent construction, there being no sign of deterioration by weather
effects. The pair of Silver-beaked Tanagers mentioned above was the only
one returning to the nests when I left the clearing, and the only pair of
that particular tanager species I observed there when visiting the clearing
on subsequent days.

Although non-territorial, tanagers of the genus Ramphocelus do not
breed in colonies; on the contrary, nests are as a rule widely scattered
throughout suitable areas. However, the building and attending of nests
close to each other by Ramphocelus females has been mentioned in litera-
ture. Skutch (1954: 131-136) describes several occasions in which he

found two nests occupied by two different female Song Tanagers
Ramphoceluspasserinii within a distance of 0.10 to 3.60 m. from each other.
Skutch (1968: 80-81) also mentions the case of two female Silver-beaked
Tanagers each building a nest approximately 0.90 m. apart.
In most cases where nests are built close to each other they belong to the
more numerous females which being unable to find a regular mate, attend
their nests unaided. Sometimes those females are able to hatch their eggs
and to fledge their young. In the Ramphocelus species males never help
with nest building, however they help in the feeding of the young. Although
no material was added to any of the three incomplete nests A, B and C
after their being discovered, there is a possibility several females were
involved in the construction of all four nests described above. That there
may have been other females which had left the area and their nests after
my first visit to the clearing, cannot be completely discounted even though
I did not see them on later visits.
However, from my observations I learnt that in the Degrad Saramaka
area, female Silver-beaked Tanagers do not outnumber the males, suggest-
ing that irregularly mated females are rare. One may expect that those
females are more prone to building a nest near to an occupied one.
The above observations suggest that it is more likely that all four nests
were built by the same female; namely the one flushed from nest D.
Moreover on several later visits only one pair was observed in and around
the clearing in which the four nests were found, and they were seen to
attend nest D. The male always escorted the same female when she
returned to the nest after I had left the clearing.
Definite evidence to support the very interesting idea that one female
Silver-beaked Tanager may have built four consecutive nests cannot be
brought about by direct observation. Nevertheless, those observations
already mentioned favour the conclusion that indeed only one female was
involved.
The reason for these successive nesting site changes can in my opinion
be attributed to the irregular but daylong presence during weekends and
holidays of men in the clearing (my own visits never lasted longer than
10 minutes). Their visits may have disturbed the female thus prompting
her to leave a nest under construction, only to choose another nesting site
in the same saplings on the stump--the most favourable nesting place--
when the clearing was again free of human disturbance.
I am most indebted to A. J. Mobbs (England) for his valuable sugges-
tions in preparing this paper.

TOOL-USING BY BIRDS AND RELATED BEHAVIOUR

Introduction

The answer to the question "How many bird species use tools?", given
in A new dictionary of birds (Thomson, 1964) was: One. "The only
fully authenticated instance is that of one of the Geospizinae of the Gala-
pagos Islands, Camarhynchus pallidus [now Cactospiza pallida ], which has
the habit of using a spine or small twig, held in the bill, as a probe in search
of insect prey." The purpose of this contribution is to bring together the
scattered references to tool-using by birds, some in the wild, some in cap-
tivity, in the hope of stimulating interest in the readers of avicultural
MAGAZINE.
Thomson defined tool-using as "actually wielding some external object
as an implement". Of tool-using among animals generally. Hall (1965)
wrote "Tools and weapons have been described as 'extra corporeal limbs',
which can be changed or discarded as circumstances dictate. Essentially,
an animal's performance may be defined as 'tool-using' if it takes hold of
some object in its hands, claws, jaws, beak or trunk, and then proceeds to
use that object as a kind of extension of its own body to reach something
it could not otherwise reach, break open only at the risk of damaging its
teeth, or to repel something threatening or alarming". In her review of
tool-using in primates and other vertebrates, Jane van Lawick-Goodall
(1970) says that "a tool-using performance in an animal or bird is specified
as the use of an external object as a functional extension of mouth or beak,
hand or claw, in the attainment of an immediate goal. This goal may be
related to the attainment of food, care of the body, or repulsion of a preda-
tor, intruder, etc."
It might be supposed that these definitions would be simple enough to
apply when asking whether any particular piece of avian behaviour cons-
tituted tool-using. But disagreements between authors show that it is not
so simple (Chisholm 1954, 1969, 1971a, 1971b, and 1972; Thorpe 1956;
Millikan and Bowman 1967; Lawick-Goodall 1970). The fact is that birds
use and manipulate objects and materials in a variety of ways. Some of
their actions we may choose to call tool-using but the distinction is not a
hard and fast one. A quick, but wide-ranging review of avian object- and
materials-use will demonstrate.
Outline of general object- and materials-use by birds
To begin with some of the more obvious examples, birds pick up and
often manipulate their food items with the bill or feet. They drink water
and other fluids. They turn their eggs, sometimes carry their young, and
usually remove faeces and egg-shells from the nest. Many birds use water
or dust for bathing, and a few use substances cosmetically. A number of

species use extraneous objects in displays both sexual and intimidatory.
Birds build nests using a multitude of matter, often very skilfully; no
human has ever built a bird's nest as well as a bird. Some birds, notably
crows, parrots and birds of prey "play" with objects, and a few species
repeatedly drop them, apparently for the enjoyment of the sound effects.
At least two fish-eaters attract their prey with specially positioned baits or
lures. Many passerines use ants and other objects apparently to rid them-
selves of ectoparasites, and at least one hole-nesting bird rubs the rim of
its nest entrance with insects leaving a repellent substance. Mainly among
captive species, but also in the wild, birds have been observed using in-
animate items in body care. There are two possible instances of an object
being used aggressively: as a missile and a lance.
To return to feeding behaviour and some of its more sophisticated ex-
pressions, there are birds that scratch away earth or leaves, birds that
flip stones out of the way in foraging, and others that hollow out a "vice"
in which to hold food. There are those that impale prey on thorns or lodge
it between forked branches (these instances are not strictly relevant but
both have been considered to be tool-using in the past). Certain birds will
pull up food suspended in air at the end of a string; two members of the
crow family are known to pull up fishing lines suspended through holes
in the ice. There are birds in at least four families that drop hard-shelled
items from a height to break them open, and representatives of at least
three families use anvils for a similar purpose. Three or more avian species
hurl objects as missiles or use the same objects as hammers when attacking
thick-shelled food items. Lastly, several birds wield sticks, twigs, spines
or pieces of bark to assist in food-gathering.
I will enumerate all behaviour that has been held by any author to be
tool-using, or that seems to be worthy of consideration as such. But in
summing up I shall select and tabulate only the more obvious and accept-
able cases.
Borderline cases in wild and some captive birds
As will have been clear from the latter part of the preceding summary,
the variety of behaviour patterns that writers have been tempted to class
as tool-using is considerable, and demonstrates "that tool-using is not
the only kind of activity in birds which establishes complex relationships
between objects" (Millikan and Bowman 1967). They referred specifically
to the Tailorbird Orthotomus sutorius of south-east Asia that stitches leaves
together with plant fibres to form a receptacle for its nest, but which can
hardly be classed as a true tool user.
The impaling of prey on thorns by many of the shrikes (Laniidae) is
well known. Other birds store food in the forks of branches in trees and
shrubs; and several other birds may use spines or forked sticks to anchor
a carcase while they flay it with the bill (Millikan and Bowman 1970).
These authors conclude that "This is an example of a fixed device which

serves as an extension of the body, in this case, talons" and is thus a true
form of tool-using. Lawick-Goodall (1970) on the other hand concluded
that the use of fixed skewers is not true tool-using because the thorn (or
whatever) is not manipulated by the bird. Similarly, she rejected the sugges-
tion by Lancaster (1968) that the nest-building activities of both birds
and mammals were examples of tool-using. Nor is it easy to accept
A. Kortiandt's suggestion (pers.comm.) that the vice-hollowing abilities of
woodpeckers (Picidae) amount to tool-using. Examples include the Great
Spotted Woodpecker Dendrocopus major which shapes a "vice" in which to
wedge a pine cone as illustrated in the film "Carpenters of the Forest" and
the attendant book (Sielmann 1958): and the Lewis's Woodpecker
Asyndesmus lewis which makes a "chopping block" by removing the bark
or part of a tree and wedging acorns in the resulting depression (Law 1929).
It is, after all, by the same process that the woodpecker hollows its nest hole.
The Baya Weaver Ploceus philippinus can be trained by Indian enter-
tainers to use a needle and thread in a remarkable manner. A tethered bird
of this species is illustrated in Fisher and Peterson (1964), the painting
being based on a film by T. H. Work. The bird, rewarded with millet, has
learnt the trick of threading 8--10 beads on to an 8-inch tasselled cord.
The 3-inch needle is held |-inch from the tip for best control. The dex-
terity displayed by the bird in performing this trick is no more than a
re-application, or a refinement of certain nest-building actions. It is
difficult to regard this trick, or indeed even the most complex nest material
manipulation by weaver birds (Ploceidae) as anything more than the use
of materials, albeit with very sophisticated relative positioning. Crook
(i960) showed that some African weavers can tie half-hitches round stems
with blades of grass.
A North American Sandhill Crane Grus canadensis kept captive by Des
and Jen Bartlett (1973a and b), appeared to use a towel to dry itself after
bathing. They described how the crane would swim behind a canoe "and
then after flapping his wings use a towel to dry himself off for half an hour.
He would drop the towel many times during this performance, but he
persisted, rubbing it carefully around his legs and toes and under his
wings". It would be interesting to know whether this bird behaved in this
way only when it was wet. To have offered it non-absorbent material of
about the same size, shape and colour as the towel might have been a
valuable experiment. However, it seems more likely that the Bartletts were
seeing an abnormal version of a wild behaviour pattern well established
in cranes. They dig up and rub soil over their feathers. Many of the greyish
species of cranes thus acquire a brownish or reddish stain over their entire
body; giving them a much better protective coloration (Walkinshaw 1973).
That birds use inanimate objects in apparent "play" is well-established.
For example, there was a succession of notes in British birds journal
(McKendry 1973, an( i references therein) concerning Herring, Common
and Black-headed Gulls, Larus argentatus , L. cams and L. ridibundus ,

Common and Sandwich Terns, Sterna hirundo and S. sandvicensis , and
the Hooded and Carrion Crows, Corvus corone corone and C. c. cornix ,
many of them playing in flight with such items as stones, sticks, leaves, by
letting them go and catching them again before they reached the ground.
Similar behaviour by a Lammergeyer Gypaetus barbatus was witnessed in
Africa (Huxley and Nicholson 1963). Almost all birds known to drop hard-
shelled food objects to smash them open are either larids, corvids or
accipitrids (see following paragraphs). Did aerial playfulness with objects
follow or precede the more functional behaviour? In other words did the
dropping of food items lead to play with comparable objects, or was play
the means by which birds discovered a new way of obtaining food? A more
likely explanation is that in carrying food from where it was caught to
where it was to be consumed, the accidental dropping of items on suitable
terrain could have led to the establishment of the habit.
Birds also appear to play with objects on the ground. A game of "tag"
by White-winged Choughs, involving a small stick or a bunch of grass,
was described by Chisholm (1948) and the same writer (1971b) instances
Rainbow Birds Merops ornatus seen to toss shiny pebbles into the air.
Brown and Amadou (1968) described the mid-air and terrestrial antics of
a Prairie Falcon Falco mexicanus with a piece of dried cow dung. A
thorough search of the literature would, no doubt, reveal many more
examples of avian object-play.
Lawick-Goodall (1970) gave an instance of stone-dropping by a pair of
Black Kites Milvus migrans which could be play. "One bird picked up
three stones in its talons, one after the other, flew some fifty yards with
them, and dropped them at about 5-minute intervals: the second picked
up and dropped two stones. All five stones were dropped from a height of
about 60 feet. Unfortunately the observer, one of our assistants, did not
immediately investigate: subsequently we found four of the five stones
within an area of some five square yards at the bottom of a shallow grassy
gully among some low bushes. We could find no indication as to why they
had been dropped, but the behaviour was probably connected with feeding,
as the birds showed no aggressive diving or screaming during the per-
formance."
Hard-shelled food items are dropped by many birds. The Lammergeyer
is known to drop mammalian bones and at least one species of tortoise
(Boswall and Crook 1968, Hartley 1964). A number of crows of the genus
Corvus release from a height various molluscs, sea urchins, crustaceans,
and also a species of tortoise. Gulls the world over (mainly of the genus
Larus ) also drop molluscs, echinoderms, and crustaceans and anurans;
also birds' eggs, and there is at least one record of Antarctic Skuas Cath-
aracta skua dropping penguin eggs (Sladen 1958). But none of these birds
count as tool-users, nor can the birds that beat hard prey against "anvils"
of stone or other materials. These include the Song Thrush Turdus philo-
melos; certain of the pittas (Pittidae), e.g. the Buff-breasted Pitta Pitta

versicolor ; the Stagemaker Scenopoeetes dentirostris (Hartley 1964); and
the White-winged Chough Cor cor ax melanorhamphus (Hobbs 1971,
Chisholm 1971b).
Four instances were quoted by Hartshorne (1973) involving as many
species and a larger number of individuals of songbirds (Oscines) playing
at sound-making by dropping objects from their bills or pushing them off
the top of a house or desk. The performances were repeated again and
again and the birds gave signs of listening for the sounds as a 'reward'.
Comparable behaviour by Galahs Eolophus roseicapillus which are said
to have frequently dropped stones on to the iron roof of a country house
in New South Wales is reported by Chisholm (1971a). The same writer
quoted a report of about thirty "Magpies" (sp. ?) that dropped stones on
to a rural roof top. It was said that this action was taken only on mornings
when a delay had occurred in the regular practice of putting out food for
the birds.
Antes (1948) has recorded how Gila Woodpeckers Centurus uropygialis
fed their chicks by a somewhat sophisticated means. "When parent
Gila Woodpeckers Centurus uropygialis virtually gorged their young with
thick, granulated honey that was placed in a saucer on a sycamore stump,
I thinned the honey to the consistency of syrup. Not so easily scooped, the
liquid was fed by the male parent in a clever manner. He gouged pea-sized
lumps of bark from the stump, dipped them in the syrup, and gave the
honey-coated pellets to his fledglings. He repeated this trick for many
days, sometimes varying it by using grains or sunflower seeds which were
in a hollow of the same stump."
Thorpe (1951, 1956) described as an elementary form of tool-using the
ability of a number of species, e.g. tits (Paridae) and Jays Garrulus gland-
arius , to pull up food suspended on a thread. Though not meeting Thom-
son's definition, Millikan and Bowman (1967), who undertook string-
pulling experiments of their own, considered it constituted tool-using,
apparently on the grounds that the birds swallow the food but not the
string and thus can apparently distinguish between the two objects. How-
ever, the same two authors challenged Thorpe's tentative acceptance of
two bird species, the Tailorbird (Wood 1936) and the Little Spiderhunter
Arachnothera longirostris (Whelford 1916), that use spiders Tines as thread,
as "tool-users".
Similarly Lawick-Goodall (1970) in her review of tool-using in primates
and other vertebrates did not consider the two birds mentioned by Thorpe
as tool-users, and she makes a clear and useful distinction between "tools"
and "materials". She further considered that string-pulling behaviour is
a skilful manipulation of objects rather than tool use: "The string and
food lure form a visual continuum and, in pulling on the string, the animal
is merely pulling at a part of the food". In the following otherwise com-
parable case, however, the line and the food do not form a visual con-
tinuum! In Scandinavia Hooded Crows, and in one instance a Raven

Corvus corax pulled up fishing lines suspended through holes in the ice
and consumed any hooked fish (Holmberg 1957). Lone crows would take
hold of the line near the hole, walk away with a loop for a certain distance
before turning and walking back on top of the line to prevent it slipping,
before taking another hold and repeating the process. In two instances
two or more crows co-operated in the hauling up of the tackle.
The dexterity of tits is readily demonstrated by their string-pulling
performances, and an example that also comes very close to tool-using is
quoted and discussed by Thorpe (1945).
"Mr. Trevor Miller, of Riding Mill, Northumberland, in several letters,
described in full and exact detail how in 1938 when a boy, he had suspend-
ed a conical tit-bell of the usual type 3 ins. in diameter half filled with
fat. A fine string was hung centrally through the fat, its end 4 ins. below
the rim of the bell. To this end of the string a light stick of balsa wood
4 ins. long and \ in. thick was suspended, tied firmly by its middle. The
second day after this apparatus was put up, one or more Blue Tits, failing
to reach the fat by any other means, landed on the bar and, hanging in an
inverted position, rolled it up the thread with rapid movements of the feet
and so reached the fat. This process was seen "once or twice a day for
several weeks" and it is thought that more than one bird was concerned.
Mr. Miller has, I understand, since repeated the experiment without
success. That such an achievement could have been an example of "insight
learning" I do not for a moment believe, but I think some subsequent
observations by myself and my friend Mr. T. C. Wyatt in Cambridge
suggest how it might have come about. Having fitted up an apparatus
similar to Mr. Miller&amp;apos;s, I found that unless the bell was composed of some
extremely hard, smooth substance (wood, glass, bakelite and metal bells
were all tried) both Great and Blue Tits were able to hang on to the edge.
If this mode of access was denied them they climbed up the string even
though it was well greased. If fine silk or cotton thread was used they were
unable to do this and then the results were very instructive. The varied
resources and "ingenuity" displayed by Blue Tits in reaching the fat was
astonishing. Some would manage to pull themselves up the thread parrot-
wise with beak and foot sufficiently well to make a rapid stab at the fat
before falling off. Others would hover below and make quick upward
darts at the food, securing a beakful each time. If the string was not too
long others would straddle with one foot on the string and the other braced
against the bar and so, with effort, would lever themselves up until just
within reach. Yet others would stand on the bar and with a rapid stepping
movement execute little fluttering jumps carrying the bar a little way with
them. None succeeded in rolling the bar up the string, but I think this
last performance shows how a bird such as a tit (a bird which is in any
case habitually hanging from twigs and righting itself) might accidentally
roll the bar up a little way. Having done so we may be sure that such a
rapid learner, as this species is, would perceive the advantage and repeat

the process."
This behaviour is not tool-using in the strictest sense, because the "tool"
(the stick and the string) was not used as an extension of the bird's body
and actually brought to bear on anything solid.
In his book i, the aborigine, Lockwood (1966) wrote of kite hawks---or
fire hawks as they were known to the indigenous people---that Chisholm
(1971a) took to be Black Kites Milvus migrans. After outlining how these
birds take advantage of prey flushed out by bush fires he says that they
deliberately set fire to grass and bushland. "I have seen a hawk pick up a
smouldering stick in its claws and drop it in a fresh patch of grass half a
mile away then wait with its mates for the mad exodus of scorched and
frightened rodents and reptiles. When the area was burnt out the process
was repeated elsewhere". This statement and some attendant details make
convincing reading but in the absence of accounts by critical observers the
case must remain unproven.
K. E. L. Simmons has suggested to me that active (or direct) anting in
which passerine birds pick up one or more ants and apply them to the
underside of the wing, might be considered a form of tool-using---especi-
ally as the behaviour seems connected with feather care, i.e. by killing
ectoparasites with formic acid (Simmons 1966). However, I think the
birds are better considered as using materials than using tools, though
it is admittedly a borderline case. Simmons also drew my attention to the
"bill-sweeping" behaviour of White-breasted Nuthatches Sitta carolinensis
studied by Kilham (1968,1971): these birds rub insects and other items--
plant material, fur, and (once) a feather--on the bark near their nests.
However, insects seem to be the primary objects used and Kilham suggests
that the behaviour functions to spread repellent substances from the
crushed insects in the area of the nest-hole in order to divert or distract
tree squirrels. The sweeping objects are often stored both before and after
use. Again, I find it difficult to regard this as true tool-using.
Another example of bird behaviour, while perhaps not strictly tool-
using, is so closely related that it is worth mentioning in detail. This is the
baiting or luring of fish by wild Green Herons Butorides virescens and a
captive Sun Bittern Eurypya helias. Lovell (1958) described how a tame
wild Green Heron in Florida, fed bread by humans, would place the bread
in the water. Fish would thus be lured, which the heron then caught and
consumed. Lovell wrote: "A clear indication that the Green Heron knew
what he was doing was furnished by the following incident. While he was
standing by some floating bread, several small fish broke the surface of
the water several feet to his left. The heron immediately became excited,
picked up his bread and moved it to almost exactly the same spot where the
fish had appeared". Lovell suggests originally that the bird first noticed
that bread thrown into the water attracted fish, "then having learned to
associate bread with fish, went one step further and learned to place the
bread in the water." Exactly comparable behaviour by another Green

Heron near the Miami Seaquarium, also in Florida, has been reported. The
account, by Sisson (1974) is illustrated with colour photographs. The
author was told by a Captain Charles Buie that "The bird has a mother
and a brother that also fish with pellet bait...." and that on one afternoon
within a 25 minute period a bird was seen to bait and catch two dozen fish
--missing on only two occasions. Again in Florida, Norris (1975) saw a
Green Heron using an object as a lure. The bird was in immature plumage
and the "bait" was a feather. A series of photographs show how the bird
patrolled a ditch, feather in bill, before pausing, deliberately dropping the
"fly" into the water and then catching a fish that had apparently reacted
to the feather. A Sun Bittern captive in the tropical house of the Wildfowl
Trust in Gloucestershire fed on live Swordtail fish in the ornamental pond.
The bird appeared to fish by placing the tip of its bill in the water, an
action that caused the fish to swim up, and grabbing one. Human visitors
who place a finger in the water find that the fish crowd around as a food
response. At a later stage the Sun Bittern would pick up maggots put out
as food for passerine birds and place them in the water. To these the
Swordtails were also lured and the Sun Bittern was thus able to capture
them (L. P. Alder, pers. comm. 1974).
On 1st June, 1977, R. J. Prytherch (pers. comm.) watched a vagrant
Squacco Heron Ardeola ralloides near Weston-super-Mare, England.
While hunting the bird frequently caught flying or perched insects. After
capture these were dipped in the wind-rippled water before ingestion--
or so the observer thought at the time. Later, when the water was calm, it
was clear that the heron was placing the invertebrates on the mirror-like
surface. In twenty minutes sixteen insects were thus placed and one fish
was caught. Whether the fish was attracted by the bait it is not possible
to be sure, but it seems probable that the bird's behaviour was intended
to have this effect.
True tool-users in captivity
Aviculturists are in a particularly favourable position to observe tool-
using behaviour. Smith (1970,1971 and pers. comm.) referred to "a Bare-
eyed Cockatoo ( Cacatua sanguined) which when offered a dead matchstick
would hold it in his or her claws and quite deliberately, though admittedly
with little facility, use it to scratch (poke might be the more descriptive
word) the throat area immediately under and posterior to the base of the
lower mandible ... I saw this bird, intermittently on and off for the three
winter months of the year, and must have seen him 'Chinese back scratch'
his throat region some dozen or so times". I later spoke with the subse-
quent owner of this bird who told me it would sometimes scratch
itself four or five times a day. Smith ( op.cit .) gave four more instances of
captive parrots using foot-held objects to scratch themselves. Two refer to
individual Lesser Sulphur-crested Cockatoos Cacatua sulphurea , one in
Cornwall and one in Bedfordshire; and two to African Grey Parrots

Psittacus erithacus. Extracts from these four accounts are repeated here to
encourage discussion. One of the Lesser Sulphur-crested Cockatoos used
"A piece of stick, sometimes of some size, to scratch the sides and base of
his head (he is one of those unfortunate birds that has lost its plumage
through the strange affliction that seems so common to the small white
cockatoos) and though he has not much to scratch in the way of feathers,
the stick seems to have the right feeling for him and he obviously enjoys
his loofah." The second Lesser Sulphur-crested "When given a piece of
wood will bite it for a few minutes then will always scratch under its wings
and on its head. It will do this for up to thirty minutes. It also likes to get
a cigarette packet, or a monkey nut in the shell, and do the same thing."
The African Grey Parrot extracts are as follows: "I heard him utter
little 'clucks' and 'aahs' of pleasure. He hung to the vertical bars of his
cage with one foot. In the other he held a cotton-bobbin which he was
using as a back-scratcher." The second bird "Often uses a piece of twig
to scratch his head and neck. I give him twigs daily off my apple tree and
after he has stripped the bark he then goes through some antics which
include his scratching with the twig." The reason for stripping off the
bark is not clear.
j. P. Kruijt (pers. comm. April 1974) kindly sent me an account of his
and others' observations on a solitary captive African Grey Parrot in the
Netherlands, made in December 1961. "The parrot would hold the tea-
spoon close to the spatulate end, and poke the top and side of its head.
This behaviour could be elicited easily, simply by offering the spoon. The
parrot would also accept a large spoon, but would drop it soon after some
manipulation, apparently because it was too heavy. The owner constructed
a new scratching instrument from a piece of wire, which was bent to form
a loop on one end. The parrot would hold it at that end and scratch itself
with the other end. The owner told me that it did this within a few minutes
of its being presented with the spoon for the first time. It would also
transfer this instrument via the bill to the other foot and then scratch the
other side of the head. A veterinary surgeon, Mr. van der Kooi, visiting
the family, made the following observation on the same parrot: 'it picked
up one of its own moulted loose tail feathers at the broad end scratched
with the other end near its ear, over the top of its head, and even close to
the ear on the other side'."
Taylor (1975) reported similar behaviour by two African Grey Parrots
that frequently used a twig, piece of biscuit or a discarded feather held in
the foot to scratch the back of the head and neck. Yet another bird of this
species frequently used a spoon to scratch the back of its head (Judy Ball,
pers. comm. April 1977).
D. A. Blanden (pers. comm., April 1977) reported that her Blue-fronted
Amazon Parrot Amazona aestiva used one of its chewing sticks to "brush
and back comb" its head feathers.

mention. For example., one parrot used her perch to scratch her head, and
another used a stick for this purpose' 5 .
The first of the two African Greys mentioned by Smith (1971) also
succeeded in using a briar pipe to bale water out of his pot. The owner
reported that the bird was "bought toys for his amusement. One of these
was a brand-new briar pipe .... He succeeded in baling water out of his
water pot by holding the stem in his beak, and dipping the bowl in the pot.
Our parrot made this discovery whilst indulging in his favourite habit of
'dunking' hard objects".
A third (Staffordshire) Lesser Sulphur-crested Cockatoo was "First
noticed using an almond shell for drinking water. She also regularly drinks
from half a peanut-shell". It is evident that the bird was holding these
objects in her foot, for the account goes on to describe how this three-year
old bird also used a teaspoon for baling water: "If she has the teaspoon
the right way up she can drink from it". There is also the account of Porter
(1936) whose Keas Nestor notabilis , if given a tin, would use it to bale out
a container of water. "They have a large enamel tray for a bath which
holds several gallons of water; this they have to empty with a cigarette tin
or cup, each bird having a turn at baling out the water. Like children, they
love to play about with water, and are never happier than when banging
articles about in their water tray and making a splash." It would not seem
from this account that the purpose of the baling was to get at the water,
thus the bird was not using the tin or cup as a mechanical means to an end.
Rose Fyleman (1936) wrote "I should like to mention here that I once
knew a cockatoo that would use the empty shells of monkey nuts to scoop
up water when this was too low in his water-pot to be within reach of its
beak." Unfortunately it is not clear whether this bird was using its foot
or its beak. The phrasing suggests that the bird needed the water for
drinking, and if this is so it is more likely that the baler was held in the foot.
A number of Northern Blue Jays Cyanocitta cristata raised and kept in
a laboratory were observed tearing pieces from pages of newspapers and
utilising them as tools to rake in food pellets which were otherwise out of
reach (Jones and Kamil 1973). The birds also employed twig-like objects
for the same purpose. A second kind of behaviour that also surely con-
stitutes tool-use was also reported for these birds. A jay several times took
a piece of paper, dropped it in its water dish and swept it round its food
cup picking up food dust as if with a sponge. The jay would then either eat
pieces of dust off the paper or ingest the paper itself. To the first kind of
behaviour the authors applied the term "tool-making" (as well as tool-use).
Their paper is illustrated with frames enlarged from a 16mm film.
Goodman and Fisk (1973) in describing the breeding behaviour of
captive Striped Owls Rhinoptynx clamator said "Small chicks, unsteady,
may fall into the bloody carcasses of the chickens from which their food
is coming. The female .... has been observed to gather pieces of dried
leaves in her bill and use them to wipe the blood from both faces and
breasts of the young". (To be continued )

A QUARTER CENTURY OF AVICULTURE IN RETROSPECT

By F. C. Barnicoat (Johannesburg, S. Africa)
This year many cultural institutions in the United Kingdom have been
prompted to mark their achievements over the last twenty-five years in
some way, and it is perhaps appropriate for us to look back on this period
in aviculture. A photograph of King George VI studying the Budgerigars
in an aviary was published in the Magazine twenty-five years ago as a
tribute to his memory, and it is well known that the Queen has more than
a passing interest in the stock of Budgerigars that she still maintains at
Windsor, an interest inherited in particular from her grandfather, George
V, who was a patron of the Avicultural Society and whose Silver Jubilee
was marked by a special issue of the Magazine for August 1935 with a
coloured plate of a Galah on the cover. We, too, congratulate Queen
Elizabeth and wish her well on the occasion of her Silver Jubilee.
Those who possess the twenty-five volumes of the avicultural
magazine published in the reign of Queen Elizabeth II have an extremely
attractive, interesting and useful reference work on aviculture. Its pages
reflect a wealth of breeding triumphs achieved, often for the first time,
with very rare and difficult species. These breedings include several species
of bird of paradise, hummingbird, sunbird, niltava, motmot, starling,
mynah and many others. We are grateful to all those busy bird keepers
who have taken the time and trouble to record their experiences, often
with meticulous attention to detail, for the benefit of others.
In particular we remember the officials of the Avicultural Society, past
and present, who have striven to maintain the extremely high standard of
the journal, a task that is increasingly worrying in these inflation-ridden
days. The avicultural magazine began in the Victorian era at the
subscription rate of five shillings per annum for 12 issues, and it now costs
five pounds for four issues! When Queen Elizabeth II came to the throne,
our subscription rate was #1. 10s. for six issues. However, the total number
of pages per volume has remained more or less static at around 240
throughout the twenty-five years.
Many great aviculturists have passed on in this quarter century. There
come to mind the Duke of Bedford, Amsler, Miss Chawner, Ezra, Decoux,
Vane, Lewis, de Quincey, Miss Knobel, Boosey, Silver, Porter, Partridge,
Lendon, McCullagh and, towering above them all, David Seth-Smith,
virtually a foundation member (December 1894!) and amazingly successful
Editor of the Magazine, who died in 1963. The great pioneers of aviculture ,
have been swept away almost completely. It is indeed cause for great
thankfulness that a few personalities who had first-hand contact with that
bygone age are still spared to us--among them our President, Dr Jean
Delacour, surely the greatest living aviculturist; A. A. Prestwich, Secretary

of unparalleled drive for over twenty years and Miss Phyllis Barclay-Smith
distinguished Editor for 35 years.
There is little doubt that we have lived through a golden age of avicul-
ture. Twenty-five years ago the world was just recovering from the devasta-
tion of the Second World War and enthusiasm was keen to get back to
the high standards that had prevailed just before the outbreak of each of
the World Wars. But now there was one tremendous advantage--air
transport. This has brought delicate groups like the hummingbirds and
tanagers within the range of ordinary enthusiasts. Then., too, there have
been great advances in feeding techniques and particularly in the field of
vitamin and other dietary additives; also medicine has taken strides forward
and there is now greater hope for the sick bird than at any time in the past.
These factors have resulted in a greater quantity and variety of exotic
wild birds being freely available during this period than at any previous
time and probably than ever again.
Conservation measures by governments in many countries and political
troubles in others are inexorably reducing the availability of birds for
aviculture and many of the sights we have taken for granted may well be
as irrevocable as that of the Pink-headed Ducks swimming on the lovely
ponds in Fox warren Park. Look long on the marvellous variety of birds
we have today: we may not see the like again.
There are definite signs of an awareness that aviculture must become
self sufficient through aviary breeding and that it should make a tangible
contribution to conservation has slowly taken root during this period. In
1952 the aim of the average fancier was probably to amass an interesting
and impressive collection. Of course this outlook does die hard, because
collecting is a basic drive in man, but fewer serious fanciers would sub-
scribe to this view today, and the achievement of Norman Nicholson, who
in 1963 reached his thirtieth generation of Red-headed Parrotfinches, is
the type of achievement that perhaps would be most envied now.
In the period under consideration, some of the birds that are easy to
maintain in confinement have been bred on a very sound basis. The
Zebra Finch has become virtually domesticated. In 1953 argument raged
about the name for the new mutant form that had just reached England,
and eventually it was settled as Chestnut-flanked. Subsequently the
"Penguin" and other mutations have appeared alongside those of pre-war
days, starting with the "White" in the early twenties. A special Zebra
Finch Society has continued to flourish during this quarter century, and
this delightful little bird is now being bred to a standard for exhibition in
a number of different and attractive varieties. Today a similar situation
exists with the Bengalese, the long domesticated Sharp-tailed Finch.
Though a somewhat more difficult subject, the Gouldian Finch has also
been extensively bred, the inheritance laws governing the head colour in
this species were first published in the pages of the Magazine, and one
mutation at least, the "White-breasted" has been firmly established in all

head colour phases. There is no specialist club for Gouldians yet, but there
are specialistic books on them. The Cockatiel is yet another bird that has
been so frequently bred in this quarter-century that many mutant forms
of it have been developed, surely none more beautiful than the first one
to appear, the "White" which was initially put on the map by the late
Mrs Moon of the U.S.A.
In the fields of parrotlike birds, waterfowl and gamebirds, very great
advances have been made. It would be interesting if persons better qualified
to do the task than myself would come forward and describe what has
been achieved in each of these fields over the last twenty-five years. All I
can say is that the scene today must be very different from that described
by that authority, E. N. T. Vane, in 1954 on ^ ie occasion of the Diamond
Jubilee of the Avicultural Society. Stocks then were very low and so many
species were represented by old and odd specimens. The brief lifting of the
"Parrot Ban" (1951-53) had let a number of interesting birds into the
United Kingdom and the idea that this stock would have to be propagated
had certainly caught on. By the time the ban was re-lifted in 1966, nothing
could be exported from Australia and serious aviary-breeding of many
species was under way in several countries. Most of the grass parrakeets,
rosellas and the polyteline parrakeets have continued to do particularly
well, and since 1966 many species of parrotlike birds, principally from
South America and the Australasian Islands, seldom if ever seen before
in aviaries, have come onto the market, albeit in small numbers. Numerous
first breedings have occurred, especially among the lorikeets and cockatoos,
and many problems have been solved, none more important than the
control of intestinal worms, which were perhaps responsible for many of
the unaccountable losses and breeding failures of an earlier age.
At the beginning of the reign Sir Peter Scott had only just started out
with the Hawaiian Goose project, which is among the greatest avicultural
success stories of all time, for the species now seems secure. The Wildfowl
Trust has done great work; also the Ornamental Pheasant Trust, a great
moment coming in 1967 when six pairs of captivity-bred Swinhoe's
Pheasants were returned to the wilds in Taiwan. Today the World
Pheasant Association is doing good work in organising and propagating
existing stocks of threatened species. Major Iain Grahame's successful
raising of the Blood Pheasant in 1971 was a notable event.
Moreover, to show that the age of discovery is not yet exhausted, there
was discovered in i960 by an expedition to Mindanao in the Philippines
a new species of parrotfinch, Erythrura coloria , which is very like a Blue-
faced Parrotfinch with a bright red crescent on the sides of its face. I was
thrilled to see this species which our forbears never knew, breeding well
in quite small cages in Dr Burkhard's establishment in Switzerland in 1972.
Alas! many opportunities, too, have been neglected. The story of the
Cuban Finch is typical. In the early 'fifties it was freely available for about
#2 per pair. It is a free breeder, but perhaps because it was cheap, no

one was interested in propagating it on a substantial basis. The Com-
munist take-over in Cuba ended the supply. Today this delightful little
bird is practically unobtainable, and only at an exorbitant figure. Our
Australian friends alone, isolated aviculturally since 1939, have methodi-
cally bred this bird, and it is a lasting triumph to them that Cuban Finches
are still freely available in their country at prices within the range of anyone.
Let us hope some enterprising aviculturists get busy in other parts of the
world.
Closing doors of avicultural opportunity have come to mark this age,
none more drastic than the Australian export ban set up at the end of 1959.
The lovely Australian finches had been exported in their thousands and
suddenly the supply ceased. Today, however, the situation is not as bleak
as many people expected. Very substantial quantities of Long-tailed,
Heck's, Parson and Masked Grassfinches, Diamond Sparrows, Bicheno,
Plum-headed, Star and Chestnut-breasted Finches are bred under con-
trolled conditions, frequently with the aid of Bengalese as foster parents,
mainly on the Continent, from where considerable numbers are exported.
The Australian Finch Society is fostering the breeding of these fine aviary
birds and I believe that if the existing "know-how" had been in vogue
eighteen years ago, even the rarer and more difficult species like the
Pictorella, Yellowrump, Crimson Finch, Red-browed Finch and Painted
Finch might have been well established today. Even as matters stand we
have proved that aviculture does not always necessarily depend on wild-
caught stock.
The challenges of aviculture have come to be greater than at any previous
time. No doubt there will always be many people who will dabble in avi-
culture on an amateur basis: I intend no slight, for they are the salt of
our earth. But I should say that these twenty-five years have seen the rise
of professionalism in aviculture. Most of the really difficult breedings are
achieved in zoos and bird gardens and the phenomenal rise in the price
of birds now makes the breeding of the more easily handled species on a
grand scale an attractive commercial enterprise. The private individual
today seldom has the means or the time to keep more than a few birds or
concentrate on more than one or two species, where he can, however, fill
a valuable niche. The scene in the avicultural world has greatly changed
from that of twenty-five years ago, but the future is not altogether without
hope.

This species, Geotrygon versicolor , endemic to the island of Jamaica, is
highly esteemed by aviculturists because the birds show interesting
behaviour and are among the most colourful of doves.
In 1973 the Berlin Zoo acquired two pairs and one year later they started
breeding. One pair built a nest in an indoor aviary (4x3 m.), the other in
an adjacent heavily planted outdoor aviary (4x5 m.). The birds lived
peacefully with a group of Schalow's Turacos. Our Jamaican Ground
Doves receive a diet consisting of high quality softbill food, pigeon seed
mixture and plenty of sweet fruits. Pieces of banana are very much liked
by them. As the pairs tend to be aggressive towards one another, they are
separated because the heated indoor aviary would be too small for all of
them. The original pairs imported from Great Britain bred as follows:

EGG-LAYING PATTERNS AND INCUBATION PERIODS
OF SOME BIRDS AT THE JERSEY ZOOLOGICAL PARK

By Jeremy J. C. Mallinson (Zoological Director) and
John J. Mallet (Curator of Birds)
A comprehensive record system in operation since the inception of the
Jersey Wildlife Preservation Trust (Durrell 1974) has gathered a large
amount of data concerning the egg-laying and incubation periods of birds
in the Trust's collection.
It has been shown (Kear 1966) that laying dates of various goose species
in the Wildfowl Trust's collection at Slimbridge (latitude 51 0 44&amp;apos; N.)
could be related to the latitude of their natural breeding range. More
recently (Murton and Kear 1973) the swans, shelducks and sheldgeese
have been similarly studied, and the nature and evolution of breeding in
relation to day-length has been discussed. These deliberations have shown
that there is a clear relationship between the mid-latitude of the natural
breeding range of each goose species or subspecies and the onset of
egg-laying at Slimbridge.
In this paper we are concerned with the breeding patterns of some
37 bird specimens of seven different orders at the Jersey Zoological Park
(49 0 iT N. 2* I2 f W.). The date of laying of the first egg produced every
year is recorded, often as far back as 1964, and from such records the
median date of first eggs has been calculated and is shown in the table.

The Cape Barren or Cereopsis Goose breeds in the winter, whilst most
of its supposed relations are in reproductive condition only in spring or
summer. Rear and Murton (1973) showed that swans from any particular
latitude lay earlier in the year--that is, respond to shorter day-lengths--
than do goose species from the same latitude; geese, on the whole, need
a longer photoperiod than swans. The photo-response of Cereopsis was
found to be unrelated to the pattern shown by the true geese or sheldgeese,
but closer to that of the swans. The median date for first eggs of Cereopsis
Geese at Slimbridge over 23 years has been January 1st. In 14 similar
records for this species at Jersey, first eggs were laid between November
I5th-February 6th, with a median date of December 7th, thus confirming

some of the earlier findings on the laying pattern of this species in Europe.
I have been unable to find information on the exact ranges of many of
the pheasant species listed, so a direct comparison with the geese is not
possible. However, the mid-latitude of the natural breeding range of
White Eared Pheasant is 31 0 N., and of Swinhoe's Pheasant 23 0 N.; and
the median dates of the first egg for these two species in Jersey (49 0 N.) is
May 22nd and March 28th respectively. This suggests that there may be
a relationship between latitude and the onset of egg-laying, since, of
course, the White Eared Pheasant comes from a higher latitude than
Swinhoe's and lays when the days are longer. Further investigation is
necessary.
With White Eared Pheasant, it is interesting to note that in 27 records
of the five different specimens who laid eggs for a period of four years
and over, the median dates of first eggs are within an 11-day period
(May I2th-23rd). A further example of consistency in the onset of
egg-laying by a species of pheasant is provided by a Lady Amherst's
Pheasant, who, during the course of seven years, laid all her first eggs
within a period of seven days--April 12th, 13th, 10th, 7th, 13th, 7th, 8th.
The importance of captive breeding units that permit the study of the
biology of various mammals at the Jersey Zoological Park was illustrated
in a previous paper (Mallinson 1973). In this preliminary examination of
egg-laying patterns at Jersey, some of the results have confirmed the
findings of others (Kear and Murton 1973, Murton and Rear 1973) as
well as providing us with a fuller understanding of bird reproductive
patterns.

HAND-REARING THE AUSTRALIAN CASSOWARY
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.944816361111111" page_id="56386444"  page_num="106" year="" vol="">
On 15th October 1970 a pair of Australian Cassowaries Casuarius
casuarius (3-4 months old) were put into an enclosure which measured
120 x 20 m in which there was a shelter 2x4m with a communicating
door. Whenever the temperature dropped below --io*C at night, the
birds were kept inside the shelter. Since their arrival at the park, the pair
have never been separated, but sometimes the female, naturally the larger
of the two, becomes quite aggressive towards her partner. Fortunately,
however, the numerous trees planted in the enclosure serve a useful
purpose during these attacks, for the male can hide among them.
Food
Food consists of a variety of fresh fruit, carrots, lettuce, pellets (for
sheep), dog biscuits, lucerne pellets and bread soaked in water. The
ration of food is about 6 kg for both birds. During the first cold spells
each year there is a decline in the food intake.
Egg-laying
The first clutch of three eggs was laid in May 1975 on some straw in the
shelter and brooded by the male, but the eggs disappeared shortly after-
wards. In 1976, the first egg was laid on 18th April in the middle of the
enclosure, a second on 23rd April and the third on 27th April. This time
the male ignored the eggs, so they were placed in an incubator. A second
clutch of three eggs was laid in the shelter on 1st, 5th and 10th May
respectively; this time the male began to incubate. Everything went well
until 30th May when one of the eggs was broken and the other two
abandoned eggs had to be placed in an incubator. As indicated by Fisher
(1968) and Worrel et al. (1975), eggs of cassowaries are laid at intervals of
4-5 days.
Incubation
The incubator was a type Favor F4, kept at a temperature of 35.5*C
(Flieg 1973), and the eggs turned four times per day. All five eggs were
fertile and hatched after 50-52 days (52 days after Worrel et al 3 47-53 days
after Fisher). Unlike the rhea, the chick does not call while still in the egg,
but movement is audible just before hatching. This takes between 6-10
hours until the final hatching.
Rearing
At birth the young were placed in a box 0.5 x 1 m which was heated to
30*C at one end. After 15 days they were transferred to a large pen 2x1m,

and three weeks later into an enclosure 3x3m, the floor of which was
covered with sand.
Food
The food given to the young cassowaries consisted of fresh fruit (apples,
bananas, tomatoes, raisins, rowan berries, etc.) carrots, lettuce, hard-boiled
eggs (with the shells broken up), minced meat, small millet and alpiste
seeds, granulated game starter pellets, and a "quick-growing" game food. A
mineral complement (CR 13) was added, and to regulate the metabolism
phospho-calcique (oesteocynesine LHF) was added daily. A complete meal
was given in the mornings; then at midday the birds received a ration of
apples, carrots and lettuce only. The average amount of food consumed
daily by each bird at 2-3 months old was 3.3 kg (2.9 kg for adults).
As pointed out by Fisher, large pieces of food are swallowed whole, and
because of the birds' voracious appetites it seems wiser to divide the food
equally and distribute it four times per day. The change to an adult diet
needs to be done gradually; otherwise it may cause a loss of appetite.
In the aviary grit or small stones were mixed in with the sand, but
unlike adult cassowaries the stones were not found in the droppings,
indicating that these were not taken by the young.
At the age of three months young cassowaries drink about 1-1.5 litres of
water a day.

THE BREEDING OF FLAMINGOS
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999757352941176" page_id="56386446"  page_num="108" year="" vol="">
A flock of flamingos was established at the park during 1969 and 1970 and
was composed of 11 Caribbean Phoenicopterus ruber ruber , 8 Chilean
P. ruber chilensis and 11 Greater P. ruber roseus. There have not been any
introductions since. They are kept in an enclosure 100 m2 in the centre of
which is a pool 20 m in diameter. They share this with several species of
whistling ducks, teal and other ducks and geese. Their food is put in water
and consists of carrots, lettuce, beef, fish, dog biscuits and granulated
pellets, minced and made into a soup. It does not contain any colouring
agent or medicine but a mineral (CR 13) is added once a week.
The flamingos built nests for the first time in 1973. The clay earth,
however, dried out very quickly in the sun and the nests were not completed.
In 1975 an effort was made to create a more suitable breeding place which
was increased in size the following year. This was done by adding mud,
earth composed of plant matter such as straw, mixed together and kept
permanently moist. At the end of April the birds began displaying,
copulating and nest-building. A box containing salt was then placed at the
water's edge and salt was sprinkled over the mud daily. Eight nests were
built varying in height from 30 to 60 cm and the first eggs were laid before
these were completed. Seven eggs were laid between May 12th and
June 5th and the parents turned these five or six times per day. Chicks
hatched only from the first two eggs to be laid. A Greater Flamingo was
hatched on June 14th (incubation period 33 days) and a Caribbean on
June 15th (incubation period 34 days). Two eggs disappeared and three
others were infertile. The chicks began to leave the nest at 4-5 days; the
parents helped them with their bills to climb back again. They were fed by
regurgitation at irregular intervals.
All went well during the fledging period. The Caribbean chick develop-
ed much quicker than the Greater. After eight months it had grown more or
less to the size of the adult and was quite pink. The Greater, on the other
hand, was much smaller, about half the size of the adult and lacking the
pink plumage. It still begged for food from the parents but without success.
As recommended by J. Rear (flamingos, Foyser, Berkhamsted, 1975)
both chicks were pinioned when only 1-2 days of age.
Although the three subspecies live together, it is interesting to note that

Lincoln Park Zoo is owned and operated by the Chicago Park District
and is located at the edge of Lake Michigan on the eastern border of the
city. For many years this 13 hectare park has been best known for its fine
collection of mammals, with particular emphasis on edentates, felids and
primates.
Although the bird collection here has long been one of considerable
size and variety, its reproductive output has been minute. As an example,
while the 1975 census listed 760 birds of 234 species on hand, less than a
dozen forms produced offspring. The reasons for such a small output were
fairly obvious and included overcrowding, an abundance of unmated birds
and inadequate machinery for artificially incubating eggs. With this in
mind and under the supervision of Dr Lester Fisher, the park director, a
plan was made to improve the existing bird facilities, acquire needed
equipment and upgrade the entire bird collection. During 1976 the total
avian population was decreased by almost 200 birds and new emphasis
has been placed on giving a few species with reproductive potential a more
adequate environment in which to breed. In addition to pairs of such
unusual species as Andean Condor Vultur gryphus , Nicobar Pigeon
Caloenas nicobarica, Black Palm Cockatoo Frobosciger aterrimus and Galah
Cockatoo Eolophus roseicapillus already in the collection, the generous
cooperation of a number of U.S. zoos has resulted in the acquisition of
mates for (or pairs) of others, either by exchange or by breeding loan.
Inca Terns Larosterna inca , Eclectus Parrots Eclectus roratus , Tawny
Frogmouths Podargus strigoides, Rothschild's Mynahs Leucopsar rothschildi
and Green Hunting Jays Cissa chinensis are some of the more interesting
items in this category.
The most important acquisition plans for the coming year are centred

KEVIN J. BELL--NOTES FROM LINCOLN PARK ZOO
around a shipment of African birds expected in late spring and undertaken
as a group importation with several other mid-western zoos. Selected pairs
of kingfishers, touracos, sunbirds, shrikes, weavers, etc., have been
ordered to round out the collection needs in this area.
At the present time the available bird facilities at Lincoln Park include
two waterfowl ponds, an eagle aviary with five separate exhibits each of
228 cubic metres and a bird house. Constructed in 1900 and renovated in
1963, the bird house consists of a central free flight, naturally planted,
exhibit surrounded by 25 glass-fronted cages each 1.6 metres deep,
3 metres high and ranging from 1.5 to 9 metres in length. Only the central
free flight has natural lighting. The north end of the bird house has two
shallow ponds in front of a naturalistic gunite cliff and this space acts as a
winter holding area for tropical waterfowl, cranes, flamingos and pelicans.
New plans are now under study for an off exhibit propagation building
for rare and endangered species and a winter facility for flamingos was
incorporated into a waterfowl area renovation plan soon to be imple-
mented. This renovation project will include dredging our present water-
fowl pond, constructing four waterfowl breeding islands and replanting
the entire area surrounding the pond. A glass-fronted exhibit for winter
viewing of flamingos will be situated adjacent to the flamingo breeding area
on the pond. A keeper work area and holding cages will be located beneath
the flamingo facility.
Although 1977 may be the first year for Lincoln Park to realize a major
increase in the reproduction of its bird collection, 1976 did provide some
interesting hatchings. Greater Magellan and Snow Geese, Black and Mute
Swans, Crested Wood Partridges, Nicobar Pigeons, a Blue and Yellow
Macaw, Plum-headed Parrakeets, Superb Starlings and Blue and Grey
Tanagers were among the species hatched here during 1976.

The first full register of parrots bred in the British Isles (in the past
year) was published by The Parrot Society during April. This well
produced booklet lists a total of 10,113 young of some 90 species (excluding
Budgerigars) and it is estimated that this is approximately half of what was
actually bred during 1976, for, as was to be expected, some members
failed to send in returns, and non-members might not have known of the
register.
It is stated that five people were known to have bred the Amboina
Island King Parrakeet but only one made a return for the register. A total
of 3,224 Cockatiels, nearly half of them the normally coloured birds, the
rest being t# lutino, pied, pearled, Isabella, yellow-barred, primrose and
cinnamon", were recorded and among the returns were 366 Pennant's,
692 Golden-mantled Rosellas, 149 Mealy Rosellas, 360 Stanley Parrakeets,
557 Bourke's, 871 Turquoisine and 926 Splendid Grass Parrakeets.

The very small Sarothrura rails (flufftails) of which seven species occur
in Africa and two in Madagascar, are little known in aviculture.
bokmakierie (December 1976) contains a note by Mr Len Gilliard on the
two species, the Buff-spotted Flufftail S. elegans and the Red-chested
S. rufa that are found in the Transvaal. Mr Gilliard relates that while
recording the calls at night, he discovered that they were coming from
quite high up in trees, one at about 8 m. from the ground and the other
rather lower. The former is recorded by Roberts as climbing into bushes
at sunset. Those who have kept the South American Red and White
Crake Laterallus leucopyrrhus may have noticed its fondness for climbing.

the body plumage is of the same shade of grey. The dark form has a dark
grey neck, not a black one, and there again, much of the rest of the plumage
is of the same shade. The two are considered by some to be different species
and by others to be conspecific. Presumably their ranges do not overlap,
but it would be interesting to see what the progeny of mating the light to

In May and June 1971 single Trumpeter Finches Rhodopechys githa-
ginea , new to the British Isles, were seen in Suffolk and in Sutherland,
and in October 1973 another was seen on Alderney. There have been
records of this species in southern Spain for some years where it has been
trapped in some numbers. It seems too much to hope that this bird of the
semi-desert could ever adapt to life in the British Isles.

birds. A handbook for keepers, breeders and dealers of/in gallinaceous
birds and doves). By H-S. Raethel, C. von Wissel and M. Stefani
(1976). Published by J. Neumann, Neudamm, Melsungen, Germany.
Price DM 58.
This comprehensive and informative book deals with virtually every
species of pheasant, partridge, quail, guineafowl, grouse or turkey that
the aviculturist is ever likely to get his hands on, and also with 18 species
of pigeon (dove).
The introductory chapters deal with such subjects as the purchase,
transport, housing, feeding, breeding, etc., of pheasants and allied birds;
the building of aviaries; diseases and their treatment, and so on. I am no
pheasant expert, having only kept and bred Golden Pheasants and
Red-legged Partridges, but most of the advice and information appears
eminently sound. Here and there, perhaps, there is something that might
be open to question (is it really necessary that broody domestic hens
should never be given green food or soft food, for example ?) or not fully
applicable to the English scene. For instance, although (p. 77) the advice
about exercising caution when getting rid of one's neighbours' cats is as
valid here as in Germany, it would be unwise to follow too openly the
advice to catch troublesome Sparrowhawks and Goshawks in traps baited
with live pigeons and then sell them to falconers!
The rest of the book consists of accounts of individual species and of
the various races of such more or less polytypic species as the Silver and
Common Pheasants. These include distribution, description, a synopsis
of the bird's biology in the wild, and information or suggestions as to
how to treat it in captivity. I learnt here much that was new to me, but
would have liked references to the original sources of the information in
some cases. Is it, for example, true (pp. 119 and 120) that Golden Pheasants
are monogamous in a wild state, and that even in Europe where kept at
liberty each pair defends a clearly defined territory from which it drives
off even its own young when they are independent ? And I certainly found
my Red-legged Partridges, fond though they were of greenstuff, ready to
take much else besides the grass shoots here suggested as a mainstay.
The book is very profusely illustrated with both coloured pictures and
photographs, some of the latter showing interesting points of behaviour,
such as the Crowned Pigeon feeding its young and in defensive threat
display (opposite p. 396) and Prairie Chickens and Sharp-tailed Grouse
displaying (opposite p. 361). I feel, however, that many of the coloured
plates hardly do the birds they depict full justice: their plumage looks a

little unkempt and the colours, as reproduced in my copy at least, fall
short of the brilliance and richness of the birds themselves.
Anyone who is interested in the birds it deals with, and can read German,
would, I think, be well advised to buy this book. It is to be hoped it will
soon appear in an English translation.

A GUIDE TO BETTER HATCHING. By Janet Stromberg. 1976.
Published by Stromberg Publishing Company, Fort Dodge, Iowa,
U.S.A. $4.95.
My first impression of this book was that it was going to be very much
like any other published with most of the information given being directed
at the poultry industry and very little information for the private collector
who specialises in ornamental birds that are far more delicate and require
a specialised technique than the hardy domestic poultry.
Obtaining information on hatching techniques, using incubators, is
always a problem but this book answers many of these queries. Being an
almost entirely ornamental waterfowl breeder, I found this work to be the
most informative of its type published to date.
The many problems from laying to successful rearing are also given a
good coverage. The text is concise and easy to assimilate with very few
statistics that mean nothing to a large percentage of people who rear
ornamental birds.
"A Guide to Better Hatching" was obviously written with mainly
domestic poultry in mind, but much of the information is directly useful
to all propagators.
It is obtainable from Stromberg Pets Unlimited, Pine River, Minnesota
56474, U.S.A.

A Treatment for Feather-Plucking
The well known German avicultural magazine gefxederte welt (March
1977) contains a very interesting article by U. Schmitt of Walldorf, West
Germany, entitled "Experiences with feather-pluckers" and I feel sure
that this account will throw new light on the problem of feather-plucking
in parrots. The author has successfully treated three feather-plucking
macaws by giving them "a knife's tip full" of common salt dissolved in
500 ml. of water daily. The result was impressive: all the birds drank the
salty water readily and one stopped feather-plucking at once and the other
two did so within a few months and a year respectively.
Although the giving of a weak solution of NaCl by means of the drinking
water may not be a cure in all cases, it may help some to regain the normal
plumage.

Head-Scratching in the Carrion Crow
</table>
<bodyText confidence="0.984986714285714" page_id="56386453"  page_num="115" year="" vol="">
In A.M. 1974 pp. 143-146, K. L. Simmons mentioned having wit-
nessed head-scratching whilst in flight in the Rook Corvus frugilegus. As
I can find no reference to such behaviour in the Carrion Crow C. corone, I
thought the following may be of interest.
On 21 st April I saw one of a pair of Carrion Crows head-scratching
whilst in flight. It was obvious from the bird's movements that extreme
irritation was the reason for this somewhat unusual behaviour. The left
foot was used (directly) to scratch the head and during the whole procedure,
which lasted approximately 15 seconds, the right foot could be seen to
tread air. The wings, although held open, ceased to beat thus causing the
bird to lose height considerably before it once again resumed normal
flight.
The crow in question is one of a pair which has for many years nested
annually in a tree some 200 yards from my place of employment.

The Late R. G. Kirkham
It is with great sadness that I have to report the death, on 26th January
1977, of Gerald Kirkham in Mombasa. Gerry, as he was known to his
many friends, had been a member of the Avicultural Society since 1952.
He was a keen aviculturist and over the years kept many species of
foreign birds, many of which he collected personally in his travels abroad.
It was probable, however, that he was best known for his fine collection
of parrots which he got together at his home at that time near Dublin.
Although I knew him previously it was soon after my wife and I came
to Rode sixteen years ago that we became close friends. He was one of
the kindest and most generous of men whom I have ever known and it
was because of this that his collection of parrots eventually came to Rode.
He always took a keen interest in our progress and was a regular visitor
whenever he was home from his travels. Latterly he spent much of his
time in Kenya and it was through him that we made our first trip there.
He and his Secretary, Lucy Bampton (who was later to become his wife)
paved the way for us and accompanied us on the most exciting never-to-
be-forgotten trip I have ever made through the game parks of Kenya,
Tanzania and Uganda.
Gerry was a good aviculturist and bred from most of his birds. He was
awarded the Society's medal for the first breeding of the Greater Pata-
gonian Conure, I remember--just beating Reg Partridge who bred them
in the same year. I am pleased to say we still have a flock of their descen-
dants at Rode--as indeed we have the progeny of many of his birds. This
I know pleased him.
Perhaps he will be remembered by his many friends most of all for his
sense of humour and his ability to entertain with his fund of funny stories.
He will be greatly missed by us all.

Mrs Rosemary Grantham reports:
Another successful wine and cheese party was held at Burlington House
on May 17th when Mr Len Hill introduced a film made by Lord Dulverton.
Entitled "The Woodmen and the Wild", its theme was the wildlife of the
Cotswolds and there were many delightful shots of some of our most
familiar birds, including Siskins feeding on larch shoots and Crossbills
feeding on the cones.
The evening was distinguished by the presence of our President, Dr Jean
Delacour, who joined the Society 61 years ago-before any other living
member. Now 87, Dr Delacour's good health still allows him to divide his
time between America and Europe.
A VISIT TO CHESTNUT LODGE
On May 29th members and their guests visited Chestnut Lodge,
Cobham, at the kind invitation of Miss Ruth Ezra to see the collection
belonging to her and to Mr Raymond Sawyer. Among the many rare and
interesting species were Splendid Starlings (bred in these aviaries during
1975 for the first time in this country) and breeding again this year.
Rothschild's Crackles, Palawan Peacock Pheasants and Satyr Tragopans
were among the other notable breedings.
A curious dilute mutation of a Pionus, believed to be the Bronze-winged
is in the collection. Crowned and Demoiselle Cranes and Vulturine
Guineafowl are free in the lovely garden: waterfowl and flamingos live on a
pond in front of the house.

Pionopsitta pileata
By George A. Smith (Peterborough)
For six or seven years, until 1975, somewhere between 20 and 50
Red-capped Parrots used to be annually imported from Paraguay. Usually
they arrived in two or three mixed consignments containing macaws and
Amazon parrots. The majority of the Red-caps were adult: often they
were temporarily crippled because the flight feathers were cut. They were
not highly regarded, and retailed for between 15 and 25 pounds a pair.
As they are naturally confiding birds, they ought to have borne their
captivity well: indeed some people, especially those who got them soon
after they landed, kept them without loss. Most died, however, before
they had been in the country a month. Of 20 examined post mortem five
were shown to have suffered from Newcastle Disease (Fowl Pest), nine
from an influenza-like virus, four from a coli-septicaemia (which so often
follows overcrowding and continual stress) and two had aspergillosis.
Many of the imports may have died from starvation because they were
notoriously difficult to pursuade to eat domestic seeds.
Red-capped Parrots are not particularly brilliantly coloured nor, except
in the early evening and morning, are they vivacious. From their subse-
quent history it appears that the greater number of people who had been
fortunate enough to get healthy individuals did not subsequently regard
them highly for, in many cases, they were soon put back into the bird
trade. As Red-caps only too obviously feel the cold, some might have died
during the winters. The overall consequence has been that, of the 200
(and possibly as many as 400 or 500 if we take into consideration the losses
with the trappers) taken from the wild, not more than 40, perhaps even
fewer than 30, are alive today. And only Signor Bertagnolio (1975), in
Italy, appears to have bred them successfully: although at least three
other persons, in the U.K., have had chicks that died before leaving the
nest. According to the I.U.C.N., Red-capped Parrots possibly are in some
need of protection: it may well be that, therefore, further importation
will be prohibited. As they seem only too willing to breed, there really
can be no excuse if we allow them to die out as aviary birds. With this
thought in mind I have recently tried to gather a breeding nucleus and
now have three pairs: one of which belongs to the Granthams; a male to

Description

<bodyText confidence="0.98729219047619" page_id="56386464"  page_num="120" year="" vol="">
Their scientific name of the sleek (red-)capped parrot is appropriate.
Like so many of the American parrots the red, of the head, is a simple
pure colour such as is, seemingly, not found in Old World species.
Illustrations can be found in Astley (1905), Low (1972) and Forshaw
(1973). They are smallish parrots and, although one fat hen weighs 135 g
and a small male 95 g, the average weight of the six is 119 g. The most
characteristic features are their relatively small head and their short tail.
The slate-blue bill reminds me of For pus parrotlets.
General behaviour
Red-capped Parrots appear to fly fast and with very great manoeuvra-
bility during which the blue underside to the flight feathers is very notice-
able. That they must go to the ground is proved by their gizzards being
found to contain grit; but I have never, yet, seen them do so. It is curious
therefore that, unlike practically all other tree-feeding parrots, they should
scratch their head by lifting a foot over the wing in the same manner as
do ground-feeding parrots. With the coming of evening their character
changes: they are more alert, less tame and they fly animatedly about,
calling. In this active state they will scurry upsidedown about the netting
of the aviary roof. Their "ratchetty" calls seem only to be given when they
fly about and not, like conures, to scold observers. One male appears to
eat but niger and canary seed; the remainder have striped sunflower,
hemp and pine nuts. All are very fond of green foods and fruits; all eat
nectar but rarely will they take bread and milk. They have not been seen
to water-bathe or to sun themselves.
Breeding
My lack of success with the two pairs acquired for the 1976 breeding
season was assumed to be because the boxes were too exposed and far
too roomy and because one pair were always in chronic ill-health. This
year, 1977, I put three birds (a cock who was a permanent invalid from
air-sacculitis died during the winter) together into a 15-foot square aviary
built underneath a large Japanese cherry tree. Two small (18x6x6 inches)
nest boxes were hung to the wire in full shade. The three parrots were
most amicable: they roosted on the same short perch inside the shelter
with the pair cuddled together and the widow a foot distant. In
the spring it was the single hen who was first seen inspecting the nest
boxes. In late May Peter Paris lent me a male and the cage containing this
was hung from the aviary roof. This did not seem to upset the others and,
as the spare hen was noticed singing to the new arrival as she crawled over
his cage, he was let out after three days. The evening after his release the
resident male chased him along the netting of the roof. But the attacks
were largely scolding, bill-sparring and the like rather than actually getting
into physical conflict. It is regularly noticed that males quarrel with males

and hens with hens; but never male with female.
In early July, too late for breeding this year, I managed to get a third
hen from Herbert Murray. This was put into a small aviary next to the
two breeding pairs. After a week the Granthams kindly lent me a male to
go with it. He was released with the hen directly he arrived. Immediately
he flew over to the hen and started to sing. Singing in Red-caps is a con-
tinual flow of soft chatterings. She, in her turn, just as alert, sang back
whereupon he lunged at her driving her a foot away. Within a few minutes
she flew back and the two sat, very alert, softly singing, about six inches
apart. The hen then sidled up to the male and, lowering her head, began
to press her side under him in an obvious attempt to get him to mate
with her. Instead he gaped, causing her to move away a few inches. Then,
softly singing, she pressed herself into a copulatory stance on the perch
and gently swayed her tail sidewards. The male, to relax his tension, began
to preen. The hen could now approach and she began to preen his lowered
head. Working herself ever closer the hen again tried to press her lowered
body under him to be mated. Instead of which he pecked at her and drove
her a few inches off. I was unable to watch any further, for I had to be
about my business. But this observation and those made on my longer
mated pairs leads me to suspect that the hen can take the initiative in
forming a pair. A mated pair often finish a bout of mutual preening by the
hen pressing herself under the male for him to tread her; but only in the
spring and summer. A male, slightly irritated by his wife's attentions
will drive her off. The hen might well then fly over to the nest area where
she will preen herself or, perhaps, investigate the nest hole. In most cases
the cock then will fly up to sit with his partner near to the nest. Both
sexes are interested in the nest box, although the hen is the more en-
thusiastic, so that hens may be seen chewing at the entrance hole while
the cock sits preening or dozing nearby. Sometimes both will enter, in
which case the male is often found sitting looking out through the hole
while his wife chews away at the interior. On one occasion as I walked
past a box, out of which a pair had just emerged, both threat-walked to
and fro in front of me. Such a threat is often seen in Aratinga and Pyrrhura
conures; consisting of the bill being pushed along the perch with wings
held slightly away from the body. Hens sometimes may regurgitatory-feed
the cock, but is more usual the other way about. Preceding feeding, the
head is jerked sidewards to disgorge the food from the crop rather than
by the more usual up-and-down movement. Rarely both sexes would
rapidly shiver the wings when one fed the other: the wing-shivering was
more frequent after the eggs were laid. These wing-shivers are not so
pronounced as those used by soliciting and very hungry chicks. Sometimes
a male might be seen singing with his bill full of regurgitated food. For
some days before they laid, the hens disappeared inside the box: then,
and during laying and throughout incubation, the males, seemingly,
showed very little interest in the nest. I never, at any time, saw one male

drive the other from the vicinity of the nest. And it was not often that a
male was seen sneaking inside the box to feed his hen. When one of the
hens had been sitting for a week, the other hen, who still had ten days to
go before she laid herself, peered into the occupied nest for some minutes.
During this neither the incubating bird, nor its mate, took offence. In
copulation the male retains a one-footed grip on the perch and does not
change the copulating side.
One bird laid four eggs, commencing on 12th June. The other laid
three, starting on 28th June. The interval between eggs was two and
three days and the average weight of a fresh-laid egg was n-8g (11-5-
12-2). The hen alone incubates, the male sitting quite some way from the
nest and roosting on his own. The hen is fed inside the nest by the cock,
although she is seen off once or so a day. Red-caps appear to be very
seasonal in their captive nesting. From enquiry of those several people
who have had clutches, including those reported here, one has been laid
in late April, three in May, five in June, three in early July and one in
August. The incubation period is 24 days. Two eggs hatched and two
were dead-in-shell: which may have been caused by the cold weather
prevailing throughout most of the incubation. The second clutch was
infertile: the cock had been caged for the previous two years.
Curiously the fresh-hatched chicks were quite unlike the several other
American parrots I have examined ( For pus , Deroptyus , Pionites , Aratinga 3
Ara , Pyrrhura , Pionus and Amazona ) in that the ear-hole was open. In
the Bronze-winged Parrot P. chalcopterus and the Hawk-headed Parrot
D. accipitrinus , for example, the ears are sealed for as long as a month.
Why Red-capped Parrots should be exceptional may perhaps have an
explanation in that (quite different from the above mentioned parrots)
I did not hear the chicks make any noise when being fed by the parents
until they were beginning to show green feathers. The usual mechanical
juddering of the feeding process was heard from the time that they hatched.
Otherwise the Red-cap chicks were typical American parrots in having
the body covered with a thin, long, white down. That on the head was
much sparser than on the body. The bill was barely swollen at its base
(this is exactly like For pus parrotlets). The graph shows, for an American
parrot, a very rapid rate of growth. At ten days the skin of the head began
to darken; at 11 days the follicles of the second down could be made out
under the skin and at 13 days the eyes were open. By 16 days the second
down had begun to cover the body. When the chicks were handled they
never made any protesting noises other than the squabbling sound of adult
birds and this stopped if I held them more comfortably or if I put them
back inside their nest. After 20 days the hen began to leave them for
longer periods. The chicks were raised on large quantities of green food
(with a preponderance of sow-thistle), red currants, raspberries, logan-
berries and seed (with hemp and pine nuts as the favourites). This diet
was not entirely satisfactory, for the youngest chick had some yellowing

of the facial feathers, the tail and the flight feathers indicative of a lycine
deficiency. This could have been avoided by feeding some animal protein
(bread-and-milk, meat, fly pupae, mealworms). The chicks were male and
female, the cock having just a mere trace of red to his head. They fledged
when 52 and 54 days old. They were extremely steady and were first seen
to feed themselves when five days fledged. They returned to the box to
roost, at night, for many weeks.

Spermophaga ruficapilla
By Malcolm Ellis (Holloway, London)
Some while ago, at a time when I was in Kenya, I heard that the Red-
headed Blue-bill had bred in Mr Syd Downey's aviaries. Not knowing of
any other aviary breeding record for this uncommon member of the
Estrildidae, I wrote to him and suggested that some notes about this
would be of interest to Avicultural Society members. He replied that,
sadly, the young blue-bill had come to grief and he therefore felt unable to
be of help.
A few weeks ago, however, Mr Downey wrote from Langata, Kenya,
that he was happy to let me know that another Red-headed Blue-bill
had hatched and he was kind enough to send the details.
Having previously noticed that blue-bills like a dark area to nest in--if
possible away from other birds, he put the male and female in a small
aviary, alone, and in the darkest corner put some dry grass, in which he
made a hollow nesting area. This was in January: almost immediately
the birds started building in the hollow and soon after were sitting--in
turns. The first eggs must have been infertile, but the birds continued to
take turns in the nest until mid-May. Mr Downey stresses that, so as not
to disturb them, at no time did he go closer to the nest than about 6 ft
(182 cm). On May 20th when he shone a flashlight into the dark nest, he
saw movement, and on May 29th a small black bird, with cream coloured
spots at the sides of its bill, appeared. By June 7th it was starting to feed
itself on white millet. At the time the letter was written (June 12th, 1977),
it was as big as the male bird, but still completely black with no indication
as to its sex. As Mr Downey says, it will be most interesting to see how long
it takes for the sex identifying colours to appear.
Mr Downey has fed the blue-bills (since January) on: (1) White millet;
(2) Sunflower seed; (3) Mealworms; (4) White ants (termites); (5) Minced
meat; (6) Hard-boiled egg; 1-4 are, he is sure, essential; 5-6 may not be.
The Red-headed Blue-bill occurs in Angola, Zaire, Sudan, Uganda,
Kenya and Tanzania. It is a shy, skulking species that, from my knowledge
of it in Kenya (where it occurs only in the west, close to the border with
Uganda), requires most of all damp conditions and usually lives in pairs,
in dense undergrowth by water.
It is a compact species, 5 1-6 in. (1397-152-4 mm.) long. The male has
the head (there is a fine, but evident white ring around the eyes), throat,
breast and flanks, along with the upper tail-coverts, red, the remainder
of the plumage being black. The female's chief distinction consists of white
spotting on the belly. Both sexes have the stout bill pearly-blue with some
red along the cutting edge. The race ( S . r. cana) from north-eastern
Tanzania is said to have grey feathering instead of black.

Mr Downey, in a letter dated August 12th, wrote that the young blue-
bill (which appeared on May 29th) now has its adult plumage, and is in
fact quite difficult to distinguish from its father.
On July 30th, another young Red-headed Blue-bill left the nest. Com-
pared to the earlier one, this was much smaller and probably left prema-
turely. Mr Downey says, that the young bird had a hard time, as it was
the coldest August he can remember during 52 years in Kenya; however,
he is hopeful the blue-bill will survive.
He adds that quite a lot of his birds have been nesting, and lists:
Tambourine Doves, Emerald-spotted Wood Doves, Crested Francolins,
Chestnut, Speke's, and Speckle-fronted Weavers, Blue-naped Mouse-
birds and Black Crakes.

By L. J. Prior (Snetterton, Norfolk)
At the end of the summer of 1976 I put a pair of Lesser Spotted Wood-
peckers into an outdoor aviary measuring 25 x 12 x 7 feet which already
held a pair of the Asiatic Golden Plover Pluvialis dominica. The floor
area was turfed on 3 inches of soil laid on concrete with a small
stream running through the middle and planted with various small shrubs;
also a Polygonum (Russian vine). I placed plenty of half rotten boughs and
tree trunks in the aviary and by the beginning of April 1977 the wood-
peckers were calling and drumming on the wood; also they had started
to excavate several holes, but I did not see them make the nesting hole
as this was at the back of the aviary and hidden from view by another
trunk and was only about 2 feet from the ground. The trunk in which the
nesting hole was made was about 4 feet high and 10 inches in diameter.
From the beginning of May only one bird was seen at a time and I
thought they must be incubating, though I was never really sure because it
was generally the hen who was flying about and, according to bird books,
the hen sits during the day and the cock at night, but in the case of my
birds he did nearly all the incubating. I first saw the birds taking maggots
in their bills to the back of the aviary on May 25th, so knew then that
young had hatched and I therefore started giving mealworms five times
a day and an unlimited supply of maggots. On May 30th I found one
of the young dead near the feeding table, but by watching from the window
of a nearby shed, I could see the adults were still feeding the remaining
young.

126 ramon noegel--breeding Amazona leucocephala
The three young left the nest on June 13th within a few hours of each
other and were very strong on the wing and as large as the parents. I
caught them on the 15th and put rings on them while they could still be
distinguished from the adults: they proved to be one male and two females.
I left them with the parents for another three weeks and when I saw
them taking food for themselves, I caught them in case the father attacked
his son and I put them in a large flight cage in the birdroom: however, next
morning one of the females was dead, so, fearing that they were not eating
enough, I put the two survivors back with the parents and I left them for
another two weeks and then transferred them to another aviary where,
at the present time (August 8th), they are doing well.
As described, the Lesser Spotted Woodpecker Dendrocopus minor has
been bred by Mr. L. J. Prior and this is believed to be the first success
with this species in this country, but anyone knowing of a previous captive
breeding in Great Britain or Northern Ireland is asked to inform the Hon.

CAPTIVE BREEDING OF AMAZONA LEUCOCEPHALA

By Ramon Noegel (Seffher, Florida)
Of the 33 specimens of Amazona leucocephala at the New Age Ranch,
17 were bred there over the past four years. To my knowledge, no other
leucocephala are being bred in the United States, although several indi-
viduals and two zoos are endeavouring to do so. In 1974, the first breeding
of A. L caymanensis , outside its island habitat, was accomplished at the
New Age Ranch. A. 1 . leucocephala , the Cuban Parrot, has also been bred at
the Ranch for the past three years (1975^ 1976 and 1977). This is, I believe,
a second breeding of the nominate race in the United States on a regular
basis. The first breeding was by an individual aviculturist and the offspring
went to the pet trade. This beautiful and rare Amazon parrot has always
been in great demand commercially, thereby making the obtaining of
breeding stock even more difficult. All of our adult A. /. leucocephala were
long term cage pets and it took an average of four years to bring each one
into breeding condition. One hen we have had for ten years has, at the time
of writing (July 1977)3 produced her first fertile eggs. She readily nested
for the past nine years but always produced infertile eggs. When available,
one of these parrots commands a price of $650 or more, causing another
difficulty to be faced by the conservationists.
Our aviaries are constructed of welded wire and measure 1 x 1 x 4 m. in
length. Perches are placed at each end and the nest box is attached at one
end outside the aviary in order to afford easy inspection by way of a side

door which is level with the nest area. The nest box is 30 x 30 x 50 cm. in
depth. Nesting material consists of clean wood shavings which fill the
box to about one-fourth its depth.
The aviaries are raised about 1J m. above the ground, and are situated
in the Florida rain forest which covers a third of the Ranch. We have
found this type of raised aviary superior to the walk-in aviaries for these
reasons: the birds are not as readily disturbed by the necessity of anyone
entering their enclosure; they soon become aware they are separated from
the keepers by a protective shield of wire and, therefore, display a fearless-
ness when approached. They do not have access to their droppings or
discarded food which might sour within a few hours and cause serious
trouble if eaten. Predators, rats, mice and ants find it almost impossible
to gain access to such aviaries. At no point in this aviary's construction is
the parrots' view obstructed and so similar to these Amazons' native habitat
is our rain forest that it is doubtful they are, for the most part, aware they
are contained. Such an arrangement must greatly contribute to the parrots*
sense of well being and no doubt accounts for their annual breeding
successes.
The length of the aviary (4 m. or 13 ft) is more than adequate for the
health and well being of these small parrots. When you consider that a
specimen will fly back and forth the length of its aviary until the desire
for exercise has been exhausted, you must concede he has accomplished
just as much as any specimen contained in, say, an aviary 9 m. in length.
We have often observed the early morning and late afternoon flight ritual
of these birds who continue to fly back and forth until well satisfied with
their efforts. The most flight activity is displayed during the spring breed-
ing season and all our specimens are strong flyers, but caymanensis shows
a marked preference for climbing rather than using its wings, unless
necessary. This was borne out in our many observations of this subspecies
on Grand Cayman. Since this is not evident in any of our specimens of
A. 1 . leucocephala or A. I. hesterna we must conclude it to be a natural
trait of caymanensis. J. Lewis Bonhote points out this same characteristic
of two bahamensis which he kept at liberty in his West Indian garden, about
the latter part of the 19th century. Both caymanensis and bahamensis are
larger and heavier in build than the nominate race or hesterna which is
the smallest of the four representatives.
In captivity caymanensis is more prone to obesity than is A. 1 . leucoce-
phala or hesterna , so should, therefore, be supplied with large amounts of
green food daily and sunflower seeds kept at a minimum. This Amazon
parrot lives a more sedentary life than does the Cuban or Cayman Brae
Parrots who often display hyper-activeness and both are overly aggressive
during breeding season, whereas caymanensis , as a rule, is not. Such
aggressiveness on the part of the Cuban and Cayman Brae Amazons is
another good reason to have an aviary that does not require entering during
the nesting period.

RAMON noegel--breeding Amazona leucocephola,
Because of their limited habitat, the Cayman Islands, two subspecies
are the most endangered of the four representatives of leucocephola . This
is especially true of hesterna , for the isle of Cayman Brae is less than
20 km. in length and not more than 4 km. in width. There are no specimens
still to be found on Little Cayman. This makes Cayman Brae undoubtedly
the smallest inhabited area of any Amazon parrot.
Two members of our staff and myself spent a combined time of nine
months on "The Brae" in 1975 and 1976, and were able to do considerable
research on this parrot's habits and population. We estimate there to be
not more than 130 specimens left in the wild. So small is this island that if
one is dedicated enough to face the rough terrain which forms their habitat
atop the "Bluff", one may know precisely where the majority of these
parrots will be at any given time. They generally forage in a group of about
50, up and down the length of the island in search of adequate food, but
there are stragglers to be found almost anywhere.
This concentration begins to separate when the mating season begins
in March. At this time adult pairs may still be seen with their progeny of
the year before. Unlike Grand Cayman with its lush Caribbean vegetation,
"The Brae" receives little rainfall which causes much of the terrain to be
dry and the tree growth rather stunted. Only in certain areas where the
rain falls may one see trees large enough for a parrot nesting hole. Due to
the many holes in the rock bluff one would think hesterna might resort to
these fissures for nesting, as bahamensis has done on Abaco.
We were able to return with six young hesterna. All were apparently
birds one year of age. One pair has this season shown signs of wanting to
nest but since eggs failed to appear they must still be too young. In colora-
tion hesterna more nearly approaches A. 1 . leucocephola than does cay-
manensis. In most specimens, however, the rose or red is confined to the
cheeks and a spot just under the bill on the throat. The white cap is not
as extensive and the green is of a lighter shade. In most cases the vinaceous
extends solidly from the belly well onto the breast and is of a striking shade
of mauve. The feathers on the nape are larger than in the Cuban Amazon,
and heavily edged with black.
Nesting of the latter and caymanensis begins in April and continues into
July. The clutch consists of from two to five eggs. Incubation period is
28 days. We take the chicks from the nest when seven days of age and
hand-raise them. This usually results in the parent pair returning to nest
again. One of our Cayman hens refused to incubate her eggs this season,
so the initial two deposited were placed under a pair of Cuban who hatched
and cared for the young along with their own until we removed them.
This same Cayman hen deposited two more eggs 13 and 15 days after
her first clutch and these too were placed under a foster parent. She again
repeated this performance with one egg which was successfully hatched
and cared for by a pair of A. ventralis along with their young. At the time
of writing, still another egg, representing her fourth clutch this season.

has been laid and is being incubated by the same pair of Cuban that
hatched her first clutch. Her first egg was deposited on April nth, and the
last on June 24th.
We have successfully hand-reared many Amazons, macaws, cockatoos
and Hawk-headed Parrots direct from the egg and the young so raised
have often proved larger and healthier than those fed by their parents. The
following formula is used: the first day the chick is fed a good high protein
cereal made for babies. This is mixed into water so that it is very liquid
and easily drawn into an eye-dropper for feeding. The mixture is then
warmed and fed every two hours for the first 24 hours. A new mixture is
made up each feeding to prevent it becoming sour which will result in
the chick's death if ingested.
After the first day this formula is fed: one part raw peanuts, one of raw
pumpkin seeds, one of raw sunflower seeds, one of raw wheat germ, one
of soya bean powder, one teaspoon of calcium powder and one teaspoon
of wheat germ oil. The seeds and peanuts must all be hulled and carefully
washed in fresh water to free them of any remaining hulls or sheaths. All
is combined in an electric blender with enough water and blended until
the mixture is smooth. It is then refrigerated and used as needed. At each
feeding at least one-third the amount used should consist of well mashed
fully ripe banana or ripened apple which is mashed and strained. This is
added to each feeding to keep the food from remaining in the crop. A
drop of liquid vitamins and minerals should be added daily.
Mixture should be well warmed but not hot and fed every three hours
during the day--8.00 am to 11.00 pm. This gives all night to allow a com-
plete emptying of the crop. We also recommend that fresh faeces from the
parent birds be mixed into the formula at time of feeding about twice a
week to supply the necessary intestinal flora for digestion. Clean human
saliva may also be used regularly to impart digestive enzymes. As the
chick develops the eye-dropper may be replaced by a small spoon which
seems to psychologically take the place of the parent's beak and is greatly
enjoyed by the chick. It is, of course, best if the chick can remain with the
parent birds for the first five days. This period passes the crucial point
and gives the chick a better start. The above method has proved successful
with young that parents have refused to feed.
We find both caymanensis and the Cuban race to be easy to rear and they
are fully feathered in seven weeks and begin eating some food on their
own. Food, such as fresh raw corn cut from the cob, raw sliced apples
and celery are soon accepted. Seeds should be kept present and they are
soon hulled and eaten, but spoon feeding should be kept up until they are
past three months of age. At about six to seven weeks the chicks will begin
to refuse to eat as much. This is done in the wild and causes them to lose
weight in order to be able to fly from the nest. When about two months
old, feeding may be limited to morning and evenings, but must be contin-
ued until young are fully accustomed to eating on their own.

130 R. J. ELGAR--A HYBRID HUMMINGBIRD
Our current programme calls for placing pairs of the offspring of leuco-
cephala with qualified zoos in order to establish other breeding nuclei. Such
a procedure would insure against any unforeseen catastrophe which might
wipe out all our specimens and thereby end a well intended effort. The
New Age Ranch is solely supported and operated by the New Age
Assembly Church which makes this project a labour of love.
We also have four specimens of the Jamaican Black-billed Amazon
A. agilis and five of the Jamaican Yellow-billed Amazon A. collaria from
which we hope to start a captive breeding nucleus. Also bred here is the
Hispaniolan Amazon A. ventralis . Both ventralis and collaria are close
relatives of the leucocephala group. All of the island species and subspecies
may well remain only a few more decades in the wild. Captive breeding
only can forestall the eventuality of extinction.
THE BREEDING OF A HYBRID HUMMINGBIRD
BROWN VIOLETEAR x SPARKLING VIOLETEAR
By R. J. Elgar (Manchester)
Although the breeding of hummingbirds in captivity is rare, several
people have had young hatch and live for several weeks. With the exception
of the rearing of one Sparkling or Green Violetear Colibri coruscans by
Mrs Scamell (1966, 1967) and, in The Wildfowl Trust's tropical house at
Slimbridge a few years ago, the breeding of a Sparkling x Brown Violetear
which lived for one year, there has been little success in this country.
On the continent in recent years there have been several notable suc-
cesses, W. Scheithauer rearing one Amazilia a. dumerli x Thalurania
furcata and Archilochus alexandri and, also in Germany this year, one
Brown Violetear Colibri delphinae and two C. coruscans x C. delphinae.
Several C. coruscans were bred in France during 1975.
Although my breeding is a hybrid, I think it of interest. As shown by
Schauensee (1970) and Davis (1972) the ranges of the two parent species
appear to overlap, C. delphinae inhabiting a large area from Guatemala
south to Bolivia and across to the Guianas and Trinidad, while C. coruscans
ranges from Mexico to western Panama, Venezuela and southward.
The Brown Violetear is a large hummingbird 5 in. in length, the overall
colour being light brown; upperparts olive-brown, the feathers of the
lower back dark brown fringed rufous. A broad band from below eye
continuing back over ear-coverts glittering violet-blue; moustachial
streak whitish; patch on throat glittering golden-green turning to violet
on lower throat; under tail-coverts rufescent. Rest of underparts are pale
grey with dark brown downward streaks on chest. Tail is pale olive-bronze
with a broad subterminal purple-bronze band. The male Brown Violetear

was imported from Ecuador in April 1974. Although a commonly imported
hummingbird this particular specimen was outstanding.
The Sparkling Violetear is medium sized, being about 4 in. in length.
The body plumage is green, shining above, more glittering on the throat
and breast. Patch below eye prolonged over ear-coverts is glittering violet-
blue. Tail green with subterminal blue-black band.
I obtained the female in September 1973. Both birds are housed in a
communal flight measuring 14 ft x 4 ft. 6 in with nine other medium and
large hummingbirds. In March 1977 I noticed the female Green Violetear
attempting to build a nest in a Philodendron scandens growing over a large
gnarled root which I have suspended from the ceiling of my bird room.
After several days the construction did not seem to be getting anywhere,
so I decided to make a nest, using wire covered with sphagnum moss and
lined with cotton wool and I placed this in the plant where the female
was building. As the nest-building of the female was going on, I noticed
the Brown Violetear displaying to her.
Display--male
Male perched with wings open, vibrating them; no song, just an adver-
tising call; he will call for several minutes at a time but only vibrates the
wings for several seconds. He will then fly to the female, hovering in front
and slightly below, swinging from side to side with bill pressed into
female's lower breast or vent area, his ear patches extended and singing
continually. This lasts only a few seconds; then he will quickly fly round
the back of her with bill pressed to her nape. The mating takes place and
after mating, he will fly off* very fast, covering the whole length of the
flight several times, making his advertising call as he does so.
Display---female
On occasions when the male is making this advertising call, the female
will fly to him pushing her bill into his breast or vent feathers and hovering
from side to side like the male. Again this lasts only a few seconds. Then
she will perch next to him; this will usually arouse him to display and
mate, or on some occasions he will ignore her.
Egg-laying and incubation
From my note book:
"March 26th, morning, female adding cobweb to rim of nest.
27th, evening, one egg in nest which the female has covered with nesting
material. The following days the female showed no interest in the nest
but I witnessed mating on several occasions.
April 2nd, morning, one egg in nest.
3rd, morning, the female was sitting on the nest; when she left to feed
I examined the nest, there were now two eggs. Incubation commenced
on the 3rd April. The female leaves the nest every thirty to forty minutes

during daylight to feed, flying strained in an upright position for several
feet then quickly flying the full length of the flight several times before
feeding, then she stretches and preens. I never witnessed her bathing dur-
ing incubation, but as I was at work most of the day she probably bathed
in my absence. Before returning to the nest she would take more nectar
and a very small amount of nest material, usually cobweb, to add to the
nest. The whole time only absent from nest for several minutes."
A very interesting occurrence which K. L. Schuchmann mentioned to
me concerning the nesting of his Trochilus polytmus is that hummingbirds
turn their eggs with their feet and not the bill as stated by some orni-
thologists. It is difficult to imagine the Sword-billed Hummingbird
Ensifera ensifera turning its eggs with its bill. The female Green Violetear
and also my female White-necked Jacobin Florisuga mellivora turn the
eggs by using their feet. It is done by the female pushing its chin into the
rim of the nest and chest pushed against the inner wall, lifting back and
tail and turning the eggs with the feet.
Hatching and development of chicks
The first egg hatched on the morning of April 18th, fifteen days
from the start of incubation. The second hatched on the afternoon of the
following day. The chicks were the size of a "blow-fly" and blackish in
colour with a line of fawn-coloured down on the head and middle of the
back. For the first day the chicks did not gape when the female landed on
the nest. She would lightly tap the edge of the bill; then the chick would
open its mouth and very carefully she would push the tip of her bill down
the throat and feed the chick. At this stage the chicks were fed almost
entirely on regurgitated fruit flies. I had been wondering how the nest
had been kept free from droppings; at first I thought the female was remov-
ing them but on the third day I noticed one of the chicks edging up the
wall of the nest (similar to a Cuckoo when disposing of unwanted eggs).
When the vent was level with the rim of the nest it released its droppings
over the rim. They kept this process up until they were sleeping on the
rim of the nest.
From my note book:
"April 23rd. Fin feathers are now showing on both chicks: both birds
seem very healthy and are growing at a fast rate.
25th. The older of the chicks is developing much quicker; its eyes
are now open. Both seem very fit.
26th. Feathers are now opening on both chicks. The primaries are half
open on large chick. Female does not brood chicks overnight but sleeps
in her usual place in an ivy about 6 ft from the nest.
27th. Small chick's eyes fully opened; female starts to call chicks when
in the vicinity of the nest. Chicks start to gape in answer to her call before
she lands on the nest.

May 1 st. Sunday. Managed to get into the birdroom before daybreak,
young birds in semi-torpor. They make whining sounds similar to
Popelairia sp. The female starts catching fruit flies as soon as light is put
on. Young birds are awake and gaping in twenty minutes. Female feeds
ten minutes later; she feeds young every thirty to forty minutes throughout
the day, taking as many as seventy fruit flies for each feed. At approxi-
mately 9.00 pm she goes to roost and leaves chicks till the following morn-
ing.
3rd. Small chick is not getting enough food and seems very weak.
4th, morning. Small chick trapped underneath large one, possibly all
night. It is also torpid. I revived it by hand and returned it to the nest.
For the rest of the morning it would not gape for the female; by midday
it was taking food again, I am very worried about it. This chick is now
only half the size of the larger one; it also has a slightly deformed bill and
feet.
6th. Large chick sat on rim of nest all afternoon exercising wings, re-
turning to the nest in the evening to sleep. Small chick slightly improved
and seems to be getting more food.
9th. Large chick sleeps on rim of nest; both are now fully feathered.
10th. Large chick seen catching fruit flies whilst sat on edge of nest.
14th, evening. Large chick flies round the bird room just as I am dim-
ming the lights.
15th. Large chick flies round in the afternoon; when it perches, male
Brown Violetear displays and tries to mate it. The young bird shows its
feeding posture to the male.
16th. Large chick spends most of the day off the nest. Several of the
male hummingbirds attack it but the chick shows a defensive posture
(ear-patches extended and tail fanned out) to any hummingbird that
approaches it other than the female. That night the chick roosts in plant,
not in nest.
18th. Large chick hawking fruit flies; small chick still in nest but exer-
cising its wings.
22nd. Large chick taking plenty of flies, but shows no interest in nectar;
also seen bathing in shallow saucer. Small chick coming on well but still
in nest. Female still feeding both chicks.
23rd. Large chick seen taking nectar; female chasing it when begging
for food.
25th. Large chick bathing and feeding itself, but female feeds it occasion-
ally. Small chick exercising wings and looks ready to fly.
29th. Female attacking large chick; I have put chick in flight cage. It
settled down within a few hours and seems very content and feeding well.
Over the last few days the female has been building a nest in a Maranta.

R. J. ELGAR--A HYBRID HUMMINGBIRD
The small chick flies for the first time on May 30th. Unfortunately
with its deformed feet it cannot perch and falls to the floor. I return it
to the nest.
June 2nd. Small chick is torpid in nest; I revive it and feed it. In the
afternoon I found the small chick dead on the floor of the bird room. It
was 44 days old. The large chick has now made a very attractive bird and
I think it is a male. It is almost the same size as the father; upperparts
shining bronze-green, lower back dark brown, feathers edged rufous.
Underparts, throat and upper chest shining bronze-green, rest of under-
parts grey. Large violet ear-patches, large patch on throat metallic green
to violet-red on lower throat. Tail green with dark blue band edged with
light brown".
During the breeding of this bird, all the other hummingbirds were left
in the flight and apart from a female White-necked Jacobin, which
occasionally stole material from the nest, the others showed no interest
until the chick left the nest.

Introduction
The Virginia Rail Rallus limicola and the Sora Porzana Carolina are
medium sized, long-legged, long-toed members of the rail family. Their
most striking difference is the shape of their bills; the bill of the Virginia
Rail is long and slightly decurved while the bill of the Sora is short and
somewhat conical. Both species are common but shy birds inhabitating
dense marsh vegetation, and are more frequently heard than seen. Their
breeding ranges overlap and include the southern half of Canada and
northern half of the United States.
I began studying rails with field observations made from blinds con-
structed near nests. My studies included both species because they often
occurred in the same marshes and they occasionally exhibited inter-
specific territoriality. In order to facilitate my study I decided to raise a
captive flock of rails.

Procedure
</subsubsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.997666291666667" page_id="56386481"  page_num="135" year="" vol="">
Rails were obtained from the wild by taking pipping eggs, and by trapping
incubating and foraging birds. Incubating rails were caught on the nest
with a cylindrical trap of f inch (20 mm.) square steel mesh, 15 cm.
in diameter and 60 cm. long. The ends were closed with old nylon
stockings, and a weighted door mounted on two steel rods was released
automatically by the bird as it returned to incubate. When the rail
touched one of two bottom strings, it set off a mousetrap placed on the
side of the cylinder. The snap of the mousetrap pulled the string attached
to the pin holding up the door: a rubber band then pulled the door down.
"Drift traps" similar to those described by Pospichal and Marshall (1954)
were used to catch foraging rails. These traps consisted of a cage 90 x
115 cm. and 90 cm. high made of J or f inch square steel mesh. Leads of
1 inch chicken wire, 10 to 15 m. long and 90 cm. high, extended in a "V"
from the single funnel entrance. The rails entered the trap after walking
along the leads while feeding.
Soras and Virginia Rails were hand-raised from pipping eggs taken
from the field. They were placed in a cardboard box which contained a
desk lamp for heat and a saucer for drinking and defecating. Chicks were
fed high protein dogfood soaked in liquid multiple vitamins from tweezers
about every four hours.
The juvenile and adult rails captured in the traps were placed in an
outdoor cage and offered wild bird seed, primarily millet, in one pan and
a mixture of aquatic invertebrates and dogfood in another pan.
The rails were then wintered in the aviary of the James Ford Bell

Museum of Natural History in Minneapolis. The aviary is an enclosed,
heated space between the older and newer portions of the museum. It is
enclosed with glass on the north and south sides from ground level to the
second floor roof. The rails were placed in a large cage containing corn
stalks for cover and the cement floor was covered with a layer of sawdust.
A continuous flow of water went from the watering pan to a nearby drain.
This partially alleviated the problem of fouling the water caused by the
attempts of the Virginia Rails to wash their dogfood prior to eating it.
In subsequent years the rails were wintered in part of a barn. The
floor of the barn was flooded with 10 cm. of water, creating a pool approxi-
mately 6x9m. and troughs containing cattails ( Typha ) were placed in it.
The barn was heated to approximately io*C. Artificial lights were used to
supplement the sunlight which entered two small windows.
In late fall and the early spring the rails attempted to leave the wintering
pens by flying at night. They flew into the wire cage and ceiling and lost
feathers on the tops of their heads. A very dim light was left on at night
and the rails ceased to injure themselves.
In the spring the rails were sexed by laparotomy and were marked with
coloured plastic discs attached by monofilament line through the nares
and with both coloured plastic and numbered metal leg bands. The rails
were then placed in an outdoor pen on the Cedar Creek Natural History
Area near Bethel, Minnesota.
The outdoor pen was specially designed to simulate marsh conditions.
The pen, which measured 18x5 m., contained a pond about 10 cm. deep.
Cattails were placed in wooden troughs radiating from the blind so that
the rails could be seen as they moved between the rows. Clumps of cattail
stalks and duckweed provided a floating mat between these rows. The
main blind had two stories, with a window 30 cm. above water level and
another window, of one-way glass, at a height of 2 m. above the water. An
enclosed walkway was built around the outside of the pen with an observa-
tion window every 1*25 m. so that I could look for nests and hiding rails
without entering the pen.
A wooden feeder was floated on each side of the pen. The food con-
sisted of canned dogfood, game bird chow, wild bird seed and, when
the young hatched, quantities of mealworms or maggots were included.
Aquatic invertebrates were caught in adjacent marshes and scattered in
the pen.

In 1967, seven Soras and ten Virginia Rails were placed in the breeding
pen on April 17th. Nine rails which did not appear likely to breed were
removed during the following weeks: thus pairs were allowed to form
naturally. In 1968, the procedure was different. Two males and two
females of both species which appeared most likely to breed were placed
in the pen on April 29th. Five of the eight birds were replaced with others

and Sora pair 4 was added. In 1969., the pen was divided into two portions
by a partition of 1 inch chicken wire. Six Soras were placed in the breeding
pen on May 22nd.
The breeding success varied considerably from year to year (see Table
1). In 1967, five pair bonds were formed and three pairs copulated fre-
quently and raised young. In 19683 five pair bonds were formed but only
two pairs copulated frequently and one pair raised young. In 19693 the
rails were introduced late and observations were infrequent. Only one pair
raised young.

I believe the important factors which governed the success of breeding
captive rails were: (1) the size of the breeding pen; (2) the aquatic condi-
tions of the breeding pen; (3) the adequacy of artificial foods; and (4)
stress during winter.
Size of the pen
The size of the breeding pen was approximately 90 square metres, less
than the size of the territory of a single pair of wild rails. The highest
nesting density recorded was four Sora and five Virginia Rail nests in a
0*5 acre kettlehole (Berger, 1951). This would have been approximately
224 square metres per pair. The territorial defence exhibited by the captive
rails was not exhibited equally to conspecifics and inter specifics. Soras
chased all rails from their territories, while Virginia Rails chased con-
specifics but frequently tolerated Soras. Both species reacted to the

Descending calls of the other, and I believe this was responsible for the
even dispersion of nests in the wild.
In 1967 the first territorial behaviour was exhibited by a large, aggressive
male Sora. He defended the centre of the pen, chasing all other rails. He
continued to chase females as well as males and appeared to inhibit all
other rail activity, and so I removed him. Several other male Soras made
weak attempts to defend a territory but pair formation appeared to be
necessary to maintain one. On May 17th a pair of Virginia Rails began to
defend half of the pen and soon another pair of Virginia Rails defended the
other half On May 24th the second male soundly defeated the first male
and defended the entire pen against Virginia Rails. He appeared to inhibit
Sora territorial activity. On June 13th the pair of Virginia Rails began to
nest in the north-east corner of the pen and their chasing activities dimin-
ished. Subsequently two pairs of Soras began to defend territories and
divided the west two-thirds of the pen between them. Both pairs began
egg-laying on July 5th and incubation July 8th and 9th.
In 1968 one pair of Virginia Rails defended a territory for a short time.
On June nth one of the previously successful pairs of Soras began to
defend a territory and enlarged it to include the west two-thirds of the
pen. On June 29th this pair began egg-laying. Two other pairs of Soras
divided the remaining third of the pen but this was apparently too small
for inducement of nesting.
In 1969 the rails were not introduced into the pen until May 22nd.
Pairs of Soras defended a territory, one on each side of the partition of
the pen but only one of them nested.
In summary then, the pen was of sufficient size for a maximum of two
pairs of rails. Three pairs were successful in 1967 because: (1) favourable
aquatic conditions stimulated early nesting, providing time for sequential
nesting in the season; (2) the first pair to nest were Virginia Rails, which
frequently tolerated Soras in their territory; and ( 3 ) the reproductive
cycles of the two pairs of Soras were synchronized to the day. If the cycle
of one Sora pair had preceded that of the other pair, the second pair might
have been inhibited from reproduction.
Aquatic conditions
The aquatic conditions of the pen differed in water stability and inverte-
brate populations between 1967 and the subsequent years. The water
level remained constant in 1967 when rains adequately replenished losses
caused by evaporation and small leaks. The shallow water warmed quickly
and subsequently supported a large population of water fleas (. Daphnia )
which the rails ate. Nearly every day I placed fairy shrimp ( Branchopoda ),
tadpoles and other aquatic invertebrates in the pen. That winter the cold
temperatures cracked the cement and the pool leaked in spite of attempts
to seal it. Thus water had to be added every two or three days in 1968 and
1969. The continuous addition of cold well water inhibited the growth of

invertebrates and tended to wash them out through the leaks. In 1968 I
placed more effort in field observations so that aquatic invertebrates were
not added until my brother arrived to help me in late May. A week later
a pair of Soras began defending territory. Invertebrates were not added in
1969.
Field observations indicated that stable water levels and high inverte-
brate populations are important in attracting rails. I rarely found rail
nests in high kettleholes which dried out early in the season. Their water
levels fluctuated more with rainfall than the marshes, which were at the
level of the ground water table. Presumably then the rails were averse to
nesting in marshes with even small fluctuations in water level. I found the
greatest nesting densities of rails in marshes undergoing landfill by village
dumps. These marshes were well fertilised by the dumps and were the
first to be covered with duckweeds ( Lemnaceae ) and contained many
aquatic invertebrates. Presumably the duckweeds and invertebrates
attracted nesting rails and in the pen induced the captive rails to nest.
Adequacy of the diet
The diet of the Soras appeared to be easier to duplicate than that of the
Virginia Rails. The Soras readily took the millet seeds offered them as
well as the invertebrates placed in the pen. The Virginia Rails had to be
taught to eat canned dogfood. The dogfood probably lacked some of their
nutritional requirements, and I feel this was largely responsible for the
decreasing success of the Virginia Rails from 1967 to 1969.
Stress of the winter
The barn appeared to place more stress on the wintering rails than did
the aviary. The aviary lacked a pool of water and whenever the Ringed
Doves in the pen flew, they frightened the rails; in addition there was
frequent human presence. However, this appeared to be outweighed by
the warm, dry air and abundant sunlight. The barn was larger than the
aviary cage and was more marsh-like in appearance. There were no other
birds with them and human disturbance was rare. However, the barn was
colder, had little sunlight and was very damp.
Losses in captivity
A discussion of the rails lost during capture and captivity will hopefully
save birds during future work, particularly in reference to some of the
unique characteristics of the Rallidae.
Several rails died in my drift traps. I usually attended the traps every
late morning and late evening. Occasionally my old automobile failed to
run and it was 24 hours between checking the traps and this was when rails
were found dead. I believe the rails died of starvation rather than lack of
water or heat stress, as rails lack a crop and the traps were placed in shade
and in water.

Several wild adult Virginia Rails died when I discontinued mixing live
invertebrates into their canned dogfood too quickly. It appeared to take
about a week before they learned to eat dogfood alone. The Soras readily
ate the seeds offered them.
I made several unsuccessful attempts to raise chicks before finding the
difficulty. All of the dead chicks appeared to be impacted with faeces.
Then on one attempt I placed their water in a saucer and found that the
chicks defecated in the water. Then I recalled how the wild chicks would
scamper down the nest ramp, bob their posterior in the water, and run
back to the nest. Defecating in the water must be a nest sanitation device
in the rails. Without the stimulus of water in which to defecate, the chicks
apparently died of impaction. Leigh Fredrickson (personal communica-
tion) made the same discovery in his attempts to keep chicks of the
Common Gallinule Gallinula chloropus and Common Coot Fulica
americana.
The captive rails did not build a complete ramp from the water to their
nests as did wild birds because of the structure of the troughs containing
the cattails. Thus, when a chick fell into the water, it was often unable to
return to the nest. The short-billed Soras never appeared to be disturbed
at the plaintive peeping of their young and merely watched them drown.
The long-billed Virginia Rails were observed rescuing their young and then
brooding them on such occasions, both in the pen and in the wild.
Several hand-raised young died when I placed them outside at night.
These young were three weeks old and nearly fully feathered. This stress
must have been responsible for their deaths since the parents continue
to brood young long after they cease feeding them.
The rails underwent surgical laparotomy to identify sex. In 1967 no
anaesthetic was used and no birds were lost. In 1968 ether was used as an
anaesthetic and two birds died at dosage levels far less than that necessary
to anaesthetize most of the rails.
The summer pens were located outdoors and the greatest number of
birds were lost to predators. The Brown Rat was the greatest problem,
followed by weasels and snakes. The hard floors of cement and wire
frequently caused infections in the feet of these birds adapted to the soft
muddy marshes. Isolating the birds and frequent applications of a com-
mercial remedy for athlete's foot consisting of a salve containing carbolic
acid cured most infections.

My recommendations for breeding these rails in captivity are as follows.
Winter the rails in a dry, warm, well lighted area. Place them in a simulated
marsh during their normal time of spring arrival with a minimum area of
5x9m. per pair. The water level of the pool must be stable. Profuse
numbers of aquatic invertebrates and duckweeds should be present in the
pool. The pen must be predator proof and if located outside, deterrents

as electric fence, rat poison, and box traps should be used. When the young
hatch, make certain the nest ramps of Soras are sloping inclines to the

Platycercus caledonicus
By Peter Brown (Harewood, Leeds)
The island of Tasmania, off south-eastern Australia, is home to several
species of parrot-like birds, but only one, the Green Rosella, is found in
Tasmania and nowhere on the neighbouring mainland.
During late November and the whole of December, 1976, I had ample
opportunity to study this most handsome and confiding parrakeet during
a six week stay in Tasmania. Whilst I was anxious to see as many of the
birds of the island as possible, I spent more time and obtained more
pleasure from observing this species than any other I can think of.
The Green Rosella, sometimes also known as the Tasmanian Rosella
or the Yellow-bellied Rosella, is similar in size to the other larger rosellas
like the Crimson and Yellow; however, in my field observations, it appears
somewhat less sleek and a little more rotund and bulky. The sexes are
identical in coloration but invariably the female is more slight in build,
particularly across the head and upper mandible. The head, sides of neck
and entire underparts are of a rich yellow, tinged with green. There is a
bright red band across the forehead which gradually fades under the eye.
The chin and cheek-patches are bright blue: the nape fades from yellow
into dark olive-green on the back and wings, right through to the tip of
the tail. There is some blue in the flight and outer tail feathers and the
bend of the wing carries a bright sky-blue patch. The bill is greyish-horn
coloured and the legs and feet dark grey; the iris is brown.
Voice
The Green Rosellas are quite noisy birds and often gave away their
presence to me by their high pitched musical calls long before I was able ;
to see them. The normal contact calls are quite soft and do not carry far,
in contrast to the alarm call which is high and rings through the forests.

This rosella was invariably seen in pairs in November and December
and of all the Tasmanian parrot-like birds it was the only one which was
usually seen as a pair rather than a group. I was a little surprised at this,
for my stay coincided with the breeding season and I expected to come
across odd birds whilst mates were incubating, but, other than on one
occasion seeing a single bird, I only saw pairs together. They were most
active in the early morning and early evening when they would move,
chattering softly all the while, through the trees. During the middle of the
day they would sit quite motionless in the middle storey of the trees.
The flight is swift as with most parrakeets but my notes state it as being
much less swift and strong than the Eastern Rosella Platycercus eximus.

However, it was unsurpassed in manoeuvreability as it skimmed in and
out of the trees. The flight was of deep undulations when over open areas.
Field identification
This is a long-tailed, swift flying bird which can only resemble the
Eastern Rosella in shape. The colours are quite distinct, so no confusion
should occur.
Relationship with the Eastern Rosella
Perhaps the easiest way to start to cover this is to say where the ranges
do not overlap. In the wet sclerophyl rain forest areas of the south-west,
the Green Rosella was plentiful and the Eastern absent and I saw several
Green Rosellas about the Sheffield area in the north, but saw no Eastern
Rosellas here: this is arable and dairy farming country. Other than these
two areas where the two species are not found together, one was likely to
come across either species anywhere. It would appear to me that by prefer-
ence, the ideal habitat of the Eastern Rosella is in the open, dry woodland,
scrubland and sheep farming country, whereas the Green Rosella is
happier in thicker woodland; however, I saw Green Rosellas around houses
and buildings, feeding in the hedgerows of back gardens and occasionally
in very open farming country. Whilst I often saw the two species a few
hundred yards apart, I never saw them actually closer than that. Forshaw
(1969) states that the Eastern and Green Rosellas join up into flocks in
the non-breeding season and visit barns, haystacks and stockyards to feed
on grain.

Habitat
This is a bird of woodland. It seems to cope equally well with dense,
wet rain forest as with dry, open woodland. In my experience it was usually
encountered in the middle storey, moving around amongst the more open
branches. I saw it in open country on many occasions where it had been
feeding amongst shrubs and the like. At Port Arthur it is well known to
frequent the ruined convict settlement in spite of the numerous visitors in
the area. Sharland (1958) gives it as being common in the fruit growing
areas of the Huon Valley in the south-west.
Distribution and status
The Green Rosella has the widest distribution of all parrot-like birds in
Tasmania and is found throughout the island as a resident breeding bird.
It also occurs on King Island and Flinders Islands. It is not subject to any
movement but is well known to congregate in groups to forage for food
during the winter months, visiting farms in flocks. There was recorded a
large influx of thousands into southern Tasmania at the end of the last
century: presumably these came from the forests into open country.
The Green Rosella is a flourishing parrakeet, relatively common
throughout the island. It enjoys a protected status and is at present in no
danger. It is easily the most numerous parrot-like bird in Tasmania. One
wonders for the future, if the enormous population explosion of Starlings
in Tasmania could have any repercussions in demand for nest sites. I
would, however, think the Eastern Rosella would be the first to suffer in
this respect.

I have seen this parrakeet feeding in several entirely different situations.
Firstly in a eucalyptus tree at Mt. Field National Park a pair were moving
around in the midst of the tree, taking off" leaves and eating the stalk and
chewing up flowers which were past the flowering stage. They did this for
perhaps 30 minutes before descending and landing on the ground. They
moved along the side of the road, presumably picking up bits of food left
by people and then they went into the grass and started eating seeding
heads. On another occasion I saw a pair in low bushes eating the flowers
and buds of hawthorn. Forshaw (1966) says that in winter they congregate
in flocks on hawthorn hedges in some areas to eat berries. They will also
take some insects but almost certainly their principal diet is seeds, nuts,
fruit, berries of eucalyptus and other trees and shrubs.
Breeding
The breeding season is between the months of November and February.

I saw only one nest site, it was in dry eucalyptus forest with a canopy of
about 70 ft. The nesting tree was an old, long-dead eucalyptus which had
been scarred by bush fires in the past. It stood no more than 40 ft tall,
with the well chewed nest entrance about 25 ft up. The hole was in the
vertical tree trunk and entrance approximately 5 inches in diameter. I
cannot claim to have found it, but was shown the nest; it had been occu-
pied in the previous year and three young had fledged in February.

The remains of Green Rosellas have been found in the nests of Peregrine
Falcons and the Brown Goshawk has been observed eating a rosella. I
once rescued a Green Rosella from a concerted attack by Noisy Miners
Manorina melanocephala which had it pinned to the ground and would, I
am sure, have killed it had I not interrupted them. I also found two large
bunches of feathers by the roadside from birds which had almost certainly
been killed by vehicles, at which I am not surprised, for several times
whilst driving along, Green Rosellas would swoop low across the road,
narrowly avoiding the car.
In the aviary
The Green Rosella is, in Europe at the present time, the most desirable
of the genus. It has always been a scarce bird and there have never been
more than a handful of pairs in Britain. This is, I feel, due to two reasons:
firstly when Australian birds were readily imported, being one of the less
gaudily coloured of the Australian parrakeets it was neglected in favour
of the bright and more easily obtained species: secondly, coming from the
island of Tasmania, it was more difficult to obtain due to the relative
difficulty of getting birds from the island. Once the ban on importation of
birds from Australia was imposed, the captive stock was minute and as
scarcity became the yardstick for value, the Tasmanian Rosella was soon
a very valuable and desirable aviary bird.
It is most unfortunate that over the years there has in Europe been some
hybridisation between this species and the Adelaide and Yellow Rosella,
hence a certain amount of the captive stock carries impure blood.
At the present time I very much doubt that there are more than a dozen
pairs in Britain and almost certainly many more than that number on the
continent. It would seem over recent years that the continental stock has
been more successful than the British regarding breeding, but I am aware
of a few potentially good breeding pairs in this country which will hope-
fully improve the situation in years to come. I visited the aviaries of several
parrakeet breeders on the mainland of Australia but saw none in any of
these collections, which would probably indicate the captive stock is as
small in Australia as it is over here.

Continued from p. 97
True tool-users in the wild
The best known and best studied example of an avian tool-user is the
Galapagos Woodpecker Finch Cactospiza ( Camarhynchus ) pallida whose
use of a cactus spine or twig was observed at least as early as 1901 by
Rollo Beck (Bowman 1961) and was first reported by Gilford (1919).
Subsequent students of this bird include Lack (1945,1947), Eibl-Eibesfeldt
(1961, 1964a,1964b, 1967), Eibl-Eibesfeldt and Sielmann (1962), Bowman
(1961), Hundley (1963), and Millikan and Bowman (1967). The bird was
filmed in captivity in West Germany by Sielmann (1964); and filmed
under controlled conditions in the Galapagos by Joan and Alan Root
(see both Anon 1967 and Peterson 1967 for the Roots' excellent still
photographs).
I can deal here only with a few of the more important aspects of the
tool-using behaviour.
From the English summary to Eibl-Eibesfeldt's 1961 paper, and from
his brief, popular 1964 accounts, it is clear that when looking for prey,
this species first searches like a true woodpecker, using its bill to prise off
bark, thus uncovering insect holes. It will then pick up accessible prey
directly with the bill. If no prey is accessible the bird then flies off to fetch
a cactus spine which it may use in one of three different ways: as a goad
to drive out an active insect (without necessarily touching it); as a spear
with which to impale a slow-moving larva or similar creature; or as an
implement (best named a poker?) with which to push, bring towards,
nudge or otherwise manoeuvre an inactive insect from a crevice or hole.
In addition, one of Eibl-Eibesfeldt's captive birds was seen occasionally
to prise up pieces of bark--presumably using its tool as a "lever" in the
full mechanical sense of the word (fulcrum, weight and power). When no
longer hungry the bird would play "hide and seek" with a mealworm and
its probe. Eibl-Eibesfeldt concluded from the behaviour of a young bird
that an interest in manipulating sticks and probing with them was probably
an innate basis for the behaviour, the bird refining its technique by play-
learning. He also wrote "Tools that are not exactly fitting the purpose are
worked over by the bird and thus adapted"; and Lawick-Goodall (1970)
cited Bowman (1961) to the effect that one bird of this species "tried
(unsuccessfully) to break off the end of an excessively long probe, and
another having twice tried to insert the forked end of a twig into a cranny,
broke it off at the fork and was thus able to use the implement success-
fully". Lawick-Goodall (1970) concluded from this observation that "The
bird may, therefore, be said to show the beginnings of object modification".

Later in her review of tool-using the term "object modification" appears to
be used synonymously with "tool-making", and it seems clear that the
way a Chimpanzee Pan satyrus modifies twigs is not significantly different
from the way the Galapagos Woodpecker Finch does, though the frequency
with which the behaviour has been observed in the wild bird is very much
less than in the mammal.
Captive Galapagos Woodpecker Finches studied by Millikan and
Bowman (1967) broke twigs from branches, and in a few instances a
bird was seen to snap a twig into two pieces after picking it up, and to
retain the shorter piece as a more manageable tool than the larger piece.
Lawick-Gocdall (1970) regarded even "the seemingly simple act of
breaking a branch from a tree as an initial step in the modification of an
object for use as a tool", provided the breaking off was done with direct
reference to the problem in hand. This is clearly what the Galapagos
Woodpecker Finch is doing and, taken with the fact that both wild and
captive birds have been seen to modify the shape of the twig, the conclusion
that this species is not only a tool-user but also a tool-maker seems in-
escapable.
To return now to the way the bird actually uses its tool. Millikan and
Bowman (1967) did not compare their observations with those of Eibl-
Eibesfeldt. They reported no instance of a captive bird using a tool as a
spear (or harpoon); nor did they observe its use as a goad--probably
because active prey animals were not supplied. They did, however, specu-
late that "under natural conditions where the contents, if any, of many
cracks under the bark of trees may not always be visible, the finches use
tools to search for food. "Even so", the authors go on, "none of our
observations on captive or wild birds suggest that pallida definitely hunts
with a tool; or in other words, even picks up a stick before finding a
foraging site where a stick might be useful". Presumably the only precise
way in which a bird can use a tool to "search for" food items that it cannot
sense-experience, is by "flushing" the prey with a goad, or by exposing
the prey when levering off some covering material. It is not impossible
that the tool could transmit a tactile impression of an out-of-sight inverte-
brate, i.e. by conveying the softness of a larva's body. Thus, the bird could
then be said to "search for" prey in that manner. There is, however, no
evidence of this and it is unlikely in any case to be important.
To describe the direct action on the prey that I have called "poking"
or "prodding", Millikan and Bowman (1967) used the verbs "lever",
"pull" and "slide". If by "levered" they merely meant a movement of the
tool directly and exclusively against the object, then strictly speaking this
is not leverage since there is no fulcrum. If, however, they meant that the
far end of the tool is pressed firmly on a point (thus providing a fulcrum)
and that by then pivoting the stick about that point the object is moved
by the tool, then true leverage is involved (as it must be when the bird
prises off bits of bark). It is not difficult to imagine prey animals in some

situations from which they could not be "poked" but could only be
"levered" or "prised". The situation shown in the upper photograph of
their figure 6 would appear to be one such instance.
We thus arrive at the conclusion that with a twig in its bill a bird has a
number of options. Those taken up by the Galapagos Woodpecker Finch
include waving the tool as a goad, thrusting it as a spear, manipulating it
as a poker and prising with it as a lever. To these Millikan and Bowman
(1967) added brandishing a twig as a weapon! They said "One of the most
remarkable, and least frequent, behaviours was the use of a tool as a weapon.
In one instance, a bird with a probe in its mouth moved toward another
bird and drove it from the feeding tray". This incident is illustrated by
frames from a 16 mm film. Bird A, using a tool to remove an insect larva,
is observed passively by bird B, when bird A swings its head round to
bird B and thrusts its tool (lance ?) at bird B's breast feathers. A larger,
still photograph taken at a different time and depicting a bird holding a
fascicle of pine needles is captioned "warding off another finch approaching
the food table". Thus the bird not only wields the tool in five different
ways, but to satisfy two functions: foraging and aggression.
These two authors make three other points worth quoting briefly. First,
that tool-using often functions as a displacement activity; secondly, that
one of the five birds that never used a tool may have failed to do so because
of its isolated upbringing; and thirdly that tool-using is believed to have
evolved in the Galapagos in response to an ecological factor: the dryness
of the climate that causes lepidoptera and coleoptera to hide behind bark
or burrow into woody tissues during daylight when the Galapagos Wood-
pecker Finch is hunting.
A different Galapagos finch has more recently been seen using a tool.
In 1964, Curio and Kramer reported that one wild individual, out of six
watched, of the little-studied Galapagos Mangrove Finch Cactospiza
heliobates was seen to exhibit similar tool-using behaviour to that of the
Woodpecker Finch. And Millikan and Bowman (1967) reported that
another of "Darwin's Finches", a captive individual of the species
Geospiza conirostris learnt to manipulate a twig, but never succeeded in
actually using it as a tool. Hundley (1963) saw in the wild a fourth Galapa-
gos finch, the Warbler Finch, Certhidea olivacea holding a 3 inch leaf-stalk
with which it probed three times into a crack, and was told third-hand
that a black species of Galapagos Ground Finch Geospiza fuliginosa , or
possibly G. fortis make use of a twig as a tool.
The report of a Victorian naturalist that an Australian species of bee-
eater Merops ornatus , when making its nest-burrow, carried a small stick
in its bill and used it as a mining tool, Chisholm (1954) thought might
have been based on faulty observation.
There are three records of Australian birds using small sticks to assist
in procuring food. An Eastern Shrike-Tit Falcunculus frontatus was seen
by Richards (1971) systematically examining a dead black wattle tree. The

bird broke off the end of a twig with its bill, held the 2 J-inch probe sideways
and then inserted it twice into a crevice. The twig was then dropped and
the bird extracted a food item. A rather similar account of a Grey Shrike-
Thrush Colluricincla harmonica by Mitchell (1972) stated that the bird
"probed the twig into the hole of a house brick that was amongst a pile
of bricks resting in my garden . . . After two or three probes ... an insect
crawled out of the hole and the thrush dropped the twig, picked up the
insect and flew off". On one day in November 1971 Green (1972) and a
colleague saw at least three (and probably more) Orange-winged Sittellas
Neositta chrysoptera using little strips of wood as probes. How a twig was
obtained was not known, but each bird wielded it with the bill and placed
it under the foot while picking up the grub that had apparently been
dislodged. Although the sittellas carried the twigs in their beaks along a
branch while they were hopping, they always dropped them before
flying.
A New Caledonian Crow Corvus moneduloides probing into the end of a hollow
branch. The head was moved up and down in this action. Reproduced from
Orenstein (1972)
Orenstein (1972) reports an isolated observation of possible tool-use by
a New Caledonian Crow Corvus moneduloides. One individual bird was
seen in ten minutes to insert a twig it was holding in its bill four times under
bark or into the end of a hollow branch. The probing motion was always
in an up-and-down direction with the bill pointing downwards. The bird
was not seen to catch or to eat anything. As the author himself said, "It
is difficult to speculate on such behaviour based on a single observation. I
have no proof that the bird actually was foraging, nor do I have any idea
how often tool-use occurs in this species, but the repetitions of probing
that I watched were similar enough to suggest that this behaviour was, if
not a stereotyped pattern, at least a regularly performed action".

or a lever to pry pieces of bark off tree trunks and limbs to get at insects.
On occasions the nuthatches were observed carrying single scales of bark
in their beaks, though more usually they would drop the "tool" once its
purpose had been served. Tool-use was noted principally outside the
seasons of heavy seed crop. Thus this behaviour may be of particular aid
to the species in foraging when the seed crop fails. The use of tools may
be confused easily with seed-cracking, which in this species is accom-
plished by wedging a seed into a depression of the bark and hammering
upon it with the bill. When cracking seeds or other objects in the bark
of long leaf pines, Brown-headed Nuthatches probably slough off scales
of the flaky bark, suddenly exposing prey. The process of wedging food
into a crevice is very suggestive of the way in which a flake of bark is used
for a wedge and the large seeds of the long leaf pine even somewhat
resemble a flake of bark. These similarities offer a possible explanation of
the origin of tool-use in this species, though at present it is known only
from a local population.
Also in the Nearctic, Potter (1970) studying anting behaviour in wild
birds, saw a juvenile American Robin Turdus migratorius which held a
twig in its beak and swept the ground by rotating its head through 180
degrees. The bird repeated this apparently successful attempt to locate
more ants in the leaf litter several times with the same twig, thus eliminat-
ing the possibility of chance behaviour. A single instance of very similar
behaviour by a Palaearctic member of the same genus, the Blackbird
Turdus merula is given by Priddy (1977). A male bird used a twig to clear
an area of snow about a foot square, presumably in the expectation of
uncovering food.
Margaret Coombes (pers. comm., February 1974), following an item
on animal tool-using in the BBC Animal Game programme, wrote: "A
Blue Tit landed on a nut hopper hanging in my garden. In his bill he was
holding a twig of about f-inch long and was pushing it between the nuts
in the hopper. When a nut fell through he dropped the twig and flew
off with the nut". I subsequently telephoned Mrs Coombes and she
explained that the bird must have used the twig for about three minutes.
The observation was made on February 17th, 1974. It is most appro-
priately regarded as the use of a tool as a poker or prod.
In an abstract of Millikan and Bowman (1967) in ibis 1968 no: 586,
K. E. L. Simmons mentioned a reliable report brought to his attention
of tool-using behaviour of the sort described for Cactospiza pallida , by a
wild Blue Tit Parus caeruleus , adding that he hoped the record would be
made generally available. Dr Simmons (pers. comm.) cannot now remem-
ber from whom he heard of the record, and to the present writer&amp;apos;s know-
ledge it has not been published. As far as Dr Simmons recalls, however,
one individual Blue Tit was concerned and the record was well documen-
ted, the bird using items such as pine needles to obtain food.

forceful movement of the head and the neck. The stones average about
five ounces in weight. The birds score hits with only about half the throws,

innate, but is a skill that the bird must learn for itself. The ease with which

the behaviour can be experimentally induced in the wild by putting out
hollow Ostrich eggs bought in curio shops has meant that it has been filmed
by several cine photographers in succession to Baron van Lawick, e.g. by
Douglas Fisher (1970) who filmed a bird at Tendaho, Wollo Province,
Ethiopia.
At the time that the Lawick-Goodalls first wrote of this behaviour it
was thought to be an original discovery, but as Jane van Lawick-Goodall
herself later pointed out (1970, p. 199) there is a 19th century reference to
the fact that the vulture uses stones to break Ostrich eggs. On "the author-
ity of the natives about the Orange River" in south-west Africa a certain
Sir James Alexander (quoted by Andersson 1856, p. 268) wrote that when
the Ostriches had left their nest in the middle of the day in search of food,
"a white Egyptian vulture may be seen soaring in mid-air, with a stone
between his talons. Having carefully surveyed the ground below him, he
suddenly lets fall the stone, and then follows it in rapid descent. Let the
hunter run to the spot, and he will find a nest of probably a score of eggs,
some of them broken by the vulture". It would seem very likely indeed
that the similar account by Wood (1877), to which attention was recently
drawn by Baxter, Urban and Brown (1969), has its origin in the same
account by Sir James Alexander.
A second 19th century reference has recently been brought to light by
Smith (1977). In March 1875 two sportsmen concealed near an Ostrich
nest in the Sudan waiting to shoot the returning bird, saw two vultures
hammering away at Ostrich eggs with stones (Myers, 1876). See also
Boswall (1977).
Whether "the natives about the Orange River" actually saw Egyptian
Vultures dropping stones from the sky, or whether they assumed from the
simultaneous presence of stones, broken eggshells and egg-eating vultures
that it was the most probable method, we do not know. The possible
use by Egyptian Vultures of stones as missiles dropped from above must
await critical confirmation. But in any case the story finds a striking parallel
in Australia, involving a ratite bird, a bird of prey and a 19th century native
account.
The possibility that the Black-breasted Buzzard Hamirostra melanosterna
might break the eggs of the Emu Dromaius novaehollandiae was apparently
first published in 1848 by John Gould on the authority of an aboriginal
account from western Australia. "This bird is so bold, that upon dis-
covering an Emu sitting on her eggs it will attack her with great ferocity
until it succeeds in driving her from them; then it takes up a stone with
its feet, and while hovering over the eggs lets the stone fall upon and
crush them, and then descends and devours their contents". Bennett
(1881) was told by aborigines in New South Wales that the Black-breasted
Buzzard, armed with a stone or a hard lump of calcined earth, approaches
the Emu's nest with outstretched wings, frightens the occupant off "and
with the stone breaks a hole in the side of each egg into which it inserts

a claw and carries them off at its leisure". A friend of Bennett's had recently
found an Emu's nest with five eggs, each egg having a hole in it, and in the
nest was a lump of calcined earth the size of a man's fist. Bennett himself
found an Emu's nest in 1900 (quoted in North 1912) containing broken
eggs, the contents of which had been devoured, and a stone which he
assumed had been used to break the eggs. "The Buzzard must have carried
this stone a long distance, as such a thing could not be found anywhere in
the vicinity". Bennett (op. cit.) also found in the nest of one pair of buzzards
portions of Emu eggshell, and in the nest of another pair the shells of two
eggs of the Australian Bustard Eupodotis australis. North also quoted
E. H. Lane who sent him a note from H. S. Burcher. "I have seen these
birds eating Emu eggs, often breaking them; on one occasion a large bone
was in the nest, and in the other a lump of burnt clay".
Casey (1966) recounted how Ostriches Struthio camelus were imported
from South Africa into parts of Australia in the latter half of the 19th
Century. One flock was kept on the Murray Downs in New South Wales
where "black-breasted buzzards ... are said to have used stones to break
the huge eggs ... This surprising ability to use a stone as a tool in this way
they acquired dealing similarly with emu eggs and with the eggs of the
Plain Turkey (the bustard)". This was in the 1880's.
Writing of the birds of a district of North Queensland, Berney (1905)
recounted how he found no less than six Black-breasted Buzzards "feeding
on a nest of half a dozen Emu-eggs, all broken and all fresh. In the nest...
was a round stone, the size of a domestic hen's egg, that I am sure was
never put there by the Emu. Now by what means was the news of the
discovery of that Emu's nest spread to gather up half a dozen of what is
with us certainly a rare bird ? I would not have thought there were that
number of Buzzards within a hundred miles of the place".
Under the heading "Rambling Memories", Leitch (1953) wrote:
"I was riding in company with the late Mr F. L. Berney, when he
pointed out a pair of Black-breasted Buzzards Hamirostra melanosterna
and told me he had actually seen them breaking emus' eggs by dropping
gibbers on the nest. It seemed fantastic, and I had never heard of it before,
though later the blacks confirmed it more than once.
"Less than a week later, I had the very great privilege of seeing it for
myself. My attention was drawn by the actions of a pair of buzzards rising
and falling over a patch of grass. I rode over to investigate and I got quite
close before the birds soared away to a great height, and saw very distinctly
what they were doing. Sliding down with their very distinctive flight, each
picked up a stone and, flapping over the nest, dropped it. I noticed two
stones had found their mark and three eggs were broken or cracked. But I
also noticed that many stones had missed their mark although I doubt if
any had been dropped from more than ten or twelve feet. The emus had
retired and were circling a good quarter of a mile away. I would have liked
to have seen the opening move, which must have meant the driving away

"I lately saw in some nature notes a description of the rifling of an emu's
nest by the buzzards. It described the birds as using the stones as hammers.
This was not so in the above incident, for they definitely dropped the
stones from the air".
Berney's published account did not refer to his having "actually seen
them breaking emu's eggs by dropping stones on the nest". It is possible
that he witnessed the event after publishing his note in 1905, or that
Leitch misremembered precisely what Berney had said. Leitch described
himself as having been a "very small boy in the middle eighties". If we
assume he was then eight, and that he wrote up his memories in 1952,
he would have been about 65 years of age. Leitch's account is so specific
that it is difficult to think of it as an uncritical observation, although he
may have been influenced by what he thought Berney had said.
H. G. Barnard (in Campbell and Barnard 1917) records how in the
Northern Territory he found a nest of the Brolga Crane Megalornis ( Grits)
rubicundns containing a single egg. "I observed a Black-breasted Buzzard
soaring over the plain a short distance away. I did not disturb the egg,
except to hold it up to see if it were fresh. On returning next day the nest
at first sight appeared empty, but on looking closer I observed small
pieces of egg-shell lying in the grass of the nest; there was also a small
round stone in the nest, which was certainly not there the day before . . .
The stone had certainly been brought from a short distance, there being
no stones in the immediate vicinity of the nest".
Chisholm (1971) quoted a charming aboriginal version of what is said
to happen. It was recounted by an aboriginal housemaid employed on a
district station in Western Australia. "Emu lay plenty feller big eggs. Big
feller eagle want 'em. Eagle fly round an' round. Emu nothin' get up;
keep alia time top of eggs. Eagle fly away old feller blacks' camp; gettem in
ash-heap, make 'imself white. Fly back emu's nest. Walk up emu's nest
wings like this" (spreading her arms). "Emu frightened feller. Run away.
Eagle pick up yabba (stone), drop 'im on emu egg. Cart 'em off longa nest
quick feller. Eatem up".
To sum up. Besides the aboriginal accounts the only observations that
could support the breaking open of eggs of the Emu, Australian Bustard,
Ostrich, or Brolga Crane by the Black-breasted Buzzard are as follows.
Leitch claimed in print, many years after the event, that he had seen two
buzzards dropping stones into an Emu's nest and found three broken or
cracked eggs. Bennett found pieces of Emu eggshell and bustard eggshell
each in buzzards' nests, and he and a friend each found a stone (or similar
object) and broken eggs in an Emu's nest. Burcher saw Emu eggs being
eaten and found a bone and a lump of clay in a nest. Casey's evidence for
the breaking of wild bustards' and domestic Ostriches' eggs is hearsay.
Berney found six buzzards consuming the contents of six Emu eggs in a
nest that also contained a stone. Lastly, Barnard found pieces of eggshell

and a stone in the nest of a crow (sp ?).
I have quoted and analysed the observations in some detail because,
based on the same quotations, Chisholm (1954, 1 9^9&amp;gt; 1971a, 1971b, 1972)
has concluded that there is "ample evidence to indicate that a Buzzard
may adapt 'shock' tactics to disturb a brooding Emu" (1971a), and that
tool-using by the buzzard is an established fact. To me it seems unproven
although the circumstantial evidence is perhaps strong. It is unfortunate
that these alleged instances should have been so widely quoted, e.g. by
Lawick-Goodall (1970), Alcock (1972), Van Tyne and Berger (1976),
Wilson (1975) and others.
In the avian section of her review of tool-using by vertebrate animals,
under the sub-heading "Use of stones as 'weapons' and sticks for beating"
Lawick-Goodall (1970) wrote,
"Two captive Bald Eagles Haliaeetus leucocephalus (one old bird of some
35 years and the other a 2- to 3-year-old taken as a fledgling from the nest)
were observed using objects aggressively on a variety of occasions. Three

times the old bird took a small rock in one foot and used this to smash
crickets (twice) and one giant hairy scorpion. On a number of other occa-
sions both birds, after first trying to use their feet but being prevented by
the jesses with which they were secured, picked up stones in their beaks
and threw them horizontally forward for distances of up to 24 inches at
crickets. Several times the crickets were killed by such throws. On no
occasion was the victim eaten: once a cricket was picked up in the beak but
immediately shaken violently to the ground as though it tasted unpleasant.
"Both birds threw stones in the same manner at a tame Western
Gopher Turtle--which was unharmed. Also each of the eagles once
used a stick to 'beat' this turtle. The stick was held in the beak, swung
upward with a dorsolateral movement of head and neck, and brought down
forcefully on to the objective. These movements were repeated until the
turtle moved out of reach. In view of the fact that these eagles are known
to feed on turtles in the wild it is not clear exactly what these captive birds
were trying to accomplish. The young eagle., when held 'on the gloved
frequently picked up the ring on its chain and threw it towards its owner.
This continued until the bird hit him on the arm and thus obtained his
attention, whereupon it immediately ceased the bombardment 55 .
To summarise; these Bald Eagles thus used stones in their talons as
hammers, threw stones as missiles, wielded a stick held in the beak as a
cudgel, and threw an object to attract attention. All four seem to qualify
as tool-using.
The use of tools by White-winged Choughs Corcorax melanorhamphus
for opening fresh-water mussels Velesunio ambiguus was first reported by
McDonald (1970). At Lake Hattah in the Hattah Lakes National Park in
Victoria, Australia, he wrote,
"I had often heard a light hammering sound by the lake shores, with no
person in sight from which the tappings emanated. One day I decided... to
investigate the origin of the unusual sound and this led me to discover ... a
large male White-winged Chough hammering away at a fresh-water
mussel. The improvised 'hammer 5 being used was one half of an old, dry
shell of the same species. It was grasped in the bird's bill, with the convex
side held downwards towards the ground. The chough would stand high
on his feet and bring the hammer almost vertically on to the highest spot
of the mussel (the 'beak 5 or umbo) which is the softest part of the shell of
these bivalves. Several hard blows would be made before the bird paused
for a few seconds rest, only to resume the pounding again with renewed
vigour. Soon a breach was made in the shell at the desired spot and, holding
the mussel down with his right foot, the knowing bird began inserting
its strong bill and dragging out pieces of the animal living inside 55 .
"I had seen many of these mussel shells with holes punched in one side,
always at the high, soft 'beak 5 . These were often in heaps or so and pre-
viously I had thought that the Eastern Water-rat Hydromya chrysogaster
was responsible for them. Now it was time to attribute at least some of the

breached shells to the wily choughs, the ones responsible for the fairly
frequent tapping sounds along the shores of the lake. (The Park assistant,
Mr G. W. Anderson, states that he actually saw a chough hammering a
mussel against the butt of an empty beer bottle, but I, personally, have
seen nothing to verify this.)"
Hobbs (1971) observed apparently similar behaviour, in New South
Wales some 650 km distant from McDonald's locality (which was in Vic-
toria, Australia). I will quote verbatim key extracts from Hobbs' clear and
fascinating account.
"The bird tried to open the mussel, which was held down by either
foot, hammering it with the bill or trying to insert the bill between the
margins of the valves. The birds often appeared impatient, running round
with mussels, dropping them and picking them up, or others previously
discarded.
"During this activity the birds eventually came across empty shells.
Immediately, if the bird was carrying a mussel, it dropped it and picked
up the empty valve. Holding it so that it pointed downwards, with the
convex side away from its breast, the bird repeatedly struck the unopened
mussel with it. Usually the blows were made with a slight side-to-side
movement of the head so that the mussel was struck a double blow; when
broken valves were used, direct downward blows were made. The blows
did not appear to be aimed at any particular part of the mussel. Occasion-
ally, an unopened mussel was used as a hammer, also with an attempt at
the double stroking blow; sometimes the target was missed; at others the
bird simply dropped the # tooP on the mussel, after holding it high with
outstretched neck. The impression was that the weight of the unopened
mussel was too great for them to be used effectively. During hammering,
the 'tool' often broke; the chough either continued to hammer with the
remaining part until it was reduced to about 10 mm in size, or picked up
and used other pieces. When a valve had become useless the chough re-
verted to probing or hammering with the bill and, if still unable to open
the mussel, picked it up and ran round until another suitable hammer was
found.
"During this search, the mussel was often knocked against suitable
objects, such as a fallen branch, an exposed tree-root or another unopened
mussel. The bird held the mussel across the middle and usually with a
double stroking blow struck the posterior and anterior ends of the
mussel against the anvil. Once or twice, the ventral edge of larger mussels
was struck directly downward on the anvil.
"The mussels did not break or open easily. Unfortunately, because the
birds were very active and the branch partly obstructed my view, I could
not follow the whole process from finding to opening a mussel. One bird
rained forty-two blows on one mussel before its tool completely dis-
integrated; it then was lost to view among the other birds. However, I
saw mussels opened several times, the breach being made near the posterior

or anterior end, along the ventral margin or at the umbo".
The White-winged Chough is unusual among tool-using birds in that
it employs more than one technique, the use of an object held in the bill
as a hammer, and the throwing of that object as a missile. And just to
enhance its versatility, it also beats its prey against an anvil (see also
Chisholm 1971b).
A delightful account by Alfred Russell Wallace (1877) from the Aru
Islands is well worth quoting in detail. It concerns the Palm Cockatoo
Probosciger aterrimus known to Wallace as the Great Black Cockatoo. The
bird uses a piece of vegetation as a tool.
"It eats various fruits and seeds, but seems more particularly attached
to the kernel of the kanary-nut, which grows on a lofty forest tree Canarium
commune , abundant in the islands where this bird is found; and the manner
in which it gets at these seeds shows a correlation of structure and habits,
which would point out the "kanary" as its special food. The shell of this
nut is so excessively hard that only a heavy hammer will crack it; it is
somewhat triangular, and the outside is quite smooth. The manner in
which the bird opens these nuts is very curious. Taking one endways in
its bill and keeping it firm by a pressure of the tongue, it cuts a transverse
notch by a lateral sawing motion of the sharp-edged lower mandible. This
done, it takes hold of the nut with its foot, and biting off a piece of leaf
retains it in the deep notch of the upper mandible, and again seizing the
nut, which is prevented from slipping by the elastic tissue of the leaf,
fixes the edge of the lower mandible in the notch, and by a powerful nip
breaks off a piece of the shell. Again, taking the nut in its claws, it inserts
the very long and sharp point of the bill and picks out the kernel, which is
seized hold of, morsel by morsel, by the extensible tongue. Thus every
detail of form and structure in the extraordinary bill of this bird seems to
have its use, and we may easily conceive that the black cockatoos have
maintained themselves in competition with their more active and more
numerous white allies, by their power of existing on a kind of food which
no other bird is able to extract from its stony shell".
The use of the leaf material has been described by Chisholm (1971b)
as an "anti-skid" device.
The account of tool-using for the purpose of body-care by a Double-
crested Cormorant Phalacrocorax auritus by Meyerriecks (1972) is worth
quoting at some length.
"Two of the cormorants were dozing while the remainder were preening
and head-scratching. As I watched, one of the preening adults it would
stretch its head and bill, in what seemed like an awkward manner to me,
back towards its uropygial gland, squeeze the gland then apply the secre-
tion to its wing feathers with broad sweeps or dabs of the anointed bill.
Suddenly, as the cormorant postured with its wings widespread, one of its
secondary feathers, loosened by the moulting process, blew away from the
extended wing and landed about a foot in front of the cormorant. The bird

turned and stared at the feather for several moments, then it picked up the
feather and held it cross-wise in its bill. It held this pose for several mom-
ents, then adjusted its grip on the feather's shaft so that the object was
held almost parallel with the bill. The cormorant then deftly applied the
tip of the feather to the preen gland by simply turning its head and ex-
tending the feather towards the gland. Next, the cormorant used the feather
as a brush by applying the preen gland secretion to its extended right
wing, doing so by making side to side sweeps with its head, the bill still
holding the shaft of the feather. The sweeping brush-like motions were
made smoothly and unhurriedly.
"The bird continued this behaviour, making three sets of such sweeping
motions over its extended wings, once on the right wing, twice on the left,
each sweep preceded by an application of the secondary feather tip to the
preen gland. The gland was not manipulated by the bill after the feather
had been grasped the first time. At no time did the cormorant modify
the tool so as to render the 'brush' a more efficient tool.
"A passing motorboat startled the cormorants and the tool-using bird
opened its bill slightly; a light easterly breeze wafted the secondary
feather from the bird's bill to a place about a foot to the cormorant's left.
The bird stared at the feather for a few moments, reached out and picked
it up and manipulated it for a few moments more. Then the bird released
the feather and the breeze carried it out over the bay to a point about
20 feet from the tool-user. The bird made no effort to retrieve its tool, and
further observation of the tool-user and the other cormorants failed to
reveal any further tool-using".
In this instance the bird was using one of its own body products, a
feather, to attain a goal in what seemed to the author, "to be an easier
performance than its typical preening and oiling behaviour".

NOTES ON SOME SPECIES OF PARROT IN CAPTIVITY
By George A. Smith (Peterborough)

Introduction
RuppelPs Parrot comes from arid south-west Africa and might be

considered to be but a well differentiated geographical race of (the very
widely spread) Meyer's Parrot P. meyeri were it not that their distribution
overlaps marginally. We do not know whether the two species interbreed
v/here they meet: perhaps they do, but obviously it would not be recorded
if the hybrid offspring were not intermediate in colour and looked exactly
like one of the parent species. The great distinction between the two is
that RuppelPs is sexually dimorphic (the female has the rump and thighs
coloured blue whereas in the male these areas are the same grey as the
other body feathers). They weigh about 110 g. (3 ozs); that is about as much
as an Indian Ringneck or three times that of a Peach-faced Lovebird
Agapornis roseicollis. Illustrations correctly show them to be brownish in
hue; but in life, and from a little distance, they appear grey. They have
rich yellow garters to their legs and yellow wing-butts.
The recent war in Angola and the (much belated) introduction of
quarantine here for imported birds have made it improbable that RuppelPs
Parrot will once again become a common import. Mine were bought
five years back as wild-caught adults, and because of their destructiveness,
one of the two pairs was promptly given to a friend. The male has since
tamed down considerably although his wife remains suspicious. The pair
never seem to be affected by the cold and damp of winter. They are
particularly fond of fruit, but then they are so catholic in their diet that
they will eat almost everything offered. They are particularly partial to
hawthorn berries, the opening of such hard seeds well proves the enormous
bite they have to their jaws.
The Holyoaks (1972) have studied the behaviour of RuppelPs and other
Poicephalus parrots and little is to be added to their keen observations.
My pair appear to have a permanent pair bond and usually keep well in
sight of one another. They often fly to, and walk over, the ground searching
for food. They bathe in standing water and by rubbing themselves against
damp foliage and they will purposely set out to soak themselves in rain
showers. They hold large food items in the foot to eat and they do not
roost inside the nest box, except when breeding, and then the male does
not join her for the night. They seem extremely tolerant of the birds in
the next aviaries.

Breeding
Until I had these birds I had never really believed that any parrot could
cut itself a nest chamber into the wood of a growing tree. It is very likely
that Ruppell's could, even though the tree were an oak. This pair have
always seemed only too ready to breed, but the nest boxes I gave always
defeated them. The pair chew at the interior of the breeding chamber
throughout the year. Like conures, it is usual for one at a time to excavate
while the other perches, as a lookout, nearby, and in this particular pair
it is the male who is the chief engineer. An alarm call usually brings the
digging bird out into the open. In 1976, after successive boxes had been
chewed to bits, I managed to get a cube of ash wood sawn to a nest box
size. This was then laboriously chiselled out to make what I hoped would
be a near-indestructible nest. The block split along one side and the pair
worked at this crack until it became a gaping hole. This year, 1977, I
became determined to breed them. Their aviary was changed and this time
they were given a nest box of 1 inch thick elm boards with quarter-split
pine logs screwed into the corners to give them something to chew at. The
box, however, was not entirely to their liking, probably being too large
and perhaps too exposed as well--it was hung at the end of the flight. In
early June, therefore, a much smaller version of the same box was hung
in the comparative darkness of their shelter and this 18 x 6 x 6 inch
box immediately proved acceptable. Within the first hour the birds were
chewing away inside and the week after this they began to pair with a
greater vigour than ever before.
Courtship and pairing have been seen intermittently throughout the
year. Courtship includes the invariable regurgitatory feeding. Although
the birds are of the same size, the male always seems so much taller and
bigger during courtship. Sometimes, when under tension the male has
bowed up and down: this movement is not directed against the hen but
seems to be movement anticipating flight. A bout of courtship follows a
preening session. They, like Red-capped Parrots Pionopsitta pileata ,
simultaneously preen each other's head. During preening the repro-
ductively-active male lifts his nearside leg to try and put it on the back
of the hen. Usually she scuttles away or pushes him away with her foot.
Eventually, however, he gets to mount with both feet on the hen's back
and might manage a few copulatory thrusts. The hen usually then lifts
her head to squabble with him and off he jumps. It is now (after having
made a half-hearted copulatory attempt) that he begins his courtship
display. He droops both wings so that they hang by his sides as if they
were broken. I feel that the feathers at the leading edge of the wing are
fluffed slightly because the yellow of the wing is particularly broad-
looking. The tail is raised slightly above the horizontal. The slightly
cocked tail, the drooping wings, the chattering song and the ruffled head
feathers give the male the appearance of a courting cock House Sparrow
Passer domesticus. As the male excitedly parades to and fro, chattering and

moving his jaws he, every so often, spins around in circles. The yellow
carpal patch shows with a great vividness because of the way that the
wings are held away from the body.
Usually it is the male who instigates pairing, but not always for I have
seen the hen try to "insert herself 5 * under him. Usually it is the male who
tries to get his nearside foot onto the back of the hen as they sit preening:
the hen, in most cases, moves away. (Many parrots, and this is so notice-
able with tame birds who, at the time, do not want to be caressed, gently
ward off, with their nearside foot any unwanted attentions.) The male,
undaunted, will then try again to mount. He may regurgitate and feed the
hen. In regurgitation the neck-bobbing is not particularly pronounced. A
sexually soliciting hen might turn herself round and round as she walks
excitedly up and down whereas twisting in the male is very much more
frequent. He, unlike she, walks trailing his wings so that the carpus, the
end of the yellow, is level with the top of the perch and the tips of the
wings droop below it. After a few pirouettes he will try again to mount.
When he has done so his wings droop either side enveloping her. This
complete "tenting" of the hen by the male's wings is also seen in the
African Grey Psittacus erithacus. It is interesting to note that, like Ring-
necks and lovebirds, the side at which he copulates is periodically alter-
nated. As he treads the hen she sometimes lifts her beak upwards and he
might feed or squabble with her. I am none too certain as to whether she
raises her head to be fed or as a mild threat. The head of the male, when
treading or when he is courtship parading, looks a little larger than that
of his mate because her head feathers are sleeked and his puffed out. The
frequency of copulation can be considerable in each pairing session, yet
most of the matings are unsuccessful (that is there is no exchange of
semen). Sometimes the male might mount on the back of the hen and then
spring immediately off to land on the opposite side and go strutting off
like a turkey cock. Other times he might jump right over her back, like a
lory. The hen has been seen after copulatory attempts to fly off a little
distance and then fly back to the male and solicit him by slumping against
him as she does so she puts her near side foot up as if warding him off. He
then lifts his foot and the two half-heartedly grapple with each others'
foot and sometimes "hold hands". It was noticeable that the spins of the
male increase with his nearness to the hen. Mating seemed to take place
more at certain times of the day: in the morning an hour after the sun was
up and again in the early evening. Each period lasting for a rough half
hour. By late July they were still pairing; but had yet to lay. Eventually
they will breed, I feel certain.
Salvadori's Fig Parrot Psittaculirostris salvadorii
Fig parrots are rare importations to Britain. The first example was of
seven Desmarest's (or the Golden-headed) P. desmarestii occidentalis
brought over by W. C. Frost in 1938. These were beautifully portrayed in

a water-colour by Roland Green executed to illustrate an article by Tavi-
stock (1938b). In the immediate post-war period the Keston Foreign Bird
Farm had a Double-eyed Fig Parrot Opopsitta diophthalma (Boosey
x 955 ?) and a few years later the London Zoo another of which, unfortu-
nately, all I can recall was how surprised I was to find it to be slightly
smaller than a lovebird. I was rather sceptical, therefore, when Mrs
Stephanie Belford told me that she was about to import some Salvadori's
Fig Parrots. (Salvadori's has been practically unreported in the wild: Rand
&amp; Gilliard (1967) referred to it as "one of the rare New Guinea birds.
Rare, at least, in collections" (meaning museum collections). This scarcity
still applied when Forshaw (1973) compiled his Parrots of the World:
he found less than a handful of skins to examine). Incredibly 24 birds
arrived in late April 1977 and were successfully quarantined by Mrs
Belford. By June I had receipt of my five pairs. They were put together
into a small indoor aviary and then, for even the worst of English sum-
mers sometimes relaxes enough to let the sun smile for a few days, it
finally became warm enough to put them outside in early July. As I par-
ticularly wished to see how they integrated as a flock, they were kept
together.
Description
Tavistock (1938b) said of Desmarest's Fig Parrot that, in size and build,
they were not very unlike some of the Poicephali , especially Meyer's Parrot
Poicephalus meyeri; but this resemblance, he thought, was superficial for,
"in spite of their lack of brush tongue, in voice and movements they
seemed to be almost typical lorikeets". At the time he wrote this he had
no Poicephalus (Tavistock 1938a). If he had, I strongly doubt that he
would have made his analogy with Meyer's Parrot, for they are nothing
like. But for all that, he was correct, in my opinion, in seeing their very
close resemblance to lorikeets. In fact, to myself, they perfectly prove how
inconsequential can be such things as the presence of a brush tongue, the
method of lifting the foot to scratch the head or the strengthening of the
skull as characters for diagnosing "families" of parrot, for these are some
differences with the lories. Salvadori's Fig Parrot is about the size and
substance of one of the Trichoglossus haematodus lorikeets: even down to
the sharp tail (Forshaw's pen must have slipped when he said the tail
was rounded). The three weighed an average of 118 g: that is slightly less
than an Indian Ringneck Psittacula krameri. The general impression is
of a green bird with the bulky outline of a Common Starling Sturnus
vulgaris. The elongated feathers of the face and chin are of a brighter
yellow in the male and in whom this colour extends right over the back
of his head. Behind the eye is a spot of blue, again brighter in the male;
the forehead of the hen is bluer. Cocks have a quarter-moon bib of red
on the upper chest: in the hens this crescent is dull blue except next to
the wing butts where it is chestnut. Young males appear to have greenish-

blue chests with a very few scattered red feathers. The iris is a dull
mahogany-black; the feet are greenish-grey and the black bill is broad and
slightly bulbous. The flight feathers have the same broad pale stripe as is
so general in brush-tongued parrots. Indeed the pattern and tones of the
feather colours would not seem out of place on a lorikeet.
Voice
They are not loud-voiced; the contact call of zit , zit is uttered before
and after landing and is higher pitched when it becomes the alarm call. It
is the sort of noise made by most lorikeets in having a touch of damp-
finger-rubbed-on-glass "edge" about it.
Distribution
There are three well marked geographical races of Psittaculirostris --all
confined to the immediate New Guinea area. Diamond (1972) said "the
three semispecies . . . constitute a superspecies ring in the lowlands of
New Guinea". And Forshaw (1973) "the three species replace each other
geographically and form a superspecies". Rand &amp; Gilliard (1967) agree
with this view: calling them "closely related species". (If, indeed, they are
but one species then our bird is P. desmarestii salvadorii.) This geographical
isolate is found on the northern coast (up to a height of 3,500 feet) of

We do not know anything of their natural food in the wild except that
they are more often found in fruiting than in flowering trees. And that,
like the Rainbow Lorikeet T. haematodus , they cut holes, with their strong
bills, through the woody pericarp of fig {Ficus) fruits (Diamond 1972).
Tavistock (1938b) said that his captive Desmarest's preferred to live on
banana and other fruits and, though they drank a little nectar, they ate
no seeds. These ten Salvadori's eat practically everything that I put before
them, including peanuts, hemp and sunflower seed, bread in milk, soft
fruits from the garden, banana, apple and orange. They seem not to drink
nectar or eat green food. Among the seeds that I cannot yet get them to
take are pine nuts and millet, nor are they very partial to canary seed. In
their aviary they have twiggy branches for perches and they have removed
most of the bark to eat the soft cambium. Being such acrobatic birds, the
bark is removed just as readily from the under side as the top of the perches,
for they will hang just as easily upside down as right way up.
General behaviour
They give the impression that they must hurtle through the air to keep
themselves buoyant (just as someone with a poor sense of balance stops
from falling off a bicycle by pedalling at a furious pace), for they fly in an

almost straight course with very rapidly beating wings and have little
manoeuvrability. Because they cannot steer themselves very well in the
air, and sit very close to one another, sometimes a sudden start will cause
two birds to collide on take-off. When the fallen bird flies up from the
ground it cannot, seemingly, rise more than four feet in a fifteen-foot long
aviary. Yet they can, and are frequently seen to, bound up to alight on far
higher perches by taking short, near-vertical flights upwards. But, in this
case, the elevation is more the result of leg- rather than wing-power, for
Salvadori's Fig Parrots bounce and bound upon their legs quite as much
as, if not more than, they walk. They are very sprightly and climb and
swing quite as easily as titmice. If they are moving along a horizontal
perch they may walk but, more usually, progress by rapid, bouncy, hops
in which, commonly, on each landing, they face the opposite way to
take-off. Two-footed jumping in most other parrots is a challenge, or
threat perhaps, the head-lowered position in which these jumps are taken
avoids this aggressive aspect. When they are "cantankerous" the feathers
on the mantle--between the shoulder blades--are slightly fluffed and the
head held slightly higher while they bounce. And threatening birds puff
these feathers and those of the head while they lower and raise the head
on a slightly stretched neck (which movements are typical for lories).
Before flying they generally signal their intention by bobbing the head up,
down and up. Courtship has not been observed except for a mutual chase
in which either sex might pursue the other with jumps and flights over
each other's back. Only once have I seen one, a male, feed another and
then that was done with such little head bobbing that I am not certain
that any food was passed over. The ten should form five pairs--perhaps
they do, but they are so very sociable together that if they have a permanent
pair bond--and two pairs seem to--then it is not always apparent, for
when they doze during the day, some sit singly, others in pairs or trios.
The first night, and ever since they were put into their aviary, the group
of ten roosted together inside the same nest box. In the indoor flight they
had no box and slept in one, close-clumped, group (just as if they were
waxbills) along the highest perch.
Considering that they were wild-caught they are reasonably steady and
by no means secretive. They are just as likely to sit outside on the perches
during the day as snooze in the shelter. The one exception is if the day
should be sunny, when most keep indoors. They seem not to bask in the
sun and they love to bathe in standing water. Sometimes they have been
seen on the ground, after fallen fruits. They perch quite as readily on the
very low perches as on the highest, from which I assume that, in a state
of nature, they obtain their food from bushes and low-growing plants just
as readily as from the trees. They drink, like most birds, by taking up a
mouthful and then lifting the head to let the water run down into the
throat. It remains now to find out how hardy they are in the winter.

By Iain Grahame (Lamarsh, Bures, Suffolk)
At the time of writing, almost two years have passed since the inaugural
meeting of WPA at Ashmere in September 1975. This seems an appro-
priate time to review the Association's progress.
It is difficult to think of any threatened group of birds that lends itself
more readily to sound methods of aviculture than the majority of the
Galliformes. No less than a third of the 49 species of true pheasants are
listed in the iucn red data book, and other families within the scope of
WPA, notably the cracids from Central and South America and certain
megapodes and tetraonids, are not only becoming equally scarce in the
wild, but the life habits of some species have yet to be fully investigated.
Some offer a considerable challenge to avicuiturists; for example, the
Old World grouse species are notoriously difficult to sustain in captivity.
The aim of WPA is to co-ordinate, at an international level, the efforts
of scientists, sportsmen, avicuiturists, ornithologists and others concerned
with the conservation of these birds and the wild places in which they live.
There are many sides to the programme on which WPA has embarked--
field studies and censuses of wild populations, the establishment of reserve
collections and buffer stocks, scientific research, improved aviculture, etc.,
--but the scope of this paper is limited to the avicultural aspects of the
Association.
WPA is a non-governmental member of IUCN and has a flourishing
membership from people in more than 40 countries, including many

Heiner Jacken, Arnolds-Vievers and Dr H-S Raethel, Germany; Manuel
Troncoso Ramos, Spain; and Keith Howman, Grenville Roles, John
Mallet, Newton Steel, William Newlands and others from Britain. Through
the very active participation of these individuals and the owners of other
private and public collections, many new and improved techniques of
pheasant management are being evolved and disseminated. Training days,
conventions and regular informative articles in a variety of publications
have, it is believed, all been of great assistance; and two annual WPA
journals, each of approximately 150 pages, have now been sent free to
all members.
Inbreeding of captive stock is a common problem to owners of birds and
animals. Many pheasant species, notably the Edwards's Lophura edwardsi
and the Brown Eared Crossoptilon mantchuricum , are descended from a few
individuals imported many decades ago. Since the formation of WPA, it
has been encouraging to note the practical attempts by aviculturists to
alleviate this problem. Dr Tim Lovel, Council Member of both WPA
and the Avicultural Society, is now the official stud book holder for the
Edwards's Pheasant and, under his guidance, the majority of captive
stock is now ringed, and infusions of less closely related blood from North
America and France have taken place. Jersey Zoo are to be thanked for
their interest and participation in housing and breeding some of these
newly imported birds. Lovel (1977) writes that "Far from being a dis-
advantage to have organization of this kind, it is a positive advantage both
to the individual breeder disposing of his young birds, and also in negotia-
tions with Governments, who can thus be persuaded that an organization
such as the World Pheasant Association genuinely intends to benefit the
endangered species with which it concerns itself". One well known Ameri-
can breeder, who had kept a self-sustaining nucleus of Edwards's Pheasants
for many years, and had distributed them all over North America, was
forced recently to kill and eat the young birds that he had bred, and the
next year to eat all the eggs, because well-meaning legislation had pro-
hibited the transport of this species across state boundaries, so preventing
him from selling his surplus stock (Moore 1977). WPA can and does make
effective representations at the highest levels of government, both to modify
existing legislation and to advise on proposed new laws. For example the
U.S.A. regulations mentioned above have recently been lifted in respect

had only moderate success. Though generally prolific layers, captive mat-
ings are often hard to accomplish. Until 1977 many phasianists were of the
opinion that a large proportion of males were naturally sterile. Now,
through artificial insemination trials conducted through WPA at Cam-
bridge University, this theory seems untenable. Fertility among eight cock
birds, some of which had never fertilised their mates under normal aviary
conditions, was surprisingly high. Seventy-three of the first 100 eggs laid
by artificially inseminated hen birds proved to be fertile. The problem,
therefore, would appear to be a behavioural one and further research is
intended on improved aviary design and management of this species. In
America, methods of determining the sexes of the crossoptilons have
recently also been studied and recorded (Thompson 1976).
Periodical importations of wild stock for new blood are of great impor-
tance to aviculmrists, but governmental restrictions and regulations often
make this difficult. A start, however, has been made and WPA, through the
co-operation of certain members, now has its own quarantine quarters in
Britain. In 1977 ten pairs of Himalayan Blood Pheasant Ithaginis c. emeritus
and a trio of Nepal Koklass Pucrasia nipalensis were collected from Nepal
and brought to the authors' collection at Daws Hall (which is also the
headquarters of WPA) in Suffolk. Similar importations are expected in
1978 from Pakistan, in exchange for the large numbers of eggs sent to that
country of rare, indigenous species for the establishment of reserve
collections.
Each year WPA conducts worldwide censuses of captive Galliformes
and the results are published in full in the Journal. In 1976, the where-
abouts of more than 35,000 pheasants (excluding the game pheasants
Phasianus colchicus ) was established; the 1977 census covered the cracids
and megapodes (Brown 1977) and in 1978 censuses will be taken of the
rarer grouse, quail, francolins and partridges.
Many of the 81 projects listed in the current WPA Conservation
Programme, for which a successful appeal for over #100,000 was launched
in 1976, will be of direct benefit to aviculturists. These include the results
of research carried out on the Edwards's and Brown Eared Pheasants,
improved management for vegetarian species and the re-publication by
Spur Publications in conjunction with WPA, of a revised and updated
edition of Delacour's the pheasants of the world.
WPA at present owns no central collection of pheasants and related
birds, but it is believed that all the major existing collections, with one
sad exception, have close ties in one way or another, with the Association.
Most of the best private collections are, by kind co-operation of the owners,
open by appointment to members.
At a time when Man advances remorselessly through the remaining
vestiges of pheasant habitat and life studies of even the Golden Pheasant
have yet to be fully researched in its native China, the World Pheasant
Association seeks the support of all those concerned with the future of

KEEPING AND BREEDING MALAY GREAT ARGUS

After a number of failures., in 1976 the Berlin Zoo was successful in
breeding the Malay Great Argus Argusianus argus argus , a pheasant which
has become rare in European collections. At present one cock and two hens
are kept. Each hen has her own outdoor cage (6 by 4 m.) with a heated
indoor room where the birds spend the night in winter. The cock shares
the cage alternatively with each of the hens. The outdoor aviary is heavily
planted with bamboo and shrubs of various kinds. Contrary to many other
pheasants, this species usually does not damage the vegetation at all.
The Argus Pheasants receive a diet consisting of pheasant pellets, grain,
some meat as well as salad; besides they get some mealworms as a delicacy.
During the mating season in July and August 1976, the cock's call--a
loud "Kwiau"--could be heard over a long distance, but the copulation
could not be observed. Both hens built a scanty nest inside their indoor
room where they incubated their light reddish-cream coloured eggs for
25 days. Each hen had two eggs, but only one chick hatched from each
clutch. As soon as this had happened, the cock was separated.
The young Argus Pheasants, both males, have grown well, receiving
the normal diet and a lot of living insects three times per day.

Among the many notable successes at the Wildfowl Trust's centres
during 1977 is the first captive breeding of the Black-headed Duck
Heteronetta atricapilla. This species is brood parasitic, laying its eggs in a
variety of other birds' nests, the host species including other ducks, egret,
ibis, coot and even the Snail Kite. At Slimbridge most of the eggs were
artificially incubated and the ducklings reared, but one egg was incubated

Fifty years ago in 1927, the Avicultural Society was in its 33rd year and
its membership almost topped the 500 mark, passing the 1909 record of
451. The Society was pleased to be able to boast of six original members--
Cooper, Fillmer, J. B. Housden, Mrs. Mortimer, St. Quintin and Towns-
end. Fillmer and Housden both died in 1942, but James Cooper's name
continued to appear in the membership list until 1947, the last to have
"Orig. Member" behind it, although David Seth-Smith was later accorded
this honour as he had joined the Society within three months of its founda-

Two new species of lovebird were introduced to British aviculture: the
Masked, recorded by Seth-Smith in June, and the Fischer's, described
by Capt. H. S. Stokes (first breeder of the Nyasa and still an Honorary
Member of the Society) in October. Both species were acquired through
the enterprise of the famous dealer of Tottenham Court Road, G. B.
Chapman, who, in a further importation of birds from Tanganyika in
December, obtained a single wild-caught blue specimen of the Masked
and defrayed the cost of the lovely coloured plate of this bird by Roland
Green, which appeared early the following year. The first blue Masked
was a female and went to the London Zoo. By the end of 1927 no less
than three persons had bred the normal Masked more or less simul-
taneously, so the medal could not be awarded. The Duke of Bedford (then
Marquis of Tavistock) bred the Fischer's early the following year. Also

World Pheasant Association Journal II, 1976-77. Published by The
World Pheasant Association. 1977. PP I2 5 - 6 col. pis. Many photos and
drawings. #4.
This well produced journal contains a wide range of papers of interest
and value to those who keep and are concerned with the welfare of the
Galliformes. It is the second of the Association's Journals published since
its formation some two years ago and the contents begin with a report on
the progress and priorities of the Association followed by a paper setting
out the research programme designed to rehabilitate the Masked Bobwhite
Quail Colinus virginianus ridgwayi in at least part of its former range, parts
of Arizona and adjoining areas of Mexico. This project is a model of what,
where it is practicable, all such programmes should be. It starts with a
study of the natural history of this race which became endangered by the
destruction of its habitat by over-grazing of the grasslands and consequent
change of vegetation. Population trends in Sonora, Mexico, have been
studied, habitat and food requirements investigated and captive propaga-
tion at the Patuxent Wildlife Center, together with research on nutritional
requirements of the birds, carried out. Training of the birds to be released
so that they can fend for themselves is an important part of the programme
so that when sufficient area of suitable habitat has been re-created, there
seems every hope for success.
The nutrition of pheasants is dealt with in detail and diets for pheasants
of all ages given. The pellet foods given to the domesticated Turkey, with
supplements, are advised, but one questions "The temptation to supply
natural foods should be avoided in general. Unless properly balanced, there
can be detrimental effects on the overall health and ultimate response".
Later the author modifies this in respect of green food for the "herbivorous
species" (but are tragopans, koklass and blood pheasants more herbivorous
than most others ?) and of insects and their larvae for chicks. There is a
table of recommended rations graded according to size of species (not
"breeds"), but we all know how variable can the appetite be and the good
"stockman" can tell how hungry his charges are and give accordingly.
The Nocturnal Curassow Nothocrax urumutum is the subject of the
next article, a study of this little known species in its wild state and in
captivity. Equally little known is the race of Crested Argus Pheasant
Rheinartia ocellata nigrescens inhabiting mountainous parts of the Malay
peninsula and the next paper sets out the known history of the species and
suggests points about the Malayan race that need to be elucidated. The
results of the Association's sponsored expedition in 1976 are in preparation
for the next journal.
It is something of a surprise to learn from a paper on the early menageries
and animal trade that two species of curassow, Crax alector and C. pauxi ',

were freely bred in Holland some 200 years ago. An article on the possible
re-introduction of the Capercaillie to the Gran Faradiso national park in
north-western Italy by the two authors who visited the park and advised
the authorities there, sets out the problems and the course most likely to
have a chance of success. It is not certain that this bird ever lived in the
area, but it formerly inhabited other parts of the Italian alps and no doubt
the reason for its extermination there is much the same as that in Scotland
where the Capercaillie became extinct in the late 18th century, but has,
of course, been successfully restored by the bringing in of Scandinavian
birds some 140 years ago.
A census of cracids and megapodes in captivity in the world reveals how
comparatively few are kept, the Razor-billed Curassow with in and the
Brush Turkey with 109 being the most numerous, though, naturally,
there is no claim that the census is complete --Crax unicornis in the Ant-
werp Zoo, for instance, is not included.
Diseases of the Galliformes--or some of them--are described and
advice on treatment given. The great difficulty is often, of course, one of
accurate diagnosis by the unqualified.
Experiments in artificial insemination of four pheasant species are
described, but as the authors point out, these were of a preliminary nature,
so conclusions should not be drawn from them. While birds that are tame
and not distressed by handling can, no doubt, be successfully inseminated
in this way, one would expect ovulation to be inhibited in the more nervous
birds. A stud book for Edwards's Pheasant is described and so is what is
presumably the first captive breeding of Salvadori's Pheasant Lophura
inornate rare in collections and little known. A paper on the artificial
incubation of waterfowl and pheasant eggs advocates a temperature in the
machine of around 99*F, lower for larger goose or swan eggs and slightly
higher (99-5*) for such as pheasant or teal eggs. Results obtained by the
author include the Eider Duck, that used to be considered one of the most
difficult to incubate by artificial means, among the over 40 species of
waterfowl successfully incubated by him in machines of his own design.
Temperatures taken between mother and eggs of a wild Eider Duck in
Spitsbergen varied between 103* and 103 7*F, but must, of course, have
been much lower at the centre of the eggs. There and elsewhere the Eider
does not leave the nest during incubation, so the eggs are not cooled. The
author does not mention actual daily cooling, previously considered
important, but does stress the need for good ventilation--and very
frequent turning of the eggs.
A list of the I.A.T.A. regulations for the conveyance of live birds by
air, some book reviews and a list of new members and supporters of the
Association are included.
At the end of the report "Priorities and Progress" is a list of the Associa-
tion's projects and this gives some inkling of the magnitude of the work
needing to be done. That the Department of Leisure Services of an

The Pink-headed Duck once kept in the Berlin Zoo
In the Avicultural Magazine of 1974 Mr Prestwich gives a report on
the Pink-headed Duck in the wild and in captivity. In his article he also
mentions a stuffed specimen of Rhodonessa in the Zoological Museum of
the Berlin University, marked ''Died in the Zoo, Berlin, 1908". According
to the animal inventory of the Berlin Zoo, a drake of the Pink-headed
Duck, having been bought from the dealer Hagenbeck at a price of
Deutschmarks 250,-, arrived on May 2nd, 1907, but gave only a short
"starring" at the Zoo, as it died in August of the following year. This duck,
the only specimen of Rhodonessa the Berlin Zoo ever possessed, is men-
tioned twice in German publications. Director Ludwig Heck was well
aware of the avian jewel he had acquired, but was obviously a little dis-
appointed of the generally drab appearance of the bird. In an article pub-
lished in the illustrierte zeitung of 1907 and dealing with rare waterbirds
in the Berlin Zoo he writes: "The harmonious name of "Rose-headed
Duck" (as this species is called in German) must evoke in the reader the
most poetical ideas of its beauty, and really the short plumage of its head
and neck shows a nice soft rosy colour. But otherwise it is so monotonously
dark-brown coloured, and its whole shape with the big broad and flat
bill and its posture are so little elegant and appealing that according to its
appearance nobody would consider it to be a beautiful bird. But certainly
it is a great rarity among the 'web-footed bird ware' in the animal market,
and whenever it was offered in former times by an English dealer, then
at a rate which must be called enormous for such a bird. Now I succeeded
in getting the first specimen at a reasonable price". An excellent black and
white painting by Paul Neumann, an artist having often worked for the
Berlin Zoo, illustrates Heck's article.
Dr Oskar Heinroth, Head Assistant of the Berlin Zoo from 1904 to
1912 and especially interested in the behaviour of Anatinae, notes the
following on the Pink-headed Duck in his Beitrage zur Biologie,
namentlich Ethologie und Psychologie der Anatiden: "Of Rhodonessa

only a single drake was known to me. But as it was kept in a small aviary,
there was hardly anything to observe of the behaviour of this species. Its
figure gave me the impression that it is a true duck, and I could not
ascertain any relationship to Sarkidiornis , Cairina or Flectropterus. A
call it uttered angrily when somebody came too near consisted of a number
of weak high-pitched whistling notes".

Since at least 1973 (apparently no proper inventories were made before
that year) the Houston Zoological Gardens has maintained two Blue-
bearded Bee-eaters Nyctyornis athertoni in an indoor planted aviary. The
staff was aware that the irides of the individuals were of different colours:
dark brown in one, golden-yellow in the other, and we believed this might
be an indication of sex in the otherwise monomorphic birds. Indeed a
courtship ritual was often observed during the winter months and some
half-hearted tunnelling attempts were usually made at this time, but
although we went to some trouble to provide them with appropriate sites,
the birds continued to disappoint us. This summer, as we were about to
commence work on another earthen bank for their use, the golden-eyed
unexpectedly succumbed, apparently to a liver tumor and, when
necropsied, was found to be a female. As the initiator in the courtship
ritual was usually the dark-eyed bird, the necropsy results were not
surprising, but I find no reference in literature to eye colour in Nyctyornis
as a sexual indicator, and pass along the information in hope that another
member may offer confirmation or contradiction, or use it as a guide in
pairing members of this species.
The courtship ritual mentioned occurred when the birds were fed hand-
tossed crickets (a daily practice). The dark-eyed bird, in possession of an
insect, would fly to the perch of the other bird and, landing about a foot
away, utter a "churring" noise, at the same time bowing and fanning the
extended tail. This repeated movement would induce the golden-eyed
to join in, alternating "churrs," bows and fans with the first. After perhaps
a minute, the initiating bird would stop the display by consuming the
cricket. Never did I see an exchange of food between them. Any further
information on the ethology of this genus would be welcome.

The late E. B. Tanner
Members will be saddened to learn of the death of Mr E. B. Tanner,
b.e.m., who died in his 87th year. Ted joined the staff at London Zoo in
1908, a time when many visitors to the gardens still arrived by horse and
carriage. Dismayed at receiving just 12s 6d, instead of the expected 17s 6d
a week (for working from 6 am to 9 pm, with two early nights off each week
when he left at 6 pm, and, one day off a month), he contemplated seeking
another occupation. Fortunately, the pay was rectified and thereafter
prospered a long and fruitful association with birds and the Zoo. In 1946,
he became Head Keeper of the Bird House. The same year he was sent to
Ghana (then the Gold Coast) and returned with a large variety of birds
and other creatures, which helped to restock the war-depleted Zoo collec-
tion. In 1947 came promotion to the post of Overseer of Birds. After 47
years, in 1956, he retired and was awarded the Zoological Society's
Bronze Medal for "Long and Devoted Service". On retirement, there was
no waning of his keen interest in birds and the Zoo. His knowledge,
advice and rich store of reminiscences and anecdotes will be sadly missed.
He became a member of the Avicultural Society in 1957.

Musophaga rossae
By Malcolm Ellis (Holloway* London)
Bannerman (1953)* indulging what in his works can seem a liking for
long, unwieldy common names, uses for Musophaga rossae , the name--
Lady Ross's Violet Plantain-eater. Several authors use for it the shorter
names. Lady Ross's Plantain-eater, or, just Ross's, or the Violet Plantain-
eater. In spite of a wide use of the name plantain-eater, there is no proof
that, in the wild, these birds do indeed feed from the banana-like plantain.
Some authors attempt to justify the use of this name on the grounds that
it is a convenient means to separate, this and the only other Musophaga
species (the Violet or Violaceous M. violacea) from the 10 or so species of
the genus Tauraco s all whom possess predominantly green plumage, but
otherwise are not markedly different from them. Benson, Brooke, Dowsett,
Irwin (1973), choose to call it Ross's Violet Loerie: loerie, or lourie, in
southern Africa, of course, is a commonly used name for members of the
turaco (Musophagidae) family. Yet another name used for this bird is
Lady Ross's Touraco. The most widely used name though, the one I
prefer, and choose to use here, is--Ross's Turaco (I also prefer to spell
die common name as I have, though, of course, it can be spelt as touraco,
or more rarely, touracou).
Although known by an assortment of names, there is no mistaking this
striking-looking species. Ross's Turaco, compared to the other Musophaga
and Tauraco species, is a litde larger; it measures in length about 20 inches
(51 cm). Its plumage is almost entirely glossy blue-black and violet, the
main exceptions are the largely crimson flight feathers and fairly short,
hair-like, crimson crest; the latter can be held flat against the head, or
raised. Stout and arched, and with the slit-shaped nostrils near to the tip,
the bill extends above the forehead, where it develops a pronounced
shield or casque. The bill and casque are orange-yellow, frequently
shading to red at the base of the lower mandible and tip of the casque.
Adjoining the bill and casque, and surrounding the dark-coloured eyes*

is an area of bare yellow skin. The fairly long and slender legs and toes are
shiny black; the needle-sharp claws are the same colour. Characteristic of
the family, the outer toe can either be directed forward, held at a right
angle to the &quot;middle 5 or longest toe, or held some way back.
The male and female Ross's Turaco are usually described as being
alike in appearance. However, Newton R. Steel (1973), who was awarded
an Avicultural Society's medal for the first breeding of this species in
Britain, in his account, states---"the difference between the male and
female is that in the male, the casque, or wattle, is very slightly concave
and when really fit has a little red mark in the centre, whilst that of the
female is convex (i.e. Roman-nosed) and has no red marking". I would
like to have more examples of this difference before I am convinced it is
general; and would suggest it be merely regarded as an indication, rather
than an infallible guide.
Bamierman notes that, in the north of what was French Cameroun, the
turacos possess a rather brighter lighter crimson crest and are of the race
M. r. savannicola; a distinction that now seems to be regarded as question-
able. The species' full range embraces, Cameroun, Congo (Zaire), Sudan,
Uganda, Kenya, Tanzania, Zambia and Angola.
Ross's Turaco I know best from the times I have spent with Tim and
Jane Barnley and their family in Kenya. It is confined to the western part
of that country and is not uncommon where they live at around 6,500 feet
(1,981 m) in the Cherengani Hills, close to the town of Kitale, and not
far from Mt. Elgon, which is bisected by the border with Uganda. These
turacos are often to be seen in pairs or small parties in forest, and par-
ticularly tall trees bordering water-courses; they also occur on wooded
farmland. The Barnleys are extremely fortunate to occasionally have
these beautiful birds visit their garden. I can recall, once, while having
breakfast, glancing out of the window and seeing two fly to a fig tree
there. The turacos are noisy and often draw attention to their presence by
their loud calling. Like other turacos, Ross's are most agile, and delight in
running the length of long horizontal branches. It is only when they fly--
and then just in a series of brief flashes--that the spectacle of their
brilliant flight feathers can be fully appreciated.
Adult Ross's Turacos can, with a good deal of difficulty, be caught by
mist-nets. However, this is not entirely satisfactory, besides which it is a
lengthy process to settle them down to aviary life. Ideally, they need to be
collected as nestlings and then be hand-reared. This is something which,
over several years, Tim and Jane Barnley have become specialists at, so
much so, that they are the source of most Ross's (and White-crested
Turacos T. leucolophus) living in zoos and other collections.
According to Mackworth-Praed and Grant (i960), Ross's Turaco has
been recorded breeding in October and from February to May in Uganda,
and in November on Mt. Elgon. Last year, while I was with the Barnleys,
several nestlings were collected during June and July; nestlings are also

obtained during some other months of the year. Two to a brood is most
usual, though a single bird is not uncommon.
Most of them are collected while still at a fairly early age--often when
they are little more than a small ball of black down; at this stage, the bill
is shiny black, and what bare skin there is about the face is dark. Such
nestlings quickly settle down and will soon accept food offered from the
tip of a teaspoon. They possess voracious appetites and remarkably
quickly learn to take food from a dish. They are quick to develop, and as
the wing and tail feathers grow, these get a blue sheen. Soon there appears
the beginnings of the crest, then the crimson of the flight feathers; at this
stage, the birds usually begin to perch. Next, the bill, which has yet to
develop its characteristic casque, and what has become a distinct area of
bare skin around the eyes, slowly begin to change to a dull shade of
yellow. After this, for a while, the juveniles resemble a duller version of
an adult.
To give an idea of the time taken by nestlings to grow--the second
photograph was taken on 4th August, 30 days after the subject of it had
been collected as a small nestling of an undetermined age. The bird is not
yet at what might be termed the full juvenile stage, but had just, albeit
rather weakly, begun to fly.
The only fruit regularly available is banana and paw-paw, and these
form the basis of the diet. They are mashed or diced and mixed with
chopped greenfood, mashed or chopped hard-boiled egg and a home
made softbill food. Added to this is powdered calcium and a multi-
vitamin additive. The food must be carefully doctored, as bitter or other
unpleasant tastes easily put off the birds.
I have probably given the impression that rearing turacos is without
problems: this is not entirely so. During the growing period, they are
susceptible to chills, which can lead to bad respiratory trouble. Because
of this, during the early stages, nestlings are housed indoors, where there
is a fire at night; then as they grow, are, during sunny days, slowly
acclimatised to outdoor conditions, before, when well grown, being
introduced into aviaries. Another danger which must be guarded against
is the vulnerability of their fairly long and slender legs. The development
of these must be closely watched and the birds' housing must not have
any way these might get trapped. Also, special care must be taken when
the birds are handled, e.g. when their housing is being cleaned and when,
as is necessary, their bill and nostrils, face and plumage are cleaned of
food which has adhered.
These measures are really nothing more than sensible husbandry, and
are little when compared to the wonderful results: turacos, which are
from an early age hand-reared, become splendid aviary inhabitants;
single birds grow up to be specially tame. Turacos which arrive when
already well feathered, take a while to settle and seldom become so
confiding.

BREEDING GOFFIN'S COCKATOO
Cacatua goffini
By Neil O'Connor (Coulsdon, Surrey)
Goffin's Cockatoo is indigenous to the Tanimbar Islands in south-
</figure>
<bodyText confidence="0.963119956521739" page_id="56386542"  page_num="182" year="" vol="">
eastern Indonesia. This group of small islands is sparsely populated and
covers an area of 2,172 square miles, marginally larger than the county
of Norfolk. Although rare in British collections until about six years ago,
very considerable numbers of this small cockatoo have been imported in
the intervening period and it is now readily available and is the least
expensive of the cockatoos. Considering the very small extent of its
native range and the evidently unrestricted trapping which has been
carried out in recent years, it is difficult to imagine that, should trapping
be sustained at its present rate, serious depletion in the wild will not
occur.
The cock was acquired in October 1972, followed by the hen in April
1973. They were kept in adjoining cages until May when they were
housed together in a 3-foot cage until being transferred to an outdoor
flight in June, 1974 next to another pair of Goffin's. The birds were
ecstatic on meeting each other and vigorous mutual preening immediately
commenced; although the birds were not fully mature, pairing was
observed the same day. j
The aviary in which the birds are housed is quite small, being only
9x3x6 feet. It has an open-fronted shelter wherein the nest box measuring ;
22 x 15 x 11 inches is hung. The birds settled down immediately in their
outdoor quarters and pairing was frequently observed. With regard to
pairing, the birds are quite versatile and do not adhere solely to the normal
practice of the cock mounting the hen. A method frequently indulged is

both birds remain on the perch facing opposite directions and back on to
each other with tails raised and appear to perform the function in this
manner. Another variation involves the cock gripping the perch with one
foot and the wire side of the aviary with the other adopting an upside
down posture with the vent on the same level as the perch; the hen
remains on the perch and positions herself in a suitable manner to complete
the copulatory process. Mutual preening of the ventral area is common-
place. As is the case with most, if not all, cockatoos, pairing is not confined
to the breeding season and the birds have frequently been observed
pairing on frost-laden perches on freezing mornings in winter, nor did
the practice discontinue completely whilst the young bird was in the nest.
The birds first started entering the nest box in April 1976, but apart
from giving it some unwelcome attention which necessitated repairs,
nothing of interest happened during that year. Whilst the nest box is
covered with welded mesh both inside and outside, occasional minor
repairs are necessary, as the birds are adept at removing the staples which
hold the wire in position.
In April this year the birds were again visiting the box and some of the
peat filling was ejected. On 16th May, the hen roosted in the box for the
first time and inspection two days later revealed one egg.
Considerable commotion was heard late at night on 24th May from
the Goffin's aviary and a cat was found on top of the flight. The creature
remained in situ and appropriate impact was made resulting in dis-
appearance with almost Cheetah-like rapidity. The birds forsook the
nest, but on 2nd June normal incubation recommenced and inspection on
</bodyText>
<footnote confidence="0.807258666666667">
14th June revealed three eggs. At this point it was not known when the
second and third eggs were laid, but it was considered probable that they
were a second clutch laid on 2nd June and later. Careful listening on
2nd July indicated the presence of young, and inspection on 4th July
revealed one chick with quite a lot of primrose-coloured down. On
8th July there was still only one young and the two remaining eggs were
</footnote>
<bodyText confidence="0.986393928571428" page_id="56386543"  page_num="183" year="" vol="">
removed. One egg held a partly developed chick--no doubt this was the
egg laid on 16th May--the second contained a fully developed dead chick.
On arrival of the chick both adult birds became extremely agitated
whenever the aviary was approached; the hen invariably emerged from
the box and screeched incessantly until the onlooker departed.
Since the birds are very nervous and wild, inspection and interference
was kept to a minimum with the result that considerable quantities of
sunflower seed, buckwheat and canary seed grew several inches tall in
the flight and this disappeared rapidly soon after the young bird was
hatched.
On the 23rd August both birds were roosting in the flight; subsequent
late night inspection showed that this was a nightly occurrence, but it is
not known when it commenced. In fact, since the young was about one
month old, the parents spent practically all the day out of the nest.

seemingly only entering the box to feed the chick.
At 80 days old, on 20th September, the chick was seen peeping out of
the box for the first time and three days later it was found on the floor.
Clearly, not ready for emergence, it was returned to the nest where it
remained for another six days, when it re-emerged on 29th September
and was seen perched in the flight. It was badly feather-plucked on the
head, neck, back and breast and not much larger than a Senegal Parrot.
It roosted on top of the nest box that night but generally roosted in the
flight subsequently, causing much concern, as some nights have been
chilly and damp and now, in late October, it is still sparse of feather
but is growing rapidly.
The young bird was probably about 16 weeks old before it became
fully independent but it is not possible to be precise on this point. Now
17 weeks old (1st November) it is still with its parents who adore it and,
judging from the manner it cuddles up to them, that sentiment would
appear to be reciprocated.
The food consists mainly of soaked sunflower seed and a mixture
containing 50% Mazagan canary seed, the balance comprising buck-
wheat, wheat, oats and maize. Bread and milk and corn on the cob were
offered on several occasions, but declined; carrot is eaten in small
quantities. Greens they love and spinach beet was fed daily until the
crop failed by going to seed in August. The dandelion crop did not fail
and this was given subsequently and taken with much avidity.
The young bird adjourns to the nest box each day in the early afternoon
for a couple of hours and has partaken of this siesta daily since first
leaving the box.
As described, Goffin's Cockatoo Cacatua goffini has been bred by Mr.
Neil O'Connor and this is believed to be the first success with this species
in the British Isles, but anyone knowing of a previous breeding in Great
Britain or Northern Ireland is requested to inform the Hon. Secretary.

By E. Cowley (Misterton, Doncaster)
Six Sand Martin pulli Riparia riparia were hand-reared to fledging,
and notes were kept on the food given, times of feeding, wing growth rate
and behaviour. The birds were kept in a nest box constructed to resemble
a normal nest chamber and for most of the period they were quite un-
restricted.
Food
The food was not measured by weight or volume, but of 113 feeds, 98
(867 per cent) were of maggots, the larvae of the bluebottle fly Calliphore
vomitoria, nine (7-9 per cent) of bread and six (53 per cent) of earthworms
Qligochaeta. Of these types of food, maggots (always split open before
feeding) were eagerly accepted; bread (only given when other foods were
not available) was accepted but was difficult to swallow and earthworms
were not readily accepted. Ejected food left the gape at great speed and
for some distance without any movement of the gaping bill.
The birds were fed from five to eight times a day and the maximum
number of maggots given at one feed was 140, these being large ones up
to 20 mm. long. There were six nestlings at this time, 23.15 hours on the
ninth day (they had not been fed since 19.00 hours), and the feeding lasted
20 minutes. The birds were normally fed one parcel of food each (con-
sisting of six maggots) more or less in turn, until all had stopped soliciting.
The nestlings were normally kept in artificial light in the evening to
encourage them to feed later, and they ate very well at 23.45 hours on two
occasions; possibly because of this, although the first feed in the morning
was given several hours after dawn, it was normally not a good one. Once
the birds had settled for the night, they did not solicit for food on being
disturbed in artificial light.
Their longest period without food was from 19.00 hours on the 13th
day to 09.15 hours the next day. On the second day at 23.30 hours when
bird 0 had not been fed for 6i hours, it felt quite cold in the hand and
yet survived after forced feeding. At this time it was not strong enough to
solicit for food even when this was moved alongside the gape.
Requirement of external warmth
Bird o showed on the first night that it was able to survive without the
equivalent warmth of parental brooding. It was not strong enough to get
to the centre of the group (all the pulli strived for this position at this time)
and so spent the night on the outside edge, all of them being kept on a
newspaper on the bottom of a plastic bucket, with another newspaper
placed across the top. The bucket itself was placed on a quarry tile floor
in an unheated room. Bird o was almost naked at this time and 18 days
from fledging.

representation of the average daily growth of all the birds shows a fairly
even outline. Day 4 of wing measurements reflects a day of poor food
supply (mainly of earthworms) in five cases, and yet on this day Bird 7
showed above average growth for itself.
The mean growth to fledging is shown in Fig. 1. As the actual age of
the birds when first measured is not known, this is shown on the basis of
days to fledging.
The wing growth of two pulli fed naturally is also given in Fig. 1 to
show how the artificially reared ones compared. The smallest juvenile
fledged in the area (north Nottinghamshire) and known to have survived
to the following breeding season (from ringing operations and including the
years when the post-moult wing length of the local population decreased
following the 1969 crash in the population level (Cowley, in prep.)) was
one with a wing length of 82 mm. fledged in July 1974, but the majority of
known successful juveniles (97 per cent) have fledged with wings of 93 mm.
or above.
Behaviour
Rest was normally taken with the pullus squatting down, head held well
back and the whole bird facing the entrance, but towards the end of the
period one of them changed to sleeping with its head tucked in its shoulder
feathers.
When a nestling was gorged, its head would lie in the nest in any posi-
tion, and at times, hang out of the entrance hole as if it were dead.
All the pulli observed normal nest sanitation, some making strenuous
efforts to get to the opening for this purpose. Bird o would always go to
the back of the nest after this action, even though feeding was normally
continuing at this time.
The faecal sacs were quite normal and stayed intact when removed with
the feeding tweezers, apart from half-way through the period when some
did break down for a while, having too much liquid.
Although the pulli would generally crouch down in the nest when I
approached, they had only to see my hand, the tweezers, or my hand and
the tweezers for soliciting to start. At times, one of the smaller ones would
solicit on seeing me approach and this would set the others off, but,
especially as they grew older, their immediate reaction to humans was to
crouch in the nest. They would solicit each other for food, as well as
preening and pecking each other at times.
A hand placed over the entrance, darkening the nest as would the arrival
of an adult bird, immediately caused soliciting, but as each pullus neared
fledging it became secretive, and one of them stopped soliciting for food,
although it would eat after enticement.
Preparation for flight
The pulli flapped their wings vigorously as they prepared for flight.

<bodyText confidence="0.989014576923077" page_id="56386548"  page_num="188" year="" vol="">
They normally did this when hidden in the nest box, but on three occasions
I watched them and after the flapping the pullus held its body off the
nest by pressing its wings down on the nest platform and holding them
there, its wings forming an angle of about 120 degrees. This action was
taken after each bout of wing-flapping which I saw, and though the tail
touched the nest, I could not see whether it was actually being used to
help hold the body off from it. When I first saw this attitude I thought
the bird had adopted it to keep cool, but this was not so, and when each
bird flew it was able to maintain an even height.
The birds were kept in the open during the day, but when Bird 6 flew
from the nest box on the tenth day and did not return I confined the others,
apart from when they were placed at a Sand Martin colony, to give them a
greater chance of survival. Birds 7 and 8 left on the fourteenth day after
being held in the air with others about, but the three smallest ones would
not leave at this time, even when held in the air. On the eighteenth day
the nest box was placed in the middle of a colony and the three remaining
birds left separately, the last one about one hour after the box was placed.
Summary
Six Sand Martins were hand-reared to fledging from a few days old,
and a brood reared under natural conditions was weighed and measured
most days until fledging.
The artificially reared birds were fed five to eight times a day and their
diet was mainly maggots; earthworms were not readily accepted and bread,
though accepted, was difficult to swallow.
The artificially reared birds showed a quite erratic wing growth rate
but all flew strongly on fledging.

THE FIRST BRITISH BREEDING OF TWO LORY SPECIES?
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.997762833333333" page_id="56386549"  page_num="189" year="" vol="">
By Clifford K. Wright (West Ealing, London)
A pair of the Violet-necked Lory Eos squamata obtained in 1974
seemed, until this year, to be of the same sex, though one had a more
pronounced bulge on its forehead than the other. In February of this
year, however, a fertile egg was found in the nest box, but it failed to
hatch. Then on May 23rd and on the 26th, a clutch of two eggs was laid
and on June 19th a chick was hatched, the second hatching on the 21st.
Both were covered in white down and had black beaks and dark coloured
legs.
By the end of June both had their eyes open and by July 14th red pin
feathers were showing on the heads of the chicks, both of which, by
July 25th, were fully feathered and they left the nest on August 22nd and
24th.
These birds were bred in an aviary measuring 6x6x3 feet with a nest
box 9x9 inches inside measurement and 2 feet deep. The diet consisted
of fruit, sunflower seed and a liquid mixture of Complan, Ostermilk,
Farex, Farlene, rice (as prepared for infants), glucose, and honey. In
addition, while the young were in the nest, the parents were provided
with cows' milk sweetened with honey.
The young birds have little of the violet collar, but have ear patches of a
brownish-violet tinge. The flight and tail feathers have a metallic brownish
tinge and the breast feathers are of a scaled or scalloped pattern: the beak
is blackish and the irides brown. The parent birds were not distressed
when I went into the aviary and looked into the nest.
A pair of Black-winged Lories Eos cyanogenia nested last year and
raised two young, but at about two weeks after leaving the nest, both
young ones died. This year eggs were laid on May 2nd and 5th, one
chick hatching on May 31st, and this left the nest on August 26th, 87
days from hatching whereas last year the two left at 75 days old. Like the
Violet-necked, the chick at an early age is covered with white down and
at about 40 days, coloured pin feathers began to show. When it left the
nest, this young one was found to be plucked on the back of the head and
neck, like last year's young. The juveniles are very like the adults in
plumage, but have a blackish beak and a lot of black flecking on the back
of the head, forehead and chest.
The aviary and nest box were similar to those already described in
which the Violet-necked bred, but unlike them, the Black-winged were
very protective and would attack viciously if the nest was approached.
I submit that these two breeding successes are the first in the British
Isles and perhaps in the case of the Black-winged, the first captive
breeding anywhere.

By Peter Brown (Harewood, Leeds)
I am sure that one of the highlights of the British avicultural year in
1977 must be the incredible success which Mr. and Mrs. Geoffrey Dean
of Haughton Hall, Tarporley, Cheshire, have achieved in breeding no less
than seven Stanley Cranes from one pair. There is little doubt to my
mind that devotion to their birds and meticulous attention to detail have
been the hallmark of their success.
The Stanley, Blue or Paradise Crane is considered by many to be the
finest of this family of tall, stately, long-legged, long-necked birds. It is
quite unsurpassed in its grace, stately carriage and sleek lines with trailing
secondary wing feathers. In colour it is steel-grey with a buffle head
topped by a white cap, the primaries being black. It is almost always an
unafraid bird and will usually stand close examination without becoming
alarmed.
Standing about 5 feet tall, it is native to the southern part of Africa
where the preferred habitat is open dry country. It is found in southern
Rhodesia, Botswana and the Drakensberg area of South Africa and is, in
fact, the national bird of South Africa, being depicted on their 25 cent
stamp.
Mr. Dean has long been an admirer of the Stanley Crane and indeed
each year when he popped in to the Harewood Bird Garden, on his way
to the grouse moor, used to spend much of his time with the Stanley
Cranes and tried in vain to persuade me to part with a pair of them. These
cranes are very seldom offered for sale; however, in September of 1975,
a pair were advertised in London which he managed to secure and so he
returned to Haughton Hall, with a fine pair of Stanley Cranes on the back
seat of his car. They were given the freedom of a paddock of ii acres of
open grassland with two large ponds on which a variety of ducks and two
pairs of geese lived. Mr. Dean has observed that the cranes spend a
considerable amount of time wading around in the water, but do not
roost in it. They settled well into their new quarters, which are surrounded
by banks on two sides and trees on the others, giving the birds solitude
and shelter from the wind. They were also provided with a large wooden
shelter into which they can be shut during the winter or whenever the
weather is severe.

The pair settled down extremely well and during their first full year,
although there was a good deal of displaying with the male doing a lot of
dancing and stopping with his wings arched over his back, no attempt at
nesting was made.
In 1977, there was again courtship activity with much dancing, and on
May 10th the first egg was laid on open ground with no attempt at any
nest preparations as is typical with this species. The egg was laid quite
close to one of the ponds, no more than three feet from the water's edge.
Subsequent rounds of eggs were laid in a variety of situations, usually
quite near water, but on one occasion well away from it. The egg is large
and elongated with a creamy background coloration and long streaky
blotches of reddish-brown over the entire egg surface. Two days later, the
second egg of the clutch was laid and both eggs were removed from the
nest and placed under a broody bantam. After one week the eggs were
separated so each was being incubated by a broody on its own. The eggs
were turned daily during the 15 minutes which the bantams were off the
nest and the opportunity was then taken to dampen them with a light
spray. Incubation lasted a surprisingly short time for such a large bird
and after 26 days the j^oung could be heard peeping inside the eggs 24
hours before hatching.
Both eggs hatched later that day. After two or three days the chicks
stand very erect on their long legs and are alert and active. The overall
colouring is tawny grey with a reddish head. After drying, both chicks
plus their foster parents were transferred to rearing pens some 4 feet
long and 2 feet v/ide by 3 feet high. These were made of plywood and
were divided into two by a wire mesh partition so that each chick could
see the other but they could not come into direct contact. Unfortunately
on the second day one of the bantams was too heavy for the chick and it
was found squashed dead. Feeling this sort of thing could happen again,
Mr. Dean resolved that in future he would take the chicks away from the
bantams after they had hatched and were dry and rear them under
artificial light and heat, with a pullet of the same age for company. This
practice has worked very well with subsequent chicks. He also found out
very quickly that young chicks will not live amicably together. They
constantly battle with each other and if left together one would surely be
killed. This is probably why in the wild, more than one youngster is
seldom reared. By keeping the chicks apart from the very start, both have
been reared from the same clutch of eggs. After 17 days they were able
to be together, having stopped trying to fight.
In the rearing box, the 250 w. infra-red light is placed at 2 feet above
ground for the first four days and thereafter is raised to 3 feet 6 inches.
Most of the chicks will feed readily on the second day after birth and the
starting diet is raw minced beef rolled in turkey starter crumbs with a
drop of Abidec multi-vitamin mixture on the food from the third day.
Small crickets or locusts are also caught and eaten with relish right from

the start. The chicks are fed only from the hand for the first five days and
will not take any food from the ground; however, by the fifth day, by
tapping on the ground, it is usually possible to get them to feed from a
dish and once they will do this they are never hand-fed again. They are
also given finely chopped lettuce for the first two weeks. After six weeks the
raw minced beef is discontinued and they are then fed on just wheat and
turkey rearing pellets.
Mr. and Mrs. Dean are quite convinced that, apart from the correct
housing conditions and feeding, of paramount importance is exercise and
they believe that if and when other people experience leg problems with
young cranes, it is due to the lack of exercise rather than a deficiency.
With this in mind, after the first week the chicks are taken out several
times a day for a walk. The chicks are pinioned at one week old and by
the second week, they are then large enough to be moved from the small
pen into larger, stable sections, with a sand floor and heat provided as
before with an infra-red light. At five weeks of age feathers are sprouting
through and in subsequent weeks the buff down recedes as the feathers
grow. The last to go altogether is the reddish down on the head. When I
saw these birds, the eldest was just twelve weeks old and he had lost the
last of his head down that very week.
As I write this, just after my visit in early September, there are seven
chicks varying in age from 12 weeks, the eldest, down to the last two to
hatch at just seven and five days old. All the birds looked in excellent
health and it was a real pleasure to see Mr. and Mrs. Dean strolling
around the grounds being pursued and sometimes preceded by their
family of young Stanley Cranes.
Details of this notable success are to be found in the table.

By Carl Naether (Encino, California)
On several unforgettable occasions, I have had the privilege and the
keen pleasure of seeing at fairly close range the behaviour of sizeable
flocks of our American Goldfinch Spinus or Carduelis tristis. In daily need
of fresh seeds for our aviary finches, a friend and I had discovered a country
hillside bursting with golden sunflowers, popularly and quite suitably
also called brown-eyed Susans. It was midsummer and their seeds were
in various stages of ripening. Approaching the radiant field of bright
yellow flowers nodding gently in the cooling afternoon breeze, we soon
discovered that we were not the only ones looking for avian sustenance.
Hanging and turning on numerous flower-heads were goldfinches galore,
plucking the tiny ripening seeds neatly from their beds, all the while
tittering cheerfully "Ferchic-ichic-perchic".
So assiduously occupied with their busy feeding were these sprightly
wild goldfinches that they did not suddenly shy away from us intruders,
but cheerfully and very industriously continued their important labours
at but a very short distance from us. Meanwhile, my friend and I con-
tinued to probe the heads of the sunflowers for neither too soft nor too
hard, but "milky" seeds, snipping them off in stem-lengths of six inches,
then binding them in handy little bundles to be later hung at accessible
places and heights in our aviaries for all our seedeaters. Needless to say,
these seeds provided a most nourishing, natural, and very welcome dietary
treat for these birds, well worth the time and little trouble of harvesting
them.
Another memorable opportunity to enjoy the cheerful presence of the
beautiful American Goldfinch came in the fall of the year, in September,
when the thermometer climbed day after day up to 90*F, and often beyond,
in that desert region. My bird-loving friend made his modest home in the
hilly chaparral country, far and safely removed from the thunder of
airplanes and the stench of auto exhausts--where in peace and quietude
he could relish the invigorating, spicy air of the desert. For miles around
there was no flowing creek, or even a water-hole, only dry, bone-dry,
grey-green shrub, dust-laden, and low, parched trees thirsting for life-
giving water--longing for the invigorating winter rains. But despite the
awful heat and drought, there was abundant bird life in this lonely
chaparral, with hundreds of goldfinches attracted by my friend's bubbling
drinking fountains near his home. In a colourful stream, running from still
dark, early morning until approaching dusk, day after day, these lively
little beauties descended on the water-dishes, eagerly dipping their
black-tipped, orange bills time and again into the refreshing moisture,
warbling the while not unlike some caged canaries. Quickly many of them

vacated their posts to make room for many, many others that were eagerly
waiting. All these birds came from nearby oak trees, and especially from
telegraph wires, which they lined in coundess numbers. At the fountains
they were at times joined by Lawrence's Goldfinches Spinus or Carduelis
lawrencei , the males adorned widi the distinctive black throats and chins
in an overall plumage colour of neutral grey. What an exciting adventure
this avian congregation proved for us--the incessant, swift comings and
goings of these delightful little finches with their lively twitter, exuding
no end of cheer and happiness, both for themselves and for us onlookers.
Their music was thoroughly natural--an artless medley of ecstatic warb-
lings, with no imitations, as Spinus psaltria and Spinus lawrencei are wont
to use. Their wave-like flight was marked by a simple "tee-didi" at each
dip.
The excellent portrayal of the nesting pair in the accompanying photo-
graphic illustration was made by my friend, Hugh M. Halliday. It pictures
the male arriving with food for his brooding mate, and it makes it hardly
needful for me to describe their plumage colour in detail. Suffice it to
say that Spinus tristis , often called "Yellow Bird" and "Wild Canary",
is yellow all over, except for a jet-black cap, wings, and tail. The bright,
lemon-yellow back sets this species apart from other goldfinches. The
female is readily recognized by her dull olive plumage and blackish wings:
she lacks the black cap. In fall and winter the male dress is much more
modest, the shining, handsome yellow having changed to a brownish,
dull olive-green. Young goldfinches resemble their elders in their fall
and winter plumage colour, but show more yellow tinges below.
Spinus tristis , called also "Thistle Bird" and "Catnip Bird", ranges from
Canada south to Colorado, Nevada, and southern California. At times it
winters in these habitats; at other times it will migrate to warm regions of
Mexico. It is mainly at home in open country, scattered with trees, but
also in farming regions, gardens and parks planted with trees. There it
nests at moderate heights in trees and at low levels, even in weeds. For
building materials it utilizes grass, willow down, moss, rootlets, dry leaves
and flower heads, often lining the nest with brown pappus. Four, five, or
six bluish-green eggs constitute the usual clutch, which is incubated by
the female for approximately 14 days. The young goldfinches leave their
nest at the age of two weeks. While in the nest, they are fed mostly on
live insects, including flies, caterpillars and bugs. Later on, the seeds of
the sunflower, lettuce, turnip, and, most of all, of the thistle, are their
staple diet. It is the bird's preference for the last mentioned seed that has
earned the name of "Thistle Finch". It consumes also many weed seeds,
such as those of tarweed, groundsel, alfilaria, and many others, which
habit makes it a very useful bird. Incidentally, the American Goldfinch
will mate with the Canary, but rarely produces fertile eggs.

THE BREEDING AND MAINTENANCE
OF PINE GROSBEAKS IN CAPTIVITY

By Curtis S. Adkisson (Blacksburg, Virginia)
Although the willingness of Pine Grosbeaks Pinicola enucleator to
breed in captivity is well established (St. Quintin, 1906; Dost, 1969),
they have been seldom kept in recent decades. Bernhoft-Osa (i960, 1969),
however, published his observations of the breeding of a pair obtained in
Norway, and the apparent hybridisation of a female Pine Grosbeak and a
male Two-barred Crossbill Loxia leucoptera. The general inaccessibility of
Pine Grosbeaks at all seasons outside of Fennoscandia and the Soviet
Union, coupled with their reduced desirability due to the loss of red
pigment in captives, have perhaps combined to make these birds nearly
unknown among European aviculturists. There are apparently no reports
of the captive breeding of the North American forms of this species.
My own observations of captive North American Pine Grosbeaks stem
from studies of vocal behaviour conducted at the University of Michigan
and this institution (Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State University)
over the past eight years. I herewith report some observations in agree-
ment with those of past authors, and some altogether new observations on
the care and breeding of Pine Grosbeaks.
Several times between 1968 and the present I have obtained wild birds
from the field in New Hampshire and Michigan in winter, and New-
foundland, California, and Colorado in summer. I have found, as reported
in the past, that these birds adjust readily to captivity, especially when
given plenty of space. New captives are maintained for a period in pairs
in 2 x 2 x 4 ft. cages indoors. A month or so later they can be transferred
to large (8 x 10 x 20 ft.) outdoor flights. New captives will begin within a
few hours to feed on small sunflower seeds, sooner if kept with an ex-
perienced captive. Only some weeks later will new birds begin to take
greens and apples, items which all my experienced captives readily take.
Pine Grosbeaks also readily eat proso millet, hemp (given when available)
and thistle, though sunflower seeds are preferred. As often reported,
many individuals become fat on ad libitum sunflower seed in the small
cages described above.
My birds have bred within 10 months of capture in large outdoor
flights. Typically, the females begin nest-building in late May, as reported
for European birds (Bemhoft-Osa, 1969). Males take no part in nest-
building. Copulation occurs frequently during the three to six days of
nest-building. The nest, a massive affair of coarse twigs lined with rootlets
and fine grasses, is built in a pile of evergreen boughs on a shelf or in
small pines or junipers placed in a corner of the aviary. Incubation of the
three or four eggs is by the female alone, and lasts 13 to 14 days, as

reported elsewhere. The age of fledging has varied from 15 to 18 days
after hatching, slightly longer than the 14 days Bernhoft-Osa and St.
Quintin reported. Usually four or five additional days are required before
the young begin to fly well about the aviary. In my experience, the young
are out of the nest three weeks before they feed themselves. Such a long
dependency period has never been reported for wild or captive Pine
Grosbeaks. Several of my juvenile birds began to pick at dry needles and
bark two weeks out of the nest, so they might be able to feed themselves
earlier, should death of the parents occur. The earliest data for bathing of
juveniles is 11 days after fledging.
In agreement with others, I have found it necessary to provide these
birds some protection from the hot summer sun. During the hottest
times my adults perch in the shade provided by a roof overhang at one
end of my flight cages, and otherwise seem to tolerate heat well. But
special care must be taken to prevent juveniles from perching in full sun.
One of mine died two days after fledging, apparently because it perched
unprotected during one of the hottest days of our 1976 summer ( ca .
95*F.). By the time I realised the trouble, it was too late. I had forgotten
Bernhoft-Osa's report of a nearly identical experience in Norway (1969).
Another problem, not mentioned elsewhere, is the extent to which
pairs interfere with each other when bred in side-by-side flights. Males
may fight through the wire for hours at a time, doing serious damage to
the plumage and skin of the head. Some females appear to fail to build a
nest because of frequent fighting (through the wire) with the neighbouring
female. I have found also that fertility of eggs is lower when neighbouring
pairs fight in this way. The solution is to breed Pine Grosbeaks in alternate
flights or to obstruct the view from cage to cage with some opaque
material. Greenhouse shade fabric is not enough; particularly aggressive
neighbouring males must not see each other. By using sturdy black
plastic between the flights I have seen egg fertility rise from less than 50%
to 100% in some pairs.
One extreme example of interference I did not expect to see occurred
when two females with 8-day and 4-day old nestlings, respectively, sparred
through the cage wire for over two hours late one day. That evening the
latter bird did not return to the nest. Only females brood in this species,
thus by morning the young were too chilled to gape when the male
offered them food, and shortly died. I cannot explain the fact that some
pairs interact aggressively, while others, in identical situations, do not. I
have seen little of the classical songbird territoriality in wild Pine Gros-
beaks, but on the other hand, I have never seen a strange bird approach a
nest unchallenged for long.

birds. Captive, non-breeding birds usually moult in late August and
September, at the same time for most wild grosbeaks. During moult my
birds readily eat eggshells and dogfood pellets (Gaines Meal, 20% crude
protein) softened in water, but seldom eat these foods at other times of
the year. Some fairly rich source of protein appears essential to the health
of captives during moult; individuals fed only on seeds may die apparently
of haemorrhage upon losing partly grown flight feathers.
I was initially unable to induce the males to maintain their red plumage
through moult. Birds fed only seeds became a dingy yellow; those given
ad libitum endive and Gaines meal (with supplementary mealworms)
became a bright, almost golden yellow. Then in 1970 I discovered a
dietary source that enabled the males to moult into a normal red plumage
in the fall. In that year I had three pairs breeding in aviaries at the
University of Michigan Botanical Gardens. When the young hatched I
began to sweep for insects in the fields nearby. The birds soon learned to
search through the resulting piles of plant debris for desirable insects, and
raised their young mainly on this source of protein. In fact they soon
recognised me and my net as the source of food and would wait by the
door to the flight, upon my appearance. These three males, yellow for
over two years, began to moult while still feeding their young on insects,
and the replacement feathers were red. So unexpected was this develop-
ment that at first I believed the birds to be bleeding about the head and
breast. Ultimately, these males attained red plumage indistinguishable
from that of wild birds. In later years several other males regained the red
plumage in this manner. These and other males kept in other years in
these flights, without supplementary insects, grew only yellow feathers.
These observations raise some interesting questions about the synthesis
of red pigments in cardueline finches. In early studies of pigments Volker
(1957) reported that crossbills grew red feathers when fed a pulp made of
yew (Taxus) berries, but admitted that the pigment incorporated was
not the same as in wild birds. And the observation that crossbills kept in
large outdoor aviaries grew normal red feathers on their heads led Weber
(1953) t0 suggest that exercise alone could induce normal pigment
synthesis. My own observations suggest that diet alone determines the
redness of colours in these cardueline finches, and that Weber's crossbills
obtained appropriate insects or plants in the outdoors without his being
aware of it.
Recently, Brush and Power (1976) discovered that House Finches
Carpodacus mexicanus can convert dietary Beta-carotene to echinone, the
normal red pigment in carduelines. And Brush (in litt.) confirmed for me
that this is the predominant red pigment of wild male Pine Grosbeaks.
He also found that a yellow pigment characteristic of most captives is
isocryptoxanthin (4-hydroxy-beta-carotene), a likely precursor of the red
echinone (4-keto-beta-carotene) which is absent in captives. Both of these
pigments are evidently converted in the bird from dietary carotenoids

found in plants.
It is not clear why the addition of wild insects to the diet enabled the
birds to synthesise red pigments again. But I suspect that the green insects
(preferred by the birds over brown ones) contained either quantities of
beta-carotene or one or more biochemical cofactors (enzymes) which
enabled the birds to convert isocryptoxanthin to echinone.
There may be still other explanations, but the significance of the fore-
going to aviculturists is that one may now expect to induce certain red
carduelines (e.g. Carpodacus , Pinicola, Loxia) to retain normal colour by
dusting their food with beta-carotene powder, as did Brush and Power,
or by feeding receptive birds with insects, as I have done.

EXPERIENCES WITH PARROT FINCHES
</sectionHeader>

By F. C. Barnicoat (Johannesburg, South Africa)
In South Africa, as in other parts of the world, the beauty and rarity
of parrot finches Erythrura spp. are legendary, and they have had a most
remarkable attraction for generations of wild bird enthusiasts. Exactly
why quite such an aura should surround them is difficult to pinpoint, but
their vivid, though simple, coloration makes them epitomise the exotic
wild bird in many people's minds; and their remote and limited ranges,
mostly on Pacific islands, apart from ensuring their rarity, helps to
romanticise them. Many of the idealised coloured illustrations of them
tend to do them a little more than justice: in fact, when one is confronted
with the reality of keeping them, they are often found to be a trifle
disappointing in some respects, delightful aviary birds though they
undoubtedly are.
When I was six years old, I was taken to visit the famous aviculturist,
Robert Cleugh. My overriding memory is of a pair of Red-headed Parrot
Finches, given pride of place in an aviary to themselves in that great
collection of rare birds. This pair had been supplied by C. N. Abrahams
of Cape Town, who in the thirties and early forties successfully bred both
Red-headed and Blue-faced Parrot Finches and imported a cock Royal
E. cyanovirens regia in 1938 from England. This bird produced a most
attractive hybrid with more red on it than either of its parents, in 1944,
and the skins of this interesting little family are to be seen still in the South
African Museum in Cape Town. Like Cleugh, Abrahams was a member of
the Avicultural Society and interesting accounts of his successes with
parrot finches were published in the July 1939 and Jan/Feb. 1945
numbers of the Magazine. Old Mr. Cleugh was hoping above all else to
breed from his pair of parrot finches; however not very long afterwards
he died and his noteworthy collection was dispersed.
Years later, as a schoolboy, I watched with envy-struck eye the efforts
of Davisson to breed up a stock of Red-headed Parrot Finches. I fell
completely under the spell of this bird and found the brilliant red and
green of its plumage most striking. I determined to save everything I
could to be able to afford a pair when Davisson had a surplus for sale,
but that never happened. Davisson spent a small fortune importing
parrot finches from different sources and in particular replacing the hens.
The finches were housed in generous sized aviaries with brick shelters
and with doors at the front so that the birds could be shut inside during
cold nights, and individual pairs were often given an aviary to themselves.
Despite these near ideal aviary conditions and a willingness on the part of
the parrot finches to go to nest, the fact that eventually (after numerous
discouraging losses) they were successfully bred and to more than one
generation, nesting failures and losses outweighed successes, and propa-

gating these Red-headed Parrot Finches proved rather like filling a sieve
with water. After years of dedication to this species, Davisson gave it up.
The few attempts he made to use Bengalese as foster parents he found
discouraging.
At about this time news of successful breeding of this species by
Khaled in Durban caused quite a stir. For a while they bred easily, the
hot, humid climate in Durban no doubt suiting them well, but that stock,
too, petered out.
red-headed parrot FINCH Erythrura psittacea
My chance to own parrot finches did not come until 1969, when I
acquired eight of the finest specimens I have ever seen in an exchange
with Eggington, then of Brierley Hill, Staffs, for white-breasted
Gouldians, which were the first to reach England. I persevered with the
species for four years, but I regret that, for some reason or other, I failed
completely. Even when one has acquired good stock, there are undoubtedly
snags to propagating parrot finches and I cannot help but compare how
well the white-breasted Gouldians have spread in England with how
poorly various species of parrot finch from diverse importations have
done in South Africa where one would imagine the climate to be advan-
tageous.
I tried my Red-headed Parrot Finches in aviaries of different sizes, the
smallest being 2 x 1 x 2m high, but all with shelters in which the birds
could be closed at night. I even tried a thermostatically controlled heater
in one shelter. The birds were housed in separate pairs, one pair with a
pair of Gouldians, and also in a small colony. Every day they were fed
either apple or orange, two mealworms per bird, and soft food of some
kind (bread and nectar or egg and biscuit). A multi-vitamin additive was
given in the water twice per week. The parrot finches were also very fond
of spinach beet, and consumed grated cuttlefish "bone" quite avidly, as
Gouldian Finches do.
Several of my pairs of Red-headed Parrot Finches laid clutches of eggs :
some of them never incubated at all, but two pairs sat extremely steadily.
Surprisingly the eggs were almost invariably clear: only once was there
any sign of fertility and in these eggs the embryo had perished in the early
stages. As time passed I was lucky enough to be able to obtain three more
specimens from different sources in case the stock was too closely related,
resulting in the infertility problem. One of these new males gave great
hope as he had been bred by a very experienced Johannesburg fancier, the
late Frank Mills, in a small cage on the balcony of his flat, and this bird
seemed virile, frequently uttered his trilling song and was obviously from
a different strain, as his green was a shade darker than that of the others.
Though he appeared to chase his hen and drive her to nest, and this pair
nested on a number of occasions and sat as tightly as could be, the result
was always the same--clear eggs. I tried trimming the feathers around

the vent as is often done with canaries, but to no avail. An article in
Australian aviculture, which unfortunately I can no longer trace, told
a similar story of the problem of infertility with the Red-headed Parrot
Finch, so it seems that my experience is not unique with this species.
However, stock has continued to come from the Continent, so obviously
under certain conditions fertile eggs are produced. I concluded that the
Johannesburg climate must be too dry, or the range between day and
night or summer and winter temperatures too great or the altitude too
high for these birds hailing from tropical, rain drenched Pacific islands--
or there was some other factor unknown to me that prevented success.
I did not find them delicate birds. None died from disease, but they
were prone to being startled at night and all those that I lost were un-
expectedly found dead or injured on some morning, presumably as a
result of a night fright. I sold the last of them to a very keen fancier in
Salisbury, Rhodesia, who had other stock. Again they got as far as laying
eggs, but never raised young, even in that more tropical and suitable
climate.
Red-headed are the most difficult of all the parrot finches to sex.
Certain particularly bright cocks are obvious and certain hens cannot be
mistaken, but the majority are tricky to determine. I got several expert
opinions on my stock, even from fanciers who had kept the species. The
results of their careful observations were recorded, but they all differed
and none proved to be correct. There were in fact some specimens which
I could not definitely determine as being cocks or hens even after three
years in my possession, though there weie others that left no room for
doubt.
peale's parrot finch E. c. pealei
In a second importation in 1969 I received from Eggington a magnificent
pair of the Fijian or Peale's Parrot Finch along with their recently bred
baby still out of colour. These three specimens are the only ones of this
race to have reached South Africa. They are among the most delightful
birds I have ever possessed and I much preferred them to the other
parrot finches I had kept. This is the only representative from the group
of short tailed parrot finches I have handled, and I found them very
distinctive with their stumpy little square tails. All parrot finches are
very dainty in movement and will cling upside down on wire netting
rather in the manner of a Siskin, but for charm in an aviary I found the
Peale's to surpass them all. They seemed to use their feet more in feeding
than other small birds, and had an interesting way of dealing with meal-
worms, whereby they would bite off the head and suck out the inside as
if from a tube of toothpaste and drop the empty skin. They would also
hold greenfood or a grass inflorescence down on the perch with one foot
while eating it bit by bit, and one could see how appropriate the name
"parrot finch" really is. With their red bonnets, little black bibs, backs

of lighter and brighter green than other parrot finches, and wonderful
peacock blue fronts, shading away to green, they were a wonderful sight
to see, especially when their colours glistened in bright sunlight. It may be
unfair to judge the relative merits of the parrot finch species after keeping
just three specimens of Peak's, but two further advantages of the latter
did strike me rather forcibly:-- tighter plumage and being more readily
sexable, the hens having much less blue on the front.
I housed my pair in a room 3 x 2 x 3m high approximately. This room
had two skylights and there were large windows at one end, which could
be opened, allowing the morning sun to stream in. Here the breeding
pair of Peak's seemed extremely happy and, much to my surprise, began
to nest within two months of their arrival, when I immediately removed
the Red-headed so as to give the Peak's every chance, but disappointment
met what seemed such an easy success. Four eggs were laid and all
hatched, but after 10 days the parents lost interest in the babies and
started to build another nest. I discovered the desertion in time, but my
effort to hand-rear the chicks failed. Putting this failure down to too
stimulating a diet, I cut out all the extras except for bread and honey
water. The second brood of three nestlings got further: all were fully
feathered and one morning I noticed that a baby had left the nest.
Attributing its puffed appearance to the cold weather, I did not investigate
further until the afternoon, when I was taken aback to find that the whole
brood had starved to death. Then winter intervened, and by the time of
the new breeding season I had put up several pairs of Bengalese in various
aviaries. (I have since heard that Bengalese are more successful with
foster babies when they are housed in small cages). But now a new
problem arose: no matter whether they were incubated by the parrot
finches themselves or by Bengalese, the eggs, though fertile, became
addled one by one at various stages during incubation. Only two eggs
hatched successfully out of four clutches, both of them under Bengalese.
The babies grew apace but, very curiously, each died in the same manner,
by jumping out of the nest box when first starting to feather. In great
disappointment I broke the pair, hoping to build both birds up into very
good condition for a renewed effort. Alas, one is allotted by fate all too
few chances of success in breeding rare birds, and before long I had lost
my chance for ever. There was in the little birdroom, in which I housed
the hen, a double canary-breeding cage on a low stand in which I was
keeping some Blue-faced Parrot Finches which were unable to fly after
importation. The hen Peak's must have moved under this cage and then
been startled and, having flown straight up with considerable force,
broken her neck. Assuming this to be a freak accident, I now moved the
Peak's cock and the young bird, which had by now coloured up into a
fine hen, into the birdroom on their own, except for the finches in the
small cage. Six weeks later the young hen met her end in exactly the same
manner as her mother, a tragic event, the more so because it could have

years of his life as a single bird, never showing the slightest interest in the

In 1971 I was able to purchase a pair of Blue-faced Parrot Finches out
of an importation from the Continent. Here, after a most unpromising
start, I did meet with success. First the hen fell seriously ill with what
appeared to be pneumonia, but she pulled through with sulphamezathine.
Then I found that the birds were unable to fly because their wing feathers
had been so badly frayed during the importation. This necessitated
keeping them in a small cage and drawing their flight feathers. They were
airborne within six weeks and immediately repaid the efforts expended
upon them by building a nest in an ordinary rectangular box and raising
two fine youngsters, which left the nest four months to the day of their
parents 5 arrival in the country.
For a moment it seemed as though the Blue-faced were going to prop-
agate in a most easy and uncomplicated manner, but as time went on
stumbling blocks became apparent. In nearly two years I raised only ten
of them, getting to the second generation. Despite adjustments in the
feeding programme, clutches of eggs followed on each other far too
rapidly and the hens would desert their broods when feathering and
build another nest. Bengalese foster parents seemed to be the answer, but
in my experience the Bengalese were very often less successful with parrot
finches than with other birds, a critical stage being when the babies first
left the nest and, as happened with the Peale's, young Blue-faced often
jumped out of the box even when just beginning to feather and were lost.
Disappointments with this species, too, were frequent and disheartening,
and the hens exhausted themselves with such rapid egg laying and were
often lost. Addled eggs were also common.
The Blue-faced strikes me as being the easiest of the parrot finches to
breed and, though their colours are less contrasting than those of the
Red-headed, their shade of green is the lighter and more attractive of the
two. Lovely birds as they undoubtedly are, they too show certain failings
which make them fall a trifle short of ideal as aviary birds. These dis-
advantages ate:--
1 They are very frequently loose and rough in feathering and spend much
time moulting, which renders them notably unsuccessful as show birds.
2 They are generally poor and highly unpredictable rearers of their
offspring.
3 Hens are far more delicate than cocks and often tend to lay too rapidly,
which weakens them drastically.
4 Even after generations of aviary breeding, they tend to be shy and
wild, skulking away in the bushes in planted aviaries and flying into a
panic in smaller aviaries whenever anyone enters.

5 They are extraordinarily difficult to train to sleep in the aviary shelter,
even where this is large and light, and even after months of being shut
inside at night will cling outside on the wire for the night at the first
opportunity, where they are exposed to extreme danger from the
weather, cats and other disturbances.
6 They are messy feeders, having the habit of flinging little pieces of their
soft food far and wide while they are eating, which necessitates frequent
washing of the wall, floor and perches anywhere near their feeding
vessels.
On the positive side, they are never dull in an aviary, being extra-
ordinarily lively and vivacious; they are interesting to feed because they
will sample almost anything, which their near relative, the staid Gouldian
Finch, to its disadvantage I feel, will not; and they are very willing to
make some effort at nesting, so that, unlike so many other species, they
seldom do nothing for very long and quickly raise their owner's hopes,
even if to dash them in due course.

CURRENT BREEDING SUCCESS IN SOUTH AFRICA IN SMALL CAGES

I doubt that I shall try parrot finches again, or that I should have been
tempted to put pen to paper, as I had little positive to say, had it not been
for the success attained this year by Rodriques, a fellow member of the
Rand Avicultural Society who lives also in Johannesburg, in breeding the
Red-headed species, which had been such a complete failure with me.
Rodriques purchased two pairs imported from the Continent in 1976.
Working with cages only 60 cm long, 38 cm deep and 45 cm high, he has
raised 15 youngsters since February this year. All have been foster-reared
by pairs of Bengalese housed in similar small cages. For the past few
years he has had marked success at fostering quite a variety of Australian
finches under his Bengalese in these small cages, and the Red-headed
Parrot Finches seem to have dovetailed well into his establishment. The
cages are in a roughly constructed room, which is open on the one side
and there is no heating at any time.
Both pairs of Red-headed Parrot Finches took readily to wooden nest
boxes 13 x 13 x 23 cm and half open at the one end. The hens laid
numerous eggs, but seldom even attempted to incubate them. These were
transferred to Bengalese and a high proportion of them hatched success-
fully. Rodrigues' experience echoes mine in that he has found parrot
finches a little more tricky to rear under the Bengalese than the Australian
finches, and the Bengalese quite often stop feeding for no apparent
reason and the young parrot finches are lost. The total of 15 reared
represents the survivors of 34 hatched, so the survival rate is not high,
even though 15 successfully reared is a satisfying beginning.
The feeding methods employed comprise the usual seeds and a daily
supply of soft food made from Pro Nutro (a proprietary brand of breakfast
food), the "quick-cooking"' oats as sold to make porridge, Calsuba (a

soluble calcium food), Vi-Day-Lin (a multi-vitamin mixture) and a
special powder recently put on the market here to add to the egg food for
rearing canaries and containing lysine in addition to the usual vitamins
and trace elements, and two or three mealworms per bird twice per week.
It intrigues me to try to explain why Rodriques has had no difficulty in
getting fertile eggs from his Red-headed Parrot Finches whereas my birds
from different sources consistently proved infertile. That there was some
small thing lacking in the diet I used does not seem likely, and it is
tempting to view Rodrigues' success as stemming from his housing the
species in small cages. Though I wonder!
Another success reported with 1976 imported parrot finches comes
from Rautenbach of Vanderbijl Park, some 40 miles south of Johannesburg.
Three pairs each of Blue-faced and Red-headed are housed in one large
room 12m long, 5m wide and over 3m high, with access to an additional
outside flight where the birds can derive the benefit from direct sunshine
when they feel so inclined during the day. There are so many partitions
near the ceiling and so much artificial cover that it is impossible to keep
track of numbers bred in this set-up, though it is obvious that the Blue-
faced has propagated well. The first pair of Blue-faced to breed made
their nest in a potted fern and apparently they have continued to find
similar ferns the most attractive of all nesting sites. They have been fed
the usual seeds and also egg food as is prepared for breeding canaries,
and mealworms from time to time. It seems as though the Red-headed
have also bred in this large aviary, though it is very clear from a rough
survey that the Blue-faced has proved by far the easier of the two species
to breed.

By Robin L. Restall (Chicago, U.S.A.) i
For almost exactly twenty years I kept and studied foreign birds whilst
living in England. Then, in 1967 and since, I have been travelling to many
parts of the world and I have lived in several different countries. My
avicultural activities in each of the countries in which I have been resident
have been as different as the countries themselves. When I lived in Den-
mark, I kept and studied as many Australian finches as possible. In Spain,
I concentrated on the species of European birds that were available to
someone like myself, and when I transferred to Venezuela, I entered a
new world in every sense. For the first time I was able to study, first hand,
many of the species that I knew only from the literature and behind bars
(the birds--not me!).
During my three years in Venezuela, I was able to obtain many species
of Venezuelan birds, a few of which I kept in cages for short or medium
to long periods. There was a thriving cage bird trade in Venezuela (but
they were only allowed to sell foreign birds). The sources of supply were
Holland, Argentina and Mexico in that order of importance. The birds
imported from Holland were either Pekin Robins or the usual African/
Indian mixture of seedeaters. Occasionally there would be a sprinkling
of European finches and sometimes some quite good varieties of canary.
There were two pet shops that I patronized and I would always study
their "Dutch mixture" because occasionally some rare or unusual Argen-
tinian birds would turn up in them. The birds imported from Mexico
were invariably the Passerina buntings, Virginian Cardinals, Pyrrhuloxias
C. sinuata and the Indigo Grosbeak. They were usually males only and
no other species from Mexico ever came in.
The birds imported from Argentina provided me with many oppor-
tunities to obtain and study species that I had never even seen before and,
in some cases, finches that I had not even listed in my book, finches and
other seedeating birds. Once again the birds were nearly always males.
Pet shops aside, Venezuela gave me many opportunities to study the
local birds. I trapped, and ringed hundreds of birds in the garden of the
apartment block where I lived in an attempt to make accurate records of
the local populations and occasionally I would carry out similar observa-
tions in the gardens of friends in Caracas and elsewhere.
A year after my arrival in Venezuela, I woke up to the fact that I could
well be transferred back to Europe without having done anything worth-
while other than simply enjoy myself and widen my personal experience
of birds. I talked to various friends in the Venezuelan Audubon Society
and, together with my wife and a friend, developed plans for a Field
Studies Project on the ranch of another friend in the interior. This ranch
covers 990 hectares and is situated at the very edge of the mountain range

that runs from east to west across the coastal side of Venezuela. The ranch
had a remarkable variety of geographical features; there were several hills,
usually bare on the upper slopes and either lightly or densely wooded
farther down; in the valleys there was either thick second growth scrub or
mature gallery forest. There was a river which raged thirty feet wide and
five feet deep at the height of the rainy season and became truncated and
largely dried out at the height of the dry season. There was a lagoon which
suffered similar extremes of fortune and an enormous reservoir which
formed one of the boundaries of the property. Standing on the brow of
the southernmost hill, one could look north and see the mountain range
stretching endlessly. Then, turn about face, and see the flat llanos stretch-
ing hundreds of miles towards Colombia and the Amazon. It sounds rich
and lush and to us it certainly was, being populated with Cayman alligators,
Piranha, Boa Constrictors, Howler Monkeys and many, many more; even
the Jaguar has been recorded. By Venezuelan standards, however, this was
a poor piece of land, both in quality and quantity of species. This suited
us very well and we started a twelve-month project, recording every month
all the birds, mammals, flowering plants and fish we could see and record
their behaviour.
We saw many birds; quite a few were migrants from the north but a
surprising number were present all the year round. The species list for
the ranch reached 300. If that sounds good to you, remember that there
are in fact probably 1300 species recorded for Venezuela. I tried to con-
centrate my activities on maintaining two or three mist-nets which enabled
me to make accurate notes on plumage conditions, age, sex, etc., and
quite honestly, if we had not been able to catch so many birds we would
not have been able to identify so many. My nets were beside, across or
near the river, which was very convenient for me because I could easily
cool off, wading up and down wearing Wellington boots, swim-suit and a
safari jacket, while my poor wife trekked miles under the tropical sun up
hill and down dale collecting botanical specimens while our friend, in
charge of listing the bird species seen, wandered even farther afield
carrying a parabolic reflector and a tape recorder.
One of the most distinctive sounds of the tropical forest is the call of
the Rufous-browed Peppershrike Cyclarhis gujanensis. This bird is the
commonest of the Vireonidae on the ranch, but it always eluded my
nets because it appeared to be exclusively a bird of the canopies. I longed
to catch one, to study its food preferences and to sketch and paint it, but
when eventually one did enter the net, it was at a time when I had so many
other birds with higher priorities that I released it--but only after it had
been photographed and carefully examined. Dr David Snow visited
Venezuela at about this time and I was delighted that he was able to stay
at my home for a few days, during which time we did nothing but discuss
Venezuelan birds. I asked my guest whether he could throw any light
on the feeding habits of the Peppershrike since I wanted to be as well

prepared as possible should I ever manage to bring one home. It seems
that it often cracks open rolled-up dead leaves, some of which must be
very hard indeed, to get at the nests of spiders or the metamorphosing
larvae of various butterflies, etc. It also, no doubt, takes beetles, some of
which have pretty hard "shells". This probably accounts for the size and
strength of the Peppershrike&amp;apos;s bill. I have caught and handled very many
birds in recent years but I have never been bitten quite so badly as I have
been by the Rufous-browed Peppershrike. Subsequently, I did catch one
at a time when I had very few birds at home and when I also had a healthy
overflowing mealworm culture. In addition to various soft foods, I gave
my Peppershrike grasshoppers, mealworm beetles, pupae and larvae, but
it would not feed satisfactorily and despite my force feeding it with meal-
worms, it died on the third day. This was one of my very few failures
during three years of keeping birds in Venezuela and I will now tell you
of another.
The Bare-eyed Thrush Turdus nudigenis is perhaps the commonest
thrush in Venezuela, but what an intriguing subfamily the Turdinae are!
They have extended into every habitat and have proliferated into many
species. In every habitat one may find several species of thrash, even
apparently competing for the same niche. For such a widespread and
common subfamily, it is surprising how little comparative data are known
and how few comparative studies have been made. The Bare-eyed Thrush
is a good song bird, though not in the class of our European thrushes. Its
main characteristic, when seen, is the thick rim of orange-yellow flesh
around the eye, far more noticeable than that of the eye ring of a European
Blackbird, When out of sight, the bird may readily be told by its strong
mewing cry. Having caught dozens of these birds over the months, I
eventually decided to take one home. It received the same treatment as the
Rufous-browed Peppershrike and went the same way. These were the
only two deaths of my unwilling visitors which, frankly I consider a pretty
good record considering the many dozens of birds that stayed with me prior
to being released again. I tell the story for two reasons. Firstly, to point
out that birds are not 100 per cent predictable when transferred from the
habitat to which they are accustomed to a fresh one and, secondly, that
newly caught birds are quite different in their requirements from birds
that have been in captivity for some time.
The Streaked Saltator Saltator albicollis was in such beautiful plumage
that I couldn&amp;apos;t resist it, even though I was up to my eyebrows in Black-
faced Grass quits. This bird was quickly fading even though it was offered
as wide a variety of food that I could think of. On the second day, I force-
fed it with several mealworms and a little Philadelphia brand cream cheese,
mixed with glucose and milk. I left the bird overnight in a hospital cage
with the light on and nothing but mealworms, and to my delight in the
five hours that it was left by itself it pulled through completely and from
then on did not look back. Saltators are apparently leaf and bud-eating

birds; watching them in the wild, they seem to exist entirely on leaves and
buds. However, when attracted to bird tables, they will take fruit, and the
species that I have kept have all taken mealworms in their cages. This
particular bird ignored every seed that I offered, being rather choosy about
fruit and gobbling every mealworm available. I soon released it, as every
mealworm culture has its limits and I had many birds to think about.
There are so many orioles and blackbirds, not to mention grackles,
marshbirds and starlings in the New World family of Icteridae that I
tried to refer to them all as icterids in order to avoid artificial separations
and the confusion with the various Old World families. After all, they are
a uniquely New World family.
There are several species of icterids that we recorded on the ranch,
some of them rare visitors like the Giant Cowbird, and others breeding
residents like the Troupial. The Troupial Icterus icterus is the national
bird of Venezuela and it is easily the favourite cage bird of that country.
It is commonly kept in a small cage, far too small in my opinion for such
an active and intelligent bird. Venezuelans invariably feed their Troupials
on bread and milk and various fruits. Passing through the countryside in
the interior of Venezuela it is not uncommon to find small boys selling
Troupials by the roadside. This practice is quite illegal--a fact which deters
neither the boys nor their customers. I never caught a Troupial but I
did buy them on the odd occasion and found that they were all that their
reputation held them to be. I fed my birds with a "universal" soft food,
mixed with honey, grated cheese, chopped hard-boiled egg, etc., the
occasional mealworm and plenty of fruit; it always was the fruit which went
first. Whatever Troupials feed on in the wild clearly affects the colour of
the bird, for their orange is variable, usually paler, almost yellowish in
immatures and sometimes near vermilion in mature adults. Most Troupials
in captivity tend to moult into progressively paler plumage and I have
seen many birds that were completely yellow. This is not necessary, how-
ever, for the occasional Troupial seems to be able to improve its colour
when kept on a diet of mixed fruit, etc. I have read on more than one
occasion that the Troupial builds a penduline nest as most icterids do.
This is quite untrue; every single nesting Troupial that I ever saw or heard
of had commandeered the nest of the Rufous-fronted Thornbird
Phacellodomus rufifrons. I have found that newly caught or comparatively
wild Troupials can be kept in mixed collections without any fighting or
aggression but there is no doubt that these birds can be very aggressive
and spiteful and a very strongly marked pecking order is established within
Troupial communities. If a new Troupial or similarly coloured bird is
added to a collection, the risk of the dominant Troupial causing it severe
physical damage are considerable, and I urge anybody acquiring this
species to take great care with continual observations when mixing. The
range of the Troupial is quite wide but any birds coming from Venezuela
are smuggled out and those coming from Colombia might not be coming

for much longer. It is an easy species to maintain in captivity as I have
indicated and I would like to emphasise that, in my opinion, for many
reasons, it is well worth being given high priority when considering
breeding.
One weekend I caught some Yellow Orioles Icterus nigrogularis and I
kept a pair for a month to see whether they had any dietary quirks, and
also to paint them. In the field, the sexes of these birds appear to be identi-
cal but in the hand the female can be seen to have a faint olive wash to the
mantle and the rich golden yellow on the head and breast of the male is
more intense. This pair settled in very easily, taking the soft food readily
and in fact seemed to put on weight with it.
Our only honeycreeper was the ubiquitous Bananaquit Coereba flaveola.
This is one of the commonest birds in the Neotropics and is found in the
heart of the cities or deep in the tropical jungle. It is a cheerful and per-
sistent song bird and quite easy to maintain in captivity, feeding on nectar,
fruit, small seeds, berries and insects. Mature adults in breeding plumage
have a rich velvety blackness to their upperparts that is most attractive.
When the weather became very dry, the Bananaquits came to a few remain-
ing pools of water in the stream in large numbers and so many of them
entered the mist-net as to hamper my activities in keeping proper records.
For some reason, however, they are very easy to extract and release, not
always the case with some birds.
Whether I was alone attending a net, or with helpers, whenever a group
of Blue-grey Tanagers Thraupis episcopus were netted, the cry went up
"Oh, no!" These birds invariably struggled and were frequently difficult
to extract because they managed somehow to tangle their feet up. They
bit continually and quite hard, but worst of all they always kept up a
tremendously vociferous "yakking" which attracts all the other Blue-grey
Tanagers in the area who flit about the canopy, scolding excitedly and
occasionally mobbing. This species is very easy to adapt to cage life.
Another tanager that was quite common was the White-lined Tanager
Tachyphonus rufus . This bird is called the "chocolatero" in Spanish; the
early settlers thought that the rich chocolate-coloured female was a separate
species and it was given its own name. I was once given a pair by a friend
whose maid had brought several back from her village as a gift for our
friend's children. The birds were in deplorable condition and were being
fed on bread and milk exclusively. By the time I appeared on the scene,
only one pair remained alive. I kept them until they moulted and, once
in full plumage, they were speedily released, but in the months that I
had them I found them to be birds of considerable personality and great
charm. Not only did they take a little fruit with my soft food mixture but
they also ate a fair amount of seed. My friend, Herbert Murray, has told
me that most tanagers in his experience eat far more seed than the books
give them credit for, but in the tropics, at least in Venezuela, very few
tanagers in captivity will ever take seed if a soft food alternative is available, j

We certainly had a good record of dove-spotting on the ranch. At
almost any time of the year one could hear the Scaled Dove Scardafella
squamata , often very persistently and at high intensity. This species was
easily the most common of its family and occurred everywhere except in
high forest. In the hand, the differences between juvenile and adult
plumage and between the sexes could easily be told but, in the field, they
did look somewhat alike. The pattern of the plumage of this bird is
incredibly complex, but I was never able to keep the bird for painting.
Occasionally, when I caught several, I would place one or two in a cage
for the remainder of the weekend to await our trip back to the city, but
they would batter themselves about so much that I preferred to release
them again rather than risk an injury. Of the seven species of dove that we
recorded regularly, I did, however, keep the Plain-breasted Colomhina
minuta and the Scaly-breasted Colombina passerina. The former individual
had been brought to me by a friend who had rescued it from his Siamese
cat and the second was one of the many that I trapped round our house
when ringing the birds for a field study. I found the only practical way to
keep these birds was in a completely covered cage, keeping them quiet
and unobserved. They could be steadied down fairly quickly if one had the
time and patience, but most of my daylight hours were spent either at the
office or out in the country and I was not concerned with preparing my
birds for a permanent life of captivity. I found the doves very easy to
maintain on a variety of seed and fresh water.
The Kiskadee Pitangus sulphuratus is widely spread and very common
over most of South America. It appears to be fairly omnivorous in the
wild, taking not only flying insects but every other form of animal life
that it can catch and comfortably swallow, including lizards, nestling birds
and waterlife. I have often seen it taking food from the surface of streams
and ponds in exactly the same way that a kingfisher does. I kept one adult
male for a couple of months and it settled in very quickly, soon becoming
a fairly tame, steady bird despite the fact that it had to be caught up several
times in order to make detailed sketches and colour references of it. It
took just about everything I offered, including seed and soft fruit, but it
undoubtedly preferred the soft food mixture. I believe that this species
has been bred on several occasions in Britain and I have no doubt that,
in fairly modest conditions, the species could be established in captivity.
It has all the intelligence and personality depths of the Troupial and must
be capable of satisfying the most demanding bird lover.
My avicultural interest, which was really only a sideline of all the field
work, was in finches. I am writing about these in separate articles in the
Magazine.

By W. D. Cummings (Umlaas Road, Natal)
It is several years since I last wrote for the avicultural magazine, but
during this time I have gained considerably more experience with keeping
and breeding birds in captivity under entirely different climatic conditions
from those I was used to in England. Climate, of course, plays a part as a
stimulus to breeding, but all the other necessary stimuli-- e.g. the right
nest boxes for parrots, diet, compatibility, all play a part regardless of the
environment.
There is every variation of climate in this country, but I have worked
mainly in the Transvaal which can be cold in winter with hot, often dry,
summers--and in Natal which has a more typically subtropical climate.
Variations in the weather pattern excluded, most species of birds differ
in some way in the stimulus they require to bring them to the peak of
breeding condition in captivity and all this makes the keeping and breeding
of new species fascinating, exciting and a challenge. In this country
preferences for the type of birds kept differ somewhat from tastes in
England. Doves that prefer a warm dry climate are more popular here
than in England and are bred freely--not as one pair per aviary as we
used to do in England, but in large mixed communities with a high degree
of breeding success--and, of course, if the nesting facilities are there, the
bigger the group the less individual aggression you get.
The American doves (Cinnamon, Pigmy, Peruvian, North American
Mourning Zenaida macroura. Long-tailed Mourning, Inca, Scaled), the
Indian Green-winged, Cuckoo Doves, Necklace and Australian doves are
kept successfully and bred together, plus the larger Nicobar Pigeon, etc.
There are also quite a few popular mutations including white and pied
of the Senegal Laughing Dove Streptopelia senegalensis and numerous
varieties of colour in the Diamond Dove including red, yellow, pied,
white, cinnamon and silver, to name some of them. The red variety is a
good red colour and the yellow a real yellow, and both seem to be recessive.
Bleeding Heart Doves Gallicolumba luzonica are also bred freely here and
the Barbary Dove has quite a few colour variations including a very
pretty cinnamon and a pure white bird that has retained the black neck
band.
Pheasants and waterfowl are not so popular, but most of the commoner
pheasants are kept and bred freely. I would think that the more tropical
pheasants such as Argus, fireback and peacock pheasants would do well in
the Natal climate where it is very dry in the winter in parts of the country.
All the Australian parrakeets are most popular and the more common
ones such as Cockatiel (of which there are infinite colour variations)
Red-rumped, Bourke's and the Turquoisine have been bred too freely
and flooded the local markets, so consequently the price has tumbled. In

this climate they tend to breed at a much earlier age and I have had
Golden-mantled Rosellas under a year old (while still in the first year
plumage with the cock hardly identifiable from the hen) go to nest and
rear 4-5 young. In one case the cock moulted into adult plumage while
raising his second brood.
The type of aviaries favoured here differs little from those in Europe, for
birds under restriction still need protection from the wind, strong sun or
extreme cold. Most parrots dislike excessive heat and are most active in
the early mornings and evenings. The variety of pests is increased by the
more moderate climate and these include bees, fleas and snakes. The
bees, a native wild species, are very aggressive and often take a liking to
nest boxes when looking for a new home and will attack any nearby
moving object. On one occasion I found all the imnates of several flights
sitting motionless on the ground, instinctively sensing that in this way
they would avoid provoking the swarm of bees. If one waits until almost
dark when the bees have retreated into one of the nest boxes, one can
block the entrance hole and so capture and remove the whole swarm.
The sand flea is more of a problem, especially if one keeps ground birds
like quail, some species of which are popular here, being kept and bred
in some numbers. The fleas are blackish and they congregate round the
eyes of the birds:unbelievable as it may seem, a heavy infestation can
kill a fully grown domestic chicken from, I presume, loss of blood.
Applying an insecticide powder to the bird itself and putting some on the
ground will eradicate these pests. Snakes are another problem, some
species being attracted to the aviaries by the mice, others by the birds or
their eggs. Most seem to be attracted to nest boxes as places of refuge and
one has to be a little careful about where one pokes one's nose. The snakes
are incredibly acrobatic and manage to get into places that one would
never believe possible. Egg-eating Snakes and Spitting Cobras are two of
the most commonly met species.
Nesting boxes vary as in Europe, but natural nesting places made from
the hollow trunk of the syringa tree are widely used and easily adapted;
these are very attractive to most parrot-like birds. In addition, sisal
stumps, the dead flowering spike of the sisal are liked by those birds that
prefer a long tunnel entrance to the nest: the stumps are placed horizon-
tally, the fibrous interior being removed. They vary, of course, in the
size of the bole and of the spike: the caiques and Patagonian Conures
like quite a tight fit, whereas the Eclectus Parrots prefer a much larger
stump and tunnel.
Seed-growing is out of the question in most areas because of the wild
birds such as weavers, finches, etc., but sunflower seed is grown on the
high veld treeless zones. Vegetables and green food require considerable
irrigation, and water is an expensive commodity here. We give the same
fruits as in Europe with the addition of paw-paw (papaya); also fresh
com on the cob which is seasonal. Oranges and bananas are cheaper here

in season, but unfortunately what you need is not always available when
the birds are breeding. Germinated sunflower seed and biscuits form part
of the diet.
I am now working with Mr. Brian Boswell's collection at the Natal
Lion Park. He possesses a very varied range of parrot-like birds with a
strong emphasis on the South American parrots, macaws and conures,
but which includes over 15 species of cockatoo and many more lories.
Among the rarer species are Racquet-tailed Parrakeets, Red-fronted
Macaws, Lear's and Hyacinthine Macaws, Timneh Parrots, Palm Cocka-
toos, Pesquet's and Red-capped Parrots and White-crowned Pionus
P. senilis. We are building up breeding groups of the species represented
in the collection and for this year, my second with this collection, we have
bred the following, on some of which I shall be writing in greater detail
later. Successful breeding of lories and lorikeets included 3 Moluccan,

cockatoos laid, but did not rear any young. These were mostly newly
formed pairs and, of course, it is not a short term business to plan a
breeding programme for these species, but it is an encouraging beginning.

to give further details of some of the breedings.
Maximilian's Pionus maximiliani are in some cases easy to sex, the males
having a larger white ring round the eye than females, though our pair are
almost identical in looks. The young are like the parents in size and colour,
but have a broken red frontal band and less violet colouring on the breast.
The adults lack a red frontal band which disappears at the first juvenile
moult. This parrot lays a very large egg for its size and our pair laid a
clutch of three each time. They showed a marked preference for green
food after the young hatched, to the extent that they seemed almost to go
off their normal diet (sunflower seed, soaked biscuit, etc.). They even
cropped the grass close in their aviary and this is in stark contrast to the
Blue-headed P. menstruus , their near relatives, who show little or no
interest in green food. We had four Maximilian's in an aviary together and
they seemed very agreeable to each other. I was told they were newly
imported immature birds, but I know now that they were fully adult, for

they lacked the juvenile red band. They are quiet unassuming little
parrots and, not expecting them to breed this year, I only put in a natural
nesting log because there was one to spare. Two of these Maximilian's
were easily sexed as a pair by the white eye rings, but the other two I was
uncertain of until I saw them mating and it was this pair that nested.
They were subservient to the other pair and after the hen had been
sitting for some time, we decided to take away the other pair because the
breeding male was being bullied a little by the other male and this
obviously would detract from the successful feeding and rearing of the
young. As it was, three magnificent young ones were reared.
Another interesting similarity between these and the Blue-headed is
that the juvenile Blue-headed also have this red frontal band which, of
course, the adult birds lack and which disappears with the first juvenile
moult. The Blue-headed leave the nest all green in colour and with no
sign of the blue head and neck feathers that are assumed within the year.
They are by disposition, however, far more aggressive than the Maxi-
milian's and two pairs could never be kept together. They bred in a small
shallow natural nesting log. The Blue-headed are not easy to sex, but the
male seems to have a slightly darker blue head and neck.
We had three adult Black-headed Caiques Pionites melanocephala
together in one aviary and two in another. The three lived in perfect
harmony together with only the friendly bickering which is usual among
these playful little parrots. They all slept together in a sisal stump with
a long narrow tunnel entrance. The stump was probably quite dark inside
and it is noticeable that young caiques, when they leave the nest have a
bone-coloured spot on either side of the upper mandible on an otherwise
sooty black coloured beak, these spots disappearing soon after the birds
leave the nest. Otherwise the young are similar to the adults in size and
colour except that their breast colour is a yellow wash and not white as in
the adult and the iris is dark, not red as in the adult bird. Sexing caiques
is not an easy occupation, for both sexes have an aggressive "song" and
display. I suspect that the male is the slightly smaller of the two. Our
three birds reared two young last year and this year reared four fine
youngsters. We left one of last year's young with the three birds in the
hope of making another pair and we now have a colony of six birds who
all agree together and although they have a choice of three sisal stumps,
they seem to roost together. These little parrots also lay a very large egg
for the size of the bird and they seem to be colony breeders and possibly
all assist with the feeding and rearing of the young, but once I tried to
add another, a stranger, to the colony and this proved impossible, for
even though they were in adjoining aviaries, the three managed to "beat
up" the odd one and it was a very sad bird by the end of the day. It
could have been that there were three of one sex and one of the other, but
generally caiques are cantankerous and bad mixers, the residents not
allowing a stranger in. The other pair, within hearing of the three, hatched.

but failed to rear their chicks. There is a size difference in these two birds:
their diet is the same as for all the parrots, but although they seem not to
like soaked dog biscuit, they take dry biscuits and soak them in the water
before eating them. Caiques are full of tricks and are most attractive and
interesting little parrots.
At the time of writing this article we have two pairs of Coffin's
Cockatoos, African Grey Parrots and two pairs of African Ring-necked
Parrakeets with chicks; young Citron-crested Cockatoos, Timor Island

By George A. Smith (Peterborough)
Particularly high selective pressure can sometimes so alter the appearance
of a bird that it becomes difficult to relate to other species. In such cases
hybrid evidence can be most helpful: for (irrespective of what other
evidence may appear to show) the ability to produce hybrids is a concrete
proof of a fairly close kinship between the species. There are a series of
generalisations (not "rules") to explain the different degrees of hybrid
fertility.
Where the hybridising species are most alike, as for example between
the Golden Pheasant Chrysolophus pictus and the Lady Amherst's
Pheasant C. amherstiae , the offspring can be more fertile, and much more
viable, than the species from which they originate. As the genetic differ-
ence between the parent species is increased, the less chance there is that
the female hybrid will be fertile; the males remaining fertile. Of the many
examples, the better known is probably the Hooded Siskin Carduelis
cucullata x Canary; a cross often used in the past to produce the so-called
red Canary. (I have been told that the hybrid males of this cross start by
being absolutely sterile and then, after a few years, they become in-
creasingly fertile. If so, this might be explained on the grounds of age
altering previously faulty pairing behaviour rather then a greater
efficiency in spermatogenesis). With an even greater separation between
the species, the young of both sexes are usually sterile and one of the
better known examples here is the Domestic Duck x Muscovy Duck
Cairina moschata. At a slightly greater distance between the parent species,
the hybrids are weakly and often die either before hatching or because
they cannot escape from the eggshell and those that do survive are almost
invariably male. Should the species be even more distant in their common
ancestry, and a good example is the cross between the Domestic Fowl
and the Turkey, the embryo always dies some time before the anticipated

hatching. At too wide a divergence, say between the Budgerigar and a
lovebird (Agapornis species), the eggs would be clear because the ova
cannot be fertilised.
From the records it appears that the majority of captive-bred hybrids
are a 'by product 5 of keeping a mixed collection. Or, which is practically
the same thing, having two birds of different species and opposite sex
housed together to save aviary space. The very big exception to this
generalisation, is the purposeful cross-mating of the various European
finches (and the Canary) for exhibition at bird shows. It might be interest-
ing to speculate as to what fraction of the haphazardly-produced hybrids
get reported: knowing the reluctance of most people to write to the
avicultural press, I would imagine less than a quarter. And it is probable
that cases where eggs failed to hatch, or chicks to fledge, would stand
even less chance of a mention. Whereas clear eggs must mostly go un-
reported, which is especially unfortunate, as infertility has its own
interest.
'Naturally-produced 5 , perhaps better phrased as 'wild-bred 5 , hybrids,
although once uncommonly reported, are becoming ever more frequently
seen. There may be many reasons for this. One is that this is the direct
consequence of human activity in changing the vegetation of a country
so that species which formerly had no contact can now spread their range
to meet each other. This is particularly so in North America with buntings,
warblers and orioles. Or, as with gulls in Europe and New Zealand, where
human activity has caused one species to expand in numbers to 'invade 5
the breeding area of the other. In these cases it appears to be the absence
of a suitable mate of their own species which causes them to hybridise;
for the main reason as to why hybrids are so scarce in the wild is that
birds prefer their own species. Other hybrids have been found by
especially searching for them in areas where two, otherwise geographically
separated, species just overlap. One difficulty in trying to find wild-bred
hybrids would be that most of those that did hatch would die before they
were noticed. The life of most wild-reared baby birds is measured in days
and few survive to mature. How few dead chicks are ever seen? Also,
despite a possible hybrid-vigour, the cross-bred chick might always be
disadvantaged in the wild. Because hybrids look different, they would be
more likely to catch the eye, and then hold the interest, of a predator.
And if the feeding pattern they inherit was intermediate between the two
parent species, they would compete most 'unfairly 5 with the more
specialised 'pure 5 species. The birds which so readily hybridise in cap-
tivity would, or could, not do so in the wild because they originate from
different parts of the world or seldom mix together.
A hybrid bird is subconsciously expected to look intermediate in
appearance between the two parent species. This is often the case, but it
need not be so. Usually species differ in many ways from each other yet
it will be found on closer examination of the hybrids that, for each

'separating' feature rather than an 'intermingling' inheritance, they have
the all-or-none inheritance so well known in colour mutations: where one
is dominant to the other's recessiveness. If, for example, a Cordon-bleu
Waxbill Estrilda bengala is crossed with a Blue-capped Waxbill E.
cyanocephala , the red cheek spot of the former is entirely 'lost' in the
hybrids and is not found in an 'intermediate' form. Likewise with the
Yellow r -fronted Amazon Parrot Amazona ochrocephala x Blue-fronted
Amazon A. aestiva the hybrids are not 'intermediate' in the only feature
which separates these two 'doubtful' species, for the head is exactly as in
the Yellow-fronted. In the two small ringed plovers Charadrius semi -
palmatus and C. hiaticula where they meet and hybridise, the chicks are
exactly like the former species (Smith 1969). When a Black-headed
Caique Pionites melanocephala is crossed with a White-bellied Caique
P. leucogaster the offspring are no different in any feature from their
White-bellied parent: in this example it is very likely that only a single
gene, that for 'blackness' which separates these two 'species'. And,
circumstantial evidence seems to show that the Yellow-lored Amazon
Amazona xantholora , if it hybridises with the Spectacled Amazon A.
albifrons , produces hybrids which almost exactly, if not exactly, take after
one parent in their appearance; for hybrids are not recorded although the
'species' overlap. It might be mentioned here that many Spectacled
Amazon Parrots have yellow feathers intermingled with the red of the
lores and yellow faces, but these are the Mexican form and not that from
Yucatan and associated areas where the two 'species' intermingle. There
must be many examples where, for one feature, instead of intermingling
an all-or-none inheritance is found and I should be pleased to hear of
these.
Annie P. Gray (1958) found sufficient avian hybrids in the literature to
compile a book with the title of this article. Her list might usefully be
brought up to date. (It is unfortunate, therefore, that Dr. Emilius
Hopkinson was of an earlier generation, for he obviously used to revel in
searching out references). Should someone do so, they might consider
some way of ranking the validity of each hybrid: the genuine, the
probable and then the imaginary and totally unbelievable. Miss Gray
restricted herself to a sentence or two of comment after each hybrid. Her
censure, even when dealing with the most improbable of cases, was so
mild that it has not stopped some from accepting them as 'proven'. For
not everyone has time, patience or opportunity to trace references to their
source and even such monstrous hybrids as those, supposedly, between
the Domestic Duck x Domestic Fowl or the Lyrebird Menura novae-
hollandiae (a passerine with some possible kinship to birds of paradise) x
Domestic Fowl, have more than one reference. Once I had reason to
check upon all the unlikely parrot hybrids listed in Gray: there were
eight. The crosses between the lovebirds (species of Agapornis ) and the
Budgerigar had no authenticity and three, incidently of the more re-

markable, resulted from the same rather stupid joke (Martin 1949)
another, the "cross 55 between the Redrump x Cockatiel came from a
casual remark in Green's parrots. One between a Barraband Polytelis
swainsonii x Eastern Rosella Platycercus eximius could not then be traced,
but when it subsequently was this too was apocryphal and cannot be
accepted. When it came to the Australian King Parrot Alisterus scapularis
x Pennant's Parrakeet P. e. elegans the references were K. Ackermann
(1898) and A. Suchetet (1897) with the remark that "it is possible that
hybridisation may sometimes occur in the wild". The reliability of these
two gentlemen is suspect, for on going through Gray's hybrids, many of
the hybrids of which they are the only references are doubtful and all
have the same comment about wild hybridisation being suspected. For
example, of the thirteen reported hybrids between birds of prey, nine are
from these authors including the Merlin Falco columbarius x Kestrel
F. tinnunculus. This is nothing more than folklore.

True tool-users in the wild (continued)
That the Satin Bower-bird Ptilonorhynchus violaceus might rank as an
avian tool-user was first tentatively concluded by Gannon (1930) who
noticed that a male of the species held a "bark-wad" in its bill while
An adult male Satin Bower-bird plastering his bower with a mixture of charcoal

working at its bower. This use of "a tool to assist in painting his bower
with a suspension of chewed charcoal in saliva" is referred to by Marshall
(1954) who continued "Many people have since observed this remarkable
phenomenon. Some--but apparently not all--males collect fragments of
fibrous bark, manipulate them with the beak and so manufacture a small
oval pellet which measures about 10 x 6mm and 4mm thick. This is not
a brush. It seems to be a kind of combination sponge, wedge and stopper
which is held almost wholly within the beak somewhat towards the distal
extremity. The pellet keeps the beak slightly open as the bird jabs at, and

paints, the individual twigs with the sides of its beak. It acts also as a
sponge to help retain the liquid while this operation takes place." The
action of the stopper on the bower is not direct (see colour photograph in
Marshall i960) and this was held by Millikan and Bowman (1967) to
disqualify the bird as a true tool-user, but Chisholm (1954) and Lawick-
Goodall (1970) expressed contrary views. It seems to me to be a valid
case.
While all but one of the other avenue-building bower-birds are known
to paint their bowers, none appears to have been recorded using a tool in
the process (C. B. Frith, pers. comm, and, e.g. Peckover 1969).
Armstrong (1947) refers to the Red-faced Cisticola Cisticola erythrops
and other warblers (no doubt including the Singing Cisticola Cisticola
cantans) as tool-users, but these merely build nests of the tailor-bird type
(Mackworth-Praed and Grant, 1955).

The first and most obvious point to be made is that tool-using in birds
is rare. Out of about 8,600 living species, the behaviour is known from
only twenty-six. Further research may reveal more; there are no records
so far from the mainland Neotropics, the richest zoogeographical region
for birds. Of the two dozen tool-users, eight have been observed using
tools only in captivity. And of the remaining eighteen free-living
implement-wielders ten have been seen using a tool on only one occasion.
This leaves the Black-breasted Buzzard whose egg-breaking proclivities
require confirmation, and seven other birds that probably or certainly use
tools with some frequency in the wild. These are: the Egyptian Vulture,
Palm Cockatoo, White-winged Chough, Satin Bower-bird, Brown-
headed Nuthatch, Orange-winged Sittella, and Galapagos Woodpecker
Finch.
Two species not only use tools but modify them in ways that merit the
term tool-making: the Northern Blue Jay and the Woodpecker Finch.
The making of tools is otherwise confined to man and a few non-human
primates such as the Chimpanzee.
Detailed scientific studies of these sophisticated avian behaviour
patterns have been made only of captive Northern Blue Jays and Wood-
pecker Finches and wild Egyptian Vultures and Brown-headed Nut-
hatches. Thus our overall knowledge of even the twenty-six birds known
to display these unusual propensities is slight.
Nevertheless the range of tools used and the spectrum of functions
those tools serve are both quite wide. Birds compare surprisingly well
with mammals in this respect, even including the non-human primates.
For a survey of mammalian tool-use see Lawick-Goodall (1970) (to which
Campbell (1977) adds an interesting record of a horse raking snow with
a stick). For the repertoire of weapon and tool use of the Chimpanzee,
which uses the objects of its environment as tools to a greater extent than

any other living animal except Homo sapiens&amp;gt; see Lawick-Goodall (1971).
Incidentally the only other tool-using vertebrate is the Archer Fish
Toxotes jaculatrix. The only invertebrates with similar abilities are spiders
of several genera (J. A. L. Cooke, pers. comm.) and the following insects:
solitary wasps of the genus Ammophila , ant lions Myrmeleon sp. and worm
lions of the genera Lampromyia and Vermilio (Alcock 1972, Wilson 1975);
also the ant Aphaenogaster rudis (Fellers and Fellers 1976).

Birds that use tools in captivity may not do so in the wild; for example
Smith (1971) suggested that individually-caged parrots of highly social
species in which allopreening is particularly well developed, may have

come to use scratchers as a result of their isolation. Similarly, free-living
Northern Blue Jays may well not use tools. Jones and Kamil (1973)
thought it a fair conclusion that their jays acquired tool-using ability while
maintained under a particular set of circumstances--short rations, food
pellets just out of reach and newspaper available under the cage. It is not
difficult to believe that the stone-throwing and flailing behaviour of the
captive Bald Eagles also arose because the birds were tethered.
What are the relative roles of instinct and learning--nature and nurture
--in tool-using? It seems fairly safe to attribute individual cases in well
studied species, such as the wild American Robin, Blackbird, Blue Tit
and Double-crested Cormorant, to learning, either by trial-and-error or
by insight learning. The same conclusion might be drawn tentatively in
regard to most captive eagles and psittacids, only one of which is known
to use instruments in the wild and whose behaviour in confinement is
probably attributable to the special conditions. The "towel*'-using owl is
a puzzling case, and it is hardly possible at present to comment meaning-
fully on such comparatively little-studied birds as the six Australasian
species (parrot, crow, chough, Australian nuthatch, shrike-tit and thrush)
and three of the Galapagos finches.
This leaves us with the unproven case of the Black-breasted Buzzard,
with the Brown-headed Nuthatch and the Satin Bower-bird, and with the
experimental studies of wild Egyptian Vultures and captive Galapagos
Woodpecker Finches.
Morse (1968), student of implement-wielding Brown-headed Nut-
hatches, offered no opinion as to the basis of his birds' behaviour. Marshall
(1954) considered the construction and painting of bowers to be heritable.
The work of Jane van Lawick-Goodall on the vultures was not specifi-
cally designed to establish whether stone-throwing was inherited or
acquired, but she did conclude that it was the normal response of many
of the birds to egg-shaped objects that could not be picked up, even when
they were larger than any living bird's egg and even when they were red or
green! She expressed the intention to rear a young bird away from its
kind to find out if the impulse is inborn. "We feel quite sure it is not" she
wrote (1968), "for once we saw a young Egyptian Vulture try for 30 mins,
to peck open an Ostrich egg. When he gave up, an even younger bird
moved in, picked up a stone, and broke the egg in six minutes".
The twig-probing technique of the Woodpecker Finch was considered
by Eibl-Eibesfeldt (1964b) to be an innate behaviour pattern the successful
application of which, however, required refinement by learning. A male
bird he acquired when it was quite young did not develop the skill fully
at first. It searched for sticks, probed in crevices and holes, but only in a
playful manner after feeding. When it saw an insect in a crack, it dropped
the stick and attempted to catch it with its bill. The bird learned to use
the tool for this purpose only gradually.

The notes I have collected on this subject over the years were in connection with
my work at the BBC Natural Etistory Unit, particularly in researching for such
programmes as Wildlife Safari to Ethiopia, Wild World and The Animal Game and
acknowledgement is thus due to the BBC. I am also grateful to E. A. Armstrong,
Geo. A. Smith, C. B. Frith, Janet Kear, Lance Tickell and A. Kortlandt for help
and encouragement; and to Joan Whittock, one of the world's most helpful
librarians. Kathryn Adie kindly undertook the translation of Holmberg (1957)
from the Swedish, and Steven Shemeld part of Curio and Kramer (1964) from the
German. Copies of these translations are deposited in the Alexander Library at
Oxford. I am grateful to the following for unpublished observations: L. F. Alder,
M. Coombes, J. P. Kruijt, and R. J. Prytherch. For the use of photographs grateful
acknowledgement is made to J. P. Kruijt (African Grey Parrot), Dave Norris
(Green Heron), and Alan Root and Survival-Anglia Ltd. (Galapagos Woodpecker
Finch). For permission to reproduce drawings thanks are offered to Ronald L.
Orenstein and the editor of The Auk (New Caledonian Crow), and to C. Binder,
Jane van Lawick-Goodall and Academic Press Ltd. (Bald Eagle). Robin J. Pry-
therch specially drew the Egyptian Vulture from the BBC film shot by Douglas
Fisher, and the Satin Bower-bird from Norman Chaffer's photograph in Marshall
(i960). My debt to previous reviewers of avian tool-using, particularly A. H.
Chisholm, W. H. Thorpe and Jane van Lawick-Goodall is obvious.

By D. H. S. Risdon (Rode, Somerset)
The last two years have not been our best as far as breeding results are
concerned. I was inclined to blame the long hot dry summer of 1976--
until this year, which has been one of the wettest and coldest for a long
time. It would seem that either way one cannot win, for this season has been
even less productive, particularly among parrots and pheasants.
Sarus Cranes have been one of the exceptions, largely due to the hard
work put in by the keepers in rearing from hatching time. Four young
were reared in 1976 and this year at the time of writing (September 1977)
we have one nearly full grown and another about a month old.
We partly reared a young Demoiselle Crane in 1976 but when it was
half-grown we unwisely thought we could run it with two of the young
Sarus of about the same size who promptly attacked and wounded it so
badly that it died. Young Sarus are little devils from the time they hatch:
they try to murder each other almost at once and have to be reared
separately. Oddly enough, when older, they mix freely without trouble.
This year the Demoiselles have made no attempt to nest. Success with
Crowned Cranes still eludes us. They dance and go through the motions
of nest-building but that is as far as it goes, even though they have free
range with every choice of nesting site. During last year's drought when
all the grass died, the place looked remarkably like their native habitat in
Africa during the dry season, but it made no difference.
White Storks have not repeated their previous success: last year their
eggs were infertile and this year they did not lay at all.
Sacred Ibises reared three young in 1976 and three more this year.
Little Egrets produced one in 1977. Scarlet Ibises have nested but did
not lay: last year they laid but their eggs were infertile.
Cuban and Chilean Flamingos go one better step by step each year.
Last year they built several nests and laid one egg which was infertile.

and this year we really thought they were in earnest, as they built six nests
and laid five eggs, but none hatched. Perhaps next year?
Cape Penguins continue to lay regularly and hatch chicks at almost any
time of the year, but the young never seem to survive beyond a week or
ten days. I suspect aspergillosis, to which the little chicks may not be
immune. The difficulty is to get a dead chick fresh enough to send for
post mortem examination. When found they are invariably squashed in
the nest and in an advanced state of decomposition.
1976 was a good year for Rheas, six young being reared under lamps.
This year we decided to let the cocks incubate but it was not very success-
ful. One cock did actually hatch three chicks but they became lost in the
long grass and by the time they were rescued, they were too far gone to
survive.
Our pair of One-wattled Cassowaries are a problem. They are in-
compatible except during the laying period, after which the hen turns
savagely on the cock and they have to be separated. Last year she laid
seven beautiful green eggs, all of which proved infertile. This year she
laid three in the shelter so we decided to let the cock incubate. Un-
fortunately the keepers thought she had not finished laying and did not
remove her soon enough, so she suddenly turned on the cock and
frightened him so much that he stopped brooding. The eggs were clear
anyway, and frankly I am not surprised. The poor little cock (and he is
little compared with his virago of a wife) is in much the same position as
the male praying mantis or the male spider whose sex life is fraught with
peril.
European Eagle Owls reared two young in 1976 and two in 1977. King
Vultures raise our hopes every year by going through the motions of
building a nest, but that is as far as they get. There is some doubt as to
whether they are a true pair.
Waterfowl have been patchy. Emperor Geese produced four young in
1976 and none in 1977; Ross's Geese reared three in 1976 and five in 1977.
There would have been six but a Mink got in and killed one. This is the
first visitation we have had from these pests which are apparently quite
common on the river Frome. Barnacle, Lesser White-fronted and Bar-
headed Geese have all produced young.
Among the ducks, apart from the commoner species, Maned Geese,
Red-billed Whistling and European Eiders have produced a fair crop of
ducklings, particularly the whistling duck which, once they get going,
seem remarkably prolific. They are experts at hiding their nests, very often
right under our noses, and have to be watched most carefully before they
give the game away. They have an advantage in that they start to lay later
in the season than other ducks, which means that after the spring rush,
the keepers have more time to devote to their rearing. We have kept some
full-winged and so far they are staying well, coming in to land like small
helicopters with a downward hovering flight which is quite unducklike.

230 D. H. S. RISDON--THE TROPICAL BIRD GARDENS 1976-1977
White-faced Whistling Ducks are not so prolific with us and their
ducklings don't seem as hardy and easy to rear; nevertheless we have
some nice broods. Maned Geese bred well: we tried some full-winged but
they wander after a while, mainly at nesting time when they go off pros-
pecting and don't come back--that is to say the females go and the males
follow them. The obvious thing to do is to keep full-winged males only
and now that we have learned how to sex the day-old ducklings, this
should not be difficult.
Both whistling ducks and Maned Geese would, I think, make excellent
parents, as both sexes guard the young, but our biggest problem is the
Herons which have learned to come in daily for the penguins' sprats, not
to mention the dead day old chicks fed to the Secretary Birds and storks.
This started years ago when we used to accept young Herons which had
fallen out of the nest, feed them and when they were independent, release
them on the lake. They quickly learned that life at Rode was easier than
hunting for themselves and refused to leave; what is more they told their
pals and sometimes I have counted as many as eight Herons waiting
around at feeding time. I now regret our original kindness as the wretched
birds systematically polish off any ducklings which hatch from nests
which the keepers have inadvertently missed.
In spite of this, our full-winged flock of Carolinas seem to keep their
numbers up and at this time of year (autumn) we can usually count up to
50 birds at feeding time.
After many years of trial and error, the only pheasants we keep at
liberty in any numbers are Golden and Reeves's. These seem compatible
and do not fight. Inevitably some of them stray in the spring when the
cocks become territorial, but otherwise they stay well and in the autumn
and winter they give us a blaze of colour. We can usually manage to hold
two or three cock Amherst's at liberty and a few Sonnerat's Jungle Fowl:
the latter are as static as Red Jungle Fowl. A cock Sonnerat's paired with
a hen bantam and we are rearing some chicks from their eggs: it will be
interesting to see what they turn out like. Mention of hybrids reminds me
of a Reeves's x Silver cock which we have had for some years. This
occurred "naturally" between a cock Reeves's and a hen Silver at liberty
and was in fact reared by the hen Silver. Unfortunately it inherited the
bad temper of both parents and in the end became such a bully that it had
to be confined to an aviary. It resembles a large Silver with a longer tail
and the white plumage is more heavily freckled and striped in black. It
always causes comment from pheasant-minded visitors and it is fun asking
them to guess its parentage.
Thanks to the help and co-operation of Major Iain Grahame we have
at last managed to form a true pair of Argus Pheasants by exchanging one
of our two cocks for the young hen which he bred last year. Other new
arrivals have been a pair of Siamese Firebacks bred by Newton Steel and
a pair of Satyr Tragopans.

D. H. S. RISDON--THE TROPICAL BIRD GARDENS 1976-1977 231
Peacock Pheasants have been a great disappointment* no chicks having
been reared during the last two seasons. After so many successful years
with this species* I can only put it down to the fact that the stock has
become too inbred. Blue Crossoptilons are erratic* breeding well in
alternate years and seeming to take a rest in between. Himalayan Monals
are another disappointment. Try as we will we cannot seem to find a
fertile cock. The hens lay but after a succession of three or four cocks* all
from different sources* all we get are infertile eggs. The birds have a
paddock to themselves about half the size of a tennis court with plenty of
trees and undergrowth; whereas we frequently hear of successful breeders
whose birds inhabit pens no bigger than chicken runs!
We regularly breed a number of North American Wild Turkeys. Our
original stock of these handsome birds came from Whipsnade. In many
ways they are as beautiful as peafowl* and far less noisy! They make
excellent liberty birds except at nesting time when the hens often persist
in laying away outside the Fox-proof fence* never to be seen again.
Among the parrots our macaws must take pride of place. We now have
three breeding pairs of Blue and Yellow consisting of our old original
pair* and two of their male offspring mated to imported hens. Scarlets
consist of one adult breeding pair and two of their offspring (sex uncertain)
mated to imported birds but as yet too young to breed. Green-winged
consist of one breeding pair and two other adult pairs which have not yet
bred. It is interesting to note that two of these are birds bred by John
Rigge of Cumberland about eight years ago. It is also most satisfying to
note that our own home bred macaws are superior specimens to their
imported parents. This year we bred seven young ones and last year five.
We are now the proud possessors of our first pair of Hyacinthine Macaws
which we received in exchange.
Leadbeater's Cockatoos bred two fine youngsters; Lesser Sulphur-
crests one. Roseates* Umbrellas* Citron-crests* Tritons and Moluccans
did nothing. Australian parrakeets have never done so badly* apart from
producing a few Stanley and Mealy Rosellas. Lutino Ringnecks have
produced a fair number of young and the Derbyans reared one. Last year
two pairs of Plumheads reared six young: this year they did nothing.
One of our nicest successes last year was the breeding of three young
Black-headed Caiques. This occurred among four compatible birds which
we assume are two pairs. However* since they all pile into one nest box
at night* although they have the choice of several* we haven't a clue as to
which are the parents. So far all seven birds get on well but they did not
breed again this year.
White-cheeked Touracos bred three nice young ones which we have
kept to mate to others. These seem to be the best "doers" of all the
touracos* with us at any rate.
An interesting hybrid was bred last year between a Purple Glossy and
a Green Glossy Starling. The hybrid takes after the Purple in colour but

its eyes are less prominent and the head is rounder--more like that of the
Green parent.
Occipital Blue Pies have not repeated their successes of previous years,
partly I think because we lost our old breeding hen. Red-vented Bulbuls
are rearing young at the time of writing and Silver Blue Tanagers also
have a chick in the nest. We have two Formosan Blue Pies which do not
agree and are probably two cocks. If anyone reading this knows of a spare
hen, we should be very glad to hear from them. We also need a cock for a
believed hen Swainson's Blue Jay which was loaned to us as a mate for
our old cock. He has recently died after fifteen years with us and we
should be glad to replace him.

HAND-REARING A BLACK KORHAAN Afrotis afro, afroides

In 1970 the Berlin Zoo was successful in hand-rearing three Senegal
Bustards Eupodotis senegalensis (see Johst, Elisabeth: Die Haltung und
kiinstliche Aufzucht der Senegal-Trappe, gefiederte welt, Vol. 96
(1972), p. 61-64). The experience gained on this occasion helped us to
raise a Black Korhaan which hatched in July this year.
The adult Black Korhaans are kept in an indoor aviary (3.50 x 2.20m)
and during summer time the birds have access to a heavily planted outdoor
cage. They receive a diet consisting of a high quality softbill food,
different millets and other grains, salad and fruits, and in addition a lot
of insects. In July the hen laid one egg which was put into an incubator.
After 23 days the chick hatched, and in the first weeks it was kept in a
heated raising-box.
On the hatching day it was given only two white mealworms and three
flies; the bill was dipped into milk. From the second day on the chick
readily took mealworms and other insects. Due to our experience in
raising Great Bustards, we had to pay attention not to give too much
food. During the following days and weeks the chick's diet consisted of
chicken-meal mixed with cream-cheese, boiled egg-yolk and vitamins;
also insects and some young mice were given every day.
After four weeks the young Black Korhaan fed on its own, and since
then it has developed very well.

When I was first asked by our Editor to review this book I thought,
"What, another one on pheasants?", but once I got into it I found it
compulsive reading. That perhaps is the sincerest praise I can give to a
well written, up to date and informative work.
The book, as the author states in his introduction, is a study of
pheasants which are rare in captivity rather than in the wild. It is essen-
tially written for the aviculturist, which is very welcome.
Apart from brief descriptions and references as to habitat, the accent is
on care and propagation of rare pheasants in our aviaries. The needs of
each species are dealt with individually instead of the usual "feeding and
treatment as for . .." which is sometimes the case with books of this kind.
The text is excellent. All the latest information on pheasant culture
seems to have been collated, but it was at the Antwerp Zoo, not in Holland,
that most if not all the work of re-constituting the Imperial Pheasant was
done.
The illustrations, whilst obviously done with great attention to detail,
are not the best part of the book, but they give a fair idea of the birds'
appearance. They are mainly black and white drawings which, un-
fortunately, can never convey the brilliant colours of pheasants. There
are 27 line drawings by the author and two pages in full colour.
There are 15 chapters of which the first five are devoted to conservation,
accommodation, feeding, breeding and diseases. I would have thought
(p. 8) that uprights measuring 4&quot; x 4&quot; in section were a bit massive for a
pheasant enclosure and, with the price of timber today, as expensive as
thinner and lighter metal.
On page 9 the descriptions of aviary foundations, whilst sound enough,
could be so expensive as to put many people off. A cheaper way of keeping
out vermin is by covering the floor with wire netting and either letting the
grass grow up through or covering it with sand or soil.
There are some excellent diagrams and plans of aviary layouts and the
author has taken pains to suggest plantings of shrubs, bamboos, etc. to
resemble the birds' natural habitat. The landscaping of enclosures is also
discussed in detail. Although I suppose this will not be popular with
overseas readers, I was pleased to note that Mr. Roles has avoided the
metric system and has given his measurements in good old feet and inches,
thus instantly conveying, to my mind at least, the idea of size.
I was also pleased about the importance he attaches to the "rapport"
between the birds and their keepers: this is livestock sense at its best.
In the chapter on the Great Argus Pheasant Mr. Roles states that

"The nominate form is represented in the U.K. by a single pair in the
aviaries of Major Iain Grahame; the subspecies A. a. greyi by a single
pair at the Pheasant Trust." I know of at least two other pairs--one at
The Tropical Bird Gardens, Rode* and another at Bird Paradise in
Cornwall.
I would thoroughly recommend this book as an addition to the library
of all pheasant enthusiasts.

ENCYCLOPAEDIA OF AVICULTURE, Vol. 3. Edited by A. Rutgers,
K. A. Norris and C. H. Rogers. 1977. Blandford Press, Poole,
Dorset. 241 pp., 44 colour plates, many text figures. #12.
The third and last volume of this encyclopaedia is now available, the
first volume having appeared in 1970, at two-thirds the price of the
present volume. K. A. Norris, who was editing the English text, died
while the volume was in preparation and Cyril Rogers took over com-
pletion of the text. It is similar in style to the previous volumes, but has
the problem of covering a larger and more diverse range of families,
including not only all the passerines but also colies, trogons and the
coraciform and piciform families.
The pattern is that of earlier volumes. It begins, however, with a
general section on the diet of soft-billed and seed-eating birds, and the
accommodation of softbills. Subsequently each family is introduced by a
general text on the group and its needs as regards food and housing.
These texts are by various authors, those for the soft-billed birds relying
heavily on H. E. Bates and R. L. Busenbark. Following the introductions,
selected individual species are dealt with. In view of the number of groups
to be covered there has been an attempt to assign text space and number
of individual species covered according to relative avicultural importance:
for example, flowerpeckers have a single species and no introduction,
while white-eyes and nuthatches have an introduction and two species
each. The result shows some odd disparities however. The waxbill family
has 50 pages which seems a lot, even when one allows for their popularity,
while the unobtainable lyrebirds and scrub-birds have two pages and the
rarely imported South American ovenbird family another two; but there
is no mention of the larks, wagtails, shrikes, dunnocks, wrens or warblers.
Only 20 of the 41 passerine families are included. In some respects this
is an encyclopaedia of a certain kind of aviculture, and not the subject in
its broadest sense.
The text for individual species suffers a little, as in earlier volumes,
from an uncertainty as to whether this is an encyclopaedia of birds or of
bird-keeping; but usually includes information on known captive keeping

and breeding. Presumably because of changes in avian taxonomy since the
original Dutch edition, in sections such as the waxbills the better known
subspecies are treated as though they were separate species. In one
instance this has produced an unfortunate confusion. Lonchura striata is
subdivided into the Sharp-tailed Munia and White-rumped Mannikin,
the Bengalese Finch being stated (correctly I think) to be a domesticated
form of the former race; but a few pages earlier the Bengalese is given a
separate entry, in the text of which it is stated to be both a domesticated
form of the Striated Mannikin Lonchura striata and a fertile hybrid of
several Lonchura species.
Six pages are devoted to the canary and this section includes a very
useful summary of feather pigmentation and the rather complex termin-
ology that has evolved for referring to it. The Zebra Finch has a page and a
half of text, and both species have a colour plate of varieties.
The colour plates are disappointing, giving a passable but not a good
representation of the birds, and space is rather wasted. Occasionally the
colouring has gone astray, and I did not recognise a Blue-billed Firefinch
with a pale blue crown and green wings. The many bird sketches in the
text are sometimes fairly good, sometimes really bad, and in the copy I
examined, all were over-inked.
In summary, the books contain a great deal of work and information,
and would be a useful introduction to the subject for anyone who was
unfamiliar with both birds and bird-keeping; but they have tried to do
too much and, for me at least, have not succeeded. I have the uneasy
feeling that if I needed detailed and practical information on the keeping
of any group of species, I might start with a glance at this work but would
need to look elsewhere for the definitive source that I required.

very practical advice on accommodation, feeding, breeding and hand-
rearing, as well as on the natural history of these birds; also an extensive
bibliography and an appendix of names in four languages. The book is
illustrated by 21 very good colour photographs taken by Rosemary Low's

is rare to find all the information one needs on a particular group of birds

Due to a misunderstanding, the hybrid hummingbird bred by Mr. R. J.
Elgar was described (no. 3, p. 130) as Brown Violetear x Sparkling or
Green Violetear, C. coruscans . The female parent was actually Colibri
thalassinus, the current common name of which is Green Violetear, and
the description and range given apply, of course, to this species.
THE 1977 BREEDING REGISTER

CORRESPONDENCE
INTRODUCED LOVEBIRDS IN MOMBASA
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999106259259259" page_id="56386600"  page_num="238" year="" vol="">
In 1975 there was an exchange of correspondence between J. C.
Barlass (A. M.,1 and 4) and Malcolm Ellis (A. M., 2) regarding introduced
lovebirds in East Africa.
From March 4th to 7th this year, I was in Mombasa, guest of my
friend Mr. Alfredo Santagati, who lives in a beautiful villa with a large
patio facing the beach.
Lovebirds were common amongst the palms and the other trees in the
garden, where they were also attracted by a small feeding table refilled
daily. Contrary to the observations of J. C. Barlass and M. Ellis, the
majority of the birds I saw were A. per sonata; only a small percentage of
A.fischeri and a few crosses between the two.
Very early in the morning it was possible to count not less than 80-100
subjects perched side by side on the electricity wires behind the house,
where they used to spend some time sunning and preening themselves.
I was unable to locate nests in hollow trees, only under the eaves of a
small veranda contiguous to the kitchen (a pullus fallen from the nest had
been hand-reared by Mrs. Santagati and was able to repeat a few words)
and, very unusual, in small cavities in a cliff 8-10 metres high over-
looking the beach. With the tide coming in the sea reached the base of the
rock against which the waves broke. I was able to locate two such nests,
guided by the voices of the young, but it was impossible for me, due to
lack of the necessary equipment and the thorny low vegetation, to approach
closely and observe the internal structure. I took a picture of the spot, but
unfortunately I am not a good photographer and the picture did not
develop.
Mr. Santagati told me that the lovebirds disappear with the rainy
season, retiring probably to the interior.

ANNUAL MEETING -- 17th SEPTEMBER 1977
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.982909555555555" page_id="56386601"  page_num="239" year="" vol="">
Members and their guests gathered at the Cotswold Wildlife Park by
kind invitation of the owner, Mr. John Hey worth, and spent the morning
looking around this interesting collection in its outstandingly attractive
surroundings. There was much to admire and the beautifully landscaped
gardens gave as much pleasure and interest as the wildlife.
After luncheon, the Society's President, Dr. Jean Delacour, welcomed
everyone. He said that, as the oldest member of the Society, he had seen
many changes in aviculture over the years, and that circumstances today
are very different from those of even thirty years ago. He very much
hoped that the members would do and say much more for the Society.
Mr. W. Timmis, curator of the North of England Zoological Society,
gave a most interesting talk, illustrated by slides, of breeding successes
and failures at Chester Zoo, and was able to show slides of the birds'
native habitat which he had taken in his travels round the world.
A short General Meeting followed at which the Honorary Secretary
and Treasurer, Mr. H. J. Horswell, reported that, from a state of virtual
bankruptcy some five years ago, the Society was now solvent with some
money in hand, and a healthy membership of 641 as well as 219 sub-
scribers. With the move to larger premises there would be room to
catalogue and store properly the enormous quantity of back numbers, as
there was a large potential sales demand for them which it had not been
possible to meet hitherto because of lack of space to sort. The Honorary
Secretary reminded members that the Society was essentially inter-
national in character and that, for over half the members, who lived
overseas, the Magazine was the only benefit that they received. Publishing
the Magazine was, therefore, the Society's most important function, and
he appealed for more material, however short. The meeting passed a vote
of thanks to the Honorary Editor, Mr. J. Yealland, for all his work in
maintaining the Magazine's high standard.
The Honorary Secretary reminded members that they were entitled to
propose members to the Council.
It was agreed that the Rules of the Society should be revised and re-
published in the Magazine, and members were asked to send in their
suggestions for revisions.

OBITUARY
DAVID REID HENRY
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.992706772727272" page_id="56386602"  page_num="240" year="" vol="">
Members will have been saddened to hear of the death of David Reid
Henry (D. M. Henry) in Rhodesia on 26th September 1977 at the age of 57.
David Reid Henry was one of the greatest painters of bird life of our
time, perhaps of all time, and his paintings hang in many important
collections all over the world. Mr. Fred Barnicoat, who met David
recently in Johannesburg, reminds us that over 30 colour plates by D. M.
Henry have appeared in our Magazine, the first in 1951, the year that
David became a member of the Society. He also contributed articles,
written in a fluent and interesting style and demonstrating his great
knowledge of aviculture. Less well known than his ability as a falconer
was the fact that he had a natural talent for rearing birds but he was
particularly perceptive and gifted in this field. In his recent home in
Rhodesia he lived among the most wonderful bird life as he had done in
his youth in Ceylon, where his father, G. M. Henry, also a well-known
bird painter, worked at the Colombo Museum. Recently he was married,
for the second time, to Dr. Louise Westwater who is Provincial Medical
Officer of Health for Mashonaland and whom he had known for many
years. We send our deepest sympathy to her and to his father and family.
He will be greatly missed by all his friends, but the paintings he leaves
behind will remind us always of his colourful personality, his generosity
and his indifference to mundane concepts.

By Siem van 'T Hart (Capelle a/d Ijssel, Holland)
I had two Bald Starlings for about eight months and had some reason
to hope that they were a pair, for some nests were built by them. On
June 19th 1977 I found that two eggs had been laid in a nest built inside
a hollow log measuring 35 x 25 cm with an entrance hole 7J cm in
diameter. The colour and pattern of the eggs reminded me rather of the
eggs of the Lapwing, being dull green with some blackish and reddish
blotches. After 13 days one chick hatched; the second egg had disappeared.
The young bird was fed on mealworms, but I was able to get some fresh
deep-frozen ants' eggs; also some house crickets. After seven days I
added some of the crickets and grasshoppers collected in the country, but
later I stopped giving these for fear that they were too indigestible for the
young bird. The total diet consisted of mealworms, house crickets, the
ants' eggs, fruits and the "universal" insectile mixture. The chick left the
nest on July 29th, 23 days after hatching. It was in colour very like the
parents.
The pair nested a second time, but when, after 16 days, there was no
evidence of hatching, I inspected the nest and found the three eggs it
contained to be cold, but on opening one I found a live chick nearly
ready to hatch, so I repaired the egg as best I could and replaced it in the
nest, but by next day all the eggs had vanished. A week later there was a
new egg in the same nest and two more were laid, a single chick hatching
some 14 days after commencement of incubation. This chick appeared to
grow much faster than the first, for it left the nest a week earlier. Now
(mid-November) the birds have another nest containing three eggs.
The Bald Starlings live in an aviary of some 72 square yards, a third of
which is planted and there is a small pool. The aviary is shared with a
Livingstone's Touraco and a species of crowned pigeon.

Zoster ops palpebrosa
By R. P. Brinkmann (Bury St. Edmunds, Suffolk)
In September 1976 I purchased a pair of Indian White-eyes from a
friend who was giving up his birds and, as I had not previously kept this
species, I at first followed the diet that he had given them and also offered
them a variety of foods in order to see what they preferred. The diet that
I give to my other insectivorous birds appeared to suit them: it consists
of minced hard-boiled egg or grated cheese, Haith's fine grade softbill
food, grated carrot or chopped chickweed, sweet biscuit, honey, kelp
(seaweed) tablets, alfalfa tablets and soya meal. This is mixed daily and
made to a crumbly moist consistency and in addition to it I give honey
and water, with a little Marmite added, and fruit such as banana, pear,
apple, orange and grapes. I found that the birds preferred oranges and
pears; the soft food they ate readily and they consumed all the honey
water as soon as it was given, but above all else they liked spiders and
mealworms.
I kept the pair in a cage in my unheated birdroom through the winter
and found them to be hardy, for on several nights I recorded a temperature
of minus 5*C and they appeared not to be distressed by the cold, so, as
they were evidently hardier than I had expected, I let them out one
favourable day in mid-March into an aviary which measured 4 x 10x6 feet
high with the roof and top two feet of the sides covered with a plastic
sheeting. The interior supporting posts are covered with bark because a
Nuthatch shares the aviary, and ivy and nettles grow inside, with long
grass surrounding a small pool. Nettles and other plants such as hops
attract the greenfly, a favourite food of all the species of white-eye. For
nesting sites I wire branches from floor to roof and at different heights I
fix bunches of evergreens such as box and yew. In April I put cotton-wool,
moss, coconut fibre and dried grass into the aviary and it was on April 8th
that I first noticed the white-eyes taking cotton-wool to one of the bunches
of evergreens and when I looked two or three days later I found a beautiful
nest in the branches. It reminded me of a Goldfinch's nest and it was
made almost entirely of the cotton-wool with a little moss and a base of
coconut fibre, very well concealed and three feet from the ground. At this
time there was some snow on the ground and the weather quite cold, so
I was concerned about the birds nesting under such conditions. On
April 17th, on noticing that one of the birds was missing, I very carefully
inspected the site and found the hen sitting: the weather had by then
improved and on the 22nd while the bird was off the nest I noticed that it
contained four white eggs. On the 27th I noticed the birds moving actively
about the aviary and searching for something, so I inspected the nest and

found that there were two chicks and two eggs.
Now commenced my problem of finding enough food in the form of
live insects for them. I first gave plenty of fruit and extra soft food; also
more small mealworms which they soon picked up and took to the brood.
It was then that I discovered their liking for earthworms, for when I
moved a water dish which had stood on the ground, one of the birds came
and picked up a small worm. It took the bird about ten minutes to break
up the worm and to feed the pieces to the young ones, so I found more
worms and cut them into small pieces which both parents took to the
chicks. Their most favoured food was spiders and I managed to collect
15 or 20 each day, cutting the larger ones into small pieces to save the
parents work. I was hoping to find some greenfly, but the weather had
checked their spread and only a few were found on the roses. Whiteworms
were offered daily, but these were ignored.
On the 30th I removed the two eggs and found them to be infertile.
By May 3rd the young could be heard calling when being fed: I was then
supplying about ten mealworms and any other live food I could find every
three or four hours. On the 9th I noticed that the young were getting
restless and as the nest was only three feet from the door, I could see
them looking over the edge of the nest whenever I went with food. In
the early afternoon I heard some loud calls and found one young bird
flying about the aviary and the other sitting on the edge of the nest and
begging for food. As the parents were feeding the first chick, the second
tried to fly from the nest, but it landed on the ground, though within a
minute it had gained enough strength to get up to a perch where it was
quickly rewarded by one of the parents with some food.
The two young were light grey on the underparts, slaty grey-green on
the back and wings with a tinge of yellow on the throat and the area
around the eyes including the white ring was like that of the adults. On
May 14th I noticed that another nest was being constructed, this time
under the old site about a foot from the ground, so as the parents were
still feeding the two young ones, they were kept busy. There was one egg
on the 17th and by the 20th the hen was sitting on a clutch of four. On
the morning of the 30th I saw one egg had hatched, but by next day the
nest was empty and I could find no sign of the young. Two days later the
pair were busy building again, so on June 6th I caught the two juveniles
which were consuming a lot of the live food. These two looked to be a
pair, one being slightly duller in colour than the other and neither so
distinctly coloured as the parents. By June 9th two eggs had been laid
and on the nth the clutch was complete. Twelve days later there were
two young and two eggs in the nest: at this time the weather was favourable
and there was plenty of live food, but again I was disappointed, for the
young disappeared when three days old. By July 9th the pair had built
another nest, this time about four feet from the ground and in a clump of
box branches. Four eggs were laid when this more flimsy nest collapsed

and the eggs were broken. By July 22nd another nest had been built
about six inches under the previous one and by the 29th the hen was
sitting, so I did not disturb her and twelve days later there was one chick
and three eggs. I noticed that the nest was not well built, but I left it as it
was and next day it had turned on its side and the young were on the
ground, so I wired the nest back in place and as soon as I had put the
chicks back inside and left the aviary, the parents came to feed them and
that evening the mother was brooding them, but next day the four young
were dead.
The pair started to build yet another nest, but did not complete it and
by the end of August they had started to moult. Though I have had such
disappointing results from the five nests, I have learnt a lot about the
birds' behaviour when breeding and I recorded that the incubation period
was 12 to 13 days and fledging about 16 days from hatching. Both adults
and young had a full moult in August. I feel sure that in time I shall be
able to get a breeding strain going, for these birds are very willing to go
to nest, so it is a matter of finding the reasons for desertion.
THE RED-BILLED LEIOTHRIX: A FOUR-YEAR STUDY
By L. Gibson (Burnaby, B.C. Canada)
Leiothrix lutea is known by a variety of misleading common names--
Pekin Robin, Pekin Nightingale, Japanese Nightingale and Hill Robin.
The bird comes from nowhere near Pekin or Japan and scarcely has the
range of song of the Nightingale, though it does have a very pleasant short
song. It ranges along the Himalayas from Nepal eastward into south-
western China and northern Burma, being fairly common in the Himalayan
foothills, so Hill Robin is perhaps rather apt, though the bird is not a
robin, but a babbler. It would be interesting to know what it is called in
China and other parts of its range. It is fairly widespread in the Hawaiian
Islands, Hawaii, Maui and Oahu where it was introduced in 1911. It was
one of the many introductions of birds to those islands and some of them
no doubt displaced unique indigenous birds, some now extinct, though I
suspect the introduced Mongoose as the major culprit.
These notes are from a four-year study of the Red-billed Leiothrix,
mainly in my aviary, plus a short study of some wild birds in Hawaii.
The notes are on two pairs of birds of my own (plus about a dozen fledged
chicks) and on eight other birds in the vicinity. My own birds are an "old"
pair and a hen young one which I kept; also a young cock of a different
subspecies (larger and brighter) paired to the young hen. These will be
referred to as the old pair and the young pair. Observations were greatly
aided by the fact that the old cock was partly scalped by an old fight
wound; otherwise it would have been difficult to determine which parent
was feeding, brooding and so on.

In the wild this bird is very elusive. On one trip in the south of the
island of Hawaii I noted 19 birds calling, but caught a glimpse of only
two. They kept well inside thickets of bamboo and other foliage under
the shade of large trees and their inconspicuous colouring made them
invisible. When they do have to cross an open space, the flight is weak.
An escaped bird in my garden behaved in this way, for they are truly
birds of the thickets and they have the ability to "about face" on a perch
faster than the eye can follow. They are happiest in a densely planted
aviary and will show this by nesting readily in the foliage. The natural
range is well watered hillsides with plenty of shrubby cover and they are
said to favour conifer forests at subtropical to temperate elevations.
Health and disease
The Pekin Robins were and still are among the healthiest and most
disease free birds in my collection. In the four or five years of observing
a number of adult birds, only two have died and unfortunately these two
were not examined to determine the cause of death. The losses among
fledged young in 1976 were solely due to accidents (drowning) which
could have been prevented. My original pair and the young pair have
never been sick and the only disease entity ever recorded for them was a
moderately heavy infection of the intestinal protozoan Coccidia (in the old
pair when they were first acquired). Coccidiosis is contracted by the
ingestion of ripe cysts and these cysts develop to the infectious stage in
about 72 hours, depending on temperature, humidity and species, after
being passed in the bird's droppings. A severe infection is most likely
acquired from contaminated drinking water, usually in the cages at the
dealers' establishments in Asia and often added to at the wholesale and
retail premises--and too often at the hands of the aviculturist. Every
species of bird shipped from Asia that was examined by the writer had
varying degrees of coccidiosis: however, a light infection is harmless and
common and many local wild birds have it. Under hygienic conditions
the birds soon settled to a light infection and presumably still have it
(they are now elsewhere). It was never a problem in the young in spite
of the fact that they ate droppings at an early age. A well fed and cleanly
kept bird is not in any danger from a light infection of coccidiosis which
is difficult to eradicate--impossible in an aviary, but it tends to get less
under clean conditions. A careful study of Garrulax leucolophus the
White-crested Jay Thrush showed that the condition persisted for exactly
one year in the absence of re-infection or treatment and this is the longest
time noted, for previously it was thought to last up to about four months.
It should be noted that the Coccidia present in over 200 cage birds and
local wild passerines examined were all of the genus Isospora and this
type is not affected by sulphonamides listed in most books and articles as
cures for coccidiosis, for sulphas only affect the related genus Eimeria , a

type found in domestic pigeons and poultry, but this is outside the scope
of this paper.
Sexing and calling
The birds are very much alike, but the cock is brighter about the head
and has a brighter red on the wing than the hen. There are about half a
dozen subspecies and the old cock would pass for a hen of the brighter
coloured young cock. The birds are never still, so sexing them by colour
could be difficult. It is most likely, of course, that any one batch of birds
for sale will be all the same subspecies.
However, there is an easy way to sex them--simply imitate the hen
call, a simple two-syllable whistle repeated three to five times. Hens
respond immediately with the same call and cocks reply with a short
burst of song (about half the normal song). If you do not know what the
hen call is, separate the birds and keep them close by, but out of sight of
each other. They will immediately contact each other with either of the
above calls. The song is exclusive to the cock and the short loud penetrat-
ing notes to the hen. The birds can be sexed at two to three weeks of age
by this means, when the plumage is identical in both sexes. The birds
have two other calls, used by either sex. A noisy, scolding chatter is used
when they are alarmed but confident of safety: this is used when the nest
is being examined or when they see a cat. The other call few people will
have heard. It is an explosive short whistle on an ascending scale, used
when the bird is in real trouble. The chicks often use it when they are
caught for examination or transfer, and sometimes the parents use it
when the chicks are being chased. After they get used to this, they settle
down to the not-so-frightened chattering. The songs of the subspecies
differ a little, and the brighter, slightly larger cock has a bolder slightly
longer song than the other. You have to hear them together to note the
difference. In the absence of a tape-recording of the Hawaiian songs, I
was unable to tell if they were of the same type as either cock, or of a
third subspecies. The birds also use a single quiet chirp to communicate
in the foliage when close by each other. When close together, the hen will
also use a very quiet version of her normal call. This will also be used
sometimes by the cock and can cause confusion over which bird is which.
This call is barely audible at three metres distant and is never made
loudly by the cock as is the hen's normal call.
Diet and feeding habits
Pekin Robins are among the easiest of insectivorous birds to keep. They
settle down to eat whatever is offered. My staple food alternates between
scrambled egg and dog biscuit food (known here as kibble) with whatever
ripe fruit is available, oranges and banana being the main fruits offered.
The birds are fond of grapes and currants soaked in water; they also like
bread and cooked chicken. One person reported to me that one bird ate

an earthworm and this would certainly have solved the chick-feeding
problem, but I cannot get mine or any others to eat worms and they seem
only to like insects or the larvae with legs. They will not touch hard
beetles or legless creatures like the larvae of the crane fly ( Tipula) known
as leatherjackets--or very small insects like aphids. They are particularly
fond of spiders and smooth caterpillars. They eat ants only after per-
forming an anting action, i.e. rubbing the insect violently on the feathers
four or five times before consuming it. I do not know what their preference
for ants is, as these have only been offered a few times as a curiosity. The
ants were rubbed either on the body under an extended wing, or on the
outside primary feathers of a drooped wing. At the same time the birds
adopted a stilt-like stance on extended legs. Mealworms are liked, but
maggots are ignored, as is meat, raw or cooked. The birds persistently
eat dried droppings of their own, and of other birds. The chicks do this
from a few weeks of age. This seems a natural habit, and is unlikely to be
connected with a dietary deficiency, as well nourished birds on a varied
menu continue to do it. Only dried, hard droppings are consumed and I
have never found any particular reason for this. A study of birds in the
wild would probably shed some light on this. For instance it may be an
auxiliary food supply, and not just confined to bird droppings--these are
just the only kind available in the aviary. I have stopped short at experi-
menting with other kinds S
It is commonly observed that the birds will eat seed. Mine were not
offered seed, but when they are housed with finches, they will regularly
peck through the seed dishes, even when their normal food is on hand. It
has been stated by others that the seed passes through the birds undigested.
While investigating another problem, I happened on the fact that the
birds regularly take grit and also feed it to the chicks. Grit was therefore
always before them and I suspect that they digest much of the seed now.
Millet is the seed usually taken. While the birds are fond of fruit, I have
not found them to take greens from the feeding dish. They will often take
a piece of lettuce and play with it, but it is not consumed. In a planted
flight, however, they were seen to consume plants regularly. Mostly the
tips of succulent shoots were eaten, and they also were fond of pulling a
piece from a young grape vine leaf and eating it. No mature leaves or
stems were eaten. The birds were fairly destructive to soft plants, like
Impatient, although it was not ascertained if any of this was done just for
"fun". It is unlikely that the plants were dismembered in a search for
insects, as the birds proved surprisingly poor insect hunters in the con-
servatory. The aphids got so bad that Orange-breasted Waxbills were
put in and they had the place completely cleaned of tiny insect life in a
matter of days. The birds commonly use one foot to hold down large
pieces of food while they peck at it. They are not quarrelsome feeders and
do not keep other birds from the feeding dish, an important point in
mixed collections. The birds are not "earth-scratchers" and under

normal circumstances do not search for food or eat on the ground.
Mealworms are picked off the ground with the bird scarcely stopping. I
get the impression that in the wild they find most of their food without
leaving their beloved bushes. For this reason, the feeding stations are off
the ground in the aviary. The feeding of chicks will be dealt with later.

Maintenance and conditioning

<bodyText confidence="0.999851736842105" page_id="56386628"  page_num="8" year="" vol="">
The birds are hardy and easy to maintain in good condition. They will
nest readily provided four requirements are met (other than providing
basic food and shelter). These are adequate space, some dense cover,
{e.g. an evergreen bush), adequate bathing facilities and a mate. Adequate
space is a flight sufficiently large to accommodate the required greenery.
These active creatures are definitely not cage birds. The cover should be
twiggy or a tangle of vines. Certain conifers (such as Chamaecyparis) are
not suitable because of the upright growth of the leaf sprays, with the
lack of horizontal twigs. Daily clean water, or running water, in a large
dish, is one of the prime conditioning factors. The birds bathe daily,
even in winter, and several times a day in warm weather. Simply offering
a dish of clean water (warmed in winter) will often trigger bathing. The
last requirement of a mate is not solely for breeding purposes. For the
complete psychological well-being of these birds, they must have a mate.
Two birds of the same sex will keep each other company and dispel
boredom, but they are better with a mate. Keeping a single bird is a
tragedy. I get the impression that they mate for life. The pair stays
together all the year round. They will not tolerate other Leiothrix in the
aviary, although any number of the same sex may be kept, but even when
breeding they ignore other species.
It is reported that in the wild they form small flocks in winter. I should
think these would be made up of life-pairs, as I have never seen any birds
that remain so closely attached. Separating them causes consternation
and they constantly call to each other. Trying to switch mates (as when
I tried to introduce new blood) provokes bitter attacks from the resident
bird, cock or hen, even when the usual mate has been removed from
earshot. Indeed the old cock has a permanently featherless forehead as a
result of a violent fight when two pairs were put in the same aviary. All
four birds took part, and the cock was given to me as a hopeless case.
Half his scalp was torn off, as was one eyelid. These healed and the hen
fussed around him during his convalescence. I am convinced she did
much to give him the will to survive. His eye remains half-shut to this
day, giving him an unfortunately sinister appearance. These injuries
proved very useful when recording facts on the nesting and other be-
haviour, as the sex of the bird was immediately identifiable. A pair
constantly demonstrates affection especially by preening one another
around the neck feathers.
In common with the other Timaliinae (babblers), the birds roost

together the year round. This is useful and saves pressure on aviary space,
as for instance many Turdinae (thrushes) get violent with each other
outside (and sometimes during) the breeding season. Of course, as with
many other species, this intolerance of their own kind may dissipate in a
very large flight area, but I have no information on this. They may well
be less aggressive in the winter, as reported with wild birds, but I have
not risked testing this somewhat minor point. Being an unfussy feeder
and of hardy constitution, the Red-billed Leiothrix is easily kept even in
a large cage, but for breeding, the aforementioned criteria must be met.
A single specimen will seek company rather than roost alone and especially
in cold weather the birds will huddle at night with any sociable species.
The cock sings off and on all year, being rather quiet when nesting. I
have found no particular springtime singing spell prior to nesting. When
in breeding condition, both birds lose the blackish colour at the base of
the beak, which becomes all red, being a brighter shade of orange-red
than at other times of the year. They moult from August to November,
usually in September at this latitude. The Leiothrix moult is the fastest
I have ever seen, usually completed unobtrusively in a month. Often you
only notice the birds are moulting when the tail feathers drop, and they
are grown again in a few weeks.
Nesting
The following notes were taken on 21 nests from four pairs, mostly the
old pair. All the birds built nests but did not lay in the first year of
acquisition, except for the young hen who laid but did not sit. The first
year of laying, the old pair built seven nests which were used and the
cock half-built one which was abandoned. Nests were all of the same
pattern--a loose deep cup suspended from suitable stems. The preferred
support is an even-sided triangle of horizontal twigs of about 12.5 cm
long or a similiar arrangement from which the nest can be slung in
concealment. The construction material is always mainly dried grass with
an occasional long dried leaf incorporated (e.g. a bamboo leaf). The spare
lining is of horsehair if available, sisal twine strands, hairy white string
(unwound) or, most commonly, very fine grasses. Only once did the
(young) pair incorporate cotton-wool in the side wall construction, but
it was never used as a lining. Other material was always available (cloth,
paper, feathers, etc.) but was never used in 50 nestings.
Although the nest is fairly thick, it is loosely woven and on several
occasions eggs worked their way down to the bottom. For this reason a
basket was pushed up around the nest and wired to the twigs as soon as
construction was finished. Extra support branches were wired in as
needed. This never upset the birds.
The nests measured 5.75 cm in top inside diameter and were about
5 cm deep. This is quite deep for the size of the nest and only the end of
the tail and beak of the sitting bird stick out.

Nesting commenced with remarkable consistency in spring. The old
pair built on April 8th 1972, March 30th 1973, March 23rd 1974, March
30th 1975, and early in April in 1976. This latter nest was in someone else's
aviary with no exact information available. The young pair built on
April 4th 1976. They did not build the previous year, but the hen did
lay. These nestings were outside, mostly in an unheated conservatory: the
weather varied considerably and the length of daylight was probably the
stimulating factor. It has been stated that nests are built as close as
possible to running water, (finches and softbilled birds, by Bates and
Busenbark). I cannot confirm this. All but one nest were built in the
farthest possible corner (6 m) from the water supply, which was a large
earthenware vessel below a dripping tap. Four out of five aviaries used
for nesting, did have running water, but it is likely that the bathing
facilities available (and probably better general conditions) accounted for
the nestings rather than the actual movement of the water. Nests were
built mostly at a height of two metres with a few a little higher, but no
nest was constructed at the maximum height available--three metres--or
on or near the ground: the lowest was at a little less than two metres. No
nests were ever built indoors or in a box. The young hen did lay in a
wicker basket indoors in her first year when at ten months old. The
basket was in an evergreen bush in a flight measuring 9x5x5 feet, but
she did not make a nest in the basket.
Although the conservatory faced south, all other aviaries where nesting
took place varied considerably in this respect and no consistency was
noted, except that they were all well planted. The conservatory was
walled with acrylic sheeting, but all other aviaries were of wire-netting.
Dried grass was supplied and no fresh grass was collected by the birds.
Feathers in a wide variety of colours and sizes were supplied, but were
never once used by any pair. I cannot confirm a Czech writer's statement
that the Pekin Robin will pluck feathers from other birds for nesting
material (J. Felix in cage and aviary birds). Other birds were often
present and were always ignored. Nestings were noted in four aviaries
belonging to other people: all of these contained assorted birds and no
trouble between them and the Pekin Robins was recorded. The following
species raised young in the presence of pairs of Pekin Robins (breeding
and otherwise--four pairs were involved at different times): Cockatiels,
Bourke's Grass Parrakeets, Diamond Doves, Blackbirds T. merula,
Cut-throat Finches, Strawberry Finches, Gouldian Finches and Canaries.
This would hardly support the claim of some authors that Leiothrix lutea
is an egg-stealer--indeed on one occasion in my conservatory a pair of
Gouldian Finches laid on the same day as the Pekin Robins and each
pair reared three young. The nests were at the same height and about
four metres apart and each pair ignored the other's nest. Either species
would drive off the other if they perched within about a metre of the nest,
but there was no chasing. Food was amicably collected by all the birds at

the one feeding station.
Leiothrix lutea lays a comparatively large egg. The normal colour is a
greenish-hued off-white, lightly marked with large reddish-brown spots
at the large end. They may sometimes be more bluish than green. The
eggs are always very consistent in size and shape compared with those of
some other birds. I have found birds' eggs to vary quite a bit in size and
shape (and sometimes in colour) from the average. Finding no correlation
between the hatching ability and these variations, I gave up taking
measurements of eggs.
These notes were taken on 50 clutches. Four is the usual number of
eggs, but often three were laid. No clutch ever contained more than four.
Egg-laying commenced with amazing regularity at the same time every
year, and is almost certainly triggered by the appropriate length of day-
light. The old pair laid on April 1st, April ist, April 2nd on three
successive years. The nests were all outside in natural light and in a wide
variety of weather and temperatures, suggesting that light was the con-
trolling factor. Sunrise and sunset are 13 hours apart on April ist at this
latitude (49*), giving between 13 and 14 hours of light. Eggs were laid in
nine months of the year, mostly in April and May, all in varying weather
conditions.
The earliest laying was a single egg indoors on March 17th, 1975, by
the young hen. This was ignored, as were two more on April 22nd and
23rd, except for a few "practice broods". The same pair nested and laid
normally outside on April 9th 1976. The latest laying was outside in
November (date not available) by another pair which produced and sat
on two clear eggs. The first year of laying (1974), the old pair laid seven
clutches between April and August, for a total of 26 eggs (3, 4, 4, 4, 3,
4, 4,) of which 23 hatched. One was hatched under a Canary, but the
chick died the next day. Obviously with adequate feeding, etc., egg-
laying is no danger to the hen, and resting her or deliberately stopping
the nesting cycle is unnecessary. Lest the reader thinks this may have
been an isolated (or lucky) run, it should be noted that during the same
season a Skylark Alauda arvensis and a Canary laid 18 and 22 eggs
respectively. All the birds were on a similar diet.
The hatching time is accurately predicted by adding 12 to the date of
laying of the second last egg. The first three eggs will hatch on this day
and the fourth egg on the following day. Hatching time for individual
eggs varied from 11J to 12J days. These times are 24 hour periods
counted from the time of laying. Eggs were laid by 9 a.m. with a few
exceptions. The last egg always takes 12 days: rarely one will hatch in
11 i days. If only one or two eggs are laid, the hen is not in proper condition
and these eggs are usually unattended. Various books state clutches as
being from three to five eggs, but five eggs were never seen. The four
large eggs fill the bottom of the nest exactly, and there would be no room
for a fifth. The birds incubate from the first egg, but always hatch the

first three on the same day. If three eggs are laid, two hatch together and
one on the following day. Incubation, as with all other duties, is shared
more or less equally between the cock and the hen. The hen sits at night
with the cock sleeping on the nearest twig or the edge of the nest. There
was never any "dead-in-shell" problem: all fertilised eggs always hatched.
Although the birds bathed frequently, it was never observed that they
wet the eggs deliberately. Usually the off-duty bird would have a meal
and a bath, then preen itself in the usual meticulous fashion. They
relieved one another at a half to two hour intervals. As hatching time
approached, the hen tended to sit more often than the cock, usually
coming off for only a half hour. On occasions when the temperature was
above 85 *F. (30*C.) the eggs were left for up to three hours on the last
two days before hatching.
Nests were examined daily. When this was first done, a rather dis-
tressing incident occurred. The cock was found sprawled on top of a
bush near the nest. His wings were spread out, his legs dangled, and the
beak was open. When a move was made to pick him up, he took off
rapidly. This refinement of feigning injury was practiced a few times
initially. When the bird found that the nest was being left intact, it soon
gave up the habit and it was never noted again. One other cock was seen
to do this a few times, but the hens were never seen to practice it.
The birds sit tightly and only leave the nest when almost touched.
They remain close by, chattering angrily and always return immediately
to sit. I never had a case of desertion from examining the nest. Desertion
was only noted once (at 11 days) by the hen, two days after the cock was
removed with two fledged chicks. Thereafter, the adults were always
kept together. When the eggs hatch, the shells (and subsequent dead
chicks) are deposited in the farthest corner of the flight from the nest site.
Throughout the ten-day period the chicks are in the nest, it is kept
meticulously clean. The chicks do not defecate over the edge of the nest,
so the droppings are removed by the duty parent. The droppings are
initially in a sac. They are dumped as far from the nest as possible, but
may be eaten by the parents. This cleanliness would make banding the
chicks a risk and it was never attempted. Occasionally the habit was put
to good use. Food (usually omelette) was placed on the edge of the nest.
The duty parent would promptly eat it, but if a chick was begging, it
would sometimes be fed. This did not, however, solve the problem of the
parents feeding only live food for the first week. There was not a speck
of rubbish in the nest when the chicks left, and a used nest looked as good
as a new one. Perhaps this cleanly habit of removing droppings until the
chicks leave has led to the less desirable habit they have of consuming
dried droppings at other times.
The main incentive to re-nest is probably the failure to raise the chicks,
but chicks were raised from two nests in 1974, and three or four more
clutches were laid afterwards.

This is the difficult part. Overall success was between 20 and 25% of
hatched eggs, but in 1976, success was 75%. The reasons will be dis-
cussed later. For the sake of continuity, a successful raising will be
described first. At no time were all four chicks raised. Usually the
youngest died first.
Feeding commences within a few hours of the eggs hatching. Both
parents feed equally, and like many birds they improve as parents with
practice. Only live foods are fed in the first seven days. Growth is
phenomenal and the chicks can see on the fifth day. They always leave
the nest together on the tenth day--the youngest being only nine days
old. Food is carefully picked into tiny pieces for the first two days by the
parents, and then regurgitated. Thereafter, mealworms etc. are fed whole
and direct. The cock was particularly careless at not feeding small enough
pieces in the first year of nesting. This caused the death of at least two
chicks who had ruptured intestines from being fed large whole mealworms
on the third day. The cock was more careful in following seasons. This
particular problem was overcome by feeding only mealworm pupae for
the remainder of that season. Spiders were particularly good, being soft
and "bite-sized," and on the two occasions when spiders were supplied
for the first two days, a higher success rate was noted. After one week the
cock began to feed egg and soaked currants to the chicks. When the chicks
left the nest, they scattered into thick cover and were fed where they
perched by the parents. On the day of leaving, they could fly less than a
metre, but could climb actively in the bushes. At this stage they are fully
feathered except for the tail, which is only 1 cm long. The youngest
chick has a noticeably shorter tail, and for a week or two the tail length
enables one to keep track of individual chicks. On the day after leaving
the nest, the chicks roosted huddled together. They remained silent until
the parents approached; then they cheeped loudly and begged. When the
chicks were 15 days old the hen laid again (this varied between 14 and 20
days with different broods). From then on the chicks are not fed into the
throat, as previously; instead the parent simply holds the food for the
chicks to take. The chick then has to manoeuvre the food into a swallowing
position. They soon learned how to handle mealworms. The hen fed the
chicks rarely at this stage (she was sitting). The cock continued to feed
but when the chicks were 17 days old he began to pay more attention to
the nest where |he hen was on four eggs. The chicks were not fed enough,
and at 18 days became so weak they could not fly up to a perch from the
ground. They were immediately hand-fed and moved to a cage along
with the cock. He resumed feeding and the chicks recovered quickly. The
chicks were seen to drink and attempt to feed themselves at 19 days. The
cock was finally removed when the chicks were 24 days old. Although
some chicks were seen to eat at 21 days, the safest time to take them away
from the parents was at 24 days at the earliest. The chicks were removed

because the parents were invariably re-nesting and it was decided not to
risk leaving them in case of trouble. If for any reason the chicks were not
fed within a six-hour period during the day, they became so weak that
they would die without aid. One was seen to bathe at 20 days; after
watching its father bathing.
The chicks have a few wisps of dark down when born, but at five days
the feathers are pushing well out of the quills. They are a grey colour
when they leave the nest, show a creamy yellow throat patch and have
the yellow edges on the primary wing feathers, but no red feathers. The
beaks are a very pale edition of the adult colour. They moult into adult
plumage at three months and they can be sexed accurately from 14 days
by their call. The hen chicks give the adult female call and the young
cocks give a very shaky rendition of the song. Five out of six raised from
the old pair were hens. The sex of six birds raised by the same pair in
1976 was not determined. The 1976 nestings took place in someone else's
aviary and, as is too common with aviculturists, no notes were taken and
answers to questions were preceded by the usual vague "I think" etc. A
random check of birds in pet shops showed a preponderance of females.
Notes on frequency of feeding were soon abandoned as useless information.
Intervals and quantity varied at the same stage with different nests.
Among the factors affecting feeding are the availability and type of food
(calorie value) and proximity of food to the nest; and also the ambient
air temperature. The number and stage of development of the chicks also
affects feeding. What is being fed also affects the demand. One mealworm
at a time is the equivalent of several spiders in weight. It can readily be
understood that the timing of feedings in fact contributes nothing other
than confirming that the chicks are being fed, although it is apparently of
interest to birdwatchers. The adults were never allowed outside to gather
food.
Specific problems
Rickets (rachitis) is commonly reported in chicks (especially softbills).
This is usually manifested by splayed or deformed legs. It is depressing
to read that some people still treat this condition by taping or tying the
legs to stop them from splaying. After some weeks the chicks assimilate
enough food to correct the condition, and the 'cure' is put down to the
taping. The condition is, of course, caused by vitamin D deficiency, and
possibly by a concomitant lack of calcium in the diet. It is easily prevented
and can also be cured if the bird is not badly deformed. A bird with
twisted limbs and a "pigeon-chest" is not worth treating. Although I still
have problems in raising softbills, rickets has never been one of them. To
prevent it the chicks were hand-fed several times a day from two days to
five days or longer. At five days old the chicks can see and will only beg
from the parents. It was often possible to continue feeding them by
subterfuge. To make them beg, tap the nest sharply. When they come up.

the food is pushed down the throat with a toothpick--quickly. When the
eyes are open, stand unseen under the nest and tap it on the side. When
the chicks pop up, the hand is put quickly into the nest and the food
given. Often several attempts are needed to get each chick. The food was
egg omelette mashed with margarine or butter and made quite moist
with milk: it can also be as sloppy as you like. A mistake with earlier
clutches was to make the food too dry. Chicks that have difficulty in
swallowing are invariably dying. In addition, one feed of mealworms per
day was stirred up in some soft margarine. The margarine stayed soft and
the mealworms remained quite lively until eaten. This supplies sufficient
vitamin D (and vitamin A also) and can be used instead of hand-feeding.
Wet mealworms (e.g. with milk) die quickly.
In 1976, hand-feeding was dispensed with and only mealworms were
given. Again these were mixed with margarine and fed ad lib. This was
the most successful (and costly) year and I think that, apart from vitamin
D deficiency, most softbill chicks simply die of starvation rather than lack
of specific dietary elements. It should be noted at this point that unless at
least 12 hours of feeding light are available, even well-fed chicks may not
survive. As previously mentioned a six-hour starvation during the day
proved almost fatal. To become fully feathered and leave the nest in
10 days, requires an incredible food intake. Birds are, of course, up at
dawn, but roost when there is still an hour or two of light left. This
should be taken into account when counting feeding hours.
While the following causes of death were reasonably established, most
chicks simply died on the 2nd, 3rd, or 4th day (occasionally 5th day) for
no obvious reason, and with food available. Chicks lasting a week usually
survived. Breeding from a home-bred hen has, for the first season at least,
not improved the situation, but I hope that as she gains experience she
will improve like her mother. An established cause of death of at least one
chick proved interesting. This bird was found dead at two days old. An
examination showed blockage of the stomach exit by a large (for the bird)
flake of quartz weighing 30 mgm and measuring 5 x 3 x 1.5 mm. There-
after grit was offered, and it was found in the stomach of every dead
chick of two days and older. I have to date not examined the stomach of a
dead adult. Mine are alive and healthy still!
Another cause of loss of one nest was contaminated food. The weather
was very hot and food soured quickly. The chicks died with grossly
bloated intestines, which proved to be full of bacteria of the genus
Bacillus. This organism was found in large numbers in the soured food;
in fact it is one of the commonest causes of food going rancid and has
been noted as the cause of food poisoning in humans. The organism is
not normally present in the intestines of birds and was not found in other
dead chicks, so could be reasonably suspected as the cause of death. The
problem never recurred after food was freshly made or had been kept in
a refrigerator. Bacillus cereus was the organism involved.

1 6 L. GIBSON--THE RED-BILLED LEIOTHRIX
The other established cause of death, as already mentioned, was the
feeding of large whole mealworms by the cock. Mealworms have a tough
skin and very tough mandibles and legs, which are indigestible. It was
noted that when the adult birds pecked up the mealworms to feed the
day-old chicks, the heads of the mealworms were not used. This problem
never recurred in following years. Presumably the cock got better with
practice. As already stated the mealworms were smeared in soft margarine
(to provide vitamin D) for at least one feed per day. The margarine was
subsequently found to contain vitamin D 2 . Birds only fully utilise
vitamin D 3 , but even if only a small percentage of D 2 is assimilated, the
birds apparently get sufficient from sheer volume of consumption because,
although many received scrambled egg as an additional source, other
birds in my collection have reared chicks with only the margarine as a
potential source of this vitamin.
Maggots also have a tough indigestible skin, and if not killed before
being fed, can probably give small chicks an injury inside the throat or
even lower, as they (the maggots) do not asphyxiate easily. However,
maggots were never eaten and did not constitute a problem for this group
of Leiothrix, but they have caused losses in other birds, including direct
food poisoning, so are not to be recommended. The only other known
cause of loss was water! Almost every aviculturist has at some time or
another lost a bird through drowning or wetting. The loss of all the 1976
chicks from the old pair through drowning was especially tragic, as they
represented the highest success rate with the minimum of trouble (no
hand-feeding). Two successive clutches were raised in a large (10 x 13 m)
outdoor aviary with a natural spring-fed pond in it. No attempt was made
to remove the chicks when they were free-flying and all soon drowned.
This aviary was full of assorted birds, many of them nesting, so "wild"
insects were probably of little significance in these nestings.
Unfortunately no comparison can be made to date with hand-fed and
non hand-fed chicks, and also the sexes of the 1976 group were not known.
This did not happen in my aviaries, but at least the breeder did keep in
close touch with me while the chicks were being raised. A few other
people had birds hatch, but simply refused to co-operate on comparing
notes. One even tried to keep the nesting a secret. Of course, they all
failed completely. None of these chicks fledged. Meticulous comparison
of well recorded details of successful and unsuccessful nestings is the way
to make the raising of birds more than just a matter of luck. Little in-
formation was available on any of these birds during 1977 other than
that they were all alive and well. This would make the old pair at least
6J years old. No breeding was attempted by the young pair (the only ones
in my possession) in 1977. The main reason was that the young hen went
into a defective moult in the autumn of 1976. This was my own 1974 bred
hen and her new feathers were thin and poor with weak shafts which bent
or broke easily, the condition being most noticeable in the primaries and

the tail. Some of the primaries were plucked out twice, but each time the
new ones were defective. The pair had been together in an outside aviary,
yet the male moulted perfectly. As the hen could scarcely fly, she was
brought inside for the year and in September 1977 she moulted and grew
perfect feathers, as did the cock and a second hen which had been obtained
in case the defect was permanent. All three birds were receiving the same
diet as the young pair were on in the previous year. This diet included
scrambled egg ad lib. so the defect was unlikely to be due to a lack of
amino acids involved in feather growth (e.g. cystine), although, of course,
it could have been a matter of assimilation.
I have had this problem more seriously in Copsychus species (Shamas
and Dhyal Birds) and always with the same inconsistency.
So far I have not examined a dead adult Pekin Robin (for stomach grit,
weight and so on) in five years of observation. This surely makes the
species one of the hardiest and most long-lived of insectivorous birds.
These notes can reasonably be taken as a representative cross-section of
the natural habits and preferences of Leiothrix lutea. The birds were
remarkably consistent in many habits when offered a variety of surround-
ings, food, etc. within the confines of small aviaries.

THORNBILL HUMMINGBIRDS

part I The genus Ramphomicron
At one time the majority of the thornbill hummingbirds were placed in
the genus Ramphomicron; however, two species only are included now-
adays, the remainder being placed in Chalcostigma. Of the two the Purple-
backed Thornbill R. microrhynchum is the one best known to aviculture,
the Black-backed Thornbill R. dorsale being rarely, if ever, imported.
The male Purple-backed is an extremely beautiful hummingbird,
having the whole of the upperparts shining deep purple with the throat
and upper breast glittering golden-green and the remainder of underparts
bronzy-green. The deeply forked tail is purple-black. Females are
shining grass-green above with upper tail-coverts of bronze and under
tail-coverts chestnut. Underparts are buffy-white speckled with shining
green. The tail is purple-black; outer feathers tipped with white.
Immature males are much like the females, but usually have a number of
shining purple feathers appearing on the upperparts at an early age. The
beak of this species is only 6 mm in length, thus giving it the distinction
of having the smallest beak of all the hummingbirds. Also noteworthy is
the unusual body shape (see plate) and the somewhat large feet and
claws. The species is a little less than medium sized, being some 9 cm
overall length.

A. J. MOBBS--THORNBILL HUMMINGBIRDS
The Purple-backed is a most persistent songster and can be heard
throughout the year except during the period of the moult. The song is
made up of one oft repeated note Zzzzzt, uttered during flight as well as
when the bird is perched. It is heard at its best during the mating display.
When displaying, the male spreads the tail and brings it up over the back.
The gorget is puffed out and the bird then hovers in front of the object
of display, swinging the body from side to side pendulum fashion. The
species will also display while perched when it will spread the tail bringing
it up over the back, puff out the gorget and utter the one-note song
incessantly.
The first Purple-backed Thornbill I owned was a male which I
purchased in March 1967. It died some 3J years later from what I presume
to be old age. As the bird was in adult plumage at the time of purchase, it
was impossible to assess its correct age; however, just before its death,
the bird developed what appeared to be rheumatism in one foot and a
stiffness in one wing, the latter being the eventual cause of death.
In August 1974, my friend Johan Ingels (Belgium) kindly presented me
with a male. This bird was in immature plumage at the time and
commenced to moult into adult plumage during the middle part of
September. Some 13J weeks later, the bird had completed the moult and
was in full adult plumage except for a very small patch of feathers on the
upper back. During the latter part of June 1975, this thornbill was seen
to have problems with its tongue and because of this was unable to feed
correctly; unfortunately the condition became more pronounced and the
bird died on July 5th, having been with me for a matter of 10J months
only. As this second bird was in immature plumage at the time of
acquisition, I had hoped to keep it for longer than the 3J years of my
first bird. However, it would appear from the small number of thornbills
which have come into Europe, that the species is somewhat short lived in
captivity and there is every possibility that my first bird holds the
longevity record for this particular species.
Ramphomicron species cannot be recommended for housing permanently
in a cage. Although being fairly small and looking somewhat delicate,
they are able to stand up for themselves quite well and are therefore
suited to life in a communal flight of hummingbirds. Having large feet
and claws and such a tiny beak, it is obvious that in the wild these birds
cling to many of the blooms from which they obtain nectar. Those I
owned were never seen to hover for nectar and because of this I always
ensured a feeder was placed next to a perch. Insects were taken on the
wing, the birds flying after them with gaping beak. The Purple-backed is
extremely fond of bathing and can be seen to take as many as three baths
daily.
Unfortunately it was not until 1969 that I began to keep records of
the moults of my hummingbirds; therefore I am unable to give the average
length of time taken by the Purple-backed Thornbill to complete a moult.

Worthy of mention, however, is the method of feather replacement in
this species, in that during the annual moult, the loss of the old feathers
(around the head and gorget mainly) occurs only after the feather follicle
has been activated and the new feather is growing. This causes the
moulting bird to take on a most bizarre appearance (see fig. 1), with the
old feathers at times covering the eyes completely. Wolf (1975) described
this type of feather replacement in a captive male Rivoli's Hummingbird
Eugenes fulgens , this being the first time such an occurrence had been
recorded in the Trochilidae and indeed the order Apodiformes.
Wolf (pers. comm.) mentioned that he considers it possible that all
hummingbirds moult in this way. However, this method of feather
replacement is so distinctive, I am certain it would be noticeable were it
the general rule for the Trochilidae. Other than the Purple-backed, I
have witnessed it in only one other species, namely the Violet-fronted
Brilliant (male) Heliodoxa leadbeateri.
As mentioned earlier, the Black-backed Thornbill is rarely if ever
brought into Europe. It is a little larger than the Purple-backed, being
some 10.05 cm overall length. The male has upperparts black with the
upper tail-coverts tipped with purple-bronze. The throat is glittering
golden-olive; remainder of underparts dark grey interspersed with
shining green. The tail is long, forked and is purple-black. Females are
much like those of the Purple-backed.

INTRODUCTION

<bodyText confidence="0.998339428571429" page_id="56386642"  page_num="20" year="" vol="">
Almost nothing is known of the growth and maturity rates of hornbill
species of the family Bucerotidae. Whilst the adult plumage of both
sexes in most of the 45 species at present recognised (Sanft i960) is very
similar or identical, the bills, including the casque on the upper mandible,
differ considerably (Bannerman 1964, Kemp 1976). In fact bill and casque
size, shape and coloration are of very great significance to hornbills as
species-specific and sex-specific signal characters (Kilham 1956). Whilst
these characters vary little in the adults of a species, and within the male
and female populations of each species, this is not so true of some plumage
characters in which considerable individual variation is apparent in many
species (see Frith &amp; Frith (in prep.) for the genus Anthracoceros , and
Frith &amp; Douglas for members of some other genera (in press)). Thus
bill characteristics are almost certainly as significant and important, if
not more so, as those of the plumage in providing species and sex-
specific signals in hornbill populations. The 'casque' of hornbills varies
from a small dully coloured rise on the upper mandible base in some
species to huge, colourful and ornate structures in others. Those of a
typical adult female and male Anthracoceros malabaricus are illustrated in
Figures 1 and 3k respectively.
The nomenclature and morphological characters of the various popula-
tions of the genus Anthracoceros as a whole are at present much confused,
and are the subject of another study (Frith &amp; Frith in prep.). The
population under consideration here has been variously referred to, in
the more recent literature alone, as: Anthracoceros coronatus albirostris
(Sanft i960, Medway &amp; Wells 1976), A. albirostris leucogaster (Diegnan
1963), A. malabaricus malabaricus (Ali &amp; Ripley 1970, Hutchins 1976) and
A. albirostris (Boonsong &amp; Cronin 1974, King &amp; Dickinson 1975). For
present purposes, however, we use the name A. malabaricus of Ali &amp;
Ripley (1970) as this is the most recent thorough taxonomic handbook
including the populations dealt with here, and will doubtless remain a
standard reference for a considerable time. This species name is applied
by those authors to the populations of northern and north-eastern India
to south China, Burma, Thailand, north Malaya, Laos, Cambodia and
Vietnam; the Indian and extreme northern Burmese birds being treated
as the subspecies A. m. malabaricus and the birds from the rest of Burma

south to the northern Malay Peninsula as A. m. leucogaster. We use the
vernacular name Northern Pied Hornbill for reasons given elsewhere
(Frith &amp; Frith in prep.).
In order to avoid possible future confusion, it should be noted that
Hutchins (1975) deals only with the captive breeding of A. m. malabaricus.
Due to misreading the text under "extralimital range" of this subspecies
given by Ali &amp; Ripley (1970) Hutchins states the range to include "the
northern Malay Peninsular together with Thailand in the south", whereas
the latter range is in fact referred to by Ali &amp; Ripley (1970) as being that
of A. m. leucogaster.
Most hornbills, particularly the larger species, are doubtless long to
very long lived for birds (see Frith &amp; Douglas, in press) and individuals
take considerable periods of time to mature. In view of the apparent
visual importance of the bill and casque characters of hornbills, it can be
assumed that the attainment of fully mature casque and bill character-
istics represents a socially significant event in the life of the individual,
possibly indicating to other members of the same species an adult of a
certain minimum age.
Other than by individually marking nestlings and following their
development over a period of years, an almost impossible task, it is not
feasible to determine the period required by hornbills to fully develop a
mature bill and casque in the wild state. Under captive or semi-captive
conditions, however, much valuable information of this kind can be
obtained and, whilst physical growth under captive circumstances might
be subject to unnatural limitations, data obtained in this way are a great
deal better than none. Moreover, repeated records of this kind will
determine their validity and significance, and permit a greater under-
standing of many animal species that are extremely difficult to study in
the wild. Such captive studies should under no circumstances, however,
be to the detriment of limited or endangered species.
In their summary of current knowledge of the Northern Pied Hornbill
A. m. malabaricus, Ali &amp; Ripley (1970) quote Gee (1933) who, as a result
of raising nestlings in captivity for not more than six months, estimated
the period of casque maturity in males to be seven to nine months. Ali
&amp; Ripley (1970) noted that this point required elucidation. Riley (1938),
however, considered that "It probably takes more than one year for the
casque fully to develop and probably longer for it to reach the final stage."
in Anthracoceros malabaricus leucogaster. We have kept two male An-
thracoceros malabaricus leucogaster, a slightly smaller subspecies of the
species (see above) in captivity, both from a very young age, for three
years three months and two years respectively at the time of writing. Our
measurements and other records of these birds, and observations of other
captives in Asia, Europe and America, enable us to show that the attain-
ment of a mature bill and casque in males takes longer than Gee's esti-
mated time of seven to nine months, even in the smaller A. m. leucogaster.

It can be assumed that the larger A. m. malabaricus takes even longer (see
discussion).
The behaviour and moult of captive Northern Pied Hombills is

valuable account of the captive breeding biology of this species see

they have remained since. They have been fed throughout on mixed
tropical fruits (pawpaw, banana, pineapple, grapes, tomatoes) and
occasionally green vegetables. In addition the birds are daily offered
domestic duckling heads (the bodies of which are fed to larger hornbills)
and mice, which they invariably take. The birds also frequently take
insect and other prey themselves. Thus they receive a well balanced diet;
food is always available to them and it is unlikely their growth and
development have been detrimentally affected due to diet deficiency, at
least since we have had them.
The age of the young birds was not known when we obtained them and
we have had to approximate those given in Tables 1 and 2. This we have
done by comparing our birds' appearances at the time we obtained them
with a photograph of a recently fledged bird of the northern population
A. m. malabaricus, from India and northern Burma, published by
Hutchins (1976) which hatched on 29th May 1974 and was approximately
70 days old when photographed (Hutchins pers, comm.). It should be
noted that this is not, however, a completely adequate means of accurately
assessing our birds' ages, due to the fact that individuals of the larger
northern subspecies A. m. malabaricus apparently develop more slowly
than do birds of the smaller southern subspecies A. m. leucogaster. This
is indicated by pictures published by Risser (1975) which show two young
A. m. malabaricus, one of which is the same individual as shown in
Hutchins's photograph, at the age of 209 days give or take a day or two;
the picture being taken on 24th December 1974 (Risser, pers. comm.).
By comparing the morphology of the birds in Risser's pictures with those
of our birds at approximately the same age, it is obvious that the northern
birds take considerably longer to develop, as our estimates of our nestling
(bird A) cannot be more than a maximum of some 10 to 20 days in error
(see below). This is as might be expected in a more northerly population
of larger individuals of the same species. Such data, particularly with
supporting quantitative evidence are, however, rarely available.
In view of the above, extrapolation from the bill characters of the bird
illustrated by Hutchins at approximately 70 days old indicates that the
time we first obtained our birds, male A (Fig. 2 and 3a) was approximately
40 days old, and male B (Fig. 4a) was approximately 85 days old. Taking
into account the apparent difference in development rates between the
subspecies A. m. malabaricus and A. m. leucogaster, however, these ages
(and those given in Tables 1 and 2) must be considered rough approx-
imations; although it would seem most unlikely that they are more than
an absolute maximum of 10 to 20 days from the actual age, in view of the
recorded nestling period of 55 days for A. m. malabaricus (Hutchins 1976)
and the fact that bird A was an advanced nestling when obtained (see
Fig. 2).
Thanks to Velvet E. Douglas of Bangkok, we have been able to examine
photographs of a male A. m. leucogaster that she raised from a post-

fledgling of young age. Although measurements of this bird were not
taken it can be stated that its bill development when obtained, on 25th
May 1976, was very similar indeed to that of our bird A as illustrated in
Figure 3b; on 12th September 1976 to that of Figure 3c, but with more
black on the anterior casque; and on 18th March 1977 at a point in growth
between Figures 3e and 3f. Thus Mrs. Douglas's bird shows bill growth
and development of very much the same rate as our two males, as it
attained bill morphology between that illustrated in Figures 3c and 3f
over almost exactly the same period of some 370 days.

the eye. The iris was by this time a slightly lighter rich dark chocolate-
brown and remained so thereafter. By mid-November 1974 the bare skin
directly above and in front of the eye had become smudged and spotted
black, the remainder being pale chalky-blue as previously. No noteworthy
changes in facial soft-part colours occurred subsequent to this time, save
that the black area directly above and in front of the eye became com-
pletely solid black.

On 4th July 1929 Gee was given a nestling Anthracoceros malabaricus
malabaricus in Assam and a photograph of this bird taken at the time
accompanies his notes on this, and other, individuals (Gee 1933). By
using the ages calculated for Hutchins's bird (1976, plate 14) and our
bird A (see Fig. 3 and Table 1) we would assess the nestling brought to
Gee to be very close to 40 days old. He kept this bird until early December
1929 when it flew away, but not before he photographed it in late Novem-
ber or early December (from which photograph we confidently sex the
bird as a male). We use the date 4th December for this last photograph
for convenience, thus giving an approximate age of the bird of 193 days
which would appear correct in view of the figures of our bird A at 220 days
(Fig. 3d) and bird B at 173 days (Fig. 4d).
As already stated, Gee, as a result of keeping his bird approximately
five months, to the age of about 185 to 193 days, concluded that it "must
take about 7 to 9 months for the casque to mature" (Gee 1933). Riley
(1938), however, suggested a more realistic period of at least a year or
more. The problem, however, is adequately defining what constitutes a
'mature' casque. In view of the specific casque shapes of hornbill species
in which the forward casque of many projects forward over the upper
mandible in a conspicuous way, we consider it probable that the attain-
ment of a mature casque in Anthracoceros males is not reached until the
anterior point of the casque starts to project forward over the mandibles.
In support of this is the fact that most bill and casque measurements slow
down in rate of increase of growth after the bird reaches a certain age,
whereas casque length continues to increase at a greater rate then the rest
of the bill (see Tables 1 and 2). That this continued casque growth is in
fact occurring at the forward point of the casque is demonstrated by the
fact that the overall casque and bill measurement is not increasing at the
same rate. Moreover, the lower anterior edge of the casque is intentionally
worn and broken away by birds by rubbing and banging this area
(indicated by a heavy arrow in Fig. 1) on objects (see also Frith and
Douglas, in press, for accounts of this activity in other species), thus
assisting and emphasising the forward projection of the anterior upper
edge of the casque. Thus the growth and development of the casque shape
is not merely the result of tissue formation, but also requires active

abrasive action on the part of the bird.
Using the above definition of a mature casque, therefore, our birds did
not attain such an appearance until about 416 days in bird A (Fig. 3f),
and 360 days in bird B (Fig. 4f) at the earliest. It should be noted that this
is considered the minimum time required to attain a mature casque. It is
possible, however, that a bird's casque is not in fact fully mature until of
the shape and proportions shown in Figure 3i, j and k, which are of a bird
over two years old. Presumably it takes longer for a male A. m. malabaricus
to fully develop a casque than it does for a male A. m. leucogaster , in view
of the larger size of the former subspecies and the facts given above.
It is not implied that a 'mature' casque necessarily indicates a sexually
mature bird, for it is quite likely true that a male with a not fully developed
casque is capable of breeding (although no direct evidence of this is at
present available for this species). By a 'mature' casque we assume that
the fully developed shape of the appendage is a significant social signal,
and as such indicates to other members of the species a bird of a certain
age, status, experience or maturity. In Anthracoceros malabaricus
leucogaster it would appear that such a state of casque morphology is
reached at about a minimum of 12 to 14 months of age. As a result of an
examination of study skins of A. m. leucogaster in museum collections
throughout Asia, Europe and America (Frith and Frith in prep.) we are
able to give (Table 1) the means of certain bill measurements of adult
male birds from southern Burma and Thailand, Democratic Cambodia
and the Socialist Republic of Viet Nam collected between 7 0 and I4*N,
the geographical area from which our birds originated. These measure-
ments show that whilst the bills of our birds have reached much the same
proportions as wild adult males in overall bill length, their casque length
is relatively much shorter, thus suggesting that the casque may well
continue slowly to grow and project still further forwards.

CONCLUSIONS
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999503" page_id="56386651"  page_num="29" year="" vol="">
As a result of rearing and measuring two male Northern Pied Hornbills,
Anthracoceros malabaricus leucogaster , over several years and comparative
observations on the development of other captive males it is apparent
that the attainment of a fully developed casque, which is defined, takes at
least 12 to 14 months. Evidence suggests that individuals of the larger
subspecies Anthracoceros m. malabaricus take longer to fully develop a
casque and that a previous and repeated estimation of 7 to 9 months for
casque maturity for this population is, therefore, too short. Age changes
of facial soft-part colour are described.

By Peter Brown (Harewood, Leeds)
Whilst mainland Australia can boast a fair amount of coverage through-
out the ornithological press of the world, Tasmania, that little blob on the
right hand corner of the map of Australia, is so often ignored, for there
have been very few competent field workers in Tasmania. This is the
view I had before my visit to this island in late November and December,
1976.
I was surprised to find on my arrival that there is a thriving Ornitho-
logical Society in Tasmania and several enthusiastic, almost obsessive,
ornithologists who are doing some excellent work on Tasmanian birds.
I was fortunate enough to be invited to a meeting of the Ornithological
Society shortly after my arrival. Here I met Michael Sharland, the doyen
of Tasmanian bird study, who at over 80, is still as keen and enthusiastic
about the birds as ever. Subsequent to this meeting, several people I met
there very kindly took me to various parts of the country in search of
Tasmanian birds.
Tasmania lies some 200 miles from the mainland of Australia, with
average dimensions of 190 miles by 180 miles wide. It is a relatively
mountainous country with a low-lying central plateau running north to
south. The highest mountains are i,6oo metres with a good deal of the
country being over 300 metres. The western side of the island is the most
rugged and, indeed, large areas of the south-west with dense rain forest
are relatively unexplored.
Much of the island is forested with the majority of the trees being
eucalyptus and these forest areas are known as either dry sclerophyl or
wet sclerophyl, depending on the amount of rainfall they receive. Dry
sclerophyl is basically more open woodland with little understory and
through which it is relatively easy to walk. Wet sclerophyl on the other
hand has towering eucalyptus up to 300 feet and more (Tasmania can
boast the tallest hardwoods in the world). The understory is dense and
often quite impenetrable. I must say that some of the rain forest I saw in
the south-west was undoubtedly the thickest forest I have ever seen. The
more open parts of the island in the south tend to be mainly devoted to
sheep farming, whilst the north concentrates on dairy and arable farming.
The number of species one is likely to encounter in Tasmania is by no
means so large as those in mainland Australia, but there are many species
of bird which are peculiar to the island, including one flightless land bird,
the Tasmanian Moorhen or Native Hen which is surprisingly very success-
ful and abundant.
I intend to deal individually in systematic order with some of the more
interesting species encountered during my six week visit to the island,
which came about because my wife is Tasmanian and this was her first

visit home in 10 years. For identification of the species mentioned, the
best book is a field guide to Australian birds by F. Slater (2 vols.)
published by Rigby.
Fairy Penguin Eudyptula minor
Around the coast of Tasmania there are many breeding colonies of this
species, some nesting under the wharves and boat houses around Hobart,
the capital. The best known colony is on the holiday island of Bruny
where watching the penguins come ashore at dusk and cross the road to
get to their nesting burrows is a great spectator sport. The only colony I
saw was in the dunes behind a storm beach some 15 miles from Hobart.
One evening I was sitting on the beach at dusk waiting for the shearwaters
to return to their burrows when two groups of some 30 penguins came
rushing up the beach. They scrambled up the dunes to their burrows
which were perhaps 60 feet above the sea and 100 yards from the shore.
Not having seen this species before, I was astonished at its small size, for
it is very little larger than a Guillemot. At the time of my visit they had
young, and one burrow, 18 inches deep, held two three-quarter grown
young. There is no activity at the colony in the daytime and the dangerous
run from the sea to the burrow and vice versa is only made under cover of
darkness.

</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.972764380952381" page_id="56386655"  page_num="33" year="" vol="">
This very rare albatross breeds in Tasmania on an island off the north
and one off the south of the island, both almost inaccessible and seldom
visited. I encountered a group of 50 or more out to sea off the Freycenit
peninsula where they appeared to be just loafing about, flying back and
forth over the swell. They are black on the back with white underparts
and are incredibly buoyant, seldom flapping their long wings.
Short-tailed Shearwater Puffinus tenuirostris
The well known Mutton Bird of Tasmania whose breeding population
throughout its many colonies must number millions. Unlike the Manx
Shearwater of Britain there are many mainland breeding colonies on
ocean facing coasts as well as numerous offshore island colonies. Licences
are still issued for the taking of young shearwaters from their nests for
food but "Mutton Birding" is no longer an important source of food as it
was for the early settlers. The Short-tailed Shearwaters were in the early
stages of breeding during my visit and on the occasions at night when I
visited breeding colonies there was sand flying in all directions as the nest
burrows were being excavated. The burrows, just wide enough to allow
one to put an arm down, are between two and three feet long. Several of
the nests I inspected held freshly laid eggs and I usually got my fingers
bitten for my pains. I visited three mainland breeding colonies, each of
which contained upwards of 10,000 pairs, the hillside being riddled with

</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.955983235294118" page_id="56386656"  page_num="34" year="" vol="">
I saw three birds sitting together on just one occasion on an island in a
lagoon near Hobart. This is a large white pelican, with black wings.
Australian Gannet Morus senator
There are at least two gannet colonies on offshore islands of Tasmania
and I saw birds on several occasions fishing at sea off the south and east
coasts and on one occasion, when fish were jumping out of the sea, there
were 3-400 gannets congregating for the feast.
Black Cormorant Phalacrocorax carbo
Presumably with numbers swelled by an influx from mainland Australia,
the Black Cormorant was amazingly abundant. They were encountered in
all situations from the high mountains to the sea shores. I often saw them
sitting on the roadside verges and sometimes perched in trees.
Little Black Cormorant Phalacrocorax sulcirostris
This cormorant, only two-thirds the size of the former species, had
only the previous year been proved as a breeding species in Tasmania
with nests being found on dead trees by the Derwent River, about 15
miles upstream from Hobart. I encountered odd birds on the sea shore or
near river estuaries.
Black-faced Cormorant Phalacrocorax fuscescens
A handsome black and white cormorant which is very common in
Tasmania. They were seen breeding on two islands off the southern
coasts and breed early, having almost full grown young in early December.
They were particularly common in river estuaries and I often saw them
perched on the rigging of boats.
Little Pied Cormorant Phalacrocorax melanoleucos
Although found well inland in Australia, it seems to be mainly coastal
and estuarial in Tasmania. It was most commonly seen in the river
Derwent, just upriver from Hobart, usually sitting on posts protruding
from the river.
White-faced Heron Ardea novaehollandiae
A bird about two-thirds the size of the European Heron A. cinerea, all
grey with a white face. Encouraged by the superabundance of frogs in
Tasmania which were so noisy after a period of heavy rain. The wasteland
beyond our garden was a happy hunting ground for herons and often

there were more than 20 stalking the frogs. I often saw groups of 30-40
around the coast, particularly around mudflats which they preferred. I
would think many of these were non-breeding birds from the mainland.
Black Swan Cygnus atratus
This was by far the most abundant species of waterfowl in Tasmania
and would be encountered in large numbers in many parts, particularly
in the Derwent River upstream from Hobart and many coastal lagoons
near Hobart. Its real stronghold in Tasmania was the Moulting Lagoon
on the east coast where around 2000 pairs breed annually. They breed
during June and July and consequently there was very little evidence of
any nesting activity when I was there. I did, however, see one late pair
with nearly fully grown young in December.
Mountain Duck Tadorna tadornoides
It is a widespread species which is not likely to be encountered in very
large numbers. I saw groups of up to a dozen birds on mudflats and
"ducky" lagoons in southern Tasmania. This is a very handsome member
of the shelduck genus and is, of course, known here as the Australian
Shelduck.
Black Duck Anas superciliosa
A very abundant duck found in all suitable habitats throughout
Tasmania. It was particularly numerous at the Moulting Lagoon where
there were more than a thousand living. I only saw one brood of almost
fully grown chicks on a small lagoon in late December.
Grey Teal Anas gibberifrons
Another common species. Like the Black Duck with which it was
associated there were multitudes of them on the Moulting Lagoon. They
were seen very commonly on all suitable lagoons in southern Tasmania.
Chestnut Teal Anas castanea
Very widespread throughout Tasmania. They seemed very fond of
small pools where I often flushed pairs. They were likely to be seen
anywhere. On one occasion I saw a pair perched some 40 feet up a tree on
a dead bough.
Musk Duck Biziura lobata
Certainly the most extraordinary duck I have ever encountered. It is a
large black duck, larger than a female Eider which it vaguely resembles.
It lies low in the water and the male has a large circular lobe of skin
suspended from his lower mandible and throat. There are many fair
sized lagoons covered in weed in southern Tasmania which suit this duck
and it is a successful breeding species. Its flesh is distasteful and it is

seldom shot by sportsmen. I saw two broods of young, two on each
occasion. The young when very small delight in riding on their mother's
back, grebe fashion. There were very small young in late November. The
display of the male which I saw on my first sighting of this species is
quite amazing. The male lays his head along the surface, so the beak is
just touching the water, the short stubby tail is raised over and laid flat
along the back and he pushes through the water emitting a high pitched
squeak as he flaps the water with his wings at half-minute intervals,
sending spray flying.
Whistling Kite Haliastur sphenurus
Although abundant in Australia, it is a rare vagrant in Tasmania and
when I saw three one day at Oatlands in the midlands, this was more than
had been previously seen together on the island. They are very untidy,
long-winged kites, pale brown underneath, almost creamy, but the usual
hawk-brown above. These three were perched in trees overlooking a
large lagoon.
White Goshawk Accipiter novaehollandiae
It was one of my desires in Tasmania to see the pure white goshawks.
My ambition was achieved in the Mount Field National Park, home of
the tallest hardwood trees in the world (over 300 feet). The bird is as
white as driven snow and whilst I watched it over a period of half an hour,
it was either perched on the uppermost branches of a gum tree or floating
across the tops of trees. I was told by a friend that they are very seldom
seen lower down in the forest as one would expect with a goshawk.
Brown Goshawk Accipiter fasciatus
I saw goshawks flitting through the forest on several occasions, but
once saw a spectacular chase by a goshawk in pursuit of Starlings. The
Starlings eventually fled to a thorn bush and, not to be outdone, the hawk
plummeted at full speed into the bush with much cracking of branches
and squawking of birds, and came out triumphantly with a Starling in its
talons which it carried off*. The Starlings were, of course, the introduced
Sturnus vulgaris.
Wedge-tailed Eagle Aquila audax
A majestic eagle which was to my mind far from common in Tasmania.
I saw it on five occasions, all in the midlands along the wooded escarpment
which runs directly north and south. The flight is a typical soaring, large
predator flight. The wedge-tail is very distinctive. I would hazard a guess
that there are less than 100 pairs throughout the island and probably even
less than this number. They are subject to a lot of harassment, for I saw
them being chased by Magpies, Brown Hawks, and Swamp Hawks at
different times. They are tree-nesters, but I did not find one although I

felt sure I was pretty close as the birds circled above me on one occasion.
They are capable of killing hares and small wallabies, but depend mostly
on carrion from what I could gather.

White-breasted Sea Eagle Haliaeetus leucogaster
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.983663916666667" page_id="56386659"  page_num="37" year="" vol="">
I saw three pairs of this handsome grey-backed, white eagle, on the
Freycenit peninsula on the east coast. I also found a nest which had a
fully grown youngster standing on it. Another bird was carrying nesting
material as it flew in from the sea and into a wooded hillside but I could
not locate the nest. The nest was a massive twig structure obviously many
years in use, on a steep wooded cliff, rising straight out of the sea. It was
about ioo feet above water and 250 feet from the cliff top.
Swamp Hawk Circus approximans
This bird was abundant throughout Tasmania and on some days I
would see more than 30 individuals quartering the fields or open grasslands
in the usual harrier fashion. They were also frequently seen perching on
fence posts and sometimes standing on the ground, but they were most
often seen on the wing. There are many mammal casualties on the roads
and mostly are opossums blinded and run over in the glare of headlights
at night, this being a constant source of food for the Swamp Hawks. They
were often disturbed whilst eating road strikes. Very occasionally I saw
birds soaring at a great height in the thermals, usually in late afternoon.
Peregrine Falcon Falco peregrinus
I was taken out one day by someone from Hobart University, who had
been conducting a survey on Peregrines, to three sites, all of which had
young the week before, but all nests were empty although the adults were
in attendance. Pigeon fanciers were suspected as there is a constant war
of words between the conservationists and the pigeon men whose birds
race through Peregrine country. Whilst on the mainland I got a spectacular
view of a Peregrine taking a circling pigeon. The Peregrine is, as in
Britain, a bird which many keen ornithologists seldom see but is there if
one knows the localities.
Brown Hawk Falco berigora
A common bird throughout Tasmania. It is more noticeable in open
country than well wooded terrain and was often to be seen perched on
one of the outermost dead branches of an old gum tree, presumably on
the lookout for prey. I saw one or two nests, usually well up in the fork of
a tree. A twiggy crow-like structure. The usual prey is lizards, mice etc.
Tasmanian Native Hen Tribonyx mortierii
The Native Hen is found only in Tasmania. It is a robust, strong,
long-legged gallinule, which through an isolated island evolution, has

<bodyText confidence="0.972835615384615" page_id="56386660"  page_num="38" year="" vol="">
become quite flightless. So often flightless birds when faced with intro-
duced predators like dogs, cats and rats, face a rapid decline and eventual
extinction, but the Native Hen is an exception. It has fared well and
indeed is a very common bird throughout most of the island. It feeds out
in the open and, when approached, runs very swiftly and disappears in
thick cover which is invariably at hand. The breeding season was well
under way when I was there, for there were many family parties about.
The usual clutch is six to eight eggs but I noticed that one seldom saw
more than three or four well grown young with their parents whilst I saw
several just hatched groups of six.
Sooty Oystercatcher Haematopus fuliginosus
An all black oystercatcher with bright red bill and legs. I saw one group
of six birds at Lauderdale, near Hobart, which were resident in the bay
for the whole time I was in Tasmania. They never mixed with the Pied
(H. ostralegus) which were also present and were usually feeding in water
about three to four inches deep. They nest around the shores of the
island.
Spur-winged Plover Vanellus miles
This species, quite different from the European Spurwing V. spinosus ,
was immensely common as a breeding resident throughout the island. It
appeared that every field and pasture had a pair breeding. The young
were well grown in late November and December and I caught several
juveniles in almost full plumage. This plover has a bright yellow facial
wattle which is quite extensive around the eyes. It is very fearless and is
often seen in the gardens around the housing estates. It is also known as
the Masked Plover.

</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.994709928571429" page_id="56386660"  page_num="38" year="" vol="">
Although it is considered to be quite common in Tasmania, I certainly
did not find this so, for I only saw it three times during my stay there and
none of the views I had of it were very satisfactory. However, it does have
a very distinctive call which I heard on several occasions, particularly in
the thickly forested areas towards the Strathgordon in the west where it
was regularly heard calling with its low pitched repetitive "oom-oom-
oom". The flight, like that of all the bronzewings, is strong and particularly
noisy on take-off, with much wing-clapping.
Brush Bronzewing Phaps elegans
A very pretty little pigeon which I only saw in the Mount Field National
Park, in southern Tasmania. A pair were trotting up and down the road
through the picnic area, picking up bits of bread and cake, etc. They were
quite unafraid and allowed me to approach within a few feet to get a
photograph. I had ample opportunity to get a good look at the iridescent

"gunmetal" patch on the wing. The pair, after taking their fill and in
their own time, flew off into the nearby forest of 200 foot eucalyptus.
Yellow-tailed Black Cockatoo Calyptorhynchus funereus
The day after my arrival in Tasmania, three black shapes flew across
the skyline with a slow, deliberate, heron-like flight. They had unusually
long tails and I had my suspicions, which were subsequently confirmed,
that they were Yellow-tailed Black Cockatoos. They are something of an
enigma and are likely to turn up anywhere--this is what I was told by
people who were familiar with them when I asked where could I best
observe them and I found this to be absolutely correct. It was almost
three weeks after that first glimpse that I next saw these cockatoos. I was
walking around the National Park at the Freycenit peninsula, along a
narrow strip of scrubland, bounded by the sea on both sides, when two
cockatoos flew up from the low Banksia bushes into a dead gum tree.
These were followed by five others. I got absolutely magnificent views of
them at perhaps 30 feet. I stood, scarcely daring to breathe, and they
settled down after a minute or two and flew back to the Banksias , ripping
off the seed cones, flying back to the gum tree where they tore them apart,
eating the seeds and scattering the waste about. They kept contact with
a plaintive, mournful cry most of the time with some chattering and a
good deal of squabbling. When arguing, the crest feathers and those under
the chin are raised.
About a week later I came across a party of six on a lightly wooded
hillside near Bridgewater in southern Tasmania, and approaching slowly,
managed to get within 25 feet of them. They were in a group of she oaks
and were pulling off* lumps of bark, obviously searching for grubs, beetles
and caterpillars. These birds, like the others, were calling all the time.
They were very ungainly in flight and when flying from one tree to another,
just pitching amongst the light branches in any old fashion, scrambling to
gain a foothold. By their behaviour, it would seem that at least two of the
birds were juveniles.
Sulphur-crested Cockatoo Cacatua galerita
The Tasmanian bird watchers told me that the Sulphur-crested
Cockatoo in the non-breeding season congregates into large groups where
it remains roughly resident through the season. I was told that there were
four or five of these groups throughout the island, which make a reasonably
small Tasmanian population. I managed to find one group of about 60 on
the roadside between Ross and Poatina in the midlands. It was open, flat
sheep farming country with scattered trees and groups of ancient, gnarled
gums, obviously affording masses of nesting sites. They were all feeding
on the ground when we first approached them in the car. As soon as it
stopped they flew up into nearby trees, all screaming abuse at us and
circling about, crying with raucous deafening cries. When they realised

that we were not going to move they flew further away and eventually
became more settled.
About three weeks later I visited the same area and the birds were all
present within a ioo yards of where they had been before. Once again I
got the same deafening reception. They struck me as being extremely
nervous birds, much more so than the Yellow-tailed Black Cockatoo.
This time they all took oif and after flying around for a while, headed
into a nearby patch of ancient woodland.
Galah Eolophus roseicapillus
I believe the Galah, so numerous through most of Australia, is not
native to Tasmania; however, there is a group of Galahs which live and
breed around Kingston to the south of Hobart. I spoke to the person on
whose property they are resident and found that the original breeding
pair were captive birds which were given their freedom after the
devastating bush fires seven or eight years ago. They bred successfully
and so have their progeny, and I was told that the flock is static at present
at about 35 birds. They are fed daily in the garden of the property, so are
not truly wild. Whilst I was at Roches Beach in Lauderdale, a Galah flew
over the house one day and I have been told since my return to England
that there has been a small party in the area for several days. I wonder if
these are part of the Kingston group.
Swift Parrakeet Lathamus discolor
This bird in general shape, colour and habits resembles the lorikeets. I
am not sure, however, if it has a brush tongue; I think probably it does
not. It is about nine inches long with an overall grass-green coloration,
blue crown, red forehead and throat and reddish-brown tail. The name
is very apt, for it flies like a bullet. On one occasion I saw one flying down
the tree covered side of Mount Wellington, towards Hobart. It appeared
to be doing 200 miles per hour!
The Anglesea barracks in the centre of Hobart has an avenue of blue
gum (eucalyptus) trees which were in flower in December at the time of
my visit, these trees proving a magnet for the Swift Parrakeets. I visited
the barracks three times during the month and each time there were 150
to 200 birds in the trees, dashing in typical lorikeet fashion through the
outer branches, from flower to flower, hesitating at each one for no more
than a few seconds. There were birds flying to and from the trees, arriving
and departing all the time I was there. As it was nesting time I can only
presume that they were nesting in trees on the mountainside above the
town.
Green Rosella Platycercus caledonicus
The Green Rosella, confined entirely to Tasmania, is by far the most
abundant member of the parrot family on the island. There were very few

days when I was out and about that I did not come across a few pairs.
Whilst their preferred habitat is woodland and they are found commonly
in the dense rain forests of the south-west, they are likely to be found
virtually anywhere. I saw them at different times in gardens, eating fruit
on trees around the ruined penal settlement of Port Arthur, in open,
sparsely treed plains country and in very thick impenetrable forest. They
are not particularly swift fliers, but are very manoeuvrable in flight.
I almost always saw pairs although we were supposed to be in the
midst of the breeding season. On two occasions I saw single birds and
twice parties of three. I was shown an occupied nest site from which
three young had flown last year. It was in a dead gum tree standing some
40 feet tall and the nest hole was about 25 feet above ground. The nest
hole had been recently chewed around, but I did not determine what
the nest contained.
The Green Rosella is a handsome bird, about a foot long with a bright
yellow head and belly with a greenish tinge; the back is dark green, the
forehead has a bright red band and the cheeks and wing patches azure
blue. The female is identical to the male, but is slighter in build. The
voice is quite musical and consists of two or three notes with occasional
prolonged chatter.
The flight is very undulating with deep loops in rather woodpecker
fashion. They have a habit of flying across the road in front of vehicles
and on two occasions I saw the remains of birds which had been struck
by cars. A more detailed account of this species appeared recently in the
Magazine (vol. 83, p. 142).
Eastern Rosella Platycercus eximus
This is a relatively common bird in Tasmania. Where I was living,
near Hobart, they were frequent and regular visitors to the feeding tables
and are quite rightly a much admired bird. They were, however, not so
widespread as the Green Rosella and are seldom found in very heavy
forest, preferring open woodland and were particularly common in the
sheep farming plains with scattered clumps of eucalyptus. Whilst I was
in Tasmania in later November and December, I saw no signs of young,
but on my return in February, family parties were very evident about
Lauderdale and South Arm. I also encountered Eastern Rosellas at
Richmond, Ross, Great Lakes (3,000 feet), Swansea and Carleton.

is considered to be its breeding headquarters, although it is also found in

During the whole time I was in Tasmania, I saw it on only three occa-

I did only really just pass through this area.
The first ones I saw were in some senile gum trees by the roadside
on the way up to the Great Lake. They were perched in the uppermost
branches and were very nervous, not allowing me to approach closer
than perhaps 100 yards before flying off. The next ones I saw were much
tamer; these were at Broadmarsh when I was being taken to a Peregrine
site. A group of six parrakeets flew into some small bushes and, being
only a few yards away, we got a good view for several minutes before they
flew off*. The third viewing was near Richmond on almost my last day in
Tasmania when I was fishing. A pair flew across the fields and landed
in a tree alongside me. After a few seconds they realised their mistake
and flew off at great speed. They are basically overall light olive-green
with a large blue patch in the bend of the wing and are little larger than
a Budgerigar.
Tawny Frogmouth Podargus strigoides
What extraordinary birds these frogmouths are. They are as large as a
Tawny Owl and are very much the same dark and light grey flecked
colouring, a perfect camouflage for their woodland habitat.
I first saw them at Coles Bay on the east coast of Tasmania and indeed
these were the only ones I saw on the island. They are, I was told, liable
to turn up anywhere. I suspect they are often passed by, for nothing will
persuade them to fly short of knocking them off the perch. The ones at
Coles Bay had with them on nth December, a youngster about three
weeks old and just flying. The parents were very agitated as I was photo-
graphing the fledgling at close range. However, the adult birds would let
me get within six feet of them before they moved off.

Pallid Cuckoo Cuculus pallidus
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.988542133333333" page_id="56386664"  page_num="42" year="" vol="">
Several species of cuckoo visit Tasmania during the summer and this
is the one I saw most commonly. It has a distinctive call and is fond of
sitting on exposed branches, telegraph wires, etc. and hence is easily
spotted. I found a cuckoo's egg in the nest of a Golden Whistler which
could have belonged to this species, for it was present in the area. It is
not a particularly attractive bird, being rather sombre greyish-fawn, pale
underneath with slight barring. In mid-December it was noticeably
abundant near Bridgewater on an open she oak covered hillside. It was
also commonly encountered on the slopes of Mount Wellington.
Kookaburra Dacelo novaeguineae
One of the most characteristic birds of the Australian region. It was
marvellous to hear the demoniac laugh of these birds ringing through the
forests: the cries carried for miles.
It is not native to Tasmania, being introduced many years ago to one or
two areas in the north. It soon established itself and has spread to most

parts of the island and is quite common everywhere, particularly so in
the north and midlands. I encountered it many times and found a nest
of one in a hole in a dead gum tree, about 20 feet above ground level,
in light woodland surrounding the Lagoon of Islands and the Lakes. I
did not find out what the nest contained, but they visited it twice whilst
I was there. It was particularly common in the Freycenit National Park
and in a little chalet where I stayed, one insisted on flying to the window
and attacking its reflection. It was very tame and allowed itself to be
touched. In this park, on 13th December, I nearly ran over a youngster
which had just fledged. It sat in the middle of the road and would not
move. It was a smaller, short-tailed version of the adult.
Welcome Swallow Hirundo neoxena
In Tasmania this is the common swallow and is likely to be seen any-
where. It is very similar to the European Swallow Hirundo rustica , the
only real difference being that it lacks the blue-black bar across the upper
chest. It migrates north from Tasmania in winter, but during my time it
was breeding. I saw several nests in buildings and once in a tiny corrugated
iron shed at 3,000 feet near Lake Pedder. In late December I saw several
congregations of adults and young sitting on barbed wire fences. The
young were only recently out of the nest: I also saw nests on cliffs in
Mount Field Park.
Tree Martin Petrochelidon nigricans
Common in Tasmania. It was often seen in company with swallows,
flying over water and perched on wire fences nearby; however, a far more
typical habitat was open dry forest and clearings in forests, for it is
basically a tree-nesting bird which nests in holes quite high up. I saw
many of them in the light forested woodland up at the Lagoon of Islands
at the Lakes.
Black-faced Cuckoo-Shrike Coracina novaehollandiae
An extremely common bird in Tasmania, usually seen perching high
in gum trees, calling with its very distinctive two syllabled call. It has a
strange habit of flicking its wings after landing on a perch. At Sheffield in
northern Tasmania, I found a nest in the very uppermost branches of a
gum tree between 80 and 100 feet up. The nest was a very small one made
of twigs in a fork in the outer branches. One of the adults was seen to go
onto the nest; otherwise I doubt I would have seen it.
Australian Ground Thrush Zoothera dauma
A Song Thrush sized bird with plumage rather like a Mistle Thrush.
That is the best description I can give. It is greyish-brown with a very
scaled appearance due to dark tips to the body feathers.

Freycenit Park whilst heading through the coastal scrub. They were
calling all the time but I only saw three.
In the Ferntree Gully on Mount Wellington, near Hobart, I was shown
an old nest. It looked very much like a Blackbird's nest and was 10 feet
up in the fronds of a fern.
Superb Blue Wren Malurus cyaneus
These must be one of Australia's loveliest birds. It was an unforgettable
experience seeing my first male Superb Blue Wren. I had just been diving
through some undergrowth to find and photograph some newly hatched
Native Hens when the little bundle of bright blue emerged to the upper-
most tip of the bush and scolded me, his blue plumage absolutely gleaming
in the sun, long tail cocked up right over his back.
This wren is very common in Tasmania and eastern Australia and is
liable to be encountered wherever there is suitable habitat. It prefers low
shrubs in light woodland and in the open. It also is found in gardens where
it is usually most welcome. I searched high and low (mostly low) for a
nest and it was when I had almost given up in early December that I
found one by accident in the bankside of a bend in the dirt road between
Nugent and Sorell. The nest was on the ground built into a clump of
grass. The nest was constructed of grasses and was domed with an opening
in the side. It contained several small young.
Brown Thornbill Acanthiza pusilla
I think one needs to be a Tasmanian or have lived there for some years
before one is able to sort out these little brown mites. Particularly the
Brown and Tasmanian Thornhills are so very similar apart from the
belly colour, but looking at the illustrations in a book is so different from
seeing the birds in the field.
The Brown Thornbill was the species I most commonly encountered
in Tasmania and it was very common everywhere in woodland. I found
two nests both containing three white eggs with brown spots. On ist
December, a domed nest of grasses was found at the Lagoon of Islands
in a small bush, a foot above the ground: the bird was flushed from the
nest. On i8th December I found a nest amongst some grasses hanging
over a stream on a steep wooded slope above Bridgewater. The nest was
three feet above the stream.
Scarlet Robin Fetroica multicolor
These robins are very handsome Australian flycatchers (sometimes
called robin-flycatchers) and are widely distributed throughout the region.
This particular species, mostly black with a white forehead, wing-bar
and belly, has a bright orange chest. It is a common bird throughout
Tasmania except for the thickly forested west. I saw it commonly in dry
sclerophyl forest down the South Arm near Hobart. Several birds were

flitting about on the edge of the woods and a nest was found on a cross
beam of an old shed in a field adjoining the wood. The nest was lined
and ready for eggs and the adults were very agitated. I also found another
nest which belonged to a Scarlet Robin in a root of an upturned tree.
Flame Robin Petroica phoenicea
Another very fine member of the robins. This was seen in many areas
in Tasmania and I was shown one nest containing three eggs in open
forest around the foothills of Mount Wellington. Surprisingly, for all
other robins' nests I had seen were low down, this was about 15 feet up
in a crotch in a gum tree. Later that day I saw another nest quite low
down in a crotch about four feet up; this, however, was empty. In the
lakes at the Lagoon of Islands I found a nest, again in a crotch, this time
about three feet up and this contained three young about four to five days
old. Elsewhere robins were seen in the north up by Sheffield and even
up west towards Lake Fedder.
Fink Robin Petroica rodinogaster
The only place where I saw this species was in rain forest areas in
Tasmania. I first saw one in the Mount Field National Park, when passing
through a gully, thick with tree ferns. There were several robins about
here including one carrying a caterpillar in its beak. The following day
I went out with Mike Newman who has been carrying out an intensive
study of this species up the Fern Tree Gully over the last three years.
A walk up this gully, which, as its name implies, is festooned with tree
ferns, produced five pairs holding territories in barely a quarter of a mile.
He told me that this was one pair less in the same area than last year.
The nest is the most beautiful structure of mosses, lichens and cobwebs
all finely woven together rather like a Chaffinch's nest. They are more
often than not built in tree ferns, or rather the two nests which I saw
were. I also subsequently came across a Pink Robin in the Freycenit
Park which is a relatively dry habitat.
Grey Fantail Rhipidura fulginosa
A lovely little bird, ever present in Tasmania. It was an inquisitive
bird which delighted in scolding whenever its territory was approached.
It was found in all kinds of habitat but preferred light forest and under-
growth.
I found a number of nests in Tasmania; all were works of art, magnifi-
cent structures, beautifully made of cobwebs and fine grasses. One nest
I found was 20 feet up in a gum tree, bound onto a broken branch which
was resting against the trunk and liable to fall down at any moment,
taking the nest with it. This nest was much higher than any other I found,
the majority being six feet or less. On the 28th November, the first nest
I found was just building; however, on the 6th December I found one

containing three half-grown young. Subsequently I found several nests
with eggs, the last being on the 18th December, at Sheffield. Three seems
to be the normal clutch: the eggs are white with reddish-brown spots.
Satin Flycatcher Myiagra cyanoleuca
A very common bird in the right habitat in Tasmania. It prefers open
woodland and spends much of its time in the upper section of trees. It
has a soft distinctive call which is soon picked out by the expert ear. It
was quite a long time before I got a good view of one, but eventually was
rewarded with one almost on the end of my binoculars at the Lagoon
of Islands. It is a glossy blue-black bird with white underparts in the
male, whereas the female is grey with a buff chin and white underparts.
I was shown an old nest of one in some ancient open forest with gnarled
trees and many dead branches. The nest was on one of these horizontal
branches, no more than 30 feet up and was a neat cup of lichens, cobwebs
and grass, very finely worked.
Spotted Fardalote Fardalotus punctatus
The pardalotes were extremely abundant throughout Tasmania,
possibly the most common birds of all, for wherever one went in wood-
land, there were sure to be pardalotes about. I saw quite a number at
Mount Field National Park on 24th November and on the following day
found a nest in a bank in a wood near Seven Mile Beach. There must
have been young ones in the nest as the adults were visiting there with
live food.
Grey-breasted Silvereye Zosterops lateralis
A tiny Wren-sized bird, pale olive-green with a white circle around
the eye, was seen by me on several occasions in Tasmania. I saw them in
gardens in Hobart and Sheffield and also in the more open woodland,
particularly that which had tea tree undergrowth; I also saw them in very
tall forest with thick undergrowth just beyond Maydena in the west.
It is an inquisitive little bird, always on the move searching for insects
in a similar manner to Goldcrests in Britain and I am sure is very bene-
ficial to gardeners, destroying large numbers of aphids and other insects.
Strong-billed Honeyeater Melithreptus validirostris
I saw this species on three occasions. It has a distinctive call, which,
as with all honeyeaters, is the easiest method of identification for the
bird watchers. It is very similar in size and colour to the Black-headed
Honeyeater, but unlike the Black-headed which occurs in the same
habitat, it has a white nape and white beard. I saw it at Ridgeway and
Shoebridge Trail near Mount Wellington and also in the tall rain forest
along the road between Maydina and Lake Pedder.

Black-headed Honeyeater Melithreptus affinis
Another of the honeyeaters to be found only in Tasmania and, like the
others, it is reasonably common. I saw it very abundantly up at the
Lagoon of Islands where there were several groups in one area. They were
well below the canopy which was not particularly high anywhere. There
was a relatively open secondary level of tea tree bushes and they were
mostly on the edge of this. There were young on the wing on ist December,
which seemed early. On one occasion in the same area, I flushed a pair
which were very attentive to a solitary tea tree bush in the wood. There
was obviously something there, for they came within two or three feet
when I looked at the bush, but I could find nothing. In some very open
dry sclerophyl forest up by Lake Meadowbank, there were several of
this honeyeater high up in the canopy, at 80-100 feet. I also saw one
being hotly pursued by a Yellow-throated Honeyeater one day.
Crescent Honeyeater Phylidonyris pyrrhoptera
Another of the common Tasmanian honeyeaters which is also found in
South-Eastern Australia. Wherever I saw it, it was in relatively thick
forest and particularly out west, towards Lake Pedder where, whenever
we stopped the car along this road, we heard this bird singing in the
undergrowth. I also saw it up in the Cradle Mountain where it was
common in quite thick forest with secondary tea tree undergrowth.
Along the Shoebridge Trail in the foothills of Mount Wellington, I was
shown an old nest right in the centre of a very large clump of cutting
grass. It was cup-shaped and made of grasses.
New Holland Honeyeater Phylidonyris novaehollandiae
The most attractive of the honeyeaters which I encountered in Australia.
It is very similar to the next species excepting that it has a white beard
and throat. It is basically black with white streaks and has yellow wings
and yellow edges to the tail. I saw several in open woodland in southern
Tasmania and on the east coast in an old granite quarry near Coles Bay.
There were clumps of myrtle dotted around and the honeyeaters were
moving back and forth from one clump to another in quite large groups,
as many as 20 in some. They were very shy and could only be observed
when I was well hidden. They were also amongst the shrubbery in the
Bluestone Bay in another part of the Freycenit peninsula.
Noisy Miner Manorina melanocephala
Boisterous, noisy, inquisitive and often very aggressive birds. They live
in colonies and woe betide any bird which strays into their territory.
They will attack with some venom and although I did not see them actually
maim or kill any bird, I am sure they are quite capable of doing this. On
one occasion I saw a group attack a Green Rosella, the birds got it onto
the ground and had it pinned down. I intervened at this stage, otherwise

<bodyText confidence="0.990058926829268" page_id="56386670"  page_num="48" year="" vol="">
I am sure they would have killed it.
The bird is about the size of a European Blackbird and is grey and white.
It is very common throughout Tasmania around built up areas and there
were regular visitors to our garden near Hobart. They must be very
early nesters, for one of the first I saw on 22nd November, was a pair
feeding a fledged youngster by our house. They were feeding it on
caterpillars mostly. As the name suggests, they are a very noisy birds and
they give their presence away by their calls long before being seen. Apart
from gardens they seem to prefer open woodland, roadside clumps of
trees, etc. I did not see them in thick woodland.
Yellow Wattlebird Anthochaera paradoxa
This is a large bird, almost the size of a crow, although greatly slimmer,
which is found only in Tasmania. It is in fact the largest of the honeyeater
family, Meliphagidae. It has a very distinctive call which is unmusical
and is usually the first indication one has that they are about. I saw them
very commonly in the central Lakes area near Lagoon of Islands particu-
larly, where they were calling on all sides. They invariably were right up
in the very tops of trees and from my experience seemed to be found in
dry, open woodland rather than the western rain forest.
I was shown a nest up in the lakes which was right at the top of a
eucalyptus tree, some 80 feet up. It was a large bulky nest made of twigs.
Little Wattlebird Anthochaera chrysoptera
This species is relatively common in Tasmania and I saw it in a number
of localities, firstly at Port Arthur where I particularly noted the brown
inner part of the flight feathers when it was on the wing. It was very
common around Coles Bay and I was fortunate enough to find a nest in
a small eucalyptus wood on farmland at Sheffield. It was right up in the
very top of the tallest trees, 100 feet or more. It was a small, twiggy
structure in a fork and was only spotted because I was watching one of
the adults and it moved across the canopy and flew up to the nest and
settled onto it.
Beautiful Firetail Emblema bella
The only grassfinch species found in Tasmania. I presume it is a very
common bird in sclerophyl forest for I found so many old nests, but only
saw very few birds. The nests were usually in the same sort of situation,
i.e. in tea tree bush secondary growth in tall forest. I saw several nests in
rain forests between Maydena and Lake Pedder in the south-west. I also
saw several nests in tea tree bushes in the South Arm; likewise the foothills
of Mount Wellington. They were all old nests. The few birds I did see were
all flying at speed across the road in front of my car, but I was able to
identify the bright flash of the red rump.

Dusky Wood Swallow Artamus cyanopterus
This species was the only one of the family Artamidae that I saw in
Tasmania. Very common in places and the preferred habitat was open,
dry sclerophyl woodland where one was likely to come across groups of
them anywhere. I found four nests of this species in either forks or holes
in trees between three feet off the ground to 20 feet up a tree. The nest
was usually made of fine twigs and was an open cup. Two of these nests
contained an egg and the third contained three young, one week old,
the fourth being empty. The colonies each seemed to be grouped into
parties of up to seven pairs and birds acted in an agitated manner when
one was close to the nest. It is a summer migrant to Tasmania going north
during the winter.
Grey Butcherbird Cracticus torquatus
This is the only butcherbird in Tasmania. The first I saw was on 24th
November at the Salmon Ponds near New Norfolk. There were a pair
attending to a youngster which had just left the nest a day or two before.
It was calling wildly and was fed every few minutes by one or other parent
on insects and caterpillars. They seem to be quite at home in relatively
open country and gardens, etc.
White-backed Magpie Gymnorhina hypoleuca
This "magpie 5 * is very common throughout Tasmania and was often to
be seen sitting on the telegraph wires outside our house, warbling away
with its very pleasing song. The birds seem to prefer the vicinity of
country farmsteads to almost any other habitat and one could almost
guarantee to find a family group in the vegetation around country proper-
ties. Even at the end of November there were full grown young on the
wing, so they must be early nesters. The magpies are Jackdaw shaped
with black and white patches and I would think this is how they got their
name originally by the similarity in colouring between this and the
European species.
Black Currawong Strepera fuliginosa
The most common of the two Tasmanian currawongs, this species
seems to be the one most often found at high altitudes where it is very
common in the scrub woodlands, particularly in the Great Lakes area.
They were very numerous near the visitor centres at Cradle Mountain
and Mount Field National Park, where they become very confiding and
will snatch sandwiches, etc. from the fingers. This, of course, affords an
excellent close up view of them and very noticeable are the piercing yellow
eye and powerful heavy black beak. Near Mount Wellington, along the
Shoebridge Trail, I was shown a nest about 60 feet up in the fork of a
eucalpytus tree. It was rather flimsy, crow-like in structure. One could
see through part of the nest and on 6th December it contained half-grown

young. On 14th December, I found a nest by Lake Leake in a eucalyptus
about 30-40 feet up and the bird was incubating.
Chinking Currawong Strepera versicolor arguta
The first of this species I saw was at Ridgeway in the foothills of
Mount Wellington. The large white wing patches were very noticeable as
the birds made a long glide down the hillside. They are very similar to
the Black Currawing in shape and size, but in colour they show a white
vent and large white patches on the wing. I saw them on a variety of
occasions in Tasmania, often but not always at a lower elevation than the
Black and invariably in well wooded areas. The calls of these two species
are very different and very unmusical.
Forest Raven Corvus tasmanicus
Found only in Tasmania and one or two places on the mainland. On
25th November, I saw a pair with two newly fledged young near Lauder-
dale, in south Tasmania and on 30th November, I found a nest 50 feet
up a eucalyptus tree in dry sclerophyl near Lake Maydena. This bird
was very common throughout Tasmania and in all types of habitat, but
was most often seen in open country.

By Edward M. Barrows (Georgetown University, Washington D.C.)
Many aspects of the biology of the Eastern Mockingbird Mimus
polyglottos polyglottos (L.), or its close relatives, have been studied (e.g.,
Visscher, 1928; Laskey, 1933, 1935, 1936, 1944, 1962; Michener and
Michener, 1935; Bent, 1948; Hailman, i960; Martin, i960; Selander and
Hunter, i960; Horwich, 1965, 1966, 1969; Wildenthal, 1965; Adkisson,
1966; Berger, 1966; Hunt, 1968; Howard, 1974 and Barrows, in prep.).
However, recovery from injuries in mocking birds evidently has not been
reported.
In the course of a study on feeding behaviour (Barrows, in prep.) of
young mockingbirds, Mimus p. polyglottos, four injured birds were
examined. One bird, M2, was injured when it made a crash landing in the
laboratory and two other birds, Mio and Mu, were given to me by
people who hand-reared them after rescuing them from domestic cats
that injured them. The fourth bird, M4, fell out of its nest when it was
about four days old. M4 was hand-reared by Mrs. K. E. Townsend until
it could feed itself. While she cared for M4, it lost the ability to stand or
locomote, possibly because it ate some insects that carried insecticide,
had malnutrition, or both.
This note discusses aspects of behavioural changes displayed by the
M. polyglottos as they recovered from injuries. Jan Proctor and M. Guy
made many observations on Mio; J. M. Brown, on Mu; and Mrs. K. E.
Townsend, on M4 .1 made all of the observations on M2. Alphanumerical
designations of birds apply to the same birds the behaviour of which is
reported elsewhere (Barrows, in prep.).
The birds were collected within 32 km or in Washington D. C. After I
obtained the birds in June and July, 1976, they were maintained in a
laboratory room in separate cages under a natural photoperiod of indirect
or fluorescent light at from 15 0 to 28* C until April, 1977. M2 was fed
liquified food from a large eyedropper until it fed itself. This food was
prepared in a food blender and contained varying proportions of water,
different types of canned dogfoods, human infant vitamins, wheat germ,
larvae of the mealworm Tenebrio molitor L. (Coleoptera: Tenebrionidae),
nymphs and adults of the cockroach Blatella germanica (L.) (Orthoptera:
Blattidae), chicken starter feed and coarse sand. When the birds could
feed themselves, they were given water ad libidum and food (fruits,
vegetables, tenebrionids, drosophilids, blattids, dogfood) every day.

According to Eugene S. Morton (National Zoological Park, pers. com-
munication), M4 is a male, Mio is a female. M2 is probably a female
because "she" did not sing in the 11 months that she was maintained in
the laboratory; whereas some of the other M. polyglottos did sing. Bird
ages were estimated by examination of feather development as described
by Horwich (1966).
Bird M2
Age 13 days: I captured M2 when it was a fledgling that could not fly
well.
Age 23 days: M2 hopped about 1 m off a table while its cage was being
cleaned and it landed on a linoleum floor. After it hit the floor, it moved
clumsily by pushing its body with its wings and right leg when I
approached it. When I returned it to its cage, it cowered in the cage and
breathed heavily. Prior to its accident, it vigorously hopped around its
cage and frequently swung on its swing.
An X-ray of M2's left leg revealed no broken bones. Earl O. Strimple,
D. V. M,, examined M2 and hypothesised that it had nerve damage in
both legs. Strimple prescribed two drops of dexamithosone (0.1 mg per
drop) per day, and I gave M2 one drop in the morning and one in the
evening until it was 38 days old. While I hand-fed M2, it was given
about 5 g of liquified food and 3 ml of water about twice per hour for 12
hours per day.
While it was from 23 to 25 days old, it was kept on paper towelling in a
small metal cage with a coarse screen front. The towelling became soaked
with water which passed through it, and the paper was changed from four
to seven times per day.
At 23 days of age, M2 ate well and rose a few centimetres on its right
leg when it defecated. It lost down feathers from its rump, probably due
to resting on moist towelling.
Age 24 days: M2 struggled to rise on its right leg. It rested obliquely
with its rump toward the front of the cage and defecated through the
screen. One of its tail feathers broke off. M2 gave a low-volume, high-
pitched whistle when it was hungry and continually watched human
movements throughout the day. M2 held its rump up and toward the
cage front, keeping its rump fairly dry. When I placed it outside its cage,
it clumsily hopped on its right leg.
Age 25 days: I returned M2 to its original cage. It hopped around the
cage floor on its right leg on a perch 4 cm from the floor. M2 5 s wings and
tail were used for balancing as it hopped and perched, and it continuously
struggled to maintain balance. Sometimes it pecked at its left foot. By the
end of the day, M2 hopped up on a perch that was about 10 cm above the
cage floor.
Age 26 days: M2 used its left leg to scratch its head and left side and
slightly to support its body as it perched. It used its bill to aid in placing

its left foot on its right one.
Age 27 days: M2 grasped its right foot with its left one as it stood on
its perch. It stretched its left wing while standing on its right foot, but
almost fell off its perch when it tried to stretch its right wing. M2 still
showed difficulty in maintaining balance while standing, but it rested
about motionless when it crouched down on a perch. It showed great
difficulty in keeping its balance on its perch when it tried to preen its tail
and right side of its body. Sometimes it perched with its legs crossed and
with its left foot lightly grasping the perch.
Age 28 days: M2 placed its left foot on its right foot while it hopped
on its right foot. While leaning to the left to drink water out of a dish, it
placed the tip of its partially spread left wing against the perch to balance
itself.
Age 29 days: M2 stood on the cage floor with both feet on the floor.
While perching, it placed most of its left foot on the perch, having only its
fourth left toe on its right foot. M2 no longer partially spread its left wing
when it leaned to the left to drink water out of a dish.
Age 31 days: M2 perched with both feet separated and on the perch.
Age 35 days: M2 was very active, vigorously hopping and flying about
a large cage (about 490,000 cm 3 ) to which it was transferred.
Age 39 days: M2 still did not perch on its left leg alone. However, it
was able to put much of its weight on its left foot when it partially spread
its right wing.
Age 41 days: When I approached its cage with the food dropper, M2
flew to the side of the cage and held onto its wire sides with both feet.
M2 *s body faced upwards, and it held its bill open.
Age 43 days: M2 lost its balance when it tried to stand on its left leg
and preen its right wing.
Age 52 days: M2 escaped from its cage during its cleaning, and flew
and landed without apparent difficulty.
Age 231 days and younger: M2 finished moulting when it was about 112
days old, and its plumage was in fair condition. At 231 days of age and
weeks before this age, M2 snapped its bill at my hand and bit it if I
placed my hand too near. M2 took only partial baths in that it dipped its
head and neck into a bowl of water and shook its entire body as though it
were bathing it. It cleaned the sides of its head on its perches; however,
other captive M. polyglottos scratched sides of their heads with their toes.
M2 stood on its left leg but showed difficulties in balancing. M2*s left
heel stuck out to the side of its body about 1 cm more than its right heel.
Tectrices of its right wing were much less preened than those of its left
wing. M2*s plumage was in general disarray compared to nine other
captive M. polyglottos maintained under similar conditions. Four of its
tail feathers were broken off at about their centres.

Bird M4
Age 6 days: M4 was found on the ground by Mrs. K. E. Townsend.
Age 15 days: Up to this age, M4 was lively and developing well. At
15 days, it no longer could stand, possibly because it accidently ate some
insects that had been sprayed with insecticide, had malnutrition, or both.
A veterinarian prescribed Nutri-cal (R) (Evsco) and bone shavings to
supplement M^'s diet, and they were given to it daily.
Age 24 days: M4 started to stand on its feet.
Age 26 days: M4 started to walk and preen a lot.
Age 28 days: M4 started to stand on one foot alone.
Age 29 days: M4's toes started to straighten out.
Age 233 days: M4 flew, hopped and walked about the laboratory. M4's
second, third and fourth toes still curved inward, but it was able to grasp
well with them. Tectrices of its left wing were not preened well, suggesting
that it had difficulty standing on its right leg alone while preening its
left wing.
Bird Mio
Age 13 days: Mio was rescued from a domestic cat by J. Proctor when
she heard the bird give loud distress calls. Mio's legs seemed dislocated,
and its right wing was cut and bleeding. For seven days, Mio was main-
tained on a heating pad and hand-fed with bits of meat and fruit. On the
day of its injury, it was given several drops of whiskey and ampicillin.
During recovery of its wing, Proctor applied cortisone salve (with thioform
hypochloride) on the wound. For the first several days, Mio was on its
side on the heating pad, and then it rested on its ventral side.
Age 20 days: Mio was off the pad, fed itself, and hopped on its right
leg.
Age 27 days: Mio also used its left leg for hopping.
Age 41 days: I obtained Mio from J. Proctor and M. Guy.
Age 235 days: Mio was very active in a large cage in the laboratory,
it bathed frequently, and moulted into adult plumage. Mio usually held
the tip of its right wing about 2 cm below the tip of its left wing. Mio's
plumage was in fine condition. Mio usually gave low-volume distress
(or scolding) calls when I approached its cage.
Bird Mu
Age 13 days and older: Mr. J. M. Brown obtained Mu after the right
side of its head had been wounded by a domestic cat. Mil's legs and
wings seemed unharmed. Mu was hand-fed bits of fruit and beef several
times an hour between 0700 and 1900 hr. Its head healed, but its right
eye was about half the size of its left one and apparently not functional.
Mn was very active and walked and flew around the Browns' back porch,
investigated objects in the porch including pieces of paper, leaves and
debris.

Age 80 days: Mi i started moulting.
Age 87 days: I obtained Mu from J. M. Brown. Mu readily perched
on human fingers and did not seem disturbed by human movements.
Unfortunately, it died after only two days in the laboratory, possibly
because of the environmental change, food change, or both. Mr. and Mrs.
Brown were still hand-feeding Mu when I obtained it, although it also
fed itself. Mu might not have fed itself adequately in the laboratory.
In nature, it is unlikely that injured birds such as those described in
this paper would have recovered because of their vulnerability to
predators, starvation or both. All studied birds showed some external
evidence of being injured even after their wounds had healed. Because of
their disabilities, even if they would reach adulthood, these birds probably
would have lower fitnesses in nature than uninjured M. polyglottos , in
view of the aggressive and territorial behaviour of this species.

By L. Gibson (Burnaby, B.C. Canada)
Some young Gouldian Finches Chloebia gouldiae , when imported from
England, appeared to be so fit and well feathered that they were not put
into any quarantine. Two days after arrival one began to sneeze: this
became worse and the bird started to cough. Suspecting an upper
respiratory tract infection, an antibiotic was given. Although the bird
never discharged from the nostrils or beak, some of the resident Gouldians,
with which they had been put, began to sneeze about a fortnight after
their contact and the other imported birds then showed the same
symptoms.
The three antibiotics tried made no difference and by now the birds
were sneezing at five to ten second intervals. They continued to eat, but
the continual coughing and sneezing made this difficult and their sleep
must also have been interrupted. After three weeks one bird died and
cultures were made from various parts of the respiratory tract. Slides
were also prepared from the material of the mouth, nostrils, trachea and
lungs, but examination and culture proved inconclusive.
A week later I happened, by chance, to read a report on lung mites.
These have been recorded from a few avian species and amongst these
was the Gouldian Finch. This report rang an immediate bell, for, although
terse, it did explain the puzzling lack of any response to the antibiotics.
Fortunately I still had the slides and a quick search soon revealed three
mites from the trachea. They had not been seen on the first examination
because too high a magnification had been employed, but now with a low
magnification, they were only too readily seen. As the situation was very
critical (six of seven birds showed symptoms) a "No-Pest-Strip" was
hung inside the cage (measuring 41 x 18 x 38 inches) from a perch. The

active ingredient of "Mo-Fest-Strip" is 19% Dichlorvos (this is sold in
Britain as "Vapona Strip"). The cage was almost completely enclosed
save for an area 22 x ly inches. In 24 hours the birds seemed improved,
but the change after 48 hours was dramatic for, except for one which
wheezed a little, the finches seemed normal in their behaviour and were
eating well The strip was kept in the cage for three weeks. Later, when
the birds were moved to a large indoor flight measuring 19 x 5 x 5 feet, a
strip was hung permanently to the wire. Many of the assorted Australian
and parrot finches it contained nested successfully. Another suspected
case in a box cage measuring 24 x 18 x 16 inches was treated by hanging
a strip inside for four months and the birds inside remained well.
Little is known of the method of contagion. The very rapid spread, in
this instance where strict hygiene was observed, including daily changing
of the paper covering on the floor of the cage as well as the food and water
vessels, suggests the mite is inhaled and that no stage of development
takes place outside the host. It is strange that lung mites have not, as far
as I know, been reported from the Bengalese Finch Lonchura striata , for
this species is frequently used to foster Gouldian chicks. Diagnosis could
only be confirmed by demonstrating the parasite, but the symptoms
outlined above appear to be pathognomic. The earliest evidence of
infestation may be wheezing after exercise and particularly when the bird
is caught in a net. It would appear that the treatment outlined above is
safe, for many of the treated birds have since nested quite successfully
and no further case of the disease has occurred. If the strips are safe with
Gouldian Finches, they are likely to be safe for other birds and if a
Dichlorvos strip were made a permanent feature of every bird room it
might prevent infection and would also serve to eliminate red mite. The
species of mite may be Stemostoma tracheacolum s reported in Gouldian
Finches in South Africa in 1959 and first of all in Canaries in 1948.

THE PHEASANTS OF THE WORLD. By Jean Delacour. Second
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.997381170731707" page_id="56386680"  page_num="58" year="" vol="">
edition 1977. Pp. 395. 33 plates (17 in colour and 16 in monochrome),
21 maps and diagrams. Published in conjunction with The World
Pheasant Association by Spur Publications, Hindhead, Surrey.
Price #18.
This was first published in 1951, being then by far the most important
work on the subject since William Beebe's monograph of the pheasants
which appeared between 1918 and 1922 in four volumes with the same
author's pheasants, their lives and homes, a condensed version of the
monograph, coming a little later. Mons Delacour's work had, however, in
addition to the ornithological information, almost all that was then known
about the care and breeding of pheasants in captivity.
The present edition is revised, the knowledge gained since 1951 being
incorporated into it: there is also an additional coloured plate, a fine
illustration of the Blood Pheasant by R. David Digby forming the
frontispiece, the remainder being, as in the first edition, by J. C. Harrison.
It is of interest to note that the guineafowl and grouse are included by the
author as subfamilies of the family Phasianidae, but most systematists
have regarded them as being distinct families, Numididae and Tetraonidae.
However, for the purposes of this book the term "pheasant" is taken to
mean those species of the Phasianinae (tribe Fhasianini) of 16 genera
distinguished from such as the partridges and francolins by, among other
factors, characteristics like the brightly coloured plumage and spectacular
displays of most of the males. Included are the jungle fowl and peafowl
together with the single African species Afropavo congensis.
In the nature of things many species of pheasant are difficult to study
in the wild state and a good deal remains to be learned about them, but
most have shown themselves adaptable to life in captivity, breeding when
given suitable conditions: consequently they are a group that can be
helped by aviculture so that species now threatened in the wild can be
preserved and propagated in captivity until such time as their habitats can ,
be restored and the birds reinstated in at least part of their natural range.
Needless to say, this will depend on healthy stock being bred for perhaps
very many generations and that makes the best avicultural advice so
essential.
Under the heading of General Account, the advice given in the first
edition is repeated in this one with, at the end of it under the sub-heading
Modern Developments, up to date advice in summary form by D.
Grenville Roles. It would have been better, surely, to revise the latter
part of this chapter, giving much more detailed advice on the modern
avicultural techniques, since what was the best practice 26 years ago is
now only of historical or academic interest. Such great advances have been

BIRDS. Compiled by Loyl Stromberg. 1977. Fp. 88. Numerous
photographs and text figures. Published by Stromberg Publishing
Company, Pine River, Minnesota 56474. Price $4.95.
This paper-back consists of contributions from many sources as well as
some original material from individual authors, all collated by Loyl
Stromberg and ranging widely among birds that are at all commonly kept
from ratites to finches and including domesticated birds. Naturally in a
book of this size, many families are not mentioned. Included is a history
of domestic chick sexing, laparotomy technique (only to be attempted by
the qualified), ancient beliefs, lists of game bird clubs and recommended
magazines as well as many useful "tips". Some of the advice on sexing of
parrots is all very well if one has a number together for comparison, but
it is no help to be told, for instance, that the head and beak are larger or
smaller if one has only a single bird for which to find a mate. The "pelvic
bone" test is repeated, but surely while the ends of the pubic bones are
apart in birds that are laying eggs or have recently done so, are they not
as close together in females that have never laid as they are in males?
The book was evidently prepared and printed before the technique of
sexing birds by hormonal assay of the faeces became known. This is
rather expensive at present and presumably not every laboratory is
equipped to do it, but naturally it has the advantage that the bird need
not be handled.
This small book is a useful aid in the sexing of a good many of the
commonly kept birds--and one uncommonly kept, the Woodcock,
presumably the North American Scolopax minor , as well as, in the Old
World, two species of North American grouse.

CAROTENOID PIGMENTS IN BIRDS
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.991193933333333" page_id="56386682"  page_num="60" year="" vol="">
Prof. Adkisson's observations regarding the red pigment in the plumage
of male Pine Grosbeaks (vol. 83, p. 195) and those of Mr. Restall regarding
the Troupial (vol. 83, p. 206) suggest a simple way whereby aviculturists s
who keep such birds can perhaps preserve the natural colour in species
that will eat mealworms. The Virginian Cardinal is one that comes
readily to mind.
By giving raw carrot to mealworms, the birds will, each time a mealworm
is eaten, get a small amount of carrot present in the digestive tract of the
mealworm and throughout the year might thus be enabled to store in the
body sufficient of the carotenoid pigment to supply the natural colour to
new feathers. Mealworms are fond of carrot and it also has the advantage
of not readily going mouldy in the box. Naturally the bran or whatever
farinaceous food is given to the mealworms must also be supplied to them,
but although they appear to thrive on a dry diet, they are certainly fond
of moisture which may also accelerate their growth.

BACK NUMBERS OF THE AVICULTURAL MAGAZINE

After many years of storage, the Society's large stock of back numbers
has at last found a home at our new address at Ascot and for some months
now volunteers have been unpacking, sorting and stocktaking some
25,000 copies. The result of their labours has been compiled into the
first comprehensive list to be published for many years which is now to
be circulated to members.
Whilst it is disappointing to find that many of the earlier volumes are
incomplete, it is still remarkable that so much has survived for some
eighty years, through many vicissitudes including two World Wars, and
there is bound to be a great demand for singles amongst the earlier
issues in order to complete volumes which members have already been
collecting together.
Through the years many beautiful colour plates have been published
in the Magazine by such renowned artists as H. Gronvold, H. Goodchild,
Roland Green and D. M. Henry, and a list of the plates (1896-1973)
compiled by Rosemary Low was published in vol. 80 (1974).
A more daunting task would be to compile a comprehensive subject
and author Index for the Magazine, bringing up to date the Index which
Dr. Hopkinson compiled for the years 1894-1930. A long job, but the
result would be of tremendous help to all aviculturists and would be of
particular interest to new members who often wish to purchase back
numbers containing articles on their especial interests.
Surprisingly the Society itself does not possess a complete set of
Magazines and during the recent sorting out the opportunity was taken
to collect together a set of every issue available with a view to adding to
them as and when possible and eventually binding completed volumes
for the Society's library. Needless to say, donations of complete volumes
already bound would be most gratefully received.

THE BREEDING OF FOUR SPECIES OF PIONUS
By J. Stoodley (Lovedean, Hants)
Parrots of the genus Pionus are, in my opinion, the most fascinating and
delightful of all the American parrots. Like the human race, they come
in various colours with individual personalities: they will love you or
hate you, but will never ignore you.
My wife and I have some 36 of these parrots in our collection, including
the Blue-headed P. menstruus, Coral-billed P. sordidus corallinus , Maxi-
milian's P. maximiliani, Plum-crowned P. tumultuosus, White-capped
P. senilis, Dusky P. fuscus and Bronze-winged P. chalcopterus . They
are housed mainly in pairs in aviaries measuring 13 x 6J x 3J feet wide
with a shelter at the northern end of each flight. The floors are of concrete
which makes for easy cleaning of the shelters where the food is put and
the concrete floors of the flights are slightly sloping so as to allow drainage
of excess water and are covered with a few inches depth of small stones
amongst which, in summer, a crop of green food grows. All the aviaries
are fully roofed over with "agricultural glass" or corrugated translucent
sheeting; the fronts are also glazed, this protection being necessary because
the site is very exposed to the north and east.
To provide humidity, there is an overhead mist-spray system and it is
one of my great pleasures to see the wealth of colour when the parrots
bathe in this misty rain. There is also fluorescent strip lighting which
allows the birds to feed early on winter mornings. Our birds are in full
voice by 4.0 a.m. in winter and 2.0 a.m, in spring. The aviaries are free
of vermin such as stoats, weasels, rats and large mice, the smaller mice
being kept down by means of a "varnish" which is placed under boxes
in the service corridors and this is most effective.
Nesting pairs are given soft food daily together with soaked seed, these
items being increased in quantity when there are young. The diet other-
wise consists of soaked sunflower seed, maize, wheat, beans and buck-
wheat, ripe berries and fruit in season, carrot, celery and green food such
as land cress (in winter) and other kinds as available. Small live branches
are provided, for the leaf buds are eaten. Occasionally cooked rabbit or
beef is given. The Pionus we find will eat almost anything and more than
is good for them sometimes. Pairs are given a choice of nest boxes and they
usually prefer the small ones. Mating is very much of communal interest.

the birds becoming noisy and excited. The mating pair make a noise
different from the usual calls and this brings immediate silence among
the others, the noise being continued throughout the mating. The pair
stand with both feet grasping the perch and they back toward each other,
this position being held for some time and when the pairing is over the
noise is discontinued and the neighbours become noisy again. Eggs are
laid generally every other day, the number to a clutch being three or four
and incubation is 26 days or thereabouts. The male will sometimes sit
inside the nesting box and will continue to feed his mate after the chicks
have hatched and later will also feed the chicks.
Previous to the 1977 season the glass tops and fronts of the aviaries
were removed in the spring, but I felt this to be a contributory factor in
the large number of chicks dead in the shell. For the 1977 season the
aviary tops were not removed and the glass fronts only opened in very
hot weather. There was an improvement on the previous years' breeding
(Bronze-winged in 1973; Blue-headed and Maximilian's in 1975) for I
was fortunate enough in 1977 to breed four species, so in future the aviary
glass will again be left in place.
The species that bred in 1977 were:
Blue-headed. Three young fledged and like other Pionus chicks they
were of brilliant hue, the plumage appearing more blue than green, but
they lacked the dark ear patches of the parents and also the blue of the
head. Two had red above the bill extending well over the head, but the
third had an orange forehead. About a month after the young were fully
fledged, the brilliant bluish plumage gave way to green with a little blue
on the head and red under tail-coverts. After six months there is still a
considerable amount of red on the heads of the young birds which, of
course, is completely absent in the adults.
Bronze-winged. I was especially pleased to see two chicks in 1977,
for they make a second generation of home-bred birds, the mother being
reared here in 1973. In 1976 she laid two clutches of four eggs, but the
chicks failed to get out of the shell. Like the parents, the chicks have sky
blue colouring under the wings and bronze markings above with an
overall colouring of dark ("navy") blue; they have a red area around the
eye and red under tail-coverts. The young have a difference of colour
about the wing area, one being the normal bronze and the other a greenish-
bronze. It will be interesting to see if this is a sex difference.
Coral-billed. These birds are dark green, lighter on the breast, and the
feathers of the head and neck are edged with blue. The bill is coral pink
and the under tail-coverts red. Our two birds were acquired from different
sources in 1975 and they have been in their outdoor aviary since the spring
of 1976. Of the nest boxes offered they preferred one measuring 18 x 8

x 8 inches and they made a long job of enlarging the entrance hole. Three
eggs were laid and incubation started on the 27th April 1977. I did not
see the hen off the nest during the incubation time and the cock was most
attentive to her.
The chicks were first seen on the 24th May when they were covered
in creamy-white down, but six days later much of this had gone and the
chicks were almost naked. Their eyes were fully open at 20 days and the
pin feathers were now to be seen as well as some pink on the bills. The
three young fledged and were removed from the parents at 12 weeks old.
These chicks were beautifully coloured with blue, pink, golden-green
and almost gold on the breast and about the head, but the brilliance of
the colours seemed to fade, as did the facial red soon after the birds
were separated from the parents.
Plum-crowned. These are what I consider gems of aviculture. They
have a most attractive colouring as the plate shows. We obtained our
birds early in 1974 and after acclimatisation they were allowed the partners
of their choice, with the hope that they were three pairs. One pair took
an interest in a nesting log in April 1976 and soon produced four eggs,
all of which were infertile. In April 1977 they nested in the log again,
four eggs being laid, but no incubation of them taking place. Two weeks
later a further clutch of four eggs was laid and again the hen failed to
incubate. We fostered the eggs to other birds and put the last one into an
incubator: to our great delight it hatched after 26 days, a lively noisy
chick. The feeding was simple and was done by means of a dropper every
two hours. The food was ground up kernels of sunflower seed mixed with
Farex and it was, of course, given warm, care being taken not to overfeed.
The mixture was freshly mixed for each meal and once each day some
green food was liquidised and a few drops were added to the mixture.
The bird was not fed during the night. The chick was taken from the
incubator when four days old and put into a container warmed to 96*F.
Progress was maintained and after the first seven days I had real hopes
of success. At this time the white down disappeared to leave a nearly
naked youngster: the eyes were fully open at 20 days and pin feathers
started to appear. The growth rate seemed not so fast as in naturally fed
young of other species, but the feathers continued to grow quickly. We
soon had to put the chick into a cage and the feeding became rather more
difficult because a more varied diet was being given. The activity of the
chick caused a problem and somehow its chest became bruised, the
bruised area becoming hardened, but we hoped that when the bruised
area sloughed off, all would be well. To our horror, however, the lower
part of the bruise lifted and some food came out, so the bruising was
more extensive than I had thought. Our veterinary surgeon was not very
hopeful of success and, having regard to the small size of the chick,
neither was I. The crop needed 12 stitches with seven more to bring the

outer skin together and after the operation the feeding was a problem,
for whereas before io ml was given at each feeding, now only ij ml
could safely be given, so the meals had to be more frequently given.
The bird survived this difficult time and at eight months old it could
be treated as a normal bird, thanks to our very good local veterinary sur-
geon. The young bird's colouring is somewhat duller than that of its
parents, but it is equal to them in size. As our birds were presumably
among the first Pionus tumultuosus to come to this country, there seems
reason to suppose that our young one is the first to be reared here.
As described, the Coral-billed Parrot Pionus sordidus (.corallinus ) and
the Plum-crowned P. tumultuosus were reared during 1977 by Mr. and
Mrs. J. Stoodley, and appear to be the first successes in this country, but
anyone knowing of others is asked to inform the Hon. Secretary.

THE BREEDING AND BEHAVIOUR OF THE BLACK-BILLED
WOOD DOVE
Turtur abyssinica
By Jeffrey Trollope (Hounslow, Middlesex)
The genus Turtur consists of five species of African wood doves, small
to medium in size. The largest, T. brehmeri (which I have not seen in
life) is apparently the most striking and very rarely imported. The smallest
is the elegant T. tympanistria.

When established, T. abyssinica , like its more commonly imported
congenerics, T. chalcospilos and T. afer, is a comparatively steady bird
which adjusts well to aviary life. The main disadvantages with this trio
are that they are apparently impossible to sex visually, and because of
their morphological similarity, are often confused with each other. This
paper describes the breeding of captive T. abyssinica with notes on their
behaviour.

skin, light grey: crown and nape bluish-grey. Upperparts light brown,
shading to light grey below with a mauve tinge, more pronounced on the
breast. The closed wing shows five iridescent spade-shaped spots, a
group of three on the greater coverts, and two on the secondaries. These
spots are joined at the larger end of the 'spade', giving an appearance at
any distance of two small blotches. The tips of the primaries are blackish;
the underside of the wing chestnut, sometimes showing a chestnut edge
when the wing is closed. There are two greyish-black bars across the
base of the tail; the tail feathers are grey with black tips. Legs and feet
dark red or dark purplish-black.
Young birds at 27 days
Bill dark grey, lighter at tip. Irides brown; forehead, cheeks and ear-
coverts whitish-grey; crown and nape grey. Upperparts brownish-grey
shading to whitish-grey on underparts. The feathers on the chest and
abdomen are tipped with brown and dark brown, giving a barred effect.
The closed wing shows ill-defined black spots, which are not iridescent;
primaries and secondaries grey, some feathers tipped with dark brown
and chestnut; underside of wing chestnut. Tail feathers grey, tipped with
black. Feet and legs dark grey.
Distribution and habitat
Goodwin (1970) gives the distribution as the drier parts of tropical
Africa, north of the range of T. chalcospilos , from Senegal to Eritrea and
northern Ethiopia. The habitat is dry scrub and woodland, as recorded
for T. chalcospilos.
Birds and housing
Six T. abyssinica were purchased in July 1975 and these birds were
housed in outside planted aviaries. Between December and March they
were housed in box cages measuring 2 x 0.5 x 0.75 m high, in an outside
garden bird room heated at approximately 50*F (io*C). The birds wore
coloured identification rings.
Food and feeding
The birds are fed on a mixture of millets, small canary seed, niger,
maw, dari, finely kibbled maize and wheat. Ground cuttlefish bone, fine
oystershell and grit; sand and Kilpatrick's pigeon minerals are always
available. They are delicate feeders, picking up seeds from the aviary
floor and from a bowl without lateral movement of the bill, noted in
some species of Columbidae, which leads to seed scattering.
Breeding
A possible true pair was selected from the six birds, after a period of
isolation and re-introduction. The selected pair was released into an

outside planted aviary in April 1977. This aviary measured 3.25 x 1.5 x
2.25 m high, and had an earth floor; clumps of gorse were hung up at
various heights to provide nesting sites. The doves shared the aviary
with one pair of Crimson-winged Pytilias Pytilia phoenicoptera and one
pair of Golden-breasted Waxbills Estrilda subflava.
The cock dove (red rings) began to give advertising calls early in
May. On the nth May he was sitting in a gorse clump nest-calling;
later the hen (orange rings) joined him and both birds sat side by side in
the nest site. The following day the nest was commenced, the cock taking
material to the site and the hen sitting in the site arranging the material.
An egg was laid on the 14th May and a second on the 15th: it would
appear possible that incubation commenced with the first egg. The eggs
from this clutch were found on the floor of the aviary on the 25th May
and embryonic development appeared normal. During the following
months four more clutches were laid and incubated and these were either
deserted or found broken.
The first egg of the sixth clutch was laid on the 19th October and the
second on the 20th, incubation apparently commencing with the first
egg. Two chicks hatched on the 2nd November and left the nest on the
19th November. One of the chicks was larger than its sibling and more
active, flying up to perch with the parents. The smaller chick could not
fly on leaving the nest, but was perched near the aviary roof on the 20th
November. The larger chick was seen to feed itself on the 23rd November
and the smaller on the 25th. Parents and chicks were removed from the
aviary and placed in a heated bird room on the 27th November.
Nest
All the nests were made in gorse clumps, the height varying from 1.25
to 2 m. After nest-calling by the cock, both birds would sit side by side,
then when the cock began to carry material to the nest, the hen would
turn completely round, pressing down the gorse. The scanty material I
used consisted of a few bits of dried grass, stems, and on one occasion
three fine twigs. Although I always supply what I consider lots of suitable
twigs for nesting doves of any species, it would appear the doves do not
find them so.
Eggs
All six clutches laid consisted of two eggs, the seven examined were
ellipticals, varying from cream to light buff. The mean size of four eggs
measured was 24.85 x 17.1 mm.
Incubation
The usual pattern for incubation common to the majority of Columbidae
species was evident, the hen sitting at night and the cock sitting from
approximately 0900 hrs. until the afternoon. As the only full incubation

took place from late October until early November., in a period of decreas-
ing daylight and colder weather, it was noticeable that the changeovers
took place without the hen leaving the site. The cock would sit alongside
the hen for some time before the changeover, then would immediately
cover the eggs when the hen had left the nest. At no time were the eggs
seen to be uncovered. As far as could be ascertained, in all six clutches
the first egg was covered, the cock sitting during the day, but it appeared
his share of covering or incubation was less than the usual pattern from
the laying of the second egg onwards. It cannot be said with any certainty
that true incubation commences with the first egg.
Chicks
When the chicks left the nest on the 19th November, the larger and
more active chick roosted on a perch between the parents. The smaller
and less active chick joined its sibling at the roost the following evening.
During the morning of the 19th both the parents were continually flying
down to the small chick on the aviary floor and standing near it. On one
occasion the cock was seen to stand near the chick and give advertising
coos.
Voice
Goodwin (1970) states that the advertising and nest-calls for T.
chalcospilos are essentially the same, or at least no observer has stated
otherwise. It would also appear that there is little difference, if any,
between the calls of T. chalcospilos , afer and abyssinica. The calls given by
my doves, either as advertising or nest-calls, I would attempt to describe
as follows, coo-oo, coo-oo, coo-oo, coocucoo, coocucoo, coo-coo-coo-
coo-coo-coo. The first three notes deliberate and clear, the middle notes
running together, the last six notes decreasing in volume and dying away.
They often make a 'false start 5 , coo-oo, coo, then silence. All six birds
including the proven hen gave advertising calls; it was noticeable that the
hen would often cut off the last six notes, as would one other bird of
unknown sex. Roberts (1961) records that the call of T. chalcospilos is one
of the most characteristic and monotonous sounds of the bush. The call
is likened by various native tribes to "My mother is dead! My father is
dead! All my relations are dead! Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh."
General behaviour and displays
Although the genus has a reputation for sluggish behaviour in aviaries,
I have found my abyssinica to be active. This may be due to the stimulus
provided by the auditory and visual contact with conspecifics. They seem
to prefer to feed off the ground, and when flying up to perch, raise the
tail on alighting.
When nest-calling the cock would lower the head and flick both wings,
raising the tail in unison with the wing movements. The hen would then

approach the site, sit next to the cock and allo-preening and billing would
occur, the billing consists of the pair briefly touching bills. I have not
seen the bill of the hen enter the cock's bill. Copulation which took place
on the ground and when perched in gorse clumps, was preceded by allo-
preening and billing. During my attempts to select a true pair, by intro-
ducing a new partner to a bird kept in isolation, defensive threat was
displayed by raising one wing, sometimes buffeting the partner with the
wing. Usually the isolate was the actor.
Sun-bathing
T. abyssinica are very fond of sun-bathing, lying on the aviary floor and
exposing one side, then raising a wing and exposing the underside of the
wing. Rain-bathing and water-bathing have not been observed.

SUMMARY
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.99924625" page_id="56386700"  page_num="68" year="" vol="">
The breeding of captive T. abyssinica is described, with some obser-
vations on their behaviour. As noted with other species of captive
Columbidae, successful reproduction can occur in a period of declining
photo-period and ambient temperature without artificial light or heat.
As described, the Black-billed Wood Dove Turtur abyssinica has been
bred by Mr. J. Trollope and this is believed to be the first success in this
country, but anyone knowing of any previous breeding should please
inform the Hon. Secretary.

BREEDING THE TACAZZE SUNBIRD AT
PADSTOW BIRD GARDENS
By David Coles (Curator)
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.996793725" page_id="56386701"  page_num="69" year="" vol="">
A native of eastern Africa, the Tacazze Sunbird Nectarinia tacazze at
17 cm is amongst the largest of the sunbirds. There is a marked dimor-
phism between the sexes with the slightly larger male mainly iridescent
purple and bronze with black wings, tail and lower back. In contrast, the
female is two-tone grey with upperparts the darker. Our pair arrived in
1972 as part of a consignment from Kenya to stock the then recently
completed Tropical House (Martin 1973). Both appeared to be adults
and it was not long before they became settled enough for the male to
start asserting some authority over the other smaller birds necessitating
the removal of several.
The pre-August 1976 nesting activities are described fully by Martin
(1976). One further attempt during the latter half of that year proved
unsuccessful with the chick only surviving 24 hours before disappearing.
From the brief observations made, it became apparent the female was
greatly distressed by the male's presence as she tended the chick, at
times taking nearly ten minutes to collect enough insects to feed it. The
impression was given that even with an abundance of insects, the male
would have to be removed if there was to be a chance of rearing a chick.
As all previous nest-building and feeding of chick had been carried out
by the female alone, it was decided to separate him as soon as possible
after incubation had commenced.
Both birds began to moult early in October and peace reigned for nearly
two months as the cock ceased to worry both the hen and other small
birds. No eclipse plumage has been attained by our male while in captivity.
On completion of moult early in December, the male started displaying
regularly to his mate who appeared to take several weeks longer to reach
peak condition. Much activity took place during the next few weeks
before a start was finally made on nth January to the first nest of the
year. Progress was slow, but by the 20th the entrance hole was clearly
definable in a mass of dried grass suspended from morning glory Ipomoea
learii stems two metres above a pool. The weather then became dull for
the next few days and interest waned before building was finally
abandoned around the 27th.
Three days later a new nest was started in the same locality with
material from the first incomplete structure being used. Progress was again
slow, but by 24th February it was nearing completion. Unfortunately,
by next morning a gaping hole had appeared where part of the roof had
come away from its supports. Attempts at patching proved hopeless and
the nest was removed on 3rd March and broken up. Lining had not yet
commenced. Five weeks of overcast weather then followed which delayed

the start of the next nest until 14th April. Again it was suspended from
Ipomoea stems, but this time at the rear of the house. Progress was rapid
and within two days only slight gaps were visible in the outside structure,
most of which had been plugged with lambs' wool by mid-afternoon next
day. Mating was first observed on 19th, appearing more like rape; both
birds were on the ground with the female screeching loudly and struggling
to get free. Several seconds elapsed before they both flew to a nearby
perch. A brief mutual display then followed.
Feathers were taken as lining on 23rd and 24th and copulation was
again observed mid-morning on the 24th. The next few days were quiet
but there appeared to be some urgency in her visits on the 27th, even
visiting while I cleaned beneath. Another frustrating spell of overcast
weather caused a lull until 10th May when the female occupied the nest
for periods of 10 to 15 minutes throughout the day. Towards evening
the male began keeping her away from the feeding tubes, but she managed
to avoid him long enough to have a good feed before returning to the
nest to roost. Unfortunately, she had to be removed the following morning,
having developed a badly swollen eye overnight, out of which she appeared
unable to see. To make matters w T orse, the male began to pursue her relent-
lessly and she looked a sorry sight when removed. She was allowed to settle
during the day before the eye was bathed and Brolene eye ointment
applied that evening. An inspection of the nest revealed one egg, pre-
sumably laid the previous night. It measured 20 x 14 111m and had a
buff ground colour heavily marked with brown. As no suitable foster
was available, the egg was artificially incubated for 16 days before the
chick died, half-emerged from the shell. The injured eye was bathed
and ointment applied morning and evening for the next two weeks by
which time there had been a marked improvement with only a bare
patch remaining around the eye. Rather than put her back to the male,
it was decided to remove him, thus giving her time to settle without his
attentions. The task of removing him proved simpler than anticipated
and was achieved by placing a feeding tube near one of the connecting
holes leading to a small flight cage in the hospital where he could clearly
see the female as he fed. Within five minutes he had been captured and
the female returned to the Tropical House where she bathed frequently
that evening and during the following day. Reunion was uneventful and
both settled quickly.
Between 8th and 17th June, repeated attempts at a nest in a silken oak
Grevillia robusta were made. Because of its proximity to the public viewing
area, each nest was removed. These were the only occasions when nest-
building was attempted away from water. Location was then switched to
the rear of the flight and, as previously, a nest was suspended from
morning glory stems about 2.5 metres above the pond. Progress was
reasonable and by 3rd July, feathers were being taken in for lining.
Mating observed on the 7th. As previously, there was little activity in the

pre-laying period as she rested. She appeared "heavy" while feeding
late evening on the 8th and next morning the male started to drive her
towards nest, only easing up when she approached v/ithin a metre. First
observed on the nest at 11 o'clock where she remained until 12.30. After
half-an-hour's feeding and preening she returned to the nest and was not
seen off for the rest of the day. The male spent most of the afternoon in
deep cover five metres away. Laying occurred that evening.
Next day, the female was pursued aggressively each time she came out
to feed, so he was removed by using a spring trap. Immediately she
became more settled and spent time preening and catching fruit flies.
Plumage care appeared important during incubation and the day usually
ended with a bath and five minutes of preening. Most times while I was
cleaning the flight she remained on the nest, but should she leave, she
spent the time feeding and preening and soon let it be known if she wanted
to return. Once back, she never left a second time. Food consumption
decreased to half the normal intake. Two days prior to hatching, she
became more excitable when off the nest and called almost continuously.
Once, to the surprise of a male Emerald Dove, she landed on his back,
staying only momentarily before a half-hearted shake caused her to move.
Moths liberated for her were caught with great excitement and, after
beating to remove wings they were eaten. The occasional feather was
still taken to the nest, usually on returning to brood, and once a moth-
wing which she placed at the side of the entrance.
The egg hatched on the 25th after 16 days incubation, with remains of
the shell being found at the farthest possible point away. Moths caught
overnight in a light trap comprised the first few feeds and were fed by
regurgitation after removing wings. A single feed consisted of two or
three moths and she usually returned to brood afterwards. After reading
available literature on captive-reared sunbirds, it was decided to offer as
varied a diet as possible. B. E. Reed (1965) fed spiders in rearing the
Scarlet-chested Chalcomitra senegalensis and cuckoo-spit insects (frog-
hopper larvae) were fed by the Scamells (1964) in rearing the Malachite
Nectarinia famosa. Limited personal observations on breeding Black
Sunbirds Nectarinia sericeus in Papua New Guinea showed that a wide
variety of insects are fed, some fairly large. The collection of live food,
although time consuming, was not difficult. The method adopted was to
use a fine net and "sweep" in long grass with the contents being placed
in a jar for later release. The variety and numbers caught were astonishing,
with grasshoppers, crickets, caterpillars, beetles, moths and ladybird
larvae the most plentiful. Of course, not all were acceptable, but enough
were found to keep the chick healthy. A raised tray near the nest was
used as a feeding point with an overhanging bush providing cover for
insects which escaped. This she soon learnt and searched them out between
feeds.
She seemed to be coping adequately on her own and once the fourth day

had passed, (the previous longest a chick had survived), there was a
feeling of confidence about rearing it. Unfortunately, expectations came
to an abrupt end the next day when the nest collapsed and chick vanished.
The poor female flew around frantically for half an hour before settling
a little and she remained uneasy for the rest of the day.
The male was re-introduced on 31st July and two days later a new nest
was started overhanging the centre of a pond. Progress was rapid and
within two days it was being lined with feathers and cotton-wool. The
male then became very aggressive towards the other birds resulting in
the removal of a Green Broadbill for its own safety. No mating was
observed, but on 10th August, after several days of pre-laying inactivity,
the female spent most of the morning inside the nest with longish periods
out in the afternoon, returning late evening to roost; and presumably
she laid overnight. The male was again removed and the same behavioural
patterns were adopted as previously by the female. Towards the end of
incubation, the weather became more changeable, causing her to regulate
her brooding patterns by spending longer on the eggs when dull and less
when sunny.
Egg hatched on the 26th. Moths again comprised the first few feeds,
$ but as "sweeps" in long grass now proved fruitless, a new source had to
be found. Nettle beds in a nearby field partially filled the gap, but as
they did not restock between sweeps, other areas had to be found. Ivy
and wild clematis proved good hunting grounds and the three were
alternated. Spiders formed the bulk, but crickets, caterpillars and grass-
hoppers were also netted. During the initial three days, each feed consisted
of two or three regurgitated spiders or moths with an estimated 30 feeds
per day. From four days old the amount increased to between four and
six per feed. At five days old, food was accepted direct from female's
beak which she gave when clinging to the side of the nest. Not once
was she seen to feed by hovering in front of the nest, even in the latter
stage when it would have made feeding much simpler.
On 1st September the weather turned foul with heavy rains all day
making spiders difficult to obtain. The situation improved little during
the following morning but thankfully, it broke mid-afternoon and spiders
were again easy to collect in the brighter conditions. On the 4th, with
the chick at nine days old, a grasshopper was accepted by the female for
the first time and was duly killed and fed to the chick. From then on
live food problems were over, as enough grasshoppers could be captured
in 20 minutes, come rain or shine, for a day's feeding. Initially, both
male and female grasshoppers were taken, but at 12 days old, food intake
increased rapidly and only the larger females were accepted. Approxi-
mately 70 were now being fed per day with eight to twelve given at first
and last feeds while four to six were fed at regular intervals throughout
the day.
At 13 days old, no time was spent by female in the nest during the day

but she returned late evening to roost. Next morning, she tried, con-
tinuously for half an hour to coax the chick out of the nest by flying back
and forth, calling frequently. Having not heard or seen it being fed, I
began to worry for the chick's safety, but a quick check revealed it to be
healthy and it was duly fed. The same coaxing tactics were employed over
the next few days and at 18 days old, it finally left the nest at mid-day.
The chick proved quite active from the start, moving about confidently
in the thick foliage at the rear of the flight. That evening, she coaxed it
back to the nest by flying over with a grasshopper; it followed and after
a scramble was inside. It continued to roost in the nest until 24 days old
and began feeding on nectar at 23 days old. At this stage, the afternoon
feed was changed from honey-water to a Complan and honey solution,
making the twice daily feeds identical. Grasshoppers were still accepted
but had dropped to only three or four a day. A week later the chick was
completely independent.
The chick's overall size was about two-thirds that of female with fluffed
feathers on the sides of the body giving it a plumpish appearance. Uniform
grey in colour with a greenish tinge on the nape. Throat black. Eye stripes,
broad above and narrow below, yellowish. Tail about 2 cm long, sooty
black with outer feathers edged white. Legs black; beak dark, slightly
curved and about three-quarter length. Sexing was possible at an early
age with the two central tail feathers starting to protrude at two months.
Plumage darkened slightly, especially on throat and scapulars and later
showed tinges of purple. There also appears to be slight difference in
both voice and flight. The adult male has a more flitting type of flight
which became apparent in the juvenile at about six weeks. Vocalisation
appears almost identical in the sexes save for a continuous twittering
uttered occasionally by the male; heard at eight weeks in the youngster.
Towards the end of November, slight aggression occurred between the
two with the young male getting the better of the exchange. He was
removed on 2nd December and the adult male re-introduced shortly
afterwards. It is now early March with the adults in the process of building
a new nest. The female started the lining on the 8th and is still busy
collecting feathers, so we remain hopeful of repeating the success.

By L. Gibson (Burnaby, B.C., Canada)
The Skylark Alauda arvensis has been bred relatively few times in
captivity, but the pair that I had nested readily and that may have been
the experience of others, but successful rearing of the young has certainly
been infrequent. In spite of keeping detailed notes since May 1974,
especially of the successful nestings, I had unexplained failures under
conditions apparently identical to those where young were raised. I spent
a good deal of time during summer taking notes, but because of the
secretive habits of the birds, I still have many gaps to fill.
The aviary measures 12 x 3J x 7 feet high and the floor is mostly of grass
with one bush. The roof is partly covered, four feet of it, the remainder
being, of course, of wire-netting. The summer of 1974 was mostly wet with
the lowest night temperature of 42*F (5.6*C.) while there were chicks in the
nest, but early in May when the larks were heard quietly trilling, the
weather was hot. A nest was made in a slightly heaped mound of earth
under a tuft of grass close by the side of the aviary. A few pieces of grass
were used, but the nest was essentially just a depression in the earth.
Other nests were made at the same time and later four more were used
for egg-laying. All were of the same general construction, three being
among grass roots and two in open patches of bare earth: no nest was
used more than once.
The first clutch was laid on the 5th, 6th and 7th of May. The eggs
look very like brown pebbles and are difficult to see against the earth.
The weather became wet and remained so for weeks. A pair of Chinese
Spectacled Thrushes which had shared the aviary were removed because
they were thought to have damaged a fourth egg which was found later.
Two of the first three eggs were put under a Canary and they hatched,
but the chicks lived only two or three days. The larks abandoned the
remaining egg and another clutch of four was laid, commencing only
eight days after the last of the first clutch was laid. These and all subse-
quent eggs hatched after an average of 11 days incubation with a variation
of 10-J to 11J days. In 1974 five clutches totalling 18 eggs were laid
(4, 4, 4, 3 and 3) and of these ten hatched, eight of them under the larks, 1
and four young were reared. Three of the earlier eggs were infertile and
so were the last of the season laid on the 21st, 22nd and 23rd of August.
Four young from 18 eggs looks to be a poor result, but four from the
eight chicks hatched by the parents is perhaps not too disappointing.
The chicks always left the nest on the tenth day from hatching: their
eyes opened fully on the fifth or sixth day and they were brooded by the
mother for the first six days. Both parents then slept on a patch of bare
earth. The father shared the early incubation and both parents fed the

chicks. Because the larks were getting so wet in the grass, the aviary was
covered with plastic sheeting and most of the grass was turned over to
leave the bare earth. The chicks remained hidden in separate hollows
for another ten days, but it is not known if they fed themselves during
this period: at 12 days old they were seen to flap around clumsily and to
change hiding places, sometimes using the extra nests and at others
they just burrowed deep into the grass. At 15 days the chicks were fre-
quently running about and following the parents to the food dish, but
it was not ascertained if they ate from it by themselves. At 20 days they
were eating bread, egg and dog biscuit (kibble) and they were then
removed, for the parents were again incubating eggs.
When hatched, the chicks were covered with thick down, mottled
brown and buff, so they were very difficult to see in the dried grass:
they grew rapidly and were very fat up to a month old. The parents
always gave a high-pitched trill when approaching with food and this
made the chicks sit up and beg, but otherwise they remained crouched
in their hollows.
The remarkable egg production I attribute largely to the staple diet of
moist dog biscuit and soft bread. The adults were fond of the latter, but
it was not ascertained whether they fed any of it to their chicks, though
the young birds were seen to eat it at three weeks of age. The parents
fed the young mostly on "leather jackets" (crane fly larvae) supplemented
with mealworms when the former were in short supply. Garden worms
were not eaten and no insect food was available to the larks because of
the concurrent demands of Pekin Robins. The leather jackets and meal-
worms were smeared with soft margarine as a source of vitamin D for
at least one meal each day. This was vitamin D2 (of vegetable origin).
Birds can only utilise this at about i/ioth the rate of vitamin D3 (of
animal origin). This work was done on chickens, so may not apply to
all birds. However, my birds evidently got enough vitamin D2 through the
amount of margarine they received either on bread or on the live larvae.
Scrambled egg was regularly given in subsequent years, but only inter-
mittently in the first season. Spiders were given to the young whenever
the parents found them in the aviary. The chicks in the second brood
were hand-fed on a few occasions during the first three weeks with "dog
kibble omelette" and this was the most successful nest, three young out
of four being reared, but most of the others died or were missing from
between the second and fourth days. Some were found with their brains
pecked out, but it was not known if this happened after death. At first
the father was suspected, but taking him away from one brood did not
help, as all the young died by the fifth day and a subsequent clutch of
eggs was infertile but for one. This seems to show that each egg is fertilised
separately.
The young were disappointingly wild, but the sole survivor of the
third brood was reared in a cage from the age of three weeks. This bird

is not tame, but it is less apt to "rise" than the others. It was kept in an
indoor flight and in November at the age of six months it began to sing
beautifully. All four young so far reared were males and it was noticed
that the singing was done while the birds were walking as well as when
standing. All were put into a greenhouse and they sang until the cold
mid-winter weather came when they stopped, but recommenced in an
outdoor flight in February. The mother was much less inclined to rise
than the father and she would continue to sit on eggs until almost stepped
on. This is probably a sexual rather than an individual trait. The father
was about a third as large as the mother and in any case the birds were
easily sexed by the hind claw, this being noticeably longer in the male.
Skylarks are sand-bathers and only once was one seen to bathe in water.
The birds were sold and were put into a large outdoor aviary, roofed
over and measuring 6 x 3 x 2m high. They continued to nest and in 1976
produced the first surviving hens (two out of three hatched); two cocks
were also raised that year from a later clutch and again crane fly larvae
were instrumental in the successful rearings, most of the larvae being
supplied by me to the apathetic owner. One young cock died in the
winter, but the old pair, two young hens and a cock lived together in this
aviary.
The old hen nested early in 1977, hatching three young from three eggs
on the 5th May. No provision was made for the chicks which died by
the fourth day. The old cock died soon after and the remaining birds
were sold. A total of 11 chicks had been reared in the preceding three
years. The old hen and a young one went to someone who had one of
the 1974 cocks, a semi-tame bird that was kept in a cage 1.2 x 0.6 x 1.8m
high and after much initial quarrelling in which the cock was the aggres-
sor, the three birds settled down and both hens then laid eggs, a total of
eight being found. There was no attempt at incubation as there was still
some bickering going on. No notes were taken, but it was thought that
the young hen laid two of the eggs. All the eggs were damaged and the
owner thought that the birds were doing this, though latterly mice were
suspected and possibly they were the reason for the non-incubation. These
indoor layings in a cage of small floor area are all the more remarkable
in that the cage was situated in a living room. This is where the young
cock had been kept since he was six months old and he was tame enough
to accept mealworms from the fingers. He often roosted in the branches
of a small dead fir tree, though tufts of grass and trays of soil were supplied.
The owner of the birds hopes to build an outdoor aviary for the larks
this spring; however, it is a pity that no serious attempt was made to
raise some young indoors.
One final point that I have never seen mentioned--when hand-feeding the
larks, it was noticed that they had a forked tongue rather than a notched
one. They have proved peaceable and easy to cater for if housed in an
earth-floored aviary. Most people have not seen a Skylark at close quarters:

they are prettily marked in shades of buff and darker brown and, surpris-
ingly to me, they have proved to be among the most consistent singers
in my collection, providing an attractive song for ten months of the year
and being silent only in December and January. The song is not nearly
as loud as the flight song. Sadly enough, in spite of these attributes, the
Skylarks have not raised a spark of interest among Canadian aviculturists.
Does no one have time to listen to bird song nowadays? The keeping
and breeding of these larks were the subject of an article by me which
appeared in the Canadian avicultural journal in 1975, but, of course,
this present paper is considerably revised in the light of the further
experience.

Pycnonotus sinensis sinensis
By R. E. Oxley (Hornchurch, Essex)
In the July~September 1976 edition of the Magazine I wrote an
account of the successful nesting by a pair of Chinese Bulbuls in my
aviaries the previous summer (1975).
The adult hen unfortunately died during the winter of 1975/76. I was
anxious to obtain another mate for the cock bird which had already
proved to be a reliable parent, but as the new quarantine regulations had
just been introduced (March 1976) I doubted whether any would become
available. By sheer good fortune I managed to obtain what later proved
to be a hen when I visited a dealer's in London's Club Row on nth April
that year. The two birds were immediately introduced to each other and
were placed in the same aviary which had been used the previous year.
On 24th May the hen was observed sitting in an old Song Thrush's nest
which had been fixed in position among the Russian vine ( Polygonum )
at one end of the aviary, approximately one metre from the ground.
Subsequently upon looking in the nest, with the aid of a mirror, I saw
that the hen was incubating three eggs which were off-white, being
heavily blotched and streaked with mauve. On 1st June both adults were
seen to be taking live food to the nest, but two days later on the 3rd June
a young bird was found dead on the ground under the nest and the nest
was empty. By 29th June the hen was again incubating another clutch
of three eggs in the same Song Thrush's nest, but these were removed
on 19th July after the hen had stopped incubating. These eggs were
infertile and measured 23/24 mm x 17 mm. This was the final nesting
attempt that season.

R. E. OXLEY--BREEDING THE CHINESE BULBUL
The bulbuls remained in the aviary throughout the winter 1976/77
and with the advent of some settled weather during March 1977, they
commenced to build a cup nest in the same nest box which had been
used by the original hen two years previously. It had been my intention
to remove this box the previous autumn, but it had been overlooked. The
nest, made exclusively from dried grass, was completed on 24th March
and on the 28th the first egg was laid. On the 30th of the month the hen
commenced incubating the completed clutch of three eggs and the young
hatched on the nth April. The young, as was the case previously, were
fed entirely on live food; soft (white) mealworms and blow-flies for the
first few days and later ordinary mealworms and maggots. On 14th
April one baby bulbul could be seen gaping for food and the following
day all three babies could be seen. One of them was picked up dead from
the aviary floor on the morning of 18th April but the other two grew
rapidly and on the morning of 22nd were sitting on the rim of the nest
and by the afternoon they had flown.
Two days later (24th) the hen commenced building a second nest
alongside the previous one in the same box. The following day the parents
were seen feeding some chopped grapes to the two babies which were
developing nicely. The first egg of the second clutch was laid in the new
nest on the 27th April. At 5.45 a.m. the following morning, upon inspecting
the aviaries before leaving for work, the hen was seen lying on the floor
in a distressed condition. However, not having sufficient time to set up a
hospital cage I decided to leave the hen alone and let nature take its
course. I managed to return home at 10 a.m. by which time the hen had
passed an egg and she seemed to be back to her normal self again. This
egg was placed in the nest with the egg laid the previous day and the
following morning a third egg was laid and incubation once again com-
menced. A week later the two young from the first clutch were observed
picking up and eating foods which had fallen on the floor and they also
bathed in the water receptacles provided. On 12th May one of the eggs
from this second clutch hatched, but the young bird was thrown from
the nest five days later and the hen abandoned the nest which still con-
tained the remaining eggs and which were infertile. A third egg (also
removed) which I found---not in the nest--but between the two nests
on the floor of the nest box. The weather had been extremely cold and
damp for a few days previously and this may have had some bearing on
the chick being ejected from the nest.
A third clutch was commenced on 23rd May, again in the same nest,
so I removed the two young from the first nest and placed them in !
another aviary. Further eggs were laid on the 24th and 25th May when
incubation commenced; one hatched on 5th June. An egg, presumably
ejected from the nest, was found on the aviary floor on the 14th June,
and the following morning a young bird was sitting on the rim of the
nest. By evening this baby was roosting in the low branches of a shrub.

This bird was reared to independence. The parents, although having
already had three nests, decided to start yet again and a fourth clutch was
started on 21st June--again in the same nest--and on the 23rd incubation
commenced. Hatching occurred on 3rd July and the eldest youngster--
there were three this time--was perching on the edge of the nest on the
morning of 14th July and by the evening all three had flown. The young
bird from, nest three was now being bullied by its parents, so it was
removed for its own safety. As with all those from the previous nests,
the youngsters grew apace and on 14th August, when completely inde-
pendent, were removed from their parents. All the youngsters were ringed
with various coloured split rings for ease of identification and they had
by the end of September all moulted into adult plumage.
Unlike one of the bulbuls reared in 1975 which suffered badly from
rickets, all those bred in 1977 suffered no such deformities. Two of the
youngsters have been exchanged with others bred by B. and A. Peck of
Cheltenham and it is hoped that we will both be able to breed some
second generation aviary bred young in 1978.

In February 1973 a pair of Trumpeter Desert Finches, or Trumpeter
Bullfinches Rhodopechys githaginea , were received from R. Restall who
had obtained them from an aviculturist in the Canary Islands. The only
accommodation of any size available was an unheated garden aviary, and
in view of the time of year, it seemed preferable to keep them in a warmer
place. A cage was hastily constructed for them from available material. It
was of two boxes end to end, and was about six feet long, a foot high and
two and a half feet wide. Long glass panels were set into front and back
of each box, occupying most of the length and depth. The top was
covered partly with plastic netting and partly with translucent plastic
sheeting. The shape was selected on the assumption that the birds would
be terrestrial rather than arboreal. The cage was set on a ledge about
three and a half feet up in a large bay window. The activities of the birds
could be seen from within the room, and although the birds were not
visible from outside when on the cage floor, they could see and be seen
when they perched on a raised site.
It was originally intended that the birds should be kept in the cage only
until the weather became warmer, but before that occurred they had
settled in and begun to show breeding behaviour, so it seemed preferable
to allow them to remain where they were. The cage offered good
opportunities for observation and the room was maintained at a reasonable
temperature in cold weather, although liable to become very warm in
summer.
The staple diet of the birds was a seed mixture, sold as "aviary finch
mixture" from which they selected the seed they wanted. They were also
offered mixed millets and maw seed, but showed little or no interest in
these. They were given various green plants and grasses; also tufts of
grass complete with roots and attached earth. They had grit, sand,
minerals and crushed eggshell; multivitamin drops were added to the
water.

In this species, as in the genera Acanthis , Loxia and Pinicola , the red
colour of the male is affected by captive conditions and largely disappears.
In some of the latter genera, loss of red results in a replacement by a
bronzy-yellow tint on the affected areas of plumage, but there was no
apparent modification of this type in the present species, red colour being
lost entirely, or indicated by a faint pink tint.

The bill of the male is a bright orange-red, but the plumage is mainly
dull grey, a little browner on mantle and wings, silvery grey with a faint
pink tint on the throat and very pale pink on the belly. The flight feathers
of wings and tail are blackish on the inner webs, and the outer portions
are grey with some pink along the edges; while the rump and outer edges
of the basal portions of the tail feathers are light pink. The legs and feet
are a light orange. The female is more sparrow-like, a warm buffish-brown
with a slight hint of rufous on wing and tail feather edges. The bill is pale
buff with a faint pinkish tint and the legs orange-buff.
The head appears rather large and round, wide to accommodate the
bill, and with the eyes set high and appearing rather small, those of the
male being ringed with a narrow rim of pale feathers. The stout bill is not
set into the skull as in the true bullfinches, Pyrrhula spp., but is squat and
prominent, with rounded culmen and blunt tip. The bill commences a
little below the brow and is more short and thick but otherwise more
reminiscent of that of a Greenfinch Carduelis chloris than that of a bull-
finch.
When the bird is alert the posture is upright, the body slim and the legs
appearing long. When active it moves briskly with rapid springy hops,
covering the ground easily; but when it is moving more slowly on the
cage floor it is possible to hear that one foot falls slightly before the other;
and on occasions when the bird moved among a tangle of grasses where
rapid progress was obstructed it was observed walking with alternate
steps.
Under natural conditions the birds usually inhabit bare rocky areas.
The wide, low cage was arranged with this in mind. Within this they were
given twig perches at either extremity and several large irregular flint
stones, about six inches high were scattered elsewhere. The perches were
used when the birds were alarmed or very restless; but normally they
tended to stay on the ground or perch on the stones, and to fly between
the stones. When roosting and when resting between bouts of activity,
they would do so on sheltered parts of the cage floor, and usually mounted
the stones when in an active, self-assertive mood.
They were receiving less sunlight than they would do in the wild, and
when it shone into the cage, particularly during the morning, they would
often sunbathe, tilted over on one side, with body and head laterally
aligned to the sun and feathers ruffled or erected. However, towards
midday they showed a marked tendency to seek, and rest within, a shaded
part of the cage if the sun was shining; and at times when a drooping edge
of the newspaper used to cover the cage floor provided an overhanging
ledge, they might squat under this.
Comfort movements, such as the stretching of the wing over an
extended leg, or raising of the wings above the body with a forward
stretch of the head, occurred not on the perch as in more typical finch
behaviour, but on level ground or on a very slight eminence.

C. J. O. HARRISON--THE TRUMPETER BULLFINCH
For most of the breeding season and winter the birds showed very
little inclination to bathe; but at about the period of the moult, in late
summer, the male and young bird both bathed in water and in dry sand,
using typical bathing movements, but later this behaviour waned again.
The large bill, broad as well as deep, appears to indicate adaptation for
specialised feeding methods. When offered a mixture of seeds, the birds
appeared to prefer the smaller, oilier seeds and showed no preference for
larger ones, nor evidence of any special ability to crack large seeds. They
showed no interest in live insects nor in artificial foods of the type given
to insectivorous birds. Green, growing plants of various types were taken,
but no preference was shown for buds or berries, such as might occur in
the Bullfinch Pyrrhula pyrrhula.
The most significant indication of the probable use of the bill under
wild conditions occurred when they were offered tufts of grass pulled
from the ground. They showed a preference for the finer, narrow-leaved
grasses. Blades and stems tended to be severed near the base and then
chewed in the bill, being steadily reduced to tiny fragments. The material
was held in the bill near the tip and a loud clicking could be heard when
the birds were feeding in this fashion. It was noticed that they did not
seem particularly interested in the seeding heads of the grasses, although
they would take seed from them, and when offered succulent plants such I
as chickweed they appeared as interested in them when they became dry
and somewhat withered as when they were fresh. From these observations
it seems possible that the bill is used to reduce to tiny, edible fragments
the more basal stem portions of fine, tough grasses and similar plants, and
to be an adaptation to feeding on sparse and desiccated herbage and ;
xerophytic plants which show reduction and modification of structure, i
such as might be expected in arid, semi-desert regions.
When the birds were first received, the bill-tip showed very slight
overgrowth, but when provided with rough-surfaced stones, they
removed these tips within a day by stropping the bill against the stones
on which they perched; and subsequently such bill-stropping was of
regular occurrence.
On the rare occasions when it was necessary to catch a bird, or a bird
appeared to anticipate possible capture, it would attempt to escape by
flight, but no calls were uttered, and it was only later during the period
of recovery from the fright that the excitement call would be heard. On
one occasion the male was scared by window-cleaners and, finding that he
could not escape far enough away, he crouched in the middle of the cage
floor, the body lowered by a splaying apart of the legs until it almost
rested on the ground; then tilted forwards until the breast was almost on
the ground and with the bill lowered so that the tip of it touched the
ground in front. In this position the bird remained motionless for a little
while, and when the moment of supposed danger had passed, it resumed
its activities.

The normal contact call is a single note; an abrupt, emphatic,
moderately-pitched and nasal "enh" or "angh". Some writers have
referred to the call, presumably meaning this note, as a trumpet note, and
I can only suppose that they have in mind the short, insistent note
produced by the cheap toy trumpets that children sometimes have. This
call was uttered at intervals by the birds under observation, but not with
great frequency, and it varied in intensity. Its frequency may, however,
have been reduced by the fact that the limitation on movements imposed
by a cage resulted in the birds being near, and usually in sight of, each
other.
At moments of alarm or excitement a more intense call was uttered,
usually in rapid series of two or three notes. It was louder and more
emphatic than the contact note, higher in pitch and more nasal--"chemp-
chemp-chemp". This call was usually elicited by the sight of large birds
flying past outside the building, or by some unusual activity occurring
nearby, inside or outside the room but in view of the birds. A range of
calls intermediate between the contact and excitement calls occurred at
times, presumably indicating some intermediacy in the degree of arousal.
The species possesses a Straw Display in which the male dances in
front of the female holding leaves or stems in the bill. This is accompanied
by a special call, a loud and abrupt single note, "dwick". It is higher-
pitched than the other calls and is repeated rapidly during the display.
Like the Greenfinch, this species has two types of advertisement song.
The first, a long-drawn bleating note, was heard more often than the
more elaborate phrased song; and was heard from the male for three
months before the other song was heard for the first time. It appears to
correspond to the harsh "breeeze" note of the Greenfinch and has
something of the same quality. It is preceded by several repetitions of a
call note which resembles a less intense and more liquid version of the
straw display note. I note it as "dwelk" or "dwilk". This note appears to
precede each rendering of the bleat and occurs in the intervals between a
series of the latter.
The bleat is a complex, long and low-pitched call, emphatic and loud.
It begins as a low note with a slight squelching tone, which is then drawn
out into a prolonged and harsh nasal "bru-e-e-e-e-a-a-h-h". It often has
a slight rising inflection towards the end, and exceptionally a distinct rise,
or rise and fall, in pitch during the latter part of the call. As the bird
utters it, the bill is opened widely and the head pressed hard back against
the shoulders while the throat ruffles; the whole posture suggesting that
considerable force is needed in order to force out the note.
This call is not uttered from any very prominent perch. The bird may
use it repeatedly when perched on a slight eminence, but does not appear
to mount the vantage point in order to do so; and may use the call with
equal frequency when moving about on the ground, at times pausing

during feeding to do so. The call is uttered with the bill in a horizontal
position. Like the bleat, the full song is preceded by special call notes
which indicate the intention or mood of the bird. Unlike those preceding
the bleat, these calls may be repeated more frequently before the song
actually occurs. These introductory notes are somewhat similar to, but
less nasal than, the ordinary contact note. I noted them as "djah" or
"tchah".
After a series of these notes the bird utters a warbling song which is
partly high-pitched but fairly musical. Its introductory and final phrases
may be variable and unpredictable but the main part of it is a stereotyped
rapid repetition of a short phrase. In the birds studied it consisted of five
notes, the first two higher pitched with rising inflection, followed by two
very short unmusical ones introducing a long, harsh and downward-
slurred note, "dwee, dwee, tch-tch-chaarr". Renderings of this follow
one another in quick succession for three to six repetitions.
When singing, the bird's stance is relatively upright with the bill
raised at a sharp angle. Deliverance of the song results in fairly vigorous
movements of the head. These are of low amplitude and related to the
vigour of utterance. Feathers of the head and neck are usually sleeked
during singing, but body feathers are loose and slightly fluffed.
The above are the typical range of calls. In addition a soft, sibilant
piping note was heard from the female at the nest site, possibly when
soliciting copulation.

The straw display appears to be the typical epigamic display. This
involves carrying plant fragments, grass-blades or stems several inches
long, crosswise in the bill. During the appropriate stage in the breeding
cycle it appeared to be initiated at any time when a feeding male picked
up a piece of plant material in this fashion. Its movements became more
excited and jerky, and it usually gathered four or five fragments that
bristled on either side of the head just like a wide, straggly moustache.
The bird stood very upright, plumage sleeked close to the body, tail
slightly spread and crown feathers fluffed. It moved towards the female
in short hops with an exaggerated jerky strut, and with short, sharp
ducking movements of the head at each hop.
The male faced the female, an inch or two in front of her, drawn up
tall. The plumage was sleeked close to the body, but the lower belly and
flank feathers were fluffed, making the pink belly patch conspicuous in
frontal view. The feathers of the crown were erected in a blunt, ruffled
crest. In this upright position the wing-tips were pointed downwards on
either side, exposing the pink rump and the pink basal area of the partly-
spread tail. In this posture the male performed rapid, lateral hops,
dancing from side to side while facing the female, and uttering loud
"dwick" notes. There was some lateral twist of the tail in the direction of

the hop at each movement.
The male would perform a series of these movements, about 8-10 I
think, but I have not made accurate counts. In all cases in which I
witnessed the display the female was either unresponsive or fluffed the
plumage and threatened with open bill. The display tended to end
abruptly, the male moving away and then relaxing and allowing the plant
material to fall from the bill. On a few occasions the male moved towards
the female, once flying up and hovering over her, in a manner which
suggested that copulation might have followed if the female had been
responsive.
The only other display of apparently epigamic significance was based on
the song. It was seen infrequently and later in the cycle than most of the
straw displays. In this performance the plumage erection in the male was
very different from that in the straw display. The feathers of head and
neck were sleeked, but the body plumage was raised and ruffled. Since the
bird was in a half-crouching posture with wings drooped and tail raised a
little, it appeared as a fluffed ball of feathers. It moved towards the hen
in this posture with rapid and frantic repetitions of song which on a few
occasions degenerated into a frenzied and prolonged buzzing sound. On
the occasions when the display was seen, the female was usually on a low
perch or some eminence, raised a little above the male.

Among the food offered to the birds were stems of seeding grasses, and
the finer of these, together with dry grass blades, were frequently used by
the male in his dancing displays. At the termination of a display the male
would usually hop up onto a stone in the corner of the cage before dropping
the grass and after a series of performances, a pile of material had
accumulated at this spot. The male began to manipulate this material as
though nest-building, and then to carry additional material over to the
pile. This material was carried transversely in the bill, held by the middle,
as in the straw display and on a number of occasions the male suddenly
assumed a jerky, strutting demeanour and turned aside to perform in
front of the female before moving to the corner. He finally formed a
cup-shaped nest on the cage floor, tucked into the corner under a slightly
overhanging cardboard lip. To assist, I offered fine material, cotton,
cotton-wool and feathers. He incorporated a little cotton-wool into the
lining but later threw it out and the final nest was of dry grass, the lining
a little finer than the main structure.
The hen took no part in building and the male tended to drive her
away from the nest. She began squatting in the opposite corner of the
cage, calling with a faint piping note. A day later, at the beginning of May,
she laid an egg in this corner, and the next day another on the floor
nearby. I moved them into the nest. There was an interval of a few days
and then she began to add to the eggs in the nest, laying five more^eggs

and completing the clutch on May nth. The eggs were blue with a few
scattered black specks.
Having completed the clutch, the hen showed no inclination to incubate.
After a week I decided to act. I had a neighbour who bred canaries and
when I approached him he agreed to put the eggs under one of his hens.
I removed them from the nest on May 21st, ten days after the clutch was
complete but with no incubation other than what might have occurred
during the successive layings. Three eggs hatched on June 4th after
I 3 i~ I 4 i days of incubation, but two of the young died during the first
two days after hatching.
The newly hatched young had rather long slender necks and small
heads. There was fairly long but very fine greyish-white down on the
head but not the neck, and on the back, upper wing surfaces, flanks and
thighs. The body skin was pink and the bill and legs were light orange.
The gape flanges were pale yellowish-white and the mouth orange, but
the flanges later deepened to pale yellow and the mouth to crimson with
the orbits showing in the roof of the mouth as dull purple patches. By six
days the bill was yellowish-buff and the legs more buff and less orange.
The single young one left the nest at 14 days old, with a warm orange-
buff plumage, the body feathers still short enough for the bare apteria to
be apparent. The bill was now whitish-buff with a very faint pink tint and
the legs a dull buflish-brown.
Back at the nest the hen had again shown nest-building behaviour on
May 29th to 31st and on June 2nd to 5th laid a second clutch of four eggs.
She again showed no signs of incubation and I removed them on the 8th
to attempt further fostering, but this time none hatched. By June nth she
was at the nest again and on 16th to 19th she laid a third clutch. One egg
was laid on the ground away from the nest. I suspected the male of inter-
fering with the nesting, but had no actual evidence of it. At this point she
abandoned the eggs again and appeared to be showing no further interest,
but I had to leave them unattended at weekends and a few weeks later
returned one Monday to find her suffering from egg-binding. Help was
too late and she died shortly after.

I had been concerned that the young bird might have become psycho-
logically fixed on canaries and as soon as possible I introduced it to the
male. I did this cautiously, separating them by a wire partition at first,
but since they showed no aggression, finally putting them together. The
male tried to ignore his offspring but the latter showed enormous
curiosity about the behaviour of the other, and if the male was feeding,
preening or performing some other relatively uneventful activity, the
young bird would sidle up and peer intently at what was happening. This
usually caused the older bird to stop what it was doing in a manner which,
had it occurred in a human context, would have been interpreted as acute

embarrassment.
The young bird gradually moulted from its rufous juvenile plumage to
that of a male, being fully moulted by late August to early September.
The last rufous feathers to go were those on the sides of the head. The
bird began to spend part of its time perching on a stone and uttering a
long series of odd strangled notes in a haphazard sequence. They re-
sembled no other vocalisations I had heard from this species. Gradually
more recognisable song notes were introduced and during September the
prolonged bleat appeared. The male was still singing at this time.
The male became aggressive towards the young bird and I re-introduced
the partition through which they could still see each other. A certain
amount of threat took place through this. In early October I observed the
young male sing the display song to the older bird and in late October to
early November it began to carry material and perform a side-to-side
dance in front of the other bird. The bill had now become more distinctly
pink.
In the early winter the older male became ill with a wasting disease
which I suspected was avian tuberculosis and within a relatively short
time I had lost both the remaining birds.

The 1977 breeding season got off to an exceptionally slow start--
so much so that it was August 1st before our first youngster left the nest,
the cold spring and sunless summer undoubtedly affecting the breeding
performance of some birds.
Losses of two species of chicks were particularly disappointing, but a
feature of the season was that seven females laid for the first time, including
Black Lory, Fairy Lorikeet, Slender-billed Parrakeet, Cayman and

The lories seemed least affected by the weather. Of the two pairs of
Iris Lorikeets, both of which produced young last season, the old female
did not lay until the second week in September, possibly because of
disturbance by vermin in the vicinity of the aviary. Unfortunately she
deserted the nest on 29th September. The other female laid clutches of
two eggs, the first eggs being laid on about 25th February, 17th April,
7th June, nth September and during December. No chicks hatched or,
if hatching was successful, the chicks died soon after. This was particularly
disappointing since our Iris Lorikeets number two females and five
males, and there is little chance of any more being imported from Timor.
I am very anxious to establish a breeding nucleus of all our small lorikeets,
and this one is undoubtedly my favourite for its beauty and personality.
Dusky Lories, Pseudeos fuscata which reared a single youngster in
1975 and 1976, nested during the middle of April and a chick was heard
on 21st May. By the volume of sound I soon suspected that, for the first
time, two chicks had hatched and this was confirmed when I looked into
the box about three weeks later. The peat inside was in a most insanitary
condition, probably due to lack of evaporation of moisture during the
sunless days of June. About once a week I managed to throw in a handful
of peat but both parents attempted to attack when I touched the nest box
and the male was especially aggressive. When I lifted the lid, the birds
would jump on top of the box, screaming and lifting their wings in
aggression.
During the second week in July I thought I could detect only one
voice and when the nest box was unhooked on 17th July and the parents
warded off with a catching net, the decomposed body of one chick was
found. The other youngster left the nest on 1st August, after approximately
73 days. It exactly resembled the other young birds bred by this pair.
It was about two-thirds the size of the male and within a month was
nearly as large as the female. Diet was as in previous years--mainly
nectar, a small drinker of milk daily, millet sprays and a little pear.
As usual, the two pairs of Meyer's Lorikeets Trichoglossus flavoviridis
meyeri started to nest early in the year. At the end of January two eggs

which had failed to hatch, one being dented, were removed from one
nest. The other pair had two fertile eggs which failed to hatch. Both pairs
laid again--no records were kept. On 3rd July a chick was heard. The
nest was inspected on nth July, when it contained two chicks, judged
to be about seven and nine days old: they were removed for hand-rearing.
The chicks looked healthy and might well have survived; however,
in view of the previous failure of the Meyer's Lorikeets to rear all the
young left with them, we felt it was advisable to remove them. This was
the first time chicks have been hatched during the summer; it would
have been interesting to see whether this would have made any difference
to their survival.
As it happened, the droppings of one of them were very dark green,
possibly indicative of some internal trouble. They changed to the light
brownish colour of those of its nest-mate by the next day. Rearing of
these two chicks followed exactly the same lines as those reared in 1976
(see vol. 83, Jan-March 1977, pp. 12-17). However, whereas before it
had been possible to sex them by the shape of the head at a month old,
we cannot determine with certainty the sex of these youngsters so they
are probably both of the same gender. It is interesting that whereas the
two 1976 youngsters were, at all times, completely compatible, these
two constantly squabble.
They were transferred from the heated brooder cage to a metal cage on
2nd September, when about nine weeks old. They were no trouble to
wean (unlike many hand-reared parrots, but not lorikeets). When nectar
was placed in the brooder on 21st August, they soon drank it and readily
ate banana. They were then spoon-fed only three times daily to make the
transition from rearing food to nectar as gradual as possible. For two
weeks up to 22nd September I fed them once daily--late at night.
We have two pairs of the enchanting little Fairy Lorikeet Charmosyna
pulchella rothschildi , one of which hatched a single youngster in 1975.
Unfortunately, the male of this pair is old and no longer capable of ferti-
lising eggs. These little birds are not hardy enough to risk outdoors
during the winter and we have found the disturbance created by moving
them to summer quarters outdoors restricts breeding activities. Indoors
they will lay throughout the year and are free from disturbances of every
kind, so they are now kept permanently in flights about 5J feet long.
Several clutches of eggs were produced by the hen with the old male.
The second pair laid for the first time and would probably have produced
eggs last year had they been given a nest box. They had a log to which
they often retired but, given a choice, the small lorikeets in our collection
invariably choose a box.
On 10th May there was one egg in the box; on 13th May there were
two. By 8th June one chick had hatched. I judged that this had occurred
two days previously as, at that time, neither bird had left the nest as they
usually do when I enter the birdroom. On the 9th there were two chicks.

The first of these died on the 14th or 15th, and the second on the 16th.
The suggestion after autopsy was that the cause of death was either due to
cold or to the fact that they were unable to synthesise carbohydrates, due
to lack of vitamin B or H. As they were indoors and there were two chicks,
I doubt that they died of cold, even although the weather at the time
was cold.
On 12th July the female Fairy Lorikeet laid again. It is worth noting
that the second egg did not appear until the 18th. A chick was seen when
the nest was examined on 14th August, which could have hatched on
the 12th, judging by the behaviour of the parents. After a couple of days,
they would leave when I entered; thus I could inspect the nest. I kept a
close watch on the single chick and on the evening of the 19th saw that its
crop was hugely swollen with air and contained scarcely any food. I
therefore removed it for hand-feeding.
Although it was at least six and probably eight days old, it was minute;
after all, the Fairy Lorikeet is one of the smallest of parrots and of ex-
tremely slender build. The body length of an adult, excluding the tail,
is about 10 cm. The chick's beak was minute, yet it fed readily
from a spoon immediately and never again was its crop swollen with air.
By the 24th its body was becoming dark with feather tracts and by the
30th grey down was growing beneath the long, wispy white down which
these chicks have on hatching.
When removed from the nest it had weighed only J oz. By 2nd Sep-
tember it weighed the equivalent of five Jp pieces, i.e. oz. Its eyes
were still closed which I found rather worrying; also its feet seemed to
be slightly sprayed.
It died on 5th September---but not from natural causes. I had received
a new batch of a high protein food in powder form which is a normal
ingredient of the rearing food and autopsy revealed that it had compacted
the crop. When I examined the batch after this was discovered, I found
that it had become doughy, instead of retaining its fine powder consis-
tency. Although this was the immediate cause of the chick's death, I
somehow doubt that it would have developed normally.
The breeding pair of Eclectus Parrots were re-united on 22nd January;
it had been necessary to part them as the female was very ill-tempered
towards the male and the two young of the second nest before all three
birds were removed in December, 1976. It is extremely important that !
the male of a breeding pair of Eclectus is removed if the female becomes
aggressive; if this is not done, the stress of the situation may lead to the
male's death.
In 1977 the first three clutches of eggs laid by the female failed to
hatch; the first egg of each clutch was laid on 15th or 16th February,
8th April, 18th May and 26th June. If the eggs do not contain live chicks,
they are usually destroyed on the day the first would have hatched;
however, on one occasion a dented egg rescued after the female had

started to destroy the clutch was found to contain a fully formed chick,
almost ready to hatch. On this occasion she may have miscalculated, as
the second egg was laid five days after the first---an unusually long interval.
On 27th July an Eclectus chick was heard and when the nest was
examined the next day there were two chicks. Once again, both were
males and they left the nest on 15th and 20th October. As the female
showed no aggression towards the male, the pair were left together and
the hen laid the first of two eggs on 27th November. The weather at the
beginning of the incubation period was very cold, the temperature being
around freezing, and on Christmas Day she deserted the nest and the
pair were seen mating.
It is of interest to record that for the first time the female fed the chicks
throughout the rearing period. Normally, the male feeds them from very
soon after hatching; this time the male was seldom allowed in the nest
box and he fed the female, and later the young, at the entrance. As usual,
fresh corn on the cob was the main rearing food. (I should like to thank
our member Michael Beswick for again generously providing me with
unlimited fresh corn during the season which happily coincided with the
rearing period).
The Eclectus were the only true parrots reared. The Bronze-winged
Parrots Pionus chalcopterus which had successfully reared young in the
previous year, nested early and a chick was heard on 30th May. On 10th
July it was evident that something had gone wrong; nest inspection re-
vealed a dead chick and one egg, perhaps indicating that another chick
had hatched and died at an early age, as had happened before; the normal
clutch is three eggs. Autopsy on the chick failed to reveal cause of death.
Unfortunately, these birds are very nervous; the feeding parent is
never seen off the nest and inspection is impossible. Chicks have been
hatched during three consecutive years and only one successfully reared
to independence; this poor record has made us decide not to allow them
to rear their young in future years and hand-rearing will be attempted.
The male and female were separated in December; the female's head
had been completely bare for over a year due to the attentions of the male;
then, in the autumn, she started to denude his nape of feathers. A friend
has also experienced this problem with Bronze-winged Parrots. Pionus
are far from easy birds to breed; they appear to be more nervous than
most American parrots. However, our pair were in a situation where they
were exposed to much disturbance from neighbours' children, so it is
not surprising that results have been poor. The female is already in
residence in an aviary where she will be subjected to less disturbance in
1978.
We were very encouraged by the appearance of eggs from two pairs
of Amazon parrots. In 1975 we went to the Cayman Islands to obtain
six specimens of the very beautiful Cayman Amazon Amazona leuco-
cephala caymanensis , which closely resembles the Cuban Amazon with

its deep pink and white face. One female laid her first egg on about 18th
June and when she deserted the nest on 16th July, three clear and perfectly
formed eggs were found. The second pair were seen to mate and they
spent much time in the nest box, but no eggs were laid. The other two
birds, which are almost certainly males, were not given a nest box. Unlike
most Amazon parrots, these delightful birds did not prove aggressive
while nesting. This was in complete contrast to the behaviour of a pair of
Yellow-shouldered Amazona barbadensis. This species is very attractive,
yet it is seldom recognised, usually being mistaken for the Yellow-fronted
Amazon to which it bears little resemblance. The forehead is white, the
bases of the feathers being a delicate salmon colour; the yellow on the
head is suffused with blue on the cheeks. These characteristics distinguish
barbadensis from all other Amazona parrots.
In this species the feathers of the mantle and the upper breast are
heavily edged with black. The tail, which is often fanned in aggression,
is beautifully marked with red near the base and a broad band of yellow
near the tip: the beak is pinkish-horn colour.
That this species is seldom recognised is very unfortunate because its
habitat is restricted to part of the coast of Venezuela and three islands off
the coast. It is apparently protected. A. barbadensis is never likely to
interest those who are attempting to breed the endangered island Amazons,
for it is not a spectacular bird; however, it may be equally in need of
conservation as the less endangered of the Lesser Antillean forms and it
is regrettable that it has never been bred in captivity. In conversation with
Jean Delacour last year, I was most interested to learn that a recently
acquired pair in his collection at Cleres hatched chicks in 1977, which
unfortunately died when several weeks old.
My husband and I had three Yellow-shouldered Amazons for several
years, but no breeding attempt had been made, despite trying them in
every combination. We were, therefore, delighted to receive a fourth
bird on loan from Mr. and Mrs. C. Wright. An endearing character,
"Icky" becomes wildly excited by the presence of small children, laughing
and shouting at the top of her voice. She also does a perfect imitation of
a new born human baby--and to hear this sound coming from a nest
box is so incongruous as to be hilarious! The bold manner of this bird and
its head shape suggested that Icky was a male and it was placed with the
most feminine looking of the three barbadensis which is a rather quiet
bird with a small head. It was not until Icky disappeared into the nest
box during June that we were sure that we had a true pair but it was
Icky who was the female!
The pair had become so aggressive that it was impossible to enter their
aviary. I believe that the first egg was laid on about June 26th. During
the incubation period we were horrified to see a rat in their aviary one
morning. When it ventured near their nest box they rushed after it,
shouting in excitement and aggressively flaring their tails until it squealed

with fear. It was obviously inadvisable to enter their aviary and my
husband had the difficult and unpleasant task of killing it from the next
enclosure. (As soon as the Yellow-shouldered had finished nesting, the
range of avairies were pulled down and rebuilt vermin-proofed.)
Five weeks after it was thought the eggs were laid, the female deserted
the nest. All signs of aggression in the pair were gone and we were able
to inspect the nest. It contained one fertile egg. Had a chick or chicks
hatched and died early? No young had been heard, but I had fed bread
and milk and extra vegetables from the time the eggs were due to hatch.
Few Amazon parrots rear young at their first attempt, thus we were
encouraged by this pair's eagerness to nest: they had been together only
nine months when the eggs were laid.
We now have six barbadensis , three of which are on breeding loan;
to establish this species in captivity is a cherished hope and every effort
will be made towards that end.
All owners of single specimens of barbadensis must give them the
opportunity to breed. I would welcome the opportunity to compile a
stud book for this species and would appeal to owners to contact me.
In 1977 our pair of Cape or Brown-necked Parrots Poicephalus robustus
nested for the first time. This species, listed as endangered, is the largest
of this genus of African parrots. It is difficult to establish, rare in captivity
and has yet to be bred in Britain. Because of its formidable beak, which
cracks walnuts with ease, the inaccurately named Brown-necked Parrot
has few admirers. The female, which has the forehead and part of the
crown orange, is more colourful but not more beautiful than the male
which has most of the head a delicate pink-suffused pearly grey.
Our pair had been together for less than two years when they nested.
The female laid two clutches, the first egg of each clutch being laid on
about 10th August and 12th September. The nest was inaccessible, but
the dates are accurate because I have never seen a parrot which was more
obviously about to lay. The nesting site was a narrow log which supported
a large nest box. The birds gnawed through the base of the box into the
log. On 4th October the second clutch was deserted and a damaged egg
was found on the floor of the aviary; it was infertile.
The male was one of the most cherished birds in the collection, the
possessor of great charm and intelligence--much like a Grey Parrot in
personality. I would often give him a piece of cheese or a grape as I passed
his aviary, for he would always sit close to the wire--and roost in that
position. This habit led to his untimely death one October night when a
predator, almost certainly a fox, pulled his leg through the 1 x 1 inch
wire mesh and bit it off at the top of the thigh. His death was a horrible
and severe blow, not only because he was a member of a breeding pair of
an endangered species, but even more as an individual of great character.
It is such birds which lend the keeping and breeding of parrots its great
fascination. Not surprisingly, I have been unable to locate another male

and the female resides on her own, moving to an aviary constructed of
i x 1 inch mesh.
During 1977 we were successful in breeding the Black Lory; this will
be the subject of a separate article.
One of the most interesting developments of the season was the laying
of two eggs by our original Slender-billed Parrakeet Enicognathus
leptorhynchus. In June 1976 I had the extraordinary good fortune to
obtain a young bird of this species on loan from London Zoo. It was
placed with my tame Slender-bill "Snatchie", for 15 years almost certainly
the only bird of its kind in Britain. As both had been pets and craved
human attention, it was not surprising that they were incompatible and
often "fenced" with their long bills. They did not seem happy in an
outdoor aviary away from human company, so I housed them in a large
cage indoors with a nest box.
One day in May I noticed that my original bird, a believed male, seemed
slightly unwell, Both birds had been spending much time in the nest
box, although they would have nothing to do with each other. I was there-
fore extremely surprised to find that Snatchie had laid an egg on 15th
May. By the 17th there were two eggs. Unfortunately, the male, as the
young bird luckily appears to be, had entered the nest and literally played
football with the eggs. I removed one, which was damaged, on 21st May
and the next day the female came out of the the nest with a broken egg
adhering to her breast feathers. It is very pleasing to report that the pair,
now housed in an outdoor aviary, are inseparable and, at the time of
writing, both birds have been inspecting the nest box.

BREEDING ATTEMPT BY WHITE-RUMFED SHAMAS
IN A DOMESTIC ENVIRONMENT
By Judith Domin (Reading)
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999717375" page_id="56386729"  page_num="95" year="" vol="">
In summer, 1975, a pair of White-rumped Shamas Copsychus mala-
baricus was obtained, originating from Thailand. They were each installed
in a large box cage in our dining room. In this room also were cages
containing a Gold-fronted Fruitsucker Chloropsis aurifrons , Tickell's
Flycatchers Niltava tickelliae , Gold-breasted Waxbills Estrilda subflava ,
Dusky Thrushes Turdus naumanni eunomus , Dyal Birds Copsychus
saularis and, during the following winter, Pekin Robins Leiothrix lutea
and Indian White-eyes Zoster ops palpebrosa.
In common with the other birds, in addition to the natural perches,
food bowls, drinker and bath, each shama was provided with a tray of
earth and grass from the garden, renewed at intervals, in which they might
dig for centipedes, small insects, etc. This proved a great success, to the
detriment of the carpet. Already available to the other birds and supplied
to, or caught by the shamas were houseflies and blowflies, hatched in a
box with a small hole in the lid. Whilst this may not appear to be a suitable
item of food for culture in one's dining room, or in any room in the house,
in fact it presented little or no problem since, after various birds had been
released from their cages for exercise during each day, there were never
any flies left at large. The Tickell's Flycatchers were particularly adroit at
making a speedy job of removing any surplus. A commercial insectile
food was taken, together with a home-made soft food based on raisins,
honey, peanuts, cheese, egg and soya flour, and from time to time they
would accept grated cheese, minced beef, or hard-boiled egg. Chopped
fruit was offered, but not very often accepted.
With the exception of the zosterops who were allowed in the room for
exercise on their own at a different time, all the birds were allowed out
of their cages for exercise for approximately two hours nearly every day.
As the shamas settled down they were released also, at first on their own
and then with the others. It is interesting to note that over the two years
we had them, the shamas never, that we saw, initiated any aggression to
the other varied species of birds, although, if threatened, they would
retaliate with threats. In fact this first male shama was somewhat retiring,
giving the impression that he preferred not to associate with the general
rabble. The female was on reasonable terms with other birds, and for some
months appeared to have struck up a friendship of sorts with the female
Tickell's Flycatcher since they often chose to perch in close proximity.
With us they both became very tame, and showed some considerable
intelligence in many different situations.
In the first week of April, 1976 the female was observed trying to force
her way into the bookcase between the top of a row of books and the

shelf above. As she emerged, a piece of soft sphagnum moss fell to the
floor, pulled through the wires of the waxbills' cage we assume, since it
had been provided for the latter's nesting activities. Little more was
thought of this for a few days until we watched her fly to the curtains
with a scrap of moss in her beak and unsuccessfully attempt to creep on
top of the curtains underneath the pelmet.
A cardboard box was placed at a height of about 4J feet on top of her
cage, measuring 12 x 7 x 7 inches, open at one end, and as a start we
inserted at the far end of the box a pad of sphagnum moss. This was
immediately carefully inspected and we watched as she crouched low and
beat her wings on the moss, turning around as she did so and pushing the
whole into a rough shape. A supply of dried grasses of several types and
more moss was deposited in an old wicker wastepaper basket on the floor.
For the next 10-12 days during her two hours of liberty, the female
industriously built her nest, ignoring the birds around her. The basic
shape was composed almost wholly of fairly coarse grasses and moss,
together with other materials offered such as shreds of terylene curtain
material, soft paper tissue (which was highly favoured), and 6-strand wool
from a rug-making kit split into individual three inch strands. This latter
was quite thickly padded into the bottom of the cup. In addition, she
found some thin cellophane which was incorporated; also a few short 1
dried fir twigs about ^ inch thick. Offered also were horsehair and dog-
hair which were refused and small soft feathers of which very few were
used, two appearing to be merely decoration at the front of the nest.
The cup was finally finished off with the finest short grasses she could
find; when a suitable one could not be found, coarser grasses were carefully 1
split. Not knowing what type of lining would be required for the cup of ;
the nest, a shallow bowl of mud, hopefully of the right consistency, was j
given. This proved not to be required for nest-building, but we saw her
apparently eating particles of grit from the bowl at intervals. Other birds i
occasionally investigated the nest but were repelled by threats and angry
displays.
During this period interest was awakened in the male who, up to the
beginning of nest-building, had paid little attention to the female. However,
right up to the end of the second batch of eggs, his displays to the female
were always rejected by open-beaked threats and bouts of the typical
sharp clicking noises. At no time did we see the female soliciting. We !
were subsequently to find the following year that the displays of the Thai
male in 1976 were in fact very half-hearted affairs.
From 18th April, 1976, four eggs were laid on successive days, being
pale blue-green with brown spots, most of the spots being at the larger
end. They measured on average 20 mm long and 15 mm wide. The
second egg was very thin-shelled and, not knowing what else to try at this 1
stage, a dish of finely crushed cuttlebone was provided and this was
consumed in large quantities as if it were a great delicacy and all further

eggs had perfect shells. The next egg and those subsequently produced
were laid in the cage in the early morning, one being found in the bath.
Up to 19th July, 1976, a total of 14 eggs were laid, roughly in three batches.
The nest was visited each day, being adjusted and having more grass
added, but despite placing eggs in the nest for her, no further interest was
taken in them after laying, and later I found three buried under a new
lining to the cup. By the end of July the whole proceedings were forgotten
and the nest was ignored, whereupon I stored it away as an item of
interest.
In mid-July, 1976, a second male of Indian origin was purchased who
had a lump the size of a small pea on the inside of the left ankle. This
was painted regularly with white iodine, and eventually was knocked off,
leaving a clean wound which soon healed. However, the two end segments
of the middle toe on this foot broke away, presumably having had the
blood supply reduced for a long period, and the rear toe was drawn for-
ward, we assume through a shrivelled tendon. This resulted in the foot
being used almost like a hand. In December, 1976, a second female, also
of Indian origin, was acquired. This presented problems in allowing birds
out for exercise in suitable non-provocative combinations, since while
each female shama could be released in company with either or both males,
the two females showed antipathy to each other from the start and follow-
ing two fights, in which both lost several feathers, they were thereafter
released for exercise at separate times.
At the end of March, 1977, the Thai female began to pull dried grass
from the "garden" tray in her own cage and take it to the darkest corner
of the top of the cage now above her own, in which the Indian female
resided. It was interesting to see that, as she flew up past the second
female's cage front, she would very often cling to the wires and threaten
the occupant, thus dropping her materials and being obliged to come
to the floor to retrieve them. More materials of the same type as those
used in 1976 were provided but for some reason she could not get
a firm base constructed and was obviously frustrated. Therefore the box
and nest used in 1976 was taken from store and returned to her after it
had been treated for the possible presence of any mites.
The old nest was received with enthusiasm and the cup was carefully
relined over three days, during which time she began soliciting, not the
Thai male whom she had refused in 1976, but the Indian male with the
now badly deformed left foot. This soliciting took the form of seeking
out the male and turning slowly around in circles before him with lowered
quivering wings and tail held vertical. The male had been observing the
final additions to the nest in apparent interest and on occasion joined her
as she collected materials, but although he sometimes picked up grasses
and wandered around with them, we never saw him offer them to the female,
nor take any to the nest.
On 14th April an egg was laid in her cage, but unfortunately at this

point all the birds had to be caged for four days in the care of a friend,
since we had a pre-arranged short absence from home. During this time
three more eggs were laid. On our return we decided that if we were to
see further developments, both birds would have to be allowed their
liberty day and night whatever the disadvantages.
On 21 st April the female had laid one egg in the nest, and for the
first time we saw the male's courtship pursuit and display. Initially he
flew to the female uttering what can only be described as a shrill warbling
sound, quite unlike anything we had heard before. Perching just above
and in front of her, he gave the typical shama clicking sounds with lowered
wings, head and rump feathers raised and tail flicked violently to the
vertical with feathers opening and closing into a fan shape. The female
received these attentions by soliciting actions. She flew round the room,
the male following, the flight of both birds being exaggeratedly undulating,
unlike their normal direct level course, and alighted on the handle of the
portable radio (a favourite perching place) once more soliciting. The male
flew round the room again to finish up hovering in front and about eight
inches above her, again giving the shrill warble and similar display
except that the tail, whilst fanned out, was tucked slightly under the
body. This hovering display lasted only three or four seconds (appearing
like some enormous hummingbird) followed by mating, whereupon they
both reverted to the usual pattern of behaviour. We were fortunate
enough to be present at this procedure on two further occasions.
Despite the fact that both these birds were exceedingly tame and
trusting, particularly the female who was quite accustomed to being
fed her mealworm ration whilst standing on one's shoulder, it was never-
theless surprising that the courtship procedure ran the full course with
one or both of us in close proximity. Indeed, whilst we kept as still and
unobtrusive as possible, we might well have been part of the furniture
for all the notice that was taken of us.
On 24th April there were three eggs in the nest (a fourth had been
soft shelled and laid in the cage) and the female started sitting, initially
for about 25 minutes at a time with 10 minutes off, and later on during
incubation for 40-50 minutes with 5-10 minutes absence to stretch, eat
and drink. We never saw the male take any live food to her on the nest,
although on occasion he would go to the box entrance and peer inside,
both of them giving very quiet chirps. He never assisted with the incuba-
tion, although most times when the female left the nest, he either went
to it and perched on the rim looking down at the eggs, or stood at the
entrance to the box until she returned. The female shuffled the eggs
about with her beak each time she re-entered before settling down on
them.
Although late April, the weather in our area was rather chilly and we
did not yet feel inclined to put outside in the unheated aviaries (one of
which had been intended for the shamas) the various other birds that had

wintered in the same room. The problem therefore arose of allowing them
their accustomed exercise without disturbing the female shama. During
these periods the Indian male was returned to his cage and a large netting
surround placed around the whole area of the top of the Indian female's
cage right up to the ceiling. All food and drinking water was also placed
next to the nest box. This proved a satisfactory arrangement in general,
the female not taking objection to being peered at by Pekin Robins and
the zosterops. The only one of the larger birds that ventured to hang
inquisitively on the wire was the Indian female, who was very soon
intimidated into leaving the vicinity.
On the fourth day of incubation it was seen that the female had de-
veloped a watery right eye, but there was no discharge from the nostrils.
Four days later both eyes were watering, the nictitating membranes
beginning to draw back across: in addition she had developed an inter-
mittent dry cough. By this time both male shamas also had watery eyes
and all three were given terramycin, in conjunction with Visorbin vitamin
supplement, in the drinking water and on the mealworms. So far as the
female was concerned, with the persistent cough, it was felt that she
should be kept warm and, after some indecision, rightly or wrongly,
we decided to leave her on the nest rather than put her in an improvised
hospital cage since her indisposition had not lessened her desire to incubate
her eggs and it was felt she would be warm on the nest in the box at a
height of about 6 \ feet.
Our veterinary practitioner had been advised of the symptoms of the
three birds, and in an attempt to alleviate the distress caused by the
watering eyes (all three were rubbing their eyes) a proprietary ointment
containing i% yellow oxide of mercury was applied. The two males im-
proved considerably but the female did not, her cough having led to
laboured breathing, and on the 16th May she finally abandoned her eggs
after sitting tightly for 22 days. The eggs were examined and found to
be clear. She was returned to her cage, with a small shielded heater,
and started on a course of ampicillin rather than the terramycin. Her
eyes improved and the cough subsided, only to be followed in the next
few days by three "fits" in which she was seen to be somersaulting back-
wards uncontrollably. In the first week of June the earlier symptoms
recurred and on 9th June she was found dead in her cage.
The post mortem examination revealed the following:
"This bird died in good condition and there was no obvious sign of
discharge from the eyes, although feathers over the skull and around
the eyes were partially missing. The internal organs and brain appeared
normal. Proteus species bacteria were isolated in profusion from the
liver and lungs and from swabs taken from the eyes. This organism is
common in the environment and may invade animal tissues after death
but I would not normally expect it to grow in pure culture from the
fresh carcase of a healthy bird. It has been implicated in the death of

chicks and other birds and I think it was probably the cause of death
in this case. This organism is resistant to terramycin and may have
multiplied following successful treatment of the eye infection with this
drug. The stress of laying may have been a predisposing factor."
By the 28th May both males appeared to have made a complete recovery,
and as the weather was much warmer by then, the Thai male and Indian
female were put into the planted aviary reserved for them containing
bamboo, small shrubs and ground cover, and several of the other birds
went into their summer accommodation. Within two weeks the Thai
male once again developed watering eyes and was brought inside, the
Indian male, now recovered, going out with the remaining female. The
Thai male, although kept warm and treated with ampicillin and Visorbin,
progressed from bad to worse to the point where not only was he unable
to see from either eye with the membranes totally drawn over the eyes,
but each breath was laboured and noisy. Chloromycetin eye drops and
an inhalant were also tried with no effect and this shama succumbed on
the 27th July.
Post mortem results were
"Examination of the above bird ... following symptoms of eye infection
and respiratory distress, showed a considerable purulent discharge in
the right eye with some opacity of the conjunctiva. In addition a small
plug of white pus was found at the lower end of the trachea which
could have accounted for the symptoms of respiratory distress. The
lungs appeared to be normal and no other significant lesion was noted.
Direct examination of films from the tracheal pus showed the presence
of gram positive cocci and some gram negative bacilli. Cultures from
this material yielded a heavy growth of Proteus species in addition to
some other bacteria. These bacteria were very similar to those isolated
from an eye swab which consisted of a mixed growth of a Pseudomonas
species and another as yet unidentified gram negative bacillus. Proteus
species was also isolated from the liver. In view of the history of
several cases of birds showing respiratory symptoms in this aviary
we are attempting virus isolation from this material as well. A sensitivity
test report on the Proteus and Pseudomonas species shows the Pseudo-
monas to be highly resistant to antibiotics apart from sulphonamides."
Meanwhile in mid-June all appeared to be well in the aviary, the Indian
male attempting mating with his second female. However this came to
nought when, to our horror, on the 27th June the female refused her
evening mealworm ration and the following day was found dead on the
house floor.
Post mortem report revealed
"This thrush died in good condition. The chief lesions seen at examina-
tion consisted of congestion of the intestinal tract and inflammatory
changes in the liver probably sufficient to drastically affect the metabolism
of the bird. There was one necrotic abscess in the liver. Paradoxically,

on bacteriology the liver yielded only small numbers of staphylococci
whereas the spleen, which appeared grossly normal, yielded coagulase
positive Staphylocococcus albus. I have a feeling that the bacteria
isolated in this case are of secondary importance and that there may
have been an underlying virus infection in these three thrushes. A
histological study of the liver may provide more information."
As a final blow from fate on the 6th July the Indian male's eyes once
more started giving trouble and he too was brought in to hospital treatment.
The bird subsided into intermittent fits of coughing, and although he
was never affected quite so badly as the two others he died two days later
than the Thai male.
Post mortem report was
"The bird was in good general condition when he died, in spite of the
eye condition and the immediate cause of death, again, was B. proteus,
isolated from the spleen, the intestine, and a collar of necrotic material
covering the mucosa of the upper part of the trachea. Virological and
toxicological examinations are proceeding."
Subsequent reports received showed that tests for virus materials from
these three birds had in fact proved negative.
It is worth noting that despite all three birds being very sick, they ate
well throughout, even the Thai male who was ultimately reduced to
creeping his way around his cage walls to locate the food bowls. I under-
stand Visorbin to be an appetiser based on the vitamin B complex, which
presumably accounts for this.
It is generally accepted that Proteus species bacteria (see report on
Thai female) only invade tissues after death, and although each bird was
in the pathological laboratory within one hour of death, yet the post-
mortem results on all three birds with similar symptoms show no other
obvious cause for death, nor was there any evidence of virus infection or
salmonellosis. The only bird which had Pseudomonas bacteria present in
the eyes was the Thai male. Exploring all avenues, not only were samples
of foodstuffs analysed, but the nest itself was examined since it was a
remake of the previous year's nest and there was the possibility of spores
of fungi being present in the old or new materials, but this investigation
proved negative. In any event, had this been the case, how might one
account for the Thai male being affected since at no time did he have
access to or show interest in the new nesting material or the nest itself?
None of the other species were affected in any way, although for some
months in close proximity to the shamas. In the view of the known findings
one can only helplessly theorise. However, a programme of aerial disin-
fection with a bacteriocidal iodophor (Vanodine V. 18) was and is being
carried out both in the house and in the aviaries in an endeavour to keep
bacteria and viruses present down to a minimum. Should there be any
suspicion of a recurrence, a different approach to curbing a suspected

invasion by Proteus and Pseudomonas bacteria would seem to be the use
of a sulpha drug in conjunction with trimethoprim, a bacteriocidal
combination, since tetracyclines and penicillins seem to be ineffectual.
Notwithstanding the fact that breeding was unsuccessful and that this
pair died so soon afterwards in circumstances which could hardly have
been foreseen, there is some satisfaction derived from knowing that the
birds attained peak of condition and confidence to make the attempt in a
totally alien environment. It appears to show that, given a compatible
pair, these birds are prepared to breed even if a planted aviary is not
available.
A further pair of Indian White-rumped Shamas has been obtained
and, somewhat shaken by our experiences, we are hoping for complete
success with breeding in the future.

part ii The genus Chalcostigma
Of the five species which comprise the genus Chalcostigma , two only
appear to have been brought into Britain and these very rarely.
The Bronze-tailed Thornhill C. heteropogon is a large hummingbird
having an overall length of approximately five inches. Males have the
crown shining green, becoming bronzy on the back and turning to bronzy-
purple on the rump and upper tail-coverts. The throat patch, which is
narrow and pointed, is glittering emerald green terminating in glittering
violet on the upper breast; remainder of underparts are dull olive. The
tail is copper-bronze. Females are similar, but lack the glittering throat
patch. Although not very colourful, the species is smooth feathered and
may appeal to hummingbird enthusiasts because of this.
As with all the thornbills (both Ramphomicron and Chalcostigma ), the
Bronze-tailed has large feet and claws and a small beak. It is preferable
therefore to allow such birds to feed from a perch if they so desire.
Although I do not consider the Chalcostigma to be difficult in the sense
that the Eriocnemis are (see Mobbs 1974), it appears that few survive for
any length of time in captivity and it is rare for a specimen to be moulted
out successfully.
A peculiarity for which I have no answer (at present) is the habit these
birds have of holding the head to one side when completely at rest.
The birds do not appear subject to the complaint when first imported,
but develop the habit after a few months (or weeks in some cases) in
captivity. The longer a bird survives, the more pronounced the habit
becomes until eventually the head may be held in an almost upside-down
position. It is possible the habit is due to a nervous disorder to which
Chalcostigma become prone when kept in captivity. Ramphomicron spp.
may also develop the habit, but appear less prone than the Chalcostigma.
The Rainbow-bearded Thornbill C. herrani is slightly smaller than the
Bronze-tailed, having an overall length of approximately \\ inches. The
male has the centre of the crown, narrowing to a line on the nape, chestnut
(these feathers are erectile and form a ragged crest). Sides of crown and
upperparts are bronzy-green turning to purple on the lower back and
upper tail-coverts. The throat patch which is narrow and pointed is
glittering green, changing to violet-blue through green to fiery orange-red
on the breast where it is bordered with black. Remainder of underparts
are dull olive. The tail is purple, outer feathers broadly tipped with white.
The female resembles the male but lacks the glittering throat patch.
The song is very much like that of the Purple-backed Thornbill
Ramphomicron microrhynchum (see Part I) but is more harsh. When singing,

the bird protrudes the beard-like throat feathers and the ragged crest is
held erect. The male I owned would often become most agitated while
singing and at such times could be seen to beat its wings and sidle along
a perch with the tip of the beak and the extended throat feathers touching
the perch.
The airborne display of the male herrani consists of the bird hovering
on slowly beating wings in front of the object of display; the tail feathers
spread and the crest erected. The beard-like throat feathers are thrust
forward and the bird moves from side to side pendulum fashion; occa-
sionally a bird will also move backwards and forwards. Throughout the
display, the song can be heard. During the display, the tail feathers are
shown to advantage and it it possible to see how remarkably broad these
are.
Both Ramphomicron and Chalcostigma use the gleaning method when
capturing insect prey, i.e. taking an insect from a surface (usually leaves
or bark) with the tip of the bill, tossing the insect into the air and flying
at it with gaping beak so as to enable the prey to be taken into the rear
of the gape. However, both genera will also take insects from low growing
plants and tussocks of grass, this being particularly so with regard to
Chalcostigma. This procedure entails the hummingbird hunting insect
prey either on or close to the ground by actually running or walking,
snapping up insects as it goes. To enable the prey to be taken far enough
into the gape, the birds will, upon capturing an insect, toss it into the air
and with gaping beak tilt the head backwards.
It was approximately a year after purchase before the male Rainbow-
bearded developed the habit of holding the head to one side. However,
once it had developed this habit it was only a matter of months before
the bird's stance became so exaggerated that the head was held in an
upside-down position with the crown almost touching the perch whenever
it was at rest. It was 17 months before the bird began to shed feathers;
never did it complete this its first moult in captivity, as it died after
being with me for 20 months.
As already mentioned, there are five species in the genus Chalcostigma;
however, the Rufous-capped C. ruficeps , the Olivaceous C. olivaceum
and the Blue-mantled Thornhill C. stanleyi appear never to have been
brought into Britain.

Introduction
Observations on the nesting of Blue-grey Thraupis episcopus. Palm
Thraupis palmarum and Silver-beaked Ramphocelus carbo Tanagers in the
coastal plain of French Guiana are discussed.
These tanagers are common in and around Kourou, the Centre Spatial
Guyanais and forests nearby and Thraupis species could be heard or seen
at almost any time of the day. Palm Tanagers were found more frequently
around buildings, whereas Blue-grey Tanagers preferred forest areas.
Although absence of any sexual dimorphism prevents sexing of Thraupis
in the field, possible pairs were often seen; however, small flocks of
obviously unpaired birds were also observed. Pairs of Blue-grey Tanagers
were seen regularly to cross the open spaces between areas of forest
scattered along the Route Nationale no i. Pairs of Palm Tanagers were
often observed in the centre of Cayenne and Kourou. Males of Thraupis
were more active and noisy, often singing while their mates foraged,
preened or rested nearby. Silver-beaked Tanagers were only observed in
forest areas, especially on edges of secondary forest and along road and
river sides, e.g. near the Degrad Saramaka (Ingels, 1977).

Observations were made from August 24th to September 4th 1974
during a stay at the Centre Spatial Guyanais near Kourou, French
Guiana. Data were obtained during approximately 50 hours of observation
around the Centre and the Hotel des Roches at the mouth of the river
Kourou, and during 11 visits to the forest along the Route Nationale no 1
between Kourou and Sinnamary, and the Route du Degrad Saramaka.
Although observations were often scanty, I consider them worthy of
publication in view of the dearth of information on the nesting of these
tanagers in French Guiana.
The length of the different phases in the breeding cycle of Ramphocelus
and both Thraupis species used hereafter to determine the probable date
of first egg-laying, are taken from the literature on neotropical avifauna;
especially Skutch (1945, 1954)3 Haverschmidt (1954, 1968) and ffrench
(1973). Nest-building, incubation, nestling and fledging periods are given
in Table 1. Although this table gives extreme values, the most probable
length of one complete breeding cycle was estimated to be 54 (5, 12, 12,
25) days for Ramphocelus and 59 (6, 14, 18, 21) days for both Thraupis
species.

During the morning of August 30th 1974 ,1 observed a pair of Blue-grey
Tanagers searching for nesting material in a row of young, 3 m high
coconut trees Cocos nucifera situated alongside the lawn between the
hotel and the Club des Roches, both situated on the Pointe des Roches
near the Kourou river mouth. The female was collecting coarse fibres
from leaf sheaths at the base of the stalks of palm fronds, about J m from
the ground. Most fibres could be torn off only by the bird using her full
body weight; e.g. taking hold of a loose strand and hanging onto it with
wings fluttering. The nest was situated in the foliage at the end of a
slender bough, approximately 15 m high in the crown of an old mango
tree Mangifera indica which overshadowed the coconut palms. Although
male Blue-grey Tanagers usually help during nest-building (Skutch, 1954;
Haverschmidt, 1954), this particular bird was not seen to do so; he only
followed his mate. While the female was engaged in collecting material,
the male continually uttered his varied song interspersed with squeaky
call notes. I observed this pair from 08.30 until approximately 09.30,
when they flew to a nearby swampy forest bordering the mangroves at the
Kourou river mouth; obviously for foraging.
At certain times nest-building activities were discontinued while the
tanagers chased a pair of Great Kiskadees Pitangus sulphuratus from the
crown of the mango. The latter alighted approximately 3 m from the
tanagers' nesting site, and were immediately attacked by the Blue-grey
Tanagers. Great Kiskadees are common around Kourou; however they
are not usually harassed by the Blue-grey, other than when they ventured
near their nesting site (Haverschmidt, 1954).
Usually, the middle layer of a Blue-grey Tanager's nest is made up of
broad, flat grass blades and strips taken from coconut fronds (Skutch,
1954). Nest-building lasts approximately one week and eggs are laid
shortly afterwards (Haverschmidt, 1954). We can therefore deduce that
the usual nesting period would have been from approximately August 26th
to October 9th 1974. Egg-laying would have commenced on September
1st or 2nd.
A second nest belonging to Blue-grey Tanagers was found on September

2nd 1974, near the entrance of the C.G.S.'s Centre Technique main
building. The nest was situated about 2J m from the ground, on the base
of an I-shaped rafter supporting a porch. The nest was partly supported
by Bougainvillea branches, being attached to these with soft fibrous
materials and spiders' web. The nest was a neatly finished cup with thick
walls. The outer layer was composed of rootlets, fibres, dry faded
Bougainvillea floral bracts, tendrils with small dark brown seed pods,
cotton-like seedfluff and other unidentified material, bound with spiders'
web to a firm structure. The middle layer was made up completely of
pale brown, finely shredded bark fibres. The middle layer and inner
lining were separated by broad, flat grass or reed blades and some dry
oblong-shaped leaves of a shrub. The inner lining consisted of fine black
rhizomes. The overall diameter was 10 cm; the interior being 6 cm in
diameter by 3J cm deep. The nest contained two nestlings, approximately
10 to 12 days old. One youngster was slightly smaller than its sibling;
their eyes were open, and approximately 1 cm of vane of the wing feathers
was visible beyond the shafts. The pair were watched for two hours
(approximately 10.30--11.30 and 14.30--15.30) on the day I found the
nest. During these periods, the adults continued to feed the young
although greatly disturbed by my presence; one bird was especially
excited, uttering nervous alarm calls continuously. Although the sexes
are difficult to determine, I feel almost certain the latter bird was the male.
Skutch (1954) also found Blue-grey Tanagers very shy when nesting low;
however I found they go about their usual activities when nesting at a
reasonable height, as was the case with the pair nesting in the mango tree.
Food brought to the young was collected in low primary forest next to
the Centre Technique. The pair came always together to the nest: they
never alighted close to it when I observed them, although facilities
allowing them to do so were present (porch, branches of ornamental
shrubs). Instead they preferred to alight in a row of dwarf poincianas
Poinciana pulcherrima bordering an adjacent lawn, and approach the nest
by flying three to four short distances. Assuming both young were 10 to
12 days old when found, the eggs must have been laid between August 7th
and 9th 1974.
Palm Tanager Thraupis palmarum (subspecies melanoptera )
On August 31st at 14.15 I observed a pair of Palm Tanagers with one
fledgling, foraging in the crowns of tall coconut trees around the swimming
pool and along the beach in front of the Hotel des Roches. Although the
young bird could fly reasonably well, it was unable to navigate the long
stretch (approximately 25--30 m) between the last coconut tree to the
crown of the nearby mango tree where the Blue-grey Tanagers were
nesting. Instead it alighted in the young coconuts, where I had seen the
pair of Blue-grey collecting nesting material. The parents would also

typical drawn out "weeeet" calls. After a certain amount of foraging
amongst the coconut crowns, the young bird succeeded in flying to a low
branch in the mango, closely followed by the adults. The group worked
its way up through the crown, and came to rest in the outer branches
opposite the Blue-grey Tanager's nest, where they engaged in preening.
Whilst foraging, the youngster was not fed by the adults, but was seen
picking items (insects ?) from palm leaves. As its tail was almost full
grown, the youngster was estimated to be between 10 to 14 days out of
the nest, suggesting that the eggs of that brood had been laid between
July 15th and 18th 1974.
Silver-beaked Tanager Ramphocelus carbo (subspecies carbo )
I visited several times the Degrad Saramaka, situated approximately
45 km upstream of the Kourou river, where a pumping station supplying
the C.G.S. with water is installed. Around the Degrad both river banks
are covered mainly with humid primary forest.
On the afternoon of August 24th 1974, in a poorly kept plantation, a
family group of four Silver-beaked Tanagers was observed. The adult
male (by its colour) and the female (by her larger size and more confident
manner) could be distinguished easily from the two fledglings. During the
quarter of an hour I watched this group, the fledglings were not seen to
be fed by the adults; neither did they forage. The group appeared to be
merely wandering through secondary vegetation which had invaded the
plantation.
Assuming a 54 days' breeding cycle, the eggs from which these young
Silver-beaked Tanagers hatched were laid between July 1st and 7th 1974.
On the left river bank at a distance of approximately 1 km from the
Degrad were three or four clearings where undergrowth was completely
cut down, leaving only tall trees.
During my second visit to the area on August 25th 1974, I flushed a
female Silver-beaked Tanager from a 4 m high thicket of saplings in the
main clearing on the left bank. Answering her sharp alarm calls, a male
immediately joined her in the vegetation at the edge of the clearing. A
closer examination of the dense, small-leaved foliage revealed four nests
of Silver-beaked Tanagers (Ingels, 1977); only one was completed and it
contained two eggs in an advanced state of incubation, pale greenish-blue
with a few scattered reddish-black spots. The nest was a compact open
cup, attached by fine fibrous material and spiders' web to the main stem
of the tallest sapling, at a height of approximately 4 m. It measured 12 to
13 cm in external diameter by 7 cm in height. The interior cavity
measured 6 cm in diameter by 4J cm in depth. The bulk of the nest !
consisted of small dry leaves and strips from larger leaves, weed stems, \0x25A0:
grassblades, wiry roots, fibres, cobwebs, tendrils, black fungal filaments
and the like, all held together with fibrous material. The outside was *
decorated with a wiry-stemmed, small-leaved creeping plant. I assumed

the eggs had been incubated for 8 to 10 days, and were most probably
laid between August 15th and 17th 1974. Nest-building would have
commenced during the second week of August.
Influence of external physical factors on the breeding season
In the Guyanas, climatic conditions are intermediate between the
north-tropical climate of north-eastern Venezuela and Trinidad with a
long dry season from January to May and mostly wet weather for the
remainder of the year; and the south-tropical climate of central and
eastern Brazil with a dry period from July to November and wet from
December to June.
The mean monthly rainfall pattern of Georgetown (Guyana) and
Paramaribo (Surinam) (Snow and Snow, 1964) with its annual succession
of two dry and two rainy seasons, lies in between or combines those of
north-eastern Venezuela (Davis, 1953) anc * Belem (eastern Brazil)
(Pinto, 1953) where only one dry and one rainy season is found.
In French Guiana the rainy season from December to June is inter-
rupted by a short dry season in February and March.
Data collected in Belem (eastern Brazil) by Pinto (1953) show that the
greatest breeding activity falls from August to February, with a second
peak from October to December. Tanagers mainly breed from September
to February with a peak from September to November. However the
scanty data provided by Pinto would indicate that in eastern Brazil, the
breeding season of the Silver-beaked Tanager is more prolonged.
In Guyana there is a considerable amount of breeding during most
months, with two main peaks; one in March and April and a less important
one in September (Davis, 1953), the former coinciding with the end of the
short dry season and the latter with the beginning of the long dry season.
For Surinam, the little data available illustrate the intermediate nature
of the breeding season (Haverschmidt, 1968), e.g. nests of Silver-beaked
Tanagers are recorded for all months of the year, but mostly in January.
The mean monthly rainfall pattern for French Guiana has a more
south-tropical (or Belem) appearance, and one would expect the breeding
season to be spread more Belem-like, with a main part from August to
February. Our stay fell in the middle of the main dry season from July to
November and spreading of the nestings recorded is given in Table 2.

The Pheasant Pigeon Otidiphaps nobilis
In the autumn of 1977 the Berlin Zoo imported two Pheasant Pigeons
from New Guinea. This beautiful species, the size of a small domestic
fowl, is rare in captivity and has never before been in the collection here.
In its native New Guinea the Pheasant Pigeon lives in the mountain
forests to an altitude of 1600 metres. It is a ground bird which normally
only goes into the trees to roost and here the two birds are on the ground
throughout the day, but spend the night on a branch some 80 cm up.
They live peacefully with a pair of Cock of the Rock in a thickly planted
indoor aviary measuring 2.60 x 4.00 x 2.80 m. Their diet is composed
of a high quality insectile food, pigeon grain mixture, lean meat, live
insects, pieces of sweet fruits and bread soaked in milk and on this diet
they are thriving. The sexes are alike in general appearance, but naturally
we hope to have a pair and to breed this species so as to obtain more
knowledge of the biology of them.

THE MAURITIUS PINK PIGEON AT
JERSEY ZOOLOGICAL PARK

By David Jeggo (Deputy Curator of Birds)
It is perhaps fitting that the Jersey Wildlife Preservation Trust should
become involved with conservation in the Mascarene Islands, former
home of its symbol the Dodo Raphus cucullatus. Extermination has been
severe in these islands in recent times, so today the remaining fauna is
much impoverished and many surviving forms are rare and endangered.
One such form is the Mauritius Pink Pigeon Columba mayeri inhabiting
what remains of the forest. Estimates put its world population at 25-30
individuals. Nesting is now largely confined to a small grove of Crypto-
meria trees in one valley; isolated attempts away from that area may,
however, occur. Reproductive success is minimal: introduced monkeys rob
nearly every nest and cuckoo shrikes Coracina typicus also take their toll
of eggs so that few, if any, young are fledged. In an attempt to aid this
ailing population, a captive breeding programme has been set up, located
at Black River on Mauritius itself and now extended to the J.W.P.T. in
the Channel Islands.
In March 1977 Mr. John Hartley, personal assistant to the Hon.
Director, Dr. Gerald Durrell, flew out to collect the pigeons for Jersey,
The difficult task of capturing the birds was accomplished by a quite
ingenious method incorporating a "Bel-Chatri", a device used by falconers,
basically a dome of fine mesh covered with a myriad of tiny nooses. A
small bird is placed under the dome and as a hawk stoops upon this lure,
it becomes entangled. In the case of the pigeon, this was placed over a
nest with eggs. First entrusting the precious eggs to foster parents,
captive Madagascan Turtle Doves Streptopelia picturata and substituting
theirs in place, the incubating pigeons returning to the nest were, likewise,
trapped, first one partner and then the other. John Hartley returned to
Jersey with five pigeons, two pairs and a juvenile, and left on Mauritius
a further three to join the four already in residence in the aviaries there.
This species is about the size of a Rock Pigeon Columba livia and, in its
own subtle way, most beautiful. Head, neck and underparts are a light
pinkish-buff, brightest on the breast and neck, paling to almost white on
the head. Mantle and wings are a bronzy olive-brown, practically metallic
in the sun's rays; primaries have a pale margin. The pale grey back
merges with chestnut-brown on the lower rump, this colour continuing
in upper tail-coverts and tail except the outer rectrix on either side
which shades from chestnut through grey to buff-cream on this out-
side edge. Legs, feet and periophthalmic ring are coral pink. This pink
extends about three-quarters of the length of the bill, giving way to an
off-white at the tip.
The pigeons arrived in Jersey on 7th April, 1977, and were kept in a

well insulated, heated shed, both pairs and the juvenile separately. On
warm sunny days as spring advanced, they were allowed into outside
aviaries and, once mild enough, given free access to these. In the wild
they apparently eat the fruit, flowers and leaves of forest trees: with us,
despite being offered a more varied diet, they eat largely seed (wheat and
white millet mainly) plus a little hard-boiled egg, grated cheese and some
leaves, mostly willow and to a lesser extent hawthorn, stripping portions
from the sprigs provided. Intermittently coming to the ground, they are
basically arboreal and consequently food is put on a raised shelf.
Being such recent arrivals, breeding in their first summer was not
expected: however nesting platforms were fixed up high inside and out,
screened with branches of holm oak to give some privacy. In July, the
male of one pair came into fine condition, the colour of his periophthalmic
ring and bill was particularly vivid. Flying to the same branch as the
female, he would display, walking along the branch in an upright posture
and with exaggerated movements; nearing her he inflated his chest fully
and bowed, cooing at the same time. Copulation was not observed. Some
days after courtship had first been observed, a scanty nest of twigs was
made on an outside platform upon which the female would sit for varying
periods of the day. On the morning of 3rd August, she was on the aviary
floor, very weak, and one egg was in the nest, which was fostered under a
domestic pigeon. Heat soon revived the female and she appeared normal
the next day and on release from her heated quarters was soon brooding
a pigeon egg substituted in the nest. Two days after the first, a second egg
was laid. They brooded well and the first egg, which by candling proved
fertile, was returned to them. One egg fell from the nest and broke, but
on 17th August, egg shell was found inside and later that day a chick
was observed under the female. As only 14 days had passed since the
laying of the first egg and available literature gives an incubation period
of 18 days, this was rather surprising. The squab appeared to develop well
and by the tenth day was covered by emerging chestnut feathers, but that
evening was left unattended. It had a hard cheesy substance caking its
throat and corner of the bill. It had trichomoniasis and died a day later.
Swabbing revealed the breeding female to be carrying trichomoniasis.
After treatment with Emtryl, subsequent swabs proved negative. The
same breeding pair laid one egg in October, but soon broke it.
New accommodation is being constructed, comprising a block of four
outside aviaries, with a large inside area for each. We hope to install the
pigeons in early spring and to see some strong young reared this
season. As soon as this charming species is breeding well, we look forward
to reporting more exhaustively in this journal. Three birds were success-
fully reared by a captive pair on Mauritius in 1977 and two more from
eggs collected in the wild.
This species is perilously near extinction, but let us hope that successful
propagation on Mauritius and in Jersey can help to restore a healthy wild

This symposium was attended by some 200 persons from at least ten
countries. Most people were, of course, from the host country, but there
were also representatives from Belgium, Canada, Denmark, Great Britain,
West Germany, Holland, Hungary, Japan, South Africa and Switzerland,
each country supplying at least one speaker.
Eighty papers were presented at the 4J day symposium and this
required up to a 13-hour day, so after three days this proved too much for
all but about three dozen diehards who were still there at the 10.0 p.m.
talks. These late speakers are to be commended for their endurance.
As could be expected in such a huge presentation, the talks varied from
the intensely interesting to the "so what" and while a wide variety of
subjects was presented, it was felt that waterfowl were a bit over-
represented and that a number of papers could have been more generalised
and thus have been of interest to a wider audience.
The symposium was directed mainly at conservation and breeding and
the gathering was heavily weighted with zoo and conservation people and
with veterinarians, while the hobby aviculturist was poorly represented
both in attendance and presentation, but the United States bird traders
were much in evidence. There was an unfortunate gap in the spectrum
of birds represented with nobody talking about the breeding of finches,
for instance, while the breeding of parrots was poorly represented.
Canaries and Budgerigars were not mentioned at all, but they can hardly
be considered endangered species. Raptors were well represented and
presented.
The half-dozen women speakers were all quite good, so one up for the
ladies. Rosemary Low's talk was marred by the fact that it could not be
heard at the back of the room for much of the time, the audience being
apparently too polite to point this out until too late.
Many good slides were presented and these are an easy way to please
an audience. All will remember the shots of Peruvian tanagers, etc. by
J. P. O'Neill of Louisiana University and Joseph Forshaw's of birds of
paradise. The latter gentleman came through as a dedicated conserva-
tionist. Topics of interest to all included the following:-

A well researched and well referenced paper on nutrition by Pieter
Holsheimer of Deventer, Holland. He will shortly publish a book (in
Dutch) on this subject.
Interesting techniques for the sexing of birds--by cloacoscopy, using
an ordinary otoscope, by a local doctor (Bill Hauser) and a method using
the oestrogen/testosterone ratio from faecal specimens. This latter method
is being tried at San Diego Zoo and was explained by Dr. A. C. Risser,
Curator of Birds. It involves equipment costing #20,000 or so, plus skilled
laboratory workers, so do not get excited yet.
A suggestion on the prevention of Aspergillus infection by using a
vaccine, but this was not backed by any scientific experiments.
A "surefire 5 * diet for raising baby softbills, from Dr. Donald Bruning,
Bronx Park's Curator of Birds, consisting of dog "kibble" (biscuit) and
--the difficult part--chopped baby mice.
Some speakers will be remembered for themselves; others for their
useful information and a special mention should be made of Ichiyuki
Kojima of Kyoto Zoo. He had intended to show a film of the breeding
of the Coscoroba Swan, but the cine projector would not function, so
he was forced to read through his paper despite language difficulties. Can
you imagine lecturing in Japanese? The loss of the film was a pity, because
the camera had been set to film the swans at every minute of daylight for
(I believe) 120 hours and obviously greatly detailed observation had gone
into this study.
Also worthy of special mention was Dr. W. Russell, a veterinarian who
came from the Transvaal to show a number of slides of South African
birds. His reports indicate that aviculture and bird breeding, especially
by private hobbyists, is on the increase there.
The speakers who made the greatest impact by all accounts were S. D.
McKelvey and L. Gibson. The former was a last minute substitute and
a fortunate choice. He gave an informative account of endangered species
in Mauritius (an ecological disaster area) and this was accompanied by
slides of the last two or three dozen Mauritius Pink Pigeons. The latter's
talk on avian parasites could have been sub-titled "Tapeworms can be
fun" and was complete with a one metre long model tapeworm. Some
slides of parasites and their ova were rushed through, unfortunately, for
the talks were limited to 25 minutes.
It was obvious where the general interest lay, as the Thursday session,
on nutrition and medicine, saw the hall packed to capacity of over 200.
Some snippets of information that stick in the mind included
Rothschild's Mynas (or Grackles) Leucopsar rothschildi can be sexed by
crest length, those of males being over 60 mm and of females less than
55 mm.
Penguins (and presumably other fish-eaters) can get severe thiamine
(vitamin Bi) deficiency symptoms by eating fish, especially herring and
other oily fish, that are not fresh. The fish contain an anti-thiamine

Hand-fed baby parrots may get food compacted in the crop. This
should be removed by means of a syringe and tube.
Slippery footing--such as paper--is often the cause of hand-fed chicks
not feeding or begging for food properly. Provide a surface that they can
grip well.
Even with enough hours of light, some birds will not be stimulated to
breed unless the light is bright enough---a possible cause of failure in
attempted indoor breeding.
Birds cannot digest lactose and 4% (dry weight) in the diet can be
fatal.
Many and varied recipes were offered. Arthur Douglas of Dallas, Texas,
produced some ancient Roman ones that were more sensible than many
later recipes.
On the pheasant side Jean Delacour at 87 still managed to get into some
lively debates and Mrs. (Iain) Grahame was an efficient stand-in for her
husband.
The symposium was organised by Jan R. van Oosten of the International
Ecological Conservation Foundation, Seattle and already one is being
planned for next year.
It was felt that this meeting was a bit early in the year (spring being a
week or two away) so if it is arranged for a little later it may attract more
overseas visitors and more local aviculturists who can combine attendance
with a holiday.

Writing from Ljungbyhed, Sweden, Mats Tell reports a poor 1977
breeding season with his birds. For the first time in ten years he bred no
Bourke's Grass Parrakeets; Lesser Patagonian Conures had two clutches
of infertile eggs and Eclectus Parrots had chicks dead in the shell. He did,
however, rear 14 Lesser Redpolls, 3 Bluish Finches Sporophila caerulescens,

collections, and treated with considerable respect, but nowadays this
species is so freely bred as to be advertised as "Turks".

The Andean Parrakeet Bolborhynchus orbygnesius formerly known as
B. andicolus is reported as having been bred in Denmark during 1977 and
this appears to be the first European record. O. E. Christiansen writes to
say that the pair were purchased from a Danish dealer in January 1977
and were at first kept in a cage, but when, shortly afterwards, it was
noticed that the two showed much interest in each other, they were put
into an aviary and provided with a nest box of two compartments contain-
ing some sphagnum moss. The birds spent much time in the box and on
13th February two eggs were seen, but in March when the nest was again
inspected it was found that five eggs had been laid, three of which con-
tained dead chicks. In April the birds nested again and in mid-May
young were heard, a single chick leaving the nest in mid-June. The food
provided was a variety of seeds (some germinated), carrot and a range of
other items such as dog biscuit. Various fruits were offered but were not
eaten, but chickweed and dandelion were eaten and presumably fed to the
young one. If anyone should know of a previous captive breeding in
Europe of this species (which should not be confused with B. aymara ),
we should be pleased to hear of it.

Members and guests who attended the January wine and cheese party
heard Mr. Elgar's talk, illustrated with slides, on hummingbirds. Among
the interesting information on hummingbirds in captivity, he said that,
even without a mate, females will build nests and lay eggs very readily,
provided, of course, that the environment, suitable nesting sites and
materials are available to them.

to the Zoological Society in 1976)--three eggs laid in a sand-covered
drainpipe: two hatched and one chick was successfully reared. Double-
toothed Barbet - nested in the soft wood of a tree stump and two young
left the nest. They were identical to the parents but for being a duller
red on the underside. Andean Condor - these are so aggressive toward
each other that they are only together for short periods during the breeding
season. In 1977 one fertile egg was laid and a chick hatched, but it died
after two days. Black-footed Penguin - two young reared, one by the
parents and one hand-reared from an egg hatched in an incubator. Other
species successfully bred during the year are: Ruff, White-cheeked
Turaco, Sacred Ibis, Cattle Egret, Grey-headed Gull, Speckled Pigeon,
Chinese Necklace Dove, Mountain Witch Dove and among the pheasants,
Cheer, Blue Eared, Brown Eared, Mikado, Swinhoe's, Nepal Kalij,
Sonnerat's Jungle Fowl.
The breeding of hornbills has been concentrated on for some time and
during the year three species nested. Jackson's Hornbill - in June, while
the female and chick were still in the nest, the male died. He had been
the parent of six young and had been the first of the species to breed in
captivity. The complete nest was moved behind the scenes in the Bird
House and the keeper staff took over the feeding. The female accepted the
changed situation and soon the young one (a male) was also taking food
from the hand of a keeper. It fledged successfully and is now with an un-
related female. Tarictic Hornbill Penelopides panini - a single young one
reared. The female did not leave the nesting hole for 98 days and the fully
fledged youngster, a male, left two days later. Red-billed Hornbill - two
young were reared in 1976 (the first in this collection) and in 1977 f* ur
were produced. A Saddle-billed Stork that had been in the collection for
almost 30 years has died and an Argentine Lapwing, brought from
Argentina by Gerald Durrell 23 years ago, has also died.

BREEDING THE VIOLET-NECKED LORY
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.979558566666667" page_id="56386757"  page_num="119" year="" vol="">
I acquired my first Violet-necked Lory Eos squamata in 1973, but it
was August 1974 before I could get a mate for it. The following spring
they were put into an outside flight measuring 9 x 12 feet with a shelter
6x3x6 feet high.
The first egg was laid on 8th May 1976 and there was a second which
was unfortunately chipped: however, the chick hatched on 6th June and
was reared. I still have this bird which is extremely tame.
The hen laid again on 20th March 1977, hatching two chicks this time,
but one was found dead two days after leaving the nest and I think it
must have flown into a perch, as the neck was broken. The second chick,
however, has grown into a beautiful bird. Much to my surprise the hen
laid again on 14th November 1977 an d two eggs hatched on or about the
12th of December, but the weather turned cold two weeks later and, on
seeing both parents out of the nest box for longer than usual I looked
into the nest and found one chick dead and the other stone cold but still
alive. I put it into a hospital cage and it recovered a little. I managed to
feed it for a few days, but it did not survive.
At the time of writing (28th March) the hen has been sitting for two
weeks. I feed my lories on sponge cake soaked in Stimulite nectar, Farlene,
Farex or Bemax with honey and a separate dish of nectar is also supplied.
For additional vitamins I use Adexolin, adding one drop per bird to the
nectar. When the birds are feeding young, they eat large amounts of green
food, mainly milk thistle heads, spinach and chickweed given fresh two
or three times a day: they are also fond of seeding grasses.
The Violet-necked is, I am sure, one of the most beautiful of the lories
with its lustrous crimson plumage and the deep violet band on the under-
side and the neck, the latter reaching up to the back of the head. I was,
of course, pleased to read of Mr. and Mrs. Wright's success with this
species and I hope there will be many more breedings of this delightful
little bird.

others for a time, but has now been inactive for several years. I am a
former member of the Wild Bird Hospital Society endeavouring to start
a similar group under a different name, possible "Friends of the Bird
Hospitals", "Friends of the Birds", or simply "Aves".
Aviculturists realise, perhaps more than anyone, the ignorance prevailing
in connection with bird rescue and care. There are few hospitals and few
individuals who know where to begin, willing though they may be. It is
hoped this could be remedied by degrees, seeking through membership
subscriptions, donations, etc. to raise money for this work. Even in the
early stages I feel that much could be done through circulating news
letters and information sheets to foster practical help for birds, which are
so badly catered for in contrast to the situation regarding, for instance,
the domestic dog and cat.
Although primarily aimed at helping native wild birds, we would,
through this Society, always aim for inclusiveness, exotic species being
accorded the same care and attention if the need materialised. "Aves"
is the word.
I am hoping that many aviculturists will wish to support this venture
and I should be pleased to hear from any prospective members, from all
who wish to be informed of developments and from existing and pro-
spective bird hospitals, all in fact who would like to be listed initially for
news letters if support is forthcoming. Stamped and addressed envelopes
would be a help. A registered charity is envisaged.
Will those interested please contact me by letter or telephone (East-
bourne 23875)? All suggestions regarding the venture will be most
welcome.

Cholcopsitta atra
By Rosemary Low (Barnet, Herts)
If there is one species in my collection which is never passed without
comment from visitors, it is the Black Lory. The usual comment "Is that
a parrot?" can be forgiven, for the plumage of this species is so unlike
that associated with parrots. The body plumage is all black, with a plum-
coloured sheen. The underside of the tail is red and yellow. Some adult
birds and all immatures show scattered red feathers, usually on the head.
One Black Lory developed scattered red feathers after it had been in
my possession for two years, and lost them after a further two years. At
one stage it had one red tail feather and splashes of red on the upper and
lower parts and on the under wing-coverts. It is of interest that a Black
Lory bred at San Diego Zoo was almost entirely red in nest feather but
moulted out black.
It is possible that this species evolved from a red bird. In Stella's
Lorikeet Charmosyna papou stellae , another mainland New Guinea lory,
melanistic specimens are common--in some areas perhaps more common
than those of normal plumage. It is not difficult to visualise how the
melanistic phase could eventually predominate, especially as its coloration
could be advantageous. However, red predominates among the coloration
of the larger lories, so it must be judged a successful colour.
My first Black Lories were obtained in 1971. One bird of the pair
unfortunately lived only five months; autopsy proved that it was an
aged bird. Another was obtained and the two were instantly compatible
but never made any attempt to breed. They lived together until 1975
when I obtained a third bird from a friend. Its larger size and more
massive head made both my birds look very feminine. The newcomer
was housed with one of these birds.
Their aviary was situated along part of the wall dividing our garden
from the next and, at the request of our neighbour, the side was left
open but for the welded mesh. In the spring of 1976 the interior of our
neighbour's house was renovated and bricks, wood and other items were
thrown from the upper windows. This was probably the reason why

the lories chewed their flight feathers off. In the autumn they were
therefore moved to a new aviary in a quieter situation. It measures only
6 feet (1.8 m) long, 3 feet (91 cm) wide and 6 feet (1.8 m) high. The
enclosure has no shelter but is in a sheltered part of the garden and the
birds invariably roost in their nest box.
None of the Chalcopsitta lories have pleasant voices and that of the
Black is particularly loud and strident. Fellow A.S. Council member
Prof. Hodges described that of our pair as the most painful on the ear
he had ever encountered. I agree--in fact in the spring of 1977 they
became almost unbearably noisy. The male became extremely bold, so
much so that it was necessary to construct a safety device over the feeding
hatch and a wire cage was placed permanently over the earthenware bowl
in which the nectar is provided. Previously it had become very difficult
to remove the nectar dish and, finally, the male took a piece out of my
finger!
During the second week in May the female laid. On June 8th she
deserted the nest and it was then inspected for the first time and found
to be empty. Either she had destroyed the eggs or chicks had hatched and
died at a very early age. From her behaviour, it would seem that the
female laid the first egg of the second clutch on July 9th. On August 5th,
i.e. 27 days later, I heard the sound of a chick which could have hatched
one or even two days previously.
The following day was the first of nine days of intensive work on a
range of aviaries, the end enclosure of which was next to the Black Lories'
aviary. The whole range was pulled down and rebuilt, as work on it:
could not be postponed. A Perspex screen was erected so that the Black :
Lories could not see what was going on although there was much distur- :
bance which often brought the female from the nest: however, she
always returned in a matter of minutes.
My husband and I were quite prepared to hand-rear the young should
the parents desert them--but this did not happen. We knew from the
sounds coming from the box that there were two chicks. They were
reared on the usual nectar made from glucose, malt, condensed milk,
Farex baby cereal and added vitamins, mixed with water to a fairly thin
consistency, with wheat germ cereal added. The only 4 &quot;extra" provided
was a very small drinker of milk daily. Occasionally ripe pear was taken;
fresh corn-on-the-cob was refused.
After the chicks hatched the adults became much quieter; at last there
was relief from the deafening screeching which met the ears of anyone
who walked past their aviary; however, the male's aggressiveness asserted
itself in another manner. Before the chicks were a month old the aviary
was entered on a couple of occasions to put some additional peat in the
nest box. On the first occasion the chicks were covered with dark grey
down; on the second occasion they were nearly naked.
The adults clearly resented this intrusion, so the aviary was not entered

again until September 17th through sheer necessity. The birds had gnawed
the nest box to such a degree that the lid had split in two and the chicks
were exposed to the weather which was cold. It was not until after the
chicks fledged that we realised the reason for this destructiveness. As we
were unable to add fresh peat, the inside of the box would have become
very damp from the liquid droppings of the young birds had the adults
not remedied the situation. They destroyed the lid in order to provide a
deep bed of splinters on which the chicks rested. The liquid droppings
were actually running out of the holes in the bottom of the box--but
the chicks were dry.
When my husband entered the aviary to repair the lid, he had to take
down the box to ensure that part of the lid had not fallen inside. He
repaired the lid and was replacing the box when both birds attacked.
The male bit his finger severely, causing him to drop the box; fortunately
he caught it before it hit the floor. The birds had to be caught up before
he could leave the aviary!
During the last week in September the chicks were seen looking out
of the entrance hole. They seemed calm and unafraid, making no attempt
to hide as do many parrot chicks on sight of humans. It was then that
my suspicion that the chicks were being plucked was confirmed.
The first fledged on October 17th, aged 10J weeks. A friend who was
staying with us told me that it left the nest at about 3 p.m. It was dark
when I arrived home and the news that it had left the nest was worrying
in view of the weather: for five days fog had persisted. I checked the
aviary in the dark and saw that one of the adults was roosting on top of
the box with the youngster. Although it was foggy, the night was warm
and the temperature remained at 50*F (io*C).
Next morning I saw that the youngster was three-quarters covered with
feathers and looked well and confident. The following morning I ex-
perienced the kind of disappointment which every aviculturist knows
sooner or later and recalls evermore with a sinking heart. The young lory
was dead beneath the nest box. During the previous day it had been so
severely plucked that its underparts were bare. Autopsy revealed that it
was a female and that there were no signs of disease.
It had probably succumbed from exposure, perhaps aggravated by the
presence of a predator, species unknown, which a few days later was to
kill one of our most valuable birds. When I inspected the birds before
first light, several in aviaries near the Black Lories' enclosure were clinging
to the wire--evidence that they had been disturbed during the night.
On finding the young lory dead, I entered the aviary and caught the
adults--making sure I caught the male first, as the female would not
attack without his support. I took down the nest box and gently removed
the surviving youngster in a towel. The family was transferred to a large
cage in the house which had a nest box attached. Within minutes the
young one had found its way into the box. The next day it spent most of

its time in the cage, returning to the box at night with its parents.
Four days later it was seen feeding itself from a nectar container hung
near the perch. Five days after that I returned the adults to their aviary,
as they had continued to pluck their youngster. It thrived on its own,
feeding on nectar; also sponge cake and nectar and soft pear and grapes.
By November 20th it was completely covered in feathers, except for a
small patch of bare skin surrounding the eye which is more conspicuous
in immature birds because the skin is whitish, not black as in the adults.
There are most red feathers on the ear-coverts and a few on the body:
the beak and eyes are black.
During December the young bird went through a period of hiding in
the nest box so that I had to deny it access for hours at a time. Then
suddenly its behaviour changed completely. In early January it would
gingerly nibble at my fingers when I changed its nectar: within three or
four days it was friendly and playful and would stand on my hand and
allow me to stroke it. By the end of the month it would jump on to my
hand as soon as I put it in the cage and would even run up my arm to be
taken out of its cage. It has proved to be a most delightful bird and I am
hoping that its friendliness will not turn to aggressiveness, as can happen
with hand-reared lories. It is very fond of bathing and keeps its plumage
in immaculate condition.
I believe that this is only the second occasion on which the Black Lory;
has been bred in Britain. E. J. Brook of Hoddam Castle was successful
in 1909. This species has been bred on several occasions in San Diegol
Zoo since 1969 and in 1977 * n South Africa in the collection of Brian
and Jane Boswell.

BREEDING THE PLUSH-CAPPED JAY AT PADSTOW BIRD
GARDENS

Alternatively known as the Pileated or Uracca Jay, Cyanocorax chrysops
has a fairly extensive distribution in central South America which is split
to form two separate populations. The smaller occurs in northern Brazil
while the larger encompasses southern Brazil, Paraguay, Uruguay,
Bolivia and northern Argentina. At 35 cm it is one of the larger of the
South American corvids. Head, sides of neck, throat, and breast black
except for a bright blue spot above eye and silvery-blue spot and mauve
malar stripe below. Nape pale blue darkening to mauve on neck. Back,
wings and tail deep blue, the latter being tipped creamy-white. Lower
breast and rest of underparts creamy-white. Bill and legs black; irides
yellow. The sexes are alike in general appearance.
One pair were purchased from a local aviculturist during the first week
of February 1977 after they had made several nesting attempts the previous
year, none of which advanced further than the foundations of a nest.
Because they had spent most of the winter outdoors and were being given
sole occupancy, they were transferred direct to a planted flight measuring
4x3x2m high with a raised 1 x 1 x 1 m adjoining shelter. Ground
cover was of grass and with a large Leycesteria dominating the shrubbery.
Both birds were timid at first and spent most of the time in the shelter
where they were fed on a diet consisting of our own insectile mixture,
diced fruit, a little grain and a day-old chick each, the latter being given in
the afternoon. Live food is given when available and usually takes the
form of maggots and snails, but practically anything offered is eaten with
relish, especially freshly-killed mice.
Both birds settled quickly, but remained timid for several weeks before
gaining enough confidence to remain outside whenever someone passed
the flight. On March 6th, four weeks after arriving, one was seen carrying
a twig, but soon lost interest and dropped it. That afternoon one spent
some time sitting on the sacking base of a large wire-netting version of an
enclosed nesting basket, an item remaining from the previous tenants.
It had been planned to replace this with a more conventional type nest
tray, but as the jays were showing an interest in it, the sacking was renewed
and it was then left. It was still fairly exposed, for the Leycesteria is, of
course, deciduous, but at two metres from the ground, it would be, in
summer, the most densely leaved part of the plant.
Despite the birds' activity over the next few days, a spell of dull wet
weather soon halted any nesting intentions and it was not until April 7th
that interest was again noticed when one bird occupied the basket late
in the evening. At this point, no sticks had been taken up to the nest
and the first effort involved a piece about 35 cm. long. After struggling

for several minutes attempting to get it inside, the male flew to a nearby
branch and tried to break the stick by grasping it between his feet and
stabbing it violently with his beak. This proved a failure and it was soon
dropped. Only a few sticks were taken to nest over the next few weeks
and by April 28th, when the first egg was laid, only half a dozen or so
lined the nest.
Two more eggs were laid at one day intervals and incubation appeared
to commence with the first egg. As far as could be ascertained, incubation
was by the female alone, although at times she would be joined for brief
spells by the male who usually sat beside her. During this period she was
not observed off the nest to feed nor was the male seen feeding her,
although his visits probably signified he was doing so. The first sign of
hatching appeared on May 16th after an incubation of 18 days. Besides
the normal diet, maggots laced with Adexolin multi-vitamin liquid and
calcium were offered ad lib. and baby mice were given daily. Throughout
the first day only maggots were fed which the male swallowed and took
to the female who in turn fed the chick by regurgitation. Next day,
consumption of maggots increased enough for us to feel certain that a
second egg had hatched. The female now assisted the male in feeding
duties with each strangely adopting a different method. The male used
the method described above or, if the female was absent, fed the chicks
direct. Female on the other hand grabbed four or five maggots from the
dish and took them beneath the nest where she ripped each into small
pieces before swallowing and carrying them to the chicks. Each piece
was then regurgitated and fed individually. Small pieces of fruit were also
taken to the brooding female but these she did not appear to feed to chicks.
Young were heard for the first time on the 18th when faint noises were
audible whenever one of the adults landed on the edge of the nest. From
then on, up until the time their eyes opened, the chicks became extremely
vocal each time something caused the nest to move: they were always
noisy when fed.
On the 23rd, the female left the nest while the flight was being cleaned
and a quick inspection revealed two chicks with quills just beginning to
appear. There was a marked difference in size, giving the impression that
a middle nestling had died. When the nest was approached closely in
this manner, it was the only time either adult showed any hint of aggression
Both birds would fly to a nearby branch, tail bobbing with crest partly
raised and calling loudly. No attack was ever pushed home, but I feel
certain it would have been had the nest been meddled with.
All appeared to be progressing well, but on June 6th, with chicks
aged 21 days, one was found dead beneath the nest mid-morning after
seeming perfectly healthy when fed by adults first thing. Neither of the
adults then paid much attention to the nest, so a search was made for the
remaining chick, but it was never found. Several days later, the female
was again on the nest for brief periods and throughout the day was fed

titbits by the male. Over the next week she spent long spells on the nest
and on the 14th I accidentally disturbed her whereupon she flew over to
the male and adopted a low crouching position with wings and tail spread.
Mating did not occur and she soon flew off. No true display involving
both birds was witnessed, but the occasional display seen by Whitmore
(in Goodwin 1976) was performed whereby one bird stretched to the
full length of its legs, then jerked up and and down rapidly before returning
to a normal posture, uttering a loud "kuk kuk kuk" throughout. This was
performed by either sex with no apparent set pattern. The male fed the
female frequently, performing the task delicately and it was the overall
gentleness of the sexes towards each other that was really noticeable
during breeding.
The second clutch commenced on June 16th and again three eggs were
laid with incubation again starting at the first egg. Incubation patterns
followed as for the first clutch and on July 5th, after a period of 19 days,
one egg hatched. This proved to be the only one; whether the remaining
two hatched was undiscovered as no remains of either egg or chick were
found and it was assumed these were eaten by the adults. The same diet
was offered as previously and the solitary youngster progressed well.
Faecal sacs were removed by both sexes and deposited in the same area.
Initially, two or three sacs were removed daily which increased to eight
to ten as the chick neared fledging. After several days of restless wandering
about the nest, the chick finally left mid-morning on July 28th, aged 23
days. Overall coloration was much duller than that of the adults. Tail
shorter, but had about the same amount of white as adults, accounting
for half the tail as opposed to a third in the adults. Legs paler in colour,
almost grey. Blue spot above eye present but less pronounced. Markings
below eye absent. Beak black; irides dark brown.
At the beginning of September the young bird lost all tail feathers,
but these soon started to grow again and in mid-October commenced a
deeper moult. On completion, overall colour was still dull, but the tail
had grown to three-quarter length. Blue spot above eye brightened and
became more extensive. Silvery blue spot and mauve malar stripe below
eye began to show. Irides started to lighten and are now (early January)
amber. The young one was first noticed feeding itself at 45 days old, but
it continued to be fed for some weeks after. Still begged for food, but if
ignored, helped itself when the parents 5 backs were turned. Last seen
being fed on October 4th (91 days old) and shortly afterwards started to
bury objects. Stones were the first objects buried, these being placed
methodically beneath soil, then, bringing the head back, it would bury
them deeper with a single sharp jab. Acorns from the holm oak were
dealt with in the same way by all three birds. Initially, only a small number
were fed and these were dug up and eaten the following day. By late
October when acorns were plentiful, enough were given to provide a
surplus and odd ones are still being unearthed in January.

The Lineolated Parrakeet is, with the exception of the parrotlets, one
of the smallest members of all the American parrakeets, being approxi-
mately 7 inches in length.
It is an ideal aviary subject; it is not at all destructive, is quiet and is
amicable with other species. A. A. Prestwich (1954) states that "Very
little seems to have been written about this parrakeet and what little
has tells us almost nothing respecting its habits in the wild state." Now,
a quarter of a century later, the same remarks still apply and Rosemary
Low in her excellent book the parrots of south America (1972) can only
endorse Prestwich's remarks.
Unfortunately the Lineolated Parrakeet was never regularly imported
into the United Kingdom and was therefore only rarely available. Since
the quarantine regulations have been enforced (March, 1976), none have,
to my knowledge, been imported into this country. In all probability
few, if any, will ever be imported again.
Distribution
Lineolated Parrakeets are apparently often found at high elevations in
the sub-tropical zone of the mountains of Central America from southern
Mexico to western Panama. In 1871, Salvin stated that he saw a flock in
Guatemala, approximately 8,ooo feet above sea-level. Blake (1953) sa Y s 3
"A rare bird in Mexico, occurring only in dense forests at high altitudes."
It has been recorded that large flocks of these birds have been observed
high up in the trees. In captivity Prestwich stated that it "crept rather
than walked", and that he did not ever remember seeing this bird actually
walking on the ground. My birds, however, frequently alight on the soil
covering the aviary floor and pick over any food which may have dropped
thereon.

This small parrakeet is basically green in colour, the intensity of colour
varying tremendously between individuals, some being grass-green
whilst others are of a more apple-green hue. The feathers of the crown,
nape, mantle and sides of the neck, extending beneath the wings down the
hanks and rump, are edged with black. The smaller wing-coverts are
broadly edged with black, the secondaries and primaries being only
narrowly edged with black and the green tail is also edged with black.
The beak is horn-coloured, the iris dark grey and the legs pinkish.
Some birds, particularly youngsters, show a slight bluish tinge on the
head. In my experience both sexes are identical in plumage although
Prestwich stated that the plumage was not identical in the sexes. He wrote
that the female was slightly smaller than the male and appeared stouter
in build with the tail wholly green, the feathers not being broadly tipped
with black as in the male. Rosemary Low, however, found that Lineolated
were difficult to sex, one which she always believed to be a hen, was on
post-mortem found to be a cock. Upon examining skins of three labelled
as females, only one showed "hen" characteristics whilst the other two
had black on the tail and wide black edges on the wing-coverts. This latter
view is one which I share, as having been successful in breeding this
species for the past four years and having some 18 individuals in my
aviaries at the present time, I am still unable to sex them with certainty.
Immature birds are generally paler in colour and, as stated previously,
show a much more extensive bluish tinge on the head.
Forshaw, quoting Schonwetter (1964) in his parrots of the world
( I 973), gave the measurement of an egg in the Nehrkorn Collection as
19.5 x 19.2 mm, but it had been pointed out that the length seemed to
be too small for a bird of this size. The average size of egg from birds
which have laid in my collection is 22 x 17 mm, the egg being white.

Forshaw (1973) states that in the wild they feed on seeds, berries,
fruits, nuts and probably leaf buds and blossoms, but very little else has
been recorded regarding their natural diet.
In captivity my birds are fed on a staple diet of plain canary seed to
which is added a small quantity of sunflower seed. Various types of millet
seeds have been offered, but have usually been ignored. Millet sprays are
occasionally provided, but they are normally destroyed rather than
eaten. A quantity of Madeira cake which has been soaked in a nectar
mixture is given daily and is eaten avidly. They show a marked preference
for apple and grape rather than other varieties of fruit, whilst of greenfood,
duckweed is particularly relished. A small quantity of hard-boiled egg is
given daily together with some of my home-made softbill mixture which
is increased when young are in the nest. Oystershell or mineralised grit
and cuttlefish bone are always available and water is always provided.

Lineolated Parrakeets, owing to their small size, do not need particu-
larly spacious accommodation. My outdoor flights are only 9 x 2 \ x 6 feet
high and in these I have successfully kept and bred from as many as three
pairs of birds. Nest boxes have a 1J inch diameter entrance hole and the
internal dimensions are approximately 9 x 9 x 12 inches high. These
boxes have a 3 inch layer of a peat and wood shaving mixture lining the
base and the boxes are left in position the year round so that the birds
can use them for roosting and to escape the worst of the weather. Earlier
writers have suggested that these parrakeets need to be kept in a warm
environment and not subjected to temperatures lower than 6o* F. My
birds are, however, housed in outside quarters all the year round and
never show any signs of discomfort even when the temperature drops
below freezing as it has several times last winter.
Natural perching is provided, usually willow or apple branches and
from these they often strip the bark, although the timber framework of
the aviary is never damaged.

Breeding
The Avicultural Society's medal for the first successful breeding of the
Lineolated Parrakeet in the United Kingdom was awarded to A. A.
Prestwich for his success in 1953. Prestwich decided not to interfere with

<bodyText confidence="0.9802673" page_id="56386778"  page_num="130" year="" vol="">
his birds whilst nesting, owing to their secretive nature, so he left them
well alone. He did, however, manage to establish that they had four eggs,
three of which did not hatch whilst the fourth hatched and the chick was
successfully reared. During subsequent years in the 1950's Prestwich
had further successes from his birds kept in the "Darenthe-Hulme"
collection at Oakwood, North London.
Mrs. D. K. Draper (Basingstoke) also recorded a successful breeding
in 1954, but since that time I cannot trace any records of breedings in
the U.K. These birds have, nevertheless, been reared in the U.S.A. and
on the continent in recent times.

It was in March 1974 that I purchased three Lineolated Parrakeets
(sexes unknown) from a friend who had decided to dispose of his birds.
These were housed in one of the aviaries already described. In August
of that year, two more were introduced to the original trio, having been
acquired from Rosemary Low who needed the aviary space for some other
birds. One of the new birds had only the use of one wing and obviously
could not fly, but it managed to get about by clambering on the aviary
netting.
Two nest boxes had been provided for these birds, but they had not
been inspected at all during the summer, so imagine my surprise when on
10th October, three babies emerged from one of the boxes, a fourth

following the next day. All four young were successfully reared and were
left in the aviary with their parents. Unfortunately, one of the adults
was found dead one day during December that year, but the rest survived
and were to be the nucleus of my future breeding colony.

On 26th April, 1975 I decided to inspect the nest boxes which hung
in the aviary, as two or three of the birds out of the eight which shared
the aviary had been missed for some weeks. One of the boxes contained
seven white eggs but in the other I found one of the adults (which was
dead) together with a single egg.
Although the birds were very agitated when I had previously inspected
the boxes, curiosity got the better of me and so on the 18th May I once
again looked in the nests--one of the boxes was empty but the other
contained one chick which I estimated to be about two days old. On a
further inspection on nth June, the chick seen previously was found dead,
about ten days old I reckoned, but three more eggs were in the nest.
I did not inspect the nest again until 13th August, when it contained
four eggs which looked fertile. The previous eggs obviously had come to
nothing. A further inspection on 10th October, revealed six eggs--one
which was broken--whilst the second of the two boxes contained
three eggs. It was from these three eggs that on 5th December two chicks
emerged from the nest. A third baby which was fully feathered was unable
to leave the nest and subsequently died. The other box at this time was
empty. These two chicks were the only ones reared that year and these
remained with the others in the aviary.

It was not until 26th May that I decided to inspect the nest boxes
which had been used as roosting quarters during the winter. On this
occasion I removed both boxes to empty the contents and renew the peat
and wood shavings which badly needed replacing. In one of the nests
were two stale eggs which had been completely buried, together with a
decomposing chick, and in the other a dead chick approximately five days
old.
The next nest inspection was on 25th July when I entered the aviary
to replace the perches which were by now hard and brittle. One of the
boxes contained one baby about ten days old together with two eggs.
Nothing, however, resulted from this clutch. At further inspection on
19th September I saw six eggs in the one box (two of which were broken)
and one egg in the other.The final nest inspection on 30th October revealed
three eggs in the first box (two of which were clear, the other dead in
shell) whilst in the second box were two clear eggs and one decomposing
youngster about two weeks old, so once again I cleaned out the boxes.
For a long time I had been trying to obtain some new blood to introduce

into my birds, but none had been available since the quarantine regulations
had been introduced in March of that year. By good fortune I was put
in touch with a lady living in Sussex who had purchased a number of
1975 birds from a breeder in Hampshire and in November we exchanged
three birds with one another. The new parrakeets had been kept previously
in an indoor birdroom, so rather than risk putting them out this late in
the year, they were placed in an indoor flight 5x4x6 feet high in my
unheated birdroom with the intention of putting them out into an outside
aviary in the spring.
At the beginning of December one of the adults in the outdoor flight
was removed for treatment as it appeared to have an eye infection. Despite
treatment the bird became worse and eventually died from a growth
which made the eye swell to enormous proportions. I now had only five
birds left in the aviary plus the three newly acquired, which were in the
birdroom.

The three newly acquired birds were, unlike my other Lineolated, con-
siderably steadier and tamer, no doubt because they had been kept in
cages by their previous owner. On 7th February I placed a nest box in
the quarters, as I felt that these birds needed one in which they could
sleep: within a day or two the box was being inspected. As these birds
accepted my presence much more readily than my others did, I decided
to make a daily inspection of the nest.
The following observations were notes taken from my diary
16th February, one egg in box.
17th, egg missing.
18th, another egg in the box.
20th, two eggs in box.
The nest box was not disturbed until 13th March, as two of the birds
had decided to take up residence in this box, but inspection on this date
revealed one newly hatched chick--covered in wispy white down--
together with nine eggs.
14th March, two chicks in nest.
18th, three chicks in nest.
No more of the remaining eggs hatched and by 29th March pin feathers
began to show on the oldest of the three chicks.
1st April, green feathers started to show, particularly on the tail.
8th, the youngest chick (which had always been much smaller than the
other two) was found dead.
19th, the oldest chick (now fully feathered) left box.
22nd, the second chick came out of the box.
24th, two more eggs in nest. The eggs which were infertile from the
first clutch having been previously taken away.
25th, three eggs. The older of the two chicks seen eating hard-boiled egg.

4th, the chick was found to be badly mutilated, but still alive.
8th, the hens stopped incubating and the remaining eggs were removed.
It was apparent that the failure of any of the second clutch to be reared
was due to the presence of the two youngsters from the first nest which
still shared the flight with the nesting trio. They had remained with their
parents as no alternative accommodation was available, but by 6th July
I had completed another outside flight and so these two young were
taken away and released into it.
15th June, a third clutch was started but the newly-laid egg was cracked.
16th, two eggs in nest.
18th, three eggs.
19th, four eggs.
20th, five eggs in nest, but two were cracked so I removed them and
cleaned out the box, replacing the three good eggs.
22nd, five eggs in box.
23rd, six eggs.
25th, eight eggs.
26th, nine eggs.
27th, ten eggs had now been laid, so I decided to remove two which
I put in an incubator.
28th, ten eggs in the nest again, so again I removed two, one of which
I unfortunately broke but the other one was placed in the incubator.
30th, there are now nine eggs in the nest; one which was obviously
infertile was removed.
5th July, only seven eggs now remained in the nest.
6th, as already stated the two chicks from the first clutch were removed
from the parents on this date but yet another egg had been laid making
a total of eight in the box.

was found dead in the outside aviary having had a night fright, so one of
the hens was taken away from the other two and placed in the aviary with
the surviving baby.
The remaining hen continued to incubate and on the ioth July, the
first chick from the third clutch hatched.
nth July, a second chick hatched but only five eggs now remained in
the nest, although three were still in the incubator.
14th, a third chick hatched.
15th, one of the eggs in the incubator started pipping, so it was placed
back in the nest where it duly hatched. The remaining eggs in the incu-
bator were infertile.
17th, another chick hatches, making a total of five now in the nest.

14th, ringed the fourth oldest chick.
20th, on inspecting the box the hen was found to be dead but all the
chicks which were feathering nicely were thriving.
21st, although the cock was a model parent, I decided to help out and
fed the chicks some hot cereal, soft food, egg and nectar with the aid
of a spoon.
22nd, I again hand-fed the chicks but as the cock was feeding well,
did not attempt to hand-feed again.
31st, the first chick left the nest with the others following on the 2nd,
3rd, 4th, 5th and 6th November, respectively.
All six young were reared completely to independence, making a total
of 12 reared in four nests by one cock and two hens, laying a total of 48
eggs.
Meanwhile the five original birds in the outside aviary began to lay and
on inspecting the boxes on 23rd April, I found five eggs in one which
looked fertile. A further observation on 9th May, however, revealed that
the eggs had disappeared.
On 20th May, the bird with the use of only one wing (purchased in
1974) was picked up dead from the aviary floor. I did not inspect any of
the nest boxes again but on 13th July, two badly plucked young emerged
from one of the boxes, a third youngster (also badly plucked) coming out
the following day.
I decided to clean out the nest box now that these babies had revealed
themselves and on 17th July, removed the box. It contained another chick,
fully feathered, although plucked but which could not emerge from the nest
because its legs were 'splayed' and it had not any use in its feet. I cleaned
out the box and decided to replace this chick in the faint hope that it
might be able to make some use of its legs. By 30th July however, this
youngster had still not managed to get out of the box so I again entered
the aviary. The baby was still alive but in the same condition as previously
and the nest contained a further three eggs. I removed the young one
and placed it in the other aviary containing the other young parrakeets
but although it could by now feed itself it could not hold itself upright
and died a few days later.
A further inspection of the nest boxes on 12th September revealed one
chick approximately three weeks old plus two infertile eggs. This chick
either left the nest on 30th September or 1st October (both days I was
away from home), as I found it dead on the aviary floor on 2nd October,
having died I suspect from exposure as the weather had by now turned
very cold and the chick had been plucked almost naked.
I again looked in the nest boxes on 7th November, when this same box
had another clutch of six eggs in it. By 13th November only four eggs
remained in this box and two days later on the 15th one of the adult

SUMMARY
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.9992218" page_id="56386784"  page_num="136" year="" vol="">
From a total of five birds purchased in 1974 together with the intro-
duction of three birds received in exchange, a grand total of 21 Lineolated
Parrakeets have been reared to independence in my aviaries.
The average egg size is 22 mm. x 17 mm---colour white.
Incubation averages 18 days.
Chicks should on average be close-ringed at 12 days old with a size
N ring.
Chicks leave the nest at five weeks of age.
In my experience, provided that nest boxes are provided for roosting
in during inclement weather, Lineolated Parrakeets can withstand
temperatures which fall below freezing, although they obviously should
not be subjected to such conditions for too long.
These birds are, in the wild, gregarious by nature. In captivity they are
sociable if kept in small colonies and should be kept in earshot of each
other if housed in pairs for successful breeding to be achieved.

A GUIDE TO ANTIBIOTICS IN AVICULTURE
By L. Gibson (Dept, of Bacteriology, Royal Columbian Hospital, New
Westminster, B.C., Canada)
Little specific information is available on the use of antibiotics in
aviculture: they tend to be used in a haphazard fashion and they are
understood little if at all. These notes are primarily for people with no
access to laboratory facilities and we will start with some definitions which
will make the following notes clearer.
The use of antibiotics is called chemotherapy and this includes chemicals
as well as antibiotics. Strictly an antibiotic is a substance produced by a
micro-organism which has antagonistic effects on other micro-organisms,
but because of popular use, the term also includes chemical agents such
as the sulphonamides (sulfonamide in the U.S.) often abbreviated to
sulpha--not sulphur. In addition, many antibiotics are now manufactured
solely by chemical means and newer variations are synthesised with
increasing frequency.
"Micro-organisms" usually means bacteria, but in a general sense will
include viruses, fungi and yeasts, a yeast being a particular form of fungus.
"Soluble" means soluble in water unless otherwise specified. "Sensitive"
(or susceptible). Bacteria that are inhibited by an antibiotic are said to be
sensitive to it and laboratory monitoring of this is called sensitivity testing.
The organism may be killed or merely inhibited from multiplying and
bacteria that are unaffected are called resistant to the specified agent.
"Cross-resistance". Bacteria that are resistant to one antibiotic may be
resistant to all other antibiotics in that chemically related group. This is
commonly seen in the sulphonamide group and the tetracyclines.
Antibiotics may belong to a group of closely related compounds. While
they exhibit similarities, they may also differ widely in some properties;
for example, solubility. This is why it is useless to talk about dosage and
application of, say, tetracycline without specifying the particular com-
pound. The generic name is the chemical name of the antibiotic, whereas
the trade name is the brand name of one seller (not necessarily the manu-
facturer). Generic names are used unless otherwise stated; brand names
are given for identification and, of course, may vary from country to
country.
Antibiotics differ, even within the same group, in many ways and these
differences include (besides solubility), effectiveness per (weight) of dose;
affected or not by food, stomach acid or bile (pH); diffusability into various
body sites; inactivation in the body by pus, blood, serum or other sub-
stances; development of resistance with varying degrees of rapidity by
organisms; toxicity, etc. They also vary in mode of application--by
mouth, i.e. absorbable from the intestine, or by injection directly into the
bloodstream, or they may only be of use topically. Topical application is

<bodyText confidence="0.999391533333333" page_id="56386786"  page_num="138" year="" vol="">
applying an antibiotic as an ointment, drops or powder to the outside of
the body, as on a cut, etc. The method of excretion and, importantly, the
rate of excretion vary-- e.g. via the liver or kidneys in from 30 minutes
to 12 hours or more.
Antibiotics may be grouped together in many ways--by chemical
relationship, e.g. the penicillins, the tetracyclines, the sulphonamides, etc.,
or by mode of action; whether they kill the organism ("bactericidal") or
inhibit its growth and multiplication ("bacteriostatic"). There are some
soluble and some completely insoluble with every degree in between.
They can be grouped by range of action against various micro-organisms--
the "spectrum" of the antibiotic, "narrow" or "broad". "Broad spectrum"
is an overused term and there are always many resistant organisms within
any one antibiotic's spectrum. Some are relatively safe; others more
dangerous. Note that safety is only relative. No antibiotic is completely
safe and though toxicity is usually dose-related, it is not necessarily so.
Recipients could have fatal allergic reactions or other conditions like
liver failure, depending on individual idiosyncracies or on physical con-
dition--particularly on the state of the liver or kidneys. Often the thera-
peutic level and the toxic level are very close.
The proper use of antibiotics should be dictated by laboratory tests.
These are not available to many people, but even when they are, birds
present special difficulties. Some laboratories may produce quite inac-
curate reports; also laboratory tests may take a few days to produce results
and treatment may need to be started beforehand. The "blind" use of
antibiotics is called empirical treatment, and we will concern ourselves
with this. We will, therefore, have to pick a few antibiotics from the
myriads. Some will not be readily available, so the field is already narrowed.
Cost is relatively unimportant as birds need only tiny quantities.
Only antibiotics that can be given by mouth (or beak) will be con-
sidered and these can be divided into two groups. The systemic ones are
absorbed by the digestive system, then carried by the bloodstream all
around the body and hopefully to the site of infection. If the infected
area is inaccessible to the blood or body fluids--such as in a closed
abscess or in an air sac--there will be little or no effect by the antibiotic.
A second rather minor group is not absorbed and these substances there-
fore pass straight through and would only be used for intestinal infections.
A later comment will be made on this. Next we must try to decide which
antibiotics have the best chance of hitting an unidentified infection. Note
that many infections cannot be treated. Mycobacterial infections (tuber-
culosis, etc.) cannot be treated under normal circumstances and eventually
cause death. Fungal infections are hopeless. Although slow in progress,
they sooner or later prove fatal. Viral infections may clear up rapidly after
only mild illness, or they may just as quickly be lethal. Although viruses
are not affected by achievable blood levels of antibiotics, they often run
their course quickly and are then followed by bacterial invasion of the

body. This secondary infection then delivers the fatal blow. We can in
some instances save the bird by treating the secondary infection.
We must also think about safety, or to put it more forcefully, we could
think in terms of toxicity. The groups under consideration are reasonably
safe. Others have such a slight margin between efficacy and danger that
they will not be considered. At the other extreme is under-dosing which,
either by quantity or by too long a time interval, is not only ineffectual
but may allow bacteria to develop a resistance to the antibiotic. There
would then be no response to a future correct dose. Treatment via drinking
water is a common cause of this.
In general, treatment via the drinking water is a useless approach.
Firstly, note that most of these antibiotics have very poor solubility in
water and also that solutions or suspensions taste awful. Birds are very
efficient at utilising water in food and they are good at finding condensed
moisture to drink. If observed closely, it is usually found that they drink
little or none of the concoctions, certainly not enough to get a therapeutic
dose of the antibiotic. One suggestion to overcome this is to put the bird
in a hot hospital cage to force it to drink. Points to consider here are that
apparent consumption may be due to evaporation and recovery may be
due to the heat.
While I do not doubt that birds are sometimes cured by medicated
water, most claims to this effect are rather naive and the birds would have
recovered due to the supportive treatment or even without any treatment.
The practice of putting what are invariably sub-optimal amounts of
antibiotics in food or water as a prophylactic is to be deplored. This is a
major reason for the widespread resistance to the tetracyclines by many
organisms.
The measurement of tiny doses is not practical for most of us and these
doses should in theory be related to the body weight. It is convenient to
consider small birds in 10 gram divisions and larger cage birds in 100 g
groups. Once you learn a few, you can with reasonable accuracy tell the
weight of all your own birds and others of the same size. Most small
aviary birds are in the 10-40 g range. Parrots, of course, show a wider
variation.
Hundreds of compounds are synthesised annually, but the great
majority are discarded because of their toxicity. This leaves us with but a
few choices. These are listed alphabetically in order of the generic name
and they are all systemic.

These chemical "cousins" of the penicillins are being synthesised thick
and fast. Only one oral form is at present available--cephalexin. It has

the latter fails (or vice-versa). A good empirical choice.

The only one of its kind. It is mentioned because it has a wide spectrum
and may work where others fail. Because its general use has dropped off,
many organisms are currently susceptible. It can produce rare, but fatal
cases of anaemia by bone marrow failure. Its dose/safety ratio has not
been assessed in birds in this respect. Can work against Chlamydia
(ornithosis) group. It would be a good second choice if the first antibiotic
was having no effect. Is supplied in capsules.

There are many of these. Penicillin itself has too narrow a spectrum to
be considered for empirical use. A synthetic derivative, ampicillin, is our
best choice. A further modification, amoxycillin, has a slight advantage in
dose frequency; otherwise it is identical with ampicillin. Like all peni-
cillins, they have a good safety margin and, like all the group, they taste
absolutely awful. Unfortunately, widespread use has eroded an otherwise
broad spectrum. Moderate to good first choice. Supplied in capsules.
Ampicillin--Dose: 6 hours. Safety: good. Solubility: 1:170. Partly

Another large group, all of which exhibit cross-resistance. They have
suffered more than any others from overuse and misuse. This has caused
many gaps in an otherwise very wide spectrum, to the extent that they
are relegated to second choice.
The tetracyclines vary in activity (per unit dose), in solubility and in
their inactivation by food and body substances. The most active is
minocycline: it has the advantage of a 12-hour schedule and only 2/5ths of
the dose of the older tetracyclines is needed. It frequently causes nausea
and vertigo (in people) and this would be difficult to assess in birds.
The next most active is doxycycline with a 24-hour schedule. As above,
2/5ths of the amount of other tetracyclines is used. It is extremely nauseat-
ing on an empty stomach. Absorption of these two is unaffected by food,
and indeed food is recommended, as it helps to dispel the nausea. Dis-
continue treatment if it causes the bird to stop eating. The more readily
available older (25 years old!) tetracyclines are similar to one another.
These are-

in solution and readily inactivated in the body.
Tetracycline hydrochloride (Achromycin, etc.). Solubility: 1:10.
Oxytetracycline HC 1 (Terramycin). Solubility: 1:2.
All are affected by food and other substances, so absorption may be
erratic. This may be worse in vegetarian birds because alkaline conditions
prevent tetracyclines from dissolving, or may precipitate them out in the
intestine. Calcium in milk or other foodstuffs may cancel out a dose.
Other tetracyclines are intermediate between the above mentioned
groups in activity, absorption and ease of inactivation. Although they
are generally safe, certain points should be kept in mind. Prolonged use
may lead to a secondary or replacement infection from the yeast Candida
or from certain resistant bacteria such as Pseudomonas. Putting the anti-
biotic in drinking water in quarantine stations is a likely cause of this. In
theory at least, tetracycline should not be mixed with food which contains
citric acid (citrus fruits) or given to growing birds. This is because it
could form a toxic compound in the first case, or interfere with growth in
the latter case. There is also the above-mentioned nausea which con-
tributes to loss of appetite.

A clever combination of chemicals in a ratio of 5:1, giving a broad
spectrum antibacterial synergism. The medical form uses sulphamethoxa-
zole and my experience (and these notes) are mainly on this. The veterinary
form uses sulphadiazine and this differs little from the other except that
it tastes much worse and I do not think birds would eat it voluntarily.
This is strange because only the trimethoprim component is supposed
to be bitter. Other sulphas may be used in various countries. The human
form has the advantage of being the only antibiotic (in these groups) that
is palatable enough to be eaten by birds when mixed with food. The
manufacturers state that the animal form can be given at 12 or 24-hour
intervals and the human form at 12 hours. I give either at 8 or 12 hours.
This compound (abbreviated to SxT) is the first choice for unknown
infections and it is particularly successful in respiratory and intestinal
infections (if the organisms are sensitive, of course). These together account
for the great majority of cage bird infections. It is also effective against
some types of coccidia (mainly Eimerid ).
Dose: 12 hours. Safety: good. Insoluble absorption: affected by food.
Taste: relatively palatable.

all showing cross-resistance. They are somewhat slow acting and may need
a high dose in order to work. There are about 30 sulphonamides, half of
which are probably available. With the exception of the sodium salts, most
are almost insoluble. They are replaced by SxT (see 5 ).
Now we will look at antibiotics which can be administered orally, but are
not appreciably absorbed into the bloodstream. These types pass straight
through the gut and would be used only for intestinal infections, which are
by far the commonest kind in cage birds. In practice this approach some-
times does not work well for reasons that are unclear, and the physiology
of the bird as well as some of the organisms involved may predispose to
these infections becoming systemic as well. I once found that a Salmonella
infection, which had gone systemic, could only be eradicated by using
both an absorbable and an "intestinal" antibiotic together. Both types
had failed earlier when used separately although the organism was sensi-
tive to both. However SxT (which was not available then) has proved
effective in eradicating human Salmonella. I now use it for these intestinal
infections and seldom have to resort to anything else.
The non-absorbable antibiotics should have a wide safety margin, but
inflammation of the intestine may allow more absorption than was first
suspected. As these substances are usually very toxic, caution is advised.
Neomycin is the most widely available.
Topical preparations can be conveniently mentioned here. A wide
variety is available as ointment, cream, powder or drops. These are mainly
of non-absorbable types, but some can contain systemic antibiotics
(chloramphenicol is common). This should be kept in mind if the bird is
likely to eat the stuff. This would only be a problem with some parrots.
Non-antibiotic substances are also available, such as iodine preparations.
This variety, and the high concentration in the topical products, makes
them effective in dealing with a variety of bacterial, fungal and even viral
infections, provided they are external, of course.
Dosage:
As it will be impractical for most people to actually measure a dose, the
following systems can be used.
Tablets:
These are the easiest to administer. Break up the tablet and give the
bird a piece of between 5 and 10 milligrams of active compound for every
10 g of body weight.
This applies to birds of up to 100 g weight. Give the larger dose to
smaller birds (up to about 40 g), and the smaller end of the range to
larger birds. From 100-200 g, give 50-60 mg. Above 200 g, give approxi-
mately 0.25 mg per gram with a maximum dose of 150 mg. I suggest this
maximum because I have had no experience with birds above 300-400 g
weight.

to average almost 8 mg/seed. Large white millet Panicum miliaceum was
just over 6 mg/seed. Assorted pieces of tablet were judged by eye to be of
an equal volume to the seed. When weighed, these pieces were quite
consistent at about 15 per cent heavier than the seed (i.e. about 9 mg and
8 mg respectively).
These apparently high doses are given for the following reasons. I think
that there comes a point where tiny doses are ineffective and toxicity is of
minor importance if the dose is strictly related to body weight (based on
human or mammalian doses). Using human criteria, some doses would
be so small that they could not be administered efficiently. The physiology
of the bird is quite different from other creatures: birds have an extremely
rapid rate of metabolism and digest things and excrete waste at an astonish-
ing speed. For this reason (based on observation rather than experimenta-
tion), I think they can tolerate, and in fact need, higher doses of medica-
tion than mammals. Food reduces the absorption of many antibiotics, and
consequently more of the latter is needed on a full stomach than on an
empty one to produce the same blood levels. One can assume a bird has
food in its stomach all during its waking hours. On no account withhold
food. When birds are sick, they often eat poorly and I think that many
curably ill birds die from starvation before disease. Therefore it is often
wise to force-feed the bird at the same time as it is given medication (if
there is any doubt at all about its starving). Often birds can be pulled
through by warmth and feeding alone. The Gouldian Finch in its first
moult is the prime candidate for this.
It would probably also be better to give more frequent doses because
of the high metabolic turnover. I have seldom experimented with this,
mainly because I am not at home all day, and it takes two to dose a bird.
If a bird is very sick, I try to dose it every three hours (except during
the night) for the first day, if I can.
The 12-hour antibiotics are a decided advantage, and I try to give the
dose at about eight-hour intervals. They save dosing in the middle of the
night. If 6-hour ones are not continued through the night, the treatment
will often be of little advanatge.
Tablets or other solid substances should be pushed right down the
throat with tweezers and followed by a few drops of water. This breaks up
the tablet and lessens the chances of it being regurgitated. If feeding as
well, give the medicine first for the above reason.
Capsules contain powder and judging the dose is more difficult. If you
try and standardise your approach, a reliable system can be attained by a
little trial and error. Obtain a plastic 1 ml (cc) dropper. Do not use a
glass dropper in case it breaks in the bird's throat; (parrots, of course,
could snap it easily). Ascertain the weight of the capsule--250 mg is the
usual size, but some may be 500 mg. Minocycline and doxycycline are
100 mg, but this is equivalent to 250 mg of other tetracyclines. Put
approximately half of the contents of a capsule in 1 ml of water in a

small vessel. Eggcups are convenient. Because of the wide variation in
solubilities, squish the mixture in and out of the dropper to mix just
before administering.
Determine the number of drops per ml from your dropper. Divide this
into your mg of powder to get the number of mg/drop. Fifteen drops is
an average figure and half a capsule is about 120 mg so there will be
8 mg/drop. Usually, it is somewhat less than the calculated figure because
of loss on the sides of the dropper and mixing vessel. Based on 5-10 mg
per drop, give small birds up to 20 gm, one drop; 25 to 50 gm, 2 drops;
50 to 150 gm, 3 drops. Larger birds (300 gm and up) get 4 to 6 drops.
These doses should not be compared on a weight for weight basis with
tablet doses. They are arrived at purely as a matter of convenience, inas-
much as they can be measured approximately, without any special equip-
ment. No birds were ever lost due to antibiotic toxicity as far as could be
determined and where the disease was an early-onset bacterial infection,
survival was 100 per cent. Birds may attempt to cough up the suspension,
and if this is a problem, sweeten the water with sugar to mask the bitter
taste. Some antibiotics come already in a suspension (for children). They
are laced with something (e.g. peppermint) which, far from masking the
bad taste, usually makes it doubly nauseating: therefore I never use them.
Put the drop right down the throat. Dry the outside of the dropper first,
because if you touch the tongue, the bird will hate you forever because
of the taste. Force feeding is difficult with the larger parrots, and almost
impossible after they have had a taste of the concoction. This is where
SxT comes in. Powder up a tablet; get a piece of food that the parrot
likes (thin wedges of apple are particularly suitable); smear the apple, etc.
lightly with honey, then sprinkle the powder in the honey. Do this all
around the food item. Other food can be withdrawn and the medicated
food only given at about 12-hour intervals. In fact, it is better to feed it
more frequently and I tend to feed it ad lib., but use a system where you
are sure that the bird is eating the stuff at least every 12 hours.
As regards length of treatment, this should be four days minimum for
known force-fed dosing. On a self-feeding scheme, it is better to keep it
up for five to seven days. Even when a bird looks better, keep the treatment
going for two more days. No improvement by day three should dictate a
change of antibiotic, and change it again in two days if there is still no
response. I have on rare occasions had a good response to a third change
of antibiotic, but usually at that stage you are out of luck.
Finally a word on mixing antibiotics. It might be thought that if two
or more antibiotics are given simultaneously, most organisms would be
covered, but in practice this does not work as well as would be expected.
Groups of antibiotics can behave in three ways when mixed: first, there
may be no reaction at all between them; next, they may have an additive
effect--synergism--which will apply to certain organisms, while still
others antagonise one another. This may result in lowered effectiveness of

one or both components. In addition, the chances of toxicity are greater
(or unknown) in a mixture, so it is better to leave this approach alone.
Note that mixing means giving the antibiotics simultaneously. It may be
advantageous on some occasions to give two antibiotics alternately, a
few hours apart, to give a wider anti-bacterial cover and in serious cases
I often alternate a 6-hour antibiotic with a 12-hour one for the first two
days.
These rough and ready dosing methods can be quite effective. The secret
is practice and consistency. No dose must be missed at the appropriate
time interval or the treatment will be of little use. The information only
applies to the groups of antibiotics mentioned.
While these are only brief notes on a few compounds in a vast and
complicated field, it is hoped that they will at least move treatment from
wild guessing to rational guessing, for in most cases, that is as much as
we can do.

By J. Rens (Wassenaar, Holland)
Known in its native Philippine Islands as the Coleto, Sarcops calvus ,
the Bald Starling, is among the most remarkable of the family. According
to Du Pont (1971) it occurs in three subspecies and in March 1976
the Wassenaar Zoo acquired three specimens of the nominate race which
were exhibited in an aviary measuring 3 x 2 x 2.5 m within our bird
house known as the Louise Hall.
At the time of their arrival the birds were in poor condition and faeces
examination revealed that they were suffering from a heavy infestation
of Capillaria and this was successfully treated with a Piparizine solution.
The colour of the naked heads seemed to be a good indicator of the birds'
condition and some days after treatment the skin colour changed from
whitish to pink.
Like most starlings the sexes are similar in appearance, but two of the
three began attacking the third and so it was supposed that these two
might be a pair. We removed the attacked bird and installed two nest
boxes on the side wall of the aviary. As Coletos nest naturally in disused
nests of woodpeckers (Delacour and Mayr, 1946) we offered our birds
nest boxes measuring 15 x 15 x 40 cm. with an entrance hole diameter
of 6 cm. Immediately the birds started nest-building and on the 28th
April 1977 the first egg was laid, followed by a second and third on the
30th April and 2nd of May. The colour of the eggs was bluish.
Incubation started on the 2nd of May and both birds shared this task.
It was very difficult to observe the nesting, for every time we carefully
approached the aviary the brooding bird was alarmed by the calls made
by the other and immediately emerged from the nest.

J. RENS--NESTING OF THE BALD STARLING
On the 16th of May, after an incubation period of 14 days, two chicks
hatched; the third egg had disappeared. Large quantities of crickets and
other live insects were provided together with the normal diet of mixed
chopped fruit, meat, diced hard-boiled egg and insectile mixture. One
chick was found dead on the 23rd of May: the other thrived and left the
nest after 21 days on the yth of June.
At this time the parents began to construct another nest in the second
box about a metre from the first and now it appeared that they stopped
feeding the young one which was constantly trying to reach the nest box
by climbing and scrambling up the wire. Several times we put it back into
the nest, but the parents neglected it. As it had not begun to feed itself,
although it was of adult size and only differed from the parents by being
of a more greyish colour, we removed it from the aviary and hand-fed
it for the next two days, by which time it was able to feed itself.
Contrary to all expectations the young bird was found dead on the
20th June and examination revealed that it suffered from tape-worm
infestation.
During the next two months the parents nested twice, but all the young
died within a few days of hatching; naturally we are hopeful of success
during 1978.

Florisuga mellivora
By R. J. Elgar (Manchester)
Introduction
Many ornithological publications on South and Central America give
reference to female dimorphic plumage in F. mellivora , this being either
typical female plumage or females with varying amounts of male plumage.
Smithe (1966) writes "Most females are bronze green above, green and
white below and have a scaly looking throat; however they are sometimes
dressed much like males, about one fourth of them being dimorphic with
blue heads, white nape bands, white tail." Also Monroe (1968) "The
occurrence of females in a masculoid plumage is definitely evidence by
one specimen from San Alejo (18th March 1963). This individual is
externally a male differing from typical male specimens only in the
presence of scattered green feathers on the crown and in the more re-
stricted area of purple gorget." He sexed this individual carefully and
found the ovary beginning to enlarge with two ova distinctly larger than
the mass of small undeveloped ova. Furthermore Zimmer (1950) and Slud
(1964) make reference to female dimorphism in this species.
Distribution
F. m. mellivora ranges from Mexico south to Peru, Boliva and Brazil,
The nominate race is known almost throughout the range, including
Trinidad, ranging in reduced numbers from sea level into the lower
highlands to about 5,000 feet. Florisuga mellivora flabellifera is found only
in Tobago.
Description of male and typical female
Male 4^ to 4f inches; bill (straight and rather short) black: head and
chest cornflower blue, white patch on hind neck; otherwise shining
bronze-green above; breast and belly pure white; tail white, edged and
tipped black.
Typical female 4J inches; bill (slightly curved) black; shining bronze-
green above; throat and chest dusky, feathers edged white giving a scaled
effect; lower underparts white; tail dark green with broad black sub-
terminal band, sometimes tipped white.
Acquisition of dimorphic female
At the end of March 1973 I was fortunate to obtain what I thought to
be a juvenile male F. mellivora from a consignment a London dealer had
received from Ecuador. This bird was extremely fit and soon settled down

to life in my hummingbird flight which at the time contained ten other
medium and large hummingbirds of both sexes.
Description and moidt
Dimorphic female inches; bill (slightly curved) black, with juvenile
flesh-coloured gape: head and chest cornflower blue; rufous moustachial
streak; rest of upperparts bronze-green; small white patch on hind neck;
breast and lower underparts white except under tail-coverts black, tipped
white; tail white with central two feathers heavily tipped black.
Several weeks after its arrival it commenced its first moult in captivity
and to my surprise it began to lose the white patch on its hind neck. The
feathers of the head were replaced by bronze-green and the plumage of
the throat and breast were replaced with the scale-like feathers as in the
typical female. Over a period of 14 weeks this bird had externally changed
from what I thought to be a juvenile male into a typical female. Since the
first moult this female has moulted a total of five times, each taking
approximately 14 to 16 weeks, but always remaining in typical female
plumage.
Female Jacobin display
The female Jacobin began to display soon after its first moult in captivity
throughout 1973/74/75. It displayed to a female Green Violetear Colibri
thalassinus and a female Green-fronted Lancebill Doryfera ludoviciae only.
These displays were extremely aggressive and usually ended in a false
mating taking place. In early 1976 I had to remove my Long-billed
Starthroat Heliomaster longirostris to a flight cage because of aggressive
displays by the Stripe-breasted Starthroat Heliomaster squamosus who
then began displaying to the female Jacobin. I witnessed mating taking
place on several occasions throughout 1976/77. The female Jacobin would
also display to the starthroat to induce him to display. In display, she
would become very agitated, her plumage sleek and, while still perched,
would make exaggerated movements from side to side with head and
body. Then she would take flight with fast exaggerated wingbeat causing a
rapid clicking sound. After several seconds of this flight the Jacobin would
find the male starthroat. She would hover in front and slightly above him
at a distance of six or seven inches with back arched and tail fanned, with
jerking forward and downward movements to within an inch of the male
starthroat by closing her wings for a split second. She will usually do this
jerking movement between four and six times before flying off with
exaggerated wingbeat as mentioned earlier.
Nest-building and breeding activity
Like most captive female hummingbirds especially those housed in-
doors, the Jacobin seemed unable to complete a nest of her own but soon
accepted one made by me and began adding a small amount of cobweb

to the cotton-wool lining. Although she laid eggs throughout 1974 and
1975, they were always soft-shelled. It was not until late 1976 with the
introduction of "True Lite" fluorescent tubes that she started to lay hard-
shelled eggs, but I do not know if the "True Lite" was a factor in the
laying of hard-shelled eggs. In 1977 the Jacobin nested and laid three
times and on two occasions the eggs were fertile, but the embryo stopped
developing at about seven days. The Stripe-breasted Starthroat was prob-
ably the other parent. With the starthroat being of a different genus, this
may be a factor in the embryo dying.
Conclusion
Immature hummingbirds resemble the female, but for this bird to
moult from a somewhat male plumage into a typical female plumage seems
most unusual. When I acquired this bird I had only just started photo-
graphing my hummingbirds and unfortunately took only colour slides of
the moult. As they do not reproduce very well in black and white, I have
submitted a photograph of typical female plumage.

The purpose of this study is to re-evaluate current interpretation of
plumage morphology and display of the Sunbittern Eurypyga helias , and
is based on a review of published literature and observations of captive
birds made during several visits to the Bronx Zoological Garden, New
York, in January and February 1975 and elsewhere. This most interesting
bird is the sole member of the family Eurypygidae, the relationship of
which to other avian groups remains a puzzle despite much literature on
the subject. It is remarkable that this bird is commonly kept, and has
bred, in captivity and yet we know little more about it than has been
learnt from observations made in the wild. The Sunbittern occurs in
"tropical Central and South America from the Caribbean slopes of
Guatemala southward to south-central Peru, eastern Bolivia, and northern
and central Brazil, the southern limits being southern Goyaz and Piauhy"
(Riggs 1948) and southern Mexico (Davis 1972). It lives singly, or in
pairs, about forest streams and ponds.
The well known spectacular display of the Sunbittern has been repeated-
ly described (Newton 1899, Finn 1908, Pycraft 1931, Alexander 1936,
Rusby 1933, Stonor 1940, Armstrong 1942, Gilliard 1958, Skutch 1964,
Levi 1968, Muller 1975) but without convincing discussion of its signifi-
cance or origin; although several authors have inferred that it is used in
courtship (Finn 1908, Pycraft 1931, Levi 1968), while Stonor stated
(1940: 11-12) and Cott (1940: 218) implied that it is performed only in
threat. Direct evidence of a Sunbittern displaying in this fashion (Fig. iB)
to a member of the opposite sex in courtship appears to be lacking.
Authors have, however, noted the threatening character of the Sunbittern
display (Levi 1968, Muller 1975); and Stonor (1940: 11), repeated by
Armstrong (1942), made the important but apparently frequently over-
looked observation that the display is an intimidatory one and that the
wing coloration is adapted to this function by exhibiting "false eyes".
Observations
On my first visit to the Bronx Zoo I found a pair of Sunbitterns, in a
large "South American forest" exhibit of mixed neotropical birds, had
successfully bred and were attending a two week-old nestling (the age
being given to me by keepers) and an unhatched egg which lay on fairly
fresh leaves in the cup of a predominantly mud nest. Both parents brooded
and fed the young, one relieving the other on the nest without apparent
display or vocalisations. Parents brought food to the young in the tip of

the bill; they did not swallow food and subsequently regurgitate it. The
nestling did not beg-call or gape for food, but took it directly from a
parent*s bill tip.
The young bird was capable of moving confidently about the nest cup
and rim. To defecate, the nestling always clambered out of the nest cup
onto the rim and turned around to project its anus over the edge of the
nest. In this way excreta was always expelled clear of the nest cup and
inner rim (Fig. 2).
On my last visit to the Bronx Zoo the young Sunbittern was five weeks
old and had left the nest. Though still very much smaller than the adults
and apparently incapable of sustained flight, its primaries appearing less
than fully grown, it was quite agile in walking about the "forest" floor
both close to its parent(s) and alone, I was unable to make long observations
at this time but I was fortunate to note a most interesting interaction
between the young bird and an adult Common, or Blue-throated Piping
Guan Aburria pipile . The young Sunbittern, walking across a large log
spanning a stream, found itself confronted by the guan towering over it
less than half a metre away. After watching each other for a few seconds
the Sunbittern very suddenly fully opened and raised its wings and tail,
causing the guan to immediately take flight. The Sunbittern continued to
walk across the log. The display was very brief, but extremely effective,
and while the young bird did not achieve the full adult display posture
(with wings and tail completely vertical) it almost did so; the wing nearer
the guan being somewhat lower than the one farther away and the tail
fully fanned, but not fully raised to vertical. The spectacular, super-
ficially peacock-like display of the Sunbittern (hereafter referred to as
Frontal Display) was not seen performed by the parents. Other adult
individuals at the Bronx Zoo and in several other collections were, how-
ever, watched doing so as is discussed below.

DISCUSSION

<bodyText confidence="0.994287428571429" page_id="56386801"  page_num="151" year="" vol="">
The development and parental care of nestling Sunbitterns are peculiar
and of considerable interest. Chubb (1916) observed that young Sun-
bitterns differ from most young birds by immediately gaining adult plu-
mage without passing through an intermediate plumage. Equally unusual
is Bartlett's (1866) observation that although nestlings resemble precocial
downy chicks they are attended by both parents like altricial nestlings.
He also noted that nestlings did not gape or call but snapped food from
the parent's bill. Bartlett's observations have subsequently been repeated
in literature reviewing the Eurypygidae (Riggs 1948, Skutch 1964) as the
most complete account of the Sunbittern, with the reservation that the
behaviour of his captives in an artificial environment may have been
atypical. My observations of breeding captives in New York agree with
Bartlett's in that both parents brooded and fed the young and that th
nestling took food directly from the parent's bill without calling or gaping.

The spectacular Sunbittern display with fully opened and raised wings
and tail (Fig. iB) is well known, and is clearly illustrated photographically
in Pycraft (1914), Stonor (1940) and Gilliard (1958) from a picture by
Seth-Smith in which the bird is very obviously directing the display at
the photographer in threat. Finn (1908) and Pycraft (1931) considered
this Frontal Display to be used in courtship and Levi (1968) implies this
by referring to the bird "revealing the full pattern and colour to the mate".
It is noteworthy, however, that despite the considerable literature on
the Sunbittern, and the abundance of it in captivity, I can find no reference
to a courting bird performing this display to another. Moreover, my
personal experiences of displaying captives in collections in Europe and
in America always involved individuals that have been surprised by
another bird alighting nearby (observed at Rotterdam, London and
Chester Zoos and the Wildfowl Trust, Slimbridge), or by my sudden
approach or that of another person (observed often at the Wildfowl
Trust; Birdland, Bourton-on-the-Water; Bronx Zoo, New York and
San Diego Zoo, California). Indeed one bird that I approached quickly
at Slimbridge threatened by circling my legs and continuing the Frontal
Display while making short runs toward me and giving loud vocalisations.
An account by Rusby (1933) describes a wild Sunbittern running in
circles and leaping with one wing stretched upwards. A second bird was
not noted, however, and this odd performance apparently had nothing to
do with courtship. The display (?) could, however, have been directed at
Rusby himself.
In considering the function of the Frontal Display, it is pertinent to
examine the Sunbittern's plumage. The most striking fact is that both
sexes are identical in coloration and pattern. This would be an unusual
situation in a forest-dwelling bird in which the male supposedly performs
bizarre courtship postures to the (usually more soberly plumaged) female.
Moreover, the coloration of males in species that display in this fashion
nearly always contrasts strongly with their environment during display.
The Sunbittern is, however, sexually monomorphic and concealingly
coloured, and of particular significance in this respect is the fact that
nestlings immediately attain adult coloration in the first plumage.
To the human eye the Frontal Display of Sunbitterns (particularly in
captive artificial surroundings) is a colourful and attractive sight; and it is
possibly for this reason that a number of authors have considered it to be
so from the female Sunbittern's point of view. This is obviously not the
case, however, with other animals confronted by it such as the guan in
the instance recorded above, involving a mere five week-old Sunbittern
with inferior display. To small animals, the sudden appearance of a Sun-
bittern in Frontal Display in close proximity may be alarming and cause
an immediate escape response. The sudden change in appearance of the
Sunbittern from a skulking cryptic bird to a large threatening one is
similar to numerous well known examples of otherwise cryptic animals

that suddenly expose eye-spots, or ocelli, to potential predators as a means
of intimidatory defence (for a summary of some of these see Cott 1940).
In fact a Sunbittern suddenly performing the Frontal Display does not
merely change in appearance from a cryptic bird to a far larger threatening
one, but also suddenly exhibits a roughly circular area of contrasting
tones on each wing forming a huge pair of staring rudimentary "eyes"

therefore, not quite as well opened as in the Frontal Display). B. A simplified
schematic representation of the false eye marking.
Hingston (1933) has pointed out the intimidatory effect of actual verte-
brate eyes. As is well known, such eyes are commonly imitated by patterns
of pigmentation on numerous, usually otherwise cryptic, animals; par-
ticularly insects. Although not as well developed as in many insects (as,
for example, on the hind wings of some butterflies of the genus Caligo or
on the Eyed Hawk-moth Smerinthus ocellatus, as described and/or illus-
trated by Cott (1940)) a rudimentary eye-spot is conspicuous on each
wing of Sunbitterns. This is quite obvious on displaying birds or colour
photographs of them. Moreover, they are emphasized in black and white
pictures (see Pycraft 1914: 141, Stonor 1940: 5, and Gilliard 1958: 154)
in which the colour tones of the "eyes" fade progressively lighter toward
the highlight (formed by several white greater primary coverts), thus
giving them a slight three-dimensional effect (see Fig. 3B).
It is very interesting that Muller (1974, 1975) has recently described a

threat posture of the Old World Painted Snipe Rostratula benghalensis ,
(family Rostratulidae) that is extremely similar to the Sunbittern display,
and has pointed out the behaviourally convergent nature of this (see
Fig. iB and C). Muller used the descriptive term Frontal Display for the
painted snipe posture and, in view of the remarkable similarity in posture
to that of the Sunbittern, I have applied it also to the latter bird&amp;apos;s display.
The Old World Painted Snipe is sexually dimorphic, the female being
the more colourful bird, although the differences in plumage are not
great. Painted snipe (three species) have a peculiar breeding system in
which the brighter female takes the initiative in courtship and the duller
male performs nest-building and parental duties. Muller (1975) reviews
references to displaying painted snipe and points out that all direct
observations (Finn 1920, Baker 1921, D'Ombrain 1944, Lowe 1963,
Muller 1975) involved birds, of either sex, giving a threat or defensive
posture to an intruder or predator. Moreover, Bates and Lowther (1952)
describe young birds performing the Frontal Display and producing a
hissing noise, as do adults. Muller points out that several authors have,
however, also attributed this display to courtship (Finn 1920, Baker 1921,
Whistler 1949, Pitman 1964) but that these accounts appear to be based
on Finn's reference (1920) to a tale told to Mr. A. O. Hume by a "native".
It is remarkable, therefore, that the spectacular and well known Frontal
Displays of the Sunbittern and Old World Painted Snipe have been
repeatedly referred to as both threat and nuptial in function, although all
the evidence supports the conclusion that they are used only in threat or
defensive situations.
That both sexes of Sunbitterns gain the cryptic adult coloration, com-
plete with the eye-spot on each wing, with their very first plumage (unlike
most birds) suggests very strongly indeed that the coloration and Frontal
Display of the species have developed through natural selection and func-
tion as a defensive, or threat, mechanism which all individuals of the
species are able to utilise as soon as gaining feathers.
My observations of displaying birds, the published accounts of other
ornithologists, and the presence of rudimentary eye-spots on the otherwise
cryptic plumage of Sunbitterns, lead me to conclude that the Frontal
Display of the species is in fact defensive or intimidatory and not nuptial
in origin and that this should be the only function attributed to it until
such time as convincing evidence suggests otherwise. It is, of course,
possible that the static Frontal Display posture, which is often maintained
by a bird for some time after initially adopting it, may subsequently (in
evolutionary terms, through sexual selection) be incorporated into court-
ship sequences as aggressive display characters and vocalisations often
are (for a summary of many such cases, see Lorenz 1966).
Referring to the Sunbittern, Stonor (1940:11) simply stated without
comment or explanation that the Frontal Display "is only used to frighten,
and the courtship, in which both [sexes] take part, is quite simple and

involves no use of the wing pattern". Sunbittern courtship behaviour
apparently remains, however, undescribed. It is hoped this contribution
stimulates further studies of Sunbittern biology.

SUMMARY
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.991437333333333" page_id="56386806"  page_num="156" year="" vol="">
Plumage coloration of S unbitterns is typical of concealingly marked
animals which repel potential predators by a sudden enlargement of the
visible body area and exposure of false eyes. A relatively crude false eye
is located on each upper wing surface of Sunbitterns, attained with the
very first plumage in both sexes, and these are apparently effective in
deterring potential predators when suddenly exposed. This adaptive
coloration, and associated display posture, is considered the result of
natural selection. The Sunbittern's Frontal Display is intimidatory, not
epigamic, and this should be considered its only function until we have
convincing evidence to the contrary. The Sunbittern appears to be the
only bird at present considered to possess false eyes, crude though they
are, that have an intimidatory function. Recent observations of breeding
captive Sunbitterns suggest that previously published accounts of parental
care of captive Sunbitterns almost certainly involved normal behaviour
for the species.

much to the fine conditions in which birds are kept at the Bronx Zoo,
resulting in much breeding activity, without which studies of this kind
would be difficult. The Frank M. Chapman Memorial Fund, administered
by the American Museum of Natural History, provided funds for other
studies in New York without which I would have been unable to visit
that city; to those concerned I express my thanks.

CALLS AND DISPLAYS OF THE MALE BARE-THROATED
BELLBIRD

By Barbara K. Snow (Wingrave, Aylesbury, Bucks)
Of the four species of bellbird (Procnias, Cotingidae) inhabiting forests
in the neotropics, I have had the good fortune to study in the wild the
calls and epigamic displays of three species, Procnias averano , P. alba
and P. tricarunculata (Snow 1961, 1970, 1973, 1977). I* 1 these species
the male is polygamous and throughout each day, for most of the year,
advertises his presence from the same perches by loud calls and occasional
displays. The fourth species, native to Brazil, is the Bare-throated Bellbird
Procnias nudicollis. It is the only one commonly kept in zoos in this
country. The adult male of this species has entirely white plumage and
a bare throat, the skin of which is a bright bluish-green. The female and
the juvenile are olive green above and pale yellow streaked with olive
green below.
Two male Bare-throated Bellbirds were housed next to each other at
the London Zoo between autumn 1972 and June 1974, when the younger
bird was removed. Peter Olney (Curator of Birds, London Zoo) informs
me that when added to the collection in autumn 1972, one bird was in all
white plumage except for one or two juvenile body feathers, so was in its

third to fourth year: the other was in the green juvenile plumage but
shortly afterwards began moulting into partially white feathers so was
about one year old. This age assessment is from the study of museum
skins (Snow 1973) and the extrapolation of moulting data on Procnias
averano in the wild.
These two birds were watched from four to five hours on 8th June 1973
and 21 st February 1974. The remaining older bird was watched for
three hours on 5th March 1978. At the earlier visits some of the calls were
tape-recorded. By 8th June 1973 the older male was in fully adult plumage
and uttering three different advertising songs or calls. Two of these were
very loud calls; a monosyllabic 'bock' produced with a single very wide
opening of the beak and a repeated call in which, again, the beak is
opened very wide and just the lower mandible is moved with each repeated
note. Sonograms of both of these calls have been published in Snow 1973.
In addition, he uttered a third quiet call with about a quarter of the volume
of the other two; it also was a repeated call but delivered with the beak
only just open and the colourful skin of the throat pulsating with each
repeated note. Close to, I transcribed the call as 'quonk-quonk-quonk? etc.,
but at a distance in the forest it would probably sound like a creaking.
Sonograms of the quiet call show it to be similar in structure to the loud
repeat call with two sources of sound.
At my visit in March 1978 when the older bird had been caged without
sight or sound of another bellbird for three and a half years, I took my
original recordings to play back to him. His vocal response to play-back
was to utter a long series of quiet calls: this response was elicited at the
five different play-back tests.
On my first visit in June 1973, the immature male (c. one year six
months) was in the green juvenile plumage except for a few scattered white
or half-white feathers among the wing-coverts and on the back; the
lower breast and belly were also mainly white. On my second visit in
February 1974, his body plumage was generally white with scattered
green feathers and the tail was white. The wings were white except for
one or two green flight feathers at the junction of the primaries and
secondaries. The skin of the throat was greyish with a tinge of green.
On both visits the immature male was calling as persistently as the adult
male, but they were very imperfect calls. At the first visit the monosyllabic
bock usually sounded adult, but occasionally it lacked the normal abrupt
start to the call so sounded like a squawk. The repeat call was very shrill
and imperfect. Nothing resembling a quiet call was uttered at either visit.
At the second visit the bock sounded fully adult but the repeat call was
not yet like that of the adult, particularly in the lack of separation of
each note. Evidence from the other Procnias species shows that there is a
long period of practise before young males perfect their calls. Yet the
absence of even an attempt at the quiet call by the immature male after a
practising period of approximately a year and three months is surprising;

it is feasible that the learning bird needs to see as well as hear an adult
uttering the call. All other known calls of the four Procnias species except
the quiet call are uttered with the beak particularly wide open, so the
delivery of the quiet call with nearly closed beak is a deviation from the
usual practise of the genus; it has probably evolved to display the colourful
skin of the throat which is far less conspicuous when the beak is wide
open.
While the calls of bellbirds evidently need to be learnt, the displays
appear to be innate and those of the immature male were exactly similar
to the adult male's displays. At the first visit both males were displaying
with the immature displaying about ten times as frequently as the adult.
At the second visit only the immature male displayed. At the third visit
the lone adult male only displayed in response to play-back and once
in response to some feral pigeons landing on the frosted glass roof of his
cage.
There are two displays, a silent display jumping (Fig. 1) and a silent
head-jerking display (Fig. 2A and B) followed by a bock with a leap.
Before the display jump, the male assumed a horizontal body position
with the tail depressed (Fig. 1) and then jumped across to another perch

body position, then turned rapidly on the perch and jumped back again.
This was repeated silently a number of times. The three other bellbird
species either do a display jump between horizontal branches three to
four feet apart as in P. averano or a longer display flight between branches
seven to fifteen feet apart as in P. alba and P. tricarunculata. The crouched
horizontal body position is similar in all four species except that in the
three species observed in the wild, the males land from the display jump
or flight with the tail fanned. The Bare-throated Bellbird did not do so,
but this may have been due to the restrictions of its cage and the shortness
of its jump. However, two horizontal branches four feet apart, especially
added to its cage, were not utilised.
In the head-jerking display the body is in a horizontal position with the
tail cocked above the horizontal and the tips of the wings crossed. The

anal aperture is distended and conspicuous and the legs are well apart so
that a bare patch of skin on the side of the femur is displayed and the bird
leans over either its left or right leg. It may then do one of two things:
it either points its beak downwards (Fig. 2A) at the same time jerking or

shaking its head and occasionally tilting it to look upwards, or it twists
its head to look upwards and jerks it from this position (Fig. 2B). From
whichever position it adopts, it suddenly jumps or makes a thrusting
head movement in the opposite direction from which it has been leaning.
This jump or thrust is usually accompanied by a loud bock , the remainder

of the display being silent. If it jumps, it turns in the air to re-land on
the perch facing in the opposite direction.
Judging from the displays of the other three bellbirds, these are the
displays performed to a visiting bellbird either female or male, and the
jump with a loud bock is the mounting movement. The downward head-
jerk interspersed with looking up is a similar head movement to the silent
wattle-shaking display of P. tricarunculata, , suggesting that P. nudicollis
has evolved from a wattled progenitor. In P. tricarunculata the male
looks up at the visiting bellbird, in between bouts of silent wattle-shaking.
The display position of P. nudicollis leaning over right or left leg is seen
in P. alba , but the latter always leans over its right leg, the side on which
its single wattle hangs from the upper mandible, before thrusting or
jumping with a loud bell-like call towards a visitor on its left. A bare
thigh patch, conspicuous in the display of P. nudicollis , is also found in
P. averano , but not the other two species. When an adult male P. averano
is visited by another bellbird the thigh patch is displayed.
Evidence from the study of bellbirds in the wild indicates that young
males must have a model in order to learn the repertoire of their species.
So if young male Bare-throated Bellbirds, still in the immature green
plumage are being bought by aviculturists or added to zoo collections, a
record of their vocalisations would be of great interest.

Since the publication of my three-part paper on this subject (Boswall,
1977) further observations and references have come to light.
Borderline cases in wild and some captive birds
Writing under the heading "The apparent use of rocks by a Raven in
nest defense" Janes (1976) describes an incident he and a companion
experienced as they were climbing down a 20m cliff after inspecting an
occupied nest of Corvus corax in a cliff opening. "We started our descent
and were 4 and 6m below the nest when both ravens staged an extremely
vociferous attack approaching within 3m of us. The two birds then took
up positions on the cliff top 13m above us, still calling loudly. One bird
stationed itself at the top of the opening.
"As soon as we resumed our descent, a rock the size of a golf ball fell
past my face and landed next to my feet. We assumed that it had acci-
dentally been kicked loose by the raven. However, when we looked up, we
both saw a raven with a rock in its beak perched at the top of the opening
on the opposite side. With a slight flip of its head the raven tossed the
rock down and across the opening towards us. From what shelter we
could find, we watched the raven toss six more rocks from its position at
the cliff top. One of these rocks struck me on the lower leg. The largest
rock was 8 cm in diameter and 2.5 cm thick, and marks on it showed that
it had been partially buried.
"When we returned later that day to photograph this behaviour, the
ravens immediately flew at us and called. Again, one stationed itself in
the same place at the top of the opening, but apparently no more rocks
were available as only grit was thrown." This case is borderline in my
opinion because the behaviour could have been a displacement activity.
To the list of birds known to drop hard-shelled food items from a height
must be added three species. A free-flying but captive Raven (K. Lorenz,
personal communication and quoted by Lawick-Goodall, 1970) frequently
dropped bones in order to break them and so to feed on the marrow. The
Bald Eagle Haliaeetus leucocephalus (C. Bindner quoted by Lawick-
Goodall, 1970) has been seen to drop tortoises or turtles, and the Golden
Eagle Aquila chrysaetos to drop tortoises (Fischer et al. } 1976/77).
The Green Heron Butorides virescens that fished with bait (Sisson
1974) has been filmed by Paling (1978).
Lawick-Goodall (1970) also quotes a case observed by Kooij and van
Zon of two captive Crested Seriemas Cariama cristata that broke hens'
eggs by dropping them on to the ground. When presented with a lime egg
both birds first dropped it as usual and then carried it to an anvil and

dropped it on that. When this was unsuccessful a definite throwing move-
ment appeared for the first time. John Yealland wrote to me of a Crested
Seriema at the London Zoo that on being given a coin would take it to a
place on the concrete or to a branch lying on the concrete and throw
it down with considerable force. "We offered it molluscs (mussels if I
remember rightly)., dead mice and a small snake but it did not treat
any of them in this way.** The action "seemed a careful and precise aiming
and throwing. The bird certainly seemed to be trying to 'break open 5 the
coin**.
Lawick-Goodall (1970) describes some preliminary experiments with
captive seriemas. Two birds were presented successively with the egg of
an Ostrich Struthio camelus, a rhea, presumably Rhea americana, and a
goose. Both birds after pecking and clawing at the Ostrich egg picked up
one stone each. These were dropped on to the ground quite far from the
egg. During the second experiment (with a rhea's egg) one seriema
picked up a stone and threw it at the ground. On the third testing neither
bird picked up a stone but on the fourth and last testing, with the goose
egg, one bird picked up a stone, carried it to a large "anvil** rock and threw
its stone at it. It would be interesting to know whether wild seriemas open
rhea eggs in the wild after the manner of Egyptian Vultures Neophron
percnopterus breaking into Ostrich eggs.
To the list of birds that use anvils must be added the Blue Whistling
Thrush Myiophoneus coeruleus. Smythies (1953) says of its diet "hard
shells are a favourite item, and large heaps of fragments are often found
where the shells have been broken to pieces against a rock'*.
True tool-users in captivity
Peter J. Olney, Curator of Birds for the Zoological Society of London,
wrote of tool-using by an Oystercatcher Haematopus ostralegus. "I thought
you might be interested in an Oystercatcher we had here which con-
sistently used a lolly stick! This it held in its beak and inserted one end
into the cracks in the cement surrounding the pool, presumably to dislodge
food--probably invertebrates. I only actually once saw it catch an insect
which it managed to persuade to leave the crack. The bird had been
brought into the collection with an injured wing and seemed to develop
the habit after being here some years. Presumably the number of lolly
sticks is likely to be greater inside the Zoo than in its natural habitat!"
L. Gibson of New Westminster, British Columbia, Canada, wrote of a
tool-using Pekin Robin. "A 1974 aviary-bred Pekin Robin Leiothrix lutea
hen had been kept indoors all winter, along with a wild-caught bird. They
were released into a small planted flight on 15th April 1978. The birds
immediately began to bathe. The hen wet herself a little then flew up into
a vine (thought to be a species of Actinidia). This vine had soft new shoots
3-4 inches (7-10 cm.) long, with about six half-sprouted leaves. The hen
snapped off a shoot and began to scrub herself vigorously with it. The

shoot soon broke up and she continued to rub herself with smaller pieces
of leaf until it disintegrated. She repeated the whole procedure several
times. This action was not seen again and she bathes daily in the normal
manner. The cock bathes normally and never attempted to use a shoot.
Six years' close observation of Pekin Robins have not revealed the above
action by any other individuals. This particular hen never saw her parents
or any other birds do this, as far as I know. She has been under close
scrutiny since birth (and has never left the premises), and was seen to do
this for the first and only time at exactly four years of age."
James R. Reid (1978) gives an example of tool-use by the Rook Corvus
frugilegus. A young captive bird was observed inserting a plug into one of
six plug holes in an aviary in order that water from a constant source
accumulated on the aviary floor. This water was then used by all four
captive Rooks in the aviary for drinking and bathing.
In the earlier paper reference was made to a cockatoo that "would use
the empty shells of monkey nuts to scoop up water when this was too low
in its water-pot to be within reach of its beak". I commented that it was
not clear whether the bird used its foot or its beak but suggested that it
was more likely to have been the bird's foot. I am now glad to quote the
following comment from Derek Goodwin. "I think this would be re-
markable if it baled with the baler in the foot. I think I'm right in saying
that parrots do not pick up objects in their feet. They pick up an object
in the bill, then move the foot to the bill and grasp the object while the
bill manipulates (or billipulates) it. Mice and squirrels don't pick up food
in their paws either but always with the mouth, then sit back and bring
paws up to mouth to hold the food".
Campbell (1977) quotes a John Ronan of Co. Wexford, Eire, whose
23-year-old African Grey Parrot Psittacus erithacus holds a crust of bread
or a piece of bone in her claw and gently rubs her crown with it. The bird
also rubs the feathers on her neck "the wrong way up" from her back
towards the top of her head.
True tool-users in the wild
F. Duvall (personal communication, 1978) saw tool-using in three
instances by two different Common Crows Corvus brachyrhynchos in
North America in the fall of 1976. One was a wild bird, the other a free-
ranging bird hand-reared in captivity. The two behaved similarly. Each
held under its foot a nut of the scarlet oak Quercus rubra and then reached
for a stone which was then used as a hammer to smash the acorn.
A different kind of tool-use by the same species was induced in captive
birds by Powell and Kelly (1977). The following is taken from their
abstract:
"Four common crows ( Corvus brachyrhynchos ) were trained to peck a
key for food reward. When consistent responding developed, a metal
screen was placed over the response key so that the crow could still see

<bodyText confidence="0.995563395348837" page_id="56386815"  page_num="165" year="" vol="">
but could no longer peck the key. At the same time, a number of wooden
matchsticks, which could be used to operate the key, were placed in the
test chamber. The crows did not use the matchsticks as tools during 50
to 75 hours of exposure to this situation. Next, the crows were trained to
use the matchsticks as tools to operate the key. This was accomplished
by rewarding behaviors which came successively closer to the desired
response (shaping) for two of the crows. Shaping was ineffective for the
other two birds. However, these birds were successfully trained through
gradual changes in the position of a tool (metal rod) in the test chamber
(positional fading). Once tool using was established, the response readily
generalized to the use of other objects, such as nails and paper clips, as
tools. The crows also showed innovative behavior, in that they persistently
wedged the tool (matchstick) between the edge of the response panel and
the key, so that it acted as a lever. In this position, they had only to peck
the tool in order to operate the response key, which produced food more
rapidly and efficiently."
C. W. Benson kindly drew my attention to two additional published
references to Egyptian Vultures battering with stones eggs of the Ostrich.
In an article in the King William's Town (Cape Province) newspaper The
Kqffrarian Watchman (the issue of 7 October 1867) by "An Old Sports-
man" from Vitkyk, Namaqualand, there is a discussion of predation on
Ostrich nests (Skead, 1971). The key paragraph reads as follows: "But
what destroys the eggs most is the witte kraai (a vernacular name at that
time for the Egyptian Vulture). It will take a stone as large as a cup, and
let it fall on the eggs repeating this until he breaks some of them. I declare
positively that I have seen him do so. I know he does it often, as in most
old nests you will find a stone or two. It takes the stones from sometimes
as far as about three miles. I know this because he could not get the stone
nearer, being all sand. The bird will not come back to the nest if an egg
is broken."
The second record was quoted by Skinner (1972) from Lindblom
(1920, p. 329). The latter, writing of the natural history knowledge of the
Wakamba tribesmen of East Africa, wrote: ". . . certain birds of prey--
I have forgotten which--are said to be very keen on ostrich eggs. But as
they are often unable to peck a hole in them with their bills, they take
stones in their claws and let them drop on the eggs, thus cracking them..."
It seems very probable that the birds would have been Egyptian Vultures
and that they used not their feet but their bills.
In a later article, which I also overlooked, van Lawick-Goodall (1969)
describes some experiments with tool-using Egyptian Vultures and men-
tions that this behaviour was observed at Amboseli in Kenya and at
Oldvai Gorge in Tanzania as well as at the original site, the Ngorongoro
crater in Tanzania.

Tool-use by the Oystercatcher, Pekin Robin, Rook and Common Crow
raises the number of avian implement-wielders from 26 to 30.
The Oystercatcher was using a goad to find food and the Common
Crows a hammer to open food items and a lever to gain food in the experi-
mental situation. The Pekin Robin was clearly engaged in body care, but
quite what noun should be used to describe its cleaning utensil is difficult
to decide--"loofah" perhaps? The Rook was using what can only (and
scientifically) be described as a bath plug!

NOTES OF THE BIRDS OF UPERNAVIK,
NORTH-WEST GREENLAND
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.997159" page_id="56386817"  page_num="167" year="" vol="">
By Erling S. Andersen (Copenhagen, Denmark)
From July 1973 until October 1976, my family and I lived in Upernavik,
Greenland (72*47&amp;apos;N, 57*io&amp;apos;W), where I worked with the local administra-
tion. Upernavik district, which is the northernmost district on the west
coast, stretches out for nearly 300 km, from south to north, but is quite
narrow, being bordered by the ice cap and Baffin Bay, The whole district
is, in fact, one big archipelago with a mass of large and small islands,
and it is very rocky. The population amounts to approximately 2,000
people, 800 of these in Upernavik town and the rest spread out over ten
settlements. The main occupation of the population is still seal- and
bird-hunting, as well as a little fishing.
The climate is low arctic and there is complete darkness in November
and December: on the other hand, there is midnight sun from June until
August. Common winter temperatures are minus 20-25*C and in the
summer plus 5-1 o*C. The sea is icebound from November/December
until the end of April, and snow covers the ground far into June. In
most places, the vegetation is very sparse, with creeping arctic willows
Salix sp. and other low herbs. Only in the bottoms of the fiords is the
vegetation more luxuriant.
The animal life is predominantly marine in character, with only a
handful of terrestrial birds and mammals. However, the animal life in
the sea is very rich, in respect to both the number of species and the
number of individuals.
After this brief description of the country and the climate, I shall
mention the various bird species in more detail.
Divers Gavia sp. are not particularly numerous around Upernavik and
I have seen only about 10-15 birds. Most of them have been high-flying
birds and I have been able to recognize three of them, all Red-throated
Divers Gavia stellata. I have not been lucky enough to see the Great
Northern Diver Gavia immer , although it has been seen by others.
The Cormorant Phalacrocorax carbo is now a rather common bird in
the district, since the introduction of a closed season (this is at present
from the 1st April until the 30th September). The Cormorant is con-
sidered by the Greenlanders to be a delicacy.
The Fulmar Fulmarus glacialis is very numerous and can be seen
everywhere.
The Eider Somateria mollissima is a common breeding bird, though
formerly it was far more abundant. Its decrease is due first and foremost
to hunting, both inside and outside the breeding season, but also to the
collecting of the eggs. Now the latter has been prohibited, just as it is
protected on or near the breeding islands. In Denmark, I have seen how
ringers caught brooding females on the nest with a big "butterfly" net.

This can be done because the Eiders, as is well known, are very tight
sitters. I decided to catch Eiders in the same way in Greenland, but
unsuccessfully. Brooding Eiders up there are far more shy than in Europe
and take off at a distance of 20-30 m. The Eider is of great economic
importance to the Greenlanders, and about 150,000 birds are shot annually
in the whole of Greenland.
The King Eider Somateria spectabilis does not breed in the district,
but non-breeding birds are immensely numerous and can be seen in
their thousands. King Eiders use a large stretch of the west coast of
Greenland as a moulting area, arriving from arctic Canada and northern
Greenland at the end of July. Unfortunately one does not often see the
males in their nuptial plumage as they have usually started to moult
before they arrive.
The Long-tailed Duck Clangula hyemalis is a common, but not very
numerous breeding bird. On the 29th July 1975 ,1 found a nest (with five
eggs) sparsely lined with down, on a small island. The eggs looked like
smaller editions of Eider eggs. The Red-breasted Merganser Mergus
serrator seems to be a rather rare bird. I saw only 2-4 birds in June 1974.
In the autumn the Gyr Falcon Falco rusticolus is quite often seen in
Upernavik town, no doubt attracted by the many Snow Buntings
Plectrophenax nivalis living there. The Gyr Falcon is totally protected in
Greenland, and not even Arabian oil sheiks are allowed to export any for
hunting purposes. All the birds that I observed belonged to the white
subspecies candicans.
The Rock Ptarmigan Lagopus mutus is the only gallinaceous bird in
Greenland and a common breeding bird near Upernavik. Furthermore,
it is, together with the Raven Corvus corax , the only wintering species.
Interestingly enough, it is always only the cocks that stay in the winter.
I have examined the stomach contents of 26 Rock Ptarmigan shot in the
winter, and they consisted exclusively of leaves and twigs of crowberry
Empetrum nigrum. On the 6th July 1974, together with members of the
Aberdeen University Expedition, I found a nest with three eggs on the
island Nor do. The nest was placed completely uncovered, in the low
heathlike vegetation. Ptarmigan are mostly very trusting and can be
watched at a distance of a few metres. They are shot in great numbers.
Ringed Plover Charadrius hiaticula , Turnstone Arenaria inter pres and
Knot Calidris canutus. None of these species breeds in the district and I
have seen only the Turnstone regularly, on migration. But for some
reason, all three species appeared in great numbers from late May to the
middle of June 1974. One met with large and small flocks everywhere.
They even came into town to feed at puddles, etc. The reason for this
mass occurrence, should no doubt be sought in the climatic conditions.
I saw one Purple Sandpiper Calidris maritima on the 4th August 1974.
Skuas Stercorarius sp. The Arctic Skua Stercorarius parasiticus breeds
in a locality in the southern part of the district, but I never saw it. I saw

the Pomarine Skua Stercorarius pomarinus on migration twice in 1976
and the Long-tailed Skua Stercorarius longicaudus once, also in 1976.
The Great Black-backed Gull Lotus marinus is a common breeding
bird in southern Greenland and seems to be spreading northward these
days. I saw two adult birds near Upernavik, one on the 18th May 1975,
and another on the 4th June 1976.
The Glaucous Gull Lotus hyperboreus is another common breeding
bird. It breeds in single pairs or a few pairs together, on small islands, and
on steep rocks, not in large colonies. In southern Greenland, where it
lives together with the Great Black-backed Gull, the two species are
presumed to compete. The Iceland Gull Larus glaucoides is also breeding
in the district, but I have never identified it with certainty.
The Kittiwake Rissa tridactyla is a common and numerous breeding
bird, mostly breeding in colonies of Briinnich's Guillemot Uria lomvia.
Arctic Tern Sterna paradisaea. In the neighbourhood of Upernavik,
there are four or five colonies with 50-100 pairs each. Holm Joensen and
Preuss (1972, meddelelser om grdnland, vol. 191, no. 5) maintain that
the Arctic Terns in Upernavik district should be less aggressive than, say,
in southern Greenland and Denmark, but I have, through painful ex-
perience, found them to be exactly as aggressive as terns in Denmark.
The Razorbill Alca torda is a common, though not very numerous,
breeding bird. Usually it breeds together with Brunnich's Guillemots or
Puffins Fratercula arctica .
The Little Auk Plautus alle is common on migration in the autumn. It
breeds (a few thousand pairs) on the island Horse Head farther north
in the district. I have seen it near Upernavik twice in the summer, one
bird on the 6th July 1974, and two on the 14th June 1975.
Brunnich's Guillemot is a very numerous breeding bird and the most
important game bird in the district. Fifteen km south of Upernavik, there
is a colony with 10-15,000 pairs, and a little farther away several colonies
of the same size or a little smaller. On the island Kap Shackleton, the
biggest colony in Greenland is found, with about a million pairs.
Brunnich's Guillemot has no closed season and, although protected, it is
often shot quite close to the breeding sites (shooting is prohibited within
two km of the breeding cliffs). Furthermore, the eggs are collected for
human consumption. Altogether it is easy to understand that the species
has declined much in the past few years, especially close to inhabited areas.
It is magnificent to sail below a cliff and see the endless rows of guille-
mots sitting on the ledges. Early one morning in August, I saw how the
parent birds swam away from the cliff accompanied by the half-grown
chicks, which the same night had jumped from the ledges.
The Black Guillemot Cepphus grylle is also very numerous. In contrast
to Brunnich's Guillemot, it does not breed in large colonies. At the most
a few hundred pairs together, but usually with 10-50 pairs in a colony,
and sometimes single pairs. In one place, they nest up to 100 m above

sea-level, but usually much lower. Although numerous, it is not of im-
portance as a game bird, because of its small size compared to Briinnich's
Guillemots and Eiders.
The Puffin Fratercula arctica is a quite common breeding bird, which
has increased in numbers in recent decades. This is due to its being now
totally protected, while earlier both its meat and eggs were utilised.
The Raven Corvus corax is also a common breeding bird and, as
mentioned above, one of the two wintering species. It seems to prey
upon the eggs and young of other birds. Thus, on one island, I found
the remains of lots of Eiders' and terns' eggs, and at another place, the
remains of several big chicks of Black Guillemot. In consequence of this,
2 d.kr. are paid in reward for each Raven killed.
Wheatear Oenanthe oenanthe. I saw one bird on 28th August 1976.
The Redpoll Acanthis flammea occurs in Greenland in two subspecies,
the Greenland Redpoll A.f. rostrata and the Arctic Redpoll A.f. home -
manni , by many considered to be two distinct species. The Greenland
Redpoll reaches its northern limit in the southern part of Upernavik
district and does not breed in the vicinity of the town. From I7th-28th
May 1975, however, a pair was seen daily, the male often in song flight.
The Arctic Redpoll, a most hardy little bird, which winters even in
the high arctic region, appeared in great numbers in Upernavik town
from 21st September 1976 and at least until the 1st October, when we
left the town: up to 100 birds could be seen during these days. On the
25th September, two rostrata joined the flocks and comparisons between
the plumages of the two subspecies could be made. The Arctic Redpoll
with its delicate white, grey, rose-pink and black colours, is a most hand-
some bird, far more beautiful than the "ordinary" Redpolls. I would
have liked very much to bring a pair or two back with me to Denmark.
Lapland Bunting Calcarius lapponicus. I ringed an adult female in
Upernavik on the 23rd September 1974 and saw another in the same place
on the 21 st September 1976.
The Snow Bunting Plectrophenax nivalis is the most common and
numerous bird in Greenland, which, in the towns, behaves as the House
Sparrow Passer domesticus in Europe. It is an early sign of spring, and its
song is very enlivening after a long and dark winter. I made a feeding
station on the veranda of my house and fed them with Budgerigar seed.
This attracted lots of Snow Buntings, and in a little trap of chicken wire,
I caught 608 birds from 1974-76. Of these, one was recovered two years
later in Upernavik. Besides this, I recaptured 31 birds after one year,
and nine birds two years after being ringed, all at the place of ringing.
As is well known, they had spent the intervening winters on the plains
of the U.S.A. and Canada.
For a while one of my friends kept a male in captivity, in a big cage
in the kitchen. It soon settled down and behaved as a perfect cage bird.
Eventually it was turned loose.

By U. S. Seal and J. M. Olsen (Minnesota Zoological Garden, Mn.
U.S.A.)
Present days zoos and private breeders face the task of establishing and
maintaining multigeneration, self-reproducing populations of captive wild
species. In some instances these captive populations provide the only
reservoir for species on the verge of extinction or already extinct in the
wild. The greatly reduced availability of wild birds has resulted in an
increased interest in sustained captive breeding programmes. Considering
that perhaps 700-800 species of wild birds are being bred in captivity
and that these are dispersed among perhaps 10,000 or more breeders,
and that replacements are increasingly difficult to obtain, then there is
an obvious need for minimum record keeping standards and a means of
pooling, collating and sharing basic data for captive population manage-
ment of each species or subspecies. This is a challenge with high stakes
including the complete loss of species when they become extinct in the
wild.
The International Species Inventory System (ISIS) was initiated by
the AAZPA and AAZV in 1974 to collect, analyse and disseminate in a
usable form, census and vital statistics data on wild species held in captivity.
Such data are considered essential if the hazards of fortuitous losses of
species and of loss of genetic variability are to be avoided in working with
dispersed, small captive populations. The ISIS programme provides a
convenient and participant-oriented record system designed for manual
and computer use. The reports are designed to provide useful information
for local management as well as interesting biological information on the
species.
Participants are provided annually with three reports. The participant
Inventory Report is a complete and detailed listing by species of the
inventory of the individual participant. The Acquisition/Release Report
is a similarly arranged report itemising all changes in the collection during
the year. The ISIS Species Distribution Report is a summary by species
of all specimens recorded in ISIS and provides an overall picture of the
status of the species in captivity. All participants holding a given species
and the age and sex composition of their holdings are listed, followed by
tables on age and sex structure, mortality, births and other acquisition
and release information. Similar summaries are provided at the level of
genus, family and order. The report for 1977 was 2,400 pages long and is
provided in its entirety only in microfiche. Individual portions are available
in hard copy.
Participants are also provided with a set of directories. The isis insti-
tution procedures describes the methods for recording and submitting
data to ISIS. The isis world geographic and zoological institution

directory provides a hierarchical listing of geopolitical divisions of the
world, including a listing of organisations and individuals holding wild
animals in captivity. The isis avian taxonomic directories use a hierar-
chical taxonomic coding system assigning unique numbers to each
taxonomic group.
Data are submitted for each individual animal on forms provided by
ISIS (Fig. 1). The data reported include species and participant identifica-
tion, identification numbers of parents (if known) and source of the animal
if not bora in the collection. A form is also completed when the animal is
removed from the collection, whatever the cause--whether sale, donation
or death. If sent elsewhere, this is indicated so that a linkage is provided
for tracing the animal throughout its life.
The census and vital statistics data system described has been opera-
tional for mammals for three years and was expanded to include the birds
in 1976. As of the end of 1977 ISIS had information on 13,172 living birds,
1,577 live hatchings and 1,226 deaths. It is anticipated that information
on approximately 30,000 birds will be included by the end of 1978.
We have recently added a pedigree/demography system for providing
the analyses and outputs of interest for genetic and demographic manage-
ment. This system includes studbook reports with the data organised by
animal I.D. number, by parents and by owner. Basic data reports pro-
viding such information as seasonality of births and deaths, birth sex
ratios and life tables can be provided in a simple graphic form. Population
history reports provide graphs showing the size of captive population by
year with sources of new acquisitions in terms of wild-born, captive-born
F-i and F-2 animals for each year. Genetic analysis reports will include
calculated inbreeding coefficients for all individuals in the species and
statistical analysis to search for effects of inbreeding on longevity and
fecundity. There is also the possibility of a report with choices for matings
based on calculations of projected inbreeding coefficients. Demographic
reports will provide information on whether a population is growing and
at what rate and will allow projections of future population sizes and sex
ratios and age structure. Further analyses of data can be developed as
needs are identified. It will be possible with such a computer-based model
to test the effects of proposed strategies for removal of animals from the
breeding population.
All operating costs for the programme are provided by the participants
in the form of fees calculated at the rate of $1.00 per living animal in the
participant's reported inventory at the end of each calendar year or
$100.00 minimum if fewer than 100 specimens are included. The $100.00
minimum fee reflects our experience with the cost of providing manuals,
forms and reports.

After nearly 40 years the Berlin Zoo is keeping Capercaillies again. In
January 1978, we bought one young cock and two hens of this beautiful
representative of the Tetraonidae from a private breeder in Sweden, and
after quarantine; the three were moved into an outdoor aviary (6 x 5 x
2.20 m) situated in an undisturbed corner of the zoo. The cage has a
natural forest floor which we change each two months. Pine trees give
not only protection, for the birds also like to eat the foliage of this
conifer, so we have to renew the pines twice a month. The birds' diet
consists of equal parts of barley, maize and wheat. In addition they get a
high quality softbill food, dried bilberries, fresh and dried heather as
well as whole apples, from which the Capercaillies peck out pieces.
In April the cock started courtship and three weeks later the hens began
to lay. The 12 eggs were put into an electric incubator. Because of the

NOTES FROM THE ST. LOUIS ZOO
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.99707575" page_id="56386825"  page_num="175" year="" vol="">
By Stephen R. Wylie (Curator of Birds)
Our bird collection's 1977 breeding season was less successful than
that of 1976. However, the percentages of fertility, hatchability and rearing
were higher, even though fewer eggs were laid. The unusually harsh winter
and the late arrival of spring to the St. Louis area no doubt contributed to
the decline of egg production and adversely influenced the number of
producing species. For the first time in several years, normally cold-hardy
specimens were confined to the protection of indoor quarters, not to be
returned to outdoor exhibits until mid-to late April. In spite of this delay
we reared large numbers of waterfowl species such as Ashy-headed
Goose; Sharp-winged, Argentine Cinnamon, Marbled and Ringed Teal;
and Radjah and Ruddy Shelduck. Crane production was extremely poor,
our success limited to one Eastern Crowned and one Stanley Crane.
Satyr Tragopans, Malay Crested Firebacks and Germain's Peacock
Pheasants were among the galliforms reared. We raised 11 Ostrich, but
failed in our attempts to rear a lone cassowary chick.
Remodelling of the penguin exhibits in 1976 included the installation
of timers that control photoperiods. As a result, the breeding and moulting
cycles of the King Penguins are now regulated and synchronised, reflecting
their cycles under natural conditions. Consequently, the hatching and
successful rearing of a King Penguin chick in our Aquatic House coin-
cided with that of individuals in an Antarctic-based colony.
Plans are now being formalised to renovate our Bird House, a structure
built in the early 1930's. The project, scheduled to begin in early fall of
1978, will reduce the number of exhibits while expanding the size of
each display. The use of high tension wire, commonly known as harp or
piano wire, will separate exhibit and public spaces. Its adoption will
result in optimum visibility and the feeling of free flight.

During the past two or three years, more breeding successes with
hanging parrots have been reported than probably all those of previous
years. One successful breeder of the Blue-crowned Loriculus galgulus is
K. Wardle of Helston, Cornwall. He keeps two pairs in a mixed collection
of seed-eaters. One pair reared three chicks in August 1977 and, at the
time of writing (April 1978), were rearing two more. The non-breeding
female helped to feed the 1977 young in the nest, after they were two
weeks old. Often both hens would be in the nest box at the same time and
both were soiled around the beak, due to feeding the chicks. After they
fledged, both males would feed the young. The 1977 birds were still in
the aviary when the parents bred for the second time, and all existed
together amicably.

A RE-APPRAISAL OF AWARDS FOR FIRST BREEDINGS
When the Avicultural Society was formed, nearly a century ago, the
keeping of birds under controlled conditions in aviaries was a new idea.
For many people aviculture was (as it is for some to-day) a matter of
buying birds, losing them soon afterwards, and buying some more. To
encourage not merely keeping birds alive for a while but persuading them
to breed and possibly to establish captive populations, the Council of the
Avicultural Society established an award, a medal, for the first breeding
of any particular species in Britain.
From the start this created problems, both with accepting claims that
breeding had occurred and with establishing the identity of the species
concerned; but with a small membership within a relatively circum-
scribed area these were not insuperable difficulties. The only major
problem that seems to have occurred concerning first breedings was
with the passing of the early Bird Protection Acts in Britain, which
resulted in a large number of dubious claims for the captive breeding of
native species. Dr. E. Hopkinson, who had attempted to record and collate
the occurrence of first breedings, finally abandoned the inclusion of native
species because of this.
However, the efforts of the members of the Society to breed birds under
controlled conditions were enormously successful, as attested by the
accounts of breedings appearing in the Magazine and by the compiled
lists which have been published. I think that the objective which the
medals were intended to promote has now been achieved. We have now
reached a stage where, for a first breeding to occur, the bird is likely to
be rare or hitherto unobtainable or to have such specialised requirements
that to supply suitable conditions for breeding lies outside the capacity
of the ordinary Society member.
I believe, and discussion with others in the Society confirms my belief,
that we have reached a stage where we should stop and rethink our policy
on the issuing of medals. I personally think that this concept of a medal is
both obsolete and unfair to many of our members. I would propose that
the Society should abandon the issuing of medals and I think that the
following points support this idea.

1. For a first breeding it is now usually necessary to obtain a rare bird,
or one that does not survive or breed well in captivity, and this encourages
a trade in such species at a time when there are strong international pres-
sures for more effective conservation of species and control of traffic in live
individuals. The Society should be taking a responsible attitude in sup-
porting these, and not appear to be working against them.
2. The problem of obtaining such birds, which are likely to be scarce
and very expensive, debars the majority of members of the Society from
participation and nullifies the intentions behind the scheme for issuing
medals to encourage breedings.
3. The majority of our present members are living outside the British
Isles and have never been able to qualify for the medals which their
subscriptions are financing.
4. The issuing of a medal by the Society has been claimed as an authori-
tative validation of the breeding of a species in captivity. Since the Society
has never had any way of monitoring the breedings and does not have
the facilities or finance for setting one up at the present time, this is not,
and never has been, a function of the Society. This is particularly relevant
since new legislation has produced an increased interest in the availability
of native bird species and the Society's officers may find themselves
unfairly involved in claims and counterclaims concerning the alleged
breeding of such species.
5. The preparation and issuing of medals involves the Society in work
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.995893863636364" page_id="56386828"  page_num="178" year="" vol="">
and costs which create an unnecessary burden on the finances at a critical
period in its history.
In summary then, the issuing of medals for first breedings creates
undesirable pressures on the taking of birds from the wild, and is an
activity from which the majority of members are debarred by circum-
stances. It involves the Society and its officers in alleged validation of
breedings which they are not in a position to monitor, and it burdens the
Society with work and costs which it is becoming increasingly difficult
to maintain and justify. In these circumstances I think it right to suggest
that the time has come for the Avicultural Society to cease issuing either
medals or certificates for apparent first breedings of species in captivity in
Britain.
One may then ask what incentive there is for anyone to attempt to
breed birds under controlled conditions. I think it is fair to say that
although an individual may derive considerable pleasure from possessing
a medal, the real worth of the breeding lies in the information about the
needs of the birds and the conditions necessary for success which the
member has obtained during the event, and the extent to which he or
she has made this information available through the published
account of the success, and so helped others to achieve the same
results. I would suggest that from the Society's point of view the medal
was always the incentive held out to ensure the production of a written

account, and for this reason insistence on an adequate description of the
breeding has been written into the rules. It is this written account which
matters and which should constitute the Society's recognition of the
event, even if it is thought desirable to add a brief editorial congratulation
to the author on an apparent first success.
In addition I would suggest that we have placed undue emphasis on
the single first breeding. I think some are pure flukes and that the really
noteworthy and creditable success which we should applaud is that where
breedings can be shown to have taken place not once but repeatedly, and
preferably involving several generations of individuals. If we believe that
captive breeding is important then let us recognise the major achievement
and not reserve our congratulations for a momentary success in one
country.
The real success of the Avicultural Society, or any other society of bird
keepers, lies in the extent to which its members pool their knowledge in
order to help each other achieve greater success and greater enjoyment.
If such an organisation merely provides a stage for those who wish to
achieve temporary competitive status at the expense of their fellows, then
it has failed.

INCIDENTS CONCERNING A CALIFORNIAN QUAIL AND A MALLARD
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.997576111111111" page_id="56386829"  page_num="179" year="" vol="">
The following two occurrences strike me as being unusual and I
wonder if they are of sufficient general interest for inclusion in the
Correspondence pages.
I have been keeping and breeding Californian Quail Lophortyx cali-
fornica since 1968 and have always been surprised at the complete lack of
interest shown by the adult birds in any form of live food; this is in con-
trast to the behaviour of all other Galliformes with which I am acquainted.
Californian Quail chicks will readily accept earwigs and the like when
attention is drawn to such food items by a bantam foster parent, but
lose interest later on. However, this year I have a pair breeding in an
aviary shared with a pair of Chinese Painted Quail Coturnix chinensis.
The latter are given a few mealworms every day and the cock always
gives them to the hen, rarely eating one himself. Recently I have noticed
the Californian hen competing for the mealworms proffered by the tid-
bitting cock Painted Quail: the Californian male shows no interest and
the two quail hens eat all the mealworms provided. This response to a
tidbitting male of another species is curious, as not only does the Cali-
fornian Quail lack a tidbitting ritual, but these particular quail were

ence of a tidbitting foster mother.
The second incident is of physiological rather than ethological interest.
A Mallard duck in my possession hatched 15 ducklings on the 20th April.
A week later she laid an egg and today (April 29th) she laid again, ap-
parently commencing a second clutch while continuing to be an excellent
mother to her brood.

The Jurong Bird Park, Singapore, has attempted to breed the Great Pied
Hornbill Buceros bicornis ever since a compatible pair was put into one of
the aviaries in 1975 and the pair nested on a few occasions, but no eggs
were ever hatched. On the 28th December 1977 the female entered the
nesting box and by the 30th the entrance hole was completely sealed,
leaving a slit through which she was fed by the male. The keepers bored a
hole in the side of the box so that events inside could be observed and on
the 1st January 1978 it was seen that an egg had been laid. On the 9th
February a young one was observed, so it could be concluded that the
incubation period of the Great Pied Hornbill was 40 days. Observations
during the nesting period were made as frequently as possible so that the
behaviour could be recorded.
The female left the nest in the afternoon of the 19th April after a sealed-
in period of 112 days and contrary to the literature on the Bucerotidae,
she came out with her plumage unchanged, for we had expected that she
would undergo the moult during her time in the nest. Her plumage was
dirty but she had not moulted and this was verified by examination of the
nest for moulted feathers, but there were none. The female appeared thin,
but otherwise healthy and she was re-united with her mate without
much ado.
The young hornbill left the nest on the 15th May at the age of 95 days
and it was fully feathered, an exact replica of the parents but for being
smaller and without the casque.
The hornbills were housed in an aviary measuring 6.5 x 10.8 x 3.5 m
and the nest box was made from planks with the nest entrance about 30 cm
from the base. The box was placed, as can be seen in the diagram, on a
raised platform and was situated in a corner of the aviary which was thickly
planted with bamboo Bambusa tulda , yam plants Alocasia indica , tapioca
plants Manihot utilissima, "tea-leaves" plant Acalypha siamensis , fern
Nephrolepis exaltata and buffalo grass Paspalum conjugatum. The nesting
materials consisted of clay, small twigs and the birds* own faecal material.
The hornbills are fed on a variety of fruits together with minced meat

twice daily and when the chick was hatched this diet was supplemented
with mealworms which we found to be the main food item of the young
bird, the mealworms being taken to the female by her mate, of course, and
fed by her to the chick. As might be expected, his visits to the nest with
food increased in frequency when the young one was hatched.
We did not observe any elaborate courtship behaviour, but before the
female was sealed in it was noticed that there was increased vocalisation,
mutual feeding and general restlessness. Both male and female carried out
the task of sealing the nest entrance with clay and mud (supplied by the
keeper) together with a mixture of saliva, mashed papaya and faecal

approximately three days to complete the task.
Through the observation hole it could be seen that the nestling crouched
between the legs of its mother; at this time only brief observations were
made for fear that the mother might be disturbed and trample on the
chick, but it was noticed early that the bill of the young one, which was

we were able to examine the young bird more closely. In length it was
approximately 61 cm. The bill was yellow with tinges of red at the sides.
The eyelashes were well formed and the black rictal bristles too. The
frontal area was reddish, but the casque was, of course, not developed. The
occipital region was feathered and black; the throat, neck and back were
not feathered, but the rectrices had grown to about 3.81 cm and were white
while the well developed wings were black. The irides were white and the
feet yellow. During this examination the young bird was very aggressive,
emitting loud guttural sounds and assuming a threatening posture with
open beak while the parents (especially the male) objected with loud calls.
The nest entrance was resealed by both parents. At the time of writing this
(early July) the young bird is 148 days old and the casque formation is
beginning to show. The parents still respond to the young one's food-
begging, though it is now almost as large as themselves.

The Hunting Cissa Cissa chinensis is a fairly wide ranging species with a
distribution from the Indian lower Himalayas eastwards through Assam
to northern Laos, Tonkin and Annam and south to Tenasserim, the Malay
States, Sumatra and north-western Borneo (Goodwin 1976). It is a medium
sized corvid, basically bright green in colour with contrasting red bill, legs
and feet. A broad black stripe on the side of the head from bill to nape.
Wings are chestnut with the innermost secondaries having pale greenish-
white tips preceded by black, making a bold pattern, and the tail feathers
are also tipped greenish-white with sub-terminal black bars on all but the
central ones. Irides and orbital skin reddish. The sexes are alike in ap-
pearance.
Our two birds were obtained in February 1970 as part of the initial stock
for the gardens and were housed in an indoor flight for the first three years
before being moved to their present outdoor quarters. The flight backs onto
a Cornish stone wall and measures 4x3x2m high with a raised shelter
adjoining. Shrubbery consists of a medium Leycesteria and a small
sycamore tree. A fuchsia also grows through the wire from outside provid-
ing additional cover. The diet fed to most of our corvids is given, but less
fruit is accepted, preference being given to day old chicks, mice, insectile
mixture and a little grain. Live food is always relished in practically most
forms, woodlice being the exception.

blue colour which many Hunting Cissas fade to in captivity, and while
looking fit, lacked that certain something. It was not difficult to see the
difference once the moult was completed; both were bright green in
colour and of tighter feather, giving them a sleeker appearance, and they
were much more active and vocal. The first indication they might be a pair
occurred in June 1977 when one was seen to crouch in mating position in
the presence of the other, but it evoked no response and it was not until
March this year when one fed the other that we were reasonably sure they
were a pair. No display has been witnessed to date.
While the flight contained some dense cover, most of it was rather low, so
fir branches were placed in one corner as near to the roof as possible to
provide a suitable site for nesting. Hessian sacks were placed between the
wire-netting and perspex cover to darken the area as it seems evident that
Hunting Cissas shun bright light, spending the most of sunny days deep
in cover, only venturing out in subdued light. The first sign of activity was
on May 25th when one (sex unknown) was seen with a piece of pine
needle and later when the fir was checked, a deep, neatly formed nest was
found made entirely of pine needles. No bird had been seen near the area
and as the weather had been fairly bright, it is presumed most of the
building took place in the early morning or late evening.
The first egg appeared on May 30th and for the first time one was
observed on the nest where she (?) remained for rest of the day. Over the
next eight days one bird was always present and it was not until that even-
ing the eggs were left unattended for the first time. A quick check revealed
five greenish-buff eggs speckled heavily with grey and some brown. First
sign of hatching occurred on June 20th when two shells were found mid-
morning, indicating incubation started with the second egg, making a
duration of 20 days. Two more shells were found, one on each of the
following two mornings, both deposited in the same place. Live food was
immediately offered in the form of maggots, mealworms, crickets and
snails; also finely cut day-old chicks. Mealworms and crickets were readily
taken, maggots less so. What exactly was fed to the chicks remains a
mystery as the male was very secretive in his visits to the nest and it was
not until the 26th that I actually saw the female feed the chicks. From four
days old, large quantities of snails were offered and as time progressed the
chicks were fed solely on these and finely chopped day-old chicks dusted
with Vionate and calcium.
The parents remained secretive in their feeding duties for some days
and it was not until the chicks proved too large to brood that reasonable
observations were possible. From about nine days old, the female vacated
the nest each evening to bathe thoroughly, often returning to the nest
while still quite wet. Two days later she gave up brooding during the day
but returned early evening for the night. One young ventured to the side
of the nest mid-afternoon on July nth and was soon followed by two
others. The fourth remained in the nest and was still there at 8.00 in the

evening. Regrettably, when a check was made an hour later it was lying
dead beneath the nest, having presumably lost its footing in trying to
venture out late. Feather development appeared retarded, but was other-
wise normal. The remaining three left the nest area next day and where
they landed they stayed. Two seemed perky but the third was very
subdued and although cared for adequately during the day, was found
dead the following morning. The remaining two progressed rapidly, soon
gaining enough confidence to explore their surroundings. Independence
was gained at about seven weeks.
On fledging, the colour was pale blue on the back and upper breast with
the remaining underparts white. Bill, legs and feet were ivory as was the
fleshy eye ring. The tail was barely 2 cm long. However, the plumage soon
began to brighten with the first to show through as green being the white
underparts. The blue areas are only just beginning to change, but the
elongated crown feathers are a vivid lime green. Shades of pink soon
flushed the ivory parts now (mid-September) almost as bright as the
adults. In contrast, the adults started to fade once the young became
independent and have reverted to pale blue. Both are now moulting.

Carpodacus cassinii
By F. W. Hancock (Leicester)
In the spring of 1977 I purchased a pair of Cassin's Finches which I
thought would make a nice exhibit for the coming show season, but I was
to be disappointed as the cock soon lost his brilliant red colouring, thus
losing his "show" appeal. I separated the pair and colour-fed the cock with
Carophyll but to no avail; he remained a weak dull red.
In April 1978 I put both birds in a planted aviary with a mixed collec-
tion of weavers, a Paradise Whydah, a Canary and a pair of Bourke's
Parrakeets. In the aviary were hanging several different types of nest box
and in June a half-open front box was chosen and lined with small twigs
and grass. Four eggs, coloured blue with brown flecks, were laid; three
were hatched and one was dead in shell. So far as I know the cock did not
assist in the incubation. Unfortunately, possibly because the top of the
nest lining was level with the open front of the box, after a few days two
chicks fell from the nest and were found dead on the ground. The third
chick was reared and is now (1st November) coloured and patterned as the
hen and living in the aviary with the parents. I replaced the open-front
nest box by one that had only a hole for entry.
In July 1978 the hen, deciding to go to nest again, ignored all the boxes
I had arranged for her approval and built her own nest in a dense bush
(Lonicera nitida). The nest was constructed of small twigs, grass and
feathers gathered in the aviary and was some five feet from the ground. At
this time the other occupants of the aviary, except the Bourke's, were
becoming a nuisance by chasing the finches and allowing them no time to
settle down. I removed all but the Cassin's and the Bourke's who were
busy attending to their own family matters. Again four eggs were laid and
again three were hatched. The chicks left the nest and had almost reached
independence when the parents suddenly stopped feeding them and I
found all three dead. I was taken completely by surprise. Both parents
were beginning to moult, so perhaps the reason for the neglect of the
offspring was that they went out of condition.
These finches have proved quite hardy and, having gained from this
year's experiences, I hope for better results next year.
As described, Cassin's Finch Carpodacus cassinii has been bred by
Mr. F. W. Hancock and this is believed to be the first success in this
country, but anyone knowing of another should please inform the Hon.

Amazona finschi
By R. E. H. Mann and Patricia D. Mann
(Denton, Peterborough)
Tens of thousands of caged Amazon parrots must be kept as pets
throughout the world and a very few inhabit aviaries--sadly practically
every one has been taken, as a nestling, from the wild. The British trade is
now much diminished from what it had been before the restrictions on
importation and the introduction of quarantine from ist March 1976, and
now is mostly concerned with the Blue-fronted Amazon A. aestiva. The
difference in the species available has not always been constant from year to
year. Festive A. festiva and Orange-winged Amazons A. amazonica were
fairly common fifteen years back and six or seven years ago it was the turn
of Mexican parrots to arrive. They appeared to come in considerable
numbers and amongst these were Finsch's or Lilac-crowned A. finschi.
Approximately four years ago we had the opportunity of buying one of
these Finsch's Amazons. It was in immaculate feather and quite a subdued
character, seeming to sit outside in the aviary as if mesmerised! We could
not be sure of its sex, but were determined to try and purchase a mate to
see what our chances of breeding would be, for at this time we had no idea
that they had never been bred here. Fortunately, only a few weeks later
the chance of buying another came along and when put together in the
aviary we were pretty confident that we had a pair. One was large and
masculine-looking and the other was a smaller more feminine bird. They
settled down together in the aviary very well and we were surprised that
they were so quiet, having heard from different sources that the calls from
Amazons often created problems with neighbours.
For the first two or three years they had a nest made from a hollow log
which the hen took initial interest in and then abandoned without laying.
When our long flight of aviaries was reconstructed very early this year, we
decided to introduce a different type of nest box entirely. This was fixed
on a slope and the entrance hole was behind the fascia of the covered in
area in the outside flight. The floor area of the box was several times
smaller than that of the original log. Measurements: 6 x 8 x 27 inches.
During May, the hen could be heard to make noises to attract the cock
and he was seen mating and feeding her several times. The cock mated on
the left hand side with wings almost outstretched towards the end of
mating and during the mating sequence, a purring kind of sound was heard
from one or both of them. During this time of mating and feeding, the
hen would disappear for long stretches and the pair seemed more secretive.
A quick peep when they were in the outside flight revealed that a shallow
nest was being built by chewing long splinters of wood from the wood
fastened inside the box for that purpose. On the 2nd June, we found the

first egg of a clutch of two. Only the hen incubated, coming out sometimes
in the early evening for about five minutes. A week later the second egg
was found. On 28th June, the hen came out for about ten minutes and a
quick check showed that one egg at least was fertile. As we had now been
told that there was no recorded breeding of these birds in England we were
quite excited, but determined not to build up our hopes.
On 3rd July, the hen was out in the flight for a few minutes early in the
morning, we found a chick had hatched possibly one or two days earlier.
The rather large chick had the sealed ear of so many American parrots.
were not so pronounced as they are in conures and caiques. The chick
grew extraordinarily quickly and on 15th July its eyes opened and the
ears opened when it was 25 days old. By 5th August it was beginning to
look like an Amazon! It weighed 12 \ ounces with grey down on the chest
and back, a number of green feathers were now through, the "frilled"
front was visible and the shadow of red was apparent on the forehead. By
12th August the baby was 90% feathered and was getting very adventur-
ous, scrambling up the slope of the nest box towards the entrance hole. It
would hiss when attempts were made to look at it in the nest, but would be
quite tame when held on the hand.
On 29th August at 60 days old it came out into the flight. It looked like
a slightly smaller version of the adults and differed by having more red on
the head (the parents are probably A.f. woodi and not the nominate race)
and the lilac (from which Finsch's Amazon get its second, less commonly
used name of Lilac-crowned Amazon) on the head was less well developed.
The cere was bone-coloured and the orange ring around the eye was
absent: the eyes were black.
It obviously enjoyed being in the aviary and though awkward at first in
flight, with several falls to the floor to its credit, it soon learnt its limitations
and would sit out with the parents most of the day. We found that it would
not go back into the nest box to roost and had to be put in by either my
husband or myself most nights. On 16th September we decided to bring
it into the house as we considered that by now it would be feeding itself--
in fact it did not start to feed until three days later--and then did not stop!
Its diet while being reared by the parents was mixed sunflower seed,
peanuts, a little hemp, large quantities of pine nuts, apples, oranges and
bread soaked in a nectar mixture which is fed to our lories. This soaked
bread we found to be a good rearing food and the parents still continue to
have it daily.
Parenthood seemed at first to have altered the character of the Amazons
inasmuch as in the past they never roosted in a nest box and remained out
in the flight every night regardless of weather conditions, but since the
chick hatched they have both taken to roosting in the box. There was also a
short spate of chewing the aviary framework, but this is a nasty habit they

Friends who now have the young Amazon decided to call it "Woodi".
They are thrilled with it, but remarked recently that it still has not stopped
eating.

By I. M. Hadgkiss (Waddesdon, Bucks)
Formerly known as the Half-moon or Golden-crowned Conure,
Aratinga aurea is green with the forehead, forecrown and feathers around
the eyes orange-yellow: hindcrown and eyebrow stripe are dull blue. The
throat, cheeks and upper breast are a dull olive-brown, while the lower
breast and abdomen are a pale yellow-green. The outer webs of the primar-
ies and primary coverts are green, changing to blue near the tips, and the
outer webs of the secondaries are blue. The tail is green with the ends of
the central feathers tinged with blue. The legs are dark grey and the bill is
grey-black. The length is about 11 inches. It is found throughout Brazil
and in parts of Bolivia and Paraguay.
In June of 1977 it was decided to obtain a mate for our Peach-fronted
Conure. Several excursions were made to view suitable candidates until
finally in July one was purchased. When compared with our original bird
the difference in the shape of the head was quite noticeable. Our original
bird had quite a flat look to the head and was thought to be a hen. Our new
acquisition had a slimmer more rounded head and was assumed to be a
cock--an assumption that later proved to be correct. The cock bird also
had slightly more orange around the eye; however, this latter fact is not
thought to be a general guide in sexing Peach-fronted Conures.
They were housed in an aviary measuring 13 feet long by 6 feet high by

the shelter was covered in perspex sheets. It was under this cover that a

nest box, measuring 16 by 10 by io inches was placed. This box was
immediately accepted by both birds and used for roosting. There was
two inches depth of well dampened peat placed in the bottom of the box.
In an attempt to eliminate mice, the floor of the aviary was also wired and
covered to a depth of three inches with pea gravel.
In late March the cock bird was frequently seen feeding the hen: there
was also mutual preening of the feathers around the vent--this they did
by standing side by side, facing opposite directions. This mutual preening
became a daily event in the last week of March and the first few days of
April. On April 4th the hen was spending a great deal of time in the box.
Inspection of the box on April 6th revealed one egg. Little or nothing was
seen of the hen from this time, and the cock showed great agitation and
screamed loudly whenever it was approached. From then on disturbance
was limited to feeding times and observation carried out from a short
distance away.
On the evening of April 21st, the hen was seen to be out of the nest and
bathing in the shallow water bowl: inspection of the box revealed four
eggs. The hen was not seen out of the box again until May 3rd when,
27 days from the laying of the first egg, one chick was found to have just
hatched. On May 16th there was still only one chick which, by now, had its
first feathers showing and its eyes open. The three remaining eggs were
removed, one of which was infertile and the other two contained chicks
which were unfortunately dead.
On June 20th, 48 days after hatching, the chick left the nest. Observation
showed the orange-yellow on the forehead and forecrown to be less
extensive than that of the adult birds. The feathers around the eyes are
light grey and the bill is a pale horn colour. The tail is shorter and the
plumage a paler shade of green than in the adults.
The diet of the adult birds at this time consisted of sunflower seed,
pine nuts, hemp seed and small quantities of plain canary and linseed.
A choice of fruits was made available but only apple was readily accepted.
A soft food consisting of a coarse insectile mixture and an egg food was
taken in small quantities, but chickweed and lettuce were ignored. Peanuts
were normally consumed by this pair, but from the day the chick hatched
pine nuts were taken exclusively when both were offered. Grated cuttle-
fish, yeast and a multi-vitamin powder were mixed into the soft food.
At the time of writing (early July) the chick has been out of the nest for
14 days and is just beginning to feed itself.

Red-winged Blackbirds are common insectivorous birds found through-
out most of the United States in the summer. Common insectivorous
bird species naturally have a greater impact on prey populations than less
common birds; therefore, the ability to rear blackbirds is of fundamental
importance in studies of predator-prey relations, all other factors being
equal. We wished to raise young birds so that we could compare adult and
naive inseccivores feeding on bumble bees and a bumble bee mimic.
Collet and Briggs (1974) give methods for raising young birds. We
successfully used their methods to raise young Common Grackles Quis-
calus quiscula except that we supplied the birds with water. Unfortunately,
we found these methods unsatisfactory for rearing young Red-winged
Blackbirds. Alcock (1973) hand-reared Red-winged Blackbirds but gives
only a brief account of his methods. Lanyon and Lanyon (1969) detail a
much more complex method for other bird species. I11 predation studies it
is important that the bird be exposed to many types of palatable prey to
avoid the feeding biases discussed by Coppinger (1970).

A. Non-living components
To control draughts, the young birds were kept in a small room with
only one door. This was necessary since young birds are very susceptible
to pneumonia. Ambient temperature was maintained at 24-3o*C. and
monitored at each feeding. The air temperature is critical because very
young birds have difficulty in maintaining their body temperature (Lanyon
and Lanyon 1969). An exhaust fan was operated at the upper temperatures
to help remove microbial spores and to dry the cages. We used a 16-hour
photophase and an 8-hour scotophase, using both fluorescent and incan-
descent lights.
The young birds (5-6 days old) were kept in wire mesh cages 30 x 30 x
15 cm with 1 cm gauge hardware-cloth floors to allow the faeces to pass
through to the newspaper on the bottom of the cages. The newspapers were
changed daily to avoid build-up of bacteria and fungi. Sand and wood-
shavings are undesirable cage bottom materials because they dry slowly
and thus provide a more suitable environment for micro-organisms.
We found that the stain of dried bird faeces was very difficult to remove
from the metal parts of the cages using normal methods. This stain can be
removed by scrubbing with a concentrated solution of one of the powdered
bleaches containing sodium perborate. A solution of very hot water and a

phenolic antiseptic probably sterilised forceps and feeding and drinking
containers. The risk of cross-contamination is great, so it was wiser to
discard inexpensive, difficult to clean items such as pipettes.
The birds were fed Purina R turkey starter mash containing Amprolium
and Bacitracin. Bacitracin inhibits the growth of gram-positive bacteria
(Burdon and Williams 1968) and it, along with Amprolium, is a routine
additive in turkey starter mash. A nutrient solution consisting of .0012%
Amprolium, 13% dark corn syrup, and 86% tap water was administered
as indicated below and at room temperature. Amprolium is a coccidiostat
for which there has been little noticeable resistance in coccidia at recom-
mended dosages in the three years we have used it in our work with young
passerines. Soluble Amprolium (9.6%) is available from Merck &amp; Co., Inc.,
Rahway, New Jersey. The nutrient solution was stored in a clean container
and used within 18 hours to minimize the microbial contamination.

The nestling blackbirds and their nest were collected in a cloth bag
when the feathers first started coming out of the sheaths. The birds were
about half-way to fledging then, hence there was less feeding to do and the
birds will have some ability to control their body temperature. Older
birds do not adjust to artificial conditions as well as birds at about this
stage. All the offspring from a clutch should be placed in a cage together
with their nest. The added communal warmth and insulation will aid in
body temperature maintenance. After 5-6 days, the birds competed so
vigorously for food that they were put into separate cages.
The feeding regime is one of the most sensitive areas in caring for young
birds. During the first 11 hours of the photophase, the birds were each
given 0.3 to 1.3 g of dry turkey feed using a clean pair of small, blunt
forceps every 20-30 minutes until the birds were separated. Initially, the
birds may not gape when the handler approaches. Gentle pressure with a
2 ml eyedropper-style pipette (see below) or forceps at the corner of the
bird's mouth will cause the mouth to open. The bird will learn to gape
without this procedure after a time. About two days after the wing feathers
burst from the sheaths, the birds demanded food less frequently (every
i-ij hours) but in greater quantities. For every few mouthfuls of turkey
feed, .5-1 ml of water were given with a glass or plastic pipette. We used
care in watering, as the birds easily drown.
During the last 5 hours of the photophase, we substituted mealworms
(larvae of Tenebrio molitor) or other palatable insects for the turkey feed
and the nutrient solution for tap water. Every 30 minutes the young birds
each consumed 5-10 mealworms (a total of .8 g) which were cut into 2-3
pieces. As the birds matured, they accepted increasingly larger pieces of
mealworms. A young, healthy Red-winged Blackbird ate, on average,
about 75 mealworms and 17.6 g of dry turkey starter mash or a total of
25.6 g of solid food each day.

Every two hours during the scotophase until the birds are ij months
old, they were given 1-3 ml of the nutrient solution. The exact quantity
depended upon the bird's desires but did not exceed 3 ml. This operation
necessitated turning on the room lights briefly. This nocturnal feeding is
unnatural but necessary. We had poor success with raising this species
until we instituted scotophase feeding. Any upset in reproductive matura-
tion seems to be adequately corrected by a natural photoperiod after the
birds are i\ months old.
If the young bird could feed itself, the bird handler's job would be
greatly facilitated, so self-feeding was encouraged at every opportunity.
Early in the birds' life, we tempted them to extend their necks to obtain
liquids, mealworms or turkey feed. This was accomplished by holding the
nutrient .5-1.0 cm in front of the gaping beak. If the bird did not move its
head forward and swallow, the handler slowly moved the material closer
to the base of the tongue. A healthy, hungry bird will move its head
forward and then swallow. The birds seemed to attack the forceps and
pipette after a few days. The handler should try to get the bird to attack
the forceps successively closer to a feeding tray which is placed in the
cage. Seven to 14 days after the full opening of the feathers, the birds were
able to begin to try to feed themselves. The birds reared in the wild feed
themselves about 21 days after hatching (Case and Hewitt 1963), slightly
later than ours.
Rapidly moving insects placed on top of the turkey feed also facilitated
self-feeding. The rapid movement attracted the birds' attention so that
they fixated on the insect and pecked at it. A live, medium-sized moth such
as Heliothis zea (Boddie) which had one set of wings removed made an
excellent target, but a palatable grasshopper, cricket, or caterpillar were
substituted. If the insect prey were laid on top of the turkey starter, the
birds picked up a few feed granules by accident at first and then came to
eat the turkey feed more and more regularly.
Drinking is learned separately from eating and required up to one week
longer. This may have been so because most birds must lift the tip of their
beaks up above their heads to allow the water to flow to the back of their
mouths. A live, palatable insect placed in the water dish acted as an
encouragement for self-watering. The water dish was a heavy, wide-
mouthed, shallow bowl with straight sides which prevented tipping when
the bird perched on the side. The birds also used the bowl for bathing
from time to time. We found it necessary to change the water and clean
the bowl twice each day after the birds began to perch on the sides. As
soon as the birds fed on turkey feed regularly, the dishes were filled with
tap water but the nutrient solution was supplied before this.

stress is more likely to suffer from this often fatal disease. Stressful con-
ditions include temperature extremes, undue excitement and lack of food
or water. A normal, healthy young Red-winged Blackbird that still requires
hand-feeding will beg for food 15-60 minutes after its last feeding if it sees
the handler. It will hold its plumage against its body, and stand with its
legs extended and the head approximately horizontal. A sick bird will lose
its appetite, have fluffed-out feathers, be unable to maintain proper
posture, become cyanotic (particularly noticeable in the featherless
regions of the head), and the normally claret-coloured oral cavity will be
pink to grey. The bloody faeces so typical of certain Eimeria sp. infections
in chickens are not seen in the passerines with which we have dealt.
The sick birds had their own feeding pipette and were isolated. A
special nutrient solution of warmed (about 39*C) non-dairy baby formula
with Amprolium at .0024% was effective if the symptoms were detected
early and the treatment started immediately. Amprolium is toxic to
Red-winged Blackbirds (although less so to Common Grackles); therefore,
care in the amount given is indicated. Amprolium is intended not to kill the
protozoans but to retard their growth, thus allowing the bird to build up
its natural defences against the micro-organisms. No mealworms were
given to the ill birds; turkey starter and the medicated formula were their
only nourishment. Coccidiosis is most easily diagnosed in post mortem
examination, so the emphasis is on prevention.
The growing bird
To rear young Red-winged Blackbirds optimally, one must be aware of
the developmental events. Bent (1965) gives some of the development up
to the fledgeling stage and we have included other maturational data in
other parts of this paper, but the following additional information may be
helpful. About the time the wing and dorsal body feathers burst from their
sheaths, the yellowness around the corners of the mouth disappears and
the proportions of the beak begin to change as the beak slowly lengthens.
On about the seventh or eighth day after hatching, the shape of the
faeces changes radically. Earlier, the faeces were in a white rounded sac
but now they are cylindrical and darker, hence, more similar to the adult's.
At about the same time, the birds attempt their first flights. They will not
roost inside the nest after this. The nest will serve as a source of mites and
the birds at this point do not need the insulation it provided; therefore, it
is best discarded. A miticide can be used but any chemical treatment not
absolutely necessary should be avoided. Unless the mites are very severe,
the young birds seem to be able to eliminate them in their normal grooming.
We successfully reared to adulthood five of the six nestlings which we
collected. The one death from coccidiosis {Eimeria sp. infection was
confirmed by the Small Animal Clinic, University of Illinois). This
particular bird seemed to be less mature than its nest mates and died
before it could feed. We were able to maintain juveniles (which we had
previously hand-reared) for eight months in captivity. All of these birds

NOTES ON THE PIONUS PARROTS
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.977146928571429" page_id="56386856"  page_num="196" year="" vol="">
By Johan Ingels (Destelbergen, Belgium)
Pionus are attractive, medium sized neotropical parrots. All eight species
have red under tail-coverts, which is typical of the genus. The paucity of
information on their general behaviour is due, at least partly, to the small
numbers living under controlled conditions. In these notes I shall report
on certain observations, some of which have already been mentioned
briefly by other authors ( e.g . Smith 1975).
Juvenile plumage
Fledgelings of the Blue-headed P. menstruus , the Red-billed P. sordidus ,
Maximilian's P. maximiliani and the White-capped Parrot P. senilis are
predominantly, almost uniformly, coloured dull green. Those of the
former three species are known to have a reddish forehead. The amount of
red can vary from a reddish cast or a few reddish feathers to a broken
reddish frontal band (personal observations. Low 1972, Mathys 1977,
Geil 1977 and Cummings 1977). These reddish feathers disappear with
the first moult. This unusual feature of the fledgeling's colour pattern has :
not been observed with fledgelings of P. senilis. They have the feathers of j
the forehead and forecrown dull green, slightly edged with buff-white.
The typical white crown of the adults is assumed within approximately 1
six months of fledging.
The fine, hair-like red feathers surrounding the cere (Low 1972), j
described also as reddish spots on either side of the forehead (Forshaw
1973) of the Dusky Parrot P. fuscus and the orange-red tipped forehead
and crown feathers of the Grey-headed Parrot P. seniloides remain puzzling 1
phenomena with regard to, although not directly connected with the one j
described above.
Threat display \
A typical threat or aggression display has been described for senilis j
(Low 1972) and fuscus (Smith 1977). I observed this same display in
menstruus , ynaximiliani and senilis.
These four species were seen to react to stressing situations by walking ;
up and down horizontal perches in the following manner: the cheek, neck j
and mantle feathers are puffed out, the tail is fanned and lowered thus
brushing against the perch, the wings are held away from the body and j
slightly drooped. The head is held low with the bill almost touching the
perch, when displaying is intense, as illustrated by Smith (1977). However, j
the head is held normally when displaying is milder (Photo 1).
I have noticed that only relatively tame birds display readily; shy ones j
never appear to do so. This display is not restricted to Pionus , but can be
found in other neotropical parrots too (Smith 1977).

ruffling their feathers to allow water to penetrate their plumage.
In an outside aviary, they become very excited during a heavy shower of
rain and can be seen to hang upside down from perches and the aviary roof,
with wings outstretched, tail fanned and body feathers fluffed, screeching
all the while.
In a heavily planted flight, menstruus , maximiliani , senilis and Bronze-
winged Parrots P. chalcopterus were observed to engage in intensive
leaf-bathing after foliage was wetted by a rain shower or artificially, with
a garden-hose (Photo 2).
Although standing water for bathing is always available, it was never
seen to be used by these four species. However, a caged senilis has on
several occasions been seen to attempt to bathe in its drinking pot.
Feeding habits
Pionus feed rarely from the ground. Cummings (1977) writes however:
"They (i.e. the Maximilian's Parrots) showed a marked preference for
green food after the young hatched ... They even cropped the grass close
in their aviary . .." And Smith (in Low 1976) writes: "The only occasion
when I have caught the birds (i.e. Bronze-winged Parrots) on the ground is
just before egg-laying when the hen is searching for, what I take to be,
old faeces and soil for extra vitamins and minerals".
I have seen Pionus fly directly to the ground to pick up fallen food items,
mostly if not always for peanuts; although in most cases, they will try to
descend downward sloping branches and perches which almost touch the
ground, to recover food. However, I have seldom observed them feeding
while actually on the ground. Low ranging, ripening grassheads, for
example, are reached from the aviary sides by climbing down the wire or
from low hanging nearby branches. They are never tackled from the
ground. I believe that feeding by Pionus from and/or on the ground, is an
"opportunistic" adaptation to their living under controlled conditions. Of
the 25 Pionus in my care, only one chalcopterus has ever been seen to fly
down to the ground to drink from standing water.
Sexing and reproduction
Breeding attempts with Pionus have been scarce. Recently however,
extensive accounts of the breeding with several species have been given
(e.g. Stoodley 1978).
In Pionus, adults of the same species show considerable variation both in
coloration and size. Differences are most prominent in overall body size
and in colour of the periophthalmic ring or periorbital skin. Differences in
coloration are mainly due to Pionus taking several years to attain adult
plumage: however, no reliable colour or size differences can facilitate
sexing.
In maximiliani differences in width and colour of the periorbital skin
between both sexes have been mentioned in literature; the whitish bare
skin around the eye being broader in the female and the purple tinge on the
upper breast being more intensive in the male (Geil 1977). However,

Cummings (1977) writes: "Maximilian's P. maximiliani are in some cases
easy to sex, the males having a larger white ring around the eye than fe-
males, though our pair are almost identical in looks".
I noticed in my two pairs of maximiliani that both observations may be
true. The "inflammation" of the periorbital skin is definitely seasonal,
but its variation cannot be clearly related to a given sex. Although more
information is needed before any generalisation can be made, I feel that the
colour intensity of the eye ring may depend principally upon the degree of
sexual activity, i.e. upon breeding condition.
As small colour differences such as a purplish upper breast may also be
closely related to subspecific status, they too should be judged critically.
Little has been published on clutch size, and incubation and nestling
periods of Pionus. From reports of breeding results in the literature, from
inquiries made among aviculturists breeding these parrots and my own
observations, the following conclusions can be reached. Clutch size varies
between two and four eggs, with an obvious preponderance for clutches of
three. Details of laying are available for clutches of two and three eggs only
(personal observations. Low 1976 and 1978, Geil 1977, Mathys 1977,
Stoodley 1978). Normally, in a clutch of two, both eggs are laid within
three days; in a clutch of three, the eggs are laid within seven days, with
intervals of two full days between two eggs.
Incubation takes from 24 to 29 days. Young are born on successive days,
or with a two-days' interval. Both parents care for the nestlings. The young
remain in the nest for a period of approximately 55 to 60 days.

Poicephalus gulielmi
By A. A. J. Stoodley (Lovedean, Hants)
Poicephalus gulielmi ranges from Liberia to Kenya, Tanzania and
northern Angola and is a bird of the forests up to quite high altitudes.
There are four races, one of them being known as Aubry's Parrot, and the
species is said to be scarce in the western part of its range, but commoner
in the east.
The main colour of Jardine's Parrot is green, but the mantle, secondaries
and wing-coverts are blackish edged with green; the tail is blackish and the
forehead, crown, thighs and carpal edges of the wings orange-red. Length
about 9 inches. The sexes are easily distinguished by the iris colour which
is orange in the male and brown in the female; also the sexes of my two
pairs are of differing shades of green.
My first four Jardine's Parrots were sent to me in the autumn of 1974;
they were believed to be quite young birds and had been for a short time
in the collection of a fellow aviculturist. They were rather shy and were
housed in a large aviary with parrakeets and some other parrots. We found
that they were not fully acclimatised, so they were brought in for the winter.
One of the four died during the second winter and was replaced.
In the spring of 1977 the four birds were put into an aviary measuring
20 x 7 x 6 feet and all four spent a lot of time in the single hollow log in this
aviary, only coming out for short periods, but when a second log was put
there, one pair occupied it and they were then transferred to an adjoining
aviary. Both pairs nested and eggs were laid, the clutches being mostly of
four eggs, the average egg size being 27.2 x 26.2 mm and, of course, white.
Laying and incubation continued through the late summer and autumn,
but no chicks were hatched, dead-in-shell being the main trouble. As the
birds spent most of their time in the logs, they were left outside for the
winter. The aviaries were furnished with strip lighting which came on at
2.00 a.m. and the nesting logs were placed over containers of warm water,
the water being warmed by means of aquarium heaters.
In the spring of 1978 the aviaries occupied by the Jardine's were wanted
for other parrots, so they, together with their nesting logs were taken inside
to aviaries measuring only 6x6x6 feet, the only light coming from roof
lights. Soon after this move to the new quarters, four eggs were laid in one
of the nests and at last a chick was hatched on the 28th May, naked and
very small. I believe the incubation period to be 26 days. When some
down appeared, it was grey and feathers first came on the wings. We were
able to photograph the young one from a few days old until it was fully
fledged and independent at approximately twelve weeks old. The juvenile
plumage was of a duller colour than that of the parents with little of the
orange-red. This young bird was removed when the parents started

plucking its head feathers, the reason perhaps being that the mother had
laid two more eggs. The young bird was fed by both parents, the diet
consisting of peanuts, pine nuts, sunflower seed, soaked safflower seed (a
great favourite), carrot, apple, green food and bread and milk.
As described, Jardine's Parrot Poicephalus gulielmi has been bred by
Mr A. A. J. Stoodley and this is believed to be the first success in this
country, but anyone knowing of another should please inform the Hon.

the lineolated (barred) parrakeet Bolborhynchus lineola
Following on Mr R. E. Oxley's interesting and detailed observations of
this species recently published in the Magazine, I should like to add my
own experiences.
Once, in 1973, I had a true pair of B. lineola. The cock bird was of a
much paler, almost golden green to that of his wife and, exactly as with
Forpus parrotlets, he would frequently be heard singing a quiet, finch-like,
twittering song. The pair were extremely confiding and would fly over and
creep down to almost dare to take a small piece of apple from my fingers.
Large items of food are held in a raised foot to be munched at and, like most
(all ?) small-sized parrots, they scratch the head by lifting the scratching- ;
foot over the wing. Even though I never saw them there, they must have
sometimes descended to the ground for the cock bird eventually died of an
infestation of Ascaridia worms, which was both careless of me and a pit}&amp;apos;,
for with his loss I lost my opportunity of getting them to breed.
Lineolated are extremely secretive and their superb camouflage of green
barred with black makes them indiscernible in leafy branches. They move
in a most skulking manner, often with the body held in the same plane as
the perch, so that when they "freeze"--as they so readily do on the least
sign of danger--with the head held slightly raised, they become as a
shadowy leaf. They are about the bigness of the domestic Budgerigar---the
four weighed were: 42, 45, 45 and 52 grams. They differed from the other
tiny New World parrots with which I have experience-- Forpus parrotlets
and the Aymara Parrakeet B. aymara --by preferring small seeds, such as
canary and millet, to large ones, say, hemp and sunflower. They can be
extremely tolerant of one another. Frequently I have had two hens lay in

the same nest and Mr Kyme has had the same. His four adults, consisting
of three hens and one cock, slept together in a nest box in which three chicks
were being reared.
After the male died it proved impossible to get a replacement, for
Lineolated seem to be seldom imported and those available are not as easy
to sex as those examined by Prestwich (1954) an d Forshaw (1973). Perhaps
this is because the present British examples are of the southernmost race
B.l. tigrinus and not the northern, and presumably more sexually dimor-
phic, B.l. lineola. The hen, at Kyme's, is quite the darkest-barred of any
Lineolated yet seen and has produced chicks. My widow-hen was trans-
ferred to a small indoor flight which seemed to suit her nesting require-
ments better than the aviary she had previously inhabited, for she then
laid the first of several clutches. When a partner was finally obtained, in
1974, they both contributed to the following clutch. This second hen was
exchanged for another "probable" cock, two years later. This, in its turn,
also laid eggs. This year, 1978, I lent both hens to Mr Ray Kyme to put
with his two unsexed Lineolated. For it was my impression, since borne
out by Mr Kyme's success, by Mr Oxley's observations and by a conver-
sation with the Spenkelinks, who are very successful Dutch breeders of
American parrots, that Lineolated would breed successfully in a colony.
Prestwich has described what he thought might have been a courtship
display where, in the evening (as he noted they are somewhat crepuscular)
a pair would stand facing each other, stretch vertically upwards and, with
beaks interlocked, remain head-high for some moments. My casual
observation was that my male sang and after feeding his hen would sidle
up to copulate with a foot on her back and the other leg gripping the perch.
The seven clutches obtained, by me, were all of four eggs. And one such
clutch, when fresh, gave an average egg weight of 3.1 grams: which is a
very small egg for the size of the bird. The measurements of a four-egg
clutch were 20.6 x 16.7; 20.1 x 15.6; 19.6 x 15.8 and 19.4 x 16.2 mm.
The incubation period had never been accurately recorded until
Oxley (1978) established that it is on average 18 days. The newly hatched
chicks are sparingly covered with white down and this does not abrade off,
but is replaced by a second, thicker, down of grey. The fresh-hatched
chicks are strange for New World parrots in that, like the Red-capped
Fionopsitta pileata (Smith 1977a) they have an open ear-hole. Mrs Spenke-
link has told me that Aymara Parrakeets B. ay mar a are the same. The bill
has no apparent swelling at the base: the eyes open at about 12 days and
the young leave the nest when 38 days old and perhaps a few days earlier
than this, as Mr Oxley records.
leadbeater's cockatoo Cacatua leadbeateri
In 1977 m y cock Leadbeater's had fertilised, and helped to incubate,
the single egg laid by a hen Triton Cockatoo C. galerita triton: regrettably
the chick was dead-in-shell. As my estimate of the entire British population

of Leadbeater's is less than 60 birds, there was no real hope of obtaining
another; for in a "good" year the thirty pairs, together, raise between
them not more than a dozen youngsters and in "normal" years the number
is five or six. In Europe the position is much the same: most pairs belong
to zoos which gives them little chance to breed successfully. Some are
illegally exported from Australia, for private aviculturists, into Western
Germany and Holland, but this trade is small and the demand vastly
exceeds the supply. However, in August 1977, through the kindness of
one of our members, I managed to get a hen which had been a caged pet
for several years. The general belief is that such a tame bird might well
be humanised and unable to accept a mate of its own species; but, as with
this bird, the reverse has always applied with myself, for the tamer a bird
the more likely it has proved that it will breed.
My own aviaries were not then metal-lined so Mr Ray Kyme, of Boston,
kindly agreed to house the pair. With the cockatoos went one of my elm-
plank nest boxes, to be screwed to the outside of the flight so that some
notes on breeding behaviour could be taken.
Like the sulphur-crested cockatoos, they emphasise annoyance by
flicking the head downwards and forwards simultaneously throwing out the
crest. This movement has yet to be seen (probably because I have spent so
little time in my observations) in the flatter-crested cockatoos--such as
the Roseate C. roseicapillus --and yet is noticeable in the Bluebonnet
Psephotus haematogaster --a broad-tailed parrot. At a higher intensity the
Leadbeater's pull the wings out from the body to show their pink under-
surface and the forward head-flicking with crest-erection is accompanied
by a noisy squawk of annoyance. They actually have proved fairly quiet
except towards evening when they call a little; but even this is bearable
compared with the terrible noise of so many of the American parrots.
It was many weeks before the birds were first seen to preen one another.
In early March the nest box front was opened and both birds began to
immediately investigate and enter. Mating was not noted, except that it
took place several times a day and the first egg appeared exactly a fortnight
after the box was opened up. The clutch of three was laid at three-day
intervals and the mean weight of the rather elongated eggs was 16 grams.
Pigeon-wise the male incubated for most of the daylight hours and the
hen for the night with him roosting outside the box. The chicks took
26 days to hatch: the first two arrived the same day and the third three
days later. This last chick was not fed: the neglect might well have been
because it was overwhelmed, in size, by the mass of its huge, three-day
older, siblings. The early growth was quite astounding, even for a parrot.
On hatching, the head and neck are quite bald and the body is very thinly
covered with short (less than a centimetre) whitish down (Figure), so that,
unless handled, it might appear completely naked. By the considerable
noise they created when fed, this must have taken place extremely fre-
quently, one parent remaining with them while the other stuffed itself on

bread steeped in milk, seed, meat-bones and greenfood. Unfortunately the
chicks were never weighed: it would have been easy, for the hen invariably
left her charges to scold, at the entrance to the nest, anyone who approached
close by. The male, on the other hand, sat as tight as a cork.
By 12 days the eyes were opening and the quills were forming under the
skin. By three weeks the chicks were so large that the parents only needed
to brood them at night. When they left the nest at 55 days old, they were
seen to be slightly plucked about the head from the attention of the hen.
Being constantly under surveillance before fledging and having such tame
parents the chicks were, and still remain, perfectly fearless.
The sexes of adult Leadbeater's are perfectly easy to separate for, even
at a distance, it can be seen that whereas the male has the whole of his
underparts pink, the hen has a central patch of white to the lower chest and
abdomen; her irides are red and his dark brown and his crest has a thinner
strip of yellow to its centre. Therefore, as the chicks had a white abdomen
and lower chest and an extremely wide streak of yellow to the crest, they
were assumed to both be hens. By 20 weeks old this was confirmed for their
irides had begun to pale and while they were not red, they were greyish,
a much lighter shade than in an adult cock bird.

THE short-tailed parrot Graydidascalus brachyurus
Short-tailed Parrots are small, dull-coloured, extremely Amazon-like
parrots. A male weighed 158 grams and a hen 160 grams. The rather large
bill is olive-green, the outer ring of the iris a deep orange-red, the body
colour and shape is that of an Amazon parrot save that the larger wing-
covert feathers are margined with yellow-green and there is no red to the
wing. Thomas Brosset's beautiful photograph of a tame bird, in Rosemary
Low's parrots of south America, illustrates the curious edge to the
cutting edge of the upper bill and the small patch of maroon on the sides
of the lower neck and the wing-butts which is partly hidden by the folding
of the wing against the body. William Cooper's painting in J. M. Forshaw's
parrots of the world, shows neither of these unique characteristics.
Perhaps the Short-tailed Parrot deserves a monotypic genus.
The distribution is that of the rain forests associated with the River
Amazon from its furthermost tributaries to the Atlantic Ocean. It is a
noisy, flocking, bird. Miss Low tells me that the ones she saw in Colombia
could not be confused with other parrots on account of their small size
and short tail; their characteristic and very loud voices and the wavering,
almost butterfly-like flight. She also reports that these roosting flocks had
no obvious groupings into pairs; but that they were homogeneous. My
captive birds are very arboreal so that, although their aviary does have some
low perches, I have never seen them near the ground, not even to chew the
leaves of plants a metre high.
I have now had Short-tailed Parrots for five years. The first two came
as a "cheap offer" from a dealer who, after six months, had found no
buyer. A few months afterwards I acquired another two from Mrs Belford,
that source of so many uncommon parrots. They probably came from the
same small shipment. That winter one, a male, died from visceral gout and,
early this year, I lost another because a plug of caseous material had
suddenly lodged in its windpipe. Although the three original birds had
made an annual inspection of the nest box they never laid and were, correctly
as it turned out, thought to be of the same sex. This year, again through
Mrs Belford, I acquired a hand-tame hen. She was put out with the two
survivors and it then became obvious what extraordinarily noisy creatures
Short-tailed Parrots are. They cackle away an hour or so after dawn and,
again, about an hour before sundown. The hens have a threat display like
Pionus (Smith 1977b) except that the Short-tailed slightly pulls the
"shoulder" (carpus) away from the body so revealing the blackberry-juice
colours on the side of the lower throat. The tame hen often was seen to
solicit for pairing by slowly sidling up to one of the others, which always
seemed to form a pair, but they ignored her by moving away. On the
3rd July the hen of the "pair" laid a single egg weighing 11 grams.
Unfortunately it disappeared the next day and so was not measured. She
then laid another, the first of a clutch of two, 15 days later. But her "male"
then also laid and the two sat on the clutch of three for a month before

deserting. The tame hen then laid, in the other nest box, on the 1st Sep-
tember. Three clutches composed of a single egg and one of two suggests
a very low reproductive rate. It is also curious, for an equatorial parrot,
that they are, like Amazona and Pionus , seasonal nesters--at least in
captivity.
There was a considerable difference in the size of the eggs: the clutch
of two measured 21.y X 31 mm and 22.7 x 31.1 mm and the single eggs
25.2 X 32.9 mm and 27.5 x 30.5 mm. This last egg weighed 10 grams at
three days old. I would be pleased to hear if anyone knows the whereabouts
of another Short-tailed Parrot in the hope that I might obtain a male, or
males, for these three hens.

MODERN TREATMENT FOR SOME AVIAN PARASITES

New Westminster, B.C., Canada)
These notes deal with the treatment of some parasites found in the
writer's birds--mostly passerine, but with a few parrots. Gallinaceous
birds are not included, but the observations may well apply to these.
The commonest intestinal parasitic infection in passerines is coccidiosis
and perhaps, strictly speaking, the word "infestation" should be used, but
this is applied to external parasites such as fleas, and "infection" will be
used here for the internal parasites. Coccidia (singular coccidium) are
protozoa akin to the organism causing malaria and the genus Eimeria lives
mainly in Galliformes, Columbiformes and Anseriformes. The genus
Isospora is found mostly in Passeriformes and there is remarkably little
overlap. I have no idea if Psittaciformes have natural coccidial infections,
but, except in the case of ground-feeders, it would be most unlikely.
Parrots do harbour Isospora in captivity and pick these up in crowded
unhygienic shipping centres. Infection was, however, rare in my parrots
and it was always light.
The following studies were nearly all on the genus Isospora , at least two
types of which were found in over 300 birds of about 50 species. A third
distinct type was found once only--in a Golden-crowned Kinglet Regulus
satrapa and a fourth distinct species was found in two Eurasian Jays
Garrulus glandarius. In addition four cases of Eimeria were treated in three
pigeons and a duck.
Newly imported birds were the worst affected. In the wild it would be
almost impossible for strictly arboreal birds to acquire coccidia, but even
Chloropsis were heavily infected when newly arrived. The main factor in
spreading coccidia is food and especially water contaminated with droppings
which contain cysts. These ripen to the infectious stage in one day or
longer. A light infection seems not to upset the birds at all and indeed
most wild birds harbour some. The problem with captive birds is that if
that are confined in dirty overcrowded conditions, they can easily acquire
a heavy infection. If ingested with food, water, or even by preening, a
single cyst multiplies into several thousand in the intestine.
Coccidia can increase the need for vitamin A, for example, to perhaps
ten times that supplied in the normal diet. The state of the intestine in a
heavy infection would cause poor utilisation of food in general and I
suspect that the irritation and inflammation of the bowel assist the spread
of concomitant bacterial infection. Some newly imported birds had massive
coccidial infections and these ones always had bacterial infections as well.
Of course, the conditions predisposing to one would also favour the
acquisition of the other. Some of these badly infected birds died, but it is
interesting to note that in some cases when the coccidia were eradicated

the bacteria cleared up without treatment. Two Garrulax leucolophus
(White-crested Jay Thrushes) were kept in carefully controlled conditions
and Isospora cysts were found in their droppings for exactly one year in the
absence of treatment or re-infection. After about one month only a light
infection was seen, but it had been very heavy when the birds were newly
acquired. These particular cysts had an average sporulation time (i.e.
ripening to the infectious stage) of no hours, but wide variations in
sporulation times can be caused by variations in temperature, humidity
and the amount of air (or oxygen) reaching the cysts--and other factors as
well. Even then not all cysts ripen under optimal conditions and some
always remain to ripen later. This is a good survival technique, rather like
the sporadic hatching of "Annual" Killifish eggs.
An improvement in the technique for checking sporulation times has
shown that all the coccidia examined produced infectious cysts in about
one day, but only a small percentage ripened in this time, the rest sporu-
lating over several days. The access of air was a major factor and I was
unable to demonstrate that more than one similar species was involved at a
time when this was being checked. Occasionally a bird had two distinct
types of Isospora. Sporulation times have in the past been a major means of
speciating coccidia, but for the above reasons I think they are over-
speciated.
The original work was begun five years ago, but was shelved for various
reasons until recently. No safe successful treatment had been available for
Isospora: then a compound appeared for the treatment of Trichomonas , a
human protozoan which has troublesome relatives in birds. This was
metronidazole which, however, was available ten years earlier in other
countries, but I could not find any record of its use against coccidia.
Coccidia go through a very complicated cycle in the intestine involving
ten or so stages, (depending on how you divide them). Metronidazole only
works at certain stages--I do not know which. As there will be countless
organisms at every stage at any given time, several (or continuous) treat-
ments are necessary. One that is successful and convenient is administra-
tion twice a day (approximately every 12 hours) for three days. A single
dose will only reduce the number of cysts seen in the droppings. A single
daily dose for three days does not cure, but daily dosing for five days has
worked in some cases. It is obvious that the medication just has to be given
over a period of time which will cover the vulnerable stages of all the
coccidia present. The exact times of the various cycles inside the body are
not all known, but are thought to be only a few hours.
Metronidazole has a wide safety margin and treatment did not visibly
affect the birds. Some treated birds nested normally for several seasons
afterwards, and at least one was alive five years later.
The effective dose averaged 0.6 mg. per gram of bird, with a range of
0.3-1 mg./g. This gives plenty of scope for judging the dose and this is
done simply by cutting the 250 mg. tablet into J, # and to. You have to

<bodyText confidence="0.998772777777778" page_id="56386870"  page_num="208" year="" vol="">
know the weight of the bird, of course. This dose (o .6 mg./g.) is given twice
daily for three days. I find that under about 0.2 mg./g. is not very effective,
on a once or twice daily basis, but possibly an even lower dose would work
if kept at a sustained level for 24-48 hours. Lack of birds has hampered
research on this as I have to take a cautious approach because, in Canada
at least, my birds are just about irreplaceable. The larger (1 mg.) dose was
given to smaller birds (under 40 g.). A dose of 0.2 mg./g. once every
24 hours for three days cured two Linnets, but just failed with a third in
earlier experiments. A fourth bird was cleared of cysts on 0.1 mg./g. once
a day for five days. The dose was increased until regular cures were
obtained with no ill effects and the above figure of o.5-0.6 mg. was arrived
at.
Treatment via the drinking water is out, because even a solution of 0.05%
or less is absolutely vile, and the birds will not touch it. The taste lingers
on the tongue for some time, so pieces of pill should be pushed well down
the throat and washed down with water. Food does not interfere with
absorption: the substance is absorbed into the bloodstream, but some of
the tablet base is ejected in as little as 15 minutes. It is possible that some
active compound comes with it. Note that only half the weight of the
tablet is active, and all the dosage figures are active, e.g. # tablet weighs
about 120 mg. and contains 60 mg. of actual dose--you lose some in the
cutting. The rapid passage through the bird possibly allows only part of
the dose to be absorbed and might explain the bird's tolerance of these
apparently high doses, (some 100 X the human dose). This would mean
that the coccidia perhaps absorb some of the chemical from direct contact,
as well as from the intestine wall in which they secrete themselves or feed
upon, depending on their stage of development.
Just to complicate matters, a twice daily dose for four days did not work
in two Garrulax --not the two referred to earlier. The day after treatment
(day 5) a fair number of cysts were seen, many of them damaged and five
days later only one cyst was found. A week after that some more appeared,
particularly in one bird and a second course of treatment failed to eradicate
the cysts. In the meantime I began treating two Eurasian Jays for cocci-
diosis: they had five or six other parasites which were treated later. The
Isospora had one of the largest cysts I had ever seen: large ones are un-
common in Passeriformes and these averaged 28 x 23.51a (micron).
After three courses of treatment, for a total of 11 days, the coccidia were
just as numerous as ever. One bird had an extremely heavy infection and
it was dying; it fell over and hand-feeding was commenced. It lay on its
side for 12 hours, but was still alive next day when it was given one dose of
sulphonamide/trimethoprim (S X T) and hand-fed that day. The following
day it was standing weakly on the floor, but eating by itself and examina-
tion of the droppings showed about 300 cysts per low power (microscope)
field. The bird was given a further dose and next day it was sitting on a
perch. An examination of the droppings failed to find a single cyst. The

other bird which was not so heavily infected showed the same pattern., the
cysts vanishing after the second dose, but a further dose was given to each
bird just to make sure. The other parasites were relatively light and it is
fairly certain that the first bird was dying from coccidiosis; it was emacia-
ted, but is now fat and well, as is the other.
The two Garrulax which had not responded to metronidazole were now
treated with SxT (Tribrissen in this case). The birds were in good
condition and the infection was light. In two days the cysts were gone, as
with the jays. Then a young pigeon was brought to my attention: this thin
and listless bird was eating practically nothing and an examination of the
thin green droppings showed the heaviest coccidia infection I had ever
seen. There were between 400 and 500 cysts per low power field. This bird
was treated twice every 24 hours (8-10 hours apart) with metronidazole
and after two days (four doses) it still excreted some cysts. These had by
this time been identified as Eimeria with a sporulation time of about a day
and a half and treatment was switched to SxT (Tribrissen), the bird
being given J tablet (about 120 mg.) every 24 hours. The number of cysts
went up slightly between the third and fourth doses of metronidazole,
but with the SxT the cysts were somewhat reduced in number on the
second day and by the third day (after two doses) they were eradicated.
Four days of treatment (i.e. four doses) were given and the cysts were not
seen again, while the bird began eating and was quite lively by the fifth
day. All the above cases on S X T were followed up for at least three months.
A further two pigeons and a duckling, all with Eimeria were similarly
treated and became clear, but there was no microscopic follow up and
treatment was given only once per 24 hours (for three days). The birds
were known to be well some months later.
A Mexican Jay Gyanocorax yncas with a light Isospora infection was
given SxT for two days, but the coccidia remained. It is not absolutely
certain that it did not eject either dose, but this was not seen to happen.
This bird was then put on metronidazole for four days, as was its mate
and the Isospora was eradicated in both cases. This would rule out the
probability of S X T working on all species of Isospora , but would be worth
checking further. If I get a serious case of Isospora , I shall probably try
metronidazole first because of its good record. I hope that others will
experiment on this. The question arises of whether or not sulphonamide
alone would have cured the S x T cases: sulphas have been used for a very
long time and have a very erratic record on Eimeria. I tried them originally
on Isospora and there was no response whatever. Sulphonamides work by
interfering with cell uptake of para-aminobenzoic acid, thus blocking the
synthesis of folic acid. Trimethoprim has a similar action at a slightly
different stage, blocking the conversion of folic acid to folinic acid. As the
combination of the two has obvious theoretical advantages and works
rather dramatically in such short courses (albeit on only a few cases, but
with no failures) it is hardly worth persisting with sulphas alone.

S X T does not interfere with folic acid metabolism of the higher animals
and it has proved very safe over the several years that I have used it to treat
bacterial infections.
The dose given was not measured, but was approximately 0.75 mg./g.
weight of bird. It was given once per 24 hours, but not exactly 12 hours
apart. It was staggered over three days at between 12 and 24-hour intervals
and this was done in order to catch the coccidium at critical stages, just in
case its cycle was completed in less than 24 hours. However, as SxT keeps
sustained blood levels for about 12 hours, this was probably not necessary,
but at least it shows that the dose need not be given at exact intervals
which may be a convenience.
A point to note is that Garrulax should be held for about a minute with
the beak held closed so that the pill is not coughed up. Jays are by far the
most difficult birds to dose with anything and they often regurgitate the
medicine along with a cropful of food some time later and this is the most
likely cause of treatment failure. You just have to persist and may have to
give crushed pill along with food and copious draughts of water. Put the
bird in a cage with clean paper on the floor so that the coughed-up dose
will be seen.
Tinidazole, a newer compound related to metronidazole, promises more
safety and efficiency than the latter, but it is not obtainable in Canada and
I have been unable to get any, but it is mentioned so that others may check
on it.
Fairly common parasites in my tropical birds ( e.g . Chloropsis) are
filariae. The larval form of these worms, known as microfilariae, circulate
in the bloodstream and can be seen post-mortem. If a bird is bleeding for
some reason, you can catch some blood on a slide and look for the larvae
under a microscope. It is difficult to assess their role in disease and I have
not seen any illness that could be directly connected with them. There is
some evidence that metronidazole (and probably related compounds like
tinidazole) will work against some microfilariae and mebendazole would
be worth trying. The problem with these worms would be proving that
they have been removed--from live birds at any rate.
If wild birds are included, the next most common intestinal parasites
after coccidia are roundworms of the genus Capillaria whose pathogenicity
is largely undetermined, but heavy infections would undoubtedly cause
malabsorption of food and general gastric disturbance. No treatment was
available when I had some infected birds, but mebendazole shows promise
--see later notes. Actually the second commonest intestinal parasites in
my collection are the tapeworms, nearly all of which were of the genus
Hymenolepis , the dwarf tapeworms, and these were found in most omni-
vorous or insectivorous ground-feeders. All Turdus , Garrulax and
Copsychus harbour them and they were also found in local wild thrushes,
e.g. Varied Thrush Zoothera naevia.
The life cycle of most of these tapeworms is unknown. Some eggs are

directly infective when ingested; others have to be swallowed by a worm
or an insect first. Some can go by both routes, and still others (in the genus
Hymenolepis) can continue the cycle without leaving the host.
The largest number found in one bird was at least 16 (of two species) in
a Turdus merula (European Blackbird). This bird had terrible diarrhoea
and ate voraciously. After removal of the worms, its food intake dropped
to about 30% of the previous level. It is questionable what harm a few
worms might do, but they certainly do not do any good. At any rate, treat-
ment is so easy--why put up with them ? Treatment is also easier than
diagnosis, which is better done visually afterwards.
The treatment of choice is niclosamide, a remarkably safe and efficient
compound. It comes in a 500 mg. tablet. Give small birds (under 100 g.)
about  |of a tablet, or as large a piece as they can swallow. Larger birds get
l tablet. Push the piece right down the throat, followed by a drop or two of
water. Hold the beak closed until it is swallowed. Copsychus in particular
can cough up indigestible matter, so it may help to follow the pill with some
food as well as water. Food does not affect niclosamide, which is not
absorbed from the intestine. Birds should be treated again in a week to ten
days to get rid of Hymenolepis , because of a peculiarity in its life cycle.
One dose gets rid of all other tapeworms.
As with other medication, I find that large doses are best and I have
given birds the equivalent of 2,500 mg./kg. with no ill effect. This is in the
order of 60 times the human dose.
If you are keen, you can find the worms in the droppings. They are
ejected with the remains of the tablet in from 20 minutes to 3 hours,
mostly around i-xj hours. When newly passed they are contracted to a
carrot shape of about one third of the normal length with averages 30 mm.
for the commonest species. They are best found by drawing a toothpick
through the droppings, for they are the same whitish colour as the tablet
base. The tapeworms are flaccid and easily broken, and are 1 mm. wide at
the tail (fat) end.
Occasionally a few Syngamus (gapeworm) were found in Turdus species.
This well known worm inhabits the windpipe (trachea) in Y-shaped pairs.
The small arm of the Y is the male, joined to his mate in permanent unholy
wedlock. They were readily removed by thiabendazole which was inad-
vertently given at first in a huge overdose of almost 1 mg./g. in food. No ill
effects were seen, but later it was administered by simply washing a pinch
of powder down the throat. Treat once on two successive days.
Ascarids ("common" roundworms) have not been a problem in my
birds. I am amazed when I read reports of these in parrots, (presumably
ground-feeding species). These worms are alien to that group of birds,
and the problem is one of management and hygiene.
Pyrantel (P. embonate or P. pamoate) is safe and efficient, more so than
the older piperazine compounds. I have given up to 1 ml. (50 mg.) of
suspension to a bird weighing 20 g. with no ill effect. The substance comes

in tablets and a suspension. This is pleasant tasting (for a change) and a
drop or two is put right down the throat with a dropper. As the suspension
is rather thick, you may find it easier to administer after diluting it half-
and-half with water. The reason for using the suspension is that it cannot
be coughed up like the tablet form. This substance has been reported to
clear out some strongyloid worms and its safety is due to its negligible
absorption.
You will have noticed that a variety of compounds have been needed,
each working mainly on one group of parasites. Because of the different
life cycles of all the parasites, it would not be possible to reach them with
one substance. The relatively new product mebendazole has the widest
range so far against intestinal parasites. It takes over from thiabendazole,
has a good safety margin and is the first safe substance to work against the
genus Capillaria. It also removes ascarids and some strongyloids and
perhaps other nematodes. There have been reports of partial success I
against the intestinal protozoan Giardia as well as some tapeworms, but
only after several days of treatment. I only recently obtained mebendazole
(Vermox--Ortho Ltd.) and used it on the aforementioned Eurasian Jays.
Previous treatment with metronidazole completely suppressed production
of Capillaria eggs, but these returned slowly, though not in the previous
numbers and I think that some worms must have been killed. A three-day
treatment with Vermox (once per day) removed the remaining worms.
Even the manufacturers are rather vague about how much of this substance
is absorbed into the bloodstream, but at any rate it seems very safe and
enough is absorbed to remove Tetrameres from the proventriculus, although
direct diffusion into the proventriculus wall may be sufficient. It would be
worth trying on non-intestinal nematodes. The compound works by
blocking glucose uptake by the parasite which eventually runs out of
energy, but as this does not happen right away, three days of treatment will
be required. The jays coughed up the piece of pill so often that I eventually
gave it crushed in milk. There is no interference with the assimilation of
glucose by the host and glucose in food apparently has no effect on treat-
ment--actually I used a honey and milk nectar.
The only other internal parasites that I have had trouble with were lung
mites and these only in Gouldian Finches, the details of which were
reported in the Magazine (vol. 84, No. 1, p. 56). The main symptom was
persistent sneezing and this was eradicated within 48 hours by putting the
birds into a small enclosed cage with a 19% Dichlorvos strip. No ill effects
were seen in a long follow-up and this treatment will successfully deal with
all external mites, lice, etc. I have had only a few cases of mites and have
seen feather lice only once--on Garrulax canorum newly brought from
Hong Kong.
These notes cover most of the parasites encountered in the writer's
collection. With the present restrictions on the availability of birds, we can
no longer live with the huge losses often seen in shipments--particularly

By R. M. Alison (Toronto, Ontario)
Among the more contentious and therefore deliciously debatable matters
currently preoccupying bureaucrats and decision-makers in wildlife
departments, aviculture has loomed to the forefront, not, as one might
imagine, owing to the popularity of that activity among the public but
rather due to its singular unpopularity among the personnel of government
agencies. Such an unfortunate distaste manifested by conservation depart-
ments, particularly in North America, stems primarily from disproportion-
ate representation among decision-making staff favouring individuals who
hunt or trap but do not personally participate in aviculture and therefore
cannot comprehend the satisfaction which that activity can provide.
Since non-participants in any activity rarely condone its performance
by others, the current over-abundance of non-aviculturists comprising the
policy-giving bodies of virtually every wildlife agency on the North
American continent, has ensured minimum official enthusiasm in favour
of promoting interest or increased participation in what is viewed as a
scurvy, and generally negative behaviour. Curiously, die most common
criticisms of aviculturists in recent years have been levied by hunters, who,
on moral grounds, promulgate the absurd proposition that whereas live
wild animals should not be confined to cages of whatever luxuriance, their
lifeless corpses may properly occupy the frying pans and ovens of those
who killed them in the name of sport.
The purpose of this document is to present evidence in support of the
contention that aviculture is a deeply-rooted human behaviour, having
occurred in every civilisation for which a recorded history exists. However,
since, in the interest of conservation of space, it would be quite impossible
to adequately document the popularity of that activity in each of the 21
known civilisations, certain representative societies have been selected.
Egyptian civilisation
Among the early Egyptian nobility, especially the Pharaoh and his
family, aviculture was enthusiastically pursued, typically on a grand scale.
Depictions of great gardens, hosting endemic as well as exotic birds,
adorned the walls of tombs and other structures dating to the earliest
Pharaohs. Supportive textual information, in the form of monument

inscriptions, dedications and other such material, is available, relative
particularly to the New Kingdom period (after 1788 B.c.).
Large pleasure gardens almost invariably occurred on the estates of
wealthy Egyptians, such gardens being most often enclosed by walls of
varying dimensions. Each garden featured extensive arrays of plants and
animals, the resulting vivarium being a source of great pride to the owner.
Although birds are most often mentioned in references to Egyptian vivaria,
other animals, including lions, and other favoured quarry species often
inhabited such enclosures. Frequently, one or more artificial lakes, ponds
or marshes were constructed. In such instances, waterfowl were released in
order that they might reside therein. Although enclosed marshes were
almost invariably reserved for aviculture or hunting, larger bodies of water
served as recreational areas in which fishing, boating and other activities
occurred in harmony with aviculture.
Among the largest such pleasure lakes was one constructed by Amen-
hotep III (141X-1375 b.c.):
"His majesty commanded to make a lake
for the Great Kings Wife, Tiy... Its
length is 3700 cubits; its width, 700
cubits." (Breasted 1906).
Other references to similar creations abound:
"(Mernere, 2570-2566 b.c.) I dug a
lake before it (Medinet Habu Temple),
flooded with Celestial Water, planted
with trees and vegetation." (op. cit.)
"(Ramses III) I made for thee groves
and arbors ... lakes supplied with lotus
flowers, papyrus flowers, isi flowers,
the flowers of every land, dedmet flowers,
and sweet fragrant woods." (op. cit)
"(Akhnaton, 1375-1358 B.c.) East of the
palace shone the great pleasure garden
... of two large walled enclosures ... there
was a small artificial lake set amidst
trees ... the beauties of nature were
gathered there." (Weigall 1910).
Even though some texts fail to mention the avicultural context in which
Egyptian pleasure lakes, gardens and marshes occurred, other documenta-
tion reveals not only the frequency with which birds were an integral
component, but also the numbers of birds present.

A coffin., dating to the period of the Middle Kingdom (2160-1788 B.c.),
in a description of paradise, includes a brief reference to the avian in-
habitants of two artificial lakes (Pritchard 1955):
"Its south is the pool of the Kha-
birds, in the place where Re sails
with the breeze: its north is the
waters of the ro-fowl."
Additional evidence is provided by two New Kingdom monument
inscriptions:
"(Ramses II, 1292-1225 b.c.) I
levied for thee wild fowl from
the enclosed marshes; others ...
for maintaining those that were
hatched." {op. cit.)
"(Ramses III) I have collected
gardens ... of wild fowl descending
into the pool." {op. cit.)
According to a list of property detailed by a scribe of Ramses III, that
monarch owned 433 such gardens.
Sometimes collections of captive birds occurred at temples and other
religious structures:
"(Apries, 588-569 b.c.) I have
splendidly equipped your temple
with numerous ... ducks and geese;
I have made secure their maintenance
by an endowment of lands, as well
as their custodians forever."
{op. cit.)
Some birds in avicultural collections were apparently encouraged to
breed, their progeny being maintained in captivity. However, breeding
stock was often replenished through imposing quotas upon professional
Egyptian fowlers. Lists of such quotas indicate that large numbers of live
birds were demanded, not only for use in avicultural gardens, but also
for other purposes:
"(Ramses III) Water-fowl of the impost
of fowlers--426,995."
"(Ramses III) Live geese, 269; live

live pedet-birds, 21,700; live secha-
birds, 1,240; doves, 6,510." (op. cit.)
Since the maintenance of collections of live birds would require appro-
priate caretaking staff, it is not unusual to unearth references to the names
of important animal custodians. Sehetepibre, for example, bore the title
"overseer of the two pleasure-marshes . . ." during the reign of Sesostris
III (1887-1849 B.C.).
Chinese civilisation
References attesting to avicultural interest in early China are more or
less identical to those which occur in the memorabilia of early Egypt, except
that collections tended to be more varied, stressing not only birds, but
mammals and other wild fauna. There is no reason to believe that the
Chinese fascination with viviculture in general was more nor less fervent
than that manifested in Egypt.
"The earliest Chinese gardens of which
we have any knowledge are those of
Kings and great lords of Chou. They
seemed to have been stocked with
every sort of bird and beast and were
at once hunting parks, zoological
gardens and places for recreation."
(Schafer 1977).
Mesopotamia
Avicultural activity must have regularly occurred during the period of
Hittite influence since the first law meting out penalties for theft of captive
birds dates to a 19th century b.c. Hittite tablet:
"If anyone steals a bird from a
pond or a trained..., they would
formerly give x shekels of silver.
Now he shall give 12 shekels of
silver and pledge his estate as
security." (Pritchard 1955)

<bodyText confidence="0.99889545" page_id="56386879"  page_num="217" year="" vol="">
Evidently, theft of birds from avicultural collections was not considered
a minor transgression. Other Hittite records pertinent to captive birds are
infrequently encountered.
However, the art and literature of the period of Assyrian dominance are
suggestive of the popularity of aviculture among the wealthy inhabitants of
Nineveh and Babylon. A stone slab from the palace of the Assyrian king
Assurbanipal (668-627 b.c.) depicting a banquet in the royal garden
(Barnett 1976) shows birds of unidentifiable species roosting among trees,
vines and other vegetation.
Among written Assyrian records, by far the most useful, comprises a
text dedicated to Sennacherib (705-681 b.c.) :
"I, Sennacherib, King of Assyria... in
Nineveh, my royal city... made a swamp
and set out cane-brake therein. Igiru-
birds, wild-swine, beasts of the forest,
I let loose therein... Within the
orchards, the vines, every fruit bearing
tree, and herbs throne luxuriously.
The cypress and musukannu-tree, all kinds
of trees, grew large and sent out many
shoots; the cane-brakes developed
rapidly; the birds of heaven, the igiru-
birds, built these nests, and the wild-
swine and beasts of the forest brought
forth their young in abundance." (Luckenbill 1924).
In another translation of the same text, the phrase "wild birds, even
herons, nested there." (Gelb et al. 1964) occurs.
Obviously, the Assyrians shared the prevalent Egyptian interest in
sumptuous gardens, the faunal inhabitants of which were mainly captured
by professional trappers and subsequently transported to a release site
within the enclosure. An anonymous Babylonian hymn makes reference to
an official who bears the title "capturers of the bird" and an Assyrian
cuneiform inscription refers to:
"the net that catches... fowl, which
brings in wealth, brings wealth to
you." {op. cit.)
Furthermore, the Cyrus Cyllinder, currently housed in the British
Museum, contains a passage informing readers that:
"Barley given for feed for ducks and
doves (was) received by (a personal

name)... of the fowl run."
A reference to "feed for the ducks given to the man in charge of the
fowl run" also occurs {op. cit .)
Finally, an Assyrian inscription dating to the early period of dominance
by Nineveh noted:
"total of 242 ducks in the duck pen
at the disposal of..." (Strassmaier 1940).
It is quite certain that wild ducks were meant in such texts, since domestic
ducks were referred to as poultry.
Greek civilisation
It was quite common among the Greeks to keep birds and make gifts of
birds that could be maintained in captivity. Indeed, avicultural interest
was not confined to mere mortal men since, in the Odyssey, Homer had
Penelope say "it cheers me to look at them" with reference to her flock of
captive geese.
Apparently exotic and endemic birds were kept by Greek aviculturists.
"It is not clear that any of the kinds
of duck kept by the Greeks (mallard,
coot, teal) w r as of foreign origin.
Aristotle and Athenaeus mention... the
Black-necked grebe (which was) hard
to catch, an ornament to any pond...
In the 5th Century B.c. there was
imported the Egyptian goose, which
the Greeks called 'foxgoose'..." (Jennison 1937).
According to Aristophanes, cranes, sparrows, Nightingales, blackbirds,
pies and starlings were preferred by Greek aviculturists. Prices varied
according to species; a live Chough could be purchased in the Athenian
market for an obol whereas a crow might cost three obols.
The African Purple Gallinule, which the Greeks called 'porphyrion',
was very commonly kept, probably owing to its beauty. Bird fanciers
apparently recorded its behaviour with keen interest {op. cit.).
According to Clytus of Miletus, a student of Aristotle, guinea fowl were
kept in the enclosed marshes near the temple of Artemis on the Island of
Leros. Among other exotics, the peafowl was exceedingly popular subse-
quent to its first appearance in the Athenian market about 450 B.c., at
which time a pair of this species sold for about #330.
Greek literature dealing with aviculture does little more than to suggest
those species of special interest to fanciers. Nonetheless, it is evident that

avicultural collections were commonly maintained in large enclosed
gardens similar to those of Egypt and Assyria, references to which permeate
Greek literature.
It was during the period of Greek influence that pigeon-keeping became
popular, possibly as a result of the escape of a large number of white
pigeons from wrecked Persian vessels comprising a defeated fleet near
Mount Athos in 492 b.c. According to Aristotle, the peleias (Stock Dove ?)
and the peristera (Rock Pigeon) were the most suitable pigeons for
domestication.
Roman civilisation
Reference to aviculture in Roman art and literature indicates an acute
fondness, primarily among wealthy Romans, for collecting and breeding
wild birds in large enclosed gardens. Perhaps the richest depictions occur
among the floor mosaics of Antioch, created during the Roman period.
Among the most impressive pavements are the Megalopsychia Hunt scene
(Lavin 1963, plate 7) and the Martyrium of Seleucia scene {op. cit ., plate 5),
in both of which birds are shown in what appears to be large well vegetated
gardens. A contemporary Carthaginian "Maison de la Voliere" pavement
vividly portrays an aviary in which pheasants, peafowl, geese and other
birds abound {op. cit., plate 31).
"The first notable collection of birds
of all kinds to be made in Italy for
the owners amusement is said to have
been that of M. Laenius Strabo, a
knight who lived at Brundisium in the
earlier half of the first century b.c.
this kind of aviary soon became the
fashion... Q. Cicero, the brother of
the dictator (had) an avariam in 54
B.c-Varro made an aviary in the
grounds of his villa at Casinium: it
was a high walled enclosure where he
kept birds of all sorts, especially
sangsters such as nightengales and
blackbirds; it contained a duck pond."
(Jennison 1937).
Waterfowl were very frequently included in avicultural collections.
According to Columella {ca. a.d. 50):
.. Those birds which the Greeks call
'amphibious'... Of this type of bird
the goose is particularly acceptable.

R. M. ALISON---EARLIEST RECORDS OF AVICULTURE
Those who desire to possess flocks of
swimming birds establish goose-pens."
Ducks were also regularly maintained, captive stock comprising birds
hatched from wild-taken eggs
"Mallard, teal, pochard and coots and
similar birds ... can be kept in captivity
... When anyone wishes to establish a
place for rearing ducks (it is important)
to collect eggs of... wild fowls in the
region of the marshes, where they usually
lay, and set them under farmyard hens."
(op. cit.)
The most popular birds kept by Roman aviculturists were "geese, the
pintail, the boscis or common duck, the mallard and teal; Guinea fowl;
peafowl . . . from the first century B.c.; cranes (which were) trapped
throughout Italy; purple galinule; pelicans; partridges . . . infrequently;
blackbirds, goldfinch (especially by young boys); thrushes; bullfinches;
starlings . . . Caesar had a starling which was taught Greek and Latin
words; ravens . . . Octavian once bought a talking raven for = #155;
parrots ... from India." (op. cit.)
Ravens were particularly popular pets among poor Romans. Further-
more, the unusually large number of Raven bones found at Roman
archaeological sites in Britain is, likely, a result of the popularity of Ravens
as pets among Roman soldiers.
According to Pliny, the prices demanded for birds precluded avicultural
participation by all but the very wealthy:
"(Nightengales) fetch prices that are
given for slaves, and indeed larger
prices than were paid for armour-
bearers in old days. I know of one
bird... that was sold for 600,000
sesteries to be given as a present
to the emperor Claudius' consort
Agrippina."
"(Thrushes) are kept in every country
district... in which they have been
caught... Marcus Terentius informs us
these birds were often bought for three
denarii a piece in our grandfathers
time." (Columella)

said... (and) the young princes (Britannicus
and Nero) had a starling and nightingales

Pigeon-keeping enjoyed universal popularity among Romans, the prac-
tice having been introduced as a result of Greek influence. According to
Varro, pigeon lofts were commonly constructed on the roofs of Roman
houses, such lofts often containing as many as 5,000 birds (Jennison 1937).
"Wood-pigeons and house-pigeons that
live in Dovecots ... Marcus Varro assures
us that a single pair used to be sold
for 1 ,ooo sesteries ... People can be
found to pay... in the present generation
... 4,000 nummi for a pair ..."
"Pigeon-fancying is carried to inane
lengths by some people: they build
towers on their roofs and tell stories
of the high breeding and pedigrees of
particular birds ... before Pompey's
civil war (49 B.c.) Lucius Axius ...
advertised pigeons for sale at 400
dinarii per brace..." (Pliny).
Aztec civilisation
Having dealt exclusively with Old World societies, it would seem
desirable to examine the records of a New World civilisation, one which
was presumably untouched by European influences. The abortive Aztec
Empire left scant records pertinent to their interest in aviculture, with the
exception of a few codices, some frames of which depict waterfowl in
artificial pools. It is known, however, that the Emperor Montezuma was
an avid aviculturist, since a description of his aviary was written by a
member of Cortes' invading army.
"Let us proceed to the Aviary, and I
am forced to abstain from enumerating
every kind of bird that was there, for
there was everything from the Royal
Eagle and other smaller eagles ... down

According to Solis (1686):

them,... he had all sorts of birds
which New Spain produced ... The Sea
Fowl were preserved in salt water

numbers, and the care of preserving
them so great, that it gave employment
to about 300 men, skilled in the
knowledge of their diseases, and
obliged to supply them with such food
as they used to eat when they were at
liberty."
The expression, "when they were at liberty" suggests that the species
involved were indeed wild birds, not poultry.
In addition, it is known that whereas wealthy Aztecs engaged in avi-
cultural pursuits, the poor were prevented from so doing by virtue of the
high cost of purchasing and maintaining birds. No Aztec, except the
Emperor, was permitted to keep the Quetzal--the punishment for posses-
sion of a Quetzal was death.
Birds for aviaries were captured in nets on Lake Texcoco and depictions
of capture methods have survived in the form of Mexican manuscript
paintings, especially Book II of the codex florentino, currently housed
in the Laurential library in Florence.
The purpose of this paper was not to present an exhaustive documenta-
tion illustrating the occurrence of aviculture in any particular society, but
rather to suggest, through presentation of selected supportive evidence,
that in those civilisations briefly examined, men have showed a remarkably
similar disposition towards keeping wild birds in captivity, the motivation
for which is an uninvestigated phenomenon. It is assumed that it will not
be necessary to traipse before sceptics a similar volume of illustrative
documentation relative to each of the other civilisations which have
existed to date. Such evidence does exist. However, surely the data
presented induce the well-grounded suspicion that man has manifested a

THE GOULDIAN FINCH: A COMPLETE LIST OF MATING
EXPECTATIONS
</sectionHeader>

By M. S. Wrenn (Bartley Green, Birmingham)
In recent years the breeding of the Gouldian Finch Chloebia gouldiae
may be said to have undergone an explosion. The problems of mortality
during the moult and unexpectedly at other times appear largely to have
been overcome. Doubtless the Australian Finch Society will soon declare
the species to be domesticated. I therefore feel the time to be opportune to
publish a list of matings involving the mutations currently available. An
A.F.S. publication by N. Heap deals accurately with the subject, but
suffers from the dual disadvantages that the matings are described in
symbolic form and that percentages of progeny are not quoted. The latter
omission is the more serious since someone considering a breeding pro-
gramme will wish to know whether or not his proposed course of action is
likely to meet with success. If he knows that the probability is only 6J%,
he may wish to select alternative matings.
In this work I hope to present in an easily understood way all the
matings between the three head colours which, by the use of Appendix D,
can be extended to include the white-breasted mutation, and the following
list of expectations is a complete record of all 54 types of mating between
the three head colours--red, black and orange. It must be understood that
the results of any one pairing will seldom agree exactly with the percent-
ages quoted. This point is almost self evident since, in matings such as 8,
the number of possible genetic forms of Gouldian Finch is far greater than
the average clutch size. The expectations will be found to be true when
averaged over many pairings.
The normal Gouldian Finch is considered to be the red-headed form.
It is the most abundant head colour to be found in captivity.
The black-headed mutation is sex-linked and recessive. Both red- and
black-headed have red tipped beaks.
The orange-headed mutation is recessive. Its effect on the red-headed
form is to produce an orange head with a yellow-tipped beak; and on the
black-headed form the only visual effect is to give a yellow tip to the beak;
the head colour remains black.
In the table, the following abbreviations are used. Terms starting with a
capital give a birds head and beak colour.
"Red" indicates a red- headed Gouldian with a red tipped beak
Black , a black- ,, , , ,, red ,, ,,
"Orange" , an orange- , , , , yellow , ,
"Black Y.T.B." , a black- , , , , yellow , ,
A diagonal bar "/" indicates that the bird is carrying one or more
recessive mutations. In speech we say that the bird is "carrying" or "split
for" the recessive mutations listed.

The term before the bar gives the visual head and beak colours. The
colours after the bar are the mutations being carried in hidden form. For
example "Red" indicates a red-headed Gouldian carrying neither of the
other mutations, "Black/orange" indicates a visually black-headed
Gouldian carrying the recessive orange mutation.
Note 1.--Throughout this article the orange-headed Gouldian is to be
considered synonymous with the yellow-headed. I feel that the colour
orange better describes the observed head colour.
Note 2.--When in breeding condition the beak colour of hen Gouldians
becomes almost black. Since black heads occur with either red or yellow-
tipped beaks it is necessary to observe and note the beak colour of hen
black-headed at an early stage.

Matings with the same expectations
Twelve pairs of matings have been listed as having the same expecta-
tions, namely 3 and 5, 4 and 6,10 and 12, n and 15,14 and 16, 22 and 24,
23 and 25,33 and 35, 38 and 42,39 and 43,40 and 44,41 and 45.
In addition there are a further six pairs of matings with the same
expectations that occur widely separated in the list. These are 28 and 49,
29 and 50,30 and 51, 31 and 52,34 and 46,37 and 47.
Thus the 54 different matings produce only 36 different expectations.

<bodyText confidence="0.982452909090909" page_id="56386891"  page_num="229" year="" vol="">
This is difficult. Only no. 1 of the eight matings gives 100% pure
red-heads. Cocks may be split for black or orange or both, and hens may
be split for orange. All birds would require test matings for orange; split
black cocks would reveal this by producing a proportion of black-headed
hens.
b) Black-headed
Every mating between two black-heads gives only black-headed young.
The presence of the orange mutation may be revealed by yellow-tipped
beaks.
c) Orange-headed
Establishing a strain of orange-heads is relatively simple. Cocks that
are split black are shown to be so by producing black-headed hens.
Discarding all such cocks, and obtaining new blood by getting only
orange-headed hens will produce the required strain.
2 Matings that give all three head colours
Six matings 8, 27, 31, 41, 45 and 52 yield hens of all three colours; but
only 27, 31 and 52 will produce both cocks and hens of all three head
colours.

The white-breasted mutation
White-breasted forms of all three varieties of head colour can be, and
have been, bred. The mutation is recessive, and is not sex-linked. It acts
quite independently of the head colour mutations in the following manner:
Using N to represent normal or non-white-breasted and w to represent
white-breasted, matings can be divided into six categories

<figure confidence="0.916377" page_id="56386892"  page_num="230" year="" vol="">

d) wxN = 100%N/w
e) w x N/w = 50% w, 50% N/w
f) wxw = 100%w
When the white-breasted mutation is involved, the above matings must
be used in conjunction with the matings list.

For example, the result of pairing a black-headed white-breasted cock
to a red-headed hen split for white-breasted is obtained from 32 and (e);
32 deals with the different head colours and (e) with the white-breasted

I have not conducted a literature survey to determine who first deduced the
manner of inheritance of the black-headed, orange-headed and white-breasted
mutations. My sources for this information have been the works of N. Heap and
K. Immelmann and personal discussion with R. Murray supported by my own
breeding records.
The most entertaining and readable text-book I have found to demonstrate the
principles of genetics and to illustrate the universality of these ideas is the book of
Charlotte Auerbach.

LONGEVITY OF A KING EIDER
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.997387090909091" page_id="56386894"  page_num="232" year="" vol="">
In 1965 the Berlin Zoo got a single adult male King Eider Somateria
spectabilis from Tiergrotten Bremerhaven, West Germany and this bird
died in autumn 1978 because of infirmity due to age. The age of this bird
is remarkable because ducks of the northern palaearctic are usually sensi-
tive to air pollution in warmer inland regions.
The King Eider did well all the time and he lived peacefully together
with Common Eiders, Barrow's Goldeneyes, Goldeneyes and a pair of
Coscoroba Swans. The food of these birds consists of softened bread,
chicken-pellets and meat of shellfish and crabs occasionally. Ten kilos of
this food is mixed with 500 grams of salt. Although the King Eider made
courtship to the female Common Eiders, copulation was never observed.

REVIEW
WORLD PHEASANT ASSOCIATION JOURNAL HI, 1977-1978.
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999199219512195" page_id="56386895"  page_num="233" year="" vol="">
Published by the World Pheasant Association. 1978. Pp. 127: 6 col.
pis., photos and drawings. #4.50.
The Association's second Journal (1976-1977) was reviewed here in
vol. 833 no. 3 and this third one follows the same general pattern, com-
mencing with a review of the year's progress in the many projects under-
taken by the Association concerning Galliformes in the wild in many
parts of the world as well as plans and programmes, such as the studbook
of Edwards's Pheasant, for the captive birds.
Papers on four species that are among the most interesting of the Order
are included, the first being on the Ocellated Turkey, information on its
natural history, its history in aviculture, its requirements in captivity and
its by no means easy rearing being given.
The megapode Megapodius freycinet , sometimes called the Common
Scrub Hen, sometimes Junglefowl, which occurs on so many of the islands
in the New Guinea area and indeed has been said to range from the Nico-
bar Islands in the Bay of Bengal to central Polynesia and from the Philip-
pines to northern coastal Australia, though there appears some indecision
as to which of the forms constitute M. freycinet , and in this respect the
caption of the map might give the impression that eastern New Guinea
and surrounding islands are the entire range of this remarkable species.
However, the purpose of the paper is not so much to show the distribution
as the known areas of its breeding in the islands of Papua New Guinea.
Studies of the Crested Argus Pheasant Rheinartia ocellata on one of the
mountains in central Malaysia reveal that it appears to be in some numbers
in a comparatively narrow altitudinal belt of rain forest on this particular
mountainside. The status of the other subspecies in central Annam is
presumably unknown.
The fourth species is the Maleo Megacephalon maleo studied on the
island of Sulawesi in Indonesia, the nesting, incubation and population
being described and suggestions made for its much needed further pro-
tection from the egg poachers who can easily find where the Maleo has
buried its eggs. The other megapode on this island is M. freycinet , not
apparently so seriously threatened as yet, its eggs being more difficult to
find. One wonders which is the correct generic name, Megacephalon as
given in a new dictionary of birds or Macrocephalon as given in this
paper.
Game bird nutrition (25 years of study) is the subject of a detailed paper
and it is evident that exhaustive work has been done. No doubt much of
the findings would be applicable to species other than those examined,
different though their natural diets may be.
Valuable advice on inbreeding, how and why to inbreed for outcrosses.

is particularly important, naturally, where great rarities are concerned.
The domestic fowl is presumably outside the ambit of the W.P.A., but
perhaps at the time of the Iron Age Gallus gallus was hardly domesticated.
At any rate it is deduced from bone remains that this species was kept in
this country then and this is the subject of the next paper, followed by one
on the techniques of artificial incubation of game bird eggs as well as the
pre-incubation storage. This needs to be read in conjunction with the same
author's article in the previous Journal. It is interesting to compare the
requirements of these eggs with those of the megapodes which, of course,
are never turned during incubation, while the ventilation inside a mound
of rotting vegetation or loose sandy soil must be very different from that
needed by the eggs of most birds.
A census of grouse, quail, partridges and francolins in captivity shows
that, except for a few favoured species, they are little kept compared with
pheasants and it is a pity to see that Erckel's Francolin, fairly plentiful in
this country a few years ago, is now reduced to two, though no doubt there
are a few more about. Recommendations for the conservation of the two
endemic pheasants on Taiwan are given and there is a report on artificial
insemination of the Brown Eared Pheasant at Cambridge which gave
encouraging results. The value of correctly planted aviaries for pheasants
is explained and illustrations of the planting of pheasant aviaries in the
Jersey Zoological Park included. Apart from the pleasing effect of such
planting, it is reasonable to suppose that the birds are more likely to breed
in such an environment. Reviews and a list of articles published in the
periodic literature on the Galliformes are also included in this well-
produced Journal.

On the 23rd July some 60 members and guests visited Chestnut Lodge,
Cobham, at the kind invitation of Miss Ruth Ezra to see the fine collection
belonging to her and to Mr Raymond Sawyer. It would be impossible to
remember all the wide variety of species seen, but such tame and con-
spicuous birds as the Cocks of the Rock ( peruviana ), a White-fronted
Bee-eater, tanagers, flowerpeckers, sunbirds and many others, so well set
off in the planted aviaries, come readily to mind. In the largest flight the
lawn around a shallow pool is kept mown short and on this soft carpet of
grass the feet of some dozen or more waders of six or seven species keep in
perfect condition.
The species bred at Chestnut Lodge during the past year are six Satyr
Tragopans, five Palawan Peacock Pheasants, two Keas, four Schalow's
Turacos, five Gouldian Finches, six Rothschild's Grackles and two
Splendid Starlings. Among those that nested but did not produce young
were Flame-faced Tanager, Black-billed Weaver, Blue-shouldered Robin
Chat, Collared Sunbird (a nest almost entirely of feathers built inside a
nesting box) and, in the garden, the pale grey form of Crowned Crane.
Goldie's Lorikeets, Papuan Lories Charmosyna papou 5 Salvadori's and
Double-eyed Fig Parrots are among the species added since last year's
visit, but a pair of Yellow-collared Chlorophonias Chloraphonia flavirostris
living with hummingbirds in a planted flight inside the house, would
surely come near to being, in show parlance, the best foreign exhibit.

and spent a very enjoyable day there in perfect weather. A spectacular
feature of this large and varied collection is, of course, the macaws at
liberty which appear to do little damage to the trees, though such damage
might not be noticeable in so large a garden with its many fine trees. The
collection is so well displayed that practically every specimen can be seen,
many of them free about the gardens. A breeding success after some years
of failure was achieved this year with the Black-footed Penguins, due, it is
thought, to giving a diet more nutritious than fish alone when the young
were hatched.
The handsome, if noisy, Patagonian Conures make a fine exhibit as a
flock. The two specimens of Formosan Blue Pie Urocissa caerulea and the
single Swainson's Jay are evidently the only ones in this country and may
well be the last of these two species to be seen alive here.
A well-attended meeting at Burlington House in the evening of the
17th October enjoyed an illustrated talk by Mr and Mrs R. Bloom on
animal collecting in Kenya.

Members are urgently requested to contribute articles, long or short, of
avicultural or ornithological interest, that have not already been published
elsewhere. These need not, of course, be about rarities, for there is still
much to be learned about common species, even about the true wild forms
of domesticated birds, though, of course, the domesticated forms them-
selves are outside the scope of the Magazine.

BREEDING RED-BROWED FIG PARROTS
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.993903857142857" page_id="56386899"  page_num="237" year="" vol="">
The article on fig parrots by G. A. Smith (A.M. 83.3. 162-166) made
interesting reading. Breeding in confinement is rare and as far as I am
aware has only been achieved in two collections. Charles Everitt gives an
account on breeding the Double-eyed in his book birds of the marshall
boehm aviaries. Graham Taylor of Cairns, Queensland, managed to rear
nine Red-browed Fig Parrots over a three year period and I am grateful
to him for providing the following data and for allowing publication.
As males tended to fight, his birds were always kept in pairs and housed
in flights measuring 6x3x7 feet high. The diet consisted mainly of native
figs, supplemented with apple, pear and seed (sunflower, millet and
canary). In addition, chunks of rotten wood were provided which the
birds ripped apart in search of wood-boring insect larvae. Large stumps
of rotten wood were also provided for nesting into which they would
tunnel. Clutches of one to three eggs were recorded and the incubation of
approximately 17 days was undertaken by the female alone. Young
fledged at three weeks with total independence gained at three months.
Great emphasis was placed by Mr Taylor on an abundant supply of
native figs and wood-boring larvae while chicks were being reared and
suggested soaked dried figs as a substitute for the former. It may also be
worth experimenting with various forms of live food in the diet of these
parrots.

FACE-CLAWING IN PARROTS
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.998983733333333" page_id="56386900"  page_num="238" year="" vol="">
Simmons (1961) first described the parrot face-scratching behaviour of
face-clawing in an Illiger's Macaw Ara maracana. Face-clawing consists of
the parrot bringing one foot up directly (Simmons 1957) to the head region
and scratching the entire head and malar region with its four claws by
means of a series of slow and deliberate clenching and unclenchings of the
foot. During face-clawing the parrot maintains itself in a rest posture,
standing, of course, on one foot with the body feathers ruffled and its eyes
usually closed or half-closed. The feathers of the head and malar regions
are extremely ruffled, which allows direct access of the toenails to the skin.
To facilitate clawing of the entire head region, the head is turned to various
peculiar positions ranging from sideways to almost upside down.
During recent parrot behaviour studies, I have observed this behaviour
in a number of captive parrots at the San Diego Zoo, San Diego, California.
These have included the Scarlet Macaw Ara macao , Military Macaw Ara
militarise Yellow-naped Amazon Amazona ochrocephala auropalliata , White
Cockatoo Cacatua alba , Sulphur-crested Cockatoo Cacatua galerita , Little
Corella Cacatua sanguinea and the Yellow-tailed Black Cockatoo Calyp-
torhynchus funereus. This list suggests that face-clawing is common to
both the New World Arini and the Old World Cacatuini (Smith 1975).
Face-clawing was observed to occur while a parrot was resting or during
preening. The function of this behaviour is unclear. It appears to have
evolved from preening behaviour; however I do not believe that it serves
only for feather or skin maintenance: instead it appears that this has a
soothing effect on the parrot and acts to relax the bird.
Finally this behaviour might have some systematic value in the phylo-
genetic relationships among the Fsittaciformes. It would be interesting if
this list could be expanded to parrots of different genera. Possibly parrot
aviculturists could add to this list by noting this behaviour among their
birds. Also the observation of face-clawing by wild parrots is important,
as the possibility exists that this behaviour is the result of captivity.
