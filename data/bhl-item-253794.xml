(Amazona brasiliensis [Linn.))
By P. H. Maxwell (Whipsnade, Bedfordshire, England)
I have a specimen of the Blue-faced or Red-tailed Amazon Parrot
which I bought locally in Dunstable from the mother of a Merchant
Navy steward who had brought it from Brazil. This parrot is repre-
sented in the Bird Collection of the Natural History Museum, London,
by three specimens--two of which were in the London Zoo in 1883
and 1887, and the other is a wild-caught bird.
I have recently been in New York and while there visited the
American Museum of Natural History which has two specimens--
one was originally in Lord Rothschild's collection at Tring, previously
being at the London Zoo ; the other is a wild-caught bird. The
American Museum of Natural History has recently received a collection
from the area in Brazil where this bird occurs but there was no
specimen of it.
There is a coloured plate of the Blue-faced Amazon Parrot in the
Proceedings of the Zoological Society of London , 1880, page 22, but
Dr. Finsch was unable to see a specimen for his famous monograph
on parrots.
While in the U.S.A. I visited the Zoos at Bronx Park and Central
Park, New York, and the Zoo at San Diego, but was unable to find
specimens of this bird. If anyone in the U.S.A. has one in captivity
I should like to hear from him.
I keep my bird as a pet ; it is very amusing and talks well. The
plate illustrating this article is made from a coloured photograph.
The Blue-faced or Red-tailed Amazon is found in Southern Brazil
from Sao Paulo to Rio Grande do Sul.
The following description is taken from the British Museum Catalogue
of Birds , vol. xx, pp. 306-7 :--

By H. P. van Heyst (Groenlo, Holland)
During the season 1958, our Australian parrakeets in part failed
and in part bred very well.
1 . Crimson-winged Parrakeet ( Aprosmictus erythropterus )
Two years previously the older couple were imported direct from
Australia, and arrived, as is often the case with imported birds, in
very bad condition. With much care they were acclimatized here
slowly and surely and in 1958, for the first time, they came into
breeding condition. Eggs were not laid, however, and the season
passed without any result. I think that they were not satisfied
with the size of nest-boxes provided. The cock grew up into a
magnificent and affectionate mate and frequently fed the hen, but
that was all. It is well known that Crimson-winged Parrakeets like a
nest-box with a very long climb up, almost from ground-level, in a
hollow, perpendicular tree about 6 feet high. Next season I will change
the trees and give them a choice between two even more massive
original tree-trunks of different size and try again. A grandfather
clock also may do very well. Then we should have three chances and
this couple do show promise for the future.

H. P. VAN HEYST-THE " KIMPENKAMP " COLLECTION, HOLLAND 3
The second couple of Crimson-winged Parrakeets was a pair just
imported from the Netherlands' island of New Guinea (Indonesia) ;
the cock was in miserable condition and had a peculiar reddish colour
on the flanks ; the female was much better, but the right wing was
cut and she could not fly. A few months after arrival the cock died
and it was difficult to replace him. We had the good luck that a
German friend could help us by replacing the lost cock by one of his
own breeding, two years old and almost fully coloured. Meanwhile,
we had gradually removed, one by one, the cut wing feathers of the hen
and by the time the new cock arrived she had so far recovered as to
be able to fly normally. The couple were soon good friends, but it
was already too late for them to come into breeding condition as
acclimatization was not complete. I think that next season this couple
will also come into breeding condition.

<bodyText confidence="0.932615285714286" page_id="56315125"  page_num="3" year="" vol="">
Though imported three years previously from Australia, this pair
came into breeding condition for the first time in 1958 and the female
laid ten eggs on the ground. Six were fertile, but no foster-parents
were available, so we had no success. The next season I think things
will go much better as the pair are in good condition and friendly
to each other and will probably go readily to nest, if the right nest-box
tree is supplied and placed in the open aviary.

The two pairs of Princess of Wales' which have bred very well
year after year, and fed their young perfectly, failed in 1958. They
seem very erratic in this matter. Both pairs broke the eggs which
were almost all fertile. It is a pity and there seems to be no remedy.
Perhaps a less steep descent to the bottom of the nest-box might help
in this case. The cock of one of the pairs is so tame that he is a joy
to the collection ; he will eat from the hand and climbs up to one's

The two pairs have both done well. Both pairs bred twice and
each pair had five youngsters in each brood, making a total of twenty
fine young birds which all grew up very well.
5. Pennant's Parrakeet, or Crimson Rosella ( &apos;Platycercus elegans )
We have a very fine Pennant's female, which was mated to a cock
Pileated ; in 1957 they had four young hybrids and in 1958 also four
hybrids, of which three survived. So far as I know, this is the first
time that this cross has been made successfully and it can be considered
as a rarity. The hybrids have a soft beauty, the predominating colour

when they leave the nest is green on the back, still speckled with red
points on the head and on the rump, with a small amount of bluish
colour on the flight-feathers and the typical blue spots on the cheek,
which only occur in the Pennant's. The large beak is typical of the
male Pileated as is also the whole shape and temperament. The
next experiment will be to test whether the hybrids are fertile, but
much patience is necessary.
We do not generally like breeding hybrids, but we only had the cock
Pileated and could not get a female so we decided to cross the two.
Meanwhile we have the opportunity of obtaining some more specimens
of Pileated and hope to have several pairs very soon and then can give
the old female Pennant's a mate of her own and stop any further
breeding of hybrids. Another pair of young Pennant's did not come
into breeding condition.
6 . Brown's Parrakeet or Northern Rosella (Platycercus venustus)
Our pair is fully acclimatized, but successful breeding results are
rare. As is known, the Brown's has the curious habit of moulting during
the summer and after that the pair comes into breeding condition.
In out climate it becomes cold too soon for the young birds, or the
eggs do not hatch as they are infertile.

Our aviaries are of good length and each aviary has a covered shelter

By A. A. Prestwich (Southgate, England)
Golden and Amherst Pheasant hybrids are anathema to the
ornamental pheasant enthusiast. One would imagine that to a water-
fowl keeper the somewhat analogous Mandarin-Carolina cross would
be regarded similarly. But such is not the case, because the
remarkable fact is that these two species, supposedly so closely related,
show a very marked reluctance to mate successfully with each other.
Both Mandarins and Carolinas normally form strongly attached pairs,
but when the two species are associated it is not uncommon for them
to pair together, even though a mate of their own kind is available.
Any eggs that may be produced later are almost always, if not
invariably, infertile. It must be assumed that some genetic incom-
patibility makes fertilization unlikely, or even impossible. It is
extremely doubtful that any well-authenticated result has ever
followed such a union.
References are infrequent and, in the main, quite inconclusive.
All too often the various authorities merely repeat several ancient
references, without, one would imagine, checking them, as the majority
contribute little or nothing. Search through the literature reveals
the following " evidence " of crosses in which the Mandarin is reported
to have been one of the ducks involved.

clutches of eggs, laid by a Carolina duck mated with a Mandarin
drake, proved unfertile, as has been the case on several other occasions.

Finn (1904) says : " Of late years, however, if I recollect aright, a
hybrid was bred by one of our members, which did not live to attain
maturity." Probably the " hearsay " report of St. Quintin. Later he
writes : "I may say that our member Captain Boyd Horsbrugh,
A.S.C., has kindly written informing me that a brood of Mandarin-
Carolina hybrids was hatched at the Stephen's Green pond in Dublin,
but unfortunately all, he believes, were killed by a terrier. He does
not know which was the male parent. This at any rate shows that the
cross is not so very hard to obtain as might have seemed previously ;
but it is a pity that misfortune appears to attend the hybrids when
produced."
Horsbrugh (1910) mentions the Dublin event and says : "A male
Mandarin and a female Carolina paired some years ago and hatched
the young, but the hen bird was killed by a dog and the ducklings all
perished." The birds were in the charge of " Mr. Kearney, the
Superintendent, who is a most enthusiastic ornithologist ".
Delacour (1928) describes a visit to J. V. de Laveaga's collection
of waterfowl in San Francisco and writes (a free translation) : " Many
other hybrids have been reared there ; particularly a curious bird,
rather badly developed, which, in summer plumage, resembles a
Mandarin Duck, with more white on the chin and throat. It is a male
which was raised, the previous year, in a clutch of Carolinas.
Mr. de Laveaga tells me that in winter it assumes a bronzed dress,
fairly well mottled under the raised projections on the wings of the
Mandarin. He believes, and it is also my opinion, that it is a hybrid
between the Mandarin and Carolina, without, however, being able
to confirm it."
Carolina Duck x Mandarin Duck
Aix sponsa X Aix galericulata
On 22nd December, 1873, a " Hybrid Duck Bred between
Aix sponsa and Aix galericulata $ ", was presented by J. Charlton Parr
to the Zoological Society of London (1873, 1877).
The British Museum Catalogue (1895) gives " Anas sponsa $ X A.
galericulata $ ", again on the authority of Leverkiihn, who queries
which was the male parent.
Suchetet (1896) in a footnote says : C# Cross-breeding obtained in
both directions by several amateurs."
St. Quintin (1899) writes : " Some half-a-dozen years ago, one of
my full-winged Mandarin ducks paired with a full-winged Carolina
drake, and nested in the hollow bough of a tall elm tree ; five young
were hatched under a hen, and at the end of a fortnight were thriving,
but were all lost in one day through the unfortunate neglect of the
person in charge."

" This case of hybridization, which appears to us to be new to science,
has been observed in the menagerie of M. B. J. Muller of Amsterdam,
who owns a country-house in the neighbourhood of Harlem. This
amateur had, among other poultry, a pair of Canards a eventail
(A. galericulata). After the death of the female the male paired quite
willingly with a white domestic duck of the race we have just named.
From this union three young ones were born, which unfortunately were
killed by an ordinary drake some days after their birth. These hybrids
were covered with a yellow down varied with large speckles of
blackish-brown, from which we presume that, if they had remained
alive, they would have assumed a parti-coloured plumage and not a
white like their mother. Some months after the death of these young
ones, the male was devoured by some carnivorous animal."
Leverkuhn (1890) lists A. galericulata X A. domestica , with a note
" Only eggs laid ", and the British Museum Catalogue includes it

Phillips (1923-26) writes : " Although it [Red-head] has doubtless
been crossed with many other ducks in captivity, I know of only the
two following : the Ring-necked Duck and the Mandarin Duck.
Specimens of both these crosses went through the hands of a dealer,
Mr. G. D. Tilley, of Darien, Connecticut, in 1909."
The foregoing show that there is no concrete evidence of Mandarin
hybrids having been bred under anything like controlled conditions.
We must, therefore, have recourse to the unsatisfactory Scottish
verdict " Not proven ".

The explanation of the mystery, if such it may be called, is probably
to be found in the discovery by Yoshimaro Yamashina (1952), of the
Yamashina Ornithological Institute, Tokyo, that the Mandarin Duck
possesses a number of chromosomes differing from that of all other
Anatidae. This fact makes hybridization extremely unlikely, if not
actually impossible.

(.Aplonis panayensis strigatus)
By Frede Johansen (Bagsvaerd, Denmark)
My interest in insectivorous birds resulted in my getting hold of a
pair of Malay Glossy Starlings [Aplonis panayensis strigatus) in January,
1958. For a long time, I had wanted to own a pair of starlings because
of their amusing habits, beautiful colours, and their intelligence, and
when I had the opportunity of obtaining the above-mentioned rare
species--which had not been imported into this country before--
I could not resist the temptation and I have not regretted it. They are
beautiful birds and very peaceful towards smaller birds.
Both sexes are black all over, with a greenish metal sheen ; the
beak is black, the eyes are bright, light red with a thin yellow circle
round the pupils, and the legs are dull black. One bird is about the
size of a Danish Starling, but the female is a little smaller than the cock ;
the surest way of identifying the sex is by the cock's song, the tone of
which is both melodious and rather unmelodious. The female does
not sing.
The pair were put in the aviary in my sitting-room with my other
birds. In the course of a month, they showed interest in the nest-boxes
and especially in a tree stump I had placed there for my Agapornis
pullaria. I think it is almost certain that in the open they look for holes
in trees in which to build their nests. In my aviary they first built in
a large basket-nest ; later they became interested in a box, half open
in front, which was hanging at the same height under the loft. This
box was then filled with both coarse and fine nesting materials, but
the hen could not decide which nest-box to use and, in spite of the
fact that they were hung at each end of the aviary (which is 2 metres
long, 2 metres high, and 70 cm. wide), the pair continued to defend
both nest-boxes against the other birds. The cock sang busily with
his neck and beak stretched out in the air and finished by making an
attempt to mate. The hen, however, did not appear to want this and,
therefore, I tried giving more nourishing food, larger amounts of
mealworms--which were greedily devoured--fruit, and universal
mixture, and also fresh milk several times a day. This was also con-
sumed by all the other inhabitants of the aviary, including insect and
seed-eating birds.
This led to increased activity. The starlings constantly filled the
box with materials and the hen stayed in it a lot, but when I frequently
heard her scratching on the uncovered bottom of the box I realized
that something or other was lacking.
I tried her with some mash with forest earth. This was damped
down and put in the nest with the earth on top and I made a hollow

in it. In the course of a few days the earth was carried out again.
New methods had to be found--and then the hen herself found out
what was wrong. Round the base of the aviary there is a shelf with
green plants and flowers for decoration and one day I saw the female
actually picking a few leaves from a " Philodendron " which was
sticking in between the bars of the aviary. My wife loves the birds as
much as I do and is a great help in looking after them--but what would
she say to her equally beloved plants being stripped ? I was glad that
she was not home at this moment and I stuck more leaves between the
wires. These were all torn up in small pieces and taken up to the nest.
When my wife came home the plant did not look too good, but I got
her permission to put it in with the birds and after that one plant
after the other was put in the aviary. Several days went by and I
noticed that mating took place, but no eggs appeared. Hope was
diminishing when on 16th April, 1958, I noticed that the hen was
longer than usual in the box and when I investigated there were two
very light blue-green eggs with large reddish-brown spots, mostly on
one end. They were oval in shape and nearly identical in size ; the
length being 2*6 cm. and width 1 *8 cm. The same day the hen
was broody again, but no more eggs were laid. When I approached
to look at the nest she flew off, but was just as quick to return
immediately I went out of the aviary.
On 27th April egg-shells lay on the bottom of the aviary, still quite
fresh with slimy blood. The eggs, therefore, take eleven days to hatch.
Only one of them hatched, the other egg contained half an under-
developed dried-up embryo. The temperature of the room averaged
20-22* C. (central heating).
The young bird from the hatched egg was light red without down.
There was a good deal of dark, quite short hair on its back. It was in
good condition and was frequently fed by both the birds, especially
with mealworms which they either knocked or hit against the bars
before giving them to the young one. After the bird was fed I noticed
the hen took the excrement out of the nest in her beak and threw it to
the other side of the aviary.
As well as the mealworms--of which a great many were eaten--the
birds had universal mixture and fresh fruit every day apart from
which--and in no small quantities--they ate a great deal of smoked
herring which, personally, I think is an unnatural food. When on
1 st May I moved out, together with my birds, to my allotment--except
for the starlings--I had to go home every day for my meal. Because of
my work I could not get there till late in the morning and every time
I found the bowl there empty of mealworms. As I knew it had con-
tained a lot of mealworms--more than the birds could consume--this
seemed rather remarkable. After further investigation it appeared
that the mealworms, whose lives had been spared during the day,

reappeared when darkness came. With a death leap of i -5 metres
from the bowl, which hung on the wall of the aviary, to the bottom
of the aviary they sought refuge under the bathing bowl. I know them
so very well--they are mild creatures and what is the fun of being
devoured !
Meanwhile my own mealworms were giving out and when I wanted
to buy some more I found there was a scarcity of them. I was advised
to try smoked herring ; this was put to dry at one end of the aviary
and thus I was certain that there was enough food for the birds until
I got home !
On the tenth day the young bird's eyes began to open and the first
feather was visible. Some days went by and the chick grew and
developed. Excitement grew--when would it leave the nest ? I got
curious and impatient. One day when I went home to eat the weather
was fine and I opened the window to let in the sun and fresh air for
the birds. After my meal I went into the aviary to look at the birds,
but failed to shut the door properly after me. As I took down the
nesting-box and stood with it in my hand I discovered the hen bird
had flown out into the room. I immediately thought it would fly in
again but I was not allowed to be comforted by this thought for
long as suddenly she flew off and sat by the open window. Yes, there
she sat and enjoyed the view of the green trees in the garden. Heavens
above ! With trembling knees I left the aviary and prayed silently
to her to resist the attraction of green surroundings and to return
instead to her husband and child in the aviary. She must have heard
my prayer ; at any rate she returned to the aviary and I was able to
shut the door and get my knees back to normal.
This episode took away my desire to look at the nest more closely.
I constantly waited excitedly for the moment when the young bird
would leave the nest. When I had last seen it, it was seventeen days old
and more or less fully feathered and dull black with brownish eyes.
When four weeks had passed, and it still had not appeared, my
patience came to an end and I took the nest down and wanted to
take the bird out. My idea was to put the birds out in the aviary in
the garden where conditions were good and I thought they might
possibly start a new brood again. In the meantime, however, a new
egg lay by the side of the young bird and, as I could reckon on the
possibility of the hen laying one more, I let the nest and young bird
remain, with the object of removing the egg when she had finished
laying and then hope for a new brood when the birds came out into
the garden. Next day there were two eggs, one of which had been
trodden on and, as I discovered later, the other one had been
punctured. I, therefore, saw no reason to wait any longer and took
hold of the young bird to help it out, but that did not work, as
apparently the right leg had got tied up in a piece of bass and was

so tightly anchored that it took me five minutes to get it free. The
parents either thanked me or scolded me for doing this with squeaks
and squawks. I quickly left the aviary feeling as guilty as though
I myself had bound up the young bird. It could manage to fly though
not very well, and it checked its flight a bit at the sharp turnings.
After two days had passed it was making good progress.
As already stated, the young ones are dull coal-black in colour, but j
when they were about two and a half months old a few white feathers
appeared on the breast and abdomen among the otherwise pre-
dominantly dull black feathers.
The parents, together with the first young bird, were put out in the
open-air aviary on 5th June. Here the old birds chose an ordinary
large balloon nest hanging up under the covered part of the aviary.
The bottom of the nest was filled with strips of leaves, and on this base
the hen laid three eggs. On 28th June there were two young ones in
the nest, but the third young, which also hatched, died. The two young
ones thrived, it being a condition that the parents should help them-
selves liberally to animal feeding stuff, mealworms, ants' eggs, etc.
In addition they were given fruit such as apples, pears, and oranges.
After thirteen days one of these young ones disappeared ; probably it
fell out of the nest. The other bird left the nest when it was twenty-six
days old. It was larger and flew with more confidence than the young
one of the first brood and this was probably due to the fact that the
whole time they were given ants' eggs, and latterly queen ants were
on the menu.
A very extraordinary thing, however, is that the birds were
completely differently coloured to those from the first hatching.
The ones of the second brood must be described as being of variegated
grey-black above, whereas underneath, from the base of the bill to the
tip of the tail they were striped or patterned like marble in grey-black
and white. The eyes were brown and the legs coke-grey and the
beak appeared to be lighter than those of the first brood.
It is possible that the reason for the young ones variegated colouring
is that they were in the open-air aviary, as mentioned above, and had
access to more natural food.
In conclusion it must be mentioned that at three months old the
young bird from the first brood had the beginning of a red glint in
its eyes.

S. B. Kendall (Chertsey, Surrey, England)
As some readers may be aware I have for several years been
interested in breeding the larger parrot-like birds, in particular
cockatoos, and I started 1959 with adult pairs of Citron-crested and
Timor Cockatoos, Galahs, and Orange-winged Amazon Parrots. The
Citron-crests are the original pair with which I won the Society's
Medal in 1955 ; the Timors consist of the original medal-winning hen
with a fresh cock ; both the Galahs and Orange-winged Amazons
I have had for several years.
Of my remaining birds, my male Greater Sulphur-crest remains a
bachelor. I had a true pair for three or four years and the hen laid
a single egg in two successive years, but nothing was reared. The cock
is reputed to be about 60 years old, so that may be one reason for their
lack of success, and when the hen was killed by flying into the sharp
edge of a galvanized sheet I decided not to replace her. In my
opinion, they are just a little too big for the accommodation that most
of us can supply. I feel a little sorry for the solitary male, who apart
from being a most amusing mimic and accomplished talker, has an
undying hatred of me, principally, I believe, because I clean out his
quarters and otherwise disturb him. He is exceedingly territorially
conscious, an inveterate nest-scraper, and greatly resents interference.
For several years I have had two male Leadbeater's Cockatoos
which I value greatly as they were imported and are exceedingly
fine specimens of the bright-coloured race. After several attempts to
get them mates, which exercise in general reduced my faith in my
fellow man (it is surprising how often people of vast experience can
still sell a cock as a hen), I have recently been successful in getting
two hens and I hope for at least an attempt at breeding in i960.
A single male Maximilian's Parrot remains unmated. Very little
seems to have been recorded about this species, which in my experience
is much less difficult to keep in good condition and is much more
hardy than some people have suggested. Mine has wintered outside,
with no apparent ill effects, under conditions where the drinking-water
froze and in general seems no more difficult to keep than an Amazon.
My specimen has a great deal of birdy character ; he is tame but
exceedingly cautious, with no small ability to avoid situations which
he feels may bring him into undesirably close proximity to me.
As regards the breeding pairs, both the Citron-crests and the
Timors successfully reared two young, both, incidentally, being quite
obviously true pairs. The Galahs, which were in young plumage
when I bought them about five years ago, have shown no evidence at
all of wanting to nest. I am hoping to build a new aviary this winter
and to give them a complete change.

S. B. KENDALL-MY COCKATOOS IN 1 959
The excitement of the year was the Orange-winged Amazons which,
after several years inactivity, went to nest and laid (one egg ?). The egg ;
I saw seemed to me to be very small for the size of the bird and I was s
not altogether surprised when it disappeared. At all events I now
know I have an egg-laying hen and I have for some time become
increasingly convinced that I have a cock. As far as I can see the
species has been doubtfully bred on one occasion only.
It may be worth while for me now to give my general experiences
of the breeding of cockatoos with particular reference to my Citron- |
crests. My pair have now gone to nest in each of the last five years and
have fully reared on four occasions. On the exceptional occasion, which
was reported in an earlier issue of the Magazine, a young bird died
just before emerging. During that particular season the pair had j
suffered a series of vicissitudes (including some gross interference
from their owner) which would have made a successful rearing more
than remarkable.
Otherwise the pair goes to nest without any trouble at all. As a rule,
the nest-barrel is put in during late April or the first week of May
and they are both inside it within an hour (the time that it takes them
to bite away the soft-wood plug I leave in the entrance hole). Egg-
laying takes place within two or three weeks, young are likely to be
heard in mid-June and they emerge about ten weeks later (nearly
always when I am away on holiday). The clutch seems always to be
two and, with the exception mentioned above, I have yet to lose a
baby or have an infertile egg. Sexes among the young seem to be
equally distributed : I have had all combinations ; a true pair (as this
year), two cocks (qualified approval on my part), and two hens (great
rejoicing). A true pair is readily sexable at once. I think I could sex
any young bird when out of the nest. The eye of the hen starts to
become brown rather gradually. I have regrettably not kept very
careful notes, but it can be said that a year old hen will not have a
really black eye.
Experience with the Timors has been similar, except that as I lost
the original cock (again by accident, cockatoos once acclimatized
rarely seem to die any other way), the continuity of breeding has not
been so good. However, I am practically certain that my present
breeding cock was a baby when I got him three years ago so I can hope
for his long life.
As aviary birds these " white 55 cockatoos have very many advan-
tages. They are truly as hard as nails and exceedingly long-lived, so
that even if their rate of reproduction is low, the final result of a few
years' patience will be more rewarding than with some more fecund
species that live briefly and die easily. I have not so far been able to
glean any information on the Citron-crest in the wild and should
welcome any information at all. The late W. J. C. Frost, although

he knew the Lesser Sulphur-crest and the Timor, did not remember
having seen the Citron. If it is really confined to Sumba Island, its
future under natural conditions would seem very uncertain and it
seems a very suitable subject for maintenance in captivity. They are
exceedingly lovely birds, looking infinitely better when under aviary
conditions and when in true adult pairs, which are very demonstrative
one to the other, but I have had a caged one that was quietly beautiful
and exceedingly tame and easy to handle. Cockatoos of this size need
a reasonable amount of aviary accommodation, of course, but my
Timors breed and rear apparently excellent young in a flight 12 feet
long. The Citrons have a bigger place simply because that is where
they first bred and it seems inadvisable to move them, but I have no
doubt that they would breed in smaller quarters. The aviary must
naturally be beak-proof, but there is in practice now-a-days not so
much difference in cost between timber and angle-iron and there is a
wide range of excellent welded meshes available. From a cost point
of view, it is of course unfortunate that 2 in. mesh that will keep large
psittacines in won't keep sparrows out.
As regards disadvantages of the group, I have had a hen cockatoo
egg-bound on one occasion, but I imagine they are considerably more
free from this complaint than are most species. I have had one young
cockatoo " go wrong " with a loss of power in the wings and at one
stage the legs also. I have no explanation to offer. I rather doubt if
nutrition was involved, although I have subsequently added vitamins
to their soft food, which should, incidentally, be continued at least
over their first year. It certainly looked like a virus infection of the
" polio " type. I still have this bird. In most respects it looks perfect
and in a cage would defy inspection, but it can't fly and I doubt if it
ever will. There seems no reason why it should not breed. After
practical experience of birds that have only partially recovered flight
after injury, I am by no means convinced that effective flying is a
prerequisite for completely successful breeding. At all events my
bird is in very lovely condition and will do as a spare.
I think it would be fair to say, in conclusion, that the only major
difficulty I have experienced in the breeding of my cockatoos is in the
late (post-nest) stages of rearing. As is well known, the young appear
to be dependent for a terribly long time and after about ten weeks in
the nest will continue being fed for another two months or so. With
some species, I believe the dependent period is much longer. In my
experience, young hens are particularly tricky. In a previous issue of
our Magazine, I reported how a young hen Citron-crest of the 1955
year's breeding was mauled through the wires separating her aviary
from that of the parents. This year (1959) I nearly lost the young hen
when the family was still together. I have usually tried to {a) remove
the nesting barrel as soon as the young fledge and as a further insurance

against trouble (b) have moved the whole family to an adjacent aviary,
later putting the parents back into the original aviary by which time
the young know their way around. This year (1959) I carried out
operation (a) but not [b) and soon had a very unhappy baby hen. |

I left matters for a day or so (unwisely no doubt) and found the baby
hen (still dependent for food) with a bitten foot. I was forced into
action for which there seemed only one course ; the family was
divided, father and daughter and mother and son, and to my
enormous relief all has gone exceedingly well. The young, now self- j
supporting and on their own are the best so far bred, the cock in j
particular showing evidence of being bigger than his father. The
parents were later united without any trouble and with much display
and mating demonstration.
I very much hope that these notes will inspire others to write about
cockatoos. While I realize that the numbers kept are fairly limited,
there must be many who have kept and bred Galahs and Lead-
beater's. Notes on the dates when birds are allowed to go to nest,
approximate incubation periods, and the times when young become
self-supporting, together with notes on sexing are the raw materials
of successful aviculture. Experiences clearly differ and I realize it is
unwise to dogmatize or to draw general conclusions on the behaviour
of a group from experience with one or two species. Fairly recently
(.Foreign Birds , 24 (5), 232), Miss H. Diekmann of the Moscicki collection
wrote an account of the cockatoos which include two of the species
which I have bred. In this account, if I read it aright (" Like so many
of their relations a young Cockatoo still has a light iris when in adult
plumage. Therefore, it could quite easily happen that, after a year of
careful acclimatization, the ' pair ' should turn out to be two strapping
cocks."), the author's experience is that both sexes of cockatoo have a
light iris when young adults and that, in particular, this may be a
characteristic of the male. This is quite contrary to my experience
with Citron-crests and Timors (presumably, therefore, Lesser Sulphur-
crests in general). As I reported in the Magazine, 62 (1), 6, two young
Timors in the nest appeared to have dark eyes. In fact, in a good light,
these are seen to be grey. With hens, during the first and second years,
there is a progressive increase in brown (not black) pigmentation until
by about the third year the bird has an eye which is brown in colour.
The really red-brown eye that is seen in adult " white " cockatoo hens
must develop as they get even older. With the Citron-crests, as reported
in Avicultural Magazine, 61 (5), 226, the eyes of nestlings appear
dark and are in fact a dark grey, which is possibly not however as
intense as in the adult male. Yearling hens show the " grey clouding
with brown " eye seen in the Timors. Young males retain the dark
eye, which presumably intensifies its pigmentation as the bird gets
older and becomes sexually mature.

J. DELACOUR-BIRD NOTES FROM CLERES AND LOS ANGELES, 1959 I 7
In other words, young cockatoos of these species tend to have dark
eyes which get lighter (browner) in hens and darker (jet-black) in
cocks. If one has a bird with a dark eye, it may prove to be either a
cock or a hen : if a bird with a light eye it will be a hen.
Other points of my experience differ from those of Miss Diekmann,
e.g. height of the nesting site (my Citron-crests nest about 4 feet above
the ground), failure of pairs to roost under cover at night, the necessity
for a pair of birds to be in new quarters for at least three years before
they will attempt to nest and so on. Birds are adaptable things and
given the first necessity--a healthy sexed pair--I believe that cockatoos
will successfully breed under a wide range of conditions and of different
managements.
Could we have other people's experiences please ?

considerably during the last year by purchases and by birds reared
on the spot or in my Los Angeles aviaries. Among the newcomers
are a pair of Congo Peacocks, on loan from the Antwerp Zoo,
Hartlaub's Ducks, Ross and Schutti's Touracous from the Congo and
Collie's Magpie-Jays from Mexico. Rheas, including white ones, were
raised from grey parents, as well as many Green ( twenty), Black-
shouldered, White, and Common Peafowls, and various pheasants,
particularly fourteen Elliott's and eight Mikados, a species which is
becoming rare in captivity ; also ten of the yellow variety of the
Golden Pheasant, a new mutation established by Prof. A. Ghigi.
Blue Eared Pheasants were very prolific (nineteen).
Among the waterfowl, the most interesting births were those of
six Hawaiian and eight Philippine Mallards, Sharp-winged, Cinnamon,
Silver, and Brazilian Teal, and five Paradise Shelducks. A number of
lovebirds and doves were also reared.
This is probably the last report from my Los Angeles aviaries. I am
retiring as Director of the Department of History, Science and Art
of the Los Angeles County at the end of next summer, reaching then
the age limit. My intention for the future is to spend six months a year
at Cleres and in Europe, and the colder months (November to April),
between Los Angeles and New York. It will, therefore, be impossible
for me to keep my house, garden, and aviaries for such a short period
and I have reluctantly decided to sell them. Most of my birds will be
sent to Cleres next spring, if all goes as I expect.

1 8 J. DELACOUR BIRD NOTES FROM CLERES AND LOS ANGELES, 1 959
I have been successful with some rare doves, rearing eight Grey-
headed ( Geotrygon caniceps ) from one pair, seven Martinique (G. martini-
cana ), and eight Ruddy ( G . montano ) Quail Doves. By interbreeding
common and silver Diamond Doves, and mating their dark offspring
to silvers later on, I have raised over twenty Silvers. My experience
had been that pairs of Silvers bred poorly. A number of Cape,
Peruvian, Pygmy, and Blue Ground Doves were also reared, as well as
several Jamaican Violet-necked (Leptotila jamaicensis ) and Galapagos
Doves.
The following finches bred in the aviaries : Diamond, Parson,
Heck's, Longtailed, Masked, Gouldian, Plum-headed, Pectoral, and
Cuban Finches. Two pairs of Australian Blood Finches (phaeton ) have
reared sixteen young. They are pretty, but extremely aggressive little
birds as well, and each pair must be isolated in a small aviary. With
the exception of Quails and large Ground Doves, it is impossible to
associate any other birds with them. Diamond and Galapagos Doves
were persecuted and had to be removed. The chicks were reared
mostly on hard-boiled egg and grated meat, with green food and some
small insects that can be caught by the parents. I never fed them
mealworms.
I procured last spring a pair of curious small doves from the
highlands of Peru and northern Chile, Metriopelia ceciliae. They are
short-legged, pale brown mottled with whitish on the mantle, and their
eyes have large orange eyelids. I had kept these little doves at Cleres
in 1939. They lived in a very large planted aviary and a young one
was reared. But the nest had not been found. I believe I now possess
the key of this mysterious birth. My present birds have laid eggs in
parrakeets' boxes ! No doubt the species is a hole-nester despite the
fact that trees are scarce in their bleak, native country. I never could
find any reference to their nesting habits in bird literature. It is
probable that they lay in cavities of rocks and cliffs.
My large collection of Colombian and Central American Tanagers
and Sugar Birds is doing perfectly well in out-door aviaries, which
they share with Sunbirds (Taccazze and Johnston's), Cuban Trogans,
Jucunda Cotingas, Amethyst and Emerald Starlings, Fairy Bluebirds,
and other pretty species.

RAISING A YOUNG KING PENGUIN
IN CAPTIVITY

<bodyText confidence="0.993247325" page_id="56315141"  page_num="19" year="" vol="">
(Curator of Birds, Chicago Zoological Park, Brookfield, Ill., U.S.A.)
For over twelve years we have had a female King Penguin which
has laid an egg for the past four years. In the group of penguins in
our glass, air-cooled penguin cage are four other Kings which we
have had for over ten years, two huge Emperor Penguins for a little
over three years, and a Humboldt's or Peruvian Penguin over twelve
years. A few months ago we lost a Humboldt's Penguin which had lived
over seventeen years. Briefly, the penguin cage is of glass 30 feet
across, 10 feet deep from front to rear, and 12 feet high. The tank
at the front of the cage is 24 feet long, feet across, and 4 feet deep.
The cage is finished off with rock work and is cleaned every day. This
is to give an idea of the artificial conditions these birds have done so
well in.
Evidently at least one of the other Kings is a male, for, while we
did not actually see mating take place, the aforementioned female,
whom we could readily identify by her very long toe nails, after sitting
on an egg for fifty-three days, hatched it. We happily saw this take
place because a few fragments of egg shell at the feet of the incubating
bird brought the further event to our attention. We heard a faint
cheeping sound and then saw the female help the chick to emerge and
arrange it on her feet, which is the proper place for both the egg and
the young bird until it is too large to fit comfortably. Even then it
seemed to be satisfied, at two weeks and over, to keep only its head
under the upright-sitting old bird. At nine days it showed itself entirely
for the first time, but the parent quickly pushed it under her so the
public very rarely got a glimpse of it until it was five weeks old, when
it would stay huddled beside her. By this time the little one was too
large to take refuge in its feather-lined nesting home.
When first hatched the chick resembles a shapeless article of blackish
leather with a well-shaped little head and it was not covered with the
soft, pretty brown down until it was about ten days old. At the end
of the first day it was seen to take some regurgitated liquid from the
parent who had stretched her neck down so her beak could touch
that of the hungry little one. We are familiar with the regurgitation
process of pigeons and parrots but it seemed more of an effort for the
King Penguin to do this.
When the chick first hatched, a section was fenced off so there
would be no danger later on of it being pushed off the rocks into the
pool, for the great, lumbering Emperor Penguins would let nothing
stand in their way as they marched around. The mother penguin

would only tolerate one, whom we judged to be the male parent, to &apos;
stand close to the fence ; any of the others, be they Emperors, Kings,
or the little Humboldt's would be jabbed if they lingered on their way.
It would be natural for the female, who had sat upright for ninety-six
days, to become weary ; this we first noticed when she lost her appetite
after eating from three to seven baby mackerel a day and consequently
had very little food for the hungry, husky baby. She was removed i
and the father put in the enclosure. He was willing to feed the
youngster, but became very nervous between feedings and would pace ;
back and forth nearly the whole day and finally refused the food offered
him. We have noticed that if penguins are unduly disturbed they will
not eat for a day or more.
So the father was removed and the little one kept alone in an
enclosure which had been made larger--about half the size of the
cage--but with only 4 inches of water. We tried him on ground j
mackerel fed with a wooden spoon and he was so eager for it that we
offered four or five fillets of baby mackerel which he took greedily.
After that there seemed to be no problem. We changed to sardines
increasing the amount as it was needed so that at time of writing
(23rd October, 1959) he takes about 3 lb. of sardines (half in the
morning and the remainder in the afternoon) and weighs 14 lb. 2 oz.,
and is 26 inches high.
At the present age the youngster weighs but half that of an adult,
probably less, as we have had some adult King Penguins which weighed
up to 35 lb. Its beak is much shorter and blackish in colour, and the
soft, fluffy down might be described as coffee brown in colour. The
eyes have the iris greyish brown and the feet are blackish. The voice
is a loud pleading " cheep " but nothing like that of the adult
as yet.
A King Penguin hatched in the Vancouver Zoo in July of 1958
did not grow its true plumage until March, 1959. Unfortunately it
died from unknown causes shortly before it had attained 2 years of
age. So it is likely that we will have to wait until March of i960
before we will see ours in first adult plumage. Let us hope so. From
what I glean from Gillespie's splendid book on King Penguins in
captivity it is not likely that it will enter the water for some months to
come. Apart from the birth and short life of one in the St. Louis Zoo
in 1928 I believe this to be the third record for the United States.
The second was also in Brookfield in 1958 from the same parents but
lived only a few hours. We are sure it died from injuries received from
its parent in her efforts to clamber over the rocks which surrounded
her during the period of incubation.

THE BREEDING OF HANGING PARROTS
IN THE NEW BIRD HOUSE AT CHESTER ZOO
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.984623780487805" page_id="56315145"  page_num="21" year="" vol="">
By Reginald T. Bloom (Chester, England)
On the 30th April, 19595 five adult Hanging Parrots arrived at the
Zoo--a pair of Ceylon (Coryllis beryllium ), and two males and one
female Blue-crowned (Coryllis galgulus ). After a short introductory
period they were exhibited in the new Bird House.
This new Bird House has an all-glass roof, and the whole of one side
of the building is composed of a row of sixteen aviaries. The inside
section of each aviary is an 8 ft. cube, the walls are pebble-dashed,
and the top is of wire netting. There are large glass windows at the
front and back of each cage. The back window is formed by two
sliding glass panels which, while acting as a door into the cage, also
provide excellent vision right the way through to the outside flight.
Above this glass service window is a small exit hole which allows the
birds to pass into the outside aviary, which measures some 8 feet
wide and 20 feet long.
When the birds were seen to be mating, two nesting boxes were
placed directly above the window on the public passageway side, so
that although they were not entirely out of sight, the birds were not
actually in direct vision of the visiting public. Directly above the
boxes is a ramp which was used daily by the gardeners when they
walked along to water a balcony of flower boxes. These flowering
plants hung down in a decorative mass all along the front of the cages,
sometimes obscuring the upper part of the windows.
The inside section of the aviary was planted with Tradescantia
and partially turfed ; an abundance of natural branches were placed
as perches, and some of these branches were arranged near to the
entrance of the nesting boxes. The nesting boxes measured 10 in. by
6 in. by 8 in. and each contained a little peat. The entrance holes were
at the front, about two-thirds of the way up the box, and were about
2 in. in diameter.
The adult birds were fed on a normal sunbird mixture and they had
plenty of fruit and a certain amount of canary seed and millet daily.
Once it was noticed they were likely to breed, vitamin B and G and
also a little hemp were added to their diet. After the young birds
were hatched a little Horlicks was used to enrich the sunbird mixture.
The first signs of courtship were when both the Ceylon male and
one of the Blue-crowned males commenced displaying to the Ceylon
female ; the Blue-crowned cock was far more energetic in his display,
fluffing up his red bib and the red feathers on his rump and tail. He
ran up and down the perch with slightly dropped wings, bobbing
his head and rapidly moving his beak until the regurgitated food was

R. T. BLOOM-THE BREEDING OF HANGING PARROTS
worked into a mass of foam. He was able to protrude this out of his
beak rather like a blob of bubble-gum and this was offered to the
female who would suck it in, using the same quick movement of the
beak. On any occasion when she did not accept the food he was able
to suck it back into his own beak. During this courtship the female
accepted food from both males but, as the attentions of the Blue-
crowned male did not seem to create any undue interference, it was
decided to leave all the birds together and await developments.
The female Ceylon bird went to nest and laid four eggs. Although
nesting material was provided she did not use it. Two young hatched
out on the 22nd day and later it was found the remaining two eggs
were clear. A week after the hatching, the cock Ceylon bird died, and
the female had to continue feeding the youngsters herself, but six days
later, one of the fledglings was found thrown out of the nest, and the
second one was found dead a day or so later.
This was all rather discouraging, and despite the fact that the
Blue-crowned male commenced courting the Ceylon female again, it
seemed too much to hope we would succeed in hybridizing the two
species. However, the female did go to nest again, and on 3rd Septem-
ber laid one egg. After laying this first egg she spent most of the
morning in the nest, but later came out and collected nesting material
of grass and leaves, which she took back to the nest. By 6th September
she had four eggs and was spending all day in the nest, coming out
only once in the morning and once in the evening. Each time she was
fed by the male with regurgitated food and each time she collected
more nesting material. The latter consisted of leaves which she carried
back to the nest, placed between her upper tail-coverts.
On 22nd September, after an incubation period of nineteen days,
the first youngster hatched, and by 25th September all four eggs had
hatched and the young were being fed regularly with regurgitated
food. On 27th September, it was found that two of the young had died,
but the remaining two seemed all right. The female was still sitting
most of the time, but whenever she came off to be fed she still collected
nesting material.
On 7th October, approximately fourteen days after hatching the
young were beginning to open their eyes and the feathers were begin-
ning to appear. At this point the male bird was also seen feeding the
youngsters.
On 13th October the female was leaving the nest for longer periods
and the young were gaining in strength ; on the 27th they came out of
the nest for the first time, though, at this stage they were not completely
fledged. Two days after this the female stopped returning to the nest-
box at night time. After this the young birds came out more and more
frequently, although they continued to return to the box each night.

weeks after hatching--the young birds were hanging upside-down
for the first time, and ten days after this they were feeding themselves.
At eight weeks old both young birds were the complete replica of the
mother.
The temperature in the aviary during the whole of the nesting
period averaged 65 degrees F. during the day and 59 degrees F. at
night.
After the success with this breeding we were further cheered when
the remaining pair of Blue-crowned birds went to nest in the other box.
This female collected nesting material five days before she commenced
laying eggs, however, the only material she used was freshly picked
leaves of the Tradescantia. She laid four eggs and sat well, but after
twenty-six days the eggs were removed and found to be infertile.
These observations have been written up in detail because we cannot
find any other records of Hanging Parrots breeding in captivity. Much
of the credit must go to Alan Coleman who, at seventeen is the youngest
member of our bird staff. His keeness and conscientiousness have
contributed greatly towards much of the data in this article, and of
course to the successful breeding of Hanging Parrots.

A pair of Long-billed Woodhewers, or Woodcreepers, as they are
now called (JVasica longirostris) , have proven very interesting in our
Freedom Cage. They came to us early in 1959 and are equally at
home on the tree trunks which they probe consistently, or on the
ground searching at the bases of the various plants. They are rather
shy and try to keep out of sight, sometimes hiding in, or under, the
bushy plants. While not brightly coloured they are attractive, being
rusty red with black and white scale-like feathers on the sides of the
neck. They have rather long pointed tail feathers and the beak is long
and slender and light yellowish. These birds will often appear
unexpectedly while one wonders where they are.
A Golden-headed Trogon (Pharomachrus fulgidus) often perches on
the rail and is quite willing to take a grape or berry from one's fingers.
The female Quetzal (P. mocinno ) will do the same, but the former
appears to be more responsive. She always was timid.
Our Rollers, the Indian ( Coracias henghalensis) and the Long-tailed
(C. caudatus ) make a spectacular show of their beautiful wings while
flying about and almost incredibly catching the mealworms and other
insects tossed to them. They also will come down to a plate of meal-
worms held by the keeper.

By J. R. van Oosten (Tacoma, Wash., U.S.A.)
I have for a number of years been looking for a live food, other than
maggots and mealworms, which can be given to the more delicate
softbills which are kept in cages in the house or even in the bird room.
Granted, in a bird room if a person has a regular fruit fly culture,
the bird may get a few, but not as many as it might receive in an aviary.
Aviculturists who keep such birds as Sunbirds, Hummingbirds, Sugar
Birds, Manakins, Niltavas, Minivets, Flycatchers, Calliste Tanagers,
etc., should find this food very beneficial. Although I have not tried
it, I should imagine that members of the finch family might well go
for these flies as an alternative live insect food. Also " Flynots " are
odourless and not much trouble to raise as we will see later. Also this
insect is not fattening as are mealworms or maggots, and therefore
the worry of over-feeding is eliminated altogether.
I first came across " Flynots 55 one day while purchasing some
tropical fish. I purchased a culture and tried it out on some of the
above-mentioned birds ; I have not kept them all but the ones I did
try did exceptionally well on them. In my last article (1957, 46)
I mentioned a way to cultivate fruit flies if one keeps softbills in a
mixed collection in an aviary. The difference between the two fruit
flies is that " Flynots 55 are a flightless variety and therefore I feel
a very desirable item for caged softbills. I have gathered the following
information from an entomologist, several tropical fish establishments,
and from my own experience with them.
" Flynots 55 are a mutant of the fruit fly, Drosophila melanogaster ,
and are not related to the common housefly. D. melanogaster has long
been a favourite tool of the geneticist in the study of heredity, and many
thousands of variations have arisen spontaneously. Others have been
induced by the use of X-rays or other agents. This particular strain,
D. m. vestigial , is a natural mutant and was one of the first to be detected.

J. R. VAN OOSTEN-" FLYNOTS " AN EXCELLENT FOOD FOR SOFTBILLS 25
The name of the mutant, D. m. vestigial , refers to the condition of the
wings which are tiny, shrivelled, and non-functional. Thus, we have
a fly which cannot FLT. The reason for its difference from its flying
relatives lies in one of the fundamental units of heredity (genes),
and unless brought in contact with its normal relatives, it will never
produce offspring with the ability to fly.
These flies go through four distinct stages in their life cycle, egg,
larva, pupa, and adult. At 77 0 the egg hatches in about one day giving
rise to the larva, a little transparent worm which can be seen burrowing
in the medium in the bottom of a bottle or, preferably, a coffee can or
shallow baking pan. About four days after hatching, the larva leaves
the food medium and goes into the immobile pupa stage, preferably
on a dry surface such as a piece of paper hung down ; though many
will pupate on the sides of the bottle, can, or pan. In roughly four
or five days, the adult fly, now fully grown, will emerge from the
pupa case, and in two or three days, the newly hatched females are
ready to begin laying eggs. Each female may lay several hundred eggs
during her life-span of a few weeks. At 68* this cycle requires about
fifteen days and at 59 0 it takes over a month. The females may be
distinguished from the males by size and markings. The body of the
female is generally larger and is crossed with distinct black bands
nearly to the tip ; the male's abdomen, approximately the rear half,
appears almost solid black.
" Flynots " require practically no care to raise, but they cannot
and will not breed in filth. Their natural food is decaying fruit, which
is too soft and messy and odorous for raising them in the house. The
best medium in the bottom of the culture bottle, or can, is an artificial
base for their essential food elements, yeast and sugar. This should
provide an adequate supply of food for approximately three weeks or
more by which time, depending on conditions, the mixture may
become too dry, or too soft, or too mouldy.
An inch or two of this mixture in a coffee can would be sufficient.
As the mixture becomes older the number of flies produced each day
will gradually decrease. At such time as the bottle stops producing
a steady supply of flies, it should be discarded ; a fresh culture started
every two weeks will keep one supplied with plenty of live food. The
top of the culture should always be covered and, if in a bottle, a stopper
will do fine. I prefer to cover mine with a very fine piece of muslin
cloth. If left uncovered the flies will crawl out. The common house
fly cannot breed in the bottle, but wild Drosophila may, thus con-
taminating the culture with the flying species and making it useless
as a desirable food for caged birds. There is no doubt that one can
grow one's own flies on something such as over ripe banana, but it
would prove to be too soft plus odorous. Therefore it is recommended
that you do not attempt to supplement the fly food as described above.

The flies should be kept at a moderate temperature ; they do not
reproduce well at extremes in temperature, and prolonged exposure to
temperatures above 86* may result in sterility or death. Ordinary
room temperatures (6o*-78*) should be quite satisfactory. Thus they
may be kept handily, except in summer, when it is best that the culture
be kept in a cool place.
For best results a constant stock of breeders should be left in the
bottle ; roughly fifty flies should be sufficient to ensure a steady
supply of new flies. Be sure you have some females as the males far
outnumber them. On the other hand the culture should not be allowed
to become crowded with hundreds of adult flies, as many will die from
the over-crowded conditions. The best practice is to remove the
surplus of flies daily, though occasionally missing a few days will not
hurt. The flies may be fed in any number of ways, but I have found
that you should not put in more flies than the particular bird can take
in ten minutes. These flies should, or can, be fed to the birds more
than once a day. I have found around forty to sixty flies per bird
per day is ample and that in some cases this may be too much. One
should experiment with one's own birds in this matter.
Because of all the variables involved it is not possible to give a definite
length of life for the culture, other than as stated above, nor than
roughly estimate the number of flies that it will produce. It is the
belief that usually the culture will produce roughly between fifty to
one hundred flies each day for at least two weeks and may continue
at this level, or slightly lower, for at least three to four weeks. I have
produced more than this if the culture was correctly cared for. How-
ever, the only time the production lowers is toward the end of the
culture. Also for unknown reasons an occasional culture will not
reproduce satisfactorily, but I have been unable to find any logical
reason for this. Your first culture of course must be purchased from
a tropical fish store, research laboratory, etc., in order to get the flies,
and afterwards you should be able to keep the flies going by making
your own cultures.

By J. E. Hargreaves (Batley, Yorks, England)
In 1956 I purchased three young Blossom-headed Parrakeets.
During the winter of that year they were housed in an indoor flight
and in the early spring of 1957 they were turned out into an open
flight 14 ft. long, 5 ft. 6 in. wide, and 6 ft. high with an open fronted
shelter at one end, which already had as occupants four young
Cockatiels, two African Ring-necked Parrakeets, and a pair of
Silver Pheasants. All the birds mixed quite well and stayed together
until the spring of 1959. By that time the Blossom-heads had moulted
out into one cock and two hens. I removed all the birds except
for a pair of Cockatiels, a pair of Silver Pheasants, and the cock
Blossom-head, together with the hen of his own choice. Previous to
this time the pair had chased off the other hen whenever she tried to
perch near them.
I then put up three nest-boxes, two in the open flight and one
under the shelter. All the boxes were alike, measuring 18 inches high
by 9 inches square. The birds selected a box in the open flight, the
one furthest away from the shelter. They were fed on a mixture of
canary, white and Indian millet, hemp, oats, and sunflower seeds
with half an apple each day. When they were feeding the youngsters
they ate at least a whole apple a day. Green food was also regularly
supplied.
On 26th April, 1959, I noticed the hen stayed in the next-box
all day and I never saw her again until 10th May, when she left the
box and I looked into the nest and saw three fertile eggs. The next
time I saw her out of the nest was 23rd May, and again I looked
into the nest and was excited to find two completely bald but healthy,
pink young Blossom-headed chicks. About one week later the hen
commenced to come out of the nest every day when I took apples to
the flight and, of course, I inspected the nest every day. On 7th June
the chicks commenced to pen and on 3rd July the first youngster,
completely feathered and quite as large as its parents, left the nest.
The second one left the nest five days later.
When the youngsters left the nest they were coloured green all over,
but early in September they went through a body moult which resulted
in a silvery grey head and green body. The green on the breast is
lighter than that on the back. So far they have not gained the red
shoulder patch. They were completely independent of their parents
a fortnight after leaving the nest.

By J. Newmark (London, England)
A rare bird in Great Britain may well be amongst the more common
birds in Morocco, and the first example that comes to mind is the
Woodchat Shrike, Lanius senator. In the gardens and open spaces of
the cities, and everywhere in the country this bird may be seen perched
on a bush or telegraph wire, or darting after its prey. The chestnut
crown and nape and the white shoulder patches and rump distinguish
it at once, and it provides, perhaps, the first thrill for anyone interested
in birds on setting foot in Morocco straight from the British Isles.
Another bird that will certainly be seen in the immediate neighbour-
hood of Tangiers and other cities is the Crested Lark, Galerida cristata.
Its upright crest gives it a rather perky appearance, though the bird
is generally well camouflaged in its rather dusty and arid habitat.
Wherever cattle graze there may be found the Cattle Egret, Ardeola
ibis, sometimes known as the Buff-backed Heron. The buff colouring
on the head and neck will be seen at close range, but the bird normally
appears to be snow-white, with a yellowish bill. In flight the neck
is drawn back as in other herons, and a flock of these egrets flying
against a background of green pastures and blue sky is an exhilarating
spectacle.
My first view of a White Stork, Ciconia ciconia, was unexpected ;
it was flying with slow and deliberate wing-beats over the main
shopping-centre of Tangiers, and was easily identified by its long and
rather drooping neck, fully extended. Later I saw others in the culti-
vated grasslands, singly or in small groups, their long red bills probing
for food. In Marrakesh, Fez, and some of the small towns and villages,
they could be seen on their nests on the rooftops, and the clap-clap-
clapping of their bills sounded like some machine.
One of the most colourful birds of Morocco, occasionally seen over
here, is the Bee-eater, Merops apiaster. Its golden upper parts, soft
blue under parts, and yellow throat are striking, and I saw many
flocks of these birds, sometimes perched in trees or on telegraph wires,
but generally flying, darting and sweeping and twisting and gliding
after insects on the wing, and constantly uttering a liquid and rather
grating croak. Their plumage showed up best when the birds flew
low over the ground, and a line of trees or hills formed a contrasting
background. On one occasion I stood on a hill overlooking the Straits
of Gibraltar, and watched several flocks of Bee-eaters fly over the
coast and across the Straits to Spain on their spring migration.
Perhaps one or two of those same birds might reach Sussex or Kent !
Hoopoes, Upupa epops , generally in ones and twos, were seen from
time to time, usually near human habitation. The hammerhead
appearance of their heads caused by the long bill and the long crest

pointing in opposite directions, and the zebra-like patterning on the
wings and tail made indentification simple. As if further proof were
necessary, they invariably flew with that characteristic undulating
movement.
What I first thought to be a Kestrel, but later proved to be the
Lesser Kestrel, Falco naumanni, was another quite common bird,
especially at Fez. Gregarious, and gliding gracefully over the out-
skirts of the city, they certainly resembled our own Kestrel, but the
very fact that they were gregarious and glided much of the time were
clues to their real identification. Only once did I see one hovering.
Also at Fez were a number of Alpine Swifts, Apus melba. Larger
than our own Swift, they flew in company with Swallows and House
Martins, and often disappeared into holes in the walls of the city.
Other birds that I saw, and which are occasionally seen in this
country, include Black-eared Wheatears, Spotless Starlings, Spanish
Wagtails, and Purple Herons. But perhaps the highlight of my visit to
Morocco was a glorious close-range view of some Black-winged Stilts,
Himantopus himantopus. They were wading in a shallow lagoon on the
outskirts of Tangiers, and their black and white plumage reminded
me at once of Avocets. Their very long and beautiful coral-pink legs
looked almost artificial as they moved about with a deliberate gait
over the lagoon. I watched them, entranced, for nearly half an hour
one evening, and as they flew off, wheeling towards a golden sunset,
with their long legs trailing behind them, I thought what a wonderful
thing it would be if they could be encouraged to visit our home shores
more frequently, and in greater numbers, and perhaps even to breed
here.

It was good to know that there was an increased entry of 1,356
birds this year compared with 1958, a total of over 8,000 birds being
on show. The increase was evenly spread over all sections, canaries,
budgerigars, British and foreign birds, and is undoubtedly due, at
any rate in part, to the wise decision to hold the exhibition in December
instead of January when we usually experience the worst of the winter
weather. This year we were honoured by the attendance of H.R.H.
The Duchess of Gloucester, who spent over half an hour looking round
the exhibits and finally presented the Supreme Trophy for the best
bird in show to Mr. Raymond Sawyer for his Streamer-tailed
Humming Bird.
Entries in the classes for British birds were much better this year
than last and I noticed some outstanding specimens in the classes for
British seedeaters, particularly among the Goldfinches and Bullfinches.

The British softbill classes had some fascinating entries. I always
find this section every bit as interesting as the Foreign Bird section.
It is often the only chance one has of seeing the rarer insectivorous
British species alive and close to. The way these birds are shown is
really a work of art, with their backgrounds of moss, ferns, and so on.
Many of these delicate softbills require infinite care and attention
and to see them exhibited, as they were, in absolutely faultless condition,
reflects great credit on their owners.
It is a great pity that the names of the species are not displayed
on the cages. There is a wonderful opportunity here to show to the
general public what the different species look like, but unless they are
labelled, the chance is lost. Reference to the Show Catalogue is
useless. Very often one can only find the exhibitor's name, and in
many cases the exhibits are switched at the last moment so that they
do not coincide with the entries and a great deal of confusion may
arise. I suppose the object of keeping everything nameless is to prevent
an exhibit being marked as the property of a certain exhibitor, but
in these classes where different species are competing against each
other, most judges know to whom the birds belong anyhow.
Bird shows are the shop windows of aviculture and depend to a
great extent financially on public support. There is, in my opinion,
a wonderful chance here to educate the layman and win his interest
by at least telling him what he is looking at. How bored he must get,
looking at what to him are rows and rows of canaries and budgerigars,
all superficially alike, whereas a simple label at the head of each
section, e.g. Yorkshire Canaries, Border Canaries, Albino Budgerigars,
Opaline Budgerigars, with perhaps a brief description of the variety,
would at least give him some idea.
The classes for the larger softbills were not as well filled as one might
have expected, the birds on show were, however, of good quality
and I noticed particularly a number of very nice Waxwings.
The foreign birds are, of course, the great attraction to most of
us, and the general public in particular. It is they which make the
" gate " at any bird show. This year we were not disappointed. The
classes were well filled and as usual there were several species new to
aviculture. It was also nice to see the return of old favourites which
have been absent from the show bench for years.
The classification for the small finches and waxbills was, I thought,
a very fair one, the commoner kinds having a chance to compete against
one another without necessarily being outclassed by rarities. It is
never really fair for one species to be compared with another, but
what I do in these cases, and I believe this procedure is followed by
many judges, is to pick out the best of each species in a mixed class
and then let these compete against each other for the final places.
In this way each species has a fair chance against its own kind.

Bengalese and Zebra Finches now have classes on their own, which
is a very good thing. I wish this could be said of all the commoner
birds, but I suppose entries would not be sufficient to justify such a
wide classification.
Birds which impressed me were a lovely pair of Violet-eared Waxbills
which headed their class, a very nice pair of Blue-breasted Waxbills,
several excellent pairs of Lavender Finches, and some very richly
coloured Golden-breasted Waxbills.
The classes for weavers and whydahs might have been better
represented, but the quality of the birds which were on show was
excellent. There was a perfect Queen Whydah and a faultless Golden-
naped Paradise Whydah, it was a " toss-up " which of these two birds
came first.
The classes for Australian grassfinches and parrot finches were
well filled. There were some lovely Gouldians, the best of the lot
being second, beaten by a Pin-tailed Nonpareil. In view of the
popularity of the Gouldian Finch I wonder why classes for this species
only cannot be put on. I was impressed by the number of Long-tailed
and Heck's Grassfinches on show. Diamond Sparrows, Ruficaudas,
Bicheno's, and Cherry Finches were all represented by excellent
specimens.
There was a good entry of cardinals, grosbeaks, and the larger
seedeaters. All the better known species like Red-crested, Green, and
Yellow-billed Cardinals were there in competition with Pygmy
Cardinals, Blue Grosbeaks, and Chinese Hawfinches.
In the class for rarer seedeaters there were only two entries ; a Greater
Antillean Bullfinch, which I had never seen before, and a Cowbird.
The section for insectivorous foreign birds was, of course, the most
fascinating of the lot. It is here that one can rely on seeing something
really new.
Birds of Paradise were disappointing because there was only one
exhibit : a magnificent pair of Twelve-wired, with the cock showing
all its twelve wires. In view of the situation in the Far East I suppose
Birds of Paradise will eventually be almost unobtainable. When they
are offered their price is so high as to put them beyond the reach of
most aviculturists.
There were five entries in the class for humming birds and it was
from among their numbers that the Supreme Champion was selected :
Mr. Sawyer's Streamer-tailed. This bird also has the distinction
of being the first of its kind ever to attempt to breed in captivity. The
Frilled Coquette also shown by Mrs. Dineen was an exquisite little gem.
The sunbird class had a wonderful entry and must have given
the judge a headache. Mrs. Scamell's Yellow-backed which came
second was a bird which stands out in my memory. Unlike most
sunbirds this exquisite little creature had kept its bright red colour

and Mrs. Scamell informed me that this was largely due to its being
kept in an outdoor aviary where abundant insect life can be found,
even in winter time. There were some exquisite Malachites and Golden-
winged Sunbirds in this class.
There were some lovely sugar birds and it was nice to see an old
favourite, the Purple, back on show after many years' absence.
Tanagers are always a popular group with exhibitors and there
were many fine birds on show. It seems unfair to pick out certain
birds for special mention, but the ones which impressed me were a
Blue-backed Euphonia, a Desmarest, an Isabel, and a Festive. The
larger tanagers had to compete with bulbuls and shamas. There were
several examples of the Formosan race of the Black Bulbul, a much
blacker form than the better known one which is really dark grey.
The class for flycatchers, niltavas, etc., was well filled and the
exhibits were absolutely faultless. Mrs. Dineen showed a Paradise
Flycatcher which is the first time I have seen one of these alive.
Unfortunately it is not yet in full plumage. There was a lovely pair of
Loo-choo Robins.
The toucans and touracos were fairly well represented and I much
admired a pair of the Knysna, or what I prefer to call them, White-
crested.
The class for quails, doves, and pigeons usually produces something
unusual. This year was no exception and a bird which took my eye was
a beautiful Black-crowned Fruit Pigeon.
Classes 405 and 406 which were for species unclassified elsewhere
also had some interesting rarities. A pair of Streaked Spider Hunters
shown by A. J. Clare were unusual and there was a Toucan-Barbet
shown by K. J. Lawrence. Raymond Sawyer's Fairy Bluebird made
me feel very covetous.
Mrs. Draper's pair of White-breasted Rails were shown in lovely
condition. Quite frankly, all the entries in this class deserved first
prizes. It is, I think, virtually impossible to give preference one over
the other. I doubt if any two judges would agree. The Scarlet Cock of
the Rock well deserved its win, but so would have the pair of Blue-
faced Honey Eaters, the Orange Cock of the Rock, or the Colombian
Green Jay.
I always think the parrot-like birds, with the exception of lovebirds,
are poorly represented at bird shows. The reason is partly, I suppose,
that breeders of parrakeets keep them in outdoor aviaries and are loath
to catch them up and send them into heated showrooms with the
attendant risk of chills, etc. Neither are such birds, of course, trained
to show themselves in cages, but what about the hundreds of pet
parrots sold every year ? These would make a grand exhibit if their
owners could be prevailed upon to send them. The classes for African
Greys and Amazons ought to be filled to overflowing.

In contrast the classes for lovebirds were particularly well filled.
It is obvious that these little parrots lend themselves to showing much
more than the larger parrakeets. In the lovebird hybrid class I was
very interested to see a pair of Peach-faced X Masked which quite
obviously showed their parentage. It is, I believe, not very common
for the Peach-faced to cross readily with other members of the
Agapornis.
The prize for the best parrot-like bird was won by Lord Gerard's
Splendid Grass Parrakeets. I think this exhibitor is particularly to be
congratulated on showing such a lovely pair, bearing in mind the risk
involved in sending these birds to a show. They seemed tame and
steady, a very important factor with these highly nervous little
parrakeets.
There were some nice lories and lorikeets. First prize went to
Mrs. Gent's pair of Musk Lorikeets. The class for the larger parrots
was headed by a beautiful pair of Roseate Cockatoos, but several
of the other exhibits equally deserved first prize.
The class for any other parrot-like bird not larger than a Grey
Parrot had two very interesting entries, a Muller's Parrakeet and a
pair of Ruppell's Parrots. There was also an example, in beautiful
condition, of the rare Blue-faced (Red-tailed) Amazon Parrot shown
by P. H. Maxwell, a species which I had never seen before.
The class for hybrid foreign birds is always of interest and it is
amusing to try and guess the parentage of the birds on show before
referring to the catalogue. There was, however, nothing very unusual
this year. The one which I found of most interest was the Bengalese
X Zebra Finch which quite clearly showed its parentage. I very
much doubt the ancestry of the Black-headed Nun X Bullfinch. It
looked to me like a common Combassou.
This account should not be closed without a reference to the Junior
Bird section. This is open only to members of the Junior Bird League,
so ably presided over by Mr. Hylton Blythe under the auspices of
Cage Birds. There were nearly 300 exhibits of a very high standard
and great credit should be given to all competitors. After all it is
from the ranks of the Juniors that to-morrow's aviculturists are
recruited.
I had the honour to judge the foreign bird classes, both seedeaters
and softbills, and I thought it was a pity that there was not a wider
classification because there were some excellent exhibits which just
did not get a look in ; for instance, there were thirty-four entries in
the Foreign Seedeater class, and among these were many lovely birds
to which I would have gladly given first prize. As it was, A. Warren's
Violet-eared Waxbill got first, closely followed by a lovely pair of
Pileated Finches.
The foreign softbills were an excellent lot and it was a toss-up

as to which of the first three should come first. In the end I gave
first prize to the beautiful pair of Black-headed Sibias shown by
C. Vince, largely because they were a pair whereas the runners-up
were single birds. These were a Yellow-winged Sugar Bird shown by
R. Henderson, and a Natal Robin, the property of M. Allen, all
shown in absolutely perfect condition.

The unpredictable variation of the parrot-like species available in
the country under present-day conditions makes it a very difficult task
to provide suitable classification for exhibition purposes, and it was
obvious from the start that this year's entries posed several most
interesting problems. Furthermore, who shall say what species is
" common " without clarification as to the locality under considera-
tion. One season there are a number of one particular species which
has not been seen for years on the market, next year there is none left
or it has passed entirely out of favour.
In stating, therefore, that the classification offered this year requires
modification, it in no way suggests that the promoters have not given
the matter careful consideration, but rather that they have a most
complex and constantly changing problem to solve. Our thanks are
therefore due to the National Show Committee for promoting this
magnificent meeting, though many old stagers expressed a preference
for the old hall.
Owing to altering the date from January to December this was the
second " National " within twelve months, otherwise one would be
calling it the i960 National. Ten parrot-like classes were provided
and received almost one hundred entries which were in the capable
and experienced hands of Mr. Allan Silver and Mr. P. Birch who
had the unenviable task of straightening out some points.
The present classification contains several ambiguities and repeti-
tions that could justify entries of certain birds being made in more
than one class, or equally excuse a judge for disqualifying an entry
he considered to be in the wrong class. One of these unfortunate
incidents in fact occurred. It did not matter much, when foreign
bird judges were instructed to transfer rather than " wrong-class "
an exhibit, but at a Show of this size such a task is well nigh impossible,
yet inexplicably, in some instances birds were so transferred, whilst
in other cases they were allowed to remain, or were even disqualified.
Returning to the classification. Class 411 starts off : " All Conures
. . ." The sub-family Conurinae of Salvadori's Museum Catalogue,
as well as the genus Conurus have been superseded for forty years or
more. Scientifically, therefore, there is no such thing as a " Conure ",

<bodyText confidence="0.989245977777778" page_id="56315159"  page_num="35" year="" vol="">
yet, of course, the name commonly persists. However, assuming one
still accepted the sub-family, this would mean that every American
species with a long tail was a conure, therefore anything from a
Hyacinth or Red and Yellow Macaw down to a parrotlet could quite
correctly be entered in this class. Anomalies that have arisen through
this are referred to later.
Again, who shall decide what Amazon, Cockatoo, King Parrakeet,
or Ring-neck is " common ". In their own countries most of these
birds are common or even a pest, yet over here with a parrot ban
they are exceedingly rare. Several errors of differences of opinion
have occurred in this connection, which again, are the subject of
comment. Let it be emphasized here and now, not in a critical
spirit, but rather to stress how important is the need for revision.
Not only does Class 411 include all conures, it goes on to embrace
all Grass Parrakeets ( Neophema ), Barrabands, Rock Peplars, and
Princess of Wales (Polyteline), Crimson-winged and Common (?)
Kings, even the Pennant is segregated from its genus and lumped
in with these. An impossible task to do justice to, if a truly representa-
tive entry were ever received. Of course it is equally impossible for
a class to be provided for every genus, and it must be realized that
a compromise has to be determined, and every effort to provide this
is made, but this year has provided some instances of the inequalities
that can result.
Now, considering the classes in turn, two were provided for love-
birds. Class 407 for Peach-faced, Masked, and Fischer's which were
at one time the three commonest that breeders had been able to main-
tain throughout the lean war years. Let us hope that this state of
affairs never returns. Mr. Birch must have had quite a headache
in separating all the twenty odd entries and was fortunate in having
one of each species as 1st, 2nd, and 3rd. (1) Peach-face (Nelmes),
(2) Masked (Coe), (3) Fischer's (Lock).
Class 408. All other lovebirds (including hybrids) and parrotlets.
If a judge has to compare hybrids with pure-bred species, he has to,
but how he can place hybrids above pure specimens baffles me. In
this case the hybrids were birds of good size and smooth plumage,
but they inherited this from their Peach-face parent, and Peach-
faced were not put in another class without some reason. I thought
that the Nyasas (Scamell) and Black-cheeks (Kinnin) were both
unlucky ; there was also a very fine Madagascar cock as well as a pair.
The Abyssinian and Red-faced were also good birds so that in all, this
must have been a difficult class and I do feel that in any event the
hybrids should have been classified with other hybrids.
Class 4og. Red, Mealy, and Golden-mantled Rosellas, Stanley,
Redrump and Senegal Parrakeets.
Now the only parrakeet from Senegal is Psittacula krameri , or African

Ring-neck, which is catered for in Class 410. The Senegal Parrot
(.Poicephalus senegalus) is a short-tailed parrot not a parrakeet, and
in any case should compete with its congener Poicephalus meyeri in
Class 414. No difficulty arose, however, as, in spite of the number in
the country to-day, no entries were made. Again, why specify certain
of the Platycercus or Rosellas and move others to another class or leave
them to fall under the any other variety. Only six entries were made
and of these one was absent. The Rosellas were in good condition
(Watters), but on the small side, and they had only Red-rumps to
compete against. The poor response to this class can only be due to the
reluctance of breeders to interfere with their breeding stock which is
so valuable to-day.
With regard to the absent entry, may I digress to relate that Mr. E. A.
Tickle, who was building up a collection of parrot-like birds has had
the great misfortune to fall and break his leg, which has compelled
him to dispose of his collection en bloc , and prevented his entries from
being available for the exhibition.
Class 411. Cockatiels, Common (?) African and Indian Ring-necks,
Moustache, Plum-headed, Blossom-headed, and Quaker Parrakeets.
There were no Quakers, but in any case, why put them here ? If any
bird is a conure, they are. Why add the stigma of " common "
to Ring-necks then include several other Psittacula species, all of which
are usually immaculate in plumage ? Surely it would be better to
classify all species of Psittacula and bring the Slatey-headed into the
same class as their close relatives. It is, of course, most difficult to
compare the sober-coloured little Cockatiel with such sleek birds with
a magnificent bloom on their plumage which all this Psittacula genus
achieve naturally, but it is much easier to put them up against similar
and rarer species. However, Mr. Birch appears to have divided the
honours well, 1st Plum-heads (Hornsby), 2nd Cockatiels (Cook),
3rd Ring-necks, and 4th Cockatiels once more.
Class 411. All conures and grass parrakeets (Bourke's, Turquoisine, !
Splendid, Elegant, etc.), Barraband, Pennant's, Rock Peplar, Princess
of Wales, Crimson-wing, and Common (?) King Parrakeets.
Reference to this heterogenous collection has already been made.
The scope of conures already pointed out. The Pennant is a true
Platycercus almost intergrading with the Rosella, yet it is placed here,
even breaking into the three Polyteline in sequence. There were no
Pennant's, Kings, or Crimson-wings entered, regardless of whether
they were common or otherwise. It would appear, therefore, that they !
only merit classifying as " any other variety " rather than ask the
judge to compare birds the size of a budgerigar with those the size
of a Raven. A Pileated Parrakeet was wrongly entered in this class,
too. It is not a King, although they are often referred to as such in
Western Australia, it is also regarded there by orchardists as vermin

to be shot, but not to be exported alive of course. This class suffered
badly from the absence of four entries by Mr. Tickle which might
have done very well if present. As it was, Lord Gerard took the
premier award for best parrot-like with his pair of Splendids in this
class. They were a nice pair, but not entirely faultless. Second place
went to a pair of Orange-flanked Parrakeets ( Brotogeris pyrrhopterus )
(Irving), a very rare visitor from Peru and Ecuador, and whichever
way you look at it, these should have been in the same class as their
congeners the All-green Parrakeets (. Brotogeris tirica). Both are either
conures or " any other variety ", but they are both so closely related
that they should have been together. No one could have quarrelled
with the judge if he had reversed this award. The third place went to
a pair of Turquoisines (Gent) which were possibly a trifle fortunate
to beat the Golden-crowned Conures (Anderdon). These were an
obvious pair, in spite of the similarity of the sexes, and in a condition
hard to fault. They are, of course, much more common in their own
range than are Turquoisines in theirs, but no doubt the latter showed
to better advantage when being judged. A very close and commendable
class indeed.
Class 412. Lories, Lorikeets, and Hanging Parrots.
Classifying the Hanging Parrots ( Loriculus ) with the Loriinae is
probably more correct than many scientists are prepared to admit,
though some believe they should be included in the nectar-feeding,
brush-tongued parrots. It is equally convenient to some extent for
judging and makes a very interesting class. First were a pair of Musk
Lorikeets (Gent), probably the only pair in the country, though others
may have come in privately ; 2nd a Philippine Hanging Parrot
(Anderdon) ; 3rd a pair of Swainsons (Plumb). The class was com-
pleted by another Swainson (5th), a Blue-crowned Hanging Parrot
cock, and a pair of Hanging Parrots, which if my memory is correct
were Vernals.
Class 413. African Grey Parrot, any common (?) Amazon Parrot
or any common (?) Cockatoo.
This was won by a very nice pair of Roseate Cockatoos in lovely
condition (Anderdon). Second an equally attractive Sulphur-crested
Cockatoo ( E . galerita) (Davey), and third a good Blue-fronted Amazon
(Desmond) which, incidentally, was the less common western race
with the yellow wing edge, A. aestiva xanthopterus from western Brazil
and the Argentine.
Another Amazon was entered in this class, and I had the pleasure of
meeting its owner, Mrs. A. F. V. Scott, who had purchased this bird
from a dealer as a common Amazon. Naturally, she entered it in the
class specially provided for common Amazons. However, if there was
one thing this bird was not, it was a common Amazon and it was
transferred to Class 415. This bird had a red frontal band, a generally

pale powdery sheen on its mantle and back, a very slight suggestion of
greyish blue on the crown, no dark edges to the feathers but a few red
touches to the inner webs of the tail feathers near their base and a touch I
of red on the primary-coverts. The red frontal band ruled it out of the
farinosa group, or Mealy Amazons. It might have been either j
autumnalis salvini or autumnalis diadema , yet it was not nearly blue
enough on the head and had no darker edge to the mantle and back
feathers, moreover it was large for a salvini and small for diadema.
Having only recently seen two living specimens of diadema in
Miss Knobel's possession which were distinctly more pale blue on the
crown, and had faint greyish borders to the mantle feathers, I was
doubtful about this being the same species. However, after reference
to the specimens in the British Museum, where there are only two :
skins of this rare race, I came to the conclusion that this was indeed
a diadema , or Diademed Amazon to use its English name. Possibly
it is still a young bird and will develop these characteristics later, but
it had one feature that is unique to this sub-species--the manner in
which the feathers around the cere almost concealed the nostrils.
No information regarding the precise locality of origin was available
to confirm its identity more precisely.
Coming back to the use of the term " common " as applied to
Amazons. Probably the Blue-fronted ( aestiva ) and the Orange-
winged (amazonica) are the most commonly imported and usually
confused by dealers owing to their individual variation and similarity
of general colour pattern ; however, when their price varies between
#15 and #35 they can scarcely be called " common ". In any event,
they could readily compete on equal terms with other Amazons for
size, colour, and condition.
Similarly, with " common " cockatoos the same remarks are equally
applicable, and again, the common ones should be easily comparable
with rarer species. To illustrate the misunderstanding that can arise
from the use of this term " common ", there were no less than four
Sulphur-crested Cockatoos at Olympia. Two came from Australia,
having white areas of skin round the eye, and two came from New
Guinea where this area round the eye is blue. One of the latter was
not for competition, the other was entered as a Blue-eyed Cockatoo in
Class 415 (any other parrot). It was not in fact a Blue-eyed Cockatoo
at all, which species comes from New Britain (C. ophthalmica) , it is
not in the same sub-genus, having a broad flat crest, which, when
depressed, lies flat along the crown and down the nape, and when
erected opens fanwise transversely across the front of the head, exactly
like that of C. alba and C. moluccanus, its eye region is also much bluer
and more extensive (see Avicultural Magazine, 1959, p. 14).
The Sulphur-crested Cockatoos range over Australia and New
Guinea ; in the former country three races are accepted, varying

only in size, and the most northerly race has a faintly bluish orbital
area. In New Guinea five races are listed by Peters, all having blue
eye-rings but only differing in size. More recently, Dr. Ernst Mayr
has surveyed this species critically, and concludes that the New Guinea
races are all the same, namely Cacatua galerita triton. He confirms that
they do vary individually in size, but not constantly in relation to
their geographic distribution, therefore, the various races listed by
Peters are not valid, and they must all be regarded as one, remembering
that they do vary in size to a considerable individual degree. Obviously
therefore, all the competing entries at the Show should have been in
the same class, but they were not altered or disqualified.
Class 414. Any other parrot-like bird not larger than a Grey.
This class only had four entries, as again Mr. Tickle's pair of
Hooded were absent ; these might well have won high honours if
in good condition. Slatey-headed Parrakeets took first place (Hornsby),
second went to a pair of Ruppell's Parrots (Draper), third to a pair
of All-green Parrakeets (Bolton), and fourth to a very rare entry,
a Muller's Parrot ( Tanygnathus mulleri) (Mclver). I thought this bird
very unlucky, it was beaten by good pairs, but was a rare, if somewhat
uninteresting, bird in this country. The pale edges to all the feathers
on the back was most attractive and showed clearly what excellent
plumage the bird was in. I have no doubt that the judge would have
liked more than one first prize, or would have liked to move the Slatey-
headed and All-green Parrakeets to other classes.
Class 415. Macaws and any other parrot-like bird larger than
a Grey only had four entries, one of which was absent. The so-called
common Amazon was transferred to this class, making five. First
prize went to a really rare Amazon (A. brasiliensis ) (Maxwell), this
was an excellent specimen of the Red-tailed or (sometimes) Blue-
cheeked Amazon, but the latter name is more properly applied to one
of the larger species. Second place was taken by the other Amazon
already fully described. Third, the Cockatoo which was a Triton
from New Guinea, not the Blue-eyed ( ophthalmica) from New Britain
and should therefore have been in Class 413. The last entry was a
pair of Noble Macaws ( Ara nobilis nobilis) (Bolton), the unluckiest
entry of the whole show, because they were erroneously disqualified
as conures. These birds are the smallest true Macaw, and undoubtedly
resemble the Blue-crowned Conure, though the difference is distinct
in the bare facial area and absence of any red in the tail feathers. Had
the judge noticed them earlier, he would doubtless have transferred
them to another class and judged them there. However, it was the
last class to come before him and therefore too late to revise awards
already made. I can only add that Mr. Silver and the exhibitor,
both treated this regrettable though genuine error in a most sportsman-
like manner and there were no recriminations, as might have developed

in less friendly rivalry. The mere fact that our most experienced judge
can make a slip emphasizes the difficulties that do confront a foreign
bird judge who can never hope to be expert and up to date in every
branch of so wide a field.
It would not make these notes complete if the hybrid class was
ignored, because two parrot-like pairs of hybrids took first and second
places, Mrs. Lewis's Swainson x Red-collared Lorikeets and second
a pair of Stanley X Mealy Rosellas (Male).
The only abnormal coloured foreign birds were some yellow
Red-rumps, as again Mr. Tickle's blue Ring-necks were absent.

A specimen of the Red-winged Crested Cuckoo ( Clamator coromandus ),
a species new to the Collection, has been presented by Messrs. G. H.
and J. R. Newmark. This cuckoo is widely distributed over south-
eastern Asia, and observations on its habits have been recorded from
various parts of its range. Delacour and Jabouille (Les Oiseaux de
Vlndochine Frangaise , ii, pp. 179-80) record that it frequents bushes
and forest, its harsh cry calling attention to its presence. One often
meets with it in small numbers in places where it finds an abundance
of food--termites, caterpillars, crickets, and locusts : it also eats fruits
and berries. They also state that the eggs are deposited in the nests of
Garrulax, Alcippe , and the Orange-headed Ground Thrush ( Geokichla
citrina). Robinson ( The Birds of the Malay Peninsula , i, pp. 133-4) says :
" The eggs are said to be laid in the nests of Babbler Thrushes ( Craterops
and Garrulax) . . ." ; Stuart Baker ( Cuckoo Problems , p. 96) lists a
large number of fosterers, mostly Babblers or Laughing Thrushes
(Timaliidae), but others as well. Hume ( Nests and Eggs of Indian Birds ,
ii, pp. 391-2) quotes Capt. Feilden as having " frequently shot the
young bird from the middle of a brood of young Quaker Thrushes ",
which seems to indicate that the young bird does not eject the rightful
occupants of the nest as Clamator jacobinus, the Pied Crested Cuckoo, is
said by Whistler to do.

the belly and legs of the males. Such red markings are said to indicate
the presence of Golden Pheasant blood and if this is so, it is curious
that there are not further indications in other parts of the plumage ;
also that the ct impure " birds should not be smaller rather than

Members of the Club, twenty-eight ; guests, nine ; total, thirty-
seven.
Mr. A. C. Townsend, Librarian at the British Museum (Natural
History) showed slides and kodachromes to illustrate " Early Drawings
and Paintings of Natural History ". A summary of the lecture by
Mr. Townsend will be published in the next number of the Magazine.
Mr. David Reid-Henry showed kodachromes of paintings recently
completed in Ireland for the Earl of Harrington and Mr. Ronald
Stevens. They included Peregrine Falcons at the eyrie, two Gyr
Falcons fighting over a dead Raven, a group of Sheld-duck, and a large
study of rocks, heather, bog plants, and Red Grouse. Some twenty
years ago Reid-Henry came under the influence of G. E. Lodge.
That very great artist would assuredly have been delighted could he
have seen these results of the association.

In 1956 a Roseate X Bare-eyed Cockatoo hybrid was bred at the
Wroclaw Zoo, Poland (breeding account and photographs in
Avicultural Magazine, 1957, 41-3). Another young hybrid was
successfully reared last year, 1959.

Dr. Alan Lendon now sends further particulars of the hybrid Lory
bred at the Taronga Park Zoo, mentioned in the last number of the
Magazine (p. 183). The cross is Solitary Lory male X White-rumped
Lory female. Two young ones were bred in 1957 and one in 1958.

During the early autumn nine or ten pairs of Nicobar Pigeons
arrived in this country. This magnificent species is notoriously aggres-
sive, as two members have recently found to their cost. One member
lost a pair through fighting when they were brought into winter
quarters. In the other case the male would not allow the female
inside the open-fronted shelter, and three sharp frosts and bitterly
cold, gale-force winds did the rest.

Forty-eight species, varieties and hybrids were successfully bred
in the Adelaide Zoological Gardens during the 1958-1959 season.
Perhaps the most interesting young were the three Rheas--grand-
children of a pair which first bred in February, 1952. The original
pair are now dead but in their time they reared a large number of
young, some of which are to be found in the Zoological Gardens at
Calcutta, Perth, Sydney, and Melbourne.

J. Moir has bred the Striated Finch Munia striata. The parents were
housed in a cage four feet long for two years before they nested. In
1957 one young one was reared and in 1958 four in two broods. The
latter eventually went to the Department of Zoology, Cambridge
University. Last year, with a new owner, the breeding pair again
hatched young, but they were not reared beyond a few days.
It might be thought that this was a quite common breeding, but
the first and only British record appears to be that of Henry Willford
in 1909. The F.B.C. Certificate was awarded although no details were
published (Page, B.JV., 1909, 228).

Failure to record breeding results can lead to disappointment and
confusion, as witness a recent instance in Australia.
Alf Lancaster bred the Green-winged Pigeon and, in the absence
of any published report, was justified in thinking his might be a first
success. On his result being made known L. Bright, of Yeronga,
Brisbane, wrote in Australian Aviculture : "I have been breeding these
birds for 35 years and have reared something like 150 of these birds.
In addition, a friend of mine here in Brisbane has bred over 200 Green-
wing Pigeons over the past 30 years and we are still breeding them."

A saleroom sensation was caused on 19th October, 1959, when
at Sotheby's a copy of Audubon's The Birds of America was sold for
# 13,000. Previous auction prices are : 1922, in the Burdett-Goutts sale,
#600 ; 1939, in New York, $11,700 ; 1945, at Sotheby's, #3,700 ;
1951, at Christie's, #7,000 ; 1955, at Sotheby's, #9,200.
The present set had been in the Library of the Society of Writers
to Her Majesty's Signet, Edinburgh, since it was published in 1827-
1838, and has now been purchased by Sotheran's, of Sackville Street,
London.
The Birds of America was originally published in eighty-seven parts
(each of five plates), making a total of 435 coloured plates containing
1,065 hfe-size figures. It was subsequently bound in four volumes,
double elephant folio (size about 38 X 28 inches), and published
without text. The text is said to have been omitted to avoid the
necessity of supplying free copies to the various public libraries entitled
to works under the existing copyright laws. It was, however, published
as Ornithological Biography , five volumes, in 1831-1839. The extreme
rarity, even of small sections, of this work is in part due to the destruc-
tion by fire of the stock and copper plates.

CAGE AND GARDEN BIRDS. By Georg Steinbagher. B. T.
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.9981935" page_id="56315169"  page_num="45" year="" vol="">
Batsford, Ltd. London, 1959. Price 30^. net.
A book by Georg Steinbacher, who is not only an aviculturist of
wide experience, but an ornithologist of international standing, is a
welcome addition to any bird library. The German edition of a hand-
book for bird lovers and aviculturists published in 1957 is no exception.
Lavishly illustrated with excellent colour plates by Robert Scholz,
depicting no less than 287 different species, and with a large number
of black and white drawings and diagrams, this book is most attractive.
It is full of information such as would be expected from Dr. Steinbacher
and ranges from the setting up of bird tables and nesting-boxes in a
garden to attract indigenous birds, to the care of delicate exotic species
in captivity. Psittacine birds, pheasants, birds of prey, and water birds
are among the groups included and there are most informative chapters
on the care of sick birds, buying and transporting of birds, and bird
psychology.
The English edition, translated from the German by Peter Gorge,
has been done so " freely " that in places it bears little resemblance to
the original German. The translator does not seem to have heard of
the word " species " and the irritating use of the words " varieties 55
and cc breeds 55 reaches its zenith when he states, regarding Humming-
birds--" Always fill a cage with birds of different varieties since
members of the same breed usually quarrel " making one's mind
wander to Aberdeen-Angus bulls. Also he apparently does not know
how to spell Parrakeet--in every instance there being only one " r "
in this word.
The reviewer has watched Touracos in Africa, but never have they
skipped " along the branches ; in the original German they
" hopped ". The translator has gone completely wrong in the
explanation of why birds of prey must have freshly killed mice or
sparrows twice a week as he states that it is " because they badly need
the vegetable matter contained in the stomachs, intestines and bones "
whereas Dr. Steinbacher's original explained that it was " because of
the vegetable matter contained in the stomach and intestines, and the
gristle and bones in the body ".
A great deal of adaptation has been done and this has not been
happy, for instance it is stated that the Serin " has not been observed
in freedom in the British Isles " and the references to British Bird
Protection laws are sometimes wide of the mark.
It is a pity that such an important book was not translated by
someone with a better knowledge of these subjects, as, quite frankly,
the result is a disgraceful travesty of Dr. Steinbacher's original German.
P. B-S.

Squadron-Leader Everitt is not quite correct. The true Lemon Dove, which we have
been breeding for the past two years, is Aplopelia larvata, with two races, the nominate
from the " Mountain forests of eastern Africa from the interior of Kenya Colony
(north of Mt. Elgon and Mt. Kenya), southward through Tanganyika Territory and
Nyasaland to Transvaal, Natal, and Cape Province " (Peters), and bronzini , the
Abyssinian Lemon Dove, of the Highlands of Ethiopia.
There are seven races of Aplopelia simplex , none of which appears to have been
imported. For want of any other vernacular name they are often described as
Lemon Doves. The seven races, it will be noticed that four are island, admitted by
Peters are

SLATEY-HEADED PARRAKEETS
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.99607205" page_id="56315170"  page_num="46" year="" vol="">
I was interested in Mr. Vane's answer to my query re Slatey-headed Parrakeets ;
and had ours been, as he supposes, some that he mentions as having been on the
market " earlier this year ", I should now know, from what he has written, that the
pair we have are Hodgson's Parrakeet. In actual fact, however, the ones we obtained
were some that were offered to us in 1957, and these of course may, or may not,
have been of the same race as the subsequent arrivals two years later.
If my memory is not at fault, our cock certainly differs from that of a pair which
I much admired many years ago in the late Duke of Bedford's collection. I cannot
now recall whether or not (but presumably not) the hen had the red wing patch,
but the male was very beautiful with an inky blue-black head and brilliant yellow
tip to the tail, whereas our present cock has the tail tipped with a less vivid yellow,
and the head, instead of being blue-black, is of a very dark slate-grey, while what we
believe to be the hen only differs in having the head of a rather lighter grey.
As Mr. Vane makes no mention of the difference in the plumage of the males of
the two races, I can only surmise that the late Duke's pair were what Mr. Vane calls
" the more usual himalayana ", and that the pair we now have are presumably
P. himalayana finschii --Hodgson's Parrakeet. But this is all rather vague ; and one
would welcome from an authoritative source--preferably perhaps some knowledge-
able person who knows both races in their native haunts--a detailed description of
an adult male and female Slatey-headed Parrakeet, and of an adult male and female

The Medal may be awarded at the discretion of the Council to any
Member who shall succeed in breeding, in the United Kingdom, any species of
bird which shall not, in the opinion of the Council, be known to have been
previously bred in captivity in Great Britain or Northern Ireland. Any Member
wishing to obtain the Medal must send a detailed account for publication in the
Magazine within about eight weeks from the date of hatching of the young, and
furnish such evidence of the facts as the Council may require. The Medal will
be awarded only in cases where the young shall live to be old enough to feed
themselves, and to be wholly independent of their parents. The question of
awarding a Medal for the breeding of local races or sub-species of species that
have already been bred shall be at the discretion of the Council. No Medal can
be given for the breeding of hybrids.
The account of the breeding must be reasonably full so as to afford
instruction to our Members, and must appear in the Avicultural Magazine
before it is published or notified elsewhere. It should describe the plumage of
the young, and be of value as a permanent record of the nesting and general habits of the
species. These points will have great weight when the question of awarding the
Medal is under consideration.
In every case the decision of the Council shall be final.
The Medal will be forwarded to each Member as soon after it shall have
been awarded as possible.
The Medal is struck in bronze (but the Council reserve the right to issue
it in silver in very special cases) and measures 2% inches in diameter. It bears on
the obverse a representation of two birds with a nest containing eggs, and the
words " The Avicultural Society--founded 1894 ". On the reverse is the following
inscription : &lt;c Awarded to [ name of recipient ] for rearing the young of [name of
species ], a species not previously bred in captivity in the United Kingdom."

(.Lanins nigriceps)
By the Rev. B. C. R. Henry (Orissa, India)
This is one of the commonest birds in the hills of Orissa, India,
where I live. Even since starting to type this manuscript I have heard
one calling near by. Our garden has several bougainvillaea bushes
which are a favourite haunt of these birds and for this reason I have
depicted bougainvillaea in the illustration. There are few parts of the
day, at any time of year, when Black-headed Shrikes cannot be heard
or seen in this area, for they are resident here.
The notes are harsh and scolding, typical of shrikes in general.
I have, however, often heard them cleverly mimicking the calls of
other birds ; but their efforts at song are hardly successful, though not
for want of trying. With expert songsters like Magpie-Robins and
Purple Sunbirds to compete with in the garden, shrikes really stand
little chance !
Perhaps an attractive feature of bougainvillaea shrubs from the
shrike's point of view is that they contain ample large thorns on which
the birds can impale beetles, grasshoppers, frogs, small lizards, mice,
and other prey. A lovely thick bush in the garden, gorgeously decked
with magenta blossom, may quite likely be the den and the larder of an
inveterate murderer, the Black-headed Shrike--a relentless enemy of
living creatures smaller than itself. Yet let us not be too severe on the
little bird, for in this very respect it is the gardener's friend, keeping
down pests that ruin his crops.
The Black-headed Shrike likes open, wooded country, avoiding
thick jungle. It usually sits in a prominent spot on the top of a bush or
on a protruding branch, watching for prey or noisily uttering squeaks
and squawks. As soon as a victim is spotted the bird pounces on it,
carrying it back to the bush to be eaten immediately or to be stored
on some thorn in the butchery.
The distinctive white breast and black head can be seen from

two or three hundred yards' distance, but the more delicate hues of
grey on the upper back, and rufous underparts and rump, are only
visible at close range. Male and female are alike.
Flight is steady but not sustained for long. The birds are content
to keep within their " beat ", on the whole, and never fly high.
Black-headed Shrikes live alone for most of the year, only pairing off
at the nesting season from April to July. Nests are neatly constructed
of grass and feathers in the fork of a branch. Up to six eggs are laid.
These vary in shade from pale cream to stone colour or greenish-white,
blotched and speckled with brown. The young look much like other
shrikes, having the typical black streak past the eye and ear, but soon
after they commence independent life the distinctive black head and
white breast begin to appear.
As noted above, Black-headed Shrikes are resident in Orissa and
possibly also in certain other parts of north-eastern India ; but those
birds which inhabit the foothills of the eastern Himalayas migrate to
the plains of north-eastern India and Assam during winter.

COLOUR FEEDING OF FLAMINGOS
By Holger Poulsen
(Curator of Birds, Copenhagen Zoo, Denmark)
</table>
<bodyText confidence="0.9904831" page_id="56315224"  page_num="48" year="" vol="">
For many years aviculturists and zoo people have tried to keep the
bright colour of the feathers in red birds. In some cases feeding with
different colour agents has worked successfully, and further bio-
chemical findings on bird pigments in recent years have been of great
importance in the problem of retaining the right colours in captive
birds.
Most of the yellow, orange, and red pigments of the birds' skin and
feathers are carotenoids, which are widespread among plants and
animals. According to Volker (1958), it seems that all the reddish
carotenoids occurring in birds are not synthesized by the birds. They
have to be present in the food and are merely deposited in the birds'
body either unchanged, or transformed by oxidization in the body
from yellow carotenoids in the food.
In Crossbills (Loxia curvirostra ), according to Volker (1954), the red
and the yellow feather colours consist of a yellow and a red component.
While the yellow is identical with the yellow carotenoid in plants,
the red component is not identical with any of the red carotenoids
found in plants. The bird changes the yellow carotenoid in its food to
a red carotenoid in its body. This ability is not great in captive birds
on account of a lower metabolism than in wild birds. But

Professor Volker (1957) was the first to succeed in inducing a red
feather colour, instead of pale yellow in this species in captivity, by
feeding it with rhodoxanthin from yew-berries, which, however, is not
a natural part of the food of this bird.
The flamingos with their pink and red colour are attractive birds
for every zoo. But, unfortunately, the colour fades, and the carotenoids
disappear from the feathers. Already many years ago, it was realized
that this was due to the unnatural diet of flamingos in captivity. In
many zoos attempts have been made to re-establish the red colour of
the flamingos. But it has proved to be quite a problem to find the
right carotenoid source and supply it in adequate amounts. Many
different substances were used with more or less effect, but in recent
years many zoos are meeting this problem with greater success than
before. Substances which are used are ground carrots, carrot juice,
grated fresh beets, Scottish sea-weed meal (. Fucus ), ground shells of
lobsters and shrimps, etc.
It is commonly believed that the pink and red colours of flamingos
are caused by a reddish carotenoid, which is probably identical with,
or closely related to, astaxanthin, the red pigment of prawns and
lobsters. Recently Professor Volker (1958) has found that the red
feather colour of flamingos and the Scarlet Ibis (Eudocimus ruber) is a
specific red carotenoid and not identical with astaxanthin.
The flamingos feed in shallow water near the shore, and they
frequently paddle with their feet, but they also wade along breast
deep. They eat the minute animal and vegetable life contained in the
water and mud of lake and lagoon bottom, by a sort of filter feeding.
Their food consists of worms, crustaceans (copepods, branchipods),
chironomid and mosquito larvae, molluscs, and further algae and other
vegetable items (Allen, 1956). It is known that many of the small
crustaceans the flamingos feed upon are red, but the colour is due to
the haemoglobin, the colour of the blood, e.g. Artemia salina , Daphnia,
and Tubifex (see Volker, 1958). Thus these food items cannot be
carotenoid sources for the flamingos. It seems, therefore, that the
red carotenoid in the feathers of wild flamingos is manufactured by
the birds themselves from yellow vegetable carotenoids in their food
just as with other species with red carotenoids in their feathers. At
least there is no evidence that flamingos obtain the red carotenoid
direct from the food and deposit it in their feathers according to
Volker (1958).
The carotenoid sources used in the diets in zoos have a direct effect
if the food mixture contains appreciable amounts of carotenoids. The
carotenoid present in carrot juice is known to be assimilated by birds
in very small amounts. But it is known that this carotenoid has an
indirect effect as it favours the depositing of the carotenoid colours.
On the other hand the flamingos according to the results from Bronx

Zoo where the curator of birds, W. G. Conway, uses a concentrated
carrot product with great success, seem to be able to transform the
yellow carotenoid from carrots to a red carotenoid (Conway, 1958,
1959)-
Anthocyanin from beets has no effect as it is not a biochrome in birds
(Fox, 1953).
The active part of the sea-weed meal, which is used in the Basel Zoo
(Wackernagel, 1959), seems to be iodine as the carotenoid fucoxanthin
which is present in fresh sea-weed is only to be found in small amounts,
if any, in dried sea-weed meal. It is known that iodine stimulates
metabolism and therefore indirectly may favour the deposition of
carotenoids (Volker, 1958). Dried shrimps do not contain carotenoids
and do not have any effect, according to Volker (loc. cit.).
Dr. D. L. Fox (1955), in corroboration with the Curator of Birds
in the San Diego Zoo, Mr. K. C. Lint, has used another method of
inducing the red feather colour in captive flamingos. He has made
use of the grated carapace of the Californian lobster (Palinurus ruber)
carrying the red carotenoid astaxanthin, and he has demonstrated
that the feathers contained unchanged astaxanthin.
This is a similar case to that of Volker (1957), who succeeded in
inducing the red feather colour in captive Crossbills by giving them
the red carotenoid, rhodoxanthin. These two experiments show that
it is possible for these birds to deposit red carotenoids in their feathers.
But in wild birds the red colouring of the feathers must be a much
more complicated process, and the red carotenoids mentioned are not
found in the feathers of wild birds of the species in question.
Since the flamingos' feather colour is affected by their food, this
means that we must supply special ingredients in their diet that will
produce a normal feather colour, and must also meet the flamingos'
nutritional requirements. But both biochemical findings and new
feeding methods show that retaining of the red colour is not dependent
on a particular carotenoid. Both red and yellow carotenoids may be
used, provided that they are given in large quantities.
For the last three years in the Copenhagen Zoo, we have kept our
twenty flamingos in excellent colour by feeding them ground sweet
peppers (paprika containing the red capxanthin) added to their food
mixture. This method has been used successfully for years by
aviculturists in colour-feeding canaries. It is a very simple and cheap
method of colour-feeding flamingos, and the feather-colour produced
is practically the same as in wild flamingos, according to Professor
Volker, who investigated and compared feathers of our flamingos with
those of wild birds. Further, the red portions of the skin on the legs
and the bill also retain the natural reddish colour.
We have three species of flamingos, viz. the Red or American
Flamingo (Phoenicopterus r. ruber ), the Chilean Flamingo (Phoenicopterus

r. chilensis .), and the European or Greater Flamingo (. Phoenicopterus r.
antiquorum). In the wild state the first mentioned is the only really
red one. The others are pink with red wings. We gave our birds,
which were sadly pale--nearly white--a handful of ground capsicum--
a commercial product--to a pail of the soupy food mixture a month
before their moult began in July, and gradually red feathers appeared ;
and when the flamingos had finished their moult they had their
normal colour. The American Flamingos were deep vermilion and
the other species pink. Since our flamingos got their bright colour
they have been much more admired by the public.
A visible improvement in colour was also attained with a Scarlet
Ibis ( Eudocimus ruber) and a Scarlet Cock of the Rock ( Rupicola
peruviana sanguinolenta) , and three Scarlet Tanagers ( Rhamphocelus
brasilius) . The addition of the capsicum to their food produced a very
marked deepening, although no full development, of the red colour of
their plumage.
The capsicum seems to be a good carotenoid addition to the
flamingo diet, as it has a favourable effect on the colour. Further the
flamingos eat it readily, it is economical and easy to prepare, and
effective in quite small quantities. From the zoo standpoint, this
method works well ; but it is an artificial way of retaining the red
feather colour in flamingos. Flamingos in the wild state use other
carotenoids and this method does not bring our understanding of the
feather colouring in wild flamingos any further.
Thus there now exist different successful methods of colour feeding
flamingos, and pale flamingos should no longer be seen in zoos.
It is necessary that the flamingos are given a carotenoid addition to
their diet. Different kinds of carotenoids can be used as colouring
agents, but they must be given in rather large amounts.

THE TAXONOMIC RELATIONSHIPS OF BIRDS
AS INDICATED BY THE EGG-WHITE
PROTEINS : A REQUEST FOR HELP

By Charles G. Sibley (Prof, of Zoology, Dept, of Conservation,
Cornell University, Ithaca, New York, U.S.A.)
The purpose of this brief article is to introduce some research in
progress on the egg-white proteins of birds and to present a request
for assistance in collecting material for study. Egg-white from both
wild and captive birds is wanted and " clear ", cracked, or deserted
eggs, which otherwise would be discarded, will often yield excellent
material. Instructions for collection and shipment are appended.
Further details and references will be found in the April, i960, issue
of THE IBIS.

For more than sixty years it has been known that the proteins of
each species of animal are specific to it and that the degree of similarity
between the proteins of two species reflects their evolutionary relation-
ships. This fact is the basis of immunization against disease and, as
would be expected, much of the research pertaining to protein
specificity has been in this connection.
Within the past few years it has been shown that protein molecules
are actually chains of smaller molecules called amino acids. Further-
more, it is now certain that the sequence of the amino acid links in
the protein chain is determined by genes. There are just twenty kinds
of amino acids which are important in animal proteins and these are
arranged in long, usually folded chains. Such protein chains may
contain from a few to many hundreds of amino acid links and it is
the sequence of the amino acids, just as it is the sequence of the letters
in a sentence, that gives a protein its specific properties. For example,
the hormone oxytocin, which causes birds to expel their eggs, is
a short chain of only eight amino acids. The hormone insulin contains
fifty-one links in two chains, the enzyme lysozyme, in avian egg-white,
is a chain of 134 links, ovalbumin contains about 400, and ovoconal-
bumin about 800 amino acid links.
The recent discovery that the sequence of the links in the protein
chain is genetically determined has made it apparent why protein
characteristics reflect taxonomic relationships and has stimulated
studies on the proteins of several animal groups including insects,
Crustacea, fish, reptiles, mammals, and birds. The source of the
protein to be studied may be any tissue, such as muscle, blood, etc.
The egg-white proteins of birds are truly ideal for this purpose for
they are easily obtained in a pure state without the difficulties of
extraction encountered when using other sources.

From the various pieces of evidence about protein structure it is
clear that if we can measure some property of proteins which gives an
index to the sequence of amino acids we automatically have obtained
information about the genes that directed the formation of that
sequence. There are several ways to do this. One is a method called
" paper electrophoresis " which is an electro-chemical process widely
used to-day as a method for sorting out the different kinds of proteins
in a mixture of several. The process is used in the diagnosis of human
disease, in industry and in research. In avian egg-white there are
about a dozen different kinds of proteins and these vary from species
to species in shape, size, and electric charge. To separate these
various proteins, and thus to measure some of their properties, a small
amount of egg-white is placed on a strip of filter paper in an electro-
phoretic cell and a gentle current is applied for 16 hours. The different
proteins move through the filter paper at different rates of speed
depending upon their characteristics. Since these result partly from
the sequence of their amino acids the distance they travel is an index
to their genetically determined properties. The proteins in the paper
strip are then dyed and scanned with a photoelectric device that
produces a many-peaked curve, each peak representing a protein.
By comparing the curves of different species it is possible to detect
genetic, and hence taxonomic, relationships.
Up to i960 we have studied egg-white from more than 700 species
of birds. These have come from many parts of the world and have
been collected from both wild and captive birds. The results of a
study of some 360 species of non-passerines will be published in the
April, i960, issue of the ibis under the title, " The Electrophoretic
Patterns of Avian Egg-white Proteins as Taxonomic Characters."
In brief, some of the results are as follows :--
</bodyText>
<footnote confidence="0.707653333333333">
1. The flamingos are related to the herons and storks, not to the
waterfowl as has been suggested by studies on the feather lice.

evident from the numerous hybrids among them. From a consideration
of all the evidence, including the egg-white proteins, it is proposed
that the Galliformes be classified as follows :--

3. The Anatidae are also a very closely-knit group as, again, the
many hybrids testified. Anseranas has a distinctive egg-white profile
and may be separated as a tribe or subfamily.
4. The falcons are not closely related to the other diurnal birds of
prey and possibly should be placed in a separate order.
5. The turacos (Musophagidae) are related to the cuckoos via
Centropus, not to the gallinaceous birds as the feather lice suggested.
6. Bee-eaters, motmots, and kingfishers are related to one another

but seem not to be closely related to the rollers. The first three groups
should be included in the same order, but the rollers should be placed
in a different order. Other members of the " Coraciiformes " have
not yet been studied.
7. The pigeon genus Columba is apparently made up of two groups
of unrelated species, an Old World group and a New World group.
The New World species are probably related more closely to such
genera as #enaida and Streptopelia than to the typical Old World species
of true Columba.
Additional examples could be given but it is important to stress
that, in most instances, the egg-white protein evidence shows that the
present classifications of Stresemann, Wetmore, and Mayr and
Amadon are basically correct. However, the egg-white studies have
been able to resolve certain problems and to indicate relationships
among the orders and families of birds. As additional material is
obtained and studied it should be possible to suggest further refine-
ments in classification and to discover previously undetected phylo-
genetic relationships.
The present collection of some 3,000 frozen egg-white samples is
maintained as a catalogued museum collection and is available for
further study. In the next few years progress in the fundamental
aspects of protein chemistry will surely be rapid and as new techniques
to detect the genetically determined characteristics of proteins become
available they will be applied to the study of avian evolution and
systematics. Many gaps remain in the collection and it is here that
the help of interested aviculturists and ornithologists is needed. The
following instructions are presented with the hope that readers having
access to egg-white specimens will collect and send them to the writer
for study.
1. Fresh, unincubated eggs yield the best material but any egg
from which egg-white can be obtained free of yolk and blood will
provide useable material.
2. A small, sharp-pointed scissors, some clean, dry medicine
droppers (pipettes), and a supply of clean glass or plastic containers
of about \ oz. (15 c.c.) capacity will be needed. Corks or screw caps
should fit tightly. The size is not important, any container of more

than 5 c.c. will do. For single, small eggs even smaller ones are
suitable. (Pipettes and labelled containers will be sent upon request.)

<listItem confidence="0.818408827586207" page_id="56315231"  page_num="55" year="" vol="">
3. Support the egg with cotton or paper in a teacup. With the
scissors snip off a cap of shell from the small end of the egg. If the
shell is to be saved drill the usual hole and collect the egg-white
while blowing.
4. If the egg seems fresh, and the white is free of yolk and blood,
take up the white with a medicine dropper and fill a container to
within about J inch of the top. Leave space for expansion if frozen.
Cap or seal tightly.
5. Samples from the same clutch may be placed in the same
container. (Beware of cuckoos and cowbirds !) Use a clean medicine
dropper for each container or for each clutch.
6. Please label the sample giving the species, date, locality, your
name, state of incubation of the egg, and other pertinent information.
7. Flush pipettes with cold water after using and allow them to soak
for an hour or more to dissolve adhering egg-white. Dry them before
using again.
8. If possible, keep specimens cold until they are mailed. However,
egg-white will keep remarkably well for up to several weeks at 70* F.
so lack of refrigeration does not preclude successful collecting of
samples in the field. The material keeps better in a container than it
does in the egg.
9. Never attempt to send whole eggs. Even though the shell may
not break the yolk membrane usually ruptures and the mixing of yolk
with the white usually ruins the specimen.
10. Pack in a crushproof box or tin. Do not send glass vials in an
envelope or without good protection. Ship by Air Mail unless the
time in transit will be less than a week. (Postage costs will be refunded
upon request.)
11. Address the package to: Department of Conservation,

BREEDING OF THE ARARA (BLUE AND YELLOW
MACAW)
By Doris McGregor (Rio de Janeiro, Brazil)
</figure>
<bodyText confidence="0.9126685" page_id="56315232"  page_num="56" year="" vol="">
I was given a male Arara (Canende or Am ararauna according to my
Brazilian bird book by Descourtilz) ; it was a great delight when it
began coming on my finger and learning the names of most of us in
the house. He was often amusingly heard to call " McGregor !
telephone ".
One day, many months afterwards, friends brought me another
blue and yellow Arara--so dishevelled and in such a bad way that
I wondered if I could save it.
I put the newcomer near, but not together, with my original Arara.
The days turned to weeks and with a new lot of feathers " Pernam-
buco ", for so she was named before she came to me, began to show
enthusiasm for her companion. For longer than I care to think, these
two beautiful creatures lived on their bar devotedly attached to one
another, until after a trip away, I returned to be told that
" Pernambuco " had laid two eggs in my absence. I was thrilled and
at the same time dismayed until about two months later she laid

two more. This time I hurriedly supplied a wooden box and put it in
a recess at the side of their quarters to which she had easy access. The
eggs were almost immediately smashed and the box chewed, the straw
spilled everywhere. I was so disappointed, but there were yet another
two eggs after another lapse of time. This time I put in false eggs,
but the same devastation resulted. Later I went to England and
before coming back to Brazil I went to the London Zoo to ask what
sort of nest an Arara should have. I was shown this at close quarters
(the property of a delightful cockatoo that followed me along the
wire-covered railings saying invitingly " Hullo, have a drink ").
We returned to Brazil in September, 1958. It wasn't until
21 st March, 1959, that, with the aid of a good carpenter, I had the
Araras in a beautiful aviary of their own and removed their chains
for ever and introduced them to a fine grandfather-clock type box,
duly lined with chicken wire both inside and outside. There was no
immediate reaction on the part of the Araras. However, on 2nd April,
1959, I was excited and happy to see the Araras go into the nest
and from then on it seemed to me, as an onlooker, that they were
very busy. After a while I noticed that the female Arara only came
out in the early mornings. It was not until 5th July, 1959, that I
noted in my diary that I fancied I heard the noise of a young bird
issuing from the Arara's nest. I was convinced that a young Arara
had been hatched because the male bird was now extremely busy--it
would seem that he had them both to feed as much extra food was
consumed and regurgitated. Then the female--in fact both--became
so aggressive that it was quite impossible to go into the aviary in a
friendly fashion any more.
Time passed and I began to think " Oh ! all this is wishful thinking ",
and not being able to bear it any longer, I thought I would have a
look. But the female seemed to divine my purpose ; she was in her
nest like lightning with her head hanging out of the round entrance
hole. She seemed to be anxiously defying me. I apologized to her
and went my way.
It was unbelievably exciting, therefore, on the 12th September, 1959,
to see a young Arara looking out of the entrance hole. It was fully
feathered, but still being fed by the parents. On the 16th November,
it ventured out entirely and one could see that the tail was not as
long as the tails of the parent birds. It was a hopelessly gauche
creature for days, clinging to the side of the aviary, getting slightly
grubby under the chest. On the 27th, it had achieved making the
high branch perch that its parents use and was trying to supplement
what it got from them with attempts to take the bread and milk and
honey, or banana nearest to it.
We feel that it is well named " Aranidade "--being a play on the
name " Arara " and " ranidade " which means rarity.

R. DE QUINCEY-NOTES ON SOME HUMMING BIRDS
I imagine it is a female as now (20th November, 1959), it is closely
friendly with the male parent and almost ignored by " Pernambuco ",
who, however, remains fiercely aggressive--a fact that I deplore, as
most of my birds are so very tame.
" Aranidade " flaps its wings, to gain strength I take it, and I have
even seen it fly to another part of the perch. It is also spotlessly clean
once again.
The only difference between it and the adult birds is the colour of
its eyes, which are a deeper blue, whereas the adults have a definite
yellow rim.

(Trochilus polytmus)
By R. de Quincey (Marden, Hereford, England)
I am afraid that it was as long ago as 1939 that I promised Miss Maud
Knobel, who was then Honorary Secretary of the Avicultural Society,
that I would try to write an article on Humming Birds for the Magazine,
but a few months later war was declared, and soon after that honey,
Nestle's milk, and Mellin's food became almost unobtainable, and as
time went on my Humming Birds decreased, and I felt I hadn't the
heart to write or even think about birds. I also realized that at that
moment I knew very little about them, and that there really wasn't very
much to put on paper.
Last year our present Secretary wrote me on two occasions and asked
that I should write something, but even then I felt unwilling to comply
with the request because of lack of real knowledge, but it seemed that
I must do something about this, since it was here (apparently for the
first time in Europe) that a pair of Humming Birds went to nest.
But perhaps I had better start at the beginning. It was in 1932 that
I made my second trip to South America, and, before starting out,
asked Bailey if there were any particular birds that he thought the
Zoo would like me to try to bring back. He suggested some of the rarer
tanagers and manakins, and sundry other things, but, when I suggested
Humming Birds, he rather queried the worthwhileness of such an
attempt. I had one or two rather vague contacts, but for the most
part had to rely on what I could pick up in the then existing birdshops
of Pernambuco, Bahia, Rio, Santos, Montevideo, and Buenos Aires.
As the boat called at all these ports on the way down South America's
eastern seaboard, and again at the same ports on the way back, I was

able to let it be known what I would like, and was luckier than I antici-
pated in picking up quite a number of birds. White-capped Tanagers,
Oven Birds, White Widow Tyrants ( Viudita blanca), and a few
Mocking Birds from Buenos Aires and Montevideo, and a lovely
Ant Thrush from Santos. (What an interesting family these Formi-
caridae would be to specialize in.) This bird I gave subsequently to
our late and so well-loved President, Alfred Ezra, as some slight return
for his many earlier kindnesses, for when I was quite young he gave me
several very beautiful sunbirds that his brother (the late Sir David
Ezra) sent over to him ; the first Himalayan Yellow-backed Sunbird,
and the Black-breasted Yellow-backed ( Aethopyga saturata) were amongst
those he gave me. He (Alfred Ezra) showed this Ant Thrush with
considerable success at one or two National Shows before the war.
At Rio I found quite a lot of small tanagers, some of them (to me)
impossibly delicate and difficult, and a few manakins--and then, at
last, at Pernambuco, when I had almost given up hope of bringing
back any Hummers at all, no less than thirty-six were brought to the
boat ! The excitement of receiving these was intense, and a spare
cabin had to be rearranged considerably to house them. A member of
the crew, a Mr. Read, who was a keen bird-lover and very, very
clever with birds, helped me most splendidly. In fact, without his
help I am sure a great many birds would have been lost early on
during the trip. As soon as we struck the Channel and the usual drop
in temperature, several of the little tanagers faded out, Necklace and
Emerald-spotted were the first to go, and also some of the manakins,
but, of the thirty-six Humming Birds we started with, we managed to
land thirty-three alive. There were four Pygmy Hermits ( Phcethornis
pygmceus) among the thirty-six, and it was three of these that died, and
the one that was landed alive lasted only a very short time. Mr. Read
discovered on subsequent trips that these tiny birds seemed unable to
stand the ship's vibration (and there is always a certain amount of
vibration in any ship), but he eventually landed several alive for me,
having bedded down their travelling cages in cotton wool for the
journey. In those days we did not have any definite knowledge
of the desirability of feeding fruit-flies ( Drosophila) and the Pygmy
Hermits, and I imagine all the Hermits, are intensely insectivorous.
There was one larger variety of Hermit (probably Phcethornis pretrei ,
though I cannot be certain which one it was at this time) that we
landed safely, and this I gave to the Zoo along with several Blue-
chinned Emeralds ( Eucephala carulea ), White-bellied Emeralds ( Thau -
matias albiventris), White-chinned Sapphires ( Hylocharis cyanus ), and
White-breasted Emeralds ( Thaumatias candidus) and I think Ruby Topaz
(Chrysolampis mosqhitus). I retained for myself just the one Swallow Tail
(Eupetomena hirundino), and gave a lovely tame Waterton's Wood
Nymph ( Thalurania watertoni ), the only one and the first to be imported,

to Alfred Ezra. This was the tamest and the favourite bird of the lot.
This little bird lived for seven years in his bathroom I believe, but
escaped one day through the window. My Swallow Tail also lived for
seven years, in a large, naturally planted aviary and, as it never roosted
inside, it could have been said to have lived without artificial heat all
that time. I have never had one do this since. Eventually on a very
frosty night I think it was scared by something and flew against the
wire-netting, and was found frozen there the next morning.
I think several of the species that I brought over on that occasion
would have been new to aviculture in this country, as there had been
only one previous importation of Humming Birds of any size, made by
Major Pam in the early i goo's. In those far-off days, when he succeeded
in bringing Humming Birds to England, the diet which I used when
I brought mine over had not been evolved, and none of his importation
lived very long. I remember it was the late Comte de Segur, Jean
Delacour, and Alfred Ezra (who had all kept Riccord's Humming
Birds and Garnet-throated Caribs, previous to 1932) in their various
ways experimenting, who finally evolved the mixture which at that
time we all used for Sunbirds, Sugarbirds, and Humming Birds,
which consisted of Nestle's milk, Mellin's food, and honey, and at
night a change to honey and water. I am still not at all sure that for
this country, particularly when fruit-flies fall into short supply, this
mixture is not one of the healthiest and one on which all nectar feeders
survive longest. The trouble with it is that, in hot weather, it is apt to
go sour, and my experience was that it had to be changed every three
or four hours on a hot summer's day, and with the Hummers, on that
memorable trip in 1932, we often had to change this mixture every
two hours, and the work entailed with these birds, about 120 in all,
in that cabin which had been stripped bare, was far from light. One
or other of us was usually up about 4.30 a.m., and we hadn't finished
with them until 8 o'clock and often later at night. The tamer of the
Humming Birds were let out of their travelling cages for a fly round
the cabin at least once a day.
Between 1932 and 1939 Mr. Read brought over for me several
beautiful Humming Birds from Brazil on his various trips. Then on
one occasion Monsieur Cordier brought a great number over, mostly
for the Continent, but his ship docked at Plymouth for a couple of
hours and I managed to be there waiting for him, and on that occasion
to get some beautiful Garnet-throated Caribs (Eulampis jugularis ),
and other lovely West Indian and Venezuelan species, Gilt Crests
(Orthorynchus exilis ) amongst them. Then Mr. C. S. Webb went
collecting in Colombia, on which occasion there was that tragic
mishap when two railway vans, containing the greater and rarer
portion of his wonderful collection, were shunted into a siding, with
a consequent eight-hour delay, during which time many rare things

were lost, but he did return with a few Humming Birds, and I had
two most beautiful ones from him--a charming Hill Angel ( Heliangelus
clarrisse) and a Swordbill ( Docimastes longirostris) . The latter, with its
beautiful slow wing-beats, was a most exciting thing to watch in an
outdoor aviary that summer, but it faded after four or five months when
wild-caught insects became scarce. Owing to the upward curve of its
enormously long bill, we hung its feeding bottles at an angle, which
courtesy it seemed to appreciate. It was very fearless and gentle. The
Hill Angel was my favourite of all. He escaped from his greenhouse
one day when snow was falling, and I imagined him lost for ever, but
three days later I received a telephone call and learnt that a small bird
was hovering round some clumps of " Wanda " primroses in a garden
in the village about a mile away. Snow was lying on the ground, but
these vivid little flowers were showing just clear of the snow. Hardly
daring to hope that it was my most precious Heliangelus I hurried
there with an all-wire cage and a feeding bottle. " Helio " came
straight to me and started drinking hungrily from the bottle, which
I gently advanced to the door of the cage, and the bird, feeding
without a break, was gently but surely manoeuvred, flying backwards
through the door of the cage, and was safe once more. In winter
he would come and pull out tiny pieces of fluffy wool from a scarf
I used to wear, and was always friendly and without fear. This little
bird outlived all my other Hummers, and was the last nail in the coffin
of my bird-keeping activities for a good many years. The Humming

remember :
Swallow Tail (Eupetomena hirondino ), Waterton's Wood Nymph
(Thalurania watertoni), Brazilian Mango (Lampornis mango), Dusky
Jacobin ( Florisuga atra ), Blue-chinned Emerald (Eucephala ccerulea ),

the temptation to do so returned. I don't just remember what started
the germ reasserting itself, but it was at one of the post-war National
Cage Bird Shows that I fell. I bought a pair of Virginian Cardinals,
which I found I could not compare with those pre-war excitements,

R. DE QUINCEY-NOTES ON SOME HUMMING BIRDS
and the next year I bought a pair of Lesser Collared Sunbirds from
Mrs. Scamell, which only whetted the appetite to have Humming
Birds again. In that spring, two Humming Birds, Golden-throated,
arrived with Percy Hastings--one for the Zoo and one for me, but
I changed mine with Raymond Sawyer for a Pucheran, as he wanted
the Golden-throat which was new to him, and I was delighted with
the Pucheran, the most charming little fellow I have ever had of that
species, very tame and intelligent, and a great vocalist in his own
estimation. He was a great favourite, and lived about four years.
The old greenhouse home of pre-war Humming Birds was restored,
and our one and only Percy Hastings had a sort of request to let me
know when he had any nice birds. Since then quite a lot have come
over and found their way here, some in good form, others very frayed
about their wing-feathers, or with that horrible fungoidal tongue
trouble, that I am sure they get from dirty bottles or incorrect feeding,
and from which there seems to be no recovery. To receive a little
parcel of eight Frilled Coquettes--and to find them all going wrong
in the tongue from the moment they arrive--is very daunting, as
one can do nothing apparently for this that is effective, and I have
tried several things--iodine, Chloromycetin, and other suggestions.
Then, in the spring of 1957, Raymond Sawyer asked me if I would
like some Doctor Humming Birds (Trochilus polytmus (Linn.)), or
Streamer-tails. I said I should welcome them gladly, and in due course
he received four of these from a friend, three cocks and one hen.
He kept a very fine cock bird for himself, and I had the others. I lost
one cock bird in the spring of 1958. It had never been as fit as the
other two, and was rather an aimless sort of soul. The hen and the
other cock moulted out perfectly, and were put out again into my
old pre-war greenhouse and open-flight in April. The hen, a very
confiding and tame bird of very considerable character, was soon seen
to be looking about for cobwebs, and hopes ran high that she might
be thinking about breeding, and then a few days later the cock bird,
apparently in perfect condition, was picked up dead. The hen seemed
determined in her efforts to find nesting material, so cobwebs and
lichens and some teased-out sheep's wool and hair were supplied for
her to sort out. She built a very flimsy nest, attached to a branch
and a leaf of a tall bush of the tender Rhododendron rhabdotum. She
laid two eggs on two successive days, but the nest toppled over and
one egg was broken. She then started building on top of this original
nest, but this rather more robust structure was still far from secure,
so I wrapped a hair-net round the nest and secured this to the branch
somehow. The hen watched the proceedings with interest and no
sense of alarm, and seemed grateful for this assistance, and she com-
pleted the nest and laid two more eggs, again on two successive days,
but somehow she did not seem satisfied with matters. Feeling extremely

doubtful by this time that her eggs would be fertile, I managed to
persuade Raymond Sawyer to let me have his cock bird, as this was,
by this time, known to be the only remaining cock Streamer-tail in
the country--but we agreed that if Mr. Sawyer should want this bird
at any time to show he could have it back, and it was indeed a very
kind gesture on his part to let the bird out of his care at all, seeing the
tragedies I had had with mine. Almost as soon as Raymond Sawyer's
cock bird was introduced, there was a lot of excitement and displaying
on his part, attentions to which the hen bird was not insensitive, and it
is certain that they mated, although this was not actually observed.
The hen built another portion of superstructure on top of her second
nest and its two now unwanted eggs, and on 23rd May, 1958, laid
her first (really her fifth) egg, and on 24th May there was a second
(sixth and last) egg in this nest. The cock bird made no attempt to
help with the building of the last part of the nest, but, when the hen
was on the nest, he perched within about a yard of it, and her, for
the first two or three days of incubation, and drove away any other
bird that happened to come near. After these first two or three days
he took up a position in the outside flight, and took no further notice
of the hen or the nest. The first chick hatched out on 10th June,
the second on 1 ith June, not less than twenty-four hours and not more
than thirty-six hours after the first one. The hen alone fed the two
chicks, which, as they grew older, she did without ceasing. A vast
number of fruit-flies were bred and released within the greenhouse,
and she fed herself on these and the nectar mixture, and then regurgi-
tated it, seemingly pumping it right down into the crops of the two
young birds. They grew very fast and were apparently very strong,
pushing themselves up to the edge of the nest backwards to excrete.
The edge of the nest began to be pretty unpleasant and sticky, but the
young birds remained clean, and by 30th June appeared to be fully
feathered. On that day I noticed the hen was flying more weakly
than usual, and unfortunately I had to be away from home just at
that moment, although I do not think I could have done any more than
was done, had I been at home. I was back on Friday, 4th July. The
hen was weak and obviously failing, but still feeding the two young
ones. On Saturday, 5th July, I found the hen and one young one dead.
I feel that laying six eggs in fairly quick succession may have weakened
her, and this, followed up by her incessant maternal duties, and
probably not exactly the necessary amounts, or proportions, of an
attempted compensation for what she would find to feed on in the wild
state was just too much for her constitution. I think she may have
pierced the oesophagus of this young one in her weakened state when
trying to feed it, for it died with a curious, darkened swelling under
the skin on one side of its throat. The other young one climbed on
to the side of the nest and started using its wings. We fed it by hand

from the nectar bottle several times, and shortly after this it left the
nest, flying a short distance. The next time it started to fly it landed
on the ground, so I picked it up and put it into one of the usual
Humming Bird travelling cages, where it seemed quite intelligent, and
fed itself and stretched its wings, flying from its perch and landing on
it again. Whether, when it landed on the earth floor of the green-
house, it picked up some dirt to cause an infection in one eye, or,
whether this damage was done in some other way, I don't know,
but on 8th July I noticed one of its eyes was gummily closed. I treated
this with penicillin cream, but it only scratched this with its foot, and
the next morning it was obviously unwell, in fact it was torpid.
Although later in the day it " came to " and seemed to improve, it
did not last out the day. My record reads : " On 9th July the
remaining young Hummer died." This young bird left the nest on
its own, and fed from a nectar bottle on its own, for a matter of four
days, and it died in full, or virtually full, youthful plumage, but I feel
myself that it was a " near miss " rather than a complete success story.
The youngster was coloured just about the same as the hen, although,
of course, its tail-feathers were shorter, being not so completely
developed, and the green on its back not so iridescent. I felt sore
with the cock bird for not helping out when the hen got weak, but
I suppose he was only behaving in the normal way, and in his own
country in the wild state he would, I imagine, have done no different.
That is really the end of my story. The cock bird remained in the
greenhouse until November, 1958, when my new " Humming Bird
Tropical " was completed, and I then moved him into this rather better
place, where he moulted out again and really looked more beautiful
than ever. When Raymond Sawyer came down in the autumn and
saw him, it was only natural, and also right and in line with our agree-
ment, that he should say : " Please, I would like him back to show
at the National." So back he went to London, as sensible as any
show bird could be. Some time after that Show, Raymond Sawyer
said he was going to bring him back here again, saying that the bird
was so fit here, and he thought he should enjoy his greater freedom,
which again I think was very pleasant of him. I only hope that in the
not too distant future I can get hold of another hen, but I feel this is
rather unlikely. The Doctor, as Jamaicans always call this bird, since
his return, has been flirting rather shamelessly with a hen Wood
Nymph (Thalurania glaucopis) to the enraged disgust of her proper
mate ! Although there will be no hope of breeding " The Doctor "
unless some kind person provides me with a mate for him, I do start off
this year with two or three different true pairs of Humming Birds,
a thing I have never managed to do before, and I hope that perhaps
one of these pairs will do this new place that I have had built for them
the honour of trying to breed there.

You will have noticed that on occasion I have used the word " we "
instead of " I ". I would like to make it very clear that I am not
using the " Royal plural 55 . The " we 33 includes Jack Minton who
has looked after the increasing bit of garden here, the various engines
that make our electric light and pump our water, and last, but not
least, the birds, and I must say that he has shown an interest and
devotion to the birds, and has on many occasions done very wise
things to make matters better for them. And " we 35 for the last two
years has also included June Rushton, whom " Uncle 33 Jack has
taught to " take the birds off him ", and Miss June has come to think
a lot of her birds, and gradually to understand them and, I feel
sure, to love them, which is I think a good thing for her and certainly
for the birds. But " Uncle 53 Jack maintains a watchful eye, and
I feel a sense of appreciation of this devotion. Anyway, between them
very little is allowed to go wrong on the many occasions I seem to have
to be away from home. Only yesterday Miss June noticed and called
attention to the fact that the spout of one of the Humming Bird
bottles was full of a kind of thin fibre. Minton worked it out and came
to the, obviously right, conclusion that this was fibre from the trunk
of a tree fern, taken there on the bill of some Humming Bird. Gan it be
that the hen glaucopis , or the hen Blue-tailed Sylph, has decided to think
of building, and is trying to make this material softer and more sticky
by putting it there, in order to start a nest ? I'm afraid there will be
a lot of watching going on the next few days, to see if this is a reasonable
deduction, and, if so, to see that the " nest to be 33 does not get too
soused with water when the tropical-house is sprayed down. It is
difficult enough missing the flowering spikes and young growths of the
orchids growing on the dead tree-stumps in this place ! The keeping
of Humming Birds certainly keeps one alerted, and is one of the things
in life that gives one a bit of " something to look forward to
A word concerning the way we feed Hummers here at the present
time, and it is very simple. I started off after the war by using Hastings 3
Stimulite by day, and with a change to honey and water at night
(plain three nights, with Abedecin two nights, and with Haliborange
two nights, each week). I found the birds got too fat after about ten
months on this feeding, and would die in fits although looking terribly
fit. We now use one dessertspoonful of Stimulite to five dessert-
spoonfuls of honey (locally collected and pure) in about i \ pints of
hot water (hot to melt the Stimulite and honey), and we use this
day and night, topping up the bottles at about 3 p.m. in winter, and
at about 5 p.m. in summer. All bottles are scalded and brushed every
morning and with this mixture we feed as many fruit-flies as we have
on hand. The birds are not so fat on this feed, and are I think as
fit as any I have seen anywhere recently. I think cane sugar, which

Humming Birds, uses in Brazil may be safer than bought proprietary
brands of honey, and I wish we could breed the minute species of
spider that he uses. I think if members would like further and far more
authoritative information about keeping Humming Birds than I,
with my very limited experience, can give, the Editor might seek
to have Snr. Ruschi's vastly interesting and knowledgeable articles
on Humming Birds translated and given in serial form in this Magazine ;
but probably the number of Humming Bird maniacs in this country
is limited !
The species that have been kept here since I started keeping birds
again are :
Mangos, various Emeralds, Waterton's, Swallow Tails, Jacobins,
and Starthroats, as pre-war, and the following (new to me) : Golden-
breasted Humming Bird (Chrysobronchus) , Pucheran's Emeralds ( Chloro -
stilbon prasinus), Sun Gem ( Heliactin cornuta), Red-throated Sapphire
(Hylocharis sapphirin ), The Doctor ( Trochilus polytmus), Frilled
Coquette ( Lophornis magnificus ), Sombre Humming Bird (Aphantochroa
cirrochloris) , Brazilian Ruby ( Clytolama rubinea), Brazilian Wood Nymph
(Thalurania glaucopis ), Coppery ( Chrysuronia chrysura). Emeralds :
two unidentified species : I don't know where they came from, so
cannot be certain which they were. They lived about ten months
outdoors, but died on the " too fat diet ". They were larger than any
I have had from Brazil, one with a wedge tail and one with a rounded
tail, blue black. Blue-tailed Sylphs ( Cyanthus cyanurus ), Train Bearers
(Lesbia amaryllis ), Gould's or Bogota Train Bearers ( Lesbia gouldi
(gracilis)), Mulsant's Wood Stars ( Calothorax mulsanti), Violet Ears
(Colombian--from Ecuador !) ( Petasophora iolata), ? Copper-tailed
Erethrynodes (Amazilia amazilia), Colombian Emerald (Chlorostilbon
augustipennis) , Atalas Emeralds (Chlorostilbon atala).
Names have mostly been taken from Gould's Monograph, but
these can well have been reclassified since, as the various museums
seem to alter their ideas as to local species and variations of these
species, and certainly many new species and sub-species have come
to light since that monumental and beautiful work was compiled.
Referring to Gould's work, it is quite amazing with what wonderful
accuracy the natural and actual pose repeatedly taken up by so many
of the species in real life has been portrayed, and in how comparatively
few of the illustrations the birds are in a " stuffed glass-case " position.

young and the parents being very happy to have the services of the
nursemaid.
Cuban, Fulvous, Wandering, and Southern Red-billed Whistling
Duck produced eggs and reared young. We have five Spotted Whistling
Ducks in our heated aviary and late in August a female laid her first
egg in a wooden kennel. In all there were eleven eggs, dead white as
in other Whistling Ducks, but more ovate and of a finer texture,
measuring 5*2 X 3*8 cm. and weighing 44 gms. It was decided to
let the parents incubate, but to our dismay on the twenty-first day
both birds were in the run and the eggs stone cold ; the construction of
a metalled road a few feet from the nest may have contributed to the
desertion. We have a small electric incubator which is kept running
for such emergencies and the eggs, after candling for fertility, were
transferred to this. We kept our fingers crossed and after a further
ten days all eleven eggs hatched, the young being dark brown with
the characteristic head and neck markings of the Whistling Ducks.
The body markings, however, differ from all other Whistlers we have
had in that the spots on the back join to form a band of cream on
either side, which makes them quite distinctive and altogether different
from the downies of the Cuban Whistling Duck which might otherwise
be supposed to be closely related.
The young birds were put in one of our brooders and heat
supplied with an infra-red lamp, food offered being freshwater shrimp
( Gammarus ), minced egg, duck weed, and maggots. The ducklings
quickly became imprinted on the hand of the person tending them
and would climb on to it whenever one moved feeding dishes. Their
tameness was all the more enchanting having regard to the usual
wildness of young Dendrocygnini. But, alas, they were not feeding well
and after three days two died. The following day, a third had
succumbed ; what to do ? It was September and all the broody hens
had been finished for some weeks, but we had one female Cuban
Whistling Duck which was rearing its three hybrid month-old young
in the aviary, so it was decided to make a switch. The Cuban mother
was shut in her hut and her young removed to the brooder. At the
same time, the remaining Spotted ducklings were put in with the
adult bird and an infra-red lamp. The Cuban made no attempt to
take on the new family, but at least she did not attack them. After
two or three hours a visit was paid to the hut and on seeing the visitors,
the foster mother called all the youngsters over to her. Furthermore,
she was teaching them to eat turkey starter crumbs. After twenty-four
hours, the hut was opened and the family allowed freedom of the run
and pond. Returning later it was found that the foster-mother had
left the brood and was walking up and down the wire-netting trying
to get out. Six ducklings were huddled together ; one was dead and
the eighth was prostrate. The last was put back into the incubator

and the adult and the remaining six ducklings shut up again. After
a few hours the seventh duckling revived and was returned to the
brood. Five days later the foster-mother had forgotten her own
ducklings and became greatly attached to her new family. These
seven ducklings were reared without trouble. Feathering commenced
at twenty-seven days and was complete in seven weeks. We believe that
this is the first time this species has been bred in captivity.
The Bewick's Swans bred again and had four cygnets, two of which
died from Acuaria (parasitic worm) infection.
One of the three pairs of Trumpeter Swans laid two eggs two weeks
apart. After the first egg the hen showed no signs of incubating it,
or laying more, so the egg was put under a Black-necked Swan, but
failed to hatch. The Trumpeter pen sat on the second egg, but it
was taken by a mystery predator, possibly a stoat. We hope for better
things next year.
The Black Brants again nested and three goslings were raised.
A Black Brant female paired to an old Light-bellied male produced
two fine goslings.
Ne-ne production was twenty-four young hatched of which twenty-
two were raised and Terry Jones added another eight to the flock.
The Bronze-wing Ducks nested, but unfortunately we have not as
yet acquired a male.
After many years of hoping, a pair of Baikal Teal at last nested and
laid six eggs. The nest was not discovered until well on in the
incubation period. Five ducklings hatched but, though feeding well,
they did not thrive and only two females were reared.
The Laysan Teal on loan to us from the United States Bureau of
Sport, Fisheries and Wildlife had been housed in our old aviary and
seemed happy and very tame. Eventually the female laid four
enormous eggs similar to Mallard. These proved infertile and a
second clutch of six eggs were divided between the parent bird and a
broody hen. After twenty-six days, the parent bird hatched a single
duckling, a very tame little thing that was unfortunately killed by a
weasel, and of the three eggs under the bantam, one duckling was
duly hatched and reared. The downy young is rather ginger-coloured
and quite different in superficial appearance from others of the group,
like the Koloa or the Mallard.
The New Zealand Grey Duck presented to us by the Department of
Internal Affairs for New Zealand bred at Peakirk and produced five
birds.
A pair of Australian White-eye which had arrived in 1958 nested
twice in one of the boxes in the Australian pen. Eight eggs were laid,
the incubation period being twenty-seven days. The ducklings were
larger and paler than those of the Ferruginous Duck. They thrived
and all seven that hatched were reared ; three hatched by the parents

were also reared. We do not know of this species ever having been
reared in captivity before.
The full-winged Hartlaub's Duck, which had bred in the old aviary,
had been moved early in the year to their quarters in the new aviary,
where they had much more space and freedom to fly and perch, but it
seemed that moving them was going to interfere with a second attempt
at nesting. However, the first egg was laid at the end of July, in some
thick ground vegetation. Nine creamy, pear-shaped eggs were laid
measuring 5*3 X 4-0 cm. and weighing 51 gms. Vast quantities of
pale grey down were pulled although the female was seldom seen off
the nest. Eight ducklings hatched after thirty-two days ; they were
brown with a black cap to the head, yellow underparts and yellow
blotches on wings and sides of back. There is a distinct eye stripe and
the bill and longish legs are black. The ducklings appear more like
young African Black Ducks, or even Mallards, than they are like
Muscovy Ducks or Comb Ducks, their supposed closest relatives.
Both parents were very aggressive in defence of their brood, most of
which thrived. Feathering commenced in twenty-eight days and was
completed in eight weeks, when the five ducklings that remained were
separated from their parents on account of the male's bellicose
intentions towards his off-spring. Surprisingly there was no dull
coloured immature plumage, as in young Comb Ducks. From the
down the young Hartlaub's moulted straight into a chestnut plumage
with black head and blue-grey shoulders. It is interesting to note that
when this pair of birds first bred in 1958, they were only one year old.
A Spurwing Goose nested and laid eight eggs, but, unfortunately,
none was fertile. Both forms of the Comb Duck were among the other
perching ducks to nest. Barrow's and Common Goldeneye nested and
young were reared. Red-breasted Mergansers produced three young,
but the breeding for the first time of the Hooded Mergansers was
overtaken by tragedy. The female in our Orchard pen nested in
April, using one of the small boxes raised some 4 ft. from the ground.
Our intention had been to allow the parent bird to incubate for some
fortnight or three weeks and then transfer the eggs to a bantam for
hatching and rearing (a method that had proved satisfactory with
the Smew). Unfortunately, the female refused to sit more than a few
days and the bantam carried on from the fifth day. Five of the six eggs
reached the pipping stage, but failed to hatch. The eggs were dead
white and almost spherical, measuring 4*6 X 3*6 cm. and weighing
49-25 gms.
We are looking forward to next year's breeding season now. We
wish we could somehow obtain a male Bronze-winged Duck so that
the eggs which have been laid annually for the last five years could at
last be fertile. We hope for greater success with the Trumpeter Swans,
the Laysan Teal, and the Hooded Mergansers, and among the species

By Edward J. Boosey (Keston, Kent, England)
The following parrots were bred at Keston during the 1959
Season :--African Grey Parrots, Blue-fronted Amazons, Festive X
Red-throated Amazon hybrids, and Cuban Amazons. The latter are
of particular interest as they are second generation Keston-bred.
A fine brood of four were reared, the hen being an imported specimen
and the cock being one we bred here several years ago. Red-sided
Eclectus had clear eggs, as did Yellow-fronted and Yellow-naped
Amazons, and the hen of a pair of Levaillant's Amazons sat for
a fortnight--apparently on nothing.
A brood of young Leadbeater's Cockatoos died in the nest, owing
to an accident, when about half-grown.
Six young blue Ring-necks and several young lutinos were reared.
Other parrakeets bred included : Pileated, yellow Red-rumps,
Turquoisines, Stanleys, Golden-mantled Rosellas, Layard's etc. The
Layard's did particularly well, eight young ones being reared. These
consisted of four from an imported pair and four from a brother and
sister pair bred here at Keston.
A large number of Peach-faced Lovebirds as well as many normal
and some blue-bred Masked were bred, and also many thousands of
Budgerigars of all the various colour varieties.
Our pair of Amethyst Starlings, which successfully reared two
young ones in 1958, again went to nest, this time rather late, and
hatched one young one which, however, they threw out of the nest
when it was quite well-grown. This may have been partly due to the
fact that they were being given too many mealworms for the rearing
of a single young one, and thus became over-stimulated, which seems
probable, as the hen laid again so quickly that all the eggs were clear.
Another cause, however, may have been that, this time, the aviary
next to theirs was occupied by another pair of Amethyst Starlings,
and there was a good deal of bickering between the two pairs through
the wire netting.
The second pair consisted of an imported hen mated to one of the
old pair's sons, bred here in 1958. This hen went to nest quite early,

and the young cock, although still in hen-like juvenile plumage,
except for a few small irregular patches of purple on the back, was
very attentive to her, but the eggs were clear.
It may be of interest to record that now (January, i960) he has
nearly assumed full adult male plumage, and the process is curious
because, as in the case of weavers and whydahs, it does not seem to
be achieved by anything that could be called a complete moult ;
what happens being that the specklings on the breast gradually
disappear until it finally becomes pure white, and the irregular patches
of purple on the back gradually spread until the throat and the whole
of the upper surface are purple. Thus, judging by our young cock,
I think one can say that the transition from juvenile to full adult
plumage becomes complete in the third year.
Our pair of Peruvian Green Jays (Xanthura yncas) made a nest which
was found empty at the end of the season, and it seems probable that
they laid, but, as members of this family are so prone to do in confine-
ment, ate either the eggs or else the young ones when first hatched.
When the pair came to us they were blue and white, and it is rather
interesting that, after their last moult, the blue has become suffused
with the original green colour, and the white with yellow. This, we
think, may be partly due to the fact that they were given a daily
supply of elderberries when moulting.
We only put a few finches up to breed, but Parson Finches and the
various colour varieties of Zebra Finches did well ; a pair of Black-
cheeked Waxbills went to nest, and as this must be a rare event, it
was doubly disappointing that, while sitting, they had their nest
destroyed by mice. Our pair of Purple Grenadier Waxbills again
went to nest rearing one young one, but we finally decided to part
with the parents, because, willing as they are to go to nest, it seems
that a regular daily supply of live ant pupae is absolutely essential if
they are to rear their young successfully, and searching for and keeping
up a continual supply of these entails a lot of work.
A breeding result of exceptional interest was the rearing of seven
young ones (in two broods of five and two) by a pair of Western
Bluebirds Sialia mexicana , a species which, as far as I am aware, had
only previously been bred in this country by Mr. Ezra before the war.
We also, as last year, bred its close relative the Mountain Bluebird
Sialia currucoides.
The American Bluebirds are nowadays extreme rarities in British
aviaries, yet in my very young days the Common or Eastern Bluebird
Sialia sialia (then always known here as the " American Blue Robin ")
was quite a common cage and aviary bird in this country, so much so
that it was recommended for the beginner--rather rashly I think--
and was obtainable for about 30s. a pair. I believe the last person to
have kept and bred the Eastern Bluebird in this country was the late

Dr. Maurice Amsler, during the early 1930s, and older members of
the Society may remember his experiments in using our native Robins
as foster-parents by putting the Bluebirds' eggs in their nests, with
rather variable results. Not because the Robins did not make excellent
foster-parents, but because Dr. Amsler found that the eggs or young
were so often destroyed by predators of one kind or another.
All three species of the Bluebirds are extremely beautiful and
delightful aviary inhabitants with their soft warbling notes and swift
glancing flight. They can be bred in large flight cages, but it is really
best to devote a moderate-sized aviary to each pair. They are quite
simple to cater for, requiring only a good quality insectivorous mixture
plus a daily allowance of gentles and a few mealworms.
The two species that are most alike are the Eastern and the Western
Bluebird but, roughly speaking, they can be distinguished in the
following manner : The Eastern Bluebird is lightish cobalt blue
above with the breast brownish-chestnut merging into whitish in the
vent area. The Western Bluebird is of a deeper cobalt blue above and
has the throat grey-blue, the rest of the underparts being the same as
in the Eastern. But perhaps the chief distinguishing feature is that the
Western has an area of brownish-chestnut on the back and mantle.
The Mountain Bluebird is quite distinct being bright sky-blue above
and having the under-surface a pale mottling of light grey and buff.
In each case the blue is particularly brilliant on the wings and tail so
that the birds are seen at their spectacular best when in flight.
Although they are so closely related, there seems to be a marked
difference temperamentally between the Western and the Mountain
Bluebird. The latter have to be separated out of the breeding season
as they squabble incessantly, and even when breeding they indulge in
a certain amount of chasing about and clicking of beaks. A pair of
Western Bluebirds, on the other hand, can safely be kept together all
the year round, which of course is a great advantage, as it is a nuisance
to have to devote two aviaries to a single pair of birds or alternatively
to cage them separately during the winter.
During the summer we received a pair of small birds of considerable
interest, which are obviously a rare and possibly unique colour
mutation of the Common Firefinch ; the cock, instead of being red,
is orange in colour, and the hen is equally distinct. We hope to breed
from them next season.
Having bred a number of the very handsome Australian Crested
Bronze-winged Pigeons in aviaries, we decided in the spring to let out
a pair, and they proved to be most delightful liberty birds, very tame
and excellent stayers even in quite a small garden. They nested in one
of a row of trees bordering the lawn in front of our house and close to
a lily pond--they are said always to choose the vicinity of water--and
could usually be seen, either pecking about on the lawn, or sunning

themselves on an adjoining rose trellis. They managed to rear one
young one in their second nest, but both their first and third nests
came to naught--I am pretty certain because either the eggs or young
were eaten by Magpies. We wage perpetual war against these
beautiful pests, which have killed more than one newly-fledged
parrakeet from outside the aviary by pecking it as it clung to the wire
netting ; yet so numerous are Magpies in this country nowadays that
no sooner has one disposed of one pair than another couple promptly
take their place.
The wings of the Crested Pigeon make a loud whistling sound
which can be clearly heard in the house, and their flight is very
dashing and spectacular and incredibly swift. It consists of a series of
loud, rapid wingbeats to get up speed, followed by a long glide, after
which the same process is repeated. As liberty birds they have two
great advantages, namely that they are just big enough to be immune
from cats, and--judging by the behaviour of ours--they do no damage
in the garden. During the past sunny summer I often watched the
male courting his wife on the lawn in front of our house. It is a very
beautiful display as he bows low before her with upraised fanned-out
tail, and partially-lowered wings, thus bringing the two brilliantly
metallic areas of emerald-green and purple-bronze on the latter into
special prominence.
Crested Bronze-winged Pigeons have of course been kept at liberty
several times before in this country--notably at Woburn during the
first decade of the present century--but I think it is interesting that
they will do so well, not only in a large park, but also in an ordinary
garden of a few acres in extent.

(Summary of an illustrated talk given to the British Aviculturists' Club
on nth January, i960)
By A. C. Townsend, (Librarian, British Museum (Natural History),
London, England)
Although we must bear in mind such ancient examples as the
cave-paintings of the Palaeolithic hunters, and the decorations of the
temple walls at Karnak, it is with the history of book-illustration that
we shall be principally concerned. The art is of considerable antiquity,
being probably derived from Egypt, the home of ancient book-
production. Some authorities are of the opinion that the illustration
of books began in earnest when the papyrus rolls ( volumina ) gave way
to the parchment codices , bound in book-form, which came into
general use sometime during the fourth century a.d., if not earlier.

A. G. TOWNSEND---EARLY ILLUSTRATIONS OF NATURAL HISTORY 75
It is from the fourth century that we have the earliest extant codices,
though the famous Vienna Codex of Dioscorides, also known as the
Codex Aniciae Julianas, dates from the sixth century. This illustrated
codex was written about a.d. 512 at Constantinople as a gift for the
Lady Anicia Juliana, whose father had been for a while Emperor of
the West.
The original compiler, Pedanios Dioscorides, was a medical man
who flourished during the first century a.d., and whose book, known
generally under the Latin title of De Materia Medica, had an
influence which persisted right down to the seventeenth century.
It seems, however, that some of the pictures in the archetype of
Dioscorides derive from originals of a much earlier date and were not
made for his text. They probably go back to a rather shadowy
individual mentioned by Pliny, called Krateuas, who was physician
to the redoubtable monarch Mithridates in the second century b.c.
According to Pliny, Krateuas depicted plants in colour, and has
thereby earned the title of " the father of botanical illustration ".
Thus at the date of the preparation of the Vienna Dioscorides,
naturalistic drawing was already on the wane : it is almost certain
that the illustrator of the manuscript copied the pictures in an
illustrated Krateuas, and thus followed a custom which deviated more
and more from the naturalistic fashion that had prevailed in the
Hellenistic-Roman period.
The Dioscorides manuscript also contains some bird-pictures which
seem to have been intended for an ornithological treatise.
Sometime in the fifth century a new Latin herbal appeared, with
its text based chiefly upon Dioscorides. The illustrator of this work,
which is known as the Pseudo-Apuleius, did not draw upon direct
observation of the plants, but depended on the tradition of plant-
pictures which goes back to Dioscorides, but with an increased
stylization and an ever-growing deviation from the natural forms.
After Galen (a.d. 131-201), down to the thirteenth century, biology
has little or no history, for plants were of interest almost entirely for
their medical importance, and animals were of symbolic rather than
of scientific significance. Thus the Herbal and the Bestiary became of
paramount importance.
The Bestiary, which probably originated in Egypt about a.d. 370,
has been described by the late Dr. M. R. James as " a kind of moralized
natural history illustrated with curious pictures ". It was translated
into many languages and exercised a great influence on the ecclesi-
astical art and general culture of the Middle Ages. The clerical mind
asked itself what it could learn from animals. The " nature of the
beast " became, in each instance, pure fancy. For example, the Fox,
when hungry, feigns death, and so catches the birds that light upon it
to feed--and such are the works of the Devil. The Whale, too, lures

mariners to anchor their ships upon his body, and then, down he goes,
dragging the ship and the crew with him, like people who place their
hopes in the Devil and his works, and who are finally swallowed up
in the fiery gulf of hell.
Perhaps we can leave the Bestiary by quoting once more from
Dr. James : " Whenever you see a griffin on a crest, or supporting a
coat-of-arms, or a Pelican plucking at its breast, or a Phoenix on
a life-insurance badge, or, most familiar of all, a Unicorn, you are
looking at something which, but for the Bestiary, would not have been
there." And we still talk about " crocodile's tears " and of bears
" licking their cubs into shape "--both met with in the Bestiary.
In contrast, however, we should mention the work of perhaps the
first ornithologist of importance known to history--the De Arte
Venandi cum Avibus, a treatise on falconry by the Emperor
Frederick II of Hohenstaufen, which was completed about 1488.
Some copies of this have many marginal illustrations in colour,
depicting numerous species of birds. It should be remembered,
however, that in the thirteenth and fourteenth centuries, naturalistic
illustrations of animals, though often the product of close observation,
were decorative in intention ; they accompanied no relevant text,
and were contemplative rather than explanatory.
With the advent of printing, Konrad von Megenburg's Puch der
JVatur , first printed at Augsburg in 1475, is of considerable interest,
as it contains what is probably one of the earliest pictures of birds in
a printed book, and also because the woodcuts seem to have been
prepared, not merely for decorative purposes, but with the definite
intention of illustrating the text. This is an important step forward :
the preparation of these woodcuts impelled observation and rendered
it more acute.
An interesting contemporary work is Bernard von Breydenbach's
account of his travels to the Holy Land, published at Mainz in i486.
The author was Dean of Mainz, and he went on his pilgrimage
accompanied by an artist, Erhard Reuwich, of Utrecht. The single
plate of animals in the book is well drawn, and the camel and the
giraffe, though appearing somewhat out of place among a number of
fantastic-looking creatures there displayed, seem to have been drawn
from nature, and are probably the earliest printed illustration of these
animals portrayed in a realistic manner.
Another popular illustrated work of this period was the Dialogus
Creaturarum , a book of fables by an unknown Dutch author, printed
at Gouda in 1480 by Pieter van Leuw. The book contains 121 illustra-
tions, the delicate outline of which well conveys the humour of the
text. An English version appeared c. 1517 (reprinted in 1816), and is
probably the first English book in which we find those characteristic
couplets appended as morals at the end of the fables " which sink ",

as we read in a bookseller's catalogue of some years ago, " into the
memory with more power than finer literature or erudition of greater
importance ever attains." For example :
" They that be rulers may nothinge avayle
If they that be undyr of helpe doth them fayle."
A more primitive style of woodcut is to be found in Trevisa's version
of the medieval encyclopaedia of Bartholomaeus Anglicus, printed by
Wynkyn de Worde before the end of the fifteenth century. This
contains one of the earliest illustrations of birds in a book printed in
England, and the book itself was the first to be printed on English-
made paper, from the mill of John Tate of Hertford, the first paper-
mill to be set up in this country (see Figure).
The Hortus Sanitatis , printed at Mainz by Jacob Meydenbach in
1491, is very rich in illustrations. Although the botanical part of this
herbal derives from an earlier work, the animal part seems to be nearly
all new. About one-third of the figures of herbs is also new, and the
rest are copies on a reduced scale from the German Herbarius, printed
at Mainz in 1483, and are much inferior to their originals.
During the sixteenth century an advance seems to have been made
in all branches of book-illustration, which is possibly due in part
to the influence of Diirer (1471-1528), who had begun to practise
wood-cutting, and perhaps to Leonardo, who had produced some
exquisite plant-drawings.
Certainly a new era in botanical drawing opened with the publica-
tion in 1530 of Otto von Brunfels's Herbarum Vivae Eicones, which
marked the beginning of a truly naturalistic type of botanical illustra-
tion--the work of the artist Hans Weiditz, some of whose drawings
had formerly been attributed to Diirer.
With Leonhart Fuchs : De Historia Stirpium (1542), with its splendid
folio page, fine printing and lay-out, " plant illustration," to quote
Dr. Agnes Arber, " may perhaps be held to have reached an even
higher level than in the work of Brunfels."
At the close of the sixteenth century, engraving on metal had begun
to supersede the art of wood-cutting. The earliest botanical book in
which copper-plate etchings were used is probably Fabio Golonna's
Phytobasanos , published at Naples in 1592.
In zoology, of particular interest is the great work of Conrad
Gesner [1516-1565], the bird part of which was published at Zurich
in 1555. The woodcuts in Gesner's work--there were over 1,000
of them--were copied and recopied for more than 100 years.
With the work of Pierre Belon, of Le Mans, whose treatise on birds
appeared in 1555, direct observation of natural history objects may be
said to have begun. Belon's book, with its 160 figures, is probably
the first book to be devoted solely to ornithology.

A. C. TOWNSEND-EARLY ILLUSTRATIONS OF NATURAL HISTORY 79
The seventeenth and eighteenth centuries witnessed the practice of
forming " cabinets " of natural history, designed to contain specimens
from all parts of the world. For example, the influx of new plants from
America and the Orient, gave rise to sumptuous books such as
Linnaeus's Hortus Cliffortianus (1737), with drawings by Georg
Dionysius Ehret, made for the wealthy banker Cliffort, of Haarlem.
Much stimulus was given to natural history illustration by the
explorations abroad which were going on at this time. We may
remember the three voyages of Captain Cook, and the three artists
who illustrated them, Sydney Parkinson, Georg Forster, and William
Ellis respectively. There was also Ferdinand Bauer who accompanied
Robert Brown on Flinders's voyage to Australia between 1801 and
1805. The British Museum (Natural History) possesses a fine collec-
tion of the drawings of Ferdinand Bauer, and also of his elder brother
Francis, who came to England from Austria in 1788, and who settled
soon after at Kew, where he remained for thirty years in the employ-
ment of Sir Joseph Banks as botanical draughtsman. The work of the
brothers Bauer is of the very finest quality.
The influence of new discoveries is also apparent in illustrated
books on insects, and although the first book exclusively devoted to
entomology was Aldrovandi's De Animalibus Insectis , published at
Bologna in 1602, an entirely new kind of insect-book came out at
Amsterdam in 1705. This was Maria Sibylla Merian's Surinamische
Insekten , the work of a remarkable woman who came of a family of
Frankfurt painters.
In England, the productions of Moses Harris ( c . 1730-1785) are
among the finest illustrated entomological works of the period. His
principal work was entitled the Aurelian , and formerly entomologists
were called " Aurelians ".
There were many botanical artists of renown in England during
the second half of the eighteenth century, and among these were
Francis Masson [1741-1805], who was sent out from Kew Gardens
to South Africa and elsewhere, and Frederick Polydore Nodder, who
was employed by Sir Joseph Banks to make finished drawings of
Parkinson's sketches of the plants collected on Cook's first voyage.
In 1788 Nodder was styled " Botanical Painter to the Queen
Finally, there is a naturalist of real note, George Edwards, an
Essex man, born in 1694. His great achievement was his Natural
History of Birds , and his Gleanings of Natural History , published between
1758 and 1764. In these books nearly 600 species were illustrated
for the first time. Swainson says of Edwards that he was " an un-
scientific but very accurate describer and painter of animals ", adding
that " he had the simplicity and piety of Izaac Walton, and may be
looked upon as one of our greatest worthies."

Two young Black-necked Storks (Xmorhynchus a. asiaticus), the first
to be exhibited at Regent's Park since 1941, have been purchased.
There are, of course, two races of this handsome species, the nominate
one ranging from India to Indo-China and southward as far as
Ceylon and the Malay Peninsula and the other ( X . a. australis)
inhabiting New Guinea, islands in the Torres Straits, northern and
eastern Australia, where it is sometimes known as the Jabiru. It is
a bird of the swamps, creeks, and lagoons, living on fish and other
water life and, it is said, carrion.
Other arrivals include a Knot (found with a wing injury), two
Guillemots (found on the south coast covered in oil), an Abyssinian
Lovebird, an Alexandrine Parrakeet, two Nonpareil or Painted
Buntings, and a Black-headed Sugar Bird.

The Adelaide Zoo reports that in February, 1957, they received
four immature Mute Swans from the Perth Zoo. They eventually
proved to be three males and one female. In September, 1959, a pair
nested : four eggs were laid, and two cygnets were hatched during
the first week of November. This event is particularly gratifying as
it is apparently the first time the Mute Swan has been bred during
the long history of the Zoo.

There has been considerable speculation amongst bird-watchers in
West Cornwall, Connecticut, by the appearance of an European
Robin. It now seems quite possible that it is a survivor of twelve
originally imported from Belgium by Mr. H. Van Alen, of Newport,
Rhode Island, in the spring of 1958. Eight were liberated in Rhode
Island, Washington, and Maryland, in an attempt to establish the
species in North America. It is now hoped to repeat the experiment
on a larger scale.

Lloyd B. Thompson, British Columbia, writes : " My Turquoisines
have produced a number of variations. In 1958 a hen was reared
with red on the belly ; also birds with yellow on the head. Last year
a hen was reared that appeared to have a blue cast over the breast
and body, and there was far more blue on the head than is normal
on a young one. This was a late hatched bird and she is moulting
quite heavily now. Last year too, one pair had a young one that
had very light down, but it died when only a few days old. Are
these variations common in Turquoisines ? "

The third volume of this important work deals with the Eiders
(Somateriini ), Pochards ( Aythyini ), Perching Ducks ( Cairinini ), the
Scoters, Golden-eyes and Mergansers ( Mergini ), and the Stiff-tailed
Ducks ( Oxyurnini ), and completes the survey of all the known species
of the Anatidae of the world. The author and artist are to be con-
gratulated on this truly monumental contribution to ornithological
literature which is of the greatest value to all those interested in this
group of birds. To readers of the Avicultural Magazine the sections
on aviculture will be of especial help and many quotations are made
from previous numbers of the Magazine.
In the introduction it is stated that it had been previously planned
to incorporate in the third volume some general chapters on the
morphology, anatomy, and biology of the family ; on history, sport,
conservation, care and breeding ; and also a bibliography, but it
was found that this would entail so much work and take so much
space that it was preferable to plan them for a fourth volume. It is
satisfactory to note that it is hoped that this volume will be ready in
the near future and will contain a number of interesting illustrations.

THE BUZZARD. By Frank Wenzel. George Allen and Unwin, Ltd.
London, 1959. Price 356-. net.
This is a close and intimate study of the Buzzard, profusely illustrated
by really superb photographs--some in black and white some in
colour--the quality of both mediums reaching a very high standard.
The author photographed his first Buzzard's nest at the age of fourteen
and since that time examined well over 100 nests. His description of
the behaviour of parents and of young at the nest is most informative
and valuable, and there is no doubt that he knows a very great deal
about this magnificent bird. This knowledge he imparts in a charming
and graphic style which makes one almost smell the damp of the forests
and see the rising mist over the lake. This is a book written by a true
naturalist who is also a great artist, for not only are his photographs
intensely interesting and depicting every aspect of the life of the
Buzzard, but they are delightful to look upon as pictures. The text is
beautifully translated from the Danish by Reginald Spink who
undoubtedly has that rare gift of maintaining the style and spirit of
the author.

SEXING LEADBEATER'S COCKATOOS

I was very interested in Dr. Kendall's notes on his cockatoos, and fully appreciate
his difficulty in sexing Leadbeater's.
We have now reached the fifth generation of aviary-bred Leadbeater's, and during
that time have had a number of good breeding pairs. With one of these, there never
was any difficulty in sexing the young from the moment they left the nest. Cocks
always had a black iris, which could just be discerned from the pupil when a strong
light (such as the setting sun) was shining straight into it ; hens all had much lighter
irises, some were almost red, some were a yellowish-hazel, but they were always
easily distinguished. This was the first pair which reared with us and we thought
it was quite simple to sex from the nest by the eye.
Later on, however, we had other unrelated pairs, in which the young all left the
nest with dark eyes and the colour changed later. Sometimes this change took place
a few weeks after fledging, and at others it took almost a year to become apparent.
To complicate matters still more, we had two instances where a bird had one light
eye and one dark, consequently one would sex the young one day in the aviary as
two hens and one cock, then later on, one would decide that there were two cocks
and one hen.
I have never had a young cockatoo which left the nest with a light iris which
subsequently became dark, quoted by Dr. Kendall as being experienced by

WING-PATCHES IN HEN SLATEY-HEADED PARRAKEETS
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.994696666666667" page_id="56315265"  page_num="85" year="" vol="">
The differences between the plumage of the two Slatey-headed Parrakeets have
been well described by K. Z. Husain in The Ibis (Vol. 101, pp. 249-250) and the
very obvious differences are that in P. h. himalayana the green parts are much darker
and that the central tail-feathers are on average more than twice as wide (11 mm.
against 5 mm.).
P. h. finschi is of a much more yellowish-green and the tail, in addition to being
narrower is longer. Females are said not to show the small maroon-coloured patch
on the wing and the tail is considerably shorter.
It is, surely, the former that is sometimes known as Hodgson's Parrakeet, for it
was named Palaeornis schisticeps by Hodgson in 1836, though Lesson had, of course,
named it Psittacus {Conurus ) himalayanus in 1832.
Tavistock called finschi Finsch's Parrakeet, but it is more generally known as the
Burmese Slatey-headed Parrakeet, though, of course, it ranges far beyond the forests
of Burma.
There is a muddle over the Plum-headed, Blossom-headed, and Rosy-headed
Parrakeets. Seth-Smith ( Parrakeets , 1910) calls cyanocephala the Blossom-headed and
rosa the Rosy-headed : Tavistock ( Parrots and Parrot-like Birds) calls them Plum-
headed and Blossom-headed respectively. Biswas (. American Museum Novitates, 1950),
as I understand it, considers that what some of us have always called the Rosy-headed
is a separate species and names it Psittacula roseata (consisting of two races) and
P. cyanocephala a species of three races. However, it would surely be best to call the
rosa (or roseata) the Rosy-headed because that is quite a good description and the
more purplish-headed cyanocephala the Plum-headed because the colour of the head
is much like that of a ripe plum. Incidentally, the hen Rosy-headed shows the small
maroon patch on the wing which the hen Plum-headed does not, and that, one
would think, is an additional reason for considering them separate species.

My reply to Mr. Boosey's query was given under the impression that his problem
was one of sex, not of racial distinction, for there is no doubt over the latter point.
The two races Psittacula himalayana himalayana and P.h. finschii can be distinguished
at sight in either sex by the two central rectrices. In the nominate form these two
feathers are broad along their entire length (about half an inch) whereas in finschii
they taper rapidly to a width of between one-eighth to one-quarter of an inch with
a somewhat spatulate tip. That characteristic alone enables them to be separated
without difficulty. Naturally, the yellow tip of the broader tail looks much more
pronounced. Descriptions of the two forms refer to more yellowish-green, more
golden-yellow of the back, as well as more bluish slatey-black of the head in finschii,
but these differences can only be noticed when comparing specimens side by side,
and undoubtedly vary in individuals. The tail is generally bluer on the basal half
in himalayana , and a mauve-lilac in finschii , but there is never any need to look beyond
the width of the tail-feathers to determine the difference.
Although I have not yet had the opportunity to go into this matter very deeply,
I have ascertained that no reference to this species has been made in the Zoological
Record over the last twenty-five years (i.e. since Peters' Checklist), but I have inspected
the very good series in the British Museum. These have been secured from five

Of the twenty-six hens and fifty-two cocks listed above, which appear to be definitely
sexed by the collectors and also in adult plumage, only two hens have wing patches,
one from group 4 and one from group 5. Conversely two cocks (so labelled) from
group 5 had no wing patches.
Not only does this confirm the information supplied by Mr. Macdonald, but it
emphasizes his remark : "If the specimens are correctly sexed, at least some females
do have this feature." Further, it suggests that this characteristic varies in individuals,
and is not a safe sexual distinction, at least in the eastern race. Sometimes hens may
have it, occasionally too, cocks may not. That is assuming they have been correctly
sexed by the collectors. Some of these examples had labels also written in eastern
characters, indicating that they had probably been acquired by purchase from native
sources.
This may be a point that aviculture can help to solve ; but even so, it would not
necessarily follow that progeny reared in captivity, would constantly inherit a char-
acteristic that had been evolved through generations in a geographic race due to
ecological environment.

The culture medium consists of oatmeal, molasses, agar, Nipagin M, and yeast
mixed with water and boiled. The resulting porridge is put into small milk bottles
and each " boiling " can be used twice.
I have heard of a beetle that breeds in the deep layer of sawdust on the floor of a
" broiler " house, the larva of which is called the " lesser mealworm." This presumably
feeds on the dry mash provided for the poultry and it is said to breed so rapidly as to
be a nuisance. Some specimens have been promised and if they materialize I will
report on them.

The successful rearing of a Hanging Parrot, although a hybrid, at Chester Zoo
is a most encouraging and commendable achievement, which may well persuade
others to repeat the performance.
I should like to congratulate and thank those responsible, not only for accomplishing
the feat, but also recording it with such helpful information for other aviculturists
to follow.
I would, however, point out that the correct scientific name for the genus is Loriculus ,

STRANGE BEHAVIOUR OF COCK BULLFINCH
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.9044302" page_id="56315267"  page_num="87" year="" vol="">
We have at Keston a cock Bullfinch--a tame one--whose behaviour in an aviary
is so extraordinary that I think it is worth recording. It apparently has a hatred of
cock pheasants, and although probably few people would believe that a Bullfinch
could cause the death of a pheasant, yet it is true in the case of this bird ; or would
have been, had we not intervened.
The cock Bullfinch and his hen first shared a large planted aviary with, among
other birds, a trio of Golden Pheasants. The Bullfinch proceeded to conduct a war
of nerves against the cock pheasant which consisted of constantly flying just an inch
or so above its head wherever it went, until the poor bird was driven nearly mad.
It would rush about trying frantically to escape from its small but relentless pursuer
until, unable to do so, it was forced to take refuge in the thickest bush in the aviary :
and there it had to stay, because the moment it ventured forth the Bullfinch began
tormenting it again. Finally the pheasant, unable even to come out to feed, was
rapidly going into a decline and would certainly have died had not either it or the
Bullfinch been removed.
Since then we have tried the Bullfinch with Amherst Pheasants, but again it had
to be removed, as it persecuted the cock in exactly the same way.

THE WHITE-EYE IN NEW ZEALAND
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.979214433333334" page_id="56315281"  page_num="" year="" vol="">
By Alan R. Longhurst (Freetown, Sierra Leone, West Africa)
New Zealand lies across a belt of strong, prevailing westerly winds
and a proportion of its terrestrial bird fauna has clearly been derived in
relatively recent times from Australia, about 2,000 miles upwind across
the Tasman Sea. Some species, such as the native pipit and the
Purple Gallinule, or Pukeko, have probably been established for a
very long period, but others such as the Spur-winged Plover and
Spoonbill have only managed to establish themselves in historical
times, perhaps because of the effect on the environment of the settlers.
The White-Eye (Zosterops lateralis) belongs to this group and is of as
recent origin in the fauna as many of the passerines that were introduced
by the early settlers ; in this case it is fairly certain that the trans-
Tasman migration was performed unaided for the initial irruptions
were in too great numbers to be accounted for by casual ship-borne
immigrants, nor is there apparently much evidence to show that the
invasion would have been less successful in an unsettled New Zealand,
for the species is now to be found as commonly in dense forest as in,
say, cultivated gardens.
The arrival of immigrants from the normal range of the species in
South-east Australia and Tasmania and their subsequent spread in
New Zealand has been relatively well documented ; the first major
irruption was probably in 1856 when large numbers appeared on the
west coast of the North Island, subsequently spreading very rapidly.
After a period of irregular inter-island migration and irregular breeding
the species settled down to its present habits and abundance. White-
Eyes are now perhaps the most abundant passerines in many parts of
New Zealand and during winter a flock may readily be induced to
remain in the garden by the use of feeding dishes of sugar-syrup or
diluted honey--at which they may be joined by Bellbirds ( Anthornis )
or Tuis ( Prosthemadera ) if there is any native forest nearby.

The diet is largely derived from the nectar of the many flowering
trees and shrubs that occur in New Zealand, from small soft berries
and from small insects. The illustration shows White-Eyes on
Coprosma, a very abundant bearer of berries and a favourite resort of
native birds during the winter months. White-Eyes are intensely
active and are often hard-pressed for food during the short period of
cold weather ; in common with other passerines which form winter
foraging flocks the birds are very quarrelsome at food and are con-
stantly going into threat display over a feeding dish. Two birds--for
no reason that is clear to the watcher--suddenly stare intently at each
other with open beaks and quivering wings and if the display becomes
more intense fly together and spiral upwards in the manner of fighting
Starlings. Without the use of colour rings, it is not easy to study the
social hierarchy of the flocks, but it is clear that there are dominant
and subordinate individuals due, perhaps, to differences in size and
aggressiveness ; however, the social structure is not very rigid and it
is not unusual to see a displaying couple return to the dish and feed
apparently amicably side by side. Clearly an interesting field awaits a

THE GOLDEN-SHOULDERED PARRAKEET

The recent acquisition of a pair of this little-known species, thanks
to the generosity of Sir Edward Hallstrom, has prompted the writing
of this article.
Discovery
As recorded by A. H. Chisholm in An Explorer and His Birds , John
Gilbert discovered the Beautiful, or Paradise, Parrakeet (Ps. pulcherrimus)
on the Darling Downs in 1844 an d, in the course of the Leichhardt
Expedition, he noted this species as far north as Comet Creek, approxi-
mately on the Tropic of Capricorn. It was not until about six months
later (17th June, 1845), when the expedition had reached the Mitchell
River, that Gilbert wrote " I was surprised to-day to meet with my
new Platycercus of the Downs, a species which has not been observed
with us since leaving Deception Camp on Comet Creek ". Three days
later he recorded the bird as being common and on 24th June, only
four days before his death--and while the party was still in the region
of the Mitchell--he wrote " The new Platycercus I saw in great
numbers ".
It is my belief that the birds he saw in the vicinity of the Mitchell

River were not his " Platycercus of the Downs 55 but that, in fact, he
had discovered its nearest relative, the Golden-shouldered Parrakeet.
I have discussed this several times with Chisholm, but he believes that
" Gilbert was so good an ornithologist that it seems extremely
improbable that he would mistake another species for his c new green
parrot 5 or that he would fail to recognise the Golden-shouldered as
new if he saw it Nevertheless, when the Golden-shouldered was
first imported into England, immature specimens were mistaken by
experienced aviculturists for the Paradise Parrakeet, with which they
were very familiar.
Be the foregoing as it may, it is, according to Cayley, just over
100 years since the species was described and named by Gould in 1858
from specimens obtained by Elsey in the Normanton district in 1856,
less than 200 miles to the south-west of the Mitchell River.
Introduction to Aviculture
Nothing further was heard of the species until some forty years
later when six living specimens were received in England in 1897
from the Continent, being at first thought to be immature Paradise
Parrakeets. Two of these, including the only male, were acquired by
the Zoological Gardens at Regent's Park, two by C. T. Maxwell, and
the remaining two by Reginald Phillipps, who wrote an interesting
article about them in Avicultural Magazine, July, 1898, p. 154,
accompanied by a reasonably good coloured plate by P. J. Smit.
A further two specimens, again both hens, are said to have come to
England in the following year but their destination does not appear to
be recorded. It seems probable that the whole of the original con-
signment did not reach England as a pair of hybrids between the
Golden-shouldered and Many-coloured Parrakeet, " presumably bred
in some continental aviary ", were received in 1901 by the London
Zoological Society and exhibited in their collection. As Cayley
comments, the locality from whence this importation came is
unrecorded, but it is of interest to note that examples of another
far-northern Queensland species, the White-eared Grassfinch (Poephila
leucotis ) were obtained by Reginald Phillipps at about the same time,
being the subject of an article by him in the next (August, 1898)
number of Avicultural Magazine, also accompanied by a coloured
plate by Smit.
The following year Phillipps (Avicultural Magazine, August,
1899, P- j 57 ) describes the laying of eggs by his surviving hen mated
to a cock Red-rumped Parrakeet and it is further noted that this hen
was still alive in November, 1902. In addition, C. T. Maxwell
exhibited two hens at the 1898 Crystal Palace Show and one the
following year and in February, 1901, and at the following show,
L. W. Hawkins exhibited a hen, possibly the same bird.

The Hooded Confusion
In Avicultural Magazine, November, 1902, p. 30, Mrs. M. A.
Johnstone writes, claiming to have obtained a pair of the species and
asking for and obtaining from Phillipps much information regarding
their management. Then in Avicultural Magazine, July, 1903,
p. 300, D. Seth-Smith describes seeing a pair, comprising one of the
hens from the original importation and a new cock bird, in the course
of a visit to the parrakeet collection of W. R. Fasey. As Seth-Smith
later points out (Avicultural Magazine, April, 1910, p. 197, and
May, 1910, pp. 223-4), it seems almost certain that Mrs. Johnstone's
pair and Fasey's cock bird (which may well have been obtained from
Mrs. Johnstone) were in fact Hooded Parrakeets (Ps. dissimilis ) and
probably constituted the first importation of the species, which had
only been described as recently as 1898, into England. It is worthy
of note that, as Cayley points out, the Bauer drawing, to which Gould
refers and which was made some forty years before the discovery of
the Golden-shouldered, was in fact a painting of the Hooded !
Rediscovery
Thereafter, it was not until April, 1915, that McLennan collected a
specimen on the Watson River, North Queensland and then, in 1922,
the same collector obtained and hand-reared some young birds ; ten
of which were presented to Taronga Park Zoo in June of that year and
lived there for several years without ever breeding.
Ken Stott, junior, writing in Avicultural Magazine, March-April,
1951, p. 68, lists the Golden-shouldered Parrakeet amongst " choice
items " that the Zoological Garden of San Diego have exhibited. In
reply to a query from me, Stott (in litt. 23rd December, 1952) states
that the birds in question were obtained by an agent in Australia
in 1925 and he feels certain that they were not mistakenly-identified
Hoodeds ; it seemed possible that Taronga Park may have been the
source of supply as other stock was obtained from there by San Diego
at the same time and this has subsequently been confirmed.
Then Dr. Donald Thomson in Birds of Cape York Peninsula , published
in 1935, describes his experiences of the species in the field, based on
three expeditions to North Queensland between the years 1928 and
1933 -
Establishment in Captivity
After an interval of about twenty years, one comes to what might
well be described as the Hallstrom era, or the recent history of the
species. Towards the end of 1953, shortly after I had visited him on
my way to England, Sir Edward obtained two adult hand-reared
males from the Coen district, Cape York Peninsula, and succeeded in
1954 in breeding hybrids from one of these birds, mated to a Hooded

hen. On my next visit to Sydney, which was not until March, 1955,
I saw the species in life for the first time and, as I recorded in
Avicultural Magazine, July-August, 1955, p. 214, there were then,
in addition to the two adult males, eight young birds which had
resulted from a second expedition sent to the Cape York area. On a
subsequent visit in August of the same year, there were about twenty
of the species in the collection, including further young resulting from
a third trip to their habitat.
In Avicultural Magazine, May-June, 1956, p. 118, Sir Edward
records having seventeen birds, including four mated pairs and
mentions hybrids bred from the two original males with Hooded mates.
In October, 1956, I was again privileged to see the collection and
at that time was shown a nest containing five half-grown, pure-bred
young as I recorded in Avicultural Magazine, January-February,
1957, p. 35. Obviously, these were the first of many later successful
breedings for, in Avicultural Magazine, November-December, 1957,
p. 197, Sir Edward stated that he then had fifteen pairs, plus a few
odd cocks, and he also mentioned that birds only a year old had
nested and reared young. Writing again in Avicultural Magazine,
May-June, 1959, p. 79, Hallstrom stated that his flock had grown
to about forty birds and when I visited him in August, 1959, there
seemed to be about this number and he was generous enough to present
me with a pair which had been bred during the winter of 1958,
i.e. in the first of the customary two nests. The cock of this pair was
at that stage about one-third coloured and now at the time of writing
(December, 1959), he has attained full adult plumage and is in perfect
condition, as is his mate.
Description
As most parrot lovers know, a Many-coloured Parrakeet is
appreciably slimmer than a Red-rumped and similarly, a Hooded
Parrakeet is noticeably slimmer than a Many-coloured. Therefore, to
describe a Golden-shouldered as appreciably slimmer than a Hooded
and noticeably smaller should convey the impression of the extremely
stream-lined and graceful appearance of the species which differs from
the Hooded in other respects far more in life than is expected from a
study of skins or illustrations.
The cock bird differs, therefore, from the Hooded in the following
features, viz. ( a ) the presence of a broad, creamy-yellow frontal band,
which is sometimes tinged with green ; ( b ) a triangular black cap
entirely above the eyes and consequently not as extensive as that of
the Hooded ; (c) the mantle is slaty-grey rather than brownish-black
as in the Hooded ; (d) the shoulder patch is only about half the extent
of that of the Hooded and is more truly golden-yellow ; (e) the breast
is noticeably turquoise-blue as opposed to turquoise-green in the

Hooded ; and (f) the abdomen and subcaudals are pinkish-red with
white margins to the feathers unlike the salmon subcaudals and
occasional thigh feathers of the Hooded.
The hen bird resembles the Hooded hen more closely than does her
mate, but differs in the following important respects, viz. (a) the
presence of a definite pale cream frontal band ; ( b ) a faint but
noticeable triangular brownish cap which is absent in Hooded hens ;
( c ) the complete absence of blue cheek patches which are always
present to some degree in Hooded hens ; (d) the presence of pale
pink abdominal feathers, also edged with white ; and (e) pale green
subcaudals unlike the salmon of Hooded hens.
Immatures in first plumage closely resemble adult hens, but young
cocks have faintly outlined black caps and bright blue cheeks. Both
sexes show some trace of pink on the abdomen, but none on the
subcaudals.

In contradistinction to the Hooded, this species has been frequently
portrayed. As already noted, Smit's plate in Avicultural Magazine,
July, 1898, facing p. 154, is reasonably accurate, especially of the
cock, but rather misses the shape. Gould's plate, which is reproduced
in Barrett's Parrots of Australasia, opposite p. 73, is quite good, especially
of the hen, but the backs of the cocks are too greenish. Mathews'
plate by Gronvold (Vol. 7, opposite p. 431), is very good of the cock
except the mantle is too brown ; the hen is shown quite incorrectly as
having brownish cheeks. Reichenow's plate (PI. 23, Fig. 6) is fairly
accurately coloured, but gives the bird the dumpy figure of a Red-rump.
Cayley's plates in his Australian Parrots (PI. VIII, Figs. 4 and 4 a) are
quite good for their size, as is his plate of a male in The Emu (Vol. 24,
PI. 1, lower figure). Renaut's plate in Seth-Smith's Parrakeets , facing
p. 202, is quite shapely, but the lovely blue shades have been completely
missed. Perhaps the best plate of all is a black and white drawing by
the master psittacine illustrator, Goodchild, which appeared in
Bird Notes , December, 1909, p. 271.

By Prof. Carl Naether (Encino, California)
Following Mr. Arthur A. Prestwich's suggestion, I am giving below a
brief description of the aviary I had built at my new home in the
San Fernando Valley. In planning it, my aim was to keep my soft-
billed birds and foreign doves as safe as possible from nocturnal
#C visitors ", such as cats, owls, opossums, as well as from diurnal
&lt;s callers ", such as mice, snakes, lizards, and even rats. Off and on,
all these more or less destructive prowlers seriously troubled the
occupants of my old aviaries--from above by crawling or settling on
top of the wire-flight ; from below by burrowing under and through
the aviary floor.
In my new aviary, now ij years old, my birds have been troubled
by none of the above-mentioned pests ; consequently, there are no
doves with bashed-in heads or injured wings, no nests deserted during
nights of terror. Best of all, both doves and softbills, being no longer
subject to sudden frights, are much tamer and gentler--they feel much
more at home in their new aviary.
This aviary is a simple structure made of tongue-and-groove
redwood, set on an 18-inch concrete foundation, most of which is
sunk into the soil. There are ten pens or compartments, each 4 feet
wide and 16 feet deep. At the front, the entire structure is 8 feet high,
sloping to 6 feet at the rear, to facilitate a rapid run-off of water during
the rainy season.
The entire building is roofed over, with sufficient overhang on the
front and the sides, thus preventing cats, etc., from disturbing the
birds from above. The building faces east, the various pens getting
the benefit of the morning sun to a depth of nearly 6 feet, at which
point the solid-walled shelter-portions begin. Growing ferns and
shrubs likewise benefit from the daily morning sunshine. All floors
are earthen.
In order to prevent mice, lizards, and other undesirable animals
from entering the aviary through the wire-netting, I have used
J-inch mesh all round the outside. And to render the interior of the
aviary more visible from the outside, I have painted the netting on
both sides with black enamel. Incidentally, J-inch mesh also prevents
birds from pressing their beaks into the netting and thus injuring the
area surrounding the beaks, as is so often the case when birds dash
against, and into, wide-mesh netting.
Natural light is provided amply, not only from the outside through
the wire-netting, but also through windows placed in the rear-walls
of the various compartments. Moreover, the back-walls of all com-
partments are painted white, as is also the whole interior of the first

two compartments, facing east and south, which house various male
softbills. Ventilation, but rarely required, is provided by the windows,
which slide open sideways, and which are covered with fine wire-
netting on the outside to prevent escape of birds.
The aviary has but one, solid, outside door--the entrance. The
doors to the various compartments, all screened, are located in the
rear and in a straight line. Thus, I can go through the compartments
without disturbing any of the occupants, since most of them prefer to
stay away from the extreme rear. There is, of course, a sufficient
number of hydrants to facilitate providing water for both birds and
plants. Since we get neither snow nor ice in the San Fernando Valley,
there is no need for artificial heating. In fact, at this writing,
1st December, the temperature is nearly 8o* F., and as usual, there is
warm sunshine quite early in the morning, and much enjoyed by the
birds.
Each compartment is planted with shrubs to a depth of 3 or 4 feet
to lend the aviary an informal and natural appearance. Moreover,
both softbills and doves seem to like growing plants. All feed and water
dishes are placed in the shelter (rear) portion of each compartment,&apos;
where they can be kept clean and cool, and where they are readily
accessible without disturbing the birds. Nesting facilities for the doves
are likewise placed in the shelter-portion of the aviary, most of the
species which I keep preferring to nest in shady and semi-dark places.
The floors of the compartments in which softbills are kept are covered
with fresh leaf-mould to a depth of 6 inches, which the birds " work
over " time and time again in search of grubs and earthworms, and
which is added to at frequent intervals.
Presently, the aviary houses various doves, such as Mountain Witch,
Splendid, Bartlett, and Luzon Bleeding Heart, Ruddy Quail, and other
species, as well as numerous species of insectivorous and frugivorous
birds, including Yuhinas, Bluethroats, Rubythroats, Whitethroats,
Redstarts, Bluebirds, also various tanagers and thrushes. Since all
occupants have been doing well now for 1J years in their new home,
it is reasonably safe to conclude that they like it there. All species of
doves, except the Splendid Pigeons, imported not very long ago, have
reared young to maturity in their respective compartments.
All in all, I am very much satisfied with my new aviary since it
affords my feathered friends sunshine and security day in and day
out--and, what is also important, ample room in which to fly and to
carry on nesting and other activities. The aviary, simple though it is
represents a considerable monetary investment, which, however, is
already paying dividends in that it provides increased comfort,
security, and general well-being for all my birds and doves.

SOME OBSERVATIONS ON THE DIAMOND DOVE

By Derek Goodwin (London, England)
After I had, in the summer of 1956, left my former home at Virginia
Water, I was for some time without any captive birds. In early 1958,
however, I purchased a small house in south-east London. The
density of the domestic cat population here does not permit anything
in the nature of an outdoor aviary, but I soon managed to turn a spare
room into an indoor one. Since the only small doves available in the
dealers I could visit were Diamond Doves ( Geopelia cuneata ), a pair
of them was purchased and installed ; together with some Blue-
breasted Waxbills and Golden-breasted Waxbills. To my surprise
I could find no detailed information on the behaviour, or other points
of interest, of the Diamond Dove in either the avicultural or ornitho-
logical journals in which I searched. I hope in this article to make
some attempt towards remedying this apparent deficiency. My
observations have been chiefly on my own pair and their progeny,
of which were kept a cock and a hen till fully adult ; but I have
checked their behaviour with briefer observations of other captive
Diamond Doves in zoos and bird dealers' collections, and corre-
sponded with Mr. R. A. Richardson who also keeps Diamond Doves
and has been kind enough to put his observations at my disposal.
I greatly hope that anyone who can give further information will be
stimulated to do so by reading this. Although the Diamond Dove
will be familiar to most readers I will venture to describe it for the
convenience of any who do not know it, since, personally, I find
nothing so aggravating as trying to picture an animal I do not know
and of whose appearance the writer does not inform me.
The Diamond Dove is the smallest of the Australian pigeons ;
being, indeed, one of the three smallest pigeons in the world. It
belongs to the same genus as the larger Peaceful Dove ( Geopelia striata)
and the still larger Bar-shouldered Dove (G. humeralis ). Although
the Geopelia species show some general resemblance to turtle doves

and geographical distribution show, in my opinion, that their
nearest relatives are the various Australian " bronzewings " ( Phaps ,
Ocyphaps , Petrophassa , Geophaps et al.). The Diamond Dove is about
the size of a Skylark but with a plumper body and longer tail.
The cock has the head, neck, breast, and wing-coverts a soft grey,
sometimes a little intermixed with brown. The back and scapulars
are darkish, soft brown. The wing-coverts and scapulars are orna-
mented with small white spots, each with a narrow blackish border.
The four long central tail feathers are dark, brownish grey ; the
next pair have white tips, and the remaining tail feathers have rather

more than the outermost half white. The iris is brilliant red with a
narrow silver inner ring and the eye is surrounded with a wide circle
of bright orange-red orbital skin. The undersides of the primaries,
and those portions of their upper sides that do not show when the wing
is folded, are chestnut. The female is duller than her mate, with more
brown suffusion in her grey parts and with paler, more orange-pink
orbital skin.
Display and Behaviour
The bowing display (for terminology of display and voice see
Goodwin, 1956) is similar to that of the Bar-shouldered Dove except
for the position of the head at the culmination of the bow (see sketch).
The tail is fully raised and spread. Commonly the bow may be
frontal but if, as very often happens, the hen is to one side of the cock
he tilts his head, and sometimes to a less extent his body and tail
towards her. During the bowing display and immediately before

giving it the cock Diamond Dove arranges his head feathers so that
a very slight peak is formed at just the place of the crest of the Crested
Pigeon. Doubtless the same feathers are involved in both species and
this seemingly trivial point (no pun intended !) is, I think, a further
indication of their close affinity. The bowing display seems to be
used only in sexual contexts as in the Streptopelia species (see Goodwin,
1956). I have not seen it used by female Diamond Doves or " between
rounds 55 by fighting males. Further observations are desirable on
this point, however, as the not very distantly related Crested Pigeon
[Ocyphaps lophotes) certainly bows in hostile as well as purely sexual
situations.
The Diamond Dove has two forms of a wing-lifting display very
similar to and probably homologous with that shown by some Columba
species. In the upright version the bird stands bolt upright (but with
head held low, not with neck upstretched) and holds the folded wings
opened more or less in line with the back. The posture is very close
to that used by the male Common Bronzewing (Phaps chalcoptera)
after copulation. In the Diamond Dove I have only seen it from the
Wing-lifting display, horizontal version.

100 D. GOODWIN-SOME OBSERVATIONS ON THE DIAMOND DOVE
sexually excited male. He flies a little way from the female (usually
after displaying to her), alights and at once adopts the upright wing-
lifting posture. Usually this strongly stimulates his mate, she flies
to him and billing and copulation follow. The horizontal version of
this display is shown when a male is sexually excited by a bird perched
or alighting above him or (as in Columba) when another dove flies
overhead. He then lowers his head and spreads his folded wings.
I have seen low intensity versions of both forms of the display from
an unpaired female who was 56 trying to attract the interest 55 of the
male of her choice. It is extremely likely that these two different
versions of this display (which will probably be found to intergrade)
have reference to the position of the bird whose presence or appearance
releases it. When the latter is on a level with or lower than the dis-
playing bird the upright version will be used and when it is above the
horizontal ; in either case the dorsal view of the flattened wings, with
their pattern of white spots, being exhibited to the bird eliciting the
display.
The nodding of the Diamond Dove is shown, like that of other
pigeons (Goodwin, 19560) in both hostile and friendly encounters.
It is derived from nest-building movements and signifies the bird's
intention of " holding its ground ". As in its relative, the Bar-
shouldered, the Diamond Dove makes a quivering " twig-fixing "
movement at the culmination of each nod, although in the present
species the movement is usually less pronounced and may be only
slightly indicated.
As in other doves (Goodwin, 19560) " driving " of the female by
the male is usually motivated by sexual jealousy ; the male tries to
drive his mate away from any possible rivals. The male may, however
(and the same is true of other pigeons), try to drive his mate from
any place where he feels ill at ease or frightened but not sufficiently
so to flee without her. Thus I have repeatedly seen a cock Diamond
Dove drive his hapless mate because he was frightened at my presence,
oblivious to the fact that she could no more escape from the room
than he could. Similarly I have seen a cock domestic Pigeon drive
a tame female Rock-Dove, with which he was mated, from a strange
garden in which she (lacking the domestic pigeon's inhibition against
alighting in strange places) had settled. When attacking an enemy, or
while driving his mate, the Diamond Dove has a habit of jumping
suddenly at the other bird, then pausing for a moment with upright
head and swollen neck.
The mating ceremonial of the Diamond Dove is of particular interest
in that whereas in Columba and Streptopelia the aggressiveness and fear
involved are expressed only in symbolic gestures, in the Diamond
Dove overt aggression is part of the ritual. After the usual billing
the male mounts the female, gives a single coo, dismounts, at once

Posture of $ Diamond Dove (left) immediately after jumping aggressively at $.
utters a loud cry, and strikes the hen with his wing as he does so. He
then remounts and repeats the process but dismounting on the opposite
side and striking with the other wing. After this he mounts, gives a
double coo, and then copulation takes place. Immediately afterwards
he attacks the hen in a very formal manner. She flees only a foot or so
from him, he draws himself up aggressively but does not pursue her,
and they are on " friendly terms " within a few moments. Sometimes,
but not often, the cock mounts, dismounts, and strikes the hen several
times before copulating. Whitman (1919, p. 17) gives a description of
the mating ceremonial of the Bar-shouldered Dove (Geopelia humeralis)
which differs in some minor points from that I have described for the
Diamond Dove, chiefly in that the male humeralis is said to " strike
its wings together over its back ", not to strike the female. Whitman
adds, however, that " cuneata does the same ". I cannot help feeling
that there may be some mistake here, perhaps occasioned by the fact
that Whitman's great work had to be compiled posthumously. If
any reader can enlighten us as to whether humeralis and cuneata really
differ in their mating behaviour, whether the Diamond Dove does
at times strike its wings together over its back and not hit its mate,
or whether the details of Whitman's description are at fault ?
Head-shaking is shown by the Diamond Dove, as by other pigeons
(Goodwin, 1956a) not only as a response to physical irritation but also,
apparently, as a response to some psychologically displeasing stimuli.
A sexually active adult will often head-shake whenever another
Diamond Dove (other than its own mate) coos.
Nesting and parental care do not differ from the same behaviour
in other pigeons. The eggs, however, are laid in the early morning,
with an interval of only about twenty-four hours between them. Some
writers on avicultural matters (since I must criticize their conclusions
I refrain from giving references !) state that Diamond Doves are seldom
good parents ; that they neglect the young after the latter leave the
nest, if not before ; and that the young when they leave the nest fall

to the ground and are some days before they can fly. Now whilst
some Diamond Doves may be defective as parents (and many more
will no doubt be in the future if fanciers start breeding them for
physical deformities as they do fancy pigeons, canaries, and
Budgerigars !), I doubt if most are and I think the clue to their un-
satisfactory behaviour may really lie in the food supplied. Certainly
the very people who complain about their defective parental qualities
often state that they need only their " usual seed " when rearing
young. Now although pigeons produce crop milk and no doubt can,
to some extent, make good deficiencies in the food obtained by drawing
on their own bodies when feeding young there is no doubt that at such
times they do far better if they have a richer diet than they would
otherwise need. I find that my Diamond Doves, like all other species
of pigeons that I have successfully bred in captivity, eagerly consume
large amounts of " Kilpatrick's pigeon minerals " during the period
of maximum bone and feather growth of the young. Unlike most other
doves I have kept, my Diamonds will not take milk-sop or cooked egg
when they are feeding young but they seem rather more eager for
sprouted seeds and greenfood then than at other times. I supply
them with maw seed ad lib (in addition to canary and yellow millet),
Kilpatrick's minerals and crushed eggshell and give them fresh earth
with sprouting seed in it and greenfood (fixed firmly so they pick
pieces from the leaves which they cannot do unless the plant is firmly
fixed) every day. So far this regime has been very successful. Although
they are in a small room, not a nice large outdoor aviary, all the young
hatched have been able to fly at eleven or twelve days old ; have not
come to the ground until several days after leaving the nest ; and have
been fed by the parents (who in each case have laid again and started
incubation of the new clutch when the young were from ten to fifteen
days old) until they were strong on the wing and quite capable of
fending for themselves.
I suspect the other accusation often levelled against these and other
doves--that they are incompetent nest-builders--is also due to human
rather than avian incapacity. The room in which I keep my birds is
fitted up with sundry branches and bits of trees. My Diamond Doves
several times selected more or less " natural " sites among the branches
but never managed to get a proper nest built unless I fixed some extra
support for them. This was when I had supplied only fine twigs and
grass stems gathered without much selection on my part. One day,
however, I found a Jay's nest, in good condition, that someone had
evidently thrown down. I took all the fine wiry twigs, rootlets, etc.
from its inner part and threw them on the floor of the room. As a
result the old pair of Diamond Doves in less than two days built
a perfect nest among the branches, in a position where they had twice
before tried, and utterly failed to lodge a nest.

The various comfort movements--preening, sunning, shaking, etc,
of the Diamond Dove are the same as those of other pigeons. Mine do
not appear to bathe, however, at least I have never seen them do so.
Probably they would rain-bathe if they were in an open aviary.
Voice
In my previous paper on the voice and display of some pigeons
(Goodwin, 1956) I said that the vocal utterances of those species of
Streptopelia and Columba known to me could be divided into four
basic calls, which I termed the ## Advertising-coo ", the " Display-
coo ", the " Distress-call ", and the ## Excitement-cry ". Up to a
point this terminology can be used for the Diamond Dove's notes,
although this latter bird is far more loquacious and ## talkative "
than the other genera mentioned. The Diamond Dove has two quite
distinct advertising-coos. One is a pleasant if rather sad, or anyrate
" mournfully resigned " sounding ## Coo-coo, coo, coo-coo ", and the
other a two-note phrase consisting of a rather harsh, nasal-sounding
coo (very suggestive to my ears of a human snore), followed by a
## normal " coo. One could perhaps write it " Cor-coo " or ## Coorh-
coo ". At full intensity the advertising coos are quite loud and all the
notes, except for the snoring " Cor " are very clear and ## pure " in
tone. At lower intensities they are less loud and clear, often higher-
pitched and sometimes ## broken " or varying in pitch. The female's
advertising coos are always much less loud than the male's, although
the female's " song " at very high intensity may be rather like a low
intensity version from the male.
I can find no difference in the function or causation of the two
forms of advertising coo when they are used as song or, as they often
are at low intensity, as apparent contact notes between members of
a pair. Mr. Richardson informs me (in litt.) that he thinks that the
## Cor-coo " expresses a greater intensity of emotion. In my experience,
however, the male Diamond Dove habitually varies his ## songs ",
uttering one or two " Cor-coos " followed by one or more ## Coo-coo,
coo, coo-coos " and so on.
The ## Cor-coo " (but not the five-note advertising coo) is also
used as a nest-call. When given by a nest-calling bird it is usually
less clear and more drawn out, with the nasal tone of the first note
more pronounced and often also permeating the final ## coo ". Paired
Diamond Doves very frequently utter rather quiet calls with the same
nasal, snoring or growling quality of sound as the ## Cor " note. These
are given by members of a pair together on the nest site when one
alights near the other, as if in greeting, or as contact notes. Usually
if one of these calls is given by either male or female its mate at once
answers. They intergrade completely into the full versions of the
advertising coos and might be considered as nothing more than low

intensity variants of them but for the fact that they appear never to be
uttered by solitarily-kept male birds (I have not been able to observe
a singly-kept female) which, naturally, give the advertising coo with
much greater frequency and at higher intensity than is usual with
a paired male. The low nasal calls appear to function to express
affectionate emotion between members of a pair and also as contact
notes when they are fairly near to each other. They do not appear to
be used in aggressive contexts and thus are not analogous to the
excitement-cry of Streptopelia species although they are used in some
situations where a " turtle dove 55 would give the excitement cry.
The display-coo is an emphatic " Oh (wa) " or " Coorh (wa) "
the " wa " sound at the end being, apparently, an audible inspiration
which immediately follows the cooing note. The display-coo is given
in time with the bow and, because of its similar tempo, it is suggestive
of the display-coos of both the Spotted Dove and the Turtle Dove.
The distress-call is a panting gasp, like that of other pigeons, but
higher-pitched than in Columba or Streptopelia , due no doubt to the
Diamond Dove's much smaller size. It thus has a somewhat different,
more whistling and less grunting sound and this difference is heightened
by the fact that the Diamond Dove nearly always gives a whole series
of gasping distress notes strung together in succession before pausing.
As in other pigeons it is given not only at the sight of a bird of prey
or some other predator but also when the caller's feelings seem to be
those of annoyance, discomfort, or indecision rather than fear.
When the male Diamond Dove strikes at the female prior to copula-
tion he gives a loud " explosive-sounding " cry, suggestive, to my ears, of
the " spitting " of a domestic cat in its defensive-threat display. This
cry may possibly be comparable to or even homologous with the excite-
ment cry of some Streptopelia species. It does not appear to be used,
at any rate I have never heard it, in any other situation, not even
by fighting or threatening individuals. However, in this connection
it may be mentioned that the Mourning Dove (see Craig, 1911) has
a call which is thought to represent the excitement-cry of Streptopelia
but which it utters only immediately after copulation.
As compared with Columba and Streptopelia , or at least the species of
those genera with which I am familiar, the Diamond Dove impresses
one by its much greater " talkativeness ". The frequent calling and
answering between members of a pair being suggestive of passerine
birds. Similar behaviour is shown by the Bar-shouldered Dove and,
according to Newman's (Newman, 1908) most interesting account,
also by the Partridge Bronzewing ( Geophaps scripta). Like other
doves, the Diamond not infrequently coos at night often, apparently,
as a response to some noise or other stimulus that has disturbed but
not greatly alarmed it. Although the act of cooing might have a
beneficial psychological effect (similar to that of a man who is a little

afraid whistling to himself in the dark) on the bird it is difficult to
believe it can have any other function. One would indeed have
thought it a habit that would have proved highly dangerous to the
species indulging in it.

Postscript:
Subsequent to writing the above I have, on four occasions, seen the
old pair of Diamond Doves copulate when perched facing me at eye
level and only a yard away. Each time I noted the following points
additional to my previous observations.
(1) As the male struck at the female after billing, she crouched and
his wing went just over her head and back, but did not appear actually
to hit her. (2) Immediately afterwards the female raised her head,
inserted her bill in the male's open mouth and they billed very briefly
(only for a second or so) before he re-mounted. (3) When the male
showed aggression immediately after copulation, no actual contact of
his bill with the female appeared to be made. (4) Just before striking
out at the female, the male's two wings appeared (the movements were
so quick that I cannot be entirely sure) to meet over his back.
Since on all four instances the behaviour was the same, I think I
must have failed to notice the above actions previously, when I had
less perfect views, although I think that at least on some of them,
billing did not take place between striking and re-mounting. It is now
evident that the aggression involved is less overt than I had thought.
Also that the behaviour is even closer to that of the Bar-shouldered
Dove than my previous observations had suggested.

By Dr. H. D. Groen, Haren (Groningen), Holland
There is no doubt that there has lately been a great increase in the
interest in Australian parrots in Holland and to-day we have many
fine private collections owned by enthusiastic breeders with some ?
experience. Besides there is a steadily increasing number of fanciers j
starting to specialize in parrot keeping. One of the causes of this
flare-up of an old hobby might well be the presence of some very
attractice bird parks in Holland, to mention only the well-known
" Avifauna " at Alphen-on-the-Rhine and also the unique " Louise
Hall " at Wassenaar, naturally working as a stimulus. Another factor i
surely is the ease with which parrots could be obtained in Holland.
Owing to the activities of some big import firms, until recently huge
numbers of birds, and specially of parrots, have been imported. We
should, however, not rely too much on these imports in the future, in
consequence of all sorts of restrictions either at home or in Australia.
This article deals only with private collections, as in my opinion the
aviaries of amateurs are actually the most suitable for breeding and
establishing stock. Bird parks and zoos may be useful for propaganda
purposes, but they are definitely not the places designed for breeding
on a large scale and they will never be sources to rely on for future
supply. Certainly there are some breeding results, but these results
are inversely proportionate to the number of birds kept, owing to the j
disturbance made by thousands of visitors, specially
breeding season.
For some years now a number of aviculturists have been attempting
to build up breeding stocks of one or more particular favourite species,
or of rarities which are difficult to replace in case of loss. Some of
them specialize in JVeophemas, others in the Psephotus group and again
others in the larger sized parrots. It is my ambition to collect the
entire range of the Australian Broadtails, that is to say all the
Australian parrot-like birds except the lorikeets and the cockatoos, I
keeping only one or two pairs of the commoner species and trying to
establish studs of the rarer kinds. Of course this may be a remote
possibility as some species have not been imported into Holland so far.
Further restriction is imposed dependent on factors such as space and
time. Time, if you agree that the best thing to do is to look after your
birds yourself. About thirty species of Australian Broadtails are now
and again available to Dutch aviculturists. Keeping one pair of
twenty species and three or more pairs of the rarer kinds to secure
unrelated offspring, means at least fifty aviaries. Another ten aviaries
for young birds and for quarantine quarters makes a total of sixty and
this, I think, should be the limit if the job is to be done properly.

H. D. GROEN-AUSTRALIAN PARROT KEEPING IN HOLLAND 107
Space is another important factor. Some people unfortunately keep
too many birds in too cramped flights and this undoubtedly does not
encourage good health in birds which are to be confined in them for
a long time. Other more fortunate breeders have their aviaries
dispersed over a large area, thus preventing the pugnacious birds
disturbing each other during the breeding season. Of course this has
great advantages, but, on the other hand, one makes the collection
more vulnerable to vermin, the structure is more costly, and feeding,
etc. takes a lot of time.
My aviaries are built in a closed space with separate fence and are
constructed in rows with communicating doors between the com-
partments. Closely related pairs are housed as far away from each
other as possible. The length of the flights varies from 36 yards for
the largest parrots to 14 yards for the Neophemas.
The following systematic enumeration of the species deals only with
birds in my aviaries, or in the collections of other Dutch amateurs,
and consequently is not complete.
Genus Polytelis.
Princess of Wales' Parrakeet. Though our stock of these delightful
birds is not substantial there has been a definite increase in numbers
during the last few years. I have three pairs in stock for the coming
season and last year two pairs successfully reared twelve fine young,
one pair being double-brooded. There is a great demand for hens,
most breeders having a surplus of young cocks.
Young males are not difficult to distinguish as they start bobbing
up and down almost as soon as they are independent. Though not
frequently, they may perform this premature display a few times a day.
These birds were caught and separated from the others as there is at
that stage no other obvious sexual difference and time proved that it
was correct.
One often hears of broken eggs. Maybe it is just luck that so far I
have not had one spoiled egg, or is it because my logs are placed in
a very sloping position at an angle of about 40 degrees from the ground
to prevent the birds from falling or jumping on the eggs ? Moreover,
a strip of wire netting is nailed on the inside of the logs along which the
hens go down.
The Barraband's Parrakeets don't seem to be valued as much as they
should by Dutch fanciers and consequently the few that are bred
silently disappear over our borders. I have two pairs now and the
old pair reared three young (two males and one female) the past year
and five young (one male and four females) the year before. There
is also a fine breeding pair in the parrot collection of Dr. Doctor van
Leeuwen at Tiel. At a rough estimate we have altogether eight pairs
in the country rearing some twenty young every year. Very scarce at

the moment are the Rock Peplars. Although there were various
breeding successes in Belgium and Germany, not one successful
breeding was reported in Holland during the past season. I acquired
some imported birds a few years ago, but it soon became apparent
that they were infected with the dreaded eye disease and ultimately
they died.
Genus Aprosmictus.
My only pair of King Parrakeets has so far omitted to take any
interest in matrimonial affairs. These birds were imported from
Australia six and seven years ago in immature plumage. Every kind
of nesting accommodation has been supplied each year, including
very long logs and natural hollow tree trunks in the open flight.
During the past season feeding was noticed for the first time, but the
birds came into a heavy moult early in July, so that was another
blank year. I know two owners with good breeding pairs, but though
all eggs were fertile, they failed to hatch, probably owing to the
abnormal dryness last year. Before the prohibition of the importation
of parrots from Australia in 1957 these majestic birds were imported
into Holland quite regularly, but at present they are not offered.
I consider myself lucky to have one good breeding pair of Crimson-
winged Parrakeets, having bred and reared young for the past two
years now (two and two). Though there are one or two males in
different collections, pairs are extremely rare and I know of only one
more breeding success the past season by Mr. van Heyst, who has
three pairs in his collection. We have seen here a variety of these
lovely birds, being smaller and even more brightly coloured, but more
difficult to acclimatize. According to the information these birds were
imported from Dutch New Guinea.
Genus Purpureicephalus.
Red-capped Parrakeets have been imported spasmodically in small
numbers in the past. I have been unlucky with this species, having
lost two hens this year and no breeding results. My birds are obviously
wild-caught specimens, very unsteady and shy as are all the others in
Holland. Consequently owners of these birds initially don't get much
joy out of them. We are looking forward to some aviary-bred birds,
but though Red-capped Parrakeets have been bred years ago, breeding
successes have not been reported in Holland since the last war.
During the past season at least one brood of Red-capped Parrakeets
was reared in Germany and another in Belgium. There is another
thing, since keeping Australians only and having disposed of all the
other parrot-like birds, I had forgotten about the destructive disposition
of some parrot species. Now the Pileated have reminded me of this
undesirable habit.

Common Rosellas and Golden-mantled Rosellas are well-established
and can be seen in many aviaries all over the country. There are
usually two or three pairs in my collection, rearing a number of young
every year. Also the Stanley Parrakeets are fairly numerous and
steadily increasing, though it is still difficult to supply sufficient birds
to the growing number of fanciers who start parrot keeping. Well-
established strains of Stanleys are kept by Mr. Danklof at Udenhout
and Mr. Westerweel at Zwolle. I used to have three pairs rearing
broods of four and five young, but always being single brooded.
Last year two pairs were exchanged for other species. The only pair
left for the first time had infertile eggs, but made themselves useful
by incubating five Pennant's eggs, of which four hatched. These four
young Pennants were successfully reared by their foster-parents.
But for the first time I had no young Stanleys. Pale-headed Rosellas
have been the steadiest breeders in this collection. The past season
seventeen healthy young birds were reared from two pairs, both being
double-brooded. One of these pairs also reared two young Pennants,
which grew up with the young Mealies in the same nest. It always
comes in handy to have a good many breeding Rosella hens for
brooding deserted eggs, as all Rosellas rear related Rosella species
without trouble. Golden-mantled have successfully reared young
Mealies, Stanleys, Pennants and vice-versa in my aviaries. Mealies
are very popular and much in demand, but are still not too abundant.
When I started with this species eight years ago, aviary-bred birds
were difficult to get so imported stock was bought. These appeared
to be very delicate and out of the eight imported birds four died within
a month. Of all the aviary-bred birds I have since bred, so far I have
never had a casualty.
Not as reliable regarding breeding in my experience are the
Pennant's Parrakeets. One old hen produces great numbers of eggs,
this year twenty, but always neglects to brood. Yet with the aid of the
Stanley and Mealy foster-parents six young Pennant's fledged. Many
people possess Pennant's, mostly imported birds and unlike the Pale-
headed Rosellas, imported Pennant's have proved to be much stronger.
Adelaide Rosellas, though imported regularly in the past, are definitely
not so popular here as in neighbouring countries. There are less than
a half-dozen pairs in Holland. So far I have not secured a pair, but
as they are still offered now and again, they will be included in my
collection for the sake of completeness. Brown's Parrakeets are now
very scarce and I know of only one good pair, always starting to breed
in the first half of August, just in time to get a nest of young ready
before the winter. Unfortunately just recently the old hen died, so
this may be a setback for years.
Yellow-rumped Rosellas and also Tasmanian Rosellas are almost

non-existent here. Mr. de Graaf at Roosendaal has a good breeding
pair of the first mentioned species and I had a pair imported, but both
birds died within a couple of months. Also very rare are the Port
Lincoln, the Twenty-Eights, and the Barnard's Parrakeets. Breeding
successes have not been reported lately.
Genus Psephotus.
The Red-rumped Parrakeets are firmly established and are very
popular, specially with beginners. They were the first birds in my
collection and proved very prolific. Later my stock was reduced to
only one pair. Yellows seem to be very abundant in Belgium since
a few years and are now invading our country from the south. Many-
coloured Parrakeets are not numerous, probably owing to their reputa-
tion of being very delicate. I wonder if they really are. These attractive
aviary birds were imported regularly until recently, but most of them
seem to have found their way straight abroad. At a rough estimate
there are not more than ten breeding pairs in the country. I possess
one pair and efforts will be made to increase this number in the
future. The three pairs of Blue-bonnet Parrakeets at present in
Holland are all of the yellow-vented race, the least rare variety, if
I am right. Breeding successes seem to be almost unknown. Before
the last war it was Dr. Polak at Amersfoort who had success with this
species. A pair of the red-vented race produced a clutch of four eggs
in 1937, but the hen failed to brood. The four eggs were incubated by
a hen Red-rumped Parrakeet and the three young hatched were fully
reared. Hooded Parrakeets are almost unknown, not only in Holland,
but also in other countries on the Continent. There are only five birds
in this country. Mr. Breed at Heilo, who is concentrating on the
smaller-sized Australian parrakeets, has two pairs of Hooded Parra-
keets in his collection but I possess only one hen. If it is impossible to
obtain a cock, I shall mate her with a cock Many-coloured and hope
to breed the pretty hybrid, which is said to resemble the Paradise
Parrakeet so much. Hoodeds have also been bred by Dr. Polak on
two occasions, in 1937 and 1938 (four and three young). These birds
nested in an ordinary wooden nest-box. Finally, I would like to mention
the two couples of lovely Hooded Parrakeets I have seen in the extensive
Moscicki collection of Mr. Melides at Brussels last year. I do hope he
will get some young Hoodeds this year.
Genus Neophema.
With Elegant Grass Parrakeets Dutch aviculturists definitely have
missed their chance. I have seen cages full of them at the importer's
office and yet where have they all gone ? It is said that this species is
more or less domesticated in England, well here they are not. They
are not as spectacular in appearance and not so brilliantly coloured as

olive colouring. There is only one pair in my collection, but attempts
will be made to get breeding stock of this neglected species. The same
applies to the Blue-winged Grass Parrakeets and it is estimated that
there are not more than five pairs in the country. Only recently
I acquired an adult pair and hope to get some offspring this season.
The brilliantly coloured Turquoisines are increasing well in numbers
every year. This species is much in demand and more and more
fanciers start keeping them. We have a number of aviculturists
possessing fairly good strains of Turquoisines and with careful manage-
ment we might be able to maintain a healthy breeding stock. There
are now four pairs in my collection. Not so good are the prospects
with the Splendid Grass Parrakeets. These gorgeous birds are still
very difficult to obtain and I am glad to have at least one pair. Only
two people possess a reasonable stock and it is to be hoped that after
the coming season a few young birds will come on the market. Bourke
Parrakeets finally are very abundant nowadays and increase by leaps
and bounds so that they may be considered domesticated. Some
birds I have seen are hardly any more coloured than sparrows,
probably owing to inbreeding, not only here but doubtless already
before they get here, if one considers that the breeding stock in
Australia probably originates from a few wild-caught birds. On the
other hand one encounters many very attractive, brightly coloured
Bourke's here. My three breeding pairs are of decent size and colouring
and they have been very steady and reliable breeders for a number
of years now, rearing together between fifteen and twenty young each
year in two broods. A third brood is always discouraged and prevented
if possible. Mr. Stijger at Halfweg, keeping a stock of fifteen regular
breeding pairs, reported a yellow colour mutation last year. I had
a cinnamon mutation, but this bird appeared to be very delicate and
died when about six weeks old. Incidentally, there are two of the same
colour mutations in Belgium.
I have just been informed that since the ist January, i960, the
entire export of native birds from Australia has been stopped, also of
those harmful parrot species not protected by law and of which
thousands are allowed to be shot or poisoned by farmers, even during
the breeding season. Far be it from me to question the strong reasons
for this prohibition, but it seems contradictory to protect these same
birds by an export ban. However, if this measure is permanent it
means a serious threat to aviculture as we cannot dispense with an
occasional fresh supply from the homeland of our parrots. To counter-
act this menace somewhat, in my opinion, the best thing to do is that
all cc psittaculturist's 35 unite in rural societies such as already exist in
Belgium and Germany. Once or twice a year members should forward
a list of all species in their possession with wants and exchanges. In

this way we would know exactly what we had and an overall organiza-
tion could take care of making the useful contacts, so that breeding
could be co-ordinated and the quality of our birds improved by
introducing unrelated blood into our stocks. This is very important,
especially with regard to those rare species of which there are only
a few birds present in the different countries on the Continent and in
Great Britain.

By C. Everitt (Titusville, New Jersey, U.S.A.)
Having recently taken over as curator of the above aviaries which
are located in New Jersey, most aptly called the Garden State of the
United States, I feel that a description of the establishment will be of
interest to all aviculturists. From the correspondence and trans-
Atlantic telephone conversations my wife and I had had with
Mr. Boehm we had prepared overselves for a varied collection of
birds ; but the picture we had built up falls far short of the actual.
The aviaries are sited on wooded, rising ground facing due west and
overlooking the Delaware River which flows serenely along about
150 yards below. At least it is flowing serenely at the present time,
although a few years back it completely overflowed its banks and the
force of the flood washed away the stone bridge which had been erected
at Washington's Crossing, about a half mile down from Mr. Boehm's
residence, in commemoration of the crossing effected about 180
years ago.
Due to the magnitude of the collection, it will not be possible to do
it justice in one paper ; and, therefore, I shall confine myself here to
a description of the bird-rooms and aviaries, some of the latter being
still in the course of construction. A plan of the layout of the establish-
ment can be seen on page 113 from which it may be observed that,
whilst the main objective has been to ensure compactness, no sacrifice
of space has been made to achieve it. The various bird-rooms and
aviaries are all numbered on the plan so as to assist in following the
descriptive details hereunder.
On entering the driveway one is faced by a long, low, white-
painted building which can be entered by either of one of two glass
panelled doors at the head of flights of seven stone steps. Behind these
doors are located the rooms numbered 1 to 13 on the plan referred
to above. They are all 11 feet deep, 8 feet high, and of varying widths,
as shown on the plan, with the exception of room number 7 which is

15 feet deep since it extends to the complete depth of the building.
The entire building is heated by a hot-water system, the temperature
being thermostatically controlled at 55 0 Fahrenheit. This installation
is operated by an oil-burning plant located in the rear portion of the
food preparation room which is between numbers 6 and 7 on the
plan. They are all illuminated by mechanically controlled lighting,
the lights coming on at 4.30 p.m. in the winter and remaining lit
until 7 p.m., with a dimming period of fifteen minutes prior to extinc-
tion. There are not separate perches as such in these indoor flights
as they are all fitted with two or more sawed-off tree trunks of about
6 inches in diameter into which holes are bored at various angles
and positions in order that trimmed tree branches can be fitted therein.
These can be changed whenever they are soiled, thus providing clean
and natural footholds for the birds. Care is always taken to ensure
that no branch is placed immediately below another so as to avoid
any unnecessary soiling of the birds 5 plumage by other inmates. Each
"\0x25A0 tree " is from 6 to 7 feet in height and is mounted on a cross-piece
base so that it can be readily moved about as required. However,
there are exceptions to the use of " trees 55 in these rooms and this
applies to those numbered 1 and 7. Both of these are planted and
landscaped to provide accommodation for particular species of birds.
Everything possible has been done to make these two compartments
complete aviaries in themselves, and they are planted with such
vegetation as a camellia tree, banana trees, Malayan fern tree, philo-
dendron, hibiscus, grape, and English ivy, begonias, firecracker
plant, etc. ; and in room number 7 there is constant running water
and a pool of varying depths planted with water lilies.
With the exception of the last-mentioned room which extends the
entire depth of the building and to which access may be obtained from
both portions of the frontal corridor, each has an entry from this
main passageway, the remainder of the retaining partition being
glazed half-way down so that a clear view of the birds can be obtained
at all times.
It will be noted from the plan that between rooms 1 and 2, and 10
and 11, there are spaces. The former houses twelve cages, six on each
side, of 44 inches long, 16 deep, and 18 high. Below these cages are
forty specially fitted drawers for the breeding of mealworms so as to
supplement the regular supply in the times of scarcity and during the
breeding season. Incidentally, I should like to mention here that the
mealworms received are imported from Germany, and this fact alone
shows the importance of endeavouring to be semi-independent ; for
in the time of adverse weather conditions, receipt of supplies is un-
avoidably delayed. In the second space, i.e. between rooms 10 and 11,
there are but six cages, each 44 inches by 18 by 24 ; but this area
also serves as the means of access to an outdoor aviary. Between

rooms 6 and 7 is the food preparation and boiler room referred to
earlier. This is equipped with a deep-freeze, refrigeration, electric
stove, mincing machine and mixer, and with a sink unit to which there
is a constant supply of hot and cold water. In addition, there is
storage space for the various fruits and other ingredients used in
feeding.
From the indoor rooms we now proceed to the outside aviaries
of which, excluding those in the Parrot House, there are eighteen.
Those numbered 14 to 21 are all separate aviaries planted with local
shrubs, creepers, and trees. Some are wired with |-inch by 2-inch
meshed wire, and others with i-inch by 2-inch wire. In addition,
aviary number 19 can be made into two of 20 feet by 8 feet each ;
otherwise they are all 10 feet high and of the varying dimensions as
indicated on the plan. Their primary purpose will be for breeding-
quarters of selected species of birds which can be left in open aviaries
the year around. The Parrot House is an erection of 50 feet by 20 feet
and consists of six flights of 23 feet long, 6 feet 8 inches wide, and
1 o feet high ; three of each such flights being on each side of a central
passageway which provides separate access to each flight. The building
is heated, controlled at 50*, and is intended for the housing of lories,
lorikeets, and other less hardy psittacine species which cannot be left
outside during the winter months when the temperature here fre-
quently drops to 13 0 below freezing during the night and does not rise
above 30* by day. Backing on to the Parrot House, that is the extreme
top left-hand corner of the plan, are four all-metal flights of 20 feet
long and 12 feet high. Two of them are 6 feet wide and the other two
4 feet. These are for breeding pairs of cockatoos and hardier large
parrots.
Now there remain only the six large planted aviaries of which three,
numbers 32, 35, and 36 are heated, controlled at 55*, so that they can
be used the year through for the housing of tropical and less hardy
species. The largest of these aviaries is number 37 and is some 68 feet
long, 42 feet wide, and, at the top of the arched roof, 26 feet high.
It is constructed of tubular steel covered with inch galvanized wire
netting. There is a large pool fed by a constant flow which cascades
into it over an artistically constructed waterfall. The edge of the
pool is planted with low shrubs and the rocks forming the fall are
covered with climbing plants and sheltered by overhanging conifers.
The outer surroundings are planted with rhododendrons, heather, and
azaleas with native trees interspersed. Next to this are two of the
heated aviaries referred to above. These are interconnected and of
34 feet long, 16 wide, and 10 feet high, and are planted with rhodo-
dendrons, forsythia, and fir trees. During the winter months, they are
completely covered with polythene screens which make them entirely
weatherproof.

The remaining three aviaries are all fitted with arched roofs, two of
them being 16 feet high, and the other 20 feet. That numbered 32
on the plan is roofed with plastic fibreglass from the height of 6 feet
from the ground. This lower portion is fitted with f inch by 2 inch
welded wire over which is fitted polythene panels during the winter.
It is planted with a varied collection of tropical and semi-tropical
plants and trees and, at the far end is located an artistic waterfall
which provides a constant flow into an ornamental basin below. The
other two are also planted but all with native trees, shrubs, and
plants ; for they are wired only and unheated. In number 34 there
are two pools, one at each end, which are connected with a constant
running stream. These aviaries, like the others mentioned earlier, are
used primarily for the housing of all the year around outdoor birds ;
although other species may be introduced to them during the warmer
weather only.
With all of these natural surroundings, it is hoped that there will
be some more successful breedings in the future. I say more for in
1959, Mr. Boehm had successful results with Scarlet-breasted Sunbirds
and Blue-winged Sivas. With regard to the former, whereas the sire
bird has lost his original deep colouring, the offspring, a male bird,
is just coming into colour and the breast feathers are coming through
of the same shade of red as with a freshly caught bird. This sets yet
another poser for the various theories that have been evolved regarding
the retaining of the red colouring matter in the feathers of certain
birds. I hope to be able to give further details of this Sunbird breeding
at a later date ; but I fear no data will be forthcoming regarding the
Blue-winged Sivas. This was a case of releasing a pair into an aviary
and the winter roundup disclosing that the family had increased.
Doubtless there will be similar unprewarned breedings in the future
for, with the ample supply of natural surroundings, many nests could
be completely concealed. Nevertheless, as much safe observation as
possible will be maintained, always ensuring that there is no undue
disturbance of the birds.
In a manner comparable with the housing of his birds, Mr. Boehm
believes in feeding them well. No rationing of mealworms is under-
taken beyond ensuring that the weekly supply does last the week.
As mentioned earlier, every effort is being made now to breed a supple-
mentary supply. The feeding of seedeaters follows a pattern similar
to that in practice in England except that with parrakeets, this term
including Budgerigars, there does not seem to be the same emphasis
paid to the feeding of additional proteins, as is the general custom in
the United Kingdom. However, every attention is given to the protein
factor in the feeding of softbills and nectar-taking birds. In addition
to a special soft food comprised of soya flour, fine biscuit meal, ground
fish and shrimp, dried flies and ant eggs, meat and liver meal, clofood,

grapes, apples, oranges, and cooked sweet potatoes. They are also
given raw minced beef hearts and a fruit mixture consisting of minced
carrot, apple, banana, orange, and fig, to which is added an equal
volume of lightly-boiled rice. The nectar fed is made up of corn
syrup, honey, Gerval protein, beef extract, Abdec, yolk of raw egg,
and skimmed milk. These constituents are all beaten up together and
a sufficient quantity of cold water is added to the mixture to make it
suitably dilute.
As I stated earlier, there is not sufficient space now to include
even skeleton details of the species of birds kept ; but I will endeavour
to make up for this omission at a later date. It will undoubtedly be
even a bigger task then than it is at the moment, for Mr. Boehm is
leaving shortly on a collector's trip and plans to visit Kenya, Ceylon,
India, and Australia, and may even take in the Far East if time
permits.

By A. W. S. Dean (Grantham, Lincolnshire, England)
(Continued from Vol. 64, No. 3, page 98)
In my previous article, I did not state that No. 1 goose came from
Mr. J. C. Laidley, also that No. 5 gander was from Colonel A. A.
Johnson. Also there was a mistake, on page 97--27 th October should
read " Gosling rather slimmer and appears longer on legs than adults ".
As a matter of fact the gosling is now a rather large gander and I
wonder if we can feed birds too well in captivity and as a result they
grow larger than in the wild state ; this needs watching.
igj 8 . February-March were very bad months, with long periods of
continuous day and night frosts and by April it did not seem as if
many birds would breed. The old Grey Lag goose died in February,
also two Silkie-cross hens that roosted in the trees in the orchard
died in March and June. I think these deaths were due to the weather
conditions early in the year. The ducks sat very late and had a great
many clear eggs and the summer weather was awful. During June ,
No. 4 Pink-footed Goose had been seen round the old nest and later
made a scrape some distance away by some bamboos, but never laid.
I feel that a possible reason may have been the pruning of some shrubs
not far from the old nest (although this was done in April), the
weather, or disturbance by vermin.
2jth August .--1957 gander heard squeaking--very low voice. It was
about seven yards away.

12th May. --1957 gander has much better voice.
18th May. --Silkie-cross hen laid first egg. She is the only hen
left and laid no eggs in 1958. This year she laid and went broody
three times. I mention this because I think it shows what effect
weather can have on birds.
22nd May. --No. 5 gander treading No. 4 goose. By now the geese
had divided up as follows--No. 5 and No. 4, No. 2 and No. 3, 1957
and No. 1. The last two can hardly be described as paired. The
old goose is not now quite so active and likes sitting in the sun, the
1957 gander goes off a good deal by himself, but comes to stand or sit
by her quite often. His voice is still not fully formed.
23rd May. --Nos. 5 and 4 sitting by bamboos where the 1958 scrape
was. I believe an egg was laid, if so, it was covered and I could not
see it. The gander saw off the Barnacle gander from the area.

never leaves her except to feed ; if he sees anyone near he returns to
her at once.

24th June. --7 a.m. gander making a lot of noise and running up
and down with two goslings. It would seem that he had gone to feed
at his usual feeding place and the goslings followed. On finding this
out he lost his head. I went to him and on seeing me he returned to
the nest and they followed. 8 a.m. gander feeding without goslings.
8.30 a.m. goose still on nest, no goslings visible, gander by her.
12 p.m. goose off nest some yards away but sitting down, there were
thought to be four goslings--one egg left in nest containing an un-
developed embryo, it measured 76&apos; 5 mm. X 53 mm. 2.15 p.m.
gander, goose, and four goslings on pond. 4.30 p.m. gander, goose and
goslings right at top of orchard in long grass, they did not come to feed.
Did they take the goslings up there to be out of the way as there were
at this time a brood of Barnacles and two broods of ducks besides
non-breeding birds ?

A. W. S. DEAN-BREEDING OF PINK-FOOTED GEESE I 1 9
25th June. --8.30 a.m. still up in long grass ; the gander led the brood
and seemed to look for ways for the brood to get through the long
grass, all movements very slow indeed. 11 a.m. on pond, one gosling
seems a little weak and hangs back from the others. Two of the goslings
were definitely bigger than the other two, I should think they hatched
first. 4 p.m. on pond again ; as far as I know, they never went back
to the nest. The goslings seem yellower than those of 1957, though it
may well be just a better light. The Barnacle gander was very noisy
while his mate was sitting, but quietened down as soon as she brought
off the brood. The Pink-footed gander was just the opposite.
26th June. --2 p.m. the goslings have not been seen at the food
troughs. I should mention that when the first ducklings hatched
I tried throwing meal on the water and at once found that this was no
use, so I put down some concrete open-ended troughs with J inch
water in them at one end and J inch of water at the other. The ducks
brought their youngsters to these straight away ; the same happened
with the geese and I must have fed them about five times a day.
The last feed was very late after all broods had gone to bed, so that
there was something there very early in the morning. I never had any
trouble with non-breeding birds touching the feed. 4.30 p.m. Pink-foot
and goslings came to food trough.
2jth June. --4.30 p.m. Pink-foot and goslings a long time at food
trough--it looked when examined as if they had fed--they also seem
to have been at the sand, I always put some in the troughs. The young
birds consume a good deal--goslings also eat lettuce on the pond.
28th June. --The goslings came to every feed ; they have now become
goose-shaped instead of egg-shaped and are rather more active.
29th June. --Goslings definitely eating meal. I saw them sitting
outside goose in the sun, in the afternoon they went for a walk along
a narrow bank with a 2-foot sheer drop on one side ; quite an
adventure at that age.

sex by behaviour on this occasion. They will need clipping again,
as when you clip you must not clip down to the blood in the
feathers or these will come out and grow again. By the way,
I have found out that with both wild-caught and home-reared
birds, if you are late in clipping and they fly out, the first time they
will walk back to the fence and can be picked up. If you flush them
and they fly in you never get a second chance, this applies to geese and
ducks.
13th August. --Moved food troughs out of water on to land, as they
were getting very messy. Food consumption now going down, all
young birds have now got flight feathers, this is probably the reason.

banded. You should be able to clip up to 4 inches for first time and
second time 3 inches. I clip seven feathers. The feathers were by now
completely free of blood. We had hoped to get a good indication of
sex this time by behaviour on catching and caught the two smallest first
(they were the last two to hatch) and I would say by behaviour they
were definitely geese. I then caught the bird that looked most like a
gander. It very much was one, hissed, bit, and struggled to get away,
very strong. The last one gave no indication either way and I am by
no means certain what it is. A guess would be a gander, but I may well
be wrong. On banding we found the first two had thin legs, the next
much larger, and the third intermediate legs. We put the birds back
in the catching pen after handling and let them all loose together.
6th October. --Immature Pintail drake arrived about now and stopped
till 20th November. It was very tame, it had no leg band.
28th November .--Had a good look at the Pink-footed brood. There
may well be only one gander. They look very like the old birds in
colour, but are more smoke-grey and possibly not quite so large. White
flank bands showing well, but not quite fully developed.
Having now reared Pink-footed geese in an enclosed pen and
in the open, I can say that it is very much easier to make notes on
goslings when they are kept in small pens, but you get no idea of the
parents' behaviour unless they have more room. I am keeping this
year's goslings with the others in the orchard in order to see what

his success in breeding second-generation Meyer's Parrots. About
six years ago a pair nested : first nest, three eggs, three hatched,
one reared ; second nest, four eggs, two young reared. Soon after
both parents died.
All three young ones flourished and in 1959 a pair nested : first nest,
three eggs, two hatched and reared ; second nest, four eggs, three
hatched, two reared.

News items being a little scarce, now seems a good opportunity to
recount what must be the most astonishing breeding experiment ever
made.
In 1903 Gilbert Lee decided to attempt to breed Grey Parrots.
He gives an account of the extraordinary albeit successful event in
Aviculture , 1930, 255. He writes : " I purchased seventeen and
placed them in a loft in a friend's cow barn in Jersey [U.S.A.]. Three
years later sixty-seven birds had been added to the original number
placed in this loft and eleven skeletons were found. The birds never
saw a human being after being placed in their loft, consequently no
pictures were taken. The experiment was really quite novel and one
that I do not think should be printed at this time because of the lack
of detail that bird lovers will want to know about.
The entire loft was lined with f-inch wire netting to keep out the
rats and to allow climbing around. There was a continuous water
supply regulated so that two or three porcelain dishes were kept filled,
and the attendant saw to it that there was a slight overflow from these
raised dishes to keep the four or five inches of sawdust that was
scattered over the floor damp and cause some rotting.
The nests were hung from the ceiling on hay wire wrapped around
small branches ; some were barrels cut in half, partially filled with
peat moss and sawdust ; others were rotten logs hung vertically, and
some horizontally. Soap boxes were also nailed to the wall, all the
same ' pigeon style '. All of the entrances to the nests, and in fact a
great many of the nests, were covered with Florida moss, hay, etc.,
in order to give the birds more seclusion. Ordinary chicken hoppers
were used which had a connection from the outside to put in hemp,
sunflower, millet, canary, and clover grass seed. The sawdust on the
floor being damp, much of the wasted seed sprouted and was readily
eaten by both the old and young.
In one end of the loft was a half-inch hardware square netting basket
and under it a box of bran. Occasionally a calf's head was thrown
in and while I never saw the parrots eat any of the fresh or decayed
meat, nevertheless they relished the maggots which dropped from the
basket.
This loft being in a dairy barn made it very convenient for the
attendant occasionally to slip in by way of the trap door pans of
sour milk or cottage cheese. I put in a chute, the entrance of which

was on the outside, which went down to the center of the room.
Mixed feed was thrown daily down this chute. The reason for this
was twofold.
First, because, so many birds, as you know, will not clear away the
shells at the hoppers ; and second, to give the birds some exercise
when hungry."
One can well imagine that this account was received with a deal of
scepticism. Possibly the better to substantiate his claim, Lee com-
menced further breeding operations in Los Angeles, in 1930, but on
more orthodox lines. The first young one was hatched in August,
1933, but lived only three weeks. In November, three were hatched
and one was fully reared. This was to prove the forerunner of very
many to be reared down the years.
Gilbert Lee died in 1941, but Mrs. Gilbert Lee continued to breed
them and, I believe, still does. By now the fifth or sixth generation
must have been reached.

During the months of March and April a number of particularly
interesting birds have been received. Those new to the Collection are
a Rufous Fishing Owl ( Scotopelia ussheri) presented by Mr. J. I. Menzies
who collected it in Sierra Leone, two Inca Terns ( Larosterna inca ), and
a Heine's Humming Bird (Amazilia tzacatl jucunda) received in exchange,
and a Mrs. Wilson's Tanager ( Calospiza nigrocincta franciscae) presented
by Messrs. G. H. and J. R. Newmark.
The Fishing Owl is a great rarity, the few known specimens being
found in Ghana, Sierra Leone, and in Liberia. The irides are described
as being yellow, but those of our juvenile bird are of a dark umber
brown.
The Inca Tern is a bird of the coastal areas of Peru and Chile. It is
of a grey general colouring with a bright red bill and has on either
side of the face curious, white curled moustache-like feathers.
Heine's Humming Bird is a race inhabiting western Ecuador and
south-western Colombia. It is of a general iridescent green with
a reddish-brown tail. Mrs. Wilson's Tanager is well known and has
been depicted in the Magazine (1940, p. 243), though the colour of
the neck is not accurately reproduced, being much too yellow.

Other presentations include a female Horned Screamer (. Anhima
cornuta) from Mr. Tom Spence, a Moorish Magpie ( Pica pica mauri-
tanica) collected in Morocco by Messrs. G. H. and J. R. Newmark
and apparently the only specimen to be received since the arrival of
the first in 1870. A Bengal Pitta and a pair of Madagascar Weavers
were also donated by them, and a Greater Patagonian Conure by
Mr. E. Ayling.
Two Violet Plantain-eaters and two Senegal Touracos ( Turacus persa
buffoni) have been purchased and a Hahn's Macaw received in
exchange.
A female Kea which was, I believe, brought from New Zealand by
the late Sydney Porter in 1938 and is the mother of the bird bred in
his aviaries in 1946 (. Avicultural Magazine , 1947, pp. 50-55), has been
deposited by Mr. P. H. Maxwell. It was put with a male that was
received here in 1952 and three eggs, which we think should be fertile,
have been laid, but incubation (at least during the day) is being done
entirely by the hen, not by both sexes as stated by Mr. Porter.
Three Spotted Eagle-Owls and two or three Great Eagle-Owls
have been hatched and two Cormorants have left the nest. Two
Spotted Eagle-Owls bred here last year and sent to Mr. G. af
Enehjelm in Finland have, he tells me, produced young, breeding at
about ten months of age, whereas, he says, the Great Eagle-Owl does
not breed until the third year.
Abyssinian Eagle-Owls, Spectacled Owls, Great Grey Tinamous,
and Gannets have eggs.
The interior of the Tropical House is being improved and flying
space much enlarged by the removal of the corridor. Visitors will be
able to walk through among the birds, entering by a darkened porch
at one end and going out through a similar darkened porch at the
other.
Humming Birds, Sugar Birds, small Tanagers, and perhaps Sunbirds
will be kept there and it is hoped to publish photographs later.

THE CEYLON SPURFOWL

By G. M. Henry (Constantine, Falmouth, Cornwall, England)
The Spurfowls comprise only three species, of which two inhabit
the Indian Peninsula and one is confined to Ceylon. They are all
roughly of partridge size, show marked differences between the sexes,
and are remarkable for the armature of the tarsi, in both males and
females, with sharp spurs. The development of these spurs is subject to
considerable variation ; usually, males have two on each tarsus,
females one ; but some males have up to three or four on one tarsus
and fewer on the other, while females may have two on each
tarsus or only one in all.
Most accounts of these birds seem rather to stress their partridge-
like appearance, especially in regard to the carriage of the tail.
However, from much observation of the Ceylonese species in captivity,
I feel convinced that their real affinities are rather Phasianine than
Perdicine. The tail is often rather strongly laterally compressed, though
not so markedly tectiform as in Gallus ; while their whole bearing and
behaviour in life strongly suggest a small fowl rather than a partridge.
Unfortunately, I have not been able to observe the order of moulting
of the tail feathers--upon which, according to Beebe, their relegation
to one subfamily or the other must depend.
They are all shy, skulking, forest birds, ground dwellers but roosting
in trees. The Ceylon Spurfowl is the most secretive of birds, and though
relatively common within its chosen haunts, it is with the possible
exception of some of the rails, the most difficult to observe in Nature of
any of the Island's birds ; such contacts as are made with it being
generally confined to a brief glimpse as it dashes into cover when
suddenly come upon on some jungle path. It is found in many parts
of the southern half of the Island, but its main habitat is in the damp,
lush forests of the wet zone, i.e. the sector lying to the south and west

G. M. HENRY-THE CEYLON SPURFOWL
of the central mountain massif, which receives the heavy rainfall
associated with the south-west monsoon. These dripping, leech-
infested rain-forests, with their heavy undergrowth of dwarf bamboo,
etc., afford the bird optimum conditions, but it also ascends the
mountains to 5,000 feet or more.
Although it is so seldom seen, its distribution is easily ascertained by
the highly characteristic song of the male, which is freely indulged in
several times a day, but especially in the fore-noon, during the breeding
season. It may be described as a musical, whistling cackle, consisting
of three-syllabled notes, each pitched a step higher in scale until the
last, which suddenly drops to the starting point : yuhuhu yuhuhu
yuhuhu yuhuhu yuhuhu yuhuheeyo ; the final yuhuhleyo may be repeated
several times in an excited manner. This song is very ventriloquial in
character and when one bird starts singing others will join in, answering
each other from different directions, so that for a few minutes and
several times in a morning, the welkin rings with music.
Although it can fly quite well, with a rapid, fluttering action, it is
very reluctant to trust to its wings for safety and only does so when
cornered, or put up by a carnivore ; then it will sometimes fly into a
tree, but ordinarily, with dense undergrowth always at hand, it will
run into it and rapidly vanish. Normally, flight is employed only for
ascending to its roosting perch at nightfall. The ordinary gait is a
high-stepping strut.
The Spurfowl feeds upon a mixed diet of seeds, wild berries, and a
high proportion of animal food--insects, worms, and the like--such as
abounds in the mulch of dead leaves among which it scratches
energetically. Termites provide a great source of nourishment,
especially for the chicks.
Being such a very timid bird, the Spurfowl was long regarded as
impossible to keep for any length of time in captivity ; and such
individuals as were trapped by Sinhalese villagers and sold to local
aviculturists invariably scalped themselves on the roof of their aviary
in very quick time ; and even if they managed to exist for a few months
with naked and bleeding skulls, they were hardly desirable pets.
In fact, however, this little game-bird is both easy to keep and to breed
in a suitable aviary and it makes a most interesting exhibit. The cock,
with his beautifully black-and-white spangled fore-parts and rich
chestnut hind-quarters is most attractive, while his brown mate is
a neat and comely little person. The great secrets of success with them
are--abundant natural cover, a deep litter of dead leaves and the like,
and no entering of their aviary by humans for any reason whatever.
Until these simple principles were put into practice at the small zoo
that we maintained at the Colombo Museum, Spurfowl were a failure,
but thereafter several pairs were kept in perfect health and condition
for many years ; they bred freely, sang their songs, and throve

exceedingly. With the back two-thirds of their aviaries planted with a
veritable jungle of " guinea grass " (a tall, tussocky, broad-bladed
grass), lantana, and other shrubs and creepers, in which they could
hide to their hearts' content, they quickly settled down and before
long lost their shyness in the presence of humans, and gave perfect
opportunities for watching their behaviour in every detail. Until this
desirable state of emotional equilibrium has become established, it
would, of course, be necessary to prevent newly caught birds from
scalping themselves against wire-netting, either by clipping a wing
or by providing a ceiling of soft fabric a foot (say) below the roof
wire. Another very desirable feature in an aviary for any game-birds
is a broad skirting-board all round the base of the wire-netting, of
sufficient height to prevent the birds from seeing over when they are
on the ground ; this discourages the habit of parading perpetually up
and down beside the wire, trying to get out--a habit ruinous to health
and beauty. A game-bird's aviary ought to be its satisfying little
domain.
From observation of captive birds, I feel convinced that the Spurfowl
is monogamous, pairing for life. A pair are utterly intolerant of any
other of their own kind in the same aviary, and they will kill even their
own offspring as soon as these begin to develop adult plumage. A pair
were kept in a big aviary with a family of Junglefowl, but the Spur-cock
so tyrannized over the Jungle-hens that he and his mate had to be
removed to other quarters. (He never tried conclusions with the
Jungle-cock--probably because the latter's gorgeous colouring obviated
any feelings of rivalry with his own kind which he might have felt with
the hens.)
The Spur-cock is very prettily attentive to his little hen, he will take
her small tit-bits, proffering them with quaint wheedlings wh wh whee
we we , etc., which she answers with whimpers suggestive of a very
young puppy. On meeting, the pair will slightly expand their tails
laterally, but I never witnessed any definite courtship display.
The nest is a mere scrape on the ground in the shelter of a big
boulder, fallen trunk, etc., in dense undergrowth. Two to five eggs are
laid ; they are perfect miniatures of those of the domestic hen and
measure about 43 X 31 mm. The chick is a beautiful little creature
clothed in rather uniform, dark-brown down. It develops very rapidly.
Though exceedingly difficult to shoot, the Spurfowl is easily trapped,
as it has strong territorial instincts and a pair will frequent a small area
for a considerable time. As its beloved jungles become ever more and
more restricted in area it is bound to become extinct in much of its
range ; already its habitat is greatly reduced since Legge's time
(roughly, the 70s of last century), and although the species does not
appear to be in immediate danger, it is impossible not to feel pessimistic
regarding its future status.

By David West (Montebello, California, U.S.A.)
In January of 1959, it was decided to keep an accurate account of
the deaths which might transpire during the balance of the year. This
could be done quite easily as on 1st January, 1959, there were an even
100 larger psittacine birds in my collection ; thus giving a base figure
of 100 to use for calculating percentages. The birds ranged in size
from Madagascar Lovebirds to Dwarf Macaws, and almost without
exception were birds that had been in the collection for some months
prior to January, 1959. Mention should be made that all the birds
were housed outside and under very adequate conditions regarding
size of aviary, number of inhabitants in each aviary, and care and
feeding of same.
From previous experience it was known that the two periods of
greatest potential danger would be the early spring months and the
late fall months. Contrary to what might be expected, periods of
intense cold rarely cause any deaths, while spring months with widely
fluctuating temperatures are always the most dangerous for birds.
Of the twelve months under review, there were deaths in four months,
viz. March (5), October (1), November (2), and December (1).
Examined more closely here are the results and also some guesses as
to the probable causes of death.
March had five deaths, marking it as the most dangerous month of
the year. A female Bourke was killed by a female Barraband when the
Bourke apparently entered the Barraband's prospective nest. Later the
Barraband became paralysed and died of paralysis. A female
Alexandrine died egg-bound on the nest. It is very rare indeed for a
female to stay on the nest while in this condition ; invariably they
leave the nest and are easily detected. A yellow Red-rumped female,
never a particularly promising-looking breeding specimen, also died--
apparently enteritis. Lastly, a very valuable and exceedingly rare bird
to die from pneumonia was a female Red-bellied Dwarf Macaw. This
bird looked fluffed about noon and by evening had died. She was a
bird of great charm--and it is quite doubtful if there is another of her
species in the entire U.S.A.
From April to October there were no deaths. During October a
female Bourke died--" gone light." In November a hybrid male
Brown's and Yellow Rosella died from a broken neck. Also during
November a female Layard's Parrakeet died from a kidney infection.
In December a rather aged and imperfectly feathered female lutino
Ring-necked died quite suddenly--cause unknown.
Thus during the course of one year nine birds (eight females and

one male) died. This gives a mortality figure of 9 per cent (9/100).
The interpretation of the figure can only have some meaning and
importance if it could be compared with figures from other collections
of birds of like type, size, and locale. If the figure were changed
(that is, the base figure of 100 raised to 145 which was the number of
birds in the collection on 31st December, 1959), the adjusted mortality
percentage would be 9/145 or approximately 6^ per cent.
The writer is familiar with only one other published article on
mortality figures. The Marquess of Tavistock's " Facts and Figures 55
in the March, 1938, number of the Magazine. The author mentions
that in his collection of 266 birds, there were twenty-seven deaths ;
which would give a mortality figure of approximately 10 per cent.
In summation it would be the writer's opinion that the average
mortality figure one might expect in a psittacine collection in California
would range from a low of 5 per cent to a high of 10 per cent. Of course
as more than one wag has pointed out, there are two kinds of liars,
i.e. damn liars and statisticians. We can certainly twist figures about--
especially if working with a small base figure.
A good example of how mortality figures would look when judged
from a very small base figure would be an instance where a friend of
the writer's had six Rosellas at the start of the year and ended up with
only five. This single death represented a i6S per cent mortality
figure--higher by far than mine.
It would be very interesting to hear from other members regarding
their experience with life and death in the aviary, although admittedly
we enjoy reading about breeding successes more than the reverse.
i960
From 1st January, i960, to 1st April, two birds died from a total of
no. A female Turquoisine died in January and a female Indian
Ring-necked died in March--the latter possibly damaged internally
during copulation with an Alexandrine. 2/110 = 1-8 per cent
mortality figure.

By Wolfgang Grummt (Curator of Birds, Berlin Zoo,
Berlin-Friedrichsfelde, Germany)
In April and May, 1959, I had the opportunity, during a stay in
Peking, to make a thorough inspection of the Peking Zoo. This old
zoo has now been greatly extended and covers an area of 70 ha.
Although there is no large bird-house, such as are found in our
European Zoos, nevertheless the Peking Zoo has a considerable bird
collection with many valuable specimens which are only rarely seen
in our Zoos. Several large ponds are occupied by water birds of many
species, but I will only mention a few of the more striking. Mandarin
Ducks flew about in a half-wild state and Falcated Teal and one or two
Baer's Pochards were interesting inhabitants of a small pond. Whooper,
Mute, and Black Swans were swimming about on all the ponds, as
well as large numbers of Red-breasted Geese, Swan Geese, Bar-headed
Geese, and Bean Geese ; among the last named were a good number
of the thick-billed Bean Goose (. Anser fabalis serrirostris) , from east
Siberia, which has a strikingly heavy bill. On an island were Great
White Herons ( Egretta alba modesta ), Javan Adjutant ( Leptoptilos
javanicus ), and some Chinese White Storks ( Ciconia ciconia boyciana ),
which are considerably larger than the common White Stork and have
a heavy black beak. In addition to Crowned Cranes ( Balearica
pavonina) and Lilford Cranes (Grus grus lilfordi ), there were also two
beautiful White-necked Cranes ( Grus vipio ) and about ten hand-tame
Manchurian Cranes (Grus japonensis) . In the outside part of the Zoo
where the quarantine station is situated, there were also many
ornithological gems. I saw fifteen more Manchurian Cranes, which
had all been caught as half-grown chicks and reared in captivity.
Particularly noteworthy is a large communal aviary for pheasants
with, as secondary occupants, a large number of passerine birds.
The aviary occupies a ground space of about 17 m. X 13 m. with a
height of 15 m. Whereas in our zoos and pheasantries most pheasants
have already been bred for many generations in captivity and it is
often not known for certain whether they are of pure blood (perhaps
Lady Amherst's, Blue Eared and Brown Eared Pheasants are excep-
tions), the Peking Zoo has only wild-caught birds and also the exact
place of capture is known. All the pheasants are caught by the Zoo's
bird-catchers.
Among the interesting inhabitants of this aviary was one cock
Chinese Monal ( Lophophorus Ihuysi) , which had been there for over a
year and was in excellent condition. This must be the only example of
this species in captivity. The outstanding characteristic of this highly-
coloured pheasant, which is found in the mountains of Szetschuan,

is the metallic shining green tail. The other feathers are very similar
to those of the Himalayan Monal ( Lophophorus impeyanus). But from
what the keeper told me this bird is difficult to acclimatize,
particularly with regard to feeding. The Chinese Monal only appeared
in the early morning and again in the late afternoon. During the hot
midday hours it sat completely hidden in the thick clumps of branches
about 8-9 metres high. Also in this aviary were three Tibetan White
Eared Pheasants ( Crossoptilon crossoptilon drouyni ), with pure white
feathers, black head, and dark tail ; one and 3 $ Golden Pheasants ;
one and 3 $ Lady Amherst's Pheasants ; one &lt;$ and 2 $ Reeves'
Pheasants, the cock with a particularly long tail ; one &lt;$ and one 5
Temminck's Tragopans ( Tragopan temmincki) ; six Chinese Ring-
necked Pheasants ( Phasianus colchicus torquatus). The Lady Amherst's
cock, which was also wild-caught, clearly shows that we have practi-
cally no pure bred specimen of this species in our aviaries. Contrary
to most captive birds, it has no red feathers on the underside. The tail
is strikingly long and, moreover, the individual feathers are very broad.
About fifteen Bamboo Partridges ( Bambusicola thoracica ), which were
constantly calling, were also in the large aviary. In addition, there
was also a splendid male Great Bustard ( Otis tarda dybowski ), and
five Pallas's Sandgrouse ( Syrrhaptes paradoxus) which sat immovable
in the same place on the sand almost the whole day. They were only
lively in the morning when they ran about and ate.
At least eighty Red-billed Leiothrix ( Leicthrix lutea) , mostly males,
perched in all the bushes and sang continuously. Some Mongolian
Skylarks ( Melanocorypha mongolica) and some Pine Buntings (Emberiza
leucocephala) were also present.
It is astonishing that the large numbers of birds in this aviary get
on with each other. During the breeding season, however, a few pairs
are taken from the main aviary and put in breeding aviaries to which
the zoo visitors do not have access.
In one aviary of about 60 m. 2 there were six wild-caught Blue
Eared Pheasants. Blue, Black-winged, and White Peafowl were housed
in aviaries and twenty Green Peafowl walked about at liberty.
The collection of parrots which was displayed in a series of aviaries
was very extensive. I will only mention the most interesting

By Gust. A. Gjessing (Drammen, Norway)
For several years, I had asked our Veterinarian Authorities to
permit me to import some birds from Australia, but I never received
a permit, until 1956, when I became personally acquainted with an
official high up in the Department of Agriculture, under which the
Veterinarian Authorities work. I explained my wishes to him, he
visited my establishment and took the matter up with the right party,
with the result that I was given a permit to import one shipment
during the year 1957.
Then I had to find a suitable contact in Australia, and that was not
easy. I wrote to many members of the Avicultural Society, but got
no answer that was of much help. Then, Mr. Baty of Newcastle, one of
our fellow members, whom I met personally when my wife and I
visited England, told me about a visit he had had from Dr. Alan
Lendon, from Adelaide, and I wrote him. Dr. Lendon was kind
enough to give me an address in Adelaide, a regular exporting firm
named Avitraders Ltd ., so I wrote them and they sent me a price list.
One of my friends here in Norway (the only person besides myself
who keeps the larger Australian species), and I sent an order for seme
forty pairs of bhub--a selection of the rarer and more desirable species.
We were informed that the money must be paid in advance, which we
did. A ship was found, whose captain was willing to carry the cargo,
and I paid some extra money to have good sized cages used for trans-
port. I also instructed the Australian shipper to promise the person
who was to tend the birds at sea a special bonus if the birds arrived
here in fair shape.
I might mention here that it was forbidden to send birds by air
from Adelaide to Europe ; they had to come by sea. We were very
anxious, of course, that the birds should be at most eight weeks at
sea before arrival. The ship was a Norwegian vessel belonging to the
Wilhelmsen Line in Oslo and the stewardess tended the birds under

instructions from the shippers. After five weeks at sea, the ship reached
Genoa (Italy), the sailing schedule was changed, and I was notified
the ship would not go any further than Antwerp, and would not
come to Oslo at all.
We got very worried, what now . . . ? But after another two weeks,
we got another wire, telling us that the birds would be unloaded in
Antwerp, and sent on by another boat to Norway.
And so, on the 26th July, 1957, the very first shipment of birds from
Australia came to Norway.
Some birds died on the way--some seventy birds were sent, and
the total loss was five birds, which was much better than expected.
But our very greatest disappointment was in the birds themselves,
I mean the species which were sent. We had ordered our own choice,
but we received birds we had not ordered. Port Lincolns, Rock
Peplars, Barnard's, Golden-mantled Rosellas were present in abund-
ance. No Princesses, no Splendids, no Turquoisines, etc., but I got
a pair of Brown's, which I appreciated, although not ordered either.
Let me say to the honour of Avitraders Ltd., the birds were all young
fine healthy stock, and although we found the way of doing business
somewhat different from our own practice, we had to say to ourselves :
" Well--you did not get what you wanted, but --you got fresh birds.
That was worth something."
We put the birds into quarantine-aviaries, and watched them.
They were perfectly good, all of them. Especially my pair of Brown's
and one pair of Barraband's--a very large pair, possibly half as big
again as the ones one usually sees. This pair, incidentally, gave me
four fine young in the 1958 season.
We were at first really angry with our Australian shippers for
having taken it upon themselves to select what we were to have--but
after a while we realized that this might have been done in order
to send the strongest and best birds on such a long journey.
We selected those which we wished to keep, and the rest were then
sold to Denmark, Switzerland, and Ireland.
The birds all thrived and those we kept are still in good health.
They were packed in tea-chests with a cage front, one pair to each
tea-chest. Upon arrival they were clean and the water was fresh--
the stewardess on the ship had done a good job, and was rewarded
with a cheque for #5 from each of us. I asked for another permit for
1958, and got it.
We--Mr. Foss and I---again ordered a shipment of the rarer
species, this time a total of twenty pairs. This time all the birds ordered
were available and sent. But on this occasion we were not so lucky,
as about 40 per cent of the birds were dead upon arrival or died
shortly after. Of two pairs of Splendids, only the females survived, in
three pairs of Kings, one died, five birds were delivered. Of four pairs

of Pennant's, 2- |pairs arrived alive, the rest were dead, and so on.
But the birds that stood the trip were also very fine specimens.
They were packed in the same manner as the previous shipment,
but this time it was two sailors who tended them. They were sent
from Australia in February and arrived in London just at Easter, and
the boys aboard the ship hauled all the crates out to let the " poor birds
get some sunshine ". They were not aware of the fact that such
birds don't stand much direct sunshine, and let the birds stand in the
direct sun for three days, as the ship stayed in the port of London
that long. Imagine--inside a tea-chest in the direct sun, no wonder
we lost 40 per cent of them, I am surprised that any of them lived to
arrive in Norway. But they did, and those that arrived and managed
to live over the first week, are still alive to-day, looking very fine and
healthy.
All the birds were young birds of the year. In this way I was able
to replace practically all my birds, I sold the old pairs and installed
new ones. To summarize I will say, that if one is lucky enough to be
able to give direct, or indirect by letter, instructions on the care of
the birds while they are being transported, and one can be sure that
the travelling cage is at least one tea-chest per pair--one stands a good
chance of getting most birds safely, even after six to eight weeks'
sea-travel.
After my experiences, I must say, that I find the reports I have had
so far from importers in England, too pessimistic. That we had as
much as 40 per cent loss on the second import was surely only because
the birds had been left in the sun. They had had sunstroke, of course.
But--I guess these will be my first and last attempts. I do not think
the new situation is likely to be changed, while I am able to import
birds.
It is now up to all of us to try to keep our stock alive, to help out
with exchanging stock between us, and to give all the advice possible to
those seeking help and advice, so that everybody can have a fair
chance at breeding.

By Kenton C. Lint (Curator of Birds, Zoological Society of San Diego,
California)
On the morning of 27th May, i960, two Magpie-Larks were hatched
in our aviary at the San Diego Zoo. I believe this is the first time this
bird has been successfully bred in the Western Hemisphere. The events
leading up to the hatching started while I was on a collecting expedition
to Australia in 1957.
The Magpie-Lark is one of Australia's most widely known birds.
It prefers to live near water, whether creek, river, swamp, lake, or
lagoon, but is happy enough in green, moist places. As an insectivorous
bird, and because it eats pond snails, an intermediate host of the liver
fluke, it is fully protected.
Like other familiar birds the Grallina has many popular names,
such as " mud-lark," " Murray magpie," " peewit," " peewee," and
" pugwall." It makes a " pudding-basin " nest of mud, the natural
cement being reinforced with grass stems, feathers, and hair.
When I saw these attractive black and white birds walking around
on the green lawns of Taronga Park in Sydney, I decided at once to
import a pair into the United States.
With the necessary importation permit and the co-operation of
Sir Edward Hallstrom, President of the Taronga Zoological Park,
I included a pair of these birds in my shipment arriving aboard the
S.S. Sierra on the 9th February, 1958. Both birds were young and they
were placed on exhibit in an aviary shared with a pair of Tawny-
shouldered Frogmouths, Podargus strigoides , also imported on this
shipment.
In 1959 a little " domestic tension " arose between this pair of birds
and it became necessary to separate the two to prevent further fighting.
The hen Mud-lark was nursed back to good health with abundant
insectile food and good care.
This year I decided to try to breed this pair of birds. They were
removed to an inside aviary where they could be closely watched, and
an artificial nest was installed for their nesting cycle. Nest building
material of mud and grass was placed in the aviary.
On the nth April, I observed the male bird carrying dried grass
around the aviary. This was encouraging and raised hopes for a
successful breeding season. On the 15th April, the hen was observed
sitting on the nest on two eggs. On the 28th April, I passed the aviary
and heard faint squeaking, similar to the sound of baby mice, coming
from the nest. The next morning both babies were found on the

ground, thrown from the nest during the night. This was discouraging,
but perseverance in breeding birds is essential so there was nothing
to do but start all over again. With abundant insectile food this pair
of Mud-larks again started breeding. On the 13th May, two eggs
were again observed in the nest with the hen sitting.
Mud-larks are very shy sitters and whenever the cock saw someone
approaching the aviary he uttered his very shrill whistle and out
came the hen at once. As far as I could see the hen did most of the
incubating, the cock guarding the nest when she left to gather food.
The eggs are very pretty, sand coloured with a pink tinge, and dark
spots and blotches at the large end.
On the 27 th May, in the morning, I again heard the familiar sounds
of newly hatched nestlings, probably hatched during the night. An
incubation period of thirteen days was recorded for this species. Two
babies had hatched.
Because the nestlings of Mud-larks are fed only insectile food, great
quantities of insects must be supplied daily. Three bird keepers were
instructed to feed insects on a daily schedule of 8 a.m., 10 a.m.,
12 noon, 2 p.m., and 4 p.m. to the parent birds. Early morning and
evening feedings were supplied to the nestlings by the author in order
to ensure their proper growth.
The young birds were reared entirely on live food--mealworms,
Tenebrio molitor , earthworms, larvae of the Larder Beetle, Dermestes
lardarius, cockroaches, and baby snails. The parent birds also fed flies
and insects they caught in the aviary.
Needless to say, we are delighted to have succeeded in rearing this
delightful bird in our aviary.
In a search of the literature we find only one breeder outside of
Australia to record a success of this species--by the late Alfred Ezra,

It had been my original intention that, as a follow up to the details
of the lay-out of the Edward Marshall Boehm aviaries, I would describe
the inmates room by room and aviary by aviary in the order of the plan
as shown on page 113 of the May-Jrme issue of this Magazine. However,
as further bird rooms and flights have been added since that was
produced and even more are planned, I have decided to deal with the
collection species by species. Even this will undoubtedly be out of date
by the time it gets into print for new arrivals are coming in regularly.
I fully realize that many of the specimens will be familiar to many
readers but, nevertheless, my notes may serve as a useful reference by
virtue of the fact that the birds will be grouped by species irrespective
of their normal habitat.
This first paper will deal exclusively with those species of the
Nectariniidae, the family of sunbirds that are kept here at the present
time. This last point is important for, although it includes members of
the genera Anthreptes , Chalcomitra, Cinnyris, Cyanomitra, Drepanorhynchus,
and JVectarinia, it covers but a minute fraction of the complete family
of sunbirds which are confined to the Old World with the humming
bird as their counterpart in the New World. There are some points of
similarity between the two families but, whereas sunbirds sometimes
feed on the wing but normally alight on the blooms that attract
them, humming birds as a general rule adopt the reverse procedure.
In nearly all cases pairs of all the species dealt with hereunder are
kept in the covered aviary shown as No. 32 on the plan mentioned
above together with a number of sugarbirds, honeyeaters, flycatchers,
and a few seedeaters which will be dealt with at a later date.
Incidentally, this covered aviary has been landscaped in the pattern of
a formal Indian garden.

Ruby-cheeked (A. singalensis).
Although this Malayan species is sometimes classified in the genus
Chalcomitra , its short, straight bill is a distinct characteristic of the
genus Anthreptes. It is a small bird, only 4 inches in length, and is
seldom found above 3,000 feet and descends to the lowlands as the
cooler weather sets in. The sexes differ, the adult male being a dark
metallic green above. This colouring is only distinguishable in the
sunlight and otherwise it appears to be black, the colour of the flight
and central tail feathers actually are. The cheek patches and ear-
coverts are a metallic coppery-red with the chin, throat, and breast a
rufous buff. The remainder of the underparts are olive-yellow, with

legs and feet of greenish-grey. The female is olive-green above and
lacks the coloured cheeks and ear-coverts. The chin, throat and breast
are a pastel rusty-buff and the rest of the underparts a greenish-yellow.
Like other members of Anthreptes it is very insectivorous and readily takes
to small mealworms.
Violet-backed (A. longuemarei orientalis).
So far as I can ascertain, there are six different sub-species of this
African sunbird, but the one at the Boehm aviaries is from Kenya.
They are not often kept in captivity for they are rather difficult to
" meat off " owing to their need for suitable live food. Nectar by itself
does not appear to be sufficient. In appearance they have the body
shape and straight bill usually associated with sugarbirds rather than
that of the normal sunbird. There is no non-breeding dress and the
adult male is metallic-violet above which colouring extends right down
to the tail. The flights and face are black, wing-butts of metallic violet
and the pectoral tufts are yellow. The throat is a similar shade of
violet but the remainder of the underparts are white. The female is
sooty-grey above with a violet suffusion and has a distinct white
eye-stripe. The wing-butts vary, some being plain and others violet,
but invariably the tail is metallic-violet resembling the male's. The
chin and breast are white with yellowish flanks and belly. This is a
medium sized bird, being about 5 inches in length.

Amethyst or Black (C. amethystind ).
A fairly large sunbird, about 6 inches in length, which is to be found
in three African regions, but there are slight differences in the colouring
and make-up with each sub-species. They all have square tails and
there is no non-breeding dress. The adult male from Portuguese East
Africa--C. a. kirkii --is mostly of a velvety purplish-black with fore-
head to crown of metallic-green with a golden sheen. The chin and
throat are reddish-purple and the wings and tail are purplish-black
tinged with bronze. The shoulder-butts are metallic-violet and
occasionally a bird is found which shows yellow pectoral tufts, but
normally these are absent. The female is ashy-green above with
blackish flight-feathers which have a gloss of bronze. The tail is black
with the same bronze tinge and all the feathers are white tipped. The
underparts are an olive-yellow with dusky-brown streaks throughout.
The Somaliland to Tanganyika sub-species-- C. a. kalckreuthi --is
identical in colouring, but the wings are shorter. This applies to both
sexes. The Sudan sub-species--C. a. doggetti --whilst having wings
of the same length as the first mentioned differs from both in so much
that the adult male has a metallic bluish-green forehead to crown.
The female is identical to the Portuguese East African sub-species.

Scarlet-chested (C. senegalensis ).
Another fairly large African sunbird 5 to 6 inches in length ; there
are four sub-species ranging from South Africa up to Abyssinia and
across to the Northern Cameroons. The sub-species we are interested
in here is C. gutturalis which is to be found from Kenya Colony right
down to the Cape. The other two sub-species are to be found north
of the Equator in Abyssinia and Somaliland and in Equatorial Africa
in the Belgian Congo and Uganda. There is no non-breeding dress
and the adult male of the first named sub-species has a metallic-green
forehead and crown, metallic-violet shoulders with the remainder of
the upper parts velvety-black. The flight and tail feathers are brownish-
black with a blush of old gold. The chin and upper neck are the same
colour as the crown with the lower chin and chest a crimson-red with
blue markings just below the tip of each feather. When the feathers
of the chest are puffed these blue markings show up as blue flecks on an
otherwise scarlet chest. The female is dusky-olive above, with the
flight and tail feathers having a bronzy tinge and with white edges to
the primaries. The lower parts are olivaceous-yellow streaked with
dusky-brown, the throat being darker than the remainder. A pair of
these birds nested this year, but unfortunately the one chick was
thrown out of the nest at just 48 hours old. The female is now busily
tidying up the nest and we have hopes of better luck next time. In the
North Abyssinian sub-species--C. s. cruentata --the adult male is
similar in appearance except that the chin and upper throat are black
and the metallic shoulder colouring is confined to the wing-butts.
Further, the female lacks the white edged primaries. The adult male
from the equatorial regions-- C. s. lamperti --is similar in appearance
to the first named, but is larger and has a longer bill. The hen is of
the same colouring as the N. Abyssinian sub-species.

Coppery (C. cupreus cupreus).
One of the smaller African sunbirds, being only 4 to 5 inches in total
length and the male having, as its name implies, an upper mantle of
metallic golden-copper. This colour covers the head and neck
completely round to the upper chest. The lower portion of the mantle,
the rump, the upper tail-coverts, and the lower wing-coverts are a
metallic-purple and the underparts are black. The flight and tail
feathers are blue-black, the tail being markedly square with no
elongations. In non-breeding dress the male resembles the female
except that the black flight and tail feathers are retained as are the
metallic wing and upper tail-coverts. The female is olive-green above
and yellow below with a lighter patch at the throat. The tail is
blue-black with light edges and tips to the outer feathers.

Eastern Double-collared (C. mediocris ).
There are a number of sunbirds from Africa which are accorded the
general title of Double-collared, but the one referred to here comes
from Kenya and, although smaller than the South African species,
lacks nothing in the matter of colouring. Broadly speaking, the adult
male resembles the Beautiful Sunbird--dealt with later under the
genus Nectarinia --except that it has a narrow metallic-blue band
across the upper chest with a broader scarlet band below and the rest
of the underparts an olivaceous-yellow. Further, there are no elongated
feathers in the blue-black tail the outer feathers of which are edged
and tipped with white. There is no non-breeding dress, but there is
the tendency for the scarlet to lose its brilliance in captivity. The
female has duller black wings than the male and the olive edges to
the flight feathers are more distinct. The upper parts are an olive
moss-green as are the flanks and throat. The remainder of the under-
parts are a yellowish-olive. The tail is blue-black with white edges and
tips to the outer feathers in a pattern similar to those of the male.
Loten's (C. lotenia lotenia).
The Loten's Sunbird is to be found in Southern India and Ceylon
and, although the largest sunbird from the latter area, is one of the
smallest species we have, being only 4 inches in length. For its size
it has a fairly long bill, which is curved downward more than is
customary in the general range of sunbirds. There still appears to be
some doubt as to whether the male has a non-breeding dress or not
and this is obviously a matter that could do with further investigation.
In the specimens kept here the males at the commencement of their
moult certainly lost some of their brilliance, but refeathered in their
full adult attire. The general colouring of the adult male is a metallic-
blue head, neck, and upper parts, with a purple throat and breast.
The remaining underparts are a sooty-brown, almost black, as are the
wings. The upper tail-coverts are metallic-blue and the tail-feathers
themselves a bluish-black. The female is olive-grey above and pale
yellow below, with a black tail the feathers of which are tipped with
pale yellow.
Marico (C. mariquensis ).
This African species which is found over a wide range from South
Africa up to Somaliland, is very similar in appearance to the Purple-
banded, but is larger, the male being 5 to 6 inches in length. There is
no non-breeding dress and the adult male's head, neck, mantle to
rump, including the lesser wing-coverts, are a vivid metallic-green
with a golden sheen. The wing feathers are blue-black as is the rounded
tail. The underparts are smoky-black except for a metallic-violet
band across the upper breast with a narrow maroon band above.

</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999327476190476" page_id="56315351"  page_num="141" year="" vol="">
The female is ashy-coloured above with yellow underparts except for
the throat which is smoky, the feathers having white tips which produce
a flecked appearance. The tail is blue-black with the outer feathers
white edged and, except for the central pair, white tipped.
Purple-banded (C. bifasciatus tsavoensis ).
As stated above, there is considerable similiarity between the Marico
and this species, except that it is a much smaller bird, about 4 inches
long and the maroon band across the chest is narrower and more
violet tinged. Like the preceding species there is no non-breeding
dress. The distribution of this species is much more limited, being
confined to an area from Southern Somaliland down to Zululand and
from Eastern Tanganyika across to the Cameroons, but always inland
and not in the coastal regions. The female is ashy-olive above with
the underparts of pale-yellow streaked with sooty-black. The throat
is smoky-black and the rounded tail is black with white-tipped feathers.
White-bellied (C. talatala ).
This is one of the smallest sunbirds from the northern parts of
South Africa, the adult male being only 4 inches in length. The head
and upperparts of the adult male are a metallic greenish-blue with old
gold reflections. The upper tail-coverts are more blue than green and
the wings a dull black. The tail is blue-black with metallic-green
edges to the outer feathers. The chin is sooty and the throat metallic-
green. There is a violet band across the chest below which is a narrow
black band. The rest of the underparts are white. The female is
ashy-brown above with a bluish-black tail, the feathers of which are
edged with metallic-green as are the upper tail-coverts. The underparts
are a dingy white. The male in non-breeding dress resembles the female
except that the blue-black tail, metallic wing, and upper tail-coverts
are retained.
Yellow-bellied Variable (C. venustus falkensteini ).
There are four sub-species of the Variable to be found in Africa,
the above being from Kenya. The White-bellied Variable is from the
Somaliland and Abyssinia ; the Northern Yellow-bellied from Sudan,
and the Orange-bellied is to be found in the Belgian Congo and
Tanganyika. They are very similar in appearance, the main difference
being the colour of the underparts. The general colouring of the adult
male of the Kenya sub-species is a metallic bluish-green over the top
and back of the head and the upper parts. In the sunlight this is
enhanced with a sheen of old gold. The forehead is violet and the blue
shade of the upper parts deepens on the upper tail-coverts, the tail
itself being blue-black with metallic-green edges to the outer feathers.
All the tail feathers have lightish tips. Below the neck it is metallic-blue

with a steel-blue, washed with violet, throat. The remainder of the
underparts are bright-yellow as are the pectoral tufts. The female is
olive-grey above and pale-yellow below, with a blue-black tail. The
male in non-breeding dress resembles the female, except that the
metallic colouring of the wings and upper tail-coverts is retained.

Green-headed (C. verticalis ).
Another Kenya species where the male bird has no non-breeding
dress. The adult male has the head, neck, and sides of face a metallic-
green with the rest of the upper-parts an olivaceous-green. From the
chin to the chest it is metallic greenish-blue, with the remainder of
the underparts grey. The pectoral tufts are orange. The female is
very similar in appearance having the green head and neck, but they
are not such a bright shade of green as in the male. From the chin to
the chest it is dusky-grey merging into smoky-grey through the rest of
the underparts. It is a medium-sized bird being about 5 inches in
length.
Mouse-coloured (C. veroxii).
One of the larger sunbirds, being 9 inches in length and is often
referred to as the Grey Sunbird. The sub-species kept here is C. v.
fischeri which comes from Portuguese East Africa. There is no non-
breeding dress with the adult male which is grey, with a greenish gloss
above. The tail is dull-black with greenish edges to the inner webs and
the pectoral tufts are red, streaked with yellow. The underparts are
greyish-white. The female is similar in colouring, but lacks the pectoral
tufts and is slightly smaller. This species is about the most sombre
coloured of the entire family of sunbirds.
Olive (C. olivacea ).
This South African sunbird closely resembles the preceding species,
but is much smaller, being only 5 to 6 inches in length. Further, it is
olive-green above, with dusky wings and tail and the underparts are a
grey-green shade. Both sexes have yellow pectoral tufts and, there
being no non-breeding dress with the male, the only difference between
the sexes is that the female has a shorter tail.

ward curve of the bill, that of the male being larger and more curved
than the female's. The breeding dress of the adult male is a metallic

the remainder of the wings and the tail, black with bright golden outer
webs. The central pair of tail-feathers are extremely elongated to the
extent that they represent one-third of the total length of the bird.
From chin to chest it is metallic coppery-red with the rest of the under-
parts black. In non-breeding dress the entire upper-parts and from
the chin to chest are black, the wings retain their metallic butts and
there is no change with the tail. The female is olive-green above and
yellow mottled with olive below. The flight and tail feathers are
edged with golden-yellow, but there are no elongated tail feathers.
Genus NECTARINIA
Beautiful ( Jsf. pulchella rnelanogastra ).
The general colour of the adult male is metallic golden-green. This
colouring extends to the belly in the Senegal sub-species, but, with the
Kenya sub-species---which we have here--the belly is black. The flight-
feathers are blue-black as are the tail feathers, the central pair of which
are elongated and edged with metallic-green. There is a brilliant red
patch in the centre of the chest which is edged with yellow in a golden-
green surrounded. Unlike the Senegal sub-species, there is no non-
breeding dress. It is in the medium size range of sunbirds, measuring
6 to 7 inches from tip of bill to the end of elongated tail feathers. The
female is ashy-olive above, tinged with pale-yellow which colouring
extends to the sides of the head. The chin and throat are yellowish-
white, with the rest of the underparts yellow. The tail is blackish
with narrow metallic-green tips except for the outer feathers which have
white edges and tips.
Bronze (jV*. kilimensis ).
Another species from Kenya, where the male bird has elongated
tail feathers and there is no non-breeding dress. It is considerably
larger than the preceding species, being about 9 inches in total length.
The general colouring of the adult male is dull metallic-green with
bronzy reflections which resemble old-gold in the sunlight. There is
no green in the mantle, wing-coverts, rump, and chest which are purely
of a dull metallic old-gold colouring. The rest of the underparts,
wings, and tail are purplish-black with the greatly elongated central
tail-feathers being edged with metallic-bronze. It has a fairly long
downward-curved bill and is a most striking bird when seen in the
sunlight. The female might at first sight be confused with the Malachite
hen, the main points of difference being that the Bronze's bill curves
more downward and the central tail feathers are slightly elongated.
The upper parts and wings are olive-brown, the chin is whitish and
the underparts are yellow streaked with brown. The tail has a purplish-
tinge as against the bluish shade of the Malachite and the yellow eye-
stripe is smaller and narrower. There is a sub-species from South

Africa-- JV. k. arturi --but here the bronzy old-gold suffusion of the male
is replaced by a coppery shade of colouring. There is, however, no
distinct difference in the females.
Malachite (JV*. famosa ).
One of the largest of the sunbirds, the male being i o inches in length
and, with its metallic emerald-green shot with gold colouring, is, to
my eye, one of the most attractive. It is to be found over quite a wide
area in Africa, extending from just north of the Equator to as far down
as the northern parts of South Africa. It has a slightly downward-
curved bill of over an inch in length, and disports brilliant yellow
pectoral tufts. The flight and tail feathers are black, the central pair
of tail feathers being greatly elongated. From the chest to the under
tail-coverts it is a deep metallic-blue but, in the sunlight, little
differentiation in the general emerald colouring is noticeable. The
non-breeding dress resembles the female somewhat, except the black
flight-feathers and the elongated tail feathers are retained. In the
majority of instances some of the metallic green body feathering also
remains. The female is much smaller than the male, being only about
6 inches long, but the difference is mostly due to the lack of elongated
tail feathers. The upper-parts are olivaceous-grey and the lower-
parts yellowish-green, mottled with dark-green. There is a distinct
yellow eye-stripe which marking, together with the downward curved
bill and the size, is one of the best aids to identification.
Purple (JV. asiatica).
Whereas the three species of the JVectarinia so far described are
inhabitants of Africa, the Purple is to be found in India. It is a small
bird, being about 4 inches in length. The adult male is black with a
metallic-cobalt or purple sheen. The tufts of crimson and yellow
beneath each wing are fully visible only when the bird is displaying,
but can just be seen when it is in repose. In non-breeding dress the
male is brownish above with dark-yellow underparts, the general
colouring of the female, but it retains the dark wings and a broad
metallic-violet stripe from chin to abdomen. These birds are not good
travellers, this fact applying in particular to the females, but, once
acclimatized, they appear to be quite hardy although a little
quarrelsome.
Purple-rumped (JV. zeylanica).
This is another of the smaller sunbirds of which there are two
sub-species--both small--the larger of the two being the Indian
sub-species and the other coming from Ceylon. The adult male has no
eclipse plumage, the most conspicuous parts of his colouring being the
bright yellow underparts and the purple rump. The crown is a
metallic dark blue and the chin and throat are a deep vinous shade

with a metallic gloss. The upper parts and wings are a rich, deep brown
the tail feathers being even a deeper shade. The female is inclined to
resemble the Purple female, except that the underparts are lighter and
the back and wings are a rich brown. Further, the paleness of the
underparts is extended to the face which is much lighter than that of
the Purple. One more distinguishing feature is that both sexes have a
red-brown iris as compared to the usual dark brown with the majority
of sunbirds.
Scarlet-tufted Malachite ( JV. johnstoni or JV. f. oenigularis ).
This sunbird is sometimes regarded as a sub-species, but has also
been classified as a separate species and it is for that reason that I have
included it alphabetically and not immediately following the Malachite.
It is, if anything, slightly larger than the latter species and, in my opinion,
with its metallic bottle-green suffused with a sheen of old-gold and its
brilliant red pectoral tufts, is even more attractive. The central tail
feathers are elongated to a greater extent than the Malachite and the
tail and flight feathers are bluish-black. The female is about the same
size as the female Malachite, but differs in general colouring by being
darker. It also lacks the eye-stripe and has orange-red wing tufts.
In non-breeding dress the male resembles the female except that the
pectoral tufts remain red, the flight and tail feathers do not change
colour, and the elongated tail feathers are retained. Its normal habitat
is Eastern Equatorial Africa, but it has been found both to the north
and the south of this region.
Tacazze (JV. tacazze ).
This African sunbird is about the same size as the Malachite, but
has a more cobby appearance. The head and neck of the adult male
in breeding dress is a metallic bronzy-green, with the mantle down to
the upper tail-coverts, the wing-coverts, the chest and breast being a
metallic reddish-violet. The wings, tail, and rest of the underparts
are black. The central pair of tail feathers are elongated, the outer
feathers being broad, giving a square appearance to the tail. The
female is olive-brown above and dusky-yellow below, with an eye-
stripe of the same colour. The central tail feathers are slightly
elongated, but not to the extent of the male's which, in non-breeding
dress resembles the female except that he retains the black flights and
tail with the extended pair of central feathers. It is assumed that older
males do not go into eclipse plumage since this condition has been
observed in birds that have been kept in captivity for a number of years.
Yellow-bellied (JV. jugularis).
This sunbird which is to be found in Burma in the lower regions
should not be confused with the Yellow-breasted from Malaya.

Although of the same size, about inches, the similiarity ends there.
The adult male has a metallic-green head, the remaining upper-parts
being a dark brown. The throat is metallic-purple with a maroon
band across the breast, the rest of the underparts being bright yellow.
In non-breeding dress it retains part of the throat patch and can thus
be distinguished from the female which, in turn, cannot be
distinguished from the Purple female in colouration. The female is,
however, a fraction larger than the Purple, but only by the most careful
scrutiny and comparison can the two be distinguished apart.

By J. Newmark (London, England)
Following my article, " Birds of Morocco," in the Jan.-Feb. (i960)
number of the Avicultural Magazine, which was based on a trip to
North Africa in 1959, I can now report more fully on a second visit to
Morocco in April, i960. On this occasion four of us made up the
party : Mr. John Yealland, Curator of Birds at the London Zoo ;
Mr. Ian Schalburg, a keen bird-watcher from Sussex ; my brother,
Mr. George Newmark, who came with me last year ; and myself.
We stayed for a few days in Tangiers and Marrakech, then spent a
week in Taroudant, 50 miles from Agadir, and returned via Marrakech
and Tangiers. We identified about 100 birds altogether ; many of
these, if seen in England, would send a bird-watcher into rhapsodies,
although they were fairly common in Morocco.

It was our first evening in Tangiers, 7th April, that we went for a
stroll into the surrounding country, and on this first excursion we saw a
number of exciting birds : Orphean Warblers, Sylvia hortensis, Sub-
alpine Warblers, Sylvia cantillans, Blue-headed Wagtails, Motacilla
flava Jlava, White Wagtails, Motacilla alba alba , Crested Larks, Galerida
cristata, Corn Buntings, Emberiza calandra , Serins, Serinus canarius,
Siskins, Carduelis spinus, the white-throated form of the Black-eared
Wheatear, Oenanthe hispanica, Woodchat Shrikes, Lanius senator ,
European Bee-eaters, Merops apiaster , Chaffinches, Fringilla coelebs
africana , Pied Flycatchers, Muscicapa striata , and the more familiar
Swallows, Swifts, House-Martins, Goldfinches, Greenfinches, Black-
caps, Whitethroats, and Winchats. A rewarding evening indeed, and
over dinner that night there was only one topic of conversation--birds.
Early the next morning we saw about 150 Black Kites, Milvus
mi grans, soaring out across the bay ; in fact we saw this species every
day, sometimes in large numbers, sometimes in small groups or singly.
The Red Kite, Milvus milvus , we saw only twice, however. Later in the
morning we sat on a small hillock overlooking an expanse of marshy
ground, and watched, first, a pair of Montagu's Harriers, Circus
pygargus , then a pair of Marsh Harriers, Circus aeruginosus , quartering
the ground in their characteristic manner. We also saw a number of
White Storks, Ciconia ciconia, Hoopoes, Upupa epops , and a Booted
Eagle, Hieraetus pennatus. This last bird had us puzzled for some time,
and in our eagerness to keep it in sight, we found ourselves trespassing
on private property and were duly arrested by numerous guards
patrolling the forest into which we had wandered. In perfect English
we asked the leader to direct us out and whether he had ever seen a
Booted Eagle, but as he replied in perfect Arabic we never discovered
whether he was even remotely interested in birds. At the moment he
was extremely interested in us, and after much discussion in a variety
of languages, mainly English, some French, a smattering of Malay,
and a dash of Swahili, we established friendly relations by producing
our field guide and showing all the coloured illustrations of birds.
They eventually came to the rightful conclusion that we were perfectly
harmless and escorted us off the property.
Over 300 miles to the south, in Marrakech, one of the commonest
birds we saw was the Dusky Bulbul, Pycnonotus barbatus barbatus. Like
many rather drab-looking birds, it has a cheerful bubbling song and
could be heard throughout the day in the shaded parks and olive
groves. Another common bird in Marrakech was the House Bunting,
Emberiza striolata , very similar in appearance to the Rock-Bunting.
They picked up scraps of food left under the tables and on the hotel
balconies, and generally gave the impression of being fearless and
confident, reminding one of our own House Sparrow. Other birds
frequently seen here included Lesser Kestrels, Falco naumanni , Cattle

Egrets, Ardeola ibis, Red-rumped Swallows, Hirundo daurica, White-
rumped Swifts, Apus affinis, and Rufous Warblers, Agrobates galactotes.
Less frequently we saw Spotless Starlings, Sturms unicolor , Sardinian
Warblers, Sylvia melanocephala , and Rollers, Coracias garrulus. About
20 miles to the south the Atlas Mountains present a magnificent
panorama of snow-capped peaks stretching across the horizon, and
before leaving Marrakech we visited the Ourika Valley in the foothills.
Here we saw a family party of Choughs, Pyrrhocorax pyrrhocorax barbarus,
and some Ravens, Corvus corax tingitanus ; also a few very attractive tits,
rather like a cross between the Blue Tit and the Great Tit, but which
we were unable to identify.
The journey by bus across the Atlas Mountains was mainly a
succession of hairpin bends and hair-raising moments as the driver
negotiated each bend in turn. For about 75 miles there is hardly a
straight stretch of road and most of the grim-faced Moroccan passengers
on the bus pulled their hoods well down over their faces to hide the
mountain scenery and the prospect of the bus hurtling down the
mountainside. We were the only Europeans on the bus and our time
was divided between watching the scenery and watching for birds.
From a moving vehicle, of course, it is difficult to get clear views of
any bird, but we did glimpse a partridge now and then, probably the
Barbary Partridge, Alectoris barbara. Taroudant, where we stayed for a
week, lies in a wide valley south of the Atlas Mountains. Here we
hired bicycles and made trips to a dried-up river bed a few miles away.
This was the Sous River and we did find an area a few hundred yards
long which was marshy and contained a number of waders. These
marshes and pools proved to be one of our most successful bird-
watching areas and we were able to watch, at close range, Black-
winged Stilts, Himantopus himantopus , Little Egrets, Egretta garzetta,
a Purple Heron, Ardea purpurea , an immature Squacco Heron, Ardeola
ralloides, a Little Bittern, Ixobrychus minutus, Spotted Redshanks,
Tringa erythropus, Greenshanks, Tringa nebularia , and a crake which
disappeared into the reeds before we could identify it properly.
On other excursions around Taroudant we saw the Rough-legged
Buzzard, Buteo lagopus , Egyptian Vultures, Neophron percnopterns, a
fleeting glimpse of a Cream-coloured Courser, Cursorius cursor, a few
Moorish Magpies, Pica pica mauritanica --one of which was offered to us
for sale and was duly brought back to the London Zoo--Black

Blackbird is sooty black rather than dark brown ; Mr. W. H. Bierman
noticed this and reported it in the Bulletin of the British Ornithologists&apos;
Club , Volume 77, Number 4, dated 1st April, 1957.
For the sake of completeness, I should mention the more familiar
birds which we saw from time to time in various places : Herring-
Gulls, Black-headed Gulls, Pied Wagtails, Yellow Wagtails, Grey
Wagtails, Sand-Martins, Common Sandpipers, Robins, Redstarts,
Wheatears, Herons, Kestrels, Redshanks, Spotted Flycatchers, Great
Tits, Wood-Pigeons, Turtle-Doves, Linnets, a Moorhen, a Kingfisher,
Stonechats, a Little Owl, and House-Sparrows.
For the bird-watcher, Morocco offers a most enjoyable and exciting
holiday. Many rarities in the British Isles are to be seen there daily
and it provides some very useful practice in accurate observation.
The Orphean and Sardinian Warblers could easily have been mistaken
for Blackcaps ; the White Wagtail for the Pied Wagtail ; the Lesser
Kestrel for the Kestrel. By carefully noting slight variations in wing
pattern or length of wings or shape of tail, and subsequently comparing
them with the illustrations in a good Field Guide, mistakes can be
avoided. Indeed, a Field Guide is as important as a pair of binoculars ;
our own even played quite a useful part in securing our release after
we had been arrested in the forest !

By J. J. Yealland
As briefly explained in the last number of the Magazine, the Tropical
House has been much improved by the removal of the corridor and
all partitions and made into what is sometimes known as a con-
servatory aviary, or walk-through aviary. Though not on the scale of
the conservatory aviary in West Park, Pittsburgh, described by
Mr. Roland W. Hawkins (.Avicultural Magazine, 1954), this house in its
new form is appreciated by visitors and is, so far, successful in the
avicultural sense. The actual flying space is some 47 feet by 28 feet
and at a height of about 11 feet, a small meshed nylon net has been
fixed so as to prevent the escape of birds through the roof windows by
means of which the house is ventilated. The paved walk through the
middle has been widened and on one side, running the whole length
of the house, is an area of water varying from 3 to 4 feet in width and
6 inches deep, though filled to within an inch of the surface with fine
shingle. Beyond the water is an area of peat moss in which a variety
of tropical plants are growing and the purpose of the water " barrier "
is to confine visitors to the paved walk and thus provide the birds with
a secluded place. On the other side, a raised concrete platform has

been retained with the front wall raised so as to hold sufficient peat
for the growing of plants. This area is no more than 4 feet wide,
running the length of the house, but it, too, is frequented by the birds
even when people are moving about the walk. The present occupants are
humming birds, sugar birds, and sunbirds, numbering twenty-seven
specimens. A darkened porch at the entrance and exit prevents the
escape of birds. In addition to being a great improvement to existing
accommodation, this conversion will provide information of use in the
planning of a new and much larger Tropical House.
Recent arrivals of especial interest include five forms new to the
collection. These are a Chestnut-winged Guan ( Ortalis erythroptera)
presented by Mr. Tom Spence, a Quaker Parrakeet ( Myiopsitta monacha
colon a), that was collected in Paraguay by David Attenborough, two
Sclater's Motmots ( Momotus momota microstephanus) , two Red-headed
Tits ( Aegithaliscus concinnus rubricapillus) , presented by Messrs. G. H.
and J. R. Newmark, who also gave two Himalayan Yellow-backed
Sunbirds ; and an Isthmian Sugar Bird or Honey Creeper ( Cyanerpes
caeruleus isthmicus) , given together with a Mrs. Wilson's Tanager by
Mr. R. W. Drury. A Red-footed Gannet (Sula sula rubripes), that had
been kept as a pet in the Cocos Islands, a Black-footed Penguin found
covered in oil near Cape Town, and three young Greater Spotted
Woodpeckers rescued from a fallen tree have also been received.
Three eggs laid by the Kea have proved to be infertile. Two Silver
Gulls, two Ceylon Jungle fowl, two Eagle-Owls ( Bubo bubo), and three
Snowy Owls are the most noteworthy of the birds recently bred in the
Gardens. The Snowy Owl eggs were given just before hatching to
foster-parents--one to a Woodford's Owl and two to Abyssinian Eagle-
Owls whose own eggs were not fertile and the chicks are thriving.
Their rightful mother has a bad record, having reared only one chick
from a number of clutches laid during the course of several years.
In spite of having incubated the eggs for some thirty days, she has
laid again.
The three Spotted Eagle-Owl chicks previously reported are now
almost fully grown. A Green-winged King Parrakeet that was,
I believe, brought by Mr. Shaw Mayer in 1939, hatched a single egg,
but the chick did not survive.

interesting to note that at the first Conference, which met in London in
1922, only three nations participated, whereas now there are fifty

R. K. Wright, Adelaide, South Australia, favours the colony
system for breeding Queen Alexandra's Parrakeets and has had
considerable success--1959, twenty-two young reared.
Early in September, 1958, an unattached female Rock Pebbler was
seen to mate with an odd Queen Alexandra's, and although a male
of her own species was obtained for her she showed no interest, but
continued to consort with the Queen Alexandra's. The first of four
eggs was laid on 21st September ; two proved infertile but the
remaining two produced excellent young ones. These are flourishing
and are apparently a true pair.

The Jubilee (1909-1959) Annual Report of the Royal Zoological Society
of Scotland gives the 1959 breeding results with the penguins in the
Edinburgh Zoo. " The breeding of the Park's old colony during the
year was only partially successful, deaths among chicks hatched being
largely due to the prolonged hot summer. Of seven king chicks
hatched from eleven eggs only two were fully reared ; from six
maccaroni eggs laid only two hatched and both chicks succumbed ;
of the nine gentoo chicks hatched from ten eggs (a gentoo record for
the Park) only four survived. As usual the young birds were sold or
exchanged, thus preventing inbreeding in the colony while supplying
other Societies with acclimatized birds reared to hand-feeding."
The Society's free-flying colony of Night Herons continues to thrive
and now numbers about thirty-six birds, descendants of the original
three pairs that escaped from an aviary.

Les Oiseaux du Monde. Atlas des Oiseaux. Tomes 1 and 2. By
L. Delapchier, with illustrations by the author. Editions
N. Boubee and Cie., Paris. Tome 1, 1959. Tome 2, i960. Price,
36 New Francs each.
This is a new edition of the Petits Atlas des Oiseaux entirely rewritten
and considerably enlarged. The volumes are of convenient size,
measuring 7^ x 5J inches, and though the text is in French, are
a useful guide to those with only an elementary knowledge of this
language.
Volume 1 contains short chapters on fossil birds, morphology,
internal anatomy, and biology of birds, which give the reader a good
general idea of these subjects. These are followed by an account of
" The Bird, Nature and Man 55 which starts with a quotation from
Michelet : Sans Voiseau Vhomme ne saw ait subsister sur la terre (Without
birds man could not exist on the earth). The author quotes many
instances of the utility of birds and deplores their progressive decrease
which he ascribes as much to thoughtless destruction as to the damage
resulting from " so-called civilization ".
The author then makes a comprehensive survey of the birds of
the world, first giving a short description of the Order, then the
Family, following with accounts of various species ; this is continued
and completed in Volume 2. There are six plates in black and white
and thirty coloured plates depicting 199 species of birds and fifty-
seven eggs in Volume 1. In Volume 2 there are ten plates in black
and white and twenty-four coloured plates depicting 202 species of
birds and forty-seven of chicks. The author is also the illustrator
of his book and the coloured plates are of a high standard and, in
most cases, well reproduced. The black and white illustrations of
nests are particularly instructive.
In his introduction Professor Berlioz writes : ". . . I do not doubt
that in this ' Atlas 3 which is a comprehensive work and yet produced
in greatly condensed form will do much to arouse further interest in
ornithology among naturalists. What more reliable or clearer guide
could they find ? 35
Professor Berlioz concludes his introduction by expressing his great
regret on the recent death of the author before seeing publication
of his latest work. As Professor Berlioz says : " Having devoted the
last period of his life entirely to ornithology and his art, his memory
will remain indissolubly associated with this posthumous production
the scientific integrity of which reflects so well what has always been
his own personality. 53

A notice in the January-March, 1960, number of International Zoo Mews stated that
an American Condor had been artificially incubated in the Frankfurt (Main) Zoo.
At the request of the Hon. Secretary of the Avicultural Society the Director of the
Frankfurt Zoo, Dr. Grzimek, has kindly forwarded the following notes regarding
this achievement :--
An egg of an American Condor which had not been brooded by the parents was
artificially incubated in the incubator of the Zoological Gardens, Frankfurt (Main)
and hatched out on 25th May, 1959. The artificial incubation is not difficult and could
be done in any poultry incubator. At the time of hatching the weight of the young
Condor was 250 gr. As in the wild the Condor feeds its young on predigested food,
this makes the rearing very difficult. An investigation of the fluid content of the
crop of an adult Condor indicated to some extent the composition of the food. The
young bird was fed on meat predigested by means of stomach fermentations in a
thermostat and to this lime salts and various vitamins were added. The rearing
was successful and within fourteen days the young Condor had doubled its weight.
On 5th December, 1959, when about six months old, the bird had attained a weight
of 22 lb. 200 gr. During this period also it began to attempt to fly. The bird is extra-
ordinarily tame and confiding and can still be allowed its freedom without any
difficulty. It is attached to its home and so far has made no attempt to fly away,
remaining most of the time in the Childrens' Zoo of the Zoological Gardens, only
flying on to the roofs in the vicinity in the evening or when there are not many people
about. The extreme friendliness of this large bird which now has a wing-span of
3 m. is astonishing. It will sit for hours on the laps of various subscribers who visit
it daily, and allow itself to be gently scratched. It can at once distinguish its foster-
parents, Dr. and Mrs. Faust, among a large number of visitors and immediately
flies to them, often over a considerable distance.

C. af Enehjelm (Hogholmens Djurgard, Helsingfors)
On the 29th December, 1959, our Zoo received a pair of Spotted
Eagle-Owls in exchange from the Zoological Society of London. The
birds were bred in Regent's Park the same year, and according to
Mr. Yealland (in litt.) were hatched about the end of April.
The owls were put in an indoor flight measuring about 8 X 8 X 8 ft.
in a big room where several species of owls and birds of prey are
placed for the winter, a necessary precaution in our severe winter.
The birds settled down nicely. They were mainly fed with rats, white
mice, golden hamsters, and rabbit meat.
I was astonished to find an egg on the floor on 16th February.
I erected a nest of bricks in a corner of the cage about 1 X 1 ft., laid
some coarse hay in it and placed the egg, which was slightly damaged,
in the nest--without much hope. Two further eggs were, however,
laid in the nest, with a day's interval on 18th and 20th February.
They then apparently started sitting regularly on 21st or 22nd
February.
One young was hatched on 21st March, the second possibly late
on the same day or on the following day. As I was anxious to breed
this, to me, new species, I did not disturb the birds. The male by
the way, was rather aggressive, so I left them well alone, only doing
the most necessary cleaning. I hardly saw the young as long as they
were small, as the hen sat very tightly.
On 26th April we succeeded in getting the first photo of the young
and the hen, another photo was taken on 8th June, when the young
were already flying quite well. A couple of weeks later the young were
ringed and the family were turned into an outdoor flight, about
10 X 25 ft. and 20 feet high, where they are thriving well.
This breeding success was quite unexpected. The birds were only
about 1 o months old when they started nesting. I had previously bred

the European species (Bubo bubo) on several occasions, and as far as
I can trace this species does not start breeding before 2-3 years old.
Of course the European species is considerably larger--26-28 inches
total length, as compared with the small African species, which is only
about 17-18 inches total length. This smaller, tropical species
apparently reaches maturity in a very much shorter time than the big
northern birds.

THE BLUE-WINGED GRASS PARRAKEET
(.Neophema chrysostomus chrysostomus)

By Dr. J. R. Hodges (Pinner, Middlesex, England)
All the members of the genus Neophema are highly desirable aviary
birds and one of the most attractive is the Blue-winged Grass Parrakeet
(N. chrysostomus ). A description of this species usually provides an image
of a bird very similar to the Elegant Parrakeet, more olive green and
with more blue on the wings. However, no words can describe
adequately the delicate shading of the greens, the wonderful intensity
of the blue, or the magnificent emerald sheen on the upper part of the
breast, which is seen so well when the bird is viewed in sunlight from
above when it is feeding on the ground.
Before the war Blue-winged Grass Parrakeets could be obtained
fairly readily, and they were bred occasionally in the aviaries of private
individuals and fairly often at the Keston Foreign Bird Farm. However,
by the end of the war the species had disappeared from British aviaries.
In 1958 and again in 1959 a few pairs were imported from Australia.
I was able to obtain in the spring of last year a pair from the second
consignment. The cock was a nondescript specimen minus most of its
tail feathers, but the hen was in perfect condition. However, the hen
died only a few weeks after I had received the birds. A post-mortem
examination showed quite clearly that death was due to crop binding.
I was sorry that I had not diagnosed the trouble earlier, but I still do
not know how it could have been avoided or treated effectively. The
cock spent the remainder of the year with a pair of Bourke's Parrakeets
in an aviary 11 feet by 3 feet. It became very tame indeed and would
display and sing its rather squeaky and pathetic little song whenever
I visited the aviary. When it was not displaying to me it centred its
attention on the hen Bourke's in the same aviary or the hen of a pair
of Elegants in the next compartment. It moulted in July and developed
into a really magnificent specimen.
Blue-winged Grass Parrakeets were bred in 1959 by at least three
different British aviculturists, although only one occasion was recorded

and then only briefly in a summary of breeding results in the aviaries
of Sir Crawford McCullagh. In December one of the successful
breeders let me have a hen, and so I was able to start i960 with an
adult imported cock and a young aviary-bred hen.
By the end of March it was obvious that the pair were anxious to
breed. A nest-box 2 feet by 8 inches by 8 inches was placed in the
open flight and about 4 inches of damp peat was stuffed into the
bottom of the box. Almost immediately the hen entered the box and
commenced spending hours every day throwing out most of the peat.
Ultimately one egg appeared in the nest, followed by five more. The
first three were laid on alternate days and the others on successive
days. Incubation started with the appearance of the second egg. At
this stage the previously attentive cock seemed to lose interest and was
never seen feeding the hen on the nest. When next I had the opportunity
to inspect the nest, exactly four weeks after the first egg had been laid,
all the eggs had hatched. The hen spent most of the time away from
the nest at the food containers, presumably because the cock provided
no assistance in feeding her or the young birds. Six youngsters may
have been too many for the hen to cope with alone, and the three
youngest birds died when they were about a week old. The other
three continued to thrive for about three weeks. Then one day both the
parent birds seemed to become excessively active, flying incessantly to
and from the entrance hole of the nest-box and calling to the youngsters.
They were obviously trying to coax the babies out of the nest and
ultimately two of the youngsters fell to the ground. I replaced them
only to find them again on the aviary floor an hour or two later.
I put them back again but became suspicious at the amount of noise
the hen was making scuffling about inside the nest-box. When I looked
in to see what had happened I found that she had tried to dispose of
her offspring by burying them alive in the peat at the bottom of the
nest-box. I rescued two of the young birds but the other had not
survived its traumatic Experience.
My attempts to hand-rear the two survivors were not successful.
I placed them in a small box and for almost a week they appeared to
do well on a sloppy mixture of " Farex " and " Ostermilk " which
was administered by means of a hypodermic syringe without the
needle. One morning the young birds did not come to the edge of the
box for their feed as usual, and a few hours later they both died for
reasons which I am unable to explain. On the previous evening they
were very active and healthy, and while they were being fed they kept
jumping out of their box and careering around the kitchen floor like
clockwork toys.
Meanwhile the hen had produced another clutch of four eggs.
They all hatched but two of the young birds died before they were a
week old. The other two were reared uneventfully and are

both excellent specimens. Again, the male made no contribution
towards the rearing of the youngsters either before or after they had
left the nest. However, by the time the second brood had flown he had
started to moult and was not interested in driving the hen to nest again.
The adult pair are kept, with a pair of Blue-faced Parrot Finches, in
a small aviary 11 feet by 3 feet with a turved open flight, a covered
flight, and an enclosed shelter which is not heated in the winter.
They are fed on budgerigar mixture, sunflower seed and a little hemp.
They are given fresh green food, seeding grasses and millet sprays as
often as possible.
Apparently some other breeders have been successful with Blue-wings
this year. With luck, this attractive species may be re-established as an
aviary bird in this country.

By Mrs. O. L. Gent (Berkhamsted, Herts, England)
I purchased a pair of Blue-winged Grass Parrakeets in the Autumn
of 1958. They were kept in a large stock cage until June, 1959, when
they were put into an aviary with an open wire front, with a pair of
Wax wings.
The staple diet for the Parrakeets was canary, panicum, millet, wild
seeds with plenty of millet sprays, but they were very fond of the
currants and " Sluis " provided for the Waxwings. The four birds
agreed very well together.
A nest-box made from a piece of apple-tree trunk was placed in
a corner, but the hen took no notice of it at all, so at the beginning of
April this year we put in one of a different type and within an hour
she had gone into the original box and about 15th April the first egg
was laid. The cock bird was very attentive and fed her regularly.
About the beginning of June I was rather anxious because I had
seen nothing of her for three days, so although it was a risky job I took
the nest-box down to inspect it and to my amazement there were nine
eggs at the bottom (a tenth egg had been laid in the flight) ; one of
the eggs was cracked so it was removed.
The box was replaced and in about an hour she returned to the
nest and the next day, 5th June, we heard a very faint chirping ;
as the days went by the chirpings became very much louder. They
were fed on canary, panicum, millet, wild seeds, seeding grasses,

soaked millet spray, and dry millet spray, chickweed, hemp, and
sunflower, quite a varied diet I think.
About three weeks later I could not resist trying to find out how
many chicks there were, so I put my hand in the nest and could
distinctly feel six heads.
The 1 st chick came out at thirty days, the 2nd one the next day,
three days went by and nos. 3, 4, 5 came out the three following days,
and the last chick joined his mates on 15th July. They are fine healthy
chicks all feet perfect and beautifully feathered, with the back and upper
chest olive green, lower abdomen yellow, blue wing tips, and a faint
blue band over the beak, tail feathers yellow and blue. They are all
feeding themselves, but the baby likes father to feed him sometimes.
The adult birds certainly have been wonderful parents, so patient and
no quarrels whatever.

By Dr. J. Nicolai (Seewiesen, Upper Bavaria, Germany)
During the summer of 1959 it was exceptionally hot in north and
central Germany, and in the Alps and Upper Bavaria alternated from
warm summer weather to cold spells and rain. The Max-Planck
Institute, Seewiesen is by a forest lake 700 m. high in the Lower Alps
and here every period of bad weather was followed by a sharp drop in
temperature. In May, and also in June and July, we had periods of
ten to fourteen days of continual rain with such intense cold that the
work-rooms and living-rooms of the Institute, and also the inside
compartments of the aviaries, had to be heated. This changeable
weather very seriously affected the breeding urge and breeding results
of all delicate species of birds. Many pairs such as the Cape Canary,
Brown-rumped Seed-eater (Poliospiza tristriata), wild Canary, Chinese
Greenfinch, Purple Finch, Red-hooded Siskin and Chinese
Rubythroat made no attempt to breed. A pair of Rufous-bellied
Niltavas twice made an almost complete nest in a crevice, but on both
occasions were diverted from their purpose by a sudden drop in
temperature and did not lay eggs. A pair of Black-cheeked Waxbills
and one of the two pairs of Violet-eared Waxbills also behaved in the
same way. As his mate took no interest in the nest the cock of the
latter pair took possession of the nest of a Golden-breasted Waxbill
and brooded the eggs for several days in spite of the protests of the
rightful owner.

l6o J. NICOLAI-SOME NOTES ON MY BIRDS, SUMMER, 1 959
My old pair of Indian White-Eyes nested, as in the previous year,
and had an infertile clutch which they ardently brooded. The female of
this pair was imported early in the spring of 1954 and is already too old
for successful breeding. Yellow-rumped Seed-eaters, Mexican Siskins
and Alario Finches also produced several infertile clutches.
But in spite of these disasters, which in the main were due to the
changeable weather, I can nevertheless also report a number of
successes. Three pairs of Galapagos Doves hatched twenty-three young,
twenty of which were reared. My old pair of Mourning Doves, which
had five young in the year 1957-58, hatched eleven young last year
all of which grew into beautiful birds. Further breeding successes
were : twenty-six Diamond Doves, two Bourke's Parrakeets, ten
Painted Quail, two St Helena Seed-eaters, one Black-headed Siskin,
four Parson Finches, four Fire Finches and five Striated Finches.
My colony of Sociable Weavers ( Philetairus socius) , which reared their
first young in December, 1958, doubled in numbers in the spring,
when fifteen further young birds were reared by seven pairs.
Late in October a pair of Eritrea Seed-eaters ( Ochrospiza atrogularis
xanthopygius) in the outside aviary bred and brought up two young.
On account of the cold weather, shortly before they flew, they were
placed with their parents in a heated bird-room, where they were still
fed till they reached independence. This little grey, yellow-bellied
Seed-eater, which was first imported into Germany in December, 1958,
is so very distinct in voice and behaviour from the two sub-species
(,atrogularis and deserti) of the Angola Seed-eater ( Ochrospiza atrogularis)
which I have kept for years, that they are unquestionably not sub-
species but represent " good 55 species of their own.
The summer of 1959 was the fifth for a free-flying Shama hen.
From April to November the bird flew out of an open window on the
first floor, over the balcony and into the open where it particularly
liked to stay in a nearby group of bushes. Several times a day it
returned to its cage in the room to eat fresh ants' pupae which always
remained the greatest tit-bit, which is the case with all my free-flying
Shamas, in spite of the wide choice of food outside. Although through
these years the hen was always accompanied by a male, which sang
and displayed with great intensity--she was not the slightest interested
in the nest-box indicated by him so no laying or even nest-building
resulted. Some years ago I repeatedly reared Shamas in a cage
1 metre long.
Some new acquisitions to my bird collection are Green-backed
Twinspot. ( Mandingoa nitidula schlegeli ), Mongolian Lark, two pairs of
Crested Bronze-winged Pigeons, a pair of Nicobar Pigeons as well as
two cocks of the Grey-headed Quail Dove ( Geotrygon caniceps) from
Cuba. The last named were offered to me as a pair, but soon proved
to be two cocks, which ceaselessly displayed and reciprocally mated.

(Pytilia phoenicoptera emini)
By Sir Richard Cotterell, Bt. (Hereford, England)
I had always wished to keep and breed this attractive little bird,
also known as the Crimson-winged Waxbill or Pytilia , but the oppor-
tunity did not arise until last year--1959,
It seems to have all the qualities which make it highly desirable as
an aviary bird. It is beautiful to look at ; it is easy to feed ; it appears
to be a free breeder ; it can become quite tame, and last, but not least,
when acclimatized it is hardy.
Description .--Adult male, general colour dark grey ; outer edges of
flight feathers, upper wing-coverts, lower rump, upper tail-coverts,
central tail feathers and outer edges of rest of tail feathers crimson ;
breast to under tail-coverts barred with white ; eye red ; bill black.
The female is browner above and below, and the crimson on the wings
and tail-coverts not quite so bright. Wing 56-59 mm.
There is another race P. p. lineata from Abyssinia which differs in
having the eye brown and the bill red.
Range .--The semi arid belt from Senegal to Northern Nigeria and
eastwards to the valley of the Upper White Nile, Bahr el Ghazal, and
Uganda. Roughly speaking between 5 degrees and 15 degrees north
of the Equator.
Habits .--Little has been written about this bird's wild life. It does
not appear ever to be found in large flocks, but usually singly or in
pairs. It frequents open woodland, orchard bush, and park land and is
considered to be more arboreal in its habits than most other Waxbills.
Dr. W. Serle records finding nests in Northern Nigeria in November,
December, and February---the dry season. In all cases the nests were
within easy reach of the ground, were globular in shape and made of
grass tops, lined with feathers.
I obtained a pair of Auroras about the middle of April, 1959.
One was an obvious male in adult plumage, the other was an immature
bird and of doubtful sex. They were placed in a large flight cage with
three pairs of Ethiopian Cordon-Bleus with whom they agreed very
well. Panicum millet formed their staple diet, though they also ate
considerable quantities of small Turkish canary seed :--they appeared
to take no interest in white millet. They soon took to mealworms, of
which they had a few per day, and in fact became almost finger tame.

The cock bird frequently burst into song--if it can be called a song !
Although delivered with great enthusiasm it resembled more the
guttural creakings of some small unoiled machine. To my dismay the
other bird also began to sing and I thought, therefore, that it also
must be a cock. This, however, proved not to be so. It therefore
appears that both sexes can sing.
They remained in the flight-cage until my new aviaries were ready
early in June, by which time the hen had completely moulted into
adult plumage. There is no difficulty in sexing adult birds if they can
be seen together. Whereas the cock is a bright pearly-grey with no
trace of brown, the hen is a brownish-grey and the crimson on the
wings and tail-coverts is slightly less bright than the cock.
On 13th June, in company with a pair of Dufresne's Waxbills, they
were turned into one of the new breeding aviaries, the dimensions of
which are as follows :--
Shelter house--6 feet long, 4 feet wide, 6 feet 6 inches high, attached
to a planted outside flight of the same width and height but 12 feet
long.
The shelter was fitted up with many twiggy branches and half a
dozen wicker finch nests. They were shut in the shelter for two days
before being allowed to find their way into the outside flight via the
hatch.
On 23rd June, I found the cock building between some twigs
against the roof of the shelter, and under the nest on the floor was one
egg and another broken one.
On 27th June, the nest was completed, contained eggs, and the
birds began sitting alternately. The nest was built entirely of grass
stems and was a rotten little affair ; I could almost see through the
bottom of it and it looked incapable of supporting the weight of the
parent bird, let alone any young ones.
On 10th July, I took a chance and put my finger in the nest, and felt
young ones. I immediately began feeding meadow-ant cocoons on the
ground in the open flight. They were taken avidly by the parents and,
in fact, they became quite tame and picked them up all round my feet.
Up to 17th July, one parent was in the nest the whole time. On this
day both parents were sitting outside, and I thought they must have
deserted. I resisted the temptation of looking in the nest for another
four days, then by means of a small mirror, I saw one young one which
appeared to be alive.
On 27th July no sign of life came from the nest so I felt inside and
found it empty. I then rather inadvisably pulled it down and found
nothing except a piece of twisted up cellophane I (I understand
that some waxbills do use pieces of old snake skin in their nest--had
they mistaken the cellophane for this ?) I, therefore, looked inside and
out, and eventually found one young bird crouching on the ground of

<bodyText confidence="0.998077888888889" page_id="56315385"  page_num="163" year="" vol="">
the flight, and I immediately caught it up and put it in the shelter.
The young bird was about half the size of the adults, mousey-brown
on the back and lighter underneath with no trace of barring ; the tail
very short and carried rather high like our English Wren : the crimson
of the adult is replaced by rusty-red ; two conspicuous white nodules at
the base of the beak, and eyes black.
The young bird soon found its way into the flight again and nine
days after leaving the nest, although still being fed by its parents, was
beginning to pick up ants' cocoons on its own.
The same day I noticed that the cock was building again in one
of the wicker nest-baskets. I threw in a handful of pigeon feathers to
assist. Within two days these had all disappeared and the cock flew
out of the nest--incubation having started. The young hatched
fourteen days later.
Owing to the dry summer and the tiresome life cycle of the meadow-
ant, it became impossible to continue to collect sufficient cocoons.
I, therefore, tried them with grasshoppers, but I soon abandoned the
hot pursuit of the individual grasshoppers as being unsuitable to my
dignity and temper, and fell back on the homely mealworm. Two
young left the nest eighteen and twenty-one days after hatching.
Within another nine days the hen was sitting on three eggs in another
nest ; two young left the nest thirty-four days later.
Eleven days later, 5th November, the old birds were sitting on eggs
again, but nothing came of this nest.
To revert to the young birds, they all began moulting into their
adult plumage one month after leaving the nest, and in the case of the
first two broods, this moult was completed in a month. Of the last
brood (fledged 24th October) one died and the other was still in moult
at the beginning of March, i960--the slowness no doubt due to the
cold weather.
Owing to the difficulty of knowing for certain when the young were
self-supporting, and the fear of disturbing the old birds on their nest,.
I never removed any of the young from the breeding aviary at all.
They all seemed to get on very well and there was no bullying.
By 20th December I had got some heating installed in a shelter of a
large aviary and so I transferred the whole Aurora clan there together
with all other breeding waxbills, trusting that lack of privacy would
stop them breeding and the old birds would get some rest.
In conclusion, I would like to mention some miscellaneous points
about Auroras which may not be clear from the narrative. Also, this
paragraph is added some months after writing the original, so a little
further information is available. It must be emphasized, however,
that this is written from a limited experience of keeping this species
for little over one year.
Auroras appear to " keep themselves to themselves " and I have

never seen them show any aggressive signs to weaker or smaller species.
In fact, this year (i960), a pair were forced to abandon their young,
as a pair of Dufresne's Waxbills decided to make their nest against the
Auroras' basket, and " saw them off" whenever they approached.
As regards food, it would seem that live insect food is a necessity
when rearing young. Undoubtedly they do not rear their young
wholly on live food, but on regurgitated seed as well. The amount of
mealworms given, about six morning and evening, would not be
sufficient in itself. But they must have some live food. This is borne out
in the case of another pair which went to nest after the ant cocoon
season, and who would not take mealworms, and thus failed to rear
two nests. It would be a good thing to train the birds to take mealworms
before putting them up to breed so that there is something to fall back
on if other insect food fails--gentles would probably do just as well--if
not better, but they are so unpleasant to handle.
Nesting .--After the nest has been begun, it seems that nest building
and laying go on concurrently. I suspect that the normal clutch is
about four eggs--white like all waxbills. The cock and hen definitely
incubate alternately, the incubation period is fourteen days and the
young leave the nest approximately eighteen days after hatching.
As all members of the Estrildinae, they do not attempt to keep the nest
free of droppings. My birds invariably went to nest again about
ten days after the young had fledged, and appeared to do this ad in-
finitum ,--whether this perpetual motion is kept up in the wild state
I do not know.
This year so far (August, i960), in spite of numerous nests, I have
not succeeded in rearing any young. This may be due to not feeding
ant cocoons, or to the exceptionally favourable summer last year for
breeding a " dry weather " bird.
Finally, I think perhaps I was a little too optimistic in my opinion of
the Aurora Finchs' hardiness. During the winter the temperature in
the aviary shelter did not go below 45 0 Fahrenheit, and with one
exception they all survived, although in the coldest and wettest time
they did not look too happy. The heroine of our narrative died in
February when I was away--this may have been due to exhaustion
caused by her breeding activities during the previous six months, or to
egg binding (to which they are very prone in the cold weather), in an
effort to continue to raise a race of home-bred Auroras.

(Anas formosa)
By John Wilcogk (Derby, England)
This lovely little duck is hardy, a " good doer ", and yet as we all
know, the records of successful breeding results are very few. Delacour
writes " Next to the Brant, it is the waterfowl that is the least inclined
to lay in confinement, even on large lakes. It would be interesting to
find out the cause of such an inhibition ".
Last year I obtained a pair. Early in May there was a change from
their rather quiet and retiring disposition ; the drake became voci-
ferous, particularly in the evening, calling regularly, " ot, ot," with
bobbing up and down of the head, which the duck acknowledged also
with a slight bobbing of the head. Every evening they became very
restless. I noted they would both stand with neck outstretched looking
skywards, the drake behind the duck, she making little flicks with her
wings, sometimes slightly crouching, exactly like a bird scenting
danger, and making ready to fly off. Actual attempts at flying were
soon regularly made, generally from the bank of a small island, only
of course to fall into the water. The pair would then swim across to
the bank of the pond, run quickly anything up to 30 yards into the
field, then more sky-gazing, another attempt at flight, and race back
to the pond. This was never observed during the daytime, but was
the regular evening performance from about an hour before dusk
until well into the darkness. It continued from early May until
mid-June. Towards the end of May coition took place. There was no
solicitation attitude by the duck prior to this, who seemed completely
passive, and no egg was laid.
Little seems to be known of the breeding biology in the wild, but
it would seem that one thing is clear, with the most rudimentary
display on the water, these birds are possessed of a strong and persistent
urge to nuptial flighting in the evening. Examples of this aerial
display are of course common over a wide range of birds in the spring,
the song flights of Skylark and Tree-Pipit, the drumming Snipe, the
roding Woodcock, the fluttering butterfly flight of Dunlin, and the
Nightjar, with the smacking of wings over the back. Hudson, in his
Birds of La Plata , describes the soaring of the Crested Screamer, and
the whistling communal flights of the Chiloe Wigeon. These flights
are not just a matter of joie de vivre alone. They are, of course, a link
in the chain leading to the climax of the breeding cycle, and are the
means of co-ordinating the organic rhythms of the pair. With the pair
under observation, the drake had reached the stage of being ready to
pair but, without the stimulation of the aerial chase, the duck had not.

Individual ducks which have bred despite the lack, through pinioning,
of the nuptial display have been sufficiently highly sexed to jump the
gap, so to speak, and it is to such and their progeny that we must look
for a captive-bred race or strain of Anas formosa if we are to get one.
To sum up, many birds, over a wide range of families, require a
period of nuptial flight or aerial display in the spring, in order to
co-ordinate the breeding rhythm of the pair and bring the female to
the physiological condition of successful ovulation. Close observation
almost every evening convinced me that when more is known of the
Baikal Teal, it will be found to be such a bird. Pinioning frustrates
this, therefore there are no eggs.

BREEDING OF THE REDWING
(Turdus musicus)
By H. Murray (Brentwood, Essex, England)
I obtained my pair of Redwings seven or eight years ago, and they

have lived in my large flight ever since. Their condition has always
been perfect and their food consisted of maggots, mealworms, and
whatever they could find to eat in the aviary. Soft food of any sort was
ignored and I never saw them eat fruit.
Every spring up to last year they played at nesting, but never made
a serious attempt to breed, nor, as far as I know, was an egg ever laid.
Last year their habits suddenly changed and they built a nest, laid,
incubated, and reared their young to about a week old, then something
threw them out of the nest. There were a large number of other
birds with them, but I suspect that it was the cock bird that did the
damage. Three times this happened.
I know perfectly well that I should have removed the cock and left
the hen to rear, but I have never reared a worthwhile bird by this
method, and I have often known the cock to cease his misbehaving and
to settle down properly.
This year I again took a chance and left the cock bird with the hen
and they reared one very nice youngster. When sitting, the hen is a
devoted mother and broods the youngsters nearly all the time, even
when the temperature is very high and the youngsters are obviously
suffering from the heat. In the first few days the cock seems to do all
the feeding and the hen hardly stirs.
The nest is a typical thrush's nest, built of dry grass and roughly
lined with mud. The eggs are rather similar to the egg of a Blackbird.
Once the bird starts to build, the work progresses very rapidly and the
nest is built in a day. Usually four eggs are laid.
The young were fed on maggots and mealworms, but earthworms

were not much used. However, the parents were constantly searching
and obviously the young are largely fed on some food that I could not
provide.
This year the birds did not start to nest until July and the eggs took
two weeks to hatch.
The plumage of the young is more speckled than in a Song Thrush
and the white eye streak is clearly marked. The patches of reddish
colour on the sides of the breast are also clearly visible.

THE BREEDING OF THE BLUE-HEADED
ROCK THRUSH
(Monticola cinchoryncha (Vigors))

By Mrs. K. M. Sgamell. (Newdigate, Surrey, England)
The Avicultural Magazine of October, 1913, published an
article by the Rev. H. D. Astley on this beautiful Rock Thrush and
illustrated it with a coloured print from a painting by H. Goodchild,
which depicts the cock displaying to the hen. The Rev. Astley then
possessed two males and one female, unfortunately losing the latter a
few months later.
According to Salim Ali, in Indian Hill Birds , Blue-headed Rock
Thrushes breed throughout the Himalayas between 4,000 and 9,000
feet elevations. In winter the species is stated to visit all India--both
plains and hills--and west to Central Burma. It is said to frequent
openly forested hillsides in summer, and in winter broken and stony
ground and hillsides with light deciduous forest. It is seldom found
amongst dense evergreens. No mention of the bird is made in the
May 1935 edition of the Popular Handbook of Indian Birds (H. Whistler)
but in Breeding Birds of Kashmir (R. S. P. Bates and E. H. N. Lowther)
they are described as a not uncommon species of pine woods and mixed
forests mainly from 6,000 to 9,000 feet, but never found in open country.
From this we can see that Blue-headed Rock Thrushes are hardy
though I have never attempted to winter them outside, preferring to
cage our pair separately in a birdhouse with a minimum temperature
of 50* F.
These birds are imported only occasionally, the cock much more

frequently than the hen--this is understandable when one considers
the great differences between the sexes, the male having a bright blue
head, chin and throat, with the back and tail deep blue. The mantle,
rump and front are chestnut. A very conspicuous white patch midway
across each wing is visible at all times. The female is mainly brown
above, whitish below, with the underparts scaled as each light feather
is tipped dark brown. The first cock of this species I recall seeing
was shown by Mr. Dulanty at the 1949 National when it was placed
second to his own Superb Spreo Starlings.
In January 1958 we purchased a young cock and in the spring-
turned it out in a large planted aviary with a mixed collection of
seedeaters and larger softbills. Early in 1959 we were fortunate in
obtaining a hen, and in May 1959 both birds were placed in a small
planted aviary about 9 feet long by 3 feet wide and 6 feet high, fitted
with a small shelter high up at one end but terminating 3 feet from
the ground. A number of large rocks were placed on the turf which
later sprouted quite a few ferns. Like most of our aviaries, this one
was in a small wood of silver birch and overgrown cob-nut, but the
dry hot summer did not seem to suit the birds who made no attempt to
breed until September, when the cock was observed displaying and
carrying leaves. The hen was very rough and wild, the cock quite tame.
After moulting we showed the pair at the December 1959 National in
the same cage. The pair were placed first in their class but throughout
the show the hen seemed nervous of the cock, and when my husband
was feeding the birds on the second day of the show it escaped through
a feed hole and spent the next 30 hours flying about Olympia. How-
ever, it never strayed very far from its mate, and after many attempts
to catch it by many people with nets, it was finally caught by hand by
Raymond Sawyer just before the show closed, and returned to me
minus its tail but none the worse for its escapade ! It is amazing what
attraction an escaped bird at Olympia had to visitors, many of whom
spent more time gazing upwards at our hen than they spent viewing
the exhibition !
After this we caged the pair separately until late April i960, when
we turned the hen out in the same aviary as the previous year but this
time with a pair of Himalayan Goldfinches and a pair of Red-crested
Finches. Three half-open fronted nest boxes were placed high up
about the small aviary and one half-open fronted box facing south, but
under the overhang of the small shelter referred to above. We placed
the cock in the aviary a week later and much less sparring took place
this year, with the hen holding its own much better and getting a fair
share of the twice daily distribution of mealworms. Leaf carrying
and displaying by the cock started in a few weeks, the hen choosing
the nest box beneath the overhang of the shelter. One could just see
her head during incubation, which she carried out alone.

K. M. SCAMELL-BREEDING THE BLUE-HEADED ROCK THRUSH 1 69
We did not examine the eggs--nor did we find any egg-shells--the
hen sat very closely and was rarely seen off the nest. We think she
laid about 15th June. On the morning of 2nd July both the cock and
hen were flying about in an excited manner and all live food, i.e. a
normally adequate supply of gentles, given late the previous evening,
had disappeared. A quick check of the nest (our first) showed there
were three youngsters, possibly two days old. The nest was cup shaped
and at one end of the nest box. Throughout the next two days I fed
mealworms at two-hourly intervals, plus fresh ant eggs in addition to
the usual gentles and soft food. On Mr. K. Norris's advice I fed
mealworms ad lib. from the evening of 3rd July until the young left
the nest in a thunderstorm on Thursday afternoon, 14th July. I also
added chopped hard boiled egg to the soft food. Though I returned
the young to the nest as fast as they came out, they were soaking wet
and covered in mud. One stayed put and left the nest for good the next
day, but two spent the night in the flight. A few buckets of granulated
peat dried up conditions somewhat but the continual downpours
throughout July caused considerable anxiety.
Late on the 14th July I found the cock Himalayan Goldfinch
decapitated. The pair of Red-crested Finches which are highly
insectivorous and the surviving hen Goldfinch were always the first
to feed when the supplies of live food were replenished but, as far as we
could see, these three birds were never interfered with by the Rock
Thrushes at any time.
Of the three young, two are hens and the third was definitely
a cock. The two young hens are paler editions of the mother, dull
brown wings but with the head and back speckled and the extensive
speckled lighter parts underneath a dull fawnish-white rather than
the distinctive light colour the parent carries. The young cock,
however, showed blue wings and the tip of his short tail also blue, and
the rump chestnut. The remainder of the bird was speckled and barred
like the hens but much darker and with the lighter parts distinctly
fawny. On the third day after leaving the nest, the young cock started
to show the white patches on the wings.
Both parents fed the gaping youngsters--sometimes one would see
the cock with a bill full of mealworms or gentles, in fact a row of them,
ready to thrust down a waiting throat. The mealworm consumption
at its peak, which was just before the youngsters left the nest, reached
about 3 oz. a day and for the next fortnight did not fall below 2 oz.
a day. On the 26th and 27th July both young hens were observed taking
mealworms from the parent cock's bill and one accepted a mealworm
from my fingers. The male parent seemed to take the larger part in
feeding the birds but as the hen has always been shy, she may not have
fed so freely in my presence. The young cock was not progressing as
well as its sisters, who were now flying strongly. It was smaller and

seemed weak and neglected and on the afternoon of the 27th July,
after an exceptionally heavy downpour, I picked it up in a puddle.
It was dead--whether drowned or starved I could not say. On the
28th July the two young hens were observed picking up mealworms
from the floor. The male parent was seen scattering mealworms and
gentles on the ground. At this point I started to cut up the mealworms
and mix thoroughly with the soft food. Throughout the rearing
period I fed fresh ant eggs whenever I could get a supply, which involved
lifting all the paving slabs on our garden paths and scooping up the
ant eggs with a teaspoon ! Fresh ant eggs had also to be supplied to
two other softbill families which overlapped this breeding. The
soft food consumption rose as I reduced the mealworm supply on
2nd August. From now on, rearing was uneventful, the two young
gradually fending for themselves until on Saturday, 13th August, I
was satisfied they could feed themselves. I then caught them up and
caged them together, but one hen seemed stronger and in better
condition than the other, so I separated them and today, 22nd August,
they are both fit and eating well--soft food, gentles, plus four meal-
worms each, twice daily. They are almost as large as their mother
but still duller in the lighter parts. The parents have started to moult
--the hen looked very bedraggled during the later stages of the feeding
but is now in better condition.

We first kept this species about three years ago at the same time as
we bred the Chestnut-and-Black Warbling Finch, which was also a first
breeding in this country. The pair of Pretty Warbling Finches we
then had went to nest, building a small cup-shaped nest in a tangle of
branches and Old Man's Beard which we had fixed up in a corner of
the flight under overhead cover. Unfortunately they, like all the
Warbling Finches, are inclined to be spiteful, and the cock would
chivvy the hen whenever she came off the nest and eventually killed
her before the eggs hatched. At first we were not sure whether we had
a pair as both birds seemed to be identical. But in our present pair
the hen is of a distinctly paler chestnut than the cock, though otherwise
they are alike.
The cock is deep chestnut on the breast, paler on the back, and with
a strong white stripe through the eye, and white bars across the wings.
This somehow reminds one of the English Chaffinch and they also
resemble the latter in body shape and flight, but are much smaller.
Their eggs are white spotted with fine black dots, mostly on the large
end. Our present hen we managed to procure from another source
and we were told that she had nested before, but had let the young die
in the nest. We mated her to a fine, brightly coloured cock which
arrived at about the same time in a consignment of other birds from
the Continent.
We kept them over the winter and gave them a small aviary to
themselves in the spring. The hen went straight to nest and built in
the same sort of thicket as we had provided before. She hatched and
reared one youngster in the first round, and as it jumped out of the
nest very early before being able to fly, we put it in the shelter, where
it was dryer. At first we thought it had been disturbed, but apparently
since the two young of the second nest have done the same thing, this
would appear to be the usual procedure with this species.
The first young one is now self-supporting and thriving and has been
taken away from its parents, and the other two are also flourishing
and just beginning to fly. The young differ a little from the adults,
being greyish-brown and having the breast pale fawn-grey marked with
thrush-like striations. The latter, however, very soon disappear and
the young one of the first round already has the breast mainly chestnut.
The normal diet of the Warbling Finches includes seed, but the
young were reared entirely, as far as we could see, on live food
consisting of gentles and a few mealworms daily.

By T. F. Nixon (Wisbech, Cambridgeshire, England)
Owing to a May holiday and other factors, I cannot give a very
detailed account of the breeding of the African Ring-necked (.Psittacula
krameri krameri ).
I bought the pair in 1957 from a dealer for the paradoxical reason
they looked in such a pitiful condition, their flight and tail feathers
had been hacked off almost to a degree of permanent mutilation, and
were very dirty ; it took two years before they regained their full
plumage. Not until this year did they go near the nest-box (about
24 by 10 by 10 inches) standing on a 4-foot post, with some 4 inches
of granulated peat in the bottom.
Early this spring they started to chew the roof of the box, although
I never saw them near it. One day at the beginning of April, the hen
came out of the nest-box when I opened the flight door to feed them,
but she did not go back while I watched, she usually came out when
anyone approached the run. I believe she came off the nest most
evenings. The cock always spent the night with the hen, entering the
nest-box about an hour before sunset, after which no amount of noise
seemed to distract them.
Before going on holiday at the beginning of May, I decided to open
the box when the hen was off, to see if any eggs had been laid ; to my
intense surprise there were three strong chicks, one dead badly needing
removal, and one clear egg.
Up to now the parents had only accepted sunflower and canary
seed, no fruit or green stuff would they look at. I believe they lived

solely on sunflower and only touched canary when the former had been
cleared up. I immediately offered them a mixed diet, but they would
only take one sweet apple a day and plenty of sunflower seed.
The first youngsters came out about the first week in June and the
other two at four- to five-day intervals, nearly as large as their parents
except there were no tail feathers ; these grew fairly rapidly once they
were flying.
The most noticeable feature is the beak, on leaving the nest it was
a very pale coral pink which turned to bright red and is now slowly
developing into the characteristic blackish red.
Since the young left the nest, the parents have returned to their
usual perch under a small shelter and the hen is very unfriendly to the
cock, which was not so before the family arrived.
In the photograph the three young are on the perch with the parents
on the partition, the different ages of the youngsters can be distinguished
by the shade of their beaks.

These notes are based on the behaviour of only a few captive
individuals. I think, however, that they may be of interest, since such
other accounts of the behaviour of these species that I have seen have
been based on equally, or even more, limited material. The best and
most recent paper on the ethology of these and some other estrildines
that I have read is that of Kunkel (1959). I shall therefore give
special emphasis to points not dealt with by him or where our observa-
tions do not completely tally. It is to be hoped, though in view of the
political situation hardly to be expected, that behaviour studies of these
and other estrildines in the wild will soon be undertaken to complement
observations on captive birds.
The Avadavat, Tiger Finch, Strawberry Finch, or Red Waxbill
(.Amandava amandava ) is found in India and parts of south-east Asia,
normally in damp areas with reeds, tall grasses or similar cover. It
is probably familiar to most readers since it is commonly on sale,
often under deplorable conditions, especially where the birds are
intended rather to draw customers for other goods to the establishment
(such as shops whose main trade is dog food and budgie seed and the
" pet departments " of some large stores) than to be profitably sold
themselves. I will, however, describe it for the benefit of anyone who
does not know it. It is a little bird, about the size of a Wren and
differs from all other estrildines in having a breeding and a non-
breeding plumage. In the former the male is coppery red to bright
crimson red (there is some geographical and individual variation)
with blackish ventral regions, dark brown wings and tail and reddish
brown crown and back. Glistening white spots on his lower breast,
flanks, wings and rump add to his beauty. The female is dark brown,
paler beneath, inclining to golden-yellow on the belly, with some red
on the rump and upper tail coverts and white spots on the wings. In
non-breeding dress the male resembles her but the red on his rump is
always brighter and more extensive. The young are much like the
female but have no red on the rump and instead of white spots they
have buff edges to their wing coverts which form buff bars across the
folded wing.
There are three races of this bird, the Indian or " Bombay Avadavat "
{Amandava a. amandava ), the smaller and usually brighter and less
heavily spotted Amandava a. punicea from Indo China and Java,
to which some (but, be warned ! not all) dealers restrict the name
" Strawberry Finch ", and the very beautiful Golden-bellied Avadavat

gives a detailed account of all these races and their distribution,
although his descriptions and the accompanying colour plate rather over-
emphasise, in my opinion, the differences between amandava and punicea.
When kept in cages, particularly when they are closely confined
and fed only on seed, Avadavats lose their red colour, which is either
replaced by a coppery yellow-brown or else the birds become more
or less black all over. One of our members (Davis, 1939) found that,
at least in India, exposure to sunshine, heat and moisture caused the
red colour to be retained even when the birds were fed only on dry
seed. But I think anyone would be ill-advised to hope for good colour
or good health in Avadavats on such a spartan diet in our less (to them)
favourable climate. When kept in a large outdoor aviary my old cock
bird moulted into a slightly duller and more coppery red than his
vivid wild plumage. His son, bred and kept indoors (see further on for
details) moulted into coppery orange-red with vivid fire-orange on the
rump different from, but almost as beautiful, as the colours of a wild
bird. The old cock, now (20th August i960) half through his moult,
is coming into the same colour as his offspring.
The Golden-breasted Waxbill or Zebra Waxbill (. Amandava , formerly
Estrilda, subflava) is now placed in the genus Amandava together with
the Avadavat and the Green Munia, Green Avadavat or Green
Waxbill {Amandava, formerly Stictospiza, formosa). Delacour gives
Amandava only subgeneric rank (Delacour, 1943) within his enlarged
conception of the genus Estrilda , a decision which seems to have much
to recommend it but has not been followed by later classifiers. The
Gold-breast and the Avadavat are almost certainly fairly closely
related although both Kunkel and I are of the opinion that they are
probably less closely akin to one another than are the blue waxbills,
typical waxbills and firefinches, which are usually put in separate
genera from each other even by those who put the Gold-breast and
Avadavat together in Amandava. The Gold-breast is found in tropical
and southern Africa, where it frequents much the same sort of habitat
as does the Avadavat in Asia. It is the smallest of all the African
waxbills and having a rather short tail tends to look even smaller than
it is. The male of the tropical form (A. s. subflava ) is dark olive brown
above (with a faint suggestion of reddish about it, like a colour-fed
Greenfinch) with a red stripe over the eye and red upper tail-coverts.
His throat, breast and underparts are mainly golden and orange, the
central part of the breast being rich orange-red and the flanks barred
with dark olive. The under tail-coverts are a vivid red-orange. The
female lacks the red eye stripe and has a pale yellowish or greyish-
yellow breast and belly. The southern form (A. subflava clarkei) is
very slightly larger and less brilliant, the male's underparts (except

for the orange-red under tail-coverts) being golden yellow with a
touch of orange on the central part of the breast in many, but not all
specimens. A male of this form that I have had since November 1958
is as bright as he was in importation plumage, but his upper tail-coverts
and eye-stripe are now red-orange, not red, and his under tail-coverts are
golden-orange rather than red-orange. This is compensated for,
however, by the now purer and greener tone of olive-brown of his
upperparts. This species may, however, go black in captivity, like
the Avadavat, only it then retains the red and orange parts of its
plumage and gives the impression of some odd new species.
The juvenile Gold-breasts and Avadavats are remarkably similar.
Both are sober little olive-brown birds with paler underparts and
near-white throats. The rather browner, less olivaceous, colour of
the young Avadavats, their conspicuous buff wing bars (young Gold-
breasts have only a suggestion of wing bars), and the difference in the
begging calls are the quickest means of telling which is which.
Individuals Studied and their Conditions
The birds are kept in a small but very well-lighted room (see
Goodwin, 1959 for fuller details). In the darker months of the year
the electric light is turned on some time between 3 a.m. and 6 a.m. and
left on till 8 a.m. On dull mornings in summer or on any dull day when
I am at home (usually only week-ends) the light is put on. A letter-box
sized "Judas-hole " is cut in the door so that I can observe the birds
unperceived by them. At least this was the idea but, as will be narrated,
the birds are not now so naive about this as they once were.
Two pairs of Avadavats (Amandava amandava punicea) and two pairs
of Golden-breasted Waxbills (A. subflava clarkei) were purchased from
Mr. Trevor Crewes in October 1958, together with some Blue-breasts
and a pair of Diamond Doves. I had not then thought of cutting an
observation hole in the door and feared I should get little aesthetic or
scientific enjoyment from my new purchases, since when I went into the
room the Avadavats and the Gold-breasts would fly about in circles,
bumping against the ceiling and only perching momentarily in
exhaustion. Although now tamer they still usually panic in this
manner if I, unthinkingly, look at them when in the room instead of
keeping my eyes discreetly down-cast, like the heroine in some
medieval morality tale. No doubt the reason for this wildness is because
in a natural state these species would, when disturbed, fly some little
way and then drop again into grass, reeds or other low cover. This
was, at any rate, the behaviour of a number of Avadavats that lived
wild all one summer about Perry Oaks Sewage Farm, near London
Airport, whence they had, no doubt, escaped. At the time it seemed
best to reduce the number of timid birds in the room, so I gave the
Avadavats to my friend Colin Harrison.

They were kept in a cage indoors that winter, during which one of
the cocks unfortunately died. The surviving cock and two hens were
put into a big outdoor aviary in April, where they remained until late
August 1959, when Colin gave them back to me . I placed them in the
room with the other birds where they settled down at once and soon
went to nest. I put a red ring on one of the females, for identification.
Had this precaution not been taken it would indeed have been difficult
to elucidate the tangled skein of the male's love life. He had paired
with the unringed female, took turns in incubating their eggs and
carried in feathers from time to time in the usual manner of incubating
male estrildines. Most of his " off-duty " time, however, he spent
with Red-ring, behaving then in all respects as if he regarded her as his
mate. This, as may be imagined, did not endear Red-ring to the other
hen, and while the male was incubating there was constant quarrelling
between them, in which the " rightful " wife usually triumphed. At
night the male slept side by side with Red-ring, never once in the
nest as male Avadavats are said normally to do (Kunkel, 1959) during
incubation.
I first heard the calls of the young on 23rd September. For about
a week the male was too full of parental zeal to bother about anything
else and when Red-ring tried to make up to him, as she did about
once in every five minutes of the time he was off the nest, he repulsed
her sharply. This, however, did not stop her importunities, since
most female birds, once they have fallen in love with a particular male,
are, like Buffon's dog, " not driven away by unkindness, but continue
humble, submissive and imploring ", a contrast to the attitude they
sometimes show when the boot is on the other foot. As the young grew
their father favoured first one hen, then the other, but by the time
the first young fledged on 14th October, he had accepted Red-ring and
turned against the mother of his children. Not only did he attack
her when she tried to make up to him, but he even resented her feeding
their young and attacked her fiercely whenever he noticed her doing so.
He continued to feed his young and look after them during this period
in spite of the indifference of his new mate to them. It was of interest
to note how, once his feelings towards her had changed, the fact
that his first mate, like himself, was caring diligently for the young
so far from arousing any sympathy for her, merely infuriated him.
Parallel behaviour is not unknown in other bipeds.
Shortly, however, after a day or two of dithering between them, the
male reinstated the unringed female and began repulsing Red-ring.
Since the former hen had proved herself a good breeder I was not
sorry at this, and gave Red-ring away to a friend who had an odd male
Avadavat for whom he wanted a mate. By 2nd November the pair had
a nest with five eggs, but on the 5th the light failed in the room and the
birds had to be moved out for a day or two, involving, of course, the

destruction of the nest. They were returned to the room on the 7th and
began building again on the 8th. This nest also was ill-fated. On
27th November, I noticed both birds off the nest, looking as miserable
as the people in advertisements do before they are told the cures for
" Tiredness Peaks " and " Night Starvation ". Guessing some disaster
had overtaken the nest I looked and found that it had been pulled
open at one side (by some inquisitive Blue-breast?) and five near-
hatching eggs, smashed but with the wretched young in them still
alive, lay on the floor. The adults nested again after about a week, but
the cock was less enthusiastic in nesting behaviour than before and
also had begun to show one or two brown feathers on his breast. A
single young one, plump but poorly feathered (I think the parents
had brooded it insufficiently) was found dead on the floor on 13th
January. There were no others and no addled eggs in the nest.
The female seemed to want to go to nest again and got very restless
when her mate, now moulting into non-breeding dress, showed no
interest in so doing. She kept pecking at his head, even pulling
feathers out of his head and flanks, but he responded only by sidling
away. She also spent much time flying to and fro and calling loudly.
Early in April the young male, of whom more shortly, began to court
his mother, but she repulsed him. When she did so she frequently
pecked, not at his head, as repulsing Avadavats usually do, but at
the patches of red feathers now visible on his flanks. By 8th May the
old male was also showing a few red feathers and there were four eggs
in the nest in which he and his mate were taking turns at incubation.
These eggs were, however, infertile.
By mid-June the old male had rather more red in his plumage and
there was frequent fighting and chasing between him and his son
Yellow Left, who was now almost two-thirds into red plumage. About
this period both males were also seen to give the wing-fluttering
display to the young female Blue Left. The old pair went to nest
again but I did not record the dates or any details at the time. I first
heard the young on 10th July, but they must have hatched some time
previously to this. On that day I saw only the old male feeding them,
but later both adult female and the young male Yellow Left were seen
feeding the young. The latter's acting as family help did not endear
him to his father, who would fly to and fro uttering his loud, piercing
alarm note when he heard Yellow Left feeding the young and attack
the latter as soon as he emerged from the nest.
When the young Gold-breasts fledged on 17th July, they were
adopted (see under Parental Care for details) by the old pair of
Avadavats and the young male Yellow Left who, apparently, mistook
them for their own young. Doubtless it was with their connivance or
encouragement that the young Gold-breasts all entered the Avadavats'
nest, roosted there that night and stayed there, making only brief

sorties on the surrounding perches, for the next few days. Two young
Avadavats fledged on 22nd July and the three others next day.
The two young reared in the autumn of 1959 were a cock, Yellow
Left, and a hen, Blue Left. During their early days they had been
repulsed by their parents after the latter ceased to feed them. They
were temporarily allowed to associate with them again immediately
after disaster to the nest in late November. Since the Blue-breasted
Waxbills had never shown any parental interest in them it was sur-
prising to find that both Blue Left and Yellow Left were, at times,
considerably attracted to the Blue-breasts. Both would often, in
moments of defeat or frustration, seek out a Blue-breast (usually the
particular male, who was most willing to oblige) and solicit head-
preening from it. Both copied the song of the Blue-breasts (see under
Voice) and Blue Left, but not the male Yellow Left, showed strong
evidence of being sexually attracted by Blue-breasts. If she saw a male
Blue-breast begin his Stem-Display she would at once fly to him, hop
near to him in the Tail-twist posture, regarding him intently with head
turned somewhat towards him and head feathers sleeked down. If, on
such occasions, the other hen Avadavat came near (by chance) Blue
Left, clearly imagining her mother to be a rival for the Blue-breast's
affections, would attack her furiously. Yet she never attempted to
drive off the female Blue-breast that was (in most instances) actually
being displayed to. Whether this was because she could not recognize a
bird of this species as a possible rival, even although she could become
fixated on one as a possible mate, or whether because she felt too much
awe and respect towards all representatives of Urdeginthus angolensis
I do not know. The second seems to me the more likely reason and the
one least unflattering to the Avadavat's mental powers.
The sight of a male Blue-breast about to display with a stem or grass
blade in his bill, still more of one actually " dancing " in the Stem
Display clearly aroused Blue Left's sexual feelings. This seems odd in
view of the different appearance of the displaying Blue-breast (head
and bill holding the nest-material pointing ceilingwards, bouncing up
and down stiffly on his perch) to that of an Avadavat in its homologous
display (bowing deeply with a feather or straw in its bill). It is possible,
however, that, given some degree of social fixation on Blue-breasts, the
latter's more spectacular display might constitute a supra-normal
stimulus for a hen Avadavat. One male Blue-breast, who had been
hatched and reared in the room, but not either of the two wild caught
cocks, showed some reaction to the young hen Avadavat and would
sometimes, if he was holding a stem, start to display if she came near
to him.
The Golden-breasted Waxbills were, I am afraid, rather neglected
with regard to observation for their first year or so with me, as I was
then concentrating on studying the Blue-breasts. Unlike the latter

they did not start to nest for a considerable time. Perhaps this was
because, in the presence of the larger Blue-breasts and the Diamond
Doves and Canaries, which I then had, they did not feel sufficiently at
ease. I think, however, that this species may have a more definite
breeding season, even in the wild, than most other estrildines. It has
a relatively quick moult, like that of some European passerine, which
is in striking contrast to the slow progress of the Blue-breast's moult.
Also I have not seen any breeding behaviour from my Gold-breasts
when they are moulting whereas the Blue-breasts continue courting,
building, laying, hatching and rearing whilst moulting. However,
in late June of i960 both pairs of Gold-breasts nested, although the
eggs did not hatch. I think they may have been infertile. The two
cocks, although fairly peaceful by day, threatened, sparred and
chased each other fiercely at dusk and dawn and every attempt at
mating that I observed in either pair was frustrated by the other male
dashing down and attacking the copulating one.
Early in November of 1959 I caught and ringed a male and a
female, putting a green ring on the left leg of each. It then became
apparent that the male Green Left was paired to the unringed female
and vice versa. The male Green Left died in February, i960. For
the first six weeks or so after his death his widow remained alone, not
attempting (so far as I saw, but she may well have done so and been
repulsed) to cluster with the pair. She did, indeed, usually rest within
a foot or two of them, but that had previously been the habit of her and
her mate when not in breeding condition.
By 20th March all three birds had begun to sit together without any
overt aggression, but the Unringed Female was clearly in a subordinate
position since she allowed herself to be preened by both the male and
his mate Green Left but made no attempt to preen anyone herself. If
Green Left imagined that she could enjoy the luxury of having a mate
and a female subordinate she was, however, soon disillusioned, for by
the first week in April Unringed Female had usurped her place in the
male's affections and both her rival and her fickle ex-husband repulsed
her fiercely when she tried to reinstate herself.
Touched by her plight I went out and bought another cock. By this
time (early April i960) south Africa 1 was no longer (as appeared to be
the case from after the war until 1959) the main exporting country
of African estrildines and so I was able to get a male of the much
brighter and more beautiful tropical race. He had been cage moulted
in a bird shop, was rather pale in colour but still a little brighter than
the brightest wild male of A. s. clarkei , so I imagined he would soon win
the affections of the widow. Alas, I bargained without the intense
personal likes and dislikes of passerine birds. Although the new male
has persistently courted both females and the old male has wavered to

and fro between them, cold-shouldering first one and then the other,
both hens are still (late August i960) deeply enamoured of him and
repulse every advance of the unattached male who constantly woos
them. This sort of behaviour, a bird desperately eager to pair with
another of its species who does not want it whilst remaining utterly
indifferent or actively hostile to the impassioned displays of one who
does want it, is familiar to all aviculturists and a warning against too
mechanistic and " anti-anthropomorphic 55 an interpretation of bird
behaviour. It is often true of the female of other creatures besides
Homo sapiens that " If of herself she will not love, nothing can make
her ".
The original male and both females had shown some signs of breeding
behaviour (looking into nest baskets, toying with feathers) inter-
mittently during the winter and early Spring, but it was not until early
in May that Unringed Female laid. Five young were hatched but all
(to judge from the minute mummified corpses I later found in the nest)
must have died within a day or less, probably from lack of proper food,
as their hatching coincided with a cold, wet spell when small insects
were practically unobtainable. The parents nested again with no
better luck, for the basket they chose had been fixed rather insecurely
and fell down, breaking the four eggs. They soon tried again, however,
and it was a case of third time lucky as four fine young were reared
which are now (20th August i960) about half-way through their
first moult.
All the three (wild caught) male Gold-breasts that I have kept have
often allowed themselves to be preened by a Blue-breasted Waxbill,
whenever one of the latter species has indicated its wish to do so.
Furthermore they have all when, apparently, frustrated or depressed--
as just after getting the worst of a skirmish with a rival or being
repulsed by a female they have been displaying to, deliberately sought
out a Blue-breast and offered their heads to it for preening.
For a long time the hen Gold-breasts appeared too frightened of a
Blue-breast approaching very closely to stay and allow it to preen them.
I often saw one particular male Blue-breast attempt to preen one or
other of the female Gold-breasts (he was just as ready to preen a male,
approaching whichever happened to be nearest) but the latter always
hopped away. One morning last Spring, however, when the pair
of Gold-breasts (Unringed Male and Unringed Female) were sitting
preening each other's heads this male Blue-breast sidled up. The male
Gold-breast had been preening his mate, but he at once erected his head
feathers and submissively lowered his head for the Blue-breast to
preen him. After doing so for a few seconds the Blue-breast leaned right
over him (see sketch) and preened his mate's head. Perhaps at first
she did not realize who was preening her, as she had been in the intense
head-offering posture and probably (as is often the case) had her eyes

sequently this hen Gold-breast has allowed the male Blue-breast to
preen her, though I have not seen her actually seek out a Blue-breast
and solicit head-preening from it as the male Gold-breasts do.
I have seen no evidence of any social rapport between adult Gold-
breasts and adult Avadavats, other than momentary aggression at times
from the latter towards the former. Once a female Gold-breast attacked
two young Avadavats when they attempted to copulate. Even the
four young Gold-breasts (all males) that were reared by and with
Avadavats this year now (30th August) no longer associate with their
former nest mates although they readily allow the aforementioned
cock Blue-breast to preen them.

grass and sprouted millet seed or grass seed with the earth in which
it has been grown are supplied frequently, at least one of these items
each day. Any plants I can find in or near my garden that are infested
with green fly are also given to the birds to pick over. Blackfly they
will not touch. During the warmer months of the year the top layer of
earth from beneath a heap of garden waste is thrown in daily for the
birds to search for small insects, baby centipedes, etc. During the late
Spring and Summer I collect ant larvae and pupae (of the small
yellow-brown ant so common in grassland and the small black ant
common in gardens and some fields) each week-end. Those parts
of the nest (usually just below the surface of the ant-hill on fine after-

bag with layers of grass between each trowelful to lessen mortality by
crushing. This is later spread on the floor of the room and some clods

of earth and clumps of grass placed near. Those " eggs " not at once
eaten are carried beneath the shelter of these by the worker ants. If the
latter are fed with sugar solution and chopped maggots and the
surroundings not allowed to become too dry or too wet the " eggs "
will remain viable and edible until the following week-end, if they
have not been all eaten by then. All that is necessary is to remove the
sheltering grass, etc., and expose them to the birds daily, or several times
daily.
Once a week, rather oftener in winter or when there are young in the
nest, the seed is treated with halibut oil. Sand, mineral mixture (a
little of which is eaten) and crushed, dried eggshell (much of which is
daily eaten) are supplied daily. Millet sprays are also supplied but are
removed on the days when the oil-treated seed is given.
The Avadavats take mostly yellow millet. They are keen on sprouted
millet and also on young growing shoots of grass and some other
seedlings. Of seeding grasses they take several sorts but seem keenest
on the Annual Meadow Grasses Poa pratensis and Poa annua. Like the
Blue-breasts they also like seeding Knot Grass (Polygonum aviculare).
They take insects keenly when they have young, are laying or are
moulting, not often at other times, and the adults always eat dry millet
in quantity even when fresh ant pupae are available. Of insects ant
pupae and larvae, the winged male and female ants (but not the
workers), small caterpillars, very small centipedes, greenfly and gentles
are all taken, usually in about that order of preference. Unlike the
Blue-breasted Waxbills they will take Blow Fly pupae as well as the
maggots. Maggots are mumbled and nibbled in an attempt to break
the tough skin (when will some enterprising person market some
live food really suitable for small birds ?), but more often than not the
attempt is vain and the maggot finally swallowed whole or discarded
intact. Gut-up maggots are sometimes taken and are (unless ant pupae
are available) always supplied when the birds have young, but more
often the Avadavat will choose the more attractive-looking live and
intact maggot in preference to the mutilated corpse.
The feeding preferences of my Gold-breasts are similar to those
of the Avadavats. They show, however, even more zest in searching
fresh earth or compost for (presumably) minute invertebrates, and
I have seen them eat very small earthworms, or what appeared to be
such, as well as " baby " centipedes. They are also particularly fond
of the growing tips of young grass and consume quantities of it when-
ever available. The only time I have seen a Gold-breast attempt to
eat a maggot was when there were young in the nest. Then the mother
(Unringed Female) sometimes tackled small maggots although I only
saw her actually swallow one once. All the others I saw her with were
finally discarded. The Gold-breasts do not seem to care for most
seeding grasses (though very keen on fresh seedling grass shoots) but

eat the seeds of a grass that I have been unable to identify from books.
This grass is very common and has, when ripe or nearly ripe, a silvery-
fawn seed-head about two inches long, with silky, close-packed seeds,
easily detached by pulling the head through one's hand. The small
silvery seeds (smaller and dark brown when dehusked) are eaten by
the Gold-breasts and I think may have played an important part in
the rearing of the young.
I may add that all attempts to get my waxbills to eat" insectivorous
food ", " egg-food ", cooked egg, and bread and milk have utterly
failed. They will readily pick seed off any of these substances but that
is as far as they will go. Writers on bird-feeding usually tell us our
waxbills should eat such foods and that all we have to do is to confine
them with one that already does so and they will copy its good example.
Maybe they will but where does one get their mentor ? Such advice is
as useful as telling a pauper that if he will only invest twenty million
pounds expediently all his financial troubles will be solved. I dare
say there have been waxbills that ate bread and milk, but I have yet to
see one. For some months I kept two hen Canaries with my birds.
These Canaries were, like all their kind, eager to sample anything
new that was, or might conceivably be, edible. They ate fruit, egg,
milk sop, " insectivorous food," mealworms, and much else besides
with as uninhibited a zest as that with which Christians persecute the
" sinful ". But not one Avadavat, Gold-breast or Blue-breast, ever
followed their example.

Mutual preening. *
Avadavats and Gold-breasts habitually preen each other's heads
in the same manner as other estrildines. Further observations have
fully confirmed my previous opinion (Goodwin, 1959) that, in all
species, this involves sublimated (and not always completely sub-
limated !) aggression on the part of the preener and submission on the
part of the preenee.
In both Avadavat and Gold-breast the subordinate, or supplicatory,
of any two birds is even more likely to offer its head as an appeasing
response to actual or threatened aggression than is a Blue-breast in
similar circumstances. Individuals, even when in a mood to have their
head preened, only permit such familiarities from those whom they
regard as their superiors or equals. As an example : on 29th November,
1959, I noticed the adult pair of Avadavats sitting side by side, the
male preening his mate's head. She was in the extreme " head-
offering " posture with bowed head and erected head feathers. The
young male Yellow Left alighted about a foot away on her other side
* For convenience I use this term, although, as explained, the preening is not
mutual if the birds concerned are socially unequal.

and at once noticed this. Either genuinely " thinking 55 that his
mother's attitude towards him had now turned to a proper and
welcome humility, or else simply unable to resist the temptation, he
sidled up and attempted to preen her. She at once snapped out of her
appeasing posture and pecked him fiercely in the face. He hopped

away, blinking and shaking his head as if in pain. Then he sidled back
to the old hen, but this time instead of attempting to preen her he
offered his head to her for preening. She preened him in a very rough
manner for a few seconds, then turned towards her mate (who during
these mother-son exchanges had remained unmoved by her side)
and offered him her head again.
However, although head-preening expresses the dominance (pro-
bably only symbolically and momentarily in the case of mated pairs
and young birds that are friendly with each other) of the preener, it
also shows that its aggressiveness has been sublimated, at least to the
extent that it will not attack or drive away the bird it preens. The way
in which weaker birds, especially when apparently feeling depressed
or socially insecure through having been defeated in a fight, will often
go up to stronger individuals (often to individuals of different and
stronger species, as with my Gold-breasts that go to the Blue-breasts)
and deliberately offer their heads for preening shows, however, that
they derive some satisfaction from being preened.
The preener, in such cases, gives the preenee no help against its
enemy in any future encounter nor does it show any regard for the
weaker bird except such as may be implicit in preening its offered
head instead of attacking it. And this is not much, I think. Presumably
the weaker must, nevertheless, get some sense of comfort, support or
security from simply submitting to this not overtly aggressive expression
of dominance by the stronger. Perhaps it feels, at a simpler level, the
same sort of mental comfort that some humans derive, especially in
times of stress and trouble, from the emotional relationship (which
they believe to be reciprocatory or complementary) existing between
themselves and a sacred crocodile, the One True God, or their
favourite psychiatrist.

Thejood-hegging of the young.
It has long been known (see Kunkel, 1959 for references) that
fledged young Avadavats and Gold-breasted Waxbills differ from other
estrildines, the Green Avadavat excepted, in that they raise their
wings when food-begging. Most writers on the subject seem to think
that these wing movements are not homologous with the usual wing
flapping or fluttering of begging young passerines. However, I am
inclined to doubt this and to think that the differences between the
wing movements of these estrildines and those of other young passerines
has been rather over-emphasised.
If a hungry young Avadavat or Gold-breast is approached by its
parent it crouches, twisting its neck round and opening its bill in the
usual manner of other young estrildines. It also partly opens and/or
makes fluttering movements with its wings, then, as the parent comes
up to it, it raises the far wing. If the parent is not on the same branch the
other wing may be raised to some extent also. If the parent approaches
the young one from directly in front it raises both wings equally high.
The wing(s) may be thrust out obliquely or horizontally rather than
vertically. The near wing may occasionally be extended in spite of
the parent's approach along the same perch, and the latter may trip
over it or perch on it, unintentionally pinning its offspring to the
perch in so doing. If the fledgling is sandwiched tightly between its
brethen sitting on either side of it on the same perch it makes no
perceptible wing movements. Under these last circumstances it does
not seem " obliged " to accompany even the most intense crouching
and neck twisting with any wing movements. The intensity of all
these begging movements depends on the eagerness of the young for
food. A nearly sated young one merely opens its bill without making
any wing movement or attempting to crouch and twist its neck. Every
possible intermediate form between the above described highest and
lowest intensities of food-begging are shown according to the
fledgling's degree of eagerness for food.
The appearance of the young when begging at high intensity is
so suggestive of the fleeing-intention component in the defensive
display of pigeons (see Goodwin, 1956) that I at first thought the
wing raising might indicate a tendency to flee from the parent. Since,
however, it is shown most when the young one is most eager for food
and not at all when it is nearly sated this seems hardly plausible. If
an impulse to flee from the parent were present it would, one imagines,
be strongest when the young one is least in need of food, not vice versa.
Admittedly it is feasible that a gesture deriving from the intention to
flee might by its implied inferiority or submissiveness have come to be
used when the young one must needs to propitiate, or ingratiate itself
with the parent. But there does not seem any positive evidence for

this. I once saw a frightened young Avadavat beg, while still
" freezing " in alarm with sleeked down plumage, and it did so by
simply opening its bill without wing or neck movement. A moment
before hearing its father's alarm calls this bird had been begging
intensely with raised wing, so evidently fear had the same inhibiting
effect on its begging display as satiety usually does.
I think the wing movements of these species may originally have
been a balancing movement, homologous with and derived from the
usual fluttering wing movements shown by other young passerines.
Secondarily it may have become ritualised, to some extent, as a display.
But ritualization does not seem to have gone very far and I think it
not at all unlikely that the throwing upwards or outwards of the wing
or wings may still function as a balancing movement, under natural
conditions. It seems quite possible that a fledgling clinging among

grass stems or reeds would often have to make some compensating
movement of the wings if it were not to overbalance when adopting
the crouched, neck-twisting posture of high intensity begging. This is,
however, mere speculation and only observation in the wild or in an
aviary with the same sort of vegetation as the wild birds usually nest
among could show whether or not it is valid. Even among the twigs
and branches in the room, however, I often got the impression that
the upthrust or outthrust wing(s) of the fledgling aided it to maintain
balance as it begged or was fed.
Displays of the Avadavat
The Avadavat has a display with nesting material held in the bill
that is undoubtedly homologous with the Stem Display of the Blue-
breast and the similar displays of other waxbills and firefinches
(see Goodwin, 1959, Harrison, 1956, and Kunkel, 1959). In it the
displaying bird, with a piece of grass or feather held by the shaft in
its bill and with its body feathers puffed out bows slowly, then sings
and bows again. Kunkel describes this display in detail and evidently
saw it many times from both sexes. I have often seen abortive versions
of this display from young birds, including the i960 youngsters that
only fledged late in July (time of writing this, 20th August), but have
only twice seen it given in full form, on each occasion by the old hen
to her mate at times when she was, apparently, eager to go to nest
and he was not. Sir Godfrey Davis (1928) would appear to have seen
it only from the females of the several pairs he kept also. I doubt,
however, if the female is really more prone to give this display than
the male. It is more likely that if one partner is ready to mate and
breed and the other unresponsive, then the former, whatever its sex,
will display.
The male also has a display that is in form essentially similar to the
posturing of the young when begging at high intensity. In it he
crouches, raises and flutters the far wing and may somewhat extend the
near wing, which may also be fluttered. Sometimes his tail is pressed
to the substrate and sometimes it may be twisted towards the female.
Usually the male turns his head somewhat towards the bird he is
displaying to and utters the soft, twittering nest-call. He may sing
during the display or (and more often) immediately afterwards or in
an interval after which he crouches and flutters his wings again. I have
seen this display given, on many occasions, by both the old male and
Yellow Left, towards the young female Blue Left, whom neither of
them has ever appeared very interested in. Usually after giving this
display the male so doing has either threatened or pecked the female
and driven her off or attacked some other bird. Twice the display
(each time by the old male) has been terminated by the other male
attacking the displaying bird. Sir Godfrey Davis (1928) implied that

</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.99945625" page_id="56315413"  page_num="189" year="" vol="">
this display was the male's response to the bowing display from the
female, but he saw it from a male whose own mate had been taken
from him and a new female substituted. Kunkel, at the time of writing
his paper, had only seen this display from a male Avadavat to a Grey
Waxbill (Estrilda troglodytes ), but has since seen it given to other
Avadavats but only, he informs me (in litt.), to strange females,
never to the male's own mate.
The exact significance of this display is difficult to fathom. It is
probably homologous to the wing-fluttering display of the Blue-
breast but is not apparently given, as is the case with the latter, in a
submissive display to the loved one but only to females whom the male
is not in love with. It does, however, seem to indicate that the displaying
bird's aggressiveness is at least temporarily inhibited, perhaps through
sexual attraction. At any rate the female Blue Left usually seemed
sexually excited by it, as shown by her hopping nearer to or around
the displaying male in the tail-twist posture. Once she pecked at the
old male and he only hopped away from her and continued displaying,
although when he had finished he attacked her and drove her away.
I have not had the impression, as I have with the homologous wing-
movements of the begging young (q.v.), that the raising of the wings
in this display might serve partly to maintain the bird's balance.
However, I have only seen it given when the displaying bird was on a
firm substrate (the window ledge) and the similar (and homologous
wing-raising of the threatening Bronze Mannikin (Morris, 1957) is
thought to function as a balancing movement as well as to display the
bright wing markings to the rival.
Like the Blue-breast and Gold-breast (and many other estrildines)
the Avadavat shows the Tail-twist Posture, usually when it approaches
another individual who attracts it sexually. In this it hops up to the
other with the crown feathers sleeked, giving the head an odd, tri-
angular appearance, and twists its tail towards the other bird. I mean,
of course, the tail is held at an angle to the body, not that its actual
feathers are twisted. When it does so the brilliant upper tail-coverts
are shown clearly to the bird being approached.
Kunkel describes a copulation ceremony in which the male pecks at
the female's neck and she (if ready to mate) quivers her tail. On the
few occasions that I have seen my birds successfully copulate the male
has simply hopped up to the female and mounted her without more
ado. I have seen many similar attempts which have been frustrated
through the female moving away or pecking at the male. It would be
of interest to know if there are racial differences in the extent
to which some displays are given as between the races punicea , which
my birds belong to, and amandava , which latter seems to have been the
race kept by Kunkel and Davis.

Displays of Gold-breast.
The male Gold-breast has a display homologous with the stem-
display of most waxbills and the bowing of the Avadavat but which is
performed without any nesting material in the bill. He hops up to the
female in the tail-twist posture and then may, or may not, hop around
her before, from a position at her side, bowing deeply. He bows to the
side away from the female, not towards her as does the Avadavat.
Highest (top) and lowest (bottom) positions of male Golden-breasted Waxbill
giving its bowing display with fanned tail.
Copulation may follow if the female is willing although, as is usual
with courtship displays, the most intense display from the male is seen
when he is eager and the female indifferent or hostile. Immediately
before and during bowing the male usually gives a rather soft version
of the nest-call (q.v.), and there is often a rapid opening and shutting
of the mandibles. Kunkel's birds would appear not to have given any
notes (unless too faint or high-pitched for him to hear) in this situation,
but mine certainly do so much more often than not.
Sometimes instead of twisting his tail towards the female the male
fans it during the bowing display. Then as he bows there is an opening
and closing of the tail feathers but they never close to the same degree
as when the tail is held normally. In this tail-fanning version all the
male bird's movements and posturings are identical with those used
by the nest-calling male. The only difference is that when nest-calling
the male is usually in a site more or less suitable for a nest. However, no
hard and fast line can be drawn between nest-calling proper and the

bowing display (tail-fanning version). During his long, vain courtship
of the two females the unpaired male would very often display from
perches that were quite unsuitable as nest-sites (though even more
often from suitable sites) provided that a female was near. Under these
circumstances the female might be in any position (in front, behind,
above, below, to one side, etc.) relative to the displaying male. When
the female is below or behind the male the tail-fanning displays the
dark, white-edged tail and the vivid orange ventral feathers and
under tail-coverts to the best advantage. However, the male does not
seem to seek this position vis-a-vis the female when nest-calling.
So far as the bowing display is concerned I have the impression
that tail-fanning indicates a greater degree of emotion or perhaps
emotion of a slightly different quality (more supplicatory, less overtly
sexual ?) than does the tail-twist version. Although no nesting
material is held in the bill the movements of the displaying (or nest-
calling) Gold-breast are even more obviously derived from nest-
building movements than is the case with the homologous displays of
other waxbills.
Kunkel (i960) describes a display of the female Gold-breast in
which she hops around the male, stretches herself up tall, puffs out
her feathers and then sleeks them again, sometimes with and sometimes
without a piece of grass in her bill. I have not seen this although f
have often seen the male hopping up to and around the female in
a very upright posture. Usually this behaviour has appeared to be just
intention-movements of mounting the female and has indeed often
ended in the male jumping on to the female's back (usually after having
hopped round behind her) and her fleeing from under him. Some-
times, however, the male has faced the female in this posture and then
his orange breast (in the typical race) is prominently shown to her.
I have only once seen a male perform this display, if so it can be called,
with anything in his bill. Then it was a piece of grass that he had been
toying with before and I had the impression that it was by chance that
he retained hold of it.

a few feet of the ceiling. This differs from the Blue-breasts who,
although they often choose high sites, will readily nest within 4 feet
of the floor. Since wild Gold-breasts and Avadavats usually nest low
down, choice of my captive birds are evidently artifacts of captivity,
caused, no doubt, by the birds associating my presence, which they
fear, with the lower levels of the room. Both when wild and when
in captivity birds choose nest-sites where they feel secure. In the wild
this will (except in some man-altered environments) result in their
choosing the best available natural sites, but in captivity it may result
in what first appears an " unnatural " preference.
The Avadavats, when selecting a site among twigs or branches,
choose one with some fairly firm horizontal support. This may be a
personal idiosyncrasy, although as Kunkel has pointed out in his
detailed account of nest-construction in this species, the first stage of
the nest is a flattish platform of material. Like Blue-breasts and
Gold-breasts they will readily nest inside one of the wicker baskets
with a hole in the side sold for " foreign finches One can in such
cases see even less of the building movements than otherwise. Never-
theless, with several birds kept together many nests built exposed to
the prying beaks of others come to grief. So, when I wish a brood to
be reared, I destroy the first stages of any nest built in the branches
and place a basket in the exact spot, when it is almost always accepted
and the new nest built inside it.
Both male and female Avadavat build and carry feathers for the
nest lining but I have only seen the cock take grass and stems for the
outer part of the nest. Both sexes also take pieces of burnt and charred
wood into the nest. This they do most when the eggs are near hatching
and while the young are small but, to some extent, at all times from
egg-laying till the fledging of the young. These bits of burnt wood are
pushed into and just under the surface of the nest-lining. In two nests
which I dissected they were found everywhere except in the roof of
the nest, but about three-quarters of them were concentrated within an
inch or so of the entrance. The grass-finches (Poephila sp.) are known
also to take bits of charcoal into their nests, but I have seen no records
of any other estrildines doing so. My Gold-breasts and Blue-breasts
have shown no interest in the burnt matches and morsels of charred
wood which the Avadavats take so eagerly. It would be interesting to
know what is the use of this habit in the natural state.
Most writers on estrildines have said that they all carry nesting
material in the same characteristic way, taking the feather, stem or
grass blade by its firmest end. Kunkel (1959) says (of all estrildines)
" . . . only very thin and short strands they occasionally c bundle ' 55

any material but always find the hardest end of the stem or feather and
carry it by that. They appear to be psychologically incapable of
carrying anything in any other way. The Avadavat, however, uses
both the normal " bundling " method of most passerines (which
anyone who has watched a building Canary will be familiar with) and
the typical estrildine method. It has a preference for the latter and
uses it where possible without loss of efficiency but not otherwise.
One large feather (I give the body feathers of poultry, which can be
found in quantity inside cushions, pillows and similar household
objects) will, for example, be taken by the base of the shaft, but if two
or three such feathers are near each other the Avadavat will " bundle "
them and carry them grasped across the (approximate) middle of the
shafts.
White and pale-coloured feathers are preferred, as a rule, to similar
but dark-coloured ones. Amandava amandava , however, shares with
Homo sapiens the vice of covetousness and the most desirable feather
is one that some other bird is just carrying to its nest. This the cock
Avadavat, if in a feather-collecting mood, will usually try to snatch
away from its owner before bothering about other feathers, just like it,
which nobody has claimed.
Both sexes incubate, in turns, and both feed the young in the nest and
after fledging. There is no division of the brood between the parents
after the young are out of the nest, such as occurs with many species.
Possibly, however, this would not in any case occur in the limited
space of captivity. Could some of our members who have bred species
such as the House Sparrow, which when wild divide the brood after
fledging, enlighten us on this point ? The young are fed by regurgitation,
the parent thrusting its bill into their mouths to do so.
When the three Avadavats were feeding the mixed brood they
showed no specific discrimination. Young begging intensely, whether
Avadavat or Gold-breast, were usually given precedence. Often the
adult would approach a group of six or seven mixed fledglings on a
branch, feed the nearest one, then scramble over the backs of two or
three to reach one in the centre that begged eagerly. The very marked
difference, at least to human ears, between the begging calls of the
two species never seemed to perturb the old Avadavats in the slightest
degree or make them show their own young any partiality.
I have never seen a female Gold-breast do more than carry an odd
feather to the nest, though she may, probably does, share in its con-
struction, at least after the outer structure has been built by the male.
In a wild state this bird often merely relines the old nests of other
species (Praed and Grant, 1955). Mine have built quite effective
nests in the branches, choosing mainly blades and leaves of dead
grass. However, for safety's sake I now try to get them to nest in the
globular baskets, as already described.

Unfortunately I was so engrossed with my Blue-breasts in the summer
of 1959 that I paid little attention to the two pairs of Gold-breasts
that then nested. Of the pair that nested successfully this year the
cock only took short and not particularly frequent spells on the nest
during incubation. I never saw him brood or feed his young, although
he often peered interestedly but somewhat apprehensively into the
nest when his mate was feeding them and sometimes when she was
not. When the young had fledged he not only fed them, but then,
after they had gone into the Avadavats' nest, he entered it in order
to feed them. He did not, however, feed them so often as his mate
and he showed a great tendency to preen them instead of feeding
them, often rather roughly, which suggested that he felt some hostility
towards them.
Unlike the Avadavats the parent Gold-breasts fed only their own
young, picking them out unerringly from among the young Avadavats.
Only once did I see the hen Gold-breast start to feed a young Avadavat,
but then she stopped at once, before the wretched fledgling had
a mouthful, and flew off to find one of her young to feed instead.
If, as is likely, birds that have nestling young learn to recognize their
young at fledging time, this could easily account for the acceptance of
the young Gold-breasts by the Avadavats and the non-acceptance of
the latter's young, which appeared later, by the Gold-breasts. But
that is not the whole story since during the several days that the
Avadavats' nest contained (most of the time) five young Avadavats
and four young Gold-breasts, the latter's parents fed only their own
young and the young Avadavats did not beg to them. Often I watched the
hen Gold-breast go into the nest and heard her young beg loudly, but
not a sound from the young Avadavats. Then, often only a few seconds
later, one (any one) of the three Avadavats would enter the nest and
at once there would be a clamour of begging cries from the young of
both species, proving clearly that the young Avadavats had not been
sated, and for that reason silent, when the adult Gold-breast was feeding
its young. Possibly parent estrildines have, like many birds, a very
soft call with which they indicate readiness to feed young (though
I have never been able to hear such a call and it must be very faint),
but if so it is surprising that the Avadavats did not respond (or, perhaps,
quickly learned from not being fed not to respond) to the Gold-
breast's food call whereas the young Gold-breasts certainly responded
immediately whenever an Avadavat entered the nest. I must add that
on the occasion that I saw the hen Gold-breast start to feed the young
Avadavat she flew to it and its begging may well have been in response
to her preparatory intention movements of regurgitation. Or again
it may actually have begged at one of the adult Avadavats nearby.
I certainly got the impression that it was hearing its begging call that
made the Gold-breast realize her mistake.

When a young Avadavat first leaves the nest its parents show great
excitement, fly close above it, settle by it and apparently endeavour to
lead it back into the branches, usually successfully, should it land on
the floor. Under the conditions under which my birds are kept the
parents' solicitude in some matters can be vexatious for all concerned,
their constant warning whenever they see or hear me or whenever
one of the young ones makes a bad landing or flutters against the wall
tending to frighten and confuse the young ones. Whereas normally,
even if they see me looking through the Judas hole, the adult Avadavats
take little or no heed, when they have fledged young all is changed.
Then, if the bird notices me looking through the hole, it at once gives
loud warning notes. When doing so the old cock (but not the young
cock or the hen) would often fly down towards the opening, hover,
calling loudly only a foot or so from my eyes and then return to the
branches. Whether the birds actually know it is me behind the door
on such occasions or whether they merely know that something is there
I do not know. Either explanation would account for their behaviour
and not contradict their usual indifference, since most birds, when
they have young near fledging age or recently fledged, react far more
intensely to possible danger than they do any other time.
Kunkel (1959) states that estrildines never attempt to protect their
young. The loud outcry and intention-movements of flying at me
shown by my male Avadavats and Blue-breasts if I hold one of their
young and it cries out in my hand make me think that they would
attack if they dared to do so. Males of both species fiercely attack
other adults that attempt to copulate with the fledglings, which they
frequently do. When so doing they peck only at the mounted adult, not
at the fledgling and do not attempt to take the former's place when
they have dislodged it. However, this defence of the young may be
motivated by sexual jealousy of a sort, since I have not seen a female
defend her young in this situation. The young male Avadavat
attempted several times to copulate with the fledglings which he
was also feeding, and was violently attacked by the old male whenever
he did so.

shrill but " sweet " calls in many situations. I think it is probably due
to the inadequacy of the human ear, or at any rate my ear, rather than
an inadequacy of the birds' vocabularies that they seem to have far
fewer distinct notes than, for example, a Blue-breast. The calls are
usually monosyllabic but several such calls may be repeated at short
intervals. The Avadavat gives a rather loud, long-drawn (but still
monosyllabic) version of its usual call when attacking or threatening

a rival with whom it is really angry (or of whom it has some fear ?) but
seldom does so when it casually repulses some importunate inferior.
A still louder and more emphatic version of this call is given by
parent birds when they suppose their fledged young are in danger.
A rapidly repeated series of " run-together 55 notes, with a very
excited tone and on a descending scale, is quite often given. When
I have actually seen the bird giving them it has been in the typical
singing posture (q.v.) and the notes have seemed to function as an
alternative to song.
The nest call.
When " nest-calling 55 both species utter a series of rapidly repeated,
soft but high-pitched notes that could, perhaps, be transcribed
" Ti-ti-ti-ti." or " Teh-teh-teh-teh ..." In the Gold-breast
these notes are higher pitched and fainter than in the Avadavat
although, at least to my ears, clearly audible. There is some variation
of loudness and pitch according, apparently, to the intensity with
which the notes are given.
The Avadavat gives these notes when nest-calling from an actual or
potential nest-site. Presumably it then accompanies them with symbolic
or actual building movements, but I have not had a clear view of
a nest-calling bird of this species, so cannot be sure. When the male
brings a feather to line the nest, while the hen is incubating, one of
them, I think the hen, usually gives the nest-call as soon as he enters
the nest. The male may also give the nest-call when giving his wing-
fluttering display (q.v.)
The Gold-breast gives the nest-call not only when nest-calling
but also immediately before and during his bowing display (q.v.).
Both " nest-calling " and the bowing display may, however, be
performed in silence although perhaps, on these occasions, the calling
is given at a lower intensity and is inaudible to the human ear.
Song and vocal mimicry.
As everyone who has kept them knows, wild-caught male Avadavats
have a very pretty little song that is given on a descending scale.
I have heard this only a few times from my old male (once firmly
paired, Avadavats seem to sing very little) so cannot say to what
extent an individual may have different songs or at least songs that
vary somewhat from each other.
Perhaps because his father seldom or never sang during his youth
and adolescence the young male Yellow Left, when his song began
to " crystallize out " from the rambling inconsequential warbling
that young Avadavats, like most other young passerines, begin to
utter when only a week or two out of the nest, imitated the Blue-
breast's songs. By March i960 he had in his repertoire what appeared
to be the innate song of his species, an exact copy of the Blue-breast's

song (utterly unlike the Avadavat's song in sound) and various
intermediate songs between the two. Whether he had an innate
ability to render his own song or whether, which seems more likely, he
had learnt it from his father having, possibly, given it when I was not
at hand, I do not know.
Avadavat singing in typical posture (left) and with crown feathers sleeked down
(right).
Given the faculty for mimicry it is not surprising that the young male
Avadavat should have learnt the cock Blue-breast's song, which he
heard so often from infancy onwards. What did astonish me, however,
was the behaviour of his sister. She had always spent much less time
" warbling " when young, than he, and usually gave only rather
short and disconnected utterances. Finally, however (by March i960),
she had " decided " on her song, a perfect imitation of the song of
the female Blue-breast ! This differs, inter alia , from the male's song
in being shorter and to this extent agrees with the natural song of the
female Avadavat but seems, to my ear, to have little else in common
with it. Since female Blue-breasts sing much less than the males,
she had certainly had far less opportunity to learn this song than
she would have had to learn the male Blue-breast's song, which she
has never, so far as I know, imitated. Indeed I first heard her giving
her version of the female song only a week or so after a hen Blue-breast
had been widowed and had, therefore, begun to sing quite often for a
short period. So it seems as though this female Blue-breast's song
was " what she had been waiting for " and that she learnt it quite
quickly once she had heard it.
As with most other estrildines, song in the Avadavat is sexual rather
than territorial or hostile in character. Sometimes the sexual element
seems very slight or sublimated as in the warbling of juveniles. Usually
the bird sings in an upright posture with body feathers, especially on
the under parts, and those of the crown somewhat erected. When
singing at a female it is courting it may, however, sleek down its crown
feathers so as to present the triangular head shape common in sexually
displaying estrildines (see sketches). Most commonly the singing

Avadavat perches alone, but " alone " in this context often merely
means that it sidles an inch or two along the perch from its companions
before singing. I have, however, occasionally seen the young male
Yellow Left sing while actually perching in contact with another
individual. Except in the bowing display I have never heard an
Avadavat sing in the immediate presence of its own mate, although
the young male Yellow Left often sang at the old female whom he was
vainly courting.
Kunkel states emphatically that no estrildine sings in defence of its
territory. In the sense that by the term " song 55 we understand
a series of notes that are aesthetically pleasing to the human ear, this
may be true but the Gold-breast has, however, characteristic notes
that, so far as one can judge from captive birds , seem functionally equivalent
to the hostile songs of many other passerines. This is a loud, rather
strident chirping, rather like the chirping a male House Sparrow
utters when perched outside its nest site or when in cover of trees
during a shower of rain. Usually three or four rather high pitched
chirps are followed by one on a lower key and rather harsher in tone.
This chirping is given by the male during the breeding season. He
may utter this strident chirping at any time of day but does not often
do so except in the early morning and evening. With the first hint of
light, and before most of the wild birds outside are singing, the strident
" song " of the Gold-breast starts up in my bird room, making me
hope that it is less audible to my neighbours than to me. The " singing "
male perches in a very upright posture and turns his head about as he
calls. As the light grows and his rival becomes more visible, fierce
sparring and chasing alternate with the calling. The chirping also
accompanies the actual chasing and when the birds are in contact or
nearly in contact during a chase a rather long-drawn chirp, even
harsher and lower pitched than the relatively harsh and low-pitched
one that comes up about once in four in the interminable chirping
" song ", is uttered, often several times in quick succession, I think by
the chasing bird but cannot be sure. Similar " singing " and sparring
takes place at dusk and a little before it too sometimes, though rela-
tively seldom during the rest of the day. Switching on the light as soon
as the Gold-breasts start to sing or before the first trace of the natural
light has induced them to begin, does not prevent them from singing
but does, as a rule, shorten the period for which they do so.
Kunkel does not mention this singing and related behaviour at all but
it seems unlikely to be an artifact of captivity as all three of my males
have shown it in identical form. It is possible, however, that it is
purely hostile rather than territorial and it would be interesting to
know if males of pairs kept out of sight and hearing of rivals " sing "
in this manner. I shall be most grateful for information on this or any
other point of interest from other keepers of Gold-breasts.

workers of the small black ant (? Lasius niger ) or the small reddish-
yellow ant. When so doing sometimes one wing, sometimes both may
be brought forward. Usually the wings are spread only a little or not
at all. So far as I have been able to see neither species actually picks
up ants in the bill though, like some other species that do not, it makes
movements of doing so and then makes a stroking movement of the
bill down the inner side of the primaries or of the forward thrust tail.
As well as this more or less typical anting behaviour I have, on one or
two occasions, seen Avadavats, but not Gold-breasts, crawl over the
ants with spread, depressed tail and " humped " back in a manner
very similar to that of a Woodlark or Reed Bunting in its distraction
display.
Note on Moulting of Avadavats
Davis (1928) says that Avadavats are not ready to breed until the
male is in red plumage. Kunkel (1959) on the other hand found that
his birds showed breeding behaviour irrespective of their plumage
state. My male birds have shown breeding behaviour from the start
of moult into the red plumage, or rather from the time a few red
feathers have grown. However, it seems possible that their doing
so has an inhibiting or delaying effect on the moult. My old male who
did not breed in the Spring and Summer of 1959 and was in full
colour by August 1959 is now (30th August i960) only half in red
plumage. The young male Yellow Left, who commenced moulting
in March i960, was only about three parts " red 55 by mid-August and
has now commenced moulting into the brown plumage without ever
having completed the moult into breeding dress. Both of my males
cease to show reproductive behaviour as soon as the moult into the
brown dress begins.

By J. J. Ye ALL AND
Of the birds received during the past two months, three species have
not previously been exhibited at Regent's Park. These are a pair of
Eastern Pratincoles [filareola maldivarum ), a Brown Violet-eared
Humming Bird ( Colihri delphinae) and a pair of Ruppell's Weavers
(.Ploceus galbula).
The Pratincole is considered by Peters to be a separate species, but
by others to be an eastern race of G. pratincola which it much resembles.
The Brown Violet-eared Humming Bird inhabits parts of Central
America and tropical South America and Ruppelfs Weaver is found
in north-eastern parts of Africa and in western Arabia.
Other arrivals of especial interest are an Eritrean Shikra (. Astur
badius sphenurus) , a pair of Abyssinian Ground Hornbills (. Bucorvus
abyssinicus) , two Violet-eared Humming Birds fiolibri coruscans corns cans),
Striated Jay-Thrushes, Black-headed Sibias, Lanceolated Jays,
Jackson's Whydahs and a Fire-tailed Finch.
After unsuccessfully nesting in 1958 and 1959, a pair of Sarus
Cranes have hatched two chicks which are now (at six weeks of age)
some 36 inches tall. The incubation period was thirty days. At first
the parents fed the chicks almost exclusively on pieces of earthworm,
digging for them in the paddock when the proffered supply ran out.
They were also supplied with minced raw meat, cleaned maggots, one
of the pellet foods used for the feeding of turkeys and some corn. Ripe
mulberries from a tree in the paddock were eaten by the parents, but
whether any were passed on to the chicks is not known. The chicks still
take food from the tips of the parents' beaks, but generally pick it up
for themselves. This Crane was bred at Whipsnade in the 1930-40
period, and, of course, elsewhere, but not previously in Regent's Park.
A King Penguin, the only one to hatch from three eggs, did not
survive. One Night Heron, the first to be bred since several years ago,
has left its nest. White Peafowl and Californian Quail have chicks.

Society of America.
The Avicultural Society of America was founded at a meeting in
New York on 19th October, 1927. During the first year of its existence
it had no publication of its own but used the columns of The Pet
Dealer under the heading " The Avicultural Magazine By the end
of 1928 the society had grown sufficiently to warrant a magazine and
it was perhaps somewhat natural that this heading should be retained
as the title for the new publication.

The first issue of The Avicultural Magazine appeared in January,
1929. The duplication of our title would, of course, have caused very con-
siderable confusion. On representation being made to the American
Society it willingly changed the title to Aviculture-- the first number of
which was dated March, 1929. From then until the end of 1932 it was
published monthly, but in 1933 the Society ran into difficulties, mainly
due to the collapse of the bank holding the Society's funds, and publica-
tion more or less lapsed. By 1935 the Society was back on it's feet and
the Magazine appeared bi-monthly until the end of 1943. During the
following six years publication was spasmodic, but several numbers,
even four or five, were produced each year. Publication was finally
suspended at the end of 1950. At that time the affairs of the Society
were at a very low level and it was, in fact, only just managing to
survive. There then seemed little likelihood of its again being in a
position to publish a regular journal and it was under these circum-
stances that Jean Delacour proposed that there should be an amalgama-
tion of the Avicultural Magazine and Aviculture, and that the
Avicultural Magazine should serve as the Official Journal of the
British and American Societies--the two societies retaining their
individual identities, (see Avicult. Mag., 1951, 3). This position has
obtained until the present time.
In 1954 a postal ballot of the members of the American Society
showed an overwhelming majority in favour of the Society again
having a publication of its own, and so in October, 1954, the first
number of the Avicultural Bulletin appeared. It has been published
monthly ever since.
Not by any means all members of the American Society are members
of the Avicultural Society, too, and these naturally regard the Bulletin
as their Society's official organ. It does indeed appear to be the wish
of the majority, so henceforth the Avicultural Bulletin must be
recognized as such.
The severance is really little more than a technicality and will, of
course, in no way impair the very friendly relationship that has always
existed between the two societies.
It is very satisfactory to be able to record that the American Society
is now fortunate in having a number of hardworking and enthusiastic
officers and directors, and while the membership is at present com-
paratively small numerically it is in the main no less enthusiastic. We
certainly wish them well.

of course, never seen the Andean or James 5 6 before and was most
impressed with them. The Toucans are, I think, the best lot I have
ever seen and the new one, the Curly-headed Toucanette (P. beau-
harnoisii), was most spectacular. The Mossy-throated Bellbird was
also interesting. Lee Crandall told me that many of the wattles have

Amazing what they will do in a little glass-fronted cage with visitors

see the chick as it was inside the large nest which had been introduced
into the cage, but both parents were busy and the male was using up a
lot of energy flying at the glass. 55

By Alan R. Longhurst (Freetown, Sierra Leone, West Africa)
One of the pleasures of an itinerant aviculturist--or bird watcher--
is to find that a wild bird he knows well at home has blossomed out, in
a country new to him, into a whole range of different species. An
American visiting Europe will find that his familiar Chickadee has
become a range of about half-a-dozen common and diverse titmice,
and so the European in Africa discovers, in place of the single and
rather elusive species of kingfisher he knows at home, a range of
conspicuous and ecologically differentiated forms.
Within a few miles of Freetown we regularly see at least five species
of kingfishers, and a couple of others are present, but not so often seen.
Ecologically, these are differentiated into the terrestrial, insect-eating
forms, the forest and hill stream species, and those found mostly along
the coast or the shores of estuaries.
During the dry season the Grey-headed Kingfisher (. Halcyon leuco -
cephala) moves down to the coastal areas from the semi-desert regions
far to the north. Like the rather similar, but larger, Senegal Kingfisher
(H. senegalensis ) which is common in our gardens all the year round,
the Grey-headed is a purely terrestrial species living on insects and
mice in open, grassy places and on small crabs along the shores of the
mangrove creeks. These species can sometimes be seen diving into
fresh water, but only for bathing purposes. Quite different in habits is
the fish-eating Pied Kingfisher ( Ceryle rudis) , widely distributed over
Africa and well known to travellers from Egypt southwards. Con-
spicuous on a stump or post beside a brackish creek, or hovering over
the shallows for small fish, this is one of our most noticeable and
attractive birds.
Finally, the two extremes in size : the Giant ( Megaceryle maxima)
and the Pygmy (Ispidina picta) Kingfishers. The first is grey with a dark
head, enormous bill, and rufous chest--and is as large as a jackdaw--
while the second is a tiny confection of chestnut, coral, electric blue,

and shocking purple, and is little larger than a Wren. The Giant is
a fish and crab eater and is most often seen along the fast, clear streams
that come down the forested hills, while the Pygmy is restricted to even
drier country than either the Grey-headed or Senegal, and is entirely
insectivorous.
An interesting and attractive element of the African avifauna, but
not one which the writer, at least, has any wish to keep in captivity ;
their predatory habits and alarm-clock noises make them unattractive
subjects, the more so when one can in any case enjoy the sight of
them daily.

THE BREEDING OF STELLER'S JAY (CYANOCITTA
STELLERI) AT DUDLEY ZOO

By D. H. S. Risdon (Dudley, Worcs., England)
We received a pair of these Jays from Mr. K. A. Norris in May 1956.
We have found them to be extremely hardy and they have spent the
winters here in an outdoor aviary with an unheated shelter, being
shut up at night.
Like all Jays they are omnivorous in diet taking insectile mixture,
fruit, raw meat, and nuts. They seem to show a preference for a vege-
tarian diet and are very fond of peanuts, sunflower seed, etc., which
they hold under one foot and hack open in the same way as the tit
family.
We had never seriously considered attempting to breed with them
because our aviaries at the Zoo are not really suitable for breeding
insectivorous species. However, last year (1959) I did bring them down
to my garden aviary, which is naturally planted, to see what they would
do. They had scarcely been in it twenty-four hours when they started
carrying large beakfuls of nesting material into a thick bush. My hopes
ran high for a few days when this building fever ceased as suddenly
as it began. They showed no further interest in nesting and by mid-
summer went into a moult, so that was that.
Up to that time we had never been quite sure that we had a true
pair, as the birds were almost identical in appearance. From their
behaviour in my planted aviary it became fairly obvious that we had a
cock and hen so this year we decided to give them a compartment in
one of the Zoo aviaries and rigged up an artificial nest-site for them.
This was done with great care by our senior Bird Keeper, Mrs. E.
Harris. It consisted of a large bunch of twiggy branches hollowed and
flattened out in the middle, fixed up in a quiet corner of the aviary.
To give the whole thing a firm foundation a saucer-shaped basket of

wire netting was rammed well down into the middle of the thicket and
some turves of grass were pressed into place on top of this.
The birds had not long been in the aviary before they started carry-
ing nesting material to the prepared site. This consisted of hay and
any other bits of rubbish they could pick up in the aviary. They were
given further supplies of fine twigs and coarse hay. When the nest
was nearly complete it was noticed that their water bowl was constantly
empty and that the birds came down to collect the wet earth round it,
obviously to line the nest. A bowl of mud was put in the aviary, but
they took no notice of this. Nest building was completed within a
fortnight and the first egg was seen on the 9th May.
The following notes have been given me by Mrs. Harris. They are
inevitably somewhat sketchy because, for obvious reasons, every
precaution was taken not to interfere with the nesting birds.
The next time Mrs. Harris was able to have a peep there were
three eggs. The colour of these was pale blue with dark spots. The
birds were then left severely alone until the 1st June when on looking
into the nest two young birds were seen. Judging from their size they
were thought to be about two or three days old. It seems, therefore,
that the incubation period must have been sixteen to seventeen days.
One week later the nest was again inspected and only one youngster
was seen, the second having vanished as well as the third egg. The
colour of the young was pink when first hatched but later the skin
turned to grey. Apparently they had no nestling down.
The young one left the nest on the 26th June and spent the first two
or three days hopping about on the ground. It looked very immature
although well feathered and only about half the size of its parents.
However, from then on it grew quickly and soon developed into a very
fine young specimen. Its colouring was the same as the parents, only
much duller, but it has now moulted and is indistinguishable from the
old hen.
Shortly after the rearing of the young bird we had the misfortune to
lose the old cock. His age was unknown so he may have been an aged
bird and the strain of rearing a young one may have finished him off.
Anyway he died at the onset of the moult.
The young one was reared, as might be expected, entirely on live
or freshly killed food consisting of mealworms, maggots and newly
born rats and mice, of which we are fortunate enough to have a
regular supply for reptile feeding. Curiously enough the birds would
not eat adult mice, although these were offered repeatedly. They would
only take the newly born, pink ones.
For those who don't know Steller's Jay, the body, wings and tail are
dark blue, the wings being faintly barred in lighter blue. The head,
neck and upper breast are black. The bird has a pronounced crest,
which can be raised or lowered at will. Beak and legs are black. In

size it is mid-way between a Mistle-thrush and a British Jay. The sexes
are identical.
Its voice is very similar to that of our native bird consisting of a
series of harsh squawks. I did on one occasion, however, when they
were in my planted aviary in 1959, hear the cock bird uttering a low
chortling kind of song.

(Kakatoe alba)
By Paul E. Schneider (San Gabriel, California, U.S.A.)
My main achievement in i960 was the breeding of the Umbrella
Cockatoo (.Kakatoe alba ). The youngster appeared on the aviary perch
on the morning of 16th September. It was first observed as a chick
about the 28th of June and was then about two days old. The nest
was an upright 55-gallon oak barrel with the entrance hole near
the top ; the barrel rested on the ground underneath the sheltered
portion of the aviary. The aviary is 32 feet long, 4 feet wide, and 8 feet
high. The adult birds were in my possession some 4! years and had
eggs on previous occasions. Unfortunately, due to the large nesting
accommodation provided they always seemed to crack their eggs.
I was actually in the process of replacing this barrel with a more suit-
able nesting-box when the chick was discovered. Two eggs were laid.
The adult birds are fed on canary seed, sunflower seed, raw Virginia
peanuts, whole wheat bread, and quartered oranges. The oranges
are the first choice of the cockatoos over the other food offered. They
do not eat the peelings that is why I quarter them. This is what the
young Umbrella Cockatoo was reared on.
The young cockatoo appears to be a female. The iris is a milky
colour similar to that of the young female Roseate Cockatoo. Another
reason why I think it to be a female is that the adult male attempted
copulation the very morning it left the nest. As a matter of fact I thought
it was the adult pair at first. The youngster is nearly as large as the
adults and I have to look closely to see which is which.
I have gone through Records of Parrots Bred in Captivity and can find
no record of this species of Cockatoo being bred. Is this the first
breeding of this species of Cockatoo in captivity ? From what informa-
tion can be gathered in the U.S. it appears to be at least a first
breeding here.
The Hon. Secretary of the Avicultural Society states that this is
probably a " world first breeding ". Ed.

By Sten Bergman (Ronninge per Stockholm, Sweden)
In New Guinea the family Psittacidae is very richly represented.
According to Mayr's " List of New Guinea Birds 55 of 1941 not less
than 137 different species and subspecies of this family were known
at that time and later several more have been added to the list.
A most fascinating genus among the Psittacidae is Micropsitta, earlier
called JYasiterna , which includes the smallest parrots in the world.
During three expeditions in Dutch New Guinea in the years 1948-49,
1 952-53, and 1957-5851 made aquaintance with some different species
of Micropsitta , but especially with Micropsitta keiensis chloroxantha
Oberholser. It is of the same length as a Goldcrest (. Regains ), but while
the Goldcrest has a weight of 5-6 grammes, the weight of the above-
named species is twice this figure and usually a little more, owing to
its more solid structure.
The general coloration of the male is green but the under surface of
the body is paler. The top of the head is yellowish and the middle of
the breast and the middle of the abdomen is orange-red. Two central
tail-feathers are blue and the remainder black. The outermost tail-
feather is edged with green on the outer web and the three outer ones
have a yellow spot at the tip of the inner webs. The wing is 57-59 mm.
and the tail 24-26 mm. The tail-feathers have stiffened ends just like
woodpeckers.
The adult female differs from the male in having the top of the head
more greenish and the breast and abdomen green without any orange-
red colour along the middle.
When I first saw this tiny bird in the tropical jungle, I was greatly
attracted by its nice appearance, its beautiful colours, and its curious
way of climbing the tree-trunks like a woodpecker, using the stiffened
ends of the tail-feathers as support.
During my second expedition to New Guinea I devoted much time
to searching for this bird and its nest and to observations of its habits.
Those natives who knew this bird, told me that it lived in the nests
of the tree termites.
One day my Papuan boy told me that a friend of his had found
a termitary, into which a green parrot not longer than half a finger,
as he expressed it, had disappeared. He had seen it feeding a young
one, which appeared to be ready to fly at any moment. The nest was
situated a couple of miles from my headquarters at Sorong on the
western part of the Vogelkop Peninsula in Dutch New Guinea.
Next day I went with the two Papuans into the jungle to see the
nest. On the top of a narrow ridge, the man, who had found the nest,
halted and pointed to a large fig tree.

The termitary was built on the bole about 11 feet up. It was black
and unusually round, for most termitaries I have seen are rather
elongated. There was a small entrance hole in the underpart of it
and that was where he had seen the parrot. My boy climbed up and
cautiously poked a stick into the hole, but nothing happened. It all
seemed dead. The Papuan who had found the nest said that the
young birds of course had left the nest.
Nevertheless we sat down to wait. After nearly one hour, during
which nothing happened, the Papuans said that the nest must be
empty, so it was no use to stay any longer. I decided to take a photo-
graph of the nest and began getting out my camera and flashlight.
As I was doing this, I suddenly saw a miniature green parrot fly
towards the termitary. The bird was obviously making for the nest, but
our presence made it afraid to fly in at once. Instead it flew from branch
to branch nearby, the whole time uttering a slender warning signal.
In the end I could no longer endure the uncomfortable position, in
which I had frozen, when I first saw the parrot, and had to move.
That scared the parrot and it flew off. We then withdrew and hid
under some branches. There we stayed for more than two hours,
during which time one of the parrots came twice and flew into the
nest. I could hear young birds peeping inside.
As already mentioned, the Papuan had seen one of the parent
birds feeding a young one in the entrance hole, and this one, in his
opinion, was ready to fly. Thus that was perhaps the last day that
the young birds would be in the nest and the next day they might all
have left.
I would very gladly have spent several days watching the birds at
the nest, but the risk of finding it empty, when I returned, was so
great, that I decided to return after dark and take the whole termitary
down from the tree, examine it thoroughly, and find out exactly how
the parrots had arranged themselves. As far as I know from the
literature no one had previously investigated the peculiar nest of that
little parrot of New Guinea.
About one hour before darkness we returned and settled ourselves
some 15 yards from the termitary. There we waited until it was
almost complete darkness. During that time I saw one parrot fly into
the nest, but my view was partially obstructed, so I could not observe
things accurately. The main thing was that the birds should not be
disturbed by our presence, but should fly into the nest for the night
in the normal course of events.
As we sat and waited for darkness to fall, my Papuan boy told me
that these small parrots also lived in the interior of the Vogelkop
Peninsula, where he came from. He told me that they were used as
medicine over there. If you had a pain anywhere, you ate one or more
of those little parrots. You plucked them, wrapped them in leaves and

roasted them on a fire. They were a strong and very good medicine
and soon made you well again, he said.
By seven o'clock it was already so dark that all the birds which
should be in the nest, must already have been there, so I decided to
make a start. First my boy climbed up and plugged the entrance hole
with a piece of cloth, so that the parrots could not fly out. Then he
and his helper took a heavy knife and set about cutting the hard
termitary from the trunk of the tree, to which it seemed to have grown.
The termites swarmed all over the nest and came out in their myriads.
After a tussle the whole termitary was freed and lowered to the ground,
where we put it in a cloth bag, which was then securely fastened, and
so we set off for home.
It was horrible going in the dark in the rough jungle, but with the
Papuans ability to find their way and with the help of my torch we
reached a road without adventures. Then we had two miles to trudge
with our queer load. What we were carrying home beyond thousands
upon thousands of termites, I did not know, but I hoped that there
would be a couple of baby parrots and their parents.
Having got them home, the next thing was to open the termitary.
To prevent the parrots flying out into the room, I covered the termitary,
my boy, and his helper with a mosquito net. Then the boy took a
knife and began slicing off pieces of the hard material, of which the
termitary was made. We opened it from the back, that is to say, the
side that had been up against the trunk of the tree, and where
I expected the parrots' nest to be, we cut a hole. After some slicing,
we had reached the wall of the parrots' chamber and this we pierced.
Inside we could see something green, evidently a parrot. Carefully
we enlarged the hole and then made a pause. Thereupon a little
parrot came out and flew on to the net, where I caught it in my hand.
It pecked me hard and energetically and drew blood, but I did not
care, for there in my hand, I held one of the most sought-after inhabi-
tants of the jungle of New Guinea.
I put the little bird in a cage that was already waiting, and then
another parrot flew out. This had an orange-coloured patch on its
breast and belly and thereby revealed that it was a cock. It bit just
as hard as the other and was put into the same cage. Now there
remain the babies, I thought, but before I could start looking for them,
two other birds came flying out and alighted on the mosquito net.
Having caged these, I fetched out two young birds, which were some
of the sweetest I have ever seen. They were of different ages, for one
had half its green feathers, while on the other most of its feathers were
still in their quills. There appeared to be several days difference
between them, but it was also possible that the larger had seized most
of the food. To apportion food justly cannot be easy, when the nursery
is in perpetual darkness as was the case here.

There's no knowing if the young birds will be alive in the morning
I told myself. So I decided to take some pictures of them at once, as
I was sure that no photographs of specimens of Micropsitta exist. As I

was doing this, one of the Papuans called out that one of the adult
birds had escaped from the cage and was flying round the room.
It settled on the metal netting over the window, and having put out
the light, I was able to catch it there in my hand. Before I put it into
the cage, I counted the ones inside : there were four. Thus the bird
I had in my hand was the fifth adult parrot and had obviously crept
out of the termitary. Immediately after this I saw yet another flying
in the room, and this, too, I caught on the metal netting. After this
I put mosquito netting round the termitary, in case there should be
more to come out. But there were no more. The termitary had thus
housed six adults and two babies.
The parrots' chamber lay in the middle but slightly below the
centre, and it was oval in shape, 8 inches long and 6 inches high.
It contained no nest material, but there were small pieces of white
eggshells and a few tiny green feathers. The passage from the entrance
hole to the chamber ran obliquely upwards towards the bole, on which
the termitary was fastened, then it turned almost at right-angles and
led straight into the chamber.
The great question now was how to keep the parrots alive. The
natives said that they ate termites, and so they did to some extent,
but that was not their normal food. My parrots having been caught
after they had finished eating for the day did not need any food
until the next morning. All the larger parrots people had as pets in
New Guinea were fond of banana and pawpaw, and I hoped that my
small midgets would share that taste.
They were all alive in the morning, and I started by offering them
banana and pawpaw, but none of them would touch either. I offered
them mixed bird-seeds, that I had brought from Sweden with just this
eventuality in mind. I tried them with boiled potato, oatmeal-porridge,
and shredded coconut. Finding I could not get them to eat anything,
I took each one and gave it a little condensed milk, putting it down its
throat with tweezers.
I also put in the cage pieces of the termitary, on which termites were
crawling, and some of the parrots took them and ate them, but only
very few. That was the only thing I could get them to eat voluntarily,
and later, when they must have been even more hungry, they quite
disregarded the termites, even when they crawled right in front of
their beaks.
The behaviour of these little parrots was most interesting. They
lived up to their name of woodpecker parrots, for they moved just as
woodpeckers, liking to jump on the metal netting of the cage and sit
supported by their stiff tail-feathers. They did not climb by moving

one foot at a time as other parrots do, but hopped with both feet; at
once. They drank a lot of water.
They were very inclined to sit in a huddle on the net. When two
met on the net, they nearly always began plucking at each other's
heads with their beaks and in doing so usually made a little noise like
a mouse squeaking. When three or four met on the net, they huddled
together with their heads close. This desire to huddle was probably
due to their habit of spending the night in a cluster in the completely
dark chamber of the termitary.
Though I devoted all my time and care to them, I could not keep
them alive. One of the adults lived for forty hours, and the largest
baby survived for forty-eight hours.
To find out what these parrots eat in the jungle, I have investigated
the contents of their crops. They were filled with an indeterminate
white mass. Heinroth, who observed and collected these birds in
former German New Guinea writes [Journal fiir Ornithologie, 1902,
p. 422) : " One meets the Woodpecker Parrots always in small flocks
on Albizzia procera Benth and on certain places so regularly, that one
can be sure to find them on some trees of this species. Here it lives on
a substance on the tree bark, perhaps a kind of manna."
In the upper reaches of Argon Bay on the south-western part of
Dutch New Guinea, one of my Papuan helpers found my second nest
of Micropsitta. About 100 yards from a mangrove-covered shore
a termitary was built on a large tree only a few yards from the
ground. On my arrival a miniature parrot flew away from the
entrance hole, but after a short while I heard the characteristic sound
of this bird, a low " pseet" and a little parrot appeared near the nest.
It saw me and uttered little warning signals, while it jumped about
between some drooping branches, keeping an eye on me all the time.
This bird was the hen. While she was jumping about, she kept
scraping her beak along the bark, almost as though she was going to
eat it. Then she flew into the hole, which was situated in the lower end
of the termitary and stayed there.
Everything pointed to the parrot having eggs inside. If that were
the case, the cock ought to come and feed the hen and so I expected
that he would come at any moment. One and a half hours later a tiny
parrot suddenly appeared in the gloom beneath the tree. With my
field-glasses I could distinctly see the orange-red patch on the underside
that distinguishes the cock. He saw me, but paid little attention to
my presence and after a couple of hops from one branch near the
termitary to another flew into the hole evidently in order to feed the
hen. After about one minute he had finished, appeared for an instant in
the hole, and then flew into the jungle. After another hour, during which
time the cock did not appear again, it began to rain with tremendous,
violence. When the cloudburst was over I returned to my camp.

<bodyText confidence="0.998549222222222" page_id="56315452"  page_num="" year="" vol="">
The next day I watched the parrots' nest from 13.30 till 18.00.
It was 14.45 before the cock came to feed the hen, so it was obvious
that he did not feed her very often. At 16.40 I saw three parrots by
the nest and immediately afterwards another two, all obviously
intending to go in to spend the night there. Quickly I got my camera
and electron flashlight out and managed to take some pictures of them.
One of the five waiting to go in was the cock. When one of the others
came near him, it began fluttering its wings and then flew after the
cock when he moved. It was obviously begging for food. Suddenly
the cock disgorged some food from his crop and began feeding the
other. Shortly after this I withdrew a few yards and then the little
green dwarfs all flew in, one after the other.
That the cock had fed one of the full-grown birds made it appear
probable that all the parrots, which had foregathered there that
evening belonged to the same big family. Such a family would
probably consist of the parents and their elder offspring not yet of
marriageable age and so still living in the parental home.
That the father and mother allowed them to remain in those
confined quarters, even when the mother was sitting on eggs or had
babies, showed that the relations between children and parents were
very good. That the father, as I had seen, would give his full-grown
children supper, if they were hungry before they went to sleep, also
showed that he had a good heart, small though it might be.
The following afternoon I again spent several hours watching the
parrots' nest, and again I saw five parrots wanting to go in when
bedtime came. One of them was the cock, and he then gave vent to
a sort of suppressed song near the nest. The next day, as I was watching
the nest, I saw two of the parrots begging from the cock simultaneously.
These no doubt were the two chicks of the previous brood. That day
there were six birds round the nest, and the last of them entered it at
17.10. When I later investigated the nest it contained two white eggs.
The third nest I observed was situated eight miles from Sorong.
The termitary was built on a dead tree-trunk and only ij yards
from the ground. As it was rather far from my quarters, I could not
observe this nest as much as I should have liked. The nest was only
used as night-quarters by the parrots. They came regularly to the
nest about one hour or a little more before darkness. Normally the
parrots went into their chamber for the night between 17.00 and 17.30.
I wanted to know when they left the nest in the morning. I therefore
observed this nest from before dawn. At 6.51 a tiny yellow-green
head appeared in the hole. The next moment the bird emerged and
flew straight into a tree and disappeared among the foliage. Within
half a minute two more had left the termitary and also flown straight
into a tree.

and leave it again just before seven in the morning, that gives them
a long night of thirteen or fourteen hours. It is surprising that
especially baby birds can go so long without food.
During my latest journey I also tried to keep Micropsitta living and
one half-grown baby was eating voluntarily a mixture of milk, wheat
flour, sugar, and mashed pawpaw. But this food was obviously not
good for its stomach. After sixty-six hours it died.
How it is possible for a nesting bird to live inside a termitary with
innumerable insects running about everywhere ? Mr. K. A. Hindwood
of Sydney has for many years investigated this problem. In his most
interesting paper " The Nesting of Birds in the Nests of Social Insects "
{The Emu , vol. 59, 1959, p. 1-36) he states that a total of forty-nine
species of birds are known to breed in either terrestrial or arboreal
nests of termites. About the problem of nesting together with termites
he writes : " As the excavation progresses so the termites instinctively
seal the exposed portions of their nest. The galleries facing both the
tunnel and the nesting chamber are thus plugged, so that there is no
actual contact between the birds and the insects. Both are able to
carry out their respective activities without interference, one from
the other. Thus it will be seen that the " problem " of how nesting
birds can live within a termitarium containing hundreds or thousands,
perhaps millions, of insects, is really no problem at all."
Of course this charming little parrot would be very popular in
aviculture, if only we could find some suitable food for it.

216 K. M. SCAMELL - THE BREEDING OF THE DAURIAN REDSTART
THE BREEDING OF THE DAURIAN REDSTART
(.Phoenicurus aurorea aurorea (Pallas))
By Mrs. K. M. Scamell (Newdigate, Surrey, England)
The only two Redstart species which are known to breed in other
than mountainous districts, i.e. the Common Redstart and the
European Black Redstart, are summer visitors to this country and
breed here. However, among the little known Redstarts which
inhabit the mountain ranges of Central Asia is the Daurian Redstart.
In the monograph The Redstart , by John Buxton, it is stated : " The
Asiatic forms of this species do not breed below 10,000 feet and the
Indian Redstart nests up to 17,000 feet in the Himalayas. Hodgson's
Redstart nests at the same height, where it is often found near streams
though, like the Indian Redstart, it also frequents stony hillsides,
whether they are covered in scrub or not. Guldenstad's Redstart is
another species that is often found near water and it is known to
breed at least up to 16,000 feet. The White-throated Redstart inhabits
pine or deciduous forest between 10,000 and 17,000 feet and the other
Redstarts ... all normally nest above 10,000 feet. The Daurian
Redstart and Evermann's Redstart both have a rather wider range
and may also be found rather lower, though these too are mountain
birds. . . . The Daurian Redstart shivers its tail in the same way as
our Redstart. So far as is known, all these birds nest in holes or
niches or crevices, whether in trees or rocks. The Blue-fronted Red-
start is said to feed in the air as well as on the ground and it seems
quite likely that other species also share this habit with the Common
Redstart. However, not very much has been recorded of the habits
of these Redstarts, which is not surprising when we consider the remote
and inaccessible nature of the country where they live."
The breeding areas of the Daurian Redstart are variously reported
as south-eastern Siberia, northern and eastern Mongolia, Manchuria,
North China, North Korea, and North Japan, but wintering is down
to South China. A brief description of this Redstart is as follows :--
Male .--Head and nape silver-grey on black ; upper back, throat,
and upper breast, wings, and centre tail feathers, black ; lower back,
rump, lower breast, and belly, rufous-brown ; tail, deeper rufous-
brown ; white bar on wings.
Female. --Generally, various shades of brown with smaller white
patches on dark brown primaries ; light reddish-brown tail.
Our pair were purchased from S/Ldr. Everitt in April, 1959, and
were stated to be freshly imported from Dr. Searle, in Hong Kong.
They were placed in a small planted aviary which measures 6 by
3 by 6 feet high with a small external shelter attached to one end.
An open-fronted nest-box as well as a budgerigar-type box were located

high up but no nesting was attempted that summer. In late September
the cock was seen to be in very poor condition and both birds were
caught up and separately caged for the winter. In December we
showed the pair in a divided cage at the National where they were
awarded a Third. In late April this year we turned the hen out into
the same little aviary and let in the cock a few days later, together
with a pair of Diamond Doves.
During the last week in June the hen was observed coming from
an open-fronted nest box high up and located over the door and
facing north. At the same time the Diamond Doves abandoned two
eggs on which they had been sitting. It is thought the first egg was
laid about the 26th June but it may have been a day or two earlier.
The nest was cup-shaped and of grasses. The hen was generally off
the nest when one approached the aviary and on the 10th July the
nest was again examined quickly, three eggs but no sign of youngsters,
so I removed the Diamond Doves. The eggs were pale blue with
reddish-brown or brown spots--all different. Another week went by
and it was noticed that the hen was sitting more consistently, but on
the 17th there were still no young but about six or seven eggs were
in the nest. Some of these were examined and one in particular was
quite blotchy with brownish specks over a bluey-green. It seemed,
therefore, that instead of abandoning her first three eggs, the hen had
laid again. On 23rd July I placed my hand in the nest and felt one
youngster--it could have been a day old. A few days later (31st July)
I found a naked dead chick beneath the nest, but from the amount
of fresh ant eggs, cut-up mealworms, and gentles which were being
consumed, I was sure there were three or four more alive in the nest.
The hen alone incubated but the cock was observed to play a large
share of the feeding. On 28th July I saw both the cock and hen
feeding in turn and during the next week such quantities of live food
and insectivorous food were consumed that I thought we must have
four or five youngsters. On Sunday, 7th August, the food consumption
seemed a little less and though we listened we could not hear the
chicks. On this occasion my husband decided to investigate and
almost at once out came three young Daurian Redstarts. They were
all returned, but our experience is that once young birds have left the
nest--even prematurely--it is pretty hopeless trying to return them.
During this time the cock was very excited, making his loud clicking
call. The weather was fine and the three youngsters huddled close
together with their heads turned in one direction almost as if they
were stuffed. In colour they were buffish underneath with spots
extending to throat, wings darkish brown, dark streaked head, tail
reddish, very short.
The next week was uneventful--the three youngsters got stronger
and two of them seemed to roost in the shelter--I didn't like to stay

too near when darkness approached in case I made the final choice
of a roosting site difficult. The third bird kept apart and made no
attempt to fly or climb the netting. The parents neglected it, so on
14th August I removed it with a view to hand-feeding. However, its
feet were badly swollen and inflamed and the inflammation spread
up one leg. In between feeds I kept it in the airing cupboard but it
was dead the next morning. Both parents continued to feed the two
survivors and I had hopes these would be reared. On the 19th August,
however, another youngster was seen to be on the ground and in a
huddle. The other youngster was flying strongly with its parents, who
ignored the weaker bird. This time, therefore, I decided not to wait
before attempting hand feeding. Here again its feet were inflamed
like the first youngster, but it could feed itself in a half-hearted way
and swallowed several small gentles. I mixed chopped hard-boiled
egg and sponge cakes and by the next day the bird seemed brighter
and stronger--even perching. This hand-feeding by means of a
Thomas's " Handfeeder " continued for four days, but the bird died
on 23rd August. I thought its feet were a little better but it went
back after the second day.
The third and last youngster was always with its mother. It perched
with her always and when I was sure it was able to feed itself I decided
to catch it up and cage it, which I did on 3rd September. It is a fine
bird and is now marked as follows :--
The young bird is (nth September) speckled light and dark brown
over the head and chest with a reddish brown tail. The underparts
are drab brown. The wings, being darker brown than those of the
hen, plus a deeper red-brown tail, do, I think, indicate that it is
a cock.
Looking back I wonder if it was the diet or the excessive dampness
which caused the inflamed feet which I think was responsible for the
parents' neglect to feed the two youngsters which died. The grass in
the aviary had grown rank and long in the ten weeks which elapsed
between the first egg and the one survivor being removed from the
aviary.
About 22nd August both parents started to moult--the hen in
particular losing many of her feathers at one time.
As described, Mrs. K. M. Scamell has bred the Daurian Redstart
(Phoenicurus aurorea aurorea). It is believed that this may be a first
success.
Any member or reader knowing of a previous breeding of this
species in Great Britain or Northern Ireland is requested to com-
municate at once with the Hon. Secretary.

By A. H. Isenberg (Portola Valley, California, U.S.A.)
In 1955 one Australian Struthidea was reared after three years of
continued failures. The parents would build one mud nest after
another, laying two to three eggs each time. When the young hatched,
great care was taken of them for four to six days, then the young were
either thrown out or deserted for a new nest. These Struthidea have
been the most aggravating birds I have ever had the pleasure to have
breed. The one young lived with the parents for over a year and a half
when the parents killed it, even though it was helping to incubate
eggs and feed the new young. To-day, the same pair are still at it.
At least four nests per year have been built.
Also in 1955, three Mexican Jilgueros ( Myadestes obscurus) were
raised. I have, in previous issues of the Magazine, related the details.
Two Ptilogonys (Silky Flycatchers--Mexico) were reared and
several White-Eyes (J^osterops simplex ).
In 1956 the most outstanding success was the rearing of one
Australian Regent Bower-Bird. The nest was built rather loosely of
sticks and twigs and two eggs were laid. One egg disappeared but the
other hatched in about fifteen days. The nest was built about 9 feet
up in a thick poplar tree. Shortly after the young left the nest and
was fully on its own, the female died of overeating (heart attack).
I have rarely seen a bird with so much fat on it. She would always,
eat the first five or six mealworms before feeding two or three to the
young. I had cockcroaches, grasshoppers, moths, and mealworms,
but I'm sure I made the grave error of feeding too much too often.
The young bird lived only two months after this. A very great loss
indeed, even though some success was had.
Five common Indian Babblers (. Argya caudata) were raised. These
are sweet little babblers, never belligerent, and when their nest is
approached, or even robbed by another and larger bird, all they do is
plaintively cry about it. I raised one by hand, which is one of the
most affectionate birds I've ever had, and still is even after some
three years.
Five Indian Brown Robins ( Saxicoloides fulicata (Linn.)) were raised,
two males and three females. They nested in a nest-box with a
2-inch hole.
In 1957, three female and two male Turdus cardis (Japan) were
reared in true thrush fashion. The Turdus cardis are wonderful singers.
Their singing period is long, April to September, and some have great
variety in their song.
One Guira Cuckoo was reared after many near successes. The
young would fall out of the huge stick nest and then die from injuries.

even when two weeks old. The Guira Cuckoo is found from Brazil to
Paraguay and Argentina and is a most interesting and odd looking bird.
Only one Mexican Jilguero was reared.
Five Golden Callistes, or Black-cheeked Callistes (C. aurulenta )
(Colombia) were reared in the new greenhouse. They used a wire
nest which they lined with leaves, hair, feathers, etc. The nest was
hidden in a thermostat box.
During these years a number of cc near successes 55 gave some
exciting moments :--White-capped Redstarts, Mesias, Collies Magpie
Jays, Quetzals, Cissas, Piping Crows, Yellow-tufted Honey-eaters,
Spreo Starlings, Ixulus, Chinese Jay-Thrushes, Kookaburras, and
Shamas, all nested and sat on eggs which proved infertile or were
thrown out.
In 1958, Common Babblers reared two, and Shamas reared five,
from three nests in a box in a greenhouse cage about 6 feet long,
4 feet high, and 3 feet deep, built over a deep plant box with
a " jungle " of fig growing in it. My other pair of Shamas, which are
in an outside aviary, hatched numerous young but did not rear any.
In 1959, Smooth-billed Anis hatched several young but only one
was reared by hand--more about these interesting birds in a separate
report. Three Shamas were reared by the greenhouse pair, one male
and two females, and in i960, one male and one female.
Chestnut-bellied Starlings {Spreo pulcher) raised three young.
Golden-winged Sunbirds built a nest but, due to so many other
birds in the aviary, could not cope with the interference.
Red Birds of Paradise nested and laid. Details of this in another
article.

In the course of this year I retired from the position of Director
of the Los Angeles County Museum, having reached the age limit of
seventy, and I had reluctantly to move out of my Californian house.
It was not possible to maintain it as I plan to stay there only two or
three winter months each year, spending the spring and summer at
Cleres, and the autumn in New York, not to speak of many travels.
I deeply regret leaving my garden and aviaries, as it was great fun
to grow exotic plants and to keep birds in this wonderful climate.
I had nine pleasant years in California and I am thankful for the
experience.
Many of my Los Angeles birds have been sent to Cleres, but the
most delicate ones had to be disposed of over here, owing to an
unwelcome one-month quarantine imposed by France on all birds

from the United States and Great Britain because of Newcastle and
other avian diseases prevalent at present in those countries. Obviously,
Sunbirds, Sugarbirds, Tanagers, Trogons, Cotingas, and other
softbills could not have survived it. It was a bitter disappointment.
While California had one of the hottest and driest years ever
recorded, Normandy was very wet, like the rest of Europe, which did
not help in rearing birds. There were, however, at Cleres fourteen
Rheas, one of them white, a Stanley Crane, innumerable Peafowls,
wild Turkeys, and a number of pheasants, including Mikados, Bel's,
Brown Crossoptilons, Sonnerat's, and Ceylon Junglefowls. A cock
Californian Quail, whose wife had died on the nest, took over
incubation duties, hatched and reared two young. A Bobwhite female,
which escaped more than a year ago, and had never been seen since,
was captured in a trap in perfect condition. The most interesting
waterfowl reared were two Australian Radjah Shelducks, Brazilian
and Puna Teal. Since rats have completely disappeared owing to
steady poisoning by warfarin (a wonderful discovery) many young
ducks and teal are now easily reared by the parents on the lake and
other ponds. All that is necessary is to catch them in time for pinioning
and to supply them with food in cages of large mesh wire netting,
accessible to chicks, but not to adults. Many Teal, Carolinas,
Mandarins, Fulvous, and Cuban Whistling Ducks were raised in that
way. Various love-birds and parrakeets nested successfully, and also
doves. A pair of Hyacinthine Macaws laid eggs which did not hatch.
A number of important acquisitions were made during the year,
the first being a pair of Congo Peacocks which the Royal Zoological
Society of Antwerp most kindly loaned us. They look perfect, but
they have not laid yet. We received some good Congo birds from
Charles Cordier : Hartlaub's Ducks, large Hornbills (Ceratogymna
abtrata), Ross' and Schuetti's Touracos, Amethyst Starlings, Black and
Plumed Guineafowls ; White-eared and Knysna Touracos, Rufous
Motmots also came, as well as many geese and ducks.
The aviaries for doves and small birds are now renovated and
improved, and by the next spring, our collection of such birds will be
greatly increased.

SOME BREEDING RESULTS DURING i960 AT
THE EDWARD MARSHALL BOEHM AVIARIES
By Charles Everitt (Trenton, N.J., U.S.A.)
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.903991692307692" page_id="56315462"  page_num="222" year="" vol="">
How true it is that, when dealing with livestock, the simplest thing
in the world is for them to take over control. I fear that this situation
has arisen as far as I am concerned for reference back to my previous
articles on the Boehm Aviaries will show that originally I had planned
to describe the birds kept here aviary by aviary and room by room.
This I subsequently revised and said I would do it species by species.
Now I am making a further change, due to force of circumstances,
but I am sure that, when what is to follow has been digested, my
deviation from the paths I had proposed to tread will be forgiven.
The fact is that, in my opinion, there has been a most encouraging
breeding season this year which portends even greater things when
more of the birds have become fully acclimatized. The reason for my
saying this is that all the species that have been bred successfully have
been here for over twelve months. In a way I am going back to my
original plan of dealing with the birds aviary by aviary, but with the
slight diversion that I shall touch on only those aviaries and rooms
where breedings, or near misses, have taken place, and shall refer to
the various enclosures by the numbers as shown on the plan on
page 113 of the May-June, i960, issue of this magazine.
At the time of writing the descriptive article referred to above,
aviaries numbered 32 to 34 had not been completed, and in any case
the place was still in the grip of winter, so I had had to call upon my
imagination as to what they would look like in the summer months.
How sadly I fell short of the mark. The appearance of all the aviaries
could not be expressed adequately by mere words ; might be hinted
at in black and white stills but, a coloured cine-strip would be more
appropriate. Since it is not possible here to reproduce the latter,
I hope the accompanying plates will provide a better portrayal of the
settings than I could ever convey by other means.
This will be primarily a series of breeding reports covering such
species as Azure-winged Magpies, Black-chinned Yuhinas, Black
Tanagers, Dhyal Birds, Green Cardinals, Magpie Tanagers, Mourning
Doves, Occipital Blue Pies, Variable Tanagers, Pagoda Mynahs, Red-
vented Bulbuls, Rosy Pastor/Pagoda Mynah Hybrids, Silver-eared
Mesias, White-browed Wood Swallows, and Bonaparte Euphonias, and
I shall cover these in their aviary sequence rather than in either an
alphabetical or chronological order. Needless to say there were some
near misses and there are still hopes of additional breedings before the
end of this season.

As I said earlier, I intend to work from the plan of the aviaries,
in numerical order, so now we go over to number 14. Throughout
the winter months the sole occupants had been a pair of Satyr
Tragopans but, towards the end of February this year, the wire screen
and window to Pen No. 12 were removed thus enabling the birds
there free access to the aviary. Their feed and water pans were
retained in the room so as to encourage them to come inside to roost
at night for it was realized that the winter was not fully over. It was
a motley collection of birds consisting of American Blue Jays, American
Robins, Azure-winged Magpies, Cuban Red-legged Thrushes, Purple
and Blue-eared Glossy Starlings, Amethyst Starlings, Virginia
Cardinals, Shining Calornis, Brown-headed Cowbirds, Boat-tailed
Grackles, and last, but not least, " Blackie 55 and his mate. He is
a Crested Mynah given to my wife several years ago by Kenneth
Norris and, not having been able to bring ourselves to part with him,
we brought him with us out here. I must say that his Canadian accent
fits in quite well and he is as affectionate and talkative as ever. But,
back to the main topic. In March we had a real taste of what winter
can be like in these parts for, after a very heavy snowfall of about
12 inches, a cold snap developed and the coldest March night for
eleven years was recorded. This sudden fall in temperature occurred
overnight with no pre-warning. Although access to the heated room
was available, the majority of the birds had taken to sleeping out in
the open and, therefore, a high mortality was feared. The only
casualties, however, were the Shining Calornis and a single American
Blue Jay. The Amethyst and Glossy Starlings seemed to revel in it
and, as for " Blackie ", no bird could have been fitter.
It was during the later part of May that a rough nest of twigs was
noticed being built in a V joint of the aviary framework, right up
against the outside wiring at a height of about 8 feet. Then the
Azure-winged Magpies (Cyanopica cyanus cooki) were seen busying
themselves at it and, on climbing up to inspect it on 30th May, one
olive coloured egg, mottled with brown, was found in the nest. Not
fully trusting the Starlings or the Mynahs, and knowing how
belligerent members of the Magpie family can be at nesting time, it
was thought best to let the Azure-wings have full control. The
remainder were forthwith shepherded back into Room 12 with the
exception of the Tragopans which it was felt would be safe to leave
where they had been all the time. Since both birds looked identical
it was not known whether the Magpies were a pair or not, but at
least it was now clear that there was a female. Incidentally both
of them were in a most disgusting state of feather, all patchy and
sticking out in all directions, just as if they were stuck in the moult.
A further five eggs were laid and, since all the literature immediately
available here only mentioned clutches of three and four eggs, it was

feared that they might both be hen birds. On 19th June, it was
revealed that they were a true pair for the first chick hatched out with
a further one on each of the next three succeeding days. Whether
incubation was shared or not cannot be stated with any certainty
owing to the similarity of the parent birds but it is considered that it
most likely was for, at one part of the day the sitting bird would be
across the nest facing outwards and at other times would be positioned
in the opposite direction. As no more hatched and the last born died
on the 25th, the remaining two eggs were removed and found to be
addled. They measured 26 by 20 mm., and were then seen to be
more of a buff colouring than an olive, with heavy splotches of umber
mainly at the thicker end. The chicks were about the ugliest possible--
dark skinned, completely bare, and with great flat heads. A slight
improvement could be seen when the eldest was five days old and
quill feathers began to appear, and it looked even better the following
day when it had its eyes open. By the end of ten days, despite the day's
difference in their ages, they appeared to have levelled up and it was
hard to detect which was the first-born. By this time dark wing-
feathers and brownish body plumage was showing. Even at this stage,
on first looking into the nest all one could see were three great yellow
gapes and it was only when they realized that no food was forthcoming
that they closed them and made it possible to see their feathering.
All came on very well and it was decided that the diet of minced
beef-heart, egg-mix, blueberries, apple, meal-worms, and baby mice
must be satisfactory for them. On 7th July, twenty days after the
hatching of the first young bird, all three left the nest. When they
were caught up for banding it was observed that the general body
colour was a buffish-brown with blue showing in the wings and outer
tail-feathers. Their heads were grey streaked with black and the bill
and legs a leaden colour. Both parents fed the chicks but, I fear, we
are no nearer to sexing them for even their calls are the same. Now,
at eight weeks old, the caps of the young birds are black, as with the
adults, and the blue in the wings and tail is of the same intensity as
the mature birds although the overall body colour is not so deep.
All three have the same raucous cry of their parents so, with five of
them at it, you can imagine the racket at feeding time. There is one
thing at least in which they differ and that is that all the young birds
are sleek in feather whereas the older birds are as ragged looking as
they were when they first went to nest.
Well, so much for Aviary No. 14 and now we will move along to
No. 17 in which there are a pair of Eastern Mourning Doves
(Zenaidura macoura ). This is a local species of dove, the female having
been here for about two years, but it was not until February this year
that a mate was obtained for her. They are easily sexable, as adults,
for the male has a purplish metallic collar which feature is entirely

lacking in the female. They were out during the snow, and the cold
snap mentioned earlier, but were not affected in any way. An open
type nest-box with a sloping roof was hung up in flight early in April
with a coil of alfalfa hay in the bottom of it. It was quickly accepted
and the first egg was laid on 17th April, with a second the next day.
They were typical dove's eggs, plain white and measuring 30 by 24 mm.
The incubation was shared, the male doing the late morning to early
afternoon shift, but only one young hatched out on 4th May, the
other egg having been damaged in some way. As with the incubation,
the rearing also was shared and the squab soon feathered up and left
the nest on 16th May. As soon as it did so they ignored it completely
and it died the following day. With no signs of remorse the hen went
to nest again and on 20th May, there were two more eggs in the box.
This time there was no fooling and two fine birds left their nest on
17th June, and were reared to full independance within ten days.
A third clutch appeared on 29th June, so, to be on the safe side, the
two young birds were removed to the adjoining aviary, No. 16, where
there were Emerald-spotted and Tambourine Doves together with
some other seedeaters. This third clutch hatched on 16th July, but did
not progress as well as the others. One was picked up dead on 25th July,
and, although the other left the nest two days later, it was not so well
feathered as the others had been and, even now at one month old, is
very tatty in appearance. The female actually laid again on
nth/i2th August in the seed pan, having arranged a few twigs in
there since the box had been removed by then. Although these eggs
and the twigs were taken out another two appeared on 22nd/23rd
August. There is no knowing how long this will be going on but it is
not intended to allow them to have another round this season. Both
the young birds of the successful round still resemble the female in
general colouring and there is no sign of the masculine collar showing
up on either of them. Though not a very colourful dove they are
distinctive by their long pointed tail, the white spots on which show
up prominently in flight. The general colouring is a cinnamon-brown
with black bars on the wings and a black spot behind the eye. With
the exception of the collar, all other marks are the same in both sexes.
Although the next breeding took place in Aviary No. 18, there is
a prelude to it. In Aviary No. 36 there used to be three specimens of
the Magpie Tanager (Cissopsis leveriana), which had been there since
the previous year. This is a fairly large tanager, black and white in
main colouring but possessing a bright yellow eye and a short, black,
hawk-like bill. Sexes are similar and, as with the Azure-winged
Magpies, it was not known if there was a pair or not. However, early
in April one was observed carrying nesting material and on 3rd April,
one of them killed another. Working on the assumption that during
the breeding season they are territorial, the remaining two were

caught up and placed in Aviary No. 18 on their own. For quite a while
this seemed to have been a wasted effort and it was not until June that
the carrying process again started. However, by 7th June, they had
completed a rather untidy construction of fine twigs, pine needles,
and coarse grass, the whole being lined with dead Dogwood tree
leaves and it was located about 4J feet up in a Canadian Hemlock
tree. The first egg was laid on 9th June, and a second the following
day. They were of a creamy-buffish colour heavily marked with
streaks and blotches of dark brown. Incubation may have been
shared, but this is not certain since both birds look exactly alike and
it is not possible to differentiate between them. Anyway, he, she,
they, which ever it was, sat steadily and, on 22nd June, two chicks
were seen in the nest. The young birds had pinkish bodies covered
with a light brown fluff and their gapes were a deep orange. The
following day one of them was found on the ground but, still showing
signs of life after being held in the hands for a few moments, was
replaced in the nest. However, the rearing of the two was not to be,
for on the 24th one only remained and there was no trace of the other.
The fact that both parents took part in the rearing of this sole survivor
is known for each bird actually was seen in the act of feeding the
youngster which progressed well, quill feathers were showing at five
days, and its eyes were open. It continued to feather up rapidly in
a black and white pattern similar to that of the parents and, on 7th July,
left the nest. Within forty-eight hours it was very active in the trees
and bushes and was a miniature of the adults except that the bill was
flatish and the eyes grey. The hook shape of the bill was not fully
realized until it was twenty-one days old, by which time its tail was
fully grown, but the eyes remained grey. It is now over two months
old and still no change in the eye colouring has taken place and it is
only this feature, plus the ring on its leg, which enables it to be
distinguished from its parents. Realizing that the colour of the eye is
a minimum age indicator, careful watch is being maintained for the
first signs of a change and further information on this point will be
given in due course. The rearing food mainly consisted of fruit plus
minced beef-heart, egg-mix, flies, and grubs caught by the parents,
which live food was supplemented by regular issues of mealworms.
It is now time to turn the corner and proceed to Aviary No. 21
where, although by no means a " first " breeding was achieved, it
was, nevertheless, a most interesting one. The sole occupants are a pair
of Occipital Blue Pies (Kitta crythrothyntha magnirostris ), which in 1959
had three fertile eggs. These, however, became damaged and no
further effort was made by them that year. On 30th April this year
an egg was laid in a nest of rough twig construction they had made up
in a shallow open basket which had been fixed in a wild apple tree.
Actually it was the same site as they had selected the previous year.

Three eggs were laid in all but the female, which was the only one to
be seen sitting at any time, was very unsteady and came off at the
slightest provocation. Unfortunately there was an abundance of
disturbance at this period as a new pipe line for water was being laid
alongside the aviary they occupied. When she appeared to have
deserted the nest for good the eggs were removed and found to be
addled.
Early in June she was observed to be sitting again and, on looking
into the nest, another three eggs were found. It was just about now
that the male bird developed a resentment of intruders and, even at
feeding time, used to swoop down and strike at whoever ventured into
the aviary. Hence no more visits were made to the nest and all further
observation had to be conducted from above the roof. When such an
excursion was made a week later it was seen that there were now six
eggs. The first hatched on 22nd June, and another chick appeared
each day for the next four days making a total clutch of five. The
last egg had disappeared two days later but no attempt was made to
enter the aviary to look for it for, by now, both parents were most
aggressive and it was not advisable to take their feed in without the
wearing of a head covering. I will not go into details regarding
feathering of the chicks, etc., for this species of bird has been bred
several times before and full details of the development of the young
have been given in other write-ups. However, I have not been able to
trace any report of five young Occipital Blue Pies being hatched and
reared to independance from one nest. They are now over two months
old and are almost as big as their parents. Their bills and legs are
beginning to turn red but the white crest of the adult birds is not yet
showing up. It is felt that this may constitute a record breeding of the
species so far as quantity is concerned and any information on this
point would be greatly appreciated.
So far, all the breedings that have been mentioned have occurred
with pairs that have had an entire aviary to themselves but, those to
follow were all in mixed aviaries as will be seen. Passing by the Parrot
House and the Cockatoo aviaries, where incidentally Redrump
Parrakeets and Peach-faced Lovebirds were bred, and continuing on
by the Sunbirds' and Starlings' aviaries we eventually reach No. 34,
Brookside Aviary, so named from the stream that runs through it.
The main occupants, all released into there late in April this year,

consisted of Tanagers, Trogons, Pittas, Fruitsuckers, Orioles, Ruby-
throats, Wagtails, Hoopoes, and White-capped and Plumbeous
Redstarts. The Tanagers included Golden-masked, Silver-throated,
Yellow-browed, Pretre's, Scarlet, Black, Golden-naped, Scarlet-
rumped, and Variable, more commonly known as Orange-rumped.
The Golden-masked, or Mrs. Wilson's, were the first to go to nest
closely followed by the Silver-throated but, although both species had

eggs and began to sit, all the eggs had disappeared about a week later.
The Yellow-browed are suspects for being responsible for the removal
of the eggs, but nothing definite has been decided on this point. The
third pair to get busy were the Variable Tanagers (Ramphocelus
flammigerus ), which took seven days in the construction of a nest of
rootlets, pine-needles, and grasses, lining it with fibres from shredded
sisal string and soft, fine grasses. It was an open cup-nest measuring
11 cm. across the top with a cup of 6 cm. wide and 4 cm. in depth.
The location was 3 feet up in a Canadian Hemlock tree close to the
entrance door from the corridor running behind the bird room. On
17 th May, one egg was seen in the nest and there was a second the
following day. They were sky-blue with irregular black dots, mostly
at the thicker end and measured about 23 by 17 mm., although this
is but an estimate since they were not removed for examination.
Although the male assisted in the construction of the nest, the
incubating was left entirely to the female. On 29th May, two chicks,
dark skinned and covered with a grey fluff were in the nest and, on
approaching them, it could be seen that their gapes were red with
orange streaks running fore and aft. Beyond setting up a special
feeding tray for live-food for them, no other precautions were taken
for the hazards in the form of the running stream connecting two
deep pools and the variety of other birds in the aviary were too
complex to be guarded against fully. As it was, all went well with the
chicks although there was a tragedy in that four of the Yellow-browed
Tanagers were killed at this time. It was not until the fourth death
that it was realized that the male Variable Tanager was the killer.
Fourteen days after hatching the chicks left the nest and, in feathering,
resembled the female being dark on the upper-parts with pale lemon
underparts. The bills, however, were black and not the silvery shade
of the parents. One seemed to be much slower in getting about than
the other and eventually died at seven weeks old. The other became
fully independant and the change in the colouring of the bill occurred
when it was sixty-one days old. In the meantime the female had
constructed another nest, also in a Hemlock but this time on the other
side and farther up in the aviary. Again two eggs were laid which
hatched out on 8th and 9th July, which indicates that incubation
began with the laying of the first egg. One of these chicks disappeared
from the nest after four days with no trace but the other has reached
full independance and the parents now have two more chicks, ten
days old at the time of this being written, in a nest built on the site of
the first one.
In between the first two breedings of the Variable a pair of Black
Tanagers (Tachyphonus coronatus) had built a nest in a Clethra alnifolia
bush and they had three eggs, laid on the 24th June and the two
succeeding days. It was a smaller nest than the Variable's, being only

9 cm. across the top, but it was deeper having a cup of 7 * 5 cm. The
main nesting materials employed were pieces of twine and coarse
grasses for the exterior with finer grasses and dog's hair for the lining.
Here again the male took no part in the incubation but, on 8th July,
twelve days after the laying of the third egg, three chicks, dark skinned
with a black fluff, were found in the nest. Their gapes were similar in
colour to those of the Variable's young. The eggs, however, were
entirely disimiliar in appearance being of a pinkish shade with golden
brown fleckings. Although the male had not assisted in the incubation
he certainly realized his responsibilities now the youngsters had arrived
and was most conscientious in his care of them during the rearing,
and defended his special live-food tray as effectively as any of the
other birds in similar circumstances had done. They all left the nest
at what seemed an extremely early age, i.e. nine days, but were soon
rounded up for ringing when it was observed that their general plumage
was rufous brown, resembling the adult female. Unfortunately this
breeding of Tachyphonus coronatus cannot be listed as fully successful
for two of the chicks were killed by the Variable male on 29th July,
only twenty-one days old, and the third was a victim of a tropical
storm which struck on the 30th. Since then, both the adult Black
Tanagers whose nesting is referred to above, together with another
pair of the same species also in that aviary, have all been killed by
the same male Orange-rumped Tanager. To say that his days in
there are numbered should not be wondered at but he has earned
a reprieve in that he has a further two chicks, just hatched out, to rear.
Every effort will be made to trap him but, if this proves impracticable
due to the number of other birds in there, more drastic methods may
have to be resorted to.
Although we have nearly reached the end of the aviaries shown on
the plan, it is by no means near the end of the breedings. In Aviary
No. 36, the original domicile of the Magpie Tanagers, referred to
earlier, there were two pairs each of White-browed Wood Swallows
and Yellow-naped Ixulus, a pair each of Black-chinned Yuhinas,
Golden-winged Sunbirds, and Black-headed Sugar-birds and singlet
Purple and White-bellied male Sunbirds, a Black-headed Bunting,
a Blue-headed Rock Thrush, and a Yellow-cheeked Tit. The Wood
Swallows (Artamus superciliosos) had been in there about eighteen
months and, early in May, one of the males was seen to be feeding
a female which, in turn, was carrying pieces of nesting material.
Up to now all four birds had roosted together in the same tree but
events indicated that, so far as nesting was concerned, they are not
gregarious for, on 5th May, one male, not the one that had been
making up to the hen, was found killed. The odd female was caught
up and transferred to the Starlings' aviary without further delay The
remaining pair now got down to real business and built a shallow

open nest of grasses in a Viburnum prunijloria tree--Black Haw. It was
quite a small nest for the size of bird, being only 42 mm. across the top
with an overall depth of 59 mm. and a cup of 25 mm. deep. Two eggs,
olive-green, heavily marked with dark brown splotches, thickest at
the larger end, were laid on 17th and 18th May. Unlike the Variable
and Black Tanagers mentioned earlier, here the incubation was shared,
and most zealously too, for as soon as one left the nest the other took
over. Incubation began with the laying of the first egg and on
29th and 30th May the chicks hatched out. They were light skinned
with a covering of blackish-grey fluff and the gapes were bright yellow.
As assidious as the incubation had been so was the rearing, for both
parents were continually hawking insects and were most partial to
mealworm pupae. They were not so interested in the mealworms
themselves and only took them when they realized that the supply of
pupae must have run out. The entire rearing appears to have been
done with live-food and both chicks left the nest on the same day,
13th June. They never looked back from that moment and gradually
acquired the general colouring of the adult female's underparts, a pale
mauvish-brown, although the mantle and wing-butts retained the
white fleckings on a grey background which had been their overall
colouring when they left the nest. On 30th June the female laid
again, in the same nest with very little tidying up, and a second egg
was produced the following day. As the young birds were now feeding
themselves it was decided to remove them to the adjoining aviary and
leave the parents to get on with their second round. This also was
successful and two chicks, exact replicas of the earlier ones, left the
nest on 28th July, and these also are now independant. Neither of the
older two youngsters have entirely lost fleck-markings nor are they
showing the white eye stripe yet. The underparts are the same colour
as the adult female but, whether they are hens or not cannot at the
moment be stated with any surety. It has been noticed that one of
the new chicks appears to be darker underneath than the other but
it is early days yet to make any decision regarding the final sexing of
the four young birds. It is hoped that one at least is a male so as to
provide a mate for the odd adult female now in the other aviary.
If such is the case it could afford the opportunity of building up a
strain of these most attractive Australian Swallows for, under the
existing restrictions on the export of avifauna from Australia, it
would be extremely difficult to introduce new blood.
At the same time as the Wood Swallows started on their second
round the Black-headed Sugarbird female was busy nest building in
a Fir tree and eventually laid two eggs, one on 3rd July and the other
on the 4th. However, both disappeared on the 5th, and the Black-
chinned Yuhinas (Tuhina nigrimentum intermedia) had then begun a war
on the Yellow-naped Ixulus. It was no idle skirmish for they got all

<bodyText confidence="0.991131733333333" page_id="56315473"  page_num="231" year="" vol="">
four of them, one by one, down in a corner of the aviary from which
there was no means of escape. Fortunately the first assault was seen
and it was possible to rescue the Ixulus, as cornered, and place them
in another aviary. The entire affair was over in less than an hour
which gives some indication of the thoroughness of the Yuhinas for
all their victims had to be sought out from amongst the dense bushes
in there. That the latter birds had a serious intent was realized when
they were observed mating and tidying up a hand-made nest of fine
grasses that had been suspended just below the roofing wire. It is felt
that they were responsible for the loss of the Black-headed Sugarbirds'
eggs and the fact that the Swallow's were not touched was undoubtedly
due to the fact that they were never deserted whereas, with the
Sugarbirds, it was only the female which sat on the eggs and, therefore,
they were left unguarded every time she came off to feed or bathe.
The Yuhinas laid four eggs, the first on nth July, the clutch being
completed by the 14th. They were very small and, although not
removed for measuring, were seen to be a dull pale blue with brown
spots. On 24th July it was realized that there were chicks in the nest
so, in view of the seasonal rainstorms, a solid covering was fixed above
the nest. Whilst this was being done it was the only time possible
actually to see into the nest when it was observed that the newly
hatched birds had very dark skins covered with a brown fluff and
their gapes were the same salmon-pink shade as with the adult birds.
From that time on it was only by watching the parent birds taking
live-food to the nest that any progress of the chicks could be judged.
Two of them must have died early on for, after nine days, the female
was seen to drag one out of the nest and drop it to the ground. When
it was picked up it was seen that it must have been dead about
twenty-four hours. It was well feathered with a mantle of dark brown,
a lighter shade in the wings, and the flanks a gingery shade. There
was a dark fuzz on the head indicating the forming of a crest. On
4th August, twelve days after hatching, the one remaining chick left
the nest. This was completely feathered with a grey cap and a distinct
black spot on the chin. In other respects it resembled the young bird
described above. Both parents fed the youngster and it was observed
that live-food only was employed in the rearing. Thinking that small
mealworms would be better for them, these were placed in their
feeding tray but were completely ignored in favour of the larger ones
fed to the other inmates. It was not long before the chick was flying
well and a crest had begun to form. The parents then built another
nest themselves on a ledge just below the guttering of the main bird
room which forms one end of the flight and laid three eggs which
hatched out on 23rd August. The female did most of the incubating
of this second round whilst the male bird was busy weaning off their
first youngster. Again it was not possible to see into the nest so the

progress of the chicks could only be judged as before, by watching
the amount of live-food taken up by the parents. Visits to the nest by
the parent birds ceased entirely on 30th August, and, on climbing up
to the nest it was revealed to be empty and there was no trace of any
of the young birds. The final score with Yuhinas, therefore, remains
at one only.
We will now go on to the last of the aviaries shown on the plan.
No. 37, where five successful breedings were recorded out of the
sixteen pairs housed there. In all a total of thirty-two different species
is in there but it is only in sixteen cases that it is known there are true
pairs. The species are made up of Knysna and Purple-crowned

Tern. The entire aviary is thickly planted with trees such as Dogwood,
Canadian and Carolina Hemlocks, Weeping Birch, Crab Apple, and
Tulip, with shrubberies of Rhododendrons, Azaleas, and several local
plants and heathers with a central lake of about 20 by 16 feet which
is fed by a decorative waterfall. It was hoped that the expanse of the
aviary, 68 by 42 feet with a maximum height of 26 feet, coupled with
the amount of coverage provided, would be conducive to breeding
despite the number of species of birds in there. In order to give an
initial incentive to the Starlings, and such other birds that might care
to make use of them, a number of roofed, open-type nest-boxes were
hung at strategic places on the wire surround. The first to show any
desire to nest were the Sulphury Tyrants which built a nest in a
Carolina Hemlock overhanging the waterfall. Although four eggs
were laid and the female seemed to sit well, nothing materialized and
since then they have made two further efforts, all with the same
negative results.
The first family to be raised was by the Red-vented Bulbuls
(Molpostes cafer ), who had made their nest in the top of a Canadian
Hemlock, about 8 feet above ground level. The building of the nest
had been watched but it was not possible to say exactly when the eggs
were laid, how many were in the clutch, or the actual date of hatching.
However, it was on 8th June that the parent birds were observed
taking food to the nest and then three red gaping mouths could be
seen reaching up for it. On 20th June all three left the nest and, on
being caught up for ringing, it was seen that their plumage was dark

like their parents, signs of a crest were visible with the underparts and
undertail coverts being white. There was no showing of any red at
the vent and this did not appear until they were ten weeks old. Since
then they have had two more nests, the first producing but one chick
with two in the second and last. At the outset there were three Red-
vented Bulbuls in this aviary but, even with the young birds now
flying about freely, there has been no sign of any quarrelling amongst
them. A little bit of bickering now and again but no fighting as had
occurred with the Brown-eared Bulbuls which had resulted in the loss
of one of them.
The next pair to be family-minded were the Silver-eared Mesias
(.Leiothrix argentauris ), of which there was one male to three females.
He and his chosen built their nest in an Azalea bush and it was
suspended from the slender stalks by pieces of twine, which material
was used also in conjunction with grasses for the outside of the
structure, the lining being of finer grasses and dog's hair. It was an
open cup nest, 84 mm. across the top with a cup of 65 mm. deep.
The first egg was laid on 12 th June, with two more on the immediate
succeeding days. They were pale blue with reddish-brown splashes,
mainly at the thicker end, and measured 21 by 14 '5 mm. Incubating
was shared and began with the laying of the first egg, one chick being
hatched on 26th June, with another the next day. The third egg
when removed later was found to be addled. The coloration of the
chicks has been described many times before but, when the two left
the nest, it was surprising to see that they were sexable by the colouring
of the rump feathers even at that early age. Now they are two months
old there can be no possible doubt of their sexes. It was intriguing to
see the two spinster Mesias and the Pekin Robin female all feeding
the young birds with no signs of objection by their parents. In fact,
when the pair went to nest again, the Pekin hen took over the two
young ones entirely. There were five eggs in this second round of
which four hatched. These all left the nest in due time but, unfortu-
nately, they were greeted by a terrific rainstorm during which three
perished leaving a female as the sole survivor. The parents are now
on their third round having three eggs which are due to hatch in the
next few days. With one male and two females so far raised it is to be
hoped that this third round will produce more males so as to balance
up the sexes a bit more for, although another adult male has been
acquired since, the masculine sex is still outnumbered.
Whilst the Red-vented Bulbuls were rearing and prior to the
nesting of the Silver-eared Mesias, the Dhyal Birds and Pagoda
Mynahs had selected two of the nest-boxes mentioned earlier.
Although not in the strict sequence of events I will deal with the
Dhyal Birds (Copsychus saularis) first. These had three eggs, pale
green with reddish-brown streaks and spots, the larger end being

almost obscured. It was assumed that the first egg was laid on
5th June, for two were found on the 6th, and the third was there the

following day. However, all the eggs disappeared and it was not
until 25th June that the female laid again. There were three eggs as
before which hatched out on 8th, 9th, and 10th July. Whether
incubation had been shared or not was hard to tell for it was not
possible to catch either bird going into or leaving the nest-box. It was
situated in such a position that it could not be seen until one had
circumvented a Dogwood tree, whereas the birds had warning of
anyone's approach by the opening and shutting of the aviary doors.
However, as soon as the chicks were born, both birds shared the
rearing of them. It was just after this that the male bird got out, due
to a door being left open, and he was away for six days before being
trapped and restored to his family. He had been in the neighbourhood
all the time and regularly used to come for the mealworms put out
for him. All the same it was nearly a week before he made that one
step that enabled him to be caught. It was an anxious moment when
he was returned to the aviary but all fears were quickly dispelled
when he snapped up a mealworm and promptly took it up to the nest
to feed the young birds. There did not seem to be a great show of
emotion on the part of the female on his return but, after being away
on the spree for a week, who could blame her. On 24th and 25th July
the young had all left the nest and, when caught up for ringing, it was
observed that their breasts were whitish, flecked with brown with the
rest of the underparts clear white. The mantle was dark brown and
the wings showed a considerable amount of white and reddish-brown
producing a tortoiseshell effect. It seemed uncanny the way rain-
storms would break just after young birds had left the nest for, as with
the Black Tanagers and the Mesias, this happened again on the 26th,
and three of the baby Dhyal birds perished. The third, however, is
now fully independent. Although the parents went to nest again,
this time having five eggs, all of these failed to hatch. In both instances
it has been noticed that the hen lays her eggs in the far back corner
of the box on the bare board, entirely clear of the grasses that had
been put in there in the first place. Still, she was not alone in this
habit as will be seen from the following account.
There were four Pagoda Mynahs (Temenuchus pagodarum) in this
aviary but, due to their similiarity in appearance, it was not at all
a certainty that there was a pair amongst them. Needless to say, the
more they were studied the more differences seemed to show up, but
it had to be left to the birds themselves to prove things. This they
duly did for, on 1st June, three plain blue eggs were discovered in
another of the nest-boxes located at the far end of the aviary. These
eggs also were reposing in the back far corner of the box completely
clear of the grass. On 13th June two chicks hatched out and the third

egg just vanished. They were bare of all baby fluff and looked very
weak. Two days later one of them was missing from the nest, and the
second was gone the following day. The same pair returned to this
box later in the month and on 29th June another three eggs were
found in it. Again only two hatched but these, although bare like
the others, looked much more vigorous. The date of this hatching
was 7th July. Whilst all this had been going on, a rough nest of twigs
was noticed being built at the opposite end of the aviary, up against
the wall of the bird room. It was lodged on a branch of a Dogwood
tree which was within 4 inches of the wall with the guttering immedi-
ately above. The birds responsible for this construction were either
the Rosy Pastors (.Pastor roseus ) or the other pair of Pagodas, for both
species of bird was always busy round there although it seemed to be
but one of each type. Three plain blue eggs, undistinguishable from
those of the Pagoda Mynah, were found in the nest on the same day
as the discovery of the three in the Pagoda's nest at the other end.
Then it was seen that at one time of the day the male Rosy Pastor
would be on the nest and would be replaced by a Pagoda Mynah.
Two chicks hatched out here, also on 7th July, but this time they
seemed to be slightly larger, darker skinned, and did have some
dusky fuzz on their bodies. As they grew it was concluded that they
were hybrid Rosy Pastors/Pagoda Mynahs for both the male Pastor
and a Pagoda did all the feeding and kept the remaining bird of each
species well away from the nest. The chicks left the nest on 22nd July,
and they were very large, completely disimiliar to the young Pagoda
Mynahs which came out two days later. There was no doubt as to
their parentage of these latter birds for they were replicas of the adult
Pagodas in colouring except that it was a little paler and, instead of
a black cap, they had brown feathering on their heads. The hybrids,
however, were a smoky-grey on the mantle with lighter underparts
and a dark cap but could not, at this stage, be said to resemble either
parent in colour. The male Pastor ceased to tend to them six days
after leaving the nest and began associating with his own female once
more. By this time the young birds were bigger than their mother
who had to make quite an effort when reaching up to get food in their
ever open mouths. They are now nearly two months old and are
almost as big as the Pastor. Their plumage is of a general sandy
colour with dark markings on the wings and there is a semblance of
a dark collar forming on the upper breast. Their heads have turned
no darker than when they left the nest and, to date, have shown no
signs of a crest forming. Why this hybridization should have occurred
is just another of those strange ways of nature since, as stated before,
both species had true mates available.
This marks the end of the breedings in outside avaiaries with the
exception of a Green Cardinal which was bred in a small aviary,

away from the main buildings, that also contained pairs of Rose-
breasted Grosbeaks and Bleeding-heart Doves with an odd Spotted-
breasted Oriole. Two eggs had been laid and hatched out but one
of the chicks was thrown out of the nest at nine days old. The survivor
is now more than two months old and in general colouring resembles
the adult female except that the underparts bear far more streaks.
In addition to the near misses already mentioned in the preceding
survey of the out-door aviaries, a pair of Indian Hoopoes nested in
a hollow tree but, after the laying of the third egg, the hen was found
dead on the ground. A similar tragedy occurred with an Amethyst
Sunbird hen but, in this case, only one egg had been laid. Complete
nests were also built by pairs of Bengal Pittas, Baltimore Orioles, and
Palm Tanagers but, beyond that stage, nothing else happened in
these cases.
There were two more breeding attempts that took place within the
confines of the bird room. The first relates to a pair of Scarlet-breasted
Sunbirds (Chalcomitra senegalensis gutturalis ), which took to a nest in the
room depicted on the plate facing page 115 of the May/June issue.
The male bird that can be seen in that photograph actually bred in
1958 when one youngster was reared to maturity. Unfortunately the
original female had escaped from the room so another was introduced
early this year. The pair went to nest laying one egg on 1st May,
which hatched out on the 14th, but the chick was thrown out of the
nest the following day. Female sunbirds appear to be unlucky in this
room for this second one was killed in an accident when the door of
the room was blown open during a wind storm and she was caught
between the door and the lintel as it swung back into position. I feel
I cannot leave this subject without saying something about the change
in the colour of the breast of the male bird that has taken place.
On my arrival here in December, 1959, it was orange, having faded
as is so often the case with this species when kept in captivity.
However, when it moulted out this year, red feathers could be seen
coming through the orange and now the bird has a breast as scarlet as
that of a newly imported specimen and all the feathers are blue tipped
as is customary. No special colour food was given and it is felt that it
can be attributed to the surfeit of live-food in the way of fruit and
other forms of flies which is always in their room.
The second indoor effort was by a pair of Bonaparte Euphonias
(Tanagra lauta ) and this took place in room No. 6 and, although it
cannot be recorded as a complete success, I do feel that the following
account will be of interest. There are several species of Euphonias,
members of the Tanager family, kept here including the Pectoral,
Lessons's, Blue-headed, Tawny-bellied, and Bonaparte. The majority
on initial arrival were immature birds and, in many instances, it was
a case of waiting until they came into colour before they could be

definitely identified and paired up. Needless to say there were, from
the exhibitor's point of view only, defective birds amongst them
suffering from such faults as scarred foreheads, hipped wings, claws
missing, etc. However, so far as the aviculturist is concerned, the
prime necessity is for fit and healthy birds and, provided the blemish
will not in any way affect the propagation of the species, defects of
the nature described above are no great handicap. All birds that
arrive here, irrespective of their limitations to be perfect models for
Mr. Boehm to sculpt, are given exactly the same treatment and no
differentiation is made. In a shipment of Euphonias received early
this year there was a female Bonaparte, that had a badly hipped wing,
and a number of immature males. None of these birds were released
into the outside aviaries but were housed in pens in the main bird-
house. Early in May it was observed that a young male and the
hipped wing female were always together and that they were picking
up the larger pieces of wood chippings to be found in the sawdust
floor covering and endeavouring to fix them together at the base of
one of the " trees " into which the perches were secured. The other
birds being caught up and transferred to another room, a potted
shrub was placed in the Euphonias' pen with a hand-made nest
secured within its foliage. Further, following the reading of a detailed
account of the nesting of Lesson's Euphonias in the wild that had
taken place in an Orchid plant, such a plant, in a pot, was suspended
from the roof of the pen hanging about 5^ feet above ground level.
Another artificial nest was fixed in this since it was felt that, even if
they did not take to the nests provided, they would at least be a source
of supply of nesting materials should they decide to construct one
themselves. There was no need for conjecture so far as the male was
concerned for he promptly began to dismantle the one in the shrub
and to begin building immediately below the one that had been
placed in the Orchid. The female soon began to assist and, using the
other nest as part of the roof, they quickly had a domed structure in
position. On 21st May one egg, white with umber blotches heavily
concentrated at the thicker end and measuring 16 by 12*5 mm., was
found in the nest. This egg, however, disappeared on 10th June, the
only trace of it being a few minute pieces of eggshell on the floor of
the flight. Hopes rose again when they began to rebuild the nest on
13th June, making a much more robust job of it and, on 19th June,
another egg was laid with a second the following day.
According to the report on the Lesson's referred to above, the
incubation period for that species was anything up to sixteen days
with some twenty-four to twenty-eight days before the chicks left the
nest. Both these timings seemed very lengthy for such small birds but
events were to show that the Bonapartes more or less conformed to
these figures. On 5th July, one egg had disappeared, this time leaving

no trace, but the following day the other hatched. The tiny pink body
with a very broad head was covered with a dark fluff. Although the
female had done all the incubating the male certainly did his part now
for he was continually to and from the food-tray with scraps of grape
and banana for the youngster. Despite there being a plentiful supply
of fruit-flies, small maggots and mealworms in the room, neither bird
was ever seen to feed any of these to the chick and, for the first six
days, it had nothing but fruit. After that they were noticed taking
little pieces of minced beef-heart to it but the main diet still continued
to be fruit. This was one of the few instances where quill-feathers
were not visible at five days, for it was not until the 14th that any
sign of feather formation could be seen although the original body
fluff had worn off when it was but three days old. By 20th July, when
it was fourteen days old, there was quite a showing of dark green
feathering on the mantle with black in the wings. By this time it was
moving about in the nest quite a bit, but there was no fear of it hurting
itself if it fell out for precautions had now been taken against a repeti-
tion of what could have been a fatal accident. When it was but two
days old the female left the nest rather hurriedly one morning and
the chick fell to the floor. Fortunately it was seen to happen so it was
possible to replace it in the nest without any delay. To guard against
any recurrence, a wire landing stage, covered with hessian, was rigged
to hang about 6 inches below the base of the pot containing the
Orchid. No call was made on it however until the chick left the nest
on 31st July, twenty-five days after hatching. Prior to this two further
eggs had been laid on the 26th and 27th, which also tied up with the
findings on the Lesson's in the wild. Unfortunately, as inferred above,
this cannot finish as a complete success story for both these last two
eggs disappeared on 5th August, and the chick was found dead on its
landing-stage the following morning. Although it was exactly one
calendar month old it had been out of the nest but seven days. I have
not been able to locate any references to previous breedings of the
Bonaparte Euphonia in captivity and any information on this would
be appreciated.
For ease of reference, a summary of the successful breedings and
other attempts this season, together with the position as at 18th Sep-
tember, i960, is appended below.

Oakwood is, of course, a London suburb and like most of such is
being " developed Maisonettes, mostly privately owned, are
springing up and as a result there is a great increase in the local cat
population. Our garden is seemingly very attractive to them and we
very often have a regular clowder. In the past we have been able to
" control " them, especially the semi-feral variety, but now there are
several very nice ones, including a Siamese and a white long-haired,
so we just have to suffer them. In addition, we have quite a few
Tawny Owls. Some evenings as many as five or six may be seen in
the trees and on the chimneys. Neither of these nuisances, the cats or
the owls, is conducive to good breeding results. They do have a very
great nuisance value but we cannot say with any certainty that they
have been responsible for any casualties amongst the birds. We have
had no cracked skulls and none, as our aviary attendant succinctly puts
it, has been " skunned 55 . But these are but some of the trials and
tribulations to be expected by the present-day suburban aviculturist.
By far the worst trouble we experienced was on Good Friday when

children very successfully and thoroughly set fire to the spinney that
adjoins our property. The only material damage we suffered was to a
boundary fence ; but the smoke, and the commotion caused by the
crews of a couple of fire engines, to say nothing of the very considerable
crowd of sightseers, did irreparable damage as far as the nesting and
near-nesting birds were concerned.
The parrakeets had a very poor season. Abyssinian Lovebirds and
Lineolated Parrakeets managed to rear a few young ones, and the
Red-faced Lovebird colony produced a single young one late in
September--just for a change it was a perfect specimen.
At long-last the Patagonian Conures discovered that the wire-netting
was by no means proof against their escape. One spent a day flying
round the district but returned to its aviary in the evening and was
easily caught up. The unwonted exertion of sustained flight was,
however, too much for it and it died a few days later. The post-mortem
examination showed that it was a somewhat aged female. The " pair "
produced four eggs last year, but the deceased is unlikely to have been
the layer, so seemingly we had been pinning our hopes on two females.
The Madagascar Lovebird lost her green Budgerigar mate early in
the year. She readily accepted a replacement but her two clutches of
eggs, as was to be expected, proved infertile. This year we tried two
pairs of White-bellied Caiques in the wilderness aviary but they
showed no inclination to breed, probably there were too many
counter-attractions. The two pairs of Black-headed Caiques just sat
in a row thinking and occasionally eating. The Green Imperial
Pigeons laid about half a dozen eggs but only managed fully to rear
one young one. The Pied Imperial sextet, after a long series of
infertile eggs, did not bother to lay this year.
The Galapagos Doves failed to rear, always being over-anxious to
nest again. Whereas the old breeding pair of Lemon Doves were not
successful a pair of their last year's young ones reared two. The
Bronze-necked Doves repeated their exercise in prolificacy and four
pairs reared about a couple of dozen young ones.
A Red-eyed or Half-collared Dove (Streptopelia semitorquata) mated
to an European Turtle Dove (6*. turtur) (one we caught some years ago)
successfully reared three pairs of young.
There have been quite a few natural increases in the wilderness
aviary, but we do not think there was anything out of the ordinary.
The difficulty with an aviary of this size and nature is that one is not
aware of all that goes on. Old familiars disappear and " little
strangers " are suddenly sighted never to be seen again. But the great
benefit is that the inmates are at least living comparatively free and
natural lives.

By C. J. O. Harrison (Tooting, London, England)
The Scaly Dove [Scardafella squammata squammata) is a small South
American dove. Aviculturally speaking it is a size larger than the
Diamond Dove ( Geopelia cuneata ), with a tail that is broader, less
graduated, and shorter, relative to the body size.
In general coloration it is dull brown above and creamy-white
below. With the exception of the belly and under tail-coverts, most of
the feathers are edged with black, giving it the typical scaly pattern.
There is a pale pink tint on the breast, and the forehead and throat
are pale, the rest of the head being brown. The iris of the eye is a deep
chestnut-red.
The lesser wing-coverts are brown but the coverts nearer the flight
feathers are white, all being edged with black. The primaries and
primary coverts are chestnut edged with black, and the underside of
the wing, where it is not chestnut, is black. In flight the bird suddenly
becomes brightly coloured. The outermost tail feathers are white, the
central ones brown, and the rest black with graduated white tips.
The closely related Inca Dove of Central America ( Scardafella inca
or Scardafella squammata inca) , the breeding behaviour of which has been
described by Johnston (i960), has a vinous-red tint over the whole
head and breast and lacks most of the white on the wing-coverts.
It has fewer and less conspicuous dark edges to the feathers.
The Scaly Dove was first bred in this country by Seth-Smith in 1904,
and is recorded as having bred at the London Zoo in 1912, but it seems
to have been absent from our aviaries for some forty-five years.
In the early spring of 1959 I purchased four of these birds, hoping to
have at least one pair. They were wild at first and, when put into an
aviary, one died of skull injuries. I tried to buy another and was
offered the only remaining bird. This was lame, the left leg sticking out
at right angles with the inside edge of the foot resting on the ground.
It was able to shuffle round quite rapidly and to balance on a perch.
By this time another bird had died and I was left with three birds.
All were individually recognizable and one I felt sure was a cock.
It was boldly marked, the coloured zones of the plumage clearly
demarcated and bright, and the neck relatively thick, giving it a
slightly small-headed appearance. It had very heavy black edges on
the feathers of the lower breast. The lame bird was dark brown and
very heavily marked with dark edges that formed a bold network over
head and body. Since it also possessed heavy black edges on the lower
breast I suspected it of being another cock.
The third bird was altogether paler, with lighter edges to the
feathers, these being almost absent over much of the breast and head.

Its paler colour and relatively slim appearence made me suspect that
it was a hen.
I waited for some sign of breeding behaviour but the birds behaved
as one. In the wilds they seem to be thicket haunters when not actively
feeding and I had no trouble persuading them to use the shelter shed
attached to the open flight. At dusk, in bad weather, or at the approach
of danger they retired hastily to the shed. They were more sociable
than most doves and fed together and always perched in a tight huddle,
pressed close to one another. Occasionally any one of them would utter
the song ; a clear incisive triple-note " quor-cuc-cuk ", rather high-
pitched and far-carrying.
Sometimes one bird, on approaching another, would indulge in a
rather odd head-waving. The head, raised high on a rather long neck
with the bill tilted a little upwards, would be thrust forwards and
downwards towards the other bird, being drawn back as it was lowered
and then raised and thrust forward again, a series of such movements
occurring in rapid succession to give the impression of a head waved
at the end of a long neck. The movement was a little reminiscent of the
aiming motions made by a dove about to fly.
Apart from this nothing happened and I began to suspect that
I had three cocks. They stayed in the aviary throughout the following
winter. They seemed hardy, and their habit of huddling together in a
sheltered corner of the shed if the weather was not to their liking saved
them from the worst of the cold.
It was not until the middle of the summer of i960 that I became
aware of any special activity. I found that one bird was calling
incessantly in the early morning, a monotonous reiteration of the call
that became a little embarrassing in a small suburban garden. Then
chasing and fighting began to occur between the cock and the light-
coloured bird. It was the latter that was now doing most of the calling.
Within a few days I saw this bird, which I had thought to be a hen,
carrying a grass-stem into the shed, and found that it was paired to the
lame bird.
Knowing that two cock doves may occasionally act as a pair
I suspected that this was what had occurred, and that the lame bird,
being less active than the other, was fulfilling the subordinate role.
During the next week a nest was constructed in a corner of the shed.
This consisted largely of grass-stems and had a distinct cup with a rim
about half an inch high. Whenever I entered the shed the doves left it,
and so a few days later I was able to see an egg in the nest. It was
glossy, slightly bi-conical in shape and cream-coloured with a faint
pink tint. Further observation, and a further egg, revealed that the
lame bird was a hen, and the others both cocks.
They had been markedly social before and even now did not appear
to be strongly territorial. The odd cock was chased if he came close

to the shed but tolerated at the other end of the flight, only 12 ft.
away. But a Diamond Dove that could approach the nest fairly closely
on the other side of a wire-netting partition evoked vigorous threat
reactions.
I did not dare examine the nest closely but young birds were present
after a fortnight. Later I found the nearly fledged young on the ground,
and suspected that the hen, clumsy because of her lameness had
knocked them out when suddenly quitting the nest. Within a few days
both were found dead.
Returning after four weeks absence I found that the birds had
nested again in the same nest ; an unfeathered nestling lay dead below
it, and the hen was incubating a clear egg. I removed both.
They now tried to build on the inch-wide ledges formed by the
tops of the doors of the flight. I finally fixed a shelf about 4 in.
wide over one door, with a handful of grass on it, and fixed the lid of a
basket on the top of the flight above for shelter. This was quickly
utilized by them, and since it was in the open I was able to observe
more of their behaviour.
In display the cock crouches in front of the hen with head lowered
and raises the fanned tail until it almost tilts forwards over the back.
In this position the tail is flexed spasmodically up and down and an
abrupt note, " corrok," is uttered. The call and tail movement do not
appear to be synchronized. Johnston ( loc. cit.) describes the Inca
Dove's call as " cut-cut-ca-doah I could at times detect low, soft
notes interspersed with the display call but they did not seem to form
part of a definite rhythmic utterance.
Unlike that of most doves, the nest-call resembles the display, the
cock uttering the same call and squatting with fanned tail, though this
is not spread so fully nor raised so high as in display. There is the same
jerking of the tail, and in addition a downward thrusting of the head
with the bill pointing downwards.
The first egg was laid late in the day on 4th September, about a week
after nest-building began, the second late in the day on 6th September.
They had not hatched on the morning of 20th, but both were hatched
by the morning of 21st. In spite of the closeness of the hatching times
one youngster was more advanced in development than the other.
In contrast to other species that I have kept, the adults would leave
the nest at my close approach. The young did not fall out, possibly
because the parents could see my approach and did not leave so
suddenly. On the morning of 3rd October, when barely thirteen days
old, the more developed of the two young followed the parent, flying
off the nest at my approach. It flew strongly and fluttered against the
wire of the flight for a short while before dropping to the ground.
I replaced it in the nest, but it flew out again and so I reluctantly left it,
inserting twigs near the nest (which was 6 ft. up and 3 ft. from any

twig) in case the other one decided to leave. Next morning I found
the first one back in the nest, and although it left again it was back
the next night.
The morning of 5th October was cold and I found the first youngster
perched with the parents and the other dying in the nest. I thought
at first that they had deserted it in favour of the other, but an attempt
at hand-rearing revealed that it was suffering from some internal
disorder.
The first young one now spent all its time with the adults, resting and
roosting between them. Within a week it was difficult to distinguish it
from its parents at first glance.
With the advent of cold weather the hen appears to have lost the
urge to nest again.
I fed these doves on pannicum millet and canary seed, with hemp and
maw when available. Oystershell grit, ground cuttle-fish, and
Kilpatrick's minerals were given, and they had in addition the plants
and earth of the aviary.
Apart from a timidity, which I think is partly due to their habitat
needs and might respond to the provision of more apparent cover,
they have much to commend them as aviary birds. At various times
I have kept waxbills, Blackbirds, and thrushes with them and found
the doves quite unaggressive towards them. They seem more sociable
than other small doves. They appear hardier, and better able to take
care of themselves than other small species. The successful nesting
occurred in a period with heavy rains and some night frosts, and I had,
faut de mieux , to keep a cock in a flight with no shelter other than a small
pane of glass until early November without apparent detriment or
discomfort.

Three species new to the collection have been received during
September and October. They are a Christmas Island Frigate Bird
(.Fregata andrewsi) , a pair of Forest Wagtails (. Dendronanthus indicus ),
and a pair of Sooty Flycatchers ( Muscicapa sibirica).
The Frigate Bird is immature and was collected on the Cocos
Islands : the Forest Wagtails, like the Sooty Flycatchers, were im-
ported in excellent condition by Mr. Dineen. This Wagtail inhabits
eastern and south-eastern parts of Asia, migrating as far north as the
Sakhalin and Ussuriland area and as far southward as Sumatra and
Java. Its plumage is of a brownish, black and white pattern that must
render the bird difficult to discern among the forest glades and stream
sides that it frequents. A curious feature is the habit of swaying the
body from side to side and no up and down movement of the tail has
so far been observed.
The Flycatchers are quite well named, being of a dull greyish and
brown colour with whitish throats and under parts and a ring of white
feathers round the eye. There are four races of this species which
ranges widely in eastern Asia and migrates as far southward as
Malaysia. The sexes, like those of the Forest Wagtail, are much alike
in plumage.
Other arrivals of interest are three Humboldt's Penguins (Spheniscus
humboldti) , a pair of Barrow's Golden-eye (. Bucephala islandica) , a Prince
Albert's Curassow ( Crax a. alberti ), a Satyr Tragopan, a pair of Thick-
billed Green Pigeons ( Treron curvirostra nipalensis), a pair of Tambourine
Doves ( Tympanistria t. fraseri), a pair of Madagascar Lovebirds,
a Black-headed Oriole and a Syrian Bulbul ( Pycnonotus barbatus xantho-
pygos). A Great Grey Tinamou was reared at Leckford from eggs
which our male would not incubate.
One or two quite aged birds have died within the past few months.
They include a White-capped Tanager after i6f years in the collection,
a Variable Tanager ( Ramphocelus flammigerus) after 13J years, an Azure-
winged Magpie after 1 if years, and a White-breasted Kingfisher after
1 of years.
With the exception of the Azure-winged Magpie which was caught
in Portugal as a young bird in 1948, the ages of these was not, I think,
known at the time of arrival.

Guest of the Club : Jean Delacour.
Members of the Club, 54 ; guests, 24 ; total, 78.
The seventieth Dinner was arranged to coincide with the seventieth
birthday of Jean Delacour. After the presentation of the Club's
birthday cake, with musical honours, the Chairman gave a brief
outline of our distinguished guest's many and varied activities, centred
principally on bird and animal collecting and keeping, exploration,
and museum research. The Chairman touched briefly on Jean
Delacour's army service in two world wars, the destruction of his
estates at Villers-Bretonneux in the first and Cleres in the second :
exploration and collecting in Indo-China and Madagascar ; world-
wide travels, authorship of hundreds of papers and many major
works, including monographs of pheasants and waterfowl of the world ;
and, finally, his recent retirement from the very successful directorship
of the Los Angeles County Museum. The Chairman concluded his
necessarily short review by quoting a message from our member
James Rooney, of Washington. This message, which must surely
express the opinion of the great majority, succinctly sums up our
guest of honour : " He is what we call ' tops ' as a gentleman,
naturalist, author, conservationist, diplomat, administrator, and
promoter of worthy causes."
Jean Delacour, in his own charming and inimitable manner,
thanked the members and guests for their very cordial welcome and
good wishes. He recalled his long association with the Society, dating
from 1916, and mentioned a few of his friends of days gone by. He

then gave the following account of " Waterfowl Conservation in
J apan " :
Until less than a hundred years ago Japan was a bird paradise.
The Tokugawa Shogunate, which had run the country for nearly three
centuries and had completely shut it off from the rest of the world, had
enforced a practically complete protection. No one except the Emperor
and the Shogun was allowed to shoot or to kill anything and, even
the capture of birds was controlled. The larger wildfowl, such as
swans, geese, ducks, cranes, storks, herons, ibises, were very plentiful,
some as resident species, others as summer or winter migrants.
The new regime which in 1868 replaced the Shogunate, re-estab-
lished the power of the Emperor himself. It opened the country to
foreigners and introduced many liberal measures, many of them very
welcome. But a few others were not so happy, among them the right
for everyone to kill everything. Within a few years the larger birds
were decimated. It is most extraordinary that the Japanese have an
inborn interest and love for birds. A few species were completely
wiped out, particularly the Oriental populations of Snow and Canada
Geese which previously wintered commonly in Japan ; none has
ever returned since. Other geese and the swans were greatly reduced
in numbers, and also the ducks. The beautiful Mandarins almost
disappeared. The cranes were terribly slaughtered, particularly on
their wintering grounds. It was all the worse since three of the most
beautiful and local species which nest farther north were affected :
the Japanese or Manchurian Crane (Grus japonensis) , the White-
necked Crane (Grus vipio ), and Hooded Crane ( Grus monachus) . The
rare Steller's Albatross ( Diomedea alhatrus) was all but exterminated
on the islands of Izeu, its only breeding territory, because of the value
of its wing feathers. The Japanese Stork (Ciconia boyciana ) and the
Japanese Crested Ibis (, Nipponia nippon) still are on the verge of extinc-
tion, fewer than twenty specimens of each living at present in Japan.
It was only at the turn of this century that awareness began to rise
in Japan as to the seriousness of the situation. A few ornithologists
began to be interested in the survival of the threatened species. Some
of them belonged to the old ruling class and were connected with the
Imperial family. They caused some protective measures to be adopted
and the total extinction of several species was therefore avoided. But
it was already too late in some cases.
There are at present some good conservation measures, as well
as refuges and national parks. The last wintering grounds of the cranes
in Kiushiu have become sanctuaries, but both the Hooded and the
White-necked Crane populations are now reduced to a few dozen.
They may still be ruthlessly destroyed on their nesting grounds and
on migration in North-Eastern Asia.
The Japanese Cranes used to breed throughout Japan and on the

Continent, where their present situation is not clear. To-day their
Japanese range is reduced to Eastern Hokkaido in the vicinity of
Kuchiro. And they have been so well protected that a flock of over
150 has been built up during the last ten years, from only about ten
pairs that remained. Part of their range is a national park ; in the
rest farmers, now well aware of their great interest, protect and feed
them. These large and magnificent white birds, with black neck
and wing tips covering the tail, are probably the finest of all cranes.
Although some populations used to migrate, those of Hokkaido are
quite sedentary, therefore easier to protect. We recently had an
excellent view of the Japanese Cranes in Hokkaido. Many pairs were
nesting in June throughout the area, but young, still non-breeding
birds, returned every day to be fed to a large fenced-in pen where five
wing-clipped birds are permanently kept.
Incidentally, the common breeding duck of Hokkaido is the Falcated
Teal (Anas falcata) which could be seen in pairs in all the marshes.
There still are about seventeen storks on the main island, mostly
in the vicinity of Kyoto, and they are carefully protected. They have,
however, failed to rear young during the last few years, a very alarming
state of things. It is feared that the use of insecticides in the rice-
fields where they live is responsible for their failure.
There were recently only seven Crested Ibises left in the north
of the main islands, but three more had just left the nest when we
were in Japan. It is hoped that more storks and ibises still exist in
Korea, Manchuria, and South-Eastern Siberia, but these two fine
species certainly are in a highly precarious situation.
During the recent meeting in Tokyo of the International Council
for Bird Preservation pressing resolutions were passed, and the activities
of the Japanese Section greatly supported. An Asian Continental
Section has been created to co-ordinate the efforts of the different
countries, and it is hoped that this will very favourably affect our
struggle to preserve the many wonderful species of oriental waterfowl.
As Jean Delacour is in future to spend much more time in Europe
it is to be hoped that it will not be long before the Club is again able
to welcome him.

Breeding reports. Mrs. E. J. Birchall, Moustache Parrakeet, two
hatched, one reared. Major V. Dilwyn-Jones, Salmon-crested
Cockatoo, two eggs, incubated for the full period, disappeared,
presumably infertile ; two further eggs in process of incubation :
Citron-crested Cockatoo, one young one just hatched (4th October).

Last year a pair of Cuban Amazons owned by Mrs. Velma
McDaniels, Lomita, California, went to nest. A soft-shelled egg was
dropped on the floor on 10th May, but three others were laid in the
nest on 12th, 14th, and 17th May. Three young were hatched on
17th June ; one died on 4th July and the remaining two on 6th July.
They had full crops but were bruised and flattened. This year's
breeding attempt has had a happier result. Three young were hatched
but on 3rd June the parents deserted the nest which contained one
dead and two live young about four days' old. Mrs. McDaniels, by
the exercise of very great patience, successfully hand-reared both and
now, at five months' old, they are developing into clear and fluent
talkers. This success is believed to be a " first " for the U.S.A.

Subscriptions, i960. Despite the appeal made in the November-
December, 1959, number of the Magazine it was necessary to send
reminders to 427 members--an increase of twenty-seven ! Second
reminders were sent to 186 (1959, 228) and third to 122 (1959, 138).
Will members please help to conserve the Society's funds by making
prompt use of the renewal form inserted in the present number of

LADY AMHERST'S PHEASANTS LIVING WILD IN DEVON

I have just been reading the July-August number of your Magazine and am wonder-
ing if any of your readers would be interested to know that there are still some survivors
of Lady Amherst's Pheasant living completely wild in a wood at Lynton, North
Devon. I saw a cock in September last. I understand that a number were set
free to fend for themselves by a past owner of the Castle Hotel at Lynton. This
happened some good few years ago.
About five years ago I saw a pair and never was able to spot them again until last
September when I saw the cock bird.
